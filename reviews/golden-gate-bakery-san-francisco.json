The websites don't seem to be updated anymore, but easiest way to determine if they will open is to just give them a call to ask when they will be open on a certain day. They may not know in advance and tell you to call them back the day before for an update. I did just that and found out they were opening at noon the Saturday I was in town.\n\nMake sure you come early. We came 15 min. before opening and there was already a small line. About 5 min. before opening the line was as long as the street. I think they take so long because they bake the egg tarts as you order. They also don't limit how much you buy, so if you don't get there early be prepared to wait. Each tart is $2.50 each, and I was able to order a dozen. The filling is deeper than most egg tarts and the shell is the buttery, puff pastry kind, which I prefer over the cookie crust. The custard has a somewhat creme brulee texture. Very light and not too sweet. It's especially good when still warm.\n\nIn addition to their egg tarts, try their almond cookies too. I got some for my dad and he said they were the more traditional almond cookies compared to the bright orange ones you get in stores. I liked that the cookies weren't as sweet. But they are way overpriced at $9 a bag, aka $1 per tiny cookie. Overall great egg tarts, but my absolute favorite egg tart is still from Lung Moon Bakery in NYC where the custard is firmer. I would get these egg tarts again though.", "author": "Jocelyn K."}

I came at 1pm on a Sunday and waited around 30min in line. The line is not long but every person is ordering a lot, and thus, they take a long time with each customer.\n\nI have heard that they will close early (once they sell out) so I am glad that I came earlier in the day.\n\nI came here for the egg tarts, but after waiting in line for so long, I also tried the walnut cookie and macaroons.\n\nEgg tarts: I was pretty surprised that these are really good. They are fresh (still warm), the crust is flakey, and the center is a good consistency where it's pretty silky smooth. I do feel that the custard lacked a bit of flavor, but I have been spoiled by egg tarts from Hong Kong. These are the best egg tarts I've had in the US.\n\nWalnut Cookies: These were very popular but I didn't think they were anything special. They're not bad but I wouldn't wait in line for these. My favorite part of the cookie is that it's chewy in the middle.\n\nCoconut Macaroons: I decided to try these after reading many reviews about them. I thought it was strange buying coconut macaroons from a Chinese bakery, but they were actually really good!

The egg custard tarts are obviously amazing, they have the perfect custard consistency, not too sweet but just enough of the eggy goodness.

Sesame balls, get it if you are a fan of those delightful dim sum treats cause you stood in that line so make it worth it. The almond cookie, skip. The mooncakes pretty darn good, I've only had the pineapple and taro. \n\nMy 4 stars...why?!! It's due to the fact that they don't have everything available even when you go the minute they open.

Proceeded to line up only to learn about 10 mins into waiting that they were NOT selling their famed egg custard tarts, and it turned out they were doing their moon cake special. Ultimately, I decided to stand in line and order some moon cakes to try..I was already there, after all. To be specific, the moon cakes that they sell are the Cantonese variety, not the Taiwanese ones.\n\nUpon getting my foot into the door of the bakery, I could see their extensive moon cake menu. There were so many different fillings and you could choose to have anywhere between 0 to 4 yolks in your mooncake. I ended up getting just two: a white lotus one with 1 yolk and a pineapple one with no yolk.\n\nI definitely like moon cakes and always look forward to the Mid-Autumn Moon Festival, but let's be honest....they're really heavy. Normally, I can maybe eat 1/8th or 1/4th of a moon cake in one sitting and probably be okay for the rest of day. Golden Gate's moon cakes were noticeably lighter than other moon cakes I've eaten. The flavor of the white lotus paste was still sweet, but not cloyingly so. The saltiness of the yolk paired well with it. I especially liked the pineapple moon cake, which is one that I've personally never had until now. The pineapple filling is actually tart and I felt like I could have easily eaten half of it without any regrets.\n\nThe egg custard tarts of Golden Gate Bakery are rightfully legendary, but don't pass up on their moon cakes either when that times comes around!", "author": "Clarice C."}

The scene is quiet in Chinatown: not many tourists or locals, just a few of us who either have the day off or are done with work already.  After having lunch in North Beach, I was craving an egg tart.  Hoping to win the lottery and catch this place open, I started walking towards the bakery. (Pro tip:  do not attempt to drive directly into Chinatown.  Park in one of the nearby garages or take public transportation.  The streets in this hood are too narrow and too busy with pedestrians to make it worth your while).  \n\nJackpot!!! Golden Gate Bakery was open AND there were only a handful of customers inside.  I was served right away, with everything at my fingertips.  If I wasn't already full, I probably would have bought out all the goodies (which would not have been smart, since I was walking/bussing around).  The lady at the counter wanted me to get everything, but I chose 4 egg tarts and two sesame balls.  She placed them in a pink box, tied it up with a string, and cut out some holes in the corners (since all the pastries were still warm!).\n\nTo say these items were large would be the understatement of the year.  The sesame balls were as big as a baseball and super tasty!  Just one could be a meal in itself.  And the egg tart was as advertised... the best I've ever had.  The crust was flaky, the filling was warm and luscious, somehow both heavy and light at the same time.  \n\nSomehow, I restrained myself from eating the entire order right on the sidewalk and saved some for my wife.  But next time, I might eat them all myself!\n\nLastly, this place is cash only.  There is an ATM across the street.  And while I was fortunate to not have to deal with the throngs, be ready to wait in line if they happen to be open.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

Honestly, I think it's the high demand and the allure of catching them when they're open. They take random vacations and a lot of the workers here have worked there for decades (one of ladies told me she's been there for 30+ years!)\n\nEgg tarts is their game and yes, they've pretty much perfected it. Will you stand in a long line waiting to grab some? That's the real question. These egg tarts coming out piping out and fresh out of the oven. That's why you're really waiting in that long line - because the shop is TINY and I'm sure only so many trays can be baked. \n\nBut the end result of all your waiting? Deliciousness. Light flakey but crispy crust that's a little buttery but delicious with a creamy custard that's not too overpowering of egg but delicate and light. And that, is just perfection. \n\nI'm going to be honest - I'm biased. I grew up in Hong Kong and grew up on egg tarts. So I love them in general, but golden gate's takes me back to those days in my childhood that I can't find in other egg tarts. \n\nThe egg tarts at $2.50 a pop and honestly, just buy what you're planning to eat. Don't buy 4 dozen, don't buy a dozen just because you've been waiting in that line. Heck, don't even buy them to take home or on a plane or whatever. These things are best eaten when they're fresh out of the oven and any other experience will be lackluster. \n\nNow....the secrets. There's a facebook page that sort of tracks whether the store is open. Use it. Don't call them, don't try to check out their yelp hours. Just look up that facebook. Parking in Chinatown is a hassle so use the facebook! Secondly, if you're planning on ordering a good amount (even like a dozen), you can CALL AHEAD AND SKIP THE LINE! \n\nWhat?! Skipping the line?! Yeah. I didn't know about it either until my last experience where a woman came in and told the workers (Hey, I'm here for my pick up order of XYZ).

Hailing from LA, we've got a lot of Hong Kong dim sum restaurants in the 626 but they can't compare to those up in SF.

Not only does it taste different, the people who make them are different. \n\nEnough with the history lesson, let's get down to business. The egg tarts here has a flaky crust all around and an extremely hot core when you take your first bite. I have never tasted any egg tart fresh off the oven and straight into my mouth.

A friend of mine said I should try their egg tarts when he found out I was in San Francisco for business.\n\nI wandered into Chinatown after dinner in the Financial District and - according to other Yelp reviewers - was lucky to find that they were open AND there were no lines. I was informed that they were out of egg tarts, but the next batch would come out in fifteen minutes, so I waited.\n\nThe store is tiny and consists of a counter where you order and pay, cash only. During my visit, they still had a lot of moon cakes left over from the Mid-Autumn Festival. I probably should have purchased one, after reading the moon cake reviews here on Yelp.\n\nAs I waited for the egg tarts, a crowd started forming of people waiting for them. The store owners were cheerful and friendly, making small talk with customers while we waited. Every two minutes, the store owner would call the kitchen and hurry them up to send the egg tarts. After the fifth call, I started feeling really bad for the poor person on the other end of the line.\n\nWhen I finally managed to get my hands on one of the precious egg tarts, it was way too hot to eat immediately.

Hands down, these were the best egg tarts I have ever had, and I've tried many many egg tarts throughout my life. The egg tart is truly baked to perfection. The crust is flakey but thick enough to support the egg custard in the middle. The egg custard itself is perfectly sweetened but has some sort of addictive taste to it that makes you just want more of it. Even after leaving it out in the cold for 4 ours it still tasted amazing. It will still taste as amazing even if you reheat it the next day. This place is well worth the hype and I would recommend this to anyone.", "author": "Eric Q."}

Having bookmarked this place for what seemed years, I happened upon GGB about 15 people deep. First off, what may be surprising is that they're open and second of all there were only 15 people in front where the line usually goes down the entire block.\n\nAfter a half an hour wait, settled inside the small bakery of strewn boxes and miscellaneous non-bakery related items (Look inside, you'll get what I mean ...) there isn't much-baked goods out in their counter and the egg tarts come out on trays from the back. Decided with a wait, might as well get my money's worth and got 6 egg tarts.\n\nEgg tarts came out piping hot. Smelled delicious and was properly placed in a box and tied. The egg tart smelled and looked beautiful. Nice deep cups, flaky and buttery crust. The egg custard itself, although hot and molten straight out of the oven was not to my liking. I mean, I may have burnt off 50% of my tastebuds by the sheer heat of the damn thing but it was way too water and eggy. I prefer egg tarts that are more set and creamy versus egg and these were exactly the opposite. Nothing against the way they make egg tarts, just personal preference. Ended up eating my egg tart and brought the rest home for the family to consume. They ate the egg tarts but there were no remarks on it being delicious or exponentially better than anything else we've had.\n\nWas lucky enough to happen upon GGB when they were open and with a \"short\" line. Would I wait in line for these egg tarts? Absolutely not. It did knock off an SF \"To Try\" off my list, however.\n\nCASH ONLY", "author": "Janet N."}

There's even a specific fan-made website notifying you if the bakery is open today or not (since the bakery is so popular, the owners tend to go on spontaneous vacations, leaving fans stranded). You'd often find a line out the door with dozens of people waiting at any time but trust me, IT IS SO WORTH IT. \n\nThough there is usually a line coming out the door, the grandmas are really good at hustling people in and out quickly. I only had to wait around 15 minutes with about 10 people waiting in front of me. \n\nSpeaking of which, the grandmas running the shop ARE SO GOOD AT HUSTLIN' YOU, IT'S ALMOST SCARY. There was a Indian family in front of me who were obviously tourists and was asking me what was good there. One of the grandmas overheard them and before I could reply she said briskly, \"Every thing is good\". At the end of their visit, she convinced the family to buy nearly every pastry. I was impressed. \n\nAnyways, back to the food, what they are known for are the heavenly Hong Kong -Style egg tarts. Since this bakery is so popular, you can expect the egg tarts to be fresh any time of the day. It is UH-MAZING. The tart crust is extremely flaky, tender, and buttery. The custard is glassy, smooth as silk, and blow-your-mind good. At $2.25 a pop, these are pretty cheap for the amount of deliciousness you get.

Definitely call the store ahead of time since it seems like their operating hours are somewhat random. At first, I was skeptical that the egg tarts here could really be THAT good, but after putting one of these delicious morsels in my mouth, I was made into a true believer.\n\nGolden Gate Bakery's egg tarts are amazing! Fresh from the oven, the custard is silky smooth and ever-so-slightly sweet, while the crust is buttery and flaky with an almost lightly fried texture despite it being baked. At the time of this writing, one egg tart will set you back $2.50 in cash ($30 for a dozen), which is a bit expensive, but I chalk it up as a \"popularity tax\" for being so good.

The vast majority of opinions here seemed to say even though the entire experience getting to the food was terrible it was worth it, and yea it is. Our particular experience wasn't even that bad because we got there around 1pm and it was OPEN!!! If you don't know already there's a website dedicated watch-dogging this place for being open/closed and hours. When we went on Monday they had a sign that they'll open at noon. The line was short but moved slowly, probably took us a good half hour of waiting. \n\nThere is no filming inside the store, and there were two ladies taking orders and wrapping up your food. It's crazy the # of things people buy, I saw a girl walk out with 5 dozen egg tarts! It's pretty reasonably priced since $2.25 each or $27/dozen. We were going to be reasonable and get 6 but decided we'd be stupid not to get a full dozen. We were right, we had a wait a little bit because they were out and we were waiting for the next batch, and it was totally worth it. They also have other items other than egg tarts since they are a bakery, they had amazing looking moon cakes, etc and I ended up getting a sesame ball as well that was filled with red bean paste. The sesame ball was good too just slightly greasy.\n\nThe egg tarts are actually pretty big and it's filled WAY up to the flaky crust. I don't know how but every single egg tart is so perfect and it's truly just beautiful to look at. It's also the PERFECT amount of sweetness and the texture is a firm custard. The crust is nearly indescribable, it's flaky, buttery and perfectly complementary to the custard. Hands down the best egg tart I've certainly ever had in my life and it's ruined me for egg tarts at 85 degrees, etc. Each egg tart was also super filling and though the flakiness disappeared by the next day every single one and bite was absolutely amazing. \n\nSo yeah, I would totally do this again, it's btw a very non descript tiny hole in the wall in Chinatown and there is pretty much no parking.

It is quite a hilly trek to make it out to this area, and I had tried and failed three times. This place is family owned so hours and closure could be quite random and frustrating. There is even a website counting on the community to check to see if its open (http://www.is-the-golden-gate-bakery-open-today.com/)!\n\nWe got there around 12:45pm and there was already a massive line even though it had just opened. It took about 45 mins to get through, but it was definitely worth it! The egg itself is more like a creme brulee, with a hard shell on top that crumbles easily to yield to a light and fluffy custard. The crust is perfect, neither undercooked nor burnt. It also was pretty amazing that after 20 mins, the egg tarts were still freshly warm after purchase. \n\nFor $2.50 a pop, the tarts are more on the pricey side.

There were fresh dan tat right out of the oven at the time and the line was short, so why not?\nWe ordered two dan tat, which my boyfriend checked with me twice about.

I broke my veganism streak to try a bit of their desserts and I must shamefully say, it did not dissapoint.\n\n4) At $2.75 a piece for most things, the pricing is a bit steep and since it's my first time here and wanted my family to try some, I spent ~$40 for 8 tarts, 2 moon cakes, 1 bag of almond cookies, and 1 sesame ball. That's pricey for food in China town haha\n\nWe got:\n\nEgg tarts - 4.5/5\n      It's one of those dishes that's easy to make decent, but hard to make stand out, and upon the first few piping hot bites, the flavor of the egg was too much (remember, I haven't had eggs in a long time) and so I deemed it decent, with potential. The crust was so flakey and was the saving grace at the time. After eating it again, cooled an hour later, the sweetness from the sugar pulled through and the custard had set to a better consistency instead of the jiggly steamed egg appearance. The bf and I both agreed this now was worth the rave. It could be that our poor souls have never tried legitimate, traditional egg tarts, so the former profile is what makes it good and what folks seek out. We don't know, don't stone us XD. \n\nCoconut tarts - 5/5\n         We overheard people in line praising the Coconut tarts so we thought we had to give it a try as well. These were amazing! Very popular amongst my Vietnamese relative. (As a culture, we don't eat egg tarts, so while it's good, these seemed to have a better flavor profile depth-wise)\n\nSesame Ball (Banh Cam) - 3/5\n           The intrigue with these, were that they were huge. Filled with red bean, encased in a rice/tapioca outer layer with a deep fried sesame crust, it's a classic Chinese/viet dessert. It's decent, but nothing you can't find at other bakeries. These guys are always vegan. \n\nLotus Moon Cake (Banh Trung Thu) - 4.5/5\n           We also over heard these were good from the crowd. The girl in front of us also reccomended it, so you know... Peer pressure.  The skin on these were dried out perfectly, texture - wise, and the filling was sweetened just enough, while the egg yolk was salted perfectly as well. My only critique is that the batch I got might have stayed in the oven a bit too long as I could taste a slight bitterness emitting through the skin. But overall, the quality and taste is the same if not better than Kieng Giang in my opinion ( Socal's popular bakery for moon cakes)\n\nAlmond Cookies - 4/5\n        Traditional in taste, not overly sweet, and comes in a pack of 6-8 I believe. I'm not particularly fond of these cookies, but they were popular amongst yelpers. \n\nWe unanimously recommend the Egg and Coconut tarts; Moon cakes for the older crowds.

Also do not be surprised if they disappear for months at a time (handwritten sign on cardboard will read: on vacation) ... if you try to call ahead you will get yelled at and possibly hung up on.\n\nBut also be prepared to eat the most delicious egg tarts, fresh out of the oven, with their molten egg custard centers still tender nestled in their flaky, buttery pastry shells. Eat these hot, standing on the sidewalk. You've officially been initiated into the club of those-who-know locals who enjoy such delicacies in SF Chinatown daily. \n\nThen walk across the street and find the alley with Bruce Lee's face and take a photo of yourself.  Congratulations for finding the real SF Chinatown experience.  I always bring friends here if they want something authentic and unique.\n\nAnd don't believe the egg tart ladies.  There is one item on the menu that people come here for. Egg tarts. So buy yourself a dozen (they'll cut a little hole to let the steam escape). Enjoy as many fresh out of the oven, standing on the sidewalk and then bring home the rest.  Don't worry, there will be a long line of people doing the same thing. Be prepared to feel self conscious because the tourists who don't know about GG bakery will be looking at your egg tart trying to figure out what the big deal is. \n\nEverything else at this store is ordinary and can be gotten elsewhere without a sour attitude lol. But their egg tarts are the best.", "author": "Joyce M."}

I am sorry, does egg tart usually taste like eggs with a jello- tofu texture where it's that firm??? Maybe I have been too tainted with new egg tarts like 85 degree bakery...but I didn't care too much for the custard. I didn't think it was rich or creamy so I was bummed. I was really looking forward to this. It just tasted eggs, but nothing else really. It was semi-sweet which was nice, but the crust was richer to me.\n\nThe line wasn't too bad when I got there. I only waited 30 minutes. The creme horn looking cannoli was good though. I really liked the filling b/c it had walnuts and raisins, but the dough was just okay to me. Overall, very fast-paced. Know what you want because they take orders fast and people will try to order before you even though they're after you in line. Cash only! $27 for a dozen. Pretty big tarts though so 1 was enough for me. Random hours and EVERYONE comes here. A lot of locals, people even driving 1 hour or 2 away to just come here, and tourists.

I have never tried the other items here but I did see people buying them. I haven't been here for over 2 years and I just came by last week to find out that each egg tart is now $2.25. I think it is overpriced for lack of visible reinvestment into the business. If you pimp up the space, come up with new flavors, adjust to inflations or open additional stores, I feel it makes sense to increase the price. However, when other places sell them at the same price over the years and they raise it to over $2, it just seems like greed to me.

The bakery only had fresh egg tarts, sesame roll, and red bean pastry. I ordered 8 egg tarts and one sesame roll since they were expensive and hard to come by since waiting in line can take up to 1-1/2 hrs on a weekend. A dozen egg tarts costed $27!\n\nAfter dinner, I ate the egg tarts, and they were fresh and sweet. The tarts didn't soggy up the crust. The tart wasn't heavy on the stomach like before so I can finish 1/2 my egg tart at ease. I sampled the large sesame roll; regardless, of its large size, it was a good as the sesame rolls I've eaten at my local bakery.\n\nIt's still worth waiting in line for as long as they don't run out.

Several customers behind us spoke to the ladies in their native language, had their goods boxed up, paid & left before we were even acknowledged. While waiting at the counter 3-4 people walked in, skipping the entire line, had dozens of items boxed, paid and left. A customer in front of us could see my agitation, explained they were waiting for more egg tarts to be brought up but to be honest we could have done without if we had even been acknowledged. Incredibly frustrating so for that we'll never revisit.\n\nThe egg tart had a delicious golden crust, the custard was lightly sweetened and perfectly rich.

If you happen to walk by and they're closed but someone's inside, they might tell you the next time they're open for business.\n\nIn addition to the egg tarts, they also make other baked goods and pastries, but everyone flocks here in droves specifically for the egg tarts. Expect to wait at least an hour in a line that could stretch half a block down the street before you're able to get in to order. You don't have to worry about them running out because it appears like they constantly bake new batches, and if you're REALLY lucky, you'll end up with some tarts that are fresh out of the oven.\n\nThe tarts themselves are definitely worth the wait. They're definitely on the larger side, and at $2.15 each, it's also a bit pricy. There's no discount for buying a dozen, but there's a sign to let you know how much a dozen is. The custard has an eggy texture, is very soft and fluffy. The top of the custard has an amazing and perfectly smooth finish to it. The crust is light and airy, with a satisfying crunch to it. It's very flaky, buttery and almost melts in your mouth. The tarts are piping hot, so exercise some caution before biting into one.

Most people said these are the best ones in the world. So I ordered 6 of these morsels. It cost $2.50 each. So it rose in price. This is probably the most expensive in the country by far.\nThe ratio of egg custard and puff pastry are just right. The crunchy, flaky puff pastry is excellent. The egg custard is perhaps made with whole eggs, milk, water & sugar. It is jiggly soft so it may have gelatin, & it is brushed lightly with a vanilla syrup. To my standards the egg custard wasn't really good. So it was 3/5. Pretty half disappointed on the egg custard, and half phenomenal on the pastry. I am going to try their lotus with 1 yolk mooncake later tonight.\nCustomer service is organized here.\nThe way they packaged is special, they cut the box corners to make sure the puff pastry is crunchy & flaky.

The wait however is ridiculous and so are their hours. Make sure you call before you go because often times they wont be open or wont have egg tarts on certain days. Each egg tart is $2.50 and $30 for a dozen, there is no discount for buying more. They are currently selling moon cakes for about $10-11. Beware that the wait is very long because they are pretty inefficient. The employees making the egg tarts will make a batch and youll have to wait another 15-30 minutes for the next batch...It was worth it to try it but I dont know if i would wait another 2-3 hours again. I dont know if they do not have enough equipment or if they can only make a certain amount each time but they definitely need to find a more efficient way because their customers are waiting too long.

The ladies really take their sweet time giving you the egg tarts and often spend time conversing with customers or on the phone so that's what makes the wait so damn long... \n\nThe prices were 1 egg tart $2.25 and a dozen for $27.... honestly it's kind of a rip off if you ask me coming from a native New Yorker that can gets delicious egg tarts in NY Chinatown without having to wait in an hour line, nor spend that much.

Their long lines always make people passing by question what the wait is for, but once you walk past the entrance and smell the sweet aroma of baked goods, you can't help but also wait in line. I came here on a Saturday at 1:00pm and waited about 30 minutes, but the wait is definitely worth it to get those freshly made egg tarts. This place is cash only but there's an ATM right across the street if you forget. \n\n*FOOD* \nThe egg tarts are their most popular item. The price is gradually increasing being $2.15/piece as of today, but the egg tarts are bigger and more fresh compared to the ones that are $1/piece. The egg tarts are delicious and served warm from just coming out of the oven. I love how flaky and buttery the crust is, but as for the filling, I wasn't a huge fan of how eggy some of mine tasted. It seemed like they were from the same batch, but some of them had the perfect filling consistency while a few were more runny/eggy. Regardless, they were still tasty and not overly sweet. \n\n*LOCATION*\nVery small store just to allow the people ordering inside. There's only street parking since it's SF, but there's a parking garage (Portsmouth Square Plaza Garage) just a few blocks down (~5 min walking!) that's $4/hour. \n\n*SERVICE* \nService has been pretty good the few times I've gone.

First that there is always a long line and second is that there is no way to know when they will be open. I've passed by Golden Gate Bakery many times while walking through Chinatown and each time it's either closed because they are on \"Vacation\" or there is a long wait due to the slow moving line of people waiting outside, so I've given it a skip. This changes a couple of days ago. Around 8 pm there was absolutely no line so I decided to give it a try.\n\nI got 3 of their custard tarts ($1.95 each). Even at 8 pm which is their closing time they were fresh out of the oven and piping hot. These were literally the best egg tarts that I've had period. The crust was flaky and the filling light. I wished that the filling was a little sweeter but that's more of a personal choice rather than the norm. Egg tarts from other bakeries in Chinatown range from $1.10 to $1.40 a pop so these are definitely a lot more expensive. I guess the additional cost is what is paying for their frequent vacations and arbitrary opening times. Golden Gate Bakery is a tourist trap no doubt as it is on the must visit place for people visiting San Francisco. The product is excellent but when you factor in the high price, long wait and not knowing if they will actually be open, I can at best give them an A-OK grade.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

Yup, although Google Maps says they're open everyday from a certain time to close, it's usually wrong. Every time I'm in the area and decide to wait in line for some egg tarts, the place is usually closed. CALL. It'll save you disappointment and time.

Yelp and the website say that the bakery opens at 8 am.  However, as we arrived at 8 am, we saw a note on the door that they open at 11.  That was a bit frustrating as we made a far journey to get there.\n\nThe weird part is that as we walked up to the door an old Asian grandma walked up from the outside and just stood there looking at us.  She wouldn't move, and just kept starting.  Her at us, and us at her.  A delivery guy then came up to the door to drop stuff off, and she also just stared at him.  He made a comment about wanting to deliver, and she remained motionless.\n\nThis all got too creepy for me (especially for 8 am before coffee), so we walked away and tried to find another bakery.  I really wanted to go to this place because of all the reviews, but I guess it wasn't meant to be. :-(", "author": "Patrick M."}

All that egg custard in the center of a flaky crust MMM MMM!! \n\nParking could be a pain around the area. My family usually likes to park in the parking structure close to the park area of Chinatown and then walk a couple blocks to get to this location. I believe the parking garage is called Plymouth Square? Don't quote me on that.\n\nThe wait for these egg tarts could be anywhere from an hour to 1.5 hours on a good day. All egg tarts are made so frequently, so it's always a fresh batch. Once you get a dozen (or two), open the box and try one for yourself!! It tastes best when it's fresh. They also have other pastries such as mooncakes when in season, Asian Rice Krispies, and coconut or red bean mochi. Honestly, I only go for the egg tarts. Pricing increased over the years but I believe a dozen egg tarts go for $27 right now. \n\nI've also heard you can call in to pre-order and then arrive there to pick up if the line is too long for you. They only honor this if there is a long line. \n\nOverall, do try to go here if you're in town. I know it's too good to pass up and it's totally worth the wait. Heads up: since they have business all the time, they do NOT hesitate to take a vacation when they need one. I suggest calling in first to see if they're open before heading there. And also, you can't miss it. It's the shop with a long noticeable line outside.", "author": "Sandy T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-12", "description": "So glad I was finally able to try out Golden Gate Bakery for myself to settle once and for all if their egg tarts really are the best in the US. I've tried to visit them on 3 prior and separate occasions, each time leaving San Francisco disappointed after finding out that Golden Gate Bakery was on yet another break. I actually had been able to try their egg tarts once many years ago after my dad had brought them back down from an SF trip. Even though the egg tarts were no longer fresh, they still tasted way better than any bakery I've had around the 626 area. That sealed it for me - I had to visit them one day in the flesh. \n\nMy family and I were actually heading to Fisherman's Wharf for lunch when we somehow passed by Chinatown. We spontaneously drove by Golden Gate Bakery (because why not) and saw that it was OPEN and even better, there was no line! What the heck?! I immediately tore out of the car (more like wandered in a confused daze) toward the store. There were only maybe 5 people or so in front of me in line. I seriously had a deja vu moment because I've never set foot into their store and yet I clearly remember ordering egg tarts for myself in that store before! \n\nThe egg tarts had JUST come out of the oven, and yet the customers in front of me weren't even buying them! More for me right? We bought half a dozen ($1.95 each), some strawberry pies, and a sticky rice cake. The prices of pastries here are actually not cheap. Each item seems to be more than $1.50, and buying them by the dozen doesn't result in any discounted price either. \n\nSo was that egg tart worth the three disappointed visits? The answer is a solid YES. I ate it right away when it was still warm and fresh, and it was amazing. I wouldn't say the egg tarts are as good as the ones I've had in Hong Kong (where they're even cheaper!), but they would give the HK bakeries a run for their money. These egg tarts are filled deep with custard and bigger than most SGV bakeries' egg tarts. Custard had the right amount of sweetness, and the crust was a warm, delicious, and flaky piece of goodness. The smoothness of the custard definitely contrasts well with the flakiness of the crust, making each bite THAT amazing. I usually like to scoop out the egg tart's custard like a cr\u00e8me brulee before eating the crust separately, but no can do. I had to eat it all at once. Amazing! I ended up consuming three egg tarts that day and ... not even sorry. \n\nThe strawberry pies - we saw people buying it, but they were a major disappointment. I think this is geared towards their American customers/foreigners. If you're a fan of Asian pastries and baked goods, don't try this. Very strong taste of persevered jelly mixed with walnuts and canned strawberries. The crust was not too bad, especially when eaten warm, but not something I would try again. \n\nWe also got a sticky rice cake - not what we were expecting when we ordered the \"sew bang.\" This was very similar to the sweetened Taiwanese rice cakes; not a fan as this was quite tasteless. \n\ntl;dr - YES an absolute must-try if you're in the San Francisco area. Don't be disheartened by the number of times they're on vacation. Try again if you have to! Or visit the is the golden gate bakery open today website. Workers were really fast and efficient. We were in and out within 5-10 minutes with our delicious egg tarts. Now that I've had them, I don't feel like I'm in any rush to go back, especially since they're so hard to catch while open. But I'll definitely make a trip and stop by to see if I can get more egg tarts the next time I'm in SF!", "author": "Tiffany C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-01", "description": "This was my first time ever having an egg tart and hopefully last time waiting in a line 45-minutes for one, but it was pretty good. \n\nDefinitely not the kind of thing I'd ever go out of my for or crave, but it's interesting and unlike any pastry I've ever had before. \n\nAlso ordered 2 of their Moon Pies since I saw so many reviews raving about them but wasn't as impressed. The egg tarts are under $2 each and priced pretty fairly while the moon tarts are $8 each and not at all my taste. Also there was some confusion about what flavor moon pies they had among the employees so I'm still not really sure what kind we got. \n\nThe line moves slowly but mainly because most people buy the tarts by the dozen so they run out after just 2-3 people get through the line and can't bake them fast enough. It seems like with such a long line and history that they could work on a more efficient way to produce more, but maybe that's part of the draw. \n\nInside was pretty janky. Not gonna lie- the cleanliness of the place seemed pretty questionable. There's a hand-written cardboard sign that asks customers not to take photos or video inside and I have to wonder if that's in part to the mess of boxes and miscellaneous piled up everywhere. For real, they have both a door and a door mat made out of leftover cardboard. It was just kind of strange to see a business that has upwards of an hour-long line from open to close that won't spend $10 on a doormat that isn't made out of garbage.", "author": "Candice G."}

The line itself was not long (it should have taken 30 mins to 45 mins tops), but we somehow waited 1 and a half hours. The line stopped moving all together for about 30 mins, with no explanation. They allowed people to order unlimited amounts of egg tarts when they should have capped it at 4-5 per party. Not once did any employee come out to check on the customers who were in line and to let them know of the wait time and what they were getting themselves into. We finally made it to the door, and there was no \"apologies for the long wait,\" nothing like that. The egg tart was good, but it was not worth an hour and a half wait. \n\nIf I was a resident of San Francisco, I would feel compelled to further protest their business model, but since I'm a tourist (like most of their clientele), the only thing I can do is leave a Yelp review which probably further emboldens them to continue this practice.", "author": "Travis H."}

Golden Gate Bakery hands down, makes some of the best egg tarts in the bay area, if not the best. \n\nFirst off, this place is not open every day, not really sure how people find out of their store hours but I guess you can go by every day to see if they're open. If you do get lucky to find that they are open, I hope you have the patience to wait in line for at least 45-1 hour for their delicious baked goods.\n\nMy group waited for 1 hour 45 minutes for some delicious egg tarts, as we went during a popular time of the year, Lunar New Year. People were buying these things by the dozens, at one point we saw a lady leave with 6 dozens of these bad boys. However, despite the wait, I thought they were very efficient and the two ladies manning the front lines were experts at their craft. \n\nWhen it was finally our turn my group each ordered a dozen, and the tarts were pipping hot as they come out fresh every 2 minutes, seriously. A dozen cost about 24$ and if you buy them as singles they are roughly $2 each (CASH ONLY). Seems pretty steep for some egg tarts right? Trust me they are so worth, the egg tarts are pretty generous in size and so is the egg filling. The tart crust was so flaky and fresh (my personal favorite part of the desert). \n\nI brought some home to share with my family, and even though it wasn't fresh by that time, after re-heating in the toaster for a few minutes, it tasted just as it would when it first came out of the oven. \n\nIs it worth the wait? Most definitely!! Something worth trying at least once. The bakery also sells a variety of different goods, haven't personally tried them but they all look delicious as well. \n\n5/5", "author": "Thy B."}

Two Christmases in a row I happen to catch the bakery open as I was told that they are notorious for closing down at any given time without warning? and that they usually have no set schedule when they're open... well, I have not seen that happen to me yet and maybe it's true what they say or not but I'll just consider myself fortunate that they were open the times I visit. \n\nLast Christmas [2015] I didn't stop here because the line was ridiculously long! This year, though, I made it a point to check it out. Stood in line and it was nice that the line, although a bit long, went pretty quick and before we knew it we were already inside (we were having a nice conversation with another patron from out of town)! I thought we were already coming from pretty far (Roseville) but this guy we were in line with came from Chicago! (and he said he just found this place through Yelp) LoL! WTG, Yelp! \n\nThe selection was pretty much low at around 6:30p but I really just wanted to try some of the recommended goodies from my other Yelp friends which was the egg tarts and moon cake. I bought a few egg tarts, they were freshly made still very warm and soft. They are $1.95 each. I thought it had a somewhat similar taste to our Filipino custard pie dessert from Goldilocks. Am I right, kababayans? Also, I bought one moon cake, I'm not sure which flavor we got but it was yummy also. I thought it had a similar taste to one of our Filipino pastries as well but I can't seem to pinpoint what it is. I would've loved it if they didn't ran out of the sesame balls. That is one of my faves... and, yes, we have that in a Filipino bakery too. \n\nI'm glad I got a chance to experience this bakery's treats. Now I understand why they always have such a long line every time I come here but this is a one time visit for me. I'm sure there are more Chinese bakeries offering just as good treats for cheaper (heck, Filipino bakeries offer similar baked goods also) but now I can say that I've tried this bakery. No seating inside, once you get inside it is immediately the display windows of their baked treats (or what's left of it for the day) and you just tell the ladies behind the counter what you want. Oh, and one more thing! CASH ONLY! Lucky for me, I bank with Chase and there is a Chase bank across the street. \n\nP.S. Read some of the Not Recommended reviews.

I have read other reviews saying that this place is rarely open as well but both times I've been here, it's been open. The interior layout of this bakery is really small and inefficient; the back area looks super messy w huge piles of boxes, papers, etc. It sort of makes me wonder how they manage to keep everything in order or if they even do, as their cash register is super old and there's a huge mess around the register as well -- do they even count all the money & make sure everything balances along with their inventory? They don't even really have receipts or anything. Aside from that, the baked goods are pretty good. Many people say that the egg tarts here are to die for; I wouldn't necessarily agree that they're the best egg tarts out there, but they're pretty damn good. The crust is super flaky and they give a generous amount of filling -- they definitely don't skimp. I also tried the sesame balls with red bean paste filling and that was pretty good as well.

If only I too could go on vacation as often as the owners of Golden Gate Bakery. This place randomly shuts down for literally months on end. In fact, their schedule is so notoriously erratic that there is a website solely dedicated to monitoring it. Here you go: http://www.is-the-golden-gate-bakery-open-today.com/\n\nOn the off chance that you are able to catch them open, prepare yourself for a test of patience. Do you see the line of people that wraps down the street and stretches all the way back up? Yep, get queueing!\n\n// Egg Tart - 4 stars\nGolden Gate Bakery's signature pastry comes with a generous amount of custard and a perfectly flaky crust. It has more of an egg-dominant flavor rather than a sweet one. Definitely comparable to the versions I've had in Hong Kong, but I wouldn't call it better. Personally, I still prefer Portuguese egg tarts much more.\n\n// Sesame Ball - 2 stars\nI was so excited to purchase the most giant sesame ball I've ever seen. However, opening this sucker up was a huge let down as there was barely any red bean in it. \n\n// White Lotus Seed Paste Moon Cake - 4 stars\nI really enjoyed this traditional moon cake! Wonderful flavors and smooth textures all throughout. If you've never had moon cakes before, this is a great classic option.\n\n// Black Bean Moon Cake - 3 stars\nNot sure I've heard of a black bean moon cake before, but it tasted just like red bean to me. In any case, the texture of this one was a little too chunky for my liking. \n\n// Strawberry Pie - 3 stars\nThe filling was mixed with strawberry flavored bits which added a nice crunch.

The line started to build up a lot after we got in the line. \n\nSo the wait wasn't bad and when it was finally our turn, we found out why it was taking a shit ton of time. People ordered boxes and dozens of these and it takes time for them to pack all of the egg tarts. The ladies here were super nice and cute. They were friendly and quick with the service. We ordered 4 egg tarts and we wanted to order something else since we were in line so long already. We then got the white sponge cake (the literal Chinese English translation of this cake is \"white sugar cake\"). \n\nEggtart was just AMAZING!!! Now I know why I was really never into egg tarts at dim sum restaurants. I just never had the good one! The crust was super flaky and crispy and the egg custard was super soft and smooth. I loved how it was still warm because it was fresh out of the oven. I had to have another one after the first one. Now I regretted not getting more for myself!

There's not much advice that can be given or suggestions to be made. If Chinese baked desserts interest you, you would already know or have heard about it.\n\nGold Gate Bakery has had a solid following in the local Asian-American community since for-fucking-ever. On one end of Chinatown, they are going to have lines out their doors no matter what happens. I live in San Jose, and there is a solid community here of people who specifically love Golden Gate Bakery's egg custard tarts. The goddamn Cult of Golden Gate Bakery Egg Tarts is a real thing here. Whenever we stop by San Francisco, no matter what group I'm with, we ALWAYS STOP HERE. I get LOOKS if I so much as insinuate we do otherwise. At this point, their slitted, pink donut boxes are pretty recognizable. Even if you don't know WHEN they're open, if you're walking down Chinatown, you know IF they're open because there is a smattering of people walking down the street with one or four of those boxes. This is convenient when you need an impressive mooncake for the Mid-Autumn/Chinese Moon Festival. They sell those too, and it always impresses the traditional, Chines families.\n\nThe process entails this: Get in line, wait anywhere from 45 to 65 minutes (an hour and five minutes has happened to us before), order at the counter, they'll box it up for you and slit them so that the heat doesn't make the tarts or pastries soggy, pay in cash, and shoulder your way back out on the sidewalk.\n\nI know this routine as well as anybody else. When my family goes to San Francisco, we're expected to buy 2 to 3 dozen egg tarts to bring back and redistribute among friends and family in San Jose. We have being doing this for as long as I can remember, which means at least over a decade . From these experience, I can only give you one piece of advice...:\n\nSend the dispensable family members/friends. Give them some money, go about your business, and have that one or two friends/family wait in that hour long line. It's brutal and selfish, but only one truly needs to be sacrificed (and in my family, it's me or my brother).\n\n......\n\nThis has got to be one of the shortest reviews I've ever written, and it's about sacrificing family members and friends to your food cravings.

You cannot categorize this with all the plebeian tarts of the world.  This tart is in a league of its own.  It is the supreme epitome... if this were the bar... no other tart deserves to be called a tart.  You will not be able to imagine the ecstasy that is this egg tart unless you commit yourself to the 45 minute line that is always in front of that door... you must bite into a piping hot tart right out of the oven to understand why people are willing to withstand that long line for a $1.95 egg tart?\n\nThis could become a dangerous addiction if the recipe got out.  The owners of the bakery mysteriously disappear for months at a time every year.  Are they going on vacation to enjoy the fruits of their yearlong labor?  I don't think so... I think they are traveling to the deepest highest mountain temple of China... to train... to meditate... to practice the ancient art... of tart.

Located in the Chinatown of SF but the first thing I noticed was this shop is the only one that has a long line outside the door. I went to the line while my friend was shopping something else, and it was not long at all I would say around 20-25 minutes.\nBought a couple of dozens for $27/ each dozen and per piece was $2.25 and left home. When I got home and tried I CAN NOT STOP, it was so good. The filling is not too sweet, moist, I can taste the egg but not too \"eggy\", the crust is crusty and perfect. A man behind me waited for the same time and only ordered 1 egg tart, he must have lived nearby and just craving for it. If I live closeby I'd do the same thing too.\nYummmm!", "author": "Stephany S."}

All yelpers raved about this bakery's egg tart. As a true fan of egg tarts, I had to try it. We waited in line for 30 minutes and we were literally the 60th or so people from the front of the line and hundreds more after us. Egg tarts practically all tastes the same (seriously, i have ordered them from Paris Baguette, 85 Bakery, Shengkee, you name it!) but GGB is A-perfection! Fresh out of the over (burnt my tongue - I was so excited to taste it), their egg tarts so smooth and slightly sweet with perfect crust - so flaky and crips! I also had it the next day and still tasted so fresh and delicious - unlike other egg tarts (the next day, it's eeeeehhh, OK). I noticed people ordered by the dozens so they kept bringing out new fresh batches of egg tarts one tray after the other. It's the best one I've ever had. If you have had egg tarts from different places like I have, you will know the difference. \n\nOther great bakery goods that I highly recommend: Coconut Muffins (SO GOOD!!) and their Lotos pancakes (well, that's what I call it.) It so delicious. It has lotus filling inside. Let's just put it this way: If you love Chinese baked goods, GGB is the place for you! \n\nWe were fortunate to be in the area while this place was open because from the chatter amongst the people standing in line, this Bakery has weird hours. They are only open maybe 3-4 a week and on random hours too. It's a hit or miss. Business hours is unreliable! Also, be prepared to order right away - know what you want because the staff will rush you to order to keep the line going fast. HAHA. Just smile through it.", "author": "Rodalyn C."}

I think it was because it was Chinese New Year month because they blocked off a lot of the street so you have to park outside of chinatown and walk in. Waited an hour in line because so many people before ordered dozens of egg tarts which was annoying but when I finally got it. That bite into the egg tart reminded me how heavenly these bad boys were. What I like about these egg tarts is that the crust is light and flakey but not too flakey where it falls apart and the custard is creamy yet firm and it doesn't taste too eggy.\n\nI also like getting their coconut macaroons, I really wanted only one but you are required to buy at least 6. The coconut tart is also good, it's different from the macaroon as the tart has grounded coconut to where as the macaroons are shredded.  Delicious goodies and I usually leave with all 3 and you should to.", "author": "Andrew T."}

This place has been here for years. I remember stopping by with my parents when I was a kid every time we would visit SF for the day. I never ate it as a kid and I deeply regretted that decision as an adult. These golden beautiful yellow delicious egg tarts are heaven sent.  The line you see wrapping around the block. Don't sweat it just get in line. You'll thank me later after you inhale 4 or 5 walking back to your car. Everything is piping hot and fresh out the oven.  I'm don't eat egg tarts anywhere else because nothing matches up to the taste of these. They are perfect mix of creamy, sweet and eggy with a flaky golden crust. They are kind of expensive now from back then but SF in general is an expensive place. I believe each runs for about 2.50 each. Only downfall about this place is they randomly are closed for weeks at a time, my only suggestion before hitting up Chinatown and trying to find parking just to walk over there to find it close and your heart broken is to just call them first. If they don't pick up once call again. If they don't pick up the second time. They are probably closed and on vacation. But seriously no trip to SF Chinatown will be complete without making a trip here and buying at least a dozen to bring home.\n\nPro tip: refrigerate when you get home.

I also got one of the red bean sesame balls and those were delicious, the outside was crispy and good and not too drenched in oil. A con of that was that the red bean filling barely existed but it was good. A pro is that when you get it they are still warm and that makes the experience more mouth watering.

The insides were always too eggy and the texture bothered me. The only saving grace was the crust and even then I was only meh about it. But guys, absolutely 100% would come here again even with the hour long mid weekday line. The egg tarts were phenomenal. I've never had anything like it! The egg custard was less eggy and more like a pudding texture and since it was freshly baked it was still warm and creamy. The crust was thicker than a typical dim sum egg tart but was also flaky and buttery and reminded me of a thicker and more crusty version of a croissant. We ordered a dozen for our coworkers but man I wish I had ordered more. \n\nCash only and be wary of coming up here during holidays and the summer since they shut down for months at a time it seems like.

It was always either too sweet or too egg-y. Like why. When I came to SF this was raved about, but me and my sister just kind of shrugged it off. We both love food but didn't like egg tarts. While getting dimsum at another store we happened to be in the area. There was no line (which was a freak of nature) and I think it so was the world's way of luring us in otherwise we wouldn't have bothered. So yes we went in and bought two. We each took a bite and our eyes widened and we both said \"wow\". \n\nBy the time we finished our two egg tarts, we knew we wanted to buy more... alot more. When you watch other people they buy these tarts by the BOXFULL. We thought it was weird till we ate it and wanted to do the exact same thing. In those couple of minutes a line had formed so we did go right back in but had to wait in line, which normally there always is a line or so I've read. We bought a ton more and enjoyed it the rest of our stay in SF. We ate a ton of new and awesome food while we visited but these egg tarts stick out the most in my mind. \n\nSo, moral of this story is to try these egg tarts no matter what. It's a Must! \n\nEXPERIENCE\nAfter the first time we went there was always a line so be prepared to stand in one. But the line does move fast.\n\nI'm Asian but not Chinese so it's always a little intimidating going to a full on Chinatown establishment. But it wasn't too bad here.

Yes, it also has the best name for an establishment.  It has become so popular that it became a tourist attraction.  All for what?  Yes, an egg tart!  \nThe crust is soft and crispy and totally melts in your mouth.

A guy on the street told us they have the best egg tarts in all of San Francisco. So we decided to stop and wait on line the other day.\n\nTo start off, we aren't familiar with this delicacy - so to be fair, we have nothing to compare to. Also, we were born and raised in the US so I suppose we are accustomed to sweeter treats. \n\nThat all being said, we found the Golden Gate egg tart to be pretty nasty. We got one to share RIGHT out of the oven (scorched my tongue) and all we tasted was scrambled egg with an extremely small hint of sweetness from the crust. If that is what they are supposed to taste like then you will love them. Judging by all of the positive reviews, it might be.\n\nI also bought a banana rice roll. The texture (from the rice flour) was gum-like and mushy. I found it to be oddly satisfying. Although, the flavor was extremely artificial. I can assure you that no real bananas were used to make this dessert. It tasted like candy.\n\nOverall, the prices seemed fair, the customer service was pretty good, the place seemed like it was in violation of some health codes, the wait was probably about a half hour long, and the baked goods were terrible. We will not be returning to this bakery.", "author": "Danielle P."}

But when you speak English thank you this and that. \n.\nKnown for egg tarts. They have a crazy line which is usually 30 mins to 1 hr wait or more. The egg tart is good when it is served piping hot. Suppposingly best in SF.  But doesn't leave me wanting more, if short line i will wait if long line i pass. \n.\nCurry turn overs is my fav here. The curry is not too strong has corn and bellpepper inside. Moist and juicy in the inside. Flakey on the outside. \n.\nMoon cake is like 10 bucks each. My fav is the white lotus seed with egg yolk. But to figure out the egg yolk is not really great. Why? When you had better ones, where the eggyolk leaks out oil those are the good ones. This egg yolk was dry. But the lotus seed really taste quality. Overall i think i will pass next time on the moon cakes. Just surprises me how people buy 6 boxes with 4 inside basically 40 bucks a box. Wow.... making bank! \n.\nOverall prepare to wait. If your visiting come visit and just say you have been to a known place.

Right before they open and sometimes the line dies in between 4pm - closing. But once people line up, everyone follows. \n\nThe shop is small, I think maybe enough for 5 people at a time and usually 2 - 3 ladies to help with orders. CASH ONLY. If you're gonna complain, go somewhere else. The ladies are quick, don't expect them to treat you like you're super important. They'll take your order and give you what you ordered as fast as they can because they have a ton of people to get through. They don't have time to ask how your day is, have you been here before, etc. So be ready with your order once they call for you. Prices have been increasing, but guess what, so has their rent I'm sure and ingredients to make all their wonderful pastries. SF is extremely expensive, and to me their egg tarts are worth it.\n\nNow the egg tarts themselves. Perfect. The egg custard is amazing. Super soft, blended really well and still tastes fresh the next day (put in a toaster oven to warm back up). The \"crust\" is very flakey and crisp, but moist in the middle. Again, perfect. Believe me, I've tried many different egg tarts. Even did a blind taste test because people didn't believe it was that good. I always choose GGB. Nothing comes close. \n\n**Just a warning to those who don't know, the shop to the right of the bakery is VERY irritated by the bakery's customers blocking their shop so watch where you line up. Either line up to the left or split the line once it ends at bakery end and continue the line where the meters are for parking.", "author": "Lucy N."}

Cannot understand the demand for the egg tarts. While placing our order the owner/employee answered the phone but quickly grew tired of answering questions about store hours or if they'd be open tomorrow.  The owner/employee literally said \"I'm too busy to talk\" and then hung up on the person. It was comical at the same time rude customer service. At least we experienced it once and know not to bother coming back again.  The custard of the egg tart was too sweet and nothing extraordinary.

What makes them worth $2.25 each? Here goes (not in any particular order):\n\n1) these actually are about 1.5x larger than others I've had in the Bay Area. \n2) the crust... super flaky, almost like a croissant. This is not your average Safeway store bought crust. I've never experienced crust like this except perhaps my grandmas pie crust from back in the day. This actually is I think possibly even better.\n3) the egg filling... not too sweet. Super fresh. A simple taste that is only possible when you use just a few ingredients and no preservatives. When you bite, you first taste egg, almost like an omelette. But keep tasting and you taste a milky/cream taste. Don't swallow yet. Swirl it one last time over the tongue and you will barely taste a hint, just a slight hint of sugar. In a world full of overly sweetened baked goods I am a huge fan of bakeries that  are capable of exercising some self control when it comes to adding this nearly toxic ingredient (sugar). It's needed for sure to complete the flavor profile of these, but I'm very thankful this bakery has determined the exact quantity required for this recipe.\n\nWe got our 18 tarts warm... really actually hot and slightly jiggly in the center. We ate  one of them immediately nearly burning our mouth. I recommend eating them this way whenever possible, but they were still quite yummy several hours later once they had completely cooled. Do yourself a favor. Stand in the line. Try it for once in your life! Then you be the judge.", "author": "Chrys K."}

How about that!\n\nFor those of you who do not know, Golden Gate Bakery is known for their famous egg tarts. People in the food and Yelp community will rave about how good their egg tarts are. At the same time, they'll also cry over how impossible it is to actually try the stuff at Golden Gate Bakery. For this shop is only open once in a blue moon - there's a website devoted to notifying you when it's open here http://www.is-the-golden-gate-bakery-open-today.com (doesn't work anymore though?)! And, if you do catch this place while it's open, be prepared to wait a LONG TIME. \n\nI decided to drag my girlfriend to Chinatown in hopes of being the lucky few that catch Golden Gate Bakery while it is open. I had a good feeling, since some of my good Yelp friends spotted it open for business weeks ago. And low and behold! On Sunday, April 2nd, Golden Gate Bakery was open, alive, and well. After finally finding parking at a parking structure (I gave up...), we made it to the end of the line. \n\nTo be honest, I thought there would be an insane line that wrapped around the street for these egg tarts, but there was a much smaller line out the door. Don't be deceived though because customers will take FOREVER to order. Since this place is only open once in a lifetime, people will try to buy everything. It took us maybe 30-40 minutes to finally reach the front. And although we were scared they'd run out of egg tarts, we ordered two fresh ones. \n\nAnd how were these egg tarts? Let's just end my review here and say that they were \"Omg, I'd drive two hours for this\" good! For $1.95 each, you get a GIANT piece of egg tart that is smoking hot. Have some napkins/gloves ready because these things are hot, hot, hot. After letting it cool a bit, we chomped down into a delicious, flaky, and soft egg tart. It was definitely the best egg tart I have ever had. Unlike most egg tarts you get at Chinese togo shops or at dim sum restaurants, this one wasn't stale, it wasn't cold, nor was it rough to the taste. This was one smooth and soft. I loved it, and the only regrets I had were that we ate them too fast and that we didn't order more/anything else.\n\nGolden Gate Bakery is a must, even if it might take several tries to get in and wait in line. \n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

In fact, I tried my first one just last year and it was from a small forgettable bakery. I couldn't say if I liked it or not at the time so I simply forgot that egg tarts even existed. Fast forward a few months and we found ourselves in San Francisco. It was only by chance that we had just eaten lunch at a restaurant right across from Golden Gate Bakery and sheer luck that they were open at this time. The line intrigued us enough to walk over and wait for these little custard filled treats. Now, the line does move somewhat slow. The bakery is tiny and everyone is ordering these egg tarts and it looked like by the dozen. We waited about 45 minutes for our dozen. \n\nWe got them hot and tried one right away. This was my husband's first egg tart and he didn't really like the flavor of the tarts (no fault to the bakery, he just didn't like tasting eggs in a dessert form). I also admit that when I tried it hot, I didn't like it all that much. However, I tried it again after it had cooled down and I found the tart to be absolutely delightful. It was so soft, and the tart was just so flaky and it was absolutely delicious. The right amount of sweetness also and that custard was just so smooth and divine. I loved them.

Quite possibly. But with Yelp reviews this good, it was worth a try!\n\nThe 20ft line overall takes about 30-40min, so holding a bike in that time is rather awkward while old Asian ladies allure you to get a few extra egg tarts for them so they don't have to wait in line. I call it good karma, they probably call it \"young sucker who had to wait in line but I convinced him to get me my order for free\". Flip a coin, right?\n\nSo while waiting in line, there is a window display that shows off some other pastries, and by the halo effect, if their egg tarts are that good, then everything they make should be amazing too right? \n\nOf course, I have no idea what they're called other than \"sesame seed covered ball\" and \"crispy looking thing.\" I'm sure when you get there, you'll know exactly what I'm referring to.\n\n(Except if you're legit Asian. Then you probably know the actual names to these delicacies and are shaking your head in shame. Sorry I call it as it is.)\n\nIn the end, bring your cash and at least try the egg tarts! They are definitely really really good - just the right amount of sweetness and egg-iness to combine into a delectable treat!

One of my buddies was visiting and he told me he always wanted to go to Golden Gate Bakery (GGB) but could never go since GGB would always be on vacation. We had been walking along Grant Avenue, and by luck, the lights were on inside with just a few people waiting in line (all waiting for egg tarts, which were baking in the oven).\n\nSince my last review, egg tarts have gone up in price, from $1.60 to $1.95 per egg tart. Years ago, these egg tarts were less than a dollar each! Inflation? Tourist prices? Go figure. \n\nIs it worth the high price tag and wait? Sort of. The line can be pretty annoying but honestly, I haven't had egg tarts as good as the ones here elsewhere in San Francisco. The egg tart's crust is flakey and not too thick -- while the custard has a soft, milky, buttery, melt-in-your mouth texture that is absolutely amazing! I would probably recommend visiting GGB at off hours (like close to closing) than during peak hours (such as around lunch time). Visiting GGB during off hours to purchase your egg tarts will make your experience much more pleasant.\n\nEven though GGB is a tourist hot spot, it's also popular among locals like myself. If you haven't been here before, it's definitely worth a try. Come sooner than later, before they hike up the prices again.", "author": "Matthew L."}

My family has been getting egg tarts from here for as long as I can remember. What makes the egg tarts here so amazing is the perfect balance of soft egg-iness and sweetness in the center custard and the perfect flaky crust of the outside. The crust on the outside is like a croissant but still sturdy enough to hold the tart together. The egg tarts are a good size, about the size of my palm or maybe the diameter of a normal sized wine bottle. While $2.25 may seem expensive for an egg tart, it is definitely worth it. \n\nI came in recently while showing some of my SoCal friends around San Francisco on a Monday night. Even though it was about 6pm on a Monday night there was still a 15 minute wait - but don't be deterred the egg tarts are worth the wait. They make them continuously throughout the day so they're as fresh as can be. If you are making a big order, they may make you leave and come back to pick it up a little later (we came back in 30 minutes) but you can just leave and walk around Grant St while you wait. The two ladies running the shop are very nice and speak Cantonese and English. When ordering a whole box, they will cut out the corners of the top box to let out the steam from the fresh tarts to prevent the flaky crust from getting soggy. I usually order a box at a time and eat them as snacks over a day or two. As long as you keep them in air tight containers once cooled, they'll still be good to eat the next day. My friends that were visiting definitely loved this place and found themselves even craving the egg tarts from here towards the end of the trip.", "author": "Evelyn L."}

For today and for this place, I will call them DARN TART !\n\nWe drove by and saw a long line. My gal pal, Yuri, waited in her car, acting like she was going to pull into a space on the street around the corner. I ran to the shop to stand in line and made sure that I was in the correct line on the right side of the door. The people in front of me had called in their order, so I immediately called to place my order. The lady who answered the phone seemed preoccupied. I looked in the window and saw them boxing up some of the goods. Listening to the people in line, I learned that the shop is actually on vacation and they came in today to do a large special order. We were lucky that they were answering the phone and taking names. The lady at the door told us that they don't usually do this and not to tell others....so, shhhh... mum's the word!  (Wink, wink)  ;)\n\nSomehow, my phone call to her ended,  so I called again. I told her that my name was \"Luk\" and used the best Chinese accent that I had. I told her I just spoke with her and she had asked me how many I wanted. She asked me for what time. When I said, \"now\", she said that I would have to wait. I said. \"Yeah, yeah! (Using my assertive Chinese accent)\". She agreed to a 1:30pm pick up. (20 minutes). (I win)\n\nShe came to the door and filled a couple of orders then pointed to me.  I knew what she wanted.  I told her that I just spoke to her. She said, \"I told you wait\"!  I replied, \"I am!\"  Then she nodded (understanding that she is speaking to another Chinese woman) and directed me to the other line on the left side of the door. (I win)\n\nI'm not the rudest Chinese woman on this earth, but I know that game.  When you try to cut in line and speak Chinese... hey!  I'm not deaf!  So I had to speak (in my loud Chinese accent) that I was here first.  That woman behind me was smart. ..she backed off!  (I win)  Plus, the lady at the door saw my $21 cash in my hand so she took it. (That's a good sign that I'm getting closer to my goal!)\n\nFinally, she came back with a pink box!  It was tied with white plastic string and 2 corners of the box were cut open to vent the steam. ..nice!  She placed the box in my hands and I carried my trophy to the car!  We brought our gift to my cousin's house where we relayed this tale of victory and glory!  (We win!)\n\nConclusion: is it worth all of the hassle? Definitely! The crust is on the thinner, crisper side. The custard is moist and \"just right\" sweet. These egg tarts are on the larger side and better quality, so they cost a bit more. However, it's better to consume them while they are fresh and warm...  So good!  \n\nIf you need help,  just bring me with you...hahaha!  It's fun!  I promise not to hurt anyone. ..

The concept is much smaller, but it has the natural, classic modern design inside despite the plain blue background.\n\nThe employees and bakers are doing an excellent job here for making the customers like me especially my parents a friendly service! No cons at all!\n\nAs I mentioned earlier for the Egg Tart, that Tart as I ate tasted outstandingly good! It's flaky and eatable to chew! Much flavorful than any Chinese bakeries here! Besides the Egg Tart, I tasted the plain buns too, and it tasted not bad after my first bite! What a great dessert or snack meal!\n\nParking can be difficult to park, you can park at the nearest surface street parking nor the garage if it's available. Otherwise, you can ride a bike, walk, or use public transportation easier without the hassles.\n\nSometimes, this bakery has vacation offs during the spring break, summer break, Thanksgiving break, and Christmas break especially Chinese New Years, so be aware to avoid these holiday peek by going to non holiday peek times as possible.\n\nIn the end, Golden Gate Bakery is the most outstanding local Chinese bakery right in the heart of San Francisco's Chinatown. A well, worthy visit! My rating: 4 solid stars!", "author": "William L."}

First time here, but I've had plenty of egg tarts in the past, and none comes close in comparison. This is basically a commentary of the journey to the egg tart, so skip everything and scroll to the bottom for the actual food review haha. But I feel like the journey is the important part to the destination, so read on if you please XD\n\nWe came here on a Saturday night around 6:15pm and spent over an hour waiting in line for these famed egg tarts. Made it just in time before they closed!I mean, we had to see what all the fuss was about XD It was kind of funny (but not really) because the egg tarts came out and semi-constant intervals (i.e. 10-15 minutes for a batch of a few dozen), and so this was the rate and frequency at which the line moved. And then when the person at the front of the line bought like all of them (a few dozen), everybody in the line would stare down the person coming out and be like, \"What is that girl/guy gonna do with 2 boxes of egg tarts??\" Of course there is no system where 1 person can only buy max 1 dozen - it's a group of Chinese grandmas running the show, I'm thinking probably cash only? At least I assume so (and the grandpa sitting in the chair behind the counter snoring haha).\n\nThere felt like some kind of camaraderie while waiting in line haha. Sadly, the people in front of us waited just under an hour and then ended up leaving (why??) and we got our egg tarts soon after. Also another sadly is that one guy with his wife (and baby) who was near the back of the line asked another lady 1-2 people in front of us to buy egg tarts for him. We should have given him a bigger death stare down or like really smh because dude, we're all waiting here. If everybody tries to get somebody in front of them to pay for them to get egg tarts, then there's no point of a line, and nobody lining up will ever get egg tarts! Gotta think Kantian ethics and categorical imperatives here. Actually if I cared enough (or had big enough balls) I might have said something just to prove a point/teach a lesson, but oh wells we were so close to getting our egg tarts that I was like EGG TARTSSSSS more than anything haha.\n\nAnyways, on to happier times. If you look at the face of whoever is at the front, there's always a huge grin on their faces, with excitement at the golden treasures that lie within the pink boxes, and that's precisely how we felt when we placed our order :D\n\nEnough with the commentary. On to the food review. I could honestly just leave it as the egg tarts were darn good.\n\n- Egg tarts: so delicious, you really need to try them for yourself!! I've never had an egg tart with such perfect balance: gooey egg filling (plus it was hot/warm, having just come out of the oven) and a flaky but not super oily crust. I'm definitely coming back again :D 10/10 would wait again. Ok well, waiting always kind of sucks, but it was totally worth it hehe.", "author": "Joanna C."}

Finally we make it inside the store but there is at least 10 people in front of us. It starts to get crazy because they can't make the egg tarts fast enough and they were waiting for a fresh batch. People outside get angry. It gets chaotic. Our uber arrives and my group tries to stall. The uber driver says he'd wait if we got him one. \n\nMore time passes and the ladies up front are yelling to the guys baking it. It's hectic. I finally say, ok just give me some moon cakes and let me get the heck out of here!

However, I think their poor service and lack of customer appreciation is a big stinker.  During my visit to SF earlier this year, I came here only to be disappointed with the big sign on the door that they're on vacation.  I've read on numerous Yelp reviews that they randomly close and are on \"vacation\".   Throughout my stay, I did call them and no one picked up so I didn't bother going again.  On my most recent trip to SF, I called them as soon as we landed and they picked up.  I asked what time they're open till and the lady promptly said 8 PM.  She didn't say anything else.  They were our first stop from the airport and guess what?!  They were closed!!!  I saw staff working in the shop but the sign on the door said they wouldn't open until 2 PM.  I was so pissed off.  Was it too much to ask for her to have told me they're open from 2-8 PM that day while we were on the phone?  Uggggh.  \n\nI honestly didn't think we were going to get any egg tarts but the hubs reminded me that we were in the city and we should try one more time.  Off we went and of course there was an insane line.  Damn, why do they have to be so good???  Flaky buttery crust that kinda falls apart when you eat them.  Or maybe it's because I'm a fattie and couldn't wait for them to cool down a bit.  The custard is light yellow, jiggly, not overly sweet and melts in your mouth!  I scarfed down three in an hour.  \n\nThe staff isn't the most helpful/friendly but I'm sure it helped that I spoke chinese.  I believe they allow you to order a certain amount of egg tarts due to the high demand.  When it was my turn to order, the lady asked me how many people was in my party.  Since it was me and the hubby, she allowed me to order a dozen.  \n\nTips:\n-Call in advance and ask them what time they're open and what time they're closed!\n-Pretty sure it's only a dozen per person.

Golden custard and crispy and buttery crusts melt in your mouth after every bite and before you know it you'll have had 3 in one sitting.\nThe size of these bad puppies hasn't changed since it's opening which is note worthy in itself. While other bakeries' dan tats in Chinatown have become minuscule over the years, Golden Gate has stayed consistent large and in charge. Roughly the size of coasters, these dan tats will fill you up.\nWhile the wait (10-15 mins) can be a bit daunting sometimes, know that the bakery isn't consistently open seasonally and that the wait is beyond worth it! \nAs an Angeleno that has pilgrimaged up to this Bakery on an annual basis for my entire life, I hope to bring my own kids one day! \nThank you Golden Gate Bakery!!", "author": "Kelli W."}

He dropped me off to get in line/pick up some egg tarts that he loves and talked about a few times since we started dating. I was so confused and When I walked to the place with a sign on the door \"we will be closed for 2 days\" there were 3 people standing by the door so I asked them if they're really closed; luckily the lady told me to just wait in line and they'll take my order. \n\nFinally, I got the six egg tarts for a little over $10; the egg tarts were fresh!

I don't want to outdate myself, but I would say 25+ years ago whenever we made a family trip up to the Bay Area. This particular bakery is located in the old Chinatown of San Francisco.\n\nI have never known until the last time I came here that there was such a long line of people outside waiting to buy their pastries.  We must have waiting a hour before we finally got in to order the pastries.\n\nI must admit that they make delicious \"Don Tats\" or egg custards. It's basically battered egg poured and  baked in a small round crust which is simply delicious! The concept seems simple, but I'm quite sure there's a lot of work behind it.  \n\nThey also make delicious coconut puffs... which is similar to the American rice crispies. It's the same simple concept, and the preparation is also similar to rice crispies. Again, delicious!\n\nThey sell other baked goods such as pound cakes, bread buns, and baos.  Whatever is purchased depends on the quantity will either be bagged or boxed in the traditional pink Dim Sum box and tied. It brings back so many childhood memories just by looking at the pink box reminiscing how I use to open up the boxes and just smell the aroma when my parents use to buy dim sum.\n\nThis bakery has been around for a long time. As you peak in the store, everything looks the same... the floors, walls, display cases, etc. Only the strings used to tie the boxes has changed into the more flimsy kind instead of using red string. \n\nI like this place, but never realized it has become so popular. The Chinese ladies working inside are nice, especially when you speak the same Chinese dialect. Yes, you'll get shoved a few times by an older lady who does not believe in lines. But nobody in line waiting complains knowing that they're elders.\n\nAnyhow, great memories here and I wish Golden Gate Bakery the best.", "author": "ED L."}

The custard was extremely tasty, not too sweet, but just right. However, the texture of it was a bit thicker than I'd like and on the egg-y side. Overall, the egg tart was great. Warm and tasty, but I wouldn't stand in the long line for just one. I also had the vanilla sponge cake, which to be completely honest, I loved a lot more than the egg tart, but that is just personal preference. The texture was exactly what a sponge cake should be like... soft and spongy, melts on your tongue delicious-ness! The vanilla filling is buttery, sweet and naturally tasty. If you're going to stand in line, buy a few dozen egg tarts or try out some of the other items on the menu, everything is pretty tasty. \n\nCustomer Service: Fast, friendly and efficient. The woman that helped me clearly knew I was new to the establishment and she made some recommendations right off the bat.  I will mention the weird vacation sign that I posted a photo of, which apparently isn't uncommon. Their business model is quite confusing, but it is after all their business. I'd recommend that you give them a ring before investing your precious time in coming here and then having to go home empty handed.\n\nAmbiance: Very busy, long lines, crowded storefront. Nowhere to eat your pastries, maybe that's what the corner opening in the box is for... on-the-go consumption!\n\nPrice: Reasonable, but on a steady incline from what I've read.\n\n\nOverall: Good egg tarts and other pastries, prices are okay, but the wait isn't too pretty.

I don't know what luck dawned on me that wondrous day I road-tripped to SF during finals week from San Diego. It was my first time going to GG Bakery, and to my surprise, it was OPEN and there was NO LINE. Sorcery, right? I could barely believe my eyes as I squealed and entered the bakery. I kid you not, my hands were shaking from excitement. \n\nThese egg tarts are a bit pricey and it was ~20$ for a dozen, but IT IS SO WORTH IT. And I would do it again.\n\nWhat makes these egg tarts different from all the other SF egg tarts? Every. thing. First of all, they're warm. So warm, it's like they literally just came out of the oven. Secondly, they're so flaky and crispy, but just so enough that it doesn't taste like you're eating a slice of butter. Thirdly, the filling to crust proportion is perfection. When I buy an egg tart, I want the eggy part! I don't want to be eating a bunch of crust! Lastly, and probably most importantly, the egg tart itself. It's creamy, yet firm. Almost flan-like, but solid enough to not be pudding. \n\nThese egg tarts are literally melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. 10/10 would go back again. (and I'd probably buy like 2 dozen next time :D)", "author": "Andrea K."}

The store layout looks very cramped and inefficient. They really need to clean the place out to make room for a better bakery and maximize profits. I'm sure they lose some business from the long wait.\n\nBut the dan tas are the best you'll get in the U.S. I love how they're always hot when you first get them. And the egg custard to crust ratio is 9:1. Not very standard for most egg tarts and very difficult to make since the crust will most likely fall apart. Although it's thin, the crust is probably the best part! It's always perfectly flakey and baked to a nice dark brown color.\n\nI would definitely go back on a weekday when it's not as crowded.", "author": "Jia-Wen H."}

But when I was walking through Chinatown recently, it was open (and had a long line out the door), so I just had to jump on the chance to get some pastries! After waiting a good 45 minutes (and getting lots of questions about the line from curious tourists), we finally stepped out with a box of fresh, hot egg tarts along with a few other things (but let's be honest--the egg tarts are the reason to come!). They were still warm as we took them out of the store (and the nice ladies even cut a hole in the corner of the classic pink box to let the steam out--the signature mark of a box of pastries from Golden Gate!). I couldn't help but take a bite right away and nearly got burned! But these were delicious egg tarts--some of the best I've tried! The custard mixture is lightly sweet, creamy, and moist, and the tart is particularly flaky and crispy. Delicious and definitely worth a try! Just be prepared to wait and pay up--the tarts don't come cheap at $1.95 a pop.", "author": "David K."}

And this place is not always open or hours are inconsistent. Luckily, all but one time, this place has been open when I've stumbled through.\n\nThe storefront is pretty small and can only fit a handful of people inside. You need to know what you want to order before you get in because this is a hustle and bustle type of place. Don't hold up the line by trying to figure out what you want and asking hella questions. Also, if its the end of the night and theyre taking orders for how many dan tats you want, don't argue with the ladies saying you want more than what they can offer to make sure everyone has enough. I'm sure they don't care how far you drove for it (no offense).\n\nFor all the reviews complaining about customer service (which are the only negatives you'll see in the non 5-star reviews other than the inconsistent hours), you need to understand the kind of establishment this is. This is not their priority and even if you try to knock 'em on yelp, they have a loyal enough fan base that this will not affect them or compel them to change their ways.

After years of hearing so much about this holy grail of a tart, I set out on a serious mission in search of it in the midst of Chinatown. \n\nI call this: Operation Egg Tart\n\nNow, from many people, I've heard so many stories of how Golden Gate Bakery is always closed or the hideous lines that snake around the block. So, in order for me to combat some of these perils, I decided to do a bit of research to ensure my mission. \n\nGoogle, duh. \n\nI Googled their location and hours which stated that they were open every day from 8am to 8pm. I thought to myself, \"Why was everyone having such a hard time?\" These are like prime hours, even for those who have to rush after work to get these coveted bites. \n\nSo I drove to Chinatown to attempt my first bite of these famous tarts. Anyone who has been to Chinatown definitely knows that parking anywhere in or near this area can be a beast. BUT, I did manage to find a discreet metered spot just around the corner. \n\nThe stage was set... A cold, gloomy day, a tad windy with a slight drizzle of rain throughout. The streets were crowded with people with open umbrellas. I slipped through the streets with strong intention. Even in the dampened air, I caught a whiff of sweet smelling breads baking. As I looked up, I suddenly caught sight of the storefront. \n\nAs I hurried to the doors, I noticed that the bakery itself had gated windows, door shut, lights dim. There was even a sign out front that said they were out for vacation. I began to hang my head thinking that I too have failed this mission. \n\nI kept my eye on the store with a longing heart as I stood under a canopy of another store. Then ever so carefully, a man dressed in a suit approached the door and knocked. An older Chinese woman appeared at the door and stuck her head out. The man stated something in Cantonese and handed her money. She then closed the door and soon reappeared with a few pink boxes. \n\nOh M Gee\n\nI sprang to the door before she was able to close it. She then looked at me and simply stated, \"How many would you like?\"\n\nSo excited, I could hardly get the words out. \"I would like a dozen egg tarts, please.\" She then replied, \"OK, $21 cash only.\"\n\nCash? Noooooo! I only had my credit card in hand. I have come too far to fail now. I quickly looked around in a panic and noticed Chase Bank ATMs directly across the street. Oh how the stars have aligned for me that day.\n\nEureka!\n\nIn ninja like action, I was at the ATM and back across the street in an instant. Thankfully I had an extra dollar in my pocket and happily forked over the $21 bucks.\n\nI couldn't wait another minute. I quickly opened the box, snapped a quick photo (you guys know what's up), and bit right into the prized tart. \n\nSweet mother of dandelions! It was everything I had hoped for and more.

I've learned to take a zen approach to this--never seek out GGB, let it seek you. Rather than making the mistake of going to Chinatown in search of their delicious egg tarts and expecting it to be open, this time I stumbled into Chinatown with no purpose but to explore and was greeted by a big crowd of people right after I passed Jackson St. \n\nI waited in the line for maybe about half an hour? It wasn't too bad. It was pretty fun getting to chat with the people around me to hear about best practices in the egg tart acquisition industry. Anyways, time flew by and I was soon at the counter. So one tricky thing that I noticed about ordering at this place is that you need a nice repertoire  of your Asian pastries before you get in. Unlike other bakeries where the goods are out for display, these goods are hidden away in baking pans in the back or covered away in sheets, so you better study up and be ready to request. \n\nThis process made me realize that I do not know any Chinese pastries in English. I got 9 egg tarts, 2 buo luo bao (bread with sweet flaky topping), 4 sa qi ma (sweet rice cake thing), and one of those vanilla flavored roll cakes. Total was only 25.50! I love how cheap Chinatown is. \n\nThe rundown:\n\negg tarts--sweet buttery flakes of deliciousness. They come out hot and the sides melt in your mouth and are so delicious!! They're also pretty big and filling. pro tip you can leave them in the fridge for a few days. just turn your oven on to 250 and bake them a bit to warm them up\n\nbuo luo bao--yum, pretty good. loved how soft the bread was, though not sure if it's super amazing\n\nsa qi ma--pretty good, though I'm no connoisseur of this--this was for mama Xu\n\nvanilla cake--yummy as well!\n\nBasically. The wait is worth it if you like good Asian pastries, though if you aren't picky you probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference I do think this place caters much better to people who speak Chinese obv or know their Chinese pastries since ordering is a lot easier that way.

Even if you've waited in a half hour line.\n \n-Terrible location. Little to no chance you'll find parking in the alleyways of SF Chinatown. The trek up this place via public transport is not worth it either. The bakery itself is so tiny that they may not even let you inside. They'll take your order from the door depending on their mood.\n\n-Worst customer service.

Why in the world would I pay $1.75 for a mediocre egg tart?? Yes it may be due to the fact that they're always piping hot out of the oven. But if you intend to bring a dozen home for your family n friends (for a whopping $21...) then I suggest you not.

They make so much money that they open whenever they want. Call ahead and if you're lucky, they might pick up and tell you what time they're open. And even if they do tell you, they might be lying...true story! They told me they're opening at 11:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning. Waited outside at 10:45 a.m., line started appearing behind us soon after, but they didn't open till 11:30 a.m.\n\nAnd guess what? They don't let people in! They literally open the door, ask what you want, tell you the price, go inside, pack your order, take your money and give you your order. There's really no time for any other questions or browsing. You either know what you want, or tough luck. There's also the pressure of all the people behind you who makes you feel rushed.\n\nEgg tarts are $1.75 and walnut pound cake is roughly $7. I'm just estimating because I initially ordered 6 egg tarts and the lady said, \"$10 something!\", and ran back inside. Added 3 walnut pound cake and she came out and said, \"$30.10!\". We gave her $31 and she went to the next customer and asked for their order. Not that we expected 90 cents back, but what? Lol okay Golden Gate Bakery, I see you.\n\nThe egg tarts are tasty when they're fresh; I usually put them in the oven the next day but the outside doesn't get crispy anymore. Walnut pound cake use to taste better; it's kind of crumbly now, but still soft/fluffy. I like how it's not too sweet.

Apparently that is what Golden Gate Bakery got really famous for.\n\nI wasn't exactly sure how big or how far their popularity has gotten until all of my friends started to talk about it when I mention \"San Francisco.\" Being born in San Francisco and being raised a good portion of it within Chinatown, I could definitely tell you that \"Golden Gate Bakery\" does not ring as loud when I was younger. \n\nThe only other memory of having egg tarts from Golden Gate Bakery was about four years back. That is assuming that I haven't had it as a kid or maybe I did but didn't know it was from there. They didn't have a long line and I was just passing by. I've heard about it but the scale of their popularity never hit me at the time. I decided to get some egg tarts since the lady told me that it was fresh from the oven. At the time, I paid about $1.25 for each egg tart. Even then, according to my grandmother, their prices have raised drastically. \n\nOn a recent trip back to San Francisco to pay my grandmother a visit, I decided to try Golden Gate Bakery again. I wasn't sure if they were going to be opened because they have this habit of just going on vacation whenever they desire. Due to a helpful tip on Facebook, we found out that they were opened. We went straight there. There was a line (go figure). The line definitely attracted people. Tourists that didn't even know about the bakery decided to stand in line because there were so many people there. He said, \"I'm not sure what I'm standing in line for but I just have to since it looks so popular here.\" Of course I had to tell him that he had to get the egg tart since that's what they are known for. Haha. \n\nIt was probably a 20 minute wait for me. A dozen of egg tarts will run you $21.00 while if you bought them separately, they were $1.75 each. Wow. Holy price raise. It probably doesn't seem like a high raise but for egg tarts? For a bakery? Yes, it is quite the increase. \n\nI ate one, boyfriend ate one, gave my friend two of them, and gave the rest to my grandmother and her friends. Her friends also made a comment on how much the egg tarts were. I can't say I'm mind blown. I can say that they were done well and the custard is not overly sweet, which is very much appreciated. A plus is that they are fresh but how can they not be? With the amount of business and turn over rate, they better be fresh! However, I can't say that I'm in love and I can't say that I would do that again. On top of it, they were rushing out orders like mad so I'm not sure how careful they are with the actual product. The egg tart that I had was a little overdone so it was a little more cooked on the edges, which led to a small burnt flavor to it. I do believe that I liked the ones I got four years ago versus the ones I got this year. Plus, I like mini egg tarts more than full sized ones :P \n\nOh, CASH ONLY. Don't get in line without it.

Why must your egg tarts be so goddamned perfect?

Of the six times which I have visited, I succeeded in conquering some delicious egg tarts twice. Consistency? Non existent.\n\nAfter waiting in line for 40mins amongst a cluster of hungry pastry lovers, we finally managed to walk away with half a dozen egg tarts. They have done the contrasting texture well. Sinking my teeth into some soft, cloudy-like wibbly wobbliness, delicate, creamy and warm (a little too warm that my tongue protested in pain) filling, which is juxtaposed against the buttery, flakey, slightly crispy crust was pure indulgence. My only complaint about the dan tat is that the bottom should be lightly toasted, in this case it was not (probably due to the ridiculous high demands.) \n\nThe reason why this I am only offering three stars is the lack (or rather, barely existent) of customer service. Three ladies hustle and bustle their way behind the counter, yelling \"NEEEEXT.\" It was my turn. As I was about to order, one of the ladies snarled at the other (in Cantonese), \"are these people all deaf?! What is wrong with them?!\" I stood in shock and turned. Behind me stood a Mandarin speaking couple happily chatting away and behind them, a cheery caucasian family. They had absolute no idea that the comment was directed at them. \"You!\" The same lady shot a word at me and I suppose that was my indication to order. My initial excitement plunged. I quickly placed my orders and escaped the crowd. \n\nAlthough the egg tarts were divine, I will probably not return for a long time - until the hours are more predictable; until the poor customer service episode eventually rust in my mind.", "author": "Vega N."}

The wait is actually agonizing as you watch people walk out with the famous pink pastry boxes. You'll frequently question what could possibly be taking so long.

Well I can tell you that the reason the line exists is because they are literally bringing up fresh egg tarts that have just finished baking, tray by tray, every 15 minutes or so. These are the real attraction and the sole cause for the line. There are a bunch of other offerings like mochis and rice cakes but you can't leave without picking up an egg tart. Walking out with warm egg tarts is honestly one of the best feelings in the world...obviously second to actually putting one in your mouth.

We bought a dozen for $21 and holy moly they were pipin' hot and fresh. \n\nThe crust was so crispy and flaky. The egg custard filling was steamy and fluffy.

Not a connoisseur of egg tarts, by any means, as this was the first time that I had them, but it was very good fresh out of the ovens.

After waiting in line for 30 minutes, I ordered half a dozen egg tarts. I didn't really know what to expect, as I've been to Hong Kong and have had \"famous\" egg tarts there multiple times. But these completely exceeded my expectations. What everyone says is true - these egg tarts are amazing. The crust is perfectly flaky, they're generous with the egg filling, and the entire pastry is just so well made. I can't get over how good these are; I'm just sad they open randomly whenever they want to. I feel silly gushing over egg tarts of all things, but these are next level egg tarts.\n\nKeep in mind that they do run out of pastries, so to be safe you should get in line earlier than not (we went around 1pm which seemed to still be okay). I really want to try their \"wife cake\" next which they didn't have that day.\n\nIf you're still on the fence on whether you should wait in line for 1.75 egg tarts (yes, overpriced), stop deliberating and GO NOW.", "author": "Claudia C."}

Well, to me, these were the best looking tarts by far with a nice flaky crust, BUT they had a more eggy taste than the other two we tried earlier(Anna, Eastern) which was fine by me. As I looked over at the lazy susan, I noticed that there were extra tarts, and before I could even consider getting another one, a couple of people on our table had already asked the waiter for take out boxes to box up the extras. NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!\n\nOh well, at least I got to try them, I thought...When the reception was over and everyone else was heading to a nearby lounge to continue the festivities, no one wanted to take any leftovers home, so we became the designated leftover takers of about 10-15 pounds of Chicken, Peking Duck, Lobster, and Black Cod! There was also a pink box all by itself , full, and untouched of EGG TARTS which we gladly took home as well. Boy, was my frown turned upside down in seconds!

Theme park rides, uhh fast pass please. DMV? Online renewal stat!!! You get the picture! So, why the heck would I wait in line for this place?

Mouth watering ....\n\nWhen it was our turn to order, I almost felt back only asking for two tarts when everyone else got boxes of them.  But since I haven't had great experiences in the past, I figured 2 was a good number to start with on this trip.  The nice lady at the counter packaged my tarts up in a little paper bag and out the door we went.  Um .... I'm not sure why I was so surprised but when I felt the bottom of the bag and realized these little handfuls of goodness were WARM I couldn't wait to eat them.  So I reached in and gently pulled out the little cup of warm goodness.\n\nThe crust was light and flaky.  The filling was bright yellow and OH SO GOOD!  Creamy, warm, sweet deliciousness.

But since we've eaten everything this place as a whole, not just the egg tarts, I have to say everything else is just pretty average to be honest.  Their rolls are comparable to just about every other bakery, as is their wive's cookies (I think that's what it's translated to), banana rice rolls, and moon cakes.  So why only three stars?  Well, they're always on vacation, which is fine, but they should kind of have a schedule up on when they leave or are planning to, instead of just closing up abruptly.  I can only be a patron of an establishment if they're open for business so availability is kind of hit and miss.  If you're coming only for egg tarts, I think it's definitely worthwhile assuming they're open and the lines isn't 45 minutes long (which it usually is).", "author": "Charles H."}

Sometimes they'll put signs up stating how long they'll be closed for, other times they'll just say they're closed indefinitely (meaning I have no idea when I'll get to eat my next egg tart!!).

Sorry.\n\nSimply put, these egg tarts are unparalleled in quality, taste, and texture.  The crust is incredibly flaky and the egg-y filling is silky smooth and creamy.  At $1.40 per egg tart, you really can't go wrong with ordering multiples!  Their bak tong gou, a sweet white sponge cake, is also quite delicious, but not mind-blowing like the dan tat.  Bak tong gou is a childhood favorite, though, so I had to get a pack of three slices for $2.25.\n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, be prepared for a line.

Enjoy your days off ladies because making thousands of delicious egg tarts must be pretty exhausting.\n\nThey have a permanent \"Closed for Vacation\" sign affixed to the door, which is a good reminder that it's worth the wait.

Just give them your money!! The egg tarts are fresh (even at 4:30 pm) with a nice flaky crust and a perfect custard filling. But watch out while you eat a fresh one.

Turning to yelp, I learned that the piece de resistance here is the egg custard tart.  Despite being only 8 or so people back in line (a very long line developed behind me), it still took 20-30 minutes to get my coveted tart.  People in front of me ordered by the dozen, and the ladies behind the counter were pulling them out of the oven as fast as possible but not keeping up with the demand.  The tarts are $1.80 each, which is a steal for how filling they are.  The flaky, crispy crust is delicious.  Where the custard started to set up and cool around the edges, I thought it was good.  Eggy, but slightly sweet.  For me, the hot jiggly center wasn't ideal, but I'm happy I tried it and got the GG Bakery experience.  \n\nI also ordered COCONUT MACAROONS, which can only be ordered in half dozen amounts.  While I didn't think I needed that many, I was later SOOOO glad I got them.  By far the best coconut macaroon I've ever eaten.  It was carmelized and buttery and crunchy on the outside with a nice, sweet, soft, coconut bite in the middle.

But it's no easy task finding a good Dan Tot in the streets of SF. Luckily, Golden Gate Bakery has masterfully recreated the sweet experiences that Hong Kong natives have of the Dan Tot. Though all these experiences are guaranteed delicious, they can vary between different types of Dan Tot eaters.\n\n1. The Big Biter\nPossibly the most prevalent of all Dan Tot eaters, the Big Biter looks to finish their treat in around 3 bites. A satisfying way to enjoy one's Dan Tot, as each bite brilliantly contrasts the crispy crust with the soft yellow custard. \n\n2. The Nibbler\nPrecision. Attention to Detail. The Nibbler employ a solid set of tasting skills to enjoy every last intricacy of the Dan Tot. Yes, they're the ones that will tell you about the multi-layer crust that flakes off like a buttery croissant after every nibble.\n\n3. The Boss\nThe Boss eats the Dan Tot with a spoon. They simply scoop up the sweet custard and leave the crust untouched. Quite unorthodox, but it certainly maximizes the sweetness in each bite. Plus, it looks super boss.\n\nAt a little over a dollar for each Dan Tot, you can definitely try out all three ways of eating the Dan Tot for under five dollars.

After heading over to investigate, I found out that the people who were waiting had pre-ordered egg tarts.\n\nThe lady working inside kept the door shut, only opening it to take additional orders or to collect money. There was no order to their line or even a distinction between those adding on orders versus those who had pre-ordered. Adding to the confusion was a sign on their door stating they were closed for vacation. \n\nWhen asked about the wait time, she told us that she still had a list of pre-orders to go through, but refused to estimate how long until they would be able to serve the add-ons.\n\nFrom the glimpses I caught of the store, it appeared very unkempt inside with papers and boxes strewn about. The disorganization did not boost my faith in their ability to keep track of their orders.\n\nPerhaps their egg tarts are the best in the city.  Perhaps they are cheapest priced egg tarts. Perhaps this was enough to attract customers decades ago. But the blatant disregard to their customers' time and unprofessional service marks them as a dinosaur in modern times.

In this particular case I had 3 hours between a hospital in Antioch and the SF VA, so for lunch I decided on a quick dim sum run. This was the second of three stops. (An afterthought: DO NOT do this. Couldn't eat the tarts right away so I had to store them in my purse. I could faintly smell the tarts during the lab tour)\n\nYou'll notice this place because there will be a line out the front - not surprising in part due to the 4 1/2 star average, 1900+ reviews here and other accolades. Supposedly they close at random times; there's an actual website AND FB fan page JUST to track this (http://www.is-the-golden-gate-bakery-open-today.com/)\n\nI went close to 1pm and surprisingly there wasn't much of a line at all. Within 5 minutes I was at the counter placing my order for 2 tarts ($1.40 each). One tart fits the palm of my hand. Yolk was a pale yellow and the outside had a crust of puff pastry.\n\nI have several considerations of the most ideal definition of \"foodgasm\" - this is one of them. A GOOD puff pastry crust is quite buttery that the crust falls apart when you eat it, this is definitely something you do NOT want to munch on if you plan on keeping your clothes clean. The custard has creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e consistency and not that of an undercooked scrambled egg. If I add a little cinnamon and broil the pastry, this would then turn into my ideal pasteis de nata. \n\nCons that it's a messy eat and it loses a bit of deliciousness when it's not fresh off the oven - those I blame myself for doing this within a super tight timeframe. Next time I'll have to try their mooncakes.\n\nUPDATE 1/4/2014: I tried their coconut tart. The closest to what I can describe is \"coconut-flavored cornbread\". I'm not super fond of coconut, but there was enough to detect it yet I appreciated how warm and fluffy the pastry is.

Prices are currently $1.40 per egg tart or $16.80 a dozen. \n\nNote: CASH ONLY. Also, don't forget they also sell fresh moon cakes for the Mid-Autumn Festival.", "author": "Steph F."}

The streets were closed off for Chinese New Years and they were having some sort of street market so it was pretty packed. The bakery itself is really small. There's actually no room for your to browse. The only people inside were the people that were being helped. \n\nThe line formed outside and one thing that bothered me is that we couldn't see what they had from the outside. Most people knew what they wanted, but I didn't even know what they had...except for egg tarts. I ended up taking a little longer when I got in, but still felt rushed because the lady is just staring at you waiting for you to tell her what you want. \n\nBesides that, I did get the famous egg tarts. I don't really eat egg tarts that often, but boy were these egg tarts delicious. I didn't know how expensive moon cakes were until I bought some here. They got up to like $12/cake, but they were definitely better than any moon cakes I have ever tried. If you're visiting a fan of egg tarts then you should definitely come. But if you don't care for it then save your time because there will probably be a line and parking ain't easy.", "author": "Christina T."}

I've stopped by here multiple times when I was in SF but today was finally the day where it was actually opened. The line was super long and I waited over 30 minutes for some freshly baked egg tarts. It tasted really yummy and the egg tart stayed hot as I ate and walked around Chinatown.

You can also buy a dozen for $21. \n\nFinding parking will be a struggle in this area.

I was so lucky! This place was open and the line wasn't too long! :) My boyfriend and I waited for maybe 20 minutes, but it was so totally worth it. I actually enjoyed the wait because it allowed me to look at their different bakery varieties and think about what I wanted. By the time I reached the front of the line, I ordered 2 egg tarts and 2 other Chinese new year desserts. \n\nI wish I ordered more than 2 egg tarts, like half a dozen or a dozen!!! I am totally serious. They were soooo good. Just writing about it right now is making me drool....sigh. Anyways, the egg tarts were cheap and delicious. The egg tarts are big in size. Bigger than the ones at dim sum restaurants. However, they taste 100% better than dim sum restaurants. They are fresh and creamy. You know its fresh by the way it smells and looking at the yolk part of the egg tart. If the yolk part of the egg tart is not dry, darkened, or thick/hardened, its definitely fresh.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-18", "description": "UPDATE (9/1/13): Price increase to $1.40 each, say whaaaaaa. But, they still taste herra good.\n\nThe hype is legit.\n\nOn a Monday afternoon, I finally had the opportunity to wait in line for the famous GGB dan tats (resident of the SF Big Eat 2013 list: http://www.7x7.com/big-eat-2013#/38). Fortunately, the wait to the counter was only 15 minutes, as I was already in a 45-minute wait for the Obama-graced Great Eastern dimsum restaurant. At $1.35 each ($16.20 for a dozen, http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SYsV4RFMkPwjqgbeq0VcIg/l.jpg), these are some pricey pastries, but they are worth every pretty penny.\n\nDan tats, or egg custard tarts, are denser than most other custard desserts (flan, pot de cremes, puddings). Alongside the custard filling, the crust is another judgment factor, which is typically a shortcrust pastry made of a combination of butter and lard to achieve the pinnacle multi-layer flakiness. Seriously, when a dan tat tastes that good, it's probably made with some good ol' lard because that's what is holding all those flaky layers together.\n\nTheir crust is perfect. A perfect crust is not only flaky but also thin so that it complements, not overpowers, the custard filling. This is the thinnest crust I've ever had on a dan tat: crispy and airy without a hint of sogginess. Seriously, how the ultra-thin bottom layer resists moisture absorption is beyond my comprehension. And the multiple vertical layers of pastry in the crust bring me to tears (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/20qxofAo0tiOCy2GGYoAgQ/l.jpg). It's a work of art, it really is.\n\nHaving baked my own n00b version of dan tats, I can say that the crust takes the most effort. But the custard cannot be underestimated because if you don't bake the tart to the right consistency, you can dry out the filling or have it too wet. They bake it with just the right amount of firmness on top and light mushiness inside, creating a silky-smooth, vanilla-sweet experience. They lean more on the flavor of vanilla rather than on the flavor of egg yolk, which lends more toward texture.\n\nI would also agree with Lawrence E. that dan tats taste better after a bit of cooling rather than fresh out of the oven. The waiting allows the custard to solidify in texture and flavor so that you can focus more on the taste, not on temperature. But warm dan tats are better than cold ones! That being said...\n\nI've read that dan tats are good for next-day consumption, but try to avoid sticking them in the fridge (crust gets soggy) or the microwave (crust gets hard). Rule of thumb for warm dan tats seems to be sticking them for a few seconds in an oven or toaster oven.\n\nA bit expensive at $1.35 a piece, but damn, this stuff is good, especially if you're craving lard! ;)\n\nExperimental results UPDATE: The crust definitely hardens when the dan tats are stored in the fridge, but a minute or so in the toaster oven will soften things up (flakiness is lost, inevitably). The custard filling stayed consistently delicious even after 3 days in the fridge, but the crust on the bottom got a bit soggy from the custard. Condensation doesn't seem to be a problem, thank goodness. These are some good egg tarts!", "author": "Adele F."}

One of the women at the front of the line was antsy from the waiting and kept pestering the workers. She really needed her fix. We had to stay outside the establishment and tell them our orders and pass cash through the door. It was CRAZY.

I ordered several boxes for friends and business contacts comprising of a mix of four different varieties:  pineapple with egg, red bean, lotus paste with egg, and mixed nuts (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=NhE3W_qkSccBcjaoDdmF-w).  \nMooncakes are a plenty now as the week counts down to 9/8 Harvest Moon night.  The Chinatown stores are setting up tables OUTSIDE their stores to clear their inventory, Costco has them, but my friends seem to enjoy this one the best.  So get there early if you need the tart fix or have a mooncake shopping list to fill.  The only reason this isn't a five star review is no one can predict when they are open or closed.  And, by the way, if you make it here this week, no, the screaming that you hear won't be from the kung fu movies; more likely, it'll be from those harsh words, \"Sold out!\"", "author": "Mike C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-30", "description": "Golden Gate Bakery is an old style Chinese bakery that has some items that are harder to find in the newer, trendier bakeries.  People line up here for one thing and it is the dan tart.  What is a dan tart?  It is an egg custard pastry.  Dan tarts are supposed to have an eggy custardy center and a flaky pastry, though some places have modified the flaky crust to make more of a cookie crust.  I much prefer the flaky crust over the cookie crust.  Also, I find bakeries tend to either make a good custard and bad crust or a good crust and bad custard.  It's rare to find a bakery that can do both. Over the years, dan tarts have also suffered from poor quality and the custard has deteriorated from having a real eggy taste to some that have no custard taste or creaminess at all. Some are so brightly yellow that they actually have a neon glow and can light your way through darkness.\n\nNot so here, the dan tart custard is soft, custardy, warm, super creamy and utterly delicious. The crust is stark contrast to the sweetened center.  The crust tends to be salty and I must have gone later in the day, but my crust was not flaky.  There is though, a nice contrast between sweet custard and salty crust.  If you cannot get both components of a dan tart perfect, at least one should be superior and Golden Gate Bakery excels in the custard, so don't miss out.  Go where all the locals are lining up because they know where to get a good dan tart. One dan tart will set you back $1.50.\n\nOn another day, I tested out their banana rolls and not as good as others I have tasted.  It seems like I was eating just a mass of glutinous sweet rice flour with a splash of banana flavoring. These banana rolls are $.80 a piece.  Better off adding $.70 and going straight for the dan tart, where your money will be better spent.\n\nThey also have these really hot pink pastry boxes, so if you have a quantity of dan tarts, you too could be walking out in hard not to spot box.  Just don't let anyone snatch your dan tarts away!\n\nThe four stars is for the dan tart!", "author": "Lin Y."}

I got 18 of these beautiful lovely babies (my wallet hurt. They are almost $2 each!!) to share and they were gone in no time. My first bite of these famous egg tarts was while walking up the streets of China town. It is extremely flakey on the outside and perfectly eggy and firm but soft and perfectly sweet on the inside. They're also crazy fresh! It was so piping hot it burned my tongue but it was so good that I made some weird gurgly noise \"GAH SOO GOOD\" and a man walking by laughed at me and asked in canto if it was good so with my mouth full of beautiful egg tart I answered \"hooooo sik\" meaning soooo tasty \nTip: check for the bakery's geotag and hashtag on Instagram to see if it's open for the day! People will post pictures of their egg tarts when they get them! so it'll save you the time and trouble of running to China town just to discover they're closed! :)", "author": "Victoria C."}

They're generously thick, have the right level of eggy density, just the right hint of sweetness, and a good balance between flakiness and soft chewiness in the crust. The ladies who work this shop are also sweet, upbeat, and always on top of their game given the constantly long lines and endless barrage of questions from clueless non-Chinese customers and even more clueless tourists.\n\nIn my book, however, a Chinese bakery should be strong across the board to merit a stellar overall rating. I do like my custard buns, \"pineapple\" buns, and roast pork buns, for example. I tried all three, and they were just average (forgettable in the case of the custard bun), which was a bit underwhelming given how good the aforementioned egg custard tart was.\n\nNevertheless, the egg custard tart is totally worth the $1.25, and all the other items, despite being merely average, are much cheaper. While it's the best bakery in Chinatown, there may be other bakeries in suburban Asian enclaves that are stronger all around.", "author": "Vincent L."}

And the only place I wanted to find was this Golden Gate Bakery - just to see why and how good the egg custards are!\n\nLuckily for us, the bakery was open and there were about 4-5 egg custards left.  Since it was later in the evening, these were not the fresh out of the oven batch.  However, we paid and stepped out - I proceeded to dive straight in and see what it's all about.  The custard itself was not special (and perhaps it's because it wasn't fresh) but the egg part - wow!  It's been a while since I've had some good quality egg custard.  It took me a while to appreciate it.  After that, I slowed down and slowly savoured it.\n\nThe bakery did not look glamorous or stand out in anyway.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-04-08", "description": "Many many visits\n\nGolden Gate Bakery is probably the best Chinese bakery in town. It's an establishment dated back to the 1940s. Here you will find traditional Chinese pastries like \"wife cake\", the signature \"dat taat\"---egg custard tart, pineapple bun, Swiss roll, puffy brioche, and macaroon (NOT macaron, I'm so frustrated many people think macaroon and macaron are the same things).\n\n*Wife Cake: also known as sweetheart cake, the Golden Gate wife cake is very flaky with a thin skin. The crushed winter melon and almond paste filling is not too sweet. It's the only place in town you can find the \"orthodox\" candied mash of winter melon mixing with white sesame seed. I love it!\n\n*Egg Custard Tart: is the store's signature item. Usually you'll have to wait as their supply cannot meet the demand. Unlike many other bakeries, Golden Gate uses only eggs and not the egg powder. Custard has a velvety, silky texture with a hint of vanilla. The crust is a pure decadence---a buttery and flaky crust holding together the throbbing egg custard. Worth every penny of $1.40 (for this price you can get 3 at nearby bakeries).\n\n*Pineapple Bun: the point of eating pineapple bun is the top, which is made of a dough similar to that used to make sugar cookies, which consists of sugar, eggs, flour, and lard. This top appears to be like pineapple. It's crunchy, flaky and good.\n\n*Curry Puff: it's like an empanada filled with shredded chicken marinated with five-spice powder and curry. It's another popular item among the locals.\n\n*Pound Cake by the Loaf: is like eating egg and butter. The pound cake here doesn't have lemon or vanilla extract, just pure butter and eggs, mixing with enough flour to give some sort of a stiff texture. Usually pound cake tends to get moist over time but here the cake stays dry.\n\nThe ladies who work here would get very chatty with locals and regulars. They can be a bit Nazi so don't touch the cake container or dish. Be ready when your turn is called. The line can be ridiculously long on weekends. \n\nGolden Gate Bakery does take unannounced breaks at least twice a year for about a month each. Usually they will close about a month before the Moon Festival for moon cake preparation.", "author": "Matt Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-02-12", "description": "There's a reason that Golden Gate Bakery's Egg Tarts make it on every list for must-try things in SF! They're DELICIOUS!\n\nI'm a sucker for egg tarts, in general, but I've had plenty of bad ones in my time.  Sometimes the crust is too soggy or the ratio of crust to filling isn't appropriate or the taste of the filling isn't good.  But Golden Gate's are perfect!\n\nI stopped by on Tuesday afternoon, and there was no line to get in.  At first, because it was late afternoon, I thought that they had run out of egg tarts, since I didn't see any in the glass.  Then an old lady working there motion signaled for me to go in, and I asked if they had any more egg tarts.  She nodded yes.  So I purchased 4, and was well on my way. When I got to my car, I decided that I had to snack on one immediately. (In my experience, if I waited until I got home an hour later, the egg tart may not be as good because of varying factors).  So I inhaled the tart as soon as I sat down.  The first thing I noticed in my first bite, was that the egg tart was WARM! I didn't realize that the egg tarts weren't in the glass case because they were in a warmer.  What a delightful surprise!  This made eating the egg tart immediately, that much better! Since it was fresh out of  the oven, the crust was perfectly crispy!  The filling was also soft, custardy with a touch of sweetness.\n\nWhy did I like this egg tart?  \n1. The crispy, flaky crust\n2. The delicious, slightly sweet, custardy filling\n3. The fact that it was served warm\n\nThe rest that I bought were still delicious by the time I got home, but nothing can replace that fresh out of the oven goodness.\n\nAfter having a Golden Gate egg tart, it'll be hard to find another one that's just as good, and at the same price point. $1.40 each.", "author": "Audrey C."}

I was walking around Chinatown & thought that this bakery would be difficult to find, but there was a long line out of the door & I instantly knew that I found it! Lol. We were in line outside of the shop for about 10 minutes until we reached the door. Not too bad considering the line was hella long. We got inside & the lady asked how many tarts we wanted, and then we had to wait another 5-10 minutes until we got our box of tarts. They were super fresh, steaming hot, & super flaky. The custard part of the tart had a strong vanilla flavor, and I really liked that! The ladies inside were really nice, and made my first time here memorable. If you're thinking about buying 1 tart, buy 2. Trust me, you're going to want more than 1 after that first bite.", "author": "Nikki S."}

Buttery flakey crust.  Just enough vanilla and almond flavor. The best I've had outside of Macau after my egg tart crawl across Macau.  Story for another day. \n\nSo get in line!  Please note, they are very awesome when fresh and warm. They aren't nearly as good the next day. \n\n--- my theory on why the line is so long ------\nAfter waiting for 90 mins, here's my theory in the reason for the length of the line.  Most folks really only need to buy one or two per person to eat that day.  However after waiting in line for a little bit, they decide that what the heck, I'll get a dozen. Now a bunch of people make the same decision and the bakers are now trying to keep up with the demand. So the line gets longer. And folks in line are waiting longer and when it's their turn, they buy more than they can possibly eat in a day. So the line gets even longer!  How did I come to this theory?  Listening to people say they only want a few and walking out with a box or two.  Ugh, we do this to ourselves!  The tarts are good but in moderation.  Trust me. After the third, it's not going to be as pleasurable as the first bite of the first one!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-22", "description": "So many reviews written about this place, so I'll try to make this review as distinct as possible. \n\nAre you willing to wait for a long time to get possibly the tastiest \u86cb\u64bb (dan taat in Cantonese Chinese), or Chinese style egg tarts in San Francisco and possibly the USA? When I waited on a Monday afternoon at this place, it took me 50+ minutes just to get inside this Chinese bakery. It might have been unprecedented for me, but as the queue got longer and longer, I then realized that I did not want to give up my spot. Plus, it was my last day in San Francisco, so I did not want to miss out. I decided to order eight of them for my family. \n\nThis place is a simple, \"low-tech\" place, with a lot of clutter and I think there's a small \"hidden production facility\" behind the counter that makes the \u86cb\u64bb. The description of the \u86cb\u64bb might sound a little exaggerated, but I am going to be as truthful as I can.  \n\nThe crust was not brittle, was not too hard but just right. It had the right amount of flakiness, and a nice tiny crisp, making it an almost flawless crust that I would look for in an egg tart. The custard itself was not too sweet but not too bland with a nice rich softness. It was one of the most delicious egg tarts I have eaten in years, but eating it fresh right out of the oven was even better, with the warmness still there. \n\nComing from a somewhat decent city like Boston, this bakery succeeds in their \u86cb\u64bb where all other Chinese bakeries in Boston fall short. That's how good it is. I think they understand English, but it's easier to communicate with them if you know some Cantonese Chinese and make sure you have plenty of cash. A \u86cb\u64bb is kind of pricey at $1.60 a piece, but you're paying for quality. \n\nOverall, I thought I had not only the best \u86cb\u64bb in San Francisco, but possibly the best \u86cb\u64bb in the USA, and could be a legitimate contender to compete against other \u86cb\u64bb from Toronto or Vancouver. I really hated the wait, but it was rewarding to finally get that box of \u86cb\u64bb in my hands, as if I got a box filled with gold. Would I wait here again? Probably not, unless the queue is shorter, I play a really addicting game on my phone, or I have an interesting companion to have a nice conversation with for more than 45 minutes. It's much more worthwhile to order large quantities rather than wait for just for one \u86cb\u64bb.", "author": "Ambrose C."}

However, the bakery has been closed since November! Argh! After months of waiting they finally reopened on Jan 18 and I couldn't resist stopping by the next day when I was the area. Possibly a big mistake because though I was so happy to have the egg custard tarts again it was a 30 min wait. Not sure if it was because they were closed for so long or because it's crazy on weekends (lots of families walking out with boxes and boxes of pastry). \n\nYes, it's $1.40 per tart but given that most pastry shops sell a chocolate chip cookie for $2 and other pastries for $3+ you should really stop complaining. Even if you can get them cheaper, really are you going to argue over 50\u00a2 difference?\n\nEspecially when these are the World's Best Egg Custard Tarts. Super Eggy soft custard filling. Perfectly baked crispy, flakey, golden crust. It's really the crust that differentiates this place.\n\nI'll note that during weekend lunch the curry empanadas seemed very popular as well.

Traffic was awful and the line to Golden Gate Bakery was ridiculously long. So, this visit to SF, we got smart about it, we decided to come here the last day we were in SF (on a Saturday) and during an odd hour (around 2pm). We either got lucky or we planned it well, because the 1) the line into Golden Gate was small and 2) traffic around the area wasn't horrendous. My friends dropped me off and just kind of waited for me. I went in and ordered 6 egg tarts and 2 coconut tarts ($12 total). It's such a small shop, so just have 1-2 people go in to order a bunch for the group. Don't do what the group in front of me did and hog up space with 6 people while 1 person ordered. \n\nTo quote one of my two non-Asian friends, \"I've had egg tarts at dimsum, and those aren't nearly as good as this. There is sufficient filling and the crust is real crispy and not so thick. I really like it\". I fully agree with everything he said. The egg tarts are good. If you like coconut, you'll like the coconut tart. This bakery has really mastered the art of a nice think flaky crust and lots of filling. The filling also isn't too sweet, and there's just so much. Although I have to say, for egg tarts and coconut tarts, I wouldn't wait more than 30 minutes for this, but if you go at an off time when the line is short, it is definitely worth the extra buck and change.

My excuse: they're for my parents, for the boy, and for the boy's mother. More like we'll see how many is left after I bart my sorry guilty ass home. \n\nSo we're sitting at Union Square chowing away and Skinny bitch friend just watches me devour my pink pastry box of goods. She tried to take one of my egg tarts and I nearly ripped her arm from her socket. I wanted a dozen for a reason. STAY SKINNY, BITCH. \n\nI don't know what else to say besides that I love their egg tarts. I like them fresh out the oven, I liked them toasted, I like them icey cold from the fridge, and I like them creme brulee style (try it)! \n\nAnd their paper sponge cakes... I've always wanted to see how many I could stuff in my mouth...but that wouldn't be very pleasant to watch.", "author": "Nadeen H."}

I can't remember the last time I walked around SF Chinatown, maybe not since I was a wee lad. I have no emotional attachment to SF Chinatown, probably because I grew up with LA Chinatown, which still exists, but not in the way I remember.\n\nHe tells me that this place is only open three months out of the year, and there is usually a line fifty deep. He also claims that the owner of this place has microphones in an underground bakery to make sure that no one is giving away the secret recipe for the egg tarts. Urban myth or hardcore Chinese paranoia? Hard to say, 50% of each?\n\nWhen we walked up, there were only a dozen people ahead of us, but in short order, the line doubled up behind us. I watched a couple of bakers bring tray after tray of egg tarts up from some unseen bakery. With the exception of a glass bakery case in the front, the rest of the visible work area looks more like my parent's unorganized fire hazard of a garage. There are wire shelves everywhere packed with eight year old newspapers, Kirkland chicken noodle soup from Costco, and other non-bakery related items. \n\nThe ladies that work here like to yell at you, like any Chinese (not ABC) lady. They yell at you in English, Cantonese and Mandarin. WHAT DO YOU WANT??! HOW MANY??! TWELVE DOLLARS! If economy of language is inherent to Chinese culture, these ladies are the equivalent of Adam Smith. \n\nMy buddy ordered a dozen dan tats. That's it. All the other Chinese people ordered dan tats. That's it. I had one and I'm not sure if it was the \"best ever\", but it was pretty damn good. Right up there. Close to \"best ever\". The pastry crust is paper thin. The egg custard was warm, soft consistency, and not overly cooked or curdled. \n\nIf you're sad that you waited in line for an hour, or your \"cream bun\" was underwhelming, well, you went on the wrong day, wrong time, and ordered the wrong thing. Go on a Thursday morning, right before lunch, bring cash, and order a dozen dan tats. Done.", "author": ".Alan Y."}

The balance between crunchy/flaky was impeccable, which made this egg tart number 2 in my book.  I ordered a few more and was told it would only take 25 min to cook up a fresh dozen.  I walked around and came back and BOOM they were ready =]\n\nA few things to note, the storefront can only hold about 8-10 people max so don't be shy if you see a long line.

Nowadays, at $1.40, they are very overpriced for their average quality. Basically they've never been able to match the original head baker's recipe since he passed away back then. Every now and then I try stopping by to see if they've ever found an equivalent baker, but it seems they just keep slipping. My most recent visit today left me sorely disappointed; one glance at the crust and you can tell immediately that this will not rise above the rest. Did they get yet another baker? Because this looks the least appealing of all the times I've visited, with its thin pinched crust edges and overly orange color. Egg custard itself tastes fine though. Better to be on a day when there's high turnover, so you get one that's warm (but not too warm, which tastes less yummy).\n\nI've had wonderful uniformly flaky crusts like the old GGB in mini egg tarts served at a dim sum place, although I forget where (maybe Koi Palace??). Aside from going to the right dim sum restaurant, I've yet to find anything quite like the original I have in my memories. Oh well, the hunt goes on!", "author": "Linus W."}

The sign on the door said they opened at noon, but despite being half an hour after that time the doors were locked and the lights were out. Still, everyone continued waiting in line so we joined them. Finally, the doors opened around one and the long line moved fairly quickly. I peeked through the window to see what else they had on offer, but nothing really caught my eye, just some muffins and cookies. The egg tarts though? They were legit. Of course I gobbled one up as soon as I received the box! I don't think I've ever had a warm egg tart before and these were fresh out of the oven (is that how you make them?). The crust was crispy, but quite thin and the warm filling was a little sweeter than other egg tarts I've had. They were also pretty big and the price was right at around $1.60/each. I ate another one later on after they cooled off and I felt like they were just okay. For me, these are like Krispy Kreme donuts, best eaten hot off the line, but average after they've cooled.

And in reality, they weren't that much different than normal custard tarts and moon cakes I can buy within 5 minutes at a local SOGO, Marina Foods, or Ranch 99.\n\nThe issue (or good part when there is no line) is that they make everything fresh. And with batches of 24 custard tarts and most people buying boxes of 6 or 12, you can see how the line can get long and stagnant. Each batch takes around ~5-10 minutes. \n\nPersonally, I prefer custard tarts chilled, so tasting the freshly made hot ones wasn't my thing. It was good, but just not my style, so keep that in mind. \n\nAlso, the place itself is really small. It can fit only a few customers inside at a time, and there are no seats or anything.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-15", "description": "I love egg tarts.\nSo, when I was in SF for the day I was Yelping on my phone for good places to eat. After seeing the 4.5 stars by 1800+ Yelpers, I decided I would try it out. BUT - made the mistake of not actually reading any of the reviews (very not like me)...\nAfter dinner, we found the bakery - there was a line. But, I looked at my BF and shrugged, \"this line should go quickly.. don't worry... we'll be home right after I get a dozen!\".... Right. (Please see my awesome drawing/photo of what the line REALLY looked like... lol)\n\nI'm not from Frisco, so this was my first time at this bakery. The line I was able to see from 5'6, on tip toes, looked like a cake walk! 45 minutes in, we had only moved up the line by about 4 people... the only reason, was because the 4 people before us, got sick of waiting and left (harhar). To make a long story short - 1.5 hours later, and 10 slots up later, we were able to see the line formation. The only words out of my mouth was \"OH - MY - F*CK!!\". I don't know if the bakery asked people to form the line this way, or it just happened, but the line snaked around like the shape of a question mark. THREE HOURS AND FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER - we finally made it to the entrance of the bakery. Cold, tired, hungry, irritated, and stressed we made our order. A dozen egg tarts, 4 moon cakes. \n\nI don't know if the line is this ridiculous usually... But I'm thinking maybe it was like this because they make thousands of moon cakes, flavors from lotus seed, to coconut & nuts, to pineapple - with yolk, without yolk. I happened to be there the week of Chinese moon festival... Sooo, maybe? \n\nTHE EGG TARTS - were really amazingly delicious. Worth 3 hours of standing in line for? In the cold? Not really. $16.80 for a dozen or $1.40 a piece. Good size. Creamy and eggy in the middle. Had the perfect amount of jiggle in the center. Egg was not too sweet - just perfect. Amazing flaky crust. \nMy irritation of it was the way they boxed up my tarts. Small box - 2 layers. The tarts were just right out of the oven, with only a few minutes of cooling time, before boxed. Now, while they cut 2 holes on the corners of the box to allow steam to escape... that just isn't enough to work. The steam rising from the bottom tarts, sogged up the top layer tarts. And, as pictured, the tarts ALL looked like that. Squished. Bottom and sides of crusts were slightly soggy and top of crusts were still golden brown, flaky, goodness. They really should allow them to cool before boxing them! I understand that they are so popular that they are making egg tarts every 5-10 minutes, ALL day... But, as a business, they should consider expanding, hiring bakers to bake. The reason it took so long, was because they didn't have enough tarts to supply EVERY person in line... So, they would make people wait for tarts to finish... which is why it takes them about 20 minutes to serve 2 customers. \n\nBUT I must give credit where it is due. The bakery closes @ 8pm, and the staff stayed until 10pm to make sure that everyone who stood in line, was able to leave with what they came for. There was still about 20 people @ 9pm (an hour AFTER they were suppose to close). But instead of limiting the last few of us to only 6 tarts max, they decided to stay for as long as needed and continued to bake up tarts until the last of us! Now THAT is awesome customer service. And plus, the staff were all very very sweet and smiled through the chaos. \n\nSo, last thoughts: egg tarts tasted as good as everyone says. They could use some help in the boxing department. So if you would like to try the tarts, I would walk by and check out the line: if there are more than 10 people outside the door, it might take 15-20 minutes. If the line begins to wrap around the side walk - come back another day OR bring a book, and a fold up chair to sit on.. It sure was a crazy experience but here I am 24 hours after the fact, and I have no tarts left.", "author": "Wendy T."}

Finally I bought six egg tarts to celebrate Moon Festival with my friends and to me, it's a tad overrated hype. \n\nLet's start from the taste first. It was good even though I bought it in the morning and ate it at night. You just need to put it into oven then it will taste exactly the same. The crust was flaky and thin and with nice gooey egg custard in the middle. And I have to say, this egg tart is probably with the most flaky and the most gooey custard I've ever had in this area.  \n\nHowever, I would expect more based on reviews and rating from Yelp. Custard was good, but suppose to have more flavor rather than just egg yolk. In other words, the custard was a little bit too eggy and did not match well with their buttery crust. \n\nNext, the earlier you go, the less time you will spend waiting in the line. At least you need to wait for 30 mins generally in the afternoon. Try to visit there as earlier as you can so that you won't waste too much time prob for just one or two egg tarts. \n\nTherefore, they won't tell you when are they on vacation until you actually visit the place.

My sister was also looking for another type of pastry; she calls them \"flying saucer\" (they're white and glutinous and they're shaped like a little saucer).  They didn't have any.  However, she did buy my mom her favorite cookies...the coconut cookies (sort of look like them coconut macaroons).    \n\nI am fortunate that I have an older sister to treat my younger sister and me to these egg custards.  I have to concede that they are the best.  The crust is probably made with a whole lotta butter for the melt-in-the-mouth taste.  The egg custard is also delish...so velvety smooth and sweet.  It doesn't have a lot of eggy taste, but still it's all good.  More like, excellent and they are the \"bomb\".\n\nMany moons ago (and they have moon cakes, too), these egg custards were 50 cents each, but now they're $1.35 each.

Once we got in the bakery, we loaded up and ordered: a dozen egg tarts, a few coconut tarts, a roll cake, a slice of chocolate roll cake, some egg custard cakes and an apple roll.\n\nAnd though our original plan of 3 egg tarts for $4 ($1.35 each or $16 per dozen) turned into a $40 bakery fix, all concerns were melted away once we took our first taste of an egg tart.  I've had many an egg tart (from NY, Chicago, SF, LA, HK, etc.) and this ranks among the best. Ever.  Flaky, buttery crust with golden brown, crispy edges and jiggly, sweet but not too sweet, eggy filling (the consistency of panna cotta).  It is perfection.  Worth the wait in line and worth the price.\n\nThe other cakes we ordered are very good - light, fluffy consistency and beautifully made, but the star of the show is definitely the egg tart.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-01", "description": "I guess Golden Gate Bakery doesn't really need my help in recommending them, but I have to say that their egg tarts are really good. You MUST eat them fresh to enjoy their flaky, eggy goodness. Otherwise, they get exponentially worse with every minute you wait to eat them. \n\nThat said, a fresh GGB egg tart has a delicate, flaky crust. Each layer is really thin and provides a very enjoyable light crisp as your teeth sink into it. The custard is smooth with a semi-gelatinous jiggly texture, and its flavor is pleasantly eggy and sweet but not overtly buttery or rich.  I like that it's not too rich, buttery, or heavy as the crust's relative lightness compliments the sweet egg custard perfectly! These delectable treats are the only reasons you need to take a trip to Chinatown. Yes, reasons, because you won't just eat one.\n\nI also want to add that I only find these lighter, sweeter egg tarts around here. Whenever I've been to Hong Kong or Macau, they tend to be richer and heavier but still very delicious. If you want to try an egg tart that resembles that kind of style, order the Portuguese Tarts (Po Tat) from Koi Palace. They have a thicker, richer crust while the egg custard is more buttery and heavier. They're much more decadent if that's your thing. I can't get enough of either!", "author": "Nei N."}

At 3pm on a Saturday afternoon, the line was just 30 min long, so the wait time wasn't that bad.  We got 2 egg custard tarts, 1 coconut tart and 1 gooey dough for just $5.30. Really reasonable price!\n\nThe egg tart was actually quite good. It was not as sweet as the egg custard tarts from other places. This one tasted felt a little more savory than dessert like than egg tarts that I had elsewhere and seemed to be more filling (e.g. more custard portion). The shell was flaky, which made it more delicious in my mind. Their coconut tart and the gooey dough (I don't know what the name was..but it's a circular-shaped white dough) were good but nothing much to rave about. Overall, the egg tart was good and better than those I had elsewhere, but being someone who doesn't and never really cares much for egg tart, I probably wouldn't want to get in such a long wait line here again unless my friend wants to try some of these tarts.\n\nNote: no pictures allowed inside the store.

Parking is a nightmare in the area and after a solid 45 minutes of searching I managed to finally nab one.\n\nThe line outside the bakery was modest since it was only the early afternoon and the smells of fresh pastries wafted into the streets.  I decided to share the love with my entire family and ordered a full dozen of the egg custard tarts to take home, along with some of the sweet rice cakes.  There was nowhere to enjoy their fresh, piping hot goodness in the rain so we ducked into Ten Ren Tea and found a dry quiet spot in back.  Ok, I usually try not to buy the hype but these tarts were unbelievable and just as good as the legend tells.  The custard was so creamy and had perfect texture and flavor that paired with the flaky puff pastry so well.  Unquestionably, there's nowhere in San Francisco that serves up better stuff and at $1.15 each, they're a total bargain.  The rice cakes were super good as well and were mildly sweet and make a perfect treat for kids.\n\nThe drive though a rainy Chinatown was totally worth it to cap off an otherwise not so good food day.

I wasn't that impressed, after an entire year of hype. Now, to be fair, it depends on what you're looking for in a dan tat: their custard is of the lighter, more egg-flavored variety.

People claim there are crazy lines, and I'll be honest, I've spent over 70 minutes in line before. But the majority of the time, if I'm lucky, and the owners are not on vacation in LV or HK gambling away all the money that we spend there on the egg tarts, then I can get in and out of there in under 10 minutes!\n\nYou know those little \"fresh doughnut\" neon signs at KK, this place doesn't need that, because the egg tarts are coming out ALL DAY LONG. I don't know where they come from, probably upstairs, but it could be heaven for all I know. A little chinese grandma picks up the phone screams something in cantonese, and a couple minutes later, more trays of this holy goodness appears. \n\nMuch like the doughnuts at KK, when you leave the store, and before you get home, you must eat at least one of these, while they are still hot. The egg part is amazing, its not too springy, its not overcooked, the texture is creamy and just right. The shell is just ridonkulous! Its a flakey golden basket with a single mission in life, to contain all the eggy awesome that you are about to devour!\n\nThe egg tarts are larger than you'll find in most places, and I fully intend to continue buying these my the multiple dozen, but the little chinese boy inside me just can not get over how much each of these things cost.\n\nHow much does it annoy me?

We honestly didn't know what to expect since we're from Monterey Park and we literally eat egg tarts all the time lol! Like was it possible for these egg tarts to be THAT GOOD?! We decided to give it a shot. First off, the wait here sucks. We literally waited in line for almost 2 hours.... JUST FOR EGG TARTS! Jesus Christ, I can't believe there were so many people waiting in line. We witnessed so many people leaving the lines and also some people who literally waited in line that long just to order ONE FREAKING EGG TART. WTF!!! I wanted to give up so badly, but I figured since we had already waited for a long time and since there were so many people waiting, there HAD to be a reason why it was worth the wait. Once we finally got to the front of the line to order, we ordered one dozen egg tarts, which is $23.95. I've never seen such expensive egg tarts but I mean, we had to give it a shot. The workers were super friendly and packed our egg tarts very quickly! The reason the wait is so long is because they are constantly baking fresh egg tarts + other pastries, and that's the main reason I'm rating this place a 4-star on Yelp. The egg tart itself was pretty good, but I'm not sure if it was worth an almost 2 hour wait. There was definitely a lot more egg in the custard than most places, so you are getting your money's worth in a way. The filling was the right amount of sweet and the crust was nice and flakey. I don't know if I could exactly say \"it melts in your mouth\", but it does taste pretty good when you eat it when it's fresh & warm!

Whoa.  How could I have forgotten this gem?\n\nI decided to try one of their famous egg tarts as well as their old wife cake.  Luckily for us, we were told that in a few minutes a fresh batch of the egg tarts would be coming out of the oven.  Talk about good timing!  The egg custard was light in color and texture, very creamy, and wasn't too sweet or too egg-y.  The crust was flaky and rich and oh so good!  Were they good?  Yes!  Where they the best I've ever had?  No, I'm sorry to say.  I've had some that were slightly better, but these are really good.  Are they worth waiting in line for?  Yes.\n\nThe old wife cake is pretty good.  The melon inside was just the right amount for the size of the cake.  The crust was light, tender and flaky.  Let's get real here....only lard can produce something this well made.  This was the lightest version of this pastry I've had in a long time.  Usually it's heavy, dense and the crust is a solid mass of dough.  This is definitely worth trying.\n\nAside from speaking English and Cantonese, one of the ladies working behind the counter also speaks Spanish fluently (she spent some time living in South America).  The ladies were friendly and quite helpful.

The flakiness, the little sweetness in every bite, the simplicity and beauty of something that truly tasted as good as it looked. So when I learned about the Golden Gate Bakery in Chinatown where they specialize in my favorite treat, I knew I just had to have it.\n\nKnown to the Chinese as \"Dan Tat,\" egg tarts are popular any time of the year and are made in all sizes. GGB's version is larger than what I'm used to and not exactly cheap ($1 each), but they sure are delicious. After a surprisingly good first time experience at room temperature in a to go box, it was time for me to go there for a real shot at it.\n\nAfter a nearby meal while in Chinatown, I made my way over to the tiny little bakery where there was (of course) a line of C-town locals that formed right out the door. After asking a few in line what they were waiting for, the answer was an obvious one: Dan tat.\n\nAround 15 minutes of wait time, I managed to order a few egg tarts fresh out of the oven, along with moon cake and a bbq pork bun. Was it worth the hype? Sure. While the bbq bun didn't wow me, the  slice of moon cake were melt in your mouth good, and the egg tarts were fantastic. On a 1-5 scale, these mega egg tarts are an easy 5 - sweet, gooey, and holds shape regardless of how badly its stuffed into a box.\n\nI will be back. For awhile there, I wasn't so sure about the quality of Chinatown joints but I'm glad there is hope with little places like Golden Gate Bakery.", "author": "Jando S."}

I only came by three times between August and November since I don't live nearby, but store owners were on vacation each time. I actually suspect they've been on a continued break the entire 3 months. Honestly, call before you come. If they're on vacation, at least you won't waste your time on a profitless visit!\n\nI thought the last reviewer had interesting points. The first was, there are many great egg tarts  to try, so not eating egg tarts at GGB isn't life changing. One of the other egg tarts I've tried is from Sheng Kee. Maybe they have more than one type? Or maybe they are different at different Sheng Kee stores? Because the one I tried in Cupertino was very much in the same style as this one with the eggy middle and buttery, flakey crust. Sheng Kee actually makes really good egg tarts by the way. Good amount of sweet and the crust is well-baked/not too thick/thin. I also tried a new kind of egg tart though at a bakery in LA, it's a Macao style egg-tart with a harder/more densely baked crust. Also very good. So if GGB is vacationing, be happy that there are many other egg tarts to try elsewhere!\n\nI think what does separate Golden Gate Bakery's egg tarts from other good places like Sheng Kee is basically that they put more sugar in the egg yolk part and more butter in the crust. The crust at Golden Gate Bakery is super, super flakey, like a great croissant. When I bite into a Golden Gate Bakery egg tart, my mouth isn't just satisfied, it does an extra dance. It's that sensation that comes when a taste is very strong, probably on the edge of being too much, but has perfectly balanced itself on the yummy side of that line.\n\nAlso, I think their big peanut butter cookies and their lao puo bing are good too.\n\nTHEY JUST NEED TO BE OPEN SOMETIMES.\n\nAlso, their egg tarts are expensive for egg tarts: I think someone told me $1.75 now per tart?

It's somewhere in the middle between a Portuguese Egg Tart and a the pie bottom one.  A Portuguese Egg Tart is a smaller egg tart that has a light, crispy, flaky crust, custard and is browned over on top to make it a little sweeter, almost like a creme brulee top.   The pie bottom one is larger, with custard (unbrowned), in a pie like crust... harder, not flaky.  The Golden Gate Bakery Egg Tart is full sized with a crispy, flaky crust, but not as light as a Portuguese Egg Tart.  Best eaten fresh and warm in front of the bakery, but if you pop them in the oven at home at 300 for 12 minutes, it's like fresh baked goodness all over again.  \n\nCoconut Macaroons ($6 a dozen, $3 a half dozen) - An underrated star, I consider these equally as good as the egg tarts, but way less hyped.  Shaped like a large kiss drop, light, airy but a tad moist inside, and they have a fun crunch that holds, even if you choose to eat them five days later.  \n\nSome swear by their Almond Cookies... I've never had them.  They also sell various Moon Cakes.  With or without yolk, double yolk, mixed nut, red bean, green bean, etc. There's about 10 varieties and then you can choose with or without yolk in the middle.    \n\nThere is always a line outside.

We wandered around a little bit, and then we found Golden Gate Bakery pretty quickly - even with all the booths in the festival, the line into the bakery for the fresh and piping hot egg custard tarts was one of the longest! We quickly got in line, which was comparable to the line at Bi-Rite, and finally got in the bakery after about 25 minutes. \n\nThe inside of the bakery is super cluttered. You can't even go inside half the bakery, because it is so full of stuff (boxes, bags, junk (for lack of a better word)). The bakery case is in front, and features all the goodies, but you have to request the egg custard tarts, which I am assuming are being baked off and were not out yet when we were there. There was probably no time to refill the egg custard tarts in the case!\n\nWe ordered six egg custard tarts, two egg custard buns, and banh bo (not sure what the English term for it is, but it's like a sponge-y white rice-flour-based cake). We also got some vanilla sponge cake with pineapple jelly in the middle. I should have gotten some almond cookies, but we were so distracted. \n\nThe egg custard tarts were so flake-y, crisp, and perfectly sweet (but not too sweet), while the actual egg custard still retained the egg taste but sweet and delicious. There's no way to describe it. The custard is still slightly jiggly but the outside tart shell is perfectly crisp. Pretty cool. I love the darkened lightly burnt crust on top, yum. Truly the best egg custard tarts I've ever had. \n\n$1.40 per tart, which isn't too bad, considering that macarons cost about $1.50 at least for a tiny cookie the size of your thumbnail. Definitely worth the schlep into Chinatown for these! Be sure to look inside and know what you want, the line is long, and people are impatient!\n\nP.S. The tarts are often very hot and fresh! They are perfection in this cold nippy San Francisco air.", "author": "Anh D."}

If you love your egg tarts with a souffl\u00e9 consistency, then here's the 49ers of egg tarts for you. Skinny next to nothing crust with a whole lot of airy-eggy goodness shining through. The Raiders (Tao Yuen) holds a soft spot for me, not just for childhood purposes but the idea of a tart having two essential elements: A nice core ingredient (in this case a panna cotta like gelatinous texture) with layers of thick flakey crust holding the contents.\n\nI prefer the latter and after hearing (and tasting) these overpriced mini treats ($1.50+ for each egg tart and the cream bun was a dollar). Ended up spending almost $15.00 of less than a dozen with a cream bun. As opposed to across the bay, it's a few cents cheaper and the quality makes all the difference.\n\nI'm giving this place a 2.5 solely on lack of accessibility, wait time, pricing and quality of product.

Fate would have me in the area this past Friday so I thought I would finally give it a try. \n\nThe first thing I notice about this bakery is that they run it like a drug operation. The lights were off, the doors were locked, and a sign was posted saying that they were closed for vacation. A winding line was forming outside. I thought they were closed, but after a few minutes, I noticed an old woman unlocking the door from time to time to accept cash only for freshly baked boxes of dan tat (ordered 1-2 dozen at a time). It took a good half hour to get a batch since it seemed like they were only producing a couple dozen at a time. If that's not shady, I don't know what is. \n\nThe dan tat were piping hot and as fresh as could be. As I bit into one, I realized what all the fuss was about. The crust was perfectly flaky, the custard was silky smooth and not too sweet. They made a believer out of me.

The hype is real.\n\nThe crust supporting this large tart is thin yet incredibly flaky. The pale yellow egg custard middle is cooked to perfect consistency. The eggy flavor is pronounced and complemented by a subtle sweetness as opposed to other places where sweetness is all you seem to taste. It's an egg tart, not a sugar tart. \n\nAt $1.40 a pop (cash only too!) it's not cheap. But it's worth every penny. And the lines out the door they have every single day throughout the day is a testament to that.\n\nI really give this place 4.5 stars, docking half a star simply because they seem to close shop whenever they feel like it. Of all the times I go to SF, it's only been open during 60-70% of those trips.

For those going on Yelp to find out what's good in SFO - be warned - DON'T LINE UP for this! If the line is short (as in 2 to 3 people tops ahead of you) then go for it. But otherwise look away and walk the other direction.  If you're still going to be a sucker and line up anyway, make sure you have enough cash. They are CASH ONLY. We spent $35 on a dozen egg tarts and two moon cakes. People ahead of us paid $75 and $150 albeit they had 3 or so boxes of moon cakes and egg tarts on hand.\n\nIf you are from Calgary, just eat at the Grand Central on Center Street. They have the EXACT same egg tarts minus the hype and the wait. \n\nIn fairness, the egg tart and moon cake were not bad, they were in fact good. But not good enough to wait in line for... honestly we waited for almost 3 hours in line for this and it's NOT (emphasis on NOT) worth it. I would line up 10 minutes tops (15 would be pushing it) for these. \n\nGood things: Food was good but nothing to call home about. Certainly nothing to line up for whatsoever. Egg tarts were cheap at $18 per dozen or $1.50 per piece. Allegedly, at least according to the locals waiting in line,  the savoury treats were even better than the egg tart - I can't say as they were not available that day. You make new friends waiting in line. \n\nBad things: Service sucks! Did I mention yet that the line moves slower than molasses???! Inside, they literally write your receipt down on paper - why they can't make the process more efficient beyond me.  As in think of the most inefficient place you've ever been to, multiple the slowness by 7, and that would still be faster than the service here. Moon cakes were expensive at $7-$8 per piece (yes, per piece as in like one hockey puck). And to rub salt into our wounds, it turned out we were lining up for savoury pastries that weren't even available that day, and they had no warnings that  these were not available.The biggest delays were they were pretty much baking things to order (once they run out, decent bakeries will let you know. This one will actually bake things as people order and trap you into waiting until you have no choice but to walk out with something in a pink box anyway). One more bad thing, cash only. \n\nI wish I listened to the guy here who commented that \"life is short\" to be wasting time on this. I feel so embarrassed we spent that much time waiting... It's a trap were you go \"I've been here 30 minutes already\", \"I've  been here over an hour\", and 3 hours later you are just leaving the store.", "author": "Carla A."}

So, safe to say, Golden Gate's egg tarts have landed themselves a 4.2 star in my book. The egg taste was not too overpowering and smelly, and the crust was flaky, but not too crispy. Also, the egg tarts were not too sweet. I personally like my egg tarts to be a little bit more flaky and crispy.\n\nAn egg tart here costs around $1.25 a pop. I believe a dozen is somewhere around the $15 ballpark. A tad bit pricey for an egg tart and this place is a little over-hyped IMO (expect lines for this bakery to be out the door), but I guess it's something you've definitely gotta try if you've never had an egg tart before.\n\nGolden Gate is located in the heart of Chinatown, so prepare to fight for parking and having random people pop out, crossing streets left and right as if standard traffic rules didn't apply. Is it worth the insane and overly-cautious driving? Eh....... we'll see if I decide to return again.\n\n** Note: Egg tarts may not be for everyone.

After this amazing lunch, we decided to walk it off and strolled through the streets of Chinatown.  As we are walking, we spotted a long line waiting at a bakery.  Of course we stood on line and asked questions later,\n\nTurns out this line was a wait for what's considered some of the best Egg Tarts aka Dan Tat around.  We waited and joked and laughed with some of the people waiting and by the time we were at the counter we were well prepared to order correctly (images of Seinfeld Soup Nazi were floating in my head).\n\nOnce in this small, wonderful smelling happy little bakery it was amazing to simply watch the hustle and bustle of the staff running around taking orders.  As we are ordering, there are constant fresh sweets flying out of the ovens and into their pink bakery boxes.  They even cut two flaps in the boxes to let the steam vent, that's how fresh this is.\n\nWe ordered 6  Dan Tat's and a few rice cake pancakes as well as a few macaroons.  The pancakes and macaroons were sold out with another batch coming in about 10 - 15 minutes, Soooooo, what to do while waiting for 15 minutes when you have a box of Dan Tat's in hand, WE ATE THEM!!!   I have had egg tarts before and as a baked good they are generally delicious, these were incredibly delicious.  Flaky warm crust, hot and creamy sweet egg custard filling and a somewhat firm texture across the top of this 2 inch beauty!  Was it worth the 20 minute wait, definitely!\n\nAfter 15 minutes and a so much happiness in my mouth and stomach, it was time to return for the pancake and macaroons.  I skipped the entire line, found the sweet nice lady behind the counter (spoke perfect English) and walked out with two pancakes and two macaroons. \n\nFirst up, the pancake.  It is a mochi type texture with a sweet filling.  Absolutely delicious, a bit chewy sort of like taffy and in all a great intermezzo to the macaroons.\n\nThere are so many reviews that mention the Dan Tats and I agree they are wonderful, however, the Macaroons may have been one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth!  Fresh out of the oven, these sweet small magical concoctions are little bits of heaven that melt in your mouth!  I have never had a warm,right from the oven macaroon.  Whatever you do, do not leave there without a half dozen of these. \n\nI can not wait to be back in San Francisco again, this bakery will always be on my list of places to stop by when in town!", "author": "Adam K."}

Maybe because it was around 7pm and they sold out of other stuff.  The glass cases are blocked by the line of people in front and I had no idea what they were selling until it was time to order.  The prices are also unlisted and for $1.35 for a sticky rice ball, it was pretty pricey as far as Chinatown bakeries are concerned.  \n\nService was standard for Chinatown, which is not saying much.  The sticky rice with red bean was good and the muffin thing I tried was pretty good too.  It tasted fresh and smelled good.  Maybe I'm not blown away because I didn't have the egg tart.

I always enjoyed it. But it was never anything special, nothing I'd go out of my way for.\n\nWas it the flaky, buttery crust? Was it the fact that my egg custard was freshly baked, steaming, and warm? Was it the line that wrapped around the outside and spilled across to the store next door that told me this place was legit? All the personal recommendations from trusted foodie friends? Maybe. \n\nBut above all, it was the egg custard filling itself. It's lighter than your standard egg tart. And this is surprising for me, someone who usually likes a denser, heaver dessert.

The reason why this place has such delicious egg tarts is because generally, the crusts are made with lard. I'm not sure if they've changed the recipe (and changed it to vegetable lard or butter), but I know for a fact in Chinese traditions, egg tarts (especially made with the delicious flake-y crust) is made with lard. Just an FYI. If I'm incorrect, please send me a message and I'll retract my opinion.\n\nLike other reviewers say, the egg tarts are amazeballs! My new favorite item is this coconut round thing with cake and cream. I am in love with it! The napoleon and the banana thing (don't know what it's called in english) is to die for! Even though everything is super expensive, I don't mind!\n\nOnly gripe I have is that they are CONSTANTLY ON VACATION! It's rather annoying...I tried calling once before heading over for my lunch and the phone line was busy. I thought...oh..ok...it's busy that means someone's there. NOPE! It was friggin closed! Ugh!\n\n****TIP****\nAs with any place with a lot of hype, best time to go is the down time. I usually like to go around after lunch....so around 1 on a weekday. The lines are pretty tamed around then.\n\nLove this place. My coworker and I have had a running joke for about.....a month or two where everytime we see each other, we go...\"dan tat?\" Because we KNOW this place is closed and there would be no way in heck we'd be able to get one =(", "author": "Denise L."}

I guess it really depends on how you like your dan tats. And this place is definitely the place to get your dan tat/custard tart/egg tart craving!\n\nWell since Chinese New Years just passed this year, I figured the bakery would be open so I went by because the last three times I have attempted to go here, they were closed for vacation. Guess business is that good that they can close any time they want! So I guess that's a downside to this place. (minus one)\n\nBut other than that, I will gladly wait 30 minutes in line for some giant, hot, silky custard tarts! So good when it's freshly made, but still good when it isn't (just stick it back in your oven or eat it cold). The custard tart isn't too sweet, just a perfect texture that melts in your mouth. The crust is kind of oily and flakey, but nothing wrong with that. One bite, and you'll get crumbs from the crust but I think the important thing is the giant yellow center! \n\nIt's 1.25 for one (pretty reasonable) and 15 for a dozen.

My feening for the taste of potentially the best egg custard I'd ever tasted grew bigger and bigger as the days went by.. \n\nThen finally, FINALLY, I went on a day where they happened to be opened and lord oh heaven the line was only a handful of people out the door.

When I think of them, I think of soft crusts (not in a good way) and cold, dense, eggy custard. Despite my inherent bias, one bite into the egg tart at Golden Gate Bakery completely changed my mind. The egg tart was warm, fresh out of the oven. The crust was delicate and flakey, somewhat like a napoleon. The egg custard was soft, silky, and not too sweet. It was by far the best (non-portuguese style) egg tart I've ever had, and the first I have actually enjoyed. After trying the egg tarts at Golden Gate Bakery, I can now say I am an egg tart fan.   \n\nMy Advice\n1) Expect a line - Don't expect to get in and out of there quickly. \n2) Buy more than 1 - you won't regret it.  \n3) Bring cash. No cards accepted. \n4) Speak up when it's your turn. It's a mad house in there. Don't expect other customers will politely make sure you've been served first.\n\n**UPDATE** \nI have docked a star for their unprofessional, unreliable hours. \n\nRecently, I wanted to serve GG's delicious egg tarts for dessert at a dinner party. On Fridays, they are supposed to be open until 8pm, but when I arrived at 6pm, they were inexplicably closed. Adding insult to injury, I had rented a Zip car explicitly for that trip. Very frustrating. (I ended up going to nearby AA Bakery for my egg tarts.) \n\nApparently my frustration is nothing new.

But since my family decided to go down the block for dinner, I tried asking the \"nice\" lady if I can get back in line (I was only out of the line about 2 minutes) She was so nice in telling me where to go for good foods while I was in line, but when I asked if I can get back in space, she said \"I think you lost your space\" aarrggg... B*tCh! But I guess I understand.. but the least she can do was ask how many I wanted and she can order it for me and I can pay her back. \nSo to make a long story short, the first night, I didn't get any. When I got up to the line they wouldn't take my order of 6 egg tarts, Minimum order, 2 dozens.(Apparently they had closed for 2 months to go back to Hong Kong, And that was the first night they opened, and they had very high expectations. Other days, I'm sure you can get 1 or 2 or 6 egg tarts)\n  Uhh, what?? They yelled at me for touching one of their bread on the counter that was covered with plastic bag, How the heck am I going to know if it's soft or what is it if I don't touch it.\nThe second night, we returned to Chinatown, This time it was less people in line, The ladies recognized me as I whisper to my mom to say that lady yelled at me last night and I yelled back.. lol.. Must be the magic of Mom, but since we had to wait for the egg tarts to be done baking, they ha long, friendly conversation with Mom and I. What a 300 degrees turn in customer service!\n\nParking sucks as most of you know. Best bet to go later in the evenings to see if you can find street metered parking.", "author": "Jennifer N."}

It is so worth the wait in line inside this small bakery, they are always busy and appear to be doing very well that they go on vacations all the time. The store looks really cramped and they have a bunch of racks and inventory crammed and all over the place, they have a small display area with their eggtarts, pastries- including cake rolls, custard cream pastries and a few others. \n\nThe eggtarts are slightly sweet to perfection, soo good especially when fresh and warm, they melt in your mouth and the yummy flakey crust gets everywhere so beware especially when eating these in the car! They called them \"top secret\" when my fiance called in to ask if they still had some. So now it's a joke when we order them. LOL!\n\nThe last time we were there, a couple of newbies came in and asked me and my mother-in-law what the commotion was all about. Of course we recommended the eggtarts and he ordered some and definitely agreed with the hype! Get ready to walk though, there's never any parking nearby at all!

The taste has been consistent on multiple occasions I have visited. Definitely is not as oily and the custard is warm, silky & smooth and the crust is deliciously flaky. These egg tarts cost around $1.50 which is a little pricey. Can't believe how the price has increased through out the years. This does not stop people from standing in line for up to one hour.

Their hours of operation are so inconsistent that I have no idea when they actually open and when they don't. This is my 3rd attempt trying to get this and finally I got to get it. They tend to be on \"vacation\" a lot. The second reason is the fact that we have to wait a long time to get the food. I understand that it's a little shop but seriously there were only about no more than 6 parties in front of me. Lastly their quality of their egg custard has diminished compared to the past while their cost per egg custard has increased to $1.50 each.

Golden Gate maybe 20 and they do all of them quite terribly.  I recommend avoiding all of them except the sandwich looking thing with egg custard.

Confused? Let me explain.\n\nIt was mid-afternoon on December 31, 2014 - New Year's Eve - and Chinatown was bustling as I had last remembered it, 16 years ago. I was visiting from out of town and my brother (who still lives in the city) had luckily snagged a parking spot somewhere on Clay St, so we proceeded on foot towards the Good Mong Kok Bakery, as we were curious about its high reviews on Yelp in the single-$ category. We arrived at about 2:45, purchased fifteen pieces of dim sum to go, but learned that the bakery had completely sold out of dan tat (the golden egg custard in a pastry crust).\n\n\"No worries,\" said my brother, \"I know a place where dan tat is their specialty.\" And so, with the aid of Google maps, we meandered towards Golden Gate Bakery. We must have walked by the bakery - a small store front wedged between two large shops - at least twice before we looked up from our phones to gape at bizarre scene in front of us. The Golden Gate Bakery was closed: the lights were off, the interior was dark, no one appeared to be inside, and there was a sign posted on the front door, \"Closed for Vacation.\"\n\nNonetheless, there were at least fifteen people waiting in front, standing in line along the sidewalk.\n\nMy brother and I looked at each other, shrugged, and got in line at the end. We couldn't see very well from where we were standing, but it appeared that there actually was someone in the store. This mysterious person would open the door just enough to extend a hand to accept some cash from customers at the front of the line, then close the door. A few minutes later, the door would open again to reveal a pair of arms stacked with flat pink cake boxes, wrapped in pine twine. The paying customers happily relieved those arms of said burden before quickly leaving, allowing the line of people to inch forward. With nothing better to do, we searched through the Yelp reviews on this store and noticed a trend: apparently, long lines aren't unusual at this location, and the shop tends to go \"on vacation\" quite often.\n\nBy then, there were at least seven people ahead of us and five more people had lined up behind us. As we neared the front of the line, we noticed the form of an older woman inside the closed shop. She didn't speak, but made eye contact with certain customers of her own choosing. Her silent gaze constituted an unspoken question, and the customers responded accordingly with their fingers. Some signaled \"2\", others \"4\". When she looked at us, we indicated \"1\". She nodded and walked away.\n\nSoon enough, the door opened again: the arms appeared with boxes, customers quickly divested those arms of aforementioned boxes, then said customers departed - allowing us to inherit our new position as Customer #3 at the front of the line. The older woman opened the door and spoke in Chinese Cantonese to the Customers #1 and #2. When she turned to us, she paused before uttering, \"Eighteen dollar, one dozen.\" Thus enlightened, we handed over a twenty-dollar bill, which she readily accepted before closing the door and walking away.\n\nNow, at this vantage point, we could see more clearly through the darkened glass: the shop resembled a narrow hallway and the back room was dimly lit, where we espied another older lady carrying a tray full of pastries. She came into the front of the store, assembled some cake boxes, and starting arranging the pastries in the newly constructed containers. Once the boxes were filled, she painstakingly hand-wrapped each box with twine; using a pair of scissors, she then cut four venting flaps in the corners of the lid of each box. Finally done, she handed the boxes to the first woman, before retreating into the bowels of the shop.\n\nThe first lady opened the front door again and began distributing the boxes. We accepted our package of one-dozen dan tat, told her to keep the change, and turned around to walk past the line of waiting people behind us. The two younger customers (who accepted their order of four-dozen dan tat) were merrily digging into their boxes to get at the lovely, golden goodness, which they then greedily crammed into their mouths. I'm sure they did that just to spite the others who were still waiting in line. And as we walked away, we heard someone else (who had just arrived) exclaim, \"Oh, but they're closed...!\" We grinned and proceeded along without comment.\n\nThus ended my first experience of purchasing dan tat at the Golden Gate Bakery. Was it good, you ask? Was it worth it, you inquired? And what of the dim sum at Good Mong Kok? All valid questions, dear readers, but that's another story altogether.", "author": "Alan H."}

As someone who loves trying great food and tries to be aware of food hot spots wherever I go, I haven't even heard of the Golden Gate Bakery until I was vacationing in San Francisco's Chinatown,mere blocks away from the place, and my sister came back with a whole box of the Egg Custard Tarts.\n\n\"I waited almost an hour for these\", she proudly and happily proclaimed while showing the family what's inside the box.\n\nLooking in, I saw some Egg Custard Tarts, or as us Chinese call it, \"Dan Tat\" and nothing else.  \n\nNow, usually, I wouldn't be too impressed or excited by seeing \"Dan Tats\" since I'm not the biggest fan of them.  I will eat them if I have nothing else to munch on but otherwise I would eat other stuff if I have a choice.  But hearing how my sister kept saying that are usually almost always lines that are half an hour or more.  And how the wait is usually made longer because every other person seems to buy boxes of them at a time, I was convinced I would regret it if I didn't try some before heading back to NYC.\n\nDAMN!!!!  THESE WERE AMAZING!!!\n\nI ate these while it was still warm, and it had just the most thin yet flaky outer crust, with a smooth,semi sweet, soft custard inside that is so moist that it still jiggles a little if you shake it.  Normally, I find most Dan Tat's crust to be too dry and thick for my preference and the custard to be more thicker and more firm.  I much rather prefer the way they make it here, and apparently so does everyone else on that long line.  I found out that many people take out a few just to eat it piping hot right outside the bakery.  This is done because the turnover rate of the tarts are so fast, that new batches are constantly being made and put out.  Eating it right outside ensures that you are possibly tasting them mere minutes after it was baked.  Now that is fresh.\n\nHell, my sister bought enough to last us the next two or three days during our trip, and even cold or reheated, these beats the pants off any of the fresh ho hum egg custards tarts that I've eaten in NYC or anywhere else that I've tried so far in the USA. \n\n It's the only Dan Tat that I've ever had a craving for.  Even now, after 3 months since I had them, I still think of them sometimes.  If you are in the area, I highly recommend you find a little time, get in line, and let this little bakery change your view of Egg Custard Tarts.  I know it did to mine.\n\nJust be aware that this place have very haphazard, random vacations days throughout the year.  There are many reports of them being close for days and even weeks without warning, leaving disappointed people standing in front of a closed gate with a handwritten note saying they are on vacation.  That's what happened to my sister's first attempt to eat here on a previous trip a year prior to this.  \n\nThis happens so often that there was even fan created websites and facebook pages to tell others if and what time they are open on any given day so people won't need to take a long trip there for no reason. Crazy, right?  \n\nUse the following links to see if they are open if you plan to head out here.\n\nweb page: http://www.is-the-golden-gate-bakery-open-today.com/\n\nfb page:  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Is-the-Golden-Gate-Bakery-Open-Today/394882013908745", "author": "Wing L."}

I lined up in front of the store expecting a long wait and surprisingly enough I was done with tarts in hand before my husband found parking (about 10 minutes). \n\nService is friendly and they aren't as rushed as I would have thought they would be. The ladies were pleasant and very efficient. I also got rice cake which was good...pretty much your run of the mill sticky rice pile. Not my favorite can you tell? My husband enjoyed it. The egg custard IS worth the wait. A warm flaky shell surrounds a rich delectable center of cholesterol laden goodness. Fabulous warm from the oven and equally as delectable reheated. \n\nIf you are in the area and particularly if you like custard you really should make a stop here. Skip the car and let your feet do the walking...it won't hurt after you eat a million calories in custard.", "author": "Tracie F."}

It's just sad but having to grow up between Hong Kong and San Francisco, you know Golden Gate is overrated, overpriced and not worth the wait. It is as close as the quality of egg tart you can get widely in Hong Kong, but it is nothing more than that because egg tart is a very common pastry in Hong Kong, it really shouldn't be this expensive. My parents used to get them for us occasionally until I had encountered an incident and realized how rude these people are, so they are not only rude to non-chinese speakers, they are in fact just rude. After that, I told my parents not to get the egg tarts from this place any more, it's not worth it just because they make egg tart a little better than other average Hong Kong Style pastries in San Francisco. Our city has developed quickly the past few years, there are more pastry stores out there, so go somewhere else to explore, I hope you will get a better experience.", "author": "Cindy C."}

So while my comments aren't anything that haven't been said hundreds of times before, let me just spell it out really nice and simple: the egg custard tarts (dan tat) and pineapple buns (bo lo bao) are ridiculously good. Like, orgasm-in-the-mouth, party-in-the-pants good. Yeah, I went there. And it's not hyperbole when I say that I haven't had an egg custard tart this good since I was in Hong Kong, and this just may have been the best pineapple bun I've ever had. \n\nThe egg custard tart has a perfectly buttery, flaky crust that is the perfect balance between being crisp, but not to the point where the whole thing shatters -- aka crust failure -- after the first bite. The silky smooth filling rounds out what just may be the epitome of the perfect egg custard tart.\n\nAs for the pineapple bun, I was actually kind of disappointed at first by the diminutive size; the bun is definitely smaller than your average pineapple bun. But as they say, size doesn't always matter, especially if you're talking about a pineapple bun whose bun component is the texture, consistency, and richness of a well-made croissant. Topped with a perfectly flaky and buttery shortbread-like topping, this is the pineapple bun that stands alone at the pinnacle of bun glory. \n\nSo even if you didn't read any of what I have written above, my take-home message is this: go to Golden Gate Bakery and order the egg custard tart and pineapple bun. Once you recover from the sheer ecstasy that you'll be feeling after having something so pleasingly delicious in your mouth (that's what she said), you will thank me.", "author": "Kevin C."}

I bought a half dozen egg tarts ($1.35 each) and a lotus paste mooncake (because I wanted to see if this bakery did other things well). The egg tarts were baking in the oven so I had to wait about 7 minutes for them to finish. No biggie, but I imagine that may be why the line is so long sometimes. \n\nSo, the service. A lot of people bitch about it, but really, what do you expect? The lady who helped me was very to the point, on the verge of abrupt, but she was in no way rude. She basically talked to me the way my mother (who I'm pretty sure loves me) talks to me. I really don't think they're trying to be rude, I think that's just the way it goes. They are very efficient and that may contribute to some of the behaviors other Yelpers have experienced\n\nRegardless, the tarts were SPECTACULAR. The custard was the perfect consistency and the crust was hot and soft but not without crunch. HEAVEN. I also tried the moon cake and it was pretty baller. One of the better one's I've had. Good to know they are a well-rounded establishment. \n\nAnyway, definitely worth at least ONE visit, otherwise you're missing out on a SF food landmark.", "author": "Carmen K."}

They put new trays in the oven as soon as they finish the first tray (and trays are empty in less than a minute), and the egg tarts take about 15-20 minutes to bake. Once, we got there right when they finished a tray and were told to wait outside, but as soon as they were done we got our egg tart and were on our way.\n\nHonestly, I've never had another one of their pastries.

Now that you need to feed the meters on Sunday afternoons means that it costs you more to wait in line. The other issue is just the ridiculous prices they're charging - about twice what other competitive bakeries charge. And of course the oddest thing is how they manage to be \"on vacation\" about every other time I walk by.\n\nIt's Chinatown, so you know the service is going to be an adventure.  I don't hold it against a place like this when the line becomes amorphous once you get to the counter and the person who waited behind you tries to jump ahead of you. I have had Chinatown clerks notice I was first and refuse to serve a line jumper ahead of me, so it's not as if they're not aware.\n\nSo in short, the sign that says \"The Best in Town\" (and wasn't this place shown in a BofA commercial with a banker repeating that line?) may be accurate. However, it's only marginally better than other places where you'll pay about half as much, where you'll only wait minutes rather than half an hour, and where they're probably going to be open. It's worth a try is you have the time and they're open. They're prices are high, but they're still pretty inexpensive treats.

A looooong line, which makes a u-shape on the street. It's cold. I'm in heels. Firecrackers are going off everywhere. My genuine excitement for amazing egg tarts outweighed all of these unfortunate factors! I wait patiently. About 20-25 mins later, we're inside the store!

How do they do it?? \n\nAnyway, we pay for our things and scurry back to the car so that we can sit & devour our goodies. My first impression of the egg tarts...meh. It was really hot and the egg custard was still sorta jiggly, but the crust was perfection. My boyfriend really really really loved his bbq pork bun though. I mean, he LOVED it.\n\nAt this point, we still hadn't eaten any dim sum so we walk a couple blocks to pick some up. 15 minutes later we're back at the car and my bf says \"I'm just looking to see if the line is any shorter\" In my head im saying \"are you crazy\" but what i actually say is \"if you wanna go back, im down\" like i said, he REALLY loved that pork bun. \n\nHere we are back in line. Still cold. Still in heels. But this time, it only takes 5 minutes before we're inside the store! Woohoo! And guess what! The sesame balls are ready!!! My favorite!!! This time we pick up: 3 sesame balls, 1 bbq pork bun, and 1 curry pork bun. \n\nI really like sesame balls, and these ones are awesome. Not super oily, crispy and chewy in all the right places, just the right amount of red bean filling. *drool*\n\nLater on that night, I had one more egg tart.

It was on my bucket list for over a year, so it was definitely worth the trip.\n\nAfter reading all the rave reviews on Yelp, I came in search of the famous egg tart. Save for the milky white filling and non-br\u00fbl\u00e9e surface, Golden Gate's version is a close substitute for the Portuguese egg tart. Its puff pastry case is crisp and flaky, yet does not crumble easily. Its custard is sweet, creamy and smooth with the right texture. Overall a delicious, fragrant treat that rivals any egg tart back in Hong Kong.\n\nLonging for more familiar Chinese treats, I bought a pineapple bun to try on my way home. To my pleasant surprise, Golden Gate's version was light and fluffy, and extremely crunchy in texture. Bakeries in Hong Kong seldom make buns as fresh as these nowadays, so I clearly hit the jackpot with this place.\n\nBottom line? Two thumbs up.

I waited patiently for half an hour as multiple customers formed a separate line, saying they had 'called ahead of time' and they were there just to pick up.

You'll probably be standing in front of me. \n\nI'm not generally a huge fan of egg tarts or eggy tasting custards, but this is just right. Ethereally light custard and very little egg flavor with a touch of sweetness, enfolded in thin layer upon layer of delicate, crisp, flaky pastry. They always come hot and fresh, and it's great when steam rises from the tarts when you take a bite. Had some damn good egg tarts in Hong Kong, and I'd say these are still among my favorite. \n\nTheir other pastries are also delicious. The mochi, rolled in coconut and filled with peanuts, is always fresh and soft with just the right amount of chewy resistance, and the right amount of sweetness. Their little curry filled savory pies are good, but kind of skimp on the beef and veggies in the middle. The red bean moon cakes when they have them are also delish, but on the oilier side. Had a barbecue pork pastry there once, but that was cold and didn't taste the freshest, so I did not repeat. \n\nI can't tell if speaking Cantonese gets me better or worse service. Maybe it's just because I understand the cartloads of sass being flung back and forth by the old ladies who work there, between themselves and at customers. It's usually pretty entertaining. \n\n**Tips**\n- Going on a weekday evening generally guarantees no lines \n- This place is cash only\n- Don't let the old ladies talk you into buying other pastries that you don't want - especially the large gummy looking ones - I was coerced into this once and did not enjoy the experience\n- If you get only one thing, of course get the egg tart", "author": "Selina K."}

The crust was flaky alright but it lacks the smell of butter. They probably didn't use it because butter is more expensive than say, shortening.

Sometimes I feel like their crust is too thin since the whole thing falls apart in my hand, but it really is the perfect ratio of egg custard and crust in my mouth.\n\nIf it's the weekend or a holiday, expect to wait in line along the sidewalk. Since the egg tarts have to bake, it could take a while. I would recommend going in pairs, so one of you can get that t-shirt that says \"my coldest winter was a summer in San Francisco\", or the Hello Kitty backpack.

In fact, if you're normally turned off by these \"occasionally\" gag-inducing yellow yolky monstrosities, then Golden Gate Bakery may even make you a convert.  It certainly did so for me!\n\nIt's because the \"warm fuzzies\" immediately start when you're thinking about your upcoming journey to this really old bakery, rumored to turn out the most delicious forms of this \"treat.\"  Momentum builds when you're walking down Grant Avenue, where you'll invariably see a line of people standing in the street.  When you near the non-descript store front, you will usually need to careen, through a \"somewhat\" politely waiting mass of people, as if these treats were free. The ladies who work the counter will enthusiastically greet, laugh, joke, and treat you as if they were your \"nice auntie.\"  Oh, and the prices are \"right\", being $13.80 a dozen and for just a single, $1.15. \n\nOverall, one bite of a Golden Gate Bakery \"egg custard tart\" will be just as mouthwateringly exciting as it'll be serene, and you'll immediately know that they take the \"flakiness of crust,\" to the extreme.  I mean, I didn't even like egg custards until I came to Golden Gate Bakery, and geez, now they're something that I am beginning to \"feen.\"  5 stars.", "author": "Luke S."}

The game was completely lopsided and the commercials were horrible. The only shining moment was Bruno Mars during the halftime show and the fact that I wounded up winning two squares from my office Super Bowl pool. The spoils of victory? $100.00 cash and egg tarts for everybody!\n\nAfter a nice lunch at the House of Nanking, I jaunted around SF Chinatown, like a tourist, to walk off the greasy goodness and prevent a pre-mature food coma. As I passed by Golden Gate Bakery, I am used to either seeing a huge line out the door or a metal gate signifying that they're closed (by the way, they are closed 'for vacation' way too often if you ask me, but if business is good and you can afford to do it, more power to you). But today, to my surprise, no metal gate and no line. I was like a deer in headlights, completely confused by what was taking place. Without haste, I bolted inside to order a quick dozen egg tarts to take back to the office. Other customers were equally surprised and we joked that we were in sympatico, one even walking outside to double check the awning. These egg tarts are simply the best in the Bay Area. Buttery, flaky pastry filled with the greatest mixture of egg and custard. At $1.40 a piece, they're a bargain considering an American bakery or patisserie would charge $3 or $4.

Thank you Yelp community!  You've helped me find some gems, the most recent being Golden Gate Bakery.  Not a tourist trap and nowhere near mediocre, some of the best Chinese pastries I've ever had!\n\nEgg Custard Tart: More than I could ever imagine!  Most egg custard I've had has been from a cart when finishing off dim sum.  Nothing can compare to these steaming masses of egg pudding in a crispy/flaking tart shell.  It is worth the wait behind the partially dirty non-velvet rope!!!\n\nSesame Ball: Lightly fried exterior with smoky toasted sesame seeds.  Loved that the chewy mochi part was very thin.  Bean filling was a little too dense for my tastes.\n\nMochi Pancake: Don't know the name of it, but it looks like a pancake made out of mochi with a bean/jam filling inside.  Was ok, but very chewy and sticky.\n\nLotus Tart: A golden hockey puck with nutty tasting lotus seed paste inside.  Great flaky exterior.  Much lighter than a moon cake.\n\nRed Bean Tart: Every bit as flaky as the lotus tart, but with a dense generous red bean paste center.  Somehow the red bean here tasted better than the bean in the sesame ball.\n\nCoconut Mochi: Freakin' amazing!!!  In the center were some hidden macadamia nuts which played so well with the coconut.  I instantly envisioned myself in a Hawaiian Chinatown near the ocean.  So tropical, so delish.\n\nMoon Cake:  A bit of a disappointment.  Most everything else blew away the competition.  This was about on par with the moon cakes from tin boxes, with a super salty yolk center.\n\nCitrus Popover: Don't know the name, but it looks like a popover and tastes like citrus, perhaps orange?  Airy like angel food.  Refreshing.\n\nMacaroon: When I first start biting into this I was like \"Crap, hard as a rock\".  I was too quick to judge.  The macaroon gave a bit and proved to be very supple on the inside.  Love the contrast of toasted coconut and soft coconut.  Might be the best coconut macaroon I've had!", "author": "Adam B."}

BUT in other words, maybe they are doing this on purpose to keep that long line outside like a club so it looks tantalizing lol\n\nFood, yes yes danta paradise, they were so soft but not mushy, pretty much the most perfect dantas ever. I got some moon cakes too though they were on the expensive side but they were pretty amazing too. You could tell these weren't no normal store bought mass produced items.", "author": "Jimmy C."}

I was not going to be late for my dinner reservation.  \n\nI finished dinner and walked back to my car located in Union Square and once again passed by GGB.  This time, the store looked like it was about to close with their iron gates in front.  There were a few people inside the store still waiting.  I looked at my watch.  It was 8:15 pm and the store was closed.  There was a little old man guarding the door not letting anyone inside.  I thought I would give it a try and ask if they would be willing to sell me some egg tarts.  The man asked how many I wanted.  I told him that I wanted two and he told me to wait.  He told me it depends if they had any leftovers.  Fifteen minutes went by and he let me in.  The lady inside placed two, hot egg tarts in to a white paper bag.  I paid $2.50 and I was on my merry way.\n\nWhen I reached my car, I couldn't help but eat it right away.  It was still warm.  The crust was light, flaky, and buttery.

The secret to the perfect tart is the flaky buttery crust. \n\nLet's get back on track - the coconut tart! Its crust is just as flaky as their egg tarts. The only difference is what's inside of them. Instead of an egg mixture, there's coconut in them. However, Golden Gate's coconut tart is like none of the other coconut tarts I have ever tasted. It is packed with coarse coconut flakes on top, and an eggy-pudding-like texture on the bottom. It's similar to a bread pudding, but less moist.

There's something about their flaky crust and soft eggy filling that I can't find in egg tarts from other places. I always get half a dozen, refrigerate them, then reheat them in the toaster oven when I want to eat them. (But they almost always happen to be on vacation when I am craving an egg tart, in which case an egg tart from someplace else will have to suffice.)\n\nAnother item I frequent is their char siu so - it's long and rectangular, and the pork filling is flavorful and is actually pork and not just fatty pieces! (I like non-fatty char siu. Others might find theirs too dry and not saucy enough. For this reason, I avoid their char siu baos.)\n\nI have also tried their coconut tarts - I like it, but disappointingly, it's not all coconut. The top layer is coconut, middle layer is coconut mochi (?), and it all sits inside the same flaky crust as their egg tarts. For a coconut lover, I think the coconut macaroons are a better choice than their coconut tarts.\n\nLastly, I love their mooncakes! Come mid-autumn festival season, they sell only 2 things - egg tarts and mooncakes. They make the best coconut mooncake because it's chock full of mixed nuts in between desiccated coconut! Their winter melon mooncake also incorporates nuts! I otherwise eat white or dark lotus seed paste mooncakes, and I especially like theirs because of their skin and I find it not as sweet as packaged ones.", "author": "Christina C."}

FAIL. \n\nAn who, we came here during the Moon Festival. What a delight. Another chaotic sight of SF. Usual business. This time we were able to pay for parking and find the famous bakery. We waited in line for over an hour.\n\nAfter all the fuzz and the roar and calamity over the egg tarts, we finally were able to snatch a dozen for ourselves. Not to be an asshole, but they werent all that and a bag of chips, but I liked them.\n\nI was let down. If something is being over hyped then my expectations go right along with them as high as the sky. Unfortunately, that was not reflected in my taste buds. Customer service was not great---they were all in a hurry and rushed to get people in and out, which is understandable, but they were mildly rude and terse with their words. Alright, so I let that pass.\n\nAfter an hour and 20 minutes of waiting, we were finally in, paid, shared a dozen with my gal pal, and shoved one in my mouth. They were yummy, but not overwhelmingly delicious. I've tasted better desserts at a Mexican bakery. They were simply OK. \n\nAnd if that makes you angry, then go suck on an egg. My advice: if you really want one, go to SF when there is no line (who the hell knows if this ever the case!) or make someone else wait for you because you can probably get a same quality egg tarts somewhere else. Come on, theres bound to be some place else.\n\nOh, the moon cake was actually pretty good.", "author": "Noel G."}

But I'm not knocking theirs by any means - I just don't think it's worth the line.\n\nNow that it's Autumn Moon Festival, I actually do like their black bean mooncake with 1 egg yolk, but their pineapple one was actually pretty disgusting.  It didn't taste anything like what I thought it would (I imagined it to be a little slice of pineapple shortbread pastry heaven.. and if you're Chinese you know exactly what I'm talking about).  Instead, it had a highly artificial flavor with zero real pineapple flavoring.  Minus one star.\n\nOh, and despite the huge long line, old Chinese ladies were pushing their way in and just ordering ahead of everyone else.  Disorganization and chaos ensued.

Let's start! Golden Gate Bakery (GGB) is located in the heart of the clusterf*ck we all know as Chinatown. It's kind of crazy. I've been to the Chinatown in LA, NY and SF. They're all nuts - a lot of slow moving people walking the streets. So if you're in the rush to get somewhere, get ready to move at a snail's pace while maneuvering through the human traffic. \n\nIf you're walking to GGB (I highly recommend this rather than driving there and attempting to find parking), you'll instantly notice a long ass line before approaching the store. When my girlfriend and I got there, the line was about 30 people deep which translated to a 20 minute wait. There are three things I'm not a fan of: 1) Slow internet, 2) Traffic and 3) Lines! Can you see the trend? I hate anything that requires me to wait. Yeah, I'm not the most patient guy in the world, so you can imagine how god awfully irritated I was when I was forced to wait in line because Sandy wanted to get her hands on a box load of egg custards from GGB. WHOEVER INVENTED THE LINE NEEDS TO DIE! (Chances are he/she already did.).\n\nEGG CUSTARD: Sandy got a dozen. It came in a pink box just like the ones you get at your typical donut shop. Just an FYI, she was j*zzing over these things the whole day (made me jealous). That's why we had to go. I didn't understand what all the fuss was about... until I tried one. Dude! It was actually pretty good! It literally blew me away. The make up of these egg custards spells something I would absolutely hate putting in my mouth. However, I was very pleased after my first bite. The flaky buttery crust played very well with the creamy and smooth custard. The actual custard part of it was the star - so decadent, so comforting and so good. Like the best Yelper I know (Cherylynn N.) said, the custard's texture is similar to panna cotta. She was also right about it being more milky than eggy which makes for a better eating experience. Photo cred to Cherylynn N. - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/golden-gate-bakery-san-francisco?filter_by_userid=True&select=v3wxIov6yVvs_FcQCdwc1Q&userid=eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg#v3wxIov6yVvs_FcQCdwc1Q\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving this place 4 stars is because even though I enjoyed the egg custard, I'm still not a fan. I personally wouldn't go back for several reasons. Mainly because the line is ridiculous and because, well, I'm still not the kind of guy who likes sinking his teeth into baked sweets. But if someone happened to offer me one, I'd totally eat it. \n\nEgg custard. Who would have thunk it?!?!", "author": "Bruce C."}

Egg Tarts are absolute favourite treat in the world as I love all that is custard and buttery pastry.\nThus the pilgrimage began. It was a demanding journey walking through the confusing streets, resisting the seduction of all the cute shops and fresh pork buns. When we found it we almost passed it since it's hard to the see the logo, it's just a tiny thing written in small print on a window. We ended up there around 6-7, not very busy, a lot of items were picked over but there was a lot of rice pastry and it seems they keep making egg tarts throughout the day. \nThere was 2 Chinese families(you know its good when other Chinese eat it!) before us waiting for the famed egg tarts. They just pulled it out of the oven and the families almost took them all. However we managed to get about 3. \n\nEgg Tarts-  When fresh out of the oven it's very delicate. They must use whole eggs and plenty of milk instead of the rich egg yolk recipe as the custard is light and jiggly and moist. Also it's very sweet. The buttery crust was crisp/salty and not over whelming however thin so it could not stand up to the generous custard. It really plays on that perfect sweet and salty combo.\n\nCoconute rice bun filled with macadamia- This is pretty much mochi or manju but I'm not sure if there's a name for it in Chinese. This actually turned out to be my favorite. Very sweet, the rice pastry was very very soft and melted in your mouth, complimented by the delicate coconut flavor and sweet macadamia mix inside it's definitely the perfect sweet treat. Also it's very cute covered with coconut flakes and a little frosting to make it look like a bunny. A good treat to bring to a friend. \n\n I've tried ALOT of different mochi and manju and egg tarts as I live in a highly Asian populated area and these are always my go-to at the bakerys I frequent. With that in mind this is DEFINETELY a place to hit! :D\n\nPS. if you don't know your way around it's pretty deep in Chinatown and if you enter from the dragon gate then it's straight down.

The place looks like someone's garage storage facility, but if you're churning out such damn good Chinese pastries, I'd be happy to have you serve it out of a cardboard box on the street. \n\nThe standout item that I'm sure you're very well knowledgeable of by now is their Custard Egg Tarts. I've lived in China and I've had Custard Egg Tarts all over the place, and I can swear on everything I hold dear that Golden Gate Bakery makes the best Custard Egg Tarts I've ever had. Better than anything I've had in China, better than anything I've had in any Chinese bakery or Dim Sum restaurant in California.\n\nThe trick to Custard Egg Tarts is to not make the custard part too sweet and to make the pastry part extremely flaky. Golden Gate has mastered this art. The custard has the perfect amount of sweetness and the pastry is unbelievably flaky. And the fact that they come out piping hot is the icing on the cake. Even after days of sitting on my kitchen counter, the lukewarm custard egg tarts are still better than most egg tarts out there.\n\nI've also tried the Curry Beef Tart and the Char Siu Pork Tart, both of which are delicious. But the main event of Golden Gate is definitely their egg tarts, which completely steal the show.\n\nOne downside is that they seem to always be on vacation. There have been many times where I'd make the trek out to get a custard egg tart and I'd find out that they're closed for vacation. I guess when you're this damn good, you really can't care less if you take time off whenever you feel like it.

After patiently waiting our turn, we finally made it into the store. They don't have the typical variety of pastries that you might find in a Chinatown bakery, but what they offered looked delicious. From word of mouth and past yelp reviews, the egg custard tarts are apparently the items to get. I ordered two egg custard tarts and brought them home to share with my fianc\u00e9.

Lots of great reviews and a high rating and I'm in like Flynn.\n\nI really wished I had taken notice of the highlight to buy the egg custard, but went for the moon cakes instead, which I also had read somewhere were pretty good. At first it's just me and one other woman in there, but soon it's swarmed with about 10 other people in a tiny aisle and showcase of the day's baked goods. Since it took me a second to decide what I wanted, I stood back and watched what everyone else got. When it was finally turn I asked questions about the pricing of the moon cakes and one of the ladies behind the counter pointed to the paper list taped to the counter, \"Right here. It's all here.\" Now I have no idea about moon cakes, but I saw that they ranged from about $5 to $6.70 or something, each.\n\n I got a perfectly baked green tea moon cake. Not thinking it would be more than the range I've just seen from the pricing list, I go with it. The green tea cake's price was not listed. It came up to $7.70 I was so confused, but the woman was insistant, \"yah, yah it's right here\" frantically pointing to this list. I did not see the green tea moon cake listed on there, so who knows if that's what the price was. I felt so rushed! This really irked me, but since she had already put it into a bag and my mentality being of both \"Well, I'm on vacation,\" and \"I don't want to be shot dirty looks by this lady,\" I pay up. \n\nI hurried out into the street and thought to myself, \"This better be worth it...\" The outside was perfectly golden brown with a bit of a shiny glaze on the outer bread part. Inside was really dense, light green, and some sweetness. I loved its flavor and texture, but because of its denseness I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it in once sitting and it was right before dinner.

Six to be precise. And a custard-filled pineapple bun. The tarts were served warm and I immediately tasted one as soon as I stepped outside. (And then ate another one after I was done.)  \n\nYes, they may actually be the best ones I've had. Definitely at least one of the best. BUT--are they FAR better than other egg tarts? Nah. First off, I've rarely had a bad tart as it's a basic staple of dim sum and Chinese bakeries that tastes pretty similar (delicious) everywhere. Main differences are whether it's a \"cookie\" or flaky crust (Golden Gate's is flaky, which I prefer) and how firm, yellow, and eggy-tasting the egg part is. Depending on your preferences, Golden Gate's may not even be your favorite.  \n\nGolden Gate's filling is actually not that eggy/yolky tasting given how hefty the egg part is. The filling is pale yellow and has a very fluffy, loose texture and light sweetness to it. Very very good. The taste is comparable to other great egg tarts I've tried, but it is unusual for the large amount of custard and the slightly lighter color and texture.  \n\nBottom line: Trek here if you are within a couple of blocks or you're an egg tart afficionado. But no regrets if you skip it in favor of one of the many bakeries and dim sum places in Chinatown. I would definitely go back to Golden Gate, but wouldn't wait more than five minutes for tarts.\n\nNote to DC-area folks: The egg tarts at Oriental East in Silver Spring--at least the Portugusese-style/burnt ones--are similar: tall, light, loose, fluffy custard with flaky crust.", "author": "Chesty L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-10-07", "description": "Prologue: \n\nI recently found myself with 17 hours in San Francisco.  I decided to throw hunger to the wind and use my time wisely--a shopping spree for fall was certainly in order in my books.  \n\nYes, that's right folks, my sole intention was to shop, I didn't care if my only meal that day consisted of a greasy slice of pizza eaten in haste on my way to Ross and Macy's.  I had made up my mind--I was going to shop and the foodie side of me was going to be compromised.  \nWhen I set out at 9am to the hotel lobby, the concierge told me stores dont open till 10. There goes my master plan.\n\nThen I remembered that Marc D had suggested going to Golden Gate Bakery and eating their egg tarts.  There wasn't any free wifi to be had anywhere I looked, but thank god for the dinky map I ripped out of the San Fran Where mag and my photographic memory of his message, (I remember seeing \"Grant\") I made my trek out for the grail of tarts. \n\nThe Tart\n\n*I cannot believe I'm standing in line for an egg tart*\nThe line up outside the door was insane.  Sure it was Autumn Moon Festival but the people in line were there for the Egg Tarts, not the moon cakes.  The bakers downstairs could not make them fast enough.  As soon as one tray came up, it was taken away by one customer who had ordered 2 or 3 dozen of the things.   Sheesh,  should I abandon my post and go to the mall? \n\nI waited.  and waited.  and waited.  The lady in front of me said she waited an hour last week and to counter that instead of getting the one dozen she came for, she got 3 dozen to pay for the long wait. \n\nFinally it was my turn.  I ordered 4 egg tarts and 2 moon cakes (one lotus seed and one red bean-NO YOLKS!)  The tarts were place in a white paper bag piping hot and not sealed to let out the steam.\n\nAt 1.19USD a pop they are not cheap, but man, are they delicious!\nThe crust is thin yet flaky like those crisco commercials with the fork flaking at the pie crusts. The custard was still warm and very sweet.  There was a thin layer of clear sugary liquid that seeped out of the custard while baking and was resting on top of the jiggly tart goodness.  The ratio of crust to custard was perfect. \n\nEpilogue: \n\nI had already devoured 2 of the Egg tarts by the time I was barely 2 blocks away from the bakery.  In my defense, it was already 10am and I needed to speedy gonzalez it to the stores before I was back on the plane in a few hours. \n\nNext time I'm there I'll make it a point to get at least 1 dozen of them!\n\nPS:  the moon cakes were good too, but pricey!\nPPS: if any of you know how to tag yelpers in reviews, please fill me in!", "author": "Yoony P."}

I am of course referring to the famous Egg Custard Tart of Golden Gate Bakery that everyone and their mother goes absolutely bonkers for. Well, most of us who live in the Bay Area anyway. Well, most of us who are Asian in the Bay Area...I mean, chances are, if you're reading this review on Golden Gate Bakery, you're not from 'round these parts...and if you are, you're living under a solid mass of granite 'round these parts. Not to say you should feel bad for not having ever heard of Golden Gate Bakery, I myself have only heard about it from my beautiful girlfriend just about a year ago...but I'm from Arizona, so I get to play that card, which is a nice card to play. Though if you really have not heard of Golden Gate Bakery and want to try it awesome contents, BE FOREWARNED: They are notorious for closing their doors randomly for extended periods of time. So much so that there is a group on the 'Book called: Is Golden Gate Bakery Open Today? (and yes I do follow that group) that lets you know if the bakery is open on any particular day. Anyways, on to the more productive less-ADHD part of the review:\n\nGolden Gate Bakery is vastly well known for their Egg Custard Tarts, as you can probably tell from the other reviews on the GGB (pardon the Bay Area-esque acronymization). Their Tarts are very famous because they are (imho) not too sweet, yet not in the least bit bland, and the pastry part of the tart is very soft, yet flaky at the same time. The custard portion of the tart has the consistency of freshly mixed homemade pudding, and believe it not (Ripley eat your heart out) still holds the same consistency after being refrigerated over night. The tarts are best when fresh, which means you (ctrl+i)* should  (crtl+i)* eat them right after you walk out of GGB, but you can toast them the next day or even 2 days after purchasing. I am unsure if they are able to keep longer under refrigeration, as I have only kept them at most 2 days after the initial purchase...and believe me, 2 days means I know how to show Buddhist-like restraint. I recommend preheating your toaster oven at about 350, then throwing no more than 2 custards in the oven for about 2-3 minutes, in my past experience that worked super well, remember to throw in  sheet of foil under the custards. The custard are tastiest when warm, though just last evening my better half and I did the unthinkable and ate the  tart cold, and man...it was still wicked amazing.\n\nThe custards are not the only amazing thing that GGB offers, and you should feel ashamed for even thinking that...tsk tsk...obligatory 3rd tsk. We also tried GGB's beef curry pastry, chicken curry pastry, and their Wife Cakes (haha...wife cake...). GGB's curry meat pastries are super tasty, though be cautious, if you eat them fresh from the bakery they are freaking HOT, I mean they contain curry (which is part liquid) which can be molten hot magma (admit it...you read that in Dr. Evil's voice...didn't you) in your mouth. Imagine biting into a Hot Pocket the second you remove it from ye olde nuker...instantaneous 3rd degree roof-of-mouth burns. The pastries can come off as a bit salty, but I still find them delicious and very addicting. The wife cake was ok as well, though I feel that it left more to be desired. \n\nPlease note that since the egg custard tarts are the fan favorite, there are times that GGB does not make enough (if at all) of the other offerings to facilitate the necessary baking of the tarts. I gave GGB 4 stars, not because of the quality of the food, but because of it's typical Chinatown service: get them in, get their payment, get them out. Being a kid of the 'burbs, I can't bring myself to rock 5 stars to any place with anything short of impeccable service.\n\nAll in all, the GGB is a great place to grab a not-so-quick pastry (typical wait-line is about 10-25 minutes), and if you're ever wondering about the hype, it is most surely worth the drive and wait. 10/10 would continue to eat their deliciousness again.\n\n* I know that physically typing the command for italics doesn't make my font appear in italics...but admit it...you liked it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR? ;)", "author": "Julian N."}

You don't have to wait in line for an hour or pay $1.40 for one egg custard!   While making egg custard is somewhat an art, it isn't so unique that other bakeries haven't perfected the art!  You just have to explore other bakeries in Chinatown & try them!  Most of them make them.  Some better than others.\n\nMy favorite is the bakery on Stockton & Jackson St (next to Republic bank).\nTheir egg custard is light, jello like, not too firm that it is eggy and never too sweet. eThe crust is golden brown & so flakey.  YUM.  I prefer the crust to be golden brown.  They charge $1.00 for an egg custard!\n\nThe other bakery is across the street & it is good too.  Their crust isn't as brown as I'd like, but it's still great.  They charge .70 for a custard.\n\nThe best time to eat a egg custard is when it has cooled off. If it's hot or too warm, it'll just fall apart.  The egg custard has to set & firm up before you can truly enjoy the favors.  \n\nBTW - I don't have names of these places as they are in Chinese.", "author": "Marie E."}

Perfectly flaky crust and soft egg custard. If you can't eat it all in one day, put them in the fridge. They can last a while, although after a while the crust starts getting soft, so eat them as soon as possible!

Like the egg tarts, they had a nice flaky skin.\n\nIronically, when I came here the first time, the stand out ended up being their banana mochi. Nice and soft and chewy. Definitely try it out if you like mochi.\n\nSkip the sponge cake (dry and dense) and roast pork puff pastry.\n\nBefore you know it, you've just spent $30 at the bakery.\n\nMy only gripe is that of the 10 times I have been to chinatown, they've only been open 2 times.

However, I felt like I came during the worst season. Next week is the Asian \"mid autumn festival\" and EVERYONE  was FIGHTING.....FIGHTING to buy mooncakes. All that I want was just some egg tarts..but had to get in a very long line. A line that wrapped around the block. Yes..WRAPPED around the block. lol. \n\nI waited for a good 45 minutes. I talked to some grandpa/grandma while waiting and they indeed agree that these were the best in town. After the long anticipation...it felt like a golden moment when I finally got the opportunity to buy my egg tarts. I blew $50 with 6 tarts & 4 mooncake. I would say rather expensive but ppl were buying bulks and busting out alteast 2-3 benjamins. I heard some grandpa pleading to buy more but they were limiting. Talking about profit? Especially during these economic conditions. \n\nAbout my egg tart. The crust was very flaky and baked to perfection. It did have a golden touch. However, rather greasy. The egg custard itself was a light yellow color, warm and wasn't too sweet. Overall, I would say that they did taste different because you can actually taste \"the egg\" in the tart and not just food coloring with a mix of half egg and some kind of filler. A method rather typical for most dim sum places. The main difference would be that they use lard instead of vegetable oil? You can taste the greasy goodness. \n\nI would totally come here for egg tarts whenever I visit but it's not something that I'll crave and go head over heels about. They're different and pretty good but most dim sum seafood restaurant in LA will make the cut for our egg tart cravings. They're $1.15 a piece or $13.88/dz. NO DISCOUNTS. sighs.\n\nWell..since I was at it..I gave the mooncake a shot too. Bought one that was \"five nuts\" and the other 3 were coconut since moms' favorite was coconut. These mooncake run around $8-9 a piece. I have to say that the \"five nuts\" was surprisingly good. The crust/skin wasn't all too amazing since it was rather dry and didn't have too much grease. however the filling itself was awesome. It had a load of macadamia nuts, pumpkin seeds, sweet wintermelon, shreds of chinese preserved meat, almond, salty egg yolk and some other nuts which I cannot recall. It was the generous portion of macadami and almond that really blew me away. Those of you who has tried the typical \"five nuts\" should know that mooncakes from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan never includes macadamia or almond. Macadamia is one of the priciest nuts and is definitely a US local. \n\nThis place is insanely shabby and has only 2 tiny tables and like 4 chairs at max. Oh..I also grabbed a macaroon (chinese style) and it was ehh..nothing amazing.\n\nService was rather bad as the ladies work at a nonstop rate. Don't bother questioning of asking what they'd recommend. You'll most likely end up with a dirty look. Don't ask me why. lol. Can only be dumb once in a scenario like this.\n\n\n\n\nCrying in pain in my heart*", "author": "Susan T."}

The custard isnt as sweet as other joints but it taste just about right to me. the flakiness of the crust is what its all about. not much a fan of the cookie type crust other places make. This egg custard literally just melts in your mouth, No joke and no need to chew. On weekdays, the lines arent too bad here. i hear weekends are much worst.\n\nBasically, Im the type of person that DOESNT like to stand in lines for Anything. its not because im lazy, i just dont have the patience. But i'll give it up to golden gate bakery for their delicious Egg Custards. These lines dont fade me, plus i love chinatown.", "author": "Rudy R."}

These egg custards weren't amazing enough to flip me into an absolute awe that triumphs any previous lack of desire for egg custard.  But, they weren't bad either, and they were better than others that I have tasted.  So, it's worth the trip, especially for all the Chinatown tourist trotters.", "author": "Diane N."}

Better than L.A., better than Hong Kong, better than China (and yes I've had them at all of those places). For those who don't know, these tarts use the flaky butter crust (versus the old school hard crusts). A few caveats before you go:\n1) you have to eat them right then and there, burning your mouth with the creamy egg custard. 2) You cannot, should not, will not only buy one. Buy a dozen, share with friends. The egg custards reheat well, but ONLY in an oven. 7 curses on your soul if you use the microwave. 3) The store is always closed. They take like 10 vacations a year, I kid you not. So you take your chances. But it is o' so worth it.

I'd read all the reviews and was prepared for what was to come, but my goodness... It was mind blowing! I don't feel I need to say more because it's already been said.\n\nIf you're in Frisco, make sure you make a stop here. The wait can be long, but trust me totally worth it. Also some advice, make sure you eat the custard while it's still warm. It's good warm or cold but you really have to taste it while it's still steaming. And don't just buy one, you want to make sure you buy at least 2-3 per person. If you get more trust me no one will judge you. Yeah, they're that good!\n\nI would advise walking since it is Chinatown and parking may be a bit of an inconvenience.

These are not your run of the mill almond cookies that are too crumbly with their yellow dough and a stale almond pressed into the center. GGB's almond cookies have more class: a nicely sized three bite cookie with just enough almond flavor, a good clean tasting dough that hold together well with a nice balance of crunch and slight chewiness, plus a sweet sprinkle of toasted almonds. \n\nI bought a pack of them and my first bite reminded me of what almond cookies are supposed to taste like...

I figured, \"why not?\" and decided to make the trip over there to check it out. Turns out, this bakery had been closed for vacation for a while, and today was the first day they were opening! This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me, as I am from Boston, leaving to go home tomorrow, and I happened to show up at the bakery 15 minutes before they were planning to reopen. It was fate! After reading Yelp reviews, we came to find out that a long line is typical of this bakery, so we thought, \"no big deal\". We ended up waiting TWO HOURS until we got to put in our order for the egg custard tarts. People were buying DOZENS of these egg custard tarts! The system they had for taking orders was a little slow and weird. They didn't let anyone in the actual storefront; the lady would come out and take a few orders at a time. It took about 10-15 minutes to fulfill each order, the customers would pay, and then she'd move on to the next one. The lady running this whole show was super friendly and nice, but she is definitely not someone you want to mess with. After our super long wait, I finally tried the long-awaited egg custard tart.....\n\nIt was the BEST I've EVER had in my entire life.

And I work close by, so if the line is prohibitively long, I know that I can always come back another day.\n\nTrue, it is sad to want for delicious Chinese baked goods, and leave without.  But I do.  And no other bakery will scratch the itch.  Here is why:\n\nEgg Custards.\nI have these so often now, I have a point scale.  Occasionally my egg custard is a 10.  Generally it's between an 8 and a 9.  On bad days, it will be a 6 or a 7.  Every other egg custard I have had from other bakeries tops off at a 4.\n\nWhen they are at the top of their games the custards are,\nHOT - straight out of the oven, into my mouth, scalding as I eat the first one on the sidewalk\nFLAKY - with an outer crust that bursts into a million pieces as you take the first bite (there is no way to share one of these)\nCRISPY - a bottom crust that is burnished, and provides structure for the tart, and some resistance for the teeth\nUNBROKEN - cooked to the point of just setting, before the egg-protein bonds become too tight and scramble the custard inside (which is almost impossible to do without a water bath)\n\nEven when they are not hot, they are at worst warm.  And I love how they are less sweet than their counterparts at other bakeries.  Plus, the custard has a nice natural eggy color, and is not shockingly yellow, which is appealing.\n\n\nBut egg custards is just one of the many delicious sweet and savory treats you can experience at golden gate.\n\nMy other favorites:\nPineapple Bun: So soft.  So warm.  So comforting.  With a crunchy top.  Just had one today.\nCocktail Bun: Rich and sweet.  With filling and icing.  And warm.  And soft.\nMacaroons: So crispy.  Amazingly crispy.  Did you fry these? They are so good.  \nCoconut Tart: Like the egg tart, but with a mound of rich chewy coconut.  Think of it like a cookie in a pie shell.\nBaked Pork Buns: Tender, non-grizzly pork, in a salty 5-spice sauce, surrounded by rich sweet dough.  Melts in the mouth.

To a point that the egg almost float out (okay a bit exaggeration here but you get what I mean) and the egg, yea it's hot it has a strong egg smell but it is a bit on the watery side. Is it their signature way to make egg tart? I'm not sure, it's just way too soft. Yet the lines are getting longer and longer over the years, which I don't feel it is justified. And sometimes you crave for it you go there and the shop is closed.....

The only thing that separates them from other tarts? The unmistakable light, fluffy, flaky, crispy crust. And their secret in getting it that way? Pig fat oil. After learning that, I've definitely calmed down on eating their tarts.\n\nMy opinion? Over priced for what it is, but for out of towners or even non-asian people.. They would come back thinking it's worth it. Don't get me wrong, I still have a bunch of friends who come here for it and I also take friends that are out of town to come get one, but if you were a true San Franciscian, you would know that there are better places to get a good dan tat.", "author": "Jessica L."}

I'm not going to, but I'll try not too hard to hide my comparative disappointment.  We went there on a Saturday at around 3, and it had a little bit of a line.  The egg custard tart is this bakery's raison d'etre, and that's what let me down.  I noted that it was slightly over-baked (no big deal), but the separation of the 96 layers just isn't there!  The tart shell is meant to be a work of art, the testing stone of a Chinese pastry chef.  I was so intrigued by this art-form that I once tried it myself (as in \"making it\").  The way it works: you have the water dough and the oil dough (made from lard if done properly, but don't let me gross you out); you layer it one upon the other - first 2 layers, rolling pin, followed by folding the layered dough (4 layers), rolling it again, folding ... Legend has it that the egg tart shell has 96 layers, but an amateur math student will tell you that it's gotta be 64 or 128.  No matter.  The one I made (YEARS ago) separated like a blossoming yellow rose.  This baby at Golden Gate?  Not so much.  I wolfed that baby down.  The custard tasted fine, but let's face it, egg custard tart is MUCH more about the shell than the custard.  We also tried the glutinous rice ball with peanut filling (you could also have lotus seed and red bean): good texture, but unusual banana-cake flavoring.  The coconut tart, my wife's fave childhood dessert, was a sold 3 as well, but no more.  Maybe they were having a bad day, overblown legend?  \n\nYOU decide.", "author": "Paul L."}

While a lot of the common eggtarts are solid and more like solid cookie crust than flaky- Golden Gate Bakery's eggtarts are genuinely fluffy and flaky- you can see each layer of the tart. It's what Canto people call, \"so pei dan tat\" as in flaky egg tart. Egg tarts are supposed to be flaky and fluffy and Golden Gate is one of those rare places where they do this.

They told us what everything was, they made recommendations, they smiled, talked, laughed, and generally made us feel welcome.  I was expecting good food.  Good service?  Not so much.  To get such excellent service?  I must say that it really floored me.\n\nSo long story short, we bought a lot of food.  We bought rice cake and moon cake and egg custard tart and wife cake and dumplings and something awesome stuffed with winter melon.  Though I'm no expert, I found it all to be really freakin' tasty.  The rice cakes were chewy, the dumplings were crunchy, the pastry was flaky, and the melon/lotus fillings were sweet and nutty and creamy and crystally in the way of things that probably contain a goodly amount of sugar.  The egg custard tart was definitely the most impressive thing we had to eat, and what really struck me was how brilliantly light the filling was.  It just tasted like egg, slightly sweetened.  I've never really had a dessert before that just felt so pure.\n\nI don't know if I'll always find myself wanting to brave the line to get my hands on Golden Gate Bakery's baked goods, and I'm not even educated enough in Chinese pastries to tell you that it's really a head above the rest.

They are soft and have just enough flavor to them. I will continue to go here for my buns. \n\n3 for only $1.90. Cheap!", "author": "Katie Anne N."}

When you pass by it, it's just a small store with a LONG line. The line probably goes around the store because the space is so small. I had to wait a good 40 minutes to get to the front. There weren't a whole mess of people but I think the reason why the line was so slow was because the service was so inefficient. The ladies who work in the front only know how to speak chinese so it's hard for non-chinese speakers to communicate. Not everything on the menu is available in the store so don't expect to get everything you want.\n\nI originally wanted 2 egg tarts and one pineapple moon cake. Confused on how to order, one lady pointed at me to order and when I hesitated for a few seconds, she straight up ignored me and moved on to the next customer..rude much? Also, since I ordered in english, I think she thought I said 3 egg tarts and a moon cake, so I had no choice than to get one more. I think the baked goods are only good when it's warm and straight off the oven. The egg tarts were impressive. The tart wasn't overwhelmingly crunchy, but had just enough crunch and flake. The egg custard was soft, sweet, and yummy. I can't really say much for the moon cake except that it's how I imagined a regular red bean bread would be except a bit crunchier.

Like cookies, fresh egg tarts are infinitely better than ones that have been sitting out.\n\nThe warmth and freshness only enhances how delectable they are. The (plentiful) egg filling is sweet-but-not-too-sweet and has a creamy and custardy texture that contrasts marvelously with the perfectly flaky crust. Simply exquisite! (I could go on and on about them and use all the synonyms I know for \"delicious\" and \"amazing\", but I won't.)\n\nI always eat mine as soon as I step out of the store. My face and shirt is often littered with remnants of the crust and custard, but it's a small price to pay and I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nWhile their egg tarts definitely deserve 5-stars, I haven't been very impressed with the other items they offer. I've had way better versions of napoleons, moon cakes, and wife cakes (filled with lotus paste) - mostly from bakeries in Vancouver and Hong Kong.

Me and my brother followed my mom for what seemed like hours, trekking up and down the hills of Chinatown as she scoured for fruits, veggies, and misc groceries. We waited patiently, toting those pink and white plastic baggies as she shopped. I hated fighting the crowds of anxious shoppers hunting for the cheapest greens and fruits,  the workers shouting out their deals, while the tourists taking in all the smells, sights, and noises moseying along.. where everyday seemed to be a never-ending parade. \n\nThe one highlight was stopping by Golden Gate bakery for an afternoon snack before the ride home. There was no line or craziness like there is now. You could just walk in, order, take a seat, and enjoy their infamous dan tat.\n\n3 reasons why this is the best dan tat: \n1. EGGY CUSTARD goodness with just enough wiggle and jiggle in its custard. \n2. The right tint of YELLOW-just how an egg custard should look, you know? Not those bootleg ones that look orange. \n3. All wrapped inside a FLAKY, crispy, crunchy tart. The messy kind of crust that leaves a mess of crumbs all over your lips and mouth, clothes, and car (if you can wait that long). That's the kind of messy I like. \n\nAll in all, a perfect little tart. \nAnd every tart is served warm, which adds to just how delectable this tart is. YOU NEED TO EAT IT WARM.

The line is always super long and the owners love taking vacations.  Who says you can't spend your money if you own a restaurant?", "author": "Steven S."}

Chinese bakeries in Sacramento only offer these during the moon festival but as expected, every bakery in Chinatown has it all year! \n\nDecided to check out Golden Gate Bakery based on Yelp reviews. As usual, finding parking in that area is nearly impossible. I suggest saving yourself the headache, time and gas by using the parking structure on Jackson (pass the bakery on Grant Ave. and turn left at the next block. Parking will be on your right hand side. ~$2.50 per half hour.) Also, remember to have cash as they don't accept credit cards in this bakery. Conveniently, Chase and Citibank are located across the street. \n\nNow back to the mooncakes. You can choose from a handful of filling selections including some with egg yolks inside. I got several red bean mooncake for $5.15 each (only comes in large sizes--no minis) and got out of there with a big smile on my face. The filling was perfect; not overly sweet. Never noticed it with other mooncakes made from other bakeries but the ones from Golden Gate had tiny pieces of nuts (off white) in it. Unnoticeable unless you look closely but a definite no-no for people with peanut allergy. \n\nGlad I found this place.

The egg tarts come in a pink box that they cut two ventilation holes at the top. They are separated by a paper plate and the box is wrapped by red ribbon.

This place really reminded me of a Sprinkles Cupcakes except that Beverly Hills is replaced by Chinatown. The reason for this comparison is that they are both very good but may get an undeserved amount of business based on their hype and reputation. It seemed like half the tourists jumped in line thinking that this place must be something special since its the only line in chinatown. I honestly feel bad for most of the tourists cause none of the tourists that jumped behind me ordered any egg tarts.The restaurant really should just rename themselves Golden Gate Tarts.   \n\nI ordered a dozen of their signature egg tarts and they did not disappoint. I brought them back to the westfield mall and ate them with a liter of milk from Bristol Farms and they were the perfect combination. I really liked how they were huge and flaky without being too sweet.  These were by far the best egg tarts I have ever had, though my dad thought they were simply average.\n\nI also tried their pork bun, coconut tart, and my favorite, the cocktail bun. The cocktail bun was disappointing. The bread was just so soft and there was barely any filling. The pork buns were average and the coconut tarts were almost as good as the egg tarts.

It's sweet and best eaten when you get it fresh. It's warm and gooey with a pleasant sweetness that will bring a smile to your face. It's a little pricier than other places in the area, but this is what you pay for quality.\n\nATMOSPHERE: People in line are usually friendly and just trying to get something sweet for their pallets just like you. The staff isn't very personal, but they're quick. The place is pretty small and there is only street parking close by with the exception of paid parking, but it's in SF Chinatown and that's to be expected of the area. Prepare accordingly.\n\nWHY FOUR? There is always a line. This place is always busy and sometimes the staff can seem a little rushed because of how hectic it can get. Be patient, order your dozen or so \"dan tat\" and enjoy them. Don't worry too much about the wait, they're pretty quick.\n\nCONCLUSION: I love sweet things and this place is a must if I'm even remotely nearby.\n\n-TanK", "author": "Kevin T."}

With that said, the egg custard tarts here definitely aren't bad but I'd rather save 35 cents and buy them from somewhere else.  Compared to other places, they seem bigger and contain more of the egg custard filling.  But I'm still hesitant to buy it for $1.15 each.  (That's partly due to the fact that one daan tat disappears into my stomach after about 30 seconds for me.  Hmm, is $1.15 equal to 30 seconds of joy??  Maybe.)\n\nWhat I definitely wouldn't pay for again are their mochi items that they offer.  I ordered the ones with red bean as the filling.  Sure, they're larger than usual, but there's hardly any filling.  It's predominantly mochi.  And how much did I pay for them?  $1.35 each.  A bit overpriced, don't you think?  I can get 5 mini buns for $1.50 at another bakery in Chinatown, which would satisfy me a lot more!!  If it wasn't because I had a craving for them, I would not have gotten them.  What I do have to commend them on is the banana flavor that seems to be infused into the mochi parts.  \n\nThe last few times that I've come to golden gate bakery, there have been no lines whatsoever, despite what many seem to experience.

I love the flakey crust...and if they're fresh out of the oven...man! talk about melt in your mouth!\n\nThey do have other baked goods, of course, including chinese rice crispy (ok, that's not the real name for it, but that's how i best describe it!...it kinda looks like a square brain...just point, or, they speak English there too...so you'll figure it out), the coconut filled bun, the pineapple crust bun..haha, yes. it tastes better than it sounds right now. and they also have moon cake! yay!\n\nThis is another place where there's always a line out the door. It's a small place in the middle of Chinatown...and the longest i've ever seen the line was out their door to the next stand's door...but they're also good at moving people in and out courteously. \n\nThe Dan Taat's used to be a dollar, but now they're a bit more each...but ah, what can you do? Their the best and the economy sucks.

They even had a velvet rope for the line-goers that wanted to taste one of the 100 things to try before you die. Even some guy came up to us and said, \"Is this place supposed to be that good?\" Judging by the line, I'm pretty sure it should be decent.\n\nBut after waiting in line, we finally got our custard tarts and melon cakes.

I've heard so much about the egg tarts at this place so when I came here about a month ago I was horribly disappointed when I found out they were on vacation for a month! You know a place is good when they get so much damn business that they can just close up shop without warning and leave a paper sign on the door saying they are gone on vacation. \n     When I came here last weekend, the weekend before Chinese New Year, it was packed. The streets were crowded and the store was too! Surprisingly we were able to get our order in about 40 minutes. I thought we'd be waiting for well over an hour but the line moved at a decent speed! \n     After the long wait I definitely ordered a lot of things. What a great business cycle for them huh? Have a huge line that people will wait in, and then because they waited so long they buy a bunch of stuff to make the wait worth it!\n     Anyways my first time here I of course ordered egg tarts, 15 to be precise. Not all for myself! I also tried banana mochi, sweet rice cake, coconut tart, some yellow bread thingie, and a pancake thingie. \n     The egg tarts are definitely the best thing there and the only reason you should make a trip to this bakery. I ordered the regular flavor and they are hot and yummy and not to sweet on the inside and the crush is nice and flakey on the outside. Unfortunately when you bring it home and try to re-heat it yourself it is not as good, tasty still but not as good. Definitely the moment you step out of that mess grab one out of your bag and chomp away. Don't burn yourself though! \n    Everything else was eh. It was good but I definitely wouldn't go here specifically for those items. I have other chinese bakeries that are closer to my house, cheaper, and less crowded that do a better job with the other types of bakery.

The owner I can only describe as the \"Soup Nazi\" in Seinfeld's episode, except that she's an Egg Custard Tart Nazi (ECT Nazi). Here's what you can expect when you get there:\n\n1. There will be a line outside the store. The store square footage is really small, I mean is tiny. Is a one way in and one way out situation. Get in line.\n\n2. You will have to wait because the egg costars are being made as you wait and they come out of the oven in batches and they are super fresh, piping hot and the smell of buttery pastry and sweet eggs mixture are intoxicating. \n\n3. Be prepared to place your order when you get inside. These people don't mess around and they move at the speed of light. You'llneed to know exactly how many pieces of egg custard tarts you want so they know what size boxes to bring out. They do not like it if you tell them 6 and then change your order to 12. When in doubt, get more. You'll thank later. \n\n4. Have cash on hand. You are in China Town now, cash is gold. No cash, no egg tarts. Capisce? \n\n5. Be patient. Sometimes it will take a little waiting if the egg custards aren't ready or they are out. \n \n6. Don't whine, complain or roll your eyes at them. I have witnessed patrons who whined about how long the wait was and went up to the line to complained to the store owner and she got thrown out of the store. Literary -- No Egg Tarts For You! \n\nI know it seems like such a hassle just for egg tarts and yes, I agree that they store owner has a little attitude, but hey, there is a price for everything right?

The radio commerical went something like:\n\nWhat is the most popular park in SF?\nGG Park\nWhat is the most popular bridge in SF?\nGG Bridge\nWhat is best bakery in SF?\nGG Bakery\n\nI thought that was a lie since I had never heard of it before. As I got older (and before the times of Yelp), and I don't know or when I had my first egg tart from Golden Gate Bakery, I was sold. Soft custard on the inside and slightly sweet, and flaky on the outside. At the time, I didn't know that there needed to be standards for egg custards, but that became my standard. You can bring it home and put it in the toaster oven (and make sure not to burn the crust) and it's still very good. Actually, it tastes good cold, refrigerated. It always tastes good, but even better fresh.\n\nI also like the coconut tarts they have there. Oh so good!\n\nThey do close at certain times of year for vacation or to make mooncakes (sorta expensive, but good). Lines are common, and sometimes when I pass by and there is no line, I have to go in and get an egg tart even if I'm not craving one. It's like seeing a pig that flies, a UFO, a dog with 5 legs. OK, I've never seen those things, but that's how rare it is or how impossible it is for GG Bakery to have no line.\n\nI've come here from when each egg tart was 80 cents, then 90, then eventually 1.15. It's like I can see inflation in action. Makes me feel old (I'm not right? *pulls out mirror to look for wrinkles, crow's feet, and white hair*) Even though are costly I sometimes buy several since my sisters and/or friends crave them.\n\nI've definitely waited in line for 2 hours before. So though the line looks lik 15 people, it could take that long. Well, the time we came it was mooncake time so people were buying more things. But it just gets to the point where you have waited so long, you might as well keep waiting.\n\nBy the way, if you are in line for an egg tart anyway, can you bring me one?", "author": "Anita C."}

The egg custard is so hot and the tart is so flaky and crispy. \n\nI remember when they use to be about $0.80, which I thought was pretty expensive already, considering other bakeries sold them for only $0.50.  I believe they now sell them for $1.10.  But that makes sense - according to economics, high demand drives the price up, right?\n\nOther things worth mentioning are these cookies that come pre-packaged. I'm not sure what they're called in English, but if I were to translate it directly from Chinese, it would be \"cow ear cookies\" LOL I know it doesn't sound very appetizing, but these choco swirled cookies are very crunchy and make a great snack.  During the mid-autumn festival, GGB also makes moon cakes.  Their packaging is not the prettiest (comes in a paper box), but they make them in a variety of exotic flavors in addition to the traditional white lotus with egg yolk.\n\nThe wait on a normal weekday probably wouldn't be long, on the weekend will probably be around 15 minutes, but during mid-autumn festival... be prepared to wait 3 hours. Yes that is three hours.  And if you're willing to wait three hours, be sure to just pay for parking at the garage and don't park at the metered parking, because you will end up buying very expensive moon cakes.  \n\nLast tip: Be sure to eat the tarts right when you get it - that is when it is the bestest!", "author": "Elaine C."}

Since they're so popular, the ones you get are still warm (and there aren't too many places where the egg tarts are so fresh and warm). The shell is very flaky, crispy and buttery and the custard is light, moist, eggy and sweet.  Though I like the tarts, I wish the bottom of the tart was a bit firmer because the tart falls apart too easily.  Crumbs wind up everywhere!   Also, I don't like the careless way they shove the tarts into a paper bag because they always get squashed that way.  \n\nMy favorite items are actually the sugar topped French buns.  They're so light, soft and airy and the sugar crust adds that extra oomph.  They seem to run out of those quickly too.\n\nI've had some of their other items that aren't as good (baked buns, cookies, etc.).  The curry beef turnover is expensive and the filling is just okay.  The vanilla cake roll is also expensive ($1.25 a slice) and mediocre  - the cake is tough and I found some eggshells in my cake too. Sheng Kee has better cake slices.  \n\nI heard they were famous for moon cakes but I wanted one without the salted egg inside and they didn't seem to have any without eggs.  I usually go to Sheng Kee for mine since I like getting the mini moon cakes.\n\nWhile overpriced in general, it's worth coming here for egg custard tarts and sugar topped baked buns (and possibly moon cakes).", "author": "Lolia S."}

I have my own spot in Oakland that i go to all the time, but if I'm in SF this is where I'm going. \n\nYea there's usually a line and yea it is doubled the price from other Chinese bakery's for their egg tarts.

But this place was very nice, and the tarts are super warm and crispy. The egg custard filling is very tasty, has that nice egg flavor and just sweet enough. Not too sweet, just how i like it.

I drop by here with my wife to pick up some egg tart cause she wanted some. I had the rudest customer service from these old ladies. We waited a good 10min before it was our turn to order. When I had the chance to call out my order..i holla at the old lady across who was signaling me for my order. I holla...Give me a Box egg tart.. plus 6 more in a separate bag in Cantonese. Dumbass old lady don't understand. She kept asking what I want. I just told your ass. LADY...you got a big ass sign behind you saying 1 box = 1 dozen egg tart for $16. 1 dozen = 12pc + 6pc = 18pcs. Figure the math yourself. So then the confused old lady look at the other old lady who also seem not to understand my order in Cantonese.  They were talking smack in Cantonese cause they not understand my order and was holding up the line. As if I didn't understand their trash talking.  She then look at my wife asking if she speak Chinese...LOL. My wife is Korean. So then a customer behind us intervene in my shouting match with these dumb ass old ladies. He clarify FOR THEM my order 1.5 dozen. Old lady then attempted to ask for my order in English..How many pieces do you want? I said give me 18pcs for crying out loud. I said to the dude behind us...how they not understand? how they not figure out the math? They only pack 12pcs in a box.. I wanted 6 more in a bag. 18 PIECES LADY. OMG!!.. Guess what? The old lady put the extra 6pcs in another box!! F' ing dumbass. I told them to put the 6pcs in a paper bag.

The end.  I guess when your pastries are as good as theirs are you don't need to woo your clients with great service!

You know those little egg pastries that you find on those magical dim sum carts? Yes, I'm talking about those little morsels of happiness. However, Golden Gate Bakery takes the egg tart to a whole new level of food sexiness.\n\nThe triple threat:\n1) Size: size really does matter. I think it just happens to be a general universal law that big things will entertain your mouth ;) the egg tart of this place is HUGE. It is the big foot of egg tarts.\n2) Consistency: the texture is marvelous. Given it's bigger size, the egg custard center doesn't get dry when baking which makes it this gooey jelly like consistency. If I had to pick something of a similar consistency, I'd pick maybe pudding. And with the juxtaposition of the soft delicate melt-in-your-mouth To the crispy puff pastry shell, it really just slides in. Mmmmm.\n3) Taste: I think this might sound like a complete surprise but these egg tarts have a really strong prevalent egg flavor LOL. Usually dim sum places egg lots of sugar to give the egg tarts a sweet flavor, but this place knows how to please. The egg tart is the diva to this pastry and it does not fail to impress.\n\nThe egg tarts can make everyone happy. Who wouldn't like a big delicious thing slide down your throat? I think these egg-wonderfuls which are famous apparently can stop wars.\n\nTips: it's really a hit or miss with this place timing wise. Apparently it closes on random days. I came during their reg business hrs and it was closed -.- my suggestion is to just stop by when you can, but don't plan on it being open. But when it is open, buy dozens. DOZENSSSS. They are pretty good to just pop into the toaster for another day :) also, the line can get pretty long.

In no shape or form is Grant Ave. a part of the Nob Hill Neighborhood. Yelp can be confusing at times...More times than not, actually...\n\n\nGolden Gate Bakery is one of many examples of my rule for eating good Chinese. Notice I didn't say great. That's because great Chinese would take you to Hong Kong and China, NOT San Francisco. If you would take notice, the line that is almost always there is lined up with Chinese folks. Old, young, short, tall...You see them all lined up for one thing and one thing only...Well, maybe something else but the main attraction is the almighty egg custard tart. Dahn Taht. You gotta pronounce the \"ah\" like when you open your mouth and say AHHH!!! except with the letters that start and end it. The best known dahn taht in San Francisco and probably in the entire Bay Area. Maybe even in all of California but that's left to be seen.\n\nLet's start off with the the shell. A flaky, crumbly, buttery-like maybe shortening but could be a mix of all that crust that is delicious. Soooo tender to the touch and melts in your mouth slowly. And if you take notice at how thin it is...Makes you wonder how they can afford to put in that much custard. And the custard! Ohh so sweet and light...You'll love it once you bite into it. You'll try your best to find yourself another dahn taht that is like this one but to no avail. You're screwed! That's why people leave with dozens.\n\n\nNow, to the reason why I left a star off. You must be scratching your heads. Well, the reason is the price. They keep jacking the price up everytime they close the place down for a month or two. Now, I don't live in North Beach anymore so I am not sure if they still do that but under the guise of a vacation, they are actually cleaning the place up for their yearly inspection. You know, that green postcard type thing that rates eateries on their cleanliness. Everytime they close for a spell of time, almost everytime they raise the price. But damn us morons for falling for them. It's amazing at how hooked we are to these things that we will pay the amount just for a taste. Sad, really...\n\nAlso, the way they come out in batches...If you can call them that. They present them on trays from the kitchen where they are prepared. Now, we all know it would make more sense to come out with more than just one tray at a time but the thing is, if they do it that slowly, people would line up and wait. This is making the line extend itself out the door, therefore making them seem like they are hot shit, which they are and always will be until they call it quits or someone totally destroys the recipe. This is called self marketing and strategy. Because they know a crowd will attract an even bigger crowd because we Chinese are gluttons for this kind of stuff. Even though it ain't free, it must be good! Trust me! I'm Chinese!", "author": "Anthony L."}

Cheaters!  But smart.  Make the tart unique.  Maybe baking it on that is what makes the custard so melt in your mouth.  \n\nMinus one star because this place is the size of a freaking closet and unorganized like one.  First time I went here after 10am it was crowded and out of egg tarts, so I went bright and early the next day and already they were packing boxes of them for customers!  Damn those popular tarts.  This place seemed full of stack of delivery boxes about to tip over or stuff hanging all over the wall behind the counter that made it difficult to read the sign of the items and prices.  The set up and style of the place was just lacking when compared to modern bakeries like Yummy Bakery and Cafe or Washington Bakery and Restaurant.

I ordered egg tarts ($1.15), a vanilla creme bun ($1.75), and large wife cakes (more than $2 each). \n\nThe egg tarts I got were warm and fresh out of the kitchen. The egg custard is different from most bakeries, it's very delicate and soft. The consistency and texture is a lot like silken tofu. The egg part is good, but I didn't care for the puff pastry crust. At $1.15 a piece they're very pricey and IMO, not worth a special trip. The vanilla creme bun was tasty, but nothing special. The filling has a slightly butter or shortening taste to it and is whipped - I wouldn't buy this again for over $1. I almost never like wife cakes (winter melon filled flaky pastry) and there are few Chinese bakeries that make them to my liking - but when they do I LOVE them. The only other time I've had a wife cake that I liked was when someone gave our family some souvenir wife cakes from Chicago and Golden Gate Bakery is much closer. At over $2 a pop they're not cheap, and I actually think the ones I got that day were a bit burnt. Overall, I don't think Golden Gate Bakery is so super duper special that I would make a special trip to try their goods. Since they're so successful I think they feel that they can get away with charging more than other bakeries in the area. I bought 4 egg tarts, 1 bun, and 2 large wife cakes and it left me $11 poorer. I can get a lot more for $11 elsewhere.", "author": "Monica W."}

That sweet little flakey crispy goodness of a dan tat. I would look forward to Thursdays just to get my hands on a nice toasty warm and fresh dan tat from the one and only GGB. No where else was acceptable. \n\nOne time (actually on many occasions) the family that owns it will randomly close down the shop for days, maybe even a couple weeks, at a time to go on vacation. Of course, they're probably raking in tons of sweet moolah from all the people that line up out side of their little bakery everyday. They can afford to just pick up and go on vacation whenever they want, because they already know, that they already have a set clientele that so devotedly will come back for more upon their much anticipated return. \n\nWhen I was young and stupid, I thought getting any old dan tat from c-town would be ok, I was desparate for one and GGB was closed. So I went down grant and came upon the other bakery (the one with bill Clinton's picture in it) how could you go wrong?!?! Bill Clinton was here!!! But I was so wrong..... thus this brings me back to GGB.... \n\nSeriously, if you like egg custard tarts. You MUST. I really really really mean it. MUST try one from GGB. If I knew you, I'd buy one for you to try it. i buy like a half dozen or so and share the tarts with my dearest co-workers. Spread the joy...\n\nOne down side.

So there would be a line, creating the idea to people passing by that the place must be good. I know this because I kno people that work there heh heh seriously...anyways though, they are not the best in chinatown but they definetly are not the worst. I dont really have much to say about disliking their pastries. I mean the egg tarts arent really that bad, tell you the truth i think they are pretty good.

To me, I'm not super crazy about egg tarts or anything, but my more traditional-Chinese boyfriend, loves them. Everytime he goes out to the city, he tries to buy some of these at Golden Gate Bakery. Last weekend, we came and it was my first time going back since I was little.  \n\nWhen you hear the name and the popularity, you would think Golden Gate Bakery is some big bakery with lots of items.  However, it's the total opposite. When we went, there was a line out the door, and inside of the store, it can literally fit around 4-5 customers maximum. \n\nGolden Gate Bakery has other items besides their egg tarts, but that's all that we bought that day.  and let me tell you, these egg tarts are AMAZING when fresh. I'm usually not a huge fan of egg tarts, but the egg tarts here are sooo damn good. Definitely brings me back to the egg tarts I had in Hong Kong.. mMmmm.\n\nFunny thing happened while I was here... They have some squishy looking white dessert that kind of looks like Mochi, but I had no clue what it was. But since it looks squishy, and I apparently have my childish moments, I just had to go and poke at it. Next thing you know, one of the ladies behind the counter throws a little sign onto the dessert platter that says \"DO NOT TOUCH!!\"\n\nthe funny part of it is, she said something in Cantonese pretty loud, but I had no clue what she said since I don't understand Cantonese. But my boyfriend told me that she pretty much said something like, \"and they still keep poking at it.. i don't know what is so funny to poke at it.\" it doesn't sound so funny in english, but when my boyfriend translated to Mandarin to me, I thought it was pretty damn funny.\n\nLast but not least, some important information: parking is very hard to find. On the intersecting street, there is a parking garage that is cheap!  Golden Gate Bakery only takes cash, and egg tart's are around $1.80 each I believe, if I remember correctly", "author": "Tiffany K."}

The crust is virtually puff pastry, very flaky and buttery. \n\nLike apple pie to Americans, egg tarts are a staple baked good to Chinese people. And like the $1 Chicken Sandwiches at Mickey D's,  eating $1+ tarts from here for 30 days straight will result in the same pain felt by Morgan Spurlock. Yet, Chinese people, myself included, will continue to crave this stuff like crack cocaine. In the future, GG will become an evil corporation, taking advantage of the price inelasticity and burden the blame for obesity on the Asian population in America.", "author": "Ed L."}

I've waited here for upwards of an hour and a half just to get inside and get my order of dan tats in.  The dan tats are fabulous, especially if you can get the straight out of the oven.  When they are warm, the custard just has this wonderful silken texture and the crust is perfectly flaky.  They are sweet, without being cloyingly so.  We usually try to order at least a dozen, just to compensate for the time we've spent in line.  While we'll eat a couple right off the bat, we save some for the next day and they are still great cold or slightly re-heated.\n\nIn addition to the dan tats, we'll get the wife cakes, though its not as great as the ones I remember from Hong Kong.  However, they are the best I've had in SF, so I'll continue getting them here until I can afford to go back to HK.       \n\nI also like to get the coconut tart - a lovely confection made of the same basic crust as the dan tat, but with a filling of coconut.  The filling again, isn't too sweet and the flavors definitely hold up for eating the next day.\n\nMy sister likes to order what I call the Chinese version of rice krispy treats.  I have no idea what they're called, but they come in blocks and I usually just point to them as I order.  Unfortunately, they were a little dry and slightly stale on one visit, and hence, GGB gets a -1 star for that.\n\nOverall, a great place to try dan tats and other delectable Chinese bakery items.

Still had to wait in line for 5 minutes which makes me wonder what the hell the line is like during lunch.\n\nYes, the Egg Tarts are the best I've ever had. I can safely say this without inhibition. They are not too egg-y, the custard is silky and almost melt in your mouth, and the pastry crust is so flaky and rich that you can almost feel the butter coursing through your veins. Yes, they're that good. They are worth the heart attack that will later occur. They are worth everything. Do they have crack in them? I don't know, but they are good. Yelp is correct.\n\nBut are they worth $1.10 for one egg tart? No egg tart is worth that price. Yet I will probably go back... multiple times this month... simply because they are delicious and I work not even 4 blocks away...\n\nThe other items I bought today were less satisfactory. The beef curry pastry was tasty, but too greasy. The filling was good, but it would have been so much better as a bao instead with a sweet, almost hawaiian roll quality to the bread dough. I also bought a sesame ball, which was a total rip off. It had a tablespoon, MAYBE TWO of red bean paste in the middle of a ball that was 3 inches in diameter. Mostly air... not even enough rice to make it worth while.\n\nAnd despite these negative points for Golden Gate Bakery, I still give them 4 stars. The egg tarts are just that good. Hell, I'd give them 5 if it weren't for the price and the line.\n\nI managed to feel less bad about my caloric intake by walking up to Coit Tower to eat my tart there.

A side-by-side showdown is physically impossible, you could never get the freshest, just-out-of-the-oven specimen next to each other fast enough.\n\nGolden Gate has the advantage of a madhouse atmosphere where the constant stream of pushy Asian Grannies ensures you'll get the freshest goods. Their tarts are also bigger than Kee Wah's.\n\nI don't advise waiting for the rush to die down because the tarts don't maintain their perfection in the later hours. I bought some around 7 p.m. and the outer layers of pastry shell had hardened. The custard stayed too wet after cooling to room temp, but if you chill it further, it'll set better. Kee Wah gets points here for investing in a warming oven to preserve the quality of their tarts and pies throughout the day.\n\nWhat about the rest of Golden Gate's merch? They have a relatively limited selection of baked goods. I didn't see Pineapple Buns. The Custard Buns weren't on the display. And their set-up makes the shop ridiculously difficult to browse. You better know what you want when you get to the front of the line.

I have not ventured beyond this point except for the bbq pork buns which everyone seem to love but again I find too sweet and the sesame balls which are also good.

The line was already out the door, and we parked ourselves at the end of it.  During our 60 minute wait, countless people walked by asking what the line was for and assumed that a line so long must be for something incredibly awesome.\n\nI only tried the egg tarts; I had one freshly baked, as a reward for waiting in line, and the egg custard was warm and pleasantly sweet.  The sweetness and moistness of the custard balanced well with the light, flaky pastry.\n\nI had another egg tart the next day and since the custard had cooled and firmed, it was easier to eat, but just as good.  It still tasted fresh, despite lacking that fresh-baked warmth.\n\nOther notes:\n-You're better off walking, since the street is small and crowded.  (What do you expect?  It's Chinatown!)\n-Of the two women working the cashier and fulfilling orders, there was an older, friendlier woman who spoke pretty good English, and a younger, hastier woman whose English was a bit difficult to understand.  The non-Chinese speaking customers before me had a miscommunication in the price, and there was a good 20 seconds of verbal exchange between them before the older woman cleared things up.

BUT it is all worth it when you order the egg tarts.  Simply the best.\n\nJanice's view:  I think the egg tarts are way too sweet and oily.  Personally I like egg tarts with the pie crust not the filo type kind.

KFC makes the best dan-ta and this place cannot complete. \nIf you're not from Asia/Taiwan, this might be new to you, but KFC is infinitely better there for some reason. \n\nI was craving for dan-ta one day and we just so happened to be running around China Town looking for airsoft guns for my boyfriend's inner child. While he was engaged in debating which ones to get, I swung by the Golden Gate Bakery. \n\nThere was already a line and they said the next available batch will come out in 15 minutes. Most of the people were waiting to buy a dozen or more, I only wanted 3, so the lady boosted me up in line and had me waiting across from the cashier. \nAfter waiting for 15 minutes, I got my 3 scalding hot dan-ta's. I was SO EXCITED I cannot describe to you how amazing I thought these hot babies would be. \n\nI was extremely disappointed. It was greasy beyond belief. The bag holding the dan-ta was drenched in grease, so were my hands. I had to put the greasy dan-ta in a plastic bag so they don't grease-stain anything else. The dan-ta was okay, It was liquidy and not enough eggs. It's got a eggy flavor but it tasted like it was water-downed. The color wasn't very pretty, it was yellow on the white side, not a solid nice yellow you get when you know they use enough eggs. The crust was not up to my expectations either, it was crumby and made the whole thing bland. \nMy boyfriend had half of one because he was starving, but refused to take another bite afterwards. If a starving person's not eating it, you know there's something wrong with these dan-ta. \nSome people say cold dan-ta is the best, I tried that, I saved it for later, and when I picked it up to try it again, I knew it was a mistake. Let's just say it wasn't good. \n\nSave your tummy space for something better! This place is not worth it!", "author": "Erica L."}

Did any of the reviewers ever had a decent egg tart in Hong Kong?  If Golden Gate Bakery open in Hong Kong, they will fold in less than 3 months.  Why?  First, the crust is way too oily.  I brought a half dozen of the egg tart home.  They put it in a to go paper box for me.  By the time I was home, the excess oil from the crust managed to soak through the paper cup and the paper box and stain my car seating surface!!!  Not to mention when you finished eating them, your mouth and hand were so oily you felt like you had been munching on a block of warm lard!  A good crust is very tricky to make.  It has to be flaky, rich tasting, and not oily.  To make it flaky and rich is easy,  all you have to do is dumping butter or lard in it.  But to make the crust not oily is where the skill comes in.  In Hong Kong,  the good egg tart's crust is always dry to touch,   On Youtube there are actually some video about what authentic, good tasting egg tarts should look like.  You would not even see much oil on the paper cup that's holding the tart!  And by the way, they are way over price.  The altitude toward their customers should be improved.

I've never been into these but I grew up always purveying various dan tan because my grandma loved them so we always got them.  I've had my fair share of them in NY, L.A., Sydney, Hong Kong and Golden Gate Bakery's dan tan is among one of the best I've had in recent years.  Not too sweet, fresh, flaky crust, custard the right firmness.  \n\nTheir cha siu bao was fairly good.  Meat was not your usual gooey mix.  \n\nNow the absolute ugly --- someone on Yelp mentioned they liked the sa chi ma here.  Now, sa chi ma is what I used to do anything for as a kid.  I was crazy for this pure fat treat.  For those of you who don't know sa chi ma, it's this wonderful chinese version of rice crispy treats but so much better if I say so myself.  We used to get some in the 70's in downtown L.A. chinatown that came in a pink box with red string tied to it and I'd sneak piece after piece, trying to rearrange the pre-cut squares in the box so that my parents and brother couldn't tell I had too much. So, I was thrilled to read an endorsement of some good sa chi ma.  I don't eat the processed, packaged kind commonly sold in chinese markets.  I don't know if it's because it was dinner time when I stopped by Golden Gate Bakery and the sa chi ma was old, in which case the store should not have sold it to me, but the sa chi ma here was tooth-chipping hard.  I mean, it was like biting into a square rock.  Just ridiculous this was sold to me.  Greedy me, in a moment of glee at the sight of them, got four of them and I had to toss all of them.  Shame on them for selling these like this.  Negative stars for the sa chi ma if there are such things.\n\nI didn't see anything else that looked appetizing enough in the display to try.  My assessment - Go here for dan tan if that floats your boat.  Otherwise, don't bother with this place.  Plenty of better dim sum places.  This place should be more aptly called Golden Gate Dan Tan Bakery.\n\nCash-only...duh.", "author": "Liz K."}

It's not that the line was long, it was that the line moved really slowly.  \n\nWhile some were pre-orders or just large orders, people were jumping in front of the line and they didn't really do anything to police it.  Well, it's Chinatown where the little old ladies run you over to get a seat on the Stockton 30 (or the Chinatown bus as a friend once called it) - so deal with it.\n\nMaybe it's because of the sheer number of large orders that came through or maybe I'm picky, but the custards were just good and not what I was led to expect.  Or maybe standing in line for three hours listening to some cantekerous folks in the line impacted my taste buds.  But it definitely was not worth 3 hours.  Maybe 10-15 minutes.\n\nAnd eat them hot - we got a dozen and had some left overs that we let sit for a few hours.  They got rather mushy.

The shell was soooooo soggy, almost mushy, and the filling tasted like raw egg, it was undercooked! I'm sorry but it was absolutely disgusting.\n\nThere are 2 kinds of egg custard tarts that you can usually get in a chinese bakery, the traditional chinese, and portugese. The traditional chinese egg custard has a shell that looks and tastes very similar to the western tart shell. Te filling should be a little firmer than pudding or custard, but less firm than jell-o. The fine balance of the crunchy shell and soft (not creamy) is the key.\n\nThe portugese egg custard was once such a hit a couple years ago in Taiwan that everyone cued for hours in front of stores. Why? Because it's so different from the traditional one and so amazingly good. The shell is flaky  and crunchy, like a Tartine croissant and the filling is creamy, like pudding (firmer but not as firm as the chinese egg custard tart), and, a slightly browned top that's formed by the egg and cream in the custard while baking.\n\nI couldn't tell which kind they make here, but it was just, really really disgusting.

There are NO words to describe how good it was.  Delicious is an understatement.  It had a flaky crust with a soft not-too-sweet custard.  It was definitely worth the wait.  \n\n*NOTE: While in line, you get to experience the recorder man.  While we were standing in line, I thought I was hearing things or maybe a band was playing.

A lot of other places either: \n- add coloring to egg tarts making it orangy or neon yellow.\n- have crust to filling ratio of 2:1, i.e. almost 1 inch thick crust all around\n- add corn starch to the filling making it hard and gelatinous\nThis bakery does none of those, and has been _consistent_ at making authentic egg tarts for many years. The crust is thin and crispy; the filling is not too sweet and the right consistency. I am a happy customer every time I stop by. Their coconut macaroons, walnut pound cake, bbq pork puff pastry, and curry beef puff pastry are mighty delicious as well. Sure their prices are a tad more expensive, but they are worth it...you can taste the quality ingredients they put into their stuff.\nThe only reason I subtracted a star is that service isn't very efficient (hence the line out the door), and they are closed for MONTHS AT A TIME at least 2 times a year!

Lived 5 minutes from Chinatown LA growing up and believe me I've eaten tons.  Tried all sorts and sizes of them.  In US, I would say this is one of the better places for egg custards.  \n\nThe long line that wraps around the door and along the wall is not there because the egg custards cost a ridiculous 5cents each.  You'll see why when you take your first bite of these egg custards.\n\nMy friend accidently left her bag of pastries and I drove home with them from SF to LA.  SCORE, I automatically told myself.  Boy, too bad for her because I was left with some GOODIES!  Tried the spongecake and some other pineapple flaky pastry.  Similiar to a napolean but with pineapple taste.  Thanks to her I got to try more than custards and discovered how wonderful they tasted even after 6 hours in my car.\n\nTry going right before they close for a shorter line. You can call in first and ask if the batch is fresh and they will let you know prior.", "author": "Vivan K."}

To my glee and excitement...there is was!!! Almost as a light shone down onto it, Golden Gate Bakery!! As I stood in line, my mouth watered. I got my dan-ta and bit in, I was too anxious, I burned my tongue a little, but oh it was worth it. So fresh and juicy with just the perfect amount of flavoring. I'm typically very picky about my egg custards, the consistency has to be perfect, not too hard or smooshy, the crust can't be too flaky or powdery.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-12-16", "description": "The #1 Place in San Francisco Chinatown for Egg Tarts or Egg Custards, otherwise known as \"Dan Tat\" in Chinese/Cantonese.  Both the locals from Chinatown and tourists from all over gather at this bakery to taste their delicious egg tarts.  Of course, if the locals come here, then you know there is something good about this establishment.\n\nI recently was in San Francisco and decided to venture into another bakery that sold egg tarts (since most bakeries do), which was cheaper than Golden Gate Bakery.  It was about $.75 each, compared to Golden Gate Bakery's $1.25 price tag for each egg tart.  Unfortunately, their egg tart had a thick flaky crust, which made the warm to cold egg tart less than desirable.\n\nI've then realized the secret to what makes Golden Gate Bakery the top place to go for egg tarts, and why people pay a premium for them:\n\n1) Their Flaky Crust is thin (so you get more egg custard in each egg tart)\n2) The Egg custard is cooked just right, and not overly sweet\n3) Usually they are warm/hot since they sell them so fast they always have a fresh batch ready to sell\n\nThe combination of the 3 factors above, make for a wonderful experience when you first bite into the hot \"just out of the oven\" egg tart, causing it to melt in your mouth.  Hence, people eat their egg tart right away when they step outside of the Bakery, to enjoy the aforementioned experience.\n\nNow you know why whenever you walk by Golden Gate Bakery, there is usually a line of people waiting to get in and people outside eating their just purchased egg tarts!", "author": "Edmund Y."}

Next, the mooncakes had a beautiful mold and the saleslady said how \"beautiful\" or good quality they were.

But hey, when can I get fresh moon cakes from San Francisco? After arriving back home that night, we gave them a try.  We cut into the white lotus seed with one egg and saw specks ... of lotus seed? Then I bit into one and found a ginger slice, hmm, new creation? And the egg yolk was very tiny and salty, more like the ones used for jong instead of moon cakes. Overall, a bit disappointing.

Their Egg Tarts were ones of the best I've ever tasted: the crust was flaky and the filling was light and tasteful. The Macaroons were also yummy but the Mochis I could do without.

I've never heard of it to tell you the truth, but it's a tourist attraction from what I've heard.  And what they're famous for is their fresh baked egg tarts and I do love a good egg tart.  So we get there after lunch from Koi Palace (which some of us waited for about an hour already just for that) and there's a line going out the door from this place.  Probably no more than a shop length's line down the street, so it looked pretty manageable.  We were running short on time to make it to the Chihuly Exhibit at the DeYoung, so I left with others to try to score some tickets.  And unfortunately, we scored only disappointment, but we at least we had a consolation on getting some hot egg tarts.  About 30-45 minutes pass and our friends who were waiting at Golden Gate Bakery come empty handed.  They said it was ridiculous as they waited 30 minutes and the line didn't move one person... not ONE person according to them.\n\nAnd that's not the end of the story.\n\nThey were persistent and determined that day, so they went back to the place before we went to eat dinner.  We ended up deciding to go to R&G Lounge since it was nearby and my friend and I went to get reservations as the others were waiting in line for at least an hour at Golden Gate Bakery.  Good thing, R&G had a bar, because I was drinking the time away as we waited another good hour there sipping my alcohol before I can't stand straight.  And finally, they make it with the goods.\n\nI was starving and ripped the egg tart out of my friend's hand and ate the warm, flaky, custardy pastry.  It's definitely good and fresh (and it better be for that wait), but for 2 1/2 freaking hours for this... I don't know about that.  It's good, but not 2 1/2 hours good.  I was expecting to enter nirvana after eating this, but it did not quite happen that way.\n\nI did hear the reason why it was so fraggin heck slow was that they had half their ovens making mooncakes that day and that slowed down their process, but from what I had, I don't see the huge hype that this place was given.  Maybe I'll try it again on a better day.", "author": "David Y."}

Take away the \"best egg tart in the world\" slogan and you've got yourself a regular Chinese bakery. It offers generally above average baked goods, but there isn't anything that is really exceptional about this place. \n\nI've had egg tarts, bbq pork buns, moon cakes, etc. from tons of places: Chinese farmer's markets, restaurants, bakeries and stores all over the place. This was just on par with everything else, so I can't quite grasp the fanaticism that surrounds this place.\n\nEgg tarts: great crust, exactly how I like it: flaky, chewy and crispy all at the same time. The filling itself was a bit too pudding-like, but still good.\n\nBBQ pork buns: they make the kind that have a hint of sherry or alcohol in it - the kind I don't like - so it wasn't my cup of tea. The filling is less dependent on sweet, thick and red bbq sauce, so I did enjoy that.\n\nMoon cakes: This is one item that I absolutely love. Moon cakes can be too dry or too sweet when not properly prepared. This was fantastic. \n\nService: It's a Chinese establishment, so it's efficiency over quality. I understand that so I had no qualms. I did love how all the old ladies started yelling, \"no pictures!,\" and waving their arms in the air when some tourists tried to take a picture of the bakery.

This normally wouldn't be a big deal to me but it seemed like all the people coming into the store to just \"quickly pick up\" their orders were taking longer than the actual customers waiting in line. My wife and I almost walked out after waiting for well over an hour and then to not have anyone help us. It seemed like if you weren't Chinese you weren't going to get helped. Finally, after having three orders jump ahead of me, I said something and one of the older women helped us out. We got a couple coconut macaroons and a few egg tarts.

I took a bit and it tasted like biting into an egg mcmuffin (ok that's an exageration, but you get the emphasis on the EGG not tart or dessertis at all). Man, my excitement fell. And i had bought 5 of them to share with the roomate and hubby and have some extra for myself assuming i would be in love with them. Luckily i also picked up a vanilla cream filled pastry with coconut on top - that was delish and totally hit the spot for the sweet item I'd been envisioning.

Huge balls of yummy red bean goodness!!! Every woman's dream...ok maybe just this woman. We went during Chinese new year do they had their new year cake? It's not really cake but more of a gooey tapioca laffy taffy pie? Hard to explain. It comes in 3 flavors but I don't care for the consistency. My favorite and also the kids' is the BBQ pork rolls!! They are SO good!!! Perfect size and oh so tasty! I could eat a million of those. So you're probably wondering why only 4 stars?!

You gotta be kidding me.  \n\nMy tip: explore Chinatown a bit more, and try some of the other less known bakeries.  This place is hyped by word of mouth because people haven't ventured elsewhere.

Well I'm going to rave about their chocolate roll cake. The egg tarts are not especially tasty, they're just really big. The mooncakes are just mooncakes. They make the traditional kinds with the lotus fillings, egg yolk, and nuts. Older Chinese generations love it but I think for young people, it's just a lot of calories and fat. Now when someone can get haagen daaz to make ice cream mooncakes in America, I will Yelp about that. Now back to chocolate cake. It's not the sweet w/ a little hint of chocolatey bitterness like the ones you find in Western bakeries. The chocolate roll cakes here are moist, light, not too sweet, and come in the perfect size. Well you can buy them slice by slice or in one big roll. I go for the slice. They spread just a little bit of whip cream in the center so you don't get it all over your hands like the ones you buy in Western bakeries. Now... I'm not a big fan of cake.
