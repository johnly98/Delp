The first plate came out to our table about 10 minutes before the next 2, then about 5 more minutes until the final one.

We had originally planned on going to the place next door but after looking at the wait and the menu at the other place, we decided to come in here. There was no wait and only about 1/3 of the dining area filled, which originally made me skeptical about the place but they had a big screen TV in the back with the football game on so we were sold and grabbed the table in the back corner. Our server was nice and the food came out quickly. They do not serve alcohol at this place, which was a bummer because we could have gone for a Bloody Mary.\n\nI went with an omelette made with egg whites and vegetables and it came with home fries and toast on the side. They did not have any gluten free options for toast and they did not have rye bread either so their side options seemed a bit limiting. Their home fries were just okay, nothing spectacular about them. The omelette was tasty and healthy so I enjoyed that part. The place wasn't cheap, because I added egg whites that bumped up the cost of my omelette $4, which is steep. $22 for eggs is a lot however we were in the Fisherman's Wharf area so it can be expected we are going to be paying a pretty penny for anything. I'd recommend this place to people who want a no frills diner type of restaurant without a long wait.", "author": "Samantha S."}

My wife and I had settled on another breakfast place called \"8 a.m.\", not sure why--probably because it came up first on Google and it was relatively close by. When we got to the restaurant there was easily a 30 minute wait. The host snapped at us and told us to write our name on the list they had outside at the door. \n\nHowever, just two doors down, on the same block, was Joanie's. My wife and I noticed there was no wait and the diners eating outside in sunny weather looked happy. They had big plates with great looking portions. So we went over and were greeted by a very pleasant young man who seated us immediately. The establishment itself is somewhat humble looking, but very tidy and neat. \n\nThe menu had a wonderful assortment of breakfast foods: waffles, challa French Toast, omelettes, different hot coffees and teas, burgers and sandwiches. I settled on The Crown Waffle, a side of sausage and some corned beef hash (I was hungry--we did a bike tour of the Golden Gate bridge and Sausalito the day before), and my wife had The Californian omelette with chorizo sausage. The plates arrived shortly and were nicely plated large portions. \n\nThe waffle had huge ripe berries, fresh whipped butter and cream. The sausages were perfectly cooked and juicy. The waffle was easily an inch and a half thick and cooked just right. The corned beef hash was nicely browned to give it a nice carmelized crust and very tasty. My wife's omelette was delicious, with a healthy portion of chorizo, avocados, cheese and vegetables layered in between the expertly cooked eggs. The two young men who assisted us were very attentive and never made us look around for help. \n\nWe were very pleasantly surprised at our experience and my wife even took a picture of the sign outside so she could remember what breakfast joint we will be visiting every time we come to San Francisco. Joanie's was a very nice surprise. \n\nThe moral of the story? Don't always go for what Google is trying to sell you. There are a lot of good, and even great,  restaurants out in the world that are waiting to be discovered beyond the internet search results.", "author": "LF M."}

I thought it would be like Denny's if not worse. Looks can be deceiving. And I was definitely proven wrong. I'm so excited as I'm writing this. Honestly that was probably the best eggs Benedict I've had. The eggs were cooked perfectly. Whites were not runny. The hollandaise sauce had great flavor. I asked for a side of bacon. I got like 6 slices of crispy yummy bacon. (My stomachs growling:). Not greasy at all. The only complaint is that I asked for spinach in my eggs Benedict. I think they forgot. The service was fast.

It looked good from the outside because it was full, food on other people's tables seemed nice, worth a try. The waiter forgot our drinks, then 20 minutes later checked on us and had us wait another 10 before bringing them. When we finally got our food, my eggs were raw, I had specifically asked for poached medium, the potatoes were cold-not warm-cold, there was a hair on my plate, and 1 mushroom under a poached eggs of my Benedict. Where was that from and why was it hiding under 1 of my eggs? The waiter told my husband that the toaster was broken, and that he could bring him some cold bread. What? And again why? We overheard that the credit card machine was not working, and hadn't noticed the whole restaurant sitting in the dark because we sat by the window, until the rest of the patrons cheered when the lights, ac, and electricity came on. (By the way, SF is experiencing usually hot weather, ugh) (explains why the toaster and cc machine weren't working). I've never wanted to run so fast in my life, but since we are traveling, I just wanted to eat and be on my way, but the whole situation was FUCKING NAUSEATING. This is my first bad yelp review. It totally deserved it. I will say that after I pointed out that there was no way I could eat what was on the dirty plate in front of me, they took off my disaster of a dish from the bill.

Service was prompt and the food was good save for the cheese fries ordered by my son. Don't bother with those as they were basically an order of fries drowned in jarred cheese sauce and tossed with a few bacon bits. Regular breakfasts were cooked to order and well made. I subtract stars because $12 for an oder of eggs, bacon and toast is pretty high in my opinion and then they automatically add 18% gratuity on parties of three or more. This always gets me angry because I am someone who rewards good service with a 20 to 25% tip.

If you'd rather go local, not Denny's, Joanies will not disappoint.  It is a family place that has a good breakfast served by a group of cheerful staffers in a clean, bright space.  \n\nThe waffles and the hobo plate (scrambled eggs with spinach, potatoes, etc) are especially good.  We ate here twice in one week, and the second time my friend's order got messed up.  My colleague ordered corned beef hash with hash browns well done.  The kitchen served him well done corned beef hash and hash browns.  He considered sending back the hash browns to be cooked to crispy perfection, but it really wasn't worth the trouble.  It could happen anywhere, but you may want to be very clear about your order.\n\nOatmeal was average, and coffee was just ok.  Prices are consistent with what you'd expect in a touristy area.\n\nYou won't find anything special here except the service, but Joanies offers consistent breakfast fare in a warm, friendly environment.  I wonder if Joanie still loves Chachie.", "author": "Edward W."}

It's a hole-in-the-wall, mom-and-pop style casual cafe, but the breakfasts we had were AMAZING (hence why we came back so much).  Reasonably priced, fast service, clean-looking.  My particular favorite was the breakfast sandwich on a fresh croissant, with home style potatoes on the side (Hey, I never said it was healthy...) and an iced coffee.  The omelets and hash browns were great, too, as was my friend's french toast.  Portions were very large, and prices were pretty low.  Higher than fast food, cheaper than many of the sit-down, full-service restaurants in the area.  If I'm back in the city, I'll be here for breakfast, and I would highly recommend it.

They used plenty of blueberries which was nice.  On the down side, they only provided a little pitcher of syrup.  They readily brought more upon request but why they thought that an ounce of syrup was enough for a full stack of pancakes, I can't imagine. The biggest problem was the toast. It was cold. I am not talking just slightly warm...I mean it was downright cold, so much so that the butter would not melt!  I suspect that they simply timed it wrong and let it sit for way too long.

I came here the first time with a co-worker for brunch, and we were the only customers at the diner.  I ordered a waffle and remember waiting in anticipation for my $8.00 waffle thinking that for that price they must make it right there in their kitchen. HA!  It took 20 minutes to get served, and they didn't bring out any syrup so I had to especially ask for it, which took another 5 minutes.  Most dissapointing was that the waffle wasn't homemade but a frozen batch reheated... barely, as it was below room temperature when I bit into.\n\nWell, everyone has bad days, so I went there again today with a different coworker for lunch.  Not being entirely hungry, I just got a vanilla milkshake with no whip cream (please) and a side order while my coworker ordered an avacado burger.  The service was fast -- though why does it take longer to make a milkshake than a burger? -- however, the avocado burger came with no avocados. Huh?  And since they were out of vanilla ice cream I had to chang my order to a chocolate milkshake.  I received it a minute later with whip cream on top. Doh!  I must say though, the milkshake was very yummy.\n\nOverall, too pricey for entirely average food and sub par service and atmosphere. Go elsewhere.", "author": "Vicky B."}

The service at joanies was excellent, our drinks were constantly filled and the waitress was very attentive to all our needs at all time.  My overall experience at joanies was mmmm FIRST-CLASS and on top of that, the waitres was HOT, and left me hanging with a crush.", "author": "Kevin I."}

Denver Omlette was big enough to share. Chunky breakfast potatoes are seasoned nicely and flavored with onions. Very friendly service. Priced similarly to other places. Very busy on a Friday morning. Cramped seating, but definitely worth a visit. Yummy.", "author": "kurt m."}

The 'host' at the door offered the three of us a tiny table out on the sidewalk as our only option. The manager (owner?) then stepped in and said an indoor table would be available in a couple minutes. Once seated inside, our order was quickly taken by the friendly waitress. Then, we waited & waited & waited. I went to put more quarters in the parking meter & then waited some more. Finally, asked the manager about our order & it came a little while later. My niece liked her French toast & my sister in law liked her omelette. So, got to give them credit for that. My pancakes were bland and the syrup tasted watery. To give them credit, the prices for the breakfast plates are reasonable. On the other hand, they stick it to you with the price of juice & coffee. A glass of OJ was $2.99. The menu advertises it as \"fresh squeezed\" but it was from concentrate. On the way out, my sister in law commented on the long wait for the food and the host was like \"meh.\" I would try some of the other nearby places for breakfast before returning here.", "author": "Dan U."}
