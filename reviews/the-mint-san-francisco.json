We were still able to find seats and get drinks. \n\nThe karaoke was super fun! A lot of people were waiting to sing a song, so I had to wait over an hour before getting up on stage. Nonetheless it's still a good time while you wait. The crowd is super supportive of everyone on stage, regardless of talent. The more you drink, the more you'll be singing along with 'em, haha. The book of song selections was also ginormous! I don't think it's possible to not find a song you'd like to sing in there. The stage you sing on it also kinda cute. It's decorated with a bunch of colorful LED lights. \n\nThe drinks were average for a bar, but I must say those bartenders were on it! Despite the large crowd, I never waited too long for them to catch my attention and ask what I needed. Major props to the bartenders at The Mint!\n\nOverall had a super fun time here, would love to come back on another occasion.", "author": "Camille G."}

The bartenders are great and always mix up a nice (strong) drink to help get that liquid courage going. \n\nYes, a lot of the people that come here can actually sing but it isn't as snooty as the Martuni's crowd at all. If you can't sing and go up and sing no one will boo you and if it is a particularly great song people will sing along and start dancing. Really the atmosphere is so much fun and there is almost always dancing, which I really love. The KJ Frank is sassy but really really fun and promotes people to have a good time whether they are up on stage singing or just dancing on the floor. \n\nAnother plus, is that there is a sushi place right next door and you can also bring outside food in. They take reservations for big parties and have a lot of seating. Just remember cash only but they have an ATM inside so don't worry too much if you forget.", "author": "Stephanie A."}

The Mint is a dying breed of divey karaoke bars, but underneath the grime and grit, there's much fun to be had. It's cash only, so make sure you're ready.

I was with a group of 6, most of my friends are shy and didn't want to sing alone so they put my name on their song requests. I absolutely understand that if my name is on many requests he has the right to space every song so it doesn't seem like I'm signing all the time. However a friend bailed once (shy) in one duet and, in the next duet where my name was still written (so it doesn't look like I'm sneaking in or something) one friend traded with another one of my group to go. The DJ tried to ban my friend from singing on the spot and then, oh so benevolent, allowed her to go sing. We felt very uncomfortable during the whole song, like we weren't welcome, and complained to a group that sang with us in the front only to have the DJ unprofessionally complain on the microphone for everyone to hear, like we were trying to fool the system or something. According to him, we made up names to go ahead, which doesn't make sense since I was the one name in common. He was condescending to my other friends and sent security on us. We were tipping, we were never disrespectful. He wanted to force the shy person to sing basically because it was on the ticket, no changes or spontaneity allowed. We asked the rules beforehand 'cause we wanted to respect the place, but he acted like he had a saying on who sings, regardless of if they wanted to and to know beforehand something they just realized as their names were called.\nWe left, 'cause it's not worth all that attitude. Everybody else in that place is nice, the DJ has a huge ego and an attitude problem. I prefer Festa in Japantown honestly, everyone is nice and welcoming and it's cozy and intimate. This place is so hyped up they think they can treat us like they're doing us a favor. Well, you're not. Never coming back.", "author": "Erika A."}

You can go and see familiar faces every night but you never quite know how the crowd and song selections will synthesize to set the tone. I've gone on a night when the bar was taken over by southerners visiting for a conference (country music performances dominated the evening). I've gone on a night when Jones, one of the regulars, was celebrating his 98TH (NINETY-EIGHTH) birthday. He sang his favorite song (I Got You Babe) with his wife on stage. I've gone on an afternoon when a girl forced her boyfriend on stage to sing a duet with her. He was very reluctant and after a few seconds ran offstage and left the bar with a nosebleed he was so nervous.

I was asked to set it up because they have heard such great things from me and my regular karaoke coworkers. Most had never been there before. They all had an amazing time. First time karaoke peeps felt safe and encouraged. Frank (the KJ) recorded a song of the woman who was leaving and gave it to her as a gift. I was told over and over again what a fun place it was. It made me proud to share my spot with the people I work with and for them to walk away having a great experience.\n\nFor those of you that hate on the staff, please realize how difficult this job is. It's one of the few places where people are blackout drunk on the regular, ignore the rules of one song at a time (yes, put in another song after the one in the que is done), and provide a negative atmosphere. I mean, come on! Clap for EVERYONE! Not just the people in your party. Refrain from talking loudly in front of the stage while other people are singing. It takes guts to go up there and be vulnerable. Be supportive! You create your own experience as much as the place. You're responsible for your own attitude and your own good time. I have and create great experiences there because I love that place and I want to support everyone by being enthusiastic, dancing, and singing along. In this town, there can be quite the myopic and entitled viewpoint. I encourage you to break out of that and give in to fun with your fellow San Franciscans.", "author": "Nicole A."}

I love:\n-- the friendly, welcoming vibe -- the regular patrons make sure everyone gets a nice applause after each performance and are incredibly supportive if it's your first time singing.\n-- professional, fun KJs (especially Frank!) who keep it moving and don't waste time between songs -- love that they announce the lineup for the next few singers so you know when you'll need to make your way to the stage to grab the mic\n-- excellent bartenders -- always fun specials and great Moscow Mules!\n-- when you're hungry, you can pop thru the secret door (okay, guess it's not so secret!) to the Sushi place next door to get a bento box that will be delivered to your table in the Mint! Always yummy! \n-- great sound system--and the KJs make minor adjustments to make you sound even better than you are!\n-- amazing songbook--and if you don't see the song you were hoping for, just ask the KJ because they have thousands of songs that aren't even listed.\n-- clean, tidy restrooms -- yes, I mention it because a few other Karaoke places leave a lot to be desired. \n-- easily accessible from the historic F Market Trolley line (or just a hop and a skip from the N Judah stop)\n\nWhen I heard late last year about the change in ownership, I was initially a bit jittery, but rest assured, the new owners are absolutely committed to retaining the friendly, neighborly and very fun atmosphere.  They even continued the very sweet tradition of laying out a nice spread on Thanksgiving and the other holidays--it makes it feel like family! \n\nHere are some tips if you're visiting for the first time:\n1. Bring cash--there is an ATM on site, but they don't take credit cards\n2. Tip the KJ and bartenders--it's a 2-drink minimum, and the drinks are all reasonably priced, so be generous. And drink a lot!  (The more you drink the better I'll sound!)\n3. Submit only one song at a time. If you're with a group (duo or trio or quartet), it counts as your song. Then, while you're waiting to perform, jot down the name of your next song so you can give it to the KJ when you sing. \n4. To keep the pace of the evening (without a lot of wasted lag time between songs) listen for your name to be announced by the KJ, and then make your way toward the stage as the singer in front of you is wrapping up so you can hop on stage and go. (love that they try to get as many up on stage as possible every night, unlike other karaoke spots that waste a lot of time)\n5. Applaud after each singer performs--almost as important as singing!\n6. Have fun!", "author": "Bevy M."}

During the 4 hours we were there, two of the songs we put in were called. Two.  My friend went up to sing a song that had a male and female part, so I ran up and sang the small female part. The dj asked somebody in my group what my name was and then proceeded to weed through the request jar to remove any slips with my name. He said he didn't want people singing more than one song in a short period of time. But I didn't put my name solo on any slips, several of my friends put me on their request slips to sing with them, so that meant that all of their requests, which they effectively paid to submit (giving tips with each request slip) were removed from the queue. The dj wasn't rude, but just completely unfair. This is definitely another karaoke spot where they let their 2 or 3 regulars dominate the mic, allowing them to sing several songs while 90% of the crowd never got called. It was a huge bummer since my boyfriend is here all the way from New York and was so excited to sing a song with me. We missed out on what could have been a really fun and memorable time together. \n\nBar selection was weird, they had no tequila that was mid-range like a Herradura, only well or Patron-level. \n\nIt's cramped, hot, hard to get a drink and takes forever to wait in line for a small dirty bathroom.  I can't see myself ever returning to the mint.", "author": "Emma H."}

This place is a chill, come as you are, everyone welcomed, no judgement, no negativity spot. Come to be entertained, no singing necessary. Grab a drink, make new interesting friends, have lots of laughs! Even if you SUCK at singing (like me), you can still enjoy some good times, sing along and have a fantastic time! Always an interesting mix of people, no matter what day of the week. This place gets packed though, so if you want to sing, place your song in quickly. It's cash only, but has ATM inside. Fun bar staff and even more amazing regulars. Restaurant next door has yummy sushi, in case you get the munchies! Best part?

If I were the DJ, I would change the volume for every song, and maybe even change the mic volume too depending on the singer (big vs small voice) to balance out the sound. \n\nBut this DJ... omg\nWhen I went up to sing, my song was significantly quieter than the song before and it was a little hard to hear so I asked if he could turn it up. And a simple \"sorry, I can't\" would've sufficed but he snapped at me with an attitude and said, \"this is not a concert!\" and just turned away. So my mic was louder than the song itself. \n\nI get it. He probably gets obnoxious customers that ask him the impossible. But I was not being obnoxious and loud. I was sitting quietly with a friend at the bar, cheering and clapping when others were singing, being a good sport. And I must say, if the song were to be a lot louder than the mic, I would've asked him to lower it. I wasn't trying to turn it into a concert. So I really didn't appreciate the rudeness. I was just bothered by the unbalanced sound. But I guess he doesn't understand this concept or maybe doesn't care enough to do the extra step.\n\nI'm reading the other reviews and see that people have to tip him a 20 or a 40 to get their songs played on a crowded night.

On a karaoke night, a DJ is busy, yes, but he's also the master of ceremonies, setting the tone. We know it is hard to deal with hundreds of ho-hum singers all vying to destroy your mic, but waiting over two hours for a shot at a 3 minute song is a buzz kill. Maybe you have to arrive by 11am to put a song in for 11pm? The math is clear, there are just too many waiting in the random line. \n\nI don't mean to insult anyone, he appears to be working really hard. He might be more approachable to HIS buddies, but a client should not be treated like an annoyance. I asked for nothing special and was polite, quick and geesh... we do this all the time at other places that are happy to host! The dismissive attitude is off-putting. Relaxed, laughing and happy people spend more money. A little humor or chill might go a long way and the tip would have gone from 5 to 20 in a NY minute...if he'd not had such a drill sergeant manner. It's a bar, not a theater production. \n\nNonetheless, we enjoyed cheering everyone on with a little dancing and singing along. Always fun chatting with the easygoing regulars. The place is just way too crowded. Being herded and waiting endlessly is not relaxing after a long day. We sought escape but mostly stood in long lines without a seat for three hours, each time. This was our third time trying, and with all the other options AND djs who effortlessly adjust tunes to individual range, this just isn't worth the fighting to get the busy bartender's attn over the din- nor is the cost of drinks in the tiny plastic cups. \n\nPerhaps the crowd (mostly 20-ish) prefers the fraternity kind of attitude, or maybe it's only because of the limited space and the layout.

Had a large group and people wanted to do songs but he kept turning us down. I get other people also need to sing but he was just being a dick or just kinda rude about it. He could've just told us there's a limit or something. Was super excited to karaoke but he made it a lil sucky. I think slips should go in sequence or if there's too many of the people in the same group, maybe switch every other or every few back to the group.", "author": "Carly C."}

You will not get respect unless you are a gay man or leave a $20 bill in his tip jar, tbh. Highly discourage this place. Pandora is half the price and 100x the fun.

I consider myself a regular patron and continually have had the best time there. Whether I go with a large group for a party or a handful of friends, The Mint never disappoints! Even if you do not like to get up on stage to sing, the crowd and song choices get you dancing and singing along! KJ Frank will add his skills and join you on the dance floor! David and Jim always provide great service at the bar (cash only, but there's an ATM inside) and the security guards at the entrance, Alan and Edward, are just as wonderful! If you get hungry, there is a connecting door to Sushi Delight. You can order at the restaurant and they'll bring it to your table at The Mint.

The bartenders are great and make a good strong drink, but on busy nights, there's a particular regular that bullies new faces into not singing.  This is the third time I've been approached on different nights and was told not so subtly that only the regulars got to sing and not to even try.  I'm not sure how they get away with it, but clearly it's okay with the owners because I can't be the only person who has complained of this on Yelp, as I've told several people who have had the same experience.  Control your people or you'll be stuck with the mediocre talent of those bullies.\n\nAnd, obviously, the DJ is a dick and you literally have to pay him to sing if he doesn't know you.

There's a 2-drink minimum. I went on a weekday, and there were around ~10 others in the bar aside from those in our group. \n\nThis was by far the most-dead, open-mic karaoke place I've visited. The biggest factor was the rude, bouncer DJ, who could've been robot in disguise. He strictly followed rules, shushed us away when we barely talked to him, and didn't bother helping anyone. He let everyone from every other group go first in order. A better DJ would've mixed up songs from different groups and attempted to accommodate our birthday girl. A better DJ would've also rallied the crowd into excitement. That's why you have a DJ instead of a machine. He just stood there the entire time doing very little. I'm honestly not sure of his purpose.\n\nThis DJ (I can't imagine him being a regular karaoke DJ because he obviously had no skills at all in the service industry) was an assembly worker with a rude attitude, and did nothing to make karaoke more lively. Also, why do they only allow 1 person up at the mic at a time? What if you want to sing with a group? I've been to many bars with open-mic karaoke operated by a machine, and they've all been livelier than The Mint.

We walked to downtown SF every work day and would pass The Mint. Since I loved karaoke, we ventured in 27 years ago and it is still one of my favorite places to go in SF. Everyone is always happy, the singers are fairly good to professional (depending on the show in town), the place is not too big and not too small, and depending on the crowd, it could be a great dance experience. The bar tenders are always friendly and personally, my favorite is Frank, who DJs Fridays And Saturdays. And it was nice to see Vic and Eddy usually sitting at the front table but since I don't come in as often, I get the pleasure of waving at them via the security cameras when I come in.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-09-15", "description": "This is THE WORST karaoke bar I have ever been to, and I've been to karaoke bars all over this country, from Miami to Hawaii and many places in between.  I've NEVER experienced such unfriendly bartenders, such a dismissive door person, or rude KJ.  \n\nIn fact, I've had such bad experiences here that I flat-out refuse to go here when I'm invited to friends' birthday parties, social group outings, etc.\n\nOn one occasion, a super-drunk middle-aged guy groped me not once, but TWICE in the same evening, and when I reported him to the door guy, the latter individual pretty much just ignored me and acted like I was the problem, not the gropey guy.  On every occasion I have been to the Mint, the wait to sing has been interminably long, well over an hour, and I noticed that some of the same people sang at least twice during that time, and seemed to be buddies of the KJ.  I've never seen that sort of unprofessional behavior at any other karaoke bar I've been to.\n\nThe worst infraction, however, is that the KJ openly tells the crowd up front that if they don't tip him, he won't play their song.  While it is indeed customary to tip KJ's, typically they are polite about it and don't expect you to tip them until AFTER they've called you up to sing...and I've never heard any other KJ solicit tips like that.  To me, that's not a tip, that's a fee.  The Mint claims on their website that there are no song charges, but given the ultimatums from the KJ, that's splitting hairs.  If they won't play your song unless you give them money, that's a charge, plain and simple.  I've ALWAYS tipped my KJ's well, but it made me a little annoyed to tip this guy, given his rude attitude over his mic and how he seemed to play favorites.  \n\nIt's a shame that The Mint isn't a friendlier scene staff-wise, because it's a great location and has a lot of potential.  If you don't mind the attitude and have a lot of time to kill while waiting to sing, maybe you'll enjoy this place....but I don't.  So, when people invite me to their birthday parties here (inevitably after their group dinner at Bucca di Beppo, another atrocity), I politely decline, promising to take them out for a drink or dinner another evening.  There isn't enough money on this planet to coerce me into going back to The Mint.", "author": "Amy L."}

I got extremely lucky that I happened to find the one spot behind a bus stop on the street. Before that I was circling for a good 15-20 minutes, going really far from the venue. \n\nThe venue itself is much smaller than I imagined for a karaoke bar. When you enter you basically face the edge of the bar; to the right is a narrow walkway where you can order drinks / wait in line for the bathroom. Around 11PM this is a really awkward place to be because you can't tell if people are waiting for the bathroom or trying to get a drink. To the left is the stage and tables for seating. The area in front of the stage is really small (for relation of size, can fit a mini cooper). If you venture behind the stage area then it becomes more secluded.  \n\nThere's a 2 drink minimum for karaoke, but it takes about an hour for your one song request to be played. The crowd is a mixture of middle aged men and women (who were really plastered by 9PM btw) that settles into a younger crowd as the night progresses.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't come here again on my own / for my own celebrations. I was near the back tables that faced the stage, so maneuvering from that area to the bathroom where there's a huge mess of people dancing in front of the \"stage\" .... count me out.

It's really no contest. They have a great song selection. Want to sing the Housemartins? No problem. Strawberry Switchblade? Done. The Smiths? Of course. And don't worry if you're aren't a fan of more obscure bands, they have LOTS of Journey, Billy Joel, Beatles, and Bon Jovi. The drinks are reasonably priced, especially in a town where a well martini can cost you $15 plus tax in some bars. And the staff does a good job. Honestly.\n\nI've perused a few of the reviews that have been posted recently, and while I have no interest in debating other Yelpers whom I don't know or accusing anyone of lying, some of the things that are being said about the staff flat out confuse me. Do the KJs get impatient sometimes? Yes, but someone filed a police report against one of the KJs?!?! I wasn't there, but seriously? Racist bartender ignoring people of color?!?! I'm half black (which in our culture is considered by many to be the same as being 100% black), and I have never been ignored by any bartender at the Mint.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-02-02", "description": "I was severely disappointed by my experience at The Mint tonight.  The KJ on Saturday, Feb 2nd (couldn't catch his name) was rude and unprofessional.  It is 100% because of this KJ that I'm giving The Mint one star, because I want my comments and feedback to be taken seriously.\n\nBecause of my previous positive experience in 2011 - friendly KJ, reasonably priced drinks, reasonable song selection - I was looking forward to my sister's bday party being here.  I arrived with a group of cousins shortly after our reservation at 8.  We got a song book and put in about a half dozen requests (for a group of 8), some of which had repeat singers.  We figured they'd get mixed in with everything that was already submitted, since that's what a KJ does...mix the songs, determine the order, etc.  However, this KJ took one look at the stack of papers, shoved them back in my cousin's face, and said \"Can't you read?  Only 2 requests per person: one solo, one duet.  Figure out which ones you want to throw out.\"  Whoa...OK.  We shrugged this one off as our bad - we hadn't taken the time to read any of the signs in our rush to get our songs in.  \n\nAs we took our stack back to the table to work out with everyone, the KJ got on the loud speaker and announced \"Look folks, I'm only gonna tell you this one more time, it's 2 requests per person.  Figure it out, 'cuz it's about a 2 hour wait as it is and I'm not just going to play your 6 songs in a row.\"   Similar announcements were made about every 15-20 minutes for the next hour, each ruder than the next. Since when is chastising the patrons a successful or appropriate business practice? \n\nAs the night went on, he would insert himself into people's performances by dancing or throwing props at them.  He did so without any enthusiasm, just to be obnoxious, and it was extremely unprofessional.  Acting like a jerk and then half-assedly being fun does not endear you to people.  The music also got progressively louder and harder to hear.  He was blowing out the speakers, playing the background vocals louder than the singers.  You could hardly hear yourself think, let alone converse with the person next to you.\n\nAfter 45 minutes, my sister (the birthday girl) and I had our duet come up.  There was something off with the mics and vocal tracks on the song we chose, a lot of unusual reverb (and no it wasn't our fault, we've done this before).  The KJ was disinterested in the technical difficulties, too busy hugging one of his friends to fix it.  Then he gets on stage with us with a riding crop and \"whips\" us...while we're singing \"Landslide.\"  REALLY?  That seemed appropriate to you, KJ?  I don't know you, you've treated us with nothing but contempt for the last hour, and now you're invading my personal space with a BDSM prop?  This is the kind of crap sexual harassment law suits are made of.\n\nThe icing on the cake was when he announced the solo request I'd submitted, then gave it to another girl with my same name who drunkenly stepped on stage first.  When I called him on it, he just handed my slip back to me without a word.\n\nI'm sorry, Mint, but I'm never coming back.", "author": "Sarah M."}

I've only been to a karaoke lounge once before and it was one of those private room situations. So I could just be unfamiliar with the standard karaoke protocols and procedures but I usually associate karaoking with having fun, being silly and being surrounded by friendly folks and DJs. And I can safely say that the the Mint's DJ was absolutely contradictory to that description. He was extremely mean, aggressive, condescending and infuriated a good handful of us. \n\nThe rules are basically to not sing more than 2 songs by yourself and when going up with groups, you cannot have any of your other friends replace someone in your trio or duo. Yes, you have to fill out a worksheet with your name and your co-singers' respective names as well. These rules are not written down or communicated to you until you find out the hard way - by being screamed at by the DJ. We had a birthday girl in our group and she was not allowed to sing more than her two songs or replace anyone else in their respective groups. \n\nYes, I understand these rules are to keep things flowing smoothly but at the end of the day, we aren't all professional singers and we're there to just have a good time. So accommodating special requests or at the very least, educating us about the rules in a civilized manner is a prerequisite.  dock 3 stars off for this particular reason. And the reason why I still gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because I really liked the bartenders - they were friendly and entertaining. \n\nSo if you must, tread here cautiously and prepared to be yelled at by the DJ at least once over the course of your night.", "author": "Priya S."}

Friday and Saturday nights what you got at the Mint is not just a normal-sized group of karaoke aficionados, each of us with moderate to-slightly- over-sized diva tendencies.. Friday and Saturday nights, you gotta a whole goddamn *mob* of people like us! Packed-in, liquored up, inhibitions loosened and getting looser by the minute, feeding off each other, egging each other on, ready to try *anything* for more attention if we think we can..\n\nWell.. Somebody has to be the guy that says, wait your turn, no you can't do that, We don't have time for any more singers, you're on the waiting list, come on, we gotta keep moving, get on stage in three seconds or you're out. Closing time folks, clear out so your bartenders can cleanup and go home...  Who would you rather that guy be? You or Frank?\n\nSo what Frank has to do is: (1.) keep us animals from becoming a danger to ourselves or others (2.) prevent us from becoming such assholes that we ruin the fun of everybody else (3.) not be such a control freak as to kill the buzz himself.\n\nFrom what I can see, the times I've been there, he does all this. He hurries people up and off the stage, snatches requests slips from our hands, takes our tips, which he might or might *not* honor by bumping us up in the queue, gets people through about 60 songs for the night, (pretty damn good), and does *not* kill the crowd buzz at all, far as I can see. And as long as the Mint has that buzz, people will still go there.", "author": "Weide Z."}

Unfortunately, the DJ was so grumpy that several people couldn't hear him when he blurted out their names when their song was up, and they didn't get the opportunity to sing at all.  I do understand that it's a hectic situation coping with people coming up to check in with the DJ to find out when their turn will come, but he was such a crab apple that it had the effect of casting a pall over the entire singing situation.  I waited for 45 minutes, and finally decided to leave before I got to sing a song to my friend -- which I was dedicating to her, so it was going to be a special moment.  I felt intimidated by Mr. Grumpy running the show, and was discouraged seeing people get skipped over because they didn't know when it was their opportunity to sing.  I am adding a star, however, for the very sweet, helpful and super cute bartenders.  They were excellent.  Perhaps on a night with a different karaoke DJ it would be better.

I go there two to three times per week. \n\nThe bartenders: Brian, David, Tiffany, Jim, Jane, and the new guys, keep things running pretty smoothly behind the bar.  Honestly, the higher end booze will run you quite a bit in the wallet; but, $4.50 for a tap microbrew or $6.00 for a Jack and Coke is still a decent deal. \n\nA lot of people are harping on skinny Frank for being a bit militant in his job.  Well, when you have drunken idiots that aren't paying attention or following the rules properly, you tend to have to be more stern with people no matter what your job is. \nHe lets people know (usually about 3 songs in advance) when it's their turn on stage.  If it takes you more than three songs to get your butt up there, it's your fault not his. \n\nIf you're worried about not being a very good karaoke singer, I will tell you what I tell all Mint newbies: 'There will always be a singer on stage that's worse than you'.  Friday nights and Saturday nights guarantee that. If you go on one of those two nights and want to sing more than one song, I suggest arriving no later than 7:30 p.m..  When it gets to a standing room only sized crowd, expect the singing wait to be well over two hours. \n\nThe Monday through Thursday crowds are pretty mellow.  On those nights, you'll have anywhere from 5 to 20 people there.  Slow nights will get you at least 3 songs on stage.  If you want to be there on a night with mostly good singers, I would suggest coming in on Wednesday nights.  Not sure how/why it works out like that, but it does. \n\nAnd, if you don't want to sing, at least show that you have a soul and applaud for the performers.  No laughing at them (unless it's a funny song) and no booing.  Trying to sing over your loud office party conversations isn't easy, so save work talk for work. \n\nOne final major note: This is a CASH ONLY bar.  They do have an ATM in the bar but it's better to get cash ahead of time so you don't hold up the bartenders' time. \n\nHave a great time and PLEASE, for the love of God, don't sing 'Don't Stop Believin''.  :)", "author": "Paul V."}

But, I hear people complain to the KJ (Karaoke Jockey) that they've been waiting for over an hour to sing. Well, here's how it works: You put in a song, you wait for the other people in the queue who put their song in first to sing before you and when it is your turn, he/she will call you up to sing. \n\nI am an avid karaoke-er and I have seen how other places work and I know for a *fact* that Frank (One of the KJ's at the Mint) moves people through most efficiently at the Mint. Think about it. You have an average of about 3.5 minutes for a song, right? Now, let's say 25 people are singing. That's about an hour and a half wait. This isn't due to bad performance on the staff's part; Quite the contrary. It just has to do with people wanting to sing their hearts out and having to simply wait their turn.\n\nOh, and keep in mind, the weekends are ALWAYS crazy busy, even almost up to capacity sometimes.\n\nMy advice:\n* Go early (before 6-ish)\n* Go on an \"off\" night, such as a Monday or a Thursday or a Sunday. \n* Put your song in as soon as you get there...don't worry, you'll be drunk by the time you sing (or you'll just be ready to sing), that way you don't have to wait for a whole hour after you decide. You can always say nevermind. \n* Tip your Barstaff and Doorman!\n* Tip your KJ! (Usually a dollar a song)\n* Have a party here! Almost everyone loves karaoke!\n\nAnother thing I love about the Mint is that everybody cheers, and everyone is welcome! I've always felt like this is my home away from home. They take good care of their patrons and the drinks are very reasonable. The bar is well stocked with all kinds of stuff and almost all of the bartenders have all been there longer than a decade.

Yes their Karaoke DJ has sass, and enjoys ending the night with his own number. Yes, he has little patience for laggers, and wasted belters. Yes the bartenders can get snippy. But alot of the quirky staff's 'tude stems from their passion for their place, and their dedication to REAL karaoke.\n\nThe Mint consistently brings in tremendously talented regulars each night, who can belt out Whitney Houston and Prince with the best of them. I was blown away by the numbers when I came here awhile back. I felt as if I was at an intimate concert. Each performance kept on getting better and better, and it's because - essentially they were.\n\nThe charm of the Mint is in their crowd and the atmosphere. It's cozy, warm and welcoming. People stand up and cheer people on, as they stumble through lyrics. They dance to the outstanding numbers. \n\nWhen you leave at the end of night, there's a sense that you will be seeing everyone real soon, because you will.  \n\nVisit the Mint, just don't expect the crowd to be pleased with your wasted screeching, and don't expect a warm bartender. \n\nOnly come here if you're ready to take your karaoke seriously.\n\nTrust.", "author": "Jessica T."}

The Mint is like if my favorite karaoke bars ever (Kajuns in New Orleans and Montero's in New York; please refer to my U.S. Karaoke Tour list and book your plane tickets immediately to experience the magic and wonders of both places and understand what I mean) had a love-child that also allows you to watch what you would look like if your dream of being able to sing on television ever were to come true. Your performance is broadcast to the entire bar on TVs expertly positions in the aforementioned pockets with poor views; ingenious!\n\nThe bartenders here are wonderful! Incredibly friendly, hardworking, and frequently singing along to the songs, which is basically all I could ever ask for in a bartender. The patrons are a mixed bag of all sorts, making for interesting conversations and even more interesting karaoke playlists. The decor makes me feel like I'm an entertainer on a cruise ship, which I think is great as I love kitschy fun.\n\nThe only downside is the finicky KJ! He is quite strict about his rules, which I still have not deciphered. I think they go something like \"I do whatever I want and if you don't piss me off you will get to sing....eventually....maybe...or maybe not.\" Not a very great karaoke spirit!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-13", "description": "My Rating= 4.5 stars\n\nWho Mint is for:  Singers, people who have a good attitude, like to meet new people, people who can laugh at themselves (and others)\n\nWho Mint is not for:  People who take themselves too seriously (you know the too-much-makeup-princesses and the too-cool-for-school guys).  People who really can't stand loud noise.\n\n \n\nI read all the reviews and was as pumped as I was nervous to go sing my favorite jams at the Mint.  The first thing I have to say is the asian KJ was not anywhere near the karaoke nazi I had read about in some of these reviews.  He wasn't the most cheerful or funny person in the world but he surely wasn't mean.  I even commited the cardinal sin of putting in a second song choice while my first was still pending.  (That's actually listed on the wall as what not to do, but its listed really small on one side of the bar.  All he did was give it back to me and tell me to put it in when I sing my first song.  No biggie.\n\n \n\nI'd also like to preface by saying: I am a total karaoke nut and try to sing at every karaoke bar I see.  I love it. I've been around and I can honestly say, as far as energy and vibe this place was THE BEST I've ever seen.  All good fun and good people singing and dancing along.  Song selection was huge, but not quite as modern as I would've hoped, but I sing weird songs like Muse, Marilyn Manson etc so I almost never see those anywhere anyways.  All the classic standards were there as well the 80-90s classics, even a lot of show tunes, it is the Castro after all! J  Not too many songs from 2000 + but that's ok.  Still one of the most diverse song lists I've ever seen.\n\n \n\nThere are a ton of singers.  I was shocked. At most places usually only a small percentage of patrons actually sing on stage.  Not here...  At the Mint probably 75% of the patrons actually get up and sing.  The KJ keeps things moving as quickly as possible, which is definitely a good thing when dealing with that many singers. The flip side to that coin is you can probably sing only once every 1 to 1.5 hours, so don't hold back on your best songs because more than likely you are only getting on stage at most 2 times.  I did see some people go 3 times but that was in a four hour span (9pm to 1am).  I went 2 times. Priority is given to the new singers, as is standard.  I didn't see any favoritism in singing order so that was good a thing.\n\n \n\nThe sound system is LOUD for sure but also somewhat muddy. So you really have to rise above it.  It caters well to belters (like myself) and females with higher pitched voices.  The volume only increases as the night goes on.  If you're a rookie going solo for the first time and aren't good with projecting into a mic or have a softer voice you better get on stage early (like before 1030) because after that it gets loud. As the night wears on the singers are either really good or really funny (lots of group singers too).  This stage is not a place for the timid ones.... I am usually loud enough that at other places they have to turn my mic down from the norm, but not here... I was able to wail at full tilt on the normal setting.  \n\n \n\nFor the non-singers: Even if you don't like to go on stage its still fun to sing and dance along, you will know most of the songs.  My buddies don't care for karaoke in general but they had at blast and are dying to go back.  One of them said.  \"I sang my ass off.... and I didn't even go on stage!!\"\n\n \n\nThe bar is good.  The bartenders serve pretty good mixed drinks which are reasonably priced. $4.50/ea for a good selection of beers (Stella, Amstel, Speakeasy, Peroni...) The stiff long islands were like $7.50 I think.  The bartenders work hard and fast and are very pleasant.  Even gave me free agua with a smile as I was trying to slow down.\n\n \n\nThe only things keeping this from being a 5 star review is the fact that its cash only, and the building itself.  Its small, crowded, really loud, and hot/stuffy.  I cant imagine that place in the summer, you better be ready to sweat!\n\n\nAll in all we had an absolute blast and will definitely be back for more!", "author": "John S."}

We put the place to the test, showing up with about 50 people by the end of the night. The bartenders and KJ performed admirably, slinging drinks and spinning discs all night long.\n\nDrinks are cheap -- I was drinking $5 shots of Bulleit.\nNo *official* food but you can bring food in, including sushi from the place next door (which will bring your order to you through the magical door between venues).\n\nIf you want to sing, get there early and put your requests in as soon as you can, because it can be quite a wait to get up on stage. The KJ is a nice guy but he runs a tight ship: if you're not there when he calls your name you'll get skipped. He also (rightly) doesn't like jokers who pick songs and then don't know how they go. Who does that? Nobody wants to hear you failing to sing Journey.\n\nI think my favorite thing about the Mint is that nobody is judgmental about your music picks (so long as you can perform them!). I've seen one night span the range from 20-something women belting out Adele to gays with Gaga, frat boys and (presumably on a dare) Seal, and 60-somethings doing Petula Clark hits.

Not spectacular, but I haven't found that in San Fran yet. I've only managed to hit two karaoke places yet though.\n\nThe good: wow, this karaoke DJ is the greatest expediter of songs I've ever seen. He doesn't need filler songs because he manages to circulate people back to back to back. I had to wait two hours to sing on a busy Friday night, but during that time I think about 50 people sang. Very impressive.\n\nThe song selection wasn't spectacular. There were a lot of bands with more songs that I usually see listed, which was cool, but at the same time some of my favorites were missing. An example: A-Ha / Take on Me.\n\nFor those of you a bit more intimately familiar with karaoke sound systems, I had a little bit of trouble with the wedge monitor. The DJ turned down my vocals in response to me singing rather loud, which killed the vocals coming out the monitor so I mostly heard just the backing track. It was kind of hard to hear myself, although my friends said I sounded fine.\n\nIt's the first time I've had the monitor work against me (normally it's really nice to have so you can hear yourself!) and it took me a little while to figure out exactly what happened. I suppose today I learned, if I'm ever tuning a karaoke sound system myself, to make the wedge monitor more vocal heavy than the main mix so that if I turn down the mic in response to a loud singer they'll still be able to hear themselves.\n\nI'll certainly be back here, possibly even tomorrow.", "author": "Tony A."}

I can be however a great spectator and that's exactly what I did on this fateful night. \n\nAround 8pm on a Sunday this is a pretty mellow place, but as the night got going, it started to really fill in. There was Guinness on tap which proved to be a pretty good start. As people took their turns on stage, I thought to myself these people sound pretty good.

We browsed Yelp events, but nothing really struck us. So we simply Yelp searched Monday Nights and came up with a list of primo places. We started off by hitting up The Mint.\n\nThe place is a bit small and I felt a little claustrophobic, but everyone was friendly and I can't turn down a karaoke joint. You can't beat no cover. We were able to sit down right away and get our singing on.\n\nEveryone was really nice. There were a few obnoxious drunks, but they were thrown out relatively quickly and the mood lightened up a great deal. People were supportive of even the crappiest of singers. Everyone got super animated when a good song would go. A few people high fived me and came over to congratulate me on attempting a song in Spanish. This was great!", "author": "Ericka A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-06-22", "description": "The Mint is such a complicated place to give a review. It's both a bar, and a karaoke place, and both sides have pros and cons....\n\nAs a bar, The Mint actually does really well. The drinks are well prepared, if a bit overpriced, and tend to be reasonably strong. The bartenders are perky, friendly, and never ever rude. In fact, they seem hellbent on making sure oyu have everything you absolutely need. Also impressive is how well they deal with crowds. The Mint tend to be packed, especially during the weekends, but I've never had to fight to make a drink order. \n\nSadly, as a bar that is perpetually crowded, it is also perpetually loud. I wish I could blame this on the karaoke, but no, it's just friggin loud. Good luck with conversation. Also, seating comes at a brutal premium. I've yet to successfully get a table, and even getting seats at the bar is a trial.\n\nAs a karaoke place, I both love it and hate it. The song list is staggering. If you can't find the song you want, it probably is imaginary, or straight up doesn't exist. The patrons at the Mint tend to range anywhere in skill from jaw dropping amazing to \"oh lord kill me please.\" This disparity often widens if there's a birthday party or celebration. Also, as the night continues, and the drinks flow, things go a bit downhill. Still, everyone is having a good time.\n\nThe wait at The Mint to actually sing karaoke is positively insane. You are going to wait over an hour, at minimum. Actually make it two. No, you probably won't sing at all. If you're expecting to sing, be happy with performing a single song. You probably won't be going again. This can be incredibly frustrating.\n\nThe KJ deserves special note. He can be nice. He can. Really. I've seen it. Sadly, most of the time he's a terse, pissy jerk. Handing him a song slip garners an angry look of \"oh you too?\" And don't ever dare ask where you are in the rotation, as he will never react well. Lastly, if he tells you to be ready, you better as all hell be ready, or he will skip you without a second look, or remorse. Granted, I get it, he's trying to run a tight ship, but man can he be a grumpy, mean man to deal with.\n\nSo, why 4 stars. Well, for all the horrible things I've said, the place is still amazingly fun. I've never had a bad night at The Mint, even if I never sing. The patrons are fun and chatty. The performers tend to be boisterous. People are all having a grand ol time. Oh sure, you may not get to sing, but if you bring a group, you will get sucked up into the upbeat vibe of the place.", "author": "Adam G."}

Others have indicated his name is Kevin, but I can't confirm that.\n\nThe evening there started off promising. The 8 of us arrived at 9:30 and it was packed - no where to really hang as a group. Suddenly, someone who said that they were the owner and was standing at a table near the door, offered up his table to us. And it was right next to the KJ booth. We thought that was a major score! We made our song selections and I walked up to the KJ and asked where the slips of paper were (there wasn't any on our table). He rolled his eyes, scoffed, and said \"on the tables, bar, anywhere\". Geez, sorry I didn't see them right away! So that was annoying, but no big deal, so I filled out the slip and listed my name. Our other friends requested a song as well. A couple of minutes later he leans over and shouts something at me. I go up to the booth and said I didn't hear him. He shouts again (in a very condescending tone) that it's a duet so I have to have two names listed. Really?!? Who the f*** cares? But, I kept my comments to myself and wrote my wife's name on the list. Keep in mind this is about 9:40 at this point. I should note that we saw people giving him tips and mysteriously they sang at least 2 songs. We were having drinks and enjoying the music and generally having a good time. About 11pm, my buddy and I go outside for maybe 5-10 minutes to cool down - but my wife and the rest of my friends remained inside and were listening for our names. Then about 11:20 or so, he leans over his booth, gives me a nasty look and slashes his thumb under his neck like I'm done (is there a name for that?). I get up again and go over to him and asked him what he was trying to say. In a nasty tone (does he have any other?) he said we missed our turn! He claims he called out our names and we missed it. I said that was impossible, my wife was 2 feet from him. I then asked him about our friends song. He said he called that one out as well. That was the final straw. All 8 of us (6 during a 5-10 minute stretch) were listening for our names. I asked him if we didn't get called because we didn't tip him. He just laughed. Well, I finally lost my cool. I told him to f*** off and flipped him the bird. As expected with somone so pissed off at the world, he returned the gesture. Great customer service all the way around!\n\nI do want to say there were some positives about the place. Great vibe, fun people, a mixture of \"too serious\" and \"just out to have a good time' singers, bartenders were cool, and the drinks were reasonable.\n\nI would love the place if it wasn't for the douche KJ, so we'll try it again when he isn't working.....", "author": "Scott G."}

A pretty good beer selection, nicely stocked full bar, and surprisingly clean restrooms. Pretty much every song you could imagine for karaoke, with a nice big stage complete with fancy lighting.\n\nWhere The Mint goes wrong, it goes horribly wrong. And that's with the staff. The karaoke dude the night we attended was painfully unfriendly and at times downright rude. You could definitely tell he was biased toward the regulars, as it seemed like any place we stood was not okay and I just felt like he was barking at us the whole time. Plus, no drinks on stage? Worst rule ever. The bartender was no better, also a fan of the barking. The minute we walked in he yelled at us because he needed our IDs. Um, no need to yell, and why don't you have a bouncer, or just card us when we order our bevvies?

He lambasted a poor girl for not knowing how to turn on the mic, took over a song to sing himself, and cut off some people during a song. \n\n6. It's advised to tip the KJ when giving a request to get moved ahead in line, but we didn't and were somehow still able to sing two songs on the busy Friday night before Pride weekend. Go figure.\n\nAll in all, decently priced drinks, a HUGE music selection, and a packed room (because karaoke sucks in an empty room) makes for a great karaoke bar.", "author": "Jennifer B."}

Sometimes it's great...sometimes it's a bust.  We hit the jackpot on Saturday night, and I definitely see myself rolling the dice with The Mint again in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBeing that The Mint is a proper karaoke bar (karaoke 7 days a week, 365 days a year), their bible of song options is several inches thick, with almost anything you can come up with.  The diversity and support of the crowd really made the night, and no matter if your pipes were golden or tin...everyone was applauded and supported.  If you take issue with loud music in general, combined with the strong possibility of the person next to you screaming hell-bent at the top of their lungs along with Deniece William's \"Let's Hear It For The Boy,\" you may wish to consider another venue for your weekend night.  \n\nBONUS!\nThe adjoining sushi bar will deliver fare straight to your table, and it's not half bad.  An order of spicy tuna and spider roll and a few Grey Goose + club sodas is sometimes just what one needs in order to find the courage to rock out Madonna's \"Lucky Star\" to a packed house (JM, ZT, C).  \n\nDrinks are a little on the pricey side, but considering the night's worth of entertainment we received - I didn't leave feeling robbed in the least.  Whether you're a wallflower, or a full-blown attention whore...The Mint has awesome potential to satisfy everyone.  I woke up with a headache and only a shred of my voice, and don't remember the last time I had so much fun. \n\nCASH ONLY!

The Mint is where people gather to sing in public and get on stage whether or not they can carry a tune. Frankly, it doesn't even matter if you are out of tune. You can barely hear the person sing because the crowd will sing on top of you. The Mint is a huge sing-a-long fest. Highlights of the night included a rendition of \"All That Jazz\", \"Like a Prayer\", \"Jack and Diane\", \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\", and my very own Idol moment of \"Since U Been Gone.\"\n\nThe fun part was hanging out friends and pushing each other to get on stage. I couldn't wait. I love the limelight. However, the wait for your song is so long that you have plenty of time to chicken out and have your friends liquor you up. I'm sure it is an endless cycle.

The crowd was pretty tame when we got there, but my group got everyone on their feet and it had turned into somewhat of a dance club by the time we left at 11pm. \nThere's a lot of \"professional\" karaokers, but pay not attention.

Despite being labeled a gay bar since 1968, the year I was born, it's overwhelmingly straight. Mostly gaggles of girls in college drama departments who bring the occasional gay bff or reluctant boyfriend. It's way too crowded and the horseshoe bar in the middle of the room occupies way too much floor space.

I, Kevin S, nearly got up in public, with a live microphone and no sense of rhythm, to sing the the Rolling Stones' 1980 love-it-or-hate-it semi-classic, \"Emotional Rescue\".\n\nWe're talking about a song so weird not even the Rolling Stones have performed it live, but I, Kevin S, who quit dancing in public decades ago, nearly performed it in front of real people I don't know, members of my family (slightly drunk nephew) and the intimidating karaoke and true music dynamo, my BF, sweet little IQ.\n\nHow could such a thing happen?  If Mick Jagger, whose vocal chords produced this musical unicorn, has never deigned to vocalize it in public, who the hell am I to try it?\n\nI blame it all on the Mint.  \n\nOnce you get beer number three going and you see how chummy and convivial and all-accepting the crowd is, you find yourself thinking you can do all sorts of things.

His frequent presence at the DJ podium is the only reason the Mint fails to draw five stars from me.\n\nThat DJ's presence was truly the the only reason that I did not actually sign up for Emotional Rescue and when my name was called get up and start to sing, thus bringing our universe, yours and mind, and all history to a complete blinding halt just seconds into the slithering falsetto vocal, \"Is there nothing I can say nothing I can do?

There is something for everyone here!\n\nThe Mint is an awesome place for group parties or just coming in on a lazy Sunday afternoon and enjoying a cocktail and a song with some friends. The crowd is SUPER diverse... gay, straight, questionable (lol), old, young, hipsters, hippies, crazies, etc. haha. Except the latter... well, Ted,  the awesome door-man does pretty well to keep them out. ;)\n\nThe downside to The Mint is that yes, it can get WAY too crowded. Honestly, I think sometimes they should stop allowing people in after a certain point. Especially when you can barely MOVE in the wall-to-wall sea of people. It's highly annoying and anxiety-inducing, let me just tell you. But no, they keep letting more and more people in, even when there is literally no where for them to go.\n\nAlso yes, it can take a LONG time to sing, but people- that's what tipping is for. If you REALLY wanna sing and there are 75 people who put in a song slip before you, slipping the KJ $10 bucks or more will really help. That's just the way it is. Quitcher bitchin! (Oh, but tipping doesn't work on everyone... certain people who run the KJ booth on off days are sticklers about putting people up in the order they gave the song, no matter what).\n\nIn conclusion, if you haven't discovered the awesome-ness that is The Mint yet... well, what are you waiting for?! Grab some friends and go immerse yourself in karaoke therapy. Oh yeah, and if you happen to see me there, come say hello. :D", "author": "Tiffany R."}

The atmosphere is welcoming and entertaining.  The bartenders were generous and friendly.  The crowd is warm and encouraging and a lot of the singers are extremely talented.  The problem however lurks on the stage.  I think it's important to mention that THE MINT must first upgrade their system.  There is software available to put the name and song of the NEXT THREE SINGERS on the screen. This place would be great if it weren't for the Asian Hitler of Karaoke.  He's the DJ and he's a very vile man. Upon arrival to the venue (at about 10:30p), we were greeted at the door by a very pleasant man as though he awaited our arrival.  We were celebrating a bachelorette party and he ushered us right in.  Everything moved along quickly as we ordered our drinks and debated which songs to sing. 2.5 hours and several drinks later, no one in our group had stepped foot on stage. During the 2.5 hrs, we enjoyed the song selections of other people, but mostly we were appalled at the DJ's demanding presents and harsh criticisms for each person he called upon stage. And, YES...he had to have the microphone to YELL the names of the next three singers.  (First, you have 3-sec to fight through the crowd then if you don't sing on key, he will cut off the end of the song and snatch the mic.!  [However, he allowed my rendition of Gladys Knight's \"Neither One Of Us\" to play through the end! ;)] \nHere's where the drama starts...At one point, when a girl finished singing \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", Hitler told her to \"get off the stage and go back to GAY-VILLE!\"   Now, regardless of what happened while she was singing the song, that comment was completely unprofessional.  I'm not even gay and I was offended!  This guy proceeded to chase the girl down the isle to escort her to the door.  He made her leave because during her performance she left the stage and walked around to her friends who sang different parts of the song (because it's a GROUP song).  His argument was that THEY have already had their chance to sing!\nAnyway, later on at the close of the night...a girl in our group had a similar experience.  Hitler was yelling at someone for something, and she looked back and said, \"That's why he doesn't have any TIPS!\"  Ohhh, you should have seen Hitler!  Here he comes AGAIN, chasing her down the isle to tell her \"That was a RUDE comment and you need to leave!\"  Well, guess what ass-wipe? The bar is closing ANYWAY!!\n\nA message to THE MINT: \nIf you guys want to keep a healthy clientele, upgrade your system and find a new DJ.  This guy will be the death of your business.", "author": "Lynne H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-12-21", "description": "I would have to say that my life has changed since discovering The Mint, both for the good and the bad.  It has made Tuesday nights the highlight of my week, and caused me to wonder how well I could sing just about every song I hear, which I'm pretty sure is not very well.  On the other side, Wednesdays are pretty useless and I think I've caused permanent damage to my vocal cords.  I'd known of The Mint from stories, fairy tales and legends for a while, but one fateful night after having a few beers at Dopleganger (or whatever it's called), a friend and I found ourselves there, waited about 1.5 hr to finally single song.  Since then, we have been rushing out of work, leaving unfinished projects hanging in the wind for a blissful night of song, beer and friends.\n\nFrom our first visit to The Mint we realized the awesomeness of this karaoke bar.  First of all, there is the song book.  It's weighs like 5 pounds and is the size of a telephone book.  The list of songs is exhaustive, just try to flip through it page by page, and spans genres, artists, and the ages.  Probably you won't find some obscure indy artist that sells like 50 records, but if it's been on the radio a movie, on TV, you're likely to find the song you want to sing.   No matter what kind of mood I am in, and I'm a pretty moody person, I can always find something that matches it.  And usually after a few songs and beers I am in a pretty good mood.  \n\nNext, there's the Tuesday KJ, Emma.  The KJ booth is definitely his domain and if you want to sing your song it can help to greese his palm a little.  He's a really sweet guy though.  He always chatting with the regulars around the bar and slowly getting sloshed as the nights go on.  I'v eput in a few songs that were not on his computer, so he's come and found me to let me know.  He keeps the night moving along, quickling passing up songs requests that no one shows up for and restatring songs for those who are a little slower at getting up to the stage.  I also love how he controls the lighting effects in the bar, for the rocky ballads, the flame lights are especially awesome.\n\nThe crowd at The Mint is pretty cool too.  Some of the regualars have pretty kickass voices and can really work the stage or crowd.  Some maybe don't sound as good, but they are still just as into every song they sing.   Every one of them I have talked to has been very friendly.  Obviously, there are the ramdoms that show up from week to week, and they get more random and drunk as the night goes on.  But everyone is there to have a good time.  No one really heckles the singer, no matter how off they may bee, actually there are moniters around the bar so everyone can drown out a bad voice or join in on a great song from the comfort of their chair or stool.  It can get pretty crowded as the night wears on and pretty hard to get a song in, so it goes, that's why we try to show up at 7:00.\n\nI've only had beer their; they have a decent selection and it's not bad priced and the bar tenders are nice and pretty efficient.  Oh, that's a lie, I might have had some Jager shots too, i don't remember.  The bathrooms stay in good condition through the night. \n\nThis review is not too long.\n\nThe Mint is awesome!", "author": "Adrian L."}

The Mint is right on the corner of Duboce and Market, meaning parking is a biotch.  I ended up walking 3 blocks to get a parking spot.  I guess that's not bad, but when you live in the South Bay, you're used to parking.\n\nI've been to the Mint twice, and those times were 2 years apart.  This last time was for two friends' birthdays.  The entire right side is a bar while the left side is a seating area with tables where people can drink and spectate karaoke performances.  There was another party going on there, so with 60-something people crowded into a section with no more than 10 tables, it started feeling like a club.  I think I inadvertently felt up 3 women and a dude.\n\nThis place is all about karaoke.  You pick a song from their GINORMOUS list of songs, and the \"dj\" (kj is more like it) calls you up when it's your turn and you go up to the small stage and sing your heart out.  The TVs around the bar only have the words and are timed so you know when to sing them.  None of those weird images of ducks in a pond, random skylines, or half nekkid people dancing in paint and feathers.  Just words.\n\nThe KJ will really get into sometimes, occasionally performing himself or joining in the dancing.  The stage is about 10'x8', so if you really want to crowd in, about 10-12 people can get all up in there.  There are only 3 mics that I know of, and if you are really good (or bad), they'll record you and they'll play it back in between songs.  Crikey.\n\nAll in all, The Mint is a great place.  It's kind of obvious there are a few regulars there (usually middle aged white guys) who are pretty decent and probably sing the same songs over and over.  I kinda shudder imagining that this is how they attempt to pick up younger chicks.  And now I wish I was dead.", "author": "Dave K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-04-25", "description": "These rules have been passed on to me, and I haven't tested every one of them, but they've yet to lead me wrong: Don't go if it's a weekend. Don't stay after midnight.\n\nI'm tempted to dock it some stars because of that. I'm tempted to dock it some stars because of some bad experiences friends have had with certain KJs. But the weekend overcrowding and late night dismal drunks would happen at any karaoke joint of this quality, so I can't fault them for that. And the KJs have been pretty good to me, personally, and really, I've seen way worse tip favoritism at other places.\n\nJust to be clear, this criticism does not apply to either Bartender Ben or KJ Tiffany. No criticism does: Ben's a saint who makes good drinks and makes sure everyone has a ton of fun, and Tiffany's a superstar who keeps the music going, gives people tons of heads up when it's busy, and just keeps the attitude up the whole time. Both knew me by name already on my second visit, and partly that's because I rocked so hard, but they still had to care about what they were doing enough to notice, and they did. \n\nBut on to the really strong points: Selection. I can't count the number of songs I've been looking for years for, that they have here. On top of that, they have songs I never would have expected to find at any Karaoke joint. Case in point: Sex Shooter by the Apollonia 6. Holy moley!\n\nYou also get a great, great range of people and music here. Pretty much every other karaoke joint has catered to or attracted one particular crowd above others, with some diversity; here you have a real great mix of people with a wide variety of musical tastes. You'll hear lounge act standards, classic rock hits, recent hip-hop, country-western ballads, showtunes... Performed by people you'd expect, and sometimes by those you'd not expect. And you hear great, genuinely talented singers, and people who can't sing much but no how to work the stage, and people who seem perpetually uncomfortable but are just willing to do it anyway. The crowd has, without fail, appreciated everyone for who they are, no matter how bad or good or serious or goofing-around they've been.\n\nAlso in its favor: Video screen above the bar, very ample seating, better drink prices than I would have expected... Yeah. It's my new favorite weekday destination in the city. If you have The Love for karaoke (all it is and all it can be) I recommend taking it here.", "author": "Wayne W."}

The problem is, when you are at the Mint you must buy a drink to be able to sing ! I did not know this rule, but the problem is they have only alcohol drinks when i was there (dont know now any better policy about different kinds of drinks other than alcohols), but i CAN NOT and I NEVER DRINK alcohol ! so the only choice is orange juice, and their orange juice did not taste very good either, i am not sure their alcohol drinks, maybe they are better at this so other people who drink alcolhol like them. Anyway, i do not have many choice for drink as i got tired of their tasteless orange juice, so i did not order any drink, but i registered for singing, and this DJ was really mean. Among a lot of people there, like over thirty people, and he noticed me did not order drink, and so he left me out of the list, never called me for my song when it was up to my turn. \n\nthen, i came up and asked and he was rude and told me i was not allowed to sing because i did not order the drink ! \n\nI was upset and i thought how much is the drink that i make the Mint lose their sale ?

I was there with a decent sized group of work friends.  We were already drunk when we showed up, and prepared to spend some serious cash on drinks and getting our karaoke on.  The bar was not at all crowded so we thought we'd get to get a few decent songs in.  Alas, thanks to the tyrannical DJ, it was not to be.  We waited 2 hours to sing one song.  Tipping didn't seem to help.  The lady running the show was rude as all get out, and ran it with all the \"I'm in charge here\" ego-tripping of a TSA agent at the airport.  She'd get on the mic and announce the next 5 singers, and if you weren't right there ready to sing, you were out.  \"Am I making myself clear, people?\" was a consistent refrain.  Yeah, that's fun.  \n\nThen, in her wisdom, she instituted the inexplicable rule that if your name wasn't on the slip of paper you turn in, you could not get on the stage.  So when a friend of mine finally had his turn to sing Living on a Prayer, he tried to bring up someone else to help him out.  But her name -- it wasn't on the slip! So she was not allowed on stage to take the second mic.  We argued for a bit with the DJ, trying to understand the point of this rule.  She responded by calling the next singer, leaving my friend standing baffled on stage.  We left right then, vowing never to return.  It was insane.  \n\nOne other point. You couldn't open a tab with a credit card at the bar.  It was as if they didn't want our money.  Well, so be it.", "author": "Cody H."}

My only regret at the end of the night is that they had a better selection of Hall & Oates tunes.\n\nNow onto point number two. I'm not sure what his motivation is, but every time there is a microphone on stage, especially at the Mint, the boy requests some slow-jammin, heavy-seducin' R&B number.

We went there after our work's holiday party and thank goodness one of my coworkers is a veteran on the karaoke circuit because she had already reserved a spot in advance. Not going to a Karaoke bar before I was under the impression that I would be sitting in a nice comfy couch while I sipped exotic drinks and made fun of the entertainment (disclaimer- if I sang you would also be making fun of me- I'm no song bird.) When we got there at 7:30 the place was already pretty packed and we had a reserved section by the bar. We ended up having to stand by the bar which has a very narrow walkway. It was uncomfortable and we were constantly in the way of the staff and guests using the restroom. As far as a bar goes it was OK. My friend had a dirty martini and it was pretty good.\n\n Before going here are some things to think about. \n\n1. the place is very smaaaall. If you're going after 9 you will be waiting a long time to sing. We showed up at 7:30 and we had to wait at least 30 minutes. \n2. Do not make the DJ mad. I guess some woman made a comment at the front that he did not like and let me tell you.... Mr don't play...he got on the mic and set her straight. \n3. The audio/visual equipment is not the greatest. Of cours,e I don't know the condition of other places. But the screen kept skipping. \n4.

There are plenty of songbooks around, so everyone gets a chance to flip through the catalog and pick out the perfect song (Beastie Boys, in my case...

He keeps things running smoothly all night, which is something akin to herding kittens.   And, if you're lucky, you'll get to see him perform a karaoke song himself, and he's excellent.

So I guess that qualifies me to write a review.  First I want to address people talking smack about Frank.\n\nI've been doing the same job as him since around 2003.  Yah, I treat my regulars better, but guess what?  They treat me better than strangers.  That's just life folks. \n\nFrank not taking care of you unless you tip?  You try making as much money as a waiter at dennys while some drunk, demanding, abusive jerk reads you the riot act about how you should run things to favor them for free.  \n\nHow about this.  How about some of the karaoke loonies?  That 1% that just sucks at your soul with their psychotic delusions constantly demanding your attention. Maybe you're not aware of the crazies that say such off the wall things as \"I sing blondie better than blondie\" or \"Paul Mc Cartney hired the secret service to break up me and Stevie Nicks\".   Yes, there are people that say these things (they actually believe it) and guys like me and Frank have to deal with them and all their drama and BS on a nightly basis.\n\nThen you got your cool regulars.  The ones that understand simple little concepts like 50 people times 3 minutes a song equals 150minutes between turns in rotation.  Folks that know you got a horde of noobs trying to crash down your KJ booth from their lack of understanding like a scene out of Lord of the Rings.  Me and Frank are *LUCKY* when we have a night of regulars that understand we're doing the best we can to accomidate all these people.\n\nIt's not that we're favoring them.  They just know how shit works and it doesn't take us much to accomidate them.  I'd much rather take care of 3-4 regular customers 1 minute problems, than deal with the 8 minute problem of some noob.\n\nLike, we print books.  It's not hard.  Shit's listed alphabetically by artist or by song.  Why do you have to ask us \"Do you have this song?\" C'mon people, Alphabetically, by artist, or by song.  This is stuff you should have learned the meaning of in the 3rd grade. It's called READING.  Try it sometime.\n\nDo any of you know how god forsakenly annoying it is to have some jerk come up to you \"HEY MAN PUT ME ON NOW, YOUR SHOW SUCKS CAUSE NOBODY IS SINGING GOOD SONGS, WHAT'S A GOOD SONG FOR ME?\"  Like I got some natural ability to discern what song is PERFECT for someone, without ever having met them before, or heard them sing.  If you think that I bet you believe I can move physical objects with my mind as well.\n\nI can go on and on and on.   I could write an illiad of rants about how fucked up and inconsiderate people are to KJ's.  Stuff like beligerant jackasses sitting in your booth playing with shit when you've stepped away for a moment, then trying to pick a fight with you for telling them to get the fuck out.\n\nOh and what about deaf people?  No I don't mean the handicapped.  I mean the folks that you call out their names 100 times, and they just sit in their seat like deer in the headlights.  Look, there's probably 50+ people waiting to sing after you, get with the program and get your ass on stage.  \n\nOh yah, we're also expected to make everyone sound good.  Like we can wave a magic wand and suddenly you're singing Mariah Carrey.  If Frank is cutting your mic, you probably just aren't using the mic correctly.  Yah it's my fault you're waving your mic around like a shit chucking ape and holding it 2 feet from your mouth, or the idiots that cup the ball grill like eminem.  Learn how to use a mic before you give us that dumbfounded look because you sound like shit.\n\nI dunno, I read a lot of the 1 and 2 star reviews and concluded that it was mostly written by people with no regard for the crap Frank has to put up with in a night.  If he seems like an annoyed, pissed off person well, read what I wrote above and you'll understand why.\n\nI know some regular from the Mint is probably going to print this up for Frank, so Frank, if you're reading this let me just say I have the highest respect for you.  You're either insane to have been doing your job this long or you love it.   I think it's the latter.

I've actually hit myself in the scrotum with an empty pint glass to distract my attention from the terrible the singers.\n\nI like this bar.  I will admit you should only come here if you're in the mood for karaoke or sober enough to avoid castigating the awful (all of the) singers.  The space is decent and over all I think it's a great place to come and have a drink.  The lamps are kept low and there are beer specials 4 days of the week.  Unfortunately two of the nights are Miller Light specials, but they do have Peroni,Pilsner Urquell and Red Tail on tap.  A lot of people think it's tacky, but they have their top shelf scotches marked with the prices to avoid questions.\n\nThe worst part is, yes, you are listening to awful karaoke all night and while the singers may not have loud voices, it seems they frequently get help from various patrons in the bar.  \n\nI'm still waiting to bring my roommates here to see if I can get them tanked enough to start singing some Journey.

Singers: You'd be be hard-pressed to think of a song (new or old) that wasn't listed in the huge karaoke song book. Listeners: You'll hear every kind of singer from that seasoned pro who avoids \"typical\" karaoke songs and the bearded fellow who perfected \"Don't Stop Believin'\" to the drunk women singing \"Dancing Queen\" and the shy girl who's afraid of her own voice. It's great!\n\nThe KJs are a fun, sassy bunch, and they'll take care of you if you take care of them (i.e. slip a few bucks into their tip jar to move up the queue). Also, the bar is easily accessible and its bartenders are personable. \n\nI've been here on a few occasions, at different times of the day. Basically, if you want to be a part of a huge crowd and don't mind getting just one or two songs in, you'd be perfectly happy going on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night. Just get there early enough for you and your friends to grab seats. If you want to sing as much as you can in front of a smaller audience, you'd be better off going Sunday-Wednesday. My friend and I once had a mini-concert (7-8 songs each) on Monday afternoon!\n\nMore Tips:\n* Listen closely for your name to be called. If the place is packed, the KJs will probably only call your name once or twice and then move on quickly.\n* If you and your friends want to sing a song, all your names need to be on the request slip. Otherwise, they'll only let one of you on stage.\n* Please don't sing the theme to Ghostbusters. Sure, it seems fun at first, but you'll soon learn the song is really long, boring, and repetitive.", "author": "Eddie B."}

Filled with afterwork superstar kareoke singers and marina cougars looking for \"fun\" everywhere you turn youll find an amusing sight.\n\n I found myself between what I thought was going to turn into a strip show on the stage and two escorts on a date at the table next to me the last time I ventured in. Between the drunken asian girl singing off key and threatening to take off her banana republic and fall off the stage and the escorts eye raping my cleavage at the next table I couldnt have been happier. \nThey have the biggest selection of music I have ever seen at a Kareoke bar, all organized and binded for your selecting pleasure. It feels like reno on a tuesday night in there all year round and the staff are characters that I cant picture working anywhere else.\n\nBubble lights, and hotel carpet add to the chucky cheese meets reno vibe and god forbid you miss your lines cause the crowd will pipe right up and start singing along to show you how its done. This is a serious kareoke spot for serious performers, or at least thats what the regulars near the front would have you belive. To me its just another bar full of drunk ass folks looking to get down. Another interesting fact about the Mint, that I find highly entertaining is that due to its location (market and safeway) everytime Ive been here Ive seen,heard or been standing next to a fight or homeless encounter gone wrong.\n\nThere are apparently long waiting lists to sing which kinda takes away from the instant gratification of making a fool of yourself but it gives you time to get a few more drinks in.\n\nSeriously hilarious drunken good times.", "author": "Charlie B."}

Let me begin by saying that I reserved half of the bar and brought in about 40 people the night of the party. I would say there were about another 25-30 folks in the place who were obviously regulars, and about half showed up after our group got there. \n\nSeveral people from our group put their names down to sing and after a half hour or so, none of us got called. Realizing that maybe the KJ needed a little greasing, I walked up and dropped a $20 in his bowl and told him to start taking care of our group. He obliged momentarily by letting a few of us sing, but then went back to his usual routine of parading the group of losers that calls this place home in front of us for the next hour.\n\nAll in all, I would say that the folks in our group sang a total of about 8 songs. The thing that surprised me the most was that the owner, over several different phone conversations,  assured me that we would have a wonderful time and that with that many people we could probably take the stage over. Not true. \n\nThis place is bullshit and the only reason I am giving it one star is because the owner was a nice guy. A liar, but a nice guy. Oh, and the drinks were cheap.", "author": "Matt R."}

On one extreme end are the blackhearts: so named because they practically (or actually) hate music and are unwilling to let it pierce their inky black hearts, let alone escape from their mouths.\n\nThen you have the secret shower superstars. The only acoustic set-up worthy of their pipes are the... uh, surrounding pipes of their shower.\n\nNext, the car-aoke singers: bold enough to sing out loud, but only within the confines of their cars. Two sub-classes exist here: the lone wolf, and the ones who can sing with passengers. I personally am a fan of the car chorus; no matter what your speakers (or your voices) sound like, having a carful of people spontaneously sing along at the top of their lungs to a jam is just plain awesome. So go ahead and belt out GNR, Beyonc\u00e9, MJ, Weezer, what have you. It feels good.\n\nThen you have the occasional karaokeists, who can sally forth now and again and lift their voices up to the heavens (or at least to the drunken masses along for the ride).  I lump in this category the Rock Bandiers, the Magic Mic'ers, the in-home karaoke machinists, and the noraebangers: public performers all, at least in small doses (typically helped along by large doses of alcohol).\n\nAnd finally, you have the hardcore karaoke junkies. Obsessive. Aggressive. Sometimes actually talented. Often less so in reality than in that fantastic space occupied by their imagination. They'll actually, you know, practice. Probably in front of a mirror because they love to look at themselves. (Hey I'm not judging on that front. Mrs. Q says I have this look she affectionately calls my mirror-face when I'm checking my reflection.) \n\nAnyway, these are the denizens of the Mint. I had the good misfortune of hanging out here the other night, and I was so fascinated by these karaoke regulars that I ended spending an extra hour after the rest of my illustrious company had skedaddled off to the hinterlands of San Francisco in their quest for Farolito goodness. Finding myself alone, I then found myself in another, quite unexpected state: accepted. There they were, a row of misfits lined up sitting along the bar, each awaiting his or her turn at the brief, dim, cracked karoke spotlight of the Mint, and well, I just happened to plop down right in their midst. Rather than shun me, I was welcomed, offered a drink, and encouraged to sing. It was nice making 5-minute friends. Just add liquid (in the form of alcohol.) Apparently, it's much easier connecting with other lone wolves when your pack leaves and you choose to stay behind.\n\nSo brave karoke singers, abandon all hope, and company, and you shall be accepted at the Mint. Sing your black heart blue, for just a night at least.\n\nP.S. The ultimate sing-along experience, in case you didn't know, is the concert sing-along.

Back in those days, it was a relaxed, always-a-place-to-sit bar where chitchat was easy to come by, and the Karaoke scene was amusing but ignorable.  It was a Gay bar, but mellow enough that I didn't realize it until I'd finished my second round, then ordered a third anyway due to charming conversation I was having with a lesbian couple from Lake Tahoe. \r\n\r\nFast forward to 2006.  Every seat in the place was taken by 9:00PM, and the standing room was filling up quick.  Karaoke is no longer a side-attraction you can tune into or out of at will....A formidable sound system has transformed it into an in-your-face main event.  Singing patrons form a delightful array of talent (or lack thereof), ranging from blithering drunken fools to potential American Idol contestants. The crowd would converse during bad acts, and attempt to dance (space permitting) during good ones. Later on in the evening, the crowd got Sardine-can tight and the volume on the Karaoke system went ear-ringing loud.  \r\n\r\nIt was too crowded and noisy for a middle aged pub crawler like myself.  Still, I gotta say that a quick glance at the fairly lively crowd didn't reveal too many faces that weren't sporting an ear-to-ear grin.  I still managed to shake-my-groove-thang to several of the livelier performances, and nobody seemed to make fun of my typically spastic hetero-caucasian-male dancing. But despite several fish-out-of-water types like myself, the vast majority of the crowd seemed to be having a kick ass time...", "author": "Mike W."}

That goes for the employees too aside from Frank, the KJ that everyone complains about. Honestly I do not even know why The Mint employs that guy. He has no customer service skills. And he's a complete asshole. I stopped going there about years ago and will never go back. There are much nicer looking bars that do karaoke with lower drink prices and zero attitude.  Also at other karaoke bars its usually first come first serve in terms of when you will sing your song. It's not like that at the Mint so be prepared to wait a long time. In all the years and time I wasted going there I never exactly figured out how they determine who is going to sing next. Probably whoever is tipping the most and maybe buying the most drinks, I have no idea. As I already mentioned too the drinks are quite over priced. And I would like to say also that the song selection is really not that impressive. Some of the other karaoke places I've started going have  pretty much the same catalog of songs and the KJ will buy new songs on the spot if he does not already have them. That is what I call customer service. Plus, I really feel that even though I'm sure they keep the bar clean it just looks dirty and out of date. All in all, nothing really makes The Mint stand out from other bars that do karaoke in my opinion aside from inflated drink prices and a rude KJ who is there almost every night.", "author": "L. A."}

Saturday nights are super crowded and the KJ is a total diva, giving preference to regulars who will sing 10 songs before you get your chance. Therefore, I'd almost given up on the Mint - until recently, when an early dismissal from work meant some coworkers and I could chill out and sing Karaoke at 4:30 p.m. on a Thursday. The bartender pulled double duty, also acting as KJ for a couple of hours, and he was totally relaxed and funny. There was only a handful of other patrons in the bar so we all had plenty of chances to sing. When the KJ showed up around 6 or so, she, too was totally awesome (bonus points for putting a spotlight on me and letting me rock out with an inflatable guitar).\n\nBottom line - skip the weekends if you really want to have a good time.

And if they weren't good, they were funny. Some guy sang some song about power bottoms, or some such, which was lewd, loud, and comical, followed by a rendition of Wrecking Ball that was just as funny and suggestive. The DJ kept the mic up loud for this guy whose energy was great, but had a voice like a lawnmower with a rock stuck in it. Then good singers would get up, and the DJ would inexplicably lower the volume, or adjust it mid-song. There was no reason or pattern to the DJ's choices. A fella with an owner's manual and a set of ears could have managed the microphones and sound system better. This particular DJ was a squirrely obese character who looked like he was probably paid with beer and wings.

Of particular enjoyment was my 28th birthday, when I met a very cute actor slash student from San Diego.  Ahhh, the good ol' days.\n\n(2) Frank - The opinions re Frank seem to be wide and varied on Yelp.  As someone who has been to TM 30+ times, I am proud to claim the distinction of having Frank recognize and hug me when I come in (\"Hi Honey!\").  He's a sweet slash catty guy with a tough job, and if you were faced with a bunch of drunk, rude and/or obnoxious Marina folk every Friday and Saturday night, see how happy you'd be at the end of the night.  All I have to say is more power to you Frank, and keep those flames a comin!\n\n(3) First Date with My Future Husband - I went on my first date with the man I would eventually marry in December 2002, and our venue of choice was TM.  He lived in San Jose, I lived in Oakland, yet we had both been to TM in the past and decided that it would be the most appropriate venue for our first date.  We had several drinks, danced at the bar with a cute lesbian couple on our left and another interracial couple on our right, sang our hearts out (he - Secret Agent Man; me - Crazy), and had the best time ever.  When I saw him up there on stage, sans flames unfortunately, I knew he was a keeper.  \n\nWe got married 3 1/2 years later, and went back to TM the day after our wedding to sing and be merry!\n\n(4) Fabulous Gay Boys - I have met, brought, and sang with many a fabulous gay boy at TM.  \n\n(5) Bonnie Tyler Songs - I love singing Total Eclipse of the Heart, and TM patrons have always been very kind in return.\n\n(5) Bomber Girl - My husband then boyfriend, brother, brother's girlfriend at the time and I went to TM on Easter Sunday one year, and had a great time.  The KJ was David the Bartender and we had the best time watching him sing songs in Japanese (not a language he knew), and scream the chorus \"BOMBER GIRL!\".\n\nI guess you just had to be there.\n\n(6) The SONG COLLECTION - Hands down, TM has the best song collection ever.  You can even download it, which helped my friend Mike when he was planning his trip to SF during Pride 2002.  We had an evening at TM on our itinerary, and he was able to sing 3 of his favorite songs.  His big faux pas, however, was trying to slip past Frank by submitting a  fourth song under a different name, for which he was severely reprimanded.  But nonetheless, those were good times, good times.\n\nWhen I'm 50 and my kids are off in college, I hope that I can come back to TM, flash Frank a smile, and sing another great song or two...or seven.", "author": "Valerie V."}

As many have already stated, this karaoke bar is not for the faint of heart.  There are quite a few regulars who are very good singers (hi Daniel!), and the crowd in general can be quite Simon Cowell-ly at times.  Though they *do* tolerate tone-deafness to a degree, if you can't carry a tune, don't be going on stage too often; you may find yourself ducking slices of caterpillar roll from the sushi place next door.  Speaking of which, it's too cool that there's a door connecting the karaoke bar to the Japanese restaurant on the other side of the wall!  And, they will deliver your sushi order to your Mint table so you don't lose your front row seat!  How awesome is that?\n\nBut I digress. This review is about the Mint.  Their music catalog is quite extensive (none of that Magic Mike crap with their latest song being from 2000), and when the lyrics are on the screens, there isn't any cheesy background music video to distract you from the singer (though that wouldn't be a bad thing for some performers).  The KJs (karaoke jockeys) will sometimes give you personal stage effects, like pseudo flames on small lanterns on the side, or a hand-held spotlight for a tune's climax.  The staff are all quite friendly, and the drinks are pretty good and reasonably priced.  \n\nMy only minor criticism would be that the place does get very crowded on the weekend evenings, so if you want to actually get up on stage and sing, either go on a weekend afternoon, or early evening/late afternoon on a weekday.  The singing queue can get long right away, so be prepared to wait a while for your name to be called if it's busy.  Also, the tables fill up fast, so get there early (especially if you have a big group). Otherwise, you'll have to try to find a spot at the bar.  \n\nYou can even call ahead and reserve some tables for a large group, if you can't get there early enough to secure seats.  Also, their website has a list of songs in their catalog (though it doesn't seem to have been updated recently).  You can totally browse the song list, jot down some tunes you're dying to sing on a post-it note, and bring it to the bar so you don't waste time going thru the catalog once your'e there.  Okay, I know that's a hard-core karaoke move, but come on, people! You don't want to wait 45 minutes to sing \"Tearin' Up My Heart\" do ya??\n\nI've been going to the Mint for many years now.

I'm a huge karaoke fan, and this place is the bees knees!  It's also overrun with locals, which is great, but they take their singing skills pretty seriously (which can be a little less than terrifying) but everyone is totally chill.  It does get a tad crowded and once you put your name in to sing, you might be waiting a bit.  They serve some mean drinks which helps with all that.  There is also sushi next door, but I have never tried.

I went there for my 23rd birthday party. I went there for my ex-girlfriend's 22nd birthday party. And I realize it's the most famous karaoke bar in the city, but I'm here to tell you that it is vastly overrated.\n\nFirst off, if you go there on a weekend, you're basically not going to sing unless you get there and sign up prior to 9:30 AM. Secondly, the KJ's all have some sort of Goddess Complex because they are always ready to give you an earful of attitude coupled with a stink eye. The drinks are expensive, and it can get way too crowded later in the night. \n\nFor my money, Encore on California is a way better venue: it's about four times bigger, the drinks are cheaper, and the freak factor is equally high, if not higher. There are too many posers here, and this is coming from a guy that sang Fiona Apple's \"Criminal\" here after jumping out from behind the curtains for a more dramatic entrance.", "author": "Eric M."}

I went because of a pub/karaoke night hosted by a grad association (yes, I'm with the kiddies from State) and while people seemed to be enjoying themselves (props to them)... this place is seriously depressing.  \n\nOne, the bouncer's rude.  A friend and I arrived here well after the association made themselves comfy and when we were at the door showing our IDs, I asked the guy if a group of people from State were still here (we were close to three hours late).  He said no, they had left a few minutes ago.  Too bad, we lamented, so we went over to Safeway nearby to buy some munchies.  When we left the Safeway, though, we bumped into one of our classmates-- turned out people were still there and the bouncer had just been bullshitting us.  Nice.\n\nWell, we go in and the layout of the place is just weird.  Phallic shaped bar is smack in the middle of the joint-- on one side is just enough room for seating at the bar and standing pressed against the wall; on the other side, a very small karaoke stage and table seating.  The guy manning the karaoke took his job seriously (I like that) but the sound system?  The visuals?  Cringe-worthy.  \n\nIf you're drunk, hey, who cares, right?  And if this is your idea of a fine night of karaoke, then great-- I admire your ability to make the best out of a shabby situation.  It's not very uplifting, frankly, though a few people are amazing when they perform-- most aren't, but perfection isn't the point of karaoke.  Having fun is.  Did I?  Here?  No.  But hey, it was an experience.  No cover, so even better (there is a drink minimum and someone does come by to take orders every now and then, but with all the stray half-empty beers and pilsners, who the hell keeps track of whether or not you bought a drink?).", "author": "Lynn O."}

I arrived at 5 PM on a Saturday, which is typically a little early for \"going out\" time.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it as crowded as it was.  Aside from our party, many other parties had tables reserved, leading me to believe, there isn't much space later in the evening.  There was no cover at the time I arrived and the drinks were reasonably priced.  However it was often difficult to get the bartenders attention to order and it is cash only.  Most patrons were dressed casually which was ok considering the place is not fancy.\n\nHowever the meat and potatos is in the Karaoke.  For starters they have numerous cataloges of music sorted by both artist and song, including some rather obscure titles.  I requested my song with ease and tipped the karaoke dj a buck (I have no idea if there is a tipping standard for karaoke).  About and hour passed before I was called up.  There is a stage (not elevated) and cordless mic, and a large elevated screen for you to see the lyrics.  There are many other screens through out for people to follow along. Most of the people who took their turn on stage could almost if not completely carry a tune.  \n\nIn conclusion, I like to sing.  I had a great time.  When its busy I would expect it to be crowded and for it to take a long time to get to sing your song. Bring cash.", "author": "Rebecca R."}

People at the Mint are generally decent singers, which makes it much easier on the ears compared to most other karaoke venues.  In fact, I hope this review doesn't send college-age kids over in droves to pile on stage for a scream fest.  Instead, the atmosphere is usually fairly lounge-like and supportive --- like AA for singers.\n\nThe only problem is one of their KJs, named Frank.  Frank's a total jerk and can ruin one's entire karaoke experience with his self imposed Nazi-like karaoke regulations.  Frank restricts the color ink for submissions, the number of submissions, and refuses to allow multiple singers onto the stage if not initially specified in one's entry.  Frank threatened to permanently ban one of my female friends for her attempt to address his iron fist.  FYI, if he tries this with you, don't worry, we spoke to the owner, who is such a sweetheart, and Frank does not possess the authority to ban patrons from the Mint.\n\nSo here's the kicker about Frank...amidst his ridiculous bad attitude, he will get on stage and not only sings with a headset microphone, he even dances kinda Broadway show tune style.  Just witnessing his straight-faced performance made it worth enduring his funky attitude.\n\nFrank notwithstanding, the rest of the staff at the Mint is amazing.  I think Sundays and Mondays are my favorite nights there.  The KJs on those nights are wonderful, as is the rest of the staff.  I personally enjoy this venue again because people aren't usually screaming, but also because they have a great selection, including lots of R&B tunes.", "author": "Kat K."}

For best results, get there early - like around 10 pm.  Then you can get your name down early for karaoke (wait times can be up to three hours when it gets crowded - but wait times are known to be influenced by how much you tip the emcee, do NOT not tip or you may never get your turn).

Maybe this altered perception was partially due to the amount of alcohol I had had to drink the night before, or actually, the day before that turned into the night before.  My friend Becca and I, who are both vocalists and performers, decided to go to the Mint after splitting a pitcher of margaritas in the Mission.  I had never been to the Mint before, and was not really sure I would enjoy karaoke, but hey, why not give it a try.  \nTo walk into a dark bar on a sunny Sunday afternoon is always a bit odd to me.  It's like you're forcing the world to go all midnight no matter what time it is.  The bar was filled with regulars and there was a man in a western-style button-up shirt on the stage singing \"Rescue Me\" by Aretha Franklin.  I didn't actually see the man on the stage, I saw his projected image on a tv screen by the bar.  He finished his song to a tiny smattering of halfhearted applause and resumed his position at the bar.  The karaoke dj did an overenthusiastic thank you and then called the next person to the stage.  It went on like this for a while, and then it was my turn.  I was singing Amy Winehouse's 'Rehab.\"\nThe incredible thing about being onstage in a karaoke bar is you have to be bad.  There's a screen in front of you with lyrics, and even if you know the lyrics, the screen is like a big hypnotizing eye that makes you look at it.  It keeps you from having any interaction or energy exchange with the audience at all, which is at once mortifying and liberating.  It is a completely self-indulgent performance in which the singer is performing only for themselves.  If they are incredible, nobady cares.  If they are awful, nobody cares.  Personally, I got bored half way through my song, but I did enjoy watching my Becca tear it up on some country ballad until it got to a part of the song she didn't know.  She giggled at the Karaoke dj.  \"I don't know this part of the song,\" and walked off stage.  No one cared.  The next singer was called up to the stage.  Amazing.  I wonder how this would go over in a serious art art context, an installation at the SFMoMA maybe.\nSome woman came up to Becca and I and told us we did a great job.  I was surprised.  I didn't feel like I had done anything, but I guess it doesn't take much at a karaoke bar.\nNeedless to say, I had a really good time and thought the place was totally bizarre.

No it isn't at all in a sexy or fun leather daddy way -it's in a shrill histrionic jealous way!\nA few of my customers had been trying to get me in for almost a year now, because they come to the place where I work regularly. I am not much of a bar person, and am a little shy to go to places for the first time, so although I have worked in the neighborhood for over a year, I had never made it in until tonight.\n\nWhat started out as a reasonably good time turned into the singular most horrible time I have ever had at any bar anywhere!\n\nWhen I arrived at five o'clock I was informed by Tiffany that there were no Happy Hour Specials, and ordered a shot of scotch.  My second shot awkwardly spilled when I bumped it with the Karaoke book right after receiving it. I was comped another drink, for which I left a tip, and as far as I knew everything was good with the bartender before she left, however, she had evidently misinformed the DJ who walked in when she left that she had given me a FREE drink.\nThe DJ who walked in, and the male bartender with the thick black frames, gave me particularly unfriendly and rude service. I have worked in the industry as both a bartender and a karaoke DJ in the past. This service was unthinkably rude and I know that there are a lot of really well deserving people in the world who have actual PEOPLE SKILLS!\n\nMy problems started halfway through my second drink when I sang \"Tenderly.\" I was particularly disappointed by the cheap Karaoke version that was missing half to a third of the lines and when I said something to the DJ about feeling It was a wasted dollar (because there was more than one version of \"tenderly\" in the book) I guess I was looking for some kind of, I don't know, service or sympathy, not the particularly mean spirited reaction complete with faces and a statement of ? (Are you REALLY saying this to me on the first song you play for me?) \"Well if you don't like it go someplace else.\" Usually when I am serving someone for the first time I try to be kind at least, even when I am busy, which the mint DJ was NOT. The inflection of tone was hateful.\nReally, this Dj made me feel horrible on a night when I had been the only one consistently dropping tips into the jar before his arrival. It really felt as though I was being discriminated against because I am not a gay man, or part of the \"lifestyle.\" He was that special brand of nasty caddy and disrespectful that is reserved for the worst jealous 15 year old girls and fading queens with mean mommies, you know? Emotionally harsh for NO reason at all.  Not so long after he put his recently arrived friend ahead of me when I had been waiting to sing, and AGAIN was very rude In a very unnecessary way I began to feel especially prickly and made a comment that he was just jealous of my vagina (maybe not my finest hour -but I was feeling especially personally abused and well pissed off at this point) and it was revealed to me that before ending her shift Tiffany had complained to him about the free shot that she repoured for me after I said I really couldn't afford another one (actually I gave her six bucks for the re-pour) And he insisted that I had been drinking for \"free\"and after asking me if I wanted to go outside and fight (I'm not kidding!) told me to leave, and his bartender friend, who had only just walked into the room for his new shift (and I recognize as a real jerk who comes to my work acting particularly high maintenance with a table of his friends on a busy night, makes me make milkshakes and doesn't tip) ushers me to the door and 86's me. All the while I am saying \"I am not drunk, your DJ has just been SO consistently rude to me!\" \nIf I am the only one tipping all night, it seems kind-of rude to put your friend who just walked in before my spot to sing when I have been waiting and was supposed to be next! \n\nSadistic DJ? *sigh* I'm sorry you don't have a vagina, but don't be a hater! I'm sure that if you treat people the way that you treated me you will never be able to afford the surgery.\n\nAddendum:\nSince writing this review, one of The Mint's regular customers revealed to me that this same Tuesday night KJ had made his friend cry on her birthday! If you make someone cry on their birthday, perhaps you are NOT a people person? My friend's advice was simply not to go on Tueday.

As far as I know there's about one good KJ.  I don't know his name, but he usually works the early shift.  If there's a KJ with \"Pecker\" emblazoned on the back of his t-shirt don't bother to stay.  Just go to Do Re Mi.  He'll ask you to tip him, claim he didn't ask for tips but make an announcement that tips move you up in line.  I tipped him $5 for a song  I waited more than 2 hours to hear.  I also tipped the bartenders $3 for every $5 drink I had.  I'm sensitive to the fact that some nights are busier than others but don't make announcements asking for tips to play songs before claiming you don't want tips.  Conundrum?

The place was empty, but our crowd definitely started a party of our own. What's better than having the whole bar to yourself, and all the karaoke requests you can imagine? Well... not quite. Yes, we did have the bar to ourselves, but the KJ was kind of a jerk. I'm not sure if he was just annoyed because he was hoping for a relaxing afternoon of not doing anything while at work, or what, but he informed us that we only got 1 song per person... huh? He then kept shaking the tip jar in front of our faces. Apparently we weren't tipping him enough. Whatever dude, all you're doing is pressing play. At least the 20 of us are bringing business to the bar on a not usually busy hour. One of our friends was singing on stage and a couple of us threw something on stage as a joke (won't say what it was to prevent my fellow yelpers from thinking I'm extremely immature...). It was harmless fun, and no, we weren't throwing beverages. The KJ got kind of mad at us. He obviously woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Last, but not least, I went up on stage to rap my usual... \"6 Foot 7 Foot\" by Lil Wayne, and the version was completely different than the actual song. I got so confused that I had to tell him to stop the music because I didn't know this weird version he was playing. I had an awesome time, but only because my friends were with me. The place didn't do much for me.", "author": "Ashley D."}

Yeah, I'm really excited that you get up every once in a while to sing songs about San Francisco and do toe touches, but that doesn't mean you can be an asshole to everyone else who wants to sing.

One visit and upon the next she remembered me and what I drank.  And now one of my good friends!  \nTiffany - Sweetest bartender, bar back, door person and fill in KJ to grace a bar since....well....who the hell are we kidding?  There is no one sweeter.\nBen - One tall drink of cuddly goodness!  \nFrank - Magic 8 ball says \"Ask again later\"\nDeeDee - Great singer hostess with the mostess and mostly fair.\nJamin AKA Sudsy - Not sure where the nickname came from but I love this guy, what a smart ass!  He's number one in my book.\nGeorge - Good hearted, stand up guy and he always has a lighter.  \nBrian - Always something witty and fun to say.  From what I've heard, there isn't a better make-up artist in the city!\nJim - How do you not just love this man?!?!\nTed - My Teddy Bear, always a smile on his face.\nFrank - Magic 8 ball say \"ask again later\"\nDavid AKA Daddy - Not a better singer or dancer amongst the staff!\nDavid AKA Emma - The voice of an Angel and I really mean that.  No seriously, have you heard him?\nFrank - Okay so he's a hard ass when it comes to the rotation, and maybe a little moody sometimes, and even a diva sometimes, but we've always been cool and I actually really like this guy.  You just have to get to know him on a personal level and if that doesn't work drop him a ten or a twenty!\n\nNow there are a few rules that I follow when visiting the Mint.\n1) Only go Sunday through Thursday\n2) NEVER go on Friday or Saturday, unless you really have to!\n3) NEVER ask Frank when I'm up, you will receive his wrath!\n4) NEVER put in a request for a song longer than 5 minutes.  You won't get up.\n5) NEVER call the KJ an asshole, he is feisty and will bitch slap you!  Not to mention, if you ever go back he will remember and you will not sing, yet again.\n6) Don't criticize the regulars for getting up to sing before you.  Keep in mind they are regulars and get that privilege because while you were being responsible and staying at home during the week, they were at the Mint keeping the lights on.  It's life, deal with it.\n7) Don't take it so seriously, it's just karaoke after all.  Go with a group of friends and just chill.\n8) Don't critcize the good singers, they are allowed to karaoke too.  Not everyone needs to suck.\n\nTo be fair, I will mention the things that are as I like to call them challenges.\n1) The layout is a bit weird and when it's packed it's barely tolerable, but I've been to worse.\n2) They are on bar time, so at 1:30 start packing your bags and begin to head to the door!\n3) 1:45 Get the hell out!!\n4) Maybe sometimes a certain KJ may sing more than the patrons.\n5) The slow sappy love songs should be saved for earlier in the day or evening.  (I've done it too)\n6) Sometime large amounts of people who stand in front of the stage and talk loudly to their friends or on cell phones.\n7) A lot of birthday and bachlorette parties, which means at any given time you're going to hear some horrible rendition of \"Summer Nights\" or \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" screamed into the microphone.  Which, as a karaoke aficionado, are never acceptable songs and should be banned from ALL karaoke bars.\n\nIn conclusion, I'll say it again, I love this place.  Yep, I said it, I love it!

I been there countless times when this particular karaoke dj was decent but more than often he plays favorites and throws attitude.\nSince the fellow tonight played favorites I am going to have to say the guy who is there on opposite nights of the guy tonight (take a look at the date and you will know who I am referring to) is way nicer and has less of a holier than though attitude.\nGuys, I get you are busy, I get that this Yelp will probably get lost in the shuffle but I hope someone there reads it and takes it into consideration.", "author": "Karen C."}

I found myself waiting a long time to sing while people from the corporation were bumped ahead of me in the karaoke queue, and it was awkward singing in front of the corporation while the birthday group was watching on a TV to the side.\n\nI felt somewhat like a second class citizen during that evening as the  Mint appeared to sell out to a business with money.  It's really a shame, and I might think twice before coming there again over Encore.", "author": "Sean C."}

Who happens to be the WORST EVER karaoke DJ (KJ) I have ever had the displeasure of coming across. I've been a karaoke fan for a while - and have spent my time getting into the thick of the underground karaoke scene in many a city. And the good KJs always know two things.  1) Your gratuitous tips will not make your song request any closer to the top, and 2) You just came up to do \"Love Shack\" with a huge group of chicks, but I still know your name and will obviously put your next solo rendition of \"Rebel Yell\" behind the singers who have not yet had a chance to come up.  Frank?  I have a problem with your blatant pandering to the patrons who part most easily with their money, and to your unabashed disregard for the most basic rules of karaoke etiquette.  If some assholes from New Jersey who are in town for one night for a Realtor Conference can buy your loyalty, then I want none of it, my fine friend.  I declare you, Frank, my new ARCH-NEMESIS.  I will not rest until you have been smoted.  I'm serious, even if the Jameson is not.  \n\nIn other news, Ted is an excellent bartender (and gave me a few free drinks for my trouble) and for the most part it's a great place to go when Frank is not smacking you in the face with his bloated sense of entitlement.", "author": "Briana L."}

I noticed that earlier in the night that most of the performers were drunkards getting down onstage, which is expected.  But as the night grew later, the talent got better and better.  You could tell the serious karaoke heads stayed til the very end and it's clear that these singers were no rookies.  I've never been so blown away with so many talented vocalists in one night.  They all seemed to know each other too.  I wasn't even interested in singing that night.  Instead, I was enjoying the show.  At one point, there was one man who had a a voice almost identical to the lead singer of Journey.  TOO GOOD!  Then he was followed by this smooth vocalist who jammed to Michael Jackson.

With that being said, The Mint is a high quality fun place to bring a group and sing your heart out, or simply go by yourself sometimes (as I do) and watch hilarity ensue. Drinks are pretty well priced (draft PRB under $3, some top shelf liquors for $5-6), although I don't think there is a crazy variety in the choices of your liquidation. Food-wise, there is a sushi place right next door, and so get some mid-level quality sushi delivered to your table while waiting for your song is cinch! There are many tables throughout the venue, so seating is usually good unless it is Thurs., Fri., or Sat. late - which brings me to some of the cons. First, this is in my estimation the most well known karaoke in the Mission-Downtown-Market area, and so it is often SUPER crowded, and could easily take an hour for your song to come up. This is especially true on Fridays and Saturdays, and if you are expecting to get a quick tune in before/after you go to other bars during the weekend - forget about it. Other than that, I absolutely love Mint - great staff, reasonable drinks, alot of fun-loving SF'ers congregating here, and I have yet to NOT have a fun-to-awesome night here. If you are an out of towner looking for something to do in SF even on a weeknight, this is the place. Enjoy!", "author": "Andrew M."}

Yes, they have strict rules, but with so many people wanting to sing, the queue would be unmanageable without these rules. The rules prevent people from hogging the stage. Don't take them personally. And I agree that it is not the best place to introduce people to karaoke. The singers tend to be better at the Mint. I love this fact because since I do have to wait a long time for my turn, then I get to hear great songs sung well while I wait. But don't worry, people who are not the best singers also get lotsa love from the audience. With monitors everywhere, chances are that people will be singing with you anyway, so don't fret...you are not alone. The stage has great props such as fake flame lamps and an inflatable guitar. The KJ has fun with people who give it their all and add special lights and other touches. This is definitely the place to unleash your inner pop star or torch singer. I've even seen a Spice Girls song performed here with full choreography from a group of 7 people. All this, with no cover charge. Amazing.", "author": "Leah F."}

Definitely a two star destination... they scowl if you come with an entourage, try to start a tab, or bring a drink on stage ... but they've got one thing that will keep me coming back: the Dixie Chicks.  They are my go-to group for karaoke!  No one ever expects it and on that little stage, I can twang my heart out!  I mean, I belt it (after consuming many drinks) and the enthusiasm from the crowd makes me all the louder.  A couple of heel clicks here, a little air guitar there, and I am one happy Urban Cowgirl : )  And there is really nothing better than seeing all your friends up there... talk about a bonding experience!  I'd be nice if the staff recognized there are memories being made on that stage and cracked a smile every once in a while, but hey, I guess listening to drunken serenades and off-tune buffoons every night would make anybody a little pissy.", "author": "Tara G."}

I enjoy going out and signing karaoke with friends after a long weekend but my experience on Friday Dec. 4 '09 was abysmal. We got there around 8:30 and it was already crowded. There is a 2-drink minimum which was fine except the drinks were somewhat expensive (5.00 for well drinks) and were extremely watered down. For a karaoke bar, the song list was limited - especially for show-tunes (the bar *is* in the Castro). The guy running Karaoke was rude and really killed the vibe. I turned in a song request towards the beginning of the night and went to hand in my friend's request about 30 minutes later when I went to get another round of drinks. I was yelled at for submitting more than one song at a time. I explained that it was my friends and I was just handing it in for him as it was crowded and I had to go to the bar. He gave me the slip of paper back and made my friend go submit it himself. He told me that \"He was doing his job\" and the comment really got under my skin. We eventually all got to sing our songs and left feeling unsatisfied and disappointed.", "author": "Jason B."}

When going to a karaoke joint, You can't expect much from Karaoke bars. The decor was a little cheesy but that's what's fun about these places. My friends and I went on a sat night at around 830pm and the place was semi busy. There were lots of tables reserved for birthday parties and going away parties so it was a little tough finding seats. One of the parties let us sit at their table because not all of their friends had shown up. They were very friendly. Miller light was $2 all night!  SWEET! To sing, you find your song, write it down and then hand it to the DJ in the front. The songs are free but you are only allowed to hand in one song at a time. So what we did was hand a song to the DJ when it was our turn to sing. It can take a while for your song to appear as well. Make sure you listen to see if you are next and be waiting at the stage before the DJ throws your song in the trash. The people that are at this bar are very friendly. Everytime I went to the restroom, I met some one new. Even the people next to our table randomly joined in on our fun. Our party was soooo trashed at the end of the night that we were all hootin and hollaring and dancing all over the place. No one cared and started to actually join our delirious drunkeness.  The place got really packed at the end of the night and I felt like a sardine. So get here early. Everyone also cheers you on when you are on stage. It's the biggest rush! This place is loads of fun!", "author": "Cynthia S."}

The bartenders are great, and the crowd is an eclectic mix of Castro kids, curious go-seers and wannabe rock stars who make for an all around good time. I could go on about the glories of this place, but there's one big negative that always makes me hesitate to return. The karaoke MC guy is a Bitter Betty, to say the least. After tipping him $20 to get our song played (any novice vocalists-cum-exhibitionist knows this is exorbitant for a karaoke bar), we preformed a glorious rendition of Journey's Lights which needless to say got the whole bar singing along. Woo, yeah! Good times, right?? Not according to Mr. MC guy. He was dour as ever. Dude, we just gave you $20 for 3 mins of pure, unbridled, child-like, drunken joy. Ok, whatever. But let me just explain how it typically works with this fellow-- you request a song and if your lucky get a chance to sing it before the bar closes. You can tip him a buck or two and maybe sing before the bare closes. You tip him the equivalent of a round of beers for your chums and perhaps within an hour MC guys calls your name: \"Next up Jason going oncetwicethreetimes ok next is....\" If you're late running up to the stage (or should I say, shouldering your way through the wobbley-woozie throng), be prepared for an angry tongue lashing from MC guy as well as being bumped back a few songs. Seriously? I gave you $20! Ok, fine we're all playing along...  but holy crap, keep your distance from this guy. Looking back on the pictures from that night, I can't help but laugh whenever I see his scowling face in the background. In essence, good times, sour puss MC guy.", "author": "Belinda S."}

I was extremely excited because they have karaoke daily from 3 p.m. to 1:30am so I pictured it as some sort of karaoke Candyland.  The place was packed and the crowd was a fun, quirky, upbeat gay and lesbian crowd.  There is a small, raised stage with what looked like rows of Christmas lights lighting the back of the stage and a funky Art Deco sort of fountain in the background.  The sound system was pretty good and there seemed to be a good song selection.  The most unbearable part of this place is that we had to wait 3  1/2 hours to sing one song.  They do not allow anyone to put in more than one song and the KJ informed us that the typical wait time is 2  1/2 hours to sing one song.  I personally want to be able to sing a least two songs in a matter of 2-3 hours, which is more than realistic in most bars that hold karaoke nights.  The KJ's were boring and bitchy, which is very surprising as this is a place that's dedicated to karaoke.  They announce every so often in a nagging tone that no one is allowed to put in more than one song.  I would not go back to this location, primarily because of the wait time and the lame KJs.", "author": "Destiny T."}
