You choose your drink from a few choices, pay with your card, receive a code, watch your drink get made and placed on the side until you enter the code. Oh and their choices of milk were organic milk or a nondiary alternative oatmilk for $1 more i believe.\n\nThe process was pretty quick too there is about four ordering stands so you dont have to wait behind one line if people are taking their time ordering.

I was super excited to check it out, as it's the first robot-driven-coffee-maker in SF (and the U.S.?).\n\nPros:\n-Cheap prices. Most are $2-3 per coffee compared to $4-5 at your average coffee shop here.\n-You get to watch the robot make your drink for you.\n-You get a text on your phone for the 4-digit code to get your drink. And you get to watch your drink being put into the slot that you put your code into.\n-There's a small 6-person table and Metreon has wi-fi so you can actually come here to do some work.\n-I tried the Americano and it actually wasn't bad (though I'm not much of a coffee drinker).\n-Download their app and get $10 free credit.\n-They make the coffee pretty fast. You only have to wait ~2min.\n\nCons:\n-You can't buy coffee if you don't have a credit card or phone. This isn't too friendly to people who don't carry phones or cash. And even if you do have a phone, they text you your code, so it might be an additional cost for those who don't have free text messaging.\n-They don't have cup holders so when you grab your drink through the slot, it's super hot. (I'm use to having the baristas put the cup holder on for you, so it's not so hot when you grab your drink).\n-Only 7 types of drinks and 3 types of beans to choose from (Verve, AKA, Peet's).\n-Only size is a small cup. \n-Their app needs improvement. When I entered my number, it texted me a code to enter in the app. When I opened the text to get the code and went back to the app, the app refreshed and I wasn't able to enter my code. Had to do this multiple times until I was able to sign up. :(\n-Although there's a small table, it's a bit uncomfortable/odd to do work here. I did get some work done, but I honestly like being in Philz's cozy environment. Oh well, at least I gave it a shot.\n\n\nThe technology and innovation about Cafe X is impressive, but it's like a claw machine at a carnival. You see it and all the cool stuff about it excites you, so you drop a bill to watch that claw grab your prize and drop it off to you. And you feel pretty satisfied, but then excitement fades and you don't feel anything about it. No emotional attachment. Nothing. So you continue on with your life and the next time you want coffee, you head to your usual spot before you knew of Cafe X.", "author": "Vicki L."}

The process is simple: you put in your order and pay at the iPad kiosk, then once your drink is ready, you'll get a text along with a code to use to pick up your drink. Just getting an espresso or simple coffee drinks here are a bit cheaper than at some artisan places (probably because they save on the cost of hiring a barista), and service is quite fast. IMO, the robotic arm is also kind cute when it sets down the cup :) \n\nHowever, there aren't that many options for coffee drinks and the variety of customizations are a bit limited (e.g. there are no non-diary options yet). They also have staff on hand in case anything does goes wrong - in fact the robot did get stuck trying to dump out a drink it didn't have (the cup it was supposed to pick up got stuck) - so a technician had to step in and get it working again.\n\nVery cool to see it for the first time, but probably won't go out of my way to get coffee from here.

A robot whippin' up drinks for you? And you don't even have to interact with humans? Say whuh?? I was in...and also because Cafe X was offering up a $5 promo to try them out (check their website).\n\nLocated to the left of Sharetea Metreon location I ordered my milk tea from STea and made my way over. You order via an ipad looking podium. They have about 6 or 7 drinks to choose from. All in 8 oz sizes-- most expensive drank $2.95. Flat white? Americano?? Cortado? (they have descriptions) Me not knowing what to order, I just went with the cappuccino because don't it sound fancy? You choose what coffee bean you want and you can add a flavor. Espresso forte and a standard pump of hazelnut for me (you can get 'low', 'standard' or an 'insane' dose of flavaflav). \n\nAfter you've completed your drink order. You punch in your #, email and promo code and tap place order. Then the robot goes to work. Once your drink is done, the robot puts it off to the side. You receive a # code via text that your order is ready. Punch in the code into one of the screens outside of the robot's working station then the robot arm places it on a lil' platform and it lowers down for you to grab. Boom done! No need to talk to a barista or deal with any humans! However, there is a human on standby...just in case somebody screws something up...like I did. I had went through the ordering system and I was tryna figure out why my drink wasn't being made. The human asked me if I had forgotten to press 'place order'. Which I did...redid my order and waited for the robot to do it's thing. Grabbed my order and poured it into my canteen bottle and took it home. Blended 2 ice cream sandwiches into it...it was good!\n\nOverall, cool concept, and I guess the drinks are reasonably priced. Can they make a boba X? That'd be awesome.

He offered a refund for my lack-of-coffee the first time and then some credit to give Cafe X another try. I therefore trekked out to the Metreon again to give this robo-cafe a whirl. This time, it was very much worthwhile. I got the matcha latte for myself and a regular latte for my boyfriend. My matcha latte was ::underscore:: delicious, no skimping at all on matcha like some of the other cafes I've gotten this drink from. We also chatted briefly with a nice young fella who was there to make sure the machine was working properly, etc. Overall I'm impressed by the quality of the drinks, and I'm excited to see if Cafe X will have some new seasonal offerings.

I think I somewhat knew what I was walking into being a coffee lover; that the coffee might not be as great but it is a cool experience. However, the reviews on Yelp says otherwise. People were raving about the coffee quality that Cafe X produce, so naturally, I had to try it. \n\nUnlike other coffee shops in the city, Cafe X is 100% run by the robot, the robot brew and delivers the coffee to you. Different right? Get this, once the coffee is finished brewing, it does not place the coffee in the vending slot but instead sets it aside until the buyer comes and put in their code to whichever vending station (there are two) and then the robot will deliver the coffee to you and even wave goodbye. The robot concept is pretty cool as it is a very quick way to grab coffee and it also helps the mixup that can sometimes happen when coffee shops become really busy. In addition, you have a selection of vendors to choose from (Verve, AKA and other). I enjoyed the variety that was programmed into Cafe X (not just different style of coffee but different vendor). \n\nUnfortunately, I was not impressed with their coffee quality as others have raved about. I enjoyed the quality of coffee and the different styles it comes in. This quality produced by Cafe X was not of the quality that I had at coffee shops around the city. It produced what I would expect out of an Espresso machine at home or a Keurig. In my personal opinion, the rave on Yelp reviews seem to overhyped it and its definitely a cool experience to check out and I highly recommend it but I wouldn't expect much from the coffee quality. I would give this a 3 out of 5 because the robot brewing your coffee is pretty cool but the coffee is probably a 2 out of 5.", "author": "Chenny O."}

By the end I had a latte that was just as good as any I've had in the city.\n\nI'd be curious what's going on in the machine that actually dispenses the coffee and milk. Is the same sort of attention to detail (ground size, water temp and pressure, and milk steaming) going into it as when its made by hand? It'd be cool if some of those mechanics were see through to make the process even more transparent (sorry for the pun).

Match made in Silicon Valley heaven.\n\nI came opening day and about 4 times after that and I'm continually convinced this is the future. Of the 5 times I've been here (and 8+ coffees me and my friends have ordered), there was only 1 hitch that was corrected quickly (more on that later).\n\nTaste: You get 3 options of beans, from Peets to one of their premium brands like Verve. I've only tried Verve and AKA, both of which are good, but perhaps not as good as if it were made from a commercial grade La Marzocco espresso machine. I'd say their machine is probably one solid step up from the hum drum fully automatic machines you may see in office buildings, but not as special as one at a premium coffee shop. Taste wise, it's a good compromise between a name brand cafe and Peets/Starbucks, though I still think the milk frothing can be a little bit creamier for cappuccinos and flat whites.\n\nPrice: It's about $1 cheaper than going to a nearby premium cafe like Sightglass, which is a good compromise, all things considered.\n\nConvenience: You can order a few minutes ahead! If you miss out on this opportunity, it only takes about a minute to place your order in person and watch the machine do its magic. Super convenient.\n\nWhat you lose from coming here is latte art, cafe ambience, and some customization or preference that you can tell a human. \n\nThat said, there are always Cafe X staff on hand to talk about the machine and fix any problems. As far as the hitch I mentioned earlier, I tried ordering 2 cups ahead of time, but currently, the app only supports 1 order. When I arrived to pick it up and order a 2nd one for my friend, the robot arm went a little bit off track and kept trying to pick up a cup that was not dispensing.

If you just pick it by brand name and not by where the beans are grown or how they are roasted, your results will vary.\n\nThere are tons of options, so unless you're a hipster poseur you'll find something you love.\n\nThe bonuses are:  there is no waiting, no order screw-ups, and you don't have to talk to anyone!", "author": "Stan H."}

The next afternoon, I went there with my friend, and we ordered two coffees , even though I'm not a coffee person. But both of us love it. The price is very reasonable. I even met the CEO and Cofound there. I took a pic with him,  he is a nice and very easygoing person. I talked with one of their staff there too, all of them are very friendly and nice.  Very good experience. I would recommend everyone to go there to have a try.", "author": "Sky L."}

I highly recommend the hot chocolate made with oatly milk, even if you're not dairy-free, trust me. Ordering is really easy via your phone or the iPads by the robot, and there's good promo code deals available if you get their app. Even without promo codes the drinks are very reasonably priced for their taste/quality and the overall cool robot experience. There's also always friendly staff on site to answer questions and dazzle you with their extensive coffee knowledge if you're into that sort of thing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-01", "description": "I was able to come in today and try out one of the espresso's Cafe X had to offer. I think the espresso overall was delivered in a slightly bizarre way - a espresso shot dwarfed by a the normal sized cup it was served in. Seemed a little wasteful and not completely thought out (but must have something to do with the fact that a robot is serving you coffee, not a human).\n\nThere have been humans nearby the past few days who are ready to help, although the product seems to be easy enough for anybody who can use an iPhone to operate.\n\nThe espresso itself was a solid 2/5 in taste I think, but I'm trying not to base the review off of the taste because I'm no coffee connoisseur. The price however seemed infinitely reasonable, at $2.25 for the espresso, especially in downtown SF. All of the prices seemed really affordable.\n\nStill no non-dairy milk options but I'm looking forward to them adding them in the future.\n\nMy final note is less about the current product and more about the potential. I think this product has enormous potential once they iron out some of the kinks. The machine works quickly and the user interface does seem well thought out. I'm excited for them to continue to work on their product, and I hope to be back soon to try out their other vegan product, the Americano.\n\nEdit: I did find it pretty bizarre that somebody contacted Yelp and got them to remove my old review of the location, a one star review. Kind of sad that a company like this can't handle one customer who had a bad experience with them. I even gave them a second shot! Not everything in the world is a five star place, especially when it is first starting out, it is sad to see a company like Cafe X is so concerned about one negative review.\n\nEdit 2: One very exciting thing about this cafe(/technology) is that they can work with the growers to ensure that the cup that they want made can be poured every single time. So, as consistent as Starbucks is, Cafe X could be infinitely more consistent depending on how precise their machine is. Another thing to look forward to from this business.", "author": "Hans T."}

There's a cool robot ritual dance that results in a hot cup of espresso based coffee. It's kind of fun but more importantly faster than waiting in line to order at a cafe. I had an americano and the coffee was solid - about what you would get at a 'human' cafe. The only downside is the cup was very hot - apparently robot hands don't mind the heat! They had extra cups to double-cup. I'd like it if they had regular drip coffee too, which I like better than espresso drinks.", "author": "Josh L."}

So my friends recommended me to come here and try out the robot coffee service, and let me tell you, BEST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! It was the GREATEST quality cappuccino I've had in such a long time. I have to say, but it was 5x better than Starbucks (not to hate on y'all, love ur frapps). The frothy foam was just perfectly proportional to the amount coffee, and the coffee was rich with flavors. I was surprised when the robot arm waved at me when it served the drink, so totally ADORABLE!! So to sum it all up, this is a totally must have, once you get your first coffee you can't get enough of it. I would strongly recommend this place to all those coffee lover out there.
