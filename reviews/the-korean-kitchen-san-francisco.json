Another great addition to the restaurant on 9th ave. \n\nIf you're craving korea food in the inner sunset and don't feel like waiting for Manna (which is amazing for their soups btw), the Korean Kitchen is here for your rescue. \n\nComparatively, I think The Korean Kitchen is more of a bar food type of restaurants with amazing friend chicken wings and cheese corn. \n\nWe ended up ordering the following:\nCheese Corn: literally to die for. So cheesy and gooey. \nSoy Flavor Chicken Wings: perfectly fried, nicely seasoned, not too oily, lighter batter, which i enjoyed. I would order this again. \nSoon Tofu soup: The BF wanted something warm. Suprisingly the soup was on par with some of the other joints that we've tried before. Solid dish. The broth was great.\nFish Cake Soup: Not what I imagined originally. I had in mind the fish cake on the stick soup, but this was more of a fish ball soup. Nonetheless, the broth was very clear and pure. It's a nice soup to accompany the various fried dishes we got and a nice soothing dish for the tummy. \n\nAs a former SoCal resident, since moving home, I've always been on the search for good korean food comparable to my LA days. It's nice to find this joint as it definitely hits the spots.", "author": "Diane T."}

My friend was in the mood for Korean so we decided to try this hole-in-the-wall conveniently located in between all of us.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n1.5/2 Stars for Taste --\nWe ordered the kimchi bulgolgi fries, half and half fried chicken (soy ginger + mild spicy), and seafood pancake. I thought the fried chicken would be the highlight of the night, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the bulgolgi fries. I especially appreciate how they use curly fries as a base rather than the traditional fry. I preferred the soy ginger to the mild spicy (which wasn't really spicy at all) but honestly I'd probably go to San Tung instead for fried chicken of the \"soy ginger\" variety. The seafood pancake was meh. Now that I'm looking back at the pictures, we didn't get any \"dancing flakes\" on ours. Rude! Also, the panchan was nothing to write home about -- my favorite was the sweet black beans. In general, the food was on the saltier side...but we also inadvertently ordered all fried food so we may have a skewed sample.\n\n0.5/1 Stars for Value --\n$23 for fried chicken is pretty steep, but a normal San Francisco price. The portion sizes are pretty generous. We ordered three dishes (listed above) for three people and ended up paying about $21.50 each with tax and tip.  The half and half chicken also comes with a side of fries and a mini-salad. Skip the seafood pancake.\n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nWe were seated pretty quickly at 7PM on a Thursday night. There seemed to be one waiter serving the small restaurant. The food came pretty quickly. My favorite thing was the little iPad brought around at the end to pay/register for their rewards program. Convenient...if only my sausage fingers weren't so fat. \n\nNo bonus star because while I would come back for the fries and the fried chicken, I can get them better and cheaper elsewhere.\n\n---\nFor more food pictures, check out @noshameadventures on IG!", "author": "Abby W."}

To clarify, the food may not be on SoCal level, but it's slim pickings for solid Korean food in the city. I've never had to wait for a table here, unlike Manna and Toyose. Also, this place is quite affordable so it's my go-to Korean spot. However, I don't come here for BBQ - I end up at Han Il Kwan for that.\n\nFood wise, I love the seafood pancake here and the sauce that accompanies it. It's changed over time (the size and the way they cut it), but I typically get a tofu soup for myself and share the seafood pancake with whoever I'm with.

When I crave for korean food, I usually debate between manna or this place. I opt for this one if I want to eat korean fried chicken especially because they have more selections of KFC. I've tried all the flavors and my favorite one is hot spicy chicken($11.99 for half). Tbh, there is no difference between mild spicy one and hot spicy one. They taste exactly the same to me..It's gochujang base sauce that is very thick and not too sweet. It's not super good but it's okay here in inner sunset.\n\nMy favorite appetizer is kimchi bulgogi fries($10.99) and this one is really good! Bulgogi is perfectly marinated and fries are crunchy.\n\nTheir stonepot spicy pork and seafood bibimbobs ($14.99) are good. Portion is huge but I wish there is less rice.\n\nTheir both kimchi and seafood pancakes($12.99) are decent. Very crunchy and flavorful!\n\nTheir slow cooked pork($16.99) is okay. I tried it twice.

We were greeted and seated by a very polite hostess. We each got a soondubu and a soy garlic chicken to share. The banchan came quickly and was perfect to get our appetites going. The bean sprouts did not disappoint, although the broccoli was a little bit more bitter than I hoped. However, the soy garlic chicken was quite a disappointment. Much of the white meat portions were so dry and hard, neither of us could even finish it. The wings were a little bit of redemption, but half the plate was left untouched. The soondubu itself was not bad, although perhaps a little heavy handed with the MSG. I was soooo thirsty after finishing, and stuffed because the tofu portion was huge! A little disappointed that they didn't have pork soondubu though. It was a little bit odd that we and the table next to us got asked if everything was okay like five times in the span of 15 minutes, then totally abandoned when we were ready for the bill. All in all, it wasn't a horrible experience, and the price was reasonable for being in such a bustling food-filled area of the city, but I'd much rather just wait for Ebisu next time ):", "author": "Tiffany S."}

Unfortunately, I was the only one starving in the family; the rest have eaten a snack or two, so we weren't feeling eating at an All-You-Can-Eat Korean barbecue. \n\nRight across the block we found the Korean Kitchen, which served similar meat as the All-You-Can Eat place, plus it was already cooked after ordering, so it was made just right (without charred burns) The Galbi was tender, fatty, and very delicious! It required minimal chewing, but I did needed a tear when I needed to separate the meat from the bone. If you're not in for oily Galbi like I am, the bulgogi is good too! The meat is lighter and my mother was able to eat it. (she doesn't eat much oily dishes)\n\nWe also ordered the tofu soup (not shown in the picture). I liked how the egg came in separate, so we cracked it in while the bowl was boiling hot.

I was seated in the back with my friend. We ordered the bulgogi fries, half order of the soy garlic chicken, and the beef tofu soup. \n\nI actually really liked the bulgogi fries! It was sweet and cheesy. I think that there were a little too many fries for the amount of meat/sauce they topped it with, but I can enjoy plain fries. That's not a big deal to me. \n\nThe chicken was a solid choice. It was nice and juicy and the coating of the chicken wasn't too thick. I wish it was a little bit on the sweeter side though. It also came with fries (fry-day was real) and a salad. We left the salad untouched because who are we, gym-goers? \n\nThe tofu soup came with purple rice and an egg to crack into it. I thought that the soup was good, slightly lackluster but still good. I enjoyed the rice because it was chewy and cooked well. I don't think they add as much as other places, like red beans...etc. They only had the white rice and the purple rice mixed in. It was a very high ratio of white rice. \n\nI think the food was good, it wasn't exceptionally amazing, but I enjoyed everything. I definitely had to take stars away for the service. The service throughout the night was good. Something that happened that I thought was weird was that the server gave us our check really early. I definitely know that my friend and I were taking a long time, but you really don't need to give us the check. We took our time regardless but I just don't like being rushed and presented with a check before we stopped touching our food. Maybe next time will be better!

The food is authentic and delicious, the portions are generous, and the service is excellent. \n\nA couple of colleagues and I came by for lunch on a Friday and we were lucky to snag a table for 4 in the front area. It was all our first time at the restaurant, but definitely not strangers to Korean cuisine. We knew exactly what we liked and disliked (but what's to not like about Korean food??!). However, the Korean Kitchen's menu is a bit more extensive than your average Korean restaurant. They had bulgogi fries, 3 types of Korean fried chicken and other amazing menu items! They also offer many types of soup that caught our eye....think fishball soup!\n\nThe menu was pretty creative and extensive, but I opted to remain traditional and ordered the beef bulgogi bimbibap, which is basically a bowl of steamed white rice on the bottom with bbq beef and an extensive array of veggies on top. This also included a fried egg which made the dish even more delicious! My other co-workers enjoyed the veggie bimbibap and the mackerel dish. We also ordered and shared the seafood pancake as an appetizer. All dishes did not disappoint and were quite generous for lunch. Prices of all dishes were pretty consistent with other Korean establishments in the area.\n\nThis place is definitely a contender as one of the BEST Korean restaurants in the Inner Sunset Area!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-05-20", "description": "Not to be dramatic, but I guess all good things really do come to an end. If some of you didn't know, before the Korean Kitchen took over this location, the restaurant before it was Hanami Brassiere. That restaurant was also near and dear to my girlfriend and I. The good thing about The Korean Kitchen moving in and taking over was that it actually brought with it food that gave me mini orgasms when I ate. \n\n...But since my last climatic dinner there, the Korean Kitchen decided to change ownership. So I say this to you, my fellow humans that will read this post before deciding whether or not to come: \n\nKorean Kitchen? More like Korean Missin'! \n\nLet me just start with the tteok-bokki. First of all, how dare you? I'm sure our waiter had nothing to do with it because he assured us that we were cultured and that he also enjoys his tteok-bokki with ramen in it! You mean to tell me that you simply could not have added ramen to the rice cakes? Ramen. You literally had an entree named 'Ramen' on the menu. Why would you think it would be a good idea to remove that option. North and South Korea didn't truce up for this. I'm appalled. As soon as our waiter said \"sorry, we don't add ramen to the rice cakes anymore,\" I should have said \"I'm calling the cops\" because this is a crime against humanity. Honestly, how could you.. \n\nAt this point, we just hoped to god, love ya Ryan Reynolds, that they didn't do anything different to the fried rice. But just as we were disappointed with the new regime against rice cakes, we were met with another surprise.. Their kimchi fried rice, a meal we once rated as #1 in the Bay Area at this location specifically, tasted like sugar and butter. The kimchi that was in the fried rice actually tasted like cabbage drenched in the sweat of children in PE. It was clear that they didn't even use kimchi in their kimchi fried rice.. Like if you wanted to be sneaky, don't serve the kimchi on the side for comparison. C'mon guys, food crimes 101. And Jesus, whoever cooked the kimchi fried rice, let me ask you something my fellow man: \"Why?\" Jeez you dropped the entire jar of diabetes into that dish. Don't get me wrong, sweet kimchi fried rice is cool. All I gotta say is, I damn near forgot it was kimchi fried rice. I thought I was eating sugar cubes with sweaty cabbage with a sprinkle of rice. \n\nLastly, this is what really broke my heart the most. We ordered the seafood tofu soup. \n\n\"How spicy do you want it?\"\n\nLevel 4, please!\n\n(MIND YOU, this is 4 on a scale from 1 to 5 being the hottest.) \n\nTell me why that thing came out and it tasted like a 0.2 on the gringo scale. I can not believe this. I felt disrespected. I felt dehumanized. I feel betrayed. We paid $13 for this and all that came out was some water with red food coloring and a half-eaten octopus. \n\nI know, I know. This review was incredibly harsh. Just imagine how your favorite customers are going to feel when they come in next time and find out everything is different? It's like that day you found out Obama wasn't going to be in office anymore. I bet you were depressed when you found out how bad it actually was going to get. \n\nEven in bad times, I still saw the good in the restaurant we both once loved. I would have given the place a 1-star rating but I must say, that restroom looked nice. So for that, you get to keep the extra star. What can I say, I prioritize hygiene. \n\nBut please, old owner, if you're reading this.. come back. We miss you, baby.", "author": "Vu N."}

Nevertheless, the decoration and overall ambience of the restaurant was nice and consisted of Soju bottles stacked along the wall, along with Korean posters.\n\n2) Wait Time\nIt did take close to 20-30 minutes to get seated, but it was a holiday during prime lunch hours.\nIf you chat with your party, time should fly by.\n\n3) Food & Drinks\nEverything was very good and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, considering how new this location is.\n\na. Kimchi Fried Rice \n- Not too spicy and great tasting. Must try!\n\nb. Bulgogi Bibimbap \n- Also good! Not sure if it's a must try though.\n\nc. Spicy Pork\n- Not too spicy either (for me), but very nicely flavored. Must try!\n\nd. Seafood Pancake\n- One of my favorite dishes during this meal! Must try!\n\nNot that it really matters, but we asked for water and received tea instead.\nHowever, the tea was rice flavored and a very nice substitute for water in hindsight.\n\n4) Service\nAll the waitresses/hostesses were very nice and courteous!\nWhen we had trouble ordering, she was patient and even added her own insight regarding the specialty dishes. \n\nAs a matter of fact, while we were waiting for our seats, one of the waitresses actually stopped an extremely sketchy homeless lady from entering the restaurant. She chased after the homeless lady halfway through the restaurant and commanded her to exit, threatening to call the police. The homeless lady yelled and threw a bunch of her items on the floor and rushed out. \n\nIt's great to see that the waitress had the courage to confront her and preserve the safety & atmosphere of the restaurant, or else I would have gladly intervened and helped.\n\n5) Pricing\nQuite competitively priced: Menu items were all around 12 dollars or above.\nIt was a bit pricier than I thought, but I believe Korean food is pretty expensive anyways.\nDefinitely worth the value though.\n\nConclusion + Keep in Mind: \n- Parking is extremely tough!!!

Worst experience ever.\n1. foods were decent....normal Korean food. a little too sweet for me.\n2. charge 20% tips for a group but provide very bad services.... seriously?\n3. one of the waiter was rude\n    - bad attitude\n    - didn't tell us there is a 2hrs dine in time limit and expect we all know!!! \n    - when we asked him to store the cake, he didn't say anything. when we told him please clean the table and bring our cake, he didn't say anything. Until we asked again after 10 mins, he suddenly said we already passed the 2 hrs dine in the time limit (which no one had told us before and I didn't see any sign saying that). The waiter didn't say anything until we passed the 2 hrs time limit and try to force us to leave and refuse to serve the cake...that was very shady.\nAfter I keep telling him no one told us any of these rules otherwise we will make sure we leave within the 2 hrs. He also said usually busy restaurant doesn't serve the cake which none of us had that experience before plus I don't see this restaurant was that busy. after going back and forth, he said: \"I am busy now so I will get back to you after I serve other tables...\" WTF? Is it because we already paid the bill plus the mandatory 20% tips and we are no longer your customers and we are still sitting here? \nSeems like he wanted to just ignore us so we asked the other waiter about the 2hrs limit time and why can't let us have cake. The other waiter said they do have 2 hrs time limit but they do serve cake so he gave us plates to eat the cake. \nIf you told us about your time limit when we sit down which most restaurants will do that, we have no problem with that even we think the rule is a little bit weird since it is not a buffet restaurant. How can you expect people all know your rules and treat the customers like this? \n\nI am sure there are a lot of better restaurants out there...Sorry, I won't go back for sure.", "author": "B B."}

They haven't been open long, and they seem to still be working out the kinks in terms of managing turnover, seating, managing the wait list, etc.  The wait was long despite open tables, my party was skipped over, etc.\n\nFood: We ordered the seafood bibimbap and the bulgogi.  Both were good.  Neither stood out as fantastic.  The banchan was better than at a lot of Korean places in the city - in particular, I thought their kimchi was well-balanced.\n\nWe didn't order the anju/junk food type food - Korean fried chicken wings, kimchi/spicy fries, pajeon (pancake).  To be honest, it looked like that might be the food to order here.  It definitely looked and smelled great, but we were trying to be a little healthier than that.\n\nThe adult beverage options are limited to Korean beers (OB and Hite) and soju.  Would love to see them add wine and some non-Korean/microbrew beers to the menu.\n\nService: It was slow, and as noted above, I assume they will work out the kinks.  If they don't, I will be less inclined to return.\n\nAmbiance: It's nicer (and cleaner) inside than a \"hole in the wall,\" but it's still very casual w brightly lit dining areas and cheerily painted walls. \n\nQuality/Value: The servings are generous, and the prices are reasonable, possibly lower than average for similar fare in the city.  \n\nOverall: I'll go back to see if they improve their service, and I will probably try the more fast food/junk food options.

Much of the grub served here are to be eaten with plenty of alcohol. I think if you are only going to come here for the food, you're going to the wrong place. \n\nWho wouldn't want a refreshingly fruity soju that pairs nicely with a yummy spicy dish of rice cakes or a licking your fingers good soy glazed fried chicken? \n\nSince The Korean Kitchen's only been open for a few months, I've gotta say the curious hipster crowds are definitely into this spot, while the native SF locals aren't really digging the small portioned fried chicken dishes and expensive bottles of soju. We saw one family split before the food even got to the table. Like, how are you gonna sit a family of 4 who have 2 small kids at a bar? Really? Obviously, ya don't know what a \"family\" seating is. Table or nothing. \n\nE X P E R I E N C E:\n\n\n10.99 for a bottle of soju or flavored soju (pineapple, grapefruit, or peach). Expensive! I can get a good bottle of the same thing at a Korean market for $3! \n\n11.99 for a half or 20.99 for a FULL SIZED game hen. They say its chicken, but the meat was drier than usual. We were unimpressed. To top it off, this dish came with a handful of crispy fries and a shredded cabbage salad w/ mystery dressing. \n\n12.99 Seafood Pancake w/ bonito flakes. Decent. Maybe the only appetizer that really tasted good to me. \n\n8.99 Corn Cheese. This would've been more enjoyable if we had spoons. This didn't faze me too much since my chopsticks skills are quite pro, but I can't say the same for my buddies. \n\n12.99 Mandoo (dumpling) Tofu Soup. Seemed like the dumplings weren't fully cooked after it got to the table. Korean soups like this generally come to your table bubbling hot, yet I couldn't hear the familiar bubbling sound, so I figured someone messed up. \n\nBan Chan. Shredded kimchi where its too salty to distinguish that its really a kimchi. More like wet salty pieces. \n\nS E R V I C E: \n\nAttentive, but slow. Food came out at a moderate pace, but it felt rushed at some point. Since the spot was beginning to fill up, they would dump the check on you before your main course came out. Very Korean, except by American standards; its rude as $hit. \n\nOverall, the hype here was the flavored soju and some decent snacks.

It was the same for both, so we decided we're not going to come back after this (or maybe in 5 years).", "author": "Jason C. J."}

The food was not wow nor it was rated Michelin that so many people waiting! They did not info us about their policy of 2 hours limited dining time for a party until we done paying the bill and asked for table clean up and plates for our friends' birthday cake! They are almost like \"kick us out\" by just brought out our cake and left there and want us to leave after they took our bill and the 20% tips! So if anyone plan to have Birthday dinner here, please be aware their \"expected us to know\" policy of 2 hours limitation and they can kick you out once you exceed 2 hours! When we exited the restaurant, we see no one waiting for their table, so all I experienced is we were not welcome to be served here and I don't think they deserved that 20% tips!

We didn't stumble on a great one, but instead, an awesome one - The Korean Kitchen!\nThe Korean Kitchen has a far nicer ambiance than Manna (woohoo!), plus plenty of seating for parties of all sizes. I am no Korean foodie, however the dishes looked just as good or even better than Manna. *Can you tell we were so happy we didn't make it into Manna? Lol!*\nWe had the Kim Chee fried rice, Galbi (nice cuts, not the fatty ones), half fried chicken (deep fried light and crispy), Jap Chae (YUM!), and our daughter ordered a ramen with bulgogi. Every dish was excellent. Not to mention the little condiment dishes with rice that first comes out - great taste teasers!. Roy, our server was super helpful and helped make our dinner very enjoyable.\nOf course for any restaurant on Irving, finding parking is an issue.

So why 3 stars? This place seats 45 and the turnover is slow. Not set up well for more than two tops. You wait in a narrow entrance where the backs of the chairs are tucked behind a black box mounted on the walk. Yes, I bashed my head on this. I thought I was a yutz until the next 2 people who came in did the same. So you start your meal with a headache, then you have to listen to loud Korean pop and rap. More headache. I could handle the pop at a lower volume, but please. I would say this would be a good place for a young Korean couple with hard heads. I mentioned the chair issue to the host/waiter, but she looked at me like I had Kim chi on my face. The Kim chi was good.", "author": "Jonathan S."}

I only came here for lunch so I've only had the dol-sot (stone pot) bibimbap, but it tasted exactly like it should... super hot stone pot got that nice layer of crunchy rice, the veggies were marinated nicely and weren't cold (meaning they didn't come straight from the fridge), the bulgogi was well-cooked, and the fried egg had a perfectly runny yolk! Also, the banchan (side dishes), the quality of which I consider a very good measure of a Korean restaurant, were excellent!\n\nLooking at the rest of the menu, they offer most of the basic traditional Korean dishes, as well as some more new school items, all of which I can't wait to try.\n\nIf you're thinking of going to Manna, do yourself a favor and go here instead... it's just a couple blocks away, and it's definitely in the argument for Best Korean in SF (which Manna, unfortunately, is not).\n\nOh, and the prices are reasonable, the service is good, and the restaurant itself is very clean and comfortable.", "author": "Michael B."}

The flavor of the chicken was so delicious that I also ordered it the second time (which was also so delicious and fresh). If you are visiting, I would definitely recommend it! I also tasted the Kimchi Fried Rice, this is my favorite Kimchi Fried Rice. It is deliciously seasoned and chewy and delicious! It comes with a fried egg on top. This Kimchi Fried Rice is the best I have ever tasted in my life, really. Lastly, I tried the Hot Stone Tofu Bibimbap! I usually order Bibimbap because I love the variety of ingredients. I'm sure the ingredients in this restaurant are some of the freshest in the whole area. If you are touring to San Francisco or you are from the area, like me, come and try the food! Both times I have visited the restaurant, the environment was amazing, my server (Roy) was so kind, helpful and sweet.
