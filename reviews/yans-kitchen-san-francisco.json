First off, this establishment is cash only and it's a bit older, so don't expect fancy eats or those hipster joint feels.\n\nI first came here with a friend and ordered three dishes to share between the two of us. We ordered the twice cooked pork, orange beef, and chicken chow mein. Wow, the flavors were spot on and it came out pretty quickly too! Did we finish it? Yes we did. More so my friend did and his stomach hurt the whole evening after. But that didn't stop us from coming back again but with more our friends. \n\nThe next time we came back with three more of our friends and we ordered the general Tsao, twice cooked pork, orange beef, Hunan shrimp, and Hunan beef! It tasted just as delicious as before and a lot of us were saying, thank goodness they add vegetables in their dishes so it makes us feel like it's a bit more healthier than just eating the meat. The Hunan shrimp wasn't all that great, but the General Tsao was just the right balance between meat and the fried coating. It was sweet but also had a little kick to it. MUST ORDER. As well as the twice cooked pork (but that's just my favorite dish = biased).", "author": "Ada C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-11-03", "description": "I ordered Chicken with String Beans ($8.25?) and a large Hot and Sour Soup ($6.45?). My friend ordered the Twice Cooked Pork ($8.75?).\n\nWe decided to go to this restaurant because of the high Yelp ratings. However, I think this place deserves 2 to 2.5 stars. \n\nWe came in at around 6:00 pm on a Friday night. We saw two other people sitting near us, but most of the time, we were the only people seated. When we got our menus, I noticed a pen was used to write new prices on top of the old prices. It was hard to tell how much our food costed. It was worse when we received our receipt. The receipt was in Chinese and we could not see the price of each individual item. We were only given one lump sum total. \n\nThere was no way of knowing if our food would include rice. Rice was not listed anywhere on the menu. When I asked the waitress, she said I was given three options that was not on the menu:\n1. Half a plate of rice, half the amount of Chicken with String Beans\n2. The full amount of Chicken with String Beans\n3. The full amount of Chicken with String Beans and a side of rice\nI assumed the third option would mean we would have to pay for an extra side of rice. I ended up choosing the first option. \n\nNow for the food... it was just average.\nChicken with String Beans: There was barely any sauce, but tons of oil in this dish. The dish also included garlic pieces and sliced carrots. The carrots and green beans were a bit hard and crunchy. They tasted fine to me but compared to other Chinese restaurants, I would consider them to be a little undercooked. The chicken just tasted average and a bit plain. \n\nHot and Sour Soup: This large soup included bamboo shoots, thin egg whites, small tofu slices, and fungi. Usually when I drink hot and sour soup, I would have to drink a lot of water. However, it was not really spicy even though I could see tons of little red pepper pieces. It was big enough to serve two people. \n\nTwice Cooked Pork: My friend tried to add chili sauce that was on the table to the pork because his dish wasn't spicy enough. He thought the chili sauce had a weird sour taste to it. He liked the cabbage in this dish though. The meat to vegetable (cabbage, broccoli, carrots, onions) ratio was really low. \n\nThere were no signs on the walls or near the entrance that said this place was cash only. Luckily, we had cash with us. \n\nThe waitress did not check up on us and we had to call her over for our bill. The two people who were sitting near us were going to pay for their meal. I noticed the waitress just stood next to them the whole time and waited until they paid after they were done eating. It was a bit awkward and I was concerned she was going to wait at our table the whole time after we finished our meals. When it came time to pay the bill, however, she ended up just setting the check on our table and left. We had to go up to the counter to pay. Furthermore, the waitress never asked us if we wanted water or tea. I think it is assumed you have to ask her for it. \n\nI don't think I will be coming back in the near future.", "author": "Kristina M."}

Yan's kitchen got 4 stars and I was really excited to try a new chinese spot close to my house, but it did not satisfy the cravings. The food lacked flavor and the meats were very chewy, thick and dry. For two girls, we ordered the chicken chow mein, beef with tofu and general tsao's chicken.\n\nChicken chow mein: very americanized, it was spaghetti noodles with very little sauce and the chicken was extremely dry. I did like that they gave generous vegetables like carrots and broccoli, but it tasted like eating we were just eating chicken with plain spaghetti\n\nBeef with tofu: this is normally my favorite thing to order so i was super excited to order this when I saw it on the menu, but boy... I was very very disappointed. It wasn't the right type of beef, it was thick and large pieces that were extremely chewy - pass\n\nGeneral tsao's chicken: this was the only redeeming part of the meal, I mean how could you messed up chicken that was battered and fried right? Thankfully, their sauce tasted alright and they had chili peppers to add some kick. It wasn't the best dish I've had, but it made the meal better - otherwise I would have been very angry.\n\nIn conclusion, save yourself some money and go to chinatown for some authentic chinese food please.

When le bf and I came in, there was only 1 other person sitting inside. We had Yelped looking for Chinese food, and because of the price, and the fact that it was a hole in the wall, we were both up for it. \n\nAfter studying the menu and looking at what people recommended on Yelp, we decided to get:\n1. Salt and pepper fried fish special with white rice and fried dumplings\n2. Tofu and green bean special with white rice and fried dumplings\n3. General Tso's chicken special with white rice and egg rolls.\n4. Large hot and sour soup.\n\nThe portions were pretty big. Le bf and I ended up taking half of the bowl of hot and sour soup home along with basically the whole portion of General Tso's chicken and some fried dumplings. \n\nWe both added more vinegar to the hot and sour soup because we didn't think it was sour enough, it wasn't too spicy either (which I liked because I'm a total wuss when it comes to spice). The fried egg rolls were really small and thin, packed with veggies only. The fried dumplings were literally dumplings, that were battered, and then fried. I have never eaten fried dumplings in that way. Le bf really enjoyed them and you could tell they were homemade. \n\nMy favorite dish of the night was the tofu and green bean special. There were plenty of beans and tofu. The flavors really came together and the beans weren't soggy, they still had a crunch to them, which I enjoy. \n\nThe fried fish came out hot and somewhat crispy. I just wish that the chef would have fried the fish for longer so that the batter was crunchier. The fish was extremely tender, which is a good thing. \n\nLe bf ordered his General Tso's chicken. I think he thought it was good, definitely not the best, but not the worst either. I think that the batter on the chicken could have been crispier. \n\nOverall, the price was reasonable and the food tasted good. Our whole entire dinner was only around $34 and we had enough leftover for another meal or 2. It is definitely a hole in the wall run by a nice husband and wife team. This place is also very vegetarian friendly. By the time we left, the restaurant was about 85% full. I think we will be back.\n\nPro tip: This place is cash only.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

I'm a person who likes salty food but this was just too much. The broccoli and chicken were super salty as it soaked up a lot of the sauce. The tofu was bearable. The carrots were dry looking too.

Unbeknownst to them, there was a vulnerable tell to my shrouded deliberation. My hand gave way to the idyllic thoughts of a brave Chinese chef deep frying chicken in the name of his superior, General Tso. Immediately my mind was enveloped of thoughts of the food critic from Ratatouille.\n\nI would love to try other dishes here, but every time I come here I always order the General Tso's chicken. It is absolutely impeccable. The chefs themselves were trained by General Tso. The only way to describe the chicken is in layers. There is quite a bit of intricacy in how it's crafted. The outer layer is a delicious soft crunch, and as your teeth begin to penetrate this outer layer, they're met with a slightly harder crunch. It's quite subtle, but this is what makes their chicken so phenomenal. The precise reason is that it builds up an expectation, a familiar expectation from eating so much fried chicken, but instead of fulfilling that expectation, it comes at you like an M.Night Shyamalan twist. The twist is that slightly harder crunch. Normally you'd think after breaking through the first outer layer it would get softer, but nope. It was a minute increase in density that bypassed my expectations. \n\nBeyond the delicious and bewildering coating, the sauce was delicious but not overpowering, and the meat was incredibly tender and juicy. Their General Tso's Chicken is a paragon.", "author": "Ankur K."}

Overall a 3.5 from me.\n\n*this place is cash only\n\nFood: 3.5\nLunch specials give you a choice of white rice or fried rice (+$1.00), and an order of steamed dumplings, fried dumplings, or fried eggrolls.\nI ordered the orange chicken. It was decent, but nothing to write home about. It seemed like it was fried for a little too long. 3\nMy coworkers ordered the general tso's chicken, mongolian beef, and broccoli chicken. Their ratings for the food were 4, 4, and 3 respectively. So overall pretty good.\n\nService: 5\nThe place was empty (~11:50am On a Wednesday) so our group of 5 sat down immediately. Service was really quick as expected. No complaints.\n\nAmbience: 3\nThis place is fairly small, but had tables that could seat about 6 people.

It was delicious. The chicken with broccoli was good but not great. The lunch plates come with 2 vegetable egg rolls. The egg rolls were TOO GREASY! The chow mein was TOO GREASY too! The noodles looked and tasted like spaghetti noodles and he sauce was tasty but not enough soy sauce. The tea is in bulk which is better then a teabag but served in a small plastic water glass instead of a teapot and tea cups which was a let down. You will need extra napkins to drain the oil from the egg rolls. We had to keep asking the waitress for extra napkins as there are none on the table and We needed some extra ones to wipe our mouths and greasy fingers. The waitress was nice but skimpy with the napkins because we asked 2 times for some and each time we only got one. We were a party of 3.

No, not necessarily, as long as you know what to expect when you come in. They have a set of lunch specials from 11am-3pm that are all around $6.50, where you get a bowl of soup, your choice of dumplings or egg rolls, and your choice of one of roughly 15 American-Chinese entrees.\n\nI ended up going with the Hunan chicken, upgrading my dumplings to XLB, though, in hindsight, I really should have just straight up ordered the orange chicken instead (I think the Asian in me was trying to resist that urge). That said, they do also have a regular menu, which I imagine has more traditionally Chinese dishes.\n\nHow was the food though? It was okay. The XLB weren't really like XLB at all: just giant dumplings wrapped XLB style, minus the soupy goodness. The Hunan chicken itself was chock full of flavor, but definitely came in on the too-salty side (catering to more American taste buds, I imagine). Still, given the pricing, I could see myself coming again if I were in the mood, in the way that some people do actually crave Panda Express on occasion.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - There's a single 2-3\" step to get in to this smaller restaurant, but, once in, you'll find that the majority of the seating is accessible, save for the counter/kitchen seating.\n\nBathroom - Didn't check them out, so no comment.", "author": "Johnny W."}

You'll hardly see Yan glance up from his woks - leaving his wife, Mei, to (wo)man the front lines.\n\nWhile the decor leaves a bit to be desired (think of it as an exercise in simplicity!), the food itself is filling, tasty, and best of all...affordable for any budget. \n\nComing in the day after Bay To Breakers, the GF and I desperately needed some hangovers taken care of, and fast. To that end, Yan's did not disappoint. \n\nWe ordered an order of Combination Chow Fun, some Hunan Beef and a side of Fried Rice. \n\nThe Hunan Beef was well-seasoned and the vegetables retained their crunch very well. Also, the dish had just the right amount of heat - not too overwhelming, but a really subtle kick. \n\nThe Chow Fun was also delicious; there's something about the quality and freshness of the meat/poultry/vegetables at Yan's that surpasses that of other Chinese places. Similarly, the portions served were surprisingly large, even by Chinese restaurant standards. \n\nIn spite of the fact that we had come right in the middle of a busy lunch hour crowd, we were seated pretty quickly. To her credit, Mei was also very cheery in taking our order and making sure that we were well attended to. It was funny catching her and her husband having a quick laugh with one another after the restaurant cleared out; their teamwork is evident and very much admirable - they clearly have the formula for success down pat! \n\nKudos to the duo at Yan's, not only for turning out such a high-quality product, but for showing that it's entirely possible to make a living doing what you love. I wish them nothing but continued success and prosperity!", "author": "Mark V."}

The place is exactly as how it was reviewed by many of the others here.  The place is dated and could use a make over but that's not what you have to worry about when you come to this place.  If you want ambiance go someplace else.  This place's strength is the food that the chef is pumping out all on his own.  \n\nThe place is really small.  We sat at a table for 6 because 2 other tables of 4 were not cleared from the previous customers.  The place only has maybe 8 to 10 tables?  The place is run by a couple and they are doing the best they can.  The female is taking orders and serving, clearing tables, cashing out while the male is pumping out all the dishes he can non stop.  \n\nThis is really a hard working couple and I knew that others had mentioned that the service may be a bit slow but until you go there for yourself you won't understand why.  The place is pretty busy and we saw couples, other tourists, locals come and go and you can see why locals would totally be enamored with this place.  Their food is amazing... period.\n\nWe were 3 adults and 1 child so I tried to order accordingly.  We ordered one bbq pork fried rice, combination chow mein, sesame beef and general tso chicken.  I saw many people say in their reviews that the General Tso's was the best they ever had so I was more than intrigued to try it myself.  \n\nWell eventually the General Tso's came to the table and it was absolutely true.  This was the best General Tso's ever.  It has a nice tang while having a nice crispy light batter to it.  The batter is so light it's sublime and the sesame beef wasn't that different as well.  The chicken has some fresh slices of jalapeno peppers which was a nice sting to the dish.  I took them all because I was the only one who likes jalapeno's but overall the food was nothing short of the perfect.  My wife who is very particular about Chinese food said this was the best she ever had and I can't say I disagree with her.  \n\nWe only had 4 dishes but the meat dishes were the best I can say.  We sort of ran out of fried rice so I had ordered a steamed rice to go with our left overs which we were going to take out with us.  \n\nI was very pleased that I went to Yan's because the reviews were absolutely spot on.

The vegetables seemed fresh and I was glad that there were not huge chunks of near raw green bell pepper.  Lots of Chinese spots include those and I don't care for it.  I also like my onions to be cooked a little more, but now that I know, I'll ask them to cook the onions a little longer next time.\n\nMy original motivation for going here was my hankering for some noodles.  I didn't do a very thorough eval of this spot for going, so I guess it is my fault that they didn't have crispy noodles (hong kong style).\n\nThe quality of the chicken was really good, not fatty, not dry, and it seemed like white meat.  This is key.  Some inexpensive Chinese places have horrible almost inedible meat, chewy, fatty, and nasty.  I was glad that this place was nothing like this.\n\nThe people working there (I'm guessing the owners) were nice and were not rude like you can sometimes get from other Chinese places.  They both seemed to be easy going and not in a rush (in a good way, not in a lazy way).\n\nThe prices were decent for what it was, but seemed a little on the high side for this type of food, but I guess it is closer to the fidi, so it probably has higher overhead.  $10 for a plate of chow mein after tax and tip.

Walked up and it looked like my favorite kind of restaurant, a hole in the wall. Walked in and my uncle already knew what he wanted, General Tsos Shrimp, Combo fried rice no veggies, extra egg along with an order of veggie rolls. \n\nA couple of sake shots later the food arrived and my uncle and I were very pleased. It is great to see a Chinese food place still making FRESH food at a beyond reasonable price!  The bill was so surprising the lady joked with us and said she gave us 50% off!

The fried rice was decent, but I asked for no peas or carrots (why would anyone put peas and carrots in rice? It's not a pot pie!) The fried pork dumplings were awful. I was expecting something like P.F. Chang's pan-fried dumplings. What I received was a gob of tempura batter wrapped around what may have once been a dumpling, with very little filling. A grease ball. I couldn't eat it. The egg-flower soup was bland and tasteless as well.\n\nThe entrees all tasted very similar to each other; high in sodium and overly dressed with soy sauce. It's your average Chinese food place, probably perfect for satisfying a craving for Chinese food after a night of binge drinking or some adult extra-curricular activities. Just stick to the classic dishes. You won't be expressing culinary wonderment at the chef's deft hand in creating explosive flavors, but you also won't be hurling in disgust (unless you order the dumplings) or experiencing disintery either. If you order the dumplings, you're on your own and I'll just say, \"I told you so\" right now.\n\nBecause I was pleased regarding their willingness to make my rice without the peas and carrots, (which tells me their food is made-to-order), the prices are unbelievably LOW (three of us had lunch specials consisting of appetizer, soup, entree, and rice for under $20 total) and the food was definitely better than Panda Express, I would order from here again in the midst of a craving for a quick Chinese food meal. \n\nConvenient walk from the finanical district of downtown SF.", "author": "Heather A."}

Yan's Kitchen gets 5 starts in my \"Cheap Chinese Eats\" category.\n\nComing to this restaurant is like seeing the movie \"Boyhood.\" Nothing spectacular or dramatic things occur but people find it heartwarming and soulful. \n\nThis restaurant is located on the edge of Chinatown, just 1 block from Transamerica Pyramid. Clearly, Godzilla fell down just 2 blocks from this restaurant in the latest movie but Mr. Yan's has been passionately cooking for more than 20 years like nothing happened. \n\nMr. Yan and his wife, Mei are some of the nicest people on earth. A lot of repeaters come back to this restaurant to enjoy the cheap but delicious food and to see their smiles. Every time I come to this restaurant, I feel like I were invited to a Chinese friend's house and their kitchen happened to be the size of a small restaurant. And the friend's parents cook the food for me. Even if you come here alone, they will be happy to welcome you. \nThe decor may be dated but that's a charm and we, repeating customers don't care. \n\nThe most popular dish here is \"General Tso's Chicken\" and it is really good. I also like to order \"Salt and Pepper Fish\", \"Fried Rice\" and any dish with broccoli because their broccoli is always cooked perfectly. If you order Shanghai Dumplings, you may find there is no soup in them. It may be affected by the unusual California drought. They still taste good! \n\nSometimes, fine dining at Michelin-starred restaurants gets boring. We pay hundreds of dollars and get food with the sous-vide meat, the foam and the spherification. Although, the dishes may have chef's creative passion, some dishes have no soul at all. \n\nHere at Yan's Kitchen, every dish is soulful and served with love. \n\nIf you are a lady and dumped by your boyfriend, come here even when you are in your sweat pants or in your pajamas and eat a lot. Mr.Yan and Mei's smiles and their food will comfort you.  \nMost of all, their food will give you plenty of energy to slap your ex-boyfriend's cheeks super hard. \n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Manabu M."}

I got a shrimp and egg rice plate, and added $.35 for the Shanghai dumplings. My sister got the General Tso plate with chicken spring roll. Other than the General Tso chicken, which was tender and flavorful, the rest of the food we got was not that good. I'm Chinese and I've eaten my share of good, so-so, and bad Chinese food, and sorry to say, this is probably near the bottom. The Shanghai dumplings had very thick gummy wrappers, and the meat wasn't fresh or flavorful. The shrimp with eggs was overcooked and bland - needed salt and seasoning.", "author": "Ellen H."}

Light and crisp with just the right amount of batter, and a great balance of sweetness and spice.  Dishes with string beans are quite nice as well with fresh, crisp beans that aren't overly cooked like you would find elsewhere.  The prices are cheap and this is probably the best value for dollar around.\n\nThe husband and wife owners fix things up quickly and are happy to please.  While on the edge of Chinatown/FiDi, you may miss it or pass right by it, it's definitely worth making a visit.  The only problem is that they may close early on days when they aren't busy, so you may want to call ahead to confirm that they're open.", "author": "Chris C."}

Basically the only decision you need to make is what meat to pair with which sauce. It's a lot of food for lunch that you might be tempted to have a little siesta after. I've tried several items here from Kung Pao Chicken to the Mongolian Beef (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=DvcAC_nlKaTDsHcA8Slagw) and they've been tasty although a tad greasy. It's not the most authentic Chinese food but as long as you remember that, it's ok. We all have our fried sweet and sour cravings sometimes. \n\nThe stars here though are the husband and wife team that run this cozy place. He cooks, she serves.

Jamie went for the General Tso's Chicken over the same Fried Rice (see photo). I think I did better if you ask me, but don't tell him. Both plates were $6.99, and the portions were more than generous. \n\nI forgot to mention we started with a couple of Fried Shrimp Dumplings (see photo).

I was doing 3 day's worth of training in a building next to the pyramid, and found this place on Yelp.  The first day was so good, I went back there for lunch every day I was in town.\n\nFirst day:  General Tso's Chicken Lunch Special -- Absolutely as perfect as a crispy, sweet, and lightly spicy chicken dish as you could expect.  I got the fried rice on the side, and it also came with a couple dumplings.  I upgraded to the Shanghai style for 35 cents.  Different than other Shanghai dumplings I've had in the past, but excellent.\n\nSecond day:  I ordered off the dinner menu.  I got the Combination Egg Fu Yung with a side of white rice.  It was some of the very best egg fu yung I've ever had.  (I always have to get it when I see it on a dinner menu.)\n\nThird day:  Orange Chicken Lunch Special -- Not as good as the General Tso's, but still awesomely crispy.  I ordered the chow mein as my side this time.  It's a very light chow mein... I sometimes like mine to be ever so slightly heavier.  Again with the Shanghai dumplings.  Perfect with hot sauce, vinegar, and a little soy sauce.\n\nEvery lunch comes with a small bowl of soup.  They seem to rotate through a different soup every day.  All are tasty, if not very rich.\n\nI quickly noticed that this place has regulars.  I saw another guy there all three days in a row, ordering a big bowl of the soup of the day and a batch of dumplings.  The value of what you get for what you pay is beyond exemplary.  Please note:  It's cash only.  The place is a little run-down.  And if you wait too long to go to lunch, the small dining room will fill up.  It's just two employees... a waitress and a chef.

I've been here twice, and ordered the general tso's chicken combo, and orange chicken combo. It's the exact cooking method, but just different flavoring at the end. \n\nTheir combo is pretty cheap, about $7.50, and you get a decent amount of food for that price. The thing that makes this place awesome though is just how perfect the crisp is on their fried meats and dumplings. I've don't think I've ever had truly authentic Hunan food before, so I can't really attribute the goodness of this place to authenticity. However, whatever this is, it's good. It kind of reminds me of Panda Express, except it's the right flavor and the perfect texture of deep fried chinese food. It's crispy, but not too crispy, making a very delicate and perfected bite. I don't really know how else to describe it hahahaha. Anyway, try this place out if you're ever nearby.", "author": "Andrew S."}

The man who cooks who apparently owns and operates the place was taking a break at one of his tables in front of the diner, presumably reading the latest news from Hong Kong.  Since I was ordering to go, he motioned for me to grab a menu and let his wife know what I wanted.  No muss, no fuss, and no charades to seat me, tell me what the specials were, or anything.  Make up your mind a tell the lady.  Simple.  I liked that.\n\nI decided upon Beef with Garlic in Ginger Sauce, and requested it extra spicy.  The woman looked at me with an eyebrow cocked and a gaze that said, \"Do you know what you're asking for, white boy?\"  Indeed, I did.  So much so I mentioned it again.  She seemed ambivalent.  I also ordered a hot and sour soup, made extra hot as well.  \n\nI paid for my food (cash only!) and the gentleman put down his paper and went to work.  I took a seat opposite the beverage refrigerator and listened to sound of sizzle, stir-frying, and steaming.  In about five minutes, she kindly announced, \"Ready!\" \n\nI traipsed back to my hotel and dove in.  The soup was fresh and light.  No overpowering saltiness, and veggies and tofu and egg ribbons abounded.  Good stuff.  I am a tough sell on hot and sour soup.  I give it a 6/10- above average.\n\nThe entree, which I ordered without rice, was hot and clearly freshly cooked.  It also contained huge broccoli florets, which I was not expecting but enjoyed thoroughly.  They were cooked to absolute perfection, that harmonious blend of crisp yet tender.  The beef was flavorful and thoroughly coated with diced garlic and ginger.  Red pepper flakes, too.  The sauce could have been a little more gingery-spicy but it was good without being too thick and goopy.  \n\nThe spiciness?  This was a zero-napkin dish.  I know the chef must have added extra red pepper for me, but it simply didn't register any heat.  Some places make their food so fiery that my brow creates it own precipitation.  Not today.  No napkins needed to soak up the sweatstorm I was expecting.  Try again, Yan's.  \n\nDespite the lack of heat, I would give the dish a 6/10 as well.  I would come back, but I will know to add my own liquid fire.", "author": "Chris H."}

So we waited...and waited...and finally ordered 15 minutes later.  And then we waited...and waited...and waited...and a half hour later finally the first dish arrived.  (With me so far?  Almost an hour from sitting to getting our food?)  About 20 minutes after that, the last member of our party was served his sauteed eggplant in broccoli...BUT THEY FORGOT THE EGGPLANT!

A Chinese restaurant out of tofu!  \n\nThe food was decent, but forgettable.  I swear the Hoisin sauce comes out of a Sisco bottle.  The sauce on the General Tso's Chicken was very nice; a bit different from what I get in most Chinese restaurants.\n\n(I might mention that during this, I saw a few parties come in, sit down, wait for service, not get any, get up, and leave.)\n\nAnd then we waited 20 minutes for the check.  At that point we were calculating it ourselves and we were just going to leave money and walk out when she finally screamed out the total at us.

This place seems like it would be more of a hot lunch spot than a dinner spot, with more of a \"diner\" feel to it.  My friend and I arrived there probably 45 minutes before closing time, and got our food pretty fast.  I was pretty disappointed with the General Tso's, the coating was burned and the flavor overpowered the sauce, which seemed decent.  The fried rice wasn't anything to go crazy over, though I thought the Egg Foo Yung was fine.  Everything seemed significantly more salty than what I'm used to, even at the most shopping-mall quality Chinese stands.  \n\nIt could have been because we came in around closing time that the quality of food wasn't up to the reviews here, but I don't think I would risk it by going back and rather just try to think about dinner sooner than I did and go somewhere more renowned for their dinner menu.", "author": "Alex F."}

She got hungry and wanted chinese food, so being in a neighborhood full of restaurants I decided to park and look for something good. We parked in the underground lot close to Pacific & Columbus. While we unloaded her wheelchair from the car I quickly Yelped \"chinese food\" in the area I was in and Yan's was the first one on the list with a good review. \n\nIm giving 3/5 stars because the food itself was alright and the restaurant was a little dirty when we went.  There are only 2 people that run this place, its hard to serve customers, clean, and cook at the same time. The place is run by Mr & Mrs Yan. A husband and wife team that were very nice and accommodating. Their customer service is excellent and they answered every question we had with a big smile on their faces. We ordered mongolian chicken, kung pao chicken, salt & pepper fish, and a few orders of chicken fried rice. Food was cooked fresh and came out fast. Everything was cooked properly and tasted good except for the sauce they use on the Mongolian and kung Pao. It tasted a little to salty for me. I don't usually eat much salt so that could be the reason why, but ive been to many other chinese restaurants and their food was never as salty. For some reason despite it being a little too salty for me, I couldnt put the fork down. Its not the best chinese food ive had but still good enough for me to keep eating it (weird right??) The salt & pepper fish was good and the chicken fried rice was VERY good. This is a good place to grab a quick inexpensive bite and I think I might give it another shot to see if the food got better. 3 out of 5 stars for great customer service, good fried rice and fish, and OKAY mongolian and kung pao chicken. The restaurant itself could have been a little cleaner.", "author": "Vince N."}

The Shanghai Dumplings came out first - they were very course, comparable to what you'd find in low quality package from the frozen section in a Chinese supermarket. The dumplings came out cold, the dumpling wrapping was way too thick, the pork stuffing was sub-par, and there was no need for a spoon since all the juice already spilled before the dumplings were touched.\n\nIn addition to the Kung Pao Chicken, we ordered a Bok Choi / Mushroom dish, and the Sliced Fish in Garlic Ginger Sauce (chinese name \"Yu Xian Yu\"). Overall the dishes all tasted fairly similar (consistently soy sauce flavor) and overly greasy.\n\nCommunication was not much of an issue with the waitress because my friend and I speak Chinese. I also noticed that my chopsticks were a tad sticky before I used it so I asked for another pair and that one was equally sticky (so I just sucked it up and wiped it down).\n\nOverall I was quite unimpressed with this place that is rated 4 solid stars, but my hunch is that people are swayed by the cheap price.

I am not lying, more than one hour! When the food came was so subpar compared to just about any other Chinese restaurant in the city except for panda express that it is something my wife said I had to let people know about. The rice was OK and we can't give less than one star so I'll give them one star for the rice. 1970s I'm beyond, and restaurant owners seem to be just sleepy that day, the young kid that was helping was pretty confused, and that place is a place that needs to be repurposed for something else or taken over by someone else.", "author": "Tim H."}

We came for dinner... not my preference but the person I was with was craving \"Americanized\" chinese food. Our usual place, Tai Chi on Polk, was closed.  Yan's was close by and had good reviews - couldn't hurt, right?\n\nWe ordered the dinner combos that came with soup, egg roll, 2 entrees, rice. Soup was hot and sour soup, nothing special but nothing horrible.  Not much flavor so I covered it with white pepper. From there, it was all down hill. \n\nLet's discuss the egg rolls. They were practically brown and no, that doesn't mean they were overfried, it means they were fried in non-fresh oil.  Like oil that's been sitting around all day, possibly multiple days.  Filling was meh.  But I love my sweet and sour sauce poured all over my egg rolls so I figured I'd drown the dark brown skin of the egg roll in sauce.  We asked for sauce which came in a red ketchup bottle.  As soon as I poured out the sauce all over my egg roll, I instantly regretted my enthusiasm.  It was HOT PINK. Like highlighter pink.  It was disgusting.  No wonder it was in some red ketchup bottle.  We were both horrified.  What was this Red No. 3 + sugar, lemon juice, and corn starch?  Come on, it's not that hard to make your own sweet and sour sauce.\n\nThen came the food.  Ugh, it tasted like old grease.  We ordered the general tsao's chicken and I think Mongolian chicken? I don't remember but it was completely not memorable.  The General Tso's chicken had meat chunks that consisted of 75% batter, 25% dry crappy meat.  And remember that \"non-fresh oil\" I discussed above?  That was obviously used to deep fry all the meat chunks so everything just tasted like bad grease.  I had to stop after a few bites.  Usually, I love drowning my rice in whatever sticky sauce the food comes in.  Couldn't do that either. Why? The rice was day old and also really bad.\n\nYelp, I'm disappointed in your judgment.  I contemplated trying it again for lunch but frankly, that highlighter pink sauce was a HUGE turn-off.  Never coming back. Ever.", "author": "Joanne L."}

I came for lunch and sat down at a half-eaten termite table that was wedged into the corner where one of the chairs was obstructed by some pipe. The menus prices were \"updated\" with some illegible scribbled over numbers in crayon. \n\nSo I went with something very simple - beef noodle soup and pot stickers. What arrived at the table was this bowl of chef boyardee-like noodles heated up with some sort of canned carrots and peas. Forget the canned part, what beef noodle soup place do you know services this bowl with carrots and peas? The beef was unbearable. It was near inedible - chewy...and not the tender chewy but more like the chewy that relates to meat that has been associated with the side of a carcass and frozen for decades, only to finally be thawed when an unsuspecting customer who finds a \"hidden gem\" four-star yelp review enters their establishment for the first time. \n\nOh, the pot stickers were sub-par but would not have been so bad if there were not fried over 3 times with gritty bits of cancer causing agents from the old pots.", "author": "Michael B."}

I have also tried the wonton soup, Mongolian beef, and fried fish that are good as well, but not my favorites. \n\nOne dish to avoid though is the shanghainese dumplings. They were dry, the skin was thick, and there was no soup inside. \n\nWhen dining in, the service can be pretty slow at times if they're busy.

By far, Yan's general Tso's chicken is the best I had! It's crisp, flavorful and not greasy. I have to say awesome price, good ingredients and phenomenal taste. I don't necessarily believe that expensive establishments offer better food because you simply pay for good ingredients and other stuffs to make you feel like you are having a good meal. In other words if basic ingredients are good, then the food has to be good. I cant really tell if a chef has skill to impress if he/she is given top quality ingredients. My belief is that a good chef should be able to bring out good food even with limited resources. \n\nI know Yan's is not a place where you want to have a fancy date at. It's an establishment that is being run by a couple, who are extremely nice btw.\n\n Hell- a restaurant should have good food and food should be their focus not other stuffs. \n\nLike I said before Yan's do offer awesome taste, good quality and good price and do deserve five stars.

They once again said \"Alvin, find something to eat, and it better be good!\" We were out on broadway and a friend suggested New Sun Hong Kong, but I knew I could find something better. Then we came across this diamond in the rough.\n\nOnly several blocks from broadway and columbus, we came across Yan's kitchen, which even had the \"People on Yelp Love Us\" sticker, so I knew it was legit. All the dishes were awesomely priced. We got some wonton soup to warm us up. Then got some eggplant shrimp, mongolian beef, chicken chowfun, bbq pork fried rice and General Tso's chicken. All the dishes were awesome! Not too much of certain things, ie salty, oil, etc. Super yummy after a day of walking and drinking. We left with these words from my friend Hubert : \"That General Tso probably lost every battle, but they kept him in office because his chicken is just too amazing. Genghis Khan and his mongolian beef had better retreat if he squares off with the General!\"", "author": "Alvin P."}

For my first visit I tried, on the recommendation of Yelper's, as well as the dish being my typical favorite, the General Tso's chicken.\nI ordered the rice plate, which was available with rice. Along with the complimentary hot and sour soup that was quite good, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. \nThe chicken was sweet, a little tangy, with a small afterburn. So, for under $7 the serving was surprisingly large as well, always a pleasant surprise for trash disposal stomachs like mine.\n\nMy favorite thing about Yan's is that it's Americanized Chinese cuisine, which I genuinely like. While the authenticity of nearby China town is great, Yan's is the kind of food I grew up on. I'll be back. Maybe tomorrow. And the day after.", "author": "Muz H."}

We were looking for a place in San Francisco where we could get General Tso Chicken that was actually spicy. My husband and I each ordered the General Tso for lunch. It was reasonably priced and it came with pot stickers or spring rolls before the main meal. The chicken was actually spicy unlike most we've had which are just sweet. It wasn't overly spicy though where you couldn't eat it. I think the best part about this meal though was how it was cooked. It was cooked to perfection. The chicken seemed to be quality, the breeding was crispy and fried perfectly. While we were there I told my husband that I don't know if I'll be able to get Chinese food at home again because I will always be disappointed that it didn't live up to Yan's Kitchen. My only complaint is that the service was kind of slow. But I think that was because they only have one cook and everything was made fresh to order.

So far the ratings and descriptions have been pretty on point, but not today. We are currently on a small vacation in San Francisco, up from L.A., and decided to grab some cheap Chinese food for lunch while in Chinatown. So we yelped...\n\nWe ordered two lunch specials: The Mongolian style Chicken and an Orange Chicken plate, both with fried rice.\n\nThe Mongolian Chicken was way too salty and made with cheap yellow onion instead of green onion like normal. The flavor was to strong and not very good.\n\nThe Orange Chicken was more fried batter than chicken, no joke. It was maybe about 30% meat with the rest being deep fried batter. The orange sauce was also not very good, kind of sugary.\n\nThe fried rice was the worst part: It was partially reheated clumps of cold white rice halfheartedly tossed with soy sauce, not fried, but warmed up. We were biting into cold clumps of rice where the soy sauce didn't make it.\n\nThe dining area was just terrible. When we walked in, half the tables were dirty with used cups and plates. We figured they would be picked up by the time we left but they were not, even though no one else was in the restaurant eating. The floor was dirty, the walls were dusty, the bottles of spices were sticky and coagulated in a way that made us feel like they had NEVER been cleaned. When we sat, the table was dirty and the older woman wiped it down with a mildewy towel, leaving a nasty smell until it dried . We don't really mind a lack of imaginative decor, especially when looking for a budget meal, but hygiene is a must. Also, there are no restrooms available. Despite seeing all of this walking in, we stayed because the yelp score was 4 stars and WE LOVE Mom and Pops spots...\n\nThere goes $22, and opportunity to enjoy good eats, way misspent, and heartburn for the rest of the evening...\n\nSo I ask again: Why do people keep giving this place 4 and 5 stars?!?!?", "author": "Danny C."}

The brown rice and quality of food is 5 star quality! I even think I tasted coconut oil in it (Coconut oil is one of the best - if not the best - cooking oil one can use). No signs of MSG at all. Their character speaks volumes in the quality, portions and pricing; OUTSTANDING! They also have extra virgin olive oil in one of the broccoli dishes but they are kind people, so I know they can add it into another dish if you prefer it. The serving portions are HUGE and they don't skimp you on the chicken/beef/proteins AT ALL and they only charge 7.50 or less for these entrees and 1.75 for the brown rice. Words will not do this place justice, this is by far the best restaurant food I have had in San Francisco and they stayed open for people even after 9:30 (closing for them), I'd say until at least 10:30 not denying anyone; gentle souls. I was thinking of ordering a second entree with broccoli and the kind woman said it's okay you'll have plenty of broccoli with your chicken and broccoli order, so you don't have to order a second one if you don't prefer to; PURE HUMILITY! They sincerely enjoy serving the people, so ethical... you can tell by the ingredients and standard of cooking. I hope we can help this beautiful husband and wife out as they are of exceptional character. The interior could use some work, but their presence more than makes up for it with the pricing and huge portion sizes and the quality is amazing too. Coconut oil/extra virgin olive oil and I received two big servings of brown rice and chicken broccoli for under 10 dollars.  I cannot say enough kind words of this place.

I can usually trust Yelp but was definitely disappointed this time.\n\nNow - let me preface this by saying that the owners seem very sweet and hardworking and this, in no way, is a slam against them.  But the food itself is not 4 or 5 star quality like many of the Yelpers claim.\n\nMy husband and I wanted a quick dinner last night and were in the area so we looked on Yelp to find an inexpensive Chinese place that had high ratings.  Maybe we should have known to go elsewhere because it was completely empty at  7:30pm on a Friday night (on Columbus St).  True many Chinese places do more business in take-out but I didn't hear a lot of calls coming in and didn't see take-out orders ready while we were there.\n\nLong story short, the prices are really low.  I guess you can say you get what you pay for.  Ambiance was def lacking - not that we expected much.  We are very down to earth and really don't require much when we're grabbing a quick low-cost dinner.  The condiment containers on the table looked like they hadn't been cleaned or refilled in a really long time.  The sweet and sour sauce for the spring rolls was served in a plastic ketchup bottle coated in stickiness and the contents looked like melted strawberry candy... a really light pink sugary liquid.  Not like any sweet and sour sauce I've experienced.  I ordered hot tea and it was served to me in a small plastic water cup.  Never seen that before and I can tell you that drinking hot liquid out of plastic just feels wrong.  We weren't given or offered water.  We were each given one paper napkin and one fork.  Chopsticks weren't available (maybe she just didn't give them to us).  \n\nWe ordered the pot stickers & spring rolls for starters.  Flavors were pretty bland on both items.  For entrees we had the bbq pork fried rice and chicken in garlic ginger sauce.  The chicken dish was probably the best of all 4 items but it was still just mediocre.  Panda Express would be better.  The worst thing was the fried rice.  It really didn't have much flavor.  My husband, who has a very forgiving palate and will eat almost anything, said it had a flavor reminiscent of \"wet dog.\" Sad because I typically love fried rice and will usually finish it off or at least take the leftovers home for later.  We left at least 1/3 of the rice on the serving plate.\n\nMaybe this is more of a financial district quick lunch spot... seems like they'd be better for that kind of service and that people eating a cheap lunch have lower expectations.  Not sure but I can say it's definitely on the lower end of Chinese food experiences I've had and I've eaten Chinese food my entire life at least once a month.", "author": "Alisa M."}

It is very hard to finish the rice plate lunch specials (price range $4-6)....soooooo cheap and sooo good. May, the waitress, is very nice and some how manages to serve everyone for their packed lunch service. \n\nGet the general Tao's chicken rice plate. Its crispy, tangy and spicy with cuts of carrots and jalapenos. YUM! \n\nAlso I suggest calling in your order and eating at the place, because you don't get the soup of the day or tea to go. Calling in helps for me to try and fit in lunch in my crammed 30 minute allotment. Also you get a choice of rolls or dumplings for starter - get the dumpling.", "author": "Brandon E."}

While the atmosphere isn't nice, the two owners are very friendly, hardworking people who create some delicious food! I regularly grab take-out (they only take the dish off the burner once you arrive to ensure your food is hot) and occasionally sit down to eat. Don't go in expecting great service (there's only two people there and they both cook) or a fancy table (to be honest, it's a bit dirty in there).

The pot stickers were tasteless served without sauce other than the standards on the table.

I had heard great things about the General Tso here, so that is what I ordered.  I can see where the excitement comes from, as the sauce was really top notch.  One complaint I would have is that the chicken pieces inside the breading were quite small, so you could say there was a high breading to chicken ratio.  Also, the portion size with this dish wasn't as huge as I generally expect from Chinese, and I felt a bit hungry after eating, which is rarely the case with Chinese food.  The person I ate with got a vegetarian tofu dish that was definitely over average and flavorful, and the portion size was more generous.  Yan's kitchen has brown rice as well, which is a nice addition if you are looking to eat more healthy. Overall this is a good destination, and the price is right.", "author": "Kevin M."}

First impression is worry since no one Chinese- looking is in there - not a promising sign.  Then I look at the menu - immediately I know the type of Chinese food it is but I trudge on and am a good sport.  We order the mushu pork and bok choy/mushroom dish.  Visibly, dishes don't look right but still open-minded, I try them.....Holy Crapola, how the hell can this place have an averaged rating of anything but the worst available? W-H-A-T are you Yelpers talking about with these high ratings?!! This is SanFran afterall - averaged out, you all should have distinguishing palates. Both of our dishes were utterly abhorrent.  If I took my Chinese mom here, she'd consider disowning me.  I couldn't muster the fortitude to eat much of it.  \n\nDespite the friendly couple who I assume owns this place (pains me to ding them like this but truth must prevail), I cannot be kind or generous in this review because it is blasphemous to call this Chinese food.  People, it is horrible, horrendous, shameful to label this Chinese food.  \n\nOur bill was $17 plus $4 tip so yes, true it's dirty, dirt cheap but it's cheap that you get, believe me.  The pork in the mushu \"pork\", rather meat-like substance of questionable consistency, tasted like it was mostly gristle and fat.  The mushroom dish had that annoying overly corn-starched gravy.  I felt reluctant to review the place because the older Chinese lady who owns this place (I think) was nice and I was brought up to respect my elderly but ultimately, I felt compelled to do my part to right this ship after we both had the sh*ts the next morning (sorry, TMI but need to offer rationale).

To quote the announcer from Quake 3 Arena, \"IMPRESSIVE.\"\n\nWhile they have your typical selection of Chinese food, one thing that stood out was the Mushu Chicken.  Now the flavor was generally good, but the rice tortillas were very high quality.  I have had Mushu-this many other places and one of the biggest problems is that the tortillas tend to crack after they have oxidized for a few minutes or when you load the ingredients they crack, and that was not the case here.  They sat on the plate for several minutes while my daughter attempted to make as much noise as possible in the metal high chair that was provided.  Each tortilla had the same soft texture and didn't break.  The hot and sour soup was good.  The drink selection was good too, not just water and tea, but several types of soda (in a can), beer and of course anyone who stocks Raspberry tea (Snapple) automatically gets a minimum of two stars even if the food is awful.  \n\nThey do have a Yelp sticker on their door AND best of all they seem to know about it, unlike some other restaurants I have been to.

It was way beyond my expectation. \n\nThe food itself was great. Hot and sour soup delicious and definitely hits the spot (Tai Chi is the only place where I've had decent hot n' sour soup). The pork dish with eggplant and tofu was recommended to me over the Ma Pao tofu, and it was absolutely delicious. Soft eggplants, flavorful tofu (I hate it when the sauce isn't cook through), delicious sauce with just the right amount of heat but not too thick with corn starch like most Chinese restaurants in the area. \n\nThe couple that own that place were just the nicest, smilest people. I think they felt bad for me and definitely gave me a little bit extra food and just the getlest smile and greetings despite our language barriers (I can't speak Cantonese, they can barely do Mandarin). \n\nLove love love this place.

In regards to Yan's kitchen... the restaurant has a chinese name, the cooks are chinese, even the waitress can't speak english well, but oddly enough the food ain't all that chinese. I guess I shouldn't be too shocked since in past reviews some people refer to the food as americanized chinese. I for one am a big fan of panda express so I have no hate for fake chinese. It can be f-ing delicious in its own right. Even my mom a legit 100% taiwanese woman loves panda.  \n\nNot quite sure how to exactly feel about this place. There were a couple odd balls thrown at me. The restaurant itself is not bad for a hole in the wall. The tables weren't sticky, which is the standard I measure for chinese hole in the walls. As long as the table is not sticky and there are no cockroaches running around or in my food I can bear it. \n\nCame for lunch with a friend on a workday. I ordered off the lunch special menu. Got pork cooked with egg over fried rice which comes with sweet and sour soup and 2 dumplings. My friend ordered shrimp chowfun. The soup was decent and my dish was satisfactory in portion and taste. I love my pork and egg over rice so I was perfectly content. My friend's dish on the other hand was cooked in a gallon of oil. By no means am I scared of a generous dose of oil but the noodles were lightly wadding in a pool of it. Funny thing is she managed to finish most of the noodles, but mentally she was not for the better. At the end of the meal I noticed they had not served me the dumpling appetizer and I requested it. Out came these 2 massively fried and battered dumplings. It was incredibly odd and not appetizing. I HAVE been to countless chinese places in my life time and not one has ever battered and deep fried their dumplings. It is most common to pan fry them. Funny thing being the beast I am I ate them anyways. The filling was ok, but the batter was gross and I peeled off what I could.\n\nLike I said earlier I really don't know how to feel about this place. The portion you get for the price you pay is generous. I have yet to try any of the other dishes so I don't want to completely rule it out. I take it if you order the americanized dishes like General's chicken it might be a better experience. My pork and rice dish I would actually order and eat again happily.  Come not expecting the world of this place. It's not authentic by any means, but it's cheap and filling. A man can not ask for any more.", "author": "Jack C."}

The coating was just shatteringly good and crunchy and the sauce was great!!!! Definitely gonna get that A la Carte sweet and sour next time!!! The Thai tea was ok must not be a big fan. The bill was so surprisingly cheap I tipped 30%. This place is so great that I even ignored the sticky condiment jar of hot chili oil. Hahaha!!! Just go!!! it's wonderful, fresh, cheerful, and cheap!!!", "author": "Carolynn S."}

This place is a good value, no surprises (the food is your typical Americanized Chinese fare) and reasonably priced. One small hitch was that my companion ordered red wine, and the waitress (who I believe was also the proprietor) gave her a glass of sherry! I haven't tried this place for take-out yet, but am planning on doing so.", "author": "Katrina K."}

I tried it based on the other yelp reviews, and I wanted to like it. I really did.  The owners seemed nice.  Maybe they were having a bad day.  I ordered General Tso's chicken.  The sauce was tasty but the chicken was barely noticeable in the over abundance of breading which was over fried to the point it was dark brown/black and completely inedible.  I ate two pieces and gave up.   I did eat the fried dumplings which were overdone - but I didn't have much of a choice.  I was so hungry.  I thought the overcooking was just me, but the next table had the same problem with a similar dish.  My colleague's lunch was OK - Kung Pao Chicken, which was saut\u00e9ed.  Service was very slow due to only one lady waiting tables. To be fair, she was going as fast as possible.  I'm now working on a pretty bad stomach ache, which hopefully will be gone by dinner.  Ugh.  Serious lunch bummer.", "author": "Kat M."}

This is a small place but friendly and perfect for me since I was alone.  I ordered a small Hot and Sour soup which was good and LOADED with ingredients; a large bowl would have made a meal!  I also ordered the Salt and Pepper beef which is a dish I had never had before but it sounded good. Now, I am not a fan of the deep fried chinese dishes like Gen Tso's and Orange chick so, to my dismay, the salt/pepper beef turned out to be deep fried!  It was my fault for not knowing but I ate it anyway since I was hungry.  I would not order it again because of the health aspect of deep fried food, however, the rice and veggies with it were good and it had lots of yummy fried garlic pieces.  One customer near me had a dish of Curry Vegetables which looked great and another couple had a dish of Vegetables with Noodles and also a dish of non-fried beef that also looked good.  I would return but next time will try healthier items. Soup, entree with rice, and a Fat Tire beer was $15.75", "author": "Jmarc P."}

Disappointing.  \n\nI was in SF for two days and getting randomly fantastic Chinese food was part of the plan.  After several false starts, found this place.  I always trust such a high yelp, but man oh man.  \n\nI'll grant that the portions were large and I liked the little fried greasy things.  That's the only nice stuff I can say.  The cup of ice for my soda had something unappealing floating in it and microbugs crawled across the table.  The soup was warm water with beans in it.  The string bean chicken was nearly inedibly salty (and I like salt more than anyone I know).  The Mongolian chicken was just a pile of pressed boring blah with pepper flakes sprinkled on.  \n\nThis is the kind of \"Chinese\" food you get at a Best Western restaurant in Utah.  I'd take gross freaking Panda Express over this any day.", "author": "Brian C."}

I guess that's Yan in the kitchen, he's always smiling and the woman is always bustling about.  The menu is very no-frills.  It's not the best Chinese food in the world - but it's not the greasiest or the worst.   I've always left pleased and satisfied with what I got for what I paid and have never gotten a belly ache or anything.  In fact, I used to have to go here regularly for their yummy egg drop soup - which was about the only thing I could eat when I was really sick last year with a tropical stomach bug.  They were so nice and would just ask me if I wanted the soup when I walked in - I eventually moved on to the simple, but yummy, chicken and veggies rice plate.  I can now, thankfully, enjoy the full array of their  menu.\n\nTheir lunch specials are a fantastic deal.  I work half a block away and go here at least once a week.  I like it because the portions are huge, and leave me enough to take away to either eat for dinner or for lunch the next day - which is not bad at all for $6.  The daily soup which comes with the lunch special is always different and very tasty.  I will say that the egg rolls are rather greasy - but I've learned to just roll them in an extra napkin first before eating them.\n\nThey can be a bit slow and swamped during the lunch rush, but it looks like they've hired another women to work in the kitchen during this time.  This has appeared to help them out a lot.  Getting food for take-out is alright too, but I prefer to eat in so that you get the soup and egg rolls (and hot tea in silly plastic cups).  Sometimes I get the same thing I always get.  Sometimes, I'll get something new.  Either way, I'm usually pleased.\n\nOverall, I like to support this place and it makes me happy to get good, simple honest food.  Be sure to tip the woman extra - the food is so cheap, so 15% of $5 doesn't do justice to the quality and warmth of the service.", "author": "Miscia B."}

I was in the mood for chicken with ginger and scallions and it was different from what I usually get in a really good way. Like they added their own twist. I was a little afraid of getting an MSG hangover in the afternoon, but it never came on, so maybe they do not use it. I will ask next time. The owners are very kind. The place was really clean. I felt comfortable and good about patronizing the place. I would like to tell them to raise their prices, because it seems a little strange that you would pay more for a cold sandwich than a huge and really delicious hot meal at Yan's. I have always thought it unfair that we expect Chinese food to be super cheap, under 10 bucks for a entree, while we pay $25 for an entree of a piece of protein, veg and starch at a European restaurant. Granted the surroundings are part of what we pay for, but there are fairly strong societal prejudices invloved here that are associated with worth of European culture versus others.", "author": "Michael K."}
