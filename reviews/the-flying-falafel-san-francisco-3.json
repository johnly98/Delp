I order the plate me a falafel or the flying falafel pocket and never miss their cinnamon baklava. The price is cheap for the quantity they give. If I want varities I go for the triple deluxe with shawarma, falafel and crispy chick's all in one for only $9.50 (What!?)\n\nTheir pitas are freshly made, soft and fluffy inside out. Their falafels are also fresh and are delightful balls of goodness.\n\nThey tend to get pretty packed and busy. You can always place an order via the Yelp app and just go pick it up. The only downside is that they are on the streets and you might have to park somewhere else and walk to the restaurant. There are a couple of tables outside, but I'd rather take it out and eat at home than sit on the streets of the city to enjoy the fresh food. Love this place and will definitely go back again.", "author": "Shivani R."}

It was like eating crispy chicken out of a kangaroo pouch. Except you eat the kangaroo pouch too. \n\nIt's a hole in the wall and there is no seating. Like a kangaroo pouch. Great for late night food for late night working, but note that it closes at 8:30pm so it's not really a late night snack unless you get it to go. Speaking of which, you should not get it to go because it will get cold. It tastes better warm... I think... I've never had it while it's warm, but I imagine it would have been better. \n\nTaste: It tastes great even when it's cold. 52/54 would recommend.\n\nPS. I would exclude the carrots.

There is a small counter with 4 stools outsides but no indoor area. Since there was a open seat I chose to eat outside, but I would not recommend this when the weather becomes colder. I stopped by for lunch and they were not busy at the time. I ordered the Spicy Falafel Pita Pocket and most of the veggie toppings. They do have several sauces that go on the sandwich but their descriptions were not listed. The sandwich was prepared very quickly and wrapped nicely. However, the sandwich tasted okay, I felt as if it was lacking some flavor and the veggies and falafel could have been mixed together to have a equal flavoring with each bite. It also could have been more spicy. I was also disappointed because my pita, falafels and the fries inside the sandwich were lukewarm. The fries were seasoned well. On the other hand, the portions were plentiful and the pita bread was soft. \n\nOverall, I would come back but I would request that my food be hot next time.", "author": "Dave S."}

It's a little easy to miss, so keep your eyes open! It's designed to be one of those grab and go kind of places. They do have one table outside with four stools, so if you're lucky, you can probably eat and sit. \n\nStaff & Service: Friendly, funny, and fast! I can tell this place can get pretty busy, because there were a few people waiting in line and waiting outside, but this one/two man band will get your order out quick!\n\nFood: Mouthwatering! Flying with flavor! Helllllllllla goooood! Portions are decent enough to share. Unless you want to be selfish, then go 'head. I ordered the Super Combo #1 - Pocket & a side of fries. The Pocket was packed with goodness and did not lack any \"meat\" (note: this is a vegetarian place), it was not massed with vegetables, or was it too saucy. The falafel balls inside the pocket was THEEE cherry on top for this meal. I think it was supposed to be spicy but I could not really tell. I did not even mind it though because I was too busy enjoying my lunch. The pita bread was soft and fresh, and it was strong enough to hold the contents.

A block away from the Civic Center BART station and a bit hidden along Market St, The Flying Falafel is a solid choice for quick and tasty Mediterranean food.\n\nYou may *think* there's a line to order when you first show up, but it's actually probably just hungry customers waiting for their (FLYing) falafel --- the employees are quick at taking orders.\n\nI got the spicy falafel pocket -- around 5 or 6 spicy falafel balls stuffed into half a slice of pita bread, hella veggies, some hummus, and topped with french fries. I waited for around 7 minutes while the cooks threw out a few more orders before mine. They called me to the counter, and stuffed the pita with falafel and veggies in front of me, which I appreciated. \n\nThere's a raised table with 4 seats right outside, but I took back my pocket to the office because I didn't want to sit in the cold and the to-go bag didn't come with napkins.\n\nI enjoyed the spicy falafel pita pocket! I ate all the fries first because they were pretty much falling out and I didn't wanna risk dropping one. The pocket is tasty, though the falafel weren't as spicy as I had hoped and the pita bread was sticking to the wrapper. It's tasty and filling for under $9, and decently healthy to boot.

Hummus is creamy. Vegetables fresh. And the pita is also fresh/soft/freakin delicious. They have another location in Berkeley too.

It is quite extraordinary. But what's even more extraordinary is that this restaurant actually gives a decent amount of falafel for the price. Often times I order the falafel at other restaurants, and to my dismay, I receive only a couple falafel. But here? I can stuff my cheeks like a chipmunk, juggle a dozen, and play 8 games of simultaneous hacky sack all at the same time with the amount of falafel they give.\n\nIt simply cannot be beat.

I finally had a chance to try it today and just wow, it is worth every penny. I read a lot of reviews regarding the lines and opted to order online for pickup. Lo and behold, my order was not ready when I got there, but I typically expect this for pick ups and it didn't really bother me that much. \n\nI was really curious about their menu item, the cripsy chick'n pocket, but opted to go with the flying falafel pocket sandwich since it was my first time. You can get a half pocket ($5.50 without tax) or a full pocket ($7.70 without tax). I went with the full pocket and it was insanely filling to the point where I will most likely skip dinner. It had a healthy serving of falafels, cucumbers, cilantro, pickles, tomato, lettuce, and 3 different sauces including a spicy one. It is topped off with a few fries. Fry obsessed me was thrilled by that. Tfalafels themselves were incredibly flavorful and easily carried the whole dish. The sauces were good, but I wish there had been a little bit more of the spicy one. The fries were just so so for me, but eh the place is called Flying Falafel, not Flying Fries so I was just happy to have delicious falafels.\n\nTypically, the flying falafel pocket sandwich comes wrapped in some paper. I requested a box and was informed that they don't usually give a box with the pocket sandwich, but that I could have one just this once. I really appreciated that they were able to accommodate my request because I deinfitely would have made a mess trying to eat it on public transit without a box. I'll keep this in mind and just get the plated version next time.\n\nOverall, this place is a solid food option. The location is small and unassuming and only has a tiny 4 seater table outside but the food is hearty, filling, and delicious, especially for the price.", "author": "Lakshmi M."}

I really liked it because it wasn't doused in olive oil, but it didn't taste super fresh either. \n+1 LOTSA vegetables! Seriously, just get everything. This comes with carrots, diced pickles, tomatoes, some type of white radish, and lots of cabbage. \n+1 Falafels were not bad! I've had better, but at least these were not bursting with oil and had the perfect crunch. \n+1 Hot pita bread was YUM!

The space is super small and only offers some outdoor seating (which isn't much of a perk given the location), so it's best to take the food to go. \n\nTheir falafel is seriously A+. It's always hot and crispy, never greasy. They offer a pita pocket in two sizes (small or large), and it's stuffed with fantastic veggies, sauces and fries on top! You can also get a plate, which is more or less a deconstructed pita pocket. They offer a few sides, such a dolmas, hummus, and baklava, but really the falafel is the star of the show. \n\nA pro tip for people who are taking the pocket to go: ask for less sauce because it can make the bottom of the pita pretty soggy and things can start to fall apart from there. \n\nThe staff there are always super friendly, and sometimes they'll even entertain you by flipping falafel into the air and catching them in the pita. This is a quick, healthy and cheap place for lunch or dinner.", "author": "Regina L."}

Was I interested in trying out a local eatery? ... Absolutely!\n\nThe Flying Falafel got really good reviews on Yelp, so we figured we would get one of the falafel pockets while we were on the go in San Francisco. It was busy when we got there, so it took some time for us to get our order even though it seemed like they were continuously making the falafel balls. There was only one person working, and we didn't mind the wait, especially since we were satisfied when we tried out our food!\n\nWe had ordered the falafel pocket with everything on it which included tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, pickles, lettuce, tzatziki, and some french fries on top. I asked if they could make it only a little bit spicy so a small dash of sriracha was included as well.\n\nOverall, we thought that the pocket was full and flavorful. The falafel balls themselves were crispy on the outside but soft and tasty on the inside. The veggies inside added extra crunch and an additional layer of flavor. My only comment is that everything ended up being weighed down and partially soggy because of the runny yogurt sauce. If I had to order again, I'd probably ask for the pocket to be made spicy since the bites that had spice were more flavorful than the ones without spice.\n\nOverall, I think this place was worth a try. There's really not much seating around but I would plan on eating the falafel pocket as soon as it comes out!", "author": "Rashmi G."}

The shop is small, the guys at the front are friendly, food comes out quick. \n\nI got a spicy pocket and the side salad. The spicy pocket was good, good portion sizing and the veggies in the pocket worked well with all the sauces. I'd say my one thing with it is that with them stored in the plastic bins, there's lots of water runoff. This can make the pocket semi soggy. Best to eat it as soon as possible in this case. The side salad was just a box with all the veggies that normally go into a pocket covered in sauce. I'd probably have been better off getting either more falafel or fries or something just to switch up the flavor. \n\nAll in all, it was good but I'd have to switch how I eat it and what I order. Can't take it back to the office since it just isn't as good as when it first came out due to the issues I mentioned. If the veggies could be drained, a lot of it would be solved. I probably wouldn't order another salad again though since the next time I'm here I would totally get another pocket.", "author": "David C."}

So, Flying Falafel requires commitment. Pro tip: order online ahead of time, and you skip the ordering line & only have to wait in that \"pick up your food\" line. Huge difference. \n\nA good falafel, plated or in a pita, is a thing of beauty. One of the best I've had was in Le Marais neighborhood of Paris, where there's one legit falafel hut that people travel from around the world to patronize. Flying Falafel had a similar hole-in-the-wall vibe, but the goods weren't made with as much thoughtfulness as the Parisian version. Watching them \"assemble\" (or, more literally, throw together) our dishes was chaotic. Vegetables flying, condiments being squirted across the counter, falafel balls being plopped agressively into pitas. It was all a bit stressful, actually. I thought: how could something so haphazardly put together be worthy of such hype? Would it even taste good? And that extra sauce I asked for, did anyone pay attention to that?\n\nIn the end, our falafel plates were tasty, but I felt the sauce to veggie ratio was way off. There was a big pile of cabbage and carrots that just didn't get eaten because there wasn't enough condiments to go 'round. The falafel balls were nice and crispy though, so that counts for something. And the pita - noticeably soft and warm. \n\nCompared to Liba Falafel in Oakland, with their impressive salad & sauce bar, Flying Falafel was just okay. Probably more authentic, but just came across as basic to my tastebuds.", "author": "Nique F."}

The food is great and the guys behind the counter are friendly and will occasionally throw falafels in the air as a spectacle for you. \n\nHere's my opinion of everything so far:\n\n-Sesame Falafel Pita Pocket: We asked for a bit of spicy sauce, so he obliged. Very filling with quality, flavorful ingredients. The star of the show here are the falafels, but everything else accentuates the flavors well. I prefer the veggies because it cuts the saltiness and makes it taste fresher. The spicy sauce has a zing with the spice so I prefer the sesame sauce for its mildness. Fries add a nice touch, kind of reminds me of McDonald's fries.\n\n-Falafel & Hummus Plate: HUGE dollop of hummus topped with falafels, veggie piles, and sauce. They serve you a side of pita, but I recommend ordering a whole pita too (especially if you love bread). The pita itself is pillowy soft and delicious with their hummus and you're definitely gonna need more pita to handle all of the hummus they give you.\n\n-Cinnamon Baklava: Very flaky and buttery, but would have preferred it at room temperature than refrigerated. \n\nOverall, a delicious experience!

I typically go for the spice, because who doesn't like a little kick with their lunchtime chow.\n\nDid I mention that they have a \"rewards\" program? Grab a card and collect stamps to get a free pita pocket (they usually give you a couple extra stamps just to get you started, too).\n\nThere is very limited seating outside this storefront, so definitely a grab-and-go type of place. Falafel is cooked very fresh (made-to-order). You can go wrong with falafel but these guys do everything right!", "author": "Tracy T."}

It's that small of a place.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came on a Sunday evening. Yelp said it was closed but it really wasn't. As we walked in to check the menu, the sole falafel guy tending to the place tossed us falafel balls to munch on. He tossed another customer a pita bread fragment as he was working on a pita pocket. The menu is short and sweet. You can't go wrong with the falafel pita pocket for $7. Spicy or sesame, both are great. If the guy is busy, you can order and pay on the tablet yourself.\n\nFalafel Pocket -- The falafel balls, sauces, and veggies are packed into the pita pocket in repeating layers so you get a bit of every ingredient spread throughout your pocket (unlike a burrito, where you often have areas where there's just hella beans or rice or a massive glob of sour cream). This place seriously packs their falafel pockets. Take a fork and napkins with you as you stand or walk around outside to eat; it can be messy.", "author": "Liana F."}

I went for a Snacker, which is a half portion of a falafel that costs just under a full order. It's silly, I know, but I'm watching my figure.*\n\nThe nice dudes behind the counter will offer you several types of sauces (hot, tangy, tahini), and layer in your falafel, hummus, and all the veggies with care. I really, truly appreciate how my guy took the time to sauce the pita before and after he loaded it up, ensuring good bites throughout the meal.

The setup is a bit confusing since you order and pay on the right line and then get in the left line to dictate your toppings once your name is called.  Also, the only drink they sell is a banana milkshake so you'll need to stop by the smoke shop nearby to get a soda if you want.  Not much space to eat it; only one measly table with one chair.  But could totally loiter nearby and have at it standing with the pita in one hand and your drink in another (...but good luck if you also want to take a photo of your falafel).\n\nSpicy Falafel Sandwich: Two layers of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside falafels; a bunch on the bottom before the filling starts and some more on top of all the veggie filling.  The spicy falafel didn't feel particularly spicy.  The pita was thicker than store bought and quite fluffy.  So many veggies and sauces added when you ask for everything.  In aggregate, all that filling helped contrast the deep fried carbs with freshness and tanginess.  Pretty solid falafel offering.", "author": "Adam B."}

My recommendation is to get the falafel plate. You'll get a delicious mix of fresh veggies and some darn fine falafels and some magical spicy/mayo sauces.\n\nThe Service: These guys are so darn fast but you'll still wait in line forever due to their popularity.\n\nThe Establishment: Remember, there is no seating and no roof for you so this place is take-out only.\n\nConclusions: With decent pricing and an amazing flavor composition, the plates and pita pockets here are some of the best examples of vegetarian food I've ever had.", "author": "Andrew H."}

Its a fluffier thicker pita bread then you usually see around, and they warm them up before packing it with the falafels and toppings. It knocks lavash bread out of the park! like you're biting into a cloud, but it has falafels and awesome toppings in it. \n\nThey had just about all the toppings you could want, hummus, tomatoes, carrots, hot sauce, cilantro sauce.. so many i lost count.

Catch!\" As I looked up, the owner of the shop tossed a falafel ball at me and then quickly followed it with a piece of pita. This repeated itself for just about every other passerby within throwing distance and resulted in at least a few pieces ending up on the ground around us. The enthusiasm and charisma of the owner made you feel so welcome and comfortable despite being in a rather sketchy part of town.\n\nThe Flying Falafel is a tiny little shop on Market with a simple operation and a limited menu. You basically have the option of spicy falafels, sesame falafels and Hummous served in either a whole wheat pita pocket or on a plate. This comes topped with a variety of toppings and sauces. You can also combo any of these with some Dolma, Baklava or a Cinnamon Banana smoothie. \n\nOverall, the food was pretty good, especially considering the size of their operation. I would probably give this place three stars for the decent quality of the food, but the effort and positive attitude of the staff was just so memorable that I need to bump it up to four. \"I'm a fan.\"", "author": "Mark O."}

Their falafel balls are on the small side but nice crunchy exterior, soft flavorful inside. \n\nService: super friendly. \n\nFood preparation: a little slow depending on when you go but it's made to order so be patient\n\nValue: you will be full at under $10... I went with the falafel frisbee - 10 balls and they threw in a couple of pita slices to boot. $10.90 after tax = SATISFIED!!!\n\nOnly drawback for me is the distance from my office.

My favorite was the baklava, which was a contrasting mixture of both crispy and soft textures.  If you don't like cinnamon,  I would skip this and the banana shake.  I happen to love cinnamon.  It is nice that it is also all vegan.  Normally I can order a falafel at most Greek restaurants but the baklava often has products I cannot eat.  I rarely can order a milkshake anywhere.  \n\nSomeone complained about the falafel balls being too scant but mine had plenty (most were placed on the bottom with tons of veggies on top).  If you move them out from the bottom it becomes more equally distributed.  Had there been more present, it would have been too much, so it was the right amount and certainly not scant.  I especially liked their unique mixture of crunchy veggies, and, as others have said, the pita is soft and moist rather than dry/rubbery.  \n\nIf you don't like the long lines, you might want to try ordering via Caviar, although sometimes the food/drinks are not as fresh (hot or cold, etc.) due to the delay. I have never ordered in person because I have noticed there is always a long line and there is nowhere to eat anyway.", "author": "Teresa K."}

There's nothing at all wrong with the place, per se, but the location is dicey.  The things I saw just walking over from the Civic Center I cannot unsee.\n\nThe food though, that's what you're going for, so even though you'll get hit up for spare change while you wait just outside Flying Falafel for your order, the food will mostly help you to clear your mind of those other things you witnessed.  \n\nFlying Falafel prepares their food much like a chef prepares fine lasagna and a landscaper prepares soil:  layered with rich ingredients to achieve maximum outcomes.  I ordered only a \"snacker\" ($5, half falafel ordered \"spicy\") which was possibly the best falafel I've ever had.  Just before preparing it my name was called and I stepped inside to, ostensibly, indicate what vegetables I wanted.  \"All of them\", of course, then I watched as this meal-sized snacker was composed.  \n\nAfter every second addition of ingredients a sauce was squirted from a nearby bottle, seemingly a different sauce for each two ingredients.  At the end, a falafel ball was flipped artfully into the air and caught between the pita to finish my order; a little dash of circus arts in the open-air kitchen.  \n\nBecause there's only seating outside and only for a handful of people and because I had no desire to dine al fresco in this neighborhood I walked with it a few blocks before digging in.  All I can say is that this thing was quite perfect, with saucy goodness in every bite right down to the very last.  No dry pita, no overly dry falafel.  Tons of fresh and pickled vegetables made for quite the flavor bomb.  \n\nIn such a colorful area as this, you might choose to take advantage of the opportunity to pre-order your meal and receive notification when it's ready.  The food here does take a bit of time to prepare and doing so will reduce your wait outside on Market Street.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-20", "description": "I have walked by this place a few times, and always see it rated highly on Yelp, so I decided to come give it a try. I came here on a cold and rainy Sunday, but it was still pretty busy- when I walked in, there was no line but within a couple of minutes, there were about 5-6 people in line. \n\nSimple menu- falafel, pita, veggies, hummus which you can order in different ways (platters, on bed of hummus, pita sandwiches, etc.) plus a few other things like dolmas, baklava, and some drinks. Everything is vegan. \n\nI ordered a falafel frisbee and banana milkshake. The frisbee is falafel on top of a bunch of hummus, with whatever veggies and sauce you want. I opted for all veggies and also all the sauces (tahini, some kind of spiced mayo, and amba- pickled mango) except for hot sauce. What makes the food good is that separately, each component is pretty good but the combination of everything together is truly fantastic. The hearty hummus with crispy falafel and crunch and super fresh veggies was awesome. The pita bread is pretty good as well, not my favorite but I have never been a huge pita fan. I really liked the amba also, the mango gave a nice touch of sweetness and since it was pickled, you get a bit of tartness too. \n\nThe banana milkshake was great too, honestly better than I expected. I believe it is made with Rice Dream and possibly some nuts also, and it was very creamy and tasty. It does cost $5 which I feel is maybe a bit too high, but I did like it a lot. \n\nThe store is super tiny and doesn't really have much place to even wait for your food or sit (there are a couple of outdoor tables). Definitely more of a grab and go place. I heard it gets pretty busy during the week, especially at lunch. The Flying Falafel is a great option for some filling but not ridiculously heavy food.", "author": "Seema U."}

In fact, my first ever Yelp list was dedicated to the search for the perfect deep fried chickpea ball. I had tried Flying Falafel a year or more ago at the Concord Farmer's Market. I was not impressed at all. I didn't even bother to review them since I hoped I received an \"off\" batch of balls that day.\n\nPerhaps I did because just a short while later, the Flying Falafel has it's own SF brick and mortar. Falafel's are flying from this minuscule, definition of \"hole in the wall\". I walked up and nearly passed by this place if it wasn't for the line of techie hipsters standing out front.\n\nThe ordering process was slightly intimidating. Most everyone in line was a regular it seemed. They all walked up to the self service Square machine where a cashier would normally be and ordered away. I'm usually technologically inclined but on this day I fumbled with the machine like grandpa trying to use an iPad to surf for porn for the first time. I wasn't even quite sure what I ordered.\n\nOnce you're done, just wait in the second line until your name is called. I suggest using something more unique if your name happens to be common as I wasn't the only \"John\" standing in line that day.\n\nIt turns out I ordered the full Falafel plate. The super friendly owner, perhaps recognizing my n00bness, jammed my plate full to the point I could barely close the lid. The included pita bread was so moist and soft, some of the best I've had. The hummus was good, but kinda skimpy portion. I'm sure you could ask for more but I didn't. Everything else was full of flavor. The falafel itself was perfectly fried goodness. I think I got \"spicy\" balls but they were not spicy at all. Still good but ask for extra hot sauce if you really need it to burn.\n\nNot knowing when I would ever get a chance to return, I went buckwild and ordered a Banana shake and a Cinnamon Baklava. I never get to eat baklava since it's usually made with gobs of butter. Not here, as everything is Vegan. This was so good that I would consider ordering party tray of this to last me a week! \n\nThe banana shake while tasty, was more smoothie than shake. Nothing wrong with that. Just not what I was expecting. It didn't really go with the Falafel but was good on it's own. \n\nEverything is to go as there are no seats. There's not really anywhere around here I could see myself eating. The prices are decent which would make me go out of my way to pick up food. Hope to see them expand back to The Mission one day.

We saw this and in our minds and our stomachs, nothing sounded better. And you really can't go wrong with carbs no matter the occasion. We stood in line and as we waited looking like hungry hyenas, they threw us some pita bread. We shared a slice of the pita and we were sold. The pita was so soft and fluffy that I couldn't wait to have a whole pocket to myself.\n\nI got the full flying falafel pita pocket and asked for spicy. Inside was spicy falafel, pickles, carrots, tomatoes, cabbage, onions, tahini, and hot sauce. The combination was out of this world! The fluffiness of the pita bread, the heartiness of the falafel, the acidity of the pickles, the creaminess of the tahini, the crunchiness of the cabbage, and the spiciness of the hot sauce was just unbelievable.

I went after the busy lunch hour and didn't have to wait in line BUT it did take 10 minutes + for the sandwich which I thought was sort of weird since there wasn't a line and it didn't seem like they were actively making orders. It looked like they were making small batches of falafel balls in the fryer so that was the bottleneck.\n\nMy barometer for greatness was Mamoun's Falafel in New Haven/NYC and I have to say it wasn't Mamoun's good but it was still delicious and you can't beat the price! Service was kind and they take credit cards! I really want to try the banana milkshake and baklava next time.\n\nI know they take online orders too so I will probably do that next time so I don't have to wait.", "author": "Semuteh F."}

I always noticed a pretty significant line whenever I walked by so one day my co-worker and I decided to give it a try since he had heard good things but never ordered there either.\n\nFREQUENCY: I've ordered at this establishment once.\n\nFOOD: I got a full Flying Falafel Pocket Sandwich with spicy falafel balls. Most of the ingredients were standard for a good pita pocket but one of the unique ones was french fries. I'd never had them in a pita before and they were vey good. The falafel was also delicious though I do wish they were a little spicier for being listed as a spicy option. They also had the option of a plate opposed to a wrap and a number of sides. I have not ordered any of those items.\n\nDRINK: I did not order any drinks while at this establishment. It was a relatively smaller menu being a fast food style restaurant so I'm assuming they had the normal assortment of water and fountain drinks that are standard at any location.\n\nATMOSPHERE: The Flying Falafel has a very \"hole in the wall\" type atmosphere. It's only large enough for 2-3 people to be standing inside at a time to order and wait for their meals. Most of the line is outside along with other patrons waiting for their food. Meals are served in a quick fast food style and while there is some outdoor tables most choose to take their meal back to their respective offices (at least at lunch).\n\nSTAFF: Being a small restaurant I didn't talk to the staff besides taking my order. They were easy enough to understand and answer any questions I asked regarding the menu and were pleasant during the entire process of receiving my meal.\n\nPAYMENT: Credit cards or cash were acceptable.\n\nI no longer work near this restaurant so I don't know the next time I'll be able to stop in.

I ate the other half later and the pita no longer tasted as good it didn't even taste like anything. The guy working the counter I'm not sure why he's working it as opposed to the other guy who clearly speaks English fluently. I've asked for a full pita pocket with half spicy half sesame falafel but got 1 of each instead. I didn't realize till after purchasing and having left the place like 30 minutes later that he entered in 2 orders for me. The regular sesame was again bland and flavorless. While the spicy one was a bit spicy on and off. I also ordered a small banana milkshake. The milkshake was good but nothing special. I have made a very similar tasting milkshake before at home. Overall the small milkshake was too expensive for being something I basically already made at home before. The pockets too expensive as well. The fries not worth 3.95! I had their baklava and cheesecake before and also weren't anything special. I don't recommend this place. I suggest going somewhere else especially if it's for the falafel. The falafel was so deeply fried it may have well been something from a fast food chain. I came in thinking the food would be delicious and the falafel would taste like traditional falafel.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-29", "description": "I was all over the place while visiting San Francisco, from local must-tries to fancy-schmancy, multi-course meals.  The Flying Falafel was my last bite in downtown before I had to fly out and was, hands down, the most fortuitous whim I could have had.  Every single solitary bite of my meal was fresh and flavorful, so add to that impeccable customer appreciation and you can bet money I will be longing for an experience this remarkable in any other city I travel to!\n\nThe Space \n\nInjected into a small chunk of Market St., FF was a perfect choice for my location and the time window I had left.  When they get busy I imagine you will see the obligatory \"line out the door\" any great downtown biz in San Fran. gets, so that can be written off.  The interior was clean and the colors were super fun (super pun intended: their logo is a reworked spin on Superman's brand).  In the back two guys were hard at work cranking out takeout orders and flinging falafel.  \n\nThey have a tiny bit of table space outside that could be around should you wanna eat in a hurry, but more than likely this will be a grab-and-go experience.\n\nThe Service\n\nGiven only two guys were in the place making magic happen I was expecting I might get a little of that \"I'm in a hurry but forcing myself to be polite\" energy out of a downtown food spot.  Polar opposite.  I walked in and began to ask questions about the food (currently a vegetarian, I wanted to know more about the cooking process), the options (needed to insure I had hummus...because hummus), and share in my general visitor enthusiasm.  The guy fielded every question with a smile and I knew the passion of running a great business well was actively at work.  \n\nBy the time I left, I knew a bit about the background, the owner's story, and even got a sample of the banana shake just because he was excited that I was excited.  It was exemplary in every sense of the word.\n\nThe Food\n\nTheir falafel blew my previous understanding of the beloved food out of the fryer completely: how you can take something fried and starchy, keep it minimal on the oil and heavy on the freshness is beyond me, but, my oh my, how they have done it.  My meal was basically a sampler platter of their menu: fantastic falafel balls, lovely local veggies, fresh-baked pita with from-scratch hummus, dolmas, and baklava.  \n\nThe veggies were so crispy, cool, and full of life, pairing perfectly with the warm, crunchy falafel balls of bliss.  The entire serving was lightly coated with tzatziki sauce but the spice-lovers will want to get a bit extra of their other, hotter option too.  The hummus embodied the essence of \"fresh is best\": nothing at all like the pseudo-dips you find in chain markets that lean on add-ins to give it any hint of life.  Take that, spread generously on slices of warm, fluffy pita, and you might be tempted to get on one knee and propose then and there.\n\nI really appreciated the dolmas as well, because I am not big on grape leaves, but cannot undersell how incredible they were.  The filling was so creamy and rich with authenticity I gobbled them down despite typically not being a fan.  \n\nAnd of course the stand out: their Cinnamon Baklava.  I do not know if cinnamon is a traditional ingredient or their brilliant invention, but every bite was a high-flying, flaky, flavor adventure sending me soaring as though I were Lois Lane herself.  Get it.  Do not think about it, just let that perfectly-balanced blend of sweet, spice, and everything nice sweep you up into its arms and send you to the sky. \n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEvery bite of this meal was memorable, even after the parade of places I went to while visiting for several days.  Coming here will set the bar for your experience of Mediterranean or, perhaps if you grew up with these foods, be the oasis you have been looking for in the Bay Area.  I may have to rely on a plane ticket to ever get this deliciousness again, but at least eating it I felt like I could fly.", "author": "James J."}

This is the kind of local small business that makes me want to return time and time again to support them.\n\nI just went for the first time today. It's a tiny takeout window in the middle of the not-so-nice stretch of Market. I walk in, and the owner greets me very welcomingly, and asks if it's my first time here. When I said yes, he gave me a free falafel and a piping hot pita bread to sample. Both were delicious! I ordered the falafel pocket, and just had a nice enjoyable chat with him while he made my order.\n\nThe falafel pocket was delicious. It's packed full of flavorful falafel that is actually not dry like other falafel joints in SF.

The banana shake is pretty good though! I wish the location was easier to access. There is no convenient parking nearby. The place also has no place really to sit and appreciate the food. There is small counter which is kind of on the streets and that is not the nicest. I feel like if I didn't have to trek my food home about 10 minutes away to eat that it would taste better?

He has that kind of warm smile that just makes you feel better; his kindness is infectious.

Reason number #47 I will never be gluten-free: when offered bread, I always say yes. \n\nThis is a 100% vegan, soy-free establishment with several gluten free options. The veggies taste crisp and fresh, and everything is very flavorful without being salty or greasy. Major props to this unassuming falafel shop. Make sure you get a sample (I wasn't offered one, and was too shy to ask). \n\nI will definitely become a regular here. On my second visit, I think I will opt for the Combo #2: a pita pocket + that infamous banana milkshake I've heard so much about ($11 pre-tax).\n\nI noticed that they had a stand at the Very Vegan Sunday event at SoMa StrEat Food Park (every 2nd Sunday of the month), so look for them there!

The storefront is something you should be looking for, because the cash and kitchen area are operated in a small area. I noticed some skaters dining outside on their only 3 or 4 seater table, and went inside. Music was playing quite loudly that night, and the lights were very festive. I ordered the Pita Pocket with organic seasame balls, paid, and gave them my name. You'll likely have to wait outside like I did as there is little room to wait inside with incoming lineups. It took about 8 minutes for my pocket to be ready (granted, there were two people ahead of me in line). I was called and asked what I wanted inside. I said everything except hot sauce. And it was hard to talk because the man getting my food ready was also trying to serve a customer ordering in line so I was confused as to whether he was talking to me sometimes. No biggie. A local food business's success is not bad news to me. I got my food and went on my way. When I opened my takeout, I was surprised he put fries in my pita pocket! I did not expect this. The food was quite yummy, but I've had better falaffel dishes. I was also not full from the pita pocket like I had expected. I would recommend you trying the pita pocket for yourself.

The French fry guy that served nothing but fries. I respect an operation who specializes, but offering one kind of item appeared a bit limiting even though he offered a variety of sauces as well as soup and chili as accompaniments. I wish the potato guy well, but the recent switch in ownership was probably for the best because you can now have a full-fledged Mediterranean meal from this closet of a space (photo: http://bit.ly/1D9DkxJ). I walked up and was immediately greeted by the perennially sunny Assaf, the new owner who was more than happy to give me a complimentary falafel ball, warm from the oven and with a kick of spice. There's no place to sit here, but what they hell?\n\nFortunately, I live close by, so I made an ambitious order to go. Hey, I skipped lunch at work, so stop judging me. First up was his house specialty, the $7 Flying Falafel Pocket Sandwich, quite an ample pita pocket, nicely warmed and spread wide open for at least a quartet of spicy falafel balls nesting atop a salad mix liberally dressed (photo: http://bit.ly/1AqQbhB). Quite delicious and the fresh warmth of the balls really made them taste like sugarless donut holes. And that's a good thing. I then tried the $5 Dolma Rice Wraps, a zesty appetizer of five dolmas wrapped in grape leaves and topped with a bit of shredded carrot (photo: http://bit.ly/1LF3ezT). Tasty though a tad too oily for my taste. Somehow I just can't pass up hummus when I'm in a Mediterranean setting, so I decided to try the $5 Hummus Saucer.\n\nIt turned out to be a generous serving of hummus topped with sauteed vegetables and accompanied by warm pita (photo: http://bit.ly/1DSG4Dv). Usually I'm fine with plain hummus, but the extra texture of the vegetable bits made it more of an entree than I expected. I really should have stopped there. That was plenty enough food, but $2 for Cinnamon Baklava seems too absurdly cheap not to have as a sweet tooth satisfier (photo: http://bit.ly/1DnPeqn). It was a sweetly crunchy slice of baklava with a multitude of pastry layers uniquely sprinkled with cinnamon. Yep, I went overboard, and if I was wiser, I should have just gone for a combo meal that would have given me a sampler of almost everything. But hey, it's soy-free, vegan and mostly gluten-free. So what's to complain? Especially with Assaf's friendly disposition. I mean the guy wears a T-shirt that says \"Official Baller\" (photo: http://bit.ly/1vxIAxq). How can you refuse service from a guy like that?\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...Mediterranean fast food, really well executed, especially the falafel balls and the hummus\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...uhhh, it's a closet\nSERVICE - 4 stars...he's an official baller\nTOTAL - 4 stars...Assaf has a good thing going here, so check out his balls", "author": "Ed U."}

You order from their tablet and within a few minutes your order will be ready. They have a ton of veggie options which I like. The reason for the minus star is that the falafel sample I got, was what was in the pita bread. It's not the round falafel balls I'm used to, it's tiny bits of them fried.

And make sure to grab a fork and tons of napkins b/c you cannot eating this massive sandwich with out making a huge mess. Honestly though, this is one of the best falafel sandwich's I have ever had.

There is no seating inside, and there are about two stools outside. If you go at prime lunch hours during the weekday then make sure you stock up on patience because the line will be out the door.

They're very efficient for usually just two people at most actually making the food. I've never had a problem with an order, and almost all my interactions with the cashier/cooks have started and ended with smiles.\n\nTHE FOOD: My oh my. Everyone talked hype about the San Francisco food scene before I moved here. I wasn't impressed much in my first few weeks...but then I had the Spicy Falafel Pocket. I've eaten copious amounts of falafel in my life, especially in my travels through the Middle East. This was on another level. This tasted even better than a perfect falafel sandwich should taste. The hint of spice in the falafel superbly complimented the toppings, sauce, and hummus. The pita was fluffly and contained the ingredients well.

I've heard so much about this place, and knew I had to give it a try at some point. I had a completely random craving for hummus that took over my body, and before I knew it I was staring at the Eat24 receipt with an estimated delivery of 45 minutes. Yes, this review is for a delivery order. \n\nI guess you could say I'm addicted to delivery. I order delivery from Eat24 around 3-5 times a week, if not more. As an Eat24 VIP with over 300 orders under my belt (NO SHAME), I have high standards for my deliveries! Estimated delivery windows are useless, and I usually always allow an hour, and if it exceeds that I just give them a ring to check on it. I kid you not, I got a call at 47 minutes on the DOT that my food had arrived. As someone who does this a lot, I have to admit that's pretty awesome! \n\nRight as I got to my gate to get the food, I realized I forgot the cash tip, so I told him to wait a hot second as I ran up to grab cash. When I came back, he was so thankful. He said it was so unnecessary for me to go all the way back up, although he really appreciated it. He shook my hand, thanked me a million times, and was super nice. Major points for that. \n\nI ordered the Combo Meal #1, which comes with a whole spicy falafel pita pocket, 2 dolmas and a cinnamon baklava. I also ordered a hummus saucer. After I went down 2 flights of stairs to get my order, I came up to my apartment only to realize I had actually received a \"Plate Me\", an extra side of 10 falafel, and a cinnamon baklava. No dolma in sight, and certainly no pita pocket!\n\nStunned and devastated, I ran to computer to double check my order. Sure enough, my order was normal and had not changed. I immediately started formulating the 2 star review in my head, planning the wordage I would use to critique my failed order. All that negativity simply faded away into space the moment I actually tried the food. \n\nThe \"Plate Me\" was so delicious - the veggies were fresh, the hummus was so flavorful, and the falafel was hot and seemed like it had just got out of the fryer. The extra falafel was the perfect amount, and allowed me to finish the plate without running out of falafel. The baklava was a great treat, and seemed much higher quality than the baklava I've had at other Mediterranean restaurants.  \n\nI should THANK Flying Falafel for messing up my order. The pita bread wrapped around falafel would have probably been carb overload, and the plate was the best alternative to combat that.

There aren't actually many options for fast, healthful takeout in this neighborhood, so I patronize them a fair amount.\n\nSF seems to have two different kinds of felafel joints: ones with really good felafel balls (Sunrise Deli) and ones with good sandwich stuff (Truly Med).  Flying Felafel is the latter sort; in fact, you can get so much vegetable matter (cabbage, onions, tomatoes, pickles, cucumbers, tahini, cilantro sauce, hot sauce, beets, etc.) in your pita that they could forget the felafel and you might not notice!  \n\nThis is a good thing, because their felafel \"nuggets\" are a bit meh; the best thing I can say about them is that they're fried to order.  Their pita, though, which is homemade somewhere, is fluffy and delicious.  And, importantly, doesn't immediately fall apart with that stuffed-full sandwich.  Still I can dream of Flying Felafel's sandwiches with Sunrise Deli's felafel balls.\n\nThe various sides (dolmas, hummus, etc.) are also good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-10-18", "description": "Went to this Market St. food stand earlier today and ordered a falafel sandwich -- in large part due to the rave reviews I'd read on Yelp but also because I live close by. While the sandwich I took to go was good and definitely hit the spot, the atmosphere was hella sketchy - I got hit up for money twice during the 10 minutes I spent ordering/receiving my food however one other issue repelled me even further. When I went to pay their kiosk screen actually asks customers how much they wish to tip 10, 20 or 25%! In smaller faint letters at the bottom of the screen you can also click the option \"decline to tip\" but I seriously felt uncomfortable about the whole pushiness of this calculated strategy towards customers. A tip jar is one thing and is considered standard nowadays but formally requesting 25% tip at an open counter foodstand several feet away from the sidewalk is really pushing it. \nIf anyone is wondering what the current standard is regarding tipping on takeout orders here's what I found from an official hospitality industry website:\n\n\"As for modern\u00a0tipping\u00a0etiquette, according to Peter Post and his institute, there is \"no obligation\" to tip on takeout, but one should tip 10% for \"extra service (curb delivery) or a large, complicated\u00a0order.\"--Mar 26, 2015\"\n\nAs many of us are strugging to even pay our rent in SF thesedays I truly hope this is not a general strategy that's trending here. Made me think twice about returning to this food stand again.", "author": "John D."}

For only $11.96, I grabbed the combo #2 which consisted of a sizable Falafel pocket with a banana milkshake. The spices, vegetables, and sauces combined with the falafel on a warm and soft pita  was absolute heaven.\n\nCould my senses have been magnified because I was really hungry? Yes...but I know a good chemistry of spices and sauces when I get them. And, these people are chemist. Now, because of the Yelp reviews, I passed on eating inside their restaurant, so I took the liberty of getting it delivered to my hotel.

It seems like there is always a line because I was told to find the place, just look for the crowd.  The line may look a little intimidating, but honestly it's such a small little shop that you would expect any type of line to form. ALSO the line moves fast so don't worry.\n\nI got lucky and I was planning on ordering a spicy pocket.  The lady who was picking up her food at the same time I was ordering had a messed up order and they had made an extra spicy pocket on accident.  I just asked if I could have it since it was exactly what I was going to order, and the people working were really nice and let me have it instead of waiting in line.  Plus I watched the poor guy make it right on the spot, so I knew it wasn't just sitting there before it was given to me.\n\nIf you are a spicy person like myself, then you definitely want to ask for that extra spicy sauce.  I asked them to add some more and it definitely had that little kick.  ALSO if you are a taco bell fan like myself, I would describe the taste to be like a chalupa from taco bell which for me means PRETTY DAMN GOOD.  It definitely was super tasty and probably comparing it to taco bell isn't doing it justice, but I will always have a soft spot for taco bell being that was my childhood meals every weekend. SO that means that this place is good if its like childhood for me.\n\nEnjoy Yelpers! You are in for a treat.", "author": "Alisa S."}

We ordered two falafels and an order of dolmas. We waited our turn while two gentlemen ran the register and made the falafels. We didn't have to wait long for our treasures and most of it was worth the wait. \n\nHere's the skinny on the Flying Falafel...\n\nLet's start with what not to get!\nDo not order the dolmas. \nThey come from a can - I should know - I watched them open the can, drain the liquid, and then place an order in a to-go wrapper for eating. They were soggy; half fell apart in the bag and were nothing great to write home about. \n\nNow! On to what you SHOULD order!\nThe falafel sandwich!! Don't waste your time ordering the \"small\" or Snack Size... you WILL WANT the whole thing!! Trust me on this!! \nThe falafel balls were about the size of quarter, perfectly cooked, crunchy on the outside and creamy and hot on the inside. \nThe pita pockets were made fresh locally - they were steamed to heat them and then stuffed with a myriad of both fresh and pickled veggies and assorted herbs. The pita pocket was hot and chewy and perfect!  The sauces were amazing!! I think I could have eaten the parsley aioli on just about everything! We ordered both a spicy and a regular one. The spicy was good... the regular was great... the only difference between the two was that the spicy had a hot chili sauce in addition to the other parsley aioli. \n\nCompletely enjoyed the meal despite the dolmas and the \"questionable\" location of the falafel stand. It is downtown... be prepared to find someplace to park on the street... we got to enjoy watching a couple of people light up their crack pipes on the side of the minivan in front of us", "author": "Jaimeson C."}

I had read stellar reviews on Yelp so I took the opportunity to check them out. \n\nAssaf was cracking jokes with the customers and volunteers. He demonstrated his great hand eye coordination skills, tossing a falafel in the air and catching it in a pita pocket with ease. He gave us samples of falafel and pita bread as we stood waiting in the long line. He also handed out business cards to anyone who wanted one. \n\nThe sandwich was a great way to start off the afternoon. You had the choices of sesame or spicy falafel or a mix of both. I went with both. The falafel were these delicious, crispy, and crunchy morsels. They came with sliced veggies and a generous amount of sauce. It was pretty good overall and filled me up. \n\nMy one gripe is one of the added veggies was too sour and bitter for my liking. I'm not exactly sure which one it was but I hope this was just a one time scenario. Vegans rejoice, the cinnamon baklava is vegan. Baklava is usually made with honey which is usually an ingredient most vegans avoid. I wasn't in the mood for dessert but I do plan on having some in the future. \n\nI will check out their brick and mortar place to try out their vegan banana milkshake (I hope it lives up to what I imagine) and plated falafel with a friend.", "author": "S A."}

I agree with others that you kind of work your way through the thing getting the veggies on top followed by falafel, then more veggies and then finally the bottom that has the sauce soaked falafels. That's where the pita gets really mind blowing though. The sauce and falafels play off each other perfectly. I do wish the ingredients could be mixed up more in the pita, but the last several bites were so savory it took my review from a 3 or 4 to a 5. \nI also ordered a small banana shake, which was amazingly good.

Always on the quest for a good falafel my husband and I drove over for lunch midweek. Since there's no parking nearby, he dropped me off and I went in to order. \n\nAll the platters sounded essentially the same, so I'm not even sure which I ordered. I thought I was getting something with a lot of hummus and falafel  like the lady in front of me but I ended up with a ton of questionably fresh veggies and falafel with a tiny bit of hummus. Nobody explained that I needed to ring myself up as I stood there looking like an idiot and the lunch rush creating a line behind me. \n\nI got asked for change while ringing myself up from a guy off the street that apparently panhandles inside. Not their fault, and not at all surprising given the area. Just awkward as I'm standing there with my wallet out. The guys working there were great and offered to make me a batch of fresh falafel, but I declined as I'd already been waiting about 15 mins with only a couple of orders ahead of me. \n\nI waited a lot longer for the food than I thought reasonable, smelled like a deep fryer the rest of the day, and the food was just alright.

I went for a meaty experience with the crispy chicken, which was very nicely seasoned, tender, and prepared perfectly. The balls, well, they're balls--not too big so they don't take up the whole sandwich and, again, nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked. Now the fixings: this is where it really goes off the chart. Cucumber, carrots (yes, lovely sweet carrots in a falafel), pickles, and more all nicely chopped and perfectly proportioned to give the sandwich a bit of crunch and lots of flavor. And finally the sauces: the tahini sauce was lovely, not too gritty, which can happen, and full of flavor. And hit me with some spice. The spicy sauce gave just enough piquancy to make all of the vegetables, balls, and chicken really sing. Super duper delicious. Kudos! ... But there's more.

This place is a walkup counter where you place your own order on an ipad. Two guys behind the counter are slanging 1\" diameter falafel balls like crack, throwing them onto of dollops of hummus surrounded by an assortment of veggies, packed into fresh hot pockets of pita with all the fixings, or just throwing 10 of them in a bag for snacking. Plus, like any successful dealer, they often hand out bite-sized pieces of hot, steamy pita bread to get you hooked.\n\nI got a full pocket with spicy sauce and it was amazing. Soft, fresh pita, tons of veggies and hummus, and as many falafel balls that could be packed in. My wife got the falafel plate and it was a TON of veggies with hummus in the middle and falafel balls dropped all around it. The veggie ratio was overwhelming but better too much than not enough.\n\nI ordered the cinnamon baklava but did not realize they forgot to give it to me until I got back to our hotel.\n\nDownside: Its on a sketchy stretch of Market so stay alert when in the area. I witnessed a guy urinating in the middle of the sidewalk facing the street on the same block. Not cool, but Id go there again in a heartbeat the next time I am in town.", "author": "Aaron D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-10", "description": "Came in here ignorant of the amazing yelp reviews of this place. I can verify- it is indeed worth 5 stars. Came in when it was pretty quiet, Assaf immediately offered me a sample falafel, and I snarfed it down. A carnivore at heart, I left right afterward to pursue more meaty offerings, but not before Assaf offered me a steamy delicious pita sample on the way out. \n\nA block or two away, my taste buds were craving more, so I went back and got the full pita ($7) sandwich.\n\nMan, was it a good decision. As if the amazingly friendly Assaf wasn't enough, the food was incredible. I've sampled some damn good falafel when I visited Israel, and this is up there with some of the best. The most impressive thing was the construction of the sandwich. Assaf fried garbanzo balls in front of me, and then expertly tossed them into the open pita, hurling heaps of fresh veggies on top. The trick was in the layers- he alternated between fresh tomato, sweet pickled carrot, cucumber, lettuce, and hot sauce and tahini.\n\nAs always with falafel, if you can handle the heat- go for spicy. It's got a fuller flavor and is well worth your singed taste buds. The falafel are fresh, crispy and yet perfect on the inside, and the pita itself was delicious. I was most impressed with the freshness of the vegetables, especially the taste of those sweet carrots. Mmm.", "author": "Jason T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-19", "description": "I've never been a huge fan of falafel, but Flying Falafel has made me a lover with the most perfect crunchy and flavorful falafel wrapped up in your choice of fresh ingredients. I usually go with the wrap, which comes with your choice of either the sesame or spicy falafel. Both are good, depending on your preference of flavor. Their pita is amazing as I've found that it's hard to get whole wheat pita that maintains the same chewy, thick texture that I love. The pita is stuffed with at least 5 falafel, then topped with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, sauerkraut, cucumbers and several different sauces. The wrap ends up being extremely filling and completely guilt-free.

My boyfriend's pita had a tiny rip in it and they noticed it prior to serving it and decided to remake it completely.  My only feedback would be that the components that make up a single pita tend to eat separately.

However, it is definitely good and a good value.", "author": "Kelly M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-06-25", "description": "First, a disclaimer: I grew up in Israel, so I am used to higher standard of Falafel than most Americans.\n\nI came to the Flying Falafel looking for a pre-theater dinner. Given the rave reviews and reading that an Israeli runs the place, I had high expectations, but was disappointed. This falafel fails to impress me even in American standards.\n\nThe good: the service was really friendly, the Banana milkshake was tasty, the price is great for SF, the portions are generous and I liked the spicing.\n\nThe bad:\nThe pita: I've read that this place gets freshly baked Pita every morning. This should've been a huge plus in my book. Unfortunately, when I got the Pita in the evening, they used steaming to restore it's freshness. The result is a chewy, unpleasant texture. Which is a pity because it seems like it couldv'e been excellent Pita in the morning. I get less chewy texture when I defrost frozen Pitas in the microwave at home ... \n\nThe falafel balls: the spicing is good, but I didn't like the texture. It was overly dense and very oily. This seems the oil was not hot enough. Making good falafel requires a fine control of frying oil temperature. If it's too hot, the balls get brown outside while underdone inside. If it's not hot enough (as in this case), it soaks oil and gets overcooked inside. When it's just right, the outside is crispy and the inside is moist and fluffy. They definitely didn't get it right, at least when I tried it.", "author": "Sela M."}

We went for a spicy falafel with more cucumber and tomato, parsley, tahini, and extra falafel on the side.  Such a difference was made and we devoured the whole dish.

I used to eat here for lunch regularly when I worked down the street and loved the food and the service.

Figured that there would be big fat lines for the food trucks & I was right! I read the reviews & knew that there wouldn't be any seating, so we just picked up our falafels to eat on the walk to City Hall. The 2 guys working last night were super nice & so chill even tho they were so busy! We each had the full pita sandwich ($7.00 ea) & asked for it to be spicy. It wasn't spicy at all, but still yummy! I liked all of the filling options except the coleslaw. Generous amount of filling & super fresh! As I said, we were headed to the CH event...gross few blocks to walk while eating! Watch out for the small streams of wet stuff on the sidewalks & don't take in any big sniffs!", "author": "susan w."}

I'm down in sf visiting from portland where we have dozens of places making felafel from scratch. This is better then most. Bread and felafel patties are fresh. Owner is sweet.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-10", "description": "I normally don't care about service. But service here is backwards, you service the guy behind the counter to get your food (he's also the owner). This is a place that asks for your name and doesn't give you a number. And after hearing owner inaudibly announce one of dozens of orders is ready you have to act like the guy behind the counter is the coolest guy you ever met to get his attention and find out if it's yours. During these regular communication problems, he acts like it's 100% your fault, he's not gonna make any effort to change his chill style, that would make him look uncool, so it's not happening. It seriously reminded me of something from highschool when talking to people who think they're better than you. Did you not hear the name called out? You gotta check on whatever name it was, and who knows if it will take five or twenty minutes. YOU lean way across the counter and ask your question, cause he's not gonna raise his voice, or he might even act like he didn't hear you. If there's anyone telling the guy at the counter a story, he's way more interested in them then calling out your order number audibly, or acknowledging your presence. I've been here three times and each time had the same experience. One time there was a woman there whom I inferred was undergoing a similar experience as me. Several times she heard him say something, and approached the counter for more information. A comment she made while trying to get the guy's attention was that \"she saw this place was 5 stars, whatever that means\". Recommendation to owner, get a microphone, give out numbers, and then call out those numbers louder than a guy who is trying to nonchalantly get laid. There will be a line, Congratulations, you made it to the front of the line, it's an honor to be here. Flying Falafel is really good food for a good price, but theres a price in your dignity. I've had to approach the counter several times each time, and I halfway through I think: F this. Three times was enough, I'm not going back.", "author": "Phillip C."}
