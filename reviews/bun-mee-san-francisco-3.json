I've never tried anything but sandwitches to be honest. \n\nSloppy Bun Sandwich is very juicy, a bit spicy to my taste, but not too much. Bread is crispy, but thanks to added sauces and mayo it is not dry. Overall it is a juicy sandwich with a bit spicy flavor - I'd recommend taking some drink to it, helps to prevent hiccups if you can't handle spices (like me).\n\nBelly Bun Sandwich is crunchy, not spicy with a lot of sour carrot flavor. It is a really good combo by itself so I never added a hardboiled egg on top of it, but if you need more calories it may be a good idea.\n\nOverall it is a nice place to get Bun Me for a lunch, but be aware - the line at noon can be long, so you'll have to wait 10-15 minutes to get your sandwich, stuff is friendly, and preparation time for food is short. They also have several tables outside, at noon you can get some free tint while eating :)", "author": "Dmytro Z."}

First of all, why do they have the door open anyways? Second, the workers saw me walk in and barely tells me right when I was about to order? why couldn't they have told me right when i entered? they wasted my time, looking at the menu. but whatever I left and went to a cafe nearby then i eventually came back at 11. \n\nI was hungry and didn't really know where else to eat, and I haven't tired this place so I said why not? I went straight to the counter since I already knew what I wanted. tell me why the lady who told me they were closed still earlier was giving me attitude? and even after I tipped them, rude! I'm a nice person and I even came back after my previous experienced. also while I was waiting for my order, she treated the customer after me better than me, gave him this and that, which she did not even ask me. I was pissed at the point and asked her if I can have my food to go. I refuse to sit and eat my food after being treated unfairly. \n\nThe food itself was good, I'm a bit surprised since it looks like an americanized vietnamese restaurant in the city. I got the Bun Bowl, and gotta say it has its flavor right on. although the vermicilli noodle is a bit different from what i'm used to, it's more thicker. I didn't have a problem since it was fulfilling and has lots of flavor to enjoy on a nice day out. Just weird how after eating, I felt really gassy the whole day. I know TMI but hey just a heads up, my stomach is a bit sensitive so probably that's why. ha ha. \n\nIf it wasn't for the rudeness of their customer service, their rating would've been better but for now it'll be a 3 star because they really made me upset to even sit down to eat there and like I said, I'm not even the type of customer that will make a fuss about it. I'd probably give it a try the next time just because their food is good.", "author": "Deneb T."}

The lemongrass pork did not have much flavor and lacked that nice fattiness and chew that you only get with a cheaper cut. Since the pickles were shredded, they blended into the sandwich instead of adding texture. Saddest of all, the pate was not noticeable next to the mayo. \n\nWhile I totally understand elevating a dish, I think Bun Mee goes too far to the point of losing the nostalgic goodness of the banh mi.

No flavor at all in the Bun Bowl. I was shocked that it was so flavorless. I'm not a picky eater at all, and have had my fair share of Vietnamese inspired foods, but this was a total disaster. The garlic fries were on the bizarre side, but tasted alright. For 20 dollars/ a person, you can do far better than this in SF. No clue if this was just an aberration or if this is the quality of food being served at this establishment. I might have just picked the wrong dish. But if your name is on the dish, it should at least have some flavor. My friend had the same thing and the same feedback. Not telling anyone to stay away from the restaurant, because it wasn't disgusting or anything, but your money may be better spent elsewhere.  2 stars is generous.", "author": "A.C. R."}

The cook tried to tell me that it was a \"fish nerve\" but I know worms and I know nerves and it was not a nerve. If I'm to be completely fair I know that worms are naturally occurring in fish so at the very least it was unsightly but I definitely lost my appetite after I found it and felt a bit queasy.  I was also irritated that the cook tried to cover it up to avoid my posting about it, at the expense of my health. \n\nThis review would be my second time eating at Bun Mee. The first time I purchased my food during happy hour so the price was great. The fried fish tastes good but the banh mi itself is found desiring more. Its flavor is a bit lifeless in comparison to the banh mi I get at Vietnamese mom and pop shops. But I think it's where I'd go if I was looking for something simple and easy.\n\nOriginal score: 3.25, lost a star for the worm", "author": "Eugene Y."}

Then I quickly went to order, and the cashier told me that happy hour was over. What? I knew it was, but why the uneven pricing? So dumb. Beer is still cheap anyways, though they ran out of the one I originally requested.\n\nWhen it came time to ordering food, I had my eye on the tasty-sounding Hawker Bowl, with fried egg, spicy cucumbers, vietnamese herbs, bok choy, pickled carrots and daikon, cilantro, spicy mayo, and fried shallots over garlic rice. Apparently jalape\u00f1os are extra, but it's a generous amount. My friend ordered some chili fries to share at the table. Holy crap, the food here is spicy! Eventually we caved in and couldn't eat the jalape\u00f1os, but everything was filling and delicious.\n\nThere's a decent amount of space inside the restaurant, though I can imagine it gets busy in the middle of a weekday.

I ate way too much and enjoyed every moment.\n\nNotably, none of the flavors were notable - they weren't awesome or remarkable, just solidly good. It was tasty enough I wanted to keep eating, but not enough that it registered as delicious. And I ended up putting a ton of Sriracha on it.\n\nIf it's not happy hour, I'd probably hop a bus or uber pool to 7 Mission, which I think is the best Viet place in SOMA (and one of the best in the city).

But on the other hand, it wasn't really worth writing/Yelping home about either. \n\nI really have no one to blame but myself for ordering the wrong thing. When you go to a place called Bun Mee, you should probably stick with their namesake dish. But instead of ordering a Bahn Mi sandwich, I decided to be healthy and order the 5-spice chicken salad. In my mind, I'd be getting all the good stuff you find in their sandwich, but without the bread/carbs/guilt.\n\nUnfortunately, the salad was both overwhelming in size and underwhelming in flavor. It literally could've fed 3 people with this salad. But size isn't everything. It was difficult to pick up the various veggies and chicken bits with my fork under that giant bed of lettuce & wonton chips. And I was actually kind of surprised by the quality of the chicken. It was a bit gamey and stringy, and not all appetizing looking. It just didn't look or taste like chicken fresh off the grill. Fortunately, the tangy dressing was the saving grace. \n\nThat being said, the salad was certainly filling and a good value for the price. But the next time I return to Bun Mee, I'm sticking with the sandwich.", "author": "Kevin B."}

No need to complain about \"authenticity\" because they're trying to do their own thing anyway.\n\nMama Tran's Crispy Egg Rolls: It's no Tu Lan, but most places aren't.  Still decent though.  Perfectly crispy with good meaty filling.  Could have been thicker.  The dipping sauce didn't taste particularly fishy though, too bad.\n\nSloppy Bun: Not your typical Vietnamese sandwich.  Ground beef covered in a thick coconut curry sauce.  Kinda reminded me of that Cambodian ground pork dip, Prahok Ktiss.  Very rich.  Felt like a less protein than other sandwiches though.\n\nCombo: Much higher quality pate and \"fancy ham\" than typical cheap Vietnamese combo sandwiches.  It didn't have that low quality processed meat taste I can only describe as funky.  Tons of grilled lemongrass kurobuta pork flooded the sandwich.  Only a slice or two of thin mortadella; would have liked to see more.\n\nStrawberry Lychee Agua Fresca: Super sweet and refreshing.

The tofu had some sort of marinade on it and it didn't taste bad at all but I would've liked a crispier texture.

Soft, but crispy bread, lots of pickled carrots and daikon, and the soy mayo and spread is actually pretty tasty.

So I asked for more cilantro and they hooked it up with a small bowl of it.\n\nAs I finished my sandwich, I noticed that I was still....hungry.\nI even had a snack about an hour before so I wasn't starving or anything. I don't think anyone can get full off of these sandwiches. I'm guessing meat might fill you up more, but the portions are still small. You'd have to go for the twice-as-expensive bowl to fill up.\n\nIn the end, I really liked the taste of the sandwich, but the price & portion size means I probably won't be back for a while.", "author": "Lanie L."}

The crowd here is an unsurprising mix of the young and hip which is a perfect match for the manga-like decor with a huge red mural of women in motorcycle helmets (photo: http://bit.ly/1jGCDqT).

What a smart move for them to find a location surrounding hungry-eyed lunch-seeking FiDi-ers, like myself!  And guess what?!  It tastes SOOOO GOOOOD!\n\nBun Mee, B\u00e1nh m\u00ec, Bun Mee, B\u00e1nh m\u00ec, Bun Mee.  However, you say it, the outcome is the same... TASTY!  I arrived at 12:45 PM and the line was 10 people deep, I waited 5 minutes to get to the register and ordered the combo sandwich and salt n' peppa garlic fries.  Then waited another 10 minutes for my order to come out.  It was a quick process, which is something I really appreciate since I usually grab lunch and run back to the office to chow down.\n\n:) Combo Sandwich - it's main ingredients were grilled kurobuta pork and p\u00e2t\u00e9.  First off, the french roll was warm, crunchy and perfect.  I was able to taste the pork with the pate along with all the other ingredients.  And I must say, it was a tasty treat to be able to eat one of these.  5 STARS\n\n:) Salt and Pepper Garlic fries with Jalapenos - It wasn't the salt and pepper that I was expecting because usually there's a batter coating to go with salt and pepper fried food.  So, I wasn't impressed, perhaps the garlic and jalapenos made the fries soggy, I don't like soggy.  I still chomped all of them up but left all the jalapenos behind, those peppers gave it HEAT.  2.5 STARS\n\nThe decor definitely has that designers thoughtful touches that mimic's what a true B\u00e1nh m\u00ec street vendor may look like in the streets of Vietnam.  The shop looks modern and trendy with their gutted out high ceilings.  You can't help but notice the chaotic web of wires that floats on their ceilings and dangles with industrial lighting.  The red poster art on the wall bounces off a modernized vintage propaganda image but at the same time feels friendly communistic and playful.\n\nService was friendly and efficient.\n\nOverall, I'm over the top infatuated by Bun Mee.  And I have plans to eat EVERYTHING that's listed on their menu.  Next up on the line-up...five spice chicken sandwich and ice coffee...  If these 2 items hit my palate the same way as the combo sandwich, I'll be theirs forever!\n\nNOTES: Sandwiches are typical FiDi prices of $6.50 and above .  I've had other B\u00e1nh m\u00ec sandwiches at this price but does not taste as good as the ones at this place.", "author": "Jenny T."}

When I heard that they were opening up this spot on Market, I couldn't be more enthusiastic.  Time has gone by and it's only recently that I've found myself here twice (although once was via delivery).  On BOTH occasions, however, Bun Mee has messed up my order.  The order isn't hard: it's the 5 Spice Chicken Salad with the dressing on the side.  \n\nMishap #1 started on my delivery order where it was missing all the garnishments like crispy wontons, shallots, and peanuts.  Not a huge deal, but I definitely think those things add to deliciousness of the salad.\n\nIt wouldn't be awful, except that...there was another mishap.\n\nMishap #2 happened yesterday when I stopped in for a quick bite to eat (and incredibly grateful they were open).  Again, same salad order.  As my food was placed in front of me, I look at and realize that something's not right: it's missing chicken.  Yep. It was just a plain salad.  I walked my bowl back up to the counter and asked where the chicken was, and rather than apologizing, they took my bowl back, threw some chicken on AND was unnecessarily heavy-handed in the wonton strips on top of the chicken and then handed back to me.  The guy sort of laughed off the incident, but honestly, I didn't really find it funny.\n\nIn any case, I still love Bun Mee and I will continue to come back here because I love their 5 spice chicken so much.

I don't understand why there's such low and negative reviews on this place. The sandwich I had was really good! It was the combo sandwich, which consisted of pork and......pate (pat-tay)! It did look small, but it was stuffed with a decent amount of fillings! The veggies were fresh and the meat was so flavorful and appetizing. Not dry at all. It may look hard to eat, but it was nice and crunchy, but soft in the inside of the bread. 7-8 bucks for the sandwich, but it was so worth it to me. They also have options for vegetarians, Oh, and don't go without ordering sweet potato fries, which they give you a lot of for 3 bucks! Seasoned with salt and pepper with yummy savory sauce on the side.\n\nAs for the service......AWESOME. They bring your food to you if you eat in. The cashier  offered to bring my sandwich to the table we were about to go change our seat at. There's also someone who clears your food/trash right away once you're done! Such fast service! Definitely coming to this place again, if I crave for vietnamese sandwiches around this area, but probably not if there are other places that offer them for cheaper like they normally are.", "author": "Tina R."}

I had just finished drinks with my mom and her friend up the street at Rickhouse when I ran into my friend and we went to grab a quick dinner. We started walking toward the Westfield to check out the vast food court, but then I spotted Bun Mee and remembered I'd been wanting to try it.\n\nOff the bat, it gave me the generic up-and-coming vibe that I have been getting from other Financial Dist eateries (360 Burrito Express, Mixt Greens, Verde, etc) so I was a little turned off. What ever happened to mom 'n pop shops? Rent, I suppose. The whole place feels a bit stale.\n\nAnyhow, we both got the Five Spice Chicken bahn mi and an order of the Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries. It was around $18 for the whole meal, which I think is pricey for bahn mi, and I don't think you would disagree with me. The sandwiches were just OK, nothing special and the meat was honestly pretty gristly and lacking flavor. The \"Garlic\" Fries had more onions and jalepenos than I would think come on garlic fries. They were alright, nothing spesh, and odd that there was no garlic to be found.\n\nA large red beam behind the cash register claims that every sandwich is served with jalepenos and if you don't eat them you're sissy (good one) but I asked for extra jalepenos, and was given maybe four slices on my whole sandwich. It's become customary for me to just ask no less than three times for extra jalepenos, which makes me feel like a dick, but whatevs. I will say I appreciate that they have a big bottle of Sriracha on every table so you don't have to run all over the place trying to obtain the spicy sauce.\n\nWill I be back?

Stopped in and instantly was drawn in by the decor; Awesome modern wallpaper and cool dangling lights. Also playing was some seriously funky hip hop and r&b, which got me in a great mood after being stuck at a cube all day. *insert sprinkler dance here*\n\nThey have happy hour from 3-6 and the prices are much more fair. I think regular prices are a little too high. I ordered a combo banh mi and chilli cheese fries.... \n\nThe sandwich: $5 (happy hour price). decent sized. Really warm and toasty French bread. Usually French bread is really stiff but it was very easy to bite into. It came with ham, beef and pate. There was only two really thin slices of ham but it was overflowing with beef. The meat had a special kick that made it different from traditional viet sandos. It was kind of like a mix of BBQ beef and carne asada flavor. There was a perfect amount of pickled carrots and daikon so it didn't overpower the flavor of the meat. Overall, I give it a 4 out of 5.\n\nThe fries: $3 (happy hour price) crispy, every one of them. Normally a lot will be soggy after a while but these were great. The chilli was really interesting...pretty different from any I've tried before. I believe they add lemon grass in it. Sounds kind of weird but it was actually added a really cool kick. It also had tons of ground beef and jalape\u00f1os and the size was fair. I give it a 3 1/2 out of 5 because I still like traditional chili better.\n\nThe service: this has more of a fast food feel  but at least they bring your food to your table. The person who brought out the food had great customer service. He was very pleasant smiled a lot and thanked us when he brought the food and when he picked it up.

Last night, two of my best girl friends and I, ended up sitting at the table right in between the menu on the right wall, and people lining up along the left wall to place their orders.  I happened to be facing the left wall, and so tried my best to quiet my super self-conscious inner tween.  \"It's ok, Iona.  All these strangers are not judging you for stuffing five fries into your mouth at once.  No, they're not disgusted at the sight of half-masticated bits and pieces of lemongrass pork falling from your gaping pie-hole.\"  Vicious.\n\nSelf-talk aside, I enjoyed catching up with my friends over our $7 banh mis, and $4 shared side of salt 'n pepper garlic fries.  All of us knew that we were paying twice as much for the sandwiches, but this joint is right on Market Street in downtown SF.  Let's not even speculate on what they're paying for rent.\n\nThe bread does not scrape the roof of your mouth, the meat (lemongrass pork for me!) is flavorful, the jalapenos and cilantro come sprinkled on top of all the pickled carrots and daikon (do chua) so it's easy to brush off if you forgot to modify your order... but the do chua was just too sour for me.  Every other time I've gotten banh mi at some mom and pop, or at Lee's, the carrots and daikon had a better, in my opinion at least, sugar to vinegar ratio.  The veggies here gave me an experience on par with the first 10-seconds of a Warhead candy.  Bru-tal.  They really give you a thick layer of the stuff, so I just saved my face some fine-line creating moments and scraped most of it off.  (Note: If you order your banh mi to go, they give you much less do chua so that they can wrap it all nice and neat.  Yes, you are, in a sense, getting jipped... but that's probably the proper ratio of the sour stuff anywho.)\n\nThe man at the front who took my order gave me the option of going without jalapenos on my fries, but I was feeling daring so I told him to keep them in there.  Honestly, they didn't really impart much flavor or heat to the fries.  Moreover, I don't think the fries had much of a salt 'n pepper flava anyhow.  Totes not a memorable side dish.  I will probably skip this and save myself $4 next time around.\n\nAll in all, Bun Mee is a decent lunch and dinner option.  It's pretty fast, there's indoor and outdoor seating, and your meal should cost you between $8-15 depending on whether you just go with banh mi, or if you'd like sides, drinks, etc.  I really love the interior (the lighting especially!) and it was a pretty great spot to just sit and chill for dinner Tuesday night.", "author": "Iona C."}

I know, it's kinda unfair, but if I'm going to get, for example, a banh mi, my first thought wouldn't be to go to the financial district to look for a good banh mi spot. However, after being tempted by the very cheery facade time and again, I finally stopped in today to see what all the lines going out the door were all about.\n\nMiraculously, during the lunch rush I managed to be second in line, which didn't give me much time to peruse the sizable menu (plus I wanted to see what noodles people around me were slurping up and making look very delicious), but I settled quickly on the 5 spice chicken banh mi with jalape\u00f1os, an order of the egg rolls, and an iced tea. It's extremely loud near the counter so the girl got my name wrong, which caused a bit of confusion during the pick-up process, but otherwise the very hectic atmosphere in here is more organized than it seems. \n\nHad I known the iced tea came with lemon slices in it I would've asked them to not put them in my tea before it gave my drink just a hint of that sour that you can feel in the back of your throat that I hate, but otherwise the iced tea has a great flavor that seems almost like it's got a hint of fruitiness. As for the banh mi? Wow. Just delicious. I didn't come here expecting what I've had in Vietnamese banh mi shops, but this was very tasty in it's own right. Not only is the amount of chicken generous, which I frankly wasn't expecting, but the sandwich is by no means skimpy in its size, and the mix of fresh veggies, jalape\u00f1o, and cilantro were right on point. But the star for me - and yes, I can't believe they outshone the sandwich itself - were the egg rolls. I couldn't get enough of them, and the fact that they're diagonally sliced into two pieces per roll makes eating them at your desk easier. I'm not saying the sandwich was at all bad, I just found myself wanting the egg rolls even more because they were that good.\n\nI would love to eat here all the time. The problem was the price tag: over $15 for my meal. Granted, the size, freshness, and quality of everything can't be denied, but there's no way I'd spend that much for lunch on myself everyday. This is maybe a once to twice a week splurge, but as good as everything was I wouldn't want to pay that much every time. \n\nReally great food, fast service even despite the mass of people waiting for lunch, but the price tag for just one person knocks off a star for me - if I can get a quality, authentic, banh mi the same size, if not bigger, with even more meat for a fraction of the price in a hole in the wall, maybe Bun Mee can try, too.

My box lunches were such a hassle and ordeal and just totally unappealing that I told myself I was going to treat myself to an awesome lunch to make up for it.  Bun Mee did not disappoint!\n\nI ordered the lemongrass pork bun me and an order of garlic fries.  I was so looking forward to this meal.  There is seating in the restaurant, and even a few tables outside but it was in the direct sun and SF was having a freak heat wave.  I walked over towards Yerba Buena Gardens to find a better picnic spot.  I was going crazy because the smells were wafting and I could only manage a few fries so I just kept walking faster!\n\nOne interesting thing is that the jalepeno chilis were so powerful in the sandwich that I had to pick most of it off as my lips were on fire.  But the same chilis in the fries did nothing for the flavor.  The fries definitely could have used a kick.  I should have dropped the picked off chilis into the fries but gave up.  It was a very yummy meal!", "author": "Maria K."}

They have a small outdoor seating area and an array of tables inside their brick and mortar for you to sit. It's a bit of a squeeze though, especially during the lunch hour when there are lots of patrons from the Financial district and people ordering to-go. It can be a little crowded, but the table turnover is pretty quick. \n\nFOOD\nThe menu isn't overly complicated, but offers plenty of options to customize your order with various add-ons like substituting your meat, adding an egg, etc. Each of these add-ons has a cost, and they can pile up pretty quick. Their menu is split between Sandwiches, Bowls, & Salads - and any sides you might want. While the menu variety is great, the food is only a little above average. They have the right idea, but are a little rough in the execution. Nothing is mind blowing, but it's all quality food. Having said that, I don't think it's worth the price you pay. Maybe I'm just not used to SF pricing yet (I'm from Austin, TX), but $13 for a B+ grade noodle bowl is a little excessive. Still though, I recommend getting the Belly Bun and the \n\nSERVICE\nNot much to say about the service. If you order to-go, you just wait for them to call your name. They have a runner who brings your food if you decide to take a seat in the cramped quarters.\n\nFINAL TAKE\nPretty expensive for what I considered to be fairly average Vietnamese food. Better off going somewhere else for lunch and saving your Vietnamese craving for a really good sit down meal.", "author": "Zi-on C."}

The noodle bowls seem a little on the higher side when in comes to price (usually ends up somewhere around $13 based upon my lunch companions purchases).  Thats for noodles, when by comparison, I get a lot more pork in my sandwich for about 60% of the price.  Also, I had the combo sandwich once.  It was just ok (chewy meat, chewy bread, kind of hard to eat).  I'll pass on it from here on out. \n\nI have yet to try the happy hour, but it looks like a deal from the posted prices.

I hate to be writing about this place with my low experiences, because getting a bahn mi should also be enjoyable.\n\nI've visited here three separate times, all with the hope that the previous low experience was just a fluke, and that a great sandwich experience was awaiting me! But no. No way. Just blobfish- I mean, average sandwiches. Here are my recaps of my visits- all done during the big lunchtime crowds...\n\nFirst meal: The Bun Mee Combo. That can best be summed up with two words: dry bread. You'd need a healthy smothering of sauce (be it Sriracha, an aioli, or what have you) to revive the staleness of their sandwich bread. The pat\u00e9 was very tasty, thankfully, so it was worth it to chuck the bread and save all the other ingredients for what was, I guess, a carb-free meal.\n\nSecond meal: Grilled Five Spice Chicken. What spice? Is it in the caramel mayo? Nope. This was slightly better, since the bread was not stale, but overall another disappointing experience.\n\nThird meal: Grilled Lemongrass Pork. It really wasn't any different/ better/ worse than other bahn mis I've had in SF, and those other ones are cheaper.

Today met a pal for lunch and we walked over to give Bun Mee a try.  I was craving a Bahn Mi, instead I opted for my litmus test for any Vietnamese place, bun bowl/salad.  I ordered the lemongrass pork.  For what I am sure is a busy spot, they've got the service thing down well, the wait was not long for our to-go orders.  The salad looked attractive and was heavy in my hand.  We walked over to a spot to sit and eat and dug in.  The roll was packed tight with ground meet and no noodles that I could find.  Using regular egg roll wrapper rather than a rice wrapper, it was essentially flavorless.  The nuoc mam that accompanied the salad was really weak flavored.  The pork was generous, but, I tasted no hint of lemongrass. Vietnamese food is all about the freshness and strong flavors that make your mouth sing.  I got none of that.  The pork was not grilled, not that I could tell.  There was a big pile of rice noodle and some romaine lettuce (3 pieces of the stalk/root end, btw), the pickled veg were bland.  The rice noodle was very wet and oily (which was a surprise).   No herbs like mint/basil or cilantro that I could see or taste.  Again, this is my test for a decent Vietnamese place, I felt that this is what it would taste like if you bought a pre-packed salad at Safeway.

I'm a regular at Lee's Sandwiches and the Vietnamese sandwich spot on Larkin in SF. The sandwich bread was OK, what really did it for me was the meat.  When you order a combo anywhere else what you get deli style meat slices that you would find in a regular Sandwich. This limits the taste of a Vietnamese sandwich, making the pate stand out. Here my combo was well balanced, the pork had good seasoning and the carrots tasted fresh. The sweet potatoes fries with Red Curry Mayo is a WINNER in book. I can have this sauce with anything. I seriously went back and got more sauce so I can dip the fries and coat them with it. Who would have thought this these two would work so good together. Well done.

The chicken was way better to me. I think it was the caramel sauce they put on it. It was more juicy and flavorful, but don't be thrown off by the mention of caramel (as I was the first time I came in); it's just a hint of sweetness which plays well with the pickled veggies and the jalape\u00f1os. The bread is awesome! Very crispy and soaks up the juices well. The Lemongrass Pork wasn't bad at all... just felt like it was missing something... Can't decide what, though. Tried their fries too, but those were just eh. Not worth it if you ask me. \n\nThe one thing about these sandwiches is they need more KICK! I have to load up on the sriracha to get that heat I love.

The fries, on the other hand, are not a good option for delivery. The ones I had at the restaurant location are crisp and hot, while these were lukewarm and soggy, probably a side-effect of delivery. I wouldn't recommend ordering them since there's so many other things that are good here. We had a range of sandwiches, as well as two types of spring roll wraps. Everything was pretty awesome.\n\nWhy only three stars though? Well, our order was screwed up. Not just one sandwich but at least four were incorrect. We had two crispy tofu sandwiches *without* jalapenos, while every other sandwich was standard. What we got were the tofu sandwiches with jalapenos and two of the other sandwiches were missing theirs. The stickers on the wrapper indicated exactly what we ordered, our order sheet said the same thing, but yet our sandwiches were definitely incorrect. While it's fixable by removing the jalapenos from the tofu sandwiches and passing them over to those who wanted them, it's still annoying and frustrating, as the flavour stuck on my sandwich. \n\nFrom a few other reviews, screwups seem to be in the norm for this location.

Just make the food taste good. Chipotle isn't authentic Mexican, but the burritos and tacos are decent enough. Bun Mee isn't authentic AND it doesn't taste good. The garlic rice was really mushy and reminded me of mashed potatoes. After I ate the dish my mouth had a dull numbness that you get after eating under cooked garlic.

This same amount of ingredients at a typical Vietnamese shop wouldn't be a problem.\n\nEverything tasted stale as if it had been prepped many hours beforehand.

However the service is lightning fast and the guys and gals working the line are pushing out sammiches at a frenetic pace so the line moves quickly.\n\nTastewise, it's great. I wouldn't really classify these as vietnames sandwiches - they're wholly different and a bit heavier. The bread isn't the same sort of crusty, airy baguette that  B\u00e1nh m\u00ec usually come in, and the fillings aren't your standard pho joint fare - ranging from meatballs to sloppy joes to catfish po'boys.

Eggplant skin is tough to separate, so with one bite, you end up taking the entire \"meat\" of the sandwich. The flavor was decent enough. I would probably order this again. \n\nThe combo: not special at all. All the different flavor a we're competing with each other. It honestly was pretty bland considering it had mortadella in it. \n\nThe Belly Bun on the other hand, was a greasy salt sandwich. The entire thing was so greasy it soaked through the bread. Then it was so salty, I downed an entire glass of water after a few bites. I took the other half home and ate it with rice. The fat to meat ratio was also very disappointing. It was mostly meat, not much fat at all. \n\nI would be a lot forgiving if the fillings and bread were better quality. The bread wasn't crispy on the outside, nor was it soft on the inside. It was just stale-ish. The do chua (daikon and carrots) was also bland. It wasn't sour enough. I recommend either pickling it longer, or using a smaller cut. \n\nPrice: $7 for crappy sandwich?

The grilled pork tasted fine but the contrast of textures was very off putting, i know what they are trying to accomplish but it simply does not work. \n\nWhat makes a Bahn mi so amazing is the contrast of the bread the meat and the pickled veggies in this case the bread is so-so and the pickled veggies were crap. They are not sweet at all like they should be and are instead just vinegary as hell and ruin the entire sandwich.

Had the Juicy Steak but subbed out the lime pepper mayo for the garlic mayo and that was an excellent decision. The sandwich was fairly large so I only ate half- it was overflowing with meat, jalapenos, onions, etc. Super tasty and filled me up. I also got the salt & pepper garlic fries and they were delicious. Clearly the theme of this place is jalapenos because they're in practically every dish, which I'm not complaining about. If you like a little kick, on top of well developed flavors, this is worth checking out. \n\nWord to the wise: 12p-1p is crazy busy, yet when we were walking out just after 1p, the line had cleared out and it was less hectic.

I have always liked the Fillmore location, but it's too tough for me to get to most times. So when I saw they had opened downtown, I was excited that I could get my banh mi fix on my lunch break. First off, the inside is super cool, with awesome graffiti art and these funky wires and light bulbs dangling in the space and great music! Totally different from Fillmore, but seems right for the energy of Market St. \n\nI was there kinda late for lunch, about 1:45-2, and while there was a bit of a line, it moved fast--encouraging, because I know how long the waits at some of the other restaurants nearby can be. The staff was really friendly and helpful too--they even thanked me by name when they brought me my lunch. Nice touch.\n\nI went outside of my normal order  (belly bun w/ egg) and got the catfish roll, fries and a strawberry lychee drink. My banh mi was damn near perfect--you have to have the right bread, and the right ratio of stuff to that bread, and Bun Mee nailed it--plus the fried catfish was crisp but not greasy. Only knock was that I asked for extra jalape\u00f1os, but if they were there, I couldn't taste them, so I stole a couple off my fries and remedied the situation! \n\nSince I was dining alone, I \"may\" have eavesdropped on the table next to me talking about a secret menu. How did I not know this? ? Must find out what this entails! Well, I can add it to my list of  reasons to come back! \n\nAll in all a great experience, and I am excited to have them downtown.", "author": "John R."}

I decided to try the lemongrass pork sandwich which was ok but not great. All of the meat was on one side, with the veggies on the other side which made getting a bite with both impossible. I had to put tons of sriracha on it to add flavor because there was much more bread than meat or filling. The flavor of the pork was actually really good but there wasn't a whole lot on the sandwich which was disappointing. I ended up having the butts of the sandwich completely filling-less, which made the already small-ish sandwich seem not very satisfying.\n\nI would try this place again but maybe opt for one of the bowls to get a good second meal out of it.

The bun was way off, tasting and feeling mostly like a hot dog bun and not like the more traditional french roll. If there was mayo, or sauce of any kind, I could not taste it. Though the bun was wet with what could easily have been water, given the flavor. They must de-seed their jalapenos because there was barely this slightest hint of spiciness, which is just a terrible thing to do, especially for an optional topping. \n\nIf you want a Vietnamese sandwich, look elsewhere, as this taste nothing like what you're accustomed to. If you're looking for just a good sandwich in general, you can easily find one in the area that provides more flavor.", "author": "Phil D."}

I found it overall to be quite lacklustre, it didn't have the flavours that I was looking for, nor was there a great quantity of food in the bowl. The second time around I got a sandwich (chicken), and added extra meat to it. The sandwich was a much better experience compared with the bowl. I think the extra meat really helped to enhance the sandwich, as a few other that I went with noted that there wasn't enough meat in their sandwiches without the extra meat. Overall, if you are looking for something quick and are in the area, perhaps give Bun Mee a try but there are definitely better alternatives in the area.", "author": "David C."}

We can feign that we only dig legit banh mi from the likes of Saigon Sandwich, but this more refined space + business is an impressive update on the classic cheaper-than-you-can-believe sandwich. Let's face it, we like when where we eat is clean. The Bun Mee brand represents just this: modern, open spaces, an open kitchen. The quality of the product is high. If you can't justify paying $6 or so for banh mi, order the bowl. It's delicious and hefty. It's almost like whomever chose to create this place just loves Viet culture and wanted to bring it to a different part of SF, and they're doing it in successful fashion. Is it Saigon or Dinosaurs?

Very friendly and quick. Waited about 7 minutes for food, there were 3 other people waiting for food ahead of me and it looked like they were preparing a large to go order as well.\nDecor is awesome, love the naked Edison bulbs and the typographic centric artwork. \n\nFirst one: Grilled five spice chicken with caramel mayo, shaved onion, pickled carrot & daikon, cucumber, jalape\u00f1os, and cilantro ($6.25). \nAte 10 minutes after receiving. Sweetness of the caramel mayo was a nice addition in theory but not enough to make a noticeable impact overall. Chicken itself was under seasoned. \n\nSecond one: Belly Bun: Braised Kurobuta pork belly, salted radish relish, shaved onion, pickled carrot and daikon, cucumber, jalape\u00f1os, cilantro. ($6.75)\nAte 5 hours later for dinner. Integrity of the sandwich held up hours later. The salted radish relish is delicious, just enough salty goodness to compliment but not overwhelm the pork belly, which was nicely cooked. I would definitely order this again!\n\nIngredients were fresh and good quality. Good bread to meat to fix in' ratio. Smaller and more expensive than your traditional banh mi, but delicious nonetheless.

I have one question, you hungry.. or nah? \nI don't ever, ever expect authenticity from any Asian place that looks remotely fusion. And I'm not a huge fan of most Vietnamese cuisine (even though I'm part Vietnamese, imagine that) but I LOVE a good bahn mi. And while I wasn't expecting a super authentic sandwhich, I was expecting something that at least tasted good. I didn't look at the reviews before I went. I just knew it was right next door to  my work and I was extremely hungry. When you walk in there's a sign that says something about jalapenos and if you don't get them on your sandwich then you're a sissy. which was funny because there were no jalapenos on my sandwich. And since I can eat spicy....I really wanted them. I got the belly sandwich or something, and I had to add pate for an extra dollar....fine. But when I pay for something...I expect it to have it. So 13 bucks later and I finished my soggy sandwich filled with pretty everything (and by everthing I mean pickled veggies...so really is was just really just sour-y, vinegar-y bread) but what I ordered. I'm confused about how I feel because, I think I'm still hungry...but my stomach feels like its full. Whatever feeling it is, I'm definitely  not satisfied..", "author": "Asia W."}

However, the fried eggrolls, which I was hoping would be great. are horrible. They taste like frozen fried aged rolls filled with mushy beef rather than pork and they had absolutely no herbal flavor or tender noodle texture inside. \nThe mango salad was wilted and bland - just shredded napa cabbage and a few mango diced pieces - wheres the basil and cilantro? The sesame? Not nearly enough to call this Vietnamese. \nI really wanted to like this place but the mushy dark pork and the lack of lighter herbal flavors make it taste unlike Vietnamese food at all. More like frozen supermarket food or old cafeteria food. \nThe hallmark of Vietnamese food is lightness from fresh aromatic herbs as well as moisture from pickled condiments in the banh mi and in the salads. Even Vietnamese beef jerky is a mixture of sweet and salty without a heaviness.

I'll be adding this to my list of weekday lunch stops.", "author": "Cameron P."}

I feel sorry for the people who have to work here.  Line for lunch was almost out the door and it's tight because there is only one way in and out.  But Line moved fast and food came fast.  I had the grilled pork bun bowl with a limeade.  Food looked appetizing, fresh and colorful.  Rice noodles not as thin as I like them and definitely not as plentiful as every other place, which might be a plus for someone trying to avoid carbs.  Cut to the chase.  Taste was lacking.  Just wasn't there.  And I missed the ground peanuts that normally come on this dish at virtually every other restaurant I've gotten it at.  Worst of all, there was chicken bits in with the pork.  At first the only reason I noticed is because the texture was different, which tells you just how tasteless it was.  Then I looked closer and realized there were a few bits of grilled chicken mixed in with my pork.  And then I realized there was something funny about the texture of the chicken.  Don't know what that was about, didn't care since I wanted to be eating tasty grilled pork.  Also had the limeade.  Was way too sweet and tasted quite a bit like they squeezed it out of one of those green plastic limes from the grocery store.  Also note that if you want to go someplace and sit down to eat, likely it won't be here because seating is minimal.  Don't know why anyone would tarry long here anyway with the noise level. Won't be coming back here unless every other Vietnamese restaurant within walking distance of my office is close and then I will go to Lee's anyway.", "author": "Tonia C."}

Love the decor as it is eye popping and original.  The food is consistent with Fillmore and friendly service.  Love their sloppy bun, garlic fries and the egg rolls. They are getting their kinks out but you will enjoy their quality sandwiches and their lovely ambience.", "author": "Ina K."}

Big minus = music is too loud so it's hard to order your food/hear your name when your order's ready while space is limited when waiting for your food so you're standing on top of each other. If they would lower the music, use a microphone and re-arrange space...everything would be great for 5 stars.", "author": "Robyn R."}

She said \"oh we don't have your food, it must have gone out.\" \"No, I haven't ordered yet, I wanted to make sure you deliver to our area first before placing my order.\" \"Yes, we deliver to your office.\" \"Oh, do you want our address first, so you can check?\" She finally said yes and then told us it would be easier to order online. I went online to order and when I finished up our order, it told me it couldn't process it because they didn't deliver to our address. Awesome. So I called back, talked to a guy who asked me to email our order, so I did that. 25 minutes later and no email response, my coworker called them to make sure our order was placed and they had no idea what she was talking about.  They finally figured it out and said it would be here shortly. It did arrive (by a very nice delivery guy), but we hadn't paid yet, and he had no idea about that and had no way to process payment.  I was finally able to give my payment over the phone, and when we got back to the office, the 2 sandwiches that had special requests (no onions, etc) were regular ones with no sauce at all and we're all that great :( It was pretty disappointing since we were all craving bahn mi so bad that day!", "author": "Sheena C."}

Ordered the lemon grass pork sandwich with pate.  The bread was decent but I wish it was toasted.  The meat wash very tasty but the pickled veggies were so bland they spoiled an otherwise decent sandwich.  Despite the bad veggies I'd give the place three stars for the yummy meat if the sandwich was not so overpriced.  Do yourself a favor and pick up a real banh mi for $4.50 in the tenderloin.  Oh, the restaurant looks cool, I'll give them that.", "author": "Martin B."}

After picking up my order and taking it home, I realized that they had left the pork out completely.  You get two spring rolls per order and they cut them in half - making 4 half pieces.  Two of the half pieces of the spring roll didn't even have shrimp in it.  Such a disappointment as I was really looking forward to eating it.", "author": "Emily L."}

It had very little flavor, big chewy pieces of fat, and tasted like it was boiled instead of grilled.  The place was a mad house, very loud, pushing and shoving, no place to wait for a to go order, and over priced.  On top of the premium price, they also add on a fee for healthy San Francisco.  Avoid this place and go almost anywhere else for a better bahn mi for at least $2 less.  I will never return to this place.", "author": "mark f."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-03-28", "description": "With a drink and a sandwich my bill was around 12 bucks - to which I felt compelled to add a 2 dollar tip.  Ouch, that's double my typical lunch cost.  The veggies and meat were good, the bread was passable.  I paid the extra dollar to have a swipe of p\u00e2t\u00e9 with my lemongrass pork.  The flavor was all there, though the p\u00e2t\u00e9 appeared to have some intact organs instead of being fully \"pasted\".  Par for the SF course, an assembly line of un-asian, jeans wearing, tatooed and pierced teens were slapping my Vietnamese style sandwich together.  One particularly cute little blonde girl busily rushed orders out to tables and handed out the to go orders.  It looked like a fairly efficient operation as they jammed through the FiDi lunch crowd that had lined up behind me (I just beat the main rush).  Taste wise I could give it 4 stars, since  by local comparison - there are some truly bad sannies made in this neighborhood.  It certainly beats the snot out of Lee's.  With the high cost though, I can't really justify a return trip and will have to knock it down to 3 stars.  Vespa scooter stickers on the sandwich wrapper were a nice touch though.", "author": "Ho H."}

I ordered the Juicy Steak but was left incredibly disappointed, the sandwich was very messy, the steak was very chewy (and not juicy at all); the first bite was ok but I got bored of the sandwich very quickly since it just lacked the flavor I was looking for and didn't end up finishing it. I had also ordered the salt and pepper garlic fries which I thought were simply terrible, soggy fries and way too much salt. Went there with a friend who had the Grilled Lemongrass Pork and he came to the same conclusion as me, bland sandwich and bad fries. If you want a tasty Banh Mi that is also affordable, stick to the tenderloin.", "author": "Ed H."}

Only 2 registers were open and although there was just one person ahead of me, it seemed to take longer than it should. I do agree it is a little loud - you have to pay attention or you will miss your name being called out when your food is ready. I ordered the crispy fish sandwich.  Fish was tasty but not crispy at all. Bread was dense and chewy, I would have prepared a little softer roll with a crusty exterior. The sandwich was a little small. The ratio of bread to the other ingredients seemed wrong. Perhaps I am thinking of Saigon Sandwich? No comparison of course and by the look of things a welcome addition to the neighborhood.I plan to try the other sandwiches before I decide if it is going to be a regular stop.", "author": "rojak g."}
