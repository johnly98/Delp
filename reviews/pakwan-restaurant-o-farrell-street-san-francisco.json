Thus, it is not as crowded as the Halal Guys .. :P .. a few 100 meters away but at the main road.\nJokes apart, if they all put an equal effort to maintain the ambiance and sitting and a few other things .. without a shadow of doubt, with the food they cook, they would become a fan favourite to a lot others .. not just the Indians and Pakistanis and Curry eaters but also to a lot of eager beavers :)\n\nSo we ordered 2 curries .. one was lamb and the other chicken .. the former was called \"Achar Gosht\" achar = pickle gosht = meat .. the other was \"karahi chicken\" karahi = name of a vessel :) .. \nBoth the curries were really really good .. the texture in the meats and the flavors in the curries were just right.\nLoved them.\nThe naan bread were absolutely lovely ..

After trying Shalimar and then Chutney, I decided to try Pakwan. Pakwan is located in the heart of the hood so apart from letting you know that you have to basically ignore panhandlers on your way here and back, I'm going to spare you other details.\n\nAt the peak dinner hour unlike Shalimar & Chutney Pakwan seemed to be pretty empty with a lot of open tables. This seemed strange and I almost walked out but changed my mind at the last minute and decided to try it out. To keep things simple, I decided to get what I had got at Chutney a couple of days ago namely the Chicken Tikka Masala ($9.99) and a couple of plain naan ($1.50) to-go. After ordering as I sat at one of the empty tables I did notice that the place was cleaner than both Shalimar and Chutney and seemed like a regular restaurant that was cleaned periodically. Wait time was also not much and I was out in under 10 minutes. The restaurant is self-service so you basically pick up your desired silverware from the counter before you leave.\n\nTaste is where Pakwan was a failure. The chicken tikka masala was essentially pieces of boiled chicken in a tomato puree. No exaggeration just cubed boiled chicken and a tomato sauce that did not even have enough spices to hide the sweet tomato taste. The naan was extremely soft and could have used a little more time in the tandoor, which made it extremely chewy. A couple of bites into this meal it was clear to me why this place was half empty while Shalimar and Chutney were packed to capacity. The food simply does not compare to the other two. This seemed to be made by amateur cooks who were trying to make something off a recipe that they did not understand or care to learn about. \n\nPrice wise Pakwan was 30% more expensive than Shalimar and 15% more expensive than Chutney but the food was not even in the same league as Shalimar or Chutney. Goes without saying I have no intention of returning to Pakwan and will stick with Chutney and Shalimar for my Pakistani/Indian food fix in the hood.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

I asked if I could just get refunded the amount, upon which the cashier tried to assure me the samosas are gluten-free. After leaving the restaurant, I looked them up and, sure enough, samosas are wheat-based ...

I had never tried the Tenderloin location before because I was usually finished with a meal by the time I saw it or in a hurry to get home and not in the mood to dawdle on this stretch of Jones if you know what I mean. And I think you do. Anyhow, I just happened to feel peckish enough one evening to stop into a nearly empty restaurant. Formica tables were a bit in a disarray, but I made my way through to the front counter where the server appeared indifferent to my presence.\n\nRegardless, I plunged ahead and gave my order. Since I didn't see my standby Bhindi Masala on the menu, I went for the $6.99 Bengan Bhartha, which was a specialty dish, eggplant cooked with onions and tomatoes (photo: http://bit.ly/29ePXoj). Pretty tasty if a bit soupy that it took a lot of careful spooning of the $1.99 Basmati Rice to get the slightly mushy eggplant into my mouth without major spillage issues arising (photo: http://bit.ly/29kJIwc). For my main, I ordered the $12.99 Tandoori Lamb Chops, which were marinated in a special spice mix that brought out the tandoori char in the meat (photo: http://bit.ly/29q71a9).\n\nOnce again, it was just pretty good as the portions were a bit on the paltry side for the price and the lamb a tad too dry to provide complete satisfaction. A complimentary glass of Masala Tea provided a bit of compensation but not nearly enough (photo: http://bit.ly/29jyLgT). In the meantime, Tenderloin regulars came in and out with their orders, although interestingly, very few of them stayed and sat down to eat here. After all, this is a working class Pakistani-Indian diner, not a dining destination to tell your friends in Pac Heights to hop into their Teslas to get to.

To a point that I'd plan my work/personal trip around this area so I can stay close by and eat here!! It's no secret that I loveee the food from here. I'm pretty sure almost everyone that knows me know about this spot. They are pretty magic!\n\nCame to this place on a Saturday morning after we arrived in the city. It was empty! And it is byob so we came prepared with our own bottle of wine and such!\n\nAmbiance- much smaller than mission location. \nSelf-serve place with smaller kitchen. They call your number, you go get your food. So you definitely need to have a table especially if you want to order many dishes like me.The menus are at the counter- it's cash only!  \n\nFood-\nThere may or may not have been a vegetarian section on the menu but seriously? Who'd look at it when you have so many amazing meat choices. \nThey have kebobs, chicken /beef/lamb curries, biryanis (chicken, mutton) and $1 chai!! Zomg. So many to choose. It is also a mixture of North Indian and South Indian food. Talk about the best of both world. \n\n1. Biryani - it was well spiced! So tasty and spicy!! Need to be a little hotter in temp but it was tasty!!Two non indians including me tolerated that spice really well, if not loved it.\n\n2. Kabobs- nicely spiced. Tasty with loads of fresh onions and jalapenos.\n3. Chicken curry  - with jalapenos and fresh ginger slices on top. This was probably the spiciest dish we had on the table.\n4. Nihari with lamb shank- yummmm! This one came with a huge lamb shank. Again, so well spiced that curry is. Nice, thick, tasty with a kick. \n\nThe portions were nice and big. Massive even!! And the best part- they were all around $9-$11 per entr\u00e9e. I mean, wow! I'd probably skip the super spicy chicken next time. Or try a dish chicken dish but the rest were totally point on and mind blowing. \n\nDid I mention that they give you a pile of peppers with every dish? It's like an added bonus heat to already nicely spiced dishes. Actual spicy peppers. So hot, you wont stop eating! Yes, SF has so many Indian restaurants and yes, you can find amazing biryani else where. But since I've had their food in Mission, I've been hooked. And this place actually delivers for free. I've been there during a cold chilly spring time and didn't want to walk to this area, they delivered it.\n\nMinus one star for location/ambiance and for the service.

The food flavor was great, but both he and I got a stomach ache afterwards from having their chicken curry special of the day and the lamb biryani. \n\nWhile I was there, a homeless lady came in through the door, and took a soda off the remains of an empty table from some people who left. It is likely that the restaurant would have thrown away the soda, but they actually sent a guy outside to wrestle the soda out from her hands. She came in and asked for the soda again because they were going to toss it out, and they basically roughhoused her outside until her pants fell and she came crying in the restaurant again and ended up taking another customer's soda. She became belligerent and yelled out that she just wanted the soda but the staff was rude and continued to what I would say abuse her and handle her roughly (physically).\n\nThis left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. As much as I understand how a business in the tenderloin needs to protect themselves and give a good experience to their customers, I don't really think that this was a great way to handle this particular situation.

Also, there were a ton of take out orders which was slowing down the food being cooked for in house customers. Probably took 30-40 minutes to get food which was understandable under the circumstances. \n\nAs others have mentioned probably not very sanitary or clean so if that's what you're looking for stay away.", "author": "Saadiya R."}

Naan is well made and the accompaniments are flavorful and more than enough for one person! I usually have some left over for lunch the next day as well.\n\nAs for the service, I am more than happy with it. They are prompt with delivery.

I couldn't tell what it was and I became too scared to find out. I called them to let them know. I figured I could take care of it with them directly than to post something on yelp. They decided to refund me for just the chicken tikka masala. If  I wanted to, I could have really gotten to the bottom of this and really sued them for what could have been a beetle or some other dead creature. I decided to leave this review on Yelp because I am convinced never ever to go eat here and to be aware of most places you eat. It's not clean, they are after the money. Obviously if they cared about their business, they would have compensated me more than just the cost of the Chicken. I had a horrible and very scary experience and want to warn everyone of this place. Beware!!", "author": "Krisha C."}

I went with a friend of mine whose been to India and he said that their Biryani is legit.  I personally loved it.  The portion is enough for 2 people and it's only $9.75.  A great deal.  The rest of their dishes are pretty average.  I was disappointed in their curries and their masalas.  The meats were bland and the sauces lacked the deep indian spices and were kind of on the thinner side.  Their naan breads, except for their Lamb Kulchas were dry and lacked the taste as some other great indian joints I've discovered in the Tenderloin.  I will go back for the Biryani alone but I would not go there if I'm craving let's say Chicken Korma and garlic naan.  There are way better places all with in walking distance.", "author": "Joey S."}

I have had some killer food but horrible service that makes up for my 1 star review.  I have to say that Pakwan on 16th I have never had a problem with but this restaurant in particular screwed it up big time.\n\nI had placed an order on grubhub.com.  For those of you who don't know what it is, it's basically an app that tells you who delivers close to your home.  Anywho, after I placed my order the application states that the delivery time is estimated at 50mins.  This is typical and I understand it takes some time to process the order, prep, cook and deliver it so no biggie.  Well an hour goes by and I'm starving so I decide to call GrubHub. They quickly apologize and contact the restaurant.  They explain to me that the driver is out on delivery now and should be there in the next 15mins. I thought I'd wait it out a bit.  30 mins pass by.  It has now been an hour and a half past the time of ordering and 45mins past the time of stated delivery.  I decide to call the restaurant directly and they say that the driver is still out for delivery and he has included a Lassi drink for my inconvenience.  I decide to call GrubHub to see what they would do about the situation and they were kind enough to grant me $25 for my next purchase. Another 30mins go by (2 hours total now) and nothing.  No ring, no knock, no phone call.  It is now 9:30pm and I'm ready for bed.  I call grubhub and they apologize.  Remind you - I'm being very patient with all parties.  I just want my food that was prepaid for.  GrubHub contacts Pakwan and they said that the food was already delivered.  ...That's news to me since I'm still calling and trying to find my food.  The restaurant calls back in another 15mins and explains that the delivery driver left the food in the backseat and forgot about it.  Grubhub was kind enough to force them to credit half of my purchase price.\n\nThe food finally arrived at my doorstep around 2 hours and 45mins from the time I placed my order.  It is now 10:15 and the driver explains that he is incredibly sorry and get this...  he even says to me \"The food is cold, just so you know.  But my manager said you can get a free dessert next time you order\".  What am I supposed to do with almost 3 hour late food, that's COLD?  Eat it.

The ones I HIGHLY recommend is the tandori chicken. Pakwan makes their tandori chicken with the right tenderness and it's not overcooked like ones I've had elsewhere. The tandori is also pretty bomb with that extra lime they add to the plate. \n\nAlso highly recommend the extra spicy lamb dish. It's got the kick, and they cook their lamb well here. The chicken tikka masala and the butter chicken were pretty similar and good. \n\nOnly complaint was the dessert. The coconut dessert was a hard swallow. I like coconut desserts usually, but if you're like me and not into tasting bready-textured things in your dessert, it's not for you.", "author": "Ting T."}

They prepare the food in a timely fashion and get it to you on time whether its busy or not through delivery, pick-up, or eating in. \n\nIt's understandable that when busy the delivery or pick up or eating in might be a little late because of the many orders they takes time for the food to prepare. They have great service even though its self-service but the people that work there are kind and very friendly.

Let me tell you the story!\n\nMy friend phoned in the order, gave the address and phone #. Then we played the waiting game. 30 minutes later, the restaurant called her to say that the delivery guy had called 10x and nobody picked up, so he's back on his way to the restaurant and they asked AGAIN for her number.\nExcuse me, but what number did you just dial to get to my friend? uhh, HER NUMBER.  What number do you think she's going to give you? THE SAME ONE YOU DIALED. \n\nMy friend just stayed compliant and patiently gave the restaurant her number again (the SAME # might I add) and the restaurant directed the delivery guy to come back.\n\nI walked over to the entrance of our building with her to find the delivery guy. He did not call 10x, what bs!!!!\nSo we were told the delivery guy called the office saying he's outside in a red car. I didn't see a red car, I SAW A RED CAB. THE DAMN DELIVERY GUY IS DRIVING A CAB CAR. \nLet me mention that he didn't bother to pull over to the curb and park or anything like that. He just put on his hazards in the middle of the street and made us walk up to him. He cracked open his window and had the nerve to say \"I called you 3x but you didn't pick up so I left\" What fucking # was he dialing?! Was he calling a cab customer by mistake!? WHO KNOWS but he was RUDE. We just glared at him, took the food, gave him less of a tip and went off.\n\nThe food itself is decent and definitely worth 3 stars. But since the food didn't get to me until 50 minutes later, that only left me 10 minutes to get my food and walk back to my own office which left me...2 minutes to eat. FAIL big big FAIL. \n\n\nNEVER AGAIN!\n\np.s. I also had aloo palak which is POTATOES & SPINACH.

Shalimar is dirt cheap and very tasty but a bit too chaotic and grimy for my taste, Chutney has that bizarre ordering system where you wait in line to order and then again to pay, but Pakwan is ALL good! Fast, cheap and unlike many Indian dives, clean and friendly. Everything is delicious but the Chicken Tikka Masala and Murgh Cholay are my favorites.\n\nINSIDER'S TIP: Be sure to grab a seat next to the window facing the Gazebo Smoke Shop at the corner of Jones and O'farrell, fix your gaze on the spot right in front of the \"NO LOITERING\" sign in the shop's window, and feast your eyes on the Rich and Ever-Changing Pageant of Pure Tenderloinery unfolding before you as you feast your mouth on some really solid grub.

It's more like a hot and doughy loaf without any taste..definitely don't get that \"naan-y\" taste. As for the garlic naan, it's just the plain bread stuffed with garlic--no other seasonings. \n\nThe chicken tikka  masala is delicious and has chunks of chicken breast it. The masala sauce is so so creamy and tasty. The only thing that I can complain about is the bland taste of the chicken in it. The veggie curry is yummy too only that it was served warm. Like either they microwaved it (for not a long time) or cut the time early on the stove top. It's stuffed with carrots, peas, onions and potatoes and it's pretty tasty though I wish  it was hotter. \n\nI need to try the 16th st.  location to compare.

Here is a list of Pros and Cons (of the food)\n\nThe cons:\n-The samosas came with the rest of the food instead of as an appetizer on their own\n-the samosa filling was rather bland \n-the chicken biryani was extremely spicy but not flavorful at all (yes, that IS indeed possible\n- murgh cholay had practically no \"cholay\" (garbanzo beans) and just four chunky pieces of chicken. (It is actually supposed to be a rich-curry based dish with spicy garbanzo beans and chicken)\n\n\nThe pros\n- the chicken biryani had little potatoes which is an authentic pakistani touch\n-the nan was soft and fluffy..\n- decently priced\n\nThe service was well.. strange, as our order number (as listed on the receipt) was announced and we had to go get the food ourselves. The restaurant was extremely noisy with the constant sound of the microwave beeping and the cooking staff yelling at each other.\n\nKeeping in mind the below-average food, the not-so-improved interior and the noise level, I doubt we will be returning.

We ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala, Chana Masala, and Saag Paneer for take out. \n\nBefore we even dipped our forks in, we had to scoop excessive amount of oil off the top of all three containers. Ew.\n\nTried the Saag Paneer first, it was grainy with zero good flavor. The paneer was brown (WHY?) and the texture was as if it had been left on the pan sizzling for the whole day. We at first thought the spinach used in the dish had gone bad, but then decided that no, in fact the dish was just horrible. We stopped eating it after about three bites.\n\nNext up was the Chana Masala. This one looked promising, the color was on par with what I've had before. But oh no. Absolutely terrible. Felt like sand in my mouth and the flavor was somehow at once overwhelmingly awful and bland. Got through about three bites again before we decided to save our tastebuds and stomachs.\n\nLast was the Paneer Tikka Masala. Again, the paneer was tough and chewy, the exact opposite texture that I want from paneer. The paneer tasted as if it had been added to the sauce at the last minute, it retained none of the flavor of the sauce. The sauce was wayyy too tomato-y. It tasted like they'd added a few indian spices to a jar of marinara.\n\nI'll give them the tinyest bit of credit for their naan.

It doesn't have the nicest bathroom, utensils, or furniture BUT the food itself is EXCELLENT.  When I'm in the mood for Indian, Pakwan is my go to place.  For some reason though, this particular Pakwan tastes so much better than the one on 16th and Mission.  Even though, the one in the Mission is more convenient for me I will go out of my way to come to this Pakwan for my craving of Indian food.  I always order the usual Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Biryani & Raita, Bengan Bhartha (Pakwan Style), and Naan.  Everytime I go I am never disappointed.   \n\nChicken Tikka Masala\n\nCreamy and just the right consistency to dip my naan into.  They give you a decent amount of chicken for the dish.\n\nLamb Biryani & Raita\n\nI've had lamb biryani in other Indian restaurants and it doesn't compare to this!  There's a little bit of sweetness with a flavorful \"kick\" to it.  They use quite a bit of clovers, black pepper corn, and cardamom for that added kick.  Sometimes the \"kick\" is so strong I need Raita to help calm the fieriness down.  The Raita is very soothing and milky.  It goes on the biryani better when it's not that thick like some other restaurants make it.\n\nBengan Bhartha\n\nWhat is Bengan Bhartha?  It's an eggplant cooked with onions, tomatoes, and peas.  Don't let the consistency scare you. It's a bit chunky and mushy but quite tasty and spicy.  It goes great on top of your Naan.\n\nNaan\n\nTheir Naans are soft, light, and fluffy and not overly baked.  The way a Naan should be.  I'm not a big of Naan that is crispy and crunchy.  You can't really dip or put much of anything on it like that.\n\nAfter eating here, be prepared to be launched into a food colma =) \n\nOne more thing though, this place is self service so you need to go to the counter to order and then grab drinks and utensils that are right next to the counter.

The biriyani here was ridiculously good too. I remember tasting that amazing blend of spices that is just so true and unique about the Pakistani biriyani. \n\nThe cook at the restaurant was incredibly nice, providing masala chais on the house.

Other top dishes: chicken tikka, paneer masala, bengan ka bharta, okra. oh and haleem when they have it! the haleem is so worth trying. nihari for nihari addicts..\n\nPeople who are finicky about the chicken on the bone and stuff should maybe tell the guys taking the order that they want boneless, because they usually do what they can. when i ask for only white meat in my biryaani, that's what i get. they're always super super nice every time i have been there (maybe because i speak to them in urdu..) and Pakwan food is like home away from home. \n\nThere are places you go to not because of the ambiance or the service (which in my opinion is pretty great) but because the food is delicious and cheap.

Cheap, quick, no fuss and very very delicious food!\n\nI am an Indian and can confirm this is one of the best places to eat North Indian food at if you don't mind the ambiance and/or location. It is in the heart of Tenderloin with a lot of weird characters around. The decor is very ordinary. But the food makes up for all this. \n \nThey have free unlimited tea ('chai'), so I always start with that while waiting for my meal. The wait btw is always very short. My favorite dishes to order are Goat curry, Bhuna Ghost (Lamb) and Chicken Achar. All of these are prepared with just the right spice every time (we always order medium spicy) and are priced at less than $9.\nIn vegetarian, dal is decent. But Baigan Bhartha is my favorite.\n\nOne more thing, always ask for specials. Sometimes they have fish curry or keema, which are prepared really well.\n\nAll in all a meal for 2 people - 2 entrees, one rice, two naans, onion salad (free), chai (free) comes out to be approx $21 and you will be full! And you will be out in less than 40 minutes! \n\nDefinitely worth a try :) You'll go back for sure!", "author": "Chitra G."}

Beyond the fact that the spicing of the curries was totally off (too much turmeric + cardamom seed = a sweetness to my eggplant which was totally unwelcome), but the whole place was just so dirty. I generally like exposed kitchens, but this one actually made me lose my appetite; kind of like a scene from that movie Seven. Even the plates upon which our meals were served had those gross, soaking-with-pot-and-pan-oil-yet-not-properly-washed-afterward black smudge marks. Damn, even now I'm getting shivers of revulsion; was it extreme hunger or the $20 that I spent that made me stick it out? With so many good Indo-Pak restaurants nearby, please do not make the same mistake that I made. \n\nEdited 21 December, 2006\nOK, I gave Pakwan another shot a few days ago and, really, it wasn't that ad. Yes, the kitchen area is scary, but I've seen just as bad at \"high-end\" places. Also, I suppose that they were just having a really bad day or going through a rough patch because, on my second visit, everything tasted fine. I'm glad Pakwan has it together and I'm glad that I gave them a second chance. Interior is depressing still; go for carry-out.", "author": "Daniel W."}

I was amazed to find that they're not only part of a chain but have a nice website.  They have none of the polish or gloss, numbly mechanical feel, or dumbed-down food of most multiple-location eateries.  They've instead perfected the art of delivering crave-worthy Indian and Pakistani food with a minimum of overhead.   \n\nNo middlemen (read: servers) get between me and the guys with access to the big pots of food.  I place my order and pay at the counter.  There'll be a short wait for my food, and I make myself useful:  grab a plate, glass, a few beat-up utensils, and napkins from the shelf next to the counter and dispense whatever drink I've paid for into the glass (no one else will do it for me).  Find a seat - they're all the same: simple kitchen chairs pushed under tables that are no more than four legs supporting a (mostly) horizontal surface.  Embellishment is unnecessary to function.  Listen and watch for my food to appear on the counter.  (It's a small place, and the perfectly-visible kitchen nearly dominates - it gives Pakwan an immediate feel.)  I usually identify my food by sight and a nod from the guy behind the counter - I've only understood his shout-out a couple of times.\n\nWhen I begin eating, it's always the same - there's a rush as I realize just how good this food is.  The heretofore unknown depth of my hunger makes itself known as it becomes apparent that this is fare to satisfy, not just take the edge off.  It tastes so good on the tongue that we always end up ordering a second round, and it usually includes the Saag Daal.

Delivery minimum of $20 is about the typical minimum for indian restaurants. I've eaten here in person as well, but I've noticed my food tends to be more heavily spiced when I order over the internet and have it delivered. The one downside to this place is that it is wildly inconsistent. I've ordered Chicken Tikka 3 times. The first time it was thin and flavorless; the last two times the sauce was incredible- rich and smoky, great for soaking up in naan, I could even drink it. However, the chicken is always dry and flavorless. It seems like it was cooked alone and added to the sauce later, it just doesn't belong there. The bengan bhartha was mild and well, just sort of okay the first couple of times i ordered it. The last time I got it, it was ridiculously spicy, with whole red peppers floating in it. You just never know what you're going to get. I do love the paneer in the saag paneer, but the aloo palak is just awesome, whole leaves of spinach and perfectly spiced potatoes. The naan tends to be fluffy, and i've actually never had the garlic naan unseasoned as other reviewers are saying, mine has always been covered in green herbs and garlic. The lamb biryani is very generous with the lamb and was one of the dishes i ordered every time for awhile (until i got cheap and started ordering the plain rice). I've ordered samosas and pakora once, but they were nothing special.. who knows, maybe it was just the wrong night.  Its a mixed bag, but you'll always get a really filling meal with something you just don't expect to be so wonderful. Its like a guessing game, you can't get rely on any one favorite for too long (except the lamb biriyani), but something in that order will be out of this world.", "author": "Kassi A."}

I ordered the chicken with eggplant.  \n\nThe chicken was a chicken masala and was VERY good.  The naan was fluffy with a little tandoor burn to the bottom.  The subzi was delicious.  I'm sure the dal is good too.  Everything was served on a traditional metal plate.  And the portions were HUGE.  I tried to stop scarfing and slow myself down.  \n\nEverything was so good.

It really feels like I just broke up with someone I truly loved.  It wasn't the cockroach in my samosas that ended my relationship with Pakwan tonight, it was being called a complete idiot by the delivery person/manager(?).  Oh sure, he chose different words but in essence he said I ride the short bus.  Here's how the break-up went down:\n\nAfter feverishly devouring one samosa in my dimly lit kitchen (lesson 1: do not eat take-out in dimly lit areas) I moved to the living room to start on the second.  The light from the t.v. grew brighter during a commercial break and cast its glow on the soggy cardboard box that held my remaining samosa...a familiar shape was distinguished in the illumination - it looked like a small cockroach.  I thought my mind was playing tricks on me so I went back to the kitchen and threw on the light - it was a cockroach, not too big - a teenager I would guess.  It was about an inch long and met its fate earlier than most of its kind, yet how could one go out more gloriously than in a pair of Pakwan samosas?  Nay!  Not possible.\n\nLike any surprised and moderately disgusted customer, wondering if I had perhaps already consumed one of the intruders' friends, I called the restaurant to say that despite being a regular patron, on this occasion there was a cockroach in my food, that I was throwing it all out, so please do not charge me for it.  I was told by a woman that the delivery driver would call me back.  (This is where my assumption of the delivery driver being the managers arises).  The phone call I soon received, not the cockroach, is why I will never again solicit the deliciously spicy Chicken Makhanwala from Pakwan.\n\nA man called me, said he just delivered the food and asked what happened.  I told him I often called the restaurant, he said \"I know - I deliver to your house\" and I said that there was a cockroach in my samosas this time.  He said \"Oh, no, no - it's a spice.  It's a cardamom seed.\"  As shocked as I was to hear not an apology but that I was in fact retarded, not being able to tell an herb from a living critter, I said \"Sir, it's a cockroach - I'm looking at it, it's not a cardamom seed.\" He was then impelled to tell me that I didn't  know what cardamom looked like, that many people think they see a bug in their food but that it's just cardamom.  He laughed.  I said, \"Sir, it has legs.  I can see it's antennas.\"  After already having told me about 3 times that it wasn't a cockroach, he then told me he didn't want to argue about what it was or wasn't.  (Lesson 2: Your meal can get worse than finding a cockroach in it, no really, it can) I begged him to come back to my apartment and pick up the food.  I told him I wanted him to see it since he was telling me that I didn't know what I was looking at.  He told me he wasn't near my house and asked me if I wanted a credit.\n\nThe difficult thing is that I'm a reasonable person - I understand that restaurants are places that keep large amounts of food and from time to time they will have issues with little critters wanting to get at that food, but being a reasonable person, I simply wanted an apology and an offer to correct the issue.  What I got was insulted and argued with and I had to tell the gentleman that I wouldn't be calling them anymore.  I went so far as to tell him that I had considered it a one-off incident but that with him insulting my intelligence, as if I couldn't identify a cockroach, I would no longer be giving them my business.\n\nThis is a sad day.  I understand that there is little \"service\" left in the food industry, we are supposed to be happy just to get the food we order, never mind expect it to be hot or bug-free, but to have a manager argue with me (a repeat customer who has recommended their place countless times!) as if I were stupid is just too low.\n\nIn summation I must say that although the food at Pakwan is amazing - it just doesn't compensate for poor service or flat out insults.  Adieu Pakwan!  Parting is such sweet sorrow...I hope that someone on the staff endeavors to enroll in \"Customer Service 101\" and seeks to entreat future customers with more respect than I was given.  As the Kluminator says, \"I'm sorry, you are out\".\n\nIf anyone has a good recipe for Chicken Makhanwala, send it my way - I will be making my own from here on out.", "author": "MJ P."}

My order of seekh kabab, spinach and naan arrived fairly quickly - it helped that there were only 4 other customers in the restaurant at the time.  The naan was good - soft and fluffy - I think they add cream to the dough.  The kabab was not good - something was lacking in the spice mix used to marinate the beef.   The spinach was lousy - boiled mush that had been left to sit in tepid water for a while.  Next time I will just wait for my turn at Shalimar.", "author": "Vikram P."}

But the Pakistani-influenced kitchen, where all the food is prepared in accordance with Islamic law, isn't as successful as it might be. Tandoor lamb chops tasted as if they had been marinating a day or two longer than necessary. Palak paneer featured very tough blocks of cheese and a thin sauce that was more water than spinach. Chicken tikka masala was tender, but the tomato-based sauce lacked oomph. The naan was very crispy and about the size of a small dinner plate. Best of the lot was a multicolored rice, flavored with hints of saffron and cardamom.

That place looks like it was build for a massive earthquake. The thing they need to with their restaurant is to remodel the whole entire restaurant. So the only good thing thing about this restaurant is most of the food. The chicken buryani taste really good but the white rice tasted like it wasn't cooked all the way. The chicken Ticha masalah taste so good that you one you take your first bite you would want to have more or you will even be ful.
