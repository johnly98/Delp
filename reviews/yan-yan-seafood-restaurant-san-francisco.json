Knowing as you may by now, my reviews always, or maybe just sometimes, come with self-admitted disclosures.  I'm a big fan of Asian restaurants in general and value being the only Anglo in the place.  Great if the waiter doesn't speak English.  And a big plus for a menu that would seem weird on the other side of town.  In other words, a Chinese dive that somehow makes me feel faraway is a great beginning, with incredible items made from what might in other cultures become petfood.  That's a 5star beginning for me. \n\nOK so Yan Yan is in a small commercial area in an otherwise solid residential neighborhood that goes on for quite a few blocks before ending at the beach.  Maybe it's the trolley line along Judah so the street is a bit less auto-friendly, but anyway not much commercial activity nearby.  From the outside Yan Yan says right off this is a dive mostly patronized by Asians.  Then you enter the place, and find yourself in the kitchen.  Don't let this put you off, keep going, turn right.  \n\nFinally inside the tables are in a room totally lacking in decor except for a tv and one of those buddha shrines, both mounted high on the wall.  Formica tables and a few other basics are what you get to look at.  Maybe this is so you'll pay more attention to the food?  Whatever, this in my book is 5star, as I'm here to eat.  So, what for the food.  The menu is not the largest selection in town, but it's very expansive.  Items like chicken feet and pork belly are quite good for appetizers, but not always seen are pork intestines in several forms.  The servings are extremely generous, one table nearby with a large group was served a large mound of pork chops and an equally large portion of a chicken dish.  Our own mustard green with garlic was enough for four and then some.    \n\nI'll have to go back as there are a lot of clay pot items and a great many seafood specialties to try.  But on a first outing, I am really encouraged.", "author": "Bob S."}

This is your typical Asian restaurant that you'd find in the SGV - not much decor, giant round tables, waitresses that only speak Canto, etc.\n\nFood was solid! Chicken feet were complimentary appetizers. We ordered some sort of vegetable dish, spare rib, walnut shrimp, and the bird's nest noodles. All were good, but nothing spectacular. \n\nThey added a 15% off tip automatically. Kinda weird, but at least they gave us two servings of dessert each. Probably cause my friends speak Canto!", "author": "Michael N."}

I've been here many times over many years, where it has changed ownership and all that, and it seems to be worsening or something as time passes. Something happens when it gets crowded, they really do not know how to handle everything or more than one order at a time.\n\nThere is truth to the other reviews, the food is really good, but the service is TERRIBLE. This past time, we sat down, but no one took the order, so we had to go the front and basically place our order. But in a new twist for a restaurant, we had to write down our order, YES WRITE, and return it to the front woman (yes she's the only one who takes orders).\n\nWe got our first dish an hour after we sat down. I think other tables that sat after us got banquet dinners so their food came out quicker somehow, as if deviating from a set menu must confuse the kitchen. Dishes came out in no particular order and in no timely fashion.\n\nWhat should be an hour activity turned into almost a 2.5 hour excursion into what should be the depths of a Restaurant Impossible episode.", "author": "Spencer H."}

The two ladies that walk around are consistently giving nothing but negative vibes. If you want attitude that's what you will be served here fast and plenty. These are people who have enough money to afford to open a restaurant but have no experience in \"front of the house service.\" They're probably all relatives who have always wanted to open a restaurant, but never did research on how to operate one. They act as if your bugging them for drink orders or something they are missing like a serving spoon.\n\nThis is unfortunate because when the food finally makes it to your table it is good. Not outstanding, but good. They don't reinvent the wheel or have a signature dish. This place is always pretty crowded too. When you see 3/4 of the tables occupied be aware it will be a 2 hour experience. \n\nI can't go on anymore but reading the other reviews and realize the pattern here: Service sucks, food is decent whenever they decide to bring it out, desserts are good, AND LASTLY double check your bill to make sure you're not overcharged.

It has hit that spot.  Their stir-fried, black bean clams were fresh and there were no crunchy sands in it.  I was awaiting for it and that shows that their clams are treated well.\n\nTheir pea sprouts in garlic, was good for a veggie dish. Their Mongolian beef, lacked a load of beef.  There were more slices of onions and green onions than the meat.  Tofu with mushrooms was aye okay as well as their fish cod with tender greens.  Their Westlake beef soup, was pretty bland.  I needed to sprinkle some white pepper to appease the palate.  \n\nService was not so good.  Didn't dine in, but my family ordered to go and the waitress who picked up, was giving attitude and impatiently asked for the orders.

After sitting there for 10 minutes, another table saw our frustration and said that they too had the same problem. Eventually, some person came by and dropped off a pen and paper and told us to write down what we wanted! Though we had questions about the menu, they basically blew us off and told us to write it down. Now my folks are 92 and 88 years old, so getting up and leaving for another restaurant was not an option. So if you're ok with bad service, then you might be okay with the food. They are slick though because they add the tip to the bill, so you are stuck with the bad service with no recourse. I looked around and other tables seemed happy with the food (large portions), but I will not be back.

It was 7:30pm and the restaurant was fully packed. Not much decorations, but it indeed looks very much like an authentic Chinese restaurant.\n\nThe dishes on menu are pretty standard. Asked the waitress to take order but every one was telling us to wait until the lady boss's free and she will take the order for us. We literally waited for 10 minutes until the lady boss came to our table - was a bit frustrated about that. But once she started taking our order, I totally understand why we had to wait for her - the lady boss is hilarious, the way she speaks and her body language is very interesting; and she has the complete menu memorized and offered good suggestions on what we should get. It was quite an entertaining \"show\".\n\nChicken Feet \u9e75\u6c34\u767d\u96f2\u9cf3\u722a (appetizer): A-.\nThe best part of it was free of charge - they literally gave us two big plates of chicken feet. For chicken feet, usually there are only either black bean taste (where you find from dim sum) or those cold, boiled+vinegar style (white in color). It was probably the first time I tried this particular \u9e75\u6c34\u767d\u96f2 type and it was pretty amazingly good.\n\nCrab + Fish Stomach Soup \u87f9\u8089\u9b5a\u809a\u7fb9: B+.\nIt was alright. Pretty standard.\n\nJelly Fish Smoked Meat \u6d77\u54f2\u85b0\u8e44: B+.\nIt was alright. No surprise there.\n\nSalted Fish Tofu Chicken Pot \u9e79\u9b5a\u96de\u7c92\u8c46\u8150\u7172: B+.\nNothing special. Would appreciate more if the salted fish smell could come out more from the pot.\n\nTofu Pea Sprouts \u7389\u5b50\u8c46\u8150\u5927\u8c46\u82d7: A-.\nThe stir fry time was controlled really well - the pea sprouts was perfectly cooked and the vege quality itself was very good. \n\nKyoto Prime Ribs + Salt and Pepper Fried Ribs \u4eac\u90fd\uff0b\u6912\u9e7d\u6392\u9aa8: B.\nWe couldn't decide which flavor to get, and so the lady boss said we can just order half an order from each flavor. It wasn't the best thing to do actually, because by doing that the Kyoto flavor did not get much sauce to it, while the salt and pepper flavor did not taste deep fried enough. I suggest to go with either flavor instead of both.\n\nStir-fry Bean \u7092\u56db\u5b63\u8c46: A-.\nI think they used \u99ac\u62c9\u76de as the sauce and it indeed smelled and tasted very nice. Not too much oil was used so didnt get stuffed afterwards.\n\nHand-sheared Salty Chicken \u624b\u6495\u9e7d\u7117\u96de: A-.\nSurprisingly good. It was sheared into small pieces which made it very easy to eat. Taste was very flavorful - definitely on the salty side, but I mean it is \u9e7d\u7117 so it is completely normal. The addition of green onion further enhance the smell and taste to the dish. We ordered one whole chicken, and it seems to be just about the right amount for eight people.\n\nStir-fried Clam \u907f\u98a8\u5858\u7092\u8706: A-.\nI have not tried this type of clam-cooking method before - it was first deep fried and then stir-fried with pepper and hot chili sauce - and it wasn't too spicy. Clam was pretty fresh. Would recommend to finish this dish at the earliest since it tasted much better when the dish was still hot.\n\nSteamed Fish \u6e05\u84b8\u77f3\u6591: A.\nThe fish itself was very fresh. Cooking time was perfect. Couldn't really criticize this dish.\n\nAfter dinner, it's free dessert time! So there were choices of \u9f9c\u96f6\u818f/\u829d\u9ebb\u7cca/\u8292\u679c\u5e03\u4e01/\u7d05\u8c46\u6c99. I tried the mango pudding and it was alright - definitely not made with fresh mango but it did not taste bad. My friends who got the \u9f9c\u96f6\u818f said it was really good, and \u829d\u9ebb\u7cca had some strange texture to it.\n\nWhen we left the restaurant, the lady boss came out and said bye to us. All of a sudden she started singing some old Chinese songs so loud that the whole street could listen. Haha it was pretty hilarious.\n\nOverall, a pretty decent Chinese little restaurant, with lots of above standard dish choices and entertaining boss.

We got the fried flounder, mustard greens with mushroom, and half half pork chops (half sweet and sour, half salt and pepper). I must say, all three dishes were delicious. I highly recommend the half half pork chops because they were really on par. The flounder, I would rather have steamed but if you like a food crunch to your fish, then get the fried flounder.\n\nYou also get a free plate of chicken feet. The owner/manager is super friendly (can't say the same about the rest of the staff but I didn't have that much of an interaction with them). At the end of the meal, each diner gets to choose from a list of desserts too (red bean soup, green bean soup, herbal jelly, mango pudding, black sesame soup). The red bean soup was good and standard. The herbal jelly was ok but I'm biased because I don't like it anywhere.\n\nAll in all, I'd come again to see what else is good or just for those pork chops again!", "author": "Christine L."}

Prices are extremely reasonable, menu is extensive, food is tasty (look at the pics, says more than a thousand words).  This is not Panda Express or PF Chang's for sure.  Some must orders:\n\nIf you are adventurous, the squab (fancy name for pidgeon) is very tender and flavorful.  In a blind taste test, you could be fooled in thinking it's duck.  Avoid looking at the heads, which by the way could be eaten.\n\nWhen in season, the pea shoots are fantastic.  It has the right blend of garlic and cooked perfectly.\n\nBTW, the hostess (I think is the owner) is extremely eccentric in a good way and engaging.  You may get a few laughs in chatting with her.\n\nFor everything that is great about the restaurant, few minor downsides.  Parking is limited to the neighborhoods, best shot is really on Judah St.  It's very cramped and don't mind that people may bump into you.

I didn't know they were talking about Yan Yan though. So long long time ago, my grandparents along with my parents and other relatives used to run this place before they split off to open their own individual restaurants. I honestly don't remember those days since I was a wee little baby. Haha\n\nThe food is definitely tasty & big portioned.

We also had complimentary cold but seasoned soy chicken feet.  Other dishes included saut\u00e9ed squid with Vegts., salted chicken, the walnut shrimp was great, my favorite was the mixed salt pepper beef and Peking beef, the catfish in black bean sauce was tender, 2 fried crabs were tender as well.  I don't particularly like mustard greens with mushrooms but the Vegt was cooked just right.  \n\nAt the end of the meal you select red or green  bean soups which were good, sesame soup was sweet but too thick, mango pudding was too stiff and not so great.

Though the owners have changed, the food tastes just as great! The owner has excellent customer service. I went on a saturday night with my family and luckily there were tables available at 7:30 PM. We sat down, and an appetizer of chicken feet was given as a complementary side. I always crave their chicken feet. My brother, who rarely eats chicken feet dug in graciously. He said these were the only chicken feet he would eat since. I was amazed at what I saw. \n\nMy family of 4 decided to order a pot of tofu with fried fish and mushrooms, honey walnut shrimp, a type  of bird (i dont know the name), egg whites fried rice, and a sweet and sour pork. After we ordered, it took the waiters about 20 minutes to bring out our first dish. It was a bit slow but there were many people to service so I understood. \n\nThe food was amazing. After the first dish arrived, the other dishes soon followed. The egg whites fried rice is the best! Though I try to make it at home, the best ones are always made here. The sweet and sour pork is one of my favorites here. For such a big plate, it only costs around $9. That's SUPER cheap! Its one of the main reasons why I like eating here. Good price for a good meal. \n\nThough I havn't  been here in awhile, I did not know they still gave out free dessert of your choice. You could choose from red bean, green beans, mango pudding to black sessame dessert. I chose mango pudding because it's my favorite dessert at an asian restaurant. \n\nOverall, the food was great and the service was great.

It is built in the bottom floor of a house-looking building and residents live upstairs. This is my family's go-to place when all my extended members come together. We have been coming here for at least the last 3 years come here for my grandparent's birthdays or other occasions and I am never disappointed. They are open everyday except Tuesdays. The food is CHEAP, the portions are HUGE, and service is EXCELLENT. \n\nMy most recent visit was last night. We got two orders of the set meal of $188 plus two additional dishes for 18 people. Every table gets a complimentary cold chicken feet dish as appetizers. Most kids of this generation might not eat it since it is more of a traditional dish, but I love it considering I'm not a picky eater and I love eating traditional Chinese food. The dishes are always really good. Their wok has a really good heat and makes everything super delicious. The Yin-Yang spareribs dish is my favorite. It is half sweet & sour spare ribs and half salt & pepper spare ribs. The walnut shrimp is always made perfectly. Nowadays, it is hard to find a place that makes perfect honey walnut shrimps. The complimentary dessert is another plus. Each person gets a choice of red bean soup, green bean soup, sesame dessert, mango pudding, or turtle shell jello. They are usually very lenient and if you want an extra dessert, they wouldn't mind giving you another one. \n\n\nThe waiters and waitresses are pretty nice. They listen to all your commands and give you more than what you need. If you ask for one fork, they will give you three forks. If you ask for napkins, they will give you a huge stack.  \n\nThe boss lady is quite a character. If it is your birthday, she will sing with you at your table and will provide complimentary steamed buns. She has funny jokes (if you understand Cantonese). Also, if you are under 21, she will give you a jello treat. (Too sad I cant get them anymore).\n\n\nOne star off because the restaurant itself is kind of dirty and grimey.", "author": "Allie Y."}

No worries, though, it got us to try this lil gem tucked away in the Sunset district away from other big restaurants. \n\nDespite that this place was a bit hidden away (it's clearly a local SF favorite though!), it was busy busy busy. They had all their large tables reserved, leaving just a handful of small table seating for parties 4 or smaller.

And this is not a place where you have to choose quantity over quality either! We were very impressed with every dish that came out. We got a seafood egg drop soup, walnut shrimp (my brother loves this stuff...), chicken lettuce wraps, fried flounder, noodles, and an off menu order of greens/mushrooms/carrots. All was delicious and definitely served 4-6 people. We ended up ordering too much since the plates were huge, and had to take the majority of the noodles and greens home. Just means we get a delicious lunch of leftover the next day! With tax, this came out to ~$65 for 4 people!!\n\nExtra pluses? Free chicken feet for the appetizer and free red/green bean soup, mango pudding, grass jelly, or sesame for dessert. Can't beat free food that also tastes good! \n\nWhile some of the staff were particularly sweet and attentive (we got a cute older lady who was great!), I docked a star for the wait time and for the fact that some of the staff really don't know some of the menu items well and literally shove you out of the way to serve tables. Granted, they're in a tight space at this restaurant, but some common courtesy to customers is always appreciated. \n\nIf you haven't been to a more hole in the wall chinese restaurant, just keep in mind that wait times can be long, and that the focus is on the food, not necessarily the atmosphere or service. \n\nThey take card here, but much more prefer (and urge you to..) cash.

I ate it anyway cuz its crab and I didn't get sick or anything. but it was just strange. and not what I wanted.\n\nThe noodles -- it was off. it was also sweet and it was strange but I couldnt put my finger on it and neither could my cousins. all of us thought it tasted weird.\n\nFREE Appetizer/Dessert: \nThey also come with some soy sauce chicken feet for appetizers (free!) and all you can eat dessert. For the dessert, you can choose between the red bean soup, green bean soup, turtle jello, black seasame soup or mango pudding. of course, my cousins and i being the asian ams that we are, we choose mango pudding and all our parents chose the red bean soup or turtle jello.", "author": "Tiffany L."}

I love the BBQ Short RIbs! My favorite out of all the dishes!\n\n1. Cold Combo - Delicious; Full of different things, each very tasty.\n\n2. Shark Fin Soup - Delicious; I choose to add tons of pepper, makes it a little spicier!\n\n3. Honey Walnut Prawns - Delicious! Not so sweet prawns and super crisp and sweet walnuts. The Fried rice noodles are tasty also.\n\n4. BBQ Short Ribs - I love this one! A little salty, but the sauce and the nuts on top make this my all time favorite of the banquet.\n\n5. Boiled Chicken - Not the best....has some hidden bones in the back of the chicken. Garlic sauce makes it taste a lot better.\n\n6. Scallop/Fish/Veggie Dish - Not so much a fan of the seafood on this plate, but the veggies are the best here! Snow peas, celery and the carrots! Yum!\n\n7. Fried Fish w/ Broccoli - Not much fish to eat but the few pieces of fish that they place on top of the shell of the fish. The broccoli was my favorite part. I tried the skin of the fish, but did not really like it since it's practically bone filled and not very easy to eat (if edible at all...)\n\n8.  Abalone w/ Cabbages - Delicious; another favorite. The abalone is nice and easy to eat and the cabbage is probably my favorite part of this dish.\n\n9. Fried Rice - Not bad, a little greasy for my taste but good nonetheless.\n\n10. Fried Lobster - Good but prefer regular steamed/quick stir fry lobster. The fried lobster was hard to eat and I felt that the amount of lobster meat could have been more if not fried.\n\n11. Dessert - Same little paper to order desserts from. I chose the Turtle Shell again since I can't get it anywhere else. I really need to try something else. I like it but this time was especially bitter. Want to try the mango pudding or green bean? dessert next time.\n\nI give the banquet an A.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-08-21", "description": "It really doesn't matter what is written about this place because most of the older Chinese customers that frequent this place don't read Yelp. So yes, this review will also be irrelevant to those customers.\n\nFirst of all, you should know that finding parking is very difficult in this area. This old restaurant looks fairly clean (at least better than most hole-in-the-wall places). They have a menu in English, but all the specials are posted in Chinese in a very unique way. They use foam-board rectangles connected with metal rings, and organized in columns by category. See my pic here: http://static1.px.yelp.com/bphoto/zgEwluViDjs382ZmKRa1Og/l\n\nFrom my few experiences dining here (invited by family and friends), the specials are usually better than almost anything in the regular menu. Many of the simple stir-fry dishes were subpar, while the more complex dishes were really good (ie. beef medallions with honey, steamed fish special, etc.). Does that mean that I would dine here often or recommend it to others? no. \n\nWhy? Because this is the only Chinese restaurant in SF, where I had to wait +45 minutes before our table got any food (that's time seated at the table, not time waiting outside). That's embarrassing for a host and his/her dinner guests. We didn't even get an apology. Yes, the place was busy that day, all tables booked. We had reservations, dining banquet-style, so they knew we were coming. A good Chinese restaurant would have managed to serve at least the appetizer, or the soup, or the waiter could have brought some peanuts.\n\nFor me that's like breaking an unwritten rule. In a good Chinese restaurant, you don't leave hungry (unless the food is really bad), AND after placing your order, you NEVER have to wait a very long time without any food. There could be delays between plates, but getting nothing for any time over 20-30 minutes is unacceptable. I don't patronize Chinese restaurants that break those rules. If I get invited by a friend or family I'll go, I just won't come back here when I'm paying.\n\nThe reason why I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2, is because I respect that some friends of family like this place.", "author": "Luis C."}

Me and my friends went there for dinner and we love everything we ordered. The free starter, chicken claws, were great. We ordered the deep fried pigeons, they were juicy and done just right. Another great dish we ordered was the snails in hot chili sauce, it was soooo good. My friend who doesn't eat spicy food also can't resist them. Last but not least was their fre dessert and I chose the green bean paste. I can totally tell they made the green bean paste themselves because it's so different from the ones you could eat from other chinese restaurants. \n\nOverall, I would say this place is super awesome and should be a must go place when visiting SF!!!", "author": "Katie C."}

Afterall, this place was the go-to-place for family gatherings, birthday celebrations, and holiday dinners.\n\nTuesday Night\n\nBear in mind\n1) the location of this restaurant and the ridiculous time it takes to find parking. \n2) the common setting of Chinese restaurant tables (if you don't know, they are foldable and extendable) \n3) There were AT LEAST 6 empty tables with NO RSVP \n\nSo, we made reservation for a party of 5 at 6:30. We told the owner our party was actually going to be 6 and she said \"that's okay, but wait for whole party to come before I put a table together for you\". (What's funny is, when we had reservations for a party of 20, that rule was not implemented, nor did it even exist.). \n\nOkay fine .. since my family and I are considerate patrons, we stood outside, in the wind, because we didn't want to block her doorway.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, we told her \"the fifth person is parking, can you seat us?\" The owner replies \" wait for her to come then I put table together for you\"\n\nOkay, fine .. Immediately after finishing her sentence, she seats other walk-in customers, who did not have their complete party present....\n\nOur fifth person arrives, and we tell her \"she's here\". Lady replies \"wait for sixth person, then I put table together for you\"\n\nThen again .. more customers walk in to get seated when the rest of their party is looking for parking.\n\nSeriously, WTF. Do you think your restaurant is the new Five Star Fine Dining joint in San Francisco? Unless you have a fancy smancy bar area for customers to lounge around and wait for the rest of their party, you have no right telling your customers to wait outside for the rest of their party. Oh, but then again, OTHER CUSTOMERS were seated immediately after they kissed ass and chanted \"boss lady\"\n\nDude, I lived in China for 4 months and COMMUNISTS CHINESE PEOPLE HAVE BETTER SERVICE THAN YOU. You, my dear, have a lot of reviewing to do. Maybe some CUSTOMER SERVICE 101 will help you, but then again, I think all these good reviews on yelp ABOUT YOUR FOOD has clouded your judgement on what customer service is. \n\nWhat-a-damn-shame ...

Around 5, I called back to ask her if it would be ok to change the party to 6 and again, she said it was fine.\n\nAll seemed to be well and dandy until we actually got there. \nThings to note:\n1. Restaurant is in a residential area so parking after 6 pm may be difficult\n2. SF weather any time after sun set  especially in the SUNSET is going to be CHILLY. (will be referred back to shortly)\n\nUpon arrival at 6:20 pm, I noted that over half the restaurant was empty. We informed the hostess (owner) that 4 out of the 6 people in our party was here. She told us that when the rest of our party arrived, she would seat us... which under normal circumstances would have been fine, BUT as we stood outside of the entrance freezing to death, we couldn't help but notice several groups of people going in and being seated with other party members that were THERE already. OUTRAGEOUS RIGHT?\n\nWhen our fifth member arrived, we promptly asked to be seated since the last remaining person was finding parking. Again, she said that she would seat us when EVERYONE in our party was present. ARE YOU SERIOUS LADY?\n\n1. This policy doesn't seem to be applicable to everyone else you have already seated.\n2. The restaurant is half empty, doesn't look like a whole crowd will suddenly bombard your place, so I highly doubt seating the 5 of us now versus 6 will really make a difference for your business.\n3. WHERE IS YOUR HUMANITY? It's freezing and we have already explained to you the LAST PERSON is already HERE but trying to look for parking.\n4. You are not a 5 star or even a 4 star restarant. You don't even have a waiting area for guests to wait at.  Your food isn't even extraordinary so WHERE IS YOUR SENSE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE??\n\nNeedless to say, we just told her our whole party was here, but we're just going to bring business to somewhere else FOREVER. I would totally give this place a ZERO star for the complete lack of customer service if yelp had that feature, but word of advice, head on down to EIGHT IMMORTALS on Taraval and 24th if you're looking for good chinese food & great customer service.", "author": "Ada C."}

We came on memorial day and the service was absolutely terrible. They get super overwhelmed and you're going to have to wait a long time for your food. Originally we were going to pick out specific dishes, but they suggested we pick from their set meal packages, ie dinner for 8, dinner for 10 etc as they were too busy.  Also, if you have any elderly/handicapped diners, make sure you let them know that way they don't put you in their back room which has 3 steps you have to climb up.  My 92 year old grandmother, and another handicapped person on adjacent table was unaware of this...Good luck getting up those steps without help.  Also, the waiters aren't going to want to service you as the location in the back is too hard to get into.  As for the food, I thought it was subpar.  Maybe when you come at a less busy time, it may be better.  One of the dishes ordered was the seafood lettuce wrap which surprisingly enough had no seafood in it, I think they maybe used hoi sin sauce and call it seafood??? We had a party of 11 and the dish came with 6 pieces of lettuce.  When asked for more lettuce, the response was that it was going to cost extra. Say what? How stingy are you guys that you can't provide a few extra pieces of lettuce.  Also, there were times when we had to service ourselves...Sensing our dissatisfaction, the boss lady gave us a complimentary kung pao chicken wing dish...which was the farthest thing from kung pao chicken I had ever seen. In the end, they also messed up the dessert order as we had ordered more green bean soup than red bean soup, but they mixed it up and had it the other way around.  Overall, I would say this place is not worth it. This place wasn't that cheap and it wasn't that good either.  Oh and they automatically tacked on a 15% tip (already written on bill and tabulated for you), so I guess you don't even have to even think about giving anymore than that...not that I would've given more than that since it was already decided for me. Not sure if this place will survive, if it can't even handle busy days...bad experiences will just drive people away and maybe when it's less busy the food will be better? but then they won't be making money as seats won't be filled...catch 22?

Great neighborhood restaurant if you are in walking distant. When you enter the restaurant, you are greeted by 2 carts full of dirty dishes and trash, we stood in the small entry for about 10 minutes before the Hostess walked by, like we are invisible, we had to let her know I would like to eat at Yan Yan. 80% of the restaurants are catered to large groups, if you have a party of 4 or less, they have about only 8 tables for you, so we waited for the people at the small tables to finish eating while there was empty large tables. Here is when it starts getting comical, a table of 2 elderly Chinese couple was done eating, they even packed up leftovers, but they sat there for 10 minutes because the hostess didn't bring them their check, we stood literally right behind this table for another 10 minutes, they still waited for their check, finally, the elderly man got tired of waiting and pull out his phone and both of them started to play games on it.  After about 25 minutes, the hostess brought them the check, they paid, but now they want dessert.  The line is getting lone, and if you know anything about Chinese restaurants, people will cut in front of you, so I just threw myself on that table. A server cleaned the table for us, and then nobody ever came back, I had to go get the menus, every time I asked someone to take my order, they waved to someone else apparently, none of them speak English, so I wrote down my order on a napkin and handed to the hostess, who is also the owner. How's the food? We ordered a 2lb Chef's Special Sauce Lobster, Clams with Black Bean Sauce, Salty Shredded Chicken, Chinese Bacon with Preserved Veg, Deep Fried Squad, and Chicken with Snow Peas for the baby.  The Lobster is basically salt and peppered Lobster with minced meat and leeks, there was no \"sauce\", just deep fried and dried, should have order the Ginger and Scallion sauce instead. The rest of the food is just ok, your typical Chinese restaurant, nothing here really separates them apart from countless other restaurants. Everyone raved about the Deep Fried Crispy Squad (Qual), Bodega's Squad is 10 times better, they are crispy to the point that you can chew through the bones.  I kept flagging everyone down for our bill because people in line was looking at our table since we where done eating, for 15 minutes, they never brought our bill, I had to go up to the Hostess to ask for the bill and pay right there.

My friend's mom knows the owner and its probably a good thing otherwise we would be waiting for days!\n\nIt is a fairly sized restaurant and I believe there's also a back room We snagged three large tables and it just so happens another party was going on that snagged four family tables. Ooops for any one just coming here that night for a regular dinner:( \n\nWe ordered the fixed menu options and added a few more dishes. My favorite was the garlic porkchop? I can't even really remember since it was a few weeks ago and now I'm not convincing you to get it but do be on the lookout for a garlic meat entree! \n\nI'm assuming they are well known for their yee mein. Almost all the tables got it and in my opinion, its NBD but lots of people seemed to like it. The noodles were well flavored and not too greasy, though its not meant to be greasy. \n\nBest part of the night is the dessert! They allow each person at the table to select one from 4 options: Mango pudding, sesame dessert, turtle pudding, and one more that I can't remember.", "author": "Connie C."}

It's better than some of the other Chinese restaurants there are in SF, and definitely NOT Americanized (which means all the local Sunset folks go there, not tourists)! The owner is very nice and always has a great attitude, which makes the dining experience more pleasant.\n\nDinner always starts off with some free marinated chicken feet, YUM! These are pretty tasty, especially since there's a hint of spiciness to it. Best of all, it's FREE! \n\nTypical dishes my family orders:\n1) Crab \nI've tried both the egg yolk style, and the fried garlic, green onions, dry style (not sure what to call it... not the traditional stir fry crab with ginger and green onions, wet style though). The crabs are always gigantic and fresh! Flavors are good, though I think I prefer R&G Lounge...? \n\n2) Chicken Wings (with that sweet and mild spicy sauce, similar to San Tung)\nPretty tasty as wel, but I think I still prefer San Tung's because the ones here are the wet style, not dried. I prefer mine the San Tung way\n\n3) Beef Strips with fried garlic\nHit or a miss. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's too salty... \n\n4) Singaporean Style Noodles\nJust enough kick to it, and uses lots of ingredients, unlike some places which is literally all noodles\n\n5) Pork Chops 2 styles (Peking style, and fried)\nLike the peking style more cause of the sauce, but the meat is way too tender (yes, it can be a bad thing...) It was mushy already by the time I took my first bite\n\nDon't really remember the other dishes I've tried here, but can't complain too much about them. They are generally good, with some exceptions. Dinner ends with \"home made\" desserts of your choice - red bean soup, green bean soup, mango pudding, black sesame paste, that black bitter thing that looks like grass jelly. I think the prices are pretty reasonable too, and more on the inexpensive side!", "author": "Michelle L."}

When we finally found parking, we still had to walk up 2 fat hills to the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant was also crowded and the wait took nearly 30 minutes for a table for the four of us. You can easily tell that our night is off to a rough start.\n\nWhen finally seated, our table was sticky as an adhesive sticker with a fishy odor and debris leftover from the previous party. \n\nWe ordered the Steamed Bass with soy sauce, Steamed gai-lan with oyster sauce and pork spare-rib with black bean sauce. The fish is very delicate and soft to eat, although we had to work on stripping the fish meat from the scale. The gai-lan was tender and very crunchy, and the sparerib is very juicy with the meat falling apart from the bone. Our $30.00 meal came with rice, tea, red-bean soup and bland orange wedges.

We walked in without a reservation and was seated immediately.  We ordered 6 dishes, the best dish was the Peking spare ribs.  The other dishes were not bad but just on the average scale.  The most I didn't like about was the service - the waiter never came by to refill the tea and takes forever to get the check.  We actually had to fill the tea ourselves.  With this low level of service, they even had the guts to force a 15% tips on our bill.  I was really upset, but after seeing the bill only came out to be less than $60 in total, I thought the value somehow made it up for the bad service (they gave us free dessert, too).

Who doesn't love the sweet lady owner and her great food?! I used to live a block away and came here every now and then. I didn't come back since I moved to south city two years ago. Also, I've been hearing bad experiences about this place so I didn't have a reason to come back.\n\nTonight the girlfriend wanted a crab dinner so I went on to yelp to find if there's any place else besides the usual PPQ or Hakka. I was like... \"not sure if Yan Yan has improved\". The next thing I know, thanks to Debbie K.'s post, the sweet lady is BACK!!!\n\nArrived at 7pm and found a space right in front of the restaurant. In case you don't know the neighborhood, finding a space in front or within the same block of where you want to go is like winning a mini lottery. We walked in and found that familiar happy face, yeah! She's indeed BACK! Long time no see and she actually recognized us.\n\nIt wasn't busy. We could seat anywhere we wanted. First thing to notice is that they have very clean stone table tops. The beautiful hand written menu on the walls are gone. I miss that. That was an art piece. Ok, on to the...\n\nFOOD\n\n- Chicken feet (Lo Shui): Cold complimentary app.  Really good! I kinda remembered they once served Lo Shui duck wings for comp app but my gf think not. \n- Deep fried pigeon: Very tasty with gamey flavor. Yes, pigeon should taste gamey. You know what I'm talking about if you can taste the different between a roasted duck and a roasted goose.\n- Fish fillet tofu clay pot: It's ok. The sauce is flavorful without using too much starch in order to thicken it up. However, the batter is too thick on the fillet.\n- Crab in Dai-Pai-Don style: Wonderful! Yes, it's greasy and super high in cholesterol. Guilty pleasure at its finest!\n- Deserts: 5 offerings - Red bean sweet soup, green bean sweet soup, sesame sweet soup, turtle jelly, and last but not least mango pudding. C'mon, FIVE deserts to choose from?! This is off the hook! We've got turtle jelly and mango pudding. The turtle jelly came with a small dish of ginger syrup on the side, very thoughtful and tasted great. Well, the mango pudding... as no doubt of guess, as good as before! \n\nSERVICE\n\nWe need to compare apple to apple here. Granted it's a very typical hole in the wall Chinese family restaurant in the Sunset. I think the service is above average. We all know the lady owner is adorable. I still want to credit the wait staffs on doing above and beyond  what a canto family joint can offer. Dirty plates were replaced timely, tea pots were refilled, foods were placed on the table and arranged in the way that convenient to you instead of being just dropped in front of you.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nCan we start a new threat on the new Yan Yan on yelp? I think it's unfair that the perilous owner had ruined its repetition. Good food, really good food, but is it the only game in town? I think PPQ and Hakka are as good around the area in terms of crab dish offerings. What stands out is the neighbor feel of it. Throughout the night we over heard that most of the customers were backed because of the owner change. Please keep on coming. Very often we drive miles to check out great restaurants.

Very funny and easy going personality.  We might go back again.  The prices overall wasn't too bad either.", "author": "Selina L."}

Literally a local hole in the wall dishing out some authentic Cantonese flavors, it hides itself away in a small place with dirty carpets... Ok to be fair I really don't know if they are dirty but I mean carpet n restaurants... I can only imagine that a buffet of goodies has once laid victim there.  But then again it doesn't bother me because most Chinese restaurants have carpets.  Their food is solid and they have live seafood... An absolute must.  I love their lobster e-fu noodles aka yee mein.  Had that for lunch yesterday.  Fresh live lobster stir fried with green onions n ginger over an anything but healthy fluffy soft doughy bites of yee mein.  Slap some of their tasty chili sauce on there for a light kick.  Yums!  Their braised brisket beef in a clay pot is super flavorful.  Better get off that low carb diet because you're gonna want to drench that steamy fluffy mountain of white rice with that savory sauce.  The rest of their extensive menu isn't bad... You want something you got it.  Let them know your preference n how you want it made.  Can't go wrong here.

My favorite dishes are the honey walnut prawns, bbq spareribs, calamari, bbq beef with green beans, and oyster. I think this place is a tad bit more pricey than other  chinese restaurants by a few dollars for each dish, but definitely worth it for the quality and taste! My family of 5 usually eat for about $80 plus tip and we get 8 dishes and a bunch of rice. complimentary chicken feet at the beginning of the meal while you wait for your food, and complimentary dessert  at the end of the meal.

If you are in the mood for the hk style chow mein and chow fun, they make it great here too. If you need any recommendations, just ask Kat. She always has good ideas. And this is a first for any Chinese restaurant I've ever been too. There are a handful of dessert choices for you to choose from if you eat dinner there. Normally at any particular Chinese restaurant, you'll get the standard red bean soup offered for dessert. Yan Yan however offers you that PLUS mango pudding, sweet black sesame soup, etc. You actually get choices! SCORE!\n\nI've been here numerous of times and had good food and service every time.

As promised, I am a fair writer. Restaurants that deserve credit gets tons of blessing, and ones that are not up to par, deserve the needed spanking. My goal is to save your money/time/indisgestion from horrible restaurants.\n\nCraving fried salt and pepper spare ribs, I wanted to eat at some value Chinese restaurant. My mom's hair cutter recommended Yan Yan on Judah St. in the Sunset district. Walking through the doorway, a seafood, no I meant a mud tank filled with seafood greeted me. Arriving at 6pm, we were the first diners. Like a ghost town, I was surprised this dilapidated restaurant had survived the times. Our waiter, a college looking young man, lacked any kind of service skills. He looked as if the owner went to the local community college, used a megaphone and yelled \"anybody want to be a waiter. hurlie up!\" With his over sized white shirt, he took our order. He lacked prescence and did not have any personal skills. He reminded me of a chicken who just hatched into this word. Getting a sticky feeling from the filthy floors and walls, my only hope was the food.\n\nFood.\nThe salt and pepper spare ribs were under flavored. Great salt and pepper needs to be cooked the right way. Pork is flash fried in sizzling oil at high temperature. In Chinese cooking, its called \"wok-air.\" Chilli bits are then tossed with salt and pepper mix. Dam it. Just mix it thoroughly. Our Westlake soup was simple flat in taste. The oyster based soup were showered with chives and mushroom. The beef and vegetable gave me a hint of hope. Nevertheless, the beef was though in texture. A breathe of light was the squad. Small bird fried. The result was a crispy skin with moist meat. For three, we spend $40 including tax and tip.", "author": "Rayfil W."}

Like other chinese restaurants in the Sunset, Yan Yan packs the tables in tight, the decor is an afterthought but the food is great!!\n\nHere are some insights:\n\n1- The steamed chicken with ginger and scallions seems to always turn out quite tender and juicy.  I don't know how they do it but I have not found another Chinese restaurant that is as consistent.\n\n2- The seafood and tofu claypot is my new favorite dish.  Scallops, shrimp, squid, and fish are intertwined with pieces of tofu in a very tasty brownish sauce.  The flavors in this dish are unique to my tastebuds and I thoroughly enjoy adding the sauce to some steamed rice- yummmm....\n\n3- The beef and tofu (w/out rice) is always filling and tasty.  A staple of my order each time.\n\n4- The peking spareribs always make a mess- the sweet red sauce slathered over the deep fried pork chops are a wonderful combination.  \n\n5- The E Fu noodles are not as good as other restaurants.\n\n6- I hate ordering over the telephone since I don't speak Chinese.  I've found that when my mom orders over the phone, the order is always ready to go when promised.  The times when I've ordered over the phone (speaking English) my order was not ready when promised.

I love the eggplant.  Perfectly spicy and garlicky + generous portions to boot).  The kung pao chicken was also really good - chalked full of water chestnuts and white meat chicken. Not the gamey parts-is-parts dark meat usually served in most chinese chicken dishes.  The green beans were good.  A little soggy/greasy but great flavor.", "author": "Lola Z."}

It's changed ownership over the years but I can't complain if I'm not the one paying right? During lunch time, this place is always packed with Chinese contractors, painters, construction workers, you name it. I suggest coming here en masse and ordering a set dinner menu. The appetizers aren't that great but the crab dish and e-mein are pretty good. For Chinese food, this place was alright since its also close to our studio. =]", "author": "Jason C. J."}

It was the first time eating here and we ended up ordering a LOT of stuff. I don't even know the names of the stuff we ate either. We had some mushroom chow mein, some fried fish with some type of corn, thick clear sauce, some vegetable dishes, bbq pork spare ribs, egg flower soup, fish and some other stuff I don't remember. I even tried their chicken feet (or more like TRIED to eat) but I didn't know it was cold and rubbery so I didn't end up eating it because I thought it was going to be similar to the one I tried at Dim Sum King which wasn't bad at all. The owner was a very nice lady and funny too. We then had our choices for dessert of either sesame paste, red bean paste or mango pudding. I got mango pudding which was good. Overall, all the dishes I tried were okay. Nothing really gave me a wow in my mouth to really like it. Very fast and good service though.", "author": "Sean E."}

I love the dragon like design of the ceiling tiles and white walls with pink table cloths, traditional and simple.  The service is very friendly and prices reasonable.  The pot stickers are wonderful; crispy golden yet not doughy with a wonderful ground pork, ginger, and cabbage filling.  The egg rolls, though a little greasy, are good with a crispy badder for the most part and a wonderful ground pork and vegetable filling.  The chicken crispy mein is wonderful with tender chicken and fresh vegetables over crispy noodles that are not soggy from the gravy.  The Hong Kong spareribs are crispy and tender with just the perfect amount of sweet and sour sauce which is pretty much glazed on with sweet pineapple.  AS a Caucasian, I love speaking the limited amount of Cantonese I know; so when said thank and bye bye, I the two waitresses and waiter were all marbled.  I will definitely return.  Oh, my mother went next door to Lets Cupcake (see my review) while we waited and the waitress here at Yan Yan gave us a bag for the box of sweet delights which was another personal touch.  So, for excellent Cantonese cuisine at reasonable prices with friendly service in a casual clean atmosphere, Yan Yan cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}

The foods remain excellent, but the service is not quite the same. The nice waiter who came to change our plates were not there any more, and we had to request for clean plates. Although the woman owner is friendly,  she does not always come around to see if all was going well -- we had to ask for more paper napkins, and tea. Having said that, we would still go back for the delicious food and give it a 4 star. As for the service, it deserves a 3.", "author": "Lisa C."}
