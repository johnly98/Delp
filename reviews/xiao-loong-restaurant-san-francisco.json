I was starving, so we decided to meet up for dinner at Xiao Loong Restaurant in West Portal. (One of the boys suggested the restaurant as he's been here before.) I believe my girlfriend called ahead and made a same day reservation for our party of five. The three of us arrived first on Saturday, January 6th around 7:45pm.\n\n*Xiao Loong Bow: hand rolled thin chinese pastry, stuffed with ginger marinated ground pork, then steamed 'til plump and juicy ($10.95)\n*Dry Sauteed Green Beans: fresh green beans, flash-fried and tossed with a mixture of fresh minced ginger, chopped garlic, minced preserved chinese turnips, and roasted red hot peppers in house soy sauce ($11.95)\n*Mongolian Beef: tender sliced beef sauteed with green onions, julienned yellow onions, and roasted red hot peppers in house sauce served on a bed of crispy rice noodles ($12.95)\n*Spicy Garlic Pork Belly Fried Rice: jasmine white rice stir fried with garlic, chilis, green onion, egg and tender stewed pork belly ($11.95)\n*Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken: chicken thigh meat marinated with garlic, ginger, pepper, and five spice powder lightly battered and flash fried topped with crisp basil ($9.95)\n*Dry Sauteed Brussel Sprouts: fresh brussel sprouts, flash-fried and tossed with a mixture of dried spices, fresh minced ginger, chopped garlic, minced preserved chinese turnips, and roasted red hot peppers in house soy sauce ($12.50)\n*Sizzling Rice Soup: shredded chicken, shrimp, water chestnuts, sliced shiitake mushrooms, peas, and spinach in a light chicken broth topped with sizzling rice served tableside ($14 large)\n*Xiao Loong's Hot Braised Fish: daily fish topped with a rich spicy mixture of minced black mushrooms, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, fresh ginger, chili, and garlic ($14.95)\n*Hunan Hot Pepper Pork: julienned pork stir-fried with jalapeno pepper and onion in a spicy sichuan sauce ($11.95)\n*Steamed Jasmine White Rice ($2)\n*Tsingtao ($4.50) x8\n*Lichee Congou Black ($3.50)\n\nWe had so much food! But we actually managed to finish most of it. I adored the veggies. The greens beans retained a crunch and the brussels were nicely fried. I was excited to try the fish and xiao long bao as those are two of my favorite dishes. I thought the XLB had good flavor, but they weren't that soupy. The fish wasn't the dish I was thinking of, but it was cooked nicely. (I wanted the fish cooked in chili oil.) The soup and fried rice were also tasty. I love brothy soups, so this hit the spot. The pork belly added a nice meatiness to the fried rice. I'm not big on saucy meat dishes, so I thought the mongolian beef and pork were okay. The popcorn chicken wasn't quite as savory as the one from boba tea shops (probably cuz of the lack of MSG?), but it was a nice deep fried dish.\n\nCute Sichuan spot in West Portal. Definitely fed our hungry bellies.", "author": "Elena N."}

I ordered the lamb. For $7.75 that was a pretty good deal. Should have known...when the food came, there was a good amount of rice, however, as i got to the sliced meat, i noticed it sat on a big bed of yellow onions, green onions, dried chillis (10 of 'em i counted!!!). So, the meat was *very* skimp. i think the pile of onions weighed 3x more than my meat. I'm not much of a meat glutton, but, i felt it was a lit' smller than a child's portion sized.

But nope, they are all English speaking servers and fully English menu. I was okay with it. Here is my rating chart, all out of 5.\n\nRestaurant space: 3/5-super small, so small that you barely able to move between tables, you pretty much can't sit back to back with people on the back of your table\n\nService: 4/5- it was fair in my case even though the waiter forgot few things on my order. \n\nAppearance:3.5/5- the interior looks nice and the Lightning is great. One thing that bothers me is their menu. They are so sketchy if you compare it with the interior. They use paperclip to hold one of the page of the loose menu(maybe redesign and reprint a new menu?)\n\nTaste:3.5/5- I and my uncle ordered a plate Black Bean Chicken, String Bean and 3 orders of Combination Fried Rice(because we assumed the portion is not going be big and we were right). The String Bean was pretty good(genuine with Wok Hey\u9505\u6c14) and Fried Rice had strong favor and smell of egg and we loved it.

Had lunch here today and it was more that enough. \n\nI actually planned to come here because in my past attempts they have been closed.\n\nSo, today made perfect sense especially with the gorgeous weather in San Francisco. I got here around noon and walked straight in. I took a seat near the back corner. \n\nThis place has a unique vibrant style to it. There is a lot of gray on the interior but it works well. The staff is very polite and welcoming. The staff apparently have to be in formal wear which is cool. Service is quick and painless. There is rushing to place to an order but they actually say, \"Take your time\". BAM!!!!! This is how you keep customers coming back. Comforting words go a long way in customer service. \n\nAs far as the food goes it was what I needed. I had haven't had Chinese food in some time so it was nice to get something different. But of course I get my usual order, that I couldn't help, Mongolian Beef. It was on the lunch menu and I had to. The only difference in this order compared to the others was that I chose brown rice over the white rice. When I saw the plate coming to my table I knew that I had made the right choice for lunch. \n\nThe plate looked amazing as it was brought over to my table. The orange slice is always a nice addition to the meal as well. The food was good. Just the right portions of beef to rice. That ratio is always important because if you have too much rice you will get full quicker. FYI, keep an out for places that do that because they will compensate for the shorting you on other stuff by putting more rice on YOUR PLATE!!! \n\n(Side Note: The more interesting thing about this lunch was the conversation that was going on 2 table away. They were discussing their Christian faith which I found to be a breath of fresh air. It is not too often that people discuss that openly but it was nice to see that people are getting more comfortable in doing so.)\n\nBack to the meal. The food was good and I would recommend this place. Parking might be terrible because there always seems to be heavy traffic along with construction on the streets. My suggestion take public transit or park in the residential and walk over. \n\nEnjoy and happy eating. The doctor is OUT!!!!", "author": "Robert F."}

Maybe it was just the sour-faced clientele that evening since it sure didn't have the hustle-bustle feel of Chinatown or even the Inner Richmond (photo: http://bit.ly/1E9l66E). It's West Portal after all, a neighborhood that feels to me like someone took a piece of a peninsula suburb like San Carlos or Redwood City and transplanted it into this part of the city. I came here by happenstance since I just decided to stay on the M-Line longer. It certainly looked inoffensive enough in here, and I felt guilty for being seated at a table for four since they didn't look like they catered to solitary diners.\n\nThat became clear when I saw the huge portions being served at the other tables, and it was also reflected in the higher-than-Chinatown prices in their voluminous menu (10 pages and counting). And yet, I was kinda starving so I threw caution to the wind and ordered away. First up were the $8.50 Steamed Vegetarian Pot Stickers, a half-dozen huge ones in a bamboo steam basket filled with minced Shiitake mushrooms, Napa cabbage, tofu and mung bean thread (photo: http://bit.ly/1LoeCDf). They were steaming hot and pretty tasty with the hot mustard, but I could make my way through only half of them. It was clear that the daily special, the $10.95 Spicy Garlic Pork Belly Fried Rice was meant for a family but here I was scooping piles of it on my plate to devour.\n\nThe stewed pork belly was a nice carnivorous touch, but the rest of it was a generic pile of starch with garlic, green onion, chili pepper and scrambled egg (photo: http://bit.ly/1JmchC7). I think the carb overload made me a bit delirious because I dared to order a third dish, the $10.50 Spicy Sichuan Garlic Eggplant, which was nice and tender since they use the smaller Japanese eggplant but with a kick thanks to the special garlic sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1MHT1WO). I know I porked for $35, but at least I had some decent leftovers for lunch the following day. The service was quite attentive and downright cordial, and judging from the rest of the customers, you could already tell they respect their elders. Hey, at least it wasn't a hipster hangout.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...hefty portions go along with the hefty prices but the overall quality is quite good\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...like going to a restricted country club\nSERVICE - 4 stars...young Asians can be nice...see?\nTOTAL - 4 stars...conservative Chinese spot is worthy of a return visit...with a large party", "author": "Ed U."}

The very young waiter was unsure about the actual ingredients of this dish--so more training would be a good idea. Regardless-- it is a fabulous dish. I ordered my fave dish xiao long bao. Sadly what they serve is not a soup dumpling. The dumplings are the size of a softball--about 3 times the size of a proper soup dumpling. The pork mixture was good but there was no broth inside. Hello--the broth inside is what makes it xiao long bao which is different than a giant potsticker. It's ironic that they named the restaurant after a classic dish they don't actually make.

The atmosphere and decor are simple but it brings out a good vibe. The windows had many scratches from the outside. It's quite small but they managed to have a lot of searing inside. The services kept me content, asking if everything was okay and filled my water immediately. However, there was an instance where the water was warm. The food came out warm and every plate came with rice. Overall the food was good. I recommend their pan pacific fried wonton. It was very flavorful, being crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside. The fried rice is like most fried rice. Their beef and broccoli was better than most. It was very tender and the sauce did not over power the dish.", "author": "Joshua L."}

Chinese food will always hit the spot as long as it's not frozen in the refrigerated aisle or in the super markets deli but I know that there are far better choices out there and especially in San Francisco California of all places! The moo shu pork sometimes arrives lukewarm and crepes or pancakes that come with it are under par in flavor and quality compared to other places I have tried. Just like pizza Chinese food always tastes good but I know it's not top notch though. \n\nWe had these old friends, \"the Wang's\" who would invite us out for Chinese food every year around christmas and they really knew their stuff and exactly where to go!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-15", "description": "We had some family over for dinner tonight and decided to try Xiao Loong rather than our normal go-to, Emmy's.  We ordered:\nXiao Loong Bow\nWonton Soup\nXiao Loong's Steamed Fish \nBroccoli Beef     \nSpicy Dry Fried Chicken      \nXiao Loong's House Chicken      \nPork chow mein\nPork fried rice\nSnow Pea Sprouts and Garlic \n\nFirst, the bad: my family was disappointed by the lack of a Fish in Black Bean sauce and Honey Walnut Prawns on the menu. It's entirely possible the restaurant would have made a Fish in Black Bean sauce if I had asked, but since this was our first time ordering I figured I'd stick to what was on the menu. I get the sense that they are trying to make slightly more authentic Chinese food than your average run-of-the-mill Chinese joint, so that likely explains why there is no General Tsao's chicken or Honey Walnut Prawns on the menu. Also, it's definitely a $$ Chinese restaurant (at least for dinner) -- the above was just over $100, or $120 with the delivery tip included. From Emmy's, that would have been closer to $60. That said, $120 to feed 5 adults and one toddler isn't crazy money for SF. Ordering via phone was a little tough -- even at 5:15pm on a Sunday there was a ton of background noise which made it difficult to communicate with the woman taking the order (though she was very polite in not correcting me in what I am sure was a terrible butchering of the pronunciation of \"xiao\").\n\nDelivery took 45 minutes, which is fine, since that's exactly how long they said it would take.\n\nOn to the good!  The food was wonderful. Their XLB was delightful, even having been delivered -- I suspect it would be even better in the restaurant. Wonton Soup wasn't particularly flavorful - probably won't order it again - but the dumplings were gingery and the broth and greens were innocuous. Broccoli Beef was top-notch, with a deep brown sauce and pretty good broccoli florets (you could tell they came from the frozen food aisle, but hey, it's November!). My favorite was the Dry Fried Chicken -- they put the spicy sauce on the side which allowed the less spicy inclined members of my family to put just a dash, whereas I dunked each morsel of dry-fried breast meat in the chili-laden red sauce. The Xiao Loong house chicken was also good, with a pretty delicate flavor profile. In fact, nothing other than the red spicy sauce and the brown sauce in the broccoli beef had a particularly strong flavor, but the flavors the dishes did have were balanced and pleasant.  Also, they were happy to make 2 of the dishes from the menu that were marked as 'spicy' as mild instead -- very appreciative of their accommodation for the less-spicy loving members of the family.\n\nThe Snow Pea Sprouts and Garlic wasn't what I was expecting, and wasn't to my liking -- though that probably stems from a misunderstanding on my part of what a \"snow pea stem\" is. I read that and assumed it would be something like a snow pea -- which I love -- but it was moreso the leaf and stalk of -- what I presume is -- a snow pea plant. Won't order it again, but that's not to say it's a bad dish -- it's just not my thing.\n\nOverall, a very good experience with Xiao Loong Bow and I look forward to our next delivery.", "author": "Paul L."}

This restaurant is a prime example of what I've come to expect of the average American-born xiao long bao: resembles the original form on sight, slightly thicker skin, with something not quite right about the interior.  In this case, not enough \"soup\" inside the dumpling, though still fairly tasty.  These XLB are of the larger variety, which, in my humble opinion doesn't diminish their authenticity, but I happen to prefer the smaller versions.\n\nOther dishes are standard to very good.  The jiaozi (pot-stickers) are decent, but the real show-stopper last Saturday was the spicy asparagus veggie side: perfectly flavored, not overcooked, not too greasy, just divine. \n\nAmbiance is quite pleasant, with prompt, efficient service.  Easily seated on a weekend night.\n\nI'll go back, but I'm still searching for the perfect xiao long bao.

I have no idea where my experiences live on the authenticity spectrum, but I do know tasty. \n\nThat being said, this is my new spot. Xiao Loong has great food at a good price. Their lunch special is fantastic if your dining alone, but even better if you're sharing with others. The lunch: One item, from a short list, with rice and soup for around $7. The short list, which is not that short, includes variations of veggies, chicken, pork, beef, tofu, and seafood. Everything I've tried is excellent but the house chicken stands out the most. I also enjoy their chicken chowmein, which features pieces of lightly fried chicken mixed into the noodles after they've been cooked. My favourite has to be the egg and corn soup they serve for lunch. It is not offered as a separate item on the menu, It only comes with lunch. \n\nThe location is quaint, clean, and modern. It feels like an upscale restaurant without the upscale prices. \n\nWhat makes this place my new favourite Chinese restaurant is the service. Matt is my waiter almost every time I eat here.

The ambiance is classy and the service is phenomenal.  They have a great selection of dumplings, though personally I like the pot stickers.  They're huge and a little oily (but what do you expect?), but they are REALLY tasty.\n\nThey have a Mongolian Lamb to die for, with angry red chilies staring you down as you scoop up the delicious goodness onto your plate.    It is very easy to order too much food here because it all looks so darn good.  On the other hand, you get a tasty lunch (or breakfast) the next day so it's totally worth it.\n\nThe steamed fish seems to be a popular dish, but it is a big portion and usually it is too much for two people.  Good for family style though.  The spicy tofu and string beans are great as are ALL of their clay pot dishes.\n\nYou do have to pay for tea, which kind of bucks the trend of other Chinese restaurants, however the selection of tea is much better than what you'll find on Irving Street or Clement Street.  Incidentally, their tea selection is only to be outdone by their wine selection.  Jeff knows quite a bit about wine, and if you're a wine snob, you can definitely trust his selection.  \n\nAll in all, this is a great place to take a date, or go with your family (both of which I've done.)

Fresh, well-flavored, never greasy, always high quality--Xiao Loong has spoiled us for most other Chinese restaurants. But it's not just the good food, it's the lovely service. All of the staff are warm, personable and professional. I always appreciated the service but this morning the service went above and beyond: last night my daughter had a friend visiting from out of town, and we took her Xiao Loong of course, because she wanted Chinese food.  The girl left her purse in the restaurant, which included her boarding pass for her flight the next afternoon (when the restaurant would be closed). I emailed the owner and he called me back immediately--on an early Sunday morning. They had the purse, they had tried to find us after we left the night before, AND he met me at the restaurant, on his morning off, to open up and give us the purse. Now, that is service--and a shout to West Portal too, for having such a lovely small town feel in the middle of our big city. Great good and great service--both the expected kind (in the restaurant) and the unexpected (on a Sunday morning, when it was closed!).", "author": "Sharon E."}

It's not to say that the food isn't authentic, but it's definitely Americanized.  The space is small, but really cute.  The service was great.

Tonight was the first time it was open when we've passed it after a Stern Grove concert so I was excited to try it, since I am a big fan of xiao long bao, and with the restaurant named after the dish, what else am I supposed to expect but great succulent baos, right?  It turned out that they were actually the most disappointing dish we ordered.  We were already forewarned when the server brought our order to us without the traditional dipping sauce of shredded young ginger in red vinegar.  They did make it for us when we asked for it.  But when we tried the dumplings, we knew immediately that they were quite off.  They were way to big, making them hard to eat in 1 bite, and the soup inside ended up leaking out instead of just bursting in your mouth.  The dough was also quite thick, more suitable for potstickers, which was a much better dish of the 2 that we ordered.  We also ordered the dry sauteed green beans, so fresh and crunchy, just the way I expected it to be.  The service is friendly, the decor is modern Chinese.

The ambiance was professional and elegant (not the typical Chinese restaurant decor); the service was efficient and expeditious, the prices were MORE THAN reasonable, but the food was the real star!!! Everything was flavorful, with clear flavor palettes and unmuddled taste profiles; The WON-TON soup was flavorful and delicious, a pleasant change from the limp dumplings in dishwater that so many Chinese restaurants pass off on unsuspecting eaters! The Mongolian Beef was very flavorful and well presented, with crisp yet not overpowering flavors; The shrimp with 5 Chinese spices was amazing: just the right combination of sweet/hot.. amazing flavor profile! And the Lemon chicken... I have to admit I wasn't the one in our group that ordered it because I am so used to lemon chicken being over-coated and drenched in lemon \"goop\" that tastes like lemon AJAX dish soap.. but THIS lemon chicken was moist, pleasantly lightly coated with a gentle batter, and the lemon sauce was a sauce and not a glop, with a crisp and cleansing citrus flavor that complimented the sweet hot of the shrimp and the deep flavor of the beef! Overall... a definite gem to add to your repertoire! The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that i don't give out 5 stars unless its a once-in a -lifetime experience..

We are Din Tai Fung Foodies (Down in SoCal, Arcadia - best Dumpling House ever) so we are always interested in something out here. We only tried two items since we had just finished lunch but we somehow always have room to try out new stuff. The family ordered the Fried Won Ton which had a filling and the Xiao Long Bao, To- Go, of which we loved both items. The wrapper was a bit thicker on the Xiao Long Bao than what we prefer but the filling was very flavorful and good sized. Although, we live about 50 minutes away in the East Bay we plan to come back and try some of the other dishes. The menu sounded very good and hitting 2 out of 2 on the take-out, we suspect we will find other dishes that we will like.

Disappointing to say the least.  Very, very laden with sodium (but then, isn't most Chinese food soaked in salt-laden sauce?) - an hour and a half later I'm chugging glass-after-glass of water.  On one account I returned the house chicken because it was badly overcooked and very tough.  Some of the pieces are far too large to put in your mouth - and no knives are provided to easily cut it (not with chopsticks, of course).  Few dishes are offered without soy sauce (an issue for wheat allergic or gluten intolerant).\n\nJeff, the owner, is pleasant and courteous although the wait staff is socially sterile and devoid of any pleasantries - not even a reciprocated smile. Crowded tables make for little privacy and intimacy.  I see similar behavior at most Chinese restaurants.\n\nPrices? You'll get a LOT more for your money at Eric's on Church St. with more choices (but substantially more rude waiters). Yes, Xiao Loong is pricey in contrast with MANY other nearby Chinese restaurants. Clean, yes, but NOT standout in ambience - whatsoever.  I REFUSE to buy a pot of Jeff's tea - outrageously overpriced.
