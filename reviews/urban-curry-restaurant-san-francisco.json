I've tried EVERYWHERE in the city trying to replace urban curry (eat24 minimum hurts the wallet after years) and you just will not find better. The sauce is thick and perfect for dunking naan, delivery is made to order so is always fresh, chicken itself has flavor and you can change up your spice level based on your mood (not one size fits all buffet food). \n\nPro tips: \"chicken makhani= butter chicken\", eat24/ Grubhub is easiest but has a high delivery minimum, uber eats has no min but is a higher delivery fee OR if you want to go through the SUPER painful process of calling and ordering, the rice is included in all curry orders (where ordering online charges 2.00).

Our delivery order arrived via Caviar on Friday, July 6th around 12:30pm.\n\nI ended up getting one of the Appetizers ($2.10) - Samosa: Fried pastry filled with potatoes and peas, Two pieces (+$3.15). The samosas were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I did ask for extra mint chutney and no tamarind chutney, but they ended up giving me one of each. Would have been better with two mint chutneys as one was only enough for one samosa. And I didn't order curry or anything else to give it some moisture. A coworker got the chicken tikka masala, extra spicy and it was actually really hot. So if you like heat, Urban Curry will deliver.\n\nPrice wise, I think this spot is a little expensive. $13.65 for chicken tikka masala is a little pricey in my opinion. I probably would have ordered my whole lunch from this spot if their price points were lower. Maybe that's the price you pay for being in North Beach? Based solely on my app, I'd say 3 stars.", "author": "Elena N."}

Love that this place offers chowmein.\n\nHow convenient that you could order online and set your level of spiciness. I chose to get the highest level of spiciness, which was not too spicy. Both the tikka masala and korma were rich and flavorful. We also ordered a side of garlic naan, which I think could have been a bit more garlicky, but nevertheless, it was still great naan.

I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala via MealPal and was excited to try a new place, especially one that offers Nepalese food. If my lunch had been good, I'd go back to eat in. However, the lunch plate was not satisfying in that they only gave me two chunks of chicken. Yes, I got plenty of rice and a side of Saag Paneer but really? Just two small chunks of chicken? The flavors were good but the temperature was not that hot. They did scoop it out of the steam table for me when I arrived so maybe it was hot enough to eat there. Urban Curry, you didn't win me over to come try you again. I really wanted to like you. They were friendly there and the place looked nice.", "author": "Jen L."}

Figured this place would be good with 4 stars yelp & 500+ reviews. Nope this place sucked. Never received our basket of naan. Small selection. The tandoori chicken was awfully dry. The chunks of chicken breast in the chicken tikka Marsala was also dry. Vegetable pakora was a bit doughy. Random dish of chow mein was burnt at the bottom and they never whipped up a fresh batch. They have gas burners keeping the food hot. Flame appeared to be on med-high which was too high and dried out the chicken. They should really invest in a buffet steam table. I was there for about an hour and they never added more lamb curry. I spent a good 2 mins combing thru the lamb curry and found nothing but bones with pea sized bits of meat. \n\nTheir Aloo Gobi was the only good dish. Which is why I rated 2 stars instead of 1. \n\nBeen to 20+ Indian buffets in Bay Area. Urban curry ranks on the lower end of the spectrum. My friend and I left disappointed.", "author": "Jason X."}

The spice was on point. Usually, I put medium and it comes out mild for me. I also have a higher tolerance for spice than my peers. Also, I lived in India for 6 months and knew what spice was. Lol the vindaloo met my expectations. It wasn't the absolute best I've had, but good.\n\nThe korma was a bit too sweet for my taste. There were decent sized veggies, but I wish there was more. Instead of one giant piece of paneer, cauliflower, and potato, I wish they had cut them up a little smaller and given me more veggies. \n\nAnother reason I am giving 4 stars is because their roti was OK.

Yep, that's the place.\n\nI met my friend O (Hey look at this, I'm getting better at indexing friends' names!) at a music venue, like most people I meet I often become, subconsciously or unconsciously their wing woman, now exactly why I am a friend material is beyond me but what do you do when you have time to kill and friends to see? You go and have a nice and quiet meal and share ideas and thoughts. Such was one evening. After parking at the edge of North Beach and Chinatown we walked down Columbus and found this joint on Broadway to park ourselves for some delicious curry and biryani. He got curry lamb and I got goat biryani. Wish we had brought dental floss. Biryani was surprisingly spicy and delicious. Better than most I've had. Plain naan to dip into the curry lamb sauce.\n\nThe food is good but not exceptional. The restaurant has a really good vibe. I would say that it veers towards traditional side, After Dosa on Valencia and varies other southern Indian places you'd get in the Mission, Northern Indian isn't bad after all. You just forget about coming here because you are in the heart of other worldly cuisine heaven. \n\nWe got along quite well. He's got the rugged good looks, I've got wry sense of humor with a drunken woman's laugh (except I can't drink to save my life) with too much teeth showing when laughing, we are from the opposite end of the worlds, yet somehow between the beer and curry, I knew everything I needed to know about this man and he me. I see eating a very social event. I take eating seriously. I like restaurants that facilitated the eating experience, rather than rushing people through and taking themselves too seriously. \n\nO says that often he came here after being in the studio making music to grab some curry and read a book. I can see him doing that, alone, a lot. He's a solitary man. I told him that next time if he needs to read a book I'm happy to join him at this joint.

Looks like my default Indian restaurant, Shalimar, doesn't deliver so after perusing on EAT24, Urban Curry showed up as the best reviews for Indian food.\n\nI ordered a lot of food:\n\n1) Goat Vindaloo: asked for spicy but turned out mild and only about four chunks of lamb meat.  Flavor was good.\n2) Chicken Tandoori: flavorful and moist meat\n3) Goat Biryani: needed something carby to balance out the other protein dishes.  I'd pass on this because not spicy at all (again ordered spicy), flavorless, and it contained goat bone bits which I had to spit out. \n4) Samosa: big and loaded with potatoes.  This gets my approval.  Came with tamarind and yogurt sauce.\n5) Roti: excellent for curry dipping, but I do prefer Indonesian roti better\n6) Garlic naan: I think this was mislabeled because it had the exact doughey consistency of the roti but with garlic in it.  Naan should be crispier.\n\nOverall, I think Urban Curry is worth another take out order as the delivery time was prompt and the food was satisfactory for our Indian craving.  Next time, I'll call them up and emphasize spicier dishes and none of this mild flavoring bs.  This isn't the type of restaurant I'd go out of my way of since there's better places to eat in North Beach.

It's also because I just took out my wisdom tooth and this place had curry so I figure I can slurp on that. We were greeted at the door and seated immediately. They gave us our drinks immediately. The place is quiet and we had dinner here at 6pm. There was probably just us and another couple. The place is decent size. The bathrooms is shared with this other restaurant (you'll see when u walk through). I don't mind. There was 2 stalls. \n\nWe ordered our food and the waiter didn't take long to ask to take our order, which we didn't mind because she asked if we needed more time but we were ready. \n\nWe ordered curry fish, brown rice, curry chicken (which has a complete different taste from fish btw because it had this sweet taste to it) both were mild in spice. We ordered a side of 2 potato samosas. Our total came out to $38.02 btw. Indian food but they also have so many different types of food. Like from Nepalese, Pakistani, & etc. They have vegetarian options which is a plus.\n\nThe portion was decent the price is a little higher because it is the bay. Loved the music selection here. There was like 3 tvs playing news/sports. Cooks were pretty fast. There was probably 4 cooks and 1 waiter. The waiter was friendly and asked a few times for water refills. She even offered us their free tea (it taste like hot soy milk tea or like regular milk tea) but she said it was Chai tea with some milk and other tea leaves and hot water. It was pretty good for me. They even have pretty comfy chairs which I liked because my sister and I have been walking and standing all day from 8am-6pm til dinner time.  \n\nOverall I enjoyed our dinner here. I'm surprised it's not packed....but it is the bay with a billion other places. I would recommend.", "author": "See V."}

There weren't that many different dishes available, and the meats were all cheap. I wanted lamb or goat and all I saw was chicken, chicken, chicken.\n\nSo we ordered from the menu. We had Fish Curry, Lamb Biryani, and a garlic naan.  \n\nThe Fish Curry was very soft and tender, and I liked it a lot. The portion size of the Lamb Biryani was a little smaller than I hoped for (anything less than an obscenely enormous OMG-I-couldn't-possibly-eat-all-that-food-in-one-sitting sized portion is not enough food for me). But the lamb was tender and tasty and complemented the rice well.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was the garlic naan. It was just a little on the crispy side, and not doughy at all. If I had more room in my stomach I would have ordered another one.\n\nOur server was very good. She was very patient with us as we decided on the buffet or the menu. Water glasses were refilled as soon as we emptied them. We were thirsty, so that was pretty often.", "author": "The Bottomless Pi T."}

I'm excited to try the buffet sometime, they had a bunch of tasty-looking options.\n\nAnyway, I got the saag paneer yesterday - it was a pretty nice mix of greens (for the saag) and reasonable paneer. What I liked most was that the dish wasn't creamy at all - this is something that a lot of places do to fill up customers, and it isn't authentic at all. So I was really happy about that. The paneer was decent, but nothing special - it didn't taste like it had been cooked with the saag for very long, because it hadn't absorbed any of those flavors. So that is one thing that could be different, but given that we picked up our order 15 mins after calling it in, I can't be that surprised.\n\nOne BIG plus, (given that it's san francisco) is that entree dishes come with rice! So you don't have to worry about the additional cost of rice. I really value restaurants that do this, because I hate when a place looks super cheap and then you realize it's because they didn't include the cost of rice.

There were four vegetarian dishes, and the others were chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, and goat curry.

Absolutely amazing service; they gave us a great menu that included several vegan options, appetizers, main courses, rice, naan, and dessert, all for an EXTREMELY reasonable price.\n\nEveryone LOVED the food and there was nothing but good feedback for all of the dishes. They have an exceptional catering menu as it is but are very flexible if you want to switch out some dishes for others (for example, I requested samosa for appetizers and changed the chicken vindaloo they originally had on the menu to lamb vindaloo).\n\nMore importantly, their communication was key. I called to place and order and requested an emailed receipt, which I instantly received. They answered all of my questions, honored all my requests, and followed up with everything. They delivered all of our food, still hot, 5 minutes early and were extremely professional.\n\nWould HIGHLY, highly recommend Urban Curry to anyone looking for a flawless catering experience with food that everyone will absolutely love! They're great to work with and I can't say enough good things about the food and service at all levels.", "author": "Chrystal Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-03", "description": "Urban Curry represents my first trip to an Indian buffet. I eat Indian food fairly often but I've never seemed to make it to a lunch buffet. I know Indian food is very Vegetarian friendly but not always the best Vegan option. This being their buffet, I was fully ready to order from the menu since I ASSumed that all or most of the veg dishes would be paneer or cream based. Thankfully, I was wrong as usual.\n\nI was cautious that there would be very little Vegan choices until I talked to the host who went all out to make me welcome here. He showed me which dishes were Vegan and explained how their buffet works. Normally Naan is served with the buffet but the dude even hooked it up with a Vegan whole wheat Roti instead. \n\nAs for the actual buffet line, 3 of the 4 veg options presented were Vegan. The host even offered to have some more Vegan dishes whipped up and added to the buffet line. I declined since all that were already available looked very tasty. This customer service is what sets Urban Curry apart from other Indian restaurants. The food was very good but not sure I would give it a full star rating based on price unless the customer service was as great as it is. So 4.5 it is!\n\nThe Dal soup had a satisfying spice to add some kick to the lentils in it. I had two servings of this soup! I think the other Vegan option was an okra something. It was good and again, very spicy. Sensing a theme here? Yep, all of their dishes are fairly spicy, especially considering its their standard spice level. Even the papadums have a bit of a peppery bite to them. The only thing missing from the buffet is a selection of chutney. Too bad they don't have some squeeze bottles of this stuff available. \n\nThe Aloo Gobi is always a great Vegan option and the version here is no exception. It was actually spicier than I have had at most places without specifying \"spicy\". It's very good and I would order this as an entree if I ever make it here for dinner.\n\nThe interior makes me think this used to be an Italian or Pizza place. It's fairly large inside and next door to some of the most friendly businesses in town. I could see this as a great dinner spot before catching some of the outstanding entertainment that is available nearby...\n\nPro Tip: Don't forget 15% off for your Yelp check-in!", "author": "John B."}

Delivery estimate was 45 minutes to an hour, it was definitely on the hour plus side when the food arrived. But, the guy who delivered our food was very polite and came up to our floor rather than waiting for us in the lobby which was a bonus. \n\nI ordered the chicken gobhi, mild. It was definitely more medium than mild, although I am notoriously a wimp about that. The chicken was all dark meat which was slightly disappointing. The naan was good and arrived nice and fluffy still! + 1 for that\n\nMy coworkers ordered the mushroom masala and the chicken vindaloo. Everyone agreed the food was pretty good. We will most likely order from here again.", "author": "Rachel E."}

But then I tasted the nan and kheer (best kheer ever!! It's creamy and flavorful- mindblowing), and I couldn't care less if I had been made to wait even an hour! It was that good! (I waited about 20-25 min for the chicken tikka masala, and the place was empty.) \n\nMaybe they make everything from scratch- I wouldn't be surprised! \n\nI honestly wouldn't even care if I got food poisoning, the flavor is so good I would give them 5 stars and come back the next day.

These deals like this are sweet!\n\nLooking in the menu I usually get lamb, I am a fan of Lamb and with curry sauce it's a win!  So I ordered the Tikka Masala Lamb, and Butter Chicken which was not on the menu because it was a daily special and a garlic naan.  I also asked the waiter if they had the black milk tea with sugar called \"chai\".\n\nThe \"Chai\" is black tea with milk with some kind of spicy to it.  It tastes similar to milk tea and I usually ask for it at an Indian cuisine.\n\nAll the food came out at once, which is good, but one of the curries was hotter than the other which kind of suck.  The Naan was delicious and soft and not burnt.  The Tikka Masla Lamb was delicious.  Creamy and the lamb were boneless.  I like more of the bone on stuff on the meat than this. The curry lacked any spicy because my friend couldn't eat spicy so it was pretty neutral.  The Butter chicken was alright, the sauce was creamy and a bit too sweet for my taste and some of the dark meat chicken taste like rubber, as if it was cooking for too long.\n\nOverall, it's alright I have taste better and I wasn't completely satisfied with the food.  It lack some flavors and the lamb and chicken dint' have much flavor in to it.  If it wasn't for the online deal, I doubt I would ever even go to this place.

You can't go wrong with the sizzling plates.  The garlic naan was nice and fluffy, not obnoxiously garlic-y (new word alert). The spice level of their dishes is spot on.  The server asked us how spicy we wanted our meal and we replied, \"very spicy, not burn your face off spicy, but very spicy.\"  He knew exactly what we meant and delivered our meals just the way we asked. \n\nThe friendly servers and staff were always around, smiling, giving suggestions.  They even have a water ninja who took it upon herself to never let my water glass go more than half empty.\n\nFood-wise, I would suggest the Karahi.  The Aloo Palak was very good too.

It has a giant dining area, and we sat in the very back at a large eight-person table. We ordered an assortment of vegetarian dishes. My favorite was actually the vegetable biryani. Unfortunately, I really didn't love any of the curries. They all seemed excessively creamy, especially the mushroom curry, and I didn't like the strong dairy flavors. They were all a milky orange or yellow color. I likened the mushroom one to alfredo, and another person in our dining party thought the paneer tikka masala tasted like Spaghetti-O's (he said \"not in a bad way,\" but just stating a fact). The one curry that was not super creamy was the fish curry, but it was extremely salty. For six entrees plus some naan and rice, the total plus tax and tip came out to be ~$17 per person. Signs around the restaurant stated that an 18% gratuity would be automatically added for parties of six or more, but it turns out that they didn't add it for us.

The only problems were the goat in both the curry and the biryani- it was slightly undercooked, so it was not really tender, really hard to chew and cut. The fish was also pretty bland. Do keep in mind that everything is served a la carte, so rice and naan need to be ordered on the side. The service was great and the waiters were accommodating, and there was no wait.

Definitely the best Indian food that I've tried so far!\n\nThe first thing worth noting about Urban Curry is the customer service. They have recently switched over to self-serve. The only downside of this is that you don't have as much interaction with the wait staff (they're delightful!), but you can tell that they genuinely care about their customers and their overall dining experience.\n\nMy favorite items on the menu are the chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, tandoori fish, and baingan bharta (eggplant curry). The tikka masala has a cream base, but it is balanced by spicy tomato curry filled with flavor. The hot chai tea is also great. just a little bit of spice and sweetness to an otherwise creamy tea.  \n\nIt's always an amazing experience dining it, but it's also my go-to restaurant for rainy day take-out!", "author": "Kimi S."}

When I gave it to the man checking me out he got very upset, but in the end took it anyway.  \n\nThe samosas were flavorless.  The dough was crispy which is what you always want in a samosa but it was extremely oily, dripping through the bag, and tasted very bland.  The chicken makhani I made sure to order extra hot as I love spice, but I wouldn't say it came out any higher than medium.  There were bits of chicken that were brownish black and mushy, and I ended up throwing out about a third of my bites.  When I'm eating Indian food, I don't want to have to pick through every bite.  The naan was fine, but I think it's rather hard to mess up naan.\n\nFurthermore it was a Friday night in a very populated area (Chinatown) and there was nobody in the restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-11-03", "description": "Pros: Extremely helpful staff, very tasty food\nCon: a little overpriced, especially the lunch menu\n \nThis place is right near my office, but the prices have always scared me away--lunch is supposed to be my cheap meal. I mean, Urban Curry isn't  expensive, but I their dishes are about two dollars above my favorite Indian place in the Mission and five dollars above my beloved taco truck right around the corner from work. So, I usually do tacos for lunch and then save Indian for dinner. Today, however, it was cold and I wanted the slow burn of complex spices to keep me going through the afternoon. \n\nNow, I can't eat milk products because they give me raging migraines, and I've learned through painful experiences that Indian places, in particular, don't really understand me when I say that I can have meat but not if it was cooked or marinated in yogurt, and I can have foods cooked with oil but not with ghee. At the very least, it usually turns into a huge negotiation session that I just didn't feel like experiencing, today. So, I just picked a veggie dish (the aloo gobi) and asked if it was vegan. Indian restaurants understand \"vegan\" very well. \n\nAs it turned out, it was vegan, but I came to wish I'd actually explained my food predicament in whole, because the guy was SUPER helpful. He told me every on the menu that was vegan \"for next time.\" He even said that if I called a day ahead, he would make sure that there were a bunch of good vegan options in the lunch buffet for me. I have a feeling he could have handled the complexity of my situation, which I'll now need to explain next time I go back.\n\nSince it was my first time there, the rice was on the house, and he also offered me some rose water while I was waiting, also on the house. With all that, my order ended up being cheaper than anticipated, so I was very pleased.\n\nThe rice was very flavorful and delicious on its own an perfectly cooked. The aloo gobi was nicely salted, if maybe a littler spicier than I'd wanted. That's my fault, though. I asked for medium, which is usually my preference, but I should have done mild my first time at a new place. I suggest knocking down your spice level request about a half a notch lower than usual your first time here. \n\nThe best thing about my lunch is that the aloo gobi had a lot of cauliflower, and some nice chunks of it, too. My main complaint about this dish is that most places make it too heavy on the potatoes or liquify the cauliflower by overcooking it. The cauliflower was tender and flavorful, but still had a lot of intact florets. \n\nThe rosewater was the worst part of the meal. I think I'd expected a clear, lightly sugared water that tasted like rose petals had been sitting in it. That wasn't even close to what I received; instead imagine if roses were a red Koolaid. I had to water it down by half to even drink it, and it was still dark red. I'm not knocking down the restaurant's stars for it because it was free. \n\nEven thought the food was good and the service was excellent, it still wasn't totally worth the price I'll have to pay for it next time. I mean, come on, it's cauliflower, potatoes, and rice--easily three of the cheapest foods on the planet! I know spices aren't cheap, but Udupi manages to charge less and still turn a profit. I knock it a ful star for that. I don't mind expensive meals, but only when the price is justifiable.", "author": "Aja S."}

I ate a late lunch/early dinner here with my best friend and boyfriend. We got here around 3:40ish pm and the place was empty! I'm guessing the lunch buffet rush hour was over and it was \"limbo\" time (between lunch in dinner). \n\nWe ordered: \n-Plain naan for two\n-Rice \n-Chicken Tikka Marsala\n-Chicken Curry\n-Chicken Boti\ntotal price: $33.56 for three people\n(yup... a lot of chicken)\n\nThe plain naan was warm and fluffy and complimented the sauces of the Chicken Tikka Marsala and Chicken Curry. My favorite dish was the Chicken Curry. It had the perfect balance of being spicy and not overly spicy. The dish also came with big chunks of boneless chicken. The Chicken Tikka Marsala had a nice creamy sauce, pretty good. The Chicken Boti was a big disappointment for me... granted this was my first time eating Indian food, but the chicken tasted dry. Needless to say, it was the last dish we finished at our table. \n\nTaste buds aside, I loved how the restaurant gave us complimentary tea (my friend said the Indian restaurant she usually goes to also comes with complimentary tea, so I don't know if all Indian restaurants do that... but it sure was tasty). The tea came in cute cups with stirrers for adding sugar. I liked we were able to add our own of sugar because everyone has different preferences. The waitress was very tentative to our needs (giving us enough time to figure out our orders without rushing us, she always refilled our water, and asked if everything was good). The decor of the restaurant was really nice too, I especially liked the lanterns and likes that hung from the ceiling. \n\nHowever, the food took FOREVER to arrive when we were the only ones dining in the restaurant at that time! We had to wait an extra five-ten minutes for the Chicken Boti to arrive, therefore the rest of our dishes became slightly cold as we waited.\n\nWhen it came time for the bill we gave the yelp deal coupon ($20 dollars worth of food for $10) and paid the difference in cash + tip. The waitress frowned and told us we should have given her the coupon earlier, which I don't fault her for getting slightly annoyed since she does have to \"recalculate\" the bill (i.e. subtract $20 dollars from it). But, she took forever to do so.. don't understand why? \n\nI gave this place 3.5 stars because the food was cheap/worth it, filling, good service from the waitress, clean restaurant, and great ambiance. But, the food took too long (-0.5), everything didn't come out at once (-0.5), and the dry chicken from the Chicken Boti (-0.5).", "author": "Shirley C."}

I find it to be completely off-base.  \n\nWe ordered for delivery at lunch time on a Sunday.  Delivery took about an hour, but was to be expected considering it was gay pride Sunday.  I appreciated the fact that the driver called to let us know that he would be late and why.  Sadly this phone call is the only reason I'm giving this place more than 1 star (which I still think to be quite generous).\n\nChicken Tikka Masala - Upon opening the container, the BF's first words were \"looks like nacho cheese\".... and it smelled vaguely Italian (like vodka sauce minus the basil).  He actually had to add water to it to cut the creaminess.  The dish was ordered medium-spicy and there was not a hint of spice whatsoever.\n\nPaneer Tikka Masala - Same overly-creamy sauce... except with chunks of cheese in it... incredibly over-rich and with no complexity of flavor --- just tomato and milk.\n\nSamosas - The samosa itself was passable, but the chutneys were pretty gross...  I found myself eating them anyway to get away from the creambomb Tikka Masala.  \n\nGarlic Naan - Pretty delicious, actually... one of the best I've had in SF, but sadly the only bright spot in this meal.\n\nRice - Overcooked/old... puffy/crumbly texture.  Considering it was 1pm, I'm not sure how this is even possible... was it left in the cooker from last night's midnight buffet?\n\nI felt sick to my stomach the rest of the day and actually contemplated making myself throw it back up to get some relief.\n\nDo yourself a favor and order from Little Delhi.", "author": "Kevin F."}

So bored I somewhat startled her out of her day dream. There was only one other party here. There were about three Mexican looking cooks in the front kitchen and some more people in the back. I think they were preparing for dinner.\n\nThe interior kitsch and themey. They try to make it feel like you're in a foreign land especially with the mural. It comes off Disney land-ish, just bordering on tacky. The background music feels like the music pulled straight from an Olympic Games broadcast.\n\nMy waitress took awhile to get my order. I couldn't see why since I was the only customer here. I did however get plenty of refills and free chai which she called \"Indian Tea\" (wtf, just call it chai). After I was served a couple came in. I'm not sure if they're friends with the waitress but they talked in a foreign language for 15-20 minutes in a manner similar to when a friend finds out another friend has cancer.\n\nI had the lamb gobi gosht with naan. It was alright. The food does come out piping hot and the portions are decent. The naan is disappointing. It's more like naan pizza bread in the shape of a thick saltine cracker. What it really reminds me of is Pillsbury croissant dough flattened down into flat triangles. I'm not really sure if this is is not authentic or just a different version of naan.

For late dinner time people like us, you can't beat Urban Curry's consistent friendly service right up until 2 am-- none of this, it's close to 11, we're going to close, maybe you can order kind of stuff. They even have a buffet until 2 am, although we always order from the menu.\n\nThe second thing that makes Urban Curry stand out is the open layout, with (most?) of the cooking happening in full view so you know nothing weird is happening to your food. It doesn't feel crowded, dirty, or like they're hiding anything, which is just the way a restaurant should be. I will say the vibe is a little different, it's kind of dark in a romantic way and the chairs are huge, which makes me feel like they were made for a royal banquet table (not necessarily in a good way).\n\nService and food both high-quality and very consistent (that's the key!). Good naan, good food, one of the only places we order appetizers, it's all so good we can't stop ourselves.\n\nAnd, the bonus of being stuck in the middle of the North Beach strip clubs is that they never judge you here-- I've gone in dressed up or not and the service has been perfect both times.\n\nWe always find free street parking, maybe we're just lucky.", "author": "Ashley L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-03-26", "description": "I so wanted to like this place!  There is a serious lack of good Indian food in this city, especially places that offer good, dependable delivery, so when this place opened nearby and seemed to be run by hip, savvy people, it seemed like a good bet. The reviews on Yelp were mixed but the overall rating was high, so we gave it a chance.\n\nThe experience started out well with a nicely designed website which made ordering easy. At payment time, it allowed you to include the tip with the total -- a nice time-saver, I thought.  The reason for this, I learned later, was that the company hosting the website collects the money there and then, so they can't adjust via credit card when they deliver the food (so if you want to use that 10% coupon someone handed you on the street, call in your order). Delivery was estimated at 45-60 minutes and it arrived in about 50.  \n\nThe meal started off well with some very nice Dal. It needed salt, but that was easily remedied.\n\nBut when we got to the main dishes, we found that they were almost completely lacking in salt, spice and spiciness.  The heat for every dish, which had been ordered either Medium or Hot, was closer to Mild. The main dishes were also swimming in grease. In addition to those flaws, the Aloo Gobhi was overly dependent on tomato for its flavor, the Bainghan Bartha was oddly creamy and soupy, and the Naan had the flavor and consistency of Wonder Bread. The Roghan Josh and Prawn Jalfrazi were both OK and saved the meal from being completely inedible.   Overall, it tasted like what Indian food might be like if made by a school cafeteria.\n\nIf you want Indian food for delivery, try Tandoori Mahal. It isn't perfect and can be inconsistent, but even on a bad night, it's FAR better than this. And on occasion, its Baigan Bartha can be outstanding.  Just allow plenty of time for delivery.\n\nEDIT 3/23/2012:  DO NOT ORDER FROM TANDOORI MAHAL. The food will be late and it will be COLD.

Actually, my accomplice would likely argue that I was craving everything I walked by... scones from Italian bakeries, pizza that smelled so lovely I forgot I was in San Francisco, a confectionery store giving out free fudge samples... suffice to say, I was starving, and this fact alone resulted in me ordering what I like to call Indian for White People: Chicken Tikka Masala (CTM). Well, my hunger was only 50% to blame. After the Brain Masala fiasco last time I felt I deserved something normal. But I digress. \n\nThe meal started out strong. Too strong now that I think about it. Complimentary chai (which I didn't hate!) and a wonderful cucumber salad. But I'm not going to let Urban Curry ride on the coattails of some tea and diced cucumbers. \n\nThe CTM, and it pains me to say this, was heartbreakingly bad. Way too overboard in the yogurt department. As in, I imagined myself sitting down with a tiny plastic cup of CTM flavored Yoplait. Really the biggest problem here is that I happen to vehemently loathe yogurt and generally need to be tricked into eating it (as is the case with normal CTM). But it is what it is. \n\nAs someone who has been to just about every Indian place in the East Bay, I was pretty disappointed with my first time in the city. I even felt a little sick shortly afterward.", "author": "Chrissy S."}

First issue, our waitress acted like one pissed off, put out woman.  But not to the patrons seated about 2 feet away from us, she apparently loved them.  She came back to their table multiple times, and would deliberately walk away without even turning around to address us.  Issue #2, we ordered chicken tikka kebab, chole palak and the naan stuffed with potato.  So they bring out the kebab, which is burned and flavorless.  Then they disappear.  Literally disappear. After about 10 minutes, our first dish is cold, and the remainder of our dinner has yet to show up.  Umm, there's clearly a problem here, no one seems to care or notice we're waiting for the rest of our dinner.  We ask where's the rest and btw, our kebab is now cold? They say it's coming, no reason given why the delay.  Well no thanks, we don't want cold kebab and we kind of wanted to eat everything all at once.  They take back the kebab, we wait again, they eventually bring out the palak and naan, the palak has zero spice (we ordered it hot), and both are bland.  This time, no kebab comes, they tell us they're making another batch.  Eventually that shows up more burned and dry than the first batch (pretty sure it was the first batch re-heated).  And all the while, Miss Pissed Off is still apparently pissed at us because she's been MIA the whole time.  But not to the chosen patrons to the left, she's visited them multiple times.  So we stayed and ate because we were pretty much obligated to at that point.  They offered an insincere \"sorry\" and gave us 10% off.  Wow!  Thanks for that!  Run. Far. Away.

Food, beverages and a heft tip came out to about $60.\n\nWe had the chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, lamb biriyani, and naan.  All three were super tasty and the servings were generous.  The only thing is that it could have been a little spicier.  We asked for medium, but I guess they took the safe road.  That's fine though.  Better to be not spicy enough than too spicy. \n\nThe location might be a little off-putting for a lot of people.  It's right in the middle of all the strip clubs on Broadway.

When my boyfriend gets the food the delivery person one asked him for more money, why would he ask him for more money if I laid with my card and it gave me the total of the amount before I proceeded to checkout! Seemed a little sketchy to me! With that he also asked my boyfriend if he can leave him something! I work in an industry were tipping helps a lot but tipping is for the kindness of people's hearts it's never required!! However I left tip on my card when checking out!!!! So not only is this super sketchy delivery person asking for more money which was already processed with tip he was prob trying to make extra cash and pocket the money saying that they didn't charge me but he also asked for another tip saying he didn't receive one which is BS cuz it added to my total!!

He said they have been open only two months and they have 4 other locations. \"The same name?\" I asked.\n\n\"No\" he said. \"The others are all called House of Curries.\"\n\nMy heart sank at that statement. I'd only ever been to the UC Berkeley House of Curries and I knew from experience not to order meat because it was always overdone and that things were better than naan and curry, but not fantastic.\n\nFor a chicken vindaloo and naan it was $9.50. I walked back to the office and tentatively took my first bite. The chicken was juicy and perfectly cooked. The vindaloo was slightly sweet, slightly tangy and very spicy. Best of all, it was not overly greasy and had just the right chicken to potato to sauce ratio. Oh, and the naan was spongy and moist. \n\nIt made me realize how much worst the same ownership can make a restaurant when they're in a college town and know they can get away with it.

The cubes of paneer were clearly evident, but hardly any sign of peas.\n2. Vegetable Curry - 90% cauliflower, 5% carrots, 2% peas, 3% chili oil and not much else.  S.B. hates cauliflower, so he was particularly dismayed.  This dish was really oily.\n3. Basmati Rice - not much to say about this.\n4. Plain Naan - this was the only saving grace of the whole meal, it was fresh, hot and drizzled with ghee which made it smell and taste deliciously like butter.\n5. Raita - unnecessarily runny.\n\nWe only ate about 30% of the curries we ordered, and 100% of each the naan, rice and raita.  It was that bad.\n\nThe plates were dirty when they dropped them off pre-meal, post-meal, the waiter asked us for help stacking plates when he was clearing the table.\n\nWhole fiasco cost us $24.00 (tax and tip included).

I liked that the palak paneer was rich and not too saucy or watered down like in some places. Kahashi was really surprising in flavor and good, the fish was first fried which wasn't desired but wasn't bad. The lentils dish was good, hearty. \n\nEvery dish had a different flavor and texture. Every dish was cleaned to the last drop. \n\nService was excellent. We had a baby at our table, which gave us an advantage since the waitstaff loved coming by to see her. She asked if the dishes were too spicy and we said yes for the folks who thought so, and she came by with a batch of yogurt sauce to cool the fire (good sauce).

I think UC is more of a late night drunk food place. We ordered the eggplant, mushroom masala and chicken tikka masala. They were nice and threw in naan on the house. The naan was good, but it was a bit salty. The rice was good.  The chicken tikka masala was good, but I think roti's and amber's chicken tikka tasted better.  The mushroom masala was a stellar 5 stars.  The eggplant dish was all mush without any real pieces of eggplant.

We're looking at things within half a mile on Yelp, and came across Urban Curry being rated at 4.5 stars after ~55 reviews.  [While, in most cities, 55 reviews generally suggests the reviews have gone be on the point of the employees and their friends trying to build up the restaurant, in a city like San Francisco were many restaurants have 1000 reviews, it's hard to say.]\n\nWe were NOT disappointed. Now that's not to say we weren't worried when I first got there... is right next to the Garden of Eden strip club.  But when we entered, we are greeted with a very well apportioned space, nice decor, and lots of space. In San Francisco, you don't find a lot of restaurants have space between the tables--especially in North Beach. This restaurant had a generous amount of space between the tables and our party of seven did not feel at all cramped.\n\nThe food: the prices are amazing! But hardly an item more expensive than seven or eight dollars.  The quality of the food is quite good... it's not nearly as savory as Lahore Karahi (which I consider the ultimate in Pakistani comfort food), but each and every dish was well-made and delicious. Even though the menu indicates that Chai tea is $1.99, they said it was complementary. I don't know if that was just because we have a large group or because they just put that on the menu that way so vagrants don't come in and start drinking it-- but bravo--way to keep up with Naan 'n Curry, with a bit classier atmosphere and better service (i..e, service).  \n\nWe also noticed that they had some goat items on the menu.  We were not feeling adventuresome enough to try it, but maybe next time there will be some goat tried. We stuck with vegetable curry, chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, eggplant, and saag paneer.  At several dishes of rice and naan, and we had dinner for seven people per under $50.

This place was no different, so I'll just say that the food was average.\n\nThe thing I'd like to warn about is that even though the entrees seem reasonably priced, your out-the-door cost will be higher than you'd think Indian food should cost. This is because this place actually charges you for both naan and rice, things I usually have with my CTM. When all was said and done, this place cost me a pretty penny while the food was just average.\n\nWe forgot to mention the Yelp ad, so we didn't get the slight discount.

Prices were decent for lunch, but they could probably include naan or rice with the dish for lunch specials (even smaller portions would be acceptable). \n\nService was very pleasant and the environment was welcoming, although I think they could do without the white table cloths and let the food do the upscaling (Maybe a reason they are not as busy as they should be for lunch).\n\nThe food was as good of indian cuisine as ive had in the city, with teh exception of Lahore Karahe or Shalimar.  Urban Curry's advantage over those places are that you can leave without reaking of indian food the rest of the day.  I had the Goat Karashi, which was absolutely perfect!  Spicy but actually with an aromatic spice flavor, rather than just heat.  The Garlci Naan was excellent as was the Eggplant and Mixed Veggie dishes I tried.  \n\nUrban Curry will definitely be seeing much more of my business and as that of as many people as I can bring there in the near future.  Well done Urban Curry!\n\nP.S.  If you are the owner and are reading this, I highly recommend having someone stand outside with some small samples to snag the high volume of lunch-goers heading down Broadway...you wont be disappointed.

As usual, we consulted Yelp to find the best-rated Indian joint in the North Beach area.  As we made the walk to Urban Curry, the first thing we noticed was that the joint really is sandwiched in the strip club district.  That made the quality of the place suspect--how good can Stripper Curry be?   \n\nThe decor of Urban Curry is a bit on the bland side--they could use some sprucing up, especially given the neon lights blasting on Broadway just outside its front doors.  The restaurant is quite large--offering spacious seating for parties big and small.  The host of this joint is what upped my rating from a 3 to a 4.  He was very friendly, but not in a fake way.\n\nWe enjoyed a few staple Indian items, including the Garlic Naan and Lamb Vindaloo.  The Vindaloo itself was quite spicy, causing me to inhale copious amounts of water and air in attempts to soothe my burning tongue.  In other words, that Vindaloo was awesome!  We also ordered an eggplant dish--we weren't too excited about that dish, but it was probably more a matter of taste than the dish being poorly prepared.\n\nLIke I said, foodwise, this joint gets 3 stars.  But given the incredibly friendly service, I had to tack on another star.  If you're yearning for some Indian food, and you're in North Beach, Urban Curry is a great place to go (not to mention the prices are incredibly reasonable)!", "author": "Alexis N."}

I pass by this place every single day around 6:15pm, riding home from work on my bicycle, and it is always empty. When I've stopped in for dinner, staying til about 7:30, it stayed pretty empty the whole time. Two or three parties came in the entire time. \nMaybe they are popular for lunch? I hope so! What a waste if all the people working in the Financial District couldn't see past the throng of good eats on Kearney to make it out to Broadway. Ok, so it is a little far for a great portion of the FD, but for those of you working closer to Broadway, here is a good change of pace from your Chinese eateries and Vietnamese sandwiches. \n\nThe mango lassi is very tasty here and it's pretty large too, which I appreciated. The curries are good, and I must say, I appreciate that they don't drown the curry in oil like other places. Though it is delicious (I have Shalimar in mind, and yes, I love them), sometimes you want to eat some good Indian curry without thinking you might keel over from clogged arteries. The oil deficit makes it just a tad less tasty than Shalimar, but believe me, you'll feel so much better in the hours after your meal. I'm a fan of the Aloo Palak (spinach and potatoes). All curries are $7-8.\n\nThe naan comes out pre-cut into 4 pieces. This is me being very picky, but I like it when one big naan comes out, all fluffy and ready to be torn apart by my hands. \n\nThis place has a very clean feeling (it is relatively new), and the painted walls and other decor all makes it pretty nice-- without the nice restaurant prices. \n\nThe guys here seem bored without customers.

My friends and I went for the $13 lunch buffet as oppose to ordering by dish. We were quickly seated in the many tables by the waitress as we entered. Like any other buffet, you get yourself up from the table and grab a plate to feast. I tried the noodles and curry chicken first. The noodles were fantastic. It was well seasoned and nothing to overwhelming in taste. The curry was delicious, but the chicken that came with the curry felt kind of dry and tasteless. It makes me think that the pieces of chicken were not cooked long enough with the curry. The cooked lettuce was just ok. The red-ish colored chicken drumsticks were good though. There's also fruits, veggies, milk tea, and probably more than I haven't mentioned. Other than that, I felt like the selection was very limited for a buffet. The service was great. The complimentary garlic naans that came with the meal were also enjoyable. One of my friends went crazy on those. The waitress was very attentive to the diners. Plates were being taken away whenever we were gone to hunt for more food. Our glass were always filled with water.

A six-month long treasure hunt nearly went fruitless until I stumbled across this place walking home from work last year.  \n\nA number of things can destroy the experience at an Indian food restaurant, but Urban Curry avoids those pitfalls.

My Indian routine typically rotates chicken tikka masala and lamb vindaloo, but this is a place that I know I can try something new without reservation.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-07", "description": "My sister & I were in Chinatown and we got a hankering for Indian food. I looked up nearby restaurants on Yelp and noticed that this place had great reviews, so we decided to check it out. We're so glad we did!\n\nWe were part of the really early dinner crowd (we got there around 5:30 and were the only patrons for a while) but it is such a beautiful building that we didn't mind at all. I've broken down my review into 4 categories below.\n\n1) Food: This was honestly the best Indian meal I have eaten in a few years. The vegetable pakoras were just right with good yoghurt sauces on the side. The masala sauce in my chicken dish was creamy with just the right combination of spices, and the chicken was tender. My sister had the chicken vindaloo, which was spicy enough to give off a great taste (and give her the sniffles) without overpowering the dish. The naan and roti were ample and warm -a perfect compliment to our meals. Finally, the rice pudding was awesome! Not to sweet or smooth (horrible mistakes when it comes to rice pudding) it was a refreshing way to cleanse our palates at the end of the meal.\n\n2) Service: The service here is first rate! Granted we were alone in the restaurant for part of the meal, but our waitress was really on top of the ball. She didn't hover (I hate helicopter servers), but she did make sure to eyeball us every few minutes to make sure we had everything we needed. I don't think I ever saw my water glass go down past the halfway mark. The owner also came out at the end of our meal to introduce himself and ask after our dining experience.\n\n3) Price: I really think this place should be categorized as a $ place as rather than a $$ place. My sister and I had a Chai tea, an appetizer, 2 chicken entrees, 2 bread dishes, 1 side of rice, and 2 rice puddings for under $25 with tax. This was dinner, not lunch! The portions were really huge- 3 people could definitely have eating this meal and left the table full. Plus the Chai tea and the rice puddings were on the house! \n\n4) Miscellaneous: They have an open kitchen, which I LOVE. You can see people cooking your dishes from pretty much anywhere on the floor. The restrooms were also very clean, and the whole restaurant was casually elegant.\n\nGo to Urban Curry- you won't regret it! I will definitely be back with friends!", "author": "moni b."}

What took away from the star rating was that it took 1.5 hours to get the food. The fact that the delivery guy was apologetic and refused to take the tip (which I insisted he did anyways) made up for that more or less.\n\nNow on to the food. Hubby and I ordered garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, samosa, basmati rice, baingham bartha, and  lamb vindaloo. OMFG!!! It smells awesome!!! You can smell every spice in there. The chicken and lamb were ordered \"hot\", and yeah, my stomach will hate me for it.

Our dishes were the vegetable biryani (I'm still waiting on the vegetables.. but plenty of rice) and the chicken karahi. Both dishes were over the top spicy, almost inedible. The naan was very bland and had almost none of the characteristic oven flavor you expect from naan.

I work near there and walked by it the month before they opened with anticipation and questions like:\n- What will their Tika M. be like and will it like me?\n- Do they take credit cards with questionable credit?\n- Is it gonna be high-end or a dive with rat traps\n- Do they give locals discounts to local worker bees (other than the strippers two doors down)?\nSo my fellow yelpers I have nothing but good things to say. The Tika was all I dreamed of and more. The sauce was perfecto. Creamy and not to spicy. The chicken was tender and not dry like some places (ie naan and currry) and the prices reasonable. The place is a definite step up from the before mentioned dive but not too classy where you think a collared shirt is in order. The guys that work there are super interested in dialing it all in and asked me multiple times how it was. At the end the main guy came and sat down and basically said make yourself at home. We also chatted about the meal, the naan and life in general. At the end of it all I felt almost like bearing my sole and telling him about my secret addiction to Tika masala and how I had to go through a 12 step program back in the 80's... but then i thought i should end this rant and just say GO!

All were delicious with a few minor suggestions. The samosas were a bit dry (potato AND rice filling) and so was the chicken in the tikka masala. I'm not a fan of white meat in such dishes as dark meat is juicier. The garlic naan was the truth. This is the way it should always be. The kids liked it too.

There's no better choice than going to an Indian restaurant. I found Urban Curry from Yelp, where I go if I want to try something different. Going down the list I could see mostly 4-5 stars and hey, how could you go wrong? So Urban Curry it is.\n\nWe were standing at the door at 5PM, waiting for it to open. Walked in, impressed right away. It's clean, very clean. I work in a clinic. Cleanliness and hygiene is my main thing. Since we were the only patrons there, we got all the attention. The staff was warm and courteous. Right off the bat, complimentary Chai tea. Nice. Very nice. \n\nKaren had the eggplant. She couldn't stop praising the taste.\n\nI ordered: \nFish Pakora for appetizer. The batter was just right, not doughy at all and the fish was fresh and tender.\n\nLamb Karahi. Now this one was an adventure. Why? Because I was so ecstatic about the place and food, I totally forgot to ask them to make it mild. When the dish came, I looked at it, and the waiter, thinking \"I'm fried!\" He told me to try and see if it's too spicy. I did. It was tasty, and painfully HOT! I told him I would work around it. During the entire dinner, he was so concerned that he came over a few times to make sure I was OK. I was NOT OK, but to tell you, NO REGRETS! I was drowning the meat in yogurt to neutralize the spice. I wanted to eat it. It was so damn good.\n\nThe Naan was to die for. It was fluffy on top, and crispy at the bottom. I brought some naan home but totally forgot about it for a few days. Pulled it from the fridge, stuck it in the toaster oven and it was just as good as new.\n\nI had tears running the entire time but it's all worth it. I'm definitely coming back and bringing my friends too. The food is delicious and the price is right, and not forgetting the 15% off if you mention Yelp.

So far, I've tried and can recommend the following:\n\n- Chicken Tikka-Masala\n- Lamb Karahi\n- Lamb Boti\n- Garlic Naan\n\nIf you can't tolerate spice in your food, it's best to make that known.  On some dishes, you'll be asked to specify the level of spiciness.  With Indian owners and Mexican line chefs, \"medium\" is pretty spicy.\n\nLast time I was in, they offered a 15% discount if you mentioned Yelp.  I don't know if this discount is still available.  However, even undiscounted, the food is very reasonable.\n\nThe only reason that this place doesn't get 5 stars is the location.  The place is located in the heart of the Broadway/Kearny/Columbus triangle, so if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, you'll have to wade through all the bridge-and-tunnel riff-raff that invariably collects there.

Went around 4pm on Saturday and it was empty, although another couple came in as we were leaving--- we didn't really eat lunch, so came here for an early dinner. Service was fantastic, constantly refilling our water glasses, offering us complimentary chai (delicious, although the best in SF is probably Kasa's), and bringing our food out very quickly, so it was hot, fresh, and delicious! We split the veggie samosas which were so hot they melted in our mouths, filled with well-spiced potatoes and peas, and garnished with fresh mint. These were served with very tasty mint and tamarind sauces on the side. This was followed with  an order of whole wheat roti (well-cooked, but still pliable and hot and fresh), and an order of Navrattan Korma (an orange curry with paneer, carrots, and other veggies) and Aloo palak (spinach with potatoes). Both were delicious, and seemed very fresh (including the spinach, which did not seem to just be reheated frozen stuff). The Navrattan was definitely the winner, but both were great. Overall, the bill was $25 exactly (including tax), but we had a 50% off Scoutmob coupon so it was only $12.50! Of course, we tipped on the pre-coupon amount because they definitely deserved it, and if we are ever in the North Beach neighborhood again (is this right? I'm in the Mission so I'm not so well-versed in the other neighborhood boundaries in the NE side of SF), we will definitely stop by before heading to City Lights to browse their books.", "author": "Amanda S."}

They told us to be seated at a table while we waited and sincerely offered to bring us waters.  The man who took our order was very specific when inquiring about our tolerances for heat and the cooks delivered a level that was perfect for us.\nI'll admit that to me the Tikka tasted a bit like a sweet tomato soup, but my husband was over the moon with it and it's his regular dish.  i was thrilled with my Lamb dish, and it only tasted better when i revisited my left overs two days later.  The flavors had continued to develop while it sat in my fridge.\nMy whole wheat roti was perfect, perfect.  it was freshly made and had bubbly, crispy parts in it.  My man likes the Paratha, which i find a bit oily but he LOVED it.\nMostly, we're really excited to have good indian food in the neighborhood.  They don't deliver yet, but they're right on Broadway near Columbus and it couldn't be easier to get to.\nWe're looking forward to making Urban Curry a regular part of our take out routine.", "author": "passion f."}

Urban Curry is the real deal!\nThe host/owner guy when you first walk in was super friendly.The place has a nice feel to it, with several hookahs laying around for decoration. \nWe ordered the Tandoori Chicken which was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of lemon taste. The Lamb Kabob which look like breakfast sausage come with grilled onions and bell peppers, it taste like heaven. You get four pieces of heaven by the way. \nWe also ordered Paneer Tikka Masala, it's a homemade cheese with creamy sauce which is perfect for dipping with your Naan, we ordered the regular one and it was fresh, soft and hot. The prices were great and well worth the portions. \nThe only drawback is that's it's located on Broadway and Columbus where parking is a pain, so bring lots of coins for street parking (25 cents=8 minutes) or park in the lot down the street ($3 every 30 minutes) but the lot gets full.\nEnjoy!", "author": "El N."}

So finally I decided to just walk up that way for lunch and try it out. The food was solid, not the best I've had (I used to go to the Amber buffet down in MV), but I wasn't expecting amazing. It was good food though. Everything looked fresh and in the end I just love rice and lamb curry with naan so while I tried everything, the chicken in the various dishes seemed a bit dry to me so I just went back for more curry. I would give it 3.5 stars for food, but what boosts it up is the great service. I wasn't expecting any service for a buffet, maybe someone to tell me to sit wherever I wanted, but not much more. When I walked in, I was greeted, asked if I had been here before and when I said no, he gave me a full tour of the buffet describing each dish. He came by to check on me, clear my plate, etc. Overall, a great experience. Obviously the more you eat for the $11.99 the better the value, but I felt my 2 modest plates of food were worth it. Note, the food is mostly spicy, which they tell you. Everything but the chicken tikka masala. I like my food spicy and had no issue with it, it wasn't too much, but may be for some.", "author": "Lauren M."}

The man who ushered us in was very friendly in suggesting dishes, even quizzed us about indian cuisine (in a friendly way) I would absolutely recommend Urban Curry to everyone..", "author": "Silly E."}

No offense to the people of Pakistan, but I think Indians make it better.  It did have a little kick to it, so I decided to go back and try something else: Chicken Karahi.  I REALLY liked it, and again I didn't even have to ask for them to make it spicy.  The restaurant itself is a nice and tastefully designed (so in a way it's out of place being so close to \"Garden of Eden\" et. al.), and the staff are very friendly.  I'll be back!", "author": "Ed F."}
