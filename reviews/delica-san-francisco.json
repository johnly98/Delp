I took one - so it had 3 small pieces of pork tonkatsu with sauce on top of it, soy sauce brined lotus root salad, black seaweed salad with natto, edamame and sushi rice with black sesame seeds. Then I also ordered a shrimp cake with a side of tartar sauce.\nThe food was really good, and ate the whole thing. I did enjoyed what I ate today late afternoon like around 5:27 PM. Then drank some peach ginger tea. It was satisfying and enjoyable dinner. \nThe shrimp cake is a shrimp with little Kewpie mayo, onions covered with panko bread crumbs and deep fried. This was excellent with their mildly flavored Japanese tartar sauce. So yummy!\nThis is still one of my go-to-places for quick Japanese deli foods- quite a unique menu still.", "author": "Jade M."}

I ended up in front of Delica and was intrigued by their menu -- it seems like an Asian fusion sort of cuisine. \n\nI grabbed a tiny smattering of sesame spinach and two chicken dumplings. Because I wasn't very hungry it okay... but if I was I would not have been very happy to find out that paying $11 only got me a tiny tiny portion. \n\nThe chicken dumplings were pretty good -- and at $2.50 a piece they should be. They're not traditional Asian dumplings -- they're more of a meatball. I personally didn't enjoy the sesame spinach salad and I also didn't think the price was justified -- I paid $5.60 for a few mouthfuls of spinach.

It is a Japanese themed Deli where you have your standard Bento's, Donburi, Salads & entrees. During lunch you can do a 3-item combo where you get a soup, salad & entree or 2 salads and an entree for $10.99. The menu board is not too clear so you will see a lot of first timers hanging around trying to figure out what to get, but once you get the drift the line moves pretty fast.  \n\nOver a period of time I've tried most of their soups, salads and entrees in different combinations. Surprisingly I've liked almost everything that I've got. The salads specially are unique. I haven't seen these in other Deli's. I thought the combinations are a little weird but they go well together. My favorites are the eggplant salad, Salmon chowder & the Kaki-age Tempura (which is vegetable and shrimp tempura). The salmon chowder is loaded with fish and is well worth the $1 up-charge.\n\nPrice is actually cheap when compared to other restaurants in the plaza especially when you factor in the high quality of the food.

I'll def return and try some of their other items on the menu, but I ordered from Caviar and they didn't carry everything. Warning though the portions are small for the price you're paying. I spent $20+ and only received a piece of tofu and a bento box.\n\nAgedashi Tofu Steak - This was my favorite. I've eaten this in a handful of restaurants in different countries and the tentsuyu sauce was very good. It was the right amount of sweet and savory. I ate this cold, which was fine, but I'm not sure if you are supposed to heat it up first. A little pricey at $5 a piece.\n\nAssorted 9-item Sushi Bento - I loved the arrangement of this and the presentation, but I wish I got to pick what went inside my bento box. It was a pre-set amount of things. I loved most of the things in there, but my favorite was the chicken dumpling and the hijiki & soybean. The flavors were great and pretty close to a bento box from the corner store in japan. I love burdock but I wasn't a fan of the way they mixed theirs. The celery in the mix threw the flavors off.  My least favorite was the Wasabi Garlic Potato Salad. I was expecting it to taste like the sweet potato salad that's available in most Japanese grocery stores, but the wasab was overpowering. \n\nThe bento also came with 4 pieces of sushi from a roll.The bento has one piece Salmon, Tuna, 16 grain, and Shrimp & Crab. Besides the raw piece of salmon and tuna on top of the roll, everything inside the roll was cooked. The roll also had pieces of raw red peppers. It threw off the taste completely.

All of them are yummy, sometimes during the lunch hour you may have to wait for them to drop a few into the oil but the wait is worth it. \n\nTheir chicken teriyaki dumpling = heaven and they reheat really well in the oven so get a bunch just ask for a little extra sauce to keep them juicy.  They have bento boxes for lunch as well and you can get a completely vegetarian one. They offer quite a few sushi rolls including an avo roll that is 100% vegan. \n\nOn a nice cool crisp SF day their unique MAMEstrone vegetarian soup really hits the spot, the broth is complex, lots of veggies and strange but good parmesan cheese (who'd have thought). \n\nIf you stop by here for lunch or simply to enjoy wandering around the building this place is worth a stop even if just for a croquette, dumpling and small salad.", "author": "Kelly T."}

I love the Japanese delicatessen concept with a menu of mouthwatering items from sushi, tempura, soups, bento boxes and more. Portions are on the smaller size, and prices are higher. During the middle of lunch rush you'll generally see a long line and a deli counter with Asian fusion menu options. Don't let the long line scare you, they have a well oiled operation that gets the line moving quickly.\n\nDelica uses quality ingredients, locally sourced and hormone free. I went with a group of friends, and we all ordered the salmon chowder. On a positive note the flavor and consistency were just right, not too heavy. The downer was the itty bitty speckles of salmon floating in the soup. There were definitely more carrots than anything and my salmon craving left unsatisfied. The alaskan crab croquette was amazing, but for $5+, I wish it was a more sizable portion. My friends ordered the potato croquette which was substantially larger than its crab counterpart. \n\nSeating is available in the public communal area with the bay view, adjacent to Delica and a few of the other businesses.

There is a loading area behind the building-that isn't marked out in any way, by where sinbad's used to be, kinda sorta by the Gandhi statue/outdoor dining section, and the never really available SF street parking. Like prettty much everything else in downtown SF you'll be best served by finding a way to come here that does not involve driving.\n\nThis is a unexpectedly large Japanese delicatessen with a world cuisine menu. You can order prepared, prepackaged items-dumplings croquettes sushi and bento to go, or order off the menu. Menu items can be to go or dine in, but there is no waiter service. They have the delicatessen style of ordering from counter and call out system. In house orders get the metal stand with  number, everybody else gets a hand off over the counter. The architecture is very contemporary lots stainless steel and wood with the lots subtle natural and discreet artificial lighting. The overall effect is very well done, the dining has a snug cozy feel, while keeping the counter area crisp and bright. The seating is varuios (Edit to self: Dude. Seriously.VARIOUS. Why can't you spell that word correctly?) dark wood table/chair combos but I can't tell you too much about that as when it comes to the ferry building, I'm all about the grab and go. The best sushi is at the sushi counter slightly inside, as the counter options tend to be slightly more basic and standardized. Tasty and awesome no matter what you chose,\n\nThe food here is excellent. It's hard to go wrong with any item. I am a huge fan of the croquettes-whether they are veg or meat. They are huge-about the size of my fist,and fried to crispy perfection. Want something healthy? Get one of the super awesome salads, or even the bento choices-those change from day to day and are more then sufficient for a very satisfying lunch. \n\nPricing? Well a croquette will run you 7 bucks or so, and if you get something to drink you are looking at ten dollars at a minimum. Salad/soup/lunch combo thingys will typically be around 15 dollars and there does not appear to be a top end limit at the sushi counter. It's entirely possible to get a hundred dollar tab at the sushi sit in counter, but for those who don't roll that big fifteen bucks will get you the best lunch you'll have all week, I've focused on the most common items, but bear in mind that the menu here is quite extensive and customizable.

Couldn't they have at least sprung for four pieces? Could they have warmed it up? Also adding plain white rice is $2 surcharge. Oddly the warm rice was the best part of the meal.", "author": "Kathryn S."}

Perhaps my tastes are more refined right now because I just got back from Asia, but this restaurant is terrible. I got the hijiki riceball that people raved about on yelp along with a the 2 salad + rice entree. I chose the eggplant salad, the hijiki salad, and the regular rice and my favorite part of this entire meal is the white rice. The salads were both uninterestingly presented and bland to taste. I felt like I was consuming empty calories that didn't even taste great. It definitely cannot be considered Japanese food. \n\nI didn't order any of the main items, but they were definitely fried ahead of time and real tempura and fried japanese (or any type of asian) food has to be done on the spot. \n\nFor ferry building prices of $15ish for lunch, I would definitely stray far far away from this asian fusion joint.

You order at the counter and it's in Embarcadero Ferry building so not very much seating around. I think most people order to go for lunch. There were quite a few vegan options and I got the agadashi tofu with rice and a salad. We ordered to go and went and ate it outside by the water. Really colorful food and tasted fantastic. It was really light, fresh food, felt pretty good after the meal. They run out of a lot of the vegan options by the evening so lunch is the best time to go. I went once around dinner time and thought they had no vegan options because they had run out of a bunch of stuff and taken away the labels. I was surprised when I came back for lunch and they had a ton of vegan options. So definitely better for lunch and they run out of the good stuff fast.

I ordered delivery from Caviar and the food was pretty good.\n\nHowever, I was very surprised when my $8 Hijiki and Soybean Salad came in this tiny little box. I ordered the bento box for $12.25 with the Hijiki and Soybean Salad in it and it was about the same size. How is that even possible? They either gave me the wrong box because there's no way that was 1/2 lb or it's a scam. Will post pictures later.\n\nYelpers, DO NOT order Hijiki and Soybean Salad as an entree $8, just order that as a part of the bento. It was SOOOO NOT WORTH THE MONEY. It tasted pretty good according to a coworker but I was too mad about the size to care. It SAID 1/2 lb salad.\n\nI didn't have to pay a dime for it myself and I though it was a waste of money.\n\nI had the beef curry which I thought was pretty well made, the meat was very soft and the sauce was good. The curry and rice came in the portions I thought was going to come in, but the salad was just super disappointing. \n\nThe $5 shrimp each was a bit expensive but it was pretty tasty. The tonkatsu was actually better than I thought with a little bit of the sauce they put on it. The chicken dumpling looked very tasty and flavorful (coworkers ate it all :P). They were price per piece so they felt a bit on the pricier side but if you're into that, this is for you.\n\nI hope to be able to review this place again and up the rating because I think this restaurant can do better.

The food display was cute but the taste was pretty meh.\n\nMy friends and I ordered through Caviar and here are our thoughts on each dish we ordered:\n--Ginger Beef Bowl (3/5): this dish was REALLY SWEET. We did not expect this much sweetness at all. Also, it was really oily. Near the bottom of the rice, you can see oil flowing around. We were really excited about this dish until we had our first bite. Really Disappointing.\n--Assorted sushi bento (3.5/5): a great variety but nothing really stood out. Considering the quality & the amount of food they gave you, we think $14.75 for the bento is at the more expensive side.\n--Sweet & Spicy chicken (2/5): first of all, $1.85 for only a really really small piece of chicken, ugh... Also, the chicken was not spicy at all. It was really sweet. Definitely will not order again.\n--Tofu & Chicken Patty with Hijiki (4.5/5): probably our favorite dish among the ones we ordered.

I'm especially excited nowadays because I know San Francisco has a lot of food options to choose from. Not only that, the food is awesome! Today, we decided to visit the famous Ferry business for lunch. Strolling through this place, we came across an Asian joint and you know I'm always down for Asian food, so this was a no brainer!\n\nWhen you walk into this joint, you're greeted with so many options! There's sushi, bento boxes displayed or items in glass casing that you can choose from. The staff is super efficient. They're take your order, have you walk through the stanchions and pay at the end of the line. The staff wasn't too personable, but they also weren't rude, so I was completely fine with this situation. Also, it was a super busy joint so a quick run through is needed to prevent holding up the line. \n\nFor lunch, I just decided to get everything ala carte. Rice on a plate and then the following: \n\n-Crab Croquette for $4.00 each. Dungeness crabmeat blended with a creamy bechamel sauce, lightly breaded and fried. The dipping sauce was a dill tartar sauce. So delicious. The croquette was super creamy but didn't ooze out. the breading was super light and crispy. I also loved the flavor the dil tartar sauce brought. So awesome.\n\n-Sweet and Spicy Chicken for $1.50 each. This was great! The chicken was marinated with sake, soy and ginger and then tossed in a sweet and spicy chili sauce. It was so flavorful! The chicken was juicy and not too spicy. \n\n-Pork Tonkatsu for $1.50 each. Breaded pork with panko and deep fried. Drizzled with homemade tonkatsu sauce. I loved the texture and flavor, however the tonkatsu was cold. I think that's the point of this place but I didn't really like the temperature of the meat. \n\nAll in all, a fantastic place to visit for lunch. It's centrally located and the prices are reasonable. I'm definitely returning to this place in the future and if you're in the area, you should definitely check them out!!", "author": "Rockne H."}

Bento boxes on the table & in the fridge display in the front if you want the pre-selected options and if you want to skip the line.\nPricey? It seems like it at first since the bento looks small, but I was surprisingly really full from the 5-item vegetarian bento ($10.25) Everything tastes gourmet and is definitely not something you can re-create easily at home, so  it is worth the price tag.\n\nThe only thing that knocks down the 1 stars for me is the the wait and checkout process. It's seemingly designed to be fast, however, you end up in the line to pay regardless. I came here at 12 on the dot and after picking up my item, still had to wait about ~7 minutes to pay which doesn't SEEM like that long, but there was only 5-6 people in front of me.. there's only one cashier and people can still order food when they're almost by the register. NOT EFFICIENT...\nWHY DOES THE LINE GO SO SLOWWWWWWWW..................\n\nMaybe it's not that bad during non-Farmer's-Market days - I've only been here on Thursdays, so I wouldn't know.\n\nI was a noob the first time and got a few items a la carte. DON'T DO IT. Stick to the bento boxes and lunch sets for the best value. ($5.25 for one-two servings of wasabi mashed potatoes. Good but NOT WORTH IT @_@)\n\nWasabi mash: Light wasabi flavor but enough to get you going. A bit chunky just asI  like it, peas give a good sweetness to it and the slight bit of romaine lettuce gives it a good texture contrast. I personally wish it was a tad more savory/creamy though.\n\nHijiki (seaweed) & soybean salad: I personally didn't like it.. it's a little too 'healthy' feeling for me but I'm sure it's REALLY good for you.. Stick to small portions of this. This would probably be better if was mixed with kale or something. The sea-flavor was too intense for me and the texture got boring fast. Felt like my breath stank afterwards..\n\nBurdock salad: still don't really know what this is but this was surprisingly good and healthy! Very light, fresh, and crunchy salad. This could also get boring fast though so the portion size in the bento was perfect.\n\nPotato croquette: didn't expect this to be crunchy & it wasn't. Came with a baby BBQ sauce packet and it went well with the croquette. Just OK. Potato was cooked all the way through and seasoned well - it's probably better fresh!\n\nAgedashi tofu: I forgot to dip this with the sauce when I ate it so I can't judge this fairly but the texture was good! \n\nSurprisingly my favorite was the green bean salad. It came with thinly julienned carrots and the light sesame/mayo dressing was SO good........\n\nDefinitely coming back to try more items next time!\nThey also have curry and soup here which seem to be worth trying as well.", "author": "Emily C."}

I've heard a lot of good things about Delica but remember being a little turned off when I walked by once because I tend to distrust Asian fusion and they had some crazy Japanese + Californian creation that made me a little worried. Decided to give it a shot today since I was in a rush and wanted something that I could just grab and go.\n\nThey've got a pretty expansive menu actually. There're combo variations such as main + salad + rice, main + salad + soup, main + salad + salad, etc. Then they have about 10 options listed under each category so you can basically mix and match your own bento boxes essentially. They've also got a couple donburis and other options as well. I went with pork katsu and mabo tofu salad with rice and also grabbed a salmon onigiri. Quick pro tip: if you don't really know what you're getting yourself into just from reading the menu, just look at the displays since they have all the mains in the display -- e.g. I originally thought about chicken dumplings but then saw that they looked more like chicken meatballs\n\nOverall, the food didn't look that amazing, but it was actually pretty good -- would definitely come back. Pork katsu was just pork katsu, pretty typical -- they had the sauce drizzled on it, but the mabo tofu was pretty solid. It looked a little gimpy and not delicious but actually tasted SO good. A little citrusy, very flavorful, and just a salad with tofu, glass noodles (forgot what they're exactly called in English... but the clear noodles basically) and lettuce. It actually complemented the katsu really well since it offset the heaviness of it. I really dug it. The portion size was also pretty good since it kept me full after a long day of walking around pride festivities and was only priced around $8 or so which I thought was a great bargain.\n\nThe salmon onigiri was a bit disappointing so I would probably pass on that. But besides that, the service was pretty friendly, they were really efficient, and it was a really solid deal. I'd definitely be coming here for lunch all the time if I worked near here.\n\ntldr; japanese food meets california -- have some faith, even if the food sounds weird it might be pretty good!", "author": "Jasmine X."}

It was a little overwhelming at first, especially because it gets so busy during the lunch rush.  She even got one of the ladies to give me a sample of one of their salads.  I went with the #4, which is a salad + main + rice ($7.75).  Everything looked so good, but I finally decided on the asparagus salad & the tofu & chicken patty.  The portions are actually pretty good, I thought they were going to be teeny tiny.  \n\nI loved it all!  The asparagus was cooked perfectly and came with shredded carrots and the yummiest creamy dressing.  The tofu & chicken cake was pretty hefty.  It was free-range chicken and organic tofu formed in a patty with seaweed with a sweet soy glaze.  The rice was standard white rice with some black sesame seeds topping it.\n\nOn my second trip I got the #4 as well and went with the mapo tofu salad & the tonkatsu.  The tonkatsu was excellent; they use ACME for the breading & it isn't greasy at all.  I didn't care too much for the mapo tofu salad, it was mixed with vermicelli and lettuce.

It's a pretty simple dish but ever so tasty (I'd rate it 5/5, easily). It consists of flavorful ground beef on top of scrambled eggs, over white rice and adorned with chopped chives. It always hits the spot and as a runner, it's one of the few dishes that my body genuinely appreciates. I feel energized and I run better when I eat it :D. \n\nTip: don't settle for one of the (most likely) lukewarm bowls from the pickup stand; ask them to make it fresh (and hot!). The ginger beef bowl is much better that way. \n\nTheir goma-ae (Japanese-style spinach salad with sesame dressing) is decent enough that I usually order it alongside the ginger beef bowl because it's such a healthy option, but it really could be much more flavorful. \n\nThe umami levels are too weak. I can make a better one myself and have many times, but more often, I'm just lazy and want a serving of a veggie to go along with the beef ginger bowl. The rest of their salads are tastier but not as healthy as the goma-ae. I sometimes order a more flavorful salad and then mix it up with the spinach salad and that actually works pretty well. \n\nDelica's beef curry is very good and worth trying but not great. Rintaro has the very best version of Japanese-style beef curry that I've ever eaten although it's not always available; Murracci's is also better than Delica's version, in my opinion, anyway. \n\nWhen I was less health-conscious, I used to order the potato croquettes at Delica. Very tasty and came with a packet or two of delicious tonkatsu sauce (though sometimes I had to specifically request the sauce).", "author": "Maya B."}

Kind of pricey and definitely wouldn't be one of my go-to places for Japanese as it's more Japanese/Asian fusion, but it's quick and pretty tasty. Most of the sushi is rather simple - nothing special or particularly memorable, but it's fresh and still good. I love the SMOKED SALMON and ROAST BEEF (yes, beef on sushi is odd but it's good!). Aside from sushi, they have various salads, soups, curry and deli items like shrimp cakes and tonkatsu.

There's lotus roots and celery to make it crunchy and the dressing is nice and light. It's not actually spicy though\n\n-ROAST BEEF SUSHI - 4/5\nI oddly enough liked this. I thought it was strange to have beef sushi, but the beef was cooked well (medium rare) and I liked the hint of wasabi\n\n-JAPANESE STYLE BEEF CURRY - 4.5/5\nReally tender beef!

Do note that they have a 5% presentation fee.\n\nEssentially, there are few things more astounding than getting BUCKETS of Japanese curry delivered to your workplace. The platter of croquettes was beautiful, but I guess that a bucket of curry can only be so fancy. The truth of the matter is that Japanese curry is beautiful in itself, and I think they just knew that. The main problem is that I only wanted 2 pounds of salad, sure that no one would be so vegetarian that they'd only eat salad...but the lady was absolutely sure that I would need 5 pounds of salad. Next time, I will rely on my salad math and think, \"Okay, at Whole Foods, when I go to the salad bar, I usually get way under 0.5 pounds of salad. Way under. And that's only because mine wasn't just lettuce. There are 3-4 vegetarians. That's about 2 pounds of salad. Done.\"\n\nAnyway, so that's just a cautionary tale on how to order for catering. Delica is fantastic and has some damn good curry. The croquettes were absolutely my favorite. The chicken katsu was a LOT smaller than I thought it would be. I'm used to getting those huge cuts from Japanese restaurants, but these are maybe the size of 3-4 McNuggets. Not very big. I should've cut down on the salad and ordered about 20 more pieces of that, because that was gone in a flash despite there being meat in the curry (and some were veggie curries). All in all, it was a good experience, but I'm more likely to eat there on my own than go again for curry. For a small group of around 30, that was not the best experience, and I ended up going way over budget after I included the tip.

The fried lunch fare & counters are all shut down, and tables are set up for table-side sushi service, although there was a very small sushi bar counter as well.\n\nI received my menu, and was very happy to see a number of interesting fish on the menu, and not just the 'standards'.  I tried their anago, oh toro, and aburi toro to start, and was very impressed with all of them- so much so that I dipped back for more aburi toro- this was one of the best iterations of this seared toro treat that I have had in the city if not the US, to my surprise.  Usually I only get this in Japan as it is not so common (or perhaps popular?) in the states.  I also enjoyed a delicious halibut carpaccio with a dash of olive oil and other seasonings.\n\nWhile the ambience is nice but stuffy, the pure fish quality and taste of their sushi will bring me back very soon- maybe even tonight.  The prices were not cheap but appropriate for the quality of fish ie- $10/piece nigiri Oh Toro... Anyways, try this when you are looking for taste over atmosphere.  You will enjoy!", "author": "Andy S."}

Cue up the Yelp and up popped Delica.\n\nWe had walked by prior a time or few, and it helped that the line was always out the door. The concept is called Sozai, but I like to think of it as \"fresh casual\" Japanese.\n\nWe got the lunch special, comboing up a main with two sides.\n\nThe Roast Beef Sushi was just slightly dry on the sides, juicy in the center. It's wasabi-inclusive, which helps add a kick along with arugula and shallot, balanced by the refreshing taste of the minced radish and rice. The rice was properly packed, sushi-grade.\n\nThe Wasabi Potato Salad is more than mildly addicting. It, too, balances refreshing with a clever bite, again wasabi. The rest of the dish could be considered a palette refresher, if not for the wasabi tang. The additional greens, edamame and romaine, help add a welcome crisp to the salad.\n\nThe sneaky, underrated Chinese Chicken Salad was the perfect third wheel. It came out loud and proud with the salty flavor, a concoction with the three staples: soy sauce, sesame oil, and chili paste. The crunch of the vegetable medley yielded to the tenderness of the chicken.\n\nA feng shui mindset is perhaps the best way to approach a meal at Delica. It balances you out while filling your stomach.", "author": "Jeffrey C."}

They were surprisingly delicious--my favorite was the eggplant salad with ground chicken. It had a ton of flavor and came in a thicker consistency. This went perfectly with the white rice! Though I ordered a Hijiki and Soybean salad, when I opened my box it was the Spicy Root Salad. Woops on their part. I enjoyed it nonetheless.

Though I'm staying at three stars for now, because I was underwhelmed by my pork cutlet sandwich, I am 100% excited to come back to try their other items.  They just have too many cool creations to miss.  Judging Delica for one item makes as much sense as judging the 2010 Giants season based on one regular season loss.  You just wont get the whole picture.\n\nWith respect to the pork cutlet sandwich I ordered, I thought it was too small and not extraordinary enough to justify the nearly $10 price tag.  I also did not care too much for the sauce and the pork could have been more tender and moist.  In the end, I was still hungry.  \n\nI think I just ordered the wrong thing.  On a positive note, they really do have a lot of goodies.  Most of their veggies (maybe all) are organic.  Meats are farm raised, hormone-free, and grass fed, and everything seem really fresh.\n\nIf you happen to make it, I recommend sampling their $2-$6 a la carte items rather than going for the overpriced sandwiches.  I didn't get to try the roast beef sushi, but that's now on my hit list for my  return trip.\n\nI would have ordered more, but my friend was paying so I was conscious about running up the bill (though here I am complaining about the price of a meal I didn't pay for).

(Burdock, which I didn't even know is called that, is so refreshing!)\n\nChinese chicken salad: with Japanese cucumber, daikon, carrot, and celery in a soy dressing. (I probably wouldn't order this one again for a lack of creativity in the flavors on Delica's part).\n\nAgedashi tofu: firm tofu deep fried and served with a thick tentsuyu broth topped with grated daikon (served cold! that part I didn't like.. the deep fried covering was soggy and the taste of oil was too apparent).\n\nTofu and chicken patty with hijiki: meatball like with tofu and chicken and bits of carrots. (not mindblowing, but inspiration to something I might try to make in my own kitchen. also served cold).\n\nAccompanying the two lunch dishes, which were carefully carried from Delica to the rustic wooden tables in the hall, were a salmon rice ball and an edamame and kuko rice ball. Our meal definitely looked the part. Now for the tasting!\n\nI was happy with lunch, more because of the ingredients used in the dishes and the way they were presented. Everything tasted delightful: light and yet flavorful. You don't get sick of any one dish and there's the added benefit that what you're dining on is both tasty and healthful.\n\nCertain dishes are vegan friendly, namely the hijiki and soybean salad and the burdock salad. Others are vegetarian like the wasabi garlic potato salad and the green beans salads. Price may be a hindering factor for making this a regular lunch spot, but for the most part, my long time asian food trained tongue says yes.", "author": "Cici T."}

Naturally raised meats, no hormones, no antibiotics, no MSG.  The restaurant is designed such that you can order many small dishes to help you maintain a nice balanced and healthy meal.  \nFor lunch till 5pm you have the cafeteria style service where you can order from behind the counter....after 5pm you have your restaurant style service.  I've been there for both lunch and dinner.  I've got to say I've enjoyed meals and have not yet had a bad experience.  The lunch menu is different from the dinner menu.  Here are some items I've had for lunch:\n\nSalmon Rice Ball\nCured and roasted wild salmon mixed with sesame seeds and steamed rice.  Makes a good snack or you can put it together with another item(s) for a complete meal.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QlRD2t-uqhAlXX1fnIfPKw&userid=SRnOg-4Ya4g4dUQ1x0Tdkg\n\nHijiki Rice Ball\nhijiki (seaweed rich in calcium, iron, and fiber) mixed with dried soybeans, edamame, konnyaku (mountain potato), daikon, fried tofu, kuko (wolfberry) cooked with soy sauce and steamed rice.  This also will make a good snack or can be good to order with another item for a complete meal.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=hJibOODMFp8mKU3UYP5BYQ&userid=SRnOg-4Ya4g4dUQ1x0Tdkg\n\nRoast Beef Sushi\nOur original sushi dish with Meyer Ranch natural, hormone-free beef, topped with baby arugula, minced shallots, and julienne radish, wrapped with Nori seaweed. Wasabi is included.  This is absolutely delicious.  When ordering this I usually order at least 3 pc's for myself.  The beef is very tender, the rice does not dominate the meat or flavor.  Come early for this item....once they are gone...there are no more till the next day.  Also not served after 5pm.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=NsIXZcigmyxGLFveQnxjfg&userid=SRnOg-4Ya4g4dUQ1x0Tdkg\n\n\nShrimp Cake\nMade with white shrimp and coated in our freshly made panko breadcrumbs. Served with your choice of our tomato or tartar sauce. \nBest Shrimp Cake I've had so far.  Every bite is a mouth full of shrimp.  If your a shrimp lover this is your dish.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xlXnPitrO9Mjfq3aPAyNVQ?select=6DXlvCDq7KAWLm53qbmLGg\n\nSpicy Tuna Roll\nThe way the Spicy Tuna Roll is prepared ...the Tuna sits on top of the rice....this is awesome because it allows for more tuna to the sushi roll.  Got to love it!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=6l1skAHABDdl_nl_wAnIHg&userid=SRnOg-4Ya4g4dUQ1x0Tdkg\n\n\nHere are some of the items I've had from the dinner menu:\n\nNegi Hamachi Hand Roll\nYellow Tail wrapped in seaweed, topped with crispy rice bits.  Seaweed is nice and crunchy...yet just the right amount of rice and Yellow Tail to make it an awesome Hand Roll!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=B4TELccjTGFen-YbCSKq3g&userid=SRnOg-4Ya4g4dUQ1x0Tdkg\n\nSpicy Tuna Hand Roll\nVery much like the Negi Hamachi Hand Roll except with Spicy Tuna.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=TVFMiYsb0uJf6zijLGP-Tw&userid=SRnOg-4Ya4g4dUQ1x0Tdkg\n\nKobe Beef Tataki\nTorched Tri-Tip from Niman Ranch with a touch of Onion and Garlic Ponzu and Sweet Eel Sauce.\nThis dish is a absolutely must have.  It's served only after 5pm and I've had it on all my visits here after 5pm.  Very tender, very tasty.....I can have this dish alone and leave with a big smile on my face afterwards. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wKin0ReDFmeA1APzpmg5kQ&userid=SRnOg-4Ya4g4dUQ1x0Tdkg\n\nOverall, this restaurant is very nice and pleasant.  The workers here are very friendly and service is fantastic.  The restaurant is inside the Ferry Building so it makes is a very nice environment.  Many things to do before and after the meal.

Keep in mind I have had several years in the restaurant + bar industry as a server so I'm not just complaining to complain. \n\nThe good: We walked in on a quiet Tuesday around 6 to tons of seating and friendly servers. We sat, and mind you, my friend is 8 months pregnant. Plenty to order for her and me. Something for everyone on the menu - including gluten-free and vegan items. Sashimi and rolls were fresh, miso was tasty, chicken karaage delciious. \n\nThe bill arrived. I tipped 19% to be exact. The bill was taken away.\n\nWe sat for about ten minutes - probably less - just finishing our water, etc. The place was not packed, however a family of five came in, and because we were at the emptiest communal table, we were asked to leave the table. Not *would* we leave the table but that we *must* leave the table. She wasn't exactly rude but not suggestive either. \n\nI have to stay I was stunned. My (very pregnant) friend was stunned. We were speechless. I'm never speechless. We walked out so disappointed. \n\nI was tempted to ask for my bill back so I could change the tip but I've decided I'm better than that and I will hope that if I support them again, this situation will be handled differently.\n\nMy solution? How about, \"We have a large party waiting. About how much longer do you think you'll be? How can we help move you so you can stay and enjoy our near- empty restaurant?\" The way the server posed it was not the right way. \n\nI hope the manager or owner can read this and have a little chat with their staff about the ways to speak to paying customers.", "author": "Meredith R."}

In particular, the salads are fantastic. I get VERY excited when the eggplant salad is back in season. The eggplant is tender and the sauce is so savory but clean-tasting at the same time. Simply delish! Other standout seasonal salads include the mapo tofu salad and the asparagus salad. \n\nThe regular salads aren't bad either but since they are always there, I don't covet them as much as, say, the eggplant salad for example. But all things considered, the Hijiki and soybean salad, the spinach and sesame salad, and the Chinese chicken salads are all good bets. Out of their main dishes, the tofu steak with chicken is surprisingly hearty and the fried shrimp cake is simply mind-blowing. Perfectly fried without being greasy and fresh shrimp on the inside make it a nice accompaniment to the salads. \n\nDelica is a great interpretation of what deli food can be, incorporating the \"clean\" taste of Japanese cuisine to offer a light and delicious lunch while you soak in the sun and bay breeze.", "author": "Jon L."}

That's a name more suitable for a car, I think.\n\nYes, it's a little expensive, but nice place when u want something other than a sandwich for lunch. This is a modern Japanese delicatessen, selling their own high-end version of sozai cuisine (small plates of comfort food) and a few traditional dishes. The bento boxes ($9.75) are a nice way to sample a little bit of everything. Some of my favorites are the ginger beef bowl http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/G2I9_EOXAx7AUbmVPCfyCg/l ($8.75, ginger seasoned ground beef with scrambled eggs) and ginger pork bowl (grilled pork cutlets).

Ou waiter was really nice and friendly but the sushi chefs are slow.  I wonder how they are when it's lunch time and super busy. \nHmmmm.... I might have to give this place another try.", "author": "Claudine V."}

While the menu offers a great selection of very tasty dishes, I can't help but feel like a lot of it is overpriced. Maybe it's the location? I haven't eaten at any other restaurants in the Ferry Building, so perhaps my perspective is a little off. \n\nIt's been easy to get a seat both times for dinner. As the tables are long and thin, expect to share space with other diners. Our waitresses have always been very helpful and knowledgeable about the food, and the trio of salads -- which has differed each time I've been here -- very flavorful and unique. If you're ok with splurging a bit, get some fresh sashimi/nigiri and the kobe beef: again, delicious, but I feel like I can get the same quality dishes elsewhere for almost half the price they charge here. \n\nI also really like the fried (I think?) avocado, and last time was pleasantly surprised by the Japanese curry -- really different than anything I'd tried and well worth the wait. No dessert here, but fortunately there's a place with ice cream and shakes just around the corner.", "author": "Justine M."}

However, this still doesn't mask the fact that it has a couple things going against it, in my opinion:\n\n1. The attitude. The young woman behind the counter barely listened, and would sigh and roll her eyes every time we asked a question about any item on their menu -- which was self-consciously filled with unusual items like \"roast beef sushi\" and did not communicate portions etc. on the counter. She acted put-out and haughty that we were not familiar with the \"delicia\" experience. The snooty french-waiter act might have played if it wasn't basically a mediocre lunch counter with pretentious aspirations.\n\n2. The food was no better than what you'd get at a refrigerated section of a decent market. For example, the \"roast beef sushi\" was ok, but because it was (intentionally) a chilled dish, the flavor was flat and bland, with nothing to activate the taste. The other items I sampled from my wife's plate were similar.\n\nDid I mention it is overpriced?\n\nFlat. Bland. Overpriced. That pretty much describes this place to a tee.

Delica is a Japanese-fusion takeout lunch spot that gets pretty busy during lunch hour. The menu is very overwhelming and confusing if you are coming here for the first time. It repeats \"SALAD\" to a distressing degree. Should I have a Main + SALAD + SALAD or a triple-threat SALAD + SALAD + SALAD? How many SALADs are in the display case? What's in each SALAD?\n\nI ended up giving a frazzled order for a Main (Tonkatsu) + SALAD (Spicy Burdock) + SALAD (Wasabi Garlic Potato), which cost me about $10. Maybe it's less stressful to just get a pre-made bento box for around the same price. The salads were quite fresh and unique, especially the wasabi garlic potato. If you aren't a fan of wasabi, I probably wouldn't suggest it. The flavors come in phases and the wasabi kicks in last.The Tonkatsu was cold and not the best, so I would probably recommend you avoid it.\n\nYou can buy salad by the pound and pay for individual \"main\" items. I believe there is a sit down portion of Delica? It's all very stressful and confusing for a novice.

I checked with Paul and it was the same for him.  Worse actually, because one of his bigger pieces was all fat.  Taste-wise, it was okay.  It was spicy enough to have a little kick.  But when I asked for Paul's opinion, he thought it was totally bland.  His words:  \"You could say I'm somewhat of a curry aficionado.  This curry is really bland and the curry I make at home blows this away.\"  And I kinda know what he means.  The rice was really good.\n\nAnyways, I think 3 stars is accurate.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-06-07", "description": "I will tell a big secret - Delica RF1 is a VERY Japanese place.  Of all the SF Japanese restaurants, this place could best compete if they sold the same food in Japan, evident by the fact that you could find RF-1 at the basement floor of department stores in Tokyo (see downloaded pic).  It is not Japanese food from 1970's (like many J-town restaurants).  It gives you a small insight into some of the popular foods in modern Japan.  I am not saying RF-1 is the most popular type of food found in Tokyo as there are vast variety of other options available.  When transplants from Tokyo finds Delica, they are so happy to see a piece of Japan they miss.  \n\nMany people are surprised to hear this, because Delica offers food seemly Americanized.  Nope.  Americanized means taste was altered to fit the likings of American customers.  Food at Delica, along with many places in Tokyo, has been Japanized.  The taste was altered to the likings of Japanese customers - altered so much that it is now considered Japanese food.  Items in this category include: Ramen, Kasutera, Tonkatsu, Hamburg, egg sandwich, etc.\n\nWhat does this mean?  Well, you might not like their food.  Selling food that was designed to meet Japanese people's preferences to Americans is a crazy idea.  But, they opened a branch here, probably more for marketing purposes rather than for profits.  Japanese companies like to show the equity holders that they are expanding abroad, just like Beard Papa.  I don't care, because I am happy that it is here.   \n\nLike I said, 80% of the Japanese restaurants in SF wouldn't survive if they moved to Tokyo.  Just like San Francisco, restaurant industry in Tokyo is fiercely competitive, so if you are serving food that tastes like something I could cook at home (80% of SF J-Food), you are done.  All you need to know is that Delica's food is surviving the competition in Tokyo.  The food is especially popular among OLs (office ladies) (yes, the word is sexist, but I didn't invent the word).  Don't get me wrong, the traditional Japanese food like tempura and unaju is still popular in Japan, but food in Japan has done though significant transformations since 1945.  It is now quite diverse - while the passion for food has not changed.        \n\nDelica is a creation of Rock Field Co., Ltd.   The founder, Mr. Iwata Kozo, did a direct translation of his kanji characters and named the company Rock (Iwa) Field (ta).  Although the company sounds western, it is completely Japanese company.  The company has an impressive mission - to address the environment, safety, and freshness of Japanese food.  The founder had concerns about the direction of Japanese diet and is making the effort to change for the better.  Positioning Delica branch at the Ferry Building is fitting to their theme.  Where else would you find beef curry that uses Prather Ranch Meat?  Mushroom curry that uses Far West Fungi mushrooms?     \n\nSEATS:  Very limited.  Find a place outside to sit and eat under the sun.\n\nPRICE:  There is a price to the environment, safety, and freshness.  If you want cheaper food, look for MSG infused dishes at cheaper restaurants.  Expect to pay $10-14 for lunch.\n$9.50 - Bento box with five items\n$7.75 - Regular size curry\n$1.50 - Potato coroke", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

It's informal.  You order up your selections at or near the cashier station.  You get your food in recyclable take-out containers.  You grab some compostable utensils.  You find a seat or take it on the go.  The food is beautifully prepared, and the spectacular flavors will surprise you.\n\nEverything I've tried to date has been delicious whether it be the Organic Mabo Tofu Salad, the signature Roast Beef Sushi or the Wild Salmon and Sesame Genmai Rice Ball.\n\nThe Shrimp Curry is probably my favorite selection here.  Depending on my appetite I usually go for the regular serving, but I have stuffed myself with the large portion on occasion.  In a mild brown curry sauce expect to find lots of firm baby shrimp, chunks of soft zucchini and tomato pieces nearly melted away.  They use seasonal vegetables in their curry dishes so you may not get the same zucchini and tomato combination that they've been serving up lately.  The curry is served with a generous portion of hot steamed rice to the side allowing you to eat each part separately or all mixed together.\n\nThe Potato and White Corn Croquette is outstanding.  It reminds me of the deep-fried taro root pastries found at many Chinese dim sum houses, but it is far less oily.  These are deep-fried also.  It's a smooth, creamy potato center with a delicate crispy, crumbly shell on the outside.  Bite into the croquette and you will discover soft, creamy kernels of white corn inside.  \n\nMost of the prepared food is on display inside the crystal clear deli cases and each looks like a different work of art.  The different bento box selections will fascinate you on looks alone.  I haven't tried any of the bento box selections, but in time I look forward to sampling many of them.\n\nIt's not uncommon to see visitors inside photographing the food.

Most of the sit-down restaurants weren't open yet, and I was cold, tired and wet from the rain and walking around.  I just happened to walk into Delica and saw that they had Japanese-style curry!  I thought that it'd be a good reminder of home (curry is my mom's old standby) and decided to go with it.  \n\nI got the beef curry with a potato croquette and shrimp cake.  \n\nThe beef curry was really good - just enough amount of heat with the beef soooo tender...  it was a BIT too oily for me, but even that was comforting in the rainy weather.\n\nThe potato croquette was delish as well - so much crunch on the outside thanks to the panko crust.  The chunks of potato inside may have been a bit too big causing some bites to taste seasoned and others to feel bland... but when dipped in the curry....  yum~\n\nThe shrimp cake was my favorite.  It was small, whole shrimps mixed with other yummy fillings, shaped into a disk, coated with panko then fried up to perfection.  The shrimps were so plump - steamed perfectly inside their yummy casings.\n\nAll in all, it'd be a great place to stop by and grab a bite if you're around the area.", "author": "Vicky P."}

You know that everything is good for you and loaded with nutrients.  I mean come on, any place that offers a lunch combo consisting of THREE salads is up there on the health meter.  Even when I tried to slightly de-healthify my lunch combo by getting the one fried item and two salads, it STILL didn't work.  \n\nDespite my urges to get the sweet sesame chicken as my fried item, I had to veer away from my inner Panda Express and get what I thought looked the most visually magnificent: the Kaki Age.  It is probably the largest tempura fried item I have ever seen.  I mean it's definitely not something you hold in your hand or eat in one bite.  You have to break it apart and for some reason, the shredded vegetables binds it so firmly together that it becomes quite difficult to separate.  I do like that big pieces of white shrimp are incorporated into it.  Unfortunately, all these aren't fried on the spot so they've been sitting in the glass counter and is missing the aspect that I like most about tempura and fried foods in general, the fresh friedness.\n\nAs for the Hijiki Soybean Salad and the Mascarpone Corn Salad, I definitely preferred the latter since I'm a die hard corn fan.  I like the creaminess from the mascarpone and a lot of the kernels stick together so it's easy to eat even with chopsticks.  Not to sound redundant but the Hijiki was really healthy and actually makes your body feel good when you're eating it but may be weird if you're not familiar with the ingredients.\n\nIf you don't feel like waiting in line, you can choose from many of their pre-packaged bento boxes or rolls.  Everything looked mysterious but what caught my eye was the spicy tuna roll and oddly enough the roast beef nigiri.  Twisting the Japanese cuisine in this way may not jive well with the authenticians but it definitely fits in with the Ferry Building crowd.", "author": "Shannon L."}

The pork was just tender enough to make it easy to eat, but chewy enough to balance the softness of the bread (which came from Acme Bread, also in the Ferry Building). What really stood out was the sweetness of the Tonkatsu sauce. It had just a hint of sourness and really made the sandwich as delicious as I hoped.\n\nThe Mabo salad was a very pleasant surprise. I love Mabo Tofu and was unsure of what to expect from the salad. The only way to say it is, it's like mabo in a salad, in a good way. Very tasty.\n\nMy friend got the bento and the onigiri. Both were made with very fresh ingredients but I wouldn't argue that they were particularly stand out compared to the other two. The salmon onigiri was very flavorful though.\n\nThe ingredients are high quality and they have some definite gems on their menu. However, you really do pay a premium when you eat at the Ferry Building and while most of the time I'd give a place like this four stars because I loved what I had so much, the bento seems to be a bit hit or miss.

That's how we ended up here.\n\nWhen you arrive here (for lunch) you can see that there's a huge variety of salads and main dishes. Oh boy! I got the main dish + salad + rice combo, which totaled $8.41. I looked for the most interesting salad that I could find, and ended up with the Hijiki + soybean salad. It consisted mainly of seaweed, so I was really excited. For my main dish, I decided to go with the more traditional sweet and spicy chicken. \n\nThe quality of the food is really high. The salad was every bit the way I imagined it would be - not super crunchy, but sweet and tasty. The chicken was really good and quite filling. The rice was well done, and had ample sesame seeds. \n\nUnfortunately, I felt that there was not enough food for $8.41.

I showed and returned the bento box and asked for a replacement. The Japanese lady took a picture of the fingernail and said preparers use gloves and that she'll find out whose nail it was. Really!

Salmon chowder was on the sweet side (not what your taste buds expect) and carrot/ginger soup lacked any seasoning (but was tasty once I added a fair amount of salt).  The \"spicy\" tuna roll was HORRIBLE. The tuna was completely without any seasoning at all...NO salt or SPICE. I think the chef literally forgot to season the fish before making the roll.  The tempura nest was completely cold and greasy (it's probably decent if you ask them to make it fresh) and the Agassi tofu main dish was as awful as the spicy tuna... Hard, bland and completely tasteless.

The food is spot on Japanese with many modern twists. The food is high quality and the flavorings are perfect. It IS set up like a deli or take out joint. I like sampling their bento, with different and often new dishes to try out. I tried their hijiki (a kind of seaweed that looks like black grass) which is normally prepared sauteed with fried tofu sacs (abura age) and slivers of carrots (somewhat like this: http://justbento.com/handbook/johbisai/stewed-hijiki-seaweed-carrots-and-fried+tofu). Theirs included shelled edamame, which would have made me freak, since I mostly eat edamame boiled, salted and with a nice cold Japanese beer. But they got it right! The edamame was not mushy as I would have suspected, and complemented the other ingredients.\n\nI often don't bother getting any sushi from take out joints, because it often sits on ice or refrigeration which just makes the rice stale and hard. However, theirs are freshly made, and, if you time it right, can be quite good. The sushi is generally traditional Japanese style sushi, so if you are looking for the deep fried American style makizushi smothered in hot sauce and mayo, you would be disappointed. In fact, if that is your idea of Japanese food, please skip this place so I can hoard more. Slanted Door on the other side of the building might be more your speed ;)", "author": "\u548c\u5b50"}

They had the actual dishes on display outside the door.  The okonomiyaki was tiny ($5, 2 kinds: vegetarian (mushroom) and chicken), so I ordered the ginger pork bowl ($10).\n\nThe ginger pork was cooked to order.  I received four large, thin pieces of boneless, marinated, pan fried pork chops nestled over a bed of steamed white rice, finely shredded raw cabbage and a drizzle of ginger-soy sauce.  The portion was quite generous.  The sauce was too salty and not very gingery.  The pork was quite tough, like my own attempts to cook pork chops at home.  \n\nI'd skip the ginger pork bowl and stick with their croquettes, rice balls, side salads (my favorite is the Hijiki and Soybean Salad but I like all of their salads) and the scrumptious chicken dumplings.  The chicken dumpling isn't just a mushy meatball; water chestnuts add a pleasant crunch, the shitake mushrooms add flavor and texture and the tofu makes it light and tender.  I love their preassembled bento boxes ($9.50 each) - a quick way to grab a healthy, satisfying, portable lunch.  Add on a Japanese bottled drink if you want.\n\nThe food isn't a bargain ($2 for one piece of roast beef sushi) but it is fresh, seasonal, high quality and elegantly presented.

( Pictures: http://www.bunnyeats.com/2009/01/osechi-from-delica-rf-1.html  ) \n \nI think almost all Japanese people who live in Japan eat some sort of Osechi for the new year celebration.  (FYI We celebrate January 1st / western new year's day).\n\nOsechi consists of many good luck dishes. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osechi New Year celebration is one of the biggest holiday of the year in Japan.  Osechi dishes are prepared before new year's day and eaten 1st through 3rd of January (Called Sanganichi) so that women do not have to cook and can enjoy the celebration with family and guests.  All the dishes are displayed in beautiful lacquered boxes and consumed cold. They are prepared to last at least 3 days by either braised, salted, pickled, candied or dried. We usually visit family and friends and eat Osechi at different houses for the 3 days.  Each region and family have different variation for their Osechi.  The restaurants, schools, stores, and almost all other stores are also closed for the first 3 days (it is changing now 10 years ago or so and some store stay open through the new year).     .  \n \nThis years Osechi at Delica was $300 ($50 discount if you bring back the lacquer box from previous year).  The menu included:\n \n1st Tier:\n1. Seasoned Prawns - Tasted like Preservative or chemical...  May be farm raised imported shrimp?\n2. Rolled Kobe style beef with Burdock - I liked the tasty crunchy burdock but Kobe style beef was too fat to be eaten cold.\n3. Roast Beef - It was tender and nicely cooked medium well.  I think it could use little more seasoning and should have been sliced thinner.\n4. Smoked Salmon with Fromage Blanc - Tasted ok but it's NOT Osechi!\n5. Slow-Cooked Abalone - Nice flavor and nice texture beautify presented in the Abalone shell\n6.  Marinated Herring Roe - It was beautifuly prepared without any membrane but tasted bitter and I didn't eat them.  When you prepare herring roe, you have to be careful not to over soak them.  If you take away too much salt from the roe, it become bitter and uneatable.  \n7. Kombu Cured Sea Bream (Tai) - Tasted elegant. The tast of Kombu came through.\n8. Roasted Duck Breast - Perfectly salted.  Tender and not too fatty.\n9. Salted Olives with Cheese - It is NOT Osechi and made everything in the box smell like olives.  PLEASE DO NOT PUT OLIVES in Osech next year!\n \nSecond Tier:\n10. Pickled Daikon and Carrot with Dungeness Crab - I think they shouldn't have put Crab in Namasu (Picked Daikon /Carrot).  Crab is not traditional and didn't go well with the dish.  Also, crabs had cartridges in them...  The vegetable tasted the way they suppose to be.  Sweet sour and good.\n11. Braised Burdock Root with sesame - Kansai style vinegary burdock.  \n12. Caramelized Dried Anchovy with Pine Nuts - I never liked this dish as I grow up but I was pleasantly surprised I liked them for the first time.  It was nutty and not too sweet.\n13. Sweet Black Beans - Perfectly cooked plump and shiny beautiful large beans. I could tell they used high quality \"Tanba\" beans from Japan. \n14. Mashed Sweet Potato with Chestnuts - One of the best Kurikinton I ever had.  Not too sweet.  I could taste wonderful character of Japanese sweet potatoes.\n15. Pickled Chrysanthemum Shaped Radish - Very beautiful and refreshing\n16. Karasumi Bottarga (Salted dried Mullet roe) - Thinly sliced high quality Mullet roe. Very tasty reminds me of aged (24month+) Gouda.\n \nThird Tier\n17. Braised Shitake Mushroom Taro, Bamboo Shoot, Carrot, Lotus root, Konnyaku and Green Peas - I loved every bite.  Perfectly cooked in light Japanese fish broth. Only thing was Lotus root was little overcooked..\n18. Baked Omelet with Shrimp Puree - Nice light texture with hint of shrimp flavor.  I ate it with soy sauce and wasabi.\n19. Black Cod w/ Sweet Miso - Tasted very good cold.  Black Cod was fatty in good way\n20. Minced and Roasted Chicken with Saikyo Miso Topped with White Sesame.  It was good but I think they put too much chicken fat in it.  May be needed little more saltiness too.\n21. Rolled Kombu - nicely cooked soft and tender high quality kombu \n  \nOverall, I was very pleased with Delica's osechi.  I had low expectation since I never had a great store-bought Osechi before even in Japan.  Except a few dishes I mentioned above, everything tasted great.  I also liked the fact they did not use too much sugar in their cooking (In Tokyo where I grow up, Ochechi have \"Amakara\" sweet and salty seasoning which I do not like...)  I think their seasoning style is Kansai (western Japan) style.  I will buy their Osechi again if I'm in the US next year for the New Year.", "author": "Chie J."}

They do have salads, but the enticing fried counter by the door will bring out the inner Jennifer Hudson in all of us!  It'd taste better if these treats came directly out of the grease, but they are still decent when slightly cold from behind the counter.  Definitely leaps and bounds ahead of other pre-cooked lunchtime deli options.\n\nPork Tonkatsu: The outside is crispy despite not being fresh out of the fryer.  The pork inside is partially cold and dry.  The sauce on top is nice.\n\nChicken Dumpling with Sweet Chili Sauce: Basically a fried chicken meatball.  The outside is really awesome with good seared meat and a nice chili glaze.  This one is small and went down a bit too fast.\n\nPotato Croquette: Executed well, but could use some filling.  The potato and onion get a little boring, even with soy dipping sauce, after a few bites.\n\nFried Shrimp Cake: Yay for mainly being large pieces of shrimp instead of some crab cake-like filler!  I could do without the unimaginative tartar sauce.  Tastes better with soy or sriracha (from my desk).\n\nKakiage Tempura: Basically a cluster-funk of tempura vegetables and shrimp.  Major kudos for innovating on the rather common and boring tempura veggies.  I especially like the inner onions that didn't seem as deep fried and offered a more potent kick.  And the soy beans are an awesome taste and texture addition!\n\nHijiki Rice Ball: Too fishy for my tastes though I appreciated all the textures and flavors coming from the veggies, beans and seeds.  Perhaps a little less seaweed next time...\n\nCream Puff: When eating a cream puff, you know who I must compare to-- Beard Papa!  The cream was spot on, good vanilla hint and super creamy.  The puff itself was too chewy and tasted like something from a bodega snack section.

Being Japanese I am a bit picky of the Japanese food that I eat, but I definitely approve of this place. \n\nSome dishes that I recommend are the following:\n\n1. spicy tuna dip - they serve the spicy tuna they use in their roll on a plate with avocado and tortilla chips. The spice of the spicy tuna is complimented very well with the avocado. The chips make it easy to share with other people. I don't recommend actually dipping the chip in the spicy tuna because the chip will break. \n\n2. yaki curry - this was suggested to is by our waiter, and he was right this dish is so delicious. Basically they put rice and Japanese curry in a dish with cheese on top and bake it in the oven for about 15 minutes. I've always loved eating my curry with parmesan cheese, but baking it with cheese, I've never thought of that. I think baking the dish allows the curry flavor to infuse into the rice while the flavor of the cheese infuses into the curry. It was a whole lot of great flavors mixed together, and this dish definitely warms you up on a cold winter night. \n\n3. toro roll - I love toro (fatty tuna), and I love how it just melts in your mouth! This roll consists of toro and green onion. Must I say more? This roll has been a constant repeat everytime I come. \n\nAside from the dishes noted above, Delica usually has an assortment of fresh fish. The selection changes from day to day, but they have unique types of fish such as king fish that you usually don't find at the fake Japanese sushi restaurants. \n\nIf you are ever in the ferry building, stop by. They also have happy hour from 5pm to 7pm.", "author": "Ayaka S."}

The box comes with  spinach sesame salad, a main item (tempura and I paid extra for the katsu- unlike any katsu I've tried) and sweet sushi-like rice.  All of it unique with Delica artistry.  \n\nFresh, flavorful, different than other bentos.", "author": "Surai J."}

I ordered their mushroom curry which was pre-cooked as all their other food. It was in a big pot and I got it on top of rice. 10 minutes into my meal when I brought it back to the office, I noticed something that shouldn't have been there - a strand of hair! I was so repulsed that I took the time to go back to them after work and made complain. By that time, the lunch shift has ended and Delica turned into a sushi place. So the lady said she can't do anything for me then, but will call me back. Guess what, one week later, NOTHING! I will never eat here again as they completely lost my respect on how a food business should run. When a customer takes the time to go back and make a formal complaint, standard procedure will be to follow up.", "author": "Sheri T."}

I had made reservations for the sushi bar, which seats only 5, and I'm glad I did as the other tables looked like something out of the Ikea restaurant. The only drawback of sitting at the bar is that it's so small that the wait staff will constantly put their orders to the sushi chef over your shoulder if you sit at the right end.\n\nWhen ordering, I liked that the staff made sure to tell us which fish was the freshest (the sea urchin from Monterey, and it was deliciously smooth and buttery}. We also ordered the 9 nigiri chef's selection, spicy tuna roll, Delica roll and Toro roll. Everything was very clean and presented well.\n\nThe wait staff is friendly if a bit slow. In general, there's only one sushi chef and an assistant, who I think makes the rolls, so it can get backed up really quickly, but it's worth the wait if you're not in too much of a hurry. The sushi chef when I went was a woman, which I've never seen before, so it makes me want to support Delica even more.", "author": "rosanna c."}

I usually get 5 or more tonkatsu because they are like potato chips- you simply cannot eat just one. The meat is completely free of fat, perfectly fried, and drizzled with a delicious squiggle of sauce. Amazingly, it goes great with the beef curry, which has a pleasant kick to it. The employees working the counter are friendly, and will always ask if you've been helped yet. If what you want is all gone, they will make it for you fresh if you're willing to wait (I did this once for some extra tonkatsu). \n\nMy only gripe about the place are the prices. When I go here, I get a regular beef curry and 5-6 tonkatsu. The curry is around $8 and the tonkatsus are $1.50 each, so I end up spending about $16-$20 (depends on if I get a $2 bottled apple tea or not). But I am willing to shell out the dough because this food is really just that good. \n\nSince I've moved from the city, I ALWAYS make it a priority to come back here for my curry and tonkatsu fix when I am in town, even if it has to be right before I'm to get on an Amtrak bus bound for my train in Emeryville. I will gladly stink up that bus with potent curry fumes if it means I can eat it while it's hot and fresh. (I apologize in advance if you end up on that bus with me.)\n\nP.S.

What a great concept -- sadly, the deli folks told me the wasabi mashed potatoes contained dairy (a bad allergy for me).  I settled instead for a tofu steak -- a slab of tofu the size of 4 servings (think \"deck of cards\") covered in black bean sauce that was really just chunky black beans (also an allergen for me).  The side salads that were vegan were not impressive -- I'm usually a big fan of hijiki but this was pretty flavorless and mushy.  The black beans made me nauseous and I ended up throwing away more than half my meal after the leftovers sat in the fridge for over a week.\n\nIf you're vegan - there are better options at the Ferry Building.  If you are a vegetarian or omni, this place should tickle your fancy.

There was their potato salad type thing with wasabi mayo in it and I really liked it.  The heat was not unbearable and just enough \"BAM\" to impress me.  Their food was tasty and original.  I knew this.  It's not what my managers would have liked, which is more traditional Japanese.\n\nOverall, the staff behind the counters were very friendly and the food was good enough for me.

It was the best Japanese curry I've ever had. It was very hot, creamy and... crunchy? Yes! The curry was topped with thinly sliced lotus roots that were fried so they have the texture of chips.

A bowl of this for $5.50 will fill you up for lunch.  I didn't really pick up on the ginger, though there was enough to counterbalance any potential bitterness from the carrot.

Meat sushi - a chilled piece of cooked roast beef on a ball on sushi rice with a little wasabi glue.  It was ok, but it really left me wanting something else to help bring it together.  The reason such a simple thing works so well with good cuts of fish is because the natural flavor is so much more complex than cooked meat.  I think a little minced garlic and/or scallion shavings could have really helped.  Not worth $2.50.\n\nSesame Spinach Seaweed Salad: 1 star\nI like cold raw spinach and warm wilted spinach.  Having tried this, I can now say I dislike cold wilted spinach...or at least how it's done here.  It was dense pile of cold wilted spinach hit with a splash of sesame-inspired liquid.

My friend only ordered a prepackaged sushi role and it cost  $14.  \n\nI might come back here but because of the proximity to my work and to eat outside on the Embarcadero.

Another very minor minus is that there aren't too many selections to choose from. Again - this is minor - but it would be good to have more options.

It's high-end (i.e. expensive), they use fresh ingredients and even utilize some of the vendors that reside in the Ferry Building (Cowgirl Creamery and Prather Meat Company). I was lucky enough to end up here with my wife and sister in law, so we were able to get a pretty good sampling of food between the three of us. $47 later, here's how things broke down. \n\nFor all their talk about fresh, healthy and balanced meals, Delica's strength is definitely in their fried foods. The Potato Croquette was really nice, but the Crab Cream Croquette is even better. Tonkatsu was smaller and bite sized since it's made with pork tenderloin, a smaller, leaner cut of meat that benefits from being fried in panko. They're all perfectly fried, not greasy and still crispy after sitting in the display case for awhile. \n\nWe also tried both curries -- Mushroom and Ground Chicken Curry and Beef Curry served with hot steamed rice -- and they were good, but they also weren't anything special either, although the beef curry featured some perfectly cooked Prather Ranch Meat.\n\nBut the real star at Delica is the Roast Beef Sushi. A rare piece of Meyer Ranch meat on top of sushi rice and topped with baby arugula, shallots and julienned radish. It not only looked beautiful, it was absolutely delicious. And to think it was almost an afterthought because it was in a separate box from the rest of the food and we were all pretty full by the time we ate them.\n\nWe also ordered the Spinach and Sesame Salad (Goma-ae), which was very bland, but my sister in law said that that's what it's supposed to taste like. The Sweet & Spicy Chicken was good but nothing mind blowing, as was the Chicken Dumpling with sweet chili sauce. \n\nI really wanted to try the Tofu Steak with Miso Sauce and Kakiage Tempura (mixture of shredded vegetables, white shrimp in a tempura batter), but we already had too much food, but I think the next time I go, I'm just going to get three orders of roast beef sushi and call it a day.", "author": "Arnold G."}

We were so proud of ourselves, because we resisted them all. We wanted an inexpensive dinner, and neither of us make enough to consider $40 \"inexpensive.\"\n\nAnd so we settled on Delica, a sleek Japanese deli.

I know it's supposed to mean that plans often go astray, but truly, do mice actually plan anything?  I thought they just....you know....do....to keep alive.  If that constitutes a plan then those magic 8-balls must be time machines.  Anyway, I digress (and talk of mice and restaurants usually don't go good together).\n\nThe point of all this is that after planning a City excursion with a stop at the Ferry building, we wanted to go stop by Hog Island and decimate another batch of helpless little oysters (and grab some chowder and clams along the side).  Since the Ferry building is so full of good places to eat, we decide to spread the love first and go to Delica for a quick pre-oyster orgy snack.\n\nSomething musta happened on this Easter Sunday cause the food was more than a little inconsistent, and on occasion, just plain bad.\n\nPlan 1:  Don't serve any tempura dish as a deli-style a la carte item.  It's deep fried with a batter that doesn't hold up to storage in the cold or the heat.  You need to fry those suckers and serve immediately.  Fault us for ordering this dish.  Skip the Kakiage unless they've just made them.\n\nPlan 2:  Don't add the aforementioned Kakiage to the hot soba udon noodle dish.  You take an otherwise good noodle dish and torture it with the Kakiage.  I'm not a huge fan of soba noodles in hot udon broth, though.  These noodles don't seem to hold up to broth as well as other types of noodles.  Either way, the dish would have been better with a minimalist approach.\n\nPlan 3:  Croquettes are, again, better left as a made to order item.  Fried dishes in general benefit from serving just-made.  Ever seen hot oil coagulate in a fry pan.  Well picture that in your fried items as it sits in a deli window.  The crab cream croquettes are decent enough flavor-wise, but just don't cut it as a deli item.\n\nPlan 4:  Chicken dumplings in sweet & spicy chili sauce.  This one works,  Being a dumpling dish (i.e., no frying), this seems to hold up well to storage.  The sauce is not all that spicy, but has enough kick to do the job.\n\nPlan 5: Roast beef sushi.  Okay, the thing is pretty to look at, but anything beefy and 1/2 raw, kept in storage in a fridge is bound to be inconsistent (\"Salmon...meet Nella\").  The first one was very good.  The second one had a gamey aftertaste.  Ewwww....should've known better.\n\nPlan 6:  Tonkatsu.  Okay, so this came right out of the fryer, and it makes all the difference.  Tender, tasty, crisp on the outside.  This is how items like this should be made.  Excellent.\n\nPlan 7:  Salmon and sesame genmai rice ball.  Okay, not bad.  Still cold, it doesn't make must sense.  In Korea, noo loong gi is awesome (the deep fried rice that is usually formed on the bottom of the rice cooker when you make rice).  Once it cools down, it get's hard and sometimes inedible.  This wasn't as bad, but a lot of the fun of have fried rice balls is lost in the deli context.  Hmmmm...puzzling.\n\nPlan 8:  After this disappointment, head on down to Hog Island.  I purposely skip finishing a lot of the stuff at Delica to save my stomach for the oyster carnage.  Run on over to Hog Island.....just as they put a \"Closed\" sign in my face.  Easter.\n\nHOLY SSSSSH........., okay, I won't say it on this day.\n\nHate mice.", "author": "James K."}

Piping hot, with a fried Kariyage (don't think i remembered the name correctly, but basically a giant tempura mixture of veggies & shrimp, typicallly $4 each) boxed separately (i requested it boxed separately so it doesn't soggify in the soup).  The soba noodle is tender and cooked to perfection, and the broth is gery good, not too salty, and not too sweet.\nBento Box:  ~$10.  2 sides plus the Shrimp Cake.  I highly recommend the Asparagus salad & the Burdock & Lotus Root w/Konnyaku salad.  Asparagus salad is creamy and light, and the Burdock salad is really flavorful and well put together.  The Shrimp Cake is crispy, filled with good amount of shrimp, and not soggy.  It is a perfect combination, and great portion.\n\nThe only complaint i have (not really a complaint, but i will say it anyway), is that it is a bit pricey.  But then again, everything in the Ferry Building is a bit overpriced.", "author": "Laura C."}

I had never been to the Ferry Building before then and I was pleasantly surprised at the variety. You can get informal sit-down eats to upscale haute dining by the sea in this building and yes, it could be premeditated but I rather like this particular restaurant.  \n\nI would classify it as: easily accessible haute cuisine. \n\nI got the Lunch Dish #4, which consisted of one salad, rice and a main course type food but in a smaller serving. The Mabo Tofu Salad is great (esp. because I'm a huge fan of mabo tofu) and the ginger is tangy but not too overpowering. The rice is piping hot, sprinkled with black sesame seeds and as for the main dish, I've had both the potato croquettes and the sweet and spicy chicken. \n\nNow, I've lived in Mexico for 13 years and I can tell you that if I were a Mexican (and for all practical purposes, I am), that the bottle of Valentina Hot Sauce was sneaking out of one pocket, looking for its way to the so-called spicy chicken. Perhaps for others, it would be spicy. I can't at all agree.  \n\nIn spite of all this though, if you consider the savoriness of the dish along with the view of the chilly bay, I'd say any amount you pay is well worth the trip. \n\nFood is very linked the different experiences of life, throughout, as I have learned in Mexico, where you can pig out on tacos de guisado (which can range from pork rinds to chicken tinga) at a Sweet 15 or recover from a hang over with menudo. \n\nDelica, for me, is comforting, kind of modern and familiar at the same time. It's a place I'd come back to when I want to remember what it's like to stop and smell the roses and to remember that life is not about a job or a salary but about a destination and the journey.", "author": "Fumiko N."}

I wanted a light lunch without spending too much money (preferably under $8), but that's just about an impossibility in the Ferry Building.  I had heard about Delica rf-1- kinda hard to forget a name like that so that was my first stop.  I browsed through their selection first before deciding on what I should get- a potato croquette, a piece of tonkatsu, and a roast beef sushi.\n\nThe potato croquette and the tonkatsu were very good- the panko breading was very crisp and not oily at all.  They were very good examples of what deep-fried foods should be.  The potato croquette was flavored with caramelized onions, which added sweetness and depth to an otherwise plain piece of mashed potato.  I really wish that I had asked for some ketchup- I think that would have made the croquette tastier.  As for the tonkatsu, the pork was tender and came with a tasty squirt of tonkatsu sauce.  I could have eaten a few more pieces of that with some steamed rice and called it a day.  The roast beef sushi, which was a last-minute addition to my order, was the big disappointment.  While the roast beef was tasty and the sushi rice was all that it should be, I just wasn't wowed by it the way some other Yelpers have been.  \n\n3.5 stars rounded up to 4 because it is one of the less expensive lunches you can get at the Ferry Building and because I was impressed by their deep-fried foods.  I would be back to try some of their bento boxes as well as their other croquettes and the ahi tuna salad, which looked delicious.", "author": "Angela H."}

I got the 5 item custom bento box for $9.50, which included a green bean wasabi salad, a seaweed edamame salad, a renkon salad (I think the english word is lotus root), chinese chicken salad and a chicken dumpling.  Yes, I did make sure to memorize what I got so I could give a thorough play by play.\n\nThe renkon salad was the standout of the meal. I could eat a whole meal of just that or the seaweed edamame salad, which mixed subtle flavors, interesting textures, etc. I prefer more cabbage in my chinese chicken salad (this was just a couple pieces of overdone chicken with carrots and celery... which was tasty but not worth it).  The green beans were surprisingly good yet the chicken dumpling was lackluster. Like a little lump of mashed chicken, tofu and water chestnuts with a too sweet sauce on the top. Again, not my favorite.\n\nHowever, I now know what to order next time--the salads are great. I give them an extra star for great customer service and alerting me that they can replace the potato salad that normally comes with a bento box for a different salad (because I just don't eat mayonaise... period). No real ambiance to the place, just a cold sterile steel environment in the ferry building...but the food is decent and well proportioned...just the right amount but not worth $10 in my opinion. \n\nI may go back, and I may bump them up a star if their croquette beats my Obachan's... but that is highly doubtful.", "author": "Stephanie H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-02-16", "description": "Delica RF-1 is one of my staple favorite restaurants...\n\nAll of the fried food choices are fantastic.  They generally fry a batch and then serve from a plate as people order.  If you are lucky enough to get a freshly fried batch, you are in for a treat.  My faves are the tonkatsu (tonkatsu sauce is perfect, the meat is alway tender, I've never bit into any gristle or fat) and the croquette (yum!).  The kakiage tempura is probably my least favorite, tempura is never good when it sits around.\n\nThe tofu steaks are pretty damn good, if I do say so myself.  I've always looked at them in the case thinking, those look nasty!  But one day I tried the one with miso/mushroom topping and it was hella good!  Sometimes they do this agedashi style, which is just as good.\n\nThe japanese curries are decent, I like the ground beef and mushroom the best, although they are kinda chintzy on the rice.  Definitely hits the spot when it's cold and rainy.\n\nThe only thing I don't like from this joint is the okonomi yaki which I thought was sub-par.  Probably has something to do with the fact that they are pre-made and sitting there on the griddle all day until an unlucky chump orders one.\n\nRounding out their menu offerings, Delica RF-1 has a large variety of interesting salads, my faves are the green beans+sesame dressing and hijiki+soybean salads.  I like to order a bucket and eat it thru the week.\n\nNote: They will sell the fried items by the piece and the salads by weight, but you can also order combo plates and bento boxes with your choice of entree (fried item, tofu steak, etc) and various salads which you can mix and match to your heart's content, great for lunch.\n\nOne time I walked by eating a cheese sandwich from Acme, the Japanese owner told me that my sandwich was not healthy and proceeded to give me a sample of his carrot soup.

Somehow I had never eaten here! Delica looked like a fabulous option - clean and pretty in a minimalist way. We hadn't eaten Japanese food in a while, plus never Japanese deli food, specifically, so that was kind of exciting as well. Looking - belatedly! - at other reviews now, perhaps it is because we grabbed the pre-made bento boxes rather than ordering a la carte items  that we were not nearly as satisfied as other reviewers? I honestly have no idea.\n\nWe both got the vegetarian bento - which is actually also vegan as far as I can tell, even though it is labeled \"vegetarian\" - which came with hijiki and soybean salad, spicy burdock root salad, agedashi tofu steak and rice with black sesame seeds. The rice was the best part, which I think is a little bizarre. I mean \n\n1) I like good rice and \n2) bad rice can certainly ruin a meal, but \n3) I don't know that rice should be the best part of any meal. \n\nSo. The rice was the best part, but not amazingly great, zowie-powie, rock 'em-sock 'em rice. There was no subtlety to the other dishes, and no medley or mixture of flavor - everything was weirdly, overwhelmingly sweet, and the tofu wasn't fresh at all. All that for $10 - each! - makes me a little sad.\n\nI had started this review with two stars but had to take it down to one because I just can't even.

The best word to describe this sandwich, other than delicious, is balanced.  Though fried crispy, the savory cutlet - the star -isn't greasy and is complimented perfectly by just the right amount of sweet and tangy sauce, crunchy cabbage, and soft, sweet white bread.

Now with corn, a wonderful addition, however I do miss the old version from time to time.  Hopefully they bring it back in the winter.  We shall see.  \n\nBeef curry is also sublime.  It depends who serves though.  I heard them training one day, and they stated the regular size is to have ONLY 3 pieces of meat, and however much sauce, potatoes and carrots that seem reasonable.  3 pieces of meat!  What a bummer.  Today I had the beef curry and I must've had at least 6 pieces of meat.  Tender, juicy, and full of flavor.  Thank goodness for the indiscretion of the server today, because beef curry ought to have plenty of beef... but maybe that's just me.  \n\nAnyhoo, you can find me there at least a couple times a month, if not more, much more.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-29", "description": "Welcome to de-pa-chi-ka!: \"depachika\" refers to the food section of department stores in Japan. Department stores in Japan generally have their food section at the basement level (\"chika\" means underground/basement). Hence depa (short for \"department store\") + chika. A depachika generally has, among other things, stores that sell \"osouzai\", variety of small pre-made dishes ready to eat that you can buy by piece or by weight. \n\nLong story short, Delica rf-1 is exactly like popular depachika osozai stores in Japan. And I highly value its existance within short walking distance from my office. Their pre-pakcaged $10 lunch box , for example, gives you a couple of relatively healthy (some stuff my mom made me eat because they are good for you, like hijiki sea weekd salad) side dish type stuff and deep-fried goodies, like tonkatsu.  Here, variety is key. Neither depachika-osouzai food or Delica rf-1 food is meant to be super high quality gourmet food per se; it is more like comfort food that mimics your mom's cooking in an upscale-fast-foodish kind of way. \n\nAdmittedly, one extra star was given because of my nostalgia.

After a very disappointing dinner the night before at Drunken Sushi on Clement Street, I was looking forward to having my faith restored in San Franciscan Japanese food restored.  I didn't know it was going to come so soon.\n\nWe ordered several dishes, the most memorable were the lamb curry, the seared tuna salad, and the potato croquette.  The lamb curry was interesting, it actually tasted more like Indian curry than japanese, and they actually give you more curry and lamb than rice.  The seared tuna salad was amazing.  While it wasn't that big, the four slices of tuna were very fresh, and the texture was perfect.  Coupled with avocado and crispy lotus root croutons, the salad was both savory and refreshing.\n\nThe one dish I wasn't too crazy about was the kakigage tempura.

We usually go out to the communal tables between Delica and the neighboring Mexican food restaurant and eat there.\nThey (along with most places in the Ferry Building) closes really early.  I mean WTF? early.  You'd think they can rake in more sales if they opened late enough for the commuters to come grab dinner before they get on the ferries.\nThey had a price increase as of Feb 2009... due to the economy.  Ordering two regular curry rice, 1 shrimp cake, 2 pieces of chicken and 2 drinks tallied up over $30 bucks with tip.  For take out??? errrrhmmm yeah~~ that's a bit much.\n\nWould I come here often?

Having sampled it, it's reasonably close, but doesn't have the richness I came to expect when I was in Japan.  Also, it's really oily.\r\nThe salads are quite tasty, and they've got some nice lunch specials allowing for a selection of salads and hot dishes, ranging from $6-10.\r\nThe croquettes are reasonably tasty, and the breading light and crisp as it ought to be, but not of quite the consistency I remember from Japan (a little too chunky I think) and the flavor seemed not quite right.

It's a healthy creative japanese deli disguised as a pricey ferry building soup and salad lunch place...you'll walk in and be surprised at what it actually is and how well priced the lunches are!

The rice paper really did it for me because it actually made me feel good after finishing all 6 pieces.  The roll was very fresh and lite.  For $8, kinda pricey, but I think it was worth it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-10-08", "description": "FERRY PLAZA FRUGAL:  Lunch curry specials rock the house and always a vegetarian option, usually under $10.  SO crazy good was the eggplant curry with GROUND CHICKEN ($7.75), I felt like I was rising out of my chair.  And, you can certainly make a meal out of their little fried goodies.  At 2.75-3.75 a piece it seems dear until you get that first bite of panko goodness.  Add in 1/2 pinto of edamame or green bean salad with miso dressing and a pro bono view of the bay and you're stylin'.\n\n\nPeople!  It's all about the PANKO!  (those yum-licious breadcrumbs that fry ever so delicately to encase delica's fried specialties: potato and mushroom croquettes, shrimp cake, tonkatsu, et al).  \n\nThe panko-fried items get 5 stars, but the unfortunate (fast japanese food hazard) BLANDNESS of some items like sweet-n-sour chicken (chunks of orangey chicken, had it today), hijiki and soybean salad (not sea-salty enough-- this is seaweed, isn't it??) and glazed chicken meatballs (apparently, the glaze is COSMETIC) brings this super-sanitary and well-run by happy-shiny-counterpeople upscale deli down to 4 stars.  \n\nHowever, 4 stars is by no means bad in my book-- MAKING it worth the jacked-up ferry plaza prices ($9.50 for bento, approx $3.75 for panko-fried items).  \n\nNotable items (aside from the amazing FRIED MENU) include:  Chinese Chicken Salad, made with the delica touch:  julienne veggies and chicken, the best use of baby celery I've ever tasted and DEAD-ON chinese chicken salad vinaigrette without all of the fuss of an americanized chinese chix salad.  \n\nAlso, wasabi, garlic and edamame potato salad:  who the hell thought of this?  It's crazy good.  Half-mashed wasabi-garlic potatoes, whole fresh edamame beans in a cold potato salad-- great intimate picnic food.  \n\nAnd, another one of my personal favs, the roast beef nigiri, just like it sounds, thinly sliced rare roast beef atop a finger of japanese sushi rice (the rice it pretty decent, not gross or cheap or sticky), maybe some scallion garnish.  \n\nThey also have other sushi, some wrapped in rice paper rather than seaweed, that I have yet to try...\n\nThose bento boxes (various items, always a healthy, square meal) sure are handy for buying to-go and finding a people watching or bayview perch in the back of the ferry plaza or the nearby Embarcadero.  \n\nAlso, Japanese style cooking and dining is engineered to be 'systematically beautiful' and therefore a non-messy, organized and tranquililty-inducing eating experience (think Zen...) which explains why some items lack the flavor kick. (Gloppy, sloppy sweet and sour sauce? No way, sensai!).  \n\nThis Japanese tradition of food presentaion carried out at Delica also explains the CALM I feel even when I'm CHOWING on one of their panko-fried mushroom croquettes and dipping them in the delicate tomato or herbed mayo sauces-- with chopsticks!\n\nCan't beat the bayview location, friendly staff (and very cute asian guys).

So I guess I had pre-dinner (a late merienda?) at Delica. Normally I just eat lunch here and it's fine, albeit kind of expensive. My only experience with their evening menu (prior to my late snack that I am now describing) was being told it was too early to order from. \n\nI get to Delica at 6:00 and try to order dinner from the counter, which is how it works there at lunch. Apparently it's sit-down for dinner, ie there are waitresses. Ok fine, I go sit down at a spindly table (imagine the tallest bench you've ever seen) on my spindly chair and a very nice pair of servers come over to give me the (evening) menu and go over happy hour specials. I (still) appreciate that there are clearly labeled vegan items, which there are at least three of for dinner -- avocado roll, cucumber roll and fried tofu. I order edamame ($3) and an avocado roll ($5). Now, I like avocado rolls. I like them a lot. But $5 for six pieces of vegetarian sushi made me think, \"a five dollar avocado roll had better be pretty damn delicious\" and guess what? It was. Which makes me feel weird, because I don't want to feel ok about spending $5 on an avocado roll but I kind of do because it was actually really, really good. So while it was the first $5 avocado roll I've purchased and eaten, it was one of the better avocado rolls that I've ever had.\n\nAwkward: The hostess and waitresses seem like they're constantly telling people who come in that they may only sit down if they order off of the dinner menu (I guess as opposed to ordering the deli stuff from the counter?), which is not the friendliest way to greet people or introduce them to dinner service/offerings at Delica.", "author": "M M."}

However, if you're looking for a quick line, I suggest having cash at hand to fork it over to the guy in the front of the store passing out bento boxes.\n\nThe relatively long wait during the lunch hours are worth it as the Roast Beef Sushi is excellent in presentation and taste.  Many people have the misconception that sushi has to be fish, which they would be promptly corrected.  Sushi, literally translated, just means rice vinegar--denoting that if you put it on top of rice, it's sushi. But I digress.\n\nI always enjoy getting the Number 4 combo at the Deli which includes one Hot Item, Rice and one Salad.  With a wide variety of vegetarian items, the Chinese Chicken Salad, Wasabi Garlic Potato Salad, and Spicy Burdock Root Salad are good choices.  However, I would love to try the Corn and Mascarpone Salad.\n\nAs far as the curry and fried items, the beef curry wasn't anything too special, as I could easily attain this from any other place in Japantown.  Also, the Kakiage Tempura was what seemed like a \"hot mess\" as it is filled with pretty much anything in my fridge currently, but not much can be said about things that people say are \"authentic\" to Japanese cuisine.\n\nThe food here, though, is fairly cheap, fairly tasty, and of good quality for the Ferry Building, and because of it, I continue to come back, as most other places in and around Market charge you an arm and a leg for good food.", "author": "Renee Y."}

This is the least Japanese element of the place. Things in Japan are efficient, and Delica is anything but. People from Japan would be laughing hysterically at how inefficient the service is here. Since they charge per piece for things, they have count each one by one. It's tedious.\n\nPutting that behind, the food here is actually really tasty. The roast beef sushi tastes as yummy as it sounds. My favorite was the potato croquette. I don't know how they make them so crunchy! My only complaint is that mine weren't very warm and I had to ask twice for the tonkatsu sauce, which they should have given to me automatically. I mean, come on...how do you serve it without the sauce?\n\nIt is pricey, considering a lot of these are deli/convenient store type of foods that you can get dirt cheap anywhere else.

He chose rice, seaweed salad, mushroom salad and a crab and cheese croquette. My friend got the same seaweed salad, I think a lotus root salad and the tofu steak. We saw some people eating tempura; it looked delicious, so we went back and got some of that, too.\n\nWith the exception of the tempura (it looked a lot yummier than it actually was.), the food was all quite tasty. I got the feeling it was pretty healthy, too. But, that was just a feeling. What do I know? Not much, that's for sure! Also, it was filling. And, that's pretty important to a girl like me!\n\nI noticed that some people complained in their reviews that the food at Delica-rf1 is expensive.

So, really, instead of reading this review, I think you ought to read Roland Barthes's \"Empire of Signs\"--his excellent mini-book about his trip to Japan--especially the chapter on Japanese food.  He can talk about signs and signifier/signified mumbo jumbo better than I, in a poetic, poignant writing style to boot.  This place really makes me think of all that crap I had to read and spew out in 20 page term papers.\n\nDelica bills itself as a sohzai/okazu-ya, a prepared food deli selling hot and cold Japanese dishes.  There are about 4-5 salad selections (my faves:  hijiki salad and green bean/sesame salad) and 4-5 fried food selections you can get individually or in a multi-item bento box.  Also, they have items like curry and soba that don't quite fall in the \"sohzai\" category.  The cold dishes are healthy and are pretty much vegetarian.  The hot dishes are fried and meaty (I haven't tried the potato croquet, but traditionally those have ground meat in them so if you're veg, ask first.).  I think the food is pretty tasty, but definitely not make-a-special-trip-to-Ferry-Building or call-my-Mom-and-tell-her-I-found-a-replacement-cook good.  I also have a beef (and not delicious rare beef sushi) with the fact that they count rice as an \"item\" in the bento.  Apparently, one of Delica's twists on Japanese is not getting the math right.  That's like a BBQ joint saying a three-way is chicken, ribs, and bread.  Or Panda Express telling you that a two-item plate is orange chicken and rice.  In Japan, rice ain't an \"item.\"  It's a blank, if you will, to cleanse palates, catch dripping sauces, and dilute strongly flavored foods.\n\nI think what makes me feel really \"whatever\" about this place is that it's wishy washy in whether it wants to be a haute fusion fast food joint or to be as true-to-form sohzai-ya as one can be in the Ferry Building.  I would embrace either extreme in its fully fledged form, but for now, I wonder why a kakiage (bits-n-pieces tempura) is cylindrical instead of flat and round.  Or why they put daizu (mature soy beans) AND edamame (young soy beans) in the hijiki salad.  Meaning, the twist they put on the original version doesn't elicit an \"aha!\" reaction, in that it's not functional to the actual flavor.  If they're gonna be half-assed about coming up with their own version of Japanese classics, why not go authentic and show everyone a new facet of the cuisine that's not sushi or ramen or teppan-yaki?\n\nSo yes, it's annoying that I am not really critiquing the food or the service, but the concept of the restaurant.  But what can I do?  I gotta do something with my college education.", "author": "maiko h."}

The food is worth five stars. \n\nThat being said, I found it INCREDIBLY irritating to come in during a busy lunch rush-hour and not have a CLUE which of the three lines I needed to stand in. As I waited in line about 30 minutes, I concluded that the right-most line is for \"hot lunches\". The middle line is just to pay for things, and the LEFT line is for \"cold lunches\". If you by chance wait in the wrong line, only to find they have what you wanted pre-packaged, they will not even humor you by scooping your 1/2pint fresh from the deli case-- they go and reach around the counter and pick up one in the self-serve case and hand it to you. Well, if I could've actually seen how this procedure should've gone, or (and, imagine this) if they'd have had the lines MARKED, I could've done just fine with the self-serve and the \"Pay only\" line in the middle. Assuming I could've transversed the ten thousand people between the two. In fact, I think I'd have had to walk out the door (THIEF!) and then come back in the OTHER door in order to do that. \n\nThe employees were curt and I don't like that they have a sign warning a credit card minimum as it goes against their merchant agreement with Visa/MC.

And it is this reason that it remains a wonder why there aren't more Japanese restaurants offering more variety, or making it a staple on their menus. That is, instead of offering various sushi rolls, that you do not find very often. I'm quite aware that Onigiris are found in convenience stores and as such I should find them in the Japanese markets, etc... but still it leaves me to wonder.\n\nSo with Eto En green tea, a cup of Miso soup, Hijiki and Salmon flavored Onigiris in hand, I was ready to take my first bite. I had the Hijiki to start, and expected something fabulous, something magnificent, and to my disappointment didn't quite get that or well something that awful. I wasn't sure what to make of the rice ball. It was mild to taste, and not as flavorful as I would have liked it. I had relatively more tamed Onigiris in Japan, because I was afraid to make the dive into the more tasty varieties, but this takes that to a whole new level. I figured it was just that particular one, and went onto my Salmon ball. I still distinctly remember my last few bites of my Japanese fare, and expected nothing less here. Again, disappointed. Unlike the Japanese variety, the salmon is mixed with the rice, and so bits and pieces are scattered, you see it, and you can make out the taste of it, but it didn't affect the overall quality. \n\nI'm going to be making a couple more rounds of Onigiri tastings at various other restaurants in Oakland and SF in the next couple of days, by this time Sunday, I will have a better grasp on what to expect of the American fare. \n\nOh, and the miso was something quite forgettable.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-13", "description": "Located in the Ferry Building, Delica rf-1 is a rare Japanese find with healthy alternatives! I came on a Saturday afternoon, and this place was continuously packed. At first I was quite flustered since the place was crowded and there were two lines that seemed to have different purposes, but with a little help with some of the customers, we figured out the right line was for taking ready to go meals or to order to be made items like curry, and the left line was the line to pick and choose which pre-cooked items behind the glass you wanted. \n\nWe went with the sushi roll, beef curry, tofu steak with miso sauce, spicy burdock root salad and wasabi garlic potato salad. My favorites were the tofu steak and potato salad. The miso sauce atop the tofu steak totally made the dish. It was perfectly flavored and not too salty. Put with the tofu, it became very refreshing and light. I was wary at first to try the potato salad since it had wasabi, but boy was I glad to have given it a try! There was only the slightest bit of wasabi flavor! The potato salad was drowned with mayo like other restaurants mistakenly do, instead it was lightly coated. The curry was pretty average. It was perfectly cooked not. too thick and not too watery, which is another rare find. The sushi was quite interesting in that instead of a seaweed wrapper they used soy wraps. There was barely any rice, but more lettuce. You could almost say it's what happens when Japanese sushi meets Vietnamese spring rolls. The sashimi that was placed on top wasn't very fresh, but otherwise the sushi was what you'd expect if it's been refrigerated and made into a take-out item.\n\nThe main reason why I love Delica is because their food is always light and you don't feel the slightest bit sluggish after eating their food.  The only minor problem with eating here and anywhere else in the Ferry building for that matter is because there's a lot of people/tourists making it  always hard to find places to sit. Delica has a few tables of their own, but they're always already taken. If you are able to find a seat, there's a superb view of the bay.", "author": "Gloria C."}

There were plenty of options but with a name like Delica rf-1, it's pretty unique and stirred the memory senses of my yelp browsing from yester years. I was a little overwhelmed by the know-how of the regulars and where to stand to order what and such so I took a second to get a lay of the land, perused the deli counter and the bento boxes and decided a sampler plate would be best. I scooped up a bento with a creamy crab croquette, white rice, asparagus salad with a sesame dressing and hijiki and soybean salad. I then went to the counter to custom create a lunch plate #1 with a choice of one entree and two salads.  I picked the tofu and chicken hijiki patty, mushroom salad and a wonderfully aromatic and zesty burdock and lotus root salad. Everything was perfectly prepared, not over-dressed and the proportions were nice. The flavors were especially clean and most had a light \"tang\" that was a nice contract to the rice and fried croquette. With a bottle of green tea, my total came to just over $22. I recommend getting the lunch plates or bento boxes because some of the salads were costly, upwards of $15.00 a lb. and since they are dressed, the ounces can add up.  My favorites were the hijiki salad and tofu and chicken hijiki patty - didn't really care for the creamy texture to the croquette but of course I ate it anyway.

I like the lamb curry quite a bit.  It's great in cold weather - very hearty.   The fried shrimp cake totally rocks.  It's basically a crab cake made with rock and gulf shrimp instead.  And it has very little filler - just shrimpy goodness.  The crab croquette is mighty tasty too.  I like the Bechamel sauce that's blended with the crab meat.  The roast beef sushi sounds weird, but it's actually quite good... along the lines of a tartar.  The chicken dumpling with sweet chili sauce is also a good choice.  I usually will opt for a curry and another smaller item, but it'd be easy to make a meal out of the smaller items.", "author": "Saw T."}

All their sit down spots were packed as we went during lunch hour so we thought to just get some \"to-go\" food and eat it outside and enjoy the beautiful scenery.  When we got there, I didn't realize there were 2 separate lines - one for bento and one for plated dishes.  So I picked up one of the bento boxes on the table which had 3 or 4 pieces of sweet and spicy chicken, hijiki and soybean salad, and mushroom salad.  My fiance, on the other hand is quite picky and doesn't really eat too many veggies so he passed on the bento boxes and decided to order fried items by pieces: katsu and sweet and spicy chicken.  I do wish they had more items, not so much for me, but for my fiance and for anyone who is somewhat picky.  But as for my meal and me being not so picky, I really enjoyed the hijiki salad and the sweet and spicy chicken.  The salads were really fresh and had bold flavor.  I also ordered 1 piece of the chicken dumpling which I thought was yummy.  This place would be great for little snacks  to pick up or if you want some flavorful salads and the salads were healthy and fresh to offset the deep fried goodies.

I also got a hot japanese tea, which comes in a starbucks style mug, and all together it was $10 something. The thing was, it looked like the hot food/deli counter at wholefoods. You can even find the same sort of foods there. Only at wholefoods, they have more seats and tables. Delica had a counter with some chairs, but not many, and they were full. All the seats around the place were full, but we walked down over to the dock and found a bench there. The food was good.  The patty looked like it would be hot so I kept blowing on it by accident. Of course it was cold, since it had been sitting on a deli plate with the others. All 3 of us liked our food. It filled me up at the time, but less than 2 hrs later, and im really hungry.

Last Wednesday, I went to the Ferry Bldg. after work in search of take out food.  I was not expecting to get anyything from Delica because it was never an option at this time of the day (around 5:45pm) in my previous food hunts there.  This time, however, their doors were wide open and customers were still coming and going.  Overjoyed, I got in line and ordered their 3 salad combo.  I chose their green beans, tofu and potato salad.  While everything taste great individually, combined in one container with nothing to neutralize the intensity of each, the sum total became a bit overwhelming and I regretted not orderig a side of rice for that purpose.  I was also somewhat put off by the crunchy rawness of the potato slices used on their potato salad.  But I finished the whole thing anyway, ready to return with a modifed food order plan next time.", "author": "Yvette F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-29", "description": "my go-to spot at the ferry building - can't find another place like this! delica combines japanese simplicity and ingredients with a slight californian flavor.   never have to wait too long, especially when i go on weekends and every other place is bombarded by tourists.   my usual order is the 3 salads combo plus a salmon rice ball.  i'm always very satisfied after. my husband isn't a fan of salads for lunch so he'll get the curry rice - which is also very good. my favorite salads are the mapo tofu salad (yummy - the flavors!), the wasabi potato (always hits the spot - potatoes, romaine, edamame with a good balanced wasabi flavor), the hijiki salad (because it appears to be really healthy and good for you with the seaweed, soybeans and goji berries), the eggplant salad and the green bean salad with a sesame sauce. I also really like the chicken and tofu patty and the chicken dumpling. i've never really tried their soups, fried items so can't comment on those. i definitely would recommend the deli items over the sushi though.", "author": "Eleanor C."}

Delica is a good blend of traditional Japanese and California style.  The sushi is very fresh and you do pay but it is not unreasonable if you really enjoy for what is being served to you.  Watch the sushi chef and he will check to see if you enjoy. I would recommend the toro - very good.  I am from Japan and really appreciate the quality of the sushi there.  Steamed clams are very nice.  I know it's not Sushi Midori in Ginza, but it is good  good sushi.", "author": "duffy m."}

I just wanted to shove something in my stomach before I got after work drinks and then I realized, YES! Delica is a a short walk away. I'm a fan of the fried products and I usually end up forgetting about the left side of the counter. I ordered the potato croquettes, the chicken dumplings, the shrimp cake and the pork ton-katsu. At $3.50 I really don't think the shrimp cake is worth it, although it is very meaty  with no filler. I don't know. The potato croquette treats me just as well and is two bucks cheaper. At the higher  price I'd prefer a double cheese burger from McDonald's for a dollar. The pork ton-katsu was very good, as always, although I still wish they didn't put the sauce on already. They should really have a bottle on the side. Despite all my complaints it's all still very good and reminds me of the food my mom from Osaka made while I was growing up. If they started serving Okonomomiyaki and cleaned up a few minor problems they might go up to five stars. For those of you not it the know omo... is a Japanese pancake made out of fish broth, flour, pork and cabbage. It's hard to find as it's a more home cooked thing than a restaurant thing, sorta akin to a sloppy joe. You grow up eating it but you don't really find it in a restaurant.", "author": "Steve Q."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-03-31", "description": "I had mixed feelings after eating at Delica several times.  Each time I've ordered soup (to go) they leave more than an inch of the container empty - that was my first dislike.  The flavor of the food is generally greasier than I like - many of the items are fried and even some of the ones that are not contain a filmy oil.  When asked what type of oil they use in their cooking no one seemed to know.  The potatoe salad is barely cooked which is very dissappointing.  The seaweed salad left much to be desired - not much flavor.  The chicken dumplings - again disappointing.  Their sushi is just mediocre.    This is not my favorite Japanese take out.", "author": "Hope O."}

Pretty great place to have an unexpected hour to kill if I do say so myself. We wandered around until we found this spot which neither of us had ever tried. Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomaches as we ordered about 1 of everything,  for each of us! I really liked their soba noodle soup. The tempura shrimp thing in it was so-so. The chicken dumplings were delish with a really nice sauce on the outside. Miguel got a few different rolls, I loved their spring roll with shrimp, had a really nice sauce in it. He  also got the sweet sour chicken, which wasnt that great, but would have been better if it were served hot instead of cold like they do. The shrimp cakes were awesome. If I go back I will probably order those with rice and their really tasty mashed potatoes, garlic, wasabi and edamame. Yum. Great lunch spot - although it ended up being about $50 for lunch, but we got a ton of food so you could do it at a normal price too and still leave full.", "author": "Audrey V."}

I went here for lunch over the weekend and had the chinese chicken salad, wasabi potato salad, and sesame green beans.  Lunch for under $8 at the Ferry Building on a weekend is not too bad in my book.  Plus they jam-packed the plate, so by the end of the meal I was totally stuffed.  -1/2 star for the confusing line setup (custom bento + lunch plates to the left, everything else to the right?  I'm still not sure...) but this rounds up to 5 stars.", "author": "Vicki M."}

They have lots of vegetarian and vegan options and their wasabi potato salad is bomb, however, my fondness of this place came to an abrupt end when I became violently ill after dining there one sunny afternoon.  I'll forever remember the episode as the worst food poisoning of my life.  I kid you not, I yaked about 12 times, from the evening to the early dawn.  I thought I'd have to be hospitalized, but I survived.  Thank.  God.  Was it the asparagus salad that made me oh so ill?...hmm...i don't think so.  Or was it the miso tofu beef thingy?...possibly...or was it the mushroom salad?...yes, i think that was the culprit.  Anyway, this experience traumatized me.  Unfortunately, I have to walk by this place to get my morning cup of brew at Peet's and just the smell of the food makes my stomach curl.  Delica, you let me down, so I must give you a lousy two stars because your food POISONED ME.  And because of you I won't be able to eat asparagus, tofu, or mushrooms for a very long time.  Oh, and I missed the Serj Tankien concert at the Warfield cuz of you.  Jerks.  Folks, beware the mushroom salad.", "author": "Jennifer S."}

Crab crokettes are crispy with a mouthwatering crab meat filling.  Fried shrimp cakes are also crispy on the outside with succulent shrimp inside.  Salmon and sesame brown rice rolls are firm with earthy, nutty brown rice and sesame seeds and fresh, tender salmon.  You get your choice of tarter or tomato sauce which are both excellent.  The soba noodle soup is excellent with fish, shrimp tempura, edumumi, and vegetables with firm, aldentae soba noodles in a sweet and salty miso broth.  For excellent Asian fusion, Delica cannot be beat.  The asparagus salad is fresh with tender stocks of asparagus, sesame seeds, and edema's.  Wusabi potato salad is excellent with fresh potatoes and a wusubi dressing that packs a one-two punch that will make you not want to eat traditional American or German potato salad again.  The romaine lettuce that comes with it is needless to say fresh and crisp.  I can hardly wait to go back and try the rest of their dishes.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}
