The place itself is a little dirty but for relatively cheap Salvadoran food I think it's fine. However, the food is now overpriced Salvadoran food and the place is still dirty.\n\nI'm especially disappointed by how they've recently changed the pricing on their pupusas. It's one thing to start at $5 for 1 pupusa that used to be $2.50, but the price doesn't make sense when you get to 3 pupusas ($12 with tax, $4 each) then 4 papusas ($18 with tax, $4.5 each now?).

The server/cashier was nice too. You get free chips when you check in but I wouldn't recommended the free chips because it's a little bit tasteless. Could have used more salt in it.

The rice is not your typical Spanish rice found in most taquerias and has a nice balanced subtle flavor with enough depth to make me want to eat a whole plate of rice. They use black beans for the refried beans which is delicious. On every table there is a plastic vessel of pickled cabbage with other veggies which is refreshing.

As for the highlight of the meal, all of the pupusas were amazing! We got two mixtas which contained cheese, beans, and pork. These were my favorite as the flavor was amazing and the cheese really rounded off the entire puppies. The other top highlights are the chorizo with cheese as well as the mushroom with cheese. I wasn't expecting these to be as good as they actually were. The squash flower and chipotle pupusas were good as well. Overall you can't seem to go wrong with whatever you order - though I'd really recommend the mixta one. I love how the curtido is served in a large bucket so you can really eat your fill.\n\nMy group of three es totally stuffed with these pupusas as they were really hefty and jam packed with filling.

I live super far but I came all the way to the Mission to eat here.\n\nI ordered the same thing I got at the other Panchita's - combo #1 with two pork pupusas, which comes with guac, sour cream, plantains, and beans. The plantains are TO DIE for, man. They're sweet but perfectly charred so kinda bitter in the best way. The guac and sour cream are pretty standard, I like to scoop them on top of the pupusas when I eat them. The pupusas OKAY HERE WE GO are AMAZING. There's literally just meat and cheese in there (if you order the pork like I did), but it tastes sooooooo good. I drown the boi in the salsa, and with the guac and sour cream, it's a dream come true. I'm not Salvadoran and didn't grow up eating pupusas so I'm not sure if i'm eating them correctly or not but it's pretty freaking good the way I ate them with everything (don't forget the free veggie things!) \n\nThe restaurant has a ton of seating and is super cute, with pretty murals on the wall. It's also a place you could eat alone (I saw a lot of people doing so) and not feel awkward, so I would definitely come alone if i'm ever in the area. The only thing was that the food isn't that fast (I think I waited 10-15 minutes) so I wouldnt come here if you're in a rush. Since I wasn't in a hurry it was perfectly fine and worth the wait because the pupusas again were just so dang nabbit good.

As someone who grew up eating these greasy, delicious bundles of heart disease this has been the worst Pupusa I have ever had... that's including my ill fated attempt of making a healthy version at home. The place is busy, which... good for them. I like to see my Paisonos do well but please oh please serve good food. \n\nExample: Anyone whose been around enough pupusas will tell you the Curtido is paramount in bringing the flavours (yes, with a 'U') to a wonderful crescendo blending the fat, meat, cheese and bite from the pickled fermented yumminess (also the only healthy part of the meal) into pure heart stopping heaven... What they served was some form of dry cabbage lacking any type of flavor. When I asked if they had more curtido in the back that was a little more \"Borracho\" (Drunk) the kid serving me had no idea what I was talking about. I clarified that the Curtido was a little dry, he offered to pour more water into the tub....\n\nWATER: Now, if you haven't gotten it by now I really like pupusa's and I don't yelp unless something is phenomenally good or bad... The fact that our server referred to the wonderful vinegar brine used to pickle and ferment curtido as water... well.. mind you I knew what to expect before I even had my first bite of PUPUSAS... \n\nTo those of you who have given this family owned business that has been around since before I was born 4 stars or above.. even 3 stars... I am glad you like it. I am happy that you supporting a local business but you have to try other places. Hop on the 14 and head west, unfortunately my favorite pupuseria is now a spaghetti shack otherwise I would make that recommendation. I can only believe this place is doing well because it is centrally located, I have had it twice now thinking it just might be one bad experience....  It only confirmed that they use thicker drier masa than they should.

As you can tell, I'm taking the break-up badly, so of course, Jamie W. and I went to Panchita's for a rebound pupusa. OK, that wasn't really our intention, but Panchita puts herself out there with her sidewalk grill luring young hipsters who have no concept of what a carb is.

All pupusas are $3 each which made ordering easy (photo:  http://bit.ly/Z7e9P3). But first we indulged ourselves with a $4.50 plate of Guacamole with Chips (photo: http://bit.ly/1uP7O8V). Decent though a rather paltry portion with just a handful of chips to keep us occupied until the pupusas arrived.

My boyfriend was craving pupusas and brought me to Panchita's on a Friday night at around 10pm. Luckily for us, there was parking right around the block, which is a rarity in the Mission.

Our orders came about 10-15 minutes later, so if you're in a hurry to get something quick, Panchita's might not be for you. The texture of the pupusa was fine, but the meat to cheese ratio was off for me. Unlike most people, I like my pupusas cheesy, so I was a tad bit disappointed to find that there was more meat than cheese.

I suggested Monk's Kettle (they make one of my fave burgers in the city).  However,  the wait was a hefty 1hr and 45min. (Yes the host said this with a straight face.)  So we headed straight to Panchita's to have a little \"amuse-bouche\".  Popusas it would be... as we have all decided unanimously.  What had transpired next was nothing less than \"amazeballs\" as a friend would say.  The popusas here are phenomenal. I mean the masa is soft, tasty, cooked perfect and the thickness is consistent.  The ingredients inside are fresh and the cheese savory fried.  The cabbage salad that comes with the Popusa along with the sauce is also very very good.  Just beware of the spicy sauce because it's got a little bite..\n\nI got the beef Popusa and the melted cheese inside it was super.  My friend got the Loroco and that was tasty, wife got the bean filled and that was great as well.  All in all it was so good we all had a bite of each other's Popusa (the technique is share two quarters and save the half for yourself).  When we got done we actually got a little full since the size of the popusas are substantial (or perhaps the cabbage salad contributed to the fullness of the meal).  \n\nSo getting to Monk's Kettle full and ordering the burger was not optimal for enjoyment anymore.

I don't remember tasting much mushroom but the garlic taste was definitely there. \n\n2.Chipotle - bleh. not a fan. Tasted like dough with cheese and hot sauce. Nothing special. \n\n3. Chicken - it was good. The chicken wasn't dry, which is always a concern of mine when I order chicken.  \n\n4. Beef - good as well. The beef was in a form of a thin patty, just like the chicken.", "author": "Michelle T."}

They close late and pupusas would be a great late night treat!\n\nOutside of the restaurant is where two ladies were making pupusas! A cart with all the ingredients is where one lady was making them and another cart with a grill where the other was cooking them. Talk about freshly made! I ordered the cheese pupusas. Omg! Sooo good! The tortilla was nice and thin and filled with lots of cheese! It was a perfect ratio. Right off the grill and just oozing with cheese. It had a wonderful velvety buttery taste in every bite. Top that with the vinegar based cabbage slaw and it was even more heavenly. \n\nI think I ate about 4. I probably could have eaten more but didn't have enough room in my belly! I just hate when something tastes so good and you don't want to stop eating it but are forced too, due to lack of space!

Definitely a hole in the wall and only about 3 blocks away from the BART station.\nI came on Friday for dinner and there was a never-ending line outside (not long at all though at 7-8 PM at least) and lots of seating inside. Not the cleanest or newest interior but that's not what you should expect when you come here anyway. It's clean enough is how I'll put it.\n\nI like how there's a grill outside, I'm guessing it's better ventilation for the cooks, but also helps lure people in. The only gripe about this is that the smoke goes INSIDE the restaurant so I kinda wish the grill was \"more outside\" but I'm guessing they can't do that for some kinda sidewalk regulation of some sort.\n\nOnto the food. GODDAMN IT'S CHEAP. We got 6 pupusas and a beer for $21 ish (before tax) and we were both HELLA stuffed. Pupusas are $2.50 each.\nI think my fav was probably the spinach one, I want to try the loroco one next time. They were all pretty good though and hits the spot for a cheap price. I like how you can actually taste the corn in the dough too.\n\nOverall, I think Estrellita's Snacks (at the Alemany Farmer's Market on Sat) makes better pupusas but this place is cheaper and more accessible on the daily.", "author": "Emily C."}

The crowd and lines started growing and people loved that they could watch them being made. Then, recently, they got a see-through display case that goes over the cart, which was fantastic because now all the people waiting for pupusas no longer have to smell like grease, and it keeps the heat in to help them cook faster! Now, this place is poppin every weekend night.\n\nAs a lactard, sadly, there are few options for me. One night after going out, La Cumbre ran out of Carne Asada, so I came here instead.

I had been sitting in traffic for 90 minutes at rush hour on a Friday, just trying to get from the east Oakland area back to my hotel in the city.  Crooss the bridge, moving slowly through the Mission District, and I look over my left shoulder and BAM! Panchita's pupuseria was screaming my name!  took me a while to circle and find a spot to park.\n\nOnce inside, I ordered a variety of pupusas to go, and turned some friends on to them. One look at the cheese and bean pupusa, and I saw the handiwork of someone who has amassed years of rolling.  I expected good taste to follow and it did.  I tried some with some ingredients I was unfamiliar with, and it and some interior texture and spice that was unique.  Was in a hurry, so I didn't write down what it was, however I know there are spices and ingredients that are indigenous to various central and south american foods, so I never know what to expect, except that it will be tried and true, passed down through the centuries as a solid staple of the family meal.  And for $3.00 each?  Its a beautiful thing.\n     I have been to El Salvador 3 times, have stayed with local families, and pupusas were served at every home cooked meal.  You know a good pupusa through taste and vision.  It takes years to get a really good feel for the corn dough consistency, and to be able to shape the dough into a little bowl or nest, lay in the proper amount of flavor and ingredients, then folds the nest over top, totally enveloping them, and then flatten with out leaking everywhere.  Only takes about 5 minutes to learn how to make a pupusa, a lifetime to perfect the technique, so I have a pretty good idea of the experience level of the cook just by their outward appearance.  \n   This establishment has survived 30 years on this spot, so that tells me the experience level is there to create a perfect product.  Estas pupusas son perfectas!!   \n\nMuchas gracious!\n\nI keep practicing with my Salvadoran friends, so they taste good, but now I need them to look like I really know what I'm doing.

Not like she can't cook a dozen of these at a time on her fryer.  2 for $5, I ordered the pork-cheese, and the beef-cheese pupusas.  \n\nAfter a couple minutes, she gave them to me, piping hot, on a paper plate.  I chose to eat-in though, as I was really in no rush.  You can eat these pupusas with some pickled vegetables, which makes it a reasonably balanced meal.  The pupusas reminded me of Russian peroshkis, except with cornmeal wrapping.  Perhaps I was starving, but I found them very satisfying.", "author": "Gerald C."}

They are very filling with lots of meat! $3. Get the bananas, we missed out but they had them 5 minutes after we ordered. \n\n The indoor seating was kind of dirty but I guess I cant expect much at 1:30am in the mission.

They have a wide variety of flavors, and you can get 2 for $5 or 1 for $3. \n\nWhen you go to Panchita's you can either sit inside or just pick up some pupusas outside at the street cart. If you sit inside on the bench seating, there is slaw and salsa on each table and they have beer for sale. If you choose to grab your delicious pupusas from outside, there is a brand new set up. Panchitas recently upgraded to a nice outdoor cart with glass windows, which is a nice improvement. The pupusas just take a few minutes to cook so you're out pretty fast. They provide plastic forks if you need them and slaw and salsa in little bags to go. \n\nMy favorite type of pupusa is called \"the mix\". It's a delicious mix of meats and cheese that is to die for. All of the pupusas are delicious though. They also have a bunch of vegetarian options. \n\nThe ladies who make the pupusas are the sweetest ever. I always walk by on my way to and from work and they always smile and wave at me even if I don't stop by.\n\nI usually get one pupusa, but two if I'm starving. My boyfriend get's three at a time he loves them so much. \n\nI only took off one star because I think they could make the inside restaurant a bit nicer.

There's no telling how long the jars have been there, how often they're refilled, or whether the long ladles in each jar have ever seen a dishwasher. This is Panchita's way. This is not somewhere you go if you're highly susceptible to mud butt.\n\nThe pupusas are cooked on a grill by the door and arrive at your table in a smeary mess on a paper plate. Do not expect the pillowy, immaculate pupusas of Balompie, with all the contents sealed neatly inside. Panchita's pupusas taste like the grill, via skidmarks of cheese crisped brown. When it's really busy, your pupusas might be undercooked, oozy and separating lengthwise. The center cannot hold. On New Year's Eve, a stranger will sit down and fall asleep at your table. When it's empty, no one will rush to serve you.\n\nPanchita's is a worthy drunk bite after visiting what John Waters called the \"many alarming bars\" in this stretch of the Mission. You ladle out the slaw and the hot sauce and dive in. While the pupusas may arrive unkempt or not quite done, they generally taste very good.

Frankly, God could hit the delete key on the rest of the 7x7 and you'd still have yourself one hell of a town!\n\nI like to eat there only when the ladies are out front with their pupusa-making cart, frying up the hottest freshest pupusas this side of the Andromeda cluster. \n\nI like the pork & cheese or bean & cheese (the cheese crisps up brown on the hot grill emitting that \"I don't know what\" flavor that consistently cause my eyes roll back into my head as I shout expletives for 20 minutes into a bucket).\n\nWe accidentally got a zucchini one too and I hate to say it son, but it was also fantastic! \n\nAn essential part of the pupusas is the toppings and let's be honest folks -- at most of these places -- they chintz you on that. Even when you say \"EXTRA\" and gesture real big (round-tummy, happy-customer)...not because of any language barrier, mind you, but just because you're just  a really big pig who knows how these things work!\n\nWell, here, they just leave a bucket of the toppings on the table for you to empty at your discretion. I think I may have taken advantage of this situation but I'm sure it all balances out in the end.\n\nEither/either come here at night when they're frying outside and you will not be dissapointed!

Keep in my mind I am a true Salvadorian and expect the best from El Salvador. I come from the street of \"LA\" where  they truly have the best pupusas restaurants in the U.S.  The day started with a S.F. Giants game. And headed off on 16th st after the game. I'm new in town and went sightseeing and wanted to end up at Pier 39, but I glanced over and saw this place and remembered the reviews it had, so I had to, just had to see what the fuzz is all about. First of all, I locked my keys in my truck and took me several minutes to break into my own car.  Ha-ha, yes I am and have had a bad boy reputation. Any who, I noticed it's not a very good neighborhood to have a simple no alarm type car. Right-a-way I saw some wanna be thugs eyeing my truck...  \n\nOkay now for the food part, \"What the F**K\"  happened????????  This place needs a major, and I do mean call up Chef Ramsey for a \"Major Remodel\"... place is a dump.... Chairs look like a 70's car with chipped paint.  They need to hire a steam cleaning professional for those floors.  And the tables are so sticky, that you have to yank your arm off them..  Now parking is ridiculous  here, so I was only able to find 30 mins so I took my pupusas to go....... The ladies, \"and I am being nice here', look like they are fed up of this place and probably need a 30% raise in order to see a smile from them. , and yes they need to block off that ghetto kitchen in there, it's so old, that they hire a wineno to pick up the cervesa bottles. .and  the menu handouts are so fucking dirty...and missing a lot of pages.......\n\n\nFor those of you that don't know how to reheat a pupusas at home, here's how..\n\nYou use a tortilla griddle thingy to heat them up at medium... You flip them often for about 3-5 mins should do, unless you want them crispy, than flip them for  about 10 mins.... \nAny who, even if I ate the pupusas there, I would still give them a \"3\" out of 10....   The chicharon is not quite smashed properly cause you shouldn't bite on pieces of pork, it should all be melted with the cheese as it cooks, trust me, I know how to and have made pupusas myself....The curtido I give a 6 out of 10.  Not bad.........but seems like 3-5days old, and curtido should always be crisp, not old.....  the Salsa has to go....4 out 10 here. It's not supposed to be mild at all in order to allow those that don't like hot stuff..... bad decision on that part, but for me personally I like the mild stuff, but it needed more flav of flav to it.. Maybe some chicken bullion would have done the trick......\n\n\nOverall,  luckily I was in town chilling and sightseeing,  otherwise this dump is not worth my time coming from the Tri-valley area......", "author": "JJ C."}

I spun back, and got myself 2 for the road.\n\nI can confidently say the best pupusas I've had (or at least #2).  As of late, whenever I've gotten a pupusa craving, I've been pretty let down.  I honestly wasn't expecting much here, but it was too tempting to ignore.  Plus 2 for $5 is a pretty sweet deal. So I was very pleasantly surprised on the outcome here.\n\nThe Loroco was a veggie that's common in Central America, but I hadn't seen it before so I gave it a shot. Not bad, kinda nutty flavor, but I'll probably stick to meat the next time.  The Pork one was the real star here: SO FUGGIN' GOOD. Plus they are not shy about loading up on the cheese. Surprisingly, the paper bags holding them didn't become see-through, so it wasn't as greasy as it probably could have been and still managed to be super cheesy and savory.", "author": "Alan W."}

They serve burritos and Mexican food too.  I think the polo y queso pupusa was really good, while the chicharon was so-so.  The portions of everything are huge, though.  3 of my friends and I all ordered 2 pupusas, and were stuffed.  3 other friends with us ordered burritos, which were, quite possibly, the largest burritos I've ever seen in my life.  They.  Were.  Huge.\n\nWhen I walked in, I feel like the whole restaurant stopped to look at me.  It wasn't because I was the only white person or anything (the restaurant had a good mix of people in it and SF is an accepting place anyways...).  The place was just dead quiet.  When my friend and I walked in, one of our other friends was putting songs on the jukebox to break the awkward silence in the restaurant.  It felt kind of odd to have a conversation at our table, since it seemed like everyone was being forced to listen to it as a result of the weird restaurant atmosphere.  Eventually, we ended up with a party of 8, which in itself made the place a little more lively and inviting.  One of the guys with us had brought his guitar, which also helped the atmosphere a bit.\n\nService is slow and occasionally you might feel a little ignored.  I'm still not certain if you're supposed to order at the counter or wait to be waited on.  Speaking Spanish helps a bit, so if you can, do it.  All in all, a tasty place to eat and, as long as you bring the party, you should be fine.

We took our order fairly quickly (this place had like maybe 2-3 other people sitting around when we came in)\n\nWe sat there and waited. And waited. And waited. FINALLY our Horchata comes out, which wasn't very up to par. It wasn't really refreshing at all, and I fought to sip it slowly... I've never had bad Horchata before so this was a first.\n\nThen we waited some more. And more.\n\nOVER AN HOUR LATER -- the 2-3 other people who had ordered their food FINALLY got their orders. Another 15 minutes later, we got ours. I'm not the type that would walk out on a restaurant, but I was really reallly tempted this time..\n\n\nTheir food is alright, it wasn't amazing and I actually got nauseous while eating for some reason -- it might've been that Horchata from earlier. What got me was that, for what they were charging us, they sure need to make certain that their food comes out quickly and that it's even GOOD to begin with.\n\nRan into a friend afterward and told him where I ate. \"Dude, that place sucks... and is super expensive...\"\n\nI wish he told me this earlier, so be forewarned !", "author": "John B."}

The seating is great too, nice large tables with self serve water.  My only problem with this place is that it can take a bit to get your papusas, especially if there are multiple orders ahead of you.

Usually the person(s) outside receive the payment, but today the woman instructed me to pay inside for a to-go item.  I proceeded to do so; and the cashier inside advised me it was $5.50.  \n\nI was surprised that there was a 10% increase --- because I had just purchased the same order two weeks ago. I had asked her when the price increased; and she stated it had always been that way.  \n\nSince I just wanted to get home I thought to myself --- Ok... maybe the increase happened recently.  --- And because I felt  she just wanted to get rid of me, I decided to simply pay the $5.50. \n\nI returned outside to wait for my order.  A couple minutes later as I was waiting for my order another person ordered two pupusas as well.  When the person was ready to pay, he asked the woman outside the price and she told him it was $5.  He gave her his $5 then went on his way. \n\nI couldn't believe that this was happening right in front of me.  When I asked the woman why she only accepted $5 when the cashier inside told me to pay $5.50, she looked confused and told me to speak with the cashier.  \n\nI went back to speak with the cashier and she insisted that all orders are $5.50.  When I had told her that the woman outside only accepted $5 from the other customer (not $5.50), she insisted that she did not accept the $5.  But the thing is -- the $5 bill was still on the cart where the woman placed it!  \n\nThe woman/cashier disregarded my statement and said again that such orders have always been $5.50.  She then rolled her eyes at me --- and clearly was annoyed when I explained to her the situation. I knew I was not going to get any where with this woman. So I took my order and went on my way. \n\nLook - I really don't want to have an argument over $0.50.  And I am disappointed that I have to write this review.  But I feel on principle this incident must be shared.   \n\nI think it is poor business practice to quote a customer a higher price then quote another customer who made the same order --- a lower price --- especially in front of the other who was, in plain words, cheated. \n\nI wish I had something better to report here.

Biggest mistake ever to give this place a chance. \n\nWe arrived in the Mission, thinking there would be a lot of different restaurants to try, and we decided to choose this one on a whim, and we were STARVING. And who doesn't love pupusas? Perhaps it could beat our local Salvadorian restaurant on the Peninsula. \n\nThe \"eatery\" was run down with the whirring of their kitchen equipment over powering our ability to hear each other. But we thought that we should give the place a chance, since a lot of the restaurants reviewed in the mission seem to have some version of dirty attached to them. We seat ourselves and wait a few minutes just to have menus brought to us...should have taken that as a sign to leave. When the waitress comes back, we order our beverages and she delivers semi-warm beverages, stale, cold chips and sub-par salsa. We order our pupusas. I was so hungry that I ate most of the stale chips. Thirty minute later, we still have no food, two tables seated after us got their entire orders plus one guy with his little dog came in, (it looks like the server knew who they were, friends or family) placed a to-go order and got that before us!\n\nWe paid for our luke-warm drinks and left, hungry and frustrated.

I had noticed the plethora of Salvadorean restaurants in the Mission and thought it was high time to give one a try. This one looked a bit dingy, but I like my food authentic, so we decided to give it a try. \n\nThey brought our chips and salsa right away - chips were a bit greasy, but the salsa was nice. We ordered the carne asada plate - overcooked beef, with flavorless beans, french fries, greasy white rice and a bit of salad; the cheese enchilada plate which had a nice green sauce, but far too much cheese and of course the rice and beans; and the pollo encebollado - overcooked well flavored chicken with onions, served with the previously mentioned greasy rice and salad. The service was decent and while not a miserable meal, definitely not a great meal - at least while we were there. \n\nThe problems began quickly - first with my table mate who had the carne asada. He began feeling queasy before even finishing his meal. It was a long car ride home. I began with a headache (often a first sign of food poisoning for me) on the car ride home and was nauseous within an hour. Throwing up the remainders of my pollo encebollado within a few hours and still feeling pretty crappy 12 hours later.\n\nTrust your eyes - there's a reason there was a long wait at those other restaurants.", "author": "Rachel D."}

They were made fresh and grilled by two of the sweetest ladies ever.  Panchita's? Their pupusas are pretty good, but they don't compare. Also the lady messed up my order, but it wasn't a big deal. Honestly, especially since I didn't check my order before I left the restaurant.\n\nI got 2 pork & cheese and 1 spinach & cheese instead of pork, cheese, beans and pork & cheese, and spinach & cheese. So I didn't get my beans, but that's probably a good thing? Not sure, this sounds kinda fatty now that I've typed it out. hmmm. *stares at stomach* The pupusas don't seem extraordinarily large, but trust me. You will feel it, them, after ingestion. \n\nIn any case, it's hard for pupusas to live up to my memory but Panchita's does quite nicely. They also have alfajores! Also not as good as my memory (this one from Argentina).  -__-\" ignore me. \n\nIn any case, I'm asian. I showed up by myself after the Giants parade.

A while back I went on a pupusa binge and tried ALL of the places that serve pupusas in the entire greater Bay Area.  SF, East Bay and everywhere else I could find them.  This is the best. All the fillings at Panchitas Pupusaria are delicious, and seasoned perfectly with interesting combinations of flavors.  Chicken pupusas are the best, next spinach & cheese, then mushroom & garlic a close runner up.  They also have combo meal plates with rice and beans, and snacks like plantains.  Great place to get a quick and delicious meal for a very reasonable price.  Very casual ambiance, and sometimes loud late at night.  Good people watching.  I go for the totally fabulous food, I have dreams about eating there. YUM!  They don't have a fancy website, and the photos don't do them justice, but the food is truly excellent.

Both dishes were delicious made with fresh ingredients -- I especially like the melted cheese...it was so good!  The salsa and chips were decent, I couldn't have too much of the salsa because it was a bit too spicy for my taste buds, but the chips were perfect.   The horchata (cinnamon rice milk) is refreshing -- I love it :-)!\n\nAs we finish up, Stan goes to the bathroom while Kitty and I munched on the chips.  A second later, I hear two gunshots, \"BOOM BOOM\"... everyone in the restaurant drops down the the ground, including the workers.  I sat there in shock not knowing what to do.  I finally realized that I should get away from the door/windows so I scurried towards the back by the bathroom.  I get on my cell phone and call one of the roommates.  Less than five minutes after the gunshots, there were already cops, ambulances, and firefighters blocking the intersection of 16th and Valencia and that's when we decided it was a good idea to to leave.  \n\nGood news: The three of us got home safely and I will continue to hang out in the Mission (the bars here are awesome), even though I freaked out for a second after hearing gunshots.", "author": "Celeste M."}

It used to be fried chicken and waffles but I think I've discovered a whole new world of bad. Load me up with a pair of these bad boys and you can see me toss my healthy eating restrictions aside without a second thought.\n\ncrispy on the outside, chewy with stretchy cheese (and your choice of filling if you so choose) on the inside, inexpensive and you can lie to yourself that you're eating veggies if you get the version with lorroco AND load them up with the pickled cabbage/carrot slaw that comes with it. Yes, I am great at denial.\n\nThe main draw for me at this place wasn't actually their pupusas if you can believe that- no, it was their sopa (soup) to be honest. I hadn't been feeling all that fantastic the last several weeks- I think I kept catching the same stupid cold over and over and a girl gets tired of the same ol' pho ga/chicken matzoh ball/udon/avgolemono rotation. I needed a new soup flavor and this place spoke to me.\n\nJR had the sopa del res (beef soup), me the pollo (chicken) and we had the same pupusas as the ones from Tita's for consistency's sake-one lorroco and one chicharron. \n\nThe soup arrived steaming in a gigantic bowl loaded with meat (I think mine had over a quarter of a chicken in it!), a corn on the cob,  carrots, zuchinni, and god knows what else. I think Roger's came with chunks of yucca too, but the verdict's still out on that one. It came with a side of rice which wasn't all that intriguing on it's own and I can see how people would be unhappy about it if that's what they got with a plate of other stuff, but with the soup it went just fine. There was just so much food in the bowl I immediately felt guilty knowing I wasn't going to finish as much as I wanted. It was delicious and with a few squeezes of lemon, hit the spot for Typhoid Morty.\n\nThe pupusas weren't as well constructed or as flavorful as the ones from Tita's in Buttonwillow, and their masa wasn't as fragrant and didn't hold together as well either, but I still can't shake a stick at melty oozy cheese. The lorroco didn't have as much flavor as Tita's either but I let it slide. One big thing I really missed was that fresh tomato sauce though. hot sauce just doesn't cut it (especially if you have ulcers like me!). \n\nRoger had a pineapple liquado which turned out a little sweeter than I expected, and I had a tamarindo which was so delicious I am still antsy to have another. A perfect balance of sweet and tart with the distinguishing tamarind flavor, the only suggestion I would make is to thin it out just a skoch with some more water.\n\nI'll be trying other places in pursuit of a better Bay Area pupuseria, but the sopa and liquado search ends here for me.

But you absolutely LOVE the food. The food leaves you speechless, every bite is an absolute taste of heaven that tantalizes your tastebuds and leaves you craving for more.\n\nWith Panchitas,  I HATE the service, but actually LOVE the food, \nand here's why.\n\nSo after my workout I decided on having a late lunch. And coming here made me eat even LATER.\n\nI walk it and the place is busy, (about 12 people). There is an older woman server and another late teenage girl at the register. I grab my own menu and make my way towards the end of the restaurant. After ten minutes, the teenage girl finally walks up to me (she doesn't look happy to be there and bored and displays a look that I interpret as \"Uh huh, what do you want, I hate being here\").\nShe has her pen and pad and is ready to write, so without any preamble, I smile and say \"I'd like to get the shrimp cocktail,\nhome made tortillas, and a small sopa de res.\"\nServer:  \"Drink?\"\nMe: \"Pina?\"\nServer: Yeah we have it (sigh)\".\nMe: Ok Pina and ice water. Thank you very much (with a smile)\nServer: Uh huh\n\nSo after 15 minutes of looking at my cell phone, examining the decor (or lack of) of the restaurant, and looking at their two way mirrors, the teenage server girl brings me my pina drink and iced water and a fork, spoon, and knife with a napkin. After another 10 minutes I get a basket of chips (crispy, well salted) with a small bowl of homemade hot sauce. I'm really famished at this point and already thinking of Yelp and what I would write. So in the beginning we were at zero stars, and then after another 10 minutes the tortillas arrive, and that's when the food starts to win me over.\n\nTheir version of hand made tortillas (not the store bought thin crappy ones) is wonderful. The tortillas were thick and so fresh of the griddle that I burned my hand on the first one. They were so hot and delicious and melted in my mouth. \n\nAfter 10 more minutes, the shrimp cocktail I ordered was more like a prawn cocktail services in a huge goblet. There were 8 large, tender (cooked perfectly) plump and juicy prawns swimming in a wonderfully spiced tomato broth with thinly sliced onions, tomatoes, cilantro, small chunks of fresh avocado  with a hit of garlic and lime (not overpowering or sour).  I took one bite and had to marvel at the well balanced flavors of the tenderly cooked prawns in that sauce. This is a must have for any yelper who loves prawns. \n\nAfter 15 more minutes, they finally brought out the sopa de res.\nSopa de res is a braised beef and vegetable soup. This is good for hangovers, the common cold, and to be eaten on a rainy cold day like today. The small sopa de res is really huge. It arrived in a huge white bowl and was steaming hot. It had a huge amount of TENDER boneless beef, tender carrots, tender corn on the cob, tender zucchini, tender yucca (think mexican starchy veggie like a potato) celery, and chayote (think of a mexican version of a zucchini). The broth was wonderfully flavored and had a very rich flavor that no salt was needed.  They serve the soup with a small plate of perfectly cooked white rice with a touch of butter and salt. It really goes well with the soup.\n\nIn the middle of my meal, I noticed another gentleman coming inside to eat, and after 10 minutes of not being acknowledged, or getting a menu, or anything to drink or any chips, he left. (He'll probably write a yelp review, you never know).\n\nThe prices are considerably inexpensive for the type of food and quantity you receive.  \n\nSo if you come here, you'll need alot of time on your hands. Bring some friends to keep you company or a large book to read. This place is good for college students on a BUDGET who like to study and eat undisturbed.", "author": "Charlene C."}

For all of the white folks out there who do not grasp the finer points of international relations, here is a crash course: #1) In certain cultures it is considered rude to be in a hurry at a restaurant and meal and #2) It is considered rude to drop the check to a customer before they ask for one.

The restaurant was fairly full with parties of 8 or more, so we were lucky to snag a table for four at the front of the restaurant right by the window. \n\nService was a little bit slow, however, to get us place settings, chips, or menus for that matter.  It took about 10 minutes for them to finally take our order, as well, but I was in good company, so it really didn't matter that much to me. \n\nI ordered my usual 3 pupusas revueltas, a fried plantano, and an horchata.  The pupusas were awesome.  Nice and crispy on the bottom and the filling spot on.  The plantano was freaking awesome and had a nice cream fried along on the inside (it seemed, anyway).  The curtido was, eh, curtido, and I was a little disappointed that there was no sauce to go along with it.  So, I was left to eating it with just the curtido.  Sad.  I know.  \n\nNow, this would have been a three star review if it weren't for one thing ... the horchata.  It was the real deal, kids.  It was made from real rice where I could actually taste the grittiness, and seasoned really nicely with some cinammon and sugar.  For that alone, Panchita's deserves an additional star.  Yum.

And for $2.50 a piece, it's on. Panchita's also serve some bomb caramel cookies covered in powdered sugar for desert. I would go in there just to buy a few more of those yo.

All the tables in the restaurant were full so we thought we would give it a try. Right when you are seated we got chips and salsa...then we waited about 5 minutes before we decided to grab our own menus and then waited about 10 minutes before we decided that it would be faster to order at the cash register as takeout.  We were hungry and getting testy by the minute, as were the other patrons. While we were waiting, we realized why the restaurant was full, no one had been served their food yet. It was brought out one plate at a time, which was really strange to us. We contemplated leaving, but 1. they took our money when we ordered and 2. we were not in any hurry. We thought we would give them the benefit of the doubt that maybe the staff had not anticipated the increase in business from the Red Bull event.  However, they had the event's flyer in the window...so that was a bit strange.\n\nThe food came out about 45 minutes after we had walked in. I know this review started out negatively, but we were really happy with the food. I ordered the pollo encebollado. It was very tender and tasty and came with beans and rice.  My husband loves pupusas but rarely comes by them, so he ordered 3 at $2.00 each. He was excited about how cheap they were and how large each pupusa was.  They are served with a pickled cabbage salad that balances the heaviness of the pupusa perfectly.  Our friend ordered the quesadilla suiza and enjoyed it as well.\n\nBy the time our food came, there was a line from the cash register out the door.  We thought to warn them about the wait but decided against it because the food was pretty good. \n\nAfter reading the reviews, I see that the service is regularly extremely slow.  My thoughts on this is that as long as you know what you are in for, you won't be as upset. The food is really good, but just know that you will have to wait for it...and even be a little proactive about grabbing your own menu and utensils and even ordering from the guy at the cash register if you haven't seen the waitress in a while.  Note: this also gets you served ahead of the other patrons who came before you but don't catch on as quickly.

It also helped that I had a few beers right before at a Happy Hour Event at Sports Basement on Bryant. I came in there with my gf and went all out. The papusas are $2.50 and if you want to get a Papusa with Been and Rice it's $6. The papusas were excellent. THey were good sized and they filled me up. I also ordered a damn good CHicken Tamale and a Puffy Taco Dish which for some reason was an Enchilada. I guess that's how they do it at El Salvadore? Maybe it was a cordito? I'm not sure but either way it was very good. THe one advice I have for people who come to this place is not to order the Mexican dishes unless you get a Burrito. The Burritos are huge and you get what you pay for $7. The other Mexican meals did not look particularly that great. I would stay in the Appetizer/Papusa section and there's nothing you will regret. The waiter (or the guy in the counter) was very friendly too. He kept convincing me to order more as I'm sure he knew I was drunk. So I kept ordering and I kept eating. Then he thought I would like a Corona so I got one too. The result was me feeling hella full and sleepy.

It was good, but it wasn't $10/pupusa good.\n\nSome months later, after a night out in the Mission, my friends and I were starving.  We decided to check out the pupusas at Panchita's.  What a good call!  I ordered the Pupusa Revuelta and a side of sweet plantains with beans and sour cream.  The... best... meal... ever.  I am aware that it is not the lightest meal you can have, but even my most health conscious friends crave pupusas from Panchita's every once in a while.  And my Salvadorian friend is a fan too, so there's your proof of authenticity.  \n\nSome people complain that service is slow, but they do give you chips and salsa to keep you \"entertained\" while you wait.  And there is a jukebox with a pretty good selection of oldies, but goodies.  The first thing that one of my friends does when she walks in is select Total Eclipse of the Heart.
