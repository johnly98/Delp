Given the circumstances ended with me, you should probably hear from me. I know you've heard from many people... I have many dear friends that are much braver - but my voice should be heard, too.\n\nOn Saturday, I wanted to celebrate my boyfriends birthday at a bar we all love, and frequent often. To note, the minute we walked in, your door guy was aggressive. He walked around shoving chairs, clearing tables at unnecessary moments, and even giving myself weird looks. It was odd, and I noted this to myself, but didn't say anything out loud.\n\nI wasn't outside when he started yelling at my friend that she \"elbowed him\", but given the three people that were are all my dearest friends, I know they tell the truth when they say that she didn't ever elbow him. Even as he was yelling at her, she remained calm, while he continued to insult them. I came outside as he was telling my friends \"to go back where they came from\", and calling them \"entitled children.\" I was there for those comments.\n\nBy this point, he should have gone back to his chair. If he was correct, he should have been resolute with kicking my friend out of the bar and going back to do his job. But he was not.\n\nAs he continued to make inconsiderate and offensive remarks, he chose to zero in on another one my friends, who inquired about what happened. The door guy then  chose to show him by elbowing him in the side. Totally unprofessional, not cool and unnecessary. Obviously upsetting him, my friend asked him not to touch him. He then chose to zero in on him and began pushing him away from the front door, noting that he was \"too close to the fucking door to be smoking there.\" It was unnecessary, and an indicator that he just wanted to fight. He continued to push him, and aggravate my friend. It was shocking. \n\nThat was when I had enough. That is when I told him, that we would all be leaving, but if anyone should have been acting level headed in that situation, it should have been him. Because, out of all of us there -- he was the one working. He was currently at his \"job\", and instead of yelling at us, pushing people around, he should be acting like an adult. There were many others ways he could handled the situation, and this was not okay.\n\nThat is when he said, \"Oh I'm sorry, what do you want me to say? \"Yessa Massa?\". \n\nRacism is something that I'm very used to, and aware of. I'm from Utah, where my black skin has been the base for many jokes. Why I haven't received jobs. Why I wasn't chosen to participate on teams, or just plain ignorance out in the world. But since moving to San Francisco 3 years ago, I've never had anything like this happen. I couldn't even speak. And even today, I'm still in shock that someone would outright and blatantly be so racist, ignorant, and just a sad human being. \n\nI understand that the management there was just doing their job last night, by asking us to leave. They didn't know the full story, they weren't outside to hear the  conversations or see the pushing. Their job is to protect their employees -- particularly in a workplace where patrons can get crazy. But now that you have the full story, I hope you make the right decision and choose to terminate his employment. Phonebooth deserves to be represented better -- and I know this because this is a bar that I frequent often. \n\nAnd in todays landscape, I think it would speak volumes if you let him continue on. He will continue to spew racist hate and intolerance, which I hope you have a no-tolerance policy for. \n\nSincerely,\nShaquille Heath", "author": "Shaquille H."}

Thus, every bar's rating begins with 5 perfect stars and goes down as all available evidence is held against it.\n\nIn the case of the Phone Booth, allow the prosecution to offer the follow exhibits:\n\nExhibit A: A cadre of too many smug, self-conscious hipster elitists (or, worse, those who desperately want to be hipsters but can't even pull off the act of fashionable conformity). It's a known fact that the Phone Booth is post-collegiate hipster central, which thus makes it a cornerstone of Mission district gentrification...not to mention more than a little annoying when you're surrounded by a swarm of horn-rimmed fake intellectuals. Penalty: Minus 1 star.\n\nExhibit B: Ironic decor. Not merely kitschy decor, since I can appreciate the whimsical flair of retro paintings and lamps, but the sort of all-out decorative absurdity only hipsters think is actually funny, e.g., a motherfuggin' New Kids on the Block poster. Get your own life and live it, ironic losers. Penalty: Minus 1 star.\n\nExhibit C: Subtle mood-lighting halogen lamps above the bar. Sorry, but no so-called \"dive\" should ever have these things. They reveal the latent yuppie aspirations of any bar (and/or citizen). If I wanted to sit under a chic string of crimson halogen bulbs, I'd go to some trendy SoMa cocktail lounge with a name like \"Lotion\" or \"Smooth\" --- and then I'd kill myself, because I hate those kinds of places. Penalty: Minus 1 star.\n\nAs all-encompassing prosector, judge, jury, and executioner, however, I will go easy on the Phone Booth because of several extenuating circumstances, including:\n\n- relatively cheap prices (i.e., $2.25 pints of PBR, $3.75 tall boys of Tecate, etc.)\n\n- a pretty-sweet chandelier made of Barbie torsos\n\n- a very solid jukebox with punk, post-punk, country, funk, indie rock, and a blessed minimum of cliched Greatest Hits CDs\n\n- a generally enjoyable combination of cozy size, comfortable darkness, and casual bartenders.\n\nSo I give the Phone Booth back 1 of its penalty stars, leaving a total of 3 stars overall. Take down the NKOTB poster and I may give it 4. I'm permanently withholding the 5th star until one of the resident hipsters can finally explain to me why the hell I should give a crap about Stephen Malkmus.", "author": "John G."}

Friendlier than other bars in the area.  Even if you don't drink it, it is comforting to know that there is $2 Pabst in pint glasses.  The history, as I've learned, is that it used to cater to gay workers in the Pac Bell building across the street.  There are still locals who show up and a pretty tolerant crowd most nights - tolerant of people of various ages, races, genders, sexualities and fashionabilities.  Still, it's the Mission, and clearly not a bar for the Latino immigrants in the neighborhood (though even a couple of them drop in for Tecate when it isn't too crowded), so it is often dominated by hipsters, their contemporaries and their admirers.\n\nDespite the 4 stars, it is my bar of choice in the neighborhood and the city for that matter.", "author": "Carlos V."}

It's small, it's dark, the drinks are strong (when you order a rum and Coke, you literally get mostly rum with a little Coke) and cheap ($4!), and they have pretty amazing decor -- there's a naked Barbie chandelier. What more do you want? We were there on a Saturday around 9, and it wasn't overly crowded. We were able to walk in and grab a seat. Getting a drink wasn't a problem either, as the bartender acknowledged you quickly once you approached the bar, and waited on you soon after. \n\nWhen you walk in, there's a bar to your right, and a church pew-like bench lining the left wall, along with tables and chairs. The decor -- and I'm not sure if this is just seasonal or what -- consisted of these awesome tree-like structures with faux cobwebs and skulls on them. Very Halloween-y. There's also an awesome jukebox, as tons of other reviewers have mentioned. Oh, and -- this is one of the cleanest dive bars I've ever been in! Definitely a plus. In fact, someone at another table fell out of his chair and shattered a glass of beer on the floor while we were there. They immediately picked up all the glass shards, and mopped the floor so that it was Pinesol-fresh. Not exactly a delightful scent, but a helluva lot better than garbage, and I appreciated that my shoes weren't sticking to the floor!

Large selection of quality booze to choose from, too. \n\nAfter drinking one too many coffees over the day, I was hopelessly dehydrated (and working on a headache), so I started the evening off with a couple glasses of water, while my friend knocked back a few beers. The bartender was totally cool about it, was super nice, and kept voluntarily refilling my water. Once I was suitably watered, I ordered a Cosmo (the first of two)... not only was my Cosmo exceptionally tasty, it was inexpensive, and plentiful (the bartender gave me the extra drink from the shaker in a second glass--- what my friend called the \"Junior\" cocktail). He even chilled the martini glass with ice water before pouring my drink. Lots of class.\n\nFrom my vantage point, at the corner of the bar, looking down the length of the bar, I had the perfect people watching space, watching the influx of interestingly diverse, unpretentious locals and cute dogs at the door. The place was super chill at 9 pm, and got much more popular in the next few hours. The great thing is, the music was fun, but not so loud up you couldn't have a low-key conversation at the bar. Sitting at the tables would be better for folks who like to get up close and personal with their neighbors, and aren't too claustrophobic. \n\nA good place to go with a friend (or two), a date, or alone, since people seemed happy to chat with newcomers.

Upbeat!). Then moments later when the song comes up he'll want to know all that all over again. Which, whom, what and suchlike as if he wasn't even listening the first time. About the time Violent Femmes came on and he asked \"Is this Prince?\" I went to the Red Place of the semi-batshit musical academic. \"Dude, this is like the opposite of Prince. Are you even listening?\".\n\nProps anyhow to the regulars here. This is one Mission bar that didn't alienate all the original joints rummies when the cool kids bought it. God bless their elastic pants, these lifers. Actual Gov't check recipients slurping down their E&Js before the fixed gear crowd checks in for their shift. You don't see that often. Nothing sadder then seeing a guy in a straw cowboy hat with a Saddam moustache staring longingly at the Latin-American or Doc's Clock as if to say, \"Man, I used to get in some knife fights up in this. But no more.\" Makes me get all Indian Crying At Garbage.\n\nGreat bartenders. So good they'd almost rate Five Stars. But there's the thing about the Prince CD hustle. Do not deny me Prince. To that end, if a working Prince anthology is an important bar criteria to you, feel free to judge this review \"useful\".\n\nCheck The Update 01/14/07:\nMy whistle-blowing saw a clear result in Wanna Be Your Lover earlier tonight. I'm going back for happy hour tomorrow to see if I can break off some Let's Go Crazy. Dearly beloved, when Prince breaks down The Agent don't sleep!", "author": "Jeremy W."}

Besides, the usefulness of the term hipster has faded every since Norman Mailer burped out the term one morning while sitting on the toilet, yelling at nothing in particular. But mostly I think this because I would likely be labeled a hipster by someone who didn't know me, and I hate to think that sort of socio-profiling is going on in this enlightened city.\n\nSo yes: if you enjoy 24 oz cans of Tecate and cheap whiskey, that doesn't necessarily make you a hipster; moreover, you will probably enjoy this place. And yes, you can smoke inside. You might have one of two reactions to that sentence: \"Ewwwwwww\" or \"Hells to the fuck yes!\" I happen to fall in the latter category, as it gets cold as bees outside, and sometimes you don't want to relinquish your precious seat just to go feed your little addiction, you know?\n\nAnd I say \"precious\" because this place is small and does get crowded quickly, so show up early and lay claim to one of the tables in front. Then send out a trusted envoy from your party to buy drinks and mess with the jukebox, which is truly fucking amazing, if you are into that sort of thing.\n\nFinally, there is a pool table here, but anyone serious about playing pool will find themselves hopelessly annoyed by the tiny space.\n\nBasically, this is one of those bars that sucks if you can't find a seat, but rules if you can.

After a day or a week of feeling out of place, lonely, wondering what in the world a midwestern girl like me was doing in a crazy city like this, I would sidle up to the bar at the Phone Booth, order a well vodka and cran for $3, and my worldview would immediately improve.\n\nTheir prices have gone up a bit since then, but they still have some of the cheapest drinks around, and definitely the strongest.  The bartenders are friendly and the jukebox is one of the best.  It gets a bit hipstered out on the weekends, but if you get there early or go on a weeknight, it will be the bar of your dreams.  If you're me.\n\nI have peed in the alley around the corner at the beginning of a long trudge home.  I have celebrated two birthdays here.  I have secret pet names for the bartenders.  I have fed lots of quarters to the great jukebox. I have smoked lots of cigarettes inside.

Portraying a rough and tumble alcoholic poet his character occupied a space at a down town dive bar, over-running his tab, picking fights with the local steady and making a mess of himself in the company of any female who would entertain his type. This film romanticised, in a peculiar way, the American dive bar. An establishment operating with the sole purpose of getting its clientele well and truly liquored for a reasonable amount of money. The Phone Booth is the last remaining homage to the great American dive bar. Located off Mission this locals-only haunt consists of an old, unkept bar serviced by disinterested bar staff, a stained old pool table and a gang of faithful natives all of which seem to pay no regard to the recently imposed national smoking bans. It was refreshing to find an establishment that operates under an unspoken client-staff agreement, you do what you want and we will tell nobody. A bar that never measures drinks, plays the bartenders ipod and allows everyone to smoke inside; a seemingly blatant middle finger to the powers to be. I recommend staying till close on a Saturday night just to witness the crass but highly effective approach the bar tenders take when clearing their place of business.

Before 9pm it's a decent place to have a conversation and a beer, so it gets an extra star for that, but like, for real.  Who are these people and what do they stand for?", "author": "Ben V."}

Asking me why I love the Phone Booth is like asking your soulmate why she loves you. It's just this incredibly strong feeling inside. Small as the name implies, smoky, drinks about fifty cents cheaper than most places, an excellent jukebox and central location (25th and South Van Ness) -- I don't even know if it's better than most places because to me it's the only bar in town. A recurring cast of interesting characters helps, and a different atmosphere from most Mission watering holes. Nobody comes here to get stinking drunk, just to have a great time and leer at the occasional tragic hipster who stumbles in.", "author": "Davi M."}

There are a couple of great bartenders but then the opposite side of the spectrum is well represented too. Most evenings you will find a pool table, a great jukebox, stale popcorn and depending on what you look like, serious attitude from far to many of your fellow patrons. I should really accept that I am old and crotchety because I am so over the crowd here.  Marina pretension is based on making more money than you. Mission pretension is based on being \"hipper\" than you. Same douche, different uniform. Two stars for some pretty good memories.", "author": "Mingus R."}

We went to the Make Out Room. We went to the Attic. We went to Pops. Only when we went to the Phone Booth did the real fun start. The music was killing it. People were dancing on chairs, dancing with the bouncers, moving their hips around the pool table. Everyone was having a good time. It was like the red room in Santa Cruz, but better. The red room of yesteryear. I love the decor. The bartenders are nice (rare in a hip dive like this, can you say pretentious?). Even when we were there after the last call the staff generally treated us with respect for the fun we were having.

Their beer selection is typical for a dive, [PBR, Olympia, Anchor Steam, etc] but now I opt for strictly mixed drinks because they are crafted with care and a heavy hand. For about $4.\nStar 2: Indoor smoking. Even though I'm trying to quit, its nice to not have all my friends leave to go outside when they want one. \nStar 3: It can read my mind. I swear, whenever I go to this bar, its set to the exact mood I'm in. From a pool game, after-work unwind, or catching up with a friend, it all works here.\nStar 4: Solid Jukebox. I usually have a bit of distain for jukebox bars, [music should be part of the atmosphere, not something you have to pay extra for!] but TPB has the best bar music. A hearty selection of '70's-'90's rock [read: New Order, Replacements, Mac, Bowie] plus enough new shit to appease hipsters. MGMT fans need not apply.\nStar 5: The Phone Booth really came through for me and my friends this year with a bangin' Halloween Party! Totally unexpected from this understated dive, but when I had a house full of people with no idea where to go, we were blown away by the dj's, costume contest and general debauchery of this bar's All Hallow's celebration. \n\nall in all, this is the kind of bar I would run myself, so I will continue to show it love.", "author": "Lauren C."}

I'm a social smoker so it works for me, but only if I'm kinda drunk as well (I'm just not used to smoking inside anymore, it weirds me out). It's been crowded all the times I've been here and it was hard to get a drink. But overall, not bad and the crowd is pretty fun and neighborhoody.", "author": "Gina R."}

My fear of being snubbed by pretentious regulars quickly disappeared after a cheery response from a pool table user. Everyone we ran into, literally and figuratively, was sincerely nice and interesting and, well, just chill; in fact, they were completely the opposite of pretentious. Perhaps the most snubbing seemed to have come from the bartenders, but I just blew it off as being busy and having to work New Year's Eve. Free champagne at midnight, cheap drinks--$17.50 for three, good long island iced teas. Maybe too good. Really too good. I felt very comfortable shoved in a little corner of the phone booth, playing partners pool all night with fantastic people we had just met.

The place is OK until about 8pm when it gets super crowded and smoky. One thing I can say is that the drinks are strong and reasonably priced. But still its not worth it. The environment is hideous. The smoke is the worst part (sorry, cigarettes are foul when smoked in small enclosed areas). The bar itself is dingy. most of the people (uber hipsters)  stand around the pool table and play all night. Everyone else takes up the rest of the small bar, which inevitably is overfilled. The topics of conversation are .... well lets put it this way last time I was there I heard walmart mentioned three times. Once by a Humboldt native who now works as a techie in walmart's corporate office, once by a hipster who \"just doesn't care what people say\" walmart is her favorite store and and once by a tattooed messenger looking guy who was really excited that he was going to walmart with his friend the next day. Yeah, I don't think I really need to say more.

All I wanted to do was sit the hell down, slide some suds down my throat and relax.  I accomplished approximately 1.5 of those goals.\n\nMy friend and her companion had a hook-up there with the bartenders, so we were stoked out on drinks all night and the service was top notch.  I can't complain on those two aspects, but then again it's tough to critique price and service when you've got a sly deal with the staff.  Unfortunately, they were fresh out of seats, so I got to stand all night long, which led to an annoyance which I hit on later.\n\nThe decor was a bit odd, although I was diggin' it.  If my memory serves me right, and often it doesn't (just a disclaimer), one of the main walls was red, and was adorned with Spanish-style bull fighting pictures.  As I ran my eyes past that wall, over to the pool table, and then back across the bar to the middle of the room where we were standing, my eyes stopped on a chandelier.  At first, I wasn't quite sure why I was even giving it more than a glance, but then I realized there were multi-racial barbies connecting the outer bulbs to the inner part of the fixture.  Uh-huh, yep, a barbie chandelier.  Just chillin', like it was a perfectly normal lighting fixture in any bar.  I don't know about you, Mr. and Mrs. Yelper, but I like when bars aren't afraid to throw random shit in their establishment.  It adds to the flavor and makes the place that much more of a trip as you start to get your drink on.  So there's that.\n\nAs for the crowd, it was quite the mix, which was nice.  Made for a fairly friendly atmosphere, because no group really had the upper hand numbers-wise.  The only thing that really pissed me off, was that the place ain't that big, and it was full of people (bad mix), so I was constantly, and I mean like 5-times-a-minute, getting bumped as people walked by.  There were no bad vibes or ill intentions, just passers by, but damn, that's a lot of spilled beer.  Luckily for me, mine was on the cheap.\n\nOverall, not a bad bar to hit up.  It certainly doesn't get me all warm and fuzzy just thinking about it, but it serves pretty well for a dive.  My only advice is to get there early enough to get a seat.  Otherwise you're in for an expensive evening.", "author": "Travis F."}
