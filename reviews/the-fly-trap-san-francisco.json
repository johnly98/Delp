All the tapas we ordered were delicious and portions are on the generous end. A few of our favorites are the squid ink risotto with calamari (5 stars - must order!), chicken skewers (4.5 stars), and beef flank steak (4.5 stars) - which were all extremely rich flavor with the sauce yet tender in the meat. The bolognese (4.5 stars) and kale salad (4 stars) were both generously portioned and delicious. The bill came out to $100 for 2 ppl without pre tips so a little bit on the pricier side.\n\nTLDR: great fun cozy place for amazing (but a little pricey) tapas", "author": "Nancy Z."}

Our waiter was (almost overly) attentive, trolled my dining companion when he asked where the bathroom was (\"I'm sorry, we don't have one, but you can go across the street...\"), offered to help us take a picture, etc. The signage on the door (see photos) was also hilarious.\n\nThe restaurant is on the smaller side, but it's beautiful. Nice ceilings, dim lighting, and mirrored walls make the place feel bigger than it is.\n\nI got the squash soup and had bites of the hanger steak. Honestly, the soup felt like someone dropped their white pepper shaker in.... The steak had been ordered medium, but it was definitely done more of a medium rare-- on the rare side, and a bit small. It lacked the meaty taste I prefer in steaks. The fries had a smoke seasoning on them that was tasty, and the lemon mayo was fresh and complemented these well.", "author": "Nicole H."}

This was largely because of the $$$ price point, though if one were to examine the menu, they'd realize that at around an average of $20ish for entrees, they're more in the $$ tier of restaurants.\n\nNow, how would one describe the food here? Many of the dishes are, at their core, very Mediterranean, ranging from lamb and kebabs, to hummus and risotto, while the rest are more typical New American dishes, with a strong Mediterranean flair to them, so, New Mediterranean, if that's a thing. Notable items include their truffle fries and kebabs, while their entrees, like the risotto and rack of lamb are solid, but almost a little too intense in their respective flavors.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Large venue consisting mostly of two tops, with a mixture of inner bench seating, and outer chair seating.\n\nBathroom - Didn't try them.", "author": "Johnny W."}

Clearly a popular choice for after-work gatherings, Fly Trap offers up some amazing, creative dishes that are very well-executed and have great flavor! We came with a group of four on a Friday night and started with appetizers--the trio of hummus came with a pesto hummus, squash hummus, and black bean hummus with lavash bread chips on the side. Each of the hummus dips had great flavor and were also topped with delicious garnishes like goat cheese, bell pepper, and peanuts. We also had the beet salad, which had the perfect dressing and, of course, fresh, juicy beets. Our last appetizer was the famous pistachio meatballs, which were fall apart tender and covered in a sweet and tangy pomegranate sauce. While these were good, I didn't think they were all that special or worth the hype.\n\nFor our main courses, we started with the rack of lamb, which was served over root vegetables and a pesto sauce; the rack of lamb wasn't all that flavorful--definitely not the best lamb I've ever had. We also had the seafood stew, which consisted of mixed seafood (including mussels, clams) served over a tomato broth and couscous--this was a savory, delicious, well-balanced dish. Finally, the stand out of the night for us all was the beef short rib served over a mixture of beans; this may have been the best short rib I've ever had--it was fall apart tender, fatty, and delicious.\n\nOverall, an absolutely excellent meal with a few very memorable dishes, an elegant decor, and good service to boot.", "author": "David K."}

It was an interesting experience for me, given that I don't go out to eat Mediterranean food that often.\n\nWe ordered a few things to share:\n- Beet salad: OK. Beets were prepared perfectly, went well with the greens and balsamic dressing (pretty ordinary), small portion\n- Hummus: pretty good, came with three flavors\n- Pistachio meatballs: a miss - very small portion and just tasted like an ordinary meatball\n- Lamb rack: lamb was very tender, with fantastic pesto sauce\n- Seafood stew: mediocre. Mixture of different seafoods and couscous.\n- Beef short rib: amazing, very juicy and fatty.\n\nOverall, there was a good variety of food and it was tasty. It did come with a high price tag, which for some dishes (lamb, beef) I felt was worth, but for others (meatballs, seafood stew) felt it was overly expensive.\n\nI recommend giving it a try.", "author": "Alvin W."}

One person ordered the 3 cheese toasted cheese sandwich (a special that night)which looked delicious, although he said it was super-rich and he couldn't finish it.

To avoid confrontation I just ate mine and sent my mother's back because it was beyond eating. Now for the flavor, the fries were ok, but the burger tasted like a grilled meat ball with zero flavor.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-12", "description": "The Fly Trap is a nice little restaurant tucked into a busy corner in the SoMa area with great flavors to taste and a rich history. I came here on a Friday night with a reservation for 4. We ended up deciding on ordering 3 appetizers and 3 entrees from their menu. Each of the 6 dishes were a joy to eat as none of it turned out to be disappointing at all! \n\nI started off by trying the beet salad which is very simple in appearance, but surprisingly bursting with flavor. The balsamic dressing coats the greens with a nice acidic flavor while the goat cheese melts on the tongue with its consistency of perfection. The beets also add a wonderful sweet and sour taste to the dish and is cooked to just the right texture to be bit into quite nicely. I then tried the trio of hummus which comes with three different types of hummus to be dipped into with the bowl of pita chips. The chips are nice and crisp, complimenting the hummus quite well. I didn't find the hummus to be all that special, though still delicious overall. One hummus dip did have bits of olives in it that packed a heavy punch to create a wonderful burst of flavor alongside the crunchy bits of the pita. The final appetizer was the pistachio meatballs. The meatballs are quite small to be split amongst four, but they are teeming with flavors I did not expect to make them all the more enjoyable. They are very moist, breaking apart easily with a slight push of the fork and have an element of sweetness to it, coming from the barbecue-like sauce and the honey. Bits of pistachios are sprinkled on top for a bit of a nutty flavor and crunch as well though I felt they didn't add much to the dish.\n\nDone with the apps. Time for the entrees! We tried the rack of lamb which came with three lamb chops with some carrots and potatoes. The meat was prepared very well to produce a nice tender and medium cook. I found it to be very delicious, but more of a typical standard dish that was lacking that little punch of creativity and personality. The seafood stew was excellent with its couscous mixed in with the crab meat, squid, clam, mussels, amongst other pieces of seafood. The dish blended together very nicely with the tomato base and I felt the fresh pulled crab really added that nice seafood flavor throughout the dish which made it stand out from other seafood stews. The star of the night was without a single doubt, the braised short rib. Even before getting a bite, watching the meat separate and fall apart with the cut of the knife was a sight to behold. It just looked so right and so good. It'll make you want to run into kitchen and give a thumbs up to the master braiser of a chef. The meat comes on a bed of beans and vegetables which is perfect for balancing the dish and cleaning the palette with every bite. The balance of sweetness, sourness, and savoriness of the meat alongside its marvelous texture is a taste to behold.", "author": "Joshua M."}

One thing that drives me nuts is when a restaurant asks you how you want your burger cooked, then terribly overcooks it or pays no attention. I asked for a medium burger, expecting a nice pink center, but got an overcooked beyond medium well dry burger. It's a shame. Especially for an $18 burger at nice establishment that should be able to cook a burger. The fries were great, and the toppings were fresh.

Basically, I'm just thinking of Kokkari Estiatorio (still my number one). While The Fly Trap had some of those things, none of the entrees particularly caught my eye. I opted for 2 smalls (the pistachio meatballs and naan w/ fava bean spread + ricotta) and a drink (agave's inferno), which was a perfect amount.\n\nThe pistachio meatballs are interesting and tasty; I haven't had something like those before. The naan was not a traditional naan, but much more fluffy. The fava bean spread was very light and the ricotta had a drizzle of balsamic on it. As for drinks, you could either blindly point at the libations mix (because you probably won't understand what any of the ingredients are - what the hell is velvet falernum), or you can take my waiter's/my recommendation for the agave's inferno! I don't usually drink tequila mixes, but I love spicy and this one packed a punch.\n\nFriendly and non-pushy service. One of the servers asked me if I'd like a small/medium/big spoon to lap up the sauce that came with the meatballs (because if I had asked, I would have looked like a starving child). He came out with a tray, carrying a small, medium, and big spoon.

It's supposed to be Persian fare, but it's more along the lines of American-Mediterranean-fancypants-fusion (if you don't know what that is, I don't, either!!). The dim lights and beautiful wallpaper make for a lovely dining experience, although perhaps you need to know what to order?\n\nFYI - don't call the menu a menu; it's a \"bill of fare.\" And despite the fact that this place only recently became a Mediterranean restaurant, they like to advertise that it was \"established\" in the 1800s - when the menu was entirely steak, beef burgers and eggs (which are no longer options, sorry!) Also, it's not in it's original location. Also, at one point it was an Italian Restaurant. Also, it's nothing like the place it used to be. In any case, we think they're a little confused. \n\nWe started with the beet salad: greens, beets, butternut squash, kale, pumpkin seeds, goat cheese, balsamic dressing. It was good and had I stuck only to this for the main course I would've been happy (though hungry!). For \"beginnings\" (they don't serve appetizers, those are for plebeians) we had charmoula - smoked eggplant puree, walnuts, yogurt & turmeric cream on a slice of sourdough bread. Interesting combination of flavors; something like a baba ganoush sandwich, only it was mostly bread. We also tried the halibut, served with pomegranate, fava beans, kohlrabi, cashews, & fruit salsa. This dish was a disaster. The halibut was dry & chewy despite the strip of salsa on top, and totally lacked flavor.\n\nNeither of us could eat it and both left craving a burrito.", "author": "Ray J."}

We made sure to go to a place that's sexy enough for our one on one time.\n\nZare fits the bill: bold colors, matched with neutrals and wood, a hard to ignore pressed tin ceiling and walls papered with world maps. The design aesthetic pleases the eye and sets you up for a relaxing and romantic time.  The bar area alongside the main dining room can get a bit noisy, but not rambunctious, so ask for the dining area towards the back. \n\nTheir cocktails held some interesting combination of ingredients and were divided into those with Mediterranean flare and classic drinks.  The Cardamom My Dearest with gin, cardamom syrup and lime juice, would be the perfect floral drink for people who also love sweet cocktails, but the too much syrup overpowered the gin. I need to taste the nuances of my gin too!\n\nOn the other hand, the Blonde Manhattan was a knockout!  My girlfriend took a sip of it, looked at me ridiculously and commented, \"you like old man drinks!\"  If by old man, you mean, liking moonshine and cocchi together, why I guess I do like old man drinks!  ;-)\n\nZare's cuisine concentrates on Mediterranean and Persian flavors. Our meal presented our palettes with a mish mash of alluring tastes: smoked trout with shaved cucumber topped with tobiko and dill, a mushroom cake with kohlrabi, pesto and green harissa; arctic char with freekeh, parsley root, lebni and diver scallops with asparagus and prosciutto. The only disappointment were the fried donuts with cinnamon coffee -- a very run of the mill donut holes that I could've gotten from down the street.

After last night, I will never return there and go out of my way to make sure no one I know does. The service provided by Nina was atrocious, discriminatory, and I think she may have been under the influence. We ordered 6 appetizers, 1 of which she forget to bring and had to be reminded to remove from the bill, which took almost two-hours to be served. Multiple tables sat after us and left before us ordering the same dishes we did and being served ahead of us. Once we kindly reminded Nina and asked her about out hummus, which alone took 45 minutes to be served, she got snippy, short and inattentive going forward. All four of us have worked in the service industry, mistakes happen, you apologize with a smile, and move on, but not once did Nina apologize or care to change her tone.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-16", "description": "There are nights when the stars, dollar signs, service, drinks and food all align to create the perfect evening. Then there are nights when the planets and service are both in retrograde, the food is barely ok, and the drinks are hit and miss. Last night at Fly Trap was one of the latter. First, the service - we arrived on a Saturday night around 7:30pm (with a reservation) and about one third of the tables were taken. We were seated and waited, and waited, and waited. Ok, three \"waiteds\" is about 6 - 8 minutes but when our wait was over and the server came to the table it was straight to \"do you know what you want for dinner?\" Hmmm, how about asking us how we are doing and asking us if we'd like a drink? So, we order dinner and drinks and, if the service was the first miss, then the drinks were a hit/miss and the food was mostly a huge miss. Starting with the appetizers - we tried the burrata plate, the avocado salad, and the brussel sprouts. The good - the brussel sprouts were a bit too chard, but good, the burrata (with asparagus and italian ham) was delicious. Not so good - the AVOCADO salad had a quarter of an avocado and greens poorly, if at all, seasoned, the aioli that came with the brussel sprouts had no taste at all (bland mayo, emphasis on the bland). Hit and Miss Drinks - Manhattan looked like a glass of pomegranate juice (oh, I mean half a glass of pomegranate juice) = Miss. Glass of Cab Sauv = Hit. AND back to service - a server, not ours, noticed that we didn't get bread with our burrata app (we were almost done with it). Heard the same server tell her table that there was a menu item that they didn't have but that there was a fava bean dish. Our server hadn't mentioned either. Main Courses - Beef Kabob, Rack of Lamb, and Fish and Chips. The only dish that we finished was the Beef Kabob which wasn't difficult, the skewers were very small (at $10, it should be listed as an appetizer). Main comment on the entrees - WHERE is the SALT? Nothing tasted seasoned and there was no salt at the table. Asked for Malt Vinegar for the fish and chips. \"We don't have any\". WTH? What restaurant doesn't have MV with Fish and Chips on the menu. The fish was heavy, oily even be Fish and Chips standards, and tasteless. The lamb was chewy and tasteless. We left most of both dishes on our plates (asked twice if we wanted boxes . . . no thank you). Folks in other reviews have called this an upscale place, not sure what they are comparing this to but not upscale. I gave it a third star for the guy who refilled our water and asked us if everything was ok - he was nice and cared more about our experience than our own server.", "author": "Kristen A."}

The wording of the contract was very vague and unclear. However, that's still bearable. \n\nWhat wasn't bearable was the attitude the manager that night showed to my friends when they asked about all the extra charges. That is no way to treat your customers who have just spent a large sum of money at your restaurant. I understand there are rules, but the right thing to do is to calmly explain them to your customers and treat them with respect. I can't believe he told us \"maybe it's the alcohol.\" He even told my group that we're lucky to even be eating in the side dining room. Funny thing about that is I specifically requested one long table, but instead they gave us two anyway.\n\nAlso! I did tell the manager a week in advance that my party was going to be 18, but when I found out one friend wasn't going to be able to make it, I let him know immediately a couple days in advance. He still charged our party for 18 people. Now did they really start preparing for our party 2 days in advance? I think not! Nowhere in the contract does it state you have to give a confirmed head count and stick to that head count for an entire week. We're not planning a wedding here.

I'm not sure what caused chef Hoss Zare to move his operation into the former Fly Trap deep into SoMa where he switched his menu up and made it more purely Mediterranean. I still haven't tried dinner here, but I did try his lunchtime Grill & Grain menu twice over the last couple of weeks. He describes it as a food truck with no wheels since you order at the bar, and the limited menu offers only soups, wraps and salads. \n\nNice try but I have to say the results are underwhelming. Thus far, I've tried the $9 Lamb Wrap and the $10 Sardine Wrap (see photo). I just felt the lavash was too dry and the ingredients a little too competitive with each other, especially the sardine wrap where there is broccoli rabe, anchovies and tomatoes competing mightily with the sardines. The walnuts, however, provided a nice contrasting crunch. I had better luck with the $8 Vegetarian Orzo Salad, which managed to taste fresh thanks to the roasted squash, cauliflower, watercress, and harissa-spiced yogurt (see photo). \n\nI have to say the bargain of the menu is the $5 Chickpea Salad (see photo). which mixes eggplant, parsley, barberries and hazelnuts with the marinated chickpeas. The consistency had a greater crunch than I expected. Overall, while I find the ingredients interesting like the use of a Persian pickled vegetable called torshi in the lamb wrap, I think the execution needs work to bring me back a third time to the \"truck\". But I wouldn't dismiss an opportunity to try dinner here either.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...a Mediterranean \"food truck\" in a bar hasn't found its groove yet in the wraps, though salads fare better\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...certainly nicer ambiance than a food truck can provide\nSERVICE - 3 stars...fast and adequate\nTOTAL - 3 stars...think I'll be shopping around some more for lunch", "author": "Ed U."}

It came with a nice salad and a generous portion of the best fries i've eaten in a while...I ordered the rack of lamb, which was also amazing, but next time i'll have the burger!  \n\nAll that said, what made our experience so nice was the service.  Truly great service is hard to come by these days but Daniel our server  was exceptional.  Truly, everyone working in the restaurant worked as a team making sure we lacked for nothing.  \n\nCan't wait to go back!", "author": "William W."}

I ordered short rib on the bone and literally it was about 8-10 bites. My friend ordered fish and it was about the same size of a filet o fish at McDonald's. Both entrees are$24. Also if your order the appetizer meatballs for $10 you get 2 just slightly larger than a golf ball. The food is just ok and doesn't justify the price.

The decor is fabulous albeit the restaurant is very very loud. The place is warm n welcoming and has a very charming courtyard where people were sitting sipping wine when we arrived.  The menu looked interesting.  We asked our waiter what he recommended - he of course suggested the priciest thing on the menu.  No matter. We ordered the meatball w pistachios in a pomegranate sauce for a first course. The sauce was fantastic but the meatballs were very dry to the point of crumbling.  I had the beef cheek that was described as flavored with cinnamon and my date had the short rib.  My dish had some wonderful accompaniments- pickled cauliflower that were beautifully pink and pureed parsnips that were heavenly but the beef cheek was very bland. It had zero flavor - no hint of cinnamon and was seriously in need of salt. My date's short rib was more flavorful and surprising had a hint of cinnamon or star anise but the bed of black eyed peas n pintos it sat on were not fully cooked, some hard in fact.  I didn't drink and my date had two cocktails.  The bill came to a little over $100.  We gave the waiter a $100 and a $50 in payment and he asked if we needed change.  I'll chock his impertinence up to his young age.  I might go back to sit at the bar and try something from the libation menu but I probably wouldn't go to seek out the food or attempt to have conversation.", "author": "Suzy Q."}

A lot of it has to do with the fact that the husband & I had a very special date night here and the bar tender on duty made it even more special. Suffice to say, customer service here has been impeccable.\nThe Fly trap looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, but it has the perfect date night setting on the inside. They usually do reservations for dinner. I did try giving them a call, but since no one answered, we decided to walk in. And while they didn't have tables available, the seating at the bar is just fine. It gives you the opportunity to sample the liquor you are about to consume and switch it up if you don't like it :) Between the husband and I, we tried four of their custom drinks, a take on the usual suspects and walked out rather happily buzzed.\nNow onto their menu. The food here Mediterranean for sure, but with a twist. In that, it's not just kebabs and rice and eggplant bademjans. There's also Risotto and Linguine, ergo, the Italian side of the Mediterranean.\n\nWe decided to stick to a \"light\" dinner. Between us, we ordered the Vegetarian kufteh, Pistachio meatballs with pomegranate, two whole plates of the Shishito peppers, Parmesan coated brussel sprouts, eggplant bademjan and the risotto.\nWe licked our plates clean. Nuff' said.\n\nPrice-wise, you are looking to fork out quite a bit of money. But the meal is completely worth it. And you do get a sufficient amount of food. So, the other reviews that complain about the $$ and that this isn't authentic Mediterranean, y'all need to get your facts right.", "author": "Ranjani S."}

At the very least, treat your guests accordingly. \n\nI made reservations for Valentine's Day at 9pm. My girlfriend (whom I see only once or twice a month) and I were taken around the corner, past several empty candlelit tables, to the back room of the restaurant, which was cramped, stuffy and loud. This is a first for me here as I have always been seated in the main room.\n\nOur server, Brette, was charming and sweet. But after we ordered, we were quickly forgotten. My second martini (which would have helped me through the extremely overpriced and underwhelming dinner) was also forgotten. \n\nHere goes:\n\nMy crab cake was hardly warm and way too salty. A lifeless clump of cold, raw crab meat was placed next to it. Was this on purpose? My girlfriend's salad was literally a bunch of arugula sprinkled with pomegranate seeds. It looked like a giant Christmas tree and could have probably fed both of us as well as our neighboring table.\n\nMy lamb chops were unpleasantly presented and unevenly cooked. They were on the verge of cold. One bite was decent and the next was bland and rubbery. The description read \"pistachio crust\" but the pistachios were sort of sprinkled over the whole dish. Had I been given the chance to send it back I would have.\n\n(My girlfriend's sea bass was decent but the bed of quinoa was very acidic. I had no idea what was going on.)\n\nWhat upset me more than the $100/per person Prix Fix excuse for cuisine was that we weren't acknowledged for a half an hour after our main courses came out. What kind of service is that? I saw the chef come out and schmooze with a table next to us while our water glasses were bone dry. \n\nMichael B. said it best. \n\"I, too, hope to forget this meal soon.

Well, forget all you know about Mediterranean when you are at Zare! Zare has re-invented and re-defined Mediterranean for me! We started with hummus trio, not your traditional bowl of plain hummus with oil on top - we received nicely plated beat hummus (red), squash (guessing it was squash, green color) and their version of a traditional chickpea (yellow), all of them were very different in consistency from the typical hummus; served with crispy lavash chips... Such a great start! \nAlso order meatballs and roasted eggplant, both delicious and I believe every other yelp review talks about them, so... Just order and trust me and a bunch of other Yelpers. \n\nNow, the mains... Lamb ragu served with warm lavash and some kind of sauce is great and come with an eating instruction: take a piece of lavash, pick up a piece of meat from the plate, dip in the broth, put sauce on top and loose yourself in the explosion of taste! \nAlso great is their Mediterranean inspired pasta (vegetarian option is amazing), someone at our table just couldn't stop eating it. Also notable was the boneless short rib served with very delicious spinach and polenta, the meat was just falling apart when touched with the fork. \nAlso tried tomato soup, some salad and brussel sprouts with super tasty sauce. \nDessert - chocolate date cake, rich, nice, but overshadowed by other food served. \nOverall, the food is just out-of-this-world amazing and creative, screaming Mediterranean but unique. \nService is good, atmosphere too.

They are so creative with the tastes and flavors here, I'm always happy to recommend it to coworkers looking for something close to the office and really good\n\nThe service here is always top notch and the restaurant ambiance is for the slightly quieter, trendy crowd..that doesn't get too rambunctious even though they have a full bar.\n\nWhat I've had here:\n1. Fall Salad - This salad seems simple, but the flavors together create a really amazing blend of tastes. You kind of feel like the rat from Ratatouille..when he's trying the cheese and grape together..and colors swirl all around..\n\n2. Warmed pears and figs - The portion on this dish is kind of a joke if you're trying to split it, but what they do give you is absolutely nomsilicious.\n\n3. Bone Marrow - This is probably one of the highlights here, the bone marrow isn't too greasy and has the perfect kick paired with the bread. Mmm, so good.\n\n4. Pistachio Meatballs - No, this is not a pistachio stuck to a toothpick and called a meatball. This is probably another one of their \"must try\" dishes. They only come in three, so order wisely!\n\n5. Tomato Beginning - This is literally a tomato stuffed with a big of yumminess. Great to splitting with two people, but not so much for three. It has a good texture and flavor from the cheese and tuna...this was a close 3rd to items #3 and #4\n\n6. Trio of hummus - I honestly only liked one of the three hummus..but my coworker loveeeed it. She was definitely a fan...especially if you order the fries as an appetizer and eat the hummus with fries. :)\n\n7. Black Cod - the cod here comes w/ a ton of random beans and greens. I liked the way the cod was seared and was happy overall with the dish. Not the best i've had, but definitely far from the worst.\n\nnow...DESSERTS:\n1. Goat Cheesecake - Still one of my favorites of the night. It was really light and fluffy..and the goat cheese gave it a li\n\n2. Chocolate Pistachio Torte - This was still warm and broke apart easily. On first glance, you'd think it was a dry looking brownie..but when you sink your fork into the torte, you know its going to be decadent. :)\n\n3. Baklava - This was a slightly deconstructed baklava that was perfectly crisps and sweet..mmm, this was the waitresses favorite and may have been my 2nd favorite!", "author": "Jennifer S."}

It's fooling the eye a bit because these were not sweet potatoes, but plain potatoes. Our table also ordered sides of brussel sprouts and french fries. These were not sides my friends, but almost near platter size. It was an insane amount of food and pretty wasteful. The brussel spouts were overly charred and had a deep fried oily taste, but it's yogurt aioli was good and cooled it a bit. The french fries were easily delicious.

Zar\u00e9 was the perfect venue for my group of ten friends. It's easy to find parking in FiDi after 6pm and the restaurant was very accommodating to our needs even though we were making a reservation the day before the event. Now that's what I call customer service done right.\n\nWe started off with the plate of three pistachio meatballs glazed with a honey and pomegranate sauce. Crunchy on the outside with the chopped pistachio topping; tender and moist on the inside - these were a real treat to the taste buds. I don't think I could ever tire of eating these meatballs, although at $3/meatball, my wallet certainly would. For those who are looking for a cheaper appetizer that had bigger portions, I recommend the french fries served with saffron aioli. I know, I know. Fries? At a fancy restaurant?! What are you thinking? But trust a self-proclaimed fry expert on this: the fries were seasoned well with a perfect blend of spices that would make anyone salivate just thinking about them.\n\nI highly recommend any of the lamb dishes, even the Zar\u00e9 lamb burger. I ordered the braised lamb ragu (abgoosht is just a fancier word for a meat stew), and it came with a side of lavash and pickled vegetables. Our waiter gave us some helpful recommendations for eating the lavash and lamb together, and I truly had a great experience here.

Doesn't give me hope that I can contribute anything new, but I can just add my experience to the catalog of success that this restaurant is.\n\nIt's featured in a numerous guidebooks as a great place for crafted food, and I was not disappointed.  I felt very lucky to get a reservation on just a couple hours notice on a Saturday night, and sat down to the essentially candle-lit ambiance that Zare is.  Local/seasonal menu with handcrafted cocktails, great art and design, excellent service.  Everyone raves about the meatballs so I of course had to have that, but I also relished the opportunity to order goat, an underappreciated protein, in a format other than as part of a curry.\n\nGreat experience, reasonably priced.  \n\nPS  For those of us who don't live here, it was interesting to see the light glow of iPads at various tables around of us.  If people weren't being pitched on investments, they were being shown how to use a loved app.  Interesting.\n\nPPS  Minutes' walk from BART.", "author": "Stephen H."}

Helpful, funny and sassy wrapped into one.\n\nI was excited for Mediterranean on this particular evening, but Zare was so much more than I bargained for. It is an exotic blend of Mediterranean and Persian. Not exactly sure what makes food one over the other, but the mixture sure did work.\n\nWe started off with an app that was an earthly medley of goodness. Shaped like a ball and accompanied by an avocado concoction, it was the perfect opening act. I ordered two more apps as my entree (pistachio meatballs and lamb sausage...what? I was feeling meaty!). The pistachio meatballs were divine and soaked in a pomegranate dressing that was extremely rich, and delicious! The texture of the lamb was too much like sausage to me, so I didn't eat a lot of it, but the taste was spicy and flavorful. No room for dessert, but they looked playful and full of sin! My sister did order one of their specialty cocktails and she loved every sip.\n\nWouldn't have found this bad boy on my own, so a big shout out to Yelp for being so yelpy!", "author": "Katie B."}

I also tried to come back here for a second meal and they were randomly closed (to be fair it was holiday party season so that's probably why). I don't remember too much from my meal here but I shared a few dishes with a friend and then moved to the bar for some after dinner drinks. The cocktails here are great, well made and I would come back for them. Pistachio meatballs were probably a 3/5, pretty good but not the best meatballs I've had by any measure. The honey and pomegranate combined to make them a little too sweet for me, and I normally am a fan of sweet and savory dishes. I did enjoy the bone marrow and would come back to order that again, along with maybe another appetizer and their cocktails. My entree was not too memorable (I actually don't remember what I got) and I would probably skip the entrees next time.

You can bring a date here, or a gaggle of friends. I came with 4 other friends on a Friday night and we were seated almost immediately, but the restaurant was pretty full otherwise.\n\n- Pistachio Meatballs ($14): Three meatballs, topped with pomegranate seeds and honey. I'm a big sucker for savory-sweet, so this was all my jam. I'm not a big meatball person, nor am I that fond of pistachios, but this combination coated with the sweet sauces was a thoughtful balance of Mediterranean flavors, cooked in a California method.\n\n- Bone Marrow ($15): The actual bone and bread was kind of whatever compared to other places (a bit too oily/fatty), but whatever seasonal jam on that plate was amazing. I'm pretty sure it was apple jam. The sweet flavor cut through the heavy fat, and now I am 100% convinced that fruit is the best thing to have with bone marrow.\n\n- Cinnamon Braised Beef Cheek ($28): Beef cheek is a new discovery of mine, and like anywhere else, Fly Trap's beef cheek is a tender delightful lump of meat with the texture of pulled pork. The spice from the cinnamon added a great earthy base, and the mashed potato-esque pile on the side is actually mashed pears (I'm pretty sure it's pears. Definitely not potatoes).\n\nI've never had food prepared quite like this before - it's innovative yet simple enough that you recognize all the ingredients.

I chose it off of Yelp! based on its proximity to AT&T Park (we had just seen Cirque du Soliel's KURIOS and had a going-away party for a friend waiting for us, so proximity was important). The name is odd, but the reviews convinced us to try it. It was a longer walk from the show than I realized, but that was no big deal. \n\nI love fun cocktails, and this time by gosh I was having one. I had \"Minted Memory\" which I enjoyed very much. I believe, but am not sure, that JR had the Abarino wine. \n\nSince we had a party to go to where there was an anticipated home-cooked nacho bar & treats, we decided to go light on the food. We shared a blood orange salad that was delicious. \n\nChoosing from the \"Beginnings\" section proved challenging, because so many of them sounded good. We ended up having the Roasted Eggplant \"Kashk Bademjan\" and the Pistachio meatballs. Both of these were appetizers were terrific. Everything we had was presented beautifully. \n\nMy guy is a history buff, and middle-East buff, and so I got a pretty detailed education about Persia/Iran, etc., ,etc., etc. during the meal, including food ingredients, common dishes, and things like that. :-)\n\nThe waitress was great--pleasant, friendly, attentive, and fun. I think it was the chef(?) that came to the table with our meatballs and asked how we liked the food. It looked like a chef's jacket, anyway, but my fellow said maybe he is the owner. I liked the decor, the ambiance, all of it.\n\nI heard my guy on the phone to his brother, telling him about The Fly Trap--that alone is testament. I heard him say he thought the food was excellent, that it was comfortable there, that the atmosphere was relaxing, classy but not at all stuffy. It's a keeper!

Especially since I've been here at least 4x!\n\nIt is a restaurant like no other in SF... Has a very European Bistro feel, great ambiance and buzzing energy... Yet it's so Romantic and quaint. \n\nIt's hard to single out any one dish in particular as there are so many unique yet familiar dishes on the menu. Definitely has a strong Iranian influence as far as spices and ingredients go but it is a more contemporary california fusion and seasonal menu.\n\nFor starters, salad shirazi, pistachio meatballs, and stuffed calamari \n\nEntrees- braised short rib and braised lamb are just wonderful. I recently tried the seafood couscous dish and I'm still dreaming about it. Btw- the Abgoosht (braised lamb) is crazy good. Didn't know it was possible to make a classic Iranian village dish into an elegant masterpiece. Was pleasantly surprised!! \n\nOh I forgot to mention the French fries... You just have to try them. They are like McDonalcds fries but freshly made, crispy and the saffron aioli is perfect! \n\nAnd if you leave without dessert... You're missing out. Goat cheesecake is fantastic.\n\nOne of the most special parts of the dinners here is when Mr Chef Zare comes and says his hellos to your table. You can see him in and out of the kitchen throughout the night and his smile and energy is contagious.\n\nI think the servers could be more attentive.. But again, that's the strong European bistro vibe.. It is a definite 2+ hour meal. They aren't rushing to turn tables around, which I respect. But sometimes I felt the waiting service was inadequate to the standards of the restaurant. \n\nAnd ps. This is NOT by any means traditional Iranian food ... As there is no koobideh and rice dish to be found on the menu, however, the menu is definitely inspired by the Chef's culture and his own favorite dishes... And he is a true Persian chef. As an Iranian, it is easy to see the familiarities of his dishes to classic Persian Cuisine.", "author": "Shanna N."}

I am in no way being hyperbolic when I say that the goat cheesecake is one of the best desserts I have had in my entire life!  I am a profound lover of all things goat (cheese, yogurt etc), and often find goat cheesecake to not be 'goaty' enough if you will.

The panna cotta was also sublime, perfect texture and smoothness as well, and great topping of honey drizzle and pistachio.  \n\nNeedless to say, I can't wait to go back and try more!

You step up to the bar to place your order, take a number, find a seat and wait for your meal to be delivered to your table. The options are quite light - I rather enjoyed my order of a cous cous salad. However, there are options to make it a little more substantial and to that end I highly recommend the French fries because they are accompanied by a delicious aioli. We always had Brussels sprouts to share, but they were on the daily specials menu and so may not always be available.\n\nLunch here isn't exorbitantly priced, but neither is it cheap.

The service was OK but frankly after coming back from France I found it a bit rushed, I enjoy taking time between my dishes and even when we asked to slow it down it was still a bit rushed.\n\nThe dishes: \nThe meatballs were great, tender, nice balance of flavor and a interesting take on the sauce, a nice surprise. \nThe kashk bademjan was just a mess, the dish had no flavor to me, it was very bland, messy, nothing was nicely plated, the eggplant was just piled on the bread, we had no idea how to eat it. \nThe bone marrow was nice, but the baguette served with it was just not good and the preserve that was served with it was more sweet and didn't really cut the richness of the marrow.  I would have liked to have something more citrus or even berry that would complement it.\nThen the scallops I think for us were the most disappointing.  There was only three scallops in the entire dish, then there were both roasted and mashed potatoes and asparagus.  It felt more like the protein was the afterthought not the center of the dish and the flavors again were all flat and bland. \n\nWe also had a few glasses of wine, while the sauvignon blank was great the reds were overpriced and not very good selections by the glass.\n\nAll and all for the $120 tab we've had much better dinners and definitely are not looking to come back here.", "author": "Inga W."}

Well, as optional sides. The plates themselves, which run around $8, are just a wrap and a salad. A delicious wrap, and a tasty salad made from fresh greens. I sampled the steak wrap a compatriot was eating, but had to go with the sardine and anchovy option myself. Both were tasty, filling, and served up by some super friendly and genuine guys.

From the food to the staff and the owner chef Zare every element is so inviting and charming and makes you want to go back again. ( Well, that's the reason I don't ever miss this restaurant when I travel to the Bay Area.) He gives his customers special hugs which he calls \"hossy hugs\" and he makes you feel so comfortable even if it is your first time to this restaurant.  I also thought it is it was a perfect place to take your date to since it has a nice romantic yet simple and elegant ambiance. \nEach time I have been there, the staffs have been amazingly warm and friendly. The food presentation is terrific, but what stand out the most are the flavors that just marry together so well. I have tried the wild mushroom cake and I absolutely loved it and highly recommend it. The green harissa sauce that was on it was not just an ordinary spicy sauce; it was a spicy sauce full of flavors.  The pistachio meatballs just melted in my mouth and I adored the pomegranate sauce that was on it. It was tangy and so tasteful and the cucumber linguini was so light and delicious. Let me tell you something. I don't what know what they do to their food, but I don't even like brussel sprouts and I almost ate the whole bowl of brussel sprouts with that delicious yogurt sauce next to it! One time, when I was there, they had a special \"foie gras with smoked salmon\" and I was a little hesitant to try it, but I wanted to be adventurous and gave it a try and on my God! It was heaven in my mouth! And of course for the dessert, I absolutely loved the goat cheese cheesecake.

Although we were a bit split in our views on the meatball, overall the meat was on the dry and crumbly side and we didn't particularly like that neither of us could figure out the type of meat it was from the flavor. The pomegranate sauce that came with it was powerfully acidic and sweet, but wasn't balanced with the taste of the meat. Mostly it left us wishing there was some spicy in the meatballs to tie the dish together.\n\nWe also had a wild mushroom cake which had pesto, green harissa, and arugula. The mushroom cake itself was great with a meaty salty texture (that we wished the meatballs had had) with a nice crunch on the outer shell. It went nicely with the paired greens.\n\nThe head to tail goat included quinoa, cucumber-yogurt with lavash, a bitter broccolini-like greens, and a sweet red sauce. We thought this dish was yummy and loved the lavash to make little wraps. The goat was flavorful but a bit on the dry side and again we thought a spicy sauce might have been better pairing for the dish.\n\nThe rare seared tuna came with cauliflower, lentils, and shaved fennel. It was well seasoned and tasty although we disagreed with how well the components of the dish came together. One of us thought the lentils blended nicely with the tuna (with similar texture) the other person just felt the different components didn't fit together. \n\nLastly, we had a Persian Breakfast (Gin, honey, egg white, lemon, bergamot) and the Cardamom my dearest (gin, cardamom, lime). Both were tasty but the cardamom was lacking in cardamom and the Persian Breakfast was a bit too sweet.\n\nFor such an upscale restaurant, it was incredibly noisy and hard to hear each other even though we sat on the same side of the table. Overall, the food varied from okay to great (meatballs to mushroom cake) but we felt that the standard for the place needed to be higher for the prices charged. Overall, we would have given the place a 3.5 but the high prices led us to decide finally settle on a 3. (Note we consider 2 stars to be the average restaurant)", "author": "Amy D."}

The bone marrow was tasty and came with a melon side that made an interesting combination with the marrow. \n\nFor entrees we had the beef cheek and seafood with couscous. Both the marrow and the cheek were overly garnished with small green leaves that covered the entire dish to a point where when they were all collected together it made a small side salad. Again, the cheek wasn't bad but not memorable. The crab in the seafood medley didn't taste fresh. There was a large amount of couscous in it. Also, I was expecting fine grain couscous and they ended up being very large. The portions were pretty large and by the end of dinner we had no room for the goat cheesecake, which is apparently their specialty.\n\nWe ordered a house specialty cocktail which was watery and had little flavor other than lime. One major irritant for the evening was the dining was extremely hot and stuffy for all of dinner service. To top it off the window next to our table was broken and couldn't be opened. The best aspect of the restaurant was the wait staff which was friendly, prompt and helpful. They went out of their way to open a bottle when we wanted a type of wine that wasn't available on the glass list.\n\nOverall, for the price of the restaurant the food was underwhelming.", "author": "Michael S."}

The braised lamb is also a good choice. \n\nAlso I'm not always one to go for dessert, but don't skip it here. The goat cheesecake might sound gross but it's not. The goat cheese is super light and it tastes like a regular delicious fluffy cheesecake with just the slightest hint of a different kind of cheese at the end. Very nice.

Really tender and delicious meat.\n- The sauce is savory, and the veggies in the sauce a little plain (and a little undercooked - the lima beans were pretty hard.\n- My friend had ordered duck but his meatball came with short rib, which he didnt mind nor complain about. But as he was finishing this, the server came and said they realized he had ordered the duck, and gave him an extra serving of duck leg in sauce, wild rice, cauliflower, and greens!

The bar draws a good after-work crowd, which sometimes spills onto the ever-present \"communal tables\" in the front, while the long, narrow dining room holds closely spaced white linen clad tables arranged in intimate groupings.  A rear seating area is somewhat cave-like and devoid of atmosphere, so it's best to be seated in the main room.\n\nFrom appetizers to scrumptious desserts, the food is delicious.  Topped with a tarragon-mustard vinaigrette, the crisp butter lettuce salad with crispy Parma prosciutto was a refreshing start to the meal.  \"Yesterday's soup\" was a cream of heirloom tomato topped with basil oil that was was the essence of summer.  Grilled Moroccan-style wild salmon served atop a bed of Israeli cous-cous and black-eyed peas was done to perfection--cooked all the way through, but still moist and juicy.  If only all vegetarian food were as good as the piquantly spicy vegetarian kufteh tabrizi with Mediterranean avocado salsa, mushrooms, and seven spice emulsion ...  Though delicious, it was the largest kefteh known to man and too large to finish.\n\nThe reasonably priced wine list is not extensive, but has selections that complement the somewhat spicy fare.  Consisting of bottles from France, Italy, and Spain, as well as other Mediterranean countries, it offers up a range of flavors and styles that will suit most diners.\n\nThe young, energetic wait staff was at once fun and knowledgeable about the menu.  Service was spot on.  Water glasses were always filled, and diners were never left wanting for wine.  Dishes arrived at appropriate times--not fast enough to be rushed, not slow enough cause patrons to fall asleep between courses.\n\nDefinitely not a tourist trap, Zar\u00e9 at Flaytrap with its innovative flavor combinations is worthy of your hard-earned dining dollars.", "author": "CJ G."}

Talk about first-class service! I was also impressed how much of an effort the head chef, Hoss, made to go to each table and meet all the diners.\n\nStarted the meal with their mussels and while decent and fresh... nothing to write home about. I enjoyed the mussels at Garcon (in the Mission) more. For my main, I got the pan-roasted cod and it came with mashed potatoes and some type of asparagus and fava bean gelee. It was delicious... everything was seasoned well (including the sides) and my fish wasn't overcooked.\n\nMy roommate ordered the short ribs, which came with a delicious Persian rice and some type of vegetable/bean stew. I found myself constantly picking at her plate. I really enjoyed the short rib and the whole combination with rice. I would order that again.\n\nFor dessert, I got the \"not your grandma's pie\" and it turned out to be a deconstructed pie! I was definitely surprised. The plate came with lemon curd, coconut meringue, coconut sorbet, and a drizzle of saffron-mint syrup. But everything was separate. While not bad at all, I think I'm just a normal pie enthusiast and would have enjoyed it more in its normal pie form. My roommate got the peach cobbler and that was amazing! I'm not a big crust person normally but it was super buttery and \"homey\" tasting. \n\nOur friend (the regular) described the food perfectly-- it's not Persian food, but it's more Western food with a Persian flair (and spices). I could not agree more. This isn't traditional Persian food at all.\n\nI really enjoyed my dining experience here and would love to go back more often but it's definitely on the pricier side.

Hummus platter wasn't awesome, we're perhaps a little snobby when it comes to hummus because we eat so often and make it so well at home. The platter had really small portions and was just ok, texture on two of the three just wasn't quite right. I also wasn't a fan of the chopped olives in one of them.  The calamari was awesome! Definitely recommend it, perfectly cooked and a lovely sauce/marinade with it.\n\nFor entrees I had the rigatoni, hubby had the beef cheeks. Cousins got the chicken and lamb. Rigatoni was ok, it had a nice kick to it, but the pasta was super plain, normally homemade pasta has this awesome richness to it and I found this one a little lacking. The beef cheeks were good, really delicious. \n\nLamb was ok, I feel like Bay Area restaurants have a lot of great lamb dishes, probably because of the diversity of customers, so I have high expectations of lamb, this way just ok.\n\nFor dessert we shared the flour less chocolate torte cake, meh. Bland. Dry. Perhaps that's a flour less thing?\n\nAll in all.

I would say this is an acquired taste. ;)\n-Roasted cauliflower: This was unfortunately quite disappointing, lacked flavor that usually comes with roasted buttery anything.\n\nAtmosphere: Dimly lit, charming decor, intimate ambiance.

I ordered the pisco sour which was very smooth and sweet. Just right for a starting drink. I had to try the pistachio meatballs because it was recommended by 7x7. My friend ordered the dolmeh because the server made it sound so good. It was delicious, the quinoa, greek yogurt, and everything else complemented each other very well. The pistachio meatballs were very good and I really enjoyed the sauce, but I liked my friends appetizer more. \n\nFor the main entree, I ordered the braised rabbit pasta and my friend ordered arctic char. The pasta was very well made, it wasn't too soft nor too hard, the pasta had a very good texture. The rabbit was well made and a very good recommendation from the server. \n\nDessert was also one of the best parts of our meal. I ordered the pistachio buttered crepe with pistachio ice cream. I was surprised that the crepe caught my attention more than the ice cream. I've never liked pistachios this much before. My friend ordered the baklava. She loved every bit of it and what really made it better was the fact that the chef actually came out and describe the makings of the baklava. \n\nThe service was excellent, they always refilled our water carafe before it was empty and was very attentive to us yet respectful of our privacy and conversation.

We planned to go to Manor West that night and Zare was nearby, had good reviews, so Zare it was. \n\nDRINKS: \nZare has a very unique cocktails like Persian Breakfast (grape vodka, honey, and egg white), Minted Memory (gin, pimm's #1, and malted vinegar syrup), and Cardamam My Dearest (gin, cardamam, and lime). \n\nI opted for the Persian Breakfast. It was ok; I didn't taste the grape in the vodka and it wasn't as stiff as I would like it to be. Although the egg white did add some oomph to the drink and made it taste like a light dessert.\n\nFOOD: \n*Fries w/ Aioli sauce: The fries were skinny fries and were very crispy and light. The aioli sauce had a hint of garlic and spice and was perfect complement to the fries.\n\n*Filet Mignon w/ Gorgonzola, Dates, Watercress, and Potato Gratin (which I substituted w/ green beans): WOW! The filet mignon was cooked to a perfect medium rare and had a nice outer crust which sealed in the juices. It was tender and full of flavor. The filet was accompanied with a wine mushroom reduction which was savory, and very rich in flavor as opposed to salty. The dates added just the right of sweetness to the dish and the watercress helped balance out the richness of the dish. I opted out of the gratin and got the green beans lightly saut\u00e9ed in olive oil. They were a vibrant green color and was cooked to an al-dente. My only complaint--did someone steal the gorgonzola cheese from my plate b/c there were none?!?!?!\n\nI would have liked to try the goat cheese cheesecake based on the good reviews, but we brought in a b-day cake. As a side note, there is a slicing fee of $3/person.\n\nSERVICE:\nThe hostess (Mario?) is the most tolerant person I know. I must have changed the reservations about 4 times and he was very accommodating and never gave me the slightest attitude. Even when we got there, our party size changed again and I informed him and he said, \"it was quite alright\".\n\nOur waiter had spilled a beaker of water on one of the guys in our party...and the resolution? The manager gave his sincere apologies and a half bottle of wine to boot! Wow...that's going beyond the call of customer service!!!\n\nHowever, service can be quite slow esp with a large party. It took about 40-45 min for our party of 13 to get our entrees.\n\nAMBIANCE: \nZare is very charming, and quaint. There is significant room between tables, so you don't feel closed in or have to overhear your neighbors' convo.  D\u00e9cor is very simple yet elegant; wooden tables, wooden floors, crisp white table cloths, red pillars, and antique style paintings that surround the wall.\n\nPARKING: \nEasy street parking on weekends since surrounding local businesses/offices are only open from M-F. \n\nOverall, I would recommend Zare as a great date place because prices aren't too bad (entrees $20-$27), and you can enjoy great food while having an audible conversation in an charming, cozy environment.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

We were talking about how good the appetizers were until we got the main dish: braised short rib, braised beef cheek, braised lamb abgoosht, and summer vegetable spaghetti. OH MY OH MY... You can cut the beef with a spoon it's sooooooo soft!! So flavorful so delicious!! With every bite you hear all your cells shouting \"thank you thank you!\" \nI couldn't believe i'd be more impressed after the appetizers, but I was... All of us were..! \nThen came the desert menu. We were all full but couldn't resist trying the chef's spin on the traditional deserts; yet again another fantastic experience. We got the baclava, yogurt pudding and the rice noodle faloodeh. We got a complimentary apple pudding too. Can't say enough how great this experience was. The baclava is the lightest you'll ever try. The yogurt pudding so mildly sweet. Faloodeh was tart, as we were told, and we loved it.

The so called lemon confit vinaigrette that was pour all over the dish was really overpowering both in smell and taste, I wouldn't be surprised if they told me it was straight vinegar. \n\n$29 pork shoulder entree - way too fatty, there were chunks of fat that made it hard to eat and it was overcooked making the meat chewy. The veggies were nicely al dente and wild rice cooked well but it was too oily. Their rock shrimp was decent, some pieces a bit too salty.

I think I'll be hitting that up soon! \n\nMains: Ordered the lamb, arctic char, pork chop and the risotto. \nLamb: I'm not sure why others had an issue with this. I thought it was perfectly done and flavorful. Loved all the veggies that came with it, too. They give you a side of this pickled sauce and some lavash so you can make your own lamnb \"tacos\". My mouth is watering just thinking about it!\n\nPork chop: The waitress said it was about 7 oz. She's on crack. This was a HUGE pork chop that was cooked to perfection. Juicy, succulent and perfectly seasoned. \n\nArctic char: Never had arctic char before but it had really nice crispy skin and the flavor and color were reminiscent of salmon. Served with bulgar and some parsnips. Ont he lighter side. Very good though! \n\nRisotto cakes: HUGE portion. Lots of veggies and mushrooms to go along with these perfectly golden risotto cakes. It's really worth it!\n\nDesserts: Skip the pistachio crepes. The ice cream was gritty and the crepes were blah. What stood out were the baklava and the cheese cake. Both were awesome! \n\nI can't wait to go back here again!", "author": "Amy B."}

This place was #1 :) we walked less than 5 minutes from the Marriott hotel. With out a reservation we got seated at around 7:45 no problem. Everyone was very friendly. This place according to the menu is the 5th oldest restaurant in SF. First started by an Italian immigrant back in 1883 changed locations once due to the fire passed down through loyal employee's.  The current owner/chef has created a brilliant menu of Mediterranean food with a modern touch from his Persian roots. Excellent hand crafted cocktails. Through out our evening we had the chef and the bartender at our table. They take great pride in personal connection with the customer which was one of the original establishments\nmantras.  The menus has plenty to choose from great dishes with excellent flavors. We tried the Lamb Tongue it was excellent, Warm Dates/ pear salad also very good. I don't remember what else we got but everything was great.  Pretty good value ( I love me some Value !) it would be hard but if you skip cocktails you can easily get a lovely dinner for two for a great price. But trust me you don't want to miss the drinks :)  The atmosphere was excellent also with some nice tunes playing in the background.  \nLooking forward to going here again for sure !!", "author": "James F."}

We had brought a 2000 Chateau Musar that unfortunately leaked through the cork. The wine was pretty oxydized. Our server politely told us that it would probably be fine though it obviously wouldn't be. It was a wine we had been saving for a special occasion and I appreciated him letting us figure out if we would drink it or not anyway (we did). \nCentral Asian food is wonderful for it's unusual use of spices and sauces. We had kashkeh bademjan, the pistachios meat balls, Pearl Cous Cous Cacciucco, Abgoosht and for desert Faloudeh. All of them were excellent. I knocked off one star for the one off note for the night. I ordered a Sauternes which came far too cold. A Sauternes very distant from room temperature is pretty amateur and puzzled me because everything up to that point had been perfect. After taking a few minutes to warm up the Sauternes so I could smell and taste it, I immediately understood the issue; the nose was good but it was probably the poorest Sauternes I've ever tasted. It struck me as wrong to simply chill a substandard Sauternes rather than sell the rest of your bottles to a local store and get some acceptable wines.", "author": "Marlin L."}

We shared a 2004 Tempranillo, which had a great plumy bouquet, a chocolatey middle and a soft silky finish.  It went great with my lamb burger with sumac, persian pickles and french fries.  My buddy ordered the braised duck legs with basmati rice, almonds, candied citrus and barberries.  I tried part of his dish and found it to be much tastier than the lamb.  For dessert we split a a starter (men are so different than women).  We shared the cinnamon braised lamb tongue, which was amazing.  The wine worked well for the entire meal.  \n\nThe atmosphere at Zare on a Thursday night at 9:30pm was lively but not crowded.

Cool, I'm in to it...  \n\nI visited Zare @ Fly Trap with two friends while visiting San Fran -- I would say it was pretty tasty, just over priced.

Zare left us all wanting...  \n\nFlavors just weren't what we expected (they all needed \"a swift kick in the ass\" as one friend said) and since when do you order mussels with little to no broth (the irony was that there was bread served with it, but no broth to dip it in, which is the point of the bread!).  We also ordered several veggie dishes and a salad with trout, which was unusual.  I am open to new flavors, but these dishes all needed more intense flavor...  we all felt like we missed out when we left and didn't feel the rush to get back there any time soon.\n\nAll in all, nice place, cute/ cozy, just too pricey for what it is.

The menu is ever-changing, and produce is sourced from the Bay Area's farmers markets - keeping things fresh and local. I've dined at Zare at Fly Trap twice: once for dinner with my beautiful college roomies and another for lunch with my awesome coworkers. Both times were completely different experiences but equally satisfying. \n\nLunch: It's a more casual environment, where you order at the bar and the server brings out your order to your table. Much like any other counter service. This time, we were in a larger group of eight and the place was semi-empty (word hadn't caught on of their new lunch hours), so the server offered to just take our orders from our table. They have a light and affordable menu, and I opted for a chicken wrap with a side salad. Only disappointment was my tea. I thought I'd get authentic Persian tea - with the rose water and all - but instead it was from a tea bag. However, it was a gorgeous day; the weather was perfect, the sun was shining and overall it was a great lunch. Everyone in our lunch group recommended Zare to the other coworkers planning out their lunch groups for the week.\n\nDinner: When the sun sets, the restaurant is a completely different experience. Dinnertime is sex-ay. It's dark, the restaurant has a rich aroma of Persian spices and light incense; and if it's a Friday night, they've got a full house. We started with a couple of plates of Pistachio Meatballs. Do order this. The texture from the pistachios is unique without the flavor being overbearing; but the highlight of this dish is the sweet, semi-syrupy pomegranate glaze. You'll find bits of pomegranate - and go ahead, it 'em with seeds and all. They're cook just right so you won't taste the bitterness of the seeds. There are plenty of fish entrees for the pescatarians in your group; this time, I went for ... wait. I can't even remember. I think it was the night's special scallops - but I honestly can't even tell you. Goes to show it was those meatballs that left a lasting impression on me.

Mediterranean food is one of my favorites because of its succulent juicy grilled meat, yummy hummus, and awesome pita bread. I usually eat it on special occasions and this was one of them. In summary, dinner serving my favorite foods + good company got me excited. But what seemed to be a slam-dunk event, turned out to be one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.\n\nThe ambience of the restaurant set the tone for what I thought was going to be an awesome night. The restaurant was small and lightly dimmed, and it created an intimate dining atmosphere. When the birthday boys walked in, we ordered a couple cocktails at the bar. The lady bartender was very welcoming, and she made our drinks with loving tender care, but unfortunately she was the only one who took pride in her work.\n\nOur dinner selection was a pre-set menu. Because I'm a guy, I went straight for the meat: Meatballs for appetizer, Filet Mignon as the main course, and \"Not Your Grandma's Pie\" for dessert. None of them were good, in fact calling it bad would be a compliment.\n\nI know yelpers have raved about their pistachio meatballs, and I have no idea why. To me, the meatballs were emasculating. It took away every ounce of manhood I had due to the smallness, dryness, and tastelessness of the balls. I'm sure the few women in the bay area can testify that these types of balls are usually ranked on the bottom of the totem pole. Why waste money when you can have juicier bigger balls for free? \n\nThe disappointing appetizer didn't faze me. I was looking forward to my filet mignon, and I rallied on to meet my piece of meat. Sadly, I don't need to do much explaining because my friend's yelp review described it the best:\n\n\"Main course: filet mignon. I say filet mignon only because that's what they call it on the menu - a more appropriate description would be \"gravy drenched meatloaf\". Curiously, the waiter never asked how I'd like the filet to be cooked. It appears he assumed I wanted \"cooked until the filet tastes equivalent to meatloaf. \"\n~ Joseph\n\nFinally, our dessert! I SWITCHED my order to the \"Not Your Grandma's Pie\" because the waitress said it was their signature dish. What she failed to mention me was that this dish came straight out of the Fear Factory show. It seriously looked like a glob of mucus, and it tasted like it too.\n\nAt the end of day, whatevers. I can live with eating bad food. What I can't tolerate is arrogance (mainly the GM Ryan). Our bill was charged for 18 meals, even though we had 17 people. This turned out to be ~$95 per person, not including drinks. Naturally, we wanted an explanation of the bill. \n\nAccording to Ryan, it was in our contract to pay for 18. Fine, but if we're paying, we should get the extra plate or get it in a to go box. He claimed the 18th plate was the one replaced by Joseph who sent back his first steak because it was cooked wrong. And let's again point out that Joseph wouldn't have had to send back the steak if the waitress had asked him how he'd like it in the first place ... or if the chef knew how to cook a steak.\n\nHis remark caused a huge uproar among my friends, and at end of it, he accused my other friend for being drunk and refused to give us our 18th meal because they don't do take out. If that is true, than your yelp info at the top is false advertisement.", "author": "JF K."}

We each had Persian tea, an appetizer (get the kashk bademjan [eggplant] dish!), an entree and a dessert, and the bill came to just above $100. Not too shabby. The chef also came by our table before we received our entrees to greet us. He and my dad had a nice chat in Farsi. \n\nThe space itself is classy, warm and inviting. Not pretentious in the least.

Seriously so decadent and sinfully sweet. I tried the chocolate cake and baklava with rose syrup. Both were good but the baklava really stood out. Absolutely delicious!

Every night when I brush my teeth, I look at it for a full two minutes (as required to let the fluoride in the toothpaste fully absorb), traveling visually through the shapes of countries and names of remote places. With a quick sideways glance, I leap from the Isla de los Estados in South America to Boosaaso, a port city along Africa's eastern coast, while along the way marveling at how the epic Trojan War was centered in that tiny little blot known as the Aegean. My favorite destination, however, is the Mediterranean. From Lebanon to the Pillars of Hercules, it housed some of the greatest civilizations of the ancient world. More importantly, it offers many of the world's most robust and savory cuisines.\n\nZar\u00e9 at Fly Trap offers a culinary vacation of the entire Mediterranean coast. From Southern French and Italian to Moroccan and hints of the Middle East, the exoticism of their food (and drink) menu is wholly compelling.

Unfortunately, Zare has recently changed their menu and hasn't caught up yet with vegetarian options (unlike the menu set up on the website, there is no separate vegetarian menu). Don't worry, I've got you covered, in order to avoid disappointment, I ended up sharing all of the vegetarian choices with another one of my dining companions so can give a little guidance  with the new choices. The real stand out was the mushroom cake that was accompanied with raw kohlrabi. The cake is a strong savory, mushroomy goodness topped with kohlrabi pesto. The soup of the day was quite good but I can't promise  they'll repeat that one so I'll move on to the next best option, the eggplant, which is roasted to a creamy deliciousness. The salad had a nice mix of fruits (e.g., orange, cranberry seeds). I thought that the saffron rice, which is fried into little rice paddies, was the least impressive of the choices. As the only vegetarian entree I'd suggest sticking with the appetizers and piecing together a little vegetarian sampler.\n\nOf note, the ambiance in Zare was quite boisterous, we had 6 at our table and the noise level made it difficult to talk even amongst our party. A nice place if you're looking for great food and a lively atmosphere but not the perfect place to carry on a conversation.

It would have been 5-stars if faloodeh was done well. \n\nThe Fly Trap has something unique compared to other restaurants and that is mastering flavors.

That only happens when I don't know quite what to say (in other words, rarely).\n\nAll of the elements of a great dining experience were there.  Great company (hi, Natasha S.!), cool decor, interesting and innovative menu, good, informed and enthusiastic service.  Not to mention the Daily Candy and Thrillist reviews, and all of the positive Yelps...I was sure we were going to LOVE it.\n\nThe food was off for us, with every single dish.  We shared the Menage a Foie as a starter, which was a foreshadowing of the meal to come.  The dish is made up of 3 livers in 3 preparations:  foie, sheep's liver, and chicken liver.  An omnivore's delight, right?  No.  There was just too much going on in the dish, too many flavors, and they just didn't mesh well.\n\nFor my entree, I chose the Pappadam-crusted Wild Alaskan Salmon.  The fish was cooked nicely, but the grapefruit reduction was way too sharp for the dish, and again, the flavors didn't mesh well.  The avocado gnocchi - interesting, but not with those other elements.  \n\nWe decided to try the desserts, because just like everything else, they sounded amazing!  Again, we were disappointed.  We shared the Goat Cheese cheesecake and the Rocky Road.  The cheese taste in the dessert was overpowering, and the deconstructed Rocky Road was beautiful to look at, but didn't come together as you were eating it.  Soy salted caramel - interesting!  innovative!  But not that good...sigh.\n\nI'll be keeping my eyes open for future reviews of Zare, and if I continue to read good things, I may be tempted to go back.

The food presentation and decor are both nice, but where Zar\u00e9 really shines is with its ability to take familiar ingredients (filet mignon, lamb, french fries) and create complex, inventive flavor profiles.\n\nFor starters, my date and I shared the braised italian eggplant topped with sun-dried yogurt, walnuts, and crispy onions for a crunchy side. We also had sardines over a puree and crostini, and the fantastically seasoned french fries with a can't-stop-eating-this saffron aioli. \n\nI had the filet mignon for my main course, complemented by gorgonzola, a pomegranate (?) glaze, and sweet dates. The meat was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend had the lamb shank with black eyed peas, tomatoes, and torshi (pickled vegetables), surrounded by a flavorful broth. \n\nThe dessert was equally impressive - saffron-marinated quince with pistachio cakes, orange blossom ice cream, and a champagne glaze, paired with a digestif. \n\nThe cocktails and wines are decently priced; the food a bit expensive but well worth it by the end of the meal. The decor was lounge-y with warm vermilion walls and dimmed lighting. My only complaint perhaps was the noise level, which did cause us to raise our voices across an already small table. \n\nI would definitely recommend Zar\u00e9 at Fly Trap to people looking for a nice evening out - with the creative flavors you'll want to talk about the next day and without the fuss of most fine dining establishments.", "author": "Britt M."}

The bar was really crowded, but it wasn't overly loud or noisy in the dining area. Pretty standard noise for a Friday night in any restaurant.\n\nOur server was friendly and accommodating. We ordered two glasses of champagne to start. I think they came close to separating an entire bottle into those two glasses. Very healthy pours.\nWe'd brought a bottle of red. Corkage was 20$ which, in my experience, is pretty average.\n\nWe started with the pistachio meatballs (mostly based on the Yelp reviews I'd read). They did not disappoint! Wow. I'm pretty sure I've had a few dreams about them lately. That good.\n\nFor dinner I had the special - prosciutto and brie (?...I can't actually remember what the cheese was) stuffed chicken breast. My guest had the lamb. Both were amazing and I'd recommend to anyone. Great portion size as well.\n\nI'll definitely return for dinner in the future.", "author": "Jasmine S."}

We ordered the Trio of Hummus which came with roasted squash, roasted beet, herbed yogurt, and crispy lavash - delish! The presentation was to die for, the pitas were soft and warm and all 3 flavors of hummus were distinct in flavor. The Pistachio Meatballs had red harissa, honey, and pomegranate - were a medium size and very flavorful. Must try for meatball lovers. The Orange and Wild Arugula Salad came with arugula, fennel, leeks, mint, cilantro, manouri cheese, walnut oil and pomegranate dressing - another nice and light starter with very fresh ingredients. The 2 lamb dishes for dinner were Grilled Lamb Sirloin and the Zar\u00e9 Lamb Burger with french fries. The lamb was cooked to perfect - not chewy and not pink, as we requested. The burger was actually better than the sirloin. For a chicken item, we ordered the Marinated Chicken Breast Jerusalem which was also very juicy and flavorful.

Everything about this place is classy and inviting.  Yes its a little pretentious and the people who dine there might be as well, but if you want good quality Persian fusion food at moderate price this is your spot. \n\nNotable dishes are the heirloom tomato/cowgirl creamery cheese which is a great way to start the meal because of its freshly delicate taste.  My personal fav the vegetarian kufteh tabrizi, which taste more like a falafel than a meatball is filled w/ Bulgar, beans and veggies. It was nicely served and very delicious. Oh and the avocado salsa that was served with it compliments very nicely. \n\nTo end the meal I highly recommend the goat cheese cheesecake.  It was the creamiest most delicate cheesecake I think I've tasted.  My only complaint was the dates were kinda just set on the plate almost like an after thought.

My bf and I came here to celebrate our anniversary, as it was right across the street from the hotel where we were staying.  No problem getting a table at 7pm on a Monday night.  I really liked the ambience - it wasn't too noisy, the decor was tasteful, etc.  \n\nFirst, I ordered the lime-cardamom-gin cocktail.  Usually, when I order a drink like this, I ask ahead of time how sweet it is.  On the menu, however, it didn't say anything about this drink having simple syrup or other sweeteners, and I'm not a big fan of super-sweet drinks.  (Seriously, it said lime juice, gin, cardamom.  That doesn't sound sweet to me!)  I took one sip and it was like drinking  limeade that was made with not enough water.  Extremely sweet, and extremely tart.  I could not taste the gin or the cardamom at all - just this cloying, sweet lime juice.  I didn't want to be difficult, so I tried a few more small sips before deciding there was no way I could drink this thing.  \n\nSo when the waiter came back, I asked him if there was something the bartender could do to make the drink less sweet.  He suggested more lime juice, which I thought was not the best idea given how tart the drink already was.  So then he suggested taking the drink away and bringing the menu so I could order a different one with his recommendations for something less sweet.  I went with this and he took away my almost-full drink and brought me this dry martini that he recommended.  I am not a big martini drinker and I didn't read the description carefully, so it was my fault that I picked a standard martini.  This isn't really my favorite beverage but at least it was drinkable.  And since I had already sent something back, I didn't want to do it again.  Moving on...\n\nWe got the Dolmeh special, which ended up being a baked potato with a filling of braised goat, surrounded by wilted kale, sour grapes, raisins, all in a yummy yogurt-harissa sauce.  This was a very good dish.  Then, we got the eggplant, which was spectacular - two small, peeled eggplants, served whole on some grilled bread with an amazing sauce.  I could have ordered a second portion.  I should have ordered a second portion.  Because...\n\nWe were there on Meatball Monday, so we opted for the meatball special.  The waiter never mentioned that this meatball special was twice the cost of the meatballs on the menu (interesting definition of the term \"special\" in my opinion), but oh well.  Overall it was pretty tasty, but the texture was a bit mushy, and the bits of goat meat in the middle were a little on the dry side.  The meatball came on a plate with some broth/sauce that was pretty heavy on the cinnamon - not a bad thing, necessarily, but the sauce itself was too thin to cling to the meat at all, so it was sort of wasted.  \n\nNo dessert for us (the meatball was huge!), so we asked for our check.  Upon looking it over, I noticed that they hadn't taking the first drink I ordered off of the bill.  So we summoned our waiter and brought this to his attention.  At which point he informed me that it was not their policy to remove things like this from the bill.  Since I had ordered the drink and taken a couple of sips, I should expect to pay for it.  This totally blew me away - I am not the type to send things back everywhere I go, but I have never, ever been to a restaurant where this is the \"policy.\"  Honestly, I would have been happy to finish my drink if they had been able to remix it with some more soda, gin, the elusive cardamom, ???  to make it more to my palate.    \n\nThe service for our entire meal was very good.  They did ultimately remove the drink from the bill without much fuss, but this episode, at the end of the meal, sort of wrecked it for me.  I don't think we'll be going back.", "author": "Cyrille K."}

And, I'm not the only one raving about it. This Mediterranean and Persian-inspired restaurant has built a very loyal following. Much of the restaurant's success has to do with its owner, chef Hoss Zar\u00e9, an extremely social and gregarious guy with loads of celebrity chef potential. Seriously, mark my words: Hoss will become the first Persian celebrity chef.\n\nThe restaurant itself is a cozy and romantic spot with a rich 110-year history. Purchased in 2008 by Hoss, its new incarnation maintains its original quirky charm. Besides a few minor renovations and improvements, Hoss has cleverly maintained its original ambiance. Check out the funky antique wallpaper and sconces.\n\nAfter moving to the states from Iran in 1986, Hoss ditched his medical school aspirations when he discovered his talent and love for cooking. Interestingly, he worked at the original Flytrap from 1989 to 1992, starting as a line cook and moving up to chef. It's nice to see him come back and transform the place into one of the hottest spots in SF. You might want to check out some of Flytrap's special events and lively dance parties frequented by the chic SF Persian set. \n\nHere are some of my personal favorites from several recent visits:\n\n-Pisco sour made with barsol pisco, angostura, egg white, and lime\n-Pistacho meatballs with harissa-honey-pomegranate sauce\n-Roasted beets with laural goat cheese, grape molasses, and mint\n-Ash Reshteh (traditional Persian noodle soup)\n-Smoked trout with cucumber linguine, trout roe, and dill cr\u00e9me fra\u00eeche\n-Ghormeh Sabzi with short ribs served over basmati rice (classic Persian fresh herb stew)\n-Faloudeh with a tequila shot (a delicious tart sorbet with cream chips)\n\nNext time I'd like to try the Lamb Burger and a few more of the drinks designed by mixologist Reza Esmaili. The absinthe concoction sounds delightful. ZUNG!  Not to mention an extensive wine list.\n\nThere are also several adventurous items on the menu that Hoss highly recommends, including the Spice Roasted Bone Marrow and the Oxtail Tagliatelle.\n\nFinally, I was really impressed with the service. Not overly drippy sweet and not too aloof either. It was juuuusssst right.\n\nMake a reservation. This place gets packed.", "author": "Elle J."}

Avocadoey, potatoey, pretty hard to describe but goddamn delicious.\n\nFor dinner I had the Lamb Shank, and my gf had the toretllini off the veggie menu.  The lamb was HUGE! savory, and melted in my mouth.  The pasta was good, but I was way too preoccupied with the hunk of meat bigger than my head!!\n\nI wanted dessert, but my belly couldn't handle it.

The fesenjoon dish was interesting but was really missing the sweet or sour flavor you would normally expect.  In fact the sauce was almost completely missing -- just a dash on the bottom.  The chicken was well cooked with crispy skin, but hardly any flavor.  Same story with the noodles/confit on the other side of the dish; they tasted like plain noodles.  The lamb burger was spiced well, tasted good, but had no other toppings or anything to really go with it.

But it's actually not as expensive as you would think. It's pretty average. Food is $21-27 for main course. Appetizers are around $10-12. Wine bottles $38- and more. \n\nThe place is beautiful. The walls are beautifully decorated. The waitresses are very nice and they check on you often. Honestly the service is much better than most other restaurants with this pricing. The chef/owner is very nice and he greets you if he is available at the end. The service is comparable to what you would see at a Micheal Minna restaurant or a very good fine dining place. Except they don't overwhelm you with extra unnecessary information about what you are eating in a weird formal language that most fine dinning waitressed do. Instead they make sure you have your clean napkin and your wine and water levels are good. Your Knife and fork are in the right place and are relevant to what you have ordered. They do all these in such seamless ways that it makes you not remember them but you remember that you were treated nicely and that you felt comfortable. Isn't that what good service should be always?\n\nFood, was great. It was Persian Fusion. Torshi, Lavash, Kashke Bademjoon and other persian basics were reinvented to give you a new experience. \n\nI find this place a perfect spot for first dates, for valentines, for anniversaries, for meeting old friends (not large parties), for inviting your parents to a nice dinner, for meeting a professor and so on.\n\nDefinitely a classy spot. Go nicely dressed on an empty stomach and enjoy. \n\nNot recommended for large groups as this place has a nice quiet environment that should be disrupted by large loud parties.", "author": "T I."}

They were mostly middle eastern wines which I'm not terribly convinced of just yet.  The pistachio meatballs were really the only memorable dish of the night and our main entrees (filet mignon & pan roasted bass) were average at best.  The chocolate mousse cake was embedded with some sort of rice crispy crust and was actually decent, but the port pairing was just not good...For the price, this was definitely a lop sided meal and as with all special occasion prix fixe menu's, it's a crap shoot.

We jokingly told each other if Fly Trap didn't work out, we'd still have a good fallback next door.  That's as far as that idea went.\n\nThe manager gave us greeting and a light ribbing for being 1/2hr late -hey, we're out of towners and had no idea where to park- and proceeded to take us to our table.  Points for being nice enough to hold our table even though we were late on a capacity night knowing it was our anniversary dinner.  We couldn't help but share each other's plates since everything from the crab cakes and escargot to the rack of lamb and sweetbreads were nothing short of plate-licking good.  The staff did an excellent job of staying on top of things.\n\nOur dinner finished on a high note with some berries with sabayon.  We even  enjoyed some tasty port courtesy of the manager while listening to happy anniversary sung to the tune of happy birthday.  They offered to play us our jazz song... but we both had deer in the headlights looks on our faces as we completely blanked out.  Oh sure the names of various songs poured in after the fact... maybe next time we'll keep a list at hand.

They were great.  But I have to say that I loved the lamb sausage!  It was not gamy at all and had a nice kick to it.  It was accompanied by a few pieces of squash and some other veggie.  We also tried the smoked trout salad, which came with cucumbers cut up like spaghetti.  This was good, but not one of my favorites.  We also tried the brussel sprouts that came with some sort of yogurt sauce.  Wonderful!!  Our last small plate was an eggplant dish.  Can't remember exactly how it was prepared, but it was another hit.  When you look at the menu, many of the dishes just sound so interesting b/c they are flavors that you wouldn't normally think would go together.  But they know how to make it work.  \n\nOne of the best courses of course is dessert.  We ordered the trijolla (not sure if that's how it's spelled).  But it was off the hook. I trijolla is a cross b/w a churro and a beignet.

Tangy enough to make the back of your mouth pucker, but not to overpower the actual meat. My salmon entree was very good and the yogurt sauce was heavenly. The bread app was good and the sauces were insane... notice a trend here? The sauces here are ridiculously good... Not sure if Chef Hoss does the sauces himself or not but they were definitely the icing on top of a truly great meal. Overall, the food is a delicious melange of French cuisine peppered with dashes of Persian influence. \n\nThe cocktail list sounded amazing but I am a sucker for a txakolina so I had to order it (it was good).\n\nDesserts - the faloudeh with the shot of tequila was a hit at our table and I loved the deconstructed pie. I love being able to control my meringue:citrus ratio. :)\n\nBut the best part about dining at Zare is the overall experience. I felt like I was coming into somebody's home for dinner. Chef Hoss is amazingly friendly and genuinely cares that each patron (or rather, dinner guest) has a great time. Of course food takes center stage, but at Zare they really appreciate that it is not only the food which wholly creates 'The Dinner' experience.

Our waiter was extremely friendly with the right amount of attention, giving us the space to enjoy our food and conversation.  I would say the food was hit or miss.  We tried both the scallop carpaccio and pistachio meatballs.  The scallop dish was very bland and underseasoned, so the texture was not the most appetizing because that's all you were left with in terms of tasting the dish.  The pistachio meatballs in comparison were hearty, rich and flavorful.\n\nI forget exactly what my friend had for dinner, but it was the special or the day chicken dish, a roasted chicken I believe, and the bite I had was quite tasty.  I had the cinnamon braised beef cheek dish which was incredibly tasty and fork tender, by far the highlight of my dinner.  I could have eaten several servings of that!\n\nWe finished with trying both the goat cheesecake and chocolate torte.  The torte was rather dry and again underwhelming in its flavor.

I expected a lot more after hearing good reviews, but it was just alright. We ordered the lamb pistachio meatballs since that seems to be the popular kid in school. These were pretty good, but drenched pretty heavily in sauce. My waistline and I respectfully decline. The mushroom cake was REALLY good though, and I could have easily eaten another one.\n\nFor my entree, I got the grilled moroccan-style wild salmon after debating between another seasonal fish dish. I think I should have gone with the other one. Salmon is already delicious if you just pop it in the microwave, add some seasoning, and have the right veg/wine pairings, so I expect a lot from a restaurant that's serving it.  I'm not the greatest cook in the world (far from it), but I felt like I would have been equally pleased with my microwaved 15 minute salmon. \n\nThere were plenty more items on the menu I'd like to have sampled and might have liked more, but since this rating is based solely on what I did order - meh.

The entire dish was very flavorful; the dungeness crab was sweet and the couscous added great texture.\n\nMy friend LOVED the Pistachio Meatballs ( a house special apparently), but I found the sauce too overwhelming.

We stood at the host stand for several minutes, waiting for someone to help us. Since we were a few minutes early for the reservation we decided to wait at the bar, and showed ourselves over. We made a point of telling the bartender that we had a reservation for x time, assuming that the bartender would alert the host to our presence or flag down someone who could help us. This did not happen. She gave us a drink and never came back. Finally some other couples arrived, and the host appeared, so we got in the back of the line and were eventually shown to our table. Being ignored and worrying about losing our table because they didn't know we were at the bar was not a good way to start the night.\n\n2. Lamb dish. I ordered a lamb dish that was beautifully described on the menu, but had the grey and cylindrical appearance of tinned cat food. The taste was not much better, sort of like the worst pulled pork of your life. Except it was lamb at a fancy restaurant.\n\n3. Fillet mignon. Bland. \n\nThings I liked about Zare:\n\n1.

This was delicious. They brought the Mediterranean use of pistachios to classic meatballs for a twist of flavor that really paid off.\n- Beet Salad ($9) w/ goat cheese. Thin sliced beets line a large plate like petals with accents of yellow beets and goat cheese with a center of watercress sprouts (or something like it). I didn't think it was particularly outstanding but it did live up to \"beet salad\".\n- French Fries ($5) w/ saffron aioli. I didn't really taste the saffron but the fries were thin cut w/ skin which is how I like my fries.\n\nFor my main, I had the Black Cod ($22), with sauteed greens and a tomato gratin.

Just open windows which resulted in several mosquito bites....\n\nAnyway, the service was spotty. It was not crowded and it took more than 10 minutes to get service at the bar (the bartender was MIA, probably icing herself down in the cooler). Our waitress was great at the beginning, but after our entrees were served, she must have joined the bartender in the cooler. \n\nAnd the food was okay, but I expected more care in execution. Three of us got the pulled lamb pasta and it was too hot when it arrived at the table. As in, we could not put it in our mouths, kind of hot. And of course, it was overcooked.

My wife and I along with 4 of our friends each had an appetizer course, entree and desserts along with a series of cocktails.  I'll reserve my comments for what I think was the best of what we had (although quite frankly, everything on their menu looked amazing).  \n\nFirst, as for appetizers the chef is well known for his kufteh (a meatball but without the meat).  While the kufteh was incredibly good, I would recommend the \"M\u00e9nage a Foie\", a series of three very good servings of liver.  Although listed as a side dish, we also ordered the couscous.  Very, very good.\n\nSecond, for entrees my wife had the black cod while I ordered the fulton valley spring chicken.  I have to admit, the chicken was the winner.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and rested on a sauce made of pomegranate, walnuts, onion, and some sugar.  The mixture was perfect.  A friend of mine also had a notable dish, \"ghormeh sabzi\", which was a very good lamb with rice, and a number of herbs. \n\nLastly, for dessert I highly recommend the faloodeh.  It's a homemade Persian cuisine.  Flytrap tops it with fruits and a shot of tequila.  Very innovative, but also very good.\n\nOverall, the best thing about flytrap is that it does something that no restaurant has every done - and it does it well.  It takes traditional Persian cuisine and adds new flavors to it while still retaining the core ingredients.  In that sense, the restaurant is as much the creative innovation of its chef as it is the quality of the food.  Had Flytrap simply been the first \"new-Persian/Iranian\" restaurant in the country, it would certainly be worth visiting and would have likely garnered 3 stars.  However, because it succeeds in blending new tastes with old ones, I would easily give it 5 stars and place it as one of the top 10 restaurants (easily) in San Francisco.", "author": "Nima M."}

I picked Fly Trap because of the yelp reviews as well as the Daily Candy recommendation. In a lovely mood I was, donning a new dress and requesting a button down shirt on BF, we came out to this cute little spot in the busier end of SOMA. \n\nService: We waited quite some time before getting some acknowledgment from the server. But once our waiter stopped by the table, he explained everything on the menu proficiently and all of our food came out timely. The chef also greeted each table with a friendly hello, which I thought was very nice. \n\nFood: The description of the butternut squash soup was delicious--- curried with a drizzle of basil oil--- I was sold. Unfortunately, the texture of the soup was way too thick. BF called it: It was like drinking spoonfuls of gravy. It was also on the salty side, and as small as the portion, I simply could not finish it. The trio of foie got us excited, but also fell short. The original foie, supposedly the most delicate one, was rather gamey. The sheep liver to my surprise, was actually not bad at all, being a non-lamb eater. Then the chicken liver just underwhelmed. Calling that robust in flavors would be an understatement.  Now the bone marrow, one of my favorite things to eat in the world--- were my taste buds simply numbed by the gravy soup?  It was bland and not hot enough, and the rock hard toast was impossible to chew down.  Simply not the bone marrow I had looked forward to.  \n\nMy main course, the black cod, was very bland.  BF's lamb shank was good--- once again, for someone like me who does not eat lamb, actually found the meat so tender and with very little gaminess.  It was the only good dish that night.\n\nCocktails were delicious, as we each had 2.  I always bypass the wine anyway, so cannot comment on the wine list.  Oh, and there were mosquitoes.  I got bitten at the table.  And when I went to the bathroom, there were two big ones resting on the mirror.  Yuck.\n\nOverall, not crazy about their food.  I almost feel bad saying it, but that's my honest opinion.  Maybe the butternut squash soup just ruined my palate for the night...  I don't know.", "author": "Jiajia C."}

Last time I came it was \"just\" the Fly Trap, which I remember as an old time restaurant in San Francisco and unremarkable. Now a Persian fellow named Hoss Zar\u00e9 has taken it over (hence, Zare at Fly Trap; the bartender, a very knowledgeable lady named Valen, told me that Mr. Zar\u00e9 has a big following in San Francisco (http://cookeatshare.com/chefs/hoss-zare-10507), so the idea was to attract his cult as his customer base for this restaurant. \n\nDrinks: At the recommendation of Mario, the host, Valen made a cocktail with no name for me, which was equal parts of yellow & green chartreuse and Black Bottle, a blend of single malts from Islay with a splash of Luxardo, a cherry liqueur. We agreed that the best way to describe the concoction was something like licking the rubber of a street, from a car that had laid it there earlier. Surprisingly good! :-) My friend had the \"Cardamom My Dearest\", which she said hit the spot. (I did try a pisco sour, but didn't like it and had another Street Rubber.)\n\nFood: I had pistachio meatballs with harissa, honey, and pomegranate glaze as the appetizer. And then something called \"ghormeh sabzi\", described as a herb stew with basmati rice, preserved lime, which I had with the short ribs. Both dishes were delicious, tasty with complex flavors that complemented each other. My friend had a boring salad(!) and the spring chicken with wild rice, walnuts and fessenjoon, which was very good, particularly that sauce. The food was well cooked and presented and came promptly, when we wanted it. \n\nOur waitress, Meg (short for Margaret), was totally professional. We went last night, Thanksgiving eve so there were only two other tables seated. I had a blast with Meg, Valen, and Mario (not to mention my friend!), so great drinks, great food, and wonderful staff. What's to complain about? I'll be back (and Meg promised to remember me and get me in when it was crowded!)", "author": "Stewart A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-07-12", "description": "After much debate, I am actually going to write my first Yelp review.  It is unfortunate this needs to be categorically negative, but I feel strongly that others should not be subject to the treatment that my friends and I experienced last weekend.\n\nOur party consisted of 17 people for a 2-way joint birthday dinner.  I had no strong first impression - ambiance is like a smaller Cafe Des Amis.  \n\nThe lady bartender was actually fantastic - very helpful in guiding us to a special scotch as a birthday toast.  She gets a star.\n\nThe first sign of weirdness was a bread service that contained fewer pieces of bread than people at the table.  And how we'd be charged for more.  Fine, it's a recession - I understand you need to charge $5 for 8 pieces of bread.  We'll wait.\n\nNext up:  lamb sausage appetizer.  This was probably the highlight of the meal (though possibly due to being hungry from lack of bread).  Very flavorful - a little salty, but this was balanced out nicely by the accompanying squash.  Ideally, we could isolate this dish and serve it at a high quality restaurant.\n\nMain course:  filet mignon.  I say filet mignon only because that's what they call it on the menu - a more appropriate description would be \"gravy drenched meatloaf\".  Curiously, the waiter never asked how I'd like the filet to be cooked (to be fair, some of my other friends said they were asked).  It appears he assumed I wanted \"cooked until the filet tastes equivalent to meatloaf\".  Fine, I guess I should have proactively asked for \"medium rare\".  I asked an employee named Ryan (who later turned out to be the General Manager) if there was anything he could do, and acknowledged the waiter and I never had a discussion about how to cook the steak.  Ryan responded with, \"Okay, we'll bring you another piece\".  Awesome.  Oh wait, the 2nd piece tastes just like the first piece.  Ugh.  \n\nDessert:  \"Not Your Grandma's Pie\".  This one was actually very aptly named because my grandma, who has no idea how to make a pie, could make a better pie than this!  Since when do people enjoy slimy, tasteless meringue amorphously smeared around a plate next to a pile of bread crumbs... such that it looks like the product of someone puking and shitting at the same time?  This is not a pie.  If they were going for a \"deconstructed\" presentation, a pile of sugar, flour, and eggs would have been preferable.\n\nOkay, time to go!  Oh wait.  The bill appears to be $100 per person.  That's strange, because we were told $82 per person for the fixed menu.  Excuse me, General Manager Ryan, we don't understand?\n\nOh, it turns out that our contract was for 18 people instead of 17.  Despite how [birthday boy's gf] had called two days earlier to say we'd only be 17, and how she was told that'd be fine... I guess the number stands at 18.  Okay, so can we have the extra meal?  No??  Why not?!  Because:  They had voluntarily replaced my overcooked steak with an equally overcooked steak.  Really?  In what universe is it okay to tell a customer you'll replace a steak, and then charge for two of them??\n\nFurther justification for not giving us the 18th meal:  we're lucky to have even gotten to eat in the side dining room.  Despite [birthday boy's gf] having been told in advance that we could sit at a single table, we were placed in a side room and split into two tables.... we should be advised that we were done a favor here.  It seems we owe Ryan a meal for splitting our group in two.\n\nFinal justification for not giving us the 18th meal that we're paying for:  we've been drinking.  Huh?  We're being accused of being drunk?  I had two drinks over an hour ago!  What is this guy in his day job - a high school prom chaperone?  And how does this have anything to do with us being refused a meal that we're paying for??\n\nThe only silver lining here is that we were all amongst friends, so it was easier to enjoy the rest of the night.  Imagine bringing a group of business clients here... Good God!!", "author": "Joseph S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-07-11", "description": "Disclaimer: This is my very first Yelp review. I simply haven't cared enough until now - I haven't felt this strongly about an establishment (for better or worse) in the past 5 years. This is saying a lot, as I am a minority owner in a restaurant myself (and have never tried to push it up with reviews) and have friends that run numerous restaurants.\n\nSummary: Food started out at 4 stars, rapidly decreased to a 2-3 stars. Service started out average and plummeted to -2 stars. Weighting food quality and food service equally, the net rating is at 1 star. BOTTOM LINE - DO NOT COME TO THIS RESTAURANT UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE TREATED LIKE A MENTALLY CHALLENGED INDIVIDUAL OR [INSERT DEGRADING RACIAL SLUR]. And the food was mediocre to boot! Diner be warned, especially if you have to deal with the condescending, hostile, and untrustworthy general manager Ryan.\n\nDetails: Zare went from good to bad to worse in the span of 2 hours. To be objective, I'll point out the positives first. I only had one complete drink at the bar (a Pisco Sour) and a couple sips of another one of their cocktails. Both were spectacular - well mixed and a great start at dinner. After making my selections off the set menu, we waited for a very long (but still tolerable) amount of time for our appetizers. I got the Pistachio meatballs (a signature appetizer), and was immediately a fan. Given how hungry I was, they immediately hit the spot. Current rating - 4 stars.\n\nUnfortunately, the entree I chose was a major step down. I consider myself a steak fan, so when my Filet came out tasteless and dry, I was disappointed. To compound matters, I had originally asked for Medium Rare, but the waitress made it a point to ensure me that it was easier for them to leave the temperature at Medium, and that it would be pink, moist and tender on the inside. To me, this sounds like a bit of laziness on the chef's part as the waitress specifically asked me if I could go with Medium and it tasted like a piece of cardboard. Several of my friends left their Filets barely touched. Current rating - 2-3 stars.\n\nThe evening progressed. We were with good company for a friend's birthday, so everyone was in a good mood despite the subpar food. We did not object to the $2+ PER PERSON cake cutting fee, although it seemed unreasonably high. Nor did we complain when the restaurant-supplied desserts came out highly original and inventive (in the worst possible way imaginable). Backstory - after asking the waitress for her recommendation, I ordered the 'Not Your Grandma's Pie\", which was a jumbled mess of ingredients presented in a way that resembled something akin to lemon-flavored puke (or perhaps bile or phlegm). The flavors of the \"pie\" were not completely inedible (the sorbet was actually good), but the texture and lack of an actual pie (cake or bread or cookie dough would have been fine substitutes) really killed it. Globs of random ingredients that a toddler would fling around in a baby food fighting contest really don't satiate the palate, especially when one expects a pie. Current rating - 2 stars.\n\nAt this point, we were ready to leave. Had service not gone from mediocre to downright condescending, you wouldn't be reading this. I wouldn't have been motivated to break my Yelp virginity with this review (and further spreading it on all social media channels - can I get a retweet people?). But alas, the general manager decided to act elitist, present his best \"the customer is always wrong\" smirk, and insult no fewer than 6 of my friends. I felt like I had received a figurative boot up my ass, and now I'm punching back.\n\nHaving fallen one person short of the minimum for our group party, we politely asked if we could get the extra plate of food since we were paying for it. All the general manager had to say was \"No\", and that would have been an acceptable answer. Ryan said \"No\", but he followed with ridiculous excuses that only a 3 year old child would buy. Choice quotes below:\n\nRyan: You guys sent back a steak. We were going to charge you for that one. But I didn't because I knew the last person didn't come - so it all works out.\n\nFriend: But wait...if the steak was done poorly, shouldn't Zare comp it?\n\nRyan: No it was your fault.\n\nFriend 2: That's not how it is at other restaurants.\n\nRyan: This is how all restaurants do it.\n\nFriend 3: Can we get the extra steak to go?\n\nRyan: No, you guys look like you want to have a good time tonight. We don't do food to go.\n\n(Really??? Because your waitress just dropped a place card at our table for Food To Go for another entree. Are you lying to our faces?)\n\nMe: Ok, we can eat it now.\n\nRyan: Look, clearly you have had a lot to drink tonight. Why don't you guys just leave.\n\n(WTFx10. Only had 1 drink 3 hours ago buddy.)\n\nMe: \"I am not drunk\"\n\nConclusion: The GM is condescending, arrogant, and will call you drunk if you disagree with him. The food is a sorry excuse for fine Mediterranean given the numerous other options in SF. 1 STAR.", "author": "Matthew L."}

There were vegetarians, people who didn't eat fish, folks who could or couldn't handle spicy hot food, and individuals who would not have felt as though they'd had a meal if it hadn't had meat.  The reason this restaurant was selected was because these all could be accommodated.\n\nI had the vegetarian stuffed squash entree (which can be vegan by having them hold the tablespoon of sauce displayed artfully on the plate, but not directly on the food).  It was very tasty, and filling.  I tasted a friend's salmon plate which was also flavorful and rich.  For dessert, the goat cheese cheesecake was more than marvelous, and the panna cotta with fresh fruit melted in our mouths.  I look forward to going back to this restaurant, and to sharing it with others.  \n\nThis restaurant is reasonably priced.  It's great for foodies, and good for foodies who also want to watch their wallet.  (If this is you, be prepared to skip the appetizer but go back several times to try their different items!  Or have the appetizers in one visit, and entree another time, maybe stop in for dessert and a drink...  the possibilities just go on.)\n\nI get the impression this would not be a good place for children - I did not see any there.  The restaurant is right off the Bay Bridge (we found street parking within a block) and accessible by BART.", "author": "Sara F."}

I came with my newborn baby in a stroller and they were very accommodating despite being busy--had no problem taking out a chair for my stroller to be placed at the dinner table. The service was great, the wait staff was friendly, attentive and charming. All that said, I am giving this restaurant 5 stars because of the quality of its food--which is above all, the most important thing to me. I should preface that the night before, I was at a Michelin starred restaurant...and yet, I found Fly Trap to be more deserving. The food was delicious. We ordered the abgoosht (lamb stew), meatballs, short ribs, kashke bademjan and desserts. Every dish was mouth-watering delicious. To add to the experience, the Chef was very personable and inviting--would often come out to engage, which made the restaurant perfectly aligned with Iranian hospitality.", "author": "Rosa H."}

Zare @ the Fly Trap felt so welcoming and warm...I loved it! And while homey, it was still rather buji and trendy...in a good way.\n\nAesthetically, the restaurant is quite busy with the decor. But it works. I find it so adorable that the owner/chef opened his restaurant at this location because it was the first building of the first place he worked when he started his culinary career. How friggin' endearing and sweet is that? So he tried to keep as much of the decor and vibe the same as when he worked there, with some of his own touches. The motifs and vibe is as if you stumbled upon a safari travel trip with royalty. One section your eye is caught on a very Victorian wall lamp, then the next second you see the wilderness camp roman shades that hang from ceiling to floor. Very chill.\n\nNow for the food. We had been looking forward to this dinner date for a while and everyone did their part in reading up on the reviews and checking out the menu. \n\nWe started with drinks. Of the 4 of us I had the Cardamom My Dearest martini...I am a sucker for cardamom anything and so were the rest of the girls at our table. Everyone ended up ordering one for themselves after trying mine. \n\nA bit after drinks our appetizers made their way out, which consisted of Pistachio Meatballs and Brussels Sprouts. The meatball were definitely full of flavor and accompanied by a honey-pomegranate glaze that was just tangy and sweet enough to highlight the natural flavors of the meat. The sprouts were excellent! \n\nThen of course, our main courses came out. Around the table there were two lamb shanks and two fillets...both AMAZING! I will say however, that after trying the lamb shank I knew I had to order one for the road to share with the fam when I got home. The lamb shank was by far divine to say the least! It is a MUST TRY when dining here. I don't care if you are a vegetarian...go meat for one day just to experience this meal! It's so worth it! \n\nWe ended the night sharing the Goat Cheese Cheesecake and a Chocolate Delight...both were super delish. But of the two, I've gotta say that the texture and air caught in the cheesecake was magnificent. I could have eaten two on my own...so effin' good!\n\nAs for service, our waitress was awesome. She was very helpful, understanding (our orders changed a few times because everything seemed to look so good!), and cheery. Also, the Chef/Owner, Hoss Zare, made frequent trips out of the kitchen to greet people and say hello and thank you for coming to eat there. It was like watching an artist at their gallery opening roaming through the people to see if they loved it or hated it. Good for him...everyone seemed to be more than happy with their food. Also, it was just great to see someone so passionate about the food and the people he is feeding. It also helped that every time we saw him he had a big ass smile on his face.", "author": "stefany f."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-20", "description": "I booked a reservation for Zare at Fly Trap, having heard mediocre to great reviews from friends who had eaten there.  I always brushed this establishment off as a restaurant that many visited for business meals, as it is situated between the Financial District and SoMa.  My concerns could not have been more misplaced, as this may be one of the best dining experiences I've had in San Francisco in the past six months.  \n\nThere is a cute entryway leading into the busy dining room that gives you the impression that you're entering someone's home - it's cozy and warm.  My friend and I were greeted at the host stand, which is a bit awkwardly placed between the bar and one of the bustling dining rooms.  After being shown to a quieter table in the back dining room, the Maitre D' immediately addressed my notes that I placed in my OpenTable reservation and provided a vegetarian menu without being prompted.  I was instantly impressed.\n\nI ordered a drink, but made a change to the standard preparation.  Not only did it arrive correctly, but I later ordered a second one and it was perfectly prepared without me asking for that same preparation.  Already, I could tell that the bar was on top of their game, in addition to the service.  However, I was interested to learn if the kitchen was in sync.\n\nThe menu was not complicated, everything was well priced and the food was fresh and seasonal.  My friend and I both asked our server for recommendations and she adeptly guided us based on our tastes.  Despite the restaurant being packed, our appetizers arrived together five or six minutes after ordering and were hot.  I cannot tell how how many times in recent months I've waited more than a half hour for my appetizer to arrive and it was lukewarm or not prepared correctly.  We both ordered the gnocchi for our entrees (I ordered it without the anchovy) and the server, again, ensured we each had the right plate without asking.  The pillowy gnocchi were made perfectly and did not leave us feeling heavy afterward.  The broccoli rabe in the dish was paired correctly with the seasoning and crunchy roasted garlic garnish.  I'm still dreaming about the flavors dancing in my mouth, as everything worked together so well without being overpowering.\n\nBoth my friend and I were blown away by the attentive service throughout the evening.  Our water glasses were always full, plates were promptly removed and both the server and the Maitre D' checked on us on more than one occasion without being intrusive.  The highlight of the evening (beyond the food, that is) was having the head chef visit our table to ensure we enjoyed the meal.  When we raved to him about our experience, he appeared to be genuinely grateful and appreciative that we chose to dine at his restaurant.  A few minutes later, the chef reappeared with a perfectly crisp dessert wine for each of us to pair with our dessert - on the house.  The light dessert wine was the perfect complement to the lime sorbet, toasted coconut, lemon curd and meringue with graham cracker crumbs.  We were beyond ecstatic.\n\nOn the way out the door, we were thanked for dining at Zare by each staff member we passed and the chef personally walked us out.  I had missed this on the way in, but he had placed a bowl of sweet Persian lemons by the door for guests to enjoy later as a token of gratitude.  The chef explained that he grew up enjoying these lemons and that they should not be used in a way you would a sour lemon.  The sweetness of these lemons, apparently, should be paired with the right beverage or food item.  My friend and I beamed, holding our sweet lemons, and gleefully recounting some of the highlights of our evening as we left the restaurant.  \n\nIt's so rare that I spend the time to write such an extensive review, but Zare at Fly Trap is worth this effort.  The prices are right, the service and food were impeccable and the personal touches made the experience incredibly special.  I've already alerted my husband and several friends that we need to pay Zare at Fly Trap a visit sometime very soon.", "author": "Rachel P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-12-25", "description": "I just had dinner here last night. I've heard great things about this place and judging by the menu, description of the food, and even the ambiance as we first walked into the restaurant, it seemed like a solid choice. I'm sad to say that I walked away pretty disappointed.\n\nWe ordered the following: \n\nAPPETIZERS\n- Smoked Salmon w/ Cucumber Relish \nFour spoons topped with a tiny cut of smoked salmon over a cucumber relish which was really overpowering. We barely ate any of the relish.\n\n- Arincini - Saffron Risotto Balls w/ Spicy Marinara \nThe Arincini was super crispy... maybe a little too crispy? I didn't sense any saffron by sight (color) or taste, but that didn't bother me. It wasn't great, but it was good for the price ($5). \n\n- Pistachio Meatballs w/ Harissa Honey Pomegranite Glaze\nThe meatballs were good, but the pomegranite glaze was waaay too sweet.  I didn't want to eat the parts of my meatball that had touched the sauce.  It was really that sweet.\n\nSIDE\n- Marinated Chickpeas w/ Eggplants, Parsley, Barberries, & Pine Nuts\nSimple, but good.  I didn't taste any eggplant, but I do recall some square-shaped black or dark purple specks, so maybe that was the eggplant skin?\n\nENTREES\n- Ghormeh sabzi - Short Ribs over Fresh Herb Stew w/ Basmati Rice and Preserved Lemon\nI didn't like this at all and I LOVE short ribs. What they actually serve is a single-bone short rib, so the plural \"ribs\" on the menu is deceiving.  That being said, the single rib I got was a nice size, so I have no complaints about portion size.  Sadly, the meat wasn't very juicy.  It fell off the bone, but the meat wasn't tender.  I know that sounds contradicting, but it somehow seemed dry.  Maybe it was sitting out awhile or sitting under a heat lamp.  Not good.  The meat was one thing, but the herb stew was was another.  It was really off-putting to me.  There was a single ingredient in there that was extremely overpowering.  It almost tasted like a bitter plant.  I'm not sure what it was... maybe that's what preserved lemon tastes like??  I just had a very hard time with it.\n\n- Lamb Shank Abgusht w/ Black-eyed Beans & Fingerling Potatoes\nI think the lamb shank is supposed to be the dish to get here, but it was just okay.  This was not my dish, but I was able to have several good tastes of it.  It seemed to be lacking in flavor, slightly bland.  It wasn't bad, but it didn't wow at all. \n\nDESSERT\n- Fried Milk Torijas\nThis totally reminded me of the french toast sticks at Jack-in-the-Box.  It came w/ a small side of hot cocoa to dip them in.  It was pretty good, but I can get the same from Jack.\n\nUltimately, the entire food experience was pretty mediocre. Most of the dishes seemed to have a single overwhelming ingredient or something just seemed missing or off.  \n\nThe herb stew is something I would never ever order again... it was not my taste at all.  I can't imagine that I'm the only one who would feel this way about it.  I'm starting to wonder if I just got a very very bad dish or a rotten lemon or something...  \n\nLastly, the service was pretty good at first, but after our entrees were delivered, our server disappeared on us -- service became nearly non-existant which put another damper on the meal.  Our dessert order was taken by Zare himself when I think he noticed that we were desperately trying to get some attention.\n\nThese are just my own personal opinions and it appears many have had difference experiences here.  Maybe we just ended up there on an off night.  Even so, I'm not sure that I'd try it again.", "author": "J L."}

What lured me in was the goat cheese cheesecake I saw on the dessert menu. I don't eat much cheesecake, but goat cheese is the best food on earth. It delivered as promised, but if you're not a whore for goat cheese like I am you'll probably find it pretty ordinary.\n\nWorking backwards, for my entree I ordered a seafood stew that I don't see on Zar\u00e9's online menu. It wasn't so much a stew as it was a seafood medley with a bit of flavorful tomato broth. My friends ordered black cod with fresh herb stew and filet mignon, which were also good.\n\nMy third friend ordered the \"spice-roasted bone marrow\" appetizer as her main course. I reluctantly tried it and was not very impressed. But I won't blame Zar\u00e9's for that since I'm a bone marrow newbie. However, the friend who ordered it said it was not as good as others she had tried in the past.\n\nWe also ordered a side of french fries with saffron aioli. The fries were good and the saffron aioli was great. It was a large side dish, so plan on sharing it. \n\nZar\u00e9 also has some interesting cocktails.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-03-07", "description": "Ladies and Gentlemen, this is how it is done. Chef Hoss Zar\u00e9 and team make an already amazing meal and make it feel like an amazing event to which you have been personally invited. The warmth of Chef, himself, is felt throughout the house as he makes his front of house rounds to make sure all are taken care of.\n\nThe space is just perfect with being big enough to host an assortment of seating styles (family tables, bar tables, dining tables), to a flowing decor and smooth lighting. The space allows for a lively buzz of excited patrons, but does not drown out your enjoyment or experience. \n\nBut enough of that... let's talk about the food! \n\nWe started with the pistachio meatballs in the honey pomegranate glaze.  At the first bite, I slowed down to savor the following, to let the taste of the grass fed beef combine with an exquisitely complimentary glaze. Happily, Zar\u00e9 came to the table and let us know that it was perfectly acceptable to dip our bread into the remaining sauce and wipe it up clean. Not wanting to be rude, I immediately obliged. Repeatedly. \n\nComing in right after the meatballs, the crispy polenta with a smattering of ratatouille. The delicate outside crispiness of the polenta with a fine and warming center was the perfect stage to dollop a divvy of the fresh-made ratatouille right on top. Om nom nom... they were gone but not forgotten. \n\nThe entre\u00e9s came in at perfect timing: The grilled moroccan-style wild salmon,  the risotto with pineapple, the fulton valley half chicken, and the lamb shank abgusht.\n\nWhere do I start? Let's start with my dish. \n\nI had the lamb shank. A beautifully prepared slow cooked lamb shank with impeccable flavor and texture, yet delicate enough to come completely off the bone so every last noshy bit could be coddled and savored with a dime's worth of torshi. Without a hit of gameness, and just enough fat to ensure the proper pinnacle of flavoring, my first  thought of DEAR SWEET LOVE OF GOD THIS IS CRAZY AWESOME almost blurted from my mouth, but took on a more primal moan of gratitude as my eyes rolled to the back of my head. Thankfully that moment was not totally vocalized and I continued to savor the reality in front of me. \n\nMy attention then turned to the risotto. I am a huge fan of risotto, and am in awe of anyone that can accomplish risotto that knocks the socks off of you. Zar\u00e9's risotto takes everything you expect in such a magnificent dish and then amplifies the beauty of the flavor with an unexpected dousing of pineapple. The deliciousness of the mouthful can only be described as climatic NC-17 moment of sensual pleasure.\n\nSaving room for desert, a yummy delight was the torrijas served with a hot chocolate dip with essence  of rose water.  AMAZINGLY fun and again, an  engaging flavor you want to turn back and go, \"I had no idea! I want more!\"\n\nBut.. for the other dish, we had something I can hardly find the approprate words for. It was the Greek yogurt drizzled with honey and I believe panna cotta. Whatever the official title of this heaven sent dish was, i didn't care, I simply wanted another spoonful. [Update: Greek Yogurt Panna Cotta with Truffle Honey. Yes, it is an addictive substance!] I was reckless, tuning out the whole world and I loved being lost in each bite that melted away like a light dusting of snow flavored with happiness. \n\nI was having a religious moment at every turn as every taste bud in my mouth was being caressed by all these fantastically prepared flavors exploding in an orgasmic symphony of salivating bliss. \n\nWhat the world needs now is that rediscovery of what can bring you  bliss. If it is food we must start with, so be it. One mustn't settle for mediocrity and industry-churned filler, one has to really embrace the vibrancy of the entire cornucopia that is literally at your fingertips.  I can definitely tell you that it is a guarantee that myself, my friends and strangers alike will hear of Zar\u00e9 at Fly Trap and will find what I found, and there will be happiness, and I, we and they will be back.", "author": "Dave S."}

This was an early favorite, both Miss S and I adoring the coolness of the dressing with the smoked fish and lovely cucumber strips (we are both cucumber fans).\n\nThe \"pistachio meatball\" is a small appetizer but with a huge taste; a harrisa/honey/pomegranate glaze which is just divine in its sticky sweet-spiceness. \n\nThe cinnamon-braised lamb's tongue with apple chutney and chestnuts. God, I love this dish.... Perfectly tender tongue and the flavors of fruit and spice juxtaposes what becomes umami in the chestnuts. Lovely.\n\nSpice-roasted marrow bones served with bergamot preserves, Persian baby pickles, fresh greens and toast. You know, Bix's marrow bones used to be my favorite, but these have surpassed that. The spice is very subtle and the bergamot preserves, which could be sickly sweet is just a great, clean taste that helps cleanse the palate to the Persian pickle which has quite a bite.\n\nOne entr\u00e9e we shared was the Moroccan-spiced Salmon with toasted fregola, seasonal vegetables, and cucumber raita. Again, the brightness of cucumber and dill complemented the ras al hanout compote with some of the best Salmon I've had in ages. I admit to saving a rather large portion of this to have for breakfast the next day and was not disappointed.\n\nThen there was The Meatball. Six- or eight-inches in diameter, ours was stuffed with two small lamb chops. Barely swimming in a light broth, the meatball was surrounded with a few slices of oven-roasted tomatoes and wild mushrooms. The Meatball had pinenuts, spices, and was so tender and flavorful. There was obviously going to be leftovers and the neighboring table advised eating it cold, on a sandwich. They were right.\n\nTwo desserts were shared; a goat-cheese cheesecake and ..... wait for it ..... Fried Dough! Hoorah! Sing praises to the heavens.... What are called \"fried milk torrijas\" these long, rectangle delights might be the second best hunk of fried dough I've found in the city (Piperade's is a nudge higher on my Fried Dough Scale of ecstasy, but not by much).\n\nWhat a grand night -- and what encouragement for me to get there more often.", "author": "Carolyn T."}

As part of my quest to complete the 7x7 list, my wife and I sat at the bar and had a couple drinks and a couple snacks, including the pistachio meatballs.  The meatballs were tender and delicious, and I really liked the pomegranate reduction.  We also had the lamb burger.  The meat of the burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the lambiness was not hidden or covered up by gratuitous spices or anything like that.  I could used a little something more on the burger -- maybe a sauce, or a cheese, or a spread -- but the meat itself was great.  I also really enjoyed my \"Minted Memory\" cocktail, which was like a cross between a gin mojito and a pimm's cup -- very refreshing.

That said, the foie gras and chicken lovely but sheep a bit gamey. Our salmon main was nicely cooked and the side sauces quite brilliant, but the bulgar (I think that's what it was!) bed was bland; the menu listed this as coming with blue lake green beans but they weren't on our plate.\n\nThird course:\nBiscuit with honey, cream cheese and pineapple that was totally mismatched, heavy and overwhelmed by the sweetness of the honey.

Sadly, the rest of our experience here did not come close.  \n\nFood quality: Inconsistent at best.   \nStarter: crab salad (really, crab morsels over couscous).  Relatively generous portion; flavors could be stronger.  \n\nEntree: \"Filet mignon.\" I asked for mine rare (the server did not ask others at my table how they wanted their steak done).  It was certainly tender, but was also rather bland.  The medjool date they threw on top of the meat was better flavored but felt more like an attempt at a Mediterranean twist than an actual complement to the steak's (lack of) taste.  The scalloped potatoes were a disappointment as well - undercooked and, again, lacking flavor.   \n\nDessert: horrible. \"Not your grandmother's pie.\"  No grandmother would ever want to take credit for this abomination.  In an attempt to play to recent modern dining trends, Zare has \"deconstructed\" a pie: the individual whipped cream, meringue and graham cracker crust components were slathered unappealingly onto a plate, along with a miniscule helping of sorbet.  This is unfortunate, because the sorbet was the only thing I ate that night that had any semblance of actually tasting good.  The rest of the 'pie had a slimy consistency.  \n\n\n\nService:  Ridiculous. We were not given enough bread for everyone in our party, and when we asked for more were told that 'bread service was extra.' Fine - few restaurants nickel and dime this way on top of a ~$100 per head bill, but we move on.  It was our interaction with the manager that bordered on the absurd.  Ryan was petulant, defensive, self-contradictory and downright rude when we asked (politely - voices were never raised) why we were charged for an extra meal that was never brought.  His answers ranged from telling us that we \"should be grateful because we were hooked up with the back room\" (something we never asked for, nor did we really want because it meant breaking our group into two parties), telling us that the \"kitchen is closed\" (there were still people coming into the restaurant as we were leaving), to accusing us of being drunk (nope).  \n\nWe did not let this experience ruin our night, but this is a restaurant to be avoided.", "author": "Sai-Kit C."}

The lunch menu must be new since Fly Trap usually only serve dinner. The 3 of us reviewed the menu online before hand and we really like what they offer for lunch. On their simple lunch menu, they have 4 kinds of salad of different protein: grilled salmon, grilled skirt steak or chicken. Each kind of salad comes with some kind of grains like lentils or bulgur. They also have soup and wraps, which also looks very good. The wraps come with the same type of protein choices. For today, we opted to go with the salad so each of us picked our protein of choice. Mine was the grilled salmon. \n\nWhen my dish arrived, it was served on a delicate platter with the black pearl lentil with some greens served cold on one side and next to it my grilled fillet of salmon topped with tomatoes, basils and chopped red onions salsa. My salmon was seasoned and grilled perfectly. The lentils were really tender and have a nice hit of citrus flavor. It was really refreshing and a great combo with the rich and fatty salmon. My co-worker grilled skirt steak look so juicy and hers came with the bulgur salad. Our other co-worker had the grilled chicken and she said her chicken was really moist and flavorful. We also ordered a side of French Fries to share and it came with ketchup and homemade saffron aioli for dipping. The light yellowish colored saffron aioli was so pungent with the smell of saffron. At the end of the meal, we shared a Goat Cheese Cheesecake that was so decadent, fluffy, light, creamy and had a great taste of the tanginess from the goat cheese. It was a really unusual cheesecake.  \n\nAt first look at our lunch plates, the 3 of us thought the portion was on the smaller side, but as we enjoyed our lunch, we didn't feel that it was lack of food at all. In fact, after the meal, we all agreed that we felt full and satisfied. I think it was because the dishes were packed with so much flavors and the ingredients they use were so fresh and you could taste everything, which leaves us feeling satisfied without feeling stuffed, heavy and kick us into a food coma. \n\nI feel that the portion of lunch dishes they served at Fly Trap is ideal diet and should be adopted by everyone in the country. If all the people in America eat the portion they serve at Fly Trap for every meal and do more physical activities like 20 minutes of workout every day, walk more instead of driving everywhere, I dare to say our country won't have such a high number of people with obesity and other diseases like diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and such. \n\nOverall, a job well done to Fly Trap for serving lunch at an affordable price so that I have a new place to go eat during work days. Also a pad on the shoulder for serving healthy, flavorful dishes at the RIGHT portion so that we can indulge without compromising our health and waistline.

So we had a decent meal, the food is pretty good, but with a party of seven, we were asked to be quiet repeatedly!  I want to have a good time and be able to laugh with friends.  They moved us once, which we graciously obliged, and then they asked us to leave \"because of the customers.\"  Honestly, don't ever go here with a group.  Very unfriendly owner and life is too short.  This is not a fine dining experience.  I don't know how they think they are kidding. Mean people don't get my customer support.", "author": "Taylor T."}

At least that's what I was expecting.  What I found was a restaurant with very good service and OK food that was not nearly so highly spiced as I had thought.\n\nI started with spicy tomato soup that was nice enough but not particularly spicy.  I suppose that it is not tomato high season as the taste of tomato was ephemeral.  It was there but there wasn't that bright tang of tomato that I was hoping for. \n\nA salad of smoked trout and julienned cucumber was also OK.  The trout was nicely smoked, firm, tasty.  But the cucumber was ice cold and so not especially tasty.  As I ate and the cucumber warmed the plate livened.  \n\nFinally a huge, falling off the bone lamb shank.  Very nice.  Usually when I get meat, I wish for more meat and fewer vegetables.  Here I wished for more of the black eyed peas and potatoes that came with the lamb.  Nice food but an additional garnish with the meat would have helped.  \n\nI guess I just not so enthusiastic about Zare as most.  A matter of taste.", "author": "David D."}

My entree was the pan roasted sea bass and my gf had the half-chicken, both were excellent and made up for the soup misstep. We also had a plate of fries with saffron aioli. For dessert I had the blueberry pie and she had the rocky road, both were seriously good and a nice way to end the meal.\n\nOur server was attentive and knowledgeable about the dishes, but he did have a few lapses here and there, mainly forgetting to give us our leftovers.

Makes the meanest Orange Drops around!\n\nWednesday we decided on dinner there, had a guest from out of town and wanted to share this gem with him. Strolled in about 8:50 and were told the kitchen was closing. But they graciously seated us anyway and we ordered drinks waiting for the 4th person to show.  Still no 4th. We order while waiting. My porcini mushroom soup was delicious as well as my friends crab cake.  Finally she arrives and they were nice enough to take her order, though you can plainly see the restaurant is thinning out, tables being readied for tomorrow, etc. Jay is gracious and is our server as well as bartender.

There is a bit quieter back room. We are relatively new to Persian food. This is only the 2nd place we've gone for it. The place we usually go is in Marin is great beyond all possible measure. Fly Trap's culinary offerings dissapointed both my hubby and myself. His soup seemed heavy with yuky tasting herbs and way too vinegary. My meat ball appetizer (one of the house specials) was nothing I would ever intentionally eat unless I was starving (which I was). They goosed it up in a sweet tart sauce and it was hard to tell whether this was a dessert with a meatball or the other way around. In fairness to them, that was all we ordered. If you like a noisy nice looking place and lots of tartness in your food, this is the place for you. The food is very fusion which I don't mind in and of itself. Someone told me they changed up their menu a couple of months ago. Maybe this is the fallout from the new eats ???", "author": "Barbara S."}

I was not expecting this when I made the reservation through Open Table, but the restaurant called me in advance to let me know and I appreciated that. It was a sign of good things to come, as all the wait staff and servers were exceptionally friendly and un-stuffy for a place with such an old school vibe.\n\nBy far the best things I tried were the initial courses- there was a delicious parsnip soup that converted me to parsnip fandom, and a saffron & mushroom risotto cake with a really lovely chantrelle sauce. Yay for chantrelles.  These were also the dishes that felt more Californian too me.  The entrees, while plated all fancy-like with a swirl of this and a dash of that, had more of the persian flavors I was expecting but after the appetizers they seemed to fall a bit flat.\n\nThe wine list was nice and the cocktail menu looked interesting- I'd definitely come back for a drink and a light snack, and as for a full dinner I'm adding this to my list of \"slightly fancy places that it's still OK to take my parents to\"", "author": "saru k."}

Full disclosure: I organized the group of 12 that dined there with the other lady.  I agree that the restaurant is a wonderful experience.  It is a small restaurant, to keep in mind if you've got a big group, though they have a section in the back for big groups.  The food is fabulous, flavors subtle yet intense.  The chef is amazing, and actually well-trained (for foodies) and it shows.  He brings his experience and his Persian culture to bring a wonderful fusion.\n\nI had a great little martini with some sort of complex mint rosewater cucumber reduction.  Sounds complicated but really yummy and artful.  They had a wonderful little dish with a poached duck egg that I had with chickpeas.  And great appetizers.  And panna cotta was great though one said the beer caramel syrup could stand to be lost.\n\nAnd very reasonably priced, a big plus when you're eating in Soma-- compared with Ame and its peers this place is a bargain.  Yet elegant.  The only thing that drove costs up was several orders of olives and bread as appetizers as we had a big group and I figured can't go wrong.  Some restaurants have these complementary but I don't blame Zare for charging for quality. (You can skip these and order real appetizers.)\n\nAnd it is definitely grown-up dining.

Seems like a great place to grab a drink and some appetizers for a zip back in time.\n\nFood was not as desirable  Fois gras dish (menage a fois or something like that) contained 3 types of liver, none which were \"true\" fois gras.  Meat balls were good, but not great.  The duck was over cooked and dry (really should check this on the line before serving).  Lamburger was good.  The sauces didn't have much flavor to them.  However, the iced tea infused w/ pomegranate was great tho.\n\nIt might just be my palette and I'm just not really into the middle eastern \"essence\" - i.e. gamey tastes coupled with tart / sugars.

Even the entry way into the restaurant is unique and makes it feel sort of tucked away. I like the art deco-ish furnishing. The place settings really beautiful. The live pianist is a nice touch that adds an air of elegance. It has a classy ambiance and can be a nice romantic spot. \n\nThen I got to the food. My companion and I shared the prosciutto with cantaloupe and figs, which was short of fresh and the pairing with the fruits seemed uninspired. We also shared the crab cake over a bed of arugula salad. I heard a lot about the crab cake, but didn't realize it was TINY. And for some reason, the arugula was sprinkled with so much salt I almost gagged. I know salt's making a comeback in SF restaurants, but there was no reason why simple arugula had to be so salty.\n\nMy companion had the crab ravioli which were huge and very tasty. Could definitely tell it was made fresh. I got the chicken jerusalem since it's been raved about here. But I was disappointed; the chicken itself was nice and tender, but it was bathed in so much cream it was like the dish was cream with some chicken in it. Every bite I took I was thinking, \"boy, this sure is going straight to my thighs.\" This is my preference, if you're a cream kind of person then this is heaven for you.\n\nThe biggest reason I gave 3 stars was the service was so overzealous. Every other minute either our server or the buser would come ask how's everything/are you finished? The restaurant was full, but it wasn't like there's a line out the door. We were seated in the back room that was kind of partitioned off from the main dining room so it was more private.

Best fries I ever ate.. They stayed crisp and good even after they were cold. Top shelf cocktails ($10). Ask for the back room where it is quieter.", "author": "Lois M."}

The egg white on top was like sabayon or the top of a hot toddy.  My scallops & tagliatelle were nicely done, as was my husband's salmon with couscous. Our friend really liked the combination of the chicken with prosciutto and cheese.  And the unconstructed pie and goat cheesecake were delicious.\nThe minuses: super hot inside.  We might have stayed for an after-dinner drink and coffee, but we just couldn't manage the heat any longer.  We told our waitress, who seemed to smile knowingly, as if that wasn't the first time she'd heard the complaint.  And our appetizers, which sounded so good based on other reviews, were disappointing.  My meatballs were dry and the pomegranate sauce was a congealed mess.  There wasn't enough marrow to even enjoy on the dish my husband ordered, and there was nothing memorable about the lamb sausage.\nI'd go again, but I suggest skipping these appetizers.  Oh. And wear something light.", "author": "Ann B."}

But the main dishes left me unfullfilled. The chicken was blah-honestly best word for it. The Seabass was bland and covered in some olivey tapade. The fish tasted like it came from Costco. And the risotto-yeah I wouldnt have minded it if I didnt foresee the consumption of it later on showing up on my rear end.\n\nAnd lets not forget the grand finale: the dessert the \"Chocolate Suprise\". Basically a piece of flavorless cocoa cake with some salty caramel and a side of cracker jacks. Not a good suprise.\n\nIm glad my date disliked this as well so now I can vent openly about my true feelings of this place!", "author": "Heather S."}

The chicken liver was just ok and the sheep's liver was tough and not-very-tasty.\n\nBaby octopus and calamari salad: This was one of my favorites of the night. The beans were probably not necessary - but then again, I'm not the hugest fan of beans - but the octopus and calamari were to die for. The lemon on top was the perfect touch.\n\nLamb burger: It was good, not great. \n\nSaffron risotto: Second favorite of the night. It tasted like a macaroni and cheese dish, but just a tad lighter. Very flavorful.\n\nChocolate surprise dessert: Totally not a fan - I was not \"surprised\" at all. Bland, boring, not very exciting. The only thing that saved it were the housemade \"cracker jacks.\"\n\nThey also just changed their Tempranillo, which I personally felt was not a good change...I came for HH a few months ago, and thought that Tempranillo was much better.\n\nOverall - good service, ok food, a little pricey for what you get.", "author": "Adrienne C."}

The portions aren't huge, but certainly tasty. \n\nMy most recent dinner included the pork chop, a generous cut of meat that was perfectly cooked. It came with mashed potatoes and spinach and a superb brown sauce. The cut was lean too, which meant that everything but the bone was to be eaten and enjoyed. \n\nAdditionally, there is a decent wine list and full bar available. Some of the house cocktails are quite good, albeit a bit on the \"chick drink\" side of coin. \n\nAfter numerous visits, I have yet to be disappointed, and the food has been great.

Served piping hot (hit the spot after walking around the city in cold, rainy weather), the first few spoonfuls were delightful, full of flavor, but as it cooled, became very acidic, and made it hard for me to finish.

For example, I realized after ordering the chicken (sounded really good - included artichokes and mushrooms in a cream sauce) that I probably don't like tarragon - which is the spice it was seasoned with. That's my bad. However, my soup starter (somewhat unappealing referred to as \"yesterday's soup\" - irony not appreciated in this case) was a lobster bisque topped with crab, and that was pretty universally tasty.\n\nThe restaurant boasts a really nice bar and actually shares the space with an Indian joint you can walk through to next door. Service was fine, and the wine list is okay, if a bit pricey (maybe it's just that the waiter recommended the only $13 glass of red on the menu).\n\nSo...if you like Mediterranean food, give it a try - it's my understanding that's what the faire here is now, and that's a change from the original establishment. If you don't, it probably won't really be your thing. Perhaps come here for a drink instead if you work nearby, as it may be a nice change of pace.", "author": "Kiesha R."}

It wasn't bad, it just didn't meet my expectations after walking in.  It was pretty simple and the flavor was decent.  Nothing bad, but definitely nothing worth paying approximately $19 - 25 per entree for.  I tried the salmon which was cooked nicely, but paired with some rather boring mash potatoes and a simple salad.  I also tasted the pork chop which was a little tough but came with a good sauce.  The bar, however, provided great drinks to make up for things.\n\nThe other setback was the service.  It was extremely SLOW and my water glass was completely empty for about 85% of the evening.

We decided to split the \"Not Your Grandmother's Key Lime Pie\" which has all the components for key lime pie in little piles (graham crust crumbs, lemon curd, coconut meringue and preserved lime) and you just sweep a fork along each one and it tastes just like pie. mmmm.\n\nAlso, the waiter was really great at suggesting wines to compliment our meals and that was a big help because although he admitted to being there just two weeks- he was so well versed in the menu and very very helpful! I appreciated that. Also, Hoss Zare comes out and talks to the various tables asking about the meals and how they are going. It's a rare occasion that I see this happen and I thought it helped with the whole ambiance of this place.\n\nThis place may just become one of my favourite places here in the city, hands down.\n\nReal talk.", "author": "Lauren S."}

Courses were steeped in quality ingredients and careful preparation.\n\nMy favorites were the pistachio meatballs and the filet mignon with gorgonzola. The dessert brioche with rose-water chocolate milk was super original, and tasty to boot. I personally would not order the fried mozzarella with anchovies again.\n\nThe service, from accommodating our last-minute reservation with smiles, to our friendly + attentive server and floor staff, was excellent. Chef Zare could be seen working the floor too, and he even checked in on our table and later presented us with a complimentary chevre cheesecake on shortbread cookie. Delicious.\n\nHandsome space- attractive and tailored without being stuffy. The elements at Zare were soothing and comforting.\n\nGreat night and my visiting mother, sister and friend were very happy. I'm coming back and trying the lamb burger!", "author": "Matt T."}

Overall, couldn't have been happier with the service and food.\n\nWe ate at the bar which was very pleasant. The bartender was very nice, attentive, and interesting to speak with. As far as the food, we ordered the pistachio meatballs (the special meatballs they make on monday's were all sold out!) and the smoked trout. Both were delicious but I was really impressed by the trout. The presentation was great and the flavors were amazing. After our apps, we ordered the sourdough bread & lavash, yogurt marinated flat iron steak kebob, and fried buffalo mozzarella. Everything was tasty but I particularly liked the kebob. The yogurt was refreshing with the bread the steak was well prepared.\nAnd finally for dessert we ordered a deconstructed cake...can't remember what it was called. I'd never seen a dessert presented like this before. The cake was broken out into its components -  from the meringue to the sauce etc. etc. It was very good but the best part was you could eat more of the section of the cake you like. \n\nWe had the pleasure to meet the chef at the end of our meal. Very nice and approachable. He was kind enough to offer us a glass of Muscat which was phenomenal and a great way to finish off a fantastic meal.\nI was impressed by the food, the chef, and the overall service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-12-02", "description": "While I might try a regular dinner there in the future,as I have been to every one of Chef Zare's restaurants and loved them in the past, I was very disappointed in the large private party they hosted for us for a birthday. We had a guest list of 35-40 people, and no one at the restaurant told us that was going  be a HUGE squeeze in the private room. There wasn't room for most people to sit, and it was hotter than you-know-what with no air after a relatively short time. (yeah I should have seen the room before hand but they PROMISED me it would be no problem. I see now that  they have changed their website about that) \n\nI also made clear I wanted to have PLENTY of food (I'm Italian ,after all) and I wanted plenty of appetizers and snacks. The party manager, Mario, refused to  give me any numbers or guidelines of what or how much to  order - which I found bizarre. Hey I don't know how big your apps are, I'm not a chef or party host, YOU tell ME how much to order , isn't that how it works. I tried every which way to ask the question, and finally asked if I could pay a set amount per person for all the food we could eat - even it it was a high price per person at least I'd know  the food was enough. Mario said the chef \"wasn't comfortable with that.\" Fine, I probably wouldn't be either, but then give me some guidelines. Especially as the apps were per piece and not per person. Mario finally said \"8 -10 pieces should be plenty for the appetizers\" so I ordered 10 pieces per person AND french fries AND the birthday cakes. \n\nSO we get to the party, only 28 people show up so I figure there'll be plenty right? NO. I had to order several more platters because people were still hungry (as was I) I was really embarrassed. I made it clear the money was not the issue, I wanted people to have plenty and they didn't even after the extra food. \n\nThe other point I'd mention is that Mario was VERY hard to get a hold of, once I'd signed the contract. He kept saying my cell phone didn't work or the number was wrong,  when I gave him the number several times, and called  myself to make sure it was working. He stopped responding to emails and didn't even confirm the menu till I called the restaurant several times. \n\nAnd after reading all the notes about  how friendly Chef Zare was, and how he comes out to meet people - he didn't even stop by our party to say hello to us. I spent almost $2000 on the evening, and we did have a good time with friends  and family,  but when I sent a note mentioning these items,  I didn't even get a response till I called the restaurant several times. And Mario's response was \"Did you expect something from us about this? in a really rude way.\n\n I think they took on the party for financial reasons,  and don't really want to do them. \n .", "author": "Roberta D."}

The ambiance was lovely and intimate, with just the right amount of lighting: dim, but not too dim so you can't see the person across the table. It isn't too personal that if you aren't there on a date you don't feel out of place. The service was wonderful and so attentive--the server checked on us multiple times without being intrusive, and even Chef Hoss Zare came by twice to see how we were doing. \n\nNow the most important bit--the food! And my, was it delicious. A few of us split the pistachio meatballs, which were excellent: the sweetness of the pomegranate/honey glaze complemented the nutty meatiness. The smoked pheasant salad was fresh and quite good. I especially appreciated the combination of figs and the pleasantly smoky but not too gamy pheasant. For the main course, most of us went for the risotto of the day with lamb neck. The risotto was stuffed in a cute pumpkin shaped green squash with some type of green onion. The cheesy-but-not-too-cheesy risotto played very well with the bittersweetness of the onion and the fresh firmness of the squash. Because we were splurging, we all split the goat cheese cheesecake, and it was fabulous. I've made quite a few cheesecakes in my time, and this one was particularly fluffy from the goat cheese and not too sweet. It almost melted on your tongue, and thankfully not really dense like some cheesecakes can be. A great end to a great meal.", "author": "Nora M."}

I felt a calling to one day come to know what this place was all about.  By chance, thanks through a suggestion from the world of social media I was connected to the infamous Chef at \"Fly Trap\" and knew that one day I would step foot in this artistic and welcoming restaurant that enveloped me with a warm embrace from its comfort food and inviting hospitality.  A place that echos history and culture yet with a hip-happy and classy ambiance, we started off with a creative cocktail \"Anar Daiquiri\" with a pistachio salted rim and settled into our first appetizer that was sure to refresh our senses. We had the pleasure of our rock star chef to graciously describe what our taste buds were about to experience.  Continued with several distinctive appetizers while my mouth watered as I savored the most amazing eggplant. What a treat when were introduced to the fried brussel sprouts and the \"Minted Memory\" Cocktail to wash down the last of our final dishes and our tantalizing desserts.

He is very \"hands on\" in the dining room, I am always amazed how many patrons personally seek him out to thank him...I think I hugged him twice last night!\nThe food, where should I begin?\nThe chef's creativity is showcased in the Mediterranean/Persian/Californian menu, including things like pistachio meatballs and a bone marrow appetizer (it doesn't sound good, but it is amazingly tasty and rich).  Everyone at the table was overwhelmed with the flavors...I had the Salmon and it was excellent...the grapefruit reduction and the raspberries gave it such a unique flavor. \nWe shared the blueberry pie served with a wonderful lemon basil gelato and the Rocky Road desserts between the three of us.

My friend had the Wild Salmon...I didnt taste it but from what he says it was pretty good. The lighting is a little dark for me. And there was no a/c inside the back.

They're a little sweet and tangy due to the pomegranate molasses sauce, which was a very nice contrast to the lamb. Yum. My husband seemed to enjoy his salad, but it was pretty standard stuff: greens, shaved parm, you know the drill. \nI had the salmon with israeli couscous and charmoula for my entree, and although I loved the couscous and charmoula, the salmon had a bit too much charring going on. It had been charred on the grill, but the result was that you tasted mostly char, and couldn't actually taste the fish. Husband really enjoyed his lamb burger, although he thought the bun could be improved upon. I enjoyed the one wee little bite he let me have. The fried brioche and chocolate dessert was pretty decent, a lot like a churro with chocolate. \nWe both really liked the interior, and the service. \nOverall, I think this place is a great addition to the neighborhood and I would certainly come back, but I do think there is some room for improvement for the food in terms of execution.", "author": "Michelle A."}

I had the cauliflower soup and a side of green beans with feta. I am an expert at soup, and the addition of apples, bacon, and an undertone of Mediterranean spice was better than my recipe. My young, male co-workers raved about the vegetables - I'm not making this up! The beef entrees were cooked exactly as ordered, and the Ahi salad Nicoise stole the show. Beautiful olives.

The decor was very appropriate to the character of the food and the restaurant.\n\nFor a starter, I couldn't resist the cauliflower apple soup.  The soup itself was velvety smooth- as it should be- and I could tell that the chef had strained it carefully to achieve the texture.  In terms of the flavors, it was very well-balanced and surprising; you get a taste of the cauliflower, the apple, and the bacon with every bite.  It was a fatastic way to begin the meal.\n\nFor an entree, I had the flat-iron steak with the taro root mash; it was fantastic!  The steak was crusted in bleu cheese and cooked perfectly- most restaurants won't serve me a proper rare steak; the chef at Zare wasn't afraid to serve it to me black and blue.  I had a opportunity to sample the other two entrees at my table as well, and both the lamb shank and the salmon were superb.  I don't even like salmon, but I loved this dish.  Very creative and a great summer dish.\n\nFor dessert we had the blueberry cake and the rocky road.  I could have done without the blueberry cake- the balance between the tartness and sweetness was a little off.  The rocky road, however, was phenomenal.  Excellent flavors and a very creative spin on a classic flavor profile.\n\nAll in all, this is a restaurant worth experiencing.

Now that he is back to his roots he appears ready to be more playful with his flavors. Even at Cafe Zare on Polk, many years ago, one could count on whimsical touches to the spice of even a simple tomato sauce. Now he's taking this to the next level.\n\nIf you don't like to be challenged by assertive flavors, make sure to ask the staff, since dishes like salmon in a pink grapefruit reduction have strong and occasionally shocking flavors. If you can go with them, they are delicious..If not, well the hangar steak with blue cheese is probably more your style.\n\nMake no mistake. This is not Middle Eastern food. Nor is it Fusion, California or the same old same old SF Med/French/Brasserie/Whatever.\nIt's just Zare. Zare takes what he knows and recombines it with his audience in mind. It's all good and it's all interesting, but it can be aback taking at times.", "author": "Otto S."}

I ordered the roasted baby eggplant and it was blah, and i love eggplant.  the fried onions on the plate were good though.  Our dinners were the worst.  My husband and I both ordered the drunken chicken- bland, bland, bland.  The chicken was just- chicken, and it was sitting on a very bland white cream sauce, with no flavor.

The guy apologized, but nothing more was done.  Luckily I wasn't wearing white.  I ordered a dessert since I was still hungry.  I ordered the \"not your mother's pie\" it was deconstructed lemon meringue, and several of us agreed it was the best thing that arrived at the table all day.  The white wine we had, an Albarinho was also quite good.  After we received the bill we payed and continued to sit and chat.  The waiter asked if he could take the bill, and we said yes.

The company was fabulous, but the food and service - horrible.", "author": "Nica W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-11-26", "description": "Thanksgiving night. Reservations were made for 8 pm. We walk into the restaurant and stand there for about 8 minutes. Not a soul greets us, not even the servers or bussers acknowledge our presence in the hostess' behalf. Finally the hostess comes and tells us there will be a little bit of a wait, why not wait at their bar...sure, that's alright by me...but the thing is the bar was full and there was no where to even stand by the bar, until some people eventually get seated...then, once again, the bartender just does not seem to mind anyone even if the bar finally had some open space (we were not the only ones neglected)...after trying my patience even more (I used to work in a restaurant, and so I know how it can be...but this was ridiculous!!!), I walked over to her and politely asked her to take our order of drinks. She then paid attention. ...told myself I would let it go....then about 45 minutes pass. Not once did anyone even communicate with us if we wanted more drinks, that they were sorry we had to wait so long, or offer any bread ....anything! We stuck around because, where else were we to go on this evening? Finally, we sat and I told myself to make the most of the evening. \n\nTo be fair, the food was fantastic and absolutely delicious (although I did ask for some olive oil and balsamic vinegar for my bread, and the busser brought a bottle of olive oil that had barely any! Not even enough for a piece of bread!!).... the food came pretty fast as well. The kitchen/back-of-the-house crew did a fantastic job!! BRAVO! As for our server, it was very obvious it was just a job to him...\n\nFly Trap had a great ambience and the food was spectacular, and although this was the case,our experience and moods had already changed into a non-festive dissapointment.......the front-of-the-house crew that evening do not belong in the restaurant/hospitality industry. They made our Thanksgiving experience horrible. The worst customer service I have ever experienced. They were not rude, but they were just doing nothing at all. No greeting, no communication, no warmth...no nothing. I did look for a manager, and there seemed to have been none that evening. No one fit the part of one that would be working in a restaurant that was supposed to be excellent!!  This is too bad because I think Fly Trap has so much potential.\n\nI will watch out for the future of the Chefs, but I will never bother choosing Fly Trap again....and trust me, we were not the only ones who felt this way that evening. The table next to us waited over 20 minutes for their order to be taken, I even offered them some of our bread and food!!\n\nTo the Manegement: Hire people who enjoy being hospitable and who enjoy being in the industry. Good luck. No pun intended...the industry is just not for everyone.", "author": "Isabel L."}

The 1st was earlier this year with a food group honoring noted cookbook author, Marlena Spieler. On that occasion, a special menu was prepared for us which was excellent & the nice thing was I didn't have to try to figure what to order. I decided to go back with my family & my sister & her family for our Easter dinner...This time we had to order on our own...No matter...everything we ordered was DELICIOUS!  Of the 9 of us, 4 had the Lamb Shank Abgusht, which was the best we had ever eaten...the meat was juicy, tender, flavorful & fell off the bone (like it's suppose to!)...2 people had the Oxtail Tagliatelle & that was GOOD, too! 1 had the Ghormeh Sabzi, which is a fresh herb stew with short ribs & I got to sample some of that, which was GOOD, GOOD, GOOD! My husband had his usual pork chops & the brussel sprouts accompanying it was very tasty...and someone had the filet mignon which I guess was also good (I didn't get to taste any of it because that person wouldn't share since he liked it so much!). I also have to mention the appetizers because they were the best: pistachio meatballs, grilled lamb sausage, a side of french fries (we didn't order enough!) & my favorite, spice-roasted bone marrow (I could've eaten more of this, too!)...The desserts were quite memorable as well: goat cheese cheesecake (with medjool dates & toasted walnuts), not your grandma's pie (lemon curd,coconut meringue, coconut sorbet with saffron-mint syrup...yum, yum, yum), and fried milk torrijas (served with rose water hot chocolate)!!!!! We were all quite full (as the portions are generous), happy & satisfied!", "author": "Karen Y."}

What a experience for a happy hour with appetizers, okay so it's a cheaper option but that doesn't mean screw up the food and have attitude towards your customers. I don't know what was worse, the food or the service. My husband and I had high expectations about this place, I happen to work nearby so from outside it always looks nice, good location and even inside it have quite a charm and good vibe but I guess it's just that...  The service is a huge problem two words: arrogant and pretentious. Then the food comes as a problem, first they were out of salmon even though we were the first ones to arrive at 4pm when nobody else was in there. So after the first deception we start ordering couple of plates like the French fries with saffron aioli sauce, which I don't have any complaint at all but truly who can messed up a simple dish like that. Then the risotto saffron balls with marinara sauce came and I thought: \"okay this doesn't look very tasty but let's give a try\", big mistake! I think they have those little balls in the freezer for decades and because of that they were mushy and flavorless, the sauce even worse. Finally a bigger ball combination of beans, mushrooms and herbs arrived and once more a boring plate, lack of essence and personality I mean nothing memorable to neither remember nor recommend. So I guess we felt on the trap, too bad.\nI almost forgot the beverages, I guess because its also nothing special.", "author": "Pepperchik p."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-06-18", "description": "Preface:  I wrote this review about a year ago when my coworkers and I were \"comparing notes\" on our experience(s) at The Fly Trap.\n\nIf you work or live in SOMA, chances are you've eaten at The Fly Trap Restaurant.  If you've eaten at The Fly Trap Restaurant, chances are you liked it.  The Fly Trap Restaurant has served up delicious dishes in San Francisco since 1906 - first at 73 Sutter, then at 515 Golden Gate, and now at 606 Folsom. Even though it's been in business for 100 years, it never tried to be \"popular\".  People know about this restaurant not by glitzy advertisements or a brand name chef but rather by word of mouth.  That is probably the best advertisement for a business - clientele endorsement.  \n\nI've eaten at The Fly Trap three or four times and every time I came out full and satisfied.  The menu offers classic Californian cuisine that you can count on. Portion sizes are just enough to fill your appetite without stuffing you to the rim.  I can't remember everything I've eaten there thus far, but there are three that I will always remember.  For lunch one time I had the Chicken Coq Au Vin.  It's a demi-glazed piece of white and dark meat chicken served with mushrooms, bacon, roasted potatoes, red wine, thyme, and pearl onions.  The meat was juicy and the flavor of all the ingredients complimented each other perfectly.  For dessert on another occasion I had the Crme Brule.  I loved the consistency and the right-on-the-money sweetness.  I don't like desserts that are too sweet and this one was just right for me.  Still yet on another occasion when I went for happy hour drinks at the bar, I ordered a Bruchetta to go with my beer.  If you love garlic and basil as much as I do, then you'll love this dish.  If you don't, then stay far far away.  The garlic flavor stayed with me the entire night and I loved it.  This was the best Bruchetta I've eaten ever.  I should also mention that their bar has a very good selection of beer.\n\nAlthough the atmosphere tends to lean towards business casual, I never really felt the \"business\" part of it.  I've always felt calm and relaxed. Another impression I have of this restaurant is that there is absolutely no pretense, neither from the staff nor from the other clientele.   Everyone there is about food and food only.  This is often lost at other restaurants in the area.  As far as service goes, it's what you would expect from a restaurant.  The right amounts of efficiency and courteousness.\n\nThe Fly Trap is a restaurant I would go back over and over again.  It's so close to me that I can go frequently.  The only thing that stops me from going too frequently is its prices.  At about $20-$30 per entre for dinner and $15-$25 per entre for lunch, it's not steep enough to break the bank in one shot but definitely not an everyday affair for the average worker bee like me.  Finally, The Fly Trap is a restaurant I feel comfortable and confident recommending to people.", "author": "Irene T."}

My main course was too salty, as if an entire cellar of salt had been dumped on the unsuspecting butter lettuce to make up for its inherent lack of flavor. The crispy prosciutto, to which I had been looking forward, was a lump of salt. I've never liked dressings on salads for this precise reason: that because of those who are afraid of green meals, restaurants have made a practice of disguising lettuce and its relatives like a blemish or poor relation. I say free the natural flavor of greens. The ultimate goal of a chef should be to enhance a flavor, not sweep it under the rug.

The Fly Trap is a key ingredient.  With a singer who sounds like she was transported from a hot underground speakeasy, hot crusty bread and butter and exotic old school items like celery salad and sweatbreads.  Personally these things don't get me so riled up, mostly I enjoyed the quiet dark interior, scrumptious veal tortellini and the flicker of the attentive waiters eyes.  Go here, and take your parents.", "author": "Lindsey M."}

Fortunately, the only noticeable decor changes were a change in accent paint colors and an addition of a community dining table.  There are new faces behind the bar and they have a new cocktail menu.  But the big difference was in the food.  We always loved the old Fly Trap but the food was just \"OK by SF standards\".  Now, the food is really very good.  I had the trout appetizer and the lamb shank entree.  Both were delicious.  They also upped their game on the wine list.  We are happy to see that the changes to the decor didn't affect the love we have for the Fly Trap and the new chef/owner should be proud.  \n\n~ To the previous reviewer, I can understand your frustration.  When you tried to make your rezo in March, the old ownership had short-timers affliction.  I encourage you to try again with the new owners.", "author": "Bradley T."}

The food was exquisite -- the pistachio meatballs, the baba ganoush and the lamb dishes were all amazing.  But the service definitely didn't live up to the food.

The food is delicious, my favorite being the various soups I've had there. I'm a vegetarian, so I haven't tried any of the meat dishes but all the friends I've eaten with there have loved them. The deserts (deconstructed apple pie, the beignets, and the porfiteroles) were all fantastic.  The service is warm, friendly and attentive. I organized a group of 13 last Saturday and the staff worked with us before dinner to make sure everything was taken care of. The bar also makes great cocktails and good conversation. Highly recommend this place to anybody who wants a great evening.", "author": "Aditya B."}

My dad talked me into trying out this joint after a Cubs/Giants game and I think we could have done better at the Chophouse(not saying much).

The service was decent and our bread/water was refilled often, perfect for a dehydrated Giants fan. Two stars pending review.", "author": "Christopher V."}

We had the stake, Soup of Yesterday, and grazed eggplants.  They were all ok.  We couldn't finish them because everything lacked the subtlety and sophistication that we looked for.

I was just walking around looking for a place to have lunch before a meeting at US EPA.  When I looked at the menu on the outside, I knew that this was the right place.  I was a little early (11:30) but I was surprised that it wasn't more crowded.  I had a hard time picking just one dish - they all sounded so good.  I had the lentil salmon salad - it was great!  The lentil salad had little tiny chopped pieces of endive, fennel, red pepper ub it and a deliciuos salsa tied the salmon and salad together.  So flavorful!  It was just the right amont for lunch - not too much, not too little.  The price of $10.00 was perfect too.  After that, I blew my south beach diet plan and had the goat cheesecake - it was amazing.  This place should be packed, given the incredible (and healthy) food and such a decent price for lunch.  If you City people don't appreciate this place for lunch, maybe we can lure them to Sacramento!", "author": "Kathryn T."}

The meat was sooo tender and delicious, only downside was some of the pasta was hard (probably due to being precooked and sitting under heat waiting to be made). The delight of the night was surprisingly the french fries with a saffron dipping sauce side order and the goat cheese cheesecake. Yummm! The cheesecake was so smooth and light. The service was great too. We had some miscommunication with our hotel car picking us up and left us.  We left the restaurant, and was waiting outside for the car to come but some how the driver did not see us and we did not see him. The driver was suppose to call my cell to tell us he was there but instead he went into the restaurant to check where we were. The host told him we left already. Even though the restaurant was not responsible they still came out and apologized for sending our hotel car away.  I was very impressed considering the hotel car didn't even apologize for not calling.", "author": "Jess H."}

I was organizing an event for my coworkers and happened upon  the Fly Trap.   I had checked online and the place looked great and I was in charge of providing options for a lunch meeting for my job.  I had called to find out the pricing, availability, etc.  I called the first time and someone picked up and hung up on me.   I thought this odd since the placed looked so nice on the internet.  I waited about an hour later and called back.  The woman that answered the phone just said \"hello\".  I was not sure if she was a customer or employee.  I then asked if this is the Fly Trap and she responded with \"yeah\".  There was no mention of \" how can I help you\" or anything professional.  I mentioned that I wanted to discuss having a lunch party at the trap.  She said \"hold on\".  I was on hold for about 15 minutes before I finally gave up.  I will hold when I think the place is really busy but fifteen minutes is a crazy long time to wait when I am trying to get them to take my company meeting. I attempted a third time to contact them and left a message for someone to call me back to discuss schedules and pricing.  Never got a call back from anyone at the Fly Trap.  I think 3 attempts is plenty and if they are not professional enough to handle customers in a better way, i would take my business elsewhere.  This was back in March and so we just decided to go to Buca De Peppo in a last minute crunch while waiting for call back from the Fly Trap.  They actually returned calls and were willing to assist us which was more than the fly trap offered.  Judging by the reviews from the other Yelpers, they all had better experiences than I did so maybe the Fly Trap works better when you just have smaller parties.", "author": "Adam B."}

We thought we might never see him and his lovely Cal-Med cuisine again. Then looking around Yelp for a place to eat last Saturday, I find Zare at Fly Trap. Now the Fly Trap (pre-Zare) was a neat place. The space reminded me of something from another era. The menu was certainly from another era - Shrimp Louis, Clams Casino, other classic yet stale American fare. So this combination seemed like a match made in heaven - a cool space with a hot chef. My wife had the buratta app, while I started with the butter lettuce salad. We shared a plate of the fries with saffron aioli. The food was very good. My wife had a half bottle of a white burgundy off the small, but thorough wine list. For our main courses, wifey had the salmon served with roasted fregola (couscous on steroids) and veggies. I had the lamb shank, which was outrageously tender and beautifully spiced. We finished with a goat cheese cheesecake. I was especially excited about this. At his prior place, the kitchen was so small desserts were somewhat of an after-thought and I thought they never quite held up. But this cheesecake was outstanding. It was less tangy than I expected, but the texture was unbelievable. It was so soft and smooth, rich without being too sweet. Overall, it was a great experience. The prices were reasonable. The service friendly and attentive. Hoss, It was so good to see you again.", "author": "Alex C."}

The brown sauce which accompanied the frenched chicken legs tasted of absolutely of nothing, no taste at all. Most items which were not pickled lacked salt.\nWe were promised leg of lamb on the menu instead we were served small portion of lamb shank in a tasteless broth.\nWine paring consisted of some unknown white and red wines whichever you chose at unlimited pouring, that is it.!

My sexy, sexy date suggested that I get the salmon, and it was so good I felt like I shoulda jumped under the table and gotten busy with him right then and there. Sriusly tho the salmon melts in your mouth like butta and it comes with mashed taters. We split the Arugula salad with pears, candied walnuts and goat cheese...i think the description speaks for itself about how good it was.

The space itself is the perfect size composed of an intimate bar, sleek communal tables  perfect for a casual drink/appetizer, and comfortable banquets. The warm lighting and cozy ambiance invite you to linger over your meal. The staff is impecable, each element; chef, pastry chef, sommelier, bar manager are extremely cool, friendly and knowledgeable. Everything on the menu has an ecclectic Mediterranean twist using fresh ingredients to achieve a clean and flavorful taste in your mouth. The pistachio lamb meatballs, lamb tongue with white asparagus, grilled whole sardines with heirloom tomatoes and cucumber, and smoked trout with creme fraiche, cucumber strands and salmon roe were spectaculer. We were very lucky to have each of these courses masterfully paired with the perfect wine, they have a vast selection! Although we were too full for dessert we managed to fit it in and I am glad we did. The goat cheese cheesecake with marinated figs and a shortbread crust was the best cheesecake I have ever had, so light and airy. Also not to be missed was the Rocky Road re-creation; mini chocolate cakes topped with homemade ice-cream, tahitian vanilla marshmallows, candied peanuts  and chocolate sauce.
