Being the sister restaurant to Spruce, I had very high expectations for the food, and they were completely met.  The two story cocktail bar on the corner is a loud and dark venue with loud music, but it is a fun atmosphere.  Reservations are likely a necessity, and I would never try to come in without them.\n\nThe staff is very helpful and attentive.  While a bit slow to take orders, I think that there was an initial deluge and every other need was quickly met.\n\nThe venue is elegant but casual.  Because of the dark nature of the place, I didn't feel like a loser in my jeans and sweater, but I also would have been quite comfortable in a dress for a night out on the town.  Expect bistro towel napkins, lacquered tables and Edison lights - ubiquitous but it works.\n\nThe drinks are excellent and meet every flavor profile.  Each of us had a drink that we loved, even though we did not necessarily love each other's.  I had the Sibling Rivalry ($15), which was made with Rye, Canton Ginger, St. Germain, Regan's & Peychaud Bitters.  It was a perfectly executed, smooth and toasty drink that made my own day of dealing with sibling rivalry feel SO much better.\n\nSpeaking of sibling rivalry, there is no kids' menu but the place it not family prohibitive.  No crayons, but they were served just as well as the rest of us.  The LOs enjoyed having a Chicken Slider ($8 each) and splitting a order of the tomato braised kale ($10).  Both dishes were well prepared and used quality ingredients.\n\nDM and I split the Branzino a la Plancha ($28), which was ridiculously good.  The perfectly cooked and fresh fish had crisp skin and was alongside black forbidden rice and this sweet and roasted Puttanesca sauce that had just the right amount of salt.  We also shared the roasted green beans ($10), which were sweet and crunchy haricots vert tossed in a sweet chili glaze and topped with chopped peanuts.  These were very good, but the Hen of the Woods Mushrooms ($11) were OUT OF THIS WORLD! 6-8 crunchy fried and woodsy mushrooms were practically meaty and were pushed over the top with a tangy and creamy lemon aioli.  I wanted to order some for dessert but thought that might be pushing my belly over the top.\n\nThe prices are pretty average for San Francisco - expensive for the rest of the world - but the food and cocktail program shines in a city known for excellence in both.  I would definitely come again.", "author": "Stephanie B."}

That I would agree with, the burger was really good and they cut it in half for us knowing we wanted to share everything. Was a very nice touch. \n\nMUST GET: Burger. If you don't like very strong cheeses, i'd recommend that you ask if you can change the one they usually put on there or just take it out.\n\nDON'T GET: Billionare's bacon unless you have 4 or more people to share it with. It's very thick and very fatty. The first bite was awesome with an explosion of fattiness but the 2nd and 3rd just became too oily and fatty that I felt gross after. French Toast was disappointing. It's a huge portion and was really mushy and not crispy on the edges either. The syrup they made was too strong in bourbon. \n\nI've heard great things about their dinner so maybe i'll come back to try that and see if its better!", "author": "Rohenne L."}

I had been meaning to come here for dinner or cocktails, but they were the only ones open near an event we were heading to. It seemed like there was only one server and one bartender to take care of the five to six tables and parties at the bar, yet they still managed to be attentive - even apologetic for a slight wait. They gave us a sort of alcoholic amuse bouche that tasted like sparkling wine to tide us over as we waited for our actual drinks. I was impressed with the presentation of my drink with a perfect egg white foam, but sadly the flavors didn't quite work with gin, watermelon, and something extremely sour.\n\nThe brunch menu is limited, but well-executed. Simple parts like the English green peas with the benedict or the sauce on the cheeseburger were impressive on their own. It is pricey for the short list of dishes, though. The restaurant and bar areas are nice both upstairs and downstairs, and the bathroom is one of the nicest I have been in.", "author": "Cat N."}

Ambiance is ok, but since we didn't have reservations, we sat at the smaller tables on the 2nd floor (too low for the chairs provided!). Service was so-so, ambiance is kinda whatever in my opinion. We shared several bites, the mexican street corn (eh), the fried green tomatoes (too much batter), and the crispy hen of the woods (batter was too similar to the fried green tomatoes) and the mushrooms were way thick, would have preferred smaller slices.

There's a downstairs area as well as their main area, and when I arrived at 6pm on Friday, most of the spots at the bar were full but there were still tables empty. The dimness, heavy chairs, and attire of the waiters makes the place seem swanky and luxurious.\n\nI'm surprised not many people have tried the Boothby Bowls at this place (or written about them), but the $100 price tag is a bit off-putting. The four of us decided to chance it anyway, considering all cocktails are $14 anyway, and ordered the Jalisco Spa Treatment. It arrived in a huge vase with a spigot, a thing of beauty. It also tasted so delicious and refreshing - I would gladly get drunk every day of my life if it meant I could drink this stuff instead of Kirkland vodka. The best part was that each of us got a good 5 glasses out of the bowl, so you can definitely try this with a bigger group if it seems expensive! \n\nFor food, we ordered a number of small bites, including the soft pretzel, 'Toga Tots, hen-of-the-woods mushrooms, asparagus salad, and shoestring fries. Everything was so good! The cheese dip that came with the soft pretzel wasn't super thick and had this delicious, deep flavor. The tots were my favorite, with the saltiness of chorizo and a satisfying crunchy outer layer. I also really enjoyed the asparagus salad, which had a creamy but light dressing and a nice crispness. The only thing I thought wasn't that great were the fries because they weren't super hot when we got them, but they were great for filling us up.\n\nOur waitress was just the right amount of attentive, and the check came to around $50 per person.", "author": "Sophie W."}

The chicken pate was most excellent, with a perfect mix of sweet and savory with the saltiness of the pate and the sweetness of the stewed strawberries. The toast and the walnuts give the dish a nice contrast in textures. I wasn't too into the pretzels, though my it wasn't soft enough and the cheese dip was pretty average. The tater tots were great, too. There's basically cheese whiz and bacon bits on top. \n\nFor entrees, we had the steak, the halibut, the burger and the hotdog. I went halfsies with my friend for the burger and hotdog and both were excellent. So juicy and flavorful and the buns were nicely soft to soak up the deliciousness. The hotdog also had thinly sliced roast pork. The table also shared the fries (claimed to be shoestring fries but they're just regular fries and aight, nothing to write home about) and the Mexican Street corn. I didn't really tried the corn but my friend liked it. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the scotch pudding and the funnel cake. Incidentally, the pudding is a perfect dip for the funnel cake because the two dips that came with the funnel cake wasn't great. The chartreuse sugar dip was disgusting, gross gross cough syrup and neon green/blue. The chocolate sauce was just ok. We all ended up just smearing the scotch pudding all over the funnel cake and it was great. \n\nI don't even remember what drinks the group ordered, but it was a lot. I am pregnant so only had a a virgin drink, some sort of lemony and tarragon concoction that was a bit too tart and not all that complex. My friend had their famous burning pineapple drink and she liked it. Most of their drinks were pretty boozy and the gentlemen also sampled a few of the offerings on the whiskey menu. \n\nWe are upstairs but went downstairs to check out their lovely bar. I actually wish we were seated downstairs because it was quieter. The service was great, too, people came by to pour water a few times and we never wanted for anything.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-30", "description": "I thought this place was great from the jump. Classy, chic, and somewhat mysterious on the outside, it can easily be overlooked. But don't let yourself make that mistake. Walking in, you see a beautifully decorated bar that has all the accoutrement one could possibly need OR want in their dining experience. (They even ordered a shaker for one of their gin drinks, which delivers the most beautiful, fluffiest, DELICIOUS shaken, Gin Ramos Fizz's I have ever seen.)\n\nEach time I have gone there, it's been nothing but a delightful experience. First, for dinner in the downstairs seating area - somewhat recluse and perfectly romantic. Having been in the service industry myself for 15+ years, I'm picky. And nothing was amiss. Luckily, we've been acquainted with the manager here, Mandy, and she literally runs around making sure everything is perfect. Her attention to detail, her culinary creations behind the scenes are not to be left unnoticed. This place no doubt owes a lot of its smooth-running success to her. And we couldn't be more grateful :)\n\nWe've also gathered for drinks and late night snacks (more specifically, the harissa fries with a yummy yogurt dipping sauce. It's a late night go-to, and the bowl is big enough for 3. Maybe even more) in the lounge area, and keep coming back for more. Til date, I have been there more times than I can count, and it's worth it every time.\n\nWhat you can't miss? BRUNCH. And little known tip? They're open for Saturdays too! Less busy, not as much of a wait, and still just as mouthwatering-ly delicious. (I'm not exaggerating, you guys. Go see for yourself.) \n\nWHAT WE ORDERED (I'm going to include both brunches here, so don't think I'm a fatass and ordered this all at once) :\n\nTHE JENGA TOTS: it's a feast for your eyes AND your stomach. It's a MUST if you're dining here for the first time. The presentation is beyond beautiful, and will capture diner's eyes from all over the room. You wouldn't think the taste could compete with the visual appeal, but alas. It more than delivers. \n\n\nTHE FRENCH TOAST: THE BEST FT I HAVE EVER HAD (I am not lying. They accidentally brought it out with the bacon crumble ontop, but instead of returning it - we just got another one so we didn't have to share. One w/ bacon for him - one without for me.)\n\nTHE EGGS BENEDICT (substituted ham for salmon): So delicious w/ the pretzel bun, but I feel like I would've still been hungry if I didn't order something else. So go to town and order all your heart desires!!\n\n\nDRINKS: \nBLOODY MARY w/ JALAPENO POPPERS: Mmmmm POP! Nothing like a drink that comes w/ snacks!\n\n**THE STRAWBERRY-RHUBARB GIN RAMOS** (probably my favorite drink I've had ALL YEAR.) The shaker machine is used here, and it tastes like the lightest milkshake/cocktail/fruity but NOT too sweet drink. Perfection in a glass. Can't wait to have more!!\n\nTHE PINK LADY: My boyfriend loved it, but I was too caught up with my Gin Fizz to steal too many sips. Can't go wrong.\n\nTHE ROOT & VERDE BLOODY MARY'S: not my favorite, I felt they were a bit sweet, but again - the boyfriend loved it, so nothing went to waste here.\n\nPROSECCO: seems basic, but delightfully light and refreshing. Would 100% order again.\n\n\nOk, I've rambled on for a bit - but you get the idea. Go to Saratoga, order all the things. And have Nikki, Alan, or Jeff make you some of the best cocktails you've ever had. The END.", "author": "Tiba G."}

We were scraping it off the tots just so avoid it, and I think I'm good off cream cheese for the rest of the year lol. The mimosa donut was good, but don't be fooled, it did not taste or vaguely taste like a mimosa at all.

In our journey to try all milk punches in the city, I'd rate this above The Kabuki Bar but below Eight Tables (which has thai milk tea punch for the best $22 you'll ever spend on a single cocktail). \n\nPricing: pretty expensive for what they're serving, but it's SF so I guess it's fine?

The carrot salad definitely had a Far East flavor profile, hints of cumin and maybe allspice, balances with Greek yogurt drizzle. Very tasty and refreshing to balance out the tots (which are more like hush puppies). I wasn't blown away by them honestly, but they were pretty good with some chopped bacon, chives and an aioli. \n\nThe short rib for the main was phenomenal! Served on a bed of creamy polenta (or grits, are they one in the same?) with some arugula to cut through the heaviness. The short rib was perfectly cooked, crispy outside with a tender and juicy inside). I do think that another acid could have been added to cut through the fat, perhaps pickled onions or something. I asked for a side of hot sauce to get some heat in there (and their hot sauce was amazing, sort of a chicory smoked bbq sauce). \n\nWe asked for some pork rolls on the side which were puffy, warm, salty and fabulous; but I didn't care much for the pimento spread it was served with. I think it could've benefited from an herb infused butter instead like rosemary or basil. \n\nDessert was delicious and super heavy, not for the faint hearted. Chocolate ho ho with a crisped marshmallow spread base! The chocolate cake was moist with great fudge-y consistency. Drinks were very strong, and very expensive (2 totaled to more than the meal). Folks next to use ordered the burger, octopus and chicken escalope, and all said they were prepared perfectly and tasted sensational (pics included). \n\nThe atmosphere of the place is great.

It was very delicious, with three pieces of fish accompanied by mushrooms, apples, and delicious sauce.  Overall very good.\n\nSecond course was a choice of Toga Tots or a Carrot Salad.  Now I'm a tater tots gal, but am trying to get more vegetables in the mix these days.  Therefore, the hubby and I ordered one of each.  The Tots were AMAZING.  More like fried potato cubes with delicious sauce on top.  Small portion but the perfect amount if you don't want to be bogged down by fried foods.  The carrot salad was also AMAZING.  I actually hate carrots generally, but these were deliciously seasoned and grilled with avocado and a yogurt sauce.  Honestly I could have eaten a massive plate of those carrots.\n\nLast savoury course was a generous short rib on top of grits in a delicious dark sauce.  It was perfectly cooked - moist and fatty - and was a great short rib.  I do wish the sauce was slightly sweeter, but overall was great.

First off the staff is very professional and friendly and know what they are talking about and secondly, gonna get right into it the \"BEST BILLIONAIRE BACON\" so juicy, yummy and scrumptious. Definitely a MUST TRY.\n\nMe and a friend went here for brunch and had a great time, we walked in without a reservation and still no wait time which was really nice! Really nice decor and ambience, the tables/seating is a little too close to each other so we could hear the neighbors and I'm sure they heard us too.\n\nWe got the sandwich of the day which is a cubano hot dog with egg, I don't really like cubano but it was our fault since our waitress asked us if we wanted to know the ingredients or just surprise us, we chose the latter so I'm not gonna hold them to it. Also got the flautas, which was alright, could use a little more spicy sauce/ flavor. We also got the donut, forget the name but it was yummy, but not the super soft dont if thats what you are looking for.\n\nWe also got the vieux carre, which was one of the best I have had so far. They have a huge wine list, didn't get to try it but definitely will next time. So definitely want to go back for the dinner time and try the food and drinks here. It is a little expensive but we were mentally prepared so all in all a good time.", "author": "Darshana S."}

Though it was really good it was a little too fatty for me to fully enjoy. I would not order again. \n\nLast but certainly not least, the Ho Hos dessert was one of the best desserts I have ever had. A gourmet take on a Ho Ho that has hints of s'more flavors with a rich chocolate outer layer. If I hadn't already been so full from ordering seconds of the carrot salad believe me I would've ordered seconds of this! \n\nMake sure you reserve or ask for a seat downstairs. The acoustics of the main floor / upper floor provides for a very loud, unconversational experience. We asked to be moved downstairs and it was worlds better. \n\nI did not get a chance to dip into the wide array of spirits they gorgeously display but I'll be sure to be back to try their infamous cocktails (and to of course, order more hamachi crudo, carrot salad and ho hos)!", "author": "Rachel P."}

It was light and refreshing but I wanted it to be a little bit less sour and more sweet.\n\nI also ordered the Gin highball ($14), which is honeydew, tarragon, lemon, tonic. I'm a sucker for anything fruit flavored, and honeydew is one of my favorites, so I really enjoyed this drink. This was probably my favorite drink from all the drinks we tried here.\n\nMy friend ordered the Japanese blended highball ($14), which is yuzu, mint, and soda. I took a test sip, and the yuzu flavor wasn't as strong as I expected. Given that we were both excited about this drink because of the yuzu element, it was a bit of a letdown.\n\nWe had already eaten previously so we just grabbed some harissa spiced shoe string fries ($8) to munch on with our drinks. This was surprisingly tasty, and we ended up finishing most of the fries by the end of our time here.\n\nI like that it was pretty spacious here; there was an upstairs bar/dining area as well as an additional bar area downstairs. \n\nI enjoyed my experience here but don't think the drinks were compelling enough to to make me want to come back, at least not until I've tried some of the other bars around the city.", "author": "Dianna H."}

The ambiance is very classy..it's a mix of a nice bar and sit-down dinner area split between upstairs and downstairs. The space isn't too big, but our happy hour group was about 20-30 of us and we held cozily mixed between both floors.\n\nWe stuck around the bar, and the bartender was helpful in recommending drinks for us. Even when it got pretty busy the bartender somehow was always able to help us out and take our orders. There's a great variety of highballs, barreled & bottled, stirred, and shaken. They also have an extensive menu for different types of bourbons, whiskeys, gins, reds, whites, you name it. I can imagine for those who love trying diff types of bourbons would love to visit here. Being an old-fashioned bourbon fan, the bartender recommended I try something a little different, and suggested the Brooklyn. It was Bourbon, Dry Vermouth, Amer Picon, and Maraschino. All I can say was that it was delicious! Apparently the green goblin is popular as well, so my friend ordered that which has Botanical Vodka, Green Chartreuse, Maurin Quina, Lime, and Basil. I personally wasn't a fan of it, but maybe it's because I just really enjoy bourbon. Another friend ordered gin which has Honeydew, Tarragon, Lemon, and Tonic. That was also okay, but I wanted want to order that myself. All that to say, there are a ton of different drinks to try, so pace yourself and have fun.

The table next to us got that honor. \n\nThey utilized the space very well, with a bar and table service upstairs and a lounge-like area, smaller bar and more tables downstairs. Lighting is cozy and the interior design is mesmerizing. \n\nSome of the food were better than others. Drinks were quite off. \n\nConfused why there were inedible limes placed with our mussels when their juice could have been added in the kitchen with a good squeeze and they were hidden underneath the mussels so adding nothing to the visual plating. Wondering if it's to give the illusion of more volumne in the dish. The meat inside the mussels were also not impressive. Small with some missing entirely, but soup had good flavor and good for dipping bread.\n\nThe tater tots were quite different, with the potato were mashed and then set in cubes. Inside is thick, meaty potato and outside is a crispy exterior. Uniquely delicious. \n\nThe burger came with a lot of meat. The pickles were removed because they didn't taste as good and almost took away from what was otherwise a well seasoned dish. The bread was light with a pinch of sweet for the perfect added flavor.\n\nThe drinks were a big miss. The martini tasted \"weird\" and almost as if water had been added. Perhaps the ice had melted a bit too much in the cooler? The sibling rivalry was recommended as being similar to an old fashion. Though not a bad drink, it does not resemble an old fashion. It's lighter and the presence of orange stronger. The wine (though not bad in taste) pouring was almost shameful. Lifted it up to make sure eyes weren't deceiving and there indeed was very little in the glass. Only the European nearby serves a similar shy pouring.

The bartenders were so knowledgeable and didn't mind walking us through their extensive selections and suggesting just the right fit for everyone in our group. \n\nWe were so pleased when the food turned out to be just as good (...better?) than the cocktails!   I loved that the menu seemed to take classic items and add fun quirky twists. We started with the tuna tartare on a fried black rice cake.  SO GOOD!  It kind of tasted like a fried sushi roll.  It was spicy and sweet and earthy but most importantly still tasted light and fresh.  I had the NY Strip for my main and OMG I'm now obsessed.  It comes topped with this creamy cognac peppercorn sauce that is truly to die for.  We ordered a side a fries just so we could mop up every last drop.  Will definitely be dreaming about that sauce for some time.\n\nA few days after we dined at The Saratoga we were reminiscing about our meal, and while the food and drinks were on par with so many other popular restaurants in SF the one thing we all really agreed stood out the most was the hospitality.  From the minute we walked into the building we felt the warm welcoming nature of this place.  The manager even came and checked in on our table, cracked some hilarious jokes, and made us feel special. \n\nThey really have a great team over there and that is what will keep us going back!", "author": "Mimi V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-14", "description": "The doorman, Frederick was kind enough to chat with me (super nice guy) while I waited for my friend to arrive. If you want to impress your date, he suggested ordering \"The Walking Dead\" cocktail for that \"wow\" factor. \n\nMy friend ordered it and our server lit it tableside but the flame quickly went kaput. She tried lighting it again, and kaput! \n\nBummer....it was like a whiskey d*ck.\n\nIf you're coming to The Saratoga for a hawt date, make sure your equipment doesn't go kaput later that night ok? Which means don't go overboard with the drinks at The Saratoga because trust me, you will want to! \n\nFrom the owners of Michelin starred Spruce and The Village Pub (Woodside), The Saratoga is beautiful two-story restaurant and bar serving elevated comfort food with a huuuugggge booze list (opened 11/10). If you like whiskeys and rare spirits, this is THE place to go to. I was told they have over 300 whiskeys and there's even a $1,500 shot.\n\nThe cocktails are the highlight of The Satatoga. I had the Highball Gin w/ honeydew, tarragon, lemon, tonic ($12): http://bit.ly/2eT5Crn and the Green Goblin: Botanical vodka, green chartreuse, maurin quina, lime, basil ($13): http://bit.ly/2gaHo0I. Both were equally good and well-balanced; the Highball was refreshing while the Green Goblin was more potent. \n\nAs a fernet lover, I was happy to see five rare ones on the list including one from 1950. \n\n\"Where are you ever going to see this Fernet on the menu again?\", my friend said. \n\nUmm, never. \n\nI caved and ordered a shot at $32 an ounce: http://bit.ly/2fr8K1w. Fernet is a digestive and tastes medicinal (think Chinese herbal drink your mom use to make you drink x 10) and this one was x 100...really smooth and aged. TMI, but I was bloated from the food, and this was like Gas X in a glass (also works like Pepto if needed). \n\nSolid cocktails aside, my friend and I both agreed that the food needs some work, as well as, the pacing of the courses (we didn't even dig into our salad when our mains arrived). Grand opening kinks are inevitable so I'm sure they'll work it out soon. \n\n*'Toga Tots w/ fiscalini cheddar, chorizo, scallion ($8): 3.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/2f9721E:\nWhile they were nicely crunchy, they were barely warm and we couldn't taste any of the chorizo. The cheese and sauce could have been more evenly distributed.\n\n*Chicken Liver Toast w/ honeycrisp apple butter, endive, walnuts ($9): 3.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/2g7FTBv.\nDeliciously creamy and the bread was nice and crusty. Personally, could have done without all the endive.\n\n*Baby Kale, Quinoa, and Persimmon Salad w/ crispy bacon, egg, gorgonzola dolce ($13): 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/2exSTyW\nOur fav dish of the night - greens were fresh and perfectly dressed with a nice salty crunch from the bacon and blanket of creaminess from the perfectly poached egg. \n\n*Cubano Frank w/ slow-roasted pork, yellow mustard, mojo relish ($15): 3.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/2fPSAvx\nThe soft buttery toasted bread and the deep fried hot dog was good but the mustard was overwhelming. Also, the swiss overpowered the pork so we couldn't taste it. No sides included. \n\n*Burger w/ taleggio cheese, slaw, onion bun ($15): My friend ordered the burger which had two thin patties that were cooked to a perfect medium but the copious amount of coleslaw was very salty. No sides included.\n\n*Cracker Jacks: Caramel popcorn, peanuts, maldon salt ($7): 2 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/2eTcLYB\nIt was nostalgic to find a prize inside but we didn't like the popcorn. The caramel was not evenly distributed and some clusters were really salty.\n\n*Fried Apple Hand Pie w/ cream cheese frosting ($9): 3 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/2fNpwpz \nIt was just ok. We expected a flakier crust and the cream cheese frosting was too hard to even spread. A glaze dip would be better. \n\nFor having just opened, the FOH staff was definitely on their A-game. Loved our server - she was super friendly, genuine, and attentive without being intrusive. I forgot to get her name but she also works at The Battery. As I was looking for the restroom, a guy (manager?) personally led me to the restroom downstairs. Nice touch. And, of course the doorman - super cool cat, he greeted every single customer who walked through the door with a welcoming smile. \n\nThe Saratoga is going to be the hottest date place in town with its vintage glam vibe, gorgeous illuminated bar (there's two), and floor-to-ceiling chandelier. Even though the downstairs dining area is more formal (white linen clothed tables), it felt a bit claustrophobic so I preferred dining upstairs. It's equally loud both upstairs and downstairs so if you're looking for a quiet, romantic place for dinner, you may want to look elsewhere. \n\nAs for parking...good luck. Take an Uber or Lyft here.  \n\nHighly recommend coming to The Saratoga for drinks. When I win the lottery one day, $1,500 shots at The Saratoga for everyone!\n\nP.S. - This is an unbiased review as we paid for our meal.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

It looked so amazing in the pictures! The Saratoga is also from the same owners as Spruce, another wonderful restaurant with spot on burgers. \n\nOn Thursday, we checked for reservations on Sat. None were available online, but when we called, a 7:15pm reso popped up for them! Score! \n\nDrinks:\nThe two had I had were amazing - The Walking Dead (Rum, Lemon, Papaya, Pineapple, Pomegranate, Tiki Bitters), and Green Goblin (Botanical Vodka, Green Chartreuse, Maurin Quina, Lime, Basil). Each cocktail is $14, which I guess is higher than going rate, but the amount of alcohol was perfect. Loved it. Very beautifully crafted drinks - see my pic. For the Walking Dead, they poured rum on the pineapple, and lit it on fire. It was sweet, caramelized, and so good. \n\nFood:\n-YOU MUST GET THE WARM TOMATO DIP!!!! I was expecting something like a warm hummus type thing, but NO. It was a tomato that tasted braised with lots of olive oil, butter, and garlic. Apparently it's some Piedmont, Italy tradition. You dip the wonderful tomato mixture on top of the bread - simply amazing.\n-Toga Tots - these tasted like sophisticated carne asada fries! The tater tots are cubed, which is a fun play on food, with cheddar, chorizo, and scallions to top. It definitely tasted like a grown-up version of carne asada fries. If you're into that type of dish, like my bf is, then this is a must.\n-Burger - Pretty good, but I'd say that their sibling's Spruce is better. Saratoga's burger felt like it was missing tomato, grilled onions, etc. But the meat was perfect, as well as the cheese. I also liked the shredded lettuce & mayo mixture! There are no add-ons, like Spruce. But also, the restaurant as a whole is trying to achieve something different. This is a bar atmosphere, not a michelin-star neighborhood-gem restaurant. \n-Harissa-spiced Fries - big enough portion to share among 2 people if you're both getting the burger. They were crispy shoestring fries, with seasoning on top. It came with a cucumber lime dip, but just get the ketchup, because it tastes damn good even with the fries seasoned.\n\nAmbiance: \n-The bar is so beautiful, and your eyes can't stay off of it when you enter the restaurant. It has really cool backlighting, so the lights illuminate the drinks, very cool. It was kind of similar to Black Cat (bar in the same area) in a way, with a trendy feel and black furniture/paint. \n\nService:\n-Excellent. Food came out very quickly, service was attentive, and personable. The bartender who made our drinks came from Spruce, so you know they are well-trained!\n\nI would definitely come back to this restaurant. I think the burger is worth trying, but now that I've had it, the other entrees looked amazing, and I need to try other drinks too. Can't wait!", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

The burger came out salty so they had to redo, the cheese on it is also very overpowering, it's also served by itself so you have to order a side of fries or whatever and it seems overpriced.

(get your phone ready you IGers and Snapchatters)  I will say it was a bit strong tasting for my taste -- it was hard to drink. (but pretty? lol)  Oh -- FYI their drinks are expensive, mostly around like $15.  \n\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table:  We got the \"Toga Tots\" which were a big hit with our group -- everyone liked them.  The \"Spicy Pork Belly Bun,\" which was alright.  My personal favorite was the \"Chicken Liver Toast\" -- this has apples and almonds, and oh my gosh, yum -- so good!  \n\nFor my entree I got the \"Grilled New Caledonian Blue Prawns,\" which FYI still has the head attached (if you're a 5 year old like me, this is valuable info).

We finally had to flag down a passing busser to ask for our server. He arrived shortly after and coldly took our drink order without saying hello or telling us the specials or offering water. He lacked experience and clearly wasn't equipped to be a server. It was fly-by order and go. Drinks took another 15 minutes to arrive - mind you this place has two bars and it wasn't that busy. Needless to say the rest of the night was as predictable as the first 30 minutes. We had to order more sparkling water throughout the evening since our server didn't seem to notice anything on the table. We had initially asked to have our dinner paced out but soon realized it was a bad idea bc of the slow, inattentive service. Food was dropped off all at once and left. It was such horrible service. Our bill was $600 for 4 ppl so it wasn't like we weren't eating. The food was fine - not extraordinary while the service was atrocious. Our busser was the only redeeming aspect of the evening.

Though the latter might be my fault for going at 10:30 on a Saturday night.  \n\nFirst, they deserve major props for their stellar fernet selection.  Top shelf fernet?  $32 a shot.  That's top shelf fernet.  I also couldn't help noticing the ample supply of chartreuse.  So SF old school.  If money is no object, they have a green chartreuse from the 30's that goes for $440 bucks an ounce.  Maybe someday I'll find out how it tastes.\n\nUpstairs vs. downstairs...\n\nThe first level, or rather, the level that the entrance is on, is actually the upstairs.  It really sparkles w the ultra shiny, full bar display.  And w the gorgeous light fixture, it's a vision, even from the outside, thanks to the floor to ceiling windows.  It's peppered w several small tables, in addition to the bar seating.  This is the floor to be on if you want to see & be seen.\n\nI preferred the downstairs.  There's another full bar, but it's smaller, & way more intimate.  More tables & bar seating. If you really want privacy while still being able to witness the action, try to score the cozy corner to the left when you reach the bottom of the stairs, all the way to the back (against the back wall & ideal for 2 people, no more than 4).  It's like a miniature living room.  Alternatively, there are larger tables on the other side of the staircase, which you will pass on the way to the restrooms.  While the rest of the joint was packed & noisy, those tables somehow remained quiet & out of the way.\n\nI had just come from dinner, so I didn't try the food yet.  But when I have a 20 dollar glass of Pinot Noir that I think was actually worth 20 dollars (Deovlet, Santa Barbara, 2014), I'm happy.\n\nNice joint, for sure.  Swanky & cool.

Kinda feels like I walked into a tech startup's sales team's holiday party (If you work in that industry, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about). I never thought I would feel underdressed anywhere around that neighborhood.\n\nIn any case, you can consider the food here to also be a fancy rendition of bar food. The burger is superb, with lot of juicy meat flavor and a perfectly toasted, charred bun. The other dishes such as their giant cubes of tater tots with tons of fixins on it (reminiscent of Trick Dog's manimal fries) are also pretty solid. Definitely enjoyed that scotch pudding dessert as well.\n\nWe had some of the cocktails out of the shaken/stirred section, and that's probably where this place felt a bit short.

Wouldn't recommend it.\n- Warm tomato dip: good, interesting flavors ... definitely surprised me.\n- Heirloom squash: i liked the texture, but the flavor profile was average.\n- Octopus: good dish, albeit, on the small side.\n- Crab sandwich: this was a special for the day and was definitely my favorite dish of the night.\n- Pork chops: other in the group liked it a lot; i thought it was just ok.\n- Brussel sprouts: below average.\n\nNot a bad experience ... just expected more.", "author": "Ankur V."}

The restaurant consists of two floors, a ground level and a basement. The basement has a very clubby feel to it with white tablecloths and nice art  on the walls. The concept is very alcohol-centric: The first floor sports a  huge backbar with an amazing assortment alcohol.  The food is good but the crowd was mostly 30ish corporatist posers.  \n\n   One of our group was clearly disabled and having a hard time walking with a cane. (We had showed up on time for our 9pm reservation and we had now been waiting/standing  25 minutes for our past-due table.) When we plopped our friend down on an empty bar stool we were told curtly that  \"all our bar stools are reserved\". I explained that my friend  was having a problem standing, needed to sit down , and I wanted to speak to her manager.  After a few moments Mr. Manager showed up and said my friend  would have to move. I was over their attitude by this point & said \"Sir, you are a public accommodation and I demand reasonable accommodation for my friend under the American's with Disabilities Act. There is no where for him to move to, our table is 30 minutes  late, so you call your owner, and let him know he has a big problem on his hands.....\" \n\nMr. Manager look startled, but did find us a table in about 2 minutes.

First visited The Saratoga a couple of weeks ago sitting at the downstairs bar and truly enjoyed the cocktails, shared plates we had and the exceptional bar tender Larissa. We visited again last night, NYE, with a party of 5 and reserved a table upstairs. Was so happy to see that Larissa was making drinks at the upstairs bar and she did not disappoint with all of our parties cocktails. We are especially fond of the \"Sibling Rivalry\". Everything about our evening at The Saratoga was exceptional. Our wait staff was amazing! Our waiter Michele was wonderful; friendly, knowledgable of all the dishes and extremely efficient at making our time pleasurable. All of the dishes we ordered were exceptional and cooked to perfection we ordered the seared scallops, chicken paillard, NY steak in peppercorn sauce, a kale salad, sauteed kale and tater tots with chorizo. The deserts are wonderful as well as we ordered the Ho-Ho and the Scotchy Scotch Pudding which is off the hook! The atmosphere is upscale and lively and not annoyingly loud which makes dinner more pleasurably. They are also very cognizant and as accommodating as possible with dietary restrictions and food allergies. One of our party is vegetarian and one of our party has a peanut allergy. Michele was great in showing our vegetarian friend what dishes were great for her and he also had an order of the tater tots prepared without the chorizo. He was also great in letting our guest with the peanut allergy know that the tots were cooked in peanut oil and letting her know what dishes were safe for her.\n\nI should also add that the spirits menu is unbelievable with something like 600 different spirits to chose from. We counted 169 different bourbons alone and if sipping an 80 year old chartreuse is your thing, they have that.\n\nExceptional cuisine, cocktails, spirit selection, staff and ambiance earns The Saratoga 5 stars easily.", "author": "Steven B."}

Everything was free! Luckily, she decided to invite me! She made a reservation for two a couple days prior for Saturday, November 5th at 6:45pm. (Prices below were what was listed on the menus we received.)\n\n*'Toga Tots: fiscalini cheddar, chorizo, scallion ($8)\n*Spicy Pork Belly Bun: carolina gold bbq sauce ($7)\n*Chicken Liver Toasts: honeycrisp apple butter, endive, walnuts ($9)\n*Baby Kale, Quinoa, and Persimmon Salad: crispy bacon, egg, gorgonzola dolce ($13)\n*New Caledonian Blue Prawns Baked in Rock Salt: shaved escarole, garlic-chili vinaigrette ($18)\n*The Saratoga Burger: taleggio cheese, slaw, onion bun ($15)\n*Flannery's Dry Aged New York Steak: smothered in cognac-peppercorn sauce ($28)\n*Fried Apple Hand Pie: cream cheese frosting ($9)\n*Scotchy Scotch Scotch Pudding: black label scotch caramel ($9)\n\nWe actually didn't order the prawns, but I'm glad they served them! I adore head on prawns, so this ended up being one on my favorite dishes. The liver toast was great as well. Creamy and flavorful. Everyone knows I love greens, so I had to get a salad. The soft boiled egg made it that much richer and delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly, but the sauce was a touch too salty. The burger was moist and tender. I loved the slaw on it. Had a great pickle/relish flavor. The tots were our first dish. I liked the ingredients, but I wished they were crispier. The insides were also a little mushy. My least favorite dish was the pork buns. Sounded great on the menu, but they were basically small bbq pork buns. More bread than meat which I didn't enjoy. As for dessert, the scotch pudding was so good! I love scotch and I love caramel, so this was my kind of dessert. The apple pie was nice and crispy, though I didn't love the cream cheese frosting. I would have rather had something more comforting, like an ice cream.\n\n*Japanese Blended Highball: yuzu, mint, soda ($14)\n*Vieux Carre: rye/cognac/sweet vermouth/angostura & peychaud's bitters ($13) \u00d73\n*The Walking Dead: rum/lemon/papaya/pineapple/pomegranate/tiki bitters ($14) \u00d72\n\nOf course we had to have drinks! I asked the server what he recommended and he suggested the vieux carre. Great drink to start off the night. I liked it so much, I had two of them! My gf started with the highball. She didn't really like it that much, so she moved o to the vieux carre as well. For our next round, I asked the server what he suggested as a follow up and we decided on the walking dead. I'm normally not a fan of rum, but this was delicious! Pretty as it was served with a flame on the pineapple. It was fruity, but very balanced and boozy. And I normally don't like fruity cocktails. For dessert, our server recommend two glasses of Champagne. I didn't catch the kind, but it was nice and dry, which I prefer.\n\nService was excellent. Our server was sweet and attentive. Such a friendly guy. And the bar at The Saratoga is beautiful. Wish I could have such a pretty bar at home! They gave us our comped tab at the end of the night. Total with our one bottle of sparkling water and one bottle of still water was under $250. We ended up tipping him $50 before we left for the night.\n\nI'd say the food was more a 4, but the service was so good, I'm rounding this review up to 5 stars.", "author": "Elena N."}

Finally after standing there looking confused, I asked if I was supposed to stand or if I can be seated. Her response was, \"it's up to you\". I requested to sit, and as I was being shown to the table she tells me there is another reservation at 7:30 so we need to be finished by then. \n\nShe then tells everyone else in my party the same as we arrived. Our waitress then proceeds to tell us 2 more times that we have to be finished by 7:30. \n\nOur food takes 30 minutes to arrive, which by the way was mediocre and nowhere near deserving of the price.

So there was lots of excitement when we went on opening night. Did it live up to expectations? Yes. And that's both a good thing - and bad. \n\nThe Saratoga does everything you'd expect from a mid-high range restaurant/bar hybrid in SF. The retro-modern fixtures, the suited staff, the loud - let's be honest - terrible music, you've kinda seen it all before. And sure, it works. But is it groundbreaking or memorable? No. \n\nWe ordered five plates to share between two, ranging from apps like the deliciously salty toga tots, to the larger spice-encrusted chicken paillard. The fried apple pie dessert was a fun nod to the classic McDonald's apple pie - and I don't hate it. Drinks are tasty, but the pours are a little on the smaller side. \n\nAt $130 for two people, it'll probably be a while before we go back.

The wine and short beer list works too. We were here for a kinda splurge dinner drawn by the dry aged steak on the menu and interesting small plates. The tots were tasty as advertised. And while the tomato dip wasn't quite what we expected, the flavor absolutely worked. However a special shrimp taco had a mix of flavors but none of them was shrimp, just crunchy bits. And for me the steak was a complete disappointment. Ordered very rare it was barely rare. (They didn't check until about halfway through the course.) Plus it was smothered in the peppercorn sauce which somehow took away from any sear on the steak. It wasn't that tender either. May go back for a drink and a burger.", "author": "Sally S."}

Both times we sat at the bar on the ground floor.\n\nThe cocktails are lovely, but I was disappointed by the conspicuous dearth of libations including Chartreuse, considering the fact that the Saratoga is (apparently) focused on Chartreuse, owing to the crazy Chartreuse list and the prominently displayed wall o' chartreuse.  I happen to love the stuff, so I was very much looking forward to having an oyster of a cocktail list-world to choose from, but sadly there was only one.  So I ordered it, and it was GOOD, but, you know, choices are better.  I happen to like bourbon and chartreuse together, and the one cocktail with it was a vodka base.\n\nThe food.  Guys.  The food.  It's good.  OK. It's real good. Like super, really, extra, good.  The menu is somewhat unsuspecting.  It's maybe not the most eye-popping menu on its face.  But everything is simply scrumptious and perfectly executed.  Case in point: the tots.  So like, tots are having a moment right now and I guess \"totchos\" are the new hotness.  These are not that.  These are handmade shredded potato cubes, fried to perfection, super crispy outside, perfectly tender potatoey center.  Somehow the edges on those potato cubes are sharper than a drill Sergeant's hospital corners.  I don't know how they construct these tots, I only know they taste good.  The fixins they come with send them right over the top.  You gotta get these tots.  They're really more of a gorgeous potato croquette, if we're going for accuracy.\n\nAnywho!  There was a tomato dip, bagna cauda, thing which was AMAHZING.  Like, the most tomatoey thing I've ever eaten.  Like, tomato distilled to its most essential, that you can dip bread into.  I was into it.  I would have liked to actually bathe in this bagna cauda.\n\nThere were other things too, we over did it, big time, but it was worth it.  Go there. Eat the things, drink the drinks, you won't regret it. \n\nNext time I'll shoot for a spot downstairs as it was much quieter and more intimate.  There's another bar down there, too, FYI.", "author": "Rachel S."}

Their drink and food menus are expansive, where every option has you licking your chops. I ordered a couple of dishes off of their snack menu: the beef tartare, pork bun, and fish crudo. The tartare was exceptional: Asian flavors with homemade, salty kettle chips - the perfect textural and flavor contrasts. The pork bun was pretty good, a lot different than baked pork buns you get at a Chinese bakery in SF. The dough was crispy on top and thick on the bottom, but the flavors were awesome and the mustard based sauce on the side really made the dish. The crudo, on the other hand, I could have done without. Though pretty to look at, the fish was not cut thin enough. Overall, this was a good meal accompanied by a delicious cocktail that just makes you feel freakin fabulous. I will definitely be back.", "author": "Adriana G."}

Got there and basically we got told tables  are reserved and bar seats and corner seats are the only available ones. So I went to open table and what do I find? Open seats for two in 15mins. Odd right? Well yah I did made reservation hubby went to the hostess and said we have reservation well she told him that she was surprised that it allowed us to do that. Well maybe because when we look at that open table app it shows there were open reservations between 8pm-9pm which will be ample time that we will spend there. But then she needs to give us a table now because we have reservations. Waited for a little bit and while we wait we ordered some cocktails which is one of the reasons why I gave it one of the stars since drinks were tasty. Got on our tiny tiny table of course shoved in a corner server she was nice that's what the second star is for I was debating at first because our food came so late and cold plus she was more attentive to the table that was drinking heavily. Then we looked at a two page menu and 98% of the menu book consists of different kinds of cocktails and other alcoholic beverages. Ordered a snack and two main dishes first menu was really pathetic. Food ordered steak, hamburger and tater tots? Verdict it was Blah best thing we ate were the tater tots. That's why I didn't give it another star cause food sucked! Oh yah Did I mention it was my birthday? First time here and wanted to have a good experience since it had such a great review in yelp. Well, by the way we got treated when we first got there that should already be a sign not to push through and being treated that way on your special day that was a huge mistake I wouldn't want to spend anymore money on a place that treat you like shit! That's why sometimes it's good to stick to the great places you know and not take a risk and just have a very disappointing experience on your special day.

I applaud them for trying to be different, and it worked in a sense because it did make me order it.. but it was just too funky. And the potato chips it came with were so overly salty that it took away from the delicacy tartare is known for.

The bi-level venue is gorgeous and has an up-tempo vibe, great service, an active bar scene, and very good food.  The clientele is composed of swells, couples out on a date, groups partying at the bar, and even single diners like yours truly.  \n\nMy meal started with an appetizer of bagna-cauda poached tomato that came swimming in garlic cream and basil.  On the side was slices of grilled levain that one could either dip in the sauce or spread the tomato onto.  This was a lovely plate of food with just the astringency needed to liven the appetite.  Score one for The Saratoga.  \n\nNext up was the dry aged New York steak medium rare that came surmounted and surrounded by a cognac peppercorn sauce.  This huge chunk of perfectly cooked steak is of a suitable size for sharing by two or three guests.  Being alone I ate the entire steak and enjoyed every bite. \n\nTo accompany the steak, I ordered a second appetizer: the warm chantenay carrot salad with avocado, toasted seeds and vadouvan.  Here, I over ordered (my server let me know this) but what the hell it sounded like a great plate of food.  And I was correct.  The salad was superb.  \n\nIf you order as I did The Saratoga is not inexpensive but it is less so than Spruce.  If you are rational you can have a cocktail, a few of the smaller plates, an appetizer or two and get out inexpensively. \n\nIt would be appropriate to close by noting that the serving sizes here are quite generous.

I had read about the food, which seemed highly anticipated, but we came after dinner, so we were too full.\n\nI like the decor a lot - clean, classic but modern, interesting.  The display of the collection of rare bottles is nice with the back lit shelves and the library style ladder (I'm obsessed with getting one at home one day).\n\nDrinks: \n1. The avenue: bourbon based; it's hard to find a passionfruit cocktail that's not overly sweet, but theirs is actually just the right amount of tartness. I'm guessing they use a fruit puree instead of syrup because most other ones I have outside are way too syrupy\n2. Grand pendennis: gin based, with apricot brandy, bitters, lime. This is also on the tart side, not super sweet. I am not a huge gin fan, but it was a pretty good cocktail.. maybe a little strong on the bitters (in combination with the juniper from the gin)\n\nDrink prices are pretty reasonable.  Presentation was nice - my drink had a flower with a tiny clothespin to attach it to the side of the nick and nora glass, which was nice since the garnish usually falls in my face when I take a sip. Also, I love their glassware - I saw some of the cutest mini coup glasses (not sure for which drink). \n\nThe bartenders seemed experienced and calm/collected.

Not due to anything they did; I'd had a big lunch, was not super-hungry, and feeling a wee bit out of sorts, so did not want another big meal.\nI'd never had chartreuse, picked what looked like one of the milder drinks, with mint, pineapple, sprinkle of nutmeg. Less sweet than many liqueurs, more herbal. \nExplained to helpful waitress I was going to just get a couple of small plates. Started with chicken liver pate. I know this is not to everyone's taste but I liked it and Saratoga's version was good. Crusty bread spread with pate and apple butter, grating of endive and very fine threads of apple - can't imagine what kind of tool they use to get them? Nice contrast of tastes & textures. All three salad options looked good. With difficulty, decided on carrots. A very generous portion of warm roasted carrots with avocado (could have had a little more avocado), tons of seeds, yogurt. Really, the carrots and pate were a very satisfying meal. \nAsked helpful waitress if they had any herbal tea. They don't, but she said they could steep some fresh mint, something I frequently do at home with mint from my garden. Ordered the rolls to eat with the mint tea. I don't want to know how much butter is in that bread dough! Obviously with that much butter they tasted good, if unhealthy. Came with \"butter of the day\", I think with nutmeg. \nTried the ho-hos for dessert. That was the weak point. A nice concept, cute, generous portion but neither the cake nor the icing tasted especially chocolate-y. I liked the meringue. \nMight return for one of the other salads and an entree. This was post-ballet dinner and rest of season has dinners lined up, so next year.", "author": "Carol S."}

The Saratoga has a very extensive selection of cocktails and spirits, however they do come at quite a premium.

The real star of the evening, surprisingly enough, was the food, which was delicious and a bit more reasonably priced than the drinks. The rolls are a must-have, and between an order of those, a pair of apps (the fried chicken slider and toga tots), and a pair of lighter vegetable dishes (the tomato dip and kale salad), my partner and I were happily satisfied without feeling stuffed.

The volume of the music and the bass was accosting.  I am not sure if it is the building acoustics or the music volume or the combination of both, regardless, it makes dining very unenjoyable.

I probably won't be coming back for a while. \n\nI'll go into detail about my experience: \n\nThe servers were amazing, very knowledgeable, kind, and attentive. They even fold your napkin when you get up to go to the restroom (service I've only experienced at places like Gary Danko.)\n\nThe dinner rolls were so dry, much too salty, and the butter had olives in it which was okay for me but not mentioned by the server or on the menu. My partner does not like olives and we wouldn't have ordered this considering that detail which was omitted on the menu. \n\nThe poached tomato, although way too much to eat for one or two people, was delicious. It was so rich though. This needs to be mentioned as a dish for about 4 people to share if they don't want to be terribly full by the time other dishes come out. It also comes with about 6 pieces of bread which were wayyyyy over buttered, maybe the butter should be served on the side??? People like different amounts of butter! \n\nThe warm carrot salad had a dreamy flavor, really delicious. BUT---the carrots were basically raw! I expected them to be charred or a little roasted at least. Some were too hard to eat delicately or even cut with a knife. Disappointing. :/ \n\nI did not have the burger, but my partner did. She only ate half. So you can determine what her feelings were on that. \n\nOver all, wonderful service that would keep me as a loyal customer, but please improve your food quality!", "author": "Cherish P."}

Atmosphere: really awesome vibe, high ceilings, inspiring and impressive liqour bar/wall, well dressed waiters and hosts. \n\n2. Drinks: solid cocktails, ordered a few and although not quite as good as some of the places I have been in SF they were good and I am hoping they can refine their craft a bit here in the future.\n\n3. Food: only had a few small things, including the burger which was ok. I generally enjoyed the burger but it was overly dressed, and the bun became a bit soggy and it was hard to really taste the meat, my suggestion here would be to put less dressing on it so the bun doesn't go soggy and the meat quality can stand out more, maybe it was a one off? Maybe they are still figuring this one out? Also tried some bread with truffle butter and it was great, and a lot of things on the menu look great so will definitely come back to try some other things. Oh and the bourbon pudding was incredible, but very spirit forward.\n\nRight now it is a 4* for me, but I can see them getting a solid five if the food gets better in the future. \n\nAlso, this area at night is still a bit sketchy but probably safe so just keep that in mind if you aren't familiar with the area or uncomfortable in sketchy areas.", "author": "Brent F."}

Waiter was very nice and the cocktails were great. I got the Cubano frank and my wife got the NY steak. We also got an order of the fries which were great as well. Just a heads up the cubano frank is a hot dog. The reason for the other star lost was my cubano frank was only warm, it wasn't hot. So it felt cheap. Overall taste was good and atmosphere cool. According to the guy at the table next to me though if you are just now trying to learn how to Skateboard you are a poser and a loser who works at Facebook. WTF? Oh and SF is training wheels for LA. Huh?!?", "author": "Tommy C."}

I read the other reviews and was prepared to be really impressed, but was not. I was left utterly unimpressed. From the moment we walked in, I hated it. I was greeted with cheesy 90's R & B music in what looks like a bar. I had higher hopes as we made our way downstairs to the table, but same music and smaller room. In fact, there may be 15 tables total. We noticed as the night went on, this is the way to the bathroom. All throughout dinner, people were strolling by to get to the restroom - very poor planning as it seemed strange and as out of place as everything else. I was also unimpressed with our server, who seemed to fumble over her words and do strange things. For instance, left \u00bc inch of coffee in a carafe, so left the entire carafe on the table (there was plenty of room left in the cup). The coffee was HORRIBLE. We ordered the parker house rolls, which were served room temperature (not warm) with some type of gray goop. I asked and learned it was \"olive butter.\" Flavor wasn't great, regular butter would have been a huge improvement. I had a salad, which was decent except for the bones of the leaves all over my plate. Next came the chicken liver appetizer, which came on bread - 3 total. The entire plate was covered in what I think was endive or radicchio leaves. Very strange to look at, like camouflage. I ordered the steak with peppercorn sauce. It was decent but nothing great. Tough meat in my opinion, but the sauce was tasty. Also ordered were The Cubano, which was a hot dog, with pork on top, and cheese, a lot of cheese. I would not order it again. Next were the sides - potato cocotte, and wine cooked mushrooms. The potatoes were NOT a cocotte, but were merely fingerling potatoes that looked like they were thrown on a cookie sheet and baked. They came with a ramekin that looked empty, but upon inspection had about 10 flakes of rock salt, which I used to cover everything I was eating. The mushrooms were beyond sweet (again, more rock salt to try to balance it) and were barely eaten. We skipped dessert altogether, and got our food packed up and left it on top of the nearest garbage can outside. I didn't want dinner to be a complete waste. I would definitely NOT go back.", "author": "Kath v."}

I didn't get a chance to drink the many selections of scotch and bourbon they have. But, I plan to next time I'm there. The tater tots are a must. I also love they're fun style of desserts. Ho hos and Cracker Jacks, are you kidding?  Not only do they taste amazing, but, there are prizes in the Cracker Jack box. Every dish, except the poached tomato, was delicious.  The tomato was a little too acidic and the flavors of the tomato were too strong. But, the broth and toast were very tasty.  You must go to check out this place. Btw, I almost never write reviews. But, this one was worth it.  I only write reviews if I love a place or can't stand it.", "author": "David W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-01-14", "description": "The food is mediocre and relatively uninteresting, especially for the price. The best thing in the menu is the chicken sliders, everything else makes you nostalgic for your other favorite San Francisco restaurants. By far the worst thing about this place is the waiters, they're rude and unprofessional. Go there if you like to be manipulated.", "author": "Mohamad T."}

Beautiful new buildout, super friendly staff and the manager was great! Try the \"Walking Dead\" drink it comes on fire! The burger is to die for and the chicken slider was mouth watering juicy! #MyNewSpot", "author": "William B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-25", "description": "I went to Saratoga for my birthday with three friends to get a classy but fun dinner. We started at the bar to get drinks and had a few questions about the wine. The server was very helpful and offered us a tasting (incredibly generous). For dinner we received complementary garlic fries because of a slight delay in seating (which wasn't a problem because of the good bar area), which were very tasty and unique. We also got the chicken tenders and tater tots for appetizers. I will say that these dishes are incredibly unique--great balance of flavors and well presented. For dinner I got the flattened chicken and my friends got the burger. The flattened chicken had a light coat of herbs and spices and was cooked perfectly. The accompanying greens balanced the flavor of the chicken very well. The burgers were also delicious. The service was also great--the server checked on us multiple times and the chef came out to see how we enjoyed the meal. You can really appreciate the originality and creativity that went into the menu here. I will definitely be coming back.", "author": "Adam P."}

The flavors of the Spicy Pork Belly Buns were good but the dough was burnt on the bottom, hard on top, undercooked inside. The mushrooms were worse than anything you'd find at a strip mall deli -- simply raw button mushrooms in red wine. The steak ($32) was a nice piece of beef that was drowned in one of the saddest pepper sauces I've ever had. Not all the much pepper and it had a very strange texture/mouthfeel -- it managed to have both a greasy feel and taste like it had some sort of thickener like flour or hydrolyzed protein. The service was up and down, mostly down. There was a mix up with the reservation for our party of five but they did their best to accommodate us. Our wine choice took three tries to get right. The server blamed the noise level (i.e. he couldn't hear what I ordered), which was in the low 90 dBls according to my iPhone app. The first bottle of Kistler Chardonnay ($95) was properly chilled (maybe too chilled) the second was warm. The ambiance is OK, but this is much more a lounge than a restaurant. It is certainly not worth the $$$ for the quality of the food.", "author": "Tom M."}
