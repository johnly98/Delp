The restaurant was empty- so I'm assuming they were planning to close early until my group of 8 walked in lmao \n\nService was alright, they were pretty accommodating. \n\nWe ended up ordering an XL of the combo special and then a S afterwards since we weren't full just yet. The pizza was okay, nothing out of the ordinary. I like how the crust is thin and wasn't too overwhelming- bc you know how some pizza places make the crust hella thick and bread-like? \n\nThe only downside to thin crust is that all the toppings fell off as we tried to grab a slice lol \n\nGlad I got to try this place out but it's def not the first place I would go to for my pizza cravings...", "author": "Coco L."}

When we first moved to SF, we frequented the Village Pizzeria on Clement and Arguello, which is long gone. Now, the Van Ness location is all we have to remember what was great about this SF pizza joint.\n\nI review lots of pizza places, because I'm from Brooklyn where pizza is a religion. Don't get me into a discussion about DiFaro vs. Spumoni Gardens (look it up). Anyway, 30+ years in California has me constantly on the prowl for authentic NYC style 'Za, and I have to say my experience here is pretty good.\n\nThe smell is right when you enter the place, garlic and parmesean permeate the atmosphere, along with the gaminess of some of the street people who have scraped up enough for a slice to go. Most recently I was here with my teenage daughter, before seeing a movie at the AMC across the street. I opted for pepperoni, and she, the purist, went for cheese. I have to say we were both quite happy, as the slices were fresh out of the oven, the toppings were adequate without being messy, the slices were foldable, and the oil dripped at just the right rate to make it seem like home.\n\nIt is a bit more expensive than I remember from the 90s, but hey, what isn't?

Why do you ask???!! Mainly because I am a sucker for anything garlicy, cheesy, and just good as hell!\n\nI haven't had anything from here that was not good, well, the pizza is a tad bit on the greasy side, BUT, the pasta and calzone, my oh my.  Their Alfredo is super creamy with just the right amount of garlic goodness.  The regular size is almost $11, you can add chicken for about $4 more.  I usually opt for chicken-less because the portion itself isn't much.  You also get a roll on the side which is just perfect.  \n\nI believe it was the all meat calzone that I have tried and I absolutely LOVED IT!  I love how delicious they make their dough (bread) because it always taste fresh.  The portion of this bad boy is unbelievable.  Usually after half, I am beyond full.  On the inside they put some sort of garlic sauce inside.  If you aren't a fan of garlic, I would maybe ask them to cut back a little bit.  It would also be nice to see more meat inside.  Some areas, you get more bread than anything else.\n\nI think my only issue with this place is their customer service.  You almost hate to spend $$ with them because the guys behind the counter aren't very personable.  Last week when I asked to have my calzone cut in half, he actually made a really ugly face, as if I was asking too much of him.  At least if youre going to make shi*tty faces, make sure the customer can't see you, maybe?\n\nOn average, my co-worker and I don't spend anywhere between $25-$28 at this place and the attitude is definitely not necessary, ESPECIALLY when quite a few times our orders were not right! just sayin!", "author": "Sabrina J."}

I literally order about 20 minutes ago thru grubhub and the shift manager on Friday Feb 2nd at 9:20pm was the most aggressive and unreasonable person I think that I have encountered in my life.\n\nMy friend had ordered earlier in the night and when it had arrived we realized that we had miss ordered our pizza and also we had paid for some sauce sides that had not arrived. Acknowledging that we had ordered the wrong pizza I volunteered to re order under my grub hub account and to make sure we would receive the sauce we paid for. When I called to address this the employee that originally answered the phone passed the call to a manager which I was happy to do. When he answered the phone I could not  believe the customer service I would receive of lack there of.\n\nI explained that our previous order was not correct and I would like to make sure that our order that was coming would be and that I would like the sauce we had previously paid for would come with this order. He asked for my address which I gave but also explained that the previous order was under a different name and number. He kept repeating in an angry and aggressive fashion that there was no previous order and that I must have had the wrong pizzeria. I understood but since this is a chain pizzeria I hoped they might understand the situation and I asked that they might fulfill our request and was met with the most anger / aggression I think that I have experienced in my life. He basically said they would not fulfill my order at all even though I said all I was calling for was a conversation about sauce to which he hung up on me. I called back to which he answered the phone directly and called me by my name and he said \"DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?\" \"DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? I AM CANCELLING YOUR ORDER AND YOU CAN CALL F****** GRUBHUB TO DEAL WITH IT.\" Which I did, the customer service rep for grubhub was very kind and I told her what had happen, she put me on hold to call and confirm with the restaurant. When she came back to my call she had obviously also felt a little accosted by the manager on shift. She apologized for how I had been treated and issued a refund and a credit.\n\nWhile only the refund was required I appreciate how GrubHub handled this and am dismayed at how Village Pizzeria behaved.

One slice here is the equivalent of two slices anywhere else. Prices are reasonable (in the $4-$5 range, depending on what you order). Unlike a lot of pizzerias, these guys bake their slices from scratch. They're not just reheating a slice of cheese pizza and sprinkling a few pieces of pepperoni on top. So you can always count on Village Pizzeria to serve you a slice straight out of the oven. Crisp crust + hot, gooey cheese every time.\n\nIt's nice to have a pizzeria you can always rely on.

We stayed here for a good 3 hours!  The Meatlover's pizza kept us full way into overtime.  Piping hot, hand spun thin crust pizza that's cheesy, but a bit greasy (because there are LOTS of meat!) it's everything that a reliable pizza should be.  BTW, Village Pizzeria has been dishing up goodies since 1979.\n\nYou can also order pizza by the slice -- try their BBQ chicken, it's chock full of deliciously coated, tender meat!  One serving is more than enough.  Don't forget to get a side of garlic rolls, I sprinkled additional granulated garlic and parmesan cheese on mine. Oh, so good!\n\nSF Giant's memorabilia are scattered all over the resto along with some old timey black and white photographs of San Francisco tourist spots. The exposed brick wall adds to the historical feel of the place. \n\nWe got fantastic service from Cassie, thanks for taking care of us!

I have visited since I was a little kid, and they are my 'preferred' delivery option in my area.  However- the key to Village Pizza is ordering their THICK CRUST \"Sicilian\" pizza.  If you order the \"Neapolitan\" thin crust, you will have a very 'ordinary' slice of pizza- decent but nothing special.\n\nThe Sicilian, however, is the best in its class in SF.  You can order these by the slice at the restaurant, or in 'half' (six slice) or 'whole' (twelve slice) pizzas.  The slices are rectangular in shape, approximately 3/4\" thick, and have a great crisp to the them.  Two slices fills me, three puts me in food coma- but they taste so good its hard to resist. My personal favorite is ordering a Sicilian with extra cheese, pepperoni, and pesto/tomato sauce mixed, and cooked \"well done\".  Ask for a little basil on top too-  you will be a fan for life if you order this.\n\nWhile there are many many many pizza options in SF, some trendy, some dive-ish- Village maintains the old-school pizzeria feel with consistently good food.

I had paid more than I'd like to for something as basic as a cheese pizza, but I also paid a delivery fee... to wait 2 hours for my food. The pizza wasn't hot and had clearly been sitting for awhile. I don't need to go into details, but I will say that I won't ever order from here again and I will be calling for a refund in the morning.", "author": "Matthew M."}

Although I tried to explain that I wasn't who she thought I was, she kept telling me to find something better to do and quit calling. When I asked (just to clarify) if it was Village Pizzeria, she said that it was Round Table Pizza and that Village Pizzeria had closed. Aside from that incident, when going in to pick up my order, she is, by turns, nice or dismissive, depending on the day.\n\nOn my most recent call, one of the cooks answered my call (I know their voices, too).

So don't bother with that.\n\nSecond, when you order online like I did, it says you can request free parmesan and hot pepper packets. I'd advise against this, as there was a mysterious item on my receipt titled \"charge\" of $1.50 that I suspect was the result of asking for those little packets, as the only other thing I ordered was the pizza.\n\nThird, they promise to call to confirm your order when you submit online. I waited for the call to ask about the estimated delivery time--but alas when I spoke to someone at the restaurant he promptly shouted that they received my order and hung up on me. I looked at my phone: the call was 4 seconds long. It seems they make a habit of doing that to customers.\n\nIt was a bad experience but I thought I would cut my losses. Unfortunately, it's not over. Today the charge appeared on my card statement as $10 over the amount I signed for. I thought the courteous thing would be to give them a chance to correct their mistake.

As I was politely explaining the situation, the manager said \"You'll have to talk to your bank\" and abruptly hung up on me.

I've tried a plethora of pizza places and none compare to the delicious thin crust New York style pizza of Village. Amici's and Victor's on Polk are a close second, but Village blows them out of the water. \n\nVillage Pizzeria is located on Van Ness and Sutter and has been serving the Bay Area since 1979. Village offers delivery as well as dine-in service. Delivery orders can be placed online and by phone. One perk to the phone ordering is if you are a repeating customer, you have the option of keeping your credit card on file for even faster and easier service. Eating at the restaurant is also fun because you can sit at the counter and watch the pizza experts toss the dough in the air and they often have specials. Village also offers pizza by the slice if you are on-the-go. \n\nIn addition to pizza, Village also makes great salads, appetizers and pasta. My favorite are the spicy chicken wings that literally set my mouth on fire but taste so darn good. The garlic bread, antipasto salad and Greek salad are also favorites of mine. The peperoni pizza is excellent although it can be quite greasy.

It came out very hot and slightly on the greasy side.  I ordered the spicy BBQ pulled pork with pineapple and it was pretty good.  Would come back if I was in the area and needed a quick snack, but don't think I'd order whole pizzas here.  I should mention that I really liked the crust.  It was not doughy and hard to chew like some places, but had a good crunch to it and just enough marinara sauce that the toppings don't want to separate from the crust.", "author": "Christopher L."}

I ended up paying close  to $30 for a medium pepperoni and 2 coke cans plus delivery. This isn't some \"oh this medium is almost a large!\" No,  it's almost a small pizza. Anyway,  the guy showed up here and was rude right off the bat. He shoved the pizza at my husband and asked him for a tip to which my husband informed him that he has no change with him and the delivery guy, pretty pissed, said \"next time you should include a good tip!\" And stormed off. A lady closer to us informed him a tip is earned and his wasn't. I was livid. Honestly,  the delivery charge should be more than enough considering the pizza is already absurdly priced.  I'm glad to give tips,  we are more than happy to give a tip when we receive good service. I feel like I want a refund because after all that I felt like I lost my appetite.

The sauce is good, not overwhelming and definitely not too sweet (I hate overly sweet pizza sauce).\n\nWe also got the anti-pasto salad with bleu cheese dressing.  The bleu cheese dessing was pretty good.  The salad was a bit of disappointment  Lots of cheese, some salami and a couple of olives.  I'm used to seeing chunks of salami and not thin slices on my salad, but maybe that's just personal preference.\n\nNow, the Service. Our first waitress was awesome.  Stellar, totally on top of it.  Unfortunately, she got busy just as we were getting ready to leave.\n\nSo we waited and waited and waited for someone to bring us our bill.\n\nOnce we got it, we waited and waited and waited for someone to pick it up.  Finally, as we were gathering our things to leave a different waitress (one who appeared to have shown up late) rushed up to our table, effectively blocking us in, preventing us from standing up, and counted the money we left while standing there, flipping money everywhere and taking forever while she counted it TWICE.\n\nLook lady, if we were gonna dine and dash we had AMPLE opportunity to bail while you were ignoring us for about 15 minutes after we asked for the check.\n\nAlthough the pizza was ok and the location is convenient, we probably won't be going back anytime soon.\n\nI feel sorry for our good waitress who had to share the tip with the idiot who picked up the bill.

There hasnt been one occasion where the service was stellar. In fact most of the time it is sub par at best. I finally reached my limit with their poor customer service. I called to order a pizza for myself and a couple of guys i work with so that we could skip the wait when we showed up. When the phone was answered, I was surprised by the impatient and rude nature of the the womans voice on the other end. She quickly spit out some words which were unrecognizable followed by silence. Thinking i got disconnected i proptly hung up and called back. Again a woman picks up and this time tells me she is very busy and there are three calls ahead of me in the same impatient and rude voice and was commanded to hold. I didnt have a chance to respond or tell her before the line went silent. After waiting on hold for 5 minutes she returned only to tell me she could not hear me and that i should call back when its not as noisy. At this point i had given up on ordering a pizza. I would however try to call back later to let her/them know how i felt about their customer service. I waited until my break and try to call back. Not surprisingly the phone was answered only this time a male whom was every bit as unpleasant as his counter part. I asked to speak with the manager and was told they \"we're to busy to deal with you\" and to \"call back later.\" I felt i had no other option than to write a review to hopefully get them to take better care of their customers.

I purposely did not order a similar dish that contained mushrooms because I am allergic to them. There was a little slice of a mushroom on top so I picked it off, thinking it must have fallen in from another dish. After 2 bites, I realized that I had just chewed up a thick slice of mushroom that was covered in tomato sauce. I am writing this while I await the violent vomiting and diarrhea that swallowing that mushroom is going to cause in about half an hour. I called the restaurant and the owner answered. He read my order back to me and told me I ordered a dish that listed mushrooms in the ingredients. I told him I most certainly did NOT! I read him the description of the dish from his own website's online menu and he told me that the dish  I ordered, that he just read back to me, isn't on the menu. He had a frustrating, belittling way of  speaking to me as if I'm the crazy one. I told him to look on his own site. He put me on hold for what seems like an eternity to someone who has just consumed their most feared allergen and FINALLY got back on the phone and started reading the description of the dish I had NOT ordered. We argued more, he put me on hold again, then got back on the phone to say he saw it. He didn't seem to want to acknowledge that I had been right and that I had good reason to be angry. He also DIDN'T APOLOGIZE!!! He made me literally yell into the phone which I have never done in my life, but frustrated and poisoned, I had to go with my gut reaction since my gut reactions are all I will have tonight. If he had said \"I'm so,so,so sorry! What can I do to make this better?\" I would have said \"Nothing now, but don't do this again to me or anyone else.\" Instead, he frustrated me beyond words and offered to replace the meal with what I ordered in the first place. I told him the last thing I need now is food since I will be sick all night from the mushroom and hung up. He's an idiot. I have ordered a lot of food from his restaurant over the past twenty plus years I have lived a block from his restaurant.

They went a little thick on the cheese, which is okay with me. I love cheese. I guess there was just nothing special about the taste of the pizza. It didn't stand out.

This despite being busy with the take-out and delivery orders from others.\n\nThe pizza itself was fantastic.

Sauce tastes canned, slices are small, and the crust is inconsequential, as I do not care for that part of the pizza. More importantly, the salads are chintzy and just as overpriced as everything else on the menu.\n\nOn the upside, service is excellent and the woman manning the register is a joy to chat with. It would be delightful if I actually HAD that much time to hang out and talk. Unfortunately, it takes a long time to get even the simplest order to take out here. I mean, even a slice takes upwards of 10 minutes on a good day.\n\nSo. Two stars for the charming company while I wait and the comfortable, clean environment to wait in.

Like the Holy Trinity, it contains multiple parts out of which a pizza is made whole. At Village Pizzeria, the perfection to which those parts are blended is what determines how good your experience will be. I tried Village Pizza and found that its strengths and weaknesses are almost exactly what Yelpers said they were in advance.\n\n1) The sauce: Bland and probably canned. 3 stars at best. If you come across a spot on your slice where bare sauce is revealed, by all means make sure to steal a mushroom or onion or some topping from elsewhere on the slice to cover that bald spot. It's the pizza equivalent of a combover, but desperate times demand desperate measures.\n\n2) The toppings: Excellent. They have my favorite type of pepperoni -- the small, quarter-sized slices that crisp up around the edges. The veggies were fresh, too. Four stars.\n\n3) The crust: Primo. Light and chewy with just a tinge of crispness. You can watch the chef expertly fling and flip the dough for hour after hour, so he's certainly got the method down. You better hope he doesn't play ultimate Frisbee, because he'd surely whomp your ass. Five stars.\n\nOf course, I ordered a custom pie.

I must have mistakenly typed a wrong phone number on my contact info. I apologized and asked when I should expect my pizza be ready for pick up. Again I was yelled at;  since they could not reach me, why would they start a pizza without a confirmation.  I understand I made a mistake but I called to confirm before I showed up at their restaurant.   This person taking the call (male, didn't sound like owner) was so rude and not understanding of the situation. All he had to do was say that he wasn't able to get in touch with me but will start on my pizza asap. Ultimately I decided to cancel my order and never order from them again.

Please pack your knives and go.\"\n\nI mean, chicken, broccoli, roma tomatoes, garlic, and green onions on a pizza??  I couldn't think of a better combination.

The cheese, sauce, and the rest of the ingredients were tasty, but for $4.50 for one slice, I want a bigger slice!  Plus, chicken is really the main attraction on this pizza... and I scraped most of mine off.  (When meat is so processed that you start worrying you'll bite into a ground-up bone... that is not high quality chicken, folks.)\n\nThe reason for 3 stars is that I liked the ambiance of the exposed brick walls, and the service was very good.  Of course, the place was totally empty, so who knows about the service on a busy afternoon.

Burnt, unsavory, dry, unappetizing describe the slice and the service. The coke on the other hand was good hence the two stars but at almost $6 for drink + (bad) slice this place isn't a bargain.", "author": "Pax, Formerly Known As Rufus D."}

I looked at the clock and realized it was 3pm, a mere 2 hours since I had ordered the pizza via their website.  Now, I know that if you're a pizza place and it's New Years Day, you're probably slammed.  2 hours, though?  I must go back to the time for a moment.  You see, it damn well could have been 3am, and that pizza damn well could have been Mr. Pizza Man, and I damn well could have still been drunk.  Mr. Pizza Man would have tasted better, actually.  That was the kind of pizza you inhale without tasting at some ridiculous hour.  Unless you're eating deep dish pizza, a fork and knife should not leave the drawer.  I had to use mine, and I was none too thrilled.  \n\nIt was soggy, the toppings literally stayed in the box as you pulled a slice out, and although one of the toppings was allegedly meatballs, they more closely resembled meatball shavings and not actual chunks of meat.  The sauce was literally poured out of a can and the crust resembled that of a bike tire.  I had to douse every slice with Frank's Hot Sauce just to make it edible.  Add to all of this the fact that I rented \"Harold & Kumar 2: Escape from Guantanamo Bay\", only to turn it off some 14 minutes into the movie....what an unbelievably horrible film.  I'd like Village Pizzeria to give me those 14 minutes back, because even if it wasn't their fault that I ordered the movie, it actually was.\n\nSave your money and order Escape from New York.  You'll thank me.\n\nP.S. - I tried to post this review with no stars, but Yelp is making put at least one.", "author": "Ilan K."}

This was not the case. \nMy total came out around $18 for a 14\" pizza. I got my order about 45 minutes after, but the price was $3 higher! I called them and they said their prices were wrong online. This is no problem if they would CALL you and inform you of this rather than trying to pull a fast one. Nothing was offered for my grievances, even though I explained to them I wouldn't have bought the pizza if it was that expensive. I want my 45 minutes back. \nOk, I was hungry enough to dish out the extra money.  The pizza was not very hot. I had a pesto chicken, the ingredients were good but there was hardly an pesto on it. Now the crust was what really ruined the taste.  I don't know if they have other crust options but their hand tossed is horrible.\nI will never eat from here again.", "author": "Aaron T."}

Much better in comparison to, for example, Escape from New York. They also have very flavorful salads and pasta dishes, as well as good desserts. Their sandwiches and bread choices (they have a garlic roll) are dry and disappointing as well as their portion sizes. For the price, you get a very small portion of pasta when you order in.

This comes from a childhood spent in part with a strict stepmother who took great joy in making you eat any and all foods presented to you, especially if she knew said food was something you thought to be gross.  Big squishy cooked mushrooms topped my list back then and therefore I had to force them down.  Yucck.  Nowadays I can and will eat mushrooms if need be but try to avoid them.  The lady that works at Village Pizzeria seems to always put me to that test.  She is always friendly and seems happy to see me. Whenever she gets my order wrong, which seems to happen with alarming frequency, it is always mushrooms that make it on to my slice.  She even did it twice in one visit to me as I sent the first one back, telling her my slice was pepperoni, onions and green peppers and she had swapped the onions with mushrooms.  She apologized went back and a few minutes later brought me a pepperoni, onion and mushroom slice.  Hungry as all hell I just ate the  slice, and just laughed to myself.  I think she and my stepmom are in cahoots somehow.  Over time I have I figured out this is just the way she is. On another visit with a friend she brought us both salads, later cleared our plates and then brought our pizza.  When she brought the pizza she asked us if she forgot to bring our salads out.  She had literally cleared our plates thirty seconds ago!  She really does crack me up.  \n\nAnd so it goes with Village Pizza. I get pizza from this place fairly regularly, I live right around the corner and it is pretty good, not great, but better than any other delivery around these parts that I know of.  The people working here are friendly and I usually get it fairly quickly and the place is a part of my hood.  \n\nAlso you can go to their website and place your order online, which is nice when you don't feel like picking up the phone.", "author": "Tom K."}

The meat was tough and rubber like and had no taste. It was gross. When the waitress came back and asked us if we wanted more to drink, that was when I told her I didn't like the meatballs. She just said \"o\" and walked away. Later we got the bill and I asked are we still getting charged for the meatball she went back and tried to change the receipt. Another woman comes back and asks us to explain what happened and I did. She said well you should have said something in the beginning. I was like what?

The salads are always fresh and delish! give it a shot.. this place has a true san franciscan's stamp of approval all over it!! would subtract a star for a single slice costing damn near 5 bucks, but you get what you pay for!", "author": "maria p."}
