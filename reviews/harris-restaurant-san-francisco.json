Most of them being in New York, so it was nice to see what the Bay Area has to offer. \n\nIt's funny to go to a high class restaurant when everything in the Bay Area is already so crazy expensive. Back at home there is such a variety of different price ranged restaurants so when you go out and get fancy it's a special occasion. Now living here everyday is a special occasion! \n\nI felt kind of so so about the ambiance. On one hand I loved the classic wood and dark look, but on the other wished it had a little bit more of a modern feel. I find I am typically the youngest one when going out to \"5 Star\" type restaurants and here the vibe definitely made me feel even younger. \n\nThe food was great, the portions were ok, and the dessert was ok. These were very classic dishes, no risky flavors or spices. I wish I saw something a little more creative. With that said, cooking aged steak is an amazing art and beautiful/tasty as is. But I wish more chefs put a little twist on the classic dish.", "author": "Demi K."}

If you can get over that fact then you are in for a wonderful old-school steak house experience. I have been fortunate enough to enjoy this place for over 3 decades.\n\nThe overall food experience has slipped a bit since the matriarch of this iconic restaurant was last seen welcoming guests and guiding this place (she was a Bluehair too, BTW). I will still venture over to this place once in a while to enjoy their second-to-none beef dishes.\n\nTheir bar is still has a cozy, 'Upper Crust' and (again) old-school feel to it. On weekends they have a jazz pianist gently tickling the ivories for bar guests. Sitting in that bar will make you feel special and pampered. You might almost expect Tony Bennett to step from behind the curtains to serenade the unsuspecting patrons of this establishment with a tune or two.\n\nThe wait-staff is excellent at what they do. The bartender still knows how to make all the standards perfectly. There is usually not even a Hipster in sight. The man-buns will usually catch fire upon entering thru these hallowed doors I am told.\n\nAfter the pre-meal drinking has subsided it's on to the main course: their food. \n\nI have seldom ventured far from their beef entrees. My choice has always been their executive cut of prime rib. Many might say that House of Prime Rib (HoPR) up a few blocks on Van Ness has a better P.R. I would beg to differ. Harris' can really deliver that large hunk of juicy wonderfulness cooked to perfection medium-rare is what few other establishments have been able to match in all of my years of adult life.\n\nHoPR has much more a tourist joint feel to it. Harris' does not. Much quieter and a more stately ambiance oozes from their cozy comfy leathery table booths. That's another reason why you would choose to go to Harris' for your P.R. than to HoPR.\n\nI am not too excited about Harris' side dishes (other than their baked potato), nor their desserts. I am here for only the meat. Take all those other dishes away, they don't much concern me. The Harris' Prime Rib (and their steaks, I hear) is the center of attention. Oh...their in-house made bread is the bomb too!\n\nOh...and they have a very wonderful side room for private dining while with a larger group. \n\nMah-vel-ous Dah-ling!", "author": "william s."}

It was a bit of a last minute decision and we got here at 9:30 pm on a Saturday night even though last call was at 9:45 pm. It was still packed with people at that hour and eventually died down around 10:30 pm. \n\nWith no reservations near closing, we were seated immediately. Our server was nice throughout the entire dinner but did not seem very attentive or interactive/talkative - maybe because it's the end of the night. Jumping ahead, when we asked for to-go boxes, he asked if we wanted him to pack or pack our own. We said our own as we thought he just had other customers to attend to but I would've expected him to pack it for us. \n\nFOOD - we started off with seared foie gras ($30) and it was DELICIOUS and mouth watering! It came with 2 pieces of meat on toast and I think it was a great first experience for my boyfriend. I'd definitely come back for this! \n\nI got the 16 oz Bone-In Ribeye. It came with a side of potato (baked or evenings choice) and veggies. The veggies were delicious and I opted for a scalloped potato, which was good and probably the size of my palm. The bone-in ribeye was medium rare with a slab of butter on top. The ribeye was good and juicy but a little too chewy for me - my molars got tired of biting so I stopped eating halfway through my steak. \n\nMy bf got a pepper jack steak and it was good. If you love the taste of black pepper, you'd love this. \n\nDRINK - we brought our own bottle of wine from home and it was a $30 corkage fee.

We came in for a 6:30 reservation on a Friday night for our anniversary. From start to finish, this is the worst experience we've ever had in a restaurant of this caliber. After being seated in the practically empty dining room, our waiter took 15 minutes to come to our table. No water, no greeting, no acknowledgement. Just the two of us sitting and waiting. Once the waiter arrived, he showed up with a stained vest and zero interest in us, just greeting us with a, \"hi, what can I get you,\" in the most unenthusiastic way possible. Were we interrupting him? \n\nFor the rest of the meal, he was so absent that we had to keep stopping other staff members to get more water or more bread, etc. Between the two of us, we ordered 4 drinks, 2 appetizers, and 2 entrees. They all came out so quickly and without any thought...appetizers and main dishes were served at the same time. Our meal lasted 45 minutes. So in 45 minutes, we spent $250 and our waiter made a pretty penny in our tip and no one gave any care about us. Just shuttling us in and out without even a mention of our anniversary. \n\nWhen the waiter came by to ask if we had interest in dessert, we replied no and he just walked away with zero response. This was by far the strangest and most outrageous experience we've ever had. What a waste of money--I'd say it was a waste of time, but in just 45 minutes we were in and out.

Still, for a business in San Francisco these days to last this long, it's a testament that they are doing something right.  This was actually my first meal here as it was never a priority to come here and, when they first opened, it was a dress code sensitive destination (jackets required for men).\n\nMy friend chose this place for a belated birthday dinner on a midweek summer night.  Having a 615 pm reservation, we were a little early yet still immediately seated in the left dining room in a booth.  Being still summer, this room is brightly lit with the street view windows; the other dining room is tucked to the right near the bar.  After taking our drink orders, our waiter asked whether we had menu questions.  After deliberation about their extensive menu, here's what I ate:\n\nAppetizer\n1.  Onion rings (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=UikPihu769YaQJteBu47Nw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) (shared) - A nice stack of crisp morsels which were served hot but not piping hot.  My host prefers a thinner batter but I liked them for ketchup dipping purposes.\n\nEntr\u00e9e\n2.  Porterhouse, medium rare (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=huN_ON_8I6yiGdapgZ0LWA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Generous cut of beef and cooked as ordered perfect medium rare.  The texture of the two meat cuts are testament to their aging skills.  The portion was deceiving due to the thickness of the cut.  Kudos to the butcher in trimming the fat.  The sides (baked potato and vegetables) were perfectly cooked; only wished bacon bits were a topping option for the potato.\n\nSides\n3.  Saut\u00e9ed mushrooms (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=LfzGqwOwHQl3szPFIDDtUA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - One of the better version as the mushrooms we're not overcooked nor over salted like most places.\n\n4.  Creamed spinach (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=GTeYIYDVYsSprZrrvgye-g&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - On a par with the meat place up the street, this rich side gave our meals a nice pace change.\n\nOur waiter's demeanor fit the vibe here, laid back yet still professional and on the formal side.  I understand that it used to be a jacket required for men's establishment but business casual seems the norm now.  Our bus persons were efficient in refilling water glasses, removing dirty plates, and packing our leftovers.  I asked the waiter whether the restaurant was related to the Harris' Ranch and he said only in that the owners of each are relatives.  \n\nYou know what happens when you've been eating too well for the past month...

From there, it was a disaster.  Although my companions ordered bone-in ribeyes and were delighted, I had the misfortune to order the prime rib:  a huge slab of tough, cold in the center, under-seasoned meat.  Had the waiter returned even ONCE during the entire dinner, I would have sent it back and asked for a steak.  He didn't bother to return until my companion had to waive his hand in the air and ask for coffee.  He seemed irritated that we had to summon him, and even then didn't ask how our dinner was.\n\nI know my party paid very dearly for this dinner and I didn't have the heart to disappoint them because they work very hard for their money and I know this was a stretch for all of them.\n\nOverall, I would have had a much better dinner and overall experience had I gone to Tad's Steak House on Powell Street.\n\nNEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "author": "Richard C."}

That being said, the service was only okay, not what I would have expected of a nice buttoned up establishment like this.\n\nI was not particularly impressed by Harris's filet mignon which should be the plate used to judge any place that calls themselves a steakhouse. The portion was great and they even brought the steak right out to us at the table to show us the cut. However, I asked for medium and mine was cooked well. It was also cooked fairly unevenly across the thick vs thin part of the cut. This made the meat tough to eat and while it was slathered in butter, the flavor was not rich. By the time I ate my way to the thickest part of the filet, it was closer to medium well and a bit less chewy. \n\nOutside of the steak options, I really enjoyed the lobster mac and cheese. This was the most memorable part of the meal. \n\nTLDR: Think ahead and make reservations at Alexander's instead.", "author": "Kathy T."}

The atmosphere was enchanting; Harris' was an extravagant place to enjoy a fancy meal. The lighting, artwork, and piano music all added to the luxurious vibe.\n\nMy dad and I wore jeans/collared shirts (since we are from Hawaii and tend to be more casual), but there were many people wearing suits/dresses. I felt like I had made it in this world; it is always fantastic when a restaurant can create that type of transforming environment.\n\nWe received a crunchy, flat bread (more like a chip than a bread) with a creamy dipping sauce. I thought it was butter and went right for it. It tasted slightly different than the butter I am used to, but I nonetheless enjoyed it. My dad told me, \"I'm surprised you ate pate.\" \"What is that?\" I asked him. He responded, \"Goose liver. I would never eat it.\" I still am unsure if he even really knows what this particular pate is made of, but, either way, I felt classy feasting on this elite appetizer and thus ignored my dad's uncultured comment.\n\nUpon my waiter's suggestion, I decided to try the Australian Wagyu Beef. Holy Cow! Literally and metaphorically. I have never tasted such a juicy, tender steak in my life. The butter flavoring was delicious as well.\n\nI decided to finish the meal off with some bread pudding. This was some delectable bread pudding, and I know good bread pudding (it's my favorite desert, so I would consider myself an amateur connoisseur).\n\nThe wait staff were all dressed very nicely and demonstrated incredible empathy/self-awareness in their interactions. Recognizing that my dad and I air on the more casual side of diners, our food/check were brought out efficiently.

So, we checked in with the host & got seated right away. Our waiter came by & asked what we'd like to drink; we all just stuck with water. Shortly after, he brought out a complimentary plate of bread chips and some kind of cheese spread & butter. It was pretty good. So, we ordered...\n\nTwo Porterhouse Steaks 24oz - $63 each\nThe Harris Steak 16oz -- a Thick Bone-in New York - $56. \n \nThe entrees come with saut\u00e9ed seasonal vegetables and a baked potato, mashed potatoes or the evening's potato (NOT served on SATURDAYS).

So, the calamari was really good. Tasted fresh & crispy. The batter was light and healthy tasting (compared to other places where its soggy, greasy or fried for too long). \n\nShared the porterhouse with the bf. We said medium but felt like it was overcooked. It had a charred taste which Im not really a fan of. Tried my sister's harris steak which I liked better; it was more tender & juicy. The mashed potatoes were very creamy and good too. Usually I would just go to Texas Roadhouse for steak and get the ribeye so not sure how fancy, pricey steak is suppose to taste?

The City location is a dressed up version. Speaking of dressed up - I wish they would require jackets for men. People have lost their decorum to dress appropriately for the type of establishment.

Instead, a red blend section would be more representative. Or a GSM section. The wine was good but wasn't expecting it to be a blend. Luckily all the grapes were ones I liked.

A meat refrigerator greets you as you enter, like a high end butcher shop.  Dark woods, high ceilings, and dim lighting abound adorned the huge dining area, with a mix of bar, table, and spacious half circle booth seating. \n\nMENU:\nSeafood apps, soups, salads, steak, prime rib, fish, lobster, and a 3-course turkey feast because it was Thanksgiving night. \n\nBEVERAGE:\nMartini - The glasses are smaller than usual, but the rest of your liquid is stored in a mini carafe on ice.  So sexy!\n\nFOOD:\nOnion Rings - Our friends who brought us here specifically said they were going to order this as it's one of their favorites.  While the freshly battered onion rings were crunchy and tasty, they came to our table at room temperature.  Very disappointing.  \n\nMushrooms - Simply saut\u00e9ed whole mushrooms in garlic butter.  Went great with the steaks. \n\nTraditional Onion Soup - There was no cheese in this as it's not a French style (as informed by our server).  The dark soup had excellent flavor, with the submerged crotons still sporting some crunchy edges.  The onions were cooked perfect and weren't soggy. \n\nWedge Salad - I split this with my spouse as I wanted ranch dressing instead of blue cheese.  The quarter head of iceberg was fresh, but the ranch dressing wasn't the tastiest I've had, very low in sodium and creaminess. \n\nPepper Steak - The boneless New York was 2\" thick, nice and peppery, and finished in a deliciously creamy brown Brandy peppercorn sauce.  I was a bit hesitant when told it came with sugar snap peas because most places don't string them properly, but these guys did, and they were nice and crunchy.  My side was a perfectly baked potato, with an overly generous pat of butter and heaping spoonful of sour cream compliments of the condiment server.  Highly recommended!\n\nDESSERT:\nButterscotch Pudding - This dessert disliker loved it!  The smooth and velvety pudding was absolutely delectable and best of all, not overly sweet nor heavy.  \n\nSERVICE:\nVinci took great care of us.  She was very professional, helpful, patient, and checked on us often.  Excellent service!\n\nOVERALL:\nPleasant ambiance, exceptional food, skillful service.  4.5 stars.", "author": "Vince N."}

Granted, I have only been once, but with those prices, once in a lifetime, for mediocre food and below average service, is plenty for this cowboy.\n\nCraftsteak and CUT in Vegas would be bashful to see the prices at this gin joint. I've been to both of those establishments and considering that I don't drink liquor anymore, walking away from each location, dropping over $250 on food, wasn't easy. It was easier knowing the quality was exceptional, the service was spectacular. Now, we could easily go Reservoir Dogs breakfast at the diner conversation here, but let's save that for another day. \n\nThe best man at my wedding is a dear friend of ours. He and his wife were in town and he used to live it up at this spot. I suspect he was drawing on the memories of yesteryear when he chose this restaurant and despite my better judgement, I agreed.\n\nOn to the food, shall we?\n\nI ordered the The Harris Steak described as \"a Thick Bone-in New York\"\n\nThere was no bone to be had. Now that I think about it, they basically served me the Petite Boneless NY and called it \"a Thick Bone-in New York\" I am scrolling up to reduce another star now!!\n\nThe steak was decent. Lacked the proper seasoning that a perfect steak needs. Cooked almost medium rare. If you are thinking \"this dude is picky\" you'd be 100% accurate with your thoughts. At $59 a pop, you better believe I have high expectations! Sadly, at least on this night, high expectations come with even bigger letdowns!! So glad I managed to walk myself off the Wagyu ledge!!! I bet they make a tough Wagyu though, right??\n\nThe dessert was not very good. We ordered the creme brulee (bland) bread pudding (blander than bland) and some coffee. The coffee was okay, I guess.\n\nOverall, I wasted $200 and all I have to show for it is this 2 star review!!!", "author": "Hector G."}

Everything was done so nicely including the printing of the menus, the setup of the welcome table and our centerpieces.  All my family and guests commented on how professional and pleasant Kimberley and the rest of the staff were.\n\nAnd last but not least, the main reason we chose Harris' was for its steaks and the food did not disappoint!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-09-20", "description": "I will first admit that I came into Harris pre-salted because I wanted to eat something I couldn't get back home in DC, so dining out at a steakhouse puzzled me. However, that being said, I was not wowed by my meal here and, in fact, felt a little bit sick.\n\nThe restaurant itself is about what I expected. Quite traditional decor, very dimly-lit, sharply-dressed servers. From the bar side of Harris, we could hear live music being played and sung, which was a nice touch. The first thing that was brought out to us was drinks menus. I wasn't interested, so I waited and waited and waited until the dinner menus were finally brought out. (As you can tell, I was not a fan of not being able to agonize over what I was going to eat for so long.)\n\nAfter we ordered food, each person was given one delicious roll of bread - just one? with all that butter? Ooookay. My boyfriend and I split the 24 oz. porterhouse and sprung to try it with the seared foie gras. For splitting an entree, Harris lets you have your own plate with your own portion of sides for an additional charge, which is nice. All the food came out at about the same time, which I would expect from this kind of formal dining establishment.\n\nThe porterhouse was... fine. Not great, which is what I was expecting at this price point, but fine. The flavor was... fine. And the doneness and texture were... fine. But I didn't want to finish it. And while I wasn't full by the time I was done eating what I wanted to eat, I felt a little bit unwell. I'm not sure what happened here, as it looked fantastic and smelled amazing, but something was just a little bit off. The foie gras was good but I think you can definitely pass, it didn't change my life as many foie gras fans claimed it would.\n\nSince I was still hungry and looking for this meal to dazzle me, we got the baked Alaska for dessert. Again, it was just fine, and we wound up not finishing it.\n\nAlso, this might sound trivial, but at past visits to nice steakhouses, I've experienced a more friendly level of service? At Harris, I often felt like the servers were a bit annoyed with us and weren't particularly warm. Granted, we were a very large group of 20-somethings who were not dressed to the nines for our meal here, but while no one was rude to us in the slightest, I am used to a much warmer level of service at this type of restaurant.\n\nHowever, we still had a lot of fun at Harris. And remember that it is a formal dining establishment, as we were reminded when a server asked one of our party to remove his hat. But would I recommend Harris as a fantastic night out meal? I don't think so, especially not for out-of-town guests.", "author": "Starr C."}

We ordered a round of cocktails to start and some waters, along with some Crab Cakes. The support staff were great about bringing out bread and keeping our water glasses full. Our server however forgot the Crab Cakes and didn't even realize it until way too late.\n\nWe ordered salads to start. The Cesar Salad, Wedge, and House Salad were all disappointments. Our steak choices included a Filet Mignon, Filet Rossini, and the Porterhouse. The Filet Rossini was delish! I truly enjoyed the flavors. The asparagus and mashed potatoes were perfect sides.\n\nWe also ordered a side of creamed spinach which we should have skipped.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the Baked Alaskan, Cheesecake, Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and Chocolate Cake. I enjoyed my Baked Alaskan and my Brother liked the Chocolate Cake but I wouldn't order dessert here again.\n\nIn sum, the quality of the service has really plummeted but there are still good staples.

We were all very excited for the evening and to eat at a historic steakhouse.  To say the least, we were for the most part underwhelmed.  The service was fine, and the food came out in a timely manner, it just wasn't as good as we expected.  The biggest issue was the medium rare (based on chef's recommendation) New York, that was medium at best.  This was across the board with all steaks on the table.  Medium rare should be juicy and deep red in the center, not pink and borderline dry.  The steak was also a tad under-seasoned, not enough for the butter on top to make up for.\n\nAll the food was satisfactory, just not GOOD, which is what you would like at this price point.", "author": "Tom M."}

Our reservation was at 7pm on Saturday evening. Parking was a bit of a hassle, but we eventually found free street parking just a block away from the restaurant on Van Ness. Sweet! There are two entrances, a single door at the corner of Van Ness and Pacific, right under the Harris' logo. And the other has double doors just down the side of the building on Pacific, adjacent to the cool window display of dry-aged meats. We were brought to our seats immediately after checking in with the hostess, and directed to the impressive main Van Ness room: high ceilings, dark woods, large booths, as well as smaller booths for 2 where we dined for the evening. Service was friendly and timely: our waiter came by just enough to check in during our meal.\n\nWe started off with cocktails. The little miss ordered the French 75, while I tried the Aviation. Both were tasty! Hers came in a flute, while mine was served up in a smaller sized martini glass, with the excess kept in a small carafe over ice in a cute mini wood bucket. Nice presentation!\n\nFor dinner we ordered the Harris steak, which is a bone-in NY cut steak, as well as the bone-in rib-eye, with a bottle of Zinfandel to share. I asked our waiter for his opinion, and he mentioned that both steaks were quite popular. People enjoy the dry-aged flavors of the NY cut, and folks also enjoy the marbling of the rib-eye. Win-win. The gf wanted to add seared foie gras on top of the rib-eye for that extra good good. Our waiter suggested to upgrade her choice by preparing her rib-eye Rossini style, with foie gras and truffle Cabernet sauce. Got 'em. Both came with asparagus and our choice of potatoes for sides. We had mashed potatoes, the evening's preparation. We also ordered a side of cream of spinach, which in retrospect we didn't need. It wasn't that special either. Our steaks, on the other hand, were delicious! While both steaks were exceptional, we agreed that the rib-eye was the winner of the night. For dessert, we gave their Guinness chocolate cake a try. She was not impressed, but I liked it! The good folks at Harris' were kind enough to personalize our dessert to commemorate the occasion.

I am not really a fancy steakhouse person, but every once in a while an occasion comes up that demands the a \"dining experience\" and since I spent a good portion of my life in the \"industry\" I avoid the weird presentation of tiny food places. I am not buying it. Give me Rusty's. So this was one of those occasions that was best celebrated by going old school, and Harris' fit the bill.\nAs I mentioned I spent a long time working in restaurants, and this place reminds me of those years. Back in the late 70's I was going to SF State and working as a busboy at MacPark and the current owner of this place, Goetz Boje, was the chef. The crew of busboys at that time was an interseting mix, law school students, Yale SOD dropouts, marathoners, dancers... we all enjoyed smoking a little weed before, during and after our shift so when then the very serious Austrian chef gathered us to talk about bread slicing, he never could quite figure out why we found him to be hysterical. Maybe that is why he took Joey and Jose and split for Coalinga, doubt it. It was probably the money, and to get away from Larry Mindel. But I digress. It was a good move for him, but left MacPark in a downward spiral. \nSo, back to the review...\nAlan, our server was super good. He seemed to be handling a fairly demanding section but was always there and very present without being too much so. Sorry, having done this for fucking ever I always am very aware of the server's \"approach\" and he was awesome.

I could name a lot of other steak restaurants that cost less and taste better. However, the calamari there is just pathetic. It tasted like gum after its been chewed for too long and even the sauces did not make the calamari any better. And the strawberry whip watermelon drink or whatever  (the drink was that unmemorable) did not live up to its description. It took about 10 minutes for the drink to arrive, which I wouldn't mind if the drink actually lived up to my expectations. I expected it to be sweet, but it tasted slightly sour and nothing like watermelon. It was fresh, yes, but it didn't taste good. The only reason I gave this place a 3 star was because of the good service and overall nice atmosphere.", "author": "Aurora C."}

The corner steakhouse is luxurious, yet not pretentious; cozy, yet comfortable. They make it look so easy to be classy. The dark wood accents can be a bit stuffy to some, but I didn't mind it.\nMr. Joy had made reservations for dinner. When we arrived, the host whisked us to a spacious booth. It looked like the entire dining room was decked out in leather booths.\n\nThey started us off with some good bread. The toasted slices were accompanied with a small ramekin filled to the brim with butter so soft it was like cream.\nMy martini was nice and strong. The rest of it was chilled in a little ice bucket.\n\n$15 Crab Cakes w/ Buerre Blanc:\nThey were okay. The shredded crab meat was crumbly and dry inside and the breading could have been more crunchy, but I guess that's what the buerre blanc was for. There was quite of bit of the buttery sauce. \n\n$46 Petite Filet Mignon 8 oz. w/ potato gratin:\nDelicious filet was cooked to a wonderful, juicy medium rare with beautiful grill marks on the outside, a little pink on the inside. My knife cut through it with ease. The soft, scalloped potatoes were buttery and cheesy.\n\n$53 Bone-in Ribeye w/ baked potato:\nMr. Joy's steak was amazing as well with the added benefit of the flavor of meat on the bone. The baked potato was enormous. The butter dissolved into the potato nicely, but beneath it, the potato was a little chalky. It was topped with a hefty amount of sour cream and chives.\n\nBoth plates were garnished with a little rosemary. Our seasonal vegetables were snap peas and some julienned carrots. Alright, not bad, but definitely added some much needed crunch in the meal.\n\n$9 Molten Chocolate Cake:\nMr. Joy said he was tired of bread pudding and I guess I order it very often, so we went with the molten chocolate cake. It was served with some ice cream (strawberry?) inside a wafer-thin cookie topped with a surfboard-looking piece of chocolate, and adorned with a sprig of mint. There was also a lit candle sitting in a dollop of whipped cream. I wish I had taken a shot of the gooey chocolate fudge inside the cake. It was yummy!\n\nHarris' is a great classic steakhouse in my opinion. If I ever return, I'd go for the Japanese ribeye. After your meal, if you're feeling a little sad it's over, you can purchase a nice cut of meat, or two, from the butcher shop on your way out.", "author": "Joy W."}

The ambiance in the restaurant is decidedly old school: big leather booths, potted plants, and large mural-like classical paintings adorning the walls.  Service here is impressive and impeccable, I will certainly admit, but where Harris falls short is on their speciality: steak. After a rather small and unimpressive iceberg wedge salad, my Harris Steak ($60) was lacking flavor and incredibly dry for medium rare. No seasoning or any real distinctive flavor. I was expecting something as succulent and delicious as Ruth Chris or John's Grill, both in SF, the former on Van Ness Avenue as well, but this was not the case. Sides were good, however. My baked potato was delicious and chock full of all the required toppings and the vegetables mix (snow peas) were delightfully prepared in a wonderful light oil giving them a wonderful texture and crunch.  To Harris' credit, they did serve me a tasty complimentary slice of coconut and lemon cake with a candle to celebrate my special day.", "author": "Kenneth P."}

This place is like the old classy grandpa of steakhouses (you know the type.. classy older gentleman with spectacles, pipe, mustache, and quick witted sense of humor).\nThey have the old-timey classic steakhouse feel and the classic dishes of the past, but they provide a modern take on both their ambiance and their dishes. I like that there is a wider selection on the menu, with many appetizers, entrees, and cuts of steak to choose from so everyone can get the experience they're looking for. They know how to cook each cut of meat perfectly. We tried both the filet and the ribeye and both were cooked exactly to our liking. You can tell that they strive to find the best beef and know exactly how to cut and cook it.

The bar had live jazz which was a great touch. Finished a few drinks and checked back in at 8:30pm and 'our table was being closed out and cleared'. Our table wasn't actually ready until 9:15pm.. pretty lame as we just sat and waited as an estimate of the time was way off. we could have been at the bar enjoying a few more drinks. \n\nAfter we sat down we were brought some appetizers on the house for our wait which was nice. The smoked salmon with bread was pretty standard, nothing amazing. I opted to get the rib eye with foie gras on top with the sauce. The steak itself was good but not $60 good as other steak houses I've been too. It was tender but not exceptionally tender. The sauce that came with it really took away from the flavor of the steak which was disappointing.

Filet mignon was so soft and perfect to taste, not too salty nor bland. It was so good that my bf wanted to eat mine instead of his! It wasn't that the 49er cut wasn't tasty but it wasn't as soft as the filet mignon.

The ambience hits as you're approaching the restaurant with the chunks of aging meat featured in the windows. You're going to eat a whole lot of meat. \n\nFor a party of six, we ordered the Australian Wagyu ($90), Porterhouse ($64), Executive Cut Prime Rib ($57), Filet Mignon Rossini (around $60? I forget), some asparagus, some mushrooms, lobster bisque all around, eagle manhattans, and Aloha baked Alaska for dessert. \n\nFor reference, this was too much food for us to handle, maybe a 1:2 steak to party ratio would have been a better route. Also for reference, though we didn't get it but might be useful to someone, the whole lobster and clams was $77 for our evening.\n\nWe asked for medium rare across the board, but every steak came slightly over. This is disappointing when you know you just ordered a $500 meal that you're not going to expense. In all honesty, the Porterhouse won't be ordered again if we're back and the prime rib wasn't exactly special either. The filet mignon rossini and the wagyu, though, were good. Foie gras pairs really well with the filet mignon and is definitely worth a try. \n\nThe wagyu is a really nicely done steak, and it does do special things to your taste buds when you eat it. That said, I still have a hard time wrapping my head around how much it is distinguished from a $20 at-home steak with a nice recipe. \n\nSurprisingly, the Aloha baked Alaska was superb and by far the most exciting part of the meal. It is a truly unique dessert that tops off the experience and a must-try.\n\nLastly, we sat in the large hall to the left of the entrance, away from the live music in the prettier room. If you can get near the live music, it will undoubtedly enhance your night. When conversations start rolling where we ate, you quickly forget live music exists which is a bummer.", "author": "Mo B."}

We were celebrating my fathers 60th bday and excited to take him to a nice steakhouse. Walking in, the hosts were great, service for our drinks, etc was awesome. \n\nOnce we were at our table, the service staff failed to fill any empty glass...when you pay $70-80 bucks for a bottle of wine, you'd think the staff would help to fill it up, we did it all ourselves. The appetizers were great, no complaints there. Dinner--we had four people (out of 6) order steak and sides. The steak was overdone. And when we asked our server, Adam, about the specific order of the steak (rare, medium, etc) , he asked all of us to \"cut into the middle and see if it's medium rare\". Ummm, we just paid $60 plus dollars for a steak, and its not cooked right, don't ask us to cut into it and show you that it's not. Sorry, just not cool. We just wanted what we ordered, which didn't happen. Additionally, we ordered onion rings for the table that were served cold and had to send those back also (onion rings should come hot, right?). That said, my dish (salmon) was delicious, especially that mashed potatoes on the side. Post dinner, the staff delivered a beautiful plate with a cupcake and ice cream that said \"happy birthday Charlie\" on the plate--awesome! But it came with no additional plates, forks, etc and when we asked Adam for some forks, he replied \"it's a cupcake\". My bad, I thought the table might want to share the cupcake with utensils. Sorry if that seems high maintenance, but any other restaurant would offer at LEAST forks so everyone could share. \n\nThis is my third YELP review, I rarely do it. I wanted something special for my dad's 60th bday.  Given the price tag of the menu and history, one would expect excellent service and excellent food. Instead we had to show our \"overcooked\" meat to the server by cutting into the pieces in front of him in order to get what we ordered while having to fill our wine glasses ourselves.\n\nCall this a \"Wahhhhhhh\" first world problem, but this place definitely doesn't provide the service, food, etc with the price tag. I'd would've rather spent my dad's 60th at a hipster place in the mission or somewhere else trendy where they at least acknowledge your empty glass, scrape your crumbs off the table and are given utensils for the birthday treat. \n\nMaybe Harris was the hot spot 15 years ago.

Why the heck did he bother to ask how our meal was if he wasn't going to follow thru? \n\nOther than that, the broiled rib eye steak and veal chop were done to perfection.

Yes, the parking sucks and the place probably hasn't changed its decor significantly since the mid-80s, but you're here for the best steak you can get, great drinks, and great service and they deliver on that on every level.  \n\nTwo recommendations in particular, first, suck it up and get the Porterhouse.  You probably shouldn't and you certainly don't need to, but it's incredible every time.  Just make sure you get it medium-rare otherwise, and to quote Robert De Niro from Raging Bull, the steak really defeats its own purpose if you overcook it.\n\nSecond, bearnise sauce.  I think most steakhouses, even good ones, put this on the menu because they think they should but they don't take the real time and attention bearnise sauce needs to be truly fantastic.

We both got scalloped potatoes and my plate came with creamed spinach while his came with snap peas (extra sides were $5).\n\nWe walked out feeling full but I would not go back at this price.", "author": "Yi Z."}

Even on a weekday. This place was a memorable place for me.\nFast forward to early October 2017\nI decide to make a reservation for the boyfriend's (Kyle's) birthday. It's during the week so I figure, it shouldn't be too busy. The reservation was the most painless part. \n\nChecking in with our hostess, and I immediately notice the demographic has changed. The volume of patrons is higher... the allure is a little less so. Once we are seated I begin to take in my surroundings. I am overdressed, but not too uncomfortable as I am fairly accustomed to dressing for show, not necessarily warmth or comfort. \nIt's a booth for two near the back of the restaurant. The party next to us seem older, white, comfortable. Maybe they've been here a while. I also notice that one of the gentleman's jacket is strewn over and into our booth. Against the back of my seat...\nI sit up & nearer to my left, and toward the front of the table. I tell myself this is fine. It was not fine. Not my waiter nor, the offending jacket monster's, (cannot recall or even noticed if it was the same waiter/gentleman) said a thing about it. Whether or not to say something about my figurative pea in my mattress became a waging war in my head. I lost. Coat check people, it works. \n\nFood, the same! To my immense pleasure it was as good as I remember. My medium rare petite filet was perfect. As were the sides. The old ball and chain loved his food. We ordered dessert, also amazing... and a coffee with a little something extra in it (the selection is sure to please the most picky of palates... just pick one.) Trust me. You will need something to put a little pep in your step, and make it into something more \"comfortable\" later on.\n\nAmbiance has its charm. It is still very Mad Men. Very dapper. One or two of the lightening fixtures may need a little aligning in some areas to match all the others, but hey... overall it's aged perfectly. And no body is perfect. Some frames also may or may not have been knocked askew... I almost want to blame the drunk and boisterous techie crew that come in larger groups and over the course of dinner, may or may not be less aware of their surroundings. I noticed, I would not be surprised if other were not. \n\nOur waiter was friendly and attentive albeit a little MIA... there were so many people clearing away dishes, filling our water glass... it all became blurry. I understand it's busy... but had to do the stealth eye contact, little nod trick. To make things clearer, I am 90lbs soaking wet, and 5'2\" I do not blame anyone who does not pick up on my subtleties that much. But I think it rude to hold a hand up, yell \"check!\" Etc. \n\nI just wanted the magic. I wanted him to have the meals and memories and I have had here.... it was a little different.\nOverall, I was a little disappointed. But happy to introduce him to someplace new. Even if it were not the fairy tale I remember. We all gotta grow up.", "author": "Paulina C."}

It was tender, it was prime, but to me at least, it didn't have that taste of mineral that one finds in the very best meat.  And the baked potato and green beans that came with my ribeye steak were nice enough, but not better than one would be served at any number of less expensive restaurants.\n  \nA final comment would be that I asked for my steak to be cooked to medium.

We had a reservation for 6:30pm so we rushed through SF traffic and barely made it on time to the restaurant. We pulled up to the front of the restaurant for the valet service ($10 + tip) and were met by two gentlemen who were beyond polite. After I had entered the restaurant, one of the valets had noticed my wallet in the car and had come into the restaurant to notify me. That surprised me a bit and made me like this restaurant even more.   \n\nAt the host table, we were greeted by a gentleman who quickly seated us and showed us the menus. Our server Devon came by soon afterward to take down our orders. They started us off with some bread, butter, and some sort of spread. I could not put my hands on what the spread was, but it was quite delicious with subtle flavors. \n\nI ordered the executive cut of the Prime Rib (medium rare) w/ scalloped potatoes and creamed spinach. The outskirts of the prime rib were more thoroughly cooked and seasoned, while the center was fairly pink and tender. I remember sticking my fork in the prime rib and it went straight through with ease... it was that tender. As far as the sides go, the creamed spinach was amazing while the scalloped potatoes were somewhat standard. My girlfriend ordered the Steak Diane (medium rare) w/ baked potatoes. The steak was drenched in some sort of glaze sauce that had great flavor, but it wasn't overpowering.  \n\nThe only thing that I could complain about this restaurant was that the table was a bit small (I'm nitpicking at this point). The booth that they sat us at had enough seating room for two, but it would get cluttered at times. The table got packed with the bread plates, water glass, and wine glass, but after they cleared the table for the main course, there was more than enough room. \n\nWhen I looked around, I noticed that my girlfriend and I were probably the youngest people there. Everyone seemed to be in their mid 30's and up... I guess the high price point drove away all the broke youngsters. \n\nI must say that I am thoroughly impressed with this place. The service, food, and atmosphere was great. I am usually a hater when it comes to fancy restaurants because they try to sell you hype instead of good food, but this place did not skimp in any category.

I had much better one at Morton's or somewhere else.\nMy husband ordered filet mignon Rossini, medium, but it turned out to be almost rare, so he only ate 1/4. He should've returned it and asked to have it cooked longer, but our server did not come back to ask if our meal was ok or anything, so we just let it go.

After one year, you are able to maintain my most prestigious 4 star rating for your food and service.  My children will go without shoes this year, but I will have had another kobe steak... and it is good!\n\nJim and I had a different waiter this year.  Did the other read my last review and drop his career to go into broadcasting or become a prizefighter?  These are the things I considered as I sucked down that onion martini... which in my opinion was not very good.  Mental note: stick with the traditional martini and you will be okay.\n\nSince I didn't see Jim for a year, I didn't want to be bothered by the waiter.  I needed to know who got fired, who is doing well and who is on the skids.  The waiter was perfect!  He was almost invisible.  Occasionally I'd see an arm pouring more wine or hear a small voice asking if I wanted something, but if I had to pick him out of a police lineup I'd be of no use.  I appreciate a waiter who senses the mood of the client - as in \"my dinner partner is so damn boring, can you entertain me?\" or \"my dinner partner is interesting, don't bother me\".  Jim was entertaining and interesting so all the waiter had to do was bring the alcohol and chow.\n\nI brought a nice bottle of Syrah that I \"discovered\" in Geyserville last spring and paid a $30 fee to have them pop the cork.  It tasted better in Geyserville and I will buy my wine from Harris next year.  I don't think I'm at all good about selecting proper wines unless we are eating a dinner of cheese.\n\nHarris was packed out on a Thursday evening.  I was surprised.  I kept thinking about all those children out there running around with no shoes while their parents enjoyed a nice meal.  Children who sacrifice for their parent are virtuous; learning the value of being longsuffering.\n\nSusan Chen is still playing the piano.  I remember her from several years back when Jim and I first started eating there.  I love it when she sing \"Slow Boat to China\".  I had to walk into the bar and see her.   She was in the middle of some smooth Jazz with her head at a slight tilt and a satisfied smile on her face - eye closed.  She was in a zone - in love with the music and her big friend the piano.  I wish I could have sat and enjoyed her music and a few after dinner drinks but I was the designated driver to take me home.

Between the over priced sides, not the best quality of food and not the kind of service you should be finding at a $$$$ restaurant, you can do better in a city like SF.\n\nAmbiance - that old school, New York steakhouse vibe. A few private rooms, a bar area with live music and a dining room. We opted for the bar.\n\nFood - the steaks at about $50-$60 were good. Was it legendary steakhouse territory? No and at those prices, it should be. They were salty and cooked well and oh so buttery. However, they were tiny for the price. The potato side? The man opted for au gratin at the recommendation of the server. A 3 inch by 3 inch potato au gratin? 3 bites. A little stingy if you ask me when you just dropped a minimum of $50. The other sides ordered were equally overrated. The onion rings were not at all impressive so much so that we needed to request a side of ranch (and what? No dipping sauce included?). The lobster mac and cheese for $36 was far from memorable. Soupy and bland with small slivers of lobster.\n\nOur service: very nice. However, water was asked for multiple times, we had to pretty much pour our own wine and overall non-existent service. We get it, it's the end of the night, but when you're dropping $100 per person, you expect a little something no matter whether it be 5pm or 10pm.\n\nI've been to iconic steakhouses like Peter Luger's, Keens in NYC and even House of Prime Rib right here in SF and I gotta say, those are really wonderful experiences. You leave feeling like a king (or queen) and Harris' fell short not only on the service side, but food wise as well. If jonesing for a steak, I could see why Harris' would be a stop on your journey. It is an old school steakhouse. However, if you're looking for a really great culinary experience? You can find better.", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

Did they make the steaks and leave them sitting under red light? \n\nMy biggest complaint was our bitchy inattentive server. Once she realized that only 1 out of 4 of us were going to keep drinking, she never came to ask us how we were, offer us bread, ask if we wanted other/more drinks, bring water, clear plates or hand us dessert menus...  it really made for an uncomfortable moment when you want to say something but don't want to ruin everyone's evening. She wasn't that busy and passed our table repeatedly, however, never acknowledging us. \n\nNext, why is there a dress code when they don't enforce it? We came appropriately dressed, were well behaved, keeping our volume down and cognizant of others trying to enjoy their meal. They sat a group of kids in the booth next to us. There must have been 8-10 of them. They were rowdy, noisy, fidgety, spilling out of the booth. At one point they brought extra chairs to \"extend\" the table into the walkway. They were so close to the table across the way that they were fist-bumping the other guests. \n\nThis isn't the service I expected to from Harris' and was definitely disappointed.

Of course the wine was excellent but the waiter didn't think I was funny and just kept quiet with a look of distain on his face. Lighten up people.

The service was pretty good and for a steakhouse, the prices were not high at all. I tried the foie gras appetizer and the prime rib for my entree. The foie gras was pretty good...nothing to complain about. It was melt in your mouth soft and had a super rich taste. The poached egg was a great addition to top it off. \nThe prime rib was meh. It was honestly the driest prime rib I have ever had. I got it medium rare and yet...super dry. Even with the au jus, it was on the verge of inedible. The flavor was pretty good on it...but the dryness just ruined it for me. Maybe it was a bad day? I don't know, but I have a feeling I should have ordered a filet mignon or a different cut. The prime rib was $55 I believe so not too bad. \nFor dessert, I tried the mint chip baked alaska. It was unique...mint chip ice cream on a chocolate cake covered in a tasted marshmallow. Pretty good!\n\nOverall, it was an alright experience. Our waiter was super nice and attentive without being too attentive. The service was surprisingly fast...maybe it was because we came at 5:30, so it was a bit before the dinner rush. However, the food was disappointing. It wasn't bad but for a 'high end' steakhouse, it was not worth it. I would still pay two or three times more for Alexander's steakhouse anyday.", "author": "Kristine L."}

Dress well, remember your table manners (some diners don't) and allow the exquisitely-timed servers, assistants and sommelier to make your evening perfect.  I have been dining here for 21 years and there is not a dish served that is not delicious.  Their lamb chops include a dazzling dipping sauce the likes of which I have never experienced. Really--mint jelly be gone and is not welcome here!  \n\nThey all know me as the woman who asks for the Champagne rice with the fabulous tiny chopped chives on top.   Their Steak Diane is worthy of the definition--truly a masterpiece.  Their Executive Cut Prime Rib should have been served to William the Conqueror or at least as a prop in the Errol Flynn masterpiece \"Robin Hood\".  Order an Arns Cabernet and you will simply have a meal from heaven.   I am astonished at the poorly dressed patrons from time to time, but everyone is treated with grace and excellent service.  A long-appreciated jazz trio quietly entertains nightly.   Years ago, I was complimented on this site for describing the Harris'  baked potatoes as \"little zeppelins\"--well, they still are an anticipated part of the evening's meal.

Unfortunately, I left slightly disappointed.\n-------------------------------------------\nFood-\nSTEAK TARTARE: Pretty good. This was a solid appetizer n i enjoyed it but nothing earth shattering though.\n\nCRAB CAKES: Crab cakes were very good, but I mean I have yet to see anybody REALLY screw up crab cakes. \n\nBONE-IN RIBEYE: Alright! So this is the review we actually care about....The flavor was there and the juices were there, but overall the texture was very chewy. I feel Ive had better meat quality at other steakhouses for sure. Not to say the meat quality was crap, but u could feel that it was a slight step down. I dont think the fat was marbled/distributed evenly, and I had quite a few chunks of fat that I couldnt eat. Also, when I was first eating it, I totally thought the guy had overcooked it for sure. I asked for medium rare, but it tasted like medium 2/3 of the steak until I got fairly deep inside.\n\nDesserts-\nAloha baked Alaska: Probably one of the most unique desserts ive had. It kinda remind of a fried marshmallow cept with slight pineapple flavor.\n\nBlueberry bread pudding: Not bad nuthin too crazy\n\nChocolate Graham Cracker Cheesecake: Too chocolaty for my taste. Woulda preferred more cheesecake flavor. I guess thats preference tho. \n----------------------------------------------------\nI think each steak was on avg $50, but at this price point im sure u no longer care about the price and the flavor has to meet the $50 price point. So while the steak was good, I cant REALLY say it was on that level for me.\n\nOverall, I feel the food was good but not great and like some ppl say, at this price point its gotta be great. If i ever come back, maybe ill try the prime rib instead.\n\nNote: This restaurant is very basic/traditional. Quite a few old ppl.\nNote2: They have rules on what you wear so dont be too casual.", "author": "Frank L."}

We try to go to a different fancy steakhouse for special occasions. Parking was a bit difficult to find so we drove around for a bit until we found free street parking. I would have valet it but I didn't have any cash on me. It's $13 flat rate for valet. \n\nWe were seated right in front near the reception desk. It was a small booth for 2. The setting of the restaurant was very intimate and romantic. They actually use real candles for their tables instead of the little battery operated one.\n\nThey give you complimentary crostinis and butter. They also give you complimentary bread as well. We didn't receive any at first so we didn't even know about it until we saw the bread guy walk to the table next to us and served them some. He looked directly at our table and decided to not give us any and walked away. We received some later when our waitress asked if we wanted any more crostinis and bread.\n\nFor starters, we ordered the half dozen raw oysters. It comes with three different sauces for it. Raw oysters were delicious as usual.\n\nFor our main entree, he ordered the american waygu and I ordered one of the specials of the night called tournedos, which was 2 petite 4oz filet mignons. I forgot what the sauce was called but it had mushrooms in it. Both of our entrees came with two sides. We picked that evenings potatoes, scalloped potatoes, and asparagus. Both steaks were cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. It was so juicy.\n\nSince it was my boyfriend's birthday, they brought our a complimentary dessert. It resembled an ice cream oreo. It took them about 15-20 minutes to bring out the dessert after cleaning our table which was a bit ridiculous. \n\nWe also ordered 2 cocktails. So for 1 app, 2 entrees, and 2 drinks, the total came out to be about $200. It is on the pricey side, so I'd recommend coming her for special occasions only.\n\nOverall, service was great but it wasn't above and beyond.

Gonna order the Japanese Kobe (around $200) one day, but scared I'd completely ruin meat forever if I do...\n\nWent again recently and this time was more sensible and ordered a regular steak.  While it was delicious, it was not wagyu. :( Nothing is, nor will be.  The salads were fresh, crispy, and tasty.  Acme bread is always a favorite so don't skip on it thinking you want to save room.

I've eaten at many meat-focused restaurants that have had incredible vegetarian dishes either on their menu or made on the spot by the chef. This was a planned dinner, and the restaurant was aware that there were a number of vegetarians in attendance. The mushroom ragout appetizer was pretty good, not great but pretty good. The bread was DIVINE but definitely not baked in house, and the butter was delicious. And that's where the good food ended, with the bread. The entree came, and it was literally a bunch of side dishes thrown on a plate. Zero protein, no seasoning, no flavor. The broccoli was bland. The asparagus looked boiled (how hard is it to roast, grill or do anything but boil it? And don't meat eaters like good sides??). The creamed spinach tasted like it was frozen and reheated. The potatoes had been sitting for (likely) hours, once crispy and flavorful and now limp and soggy. Granted, if you're vegetarian and looking for a good dinner you're not going to go to a steakhouse but if someone in your party is vegetarian, DO NOT COME HERE unless you want them to leave hungry. We left the party and went a block over to Lord Stanley (also not a vegetarian restaurant) and had an amazing meal, one of the best in my life.

Tasted a little weirdly sour.\n\nSpinach salad- this salad was so bland and felt like it was lacking something. \n\nCaesar salad- I don't think it's that hard to get Caesar salad right, but Harris just didn't do it for me. I think it was the dressing that just didn't taste great. I also didn't really like the anchovies that were served with this. \n\nEntrees:\n\nBone in Ribeye Steak- lacked flavor and wasn't warm enough. My guess is that they made this first and it sat there a while before they brought it out. I personally didn't like the horseradish served with the steak, but my boyfriend thought the horseradish was good. They did a good job of cooking it medium rare. It was seared on the outside, but still rare on the inside, so they get points for that. \n\nHarris Steak- I liked this one more than the ribeye, but it was still just average. It had a little more flavor and was tender but didn't impress me. \n\nLobster and clams- Ironically this was probably the best thing I ate last night. They served the whole lobster in the shell and it was HUGE! It was slightly overcooked though, but it was still tasty. Clams were also good. \n\nIn conclusion, I will not be going back.

Walking up to the entrance there's a ton of porterhouse steaks being dry aged right through the front windows.  When entering the restaurant it reminded me of the classic steakhouses in New York with the bar area right in front.  Then the dim lighting, old booth styled seating, and dark wood everywhere.  And of course they have the dress code which is business casual like collared shirt and slacks.  No, the \"I only look illegal\" t-shirts are not allowed in this establishment.\n\nI really liked the selection of steaks on the menu.  I saw the whole Maine Lobster at the table next to me and it looked amazing.  Harris also has American, Australian, and authentic Japanese Wagyu steaks on the menu.  But after debating with myself on either the 24oz dry aged porterhouse or the 16oz Australian Wagyu, I chose the latter.  \n\nAustralian Wagyu:  when I hear the word wagyu I expected tasty fat. A nice meaty flavor along with that.  The Australian Wagyu delivered as expected.  But I was asked if it was the best steak I've ever had.  I would say it is definitely in the top 10 but it wasn't good enough for me to say that it's ruined me to wanting other steaks, the wagyu was just unique. \n\nSteak Diane:  my wife ended up ordering this filet mignon which has a cognac based sauce over it.

We arrived for our reservation, sat down and we were immediately greeted for cocktails (good start). We needed a moment to look over the drink menu but asked for water. 15 minutes later, the waitress (Amy) took our drink order and we asked for water again. Still didn't have water or drinks after 20 minutes. We finally asked a nice lady who brought us bread (I think she was the manager) to bring us water and she brought us water within minutes. \n\nOur waitress (Amy)  finally came around some time later to take our order. We ordered a bottle of wine as well as our meals (which they didn't have, which was fine- we get it) so we ordered another. \n\nThe food was great. Very traditional steakhouse. However, the service was worse than McDonald's. \n\nOur waitress was not only rude,but she only came by a few times and we watched her converse with \"friends\" that came in, every few minutes.  Most of her tables were served their first course before we got our water from someone else. We had 4 people and paid over 400 dollars for a less than mediocre experience. As we were walking out, we told the gentleman at the hostess stand we were disappointed with our service and he was rude enough to say \"well, that is unfortunate\" without even looking up from his computer. It was by far the worst service we have ever had at a restaurant. \n\nI would be very ashamed of my employees if this was my restaurant and we will not be returning nor will we ever recommend this to anyone.", "author": "Kelsey K."}

Not because they're vegetarians - they just don't like steak. Weird. But we can talk about that some other time...\n\nI LOVE A GOOD STEAK. And I love a good, old-school authentic steak house. Morton's is good, but nothing special (anymore). Ruth's Chris has good steaks. Both are perfectly decent, but at the end of the day, they feel like chains. Harris' is family owned, and it just feels more 'authentic' - whatever that means. Have spoken to many of the servers and bartenders, and a good handful of them have been there for years! It shows in the quality of service. \n\nI come often with friends and try to sit in the bar area as it feels more intimate and casual *and* I have come a time or three in shorts, so the bar area is just more comfortable. I do not know how often they have live music in the bar, but it is special when they do - just quiet, lounge-y music appropriate for the venue.\n\nIt's also fun to sit at the bar if you're dining on your own. Love striking up conversations with the bartenders - Robert, David, Freddy, all lovely - and with the other single diners. Have met so many interesting people: a young quirky women who *insisted* I sample her sweetbreads (I did!), and a beautiful women in her 80s who was flirting with me, and I suppose I was flirting with her too...\n\nHighlights:\n\nDrinks - I go back and forth between a straight vodka martini (Ketel One) or a Manhattan (bartender's choice). Hard to mess up, but still good and classic. Re: wine, the bartenders and servers know the menu, and make great recommendations. \n\nMy go-to salad is *always* the iceberg wedge. Probably the best wedge I have ever had. They'll happily split it if you're with a date.\n\nGreat starters are anything foie gras, which lately has been coming in a chilled or a seared version. I have enjoyed both. The sweetbreads are listed as a starter, but it's really big enough for a main - or split it. The steak tartar is listed as a starter too, but again, probably more of a main. The steak tartar is the only thing here that has ever disappointed me - it's forgettable at best. \n\nI almost always get The Harris Steak, a 16oz bone-on New York strip. Amazing. I have never sent a steak back to the kitchen for being over-cooked - they get 'medium rare' every time. For just a little more, they'll put some seared foie gras on the steak. Indulgent.\n\nSides are standard (high-quality) steakhouse fare: spinach, cream spinach, mashed or scalloped potatoes (I always get the latter), broccoli, mushrooms, saut\u00e9ed onions, and three options for sauces (I like the truffled madeira). \n\nI have never done the prime rib (not my thing) or wagyu (pricey!) but have heard good things.\n \nTop notch service, and just a great vibe. You'll feel as if you're in another era (especially if the jazz if playing in the lounge).", "author": "Corey M."}

Very tender and juicy. The scalloped potatoes were delicious! Soft and creamy.\n\nBaked Alaska - This dessert was what really wowed me. :) Presentation was very beautiful. I'm used to Baked Alaskas with just plain vanilla ice cream, but here at Harris, they served it with chocolate mint ice cream. Perfect way to end the night. So delicious and refreshing.  \n\nI noticed that the diners were more of an older crowd as we felt like we were the youngest that night. Nonetheless, that didn't stop us from having a good time.

The ma\u00eetre d, Scott sat us at a beautiful table and asked if we'd like drinks to start. \n\nIce water was immediately brought out for us plus some amazing sourdough bread with soft butter and a cheddar cream cheese spread. I'm actually not a big fan of bread (I would never ask for it) because I like to enjoy everything I'm paying for, but I couldn't stop. \n\nThe cocktail service was amazing to me. I had a belvedere dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives and the boys had eagle rare rye manhattans. I was debating between the Moscow mule and a dirty martini, but when they said they had blue cheese stuffed olives I was sold on my traditional martini. They bring out the martini glasses and place them in front of you and then have the cocktail in a carafe ice bowl. They pour your cocktail and leave the rest on ice. I loved it. You don't have to chug your martini for it to stay cold. Very nice presentation. \n\nFor the table to share we had the steak tartare. Absolutely fabulous with the grilled cristini. Don't remember the specifics but definitely something to try and enjoy. \n\nFor the 2nd, the bf and I split the wedge salad. The dressing was ranch with chives and iceberg lettuce. It wasn't my favorite wedge ever but I still ate every bite. The onion soup was the best I've ever had! I was told that it's not the same thing as French onion because it doesn't have all the cheese and bread, just the onions and broth. Well let me tell you, you don't need all the carbs in it to enjoy it. We asked for the filets to come out whenever ready because we didn't want to be \"those people\". I still had my soup and salad in front of me when they came out because I couldn't bare to give them up! \n\nThe filet was cooked perfectly how we asked for. We did the one au poivre style with the peppercorns and peppercorn sauce. It was amazing and came with the best au gratin potatoes and snap peas. I couldn't manage to finish all my filet so I actually wrapped the small piece left in tin foil because I saw a homeless puppy around the corner and wanted to feed him. Let's just say he was one happy little guy! \n\nFor wine,we had the valpocella ripossa. I believe it was $51. We usually spend more on wine for dinner but I love my valpocella and amarones. It was nice full body, the tannins weren't heavy and had a great flavor.  Definitely very happy with the wine. \n\nBare with me for the dessert because I don't remember the specifics. I was too busy putting it in my mouth because it was the best dessert I've ever had. I believe it was a chocolate chiffon cake with mint chocolate ice cream and topped with a toasted meringue. Beautiful presentation and it tasted even better. \n\nOur server Paula was great. Very knowledgeable and friendly. She made the experience even better than we expected. \n\nOverall, this is a must go to restaurant.  Will definitely be back when we visit San Fran.", "author": "Andrea S."}

Other challengers have emerged over the years, and some of them are excellent as well, but I don't think the consistency of Harris' classical approach can be topped.\n\nThe dimly-lit dining room has an 'old school' classy feeling- nothing modern or contemporary about it.  Rows of beef line the windows, and there is a beef counter inside where you can pick your raw cuts up to go and cook at home. The steaks are executed flawlessly, and the sides are always generous.  Filet mignon is usually my selection, although my most recent meal was the 'American Wagyu'- and it was fabulous!\n\nThere isn't much more to say about Harris'.  Everything is great, there is no mistake when you order here. There is no doubt a price to pay for a stellar steak meal, here or at the competitors places.  However my confidence in the excellence of execution of Harris' is sky-high, and I have never been disappointed.  See you again when the steak fix needs a cure!", "author": "Andy S."}

One in our group couldn't make it, still no problem. Seated immediately; very nice ambience. They made suggestions and answered any questions we had (I think our server was Paula) excellent all around.

Had dinner tonight with 3 friends and ordered in our usual way. The server was attentive and gave great input as to the various cuts. Took our order, returned with out sparkling water and our chosen Cab...\n\nI re-affirmed... Rear, more like seared... \"No problem...\"\n\nThen the debacle started... The first bone in rib-eye was medium... I cut in various locations and \"yup\", it's pink... Medium. Waited 6 minutes to catch our servers attention, he apologized and acknowledged the steak was over cooked. He asked me to slice the middle, and yes... It was over cooked. What a waste of a great piece of meat... Even the seared fois gras topping was screaming eat me, before they take me away...\n\nRound two!!! I cut in various places again and I was in disbelief... Again, wasted piece of meat... When you poke it, and look at it, you can tell... I was hoping for more, since the chefs here deal with incredible meat all day. It was so evident that my dinner buddy to my right looked at my rib eye and said that if that was rare, he should have asked for \"raw\", since he had to send back his over cooked steak as well.  I was more bummed at the second sliver of fois gras screening at me to take a bite before it was time to say bye... I was bummed... It was a pretty good size slice. The server came by to check in and saw that my steak was not eaten and again asked me to slice the middle... Again he apologized and said it was better, but over-done... No, it was not better, it was disappointing that they ruined another great piece of meat...\n\nThe third pice came out and was what the first one should have been... I took a small slice of the now \"tiny\" sliver of fois gras (guess they were hedging their bets as to this one being sent back too). The rib eye was tasty, but by now my enthusiasm had subsided and was actually full from the wine, bread and sliced croutons... I had them pack it up so I could eat it for lunch...\n\nThe server was apologetic, but the luster on the place had faded and it had become another forgetful experience, and even less memorable food... Will I come back soon, probably not... There are to many other great options for steak, beef a few blocks up...\n\nWant to know what the closer on this night was? When I got home, my son had just finished club volleyball practice and was starving, so I offered him my dinner, I opened it to warm it for him and noticed that when the buser packed my food, he left out my prized fois gras...\n\nBoy...

The steaks however, weren't as good as I thought they would be. Maybe something with the taste of meat as it's aged, but I thought the porterhouse tasted a little off. I've had aged steaks elsewhere and loved them so I'm not sure if l just didn't prefer their aged flavor.

I drove by around 0300PM and there was a line around the block waiting for the doors to open at 330.  I had a 0400PM reservation for my family and when we arrived at the restaurant the bar and dining rooms were filled nearly to capacity.  The packed-house vibe made for a festive Thanksgiving meal.\n\nThe prixe-fixe Thanksgiving meal consisted of a choice of salad followed by a main course of turkey, stuffing, mashed sweet potatoes and saut\u00e9ed snap peas.  Dessert offered a choice of pecan or pumpkin pie.  My wife and son opted for the Thanksgiving meal.  I sampled a bit of their meals and I must say it was quite delicious.\n\nI opted for the bone-in ribeye with the standard potato and vegetable accompaniment. I've had so many mediocre turkey dinners on past Thanksgivings that I normally opt for something different if given the choice.  The steak was beautifully prepared and delicious.\n\nI highly recommend the Thanksgiving dinner here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-11", "description": "Harris' is a really nice restaurant! They have a more causal side as well as a more fancy side. Though both sides were similar to me other than the fancy side was more roomy and quieter than the casual side.\n\nThe service was very nice, friendly, informative and overall personable. I definitely enjoyed my experienced better because my server and all other servers were kind and attentive.\n\nWe ordered the special steamed mussels to share for our appetizer. Those mussels were so fresh, tasty, and very juicy. They steamed it just right as to not dry it out and shrink it's size. I dipped my break into the light and flavorful sauce. I am recommending everyone to do this as well!\n\nI ordered the filet mignon and lobster which came with a size of mash potatoes and snap peas. You have a choice between a baked potato or mash potatoes but the mash was just so creamy and amazing that I would order it again. The snap peas were cooked just right so it was very crunchy and had a sweet aftertaste. The filet mignon was ordered medium but I'm pretty sure it was medium rare. It was quite dim in the dining room but I could see the blood running from my steak. Although it was cooked less than I wanted, it was still amazing. The filet mignon melted in my mouth like buttery goodness. The lobster can be served whole or cut and I asked for i to be cut. I'm sure the whole lobster would've made the dish more presentable but it also would've been much more messier to eat. You miss out on the tasty guts when you ask for your lobster cut so the decision is all yours! The lobster was equally cooked to perfection. I could not imagine a more favorable lobster. Wish a side of drawn butter to dip, there is absolutely no way you could not enjoy how delectable the lobster was. \n\nMy love ordered the Australian wagyu ribeye medium rare with a side of mash potatoes and asparagus. The ribeye was so juicy and literally dripping of blood. I tried a piece and it was out of this world! My boyfriend loved how the ribeye just melts away. The ribeye was lightly salted and held onto all of it's meaty flavor. The mash was the same creamy goodness as mine. The asparagus was also cooked just right and still held it's crunch. \n\nWe ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms to enjoy with our steaks. The mushrooms were soft and juicy. They held onto the sauce juices very well and so it added a nice touch to our steaks.\n\nWe skipped the dessert menu but since it was my love's birthday, our server brought our a little cookie ice cream sandwich as a surprise for him. It was a cute and kind gesture and we really enjoyed the dessert.\n\nOverall, we had a great experience with the staff and the food! Needless to say, both our entrees were a large portion so we ended up boxing most of our food to go. The food was still very good the next day. We'll be back again!", "author": "Angela C."}

Yes, we're one of THOSE couples. \nThe boothang brought me here because he knew that I've been CRAVING prime rib for months since:\nHouse of Prime Rib: been there done that\n5A5: went for my birthday but ran out of prime rib\n\n..so I guess the next place to try was Harris' (:\n\nAfter we were seated and got our menus, we were served some warm, crunchy bread slices with butter and a dipping sauce (sorry I forgot what it was). \nAfter we ordered our food, we got the DELICIOUS, FRESH, HOT, AWESOME, BIG bread. It was some really good bread. Trust. \n\n-Soup of the Day ($9): it was lobster bisque so we HAD to get it. The portion was pretty big, to our surprise. WORTH IT. I'm not gonna lie, I was about half way full by the time I was done with this. It was pretty decent, but leaned towards the \"light\" side, flavor-wise. I was expecting BOOM, lobster in every scoop, but it was more of a subtle tap on the tongue. My descriptions aren't making sense anymore huh? LOL sorry ): Mr.Boothang did say that it didn't taste like Maine lobster though. Apparently it was very similar to the lobster he had in Santorini. \n\n-Roast Prime Rib (Regular Cut 14 oz $46, Executive Cut on the Bone 22oz $52) Comes with creamed spinach and your choice of baked potato or the evening's potato, which was mashed potato for us.\nI didn't feel like being a fatty that night, so I opted for the regular cut, and my boyfriend got the executive. If you're not EXTREMELY HUNGRY, having been starved for a few days, then just stick with the regular cut. When the executive was placed on the table, our eyes POPPED. \nI thought to myself \"heh, what can I do with a boyfriend suffering from food coma?\"\n  A) steal his wallet and run since he will be too full to run after me\n  B) steal his wallet and run since he will be too full to run after me\n                    or...\n  C) steal his wallet and run since he will be too full to run after me...\n\nBut jokes aside, the prime rib was pretty good. We both got it prepared rare, but it's more of a medium rare in my opinion, if it even matters to you. The meat was slightly tough, just a little bit. Served with au jus, every bite was pretty good. \nI think the House of Prime Rib still has the best prime rib, AND it's cheaper, but my boyfriend likes the prime rib at Harris' more. Is this a sign in our relationship, perhaps? haha jk \nThe two sides were great! The creamed spinach was very tasty mm mm mm. The mashed potatoes weren't anything special, but the one thing that stood out was its smoothness. Like a baby's bottom. \n     \nWe were WAY too full after our main course so we didn't order any desserts. We only managed to finish half of our food. But hey, that means PRIME RIB FOR LUNCH the next day :D\n\nWe did get a free mini cupcake as a gift for our year and a half anniversary though!

Who doesn't love these shows? At this restaurant you will have the pleasure to dine with a similar, more mature and senior crowd. If you are expecting hip, swave, classy and fresh steakhouse, with ambiance dripping down the walls. THIS IS NOT IT. \n\nI feel almost bad writing this review because the service is exceptional, and top notch. The service fast, and kind.. It is unfortunate the food does not compliment it's staff, and that is a true rarity.  I review based on service, food, pricing, and ambiance. If anyone gets a 4+, they have really knocked my socks off.\n\nI will start with the good first, and finish off with the bad, and the ugly.\n\nWine host. A+ . Although our first pick was sold out, the host, kindly came back and told us some other wines that were also in the \"pocket\". NICE. I had the up sell when you want a $100 bottle and they come back and suggest a $200, Like seriously? Kudos Harris.\n\nNext came the Crustinis, crunchy bread slices, flavored with cheese, and the SPECIAL Bordeaux cream cheese spread. Had we ended our dinner here, I would have rated this place 5 stars. The crustinis, the cream cheese, sweet at first taste, and ending with salty cheesy delight.. who can ask for more.. each bite was heaven. Yes, I am a cheese junkie.\n\nHere is where the dinner took a turn for the worst. I take a moment from finding my wine bliss, and observe the dining room. There is this tasteless mural of 3 panels which I kept staring at like a car accident, it was so out of place, that I could not look away!! When the entrees were served. Our dishes came out together, my the bone in NY (medium rare, towards the rare side), him he porterhouse (medium rare). I opted for the potato special of the day which was scalloped potatoes, him the baked potato. Everything looked ok before digging in, and I tried not to cringe when the offerings of sour cream and butter were made and a heaping heart attack portion was added to the bf's potato. *suggestion, try not to have such a heavy hand when adding butter and sour cream and all other heart attack condiments, the guests here can not take it!*. \n\nAnd here is where it gets.. ugly . First cut into the NY, Tough, and fat, I placed it to the side, in my junk pile, next slice, to the pile again, then I get into the meat, looked at the barely pink color, with no juices, I was going to put it into the junk pile too, then i dipped it in the butter, and decided to go for it. Chewing.. Chewing.. still chewing.. chewing still.. trying to bite through the grit of the veins.. the little bit of juice there was is now gone.. one last chew.. and yup.. going into the junk pile. Sigh.. The bf then feeds me a bit of his porterhouse which was much better, actually medium rare.. which was still a 3 star steak if that. I am able to eat about 40% of the steak if I chase each bite with the scalloped potatoes, which were decent, the star of my main dish platter. The snow peas, which were apparently the vegetable of the season were just doused in oil, and tossed on my plate. I ate 2 pcs before pushing them towards my junk pile. My junk pile is now consuming half of my plate, and here is where I start to get bitter. $52 seems to be a good deal for a steak dinner that is not a la cart, but with sides, until your entire entree becomes a junk pile. The steak was over cooked, lacked flavor and juices, had a ton of grit and veins, and was basically a disaster on a platter. I NEVER add extra salt, sauces etc to my steak and I had to add it to this tasteless carcass on my plate. After choking down what meat I could, and adding half chewed pieces to the junk pile, and discarding the rest. It was over. It was finally over...\n\nAnother thing on the ugly.. If you claim to be a 4 star steakhouse, and $$$$ venue. Try to class up the restaurant a little bit. The interior is so dated, and a little modernization has never hurt anyone. If you have signs telling your patrons the dress code, no shorts allowed , no t-shirts allowed, on 2 paper signs towards the entry, no using of cell phones in the dining area..  AND this is also printed on your menu...its time for a wake up call. You are NOT a 4 star restaurant. Especially when half the dining room, and bar area are wearing t-shirts, ripped jeans and hoodies.\n\nWe are on the search for the best steakhouse and will continue to seek elsewhere. So far NOTHING has come even close to Alexanders, the food, the service , the ambiance.. \n\nI might be back to get some details on their special cream cheese, but I will NOT be eating steak here again.", "author": "Sharon N."}

But our server was really friendly and recommended us to get the steamed clam marniere, which tasted pretty ordinary. The fresh oysters were good, but it requires no special cooking skills. We waited a while for our main entree to come out. I got the porterhouse steak with baked potato and bf got the bone-in rib eye with scalloped potatoes. Although the steak quality was good, both the steaks lacked flavor. I was really disappointed but I'd still like to give this place another try.", "author": "Joyce C."}

The place was extremely easy to find as I used to live in this neighborhood for many years. They are conveniently located on Van Ness at Pacific and easily accessible via public transportation as well. If you decide to drive, look for street parking unless you want to spring for valet parking. We were seated in one of the banquet rooms for a presentation. The venue was very intimate as there were only several tables arranged facing the speaker. \n\nFor starters we had a mixed green salad. This was pretty standard. They had several wine pairings and I chose the Cabernet. I picked the boneless prime rib as the main entree cooked medium rare. It was one of the most tender and juicy cuts of meats I have ever tasted. There was a good amount of marbling which made the beef tender. Along with the dish was a side of fresh vegetables consisting of snap peas, bell peppers, and mushrooms and potatoes Au gratin. For desert we had the chocolate moose which was a nice finishing item after dinner. \n\nDinner service was excellent. My glass was constantly full at all times and the waiters were very efficient doing their jobs. \n\nIf you ever come here for dinner, be sure to show up for the 7PM live Jazz performance. I was able to get a short preview of the performance coming in and out of the room. You'll have a good time listening to live music while enjoying your meal.", "author": "Tim G."}

My husband and I booked this reservation about a month in advance. Upon our on time arrival at 5:30PM, we are given two options: a booth at the main dining area or a table at the bar area. We ask for the booth. When we are walked through the dining area we pass 6 semicircle booths, 2 of which are vacant, however we are seated at a tiny booth for two, slightly outside the kitchen. My husband is 6'2 and I am 5'9 without heels, at the table it feels that we just arrived at a child's tea time. When we express our concerns to the host, we are immediately met with attitude, but the guy was wearing Prada loafers, so naturally he must be important. He told us that the two remaining booths are to be filled with larger parties, although the 4 occupied booths were all tables of 2. When I brought it to his attention and pointed out that there are more even larger booths vacant for bigger parties, the very important host told me that they will all be occupied by 6:30 and said that our only option was this or the bar area. We then proceeded to the bar, which is not bad, but definitely not what you want for a quite romantic dinner. The only saving grace to the night was our waiter Julio, who was attentive, professional and friendly. One of the best we've had in a long time! When we left at 7:20PM, I looked back in to the booth area and it was still half empty. Overall a disappointing experience.", "author": "Tasha B."}

We just finished an elegant dinner here to celebrate two birthdays: my mom's and my husband's. From start to finish, the entire experience was professional, seamless, and classy. My parents enjoyed the old-world historical ambience, rich mahogany decor, refined clientele, and polished service.  \n\nBooth seating means a private dining feeling even if there are lots of people around. We enjoyed the live jazz (piano and bass), and our server was always very prompt. We started with complementary crostini and cheese dip; clear iced water; and followed with a leaf of French country baguette, 6 buttery-sweet (not briny) B.C. oysters on the half shell, traditional onion soup in a rich beef broth, and then the main course. My husband enjoyed his rib-eye, smoked on a mesquite grill and glazed with butter, perfectly medium rare and nicely accompanied with baked potato (fixings on the side, e.g. sour cream, butter, chives) and horseradish. The sauteed veggies were lightly-oiled snow peas and julienned carrots. My mom also had the scalloped potatoes, which were quite good, and we all shared a hefty side of creamed spinach (probably 50/50 high quality cream to spinach).\n\nAll the food was filling, classic, and perfect for a dinner with the parents. I'm vegetarian, so it would have been nice to have more vegetarian options; but, I did not get a stink-eye when I only ordered a salad with dressing on the side. I appreciated that, bc at the steakhouse across the street (ahem, HoPR), I was always haggled a bit for only ordering a side dish or salad, and eating bread. On the contrary, our waiter treated us well. \n\nFor the birthdays: we even got two complementary scoops of vanilla ice cream in a small waffle cup and a bruleed marshmallow candle to share! Between this and coffee, we did not need more dessert. However, the peanut brittle at the door was a nice finish rather than the packaged peppermints.\n\nThis is a nice place to take people from out of town, and reservations are very easy courtesy of OpenTable. We parked on the street, which was free since it was Sunday.", "author": "Debora L."}

My boyfriend and I had the fresh oysters and mussel bisque for starters. The fresh oysters were pretty good, especially with the soy sauce/red ginger. However, some oysters still had a strong \"sea taste\" to it. The mussel bisque was my favorite part of the meal and that's saying a lot. It was perfectly flavored and nice and creamy. I'm not usually a huge fan of bisques but it captured a whole variety of flavors. I especially looooved the bread they gave with it. It was hot and toasty so it tasted delicious with the bisque. Moving on to the main course, both of us had ordered the bone-in ribeye steak cooked medium rare. I thought it was really bland tasting and I actually had to add in a lot of salt and pepper to give it some flavor. My steak was really fatty and it had a huge chunk of fat in the middle. However, I did like how it came with a side of potatoes and veggies, unlike other steakhouses where you only get the steak.", "author": "Cindy C."}

I chose this place due to friends' recommendations. We didn't order any appetizers knowing the steaks were enough. \n\nMy mom ordered one of the classics, the pepper steak. She didn't enjoy it as much as she thought she would. The peppercorn sauce was overwhelming for her, but I think it was also her first time having peppercorn. \n\nMy dad's and brother's steak were both cooked to perfection and delicious. They got the porterhouse and the ribeye both cooked rare and rare is what they got.\n\nI ordered the Executive cut prime rib. Now, I was impressed. It cut like butter, I didn't even need a steak knife, I could have used the butter knife and it would have cut just as easily. The fat and meat were marbled together so every bite was so tender, juicy, and oh so flavorful. It didn't even need the au jus to keep it moist. However, it is HUGE. I started giving away large portions of my prime rib to the others to help. I still didn't finish it and ended up taking it home. In my opinion, I thought my slice of prime rib was better than House of Prime RIb's. I might need to return to reaffirm this. xD.\n\nThe steaks come with sides like baked potatoes and veggies as if the steaks weren't big enough. No joke.\n\nSince it was my birthday, I received a complimentary birthday dessert. We were all too full for dessert anyways. So good choice in passing on the appetizers (but they do sounds yummers).\n\nOur waiter provided impeccable service. Our water glasses were never left empty. He checked up on us frequently. \n\nHarris' is one of my family's favorite steakhouses so far. I definitely want to come back to try their other cuts.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

The manager and host staff have made me never want to return to Harris' again. It's a terrible thing to have a guest be put off with their VERY FIRST encounter with your restaurant, but that's exactly what happened when I checked in and Elise, the manager, told me I could wait in the lounge. I come in, go to the host stand with a big smile and \"how are you tonight,\" to be greeted with nothing short of disdain and contempt. No return smile, no words of welcome, just \"I've checked you in and will seat you when the rest of your party arrives. You can wait in the lounge.\" Um, thanks, but NO. I will sit in the chair opposite the host stand and wait for my party to arrive. As I'm sitting there, another woman arrives. Clearly older than me so I guess, what?, more deserving of the respect all guests should get? When this woman checks in Elise says to her, \"would you like to wait at the table for your party?\" Seriously??? I'm sitting right there, but I guess she didn't deem me worthy of waiting at a table for my party. So I got up and confronted her with, \"do I also have the option of waiting at a table for my party?\" What a condescending, rude, woman! She says \"let me see if we can do that\" before handing menus to the other host. I WILL NEVER AGAIN SPEND MANY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS HERE BECAUSE OF ELISE.

If your looking for a great steak and a classy feel don't think about it just come here! \n\nAlso have to say the service is top notch too, our wine was warm from being in the car all day and our server insisted on an ice bucket and kept checking on it till it was perfect serving temp.", "author": "chris t."}

I have to hold my standards to Mastro's in Southern California and Alexander's in Cupertino.  I thought the steaks were okay here, nothing special.  It didn't melt in my mouth nor have any lasting flavors.  It was just steak.  It comes with a potato or the evening's potato (which was mashed potatoes the night we went) and some sugar snap peas.  Boring and nothing spectacular.  Their side dishes were limited and consisted of the usual creamed spinach and the typical side dishes.  As for dessert, we ordered the baked pumpkin alaska.  Not too bad.  Having a mediocre experience, I don't think I'd come back and spend a buttload of money here.", "author": "Kenitha Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-13", "description": "I guess this is one of the better steakhouses in San Francisco.  I don't know why this city lacks a real steakhouse the quality of a Keens or Old Homestead in NYC (shudder at the thought of having a Luger's or a Wolfgang's on a good day).  But it does, and this is what we get.\n\nIt's not bad.  I'm not going to say it's leagues better than a good night at Ruth's Chris or even Morton's.  I suppose it's better if you don't want the generic chain approach.\n\nSo the good - the Steak Diane was excellent.  Nice quality filet, excellent caramelized sauce.  Actually it was the sauce that saved this steak from being just another mediocre (yet high quality) cut of beef.  The dark, deep, sweet richness of the shallots, the savory-ness of drippings.  I dream of dabbing a fresh slab of French bread into the sauce and eating some roast beef with horseradish smothered in it.\n\nThe Pepper Steak was fine, though less successful and reveals the fundamental problem with Harris' as a steakhouse.  The peppercorn sauce was adequate but just lacked presence and personality to make up for a good quality, but relatively flavorless strip steak.  Why does the beef lack flavor?  Is it a fear of aging?  Minerality?  Lack of intense surface char?\n\nI remember biting into my first real steak at Keens, and oh man, the gaminess - it was pungent, fragrant, yes, dare I say, hinting at what I would have once thought to be past-due beef.  But man, once you get over the slight shock/revulsion and get that this is how it's supposed to taste, that steak was a revelation.  What flavor!  It's like trying a good blue cheese and allowing the robustness to drag you, mouth first, into a new taste sensation.\n\nSadly, none of that is here.  Nor do the steaks benefit from a pure, straightforward meat flavor intensified with a great char/seasoning.  So when you have an excellent shallot sauce to make up for it, like in the Diane, great.  When you don't, either on the Pepper Steak or the other, unadorned cuts, you end up with a fine, but not extraordinary, piece of meat.\n\nScalloped potatoes were pretty spot on excellent.  Other sides were just kind of there.  Onion rings, fried mushrooms, creamed spinach, nothing horrible, but nothing to write home about.\n\nWhen I think about the salads at Harris', I miss the crazy crispness, overwhelming quantity, rich, intense blue cheese flavor with the perfect accents of tomato and bacon from the iceberg wedge at Morton's.  That salad is more steak-like than most steaks, now that I think about it.  There's nothing subtle about it, and that's how I want it.  Salads here are fine but they only remind me of amazing salads -- actually they kinda pale in comparison if I'm really being honest.\n\nBut what an excellent salted caramel cheesecake.  The pure flavor and essence of the salt, caramel - hang on, perhaps there's a theme here, that Harris' carmelizes things well.  But it doesn't.  The steak crust caramelization is lacking, especially compared to the awesomeness of the crust at Luger's or (again, on a good day) Wolfgang's.  The carmelized onion side was fine, but lacked the depth of flavor I was hoping for.\n\nStill, I guess there's a reason I keep coming back.  Not like there are many other choices in town.  Skip the prime rib.  Skip the ribeye.  Definitely skip the rediculous wagyu crap (not unique to Harris', though it's a story worth a post of its own.)  Skip the appetizers and most of the sides.  Just get the Diane, scalloped potatoes and the cheesecake and enjoy what they do well.", "author": "Jason C."}

Nom.\n\nAs normal, my man did not really plan our anniversary dinner...instead we happened to find seats in the lounge at Harris' on a Saturday night.  (Why do things always work out...and better than I could have planned when I leave 'planning' to him?  I don't know...*grumbles*)\n\nAnyway, with the fame of Prime rib house, we attempted to go there first.  We had only had a  drink because we were not willing to wait 3 hours for a seat.  We also found the ambiance there to be too chaotic and packed with families with only half controlled children and tourists to be very romantic.  On the other hand, Harris' was booked in the dining room but we found lovely seats in the lounge area.  I thought the lounge was even better than the dining room.  I also appreciated the professional and high end host and hostess (in comparison to the overworked and frazzled hosts at Prime Rib House).  Harris' lounge was way more alive with upscale/slightly bougie energy.  A live band played great music where one lovely well behaved child danced with her grandfather for a few minutes.  We still got a corner booth seat.  The wait service was top notch, and the ambiance was simply nicer and more romantic.  \n\nDrink wise, I loved that they had a a house red and then a \"Sommelier Pick\" which was the same as the house wine price, but is way better in my opinion.  They also made a great martini which is important to my man.\n\nFood wise, I tried Sweet breads for the first time.  I tried them out of  curiosity, and ended up licking my plate.  Buttery mushroomy goodness covered perfectly seared sweet breads which were not gamey, chewy, or gross at all.  Just smooth, creamy, meaty goodness. \n\nThe beef portions are gigantic and absolutely worth the big bucks.  My prime rib had a wonderful rub on the outside and was perfectly tender and medium rare.  The smallest portion still left me with a 3/4 a baked potato, 1/2 of the creamed spinach, and 1/3 the prime rib in a doggy bag.  My man's dry aged new york steak was full of flavor and also absolutely amazing.  I took his 2\"x2\" piece of left over home as well. Nom.  Amazing leftovers.  *drools*\n\nLastly, we got a little chocolate cookie sandwich with mint sorbet in the middle as a light dessert.  The little candle the added made it truly festive.  As we finished out our 3 year anniversary dinner, the couple next to us started a quick conversation wishing us a happy anniversary since they too were celebrating one....35 years.  Wow!  Talk about an occasion to drown yourself in decadent meats!\n\nSo overall, I loved my experience here. It's more classic/fancy steak house than bougie/foodie steak house.  Both atmospheres are great.  Both atmospheres are better then that at Prime Rib House (in my opinion).   This place is definately worth a date night.", "author": "Susan C."}

I had high expectations, but I apologized to my wife as we finished dinner, which was very average. \n\nMy mixed green salad was good. Maybe 4 out of 5 stars. No complaints. \n\nMy steak (porterhouse) was an epic disappointment. It was flavorful enough, but definitely not worthy of the title \"one of San Francisco's best\" steaks. The waiter recommended that I try some of the sauce they put on the peppercorn steak, but he never told me it would be a cool $9 extra.  Well the sauce helped add to the flavor of my average tasting steak, which I ordered well done. It came out clearly medium to medium well. The dim lighting made it harder to see the color at first, but after eating about 1/3 of the steak, the pinkness was obvious. The waiter did offer to put it back on the grill, but by then, my wife had already finished her steak. As everyone should know, it's not gentlemanly to eat when the lady has already finished. \n\nDessert (apple caramel crisp thing) was good. 4 out of 5. \n\nIn summary, decent salad to start and decent dessert to end.

I had the luxury of dining here with some family from out of town the other week, and while they ordered items such as the prime rib, the bone-in rib eye, and the 49er cut, I can honestly say that the Harris Steak is truly the only way to go. That being said, the quality of all the meat from Harris is undeniable, and is worth every single dollar. For anyone looking for the 2000% fullness factor, you could go with apps + dessert where the appetizers were decent and the chocolate glittery mousse and creme brulee for dessert was delicious.  If you're looking for just enough food, the Harris Steak with the vegetable side and fully loaded baked potato was definitely enough for me.

The ambience is just what you would expect for a classic steakhouse and we really liked the live jazz playing in the lounge.  Unfortunately you couldn't really hear the music in the main dining room so if you like the music I would suggest staying in the bar/lounge area.\n\nI ordered a martini, I like how they served it in a little carafe buried in a half barrel filled with ice to keep the drink cold until you were ready to pour.  Unfortunately they have no beers on draft, but the husband was able to find something he liked.\n\nWe were seated pretty promptly at our reservation time.  Our server was very warm and friendly, but unfortunately it became obvious we were not her first priority.  She had some other tables with larger parties; maybe they were more demanding.  She did not spend much time with us after taking our order.\n\nShe did recommend the salad special, hearts of romaine with a tomato/basil/roquefort dressing.  We split it between us and both liked it very much.  I'm not a fan of tomatoes but she assured us you couldn't taste the tomato much, and she was right.\n\nThe unfortunate part of this was that we had ordered crab cakes as an appetizer, and we never did see them.  We weren't charged for them, either, but the oversight was annoying as we had been looking forward to trying them.\n\nHarris' is different than some other upscale steakhouses in that the price for a steak also includes potato and veggie.  For the potato, we were given a choice of baked potato and mashed potatoes.  I opted for a filet with the mashed potatoes, and the husband got the 49er cut with a baked potato.  Shortly after we finished our salad, our entrees came out.....both with mashed potatoes.  When I pointed out the oversight, the runner offered to get a replacement, but my darling husband declined.  Again, not a huge thing, but an oversight that you don't expect to see in this kind of environment.  Our steaks were fine, though my filet was a bit chewy.  The husband said his was a bit better than what you would find at Ruth's Chris, but nowhere near the best he'd had.\n\nFor dessert he had the creme brulee and I had the chocolate cake.  My cake was a little dry, though the bittersweet chocolate icing was lovely.  Husband did enjoy the creme brulee.\n\nI suspect the husband enjoyed the meal more than I did; he mentioned a couple of times of \"when\" we'll be back, for me it's much more a case of \"if\".\n\nAll in all, three stars.

On this day, we arrived at 5:45 PM for our 5:30 PM reservations and were promptly seated. I did call ahead of time to inform the hostess we were running late and she said, it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nAs a recommendation from our waiter, we both started off with a glass of the 2009 A to Z, Oregon, Pinot Noir ($11): While it was earthy with a hint of fruity and violet notes, it was too spicy and acidic for my taste. \n\nFOOD:\n*COMPLIMENTARY BREAD: GOOD! Reminiscent to fresh-out-of-the-oven Acme Bread, the petite French baguette was warm, crusty, chewy and pillowly soft in the middle. \n\n*COMPLIMENTARY CROSTINI w/ Cheese Spread: GOOD!

Several other Yelpers had mentioned that their steaks were overcooked too, so if I were to go again, I would request my steak, rare. It took 10 mins to get a new one.\n\nMy perfectly grilled 8 oz. filet was crowned with a generous slab of seared foie gras with juices oozing from the sides. As I cut into the filet and the foie gras, the juices from the foie gras dripped into the filet, marinating each fiber with decadent richness. The well-seasoned filet was soft, tender and the foie gras was like crumbles of fat that melted in my palate. Together, the filet and foie gras married and created the perfect harmony of rich, beefy and savory goodness. The black truffle cabernet sauce was complex and had depth of flavor to it; adding that a layer of earthiness with a tangy rich sweetness that set this dish over the top! \n\n*SIDES: Our entrees came with a choice of a Baked Potato or Cheese Scalloped Potatoes. \n\n--BAKED POTATO: OK! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FqYg7BcsryLFiUTknxpQpw?select=UCfw-bRQf84F1fJcp9ZhRw \nIt was just a plain baked potato you can get at any chain restaurant like Sizzler's or Red Lobster. \n\n--CHEESE SCALLOPED POTATOES: GOOD! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FqYg7BcsryLFiUTknxpQpw?select=4r10-Sw5q6yxaHA0LiNXFQ\nThe slices of potatoes were stacked and then topped with cheese. The potatoes were tender and creamy, however it wasn't cheesy enough as the you didn't get that pull from the cheese as you cut into them. \n\n*MEYER LEMON BAKED ALASKA w/ Lemon Ice Cream and Sponge Cake ($9): DECANDENTLY LIGHT! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FqYg7BcsryLFiUTknxpQpw?select=wOKvLtS-tW9hFrHCwb3T1Q\n\nThe meringue was perfectly torched creating a slightly burnt crisp crust, yet maintained airy, light and fluffy inside. The lemon ice cream was refreshingly tart with a hint of sweetness while the sponge cake was rich and buttery, but light. The combo of all three created contrasting warm/cold temperatures, crisp, smooth, and soft textures with sweet, creamy and refreshing citrus flavors. \n\nS E R V I C E:\nProfessional and attentive but pretentious. Our dishes were well timed and we were never left waiting for more than 15 mins for each course.

Even if it's only 21 dry aged, it's incredibly flavorful, juicy and moist. Every single piece of meat is a pleasure for your mouth, incredible, just IN-CRE-DI-BLE. Wow. And it was perfectly cooked, finally. Even if in US they usually overcook their meat, here I could ask for bleu steak and receive an almost raw piece, exactly as I wanted.

Even the lamb was spot-on!\n\nWine list is decent, I liked the fact that is heavily american based, but I think they should add some more south american wines, argentinian anyone!?\n\nAh sincerely, avoid desserts: it's a 2 stars dessert, nothing bad but with a lot of problems both in the choice of ingredients (raspberry and milk chocolate?!

The first thing he said to us was 'Soooooo, I know you have some ice water coming but do you want to order some beverage?' It made me felt like I was in a McDonald, just took my order and walked away. I didn't realized how bad it was until I compared him to our server in the next table.

Live music was playing in the bar area so we opted for a more private booth in the main dining room.\n\nHarris' is a steak house so their menu focuses on the beef. Interesting how some of my friends and fellow reviewers complain about their lack of options in sides. The focus should be the beef. What do you expect, Outback?\n\nService is top-notch and impeccable the minute we were seated. Everyone, from the ma\u00eetre d', the bread and water servers, and to our waiter, was fantastic. As befit high-end dining, Harris' paces the meal very well. Bread was served just before we got our salads:\n\n*Harris' Caesar: just your usual Caesar's salad, but with very rich dressing. Certainly sets the tone for the meal. \n*Special mixed field greens with smoked trout and balsamic vinaigrette: the portion was so generous that there was trout in every bite.\n*Onion rings: absolutely amazing. For $8 you have a full bowl of beer-battered, crispy onion rings, much better deal than most restaurants.\n\n*Now for the steak. The filet mignon is available in regular (12 oz) and petit (8 oz). For $49 you get the full portion and is a better value, but we both decided that 8 oz. of meat is more than plenty to eat. Mine was *medium rare\", perfectly cooked---had a salty, crispy outside, and tender, juicy, medium rare/pink center. The beef had aromatic hints of rosemary, and the savory nuttiness of brown butter.  I wasn't thrilled about scalloped potato.\n\n*Wine pairing was a pinot noir by Landy in Russian River ($17/glass). The meal concluded with Baked Alaska, a white cake topped with ice cream and meringue. Sumptuous and fulfilling.\n\nThe only foible was the smallness of our table. The onion rings, the bread, the two salads were squeezed all together to make room for wine glasses. \n\nNot sure if Harris' has relaxed its attire requirement. It does not require coat or tie for gentlemen. However, no shorts, sports casual or sandals may be worn while dining in he dining room. Couple gentlemen in t-shirts, baggy jeans and hi-top shoes were sighted.\n\nStreet parking very difficult. Valet parking available.", "author": "Matt Y."}

The short version goes like this:  Open Table screwed up our original reservation at HOPR, so we made another at Cha3, however, when we got to Cha3 they were closed.  Looks like Open Table has some serious issues.  Anyway, we thought we'd try walking in at HOPR - HA! - the place was an absolute zoo with a purported 2.5 hour wait for walk-ins.  Yeah, not so much.  We decided to walk down a block to Harris' Restaurant.  We went in, gave our name, went to the bar, and surprisingly enough we were seated before my dining companions finished the first half of their first round from the bar.\n\nOur waiter was very kind and helpful, and the herd of minions in their short, white lab coats were very prompt in making sure everyone's water glasses were topped off at all times, and that any empty dishes were removed from the table post haste and forthwith.\n\nClearly this place is famous for their beef as evidenced by the cases of hanging slabs dry-aging on one side of the lobby, and the refrigerated case with choice cuts on the other.  Well, that and the menu's sticker shock that punches you right in the face.  I've never in my life looked at a menu that featured a $195 steak.  Clearly I don't get out often, but then again I don't like to wear pants, so there is that.\n\nMy five companions all ordered steak of one variety or another; I ordered the salmon.  Now I'm sure at this point you must have gasped in horror and are asking why I would do such a thing at a place like Harris'.  Well, the truth of it is, I'm ridiculously picky when it comes to steak, and I've learned over the years that there is no restaurant that can prepare a steak the way I do at home.  Let's be clear, I am in no way saying I grill up the best steak on earth, but I do grill up the best steak for me.  Be that as it may, my girlfriend ordered steak so I knew I'd get to try some, and what I tried further proved my point; she got the fillet mignon and I'd give it a solid 'okay'.  The salmon?  Simply delicious.\n\nI'm awarding three stars because the average of likes and dislikes pretty much land there.  One thing that brought the number down a bit was the snotty, pretentious group of people sitting at a table in the bar throwing my group some serious shade.  Evidently our level of dress did not meet their discerning standards and they felt it was appropriate to give nasty looks and chide amongst themselves.  Yeah, I know that's not Harris' fault, but if those are the types of people Harris' attracts, then that's the rating they get from me.", "author": "Kevin K."}

We asked the receptionist to hold onto our bottle until we are seated. They had poured the bottle into the decanter before we arrived to the table which is a nice touch.

We shared an onion soup and caesar salad. I love that the salad came split for us, and I was already in love with how creamy the caesar dressing was.

Depending on what you're looking for, Harris may not be the steakhouse for you. For the same price (about $200 for 2 steaks, 2 drinks, 2 appetizers), you can:\n\n1. Get a SOLID prime rib at HOPR half a block away\n2. Have a superior menu and quality steak at Alexanders\n3. Go a bit further down the street around the corner to Bobo's to get more unique cuts (like the bone in Filet) for cheaper\n4. Go to Espetus to get great variety and flavor\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that Harris is good but not great, and when you throw in the price, it's not worth it. If you've tried any of the above to have \"newer\" steak, I'd reconsider where you spend your money.\n\nI had the bone in new york and the girlfriend had the bone in ribeye. Both were cooked well, but slightly lacking in flavor. Both came pretty simply with a slab of butter on top, but nothing more than salt and pepper (probably) to enhance the flavor. With your meal, you get a choice of scalloped or baked potato, both of which were ok, but inferior to House of Prime Rib's preparation and side options. \n\nWe also ordered the crab cakes (which were good, but again, fairly basic) and the mushroom/clam bisque, which was great and quite unique.

I'm usually not a steak fan, it never cooked to the way where I enjoy my hunk of beef. But my guy friends have came here once and they keep telling me how the steak just melts in their mouth with very minimal chewing. Then of course, when my boyfriend decide to bring me here for an anniversary dinner, my experience was far from what they have described.\n\nWhen we first arrived, the host was so sweet and asked if they can take my coat. I have never had my coat taken off for me before, for that split second I thought I was classy! Our server was excellent, I like my servers with a little bit of humor and communicative, Josh was definitely my kind of waiter. The petite new york steak I ordered certainly did not melt in my mouth. It was a lot more tender to most of the steaks I had tasted elsewhere, but my expectations was a lot higher so it somewhat missed the mark for me. Aside from what I was expecting, the steak was seasoned well and cooked to exactly medium rare that I had requested.\n\nNot a place to visit on a regular basis, but if I do come back. I think I'm going back to my usual prime ribs.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

I didn't review their website nor have time to check out anything else about the place since it had high rating on yelp. Man, how disappointed I was! My 8 years old son worn a nice of pair slack shorts, those that golfers wear when golfing. When we checked in, the hostess said our table is being set up. After 10 seconds, they said we can't eat here since shorts are not allowed. Wow! give me a break, I just saw a man with jeans and ragged plaid shirt looking like a homeless walking around the restaurant. I asked if they would make an acceptation, that we didn't know rule and he's only a kid. Nope, not even a blink NO! I was pisst! Give me a break! This is SF, who even cares? It was suppose to be a special occasion that turned into a family who got booted out because our little boy had shorts on. Thank goodness we had some old clothes in our car. My little boy suck it up and changed into an old pair of size 5 pink tights so we can eat at this snobby place for his dad's birthday.\n\nFood: We had the sweet bread and two salads. The sweet bread it was dried and harsh when it's suppose to be smooth and milky. \nSteaks: We ordered the porter house and the lamb chops. The porter house was the smallest  I have ever eaten. Aside from the inadequate size for the price tag of a whooping $61, it was not tender. Tasted more like a normal piece of New York steak. we added the foie gras to our steak, don't do it. It's not worth the money. That it was 1/8  size of a normal portion. Lamp was standard. Nothing outstanding.\n\nAmbience: the restaurant is divided into couple sections, lounge/bar, fine dinning and two back rooms by the lounge area. We were taken through the fine dinner room passing many white folks, before we were seated in one of the back room by the bar with four other Asian families. How racist is that!!!!! It was loud and noisy with the bar right there. Not what i was hoping to experience for the price we paid. Sure they hired a bunch of Asian to work there so they can say they are diverse but they have to send the one that doesn't speaks English asking if we wanted chive, sour cream and butter for our potatoes. It took me three times to understand what he was offering.\n\nP.S. My son was seated and no one even noticed or can see his pink tights! What's the point?\n\nConclusion: First and last time. Unfortunately, we had a terrible experience. We felt the food wasn't up to par and we definitely felt this establishment is racist. I will never eat here again. There are plenty of wonderful steak houses in SF that we take our family and business to.", "author": "Trace D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-04-10", "description": "I am completely mystified that most other reviewers had such great experiences at Harris' and mine was so very awful.  \n\nTo summarize my grievances: \n\nMediocre food: \nAfter a few bites, I actually switched my entree with my husband's (he offered) because the NY strip steak with peppercorn cream sauce was ssoooo chewy and the peppercorn sauce was not very tasty.  Steak au Poivre is a favorite of mine, so I've tried many versions...many versions that cost WAY LESS money... and this was the worst version I have ever had.  So my hubby was kind enough to trade with me and then I had an ample helping of \"Steak Diana\" (Diane?) which was more flavorful, still only \"ok\", however I felt a bit sketchy as I ate it.  See food poisoning below.  But I was hungry, so I ate.  \n\nThe service: \nFrom the valets ogling me at the door, the stoic, chilly reception at the host/hostess stand, the bored demeanor of the waiter, I felt the staff doesn't care to be there at all.  It seemed they were all just cogs in a wheel, feeling lifeless in their jobs.  The only service staff that shone was the busboy (or helper of the waiter)...he was funny, engaging, observant, helpful and kind.  I was going to give an extra star because of him, the live music, and the decor, but when the food poisoning trauma hit me later that night, I decided those good things couldn't make up for it.  1 star it is.  \nPlus, I informed staff that it was my husband's birthday.  They could at least said \"Happy Birthday\"? But not a word.  Maybe they didn't hear the words that came from my mouth? I am not known to be a quiet talker by any means.\n\nCleanliness: \nMy husband's water glass had lipstick on the rim that I only spotted halfway through the meal.  It was disturbing primarily because of the prices on the menu.  One would think that if you are paying roughly $100 per person, they would have attention to detail.  \n\nA TERRIBLE CASE OF FOOD POISONING:  \nLater that night I had many trips to the bathroom!  Horrible horrible horrible is all I can say.  Just traumatic.  My husband was busy with the same thing in the morning.  Like I said, I had more of the Steak Diana that he did, so I think that was the culprit.\n\nNot a very happy birthday dinner for my man!  We will never be back and we will recommend all of our friends against it.  We were initially thinking of going to Ruth's Chris because we had gone there once before and were blown away by how delicious everything was.  We thought Harris' would be of similar caliber.  But no... Harris' is more like a stale, run-down country club in some small suburb.  In this city of great eating, one can do waaaay better.", "author": "Aria Ana\u00efs Electra S."}

We came around 20 mins early (so we can have time to find parking).. we ended up waiting for that extra 20 mins, which I didn't mind.\n\nThe things we ordered:\n\nFoie Gras ($25) Seared foie gras with grill toast and a fire roasted orange marmalade:  I gave my bf $20 bucks so I can order this dish and I am glad I did! This dish was absolutely amazing! The foie gras melted in my mouth and the crispy toast with a little bit of orange marmalade was amazing in texture. The toast soaked up all of the foie gras oily fat and the orange marmalade was not too sweet and not too sour, just perfect. This dish didn't waste any of the flavors given from the foie gras. If you do not like the fatty taste of things, this isn't something you should get, but I would order this again if I came back!\n\nPorterhouse ($54) w/ side of snap peas (substituted the option for potatos with more veggies -- they gave me broccoli) medium rare: SOOOO JUICY! around the outside of the porterhouse, it was a bit tough to cut and the bone didn't really help.... but as I was cutting more and more into the center, the juicier it got. It just melted in my mouth!\n\nBone-in ribeye steak ($48): my bf liked it but didn't love it.  When I took a bite out of his ribeye, it was charred on the outside and moist in the inside. \n\nFilet Mignon Rossini ($50): I didn't try this dish, but from the person that ate it, it was way too charred on the outside and it wasn't to their liking. I am not putting fault onto Harris' for this because it was just the wrong choice of meat for that person. I think that person would have enjoyed the prime rib over the filet mignon.\n\nThe side of mash potato that my bf ordered was very very creamy and a bit bland, but I still like it.\n\nThe service was awesome, water was never empty, the waiter was very knowledgeable and able to answer all of our questions. The atmosphere was romantic, and secluded, each table gets the privacy that they need to have a romantic dinner.", "author": "Erica T."}

The ambiance of this restaurant is that traditional/classic steakhouse that has huge booths that anyone can appreciate (especially for privacy).\n\nAs a starter, we went with one of the specials for the day. Corn and crab clam chowder($9). Mmm...So much goodness in one bowl! It's definitely one of those soups that has you wanting more. The crab cakes($14) weren't anything special but the iceberg lettuce salad ($9) with the cucumber dijon dressing was so delicious and refreshing!\n\nNow, I never really understand how anyone could go to a steakhouse and not order steak! There are quite a bit of choices but my eyes were pleading me to go with the Porterhouse ($56). Birthday girl ordered the Pepper Steak ($47) and the other birthday girl went with the Scottish Salmon ($34). Our sides, creamed spinach($9) and brandy sauce ($7) were the perfect pairings. The Porterhouse was enough to share between two people. We ordered it medium-well and it was done just right. I wasn't a fan of the Pepper Steak but birthday girl enjoyed it. The salmon was served with rice and champagne sauce...very tasty!\n\nOverall, service was good but it could've been better.  We had noted that it we were celebrating a birthday and when we ordered dessert, I'm not going to press that it wasn't complimentary but they didn't even write \"happy birthday\" on the plate!

My small filet was OK, but not outstanding; my son's prime rib (his favorite) was overcooked and a bit on the tough side. My wife, electing to go vegetarian that night, did not enjoy the peculiar onion soup (in fairness, the waiter mentioned beforehand that the preparation would not be the usual style of onion soup and he was correct - just a tasteless broth with onions floating in it), but holy Omaha, how can a high-end steak house mess up a baked potato. It was very poor quality to start with. Maybe the staff kitchen was having an off night, but considering the cost of the evening, we were expecting a lot more. Service was mediocre.

I desparately wanted to give five stars, but I was not crazy about my porterhouse, and the sides could use some work. Now that I explained my relatively \"low\" four-star review, on to the good stuff... \n\nEverything from the service, decor, and ambiance add to the phenomenal dining experience. We start of course, with the food. The grilled foie gras with grill toast and fire roasted marmalade was absolutely incredible, a perfect way to start off. \n\nFor the main course, I had the 16 oz. porterhouse and my wife had the filet mignon rossini. One side of my porterhouse was a little tough, while the other side was absolutely perfect. When I tried my wife's filet mignon, I couldn't stop digging into it (much to her chagrin).  It was lively, flavorful, and simply amazing. \n\nService was nothing short of excellent. If you look up perfect customer service, you'll probably find our server's picture next to it. No need to ever look around to find him. It's like he has ESP, reading our minds as to what we need and checking often without being annoying.  He was knowledgeable of the menu and gave insightful suggestions. \n\nThe decor was pretty good, though I would have preferred to sit in the jazz room rather than the booth (as an aside, I've never been a fan of booths). \n\nOverall, I'd recommend Harris to anyone without hesitation. The jury's out if I can call it the best steak in San Francisco. But I can pretty much guarantee that you will have a meal to talk about long after your visit.", "author": "Angel S."}

We had a hearty dinner and here's what I thought about the food:\n\nAPPETIZERS\n- Caesar Salad = had too much of something.  My friend said it had too much cheese.  It was okay, but i couldn't detect the overdose of that ingredient.\n\n- Onion Soup = larger bowl than I expected.  tasted good.\n\n- Bread = at first they give you these baguette bread chips with cheese dip and butter.  I swear the cheese dip with the bread is like a high class version of the  Handisnacks cheese and breadsticks.  I was disappointed with the bread until i found out that there's a bread man that walks around and drops off little bread rolls for you.\n\nENTREES\n- Steak Diane = yummylicious.  Those little shallots are great!  The filet mignon was so freakin tender, cut it with a fork.\n\n- Porterhouse steak = delicious!  Not as tender as the Steak Diane but still so good.

There was a nice warm feeling inside with some old time feel. The layout was pretty cool with a bar section, private reserved rooms, and a nice dining area on the opposite side. The lighting and music set a nice tone.\n\nWe were welcomed by a friendly wait staff that was very professional and well spoken. The whole time that we were there, our water cups stayed full, and we were checked on regularly, in a non overbearing way. I notice that some restaurants, the servers either come so often that it feels like they are more of an interuption to the conversations that are taking place, or they don't come enough giving an impression thst they do not really care. This place, the servers got it down and I appreciate that.\n\nStarted off with drinks and appetizers. I ordered a Manhattan which was tasty. We all shared some shrimp, onion rings, and smoked salmon. I feel as if im leaving something out, but anywho, everything was light and delicious. The onion ring batter was deep fried perfectly with a nice flakey texture that was golden, indicating that they use fresh oil and the correct temps. The smoke salmon was perfect. The shrimp were fairly large and fresh.\n\nSo on to the main entr\u00e9e.. we all ordered bone-in rib eye steaks. I ordered mine to be cooked medium, and it actually came out cooked medium. Thank you. When i first took a bite into the meat, my first reaction was that the texture of the meat was \"buttery\". It was very good, moist, and had good flavor. If i told you that it was the most amazing steak that i have ever stuck my chompers into.. that would beva bit of a stretch, but not to undermine the chef's or the meat, it was very good. The mash potatoes had a very addictive taste. And the veggies were perfect, with the right amount of sauce on them that did not take away from the veggies.

I truly believe their chefs should revisit the meanings of the cooking temperatures for steak. My medium rare steak was not pink at all inside, has little to no juice/blood coming out, and looked more cooked than the medium steak that one of my family member ordered. And did I mentioned that their side veggies looks like they were left over from last night?\n\nAside from the food, the service was good, and the server did not hesitate to bring the over cooked steak to the kitchen for another one. Truly, I don't think I'll ever come back, nor will I recommend this place to anyone.", "author": "Ruby C."}

The best meat I've had in a long time. My boyfriend got the 12oz filet mignon ($53) and I got the 8oz filet mignon ($47). They come with your choice of baked potato or potato of the day, and vegetables. This was also really good - vegetables cooked to perfection (not overcooked like most restaurants). The portion size was good, we were both satisfied. \n\nThe service was obviously exemplary. \n\nNote - there are two sections to the restaurant. The main dining room is upscale and requires business casual dress. It's a beautiful room, with lovely large windows and comfortable booths. The atmosphere was very pleasant. Neither my boyfriend nor I usually eat at extremely expensive places because they tend to be too stuffy, but we really enjoyed Harris'. \n\nThe other section is the piano lounge, that is less formal and has live jazz and and the bar. We sat at the bar for a while before being seated. The jazz was very good, and a pleasant volume. The bartenders were very helpful. I HIGHLY recommend the Eagle Manhattan. It is one of the best cocktails I've had. I usually go for an Old Fashioned or a Gimlet, but the bartender suggested the Manhattan, and I'm glad I took his suggestion. \n\nAll in all, a good place to treat yourself.", "author": "Isabelle A."}

(Harris' is one of our favorite celebratory dining destinations) We arrived right on time and we were presently seated in a cramped tiny 2 person table. My wife could barely fit because she is very pregnant. I noticed a bunch of empty booths available and politely asked if we could be seated in a booth instead. The hostess was polite but basically said no... I mentioned that it was our wedding anniversary and the fact that my wife was pregnant and could hardly fit at the tiny table. After having to push the issue we were only offered a corner seat in the busy and very loud bar area as an option. I then went directly to the gentleman doing the seating that seemed to be in charge and again stated our issue. He was just rude... and said they were booked up... and basically too bad... WOW! Completely classless... I walked away and wanted to leave because of the terrible customer service and rude host but my wife asked that we just try to salvage the evening so I let it go and tried to enjoy the meal. \n\nOur server was pleasant but when we asked for a recommendation or his opinion he was very non committal and wishy washy, not ever really answering our questions...\n\nLastly when our food arrived, my wife's steak was fine (Petite New York w/ mashed) but unfortunately my \"go to\" steak (Bone In Rib Eye) was supper fatty like 80% fat and clearly was just a cheap bad cut of meat. It was probably among the worst steak I've ever had, yuck... I've had better steaks at Outback... I ate a few bites but that's all I could stomach. Thankfully my wife shared hers with me which was good. Overall an incredible disappointment, especially on our anniversary.  \n\nHarris's has sadly really gone down hill, and its not cheap but at least in the past it was a good meal, with decent service... My pregnant wife and I left feeling ripped off and mistreated on our wedding anniversary no-less...This is the 2nd time in the last 4 we have gone to Harris' and had a bad meal. \n\nWere done! and won't be coming back again... \n\nPS, and odd coincidence perhaps, but the next day I awoke feeling sick, like slight food poisoning..

The last two visits are the most recent: July 2013 and Feb 2014. I have dined in the lounge as well as in the main dining room. I believe I can provide a broad review of what to expect when you visit this restaurant.\n\nI wanted to give a 3.5 star review as my experience was good, but not outstanding. There were some situations that cut into my night out and were what I considered unacceptable for the money involved.\n\nFirst off, the \"bus boy\" staff at Harris' needs to brush up on it's English-speaking skills. Yes, I'm going there. If you are doing more than filling water, than I expect you to be able to UNDERSTAND me. I know how to  S L O W down and S P E A K clearly since I dine with people who are not native English speakers on a regular basis. Our bus boy did not understand me when I requested another fork. He did NOT understand how to say HORSE RADISH. I couldn't even understand whatever word he used in its place! He was describing the garnish for the bake potato to my friend, and came out completely wrong.\n\nMy friend ordered the special salad of the day : Ahi Tuna Caesear, and I had the Baby Spinach Salad. His had a very nice presentation (albeit I couldn't tell WHERE the tuna was in all of the dressing). My salad warranted a trip to a chain restaurant. I have no idea who put it together, but it looked like someone tossed a handful of baby spinach leaves onto a plate and then a few spoonfuls of the other ingredients and sent it out the door. Honestly, I have done a better job when I'm trying to make myself a similar dish in a hurry. It was also too big. There was probably at least two cups of spinach leaves. I've seen their wedge and now their salad of the day. Come on folks--let's put some effort into ALL of the salads you have to offer.\n\nThe steak: I ordered the porterhouse and my friend ordered the bone-in rib-eye. I am boring. I wanted mine medium rare. He SPECIFICALLY requested WELL DONE. I have another friend who always requests this type of preparation, and it NEVER HAPPENS. I was dubious if this would occur here. Guess what? IT DIDN'T! The waiter SPECIFICALLY double-checked regarding WELL DONE. My friend confirmed it twice. His steak was medium rare at best. Luckily he was a good sport and just ate it. If you are someone who has a real problem with bloody meat, that's not cool. The steaks were delicious, but I have to knock off points for this egregious error in following the diner's wishes.\n\nOur desserts were delicious and probably one of the highlights of the evening due to NOTHING being wrong with them. He had the Baked Alaska and I had the Salted Caramel Cheesecake.\n\nTake guests here who wants to have an extraordinary steak, but be mindful of the other choices on the menu. I'm dubious about the non-meat appetizers at this point.\n\nThe lounge is a lovely alternative if you want to have a cozier experience. Their band is excellent. A good choice if you can't get a reservation and they have room.", "author": "Gabby R."}

I made a reservation through \"Open Table\" 6 days before our visit, asking if they would be able to prepare a birthday cake suitable for 3 people with her name and age written on the plate, and asking whether a table or booth would be a better option to enjoy the atmosphere and live music.\n \nAfter 2 days of no response, assuming that maybe I had made a mistake in the reservation process, I canceled and immediately resubmit my reservation with the same time and questions attached. \n\nAfter 2 days, again, no response...so I went to Harris' website and found their direct email this time. I emailed the restaurant with my question/special request.\n\nChecked my email the next day, of course, no response. It is now 1 day before our reservation, so I decided to call and confirm that they got my reservation/request. The person I spoke to on the phone confirmed that they got my reservation, but he \"couldn't read, or the special request had been cut off\". It was clear that no one had bothered to read my special request or check the restaurant's email. I asked if they would be able to provide a cake, with candles, suitable for 3 people. I was told no, that I would have to make the request at least 3 days in advance (even though of course, I already did). He did agree that I could bring in my own cake...so I guess that would have to do.\n\nI also asked my question about the table vs booth, and he recommended a table because they were located in the same room with the live music, whereas the booths were not. I confirmed that I would like a table for my reservation.\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant and were greeted by the hostess, who promptly led our party to a booth... I told her that I had definitely reserved a table, not a booth, on the phone the previous day. Either this restaurant has the worst coordination ever, or the person on the phone didn't even bother to set a table as part of our reservation. This was ALREADY starting to kill our mood for the evening that I had been working so hard to set in the first place so that we wouldn't have to go through this. We were embarrassingly led back to the front, while the hostess would check to see if a table was available. There were no tables available, even though we had reserved one, so we would have to sit at a booth. She was rude and gave us an excuse about canceling and redoing our reservation causing the issue, even though I CALLED the night before and made the arrangement. We were given a very rude \"SORRY ABOUT THAT\" and no real apology or sympathy, just the atmosphere that we were being troublesome for trying to get a table like I RESERVED!\n\nI then explained about the cake with candles and name/age, AGAIN. She had me write down my mother-in-law's name and age to be written on her desert plate. Guess what wasn't on the desert plate when it arrived? Nothing was written on the plate...ok whatever, I'm tired of trying with this place.\n\nThis restaurant didn't thank us for our reservation at all; they just wanted to throw canceling and resubmitting it at me, and the staff was very rude to us. Nothing we requested was fulfilled from the reservation; they completely killed the birthday party mood for us. The staff I interacted with at this restaurant is really cheapening the value of the experience.

The two options for meat were the filet and the NY strip. I got the filet (medium rare). The first course was the wedge salad. It was smothered in buttermilk dressing, which I kind of avoided because I wanted to save myself for the meat.\n\nThe meat came with a side of potato gratin and some sweet peas and carrots. Even though my filet was cooked medium rare, I thought it was overcooked. My boyfriend ordered his rare and it was much better. The meat wasn't as juicy as I expected. Maybe they gave the meat plenty of time to rest and for the juices to redistribute. I think also because this was part of a set dinner for a large group, the quality was off par because they had to send out 30 plates at the same time. My favorite part was actually the potato gratin. It tasted like a heart clogger and I loved it! Creamy and the potatoes had perfect texture. The carrots were a bit mushy but the sweet peas were pretty good.\n\nWe had to skip out on dessert.

I've eaten there many times before and ate there when it was called Grison's.  This is the 1st time that I've been disappointed but, for the price, I don't think I'll eat there again.\n\nWe were seated in the left side of the room.. Preferred the other side and asked to be seated elsewhere but the hostess was not accommodating.  So, we just sat where she placed us.  After we were seated for awhile, a HUGE crowed of people came in to be seated right in front of us -- around 20; an Oracle convention was apparently in town.  I got up to ask to be move again.  The host (a different person than the hostess who seated us) moved us to the other side of the room which was much quieter.  \n\nI just go to Harris' for the steak.  My GF ordered the filet mignon w/a side of foie gras and I ordered the 1lb boneless NY strip.  We also ordered a Ceasar's salad and a Baked Alaska to share before and after the steak entrees.  The salad was ok but did not seem authentically prepared; it was not prepared table side so I didn't know how it was made but it did not taste as it should -- it actually tasted like it came out of a bottle -- and there was a big filet of anchovy which should not have been there.  Anchovies in an authentic Ceasar salad are ground up to provide the salad w/flavor it's NOT a garnish.\n\nI always eat my steaks rare and how a restaurant prepares a rare steak is my test of how good it is.  My steak did NOT come out rare; it came out medium rare.  So, I sent it back.  The 2nd steak was rarer but still not fully rare; still too warm in the middle for my taste.  I didn't bother sending the 2nd steak back.  My GF ordered her filet mignon med rare; it came out closer to medium but she was fine w/that because that's actually how she prefers hes.  She only ordered med rare in case she couldn't finish and I needed to help her eat the rest.  So, it was a FAIL for me on the steak prep.  BTW, the foie gras that adorned my GF's filet mignon was a barely visible 2 oz piece which cost $14..  We were forewarned about that but my GF wanted it and enjoyed what there was of it. The Baked Alaska was a single portion but was enough for the 2 of us.  The meringue had a nicely browned spiral around it and the ice cream and cake inside tasted very good. \n\nBy the time we were ready to leave, the restaurant was extremely crowded and noisy.  Not the cozy, quiet restaurant that I have been use to.  They even set up some booths with 2-4 extra chairs at the end of the table placed in the aisles so that the could seat groups of 6-9, which I thought was tacky and detracted from the feel of the place.  Maybe we just caught them on a bad night but, given the cost of the meal at $200+, I don't think I'll be going back again.  5A5, where I have been served a properly prepared rare steak in the past, will probably be my go to steak house in the City from now on.", "author": "Martin C."}

Glad to know that Harris is a big Giants fan as well.\n\nSteaks was the call of the day.  The steaks were a good size and they cooked it to perfection at least to what we ordered.  They had side dishes that were pretty darn tasty.  I didn't have wine with my dinner this time but instead went for a cocktail.  They were pretty yummy.  I must admit, they have a great selections of wines to compliment your dinner.\n\nThe ambience is warm and a throwback of the early 60s or something.  I wasn't alive then but I am told as such. And yet, the service is top notch.  Anyhow, this place did not disappoint with food or service.  Definitely a place that is often missed but I it is a hidden gem everyone should try.", "author": "Angela L."}

Otherwise: valet parking is a great option.  The place was dark, a bit romantic...more like an old school steak house.  Weird to have a cooler with their raw meat right at the door though.\n\nService:  great!  servers were attentive, eager to help and very knowledgeable.\n\nFood:  awesome.  typical, traditional steak menu but were otherwise good.\nWe ordered:\nmartini--loved that little barrel it came in with, hubby ordered jack n coke.. it's as good as he wants it to be\n onion rings for apps- hmm... it was okay.  I've had better.\nhubby ordered the peppered steak-- he thinks it had too much black pepper it overpowered the steak.\nI had Filet Mignon rossini and it was awesome!  loved the smoky taste with the richness of the foie gras and the sauce that came with it.  the green beans were a bit overcooked though.\n\nLastly, we had their baked lemon alaska.- great way to end the meal.\n\nwith 2 glasses of wine, we ended up spending about $200 (including 20% tip).\n\nAll in all, the dining experience was great.  a good treat for foodies like us.\nif you like old school steak dinner and have extra cash to spend, this is your place.

I'm not a huge fan of meat, but once in a while I do crave steak and this place hits the spot.  \n\nI usually get the petite filet mignon, which comes with veggies and potatoes.  I like my steak medium rare and they have always done it perfectly, with the outside cooked and the inside red and juicy.  Along with the perfectly cooked meat, they also offer a side of potatoes -- my favorite is their scalloped potatoes, but they do not always have this option.  The last time I was there, they only had baked or gratin potatoes.  I got the gratin potato which was still pretty good.  However, if they ever offer scalloped potato as on option, GET THAT!\n\nA few tips:\n--The first time I came here I ordered a fish dish.  Do not go to a steak house to order fish.  It was mediocre.\n--Order a glass of red wine to go with the steak.  It pairs nicely and is well worth the money\n--Make reservations.\n--I've never had the ribeye, but my friends have said it was good.\n--This place is a bit uptight for me (everyone seems fancy and the place has this quiet atmosphere), but I do enjoy the food.", "author": "Carrie L."}

Looks like Gary Danko or Masa's would have been a better but I'm happy to say that at least we gave it a try.\n\nFor a top of a line steakhouse, one has expectations.  My simple request?  Keep up with the times.  Sure, I'm all about the environment because it adds to the experience.  But when you see paint chipping from a wall, bathrooms that are two decades behind, and wood varnishing that needs to take place, one starts to wonder.  I do, however, have to say that the lounge was quite comfortable and the perfect place to mingle with a good social and younger crowd.\n\nOur service was good and the environment not too noisy.  There was a dull drone as dinner parties took to their own decibel level and most of the clientele this evening were the 40/50+ crowd.  I like to eat my steak when it is not too noisy so it was perfect.  I ordered the Rib Eye, requested rare.  This came accompanied with sauteed sugar snap peas and a baked potato.  While the peas were pretty amazing, they were a bit heavy handed with the oil as it left a slight slick on my plate.  The steak?  Pretty good, even though I found it slightly more gristly and fibrous to my liking.  The last Rib Eye I had was at Ruth Chris and that had literally melted in my mouth.  This one took a little more effort.  Otherwise, at $43, I would not order it again.\n\nAt $9 a bowl (and it was a large large bowl), skip the potato with black truffle soup unless you and your stomach are most inclined.  Otherwise, it was a pretty dense and extremely rich soup, made even worse with the delightful pieces of bread that kept on keeping up with my empty bread plate.  The waitstaff here are spot on.\n\nTwo other orders in my party:\n\nPrime Rib\nRare.  Amazingly soft and tender, despite my friend's statement that Morton's gave them a larger cut that covered the entire plate.  I was nonetheless impressed with my sample.  It melted in my mouth.\n\nFilet Mignon Rossini\nRare.  A good thick filet (could have been slightly larger) topped off with grilled foie gras and black truffle, drizzled with a cabernet sauce.  He was quite pleased with his order and even though I'm against the harvesting method of foie gras, my first ever taste of it now makes me understand why one would order it.  It was a pretty amazing nibble of the exotic and the rush of flavors on the palate: So so rich.\n\nLast but not least of all, was our dessert.  Our party had done research on Yelp and we decided on the Baked Alaska and was not disappointed.  A lovely and cute display of flamed meringue piped around ice cream in the shape of a mini bee hive.  Flanked by caramelized slices of banana and drizzled berry/chocolate sauce.  I savored this, with each creamy and sugary decadent bite,  It was enough to set me into a blissful food coma.\n\nOverall, for a large tab, we were happy and left with more than half in leftovers.  However, we did agree that the steaks were not entirely out of this world.  I did appreciate that you could walk in off the street in sweats and pick up a few choice cuts for a simple dinner at home.  Something I noticed while waiting in the lounge.  Now that is an option I'm willing to try one of these days  :o)", "author": "Miika M."}

No rezzies, just walked in one early evening after meeting some friends at a neighborhood bar, and boom,  quickly seated and got the same service as the posh older couple sitting next to us, who coulda easily been residents down the block on Nob Hill.  That should warrant a fiver alone but it gets better:  the food.\n\nClassic Steak House and nothing makes me feel more American than dining at one of these joints.  Anytime I ever leave the country, one of my first meals back is usually at one of these classic steak houses.  My blood just craves it and I miss it terribly when it is not available.\n\nStarted with the Sweetbread appetizer and it was so proper with the accompanying mushroom sauce, so good together.  The texture had a nice crisp from a light flouring and the interior was a soft as custard.  Maybe a tad under seasoned but the sauce more than made up for it.\n\nNext we got the soup of the day (Lobster Bisque).  Not a chintzy cup but a full restaurant size bowl.  This with some bread should be a worthy sensible meal for most, but on this day, for us, there were no skimping to be had.  I conquered the incredibly rich soup with zest and the strong lobster essence just resonated for hours in my head.  That's when I knew I had something special.\n\nNext came my Bone-In New York Strip.  Dry aged and grilled over intense Mesquite heat the menu claims.  Now I've had thicker, meatier and more intense steaks but this by no means was disappointing.  It wasn't the thickness or the inherent flavor of the beef itself that raised my brow, but rather the expertise on how it was cooked.  Aside from the deft touch of perfectly seasoned beef, the crust was almost perfect.  Slight crunch and a blend of sweet and slight bitter from the caramelized char, that is reminiscent to a good cr\u00e8me brulee crust.\n\nAnd to add value to their already decent priced steak (somewhere in the $40's) it came with 2 sides.  Now that's unheard of at most steak houses of this quality.  I can't help but cringe at most a la carte places where a $50 dollar steak does not include a potato.  Always an un-American concept to me, but here at Harris, I applaud them.\n\nService was fit for a king without being kiss-assy.  Like going to a friends house who really thinks about their guest.  From our professional server who always made sure we were good, to the bus team that clears the plates, replaces silverware and dousing my potato with creamy butter.  Just perfect in my opinion.

Whenever he and I go to dinner, we laugh at each other's plates because I want my meat well done and he wants his medium rare. The Caesar salad was the only thing I didn't like, it tasted like they has over done it with the pepper. I'm all for a little pepper but don't over flow my salad, ended up nibbling but not finishing it. \n\nParking - I did 5 laps around and couldn't get a spot anywhere.

It was a busy night, but we managed to find a pair of seats at the bar top. We let the time pass, as we enjoyed our cocktails. Before we knew it, our waiter came and escorted us to our intimate booth. I really liked the old school, but elegant environment. I could tell that the restaurant has been around for quite some time now. \n\nA brief look at the menu and we decided to get oysters on-the-half-shell for sharing and I got the porterhouse steak (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FqYg7BcsryLFiUTknxpQpw?select=rb6NgczcfWh0DcHZ0TY8uw). The oysters were tiny and accompanied by three different sauces. One was a white wine based sauce, a cocktail sauce, and the third was an Asian-influenced sauce. I didn't like any of them. My porterhouse steak was very large. I wish I tasted the butter mixture prior to spreading it all over the steak, because it left a very salty after taste in my mouth that I did not like. The steak was tender; however, it wasn't the best steak that I have ever had. The vegetables were green and crispy and the scalloped potatoes were good.

I've been here several times before, but it's the first time for my folks. For me I've never really had a bad experience. For my folks, it wasn't a great first impression.\n\nUnfortunately my brother went in shorts, and we ended up sitting in the Piano lounge. While I had no problem with that, it was also my first time dining at that section. I think our general consensus was that it was loud, too loud. I don't think it's necessary to rebroadcast the live band through the loud speakers, and granted I don't think they were awful, they weren't the best either. I felt like the instruments were plenty loud to fill the room with something far more soothing and less intrusive. My second issue is the dimness of the piano lounge, it's just too dark. I had issues seeing the menu, and I don't mind the dimmed environment, but it felt like someone just forgot to turn on a few lights. So ambiance wasn't the best.  I much prefer HoPR.\n\nFor me, I get the same things over and over regardless of who I'm with. Eagle Rare Manhattan, and the executive cut. The first time I've ever had a Manhattan here I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I would probably come back for just the Manhattan itself, and they're pretty consistent with it time after time.\nThe executive cut is pretty consistently too, it's very tender and it cuts like a hot knife to butter. I don't think there's much to be said that hasn't be said already, pretty convinced you're not going to come here and get someone awful.\n\nAs for service, it's your typical 5* spot. It's good, not sure what else to expect when you're paying 20% tip on $70+ meal per person, so it better be good. \n\nWith that aside, the honest reason I come here is to avoid the wait at HoPR. Reservations are reasonable, and I can get seated pretty quick, not to mention it fulfills a craving. And over the times I've been here, I've met people waiting to be seated for that very same reason. \n\nI am convinced aside from atmosphere and going to a different steakhouse for the sake of going to a different steakhouse, the 4-5 most popular SF steakhouses are about 90% the same.", "author": "Wilson T."}

It's definitely an upscale, classic steakhouse with old school charm, but I have to say I wasn't blown away by the ambiance or the food. The lighting is dim, which normally I like, but it also didn't feel \"warm\" which was kind of a bummer - something about the lighting is depressing, though.\n\nWe started with the crab cakes, which leave a few things to be desired. They came out lukewarm, were \"bready\" tasting and the seasoning wasn't quite right. We both ordered New Yorks - his was the \"49er cut\" and mine was the petite cut. In terms of flavor and tenderness, it left some things to be desired. It was seasoned well and had melted butter on top (can't go wrong there), and came with a choice of potato and seasonal veggie. I liked that they dress your potato in front of you, but didn't like that the seasonal veggie was snap peas with a few shreds of carrot on top. Odd. We did order a side of creamed spinach, which I would recommend ordering. \n\nIt was my boyfriend's birthday dinner and they brought out a birthday dessert - a mini-ice cream sandwich (looked like a whoopie pie) with mint ice cream in the middle and choco cookies on the outside. We also ordered the bread pudding that came with cinnamon ice cream. I have to say, the desserts were the highlight of the entire meal. \n\nWorth trying, but I would probably order the prime rib or ribeye next time, or.... choose Alexander's instead - just being honest!", "author": "Kristen S."}

Service is good and the waiters and bus boys are awesome!  Reservations can be made which is a plus.  One thing I like is your steak comes with sides.  Most fancy steakhouses you order sides. I ordered the peppered ny steak and it was really good. Flavorful and it came with buttermilk mashed potatoes and green beans and carrots.  Overall presentation was nice.  However quality of the meat was ok and not worth the price but you pay for the ambience I assume.  My husband ordered the filet minon but it was bland and not as tender as I expected.  Overall is a nice place to go on a date or to celebrate a special occassion but I wouldnt go there again.", "author": "Thuyvi M."}

If you want an old fashioned steakhouse by the truest sense of the word that look no further. This place looks liked it was plucked straight out of Humphrey Bogart's old classic movie \"The Maltese Falcon.\" We're talking dim lighting, roomy leather booths, and martinis at the bar with a live band. \n\nI came here with a bunch of buddies for dinner on a guys' night out and we all thoroughly enjoyed the masculine ambiance, stiff drinks, amiable service, and well executed cuisine. By no means is it anything cutting edge here, just your traditional \"steak and potatoes\" fare here. But I also believed that even simple things, done very well, can soar into the extraordinary. So in summation, if you're looking for a solid steakhouse experience without all the bells and whistles all the \"trendy\" restaurants are trying to emulate, Harris is the place for you.", "author": "Derrek O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-07-06", "description": "Classic in all the right ways.  I came here last night to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and we both had a great time.  While this place opened in 1984, it feels like a truly classic steakhouse from the 60's.  No trendy San Francisco foodie nonsense, just good classic meat and potatoes done well.\n\nAll of the staff were quite attentive and professional, especially our exceptional waiter.  For dinner, I had the 49er cut (a large NY) with scalloped potatoes, steamed snap peas & carrots, and a side of Bearnaise sauce (always appreciated when enjoying a nice steak).  The girlfriend had the petite filet which as she said, there was nothing petite about it.  Both steaks were cooked perfectly as ordered, and the accouterments all were exactly what you'd want/except without any annoying \"twists\" that are so common in the SF dining scene.  The only complaint as far as the food is concerned is the pre-dinner bread was a bit lackluster.  Oh, and the Eagle Rare Manhattan I enjoyed before the meal was spot on. \n\nThe only small complaint I'd have would be the atmosphere.  The decor is great in a classic way, the booths are comfortable, the wait staff are professional, and the patrons...well, let's just say you'd think you were eating at one of the tourist trap restaurants in the wharf if you looked around at who you're dining with.  Tourists in blue jeans and t-shirts, kids, people getting up and asking other people to take their picture while sitting in their booth, and so on.  I got the feeling that we were the only locals in the place, except for one older couple.  The older gentleman was also the only other patron in the place outside of myself who was wearing a jacket.  Maybe it was just an off night, but that just doesn't feel like the right kind of crowd when you're celebrating a special occasion and paying $100+ per person for a meal.  \n\nIt was a great meal, and I love that they've not given in to all the various dining trends here in San Francisco, but I just don't know if I can justify the price that they're charging, when you realize all of the amazing meals that you could have in San Francisco in that price range.  For a quiet upscale restaurant to celebrate a special occasion I'd recommend Spruce, but for a good simple steak, atmosphere be damned, Harris' isn't a terrible way to go.", "author": "Joshua W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-05", "description": "I've tried to make several reservations at this place for weeks, and it seems that the only available slots are either at opening (5p.m.) or near closing time. I always prefer to go places where the service and food will be the freshest, it creates a better experience. I made dinner reservations for 5pm and my friend and I were celebrating an occasion. I will break down my entire experience and meal:\n\nI arrived before my friend did, he eventually showed up 30 minutes later. I felt bad that the staff were waiting on me and my friend. So I ordered the Whisper Dry martini in gin. Honestly, I didn't like it too much, as it wasn't dry nor stirred. My normal aperitif is a dirty vodka martini, which I should have just ordered. The table crackers and butter they serve are really good though\n\nOnce my friend arrived, we ordered our meals and split a bottle of Cab Sauv, 2009 Rafanelli. Being a huge wine connoisseur (more like snob and perhaps alcoholic), I've had many of the bottles on their wine list. I can honestly say, the markup is between 300%-500%, but the international wines are actually where you'd get the most value, as their markup were below 200%. \n\nI had the wedge salad with chef's choice dressing. It was fantastic. Nothing much else to say, although it needed a bit more dressing, and the presentation could have been better.\n\nI had the filet mignon in medium rare. Now, this is probably my biggest gripe. As a caveat though, this is in my top 5 filet's I've ever had. It had the potential for the best. The outer portion of the steak was perfect, but the closer you get to the middle, the more rare it became. The filet did not have an even distribution of heat on it, the focus was on the edges. It was rather disappointing that the more I ate into the steak, the worst it got. It became more chewy and rare. At that point, I should have sent it back, but I never complain when in a restaurant (even if it's awful because I'm afraid what they will do to my drinks/food), only afterwards on yelp. Regardless of this pickiness, it was still a great filet. I had the house potato, and it was superb along with the vegetables. \n\nFor dessert, I had the baked alaska with an arberg 10. Both phenominal, the scotch was actually priced well. The alaska was tasty, wasn't overly sweet, though the shell was a bit bland.\n\nThe service was top notch, my wine/water glass was never empty, the server was patient, and memorized our orders and was very prompt when drinks were ordered. \n\nFor a $300 meal, I felt that it needed a long detailed review. The steakhouse a few blocks up might better overall, and the value there is definitely better. But you can't lose going to either.", "author": "Phan H."}

The sauce was rich and velvety and paired well with the juicy fatness of the steak and foie gras combo. \n\n-Cheese scalloped potatoes- It was okay. I liked how they really layered the potatoes in there but it could have been more creamy. It also had a pungent taste to it which I wasnt crazy about.\n\n-Baked potato- The plainest baked potato you have ever set your eyes on! It was literally a baked potato on a dish and then a server came with my option of dressings: sour cream, horse radish and chives. Really?!\n\n-Meyer lemon baked alaska with lemon ice cream and sponge cake-  I really like this dessert because it was the lightest dessert my friend and I spotted on the menu. It was complex with many textures and it went from warm to cool as u dived into the the ice cream center. This was the perfect ending to our meal.\n\n-A  to Z Pinot Noir- This was recommended by our waiter.

One of the best perks is the $10 valet parking which is the reason we ended here after trying to circle endlessly around other steakhouses.  But back to the most important part which was the food.  For those that want a more traditional steakhouse with wood paneled walls and more formal waiters, this is the place,  For those that are more into ambiance, atmosphere, and innovative appetizers, you might lean towards Alexander's.  Both in the city are needed, but push comes to shove, all I care about is a really well cooked juicy piece of steak and this is where this place shines so an ever so slight nudge to Harris Steakhouse as the best non-prime rib steakhouse in San Francisco.  If you all want to take me to Alexander's or House of Prime Rib though, I would have no objections either though.\n\nP.S. To management, just some slight touches you should keep in mind if you want to be up with the Gibsons' of the world.  Someone should probably be manned at the host stand at all times.  And even though service is over, the bill is paid, and you are about to leave, it's ok to allow your waiters to smile and say thank you.  Just makes the customer feel that it was a little bit less of a transaction and a bit more of a human hospitality endeavor.  Only if you care about being the best.", "author": "Daniel Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-06", "description": "Okay so this review will be a little bit in the middle.  I didn't think it was as amazing as everyone else on here has ranted and raved about or even met the expectations that my friends have set for this place.\n\nFirst I do want to say it was a super classy place, and the ambiance is nicer than the Ruth's Chris down the street, and the staff is incredibly polite, friendly, and most important knowledgeable on the food they are serving.  I asked my waiter several questions about their cuts and what meat he recommends and so on., and typically I haven't encountered many waiters to really give a full 'accurate' description of what would end up on my plate.\n\nAfter looking up their menu online I had m heart set on trying their American Style Kobe 15 oz. Wagyu steak.  Now if you do not know what Wagyu beef is, it's a specific pedigree meant for the finest , buttery, tender cut you should ever experience.  Reason being is that in Japan these cows are literally massaged everyday, and limited in their use of their muscles yielding in an extremely tender meat. Anyways, I have always wanted to try a \"Kobe\" or Wagyu steak, however, many steakhouses have this so-called \"Kobe\" but it is not Wagyu.  So one of my spouse's first questions for our waiter was to find out if this was 100% Wagyu beef as it was stated at Alexander's Steakhouse in Cupertino that Japan is not currently exporting this cut right now.  Well, that was confirmed here at Harris'.  The steak is not 100% Wagyu reason, why they call it an American Style.  So these cows are not pampered the extreme traditional way that a Wagyu cow is such as being lifted up and carried to each location.  It's a hybrid of how we treat our cows in America with the Wagyu cut.  Well to me that is unfortunate, but it makes sense that is why that steak would only cost $78 bucks.  So, I didn't feel the need to really buy that steak as it was not 100% Wagyu.  Just a tip for anyone seeking the traditional Wagyu steak.\n\nMoving right a long, my spouse got the Maine Lobster and petite filet mignon, and I got the Filet Mignon Rossini.  For an appetizer we got the crab cakes, which only two come out, and the flavor was just okay.  You do get started off with free crustini's with special spreads, and for dessert we ordered the creme brulee. \n\nAnyhow, I was really looking forward to my filet mignon with the grilled foie gras, which the foie gras was AMAZING!!!  I wish I could say the same for my filet mignon as well as my spouse's, but there was just something off that wasn't our preference.  The texture of the meat was a bit grainy for lack of a better word.  I mean don't get me wrong it was melt in your mouth meat, but it was just a bit grainy, and not sure if that is due to the cows being corn fed, but I don't know.  You can also tell they cook their steaks on an open grill and may have a little mesquite smoke to it, something I could have definitely lived without.  I also didn't like the flavor of my steak, somewhat bland, BUT, I am not sure if that is our faults as we paired our steak with a Petite Sirah from Imagery Estate and it was incredibly peppery and possibly overwhelmed my palate.  Something that was nice is that the steaks actually came with vegetables and your choice of a baked potato or the evening potato.  Most steakhouses, usually charge an additional cost.\n\nAnyhow, I was disappointed with my food experience at this restaurant due to the flavors, however, the following morning, we heated up the steak with our scallop potatoes (it was the evening potato that accompanied our steak).  I would have to say the flavor was AMAZING the following morning and the texture was not grainy. So in terms of flavor the night of the meal I would have only given them a 3 star (foie gras was a 5 star though!!), and the next morning I would have given their steak a 5 star. So, I rated this place with a 4 based on the meal the next day.\n\nSorry for the rambling, but overall an a great experience, and I'll have to go back and possibly try their rib-eye which I think they are known for and review this place once again.", "author": "Angeline Z."}

I been to a few higher end steakhouses in the city and beyond so I'll write reviews for those as Well. Anyways... To be quite frank, I didn't care for the attitude the sommelier had as we were being seated. Both myself and my lady felt we were being ignored after we were seated. So the waitress was a youngish college type. She was mediocre, neither good nor bad. The place was pretty crowded with all types of people dressed from trashy cheap jeans to those dressed more formal like us. So.. I ordered my usual rib-eye, medium of course. My lady ordered her usual filet mignon  medium well. For a side we ordered creamed spinach, and onion rings to begin. Okay so the good... The creamed spinach was the best I ever had in a restaurant. Now I've eaten steak form here to Brazil. The onion rings were dry and flavorless. That was a disappointment to say the least. Now, if you say, now why would he order onion rings at a steakhouse? My response is, now why did said steakhouse OFFER onion rings? So let's get to the point. The Steak right? 1st off, the filet mignon. If was well OVERCOOKED. Even for a lady who likes her steak well done. I'm working on fixing that with her....LOL..So that was obviously a major strike. Next my steak, the ribeye, It was more close to WELL DONE on the edges and closer to medium in the center. So it was UNEVENLY COOKED. To add to this, it was much tougher than a ribeye should be. So that obviously is the kicker for me. To finish this, they acted like they were surprised when I payed in cash. They actually showed a little more respect after that. It was too late by then. The bill was less than $200 even with a bottle of wine plus 18% tip. I wont be returning there. To be quite frank, the House of Prime Rib just up the street has both BETTER QUALITY STEAK, and BETTER SERVICE. Bo Bo's has MUCH BETTER SERVICE as well.

I had the 27 dry-aged Bone-In Ribeye which was mouthwatering, succulent, and simply amazing. The steak was cooked to medium rare perfection and came with a dollop of butter which wasn't needed seeing as the steak was full of flavor. The marbling wasn't overwhelming and complimented the flavor perfectly. I didn't order anything else since I knew my stomach wasn't the biggest, and boy was I glad I didn't. I couldn't even finish the ribeye !\n\nMy friend got the French Onion soup as well as the porterhouse, which was humongous and practically had it's own gravitational pull. The soup was decent, maybe I'm simply not too big a fan of French Onion but I felt like it was salty and didn't have much flavor. His porterhouse, on the other hand, was delectable and melted in my mouth. I believe he got it one grade rarer than Rare, \"Blue\". I was skeptical as to how the chef's would come about this, seeing as meat normally cooks within itself as it rests, but the steak came out exactly the way he ordered it and even had the perfect sear to give it color.\n\nMy favorite part was that they didn't offer A1 steak sauce, or any other sauce for that matter. It means that they know their steaks taste good ^_^ I'll definitely come back here as my choice for steakhouses in the SF area, the service was good and the food was well worth it's price, even for a broke college student.", "author": "Desiree C."}

What I like about it is how it's a traditional steakhouse yet with a novel take on certain dishes while never losing sight of its ultimate purpose--delicious, high quality meat. Whenever I go to a steakhouse I always order French onion soup since I think the broth is a good measure of the quality of the restaurant. Also, it's tasty! Harris' definitely impressed, even though they served it in a plate without any croutons and minimal cheese. That's saying a lot, since I'm the kind of person that often puts more cheese on my plate than there is pasta...\n\nActually, here's what happened. I ordered the parsnip soup and the French onion soup for my friend, who doesn't eat vegetables. After sampling both, he demanded to switch with me, which we were both very happy with. Not that the parsnip wasn't surprisingly delicious, which it was, but  again--I love French onion soup!\n\nFor the main course, I had the filet mignon rossini and my friend ordered the Porterhouse. I've been to Ruth's Chris and the Prime Rib, and I have to say, other than their respective specialties (Ruth's Chris & ribeye, Prime Rib &, well...) Harris' blows both of them out of the water. I think its only true competitor would be Mastro's in LA, but Mastro's doesn't serve up grilled foie gras and black truffle with its steaks. The cabernet sauce was also delicious. I'm a big fan of foie gras, but if you're more focused on just meat, the Porterhouse could be a better option.\n\nAnother pointer: I've heard rumors that foie gras is going to be banned in the US soon (thanks to PETA), so get the rossini while you can!", "author": "Lana T."}

I read other reviewers about snooty ppl that worked there so I was rather intimidated to come here but mama wanted to come here so.... That's where we went. \n\nGot there with a reservation and got seated right away.  Granted we took half an hr to order cause my dad was parking the car (I mean.. It's nob Hill and frigging valet was 13 bucks!)  finally.. Dad comes in and we all ordered.  Wanted the ribeye cause.. Steak house... We get steak.  Seeing that the parentals and godparentals couldn't eat much,  the five of us ordered some appetizers and 3 orders for the frigging 20 Oz steak.  Steaks were pretty good.  Had a nice flavor and was aged well.  Steak tartar was pretty good as well.  Kinda different but not bad.  Uhm... Everything was just.. OK. \n\nNow,  ON TO THE SERVICE! our waiter was ok.. He wasn't as talkative with us like his other tables.  Whatever.  On to the part that REALLY pissed me off.  I couldn't wait for our waiter to grab our check and I gave it to this Asian lady with a straight across cut bangs.  I got.. Oh excuse me,  can you take the check please?  SHE GAVE ME THE DEATH STARE!!! I swear,  she was going to kill me.  I was legit scared.  It was unnecessary to give a customer that kind of attitude.  Trying not to be a douche but I was pretty upset so I complained to the... Who knows what.  Whatever a man in a suit is.  I told him what happened and he legit refused to believe it was one of his employees.  I mean....man... SHE WAS WEARING YOUR WAITERS OUTFIT! gargh.  Honestly,  house of prime rib,  I would never have this issue.  They don't make me feel like I'm undersressed.. (and a black sweater and dark jeans on).  Definitely a no ever go for me.

LITERALLY. \n\nI went with my boyfriend because of all the good reviews from yelp. Maybe they were treated better because of their age but we are in our mid-twenties and we were treated HORRIBLY. First, the server who puts the condiments on the baked potato made a mess all over our table, and did not even bother cleaning it up. Secondly, after our food was served, we were not checked up on until we had to hunt our server down just to get our check. We were also thirsty the entire time as we watched our server graciously check on the tables right next to us but ignored us as we tried to get his attention. The ONLY time our server came to our table was to give us the check, without even bothering to refill our empty glasses. \n\nMaybe the service wouldn't have bothered me as much if the food was worth the money, but that also was not the case. We ordered the filet mignon and filet mignon rossini, both of which were mediocre, and definitely not worth the money.

We took my parents here for a special family occasion and was so excited to treat them to this storied steakhouse. We walked into the bar -- totally empty at 5:45p -- and sat at a table to get a pre-dinner cocktail. The hostess walked by and loudly announced that we couldn't sit there and we should move to the bar. Rule broken: don't make paying customers get up and move around an empty bar when they are interested in buying a $18 martini. The bartenders and bar staff seemed shocked that this woman just yanked an order+ tip away from them. \n\nFlustered with her rudeness, I suggested we sit instead, early for our 6:45 meal. she walked us to our reserved booth and left the menus in a sloppy pile at the edge of the table. I was so appalled by her UNWELCOMING nastiness that I considered leaving right then and there. \n\nThankfully we didn't have to encounter her again and we had a classic steakhouse feast served by Michael G., a generous & kind server. Ordered some signature cocktails, a bottle of Louis Martini and a mass helping of sides to accompany our steaks. My petite filet was perfection, mom's Steak Diane was luscious, and Dad's NewYork a delicious throwback. Waiter Mike chatted with us about his wife and the holidays, and we savored our creme brulee and coffees after 2 hours of dining. Mike's grace almost made up for the rude off-putting hostess who started my experience off so badly. \n\nIf restaurants want to put extremely tall, lovely brunettes in their front of house, go right ahead... just be sure that they have manners & courtesy before you lose your customers to them.", "author": "Whit B."}

I thought Ruth's Chris was good, this place makes Ruth's Chris steaks taste like Black Angus steaks.

Both steaks were so very flavorful. The service is impeccable and the ambiance is perfect with live music. A little on the pricey side but definitely worth it if you love steak.

We also shared a bottle of champagne to celebrate my 21st.  For my dinner I chose the regular cut of prime rib & opted for the veggie of the day instead of the cream spinach along with my baked potato.  The prime rib was one of the best I had, though; my brother got the bigger cut, yet I had way more fat on mine then his.  My aunt was the odd-ball and opted for the Steak Diane over the prime rib; I had a taste of this & it was good as well, the sauce was not overbearing, as I thought it would be.  For dessert I got the strawberry shortcake; which was constructed  differently (see pic) than most that I've seen, but was delicious with the perfect amount of Grand Marnier soaked in the strawberries and topped with creme fraiche & a cookie-like spoon.  \n\nThe service was excellent & attentive without being annoying at all.  The people at the front were very nice too.  I can't compare Harris' to House of Prime Rib since I haven't been to HOPR in years; but while HOPR may give you a little more (salad, popover with your meal) there's nothing like eating at Harris to make you feel classier.  The decor is a little old school; but it's timeless and makes me feel like a Haaavard yuppie (in a good way).     \n\nOh, and the bathroom is really really nice!

Either way, the food is ordered with the intention to share.\n\nFor Harris' Restaurant, I did most of the ordering.\n\nAppetizers:\nI selected crab cakes.\nShe selected steamed clams.\n\nSteaks:\nI selected a boneless Wagyu for her.\nI selected a porterhouse for me.\n\nThe food was very good. \n\nCrab Cakes - They could have been a touch hotter.  They were tender and good though.  I am still torn as to whether I think they would have been better with the red peppers.  At times, they overpowered the subtle flavor of the crab meat.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/3mhfe83\n\nSteamed Clams - The clams were very good.  They were one of the highlights of the meal.  The broth was a tad salty.  If they added salt, they shouldn't have.  The saltiness from the sea could have carried the dish. \n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/3f2ejvu\n\nSteaks - They were both enjoyable steaks.  We ordered them cooked to the chef's preference.  This was medium rare.  Both steaks had a very nice sear on the outside and were tender.  Overall, we enjoyed the Wagyu a little more.  It was so tender.  However, the strip side of the porterhouse was also very good.  I really do not think you could go wrong with ordering either steak.  While not up to top NYC steakhouse standards, these were very enjoyable steaks.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/44fguyc\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/3lg8jrk\n\nI was disappointed with their choices of sides.  They could add a few other options.  We both ordered the baked potato.  These were a little overcooked.\n\nI also ordered a side of mushrooms.

Big leather booths combined with sophisticated touches of the west create a comfortable room.  You are more likely to run into your parents or grandparents here than your hip best friends.  The bar area is nice and features a piano.\n\nOverall,\nThis is a top-notch steakhouse.  While it might not make it in New York City, it is a great place for the West Coast.

Sadly, he doesn't get to his beloved steakhouses much anymore, so for his birthday it felt high time to do him a solid.  I picked Harris', mostly because it's old school and had great reviews.\n\nBut let's be honest:  I went in knowing that some Friscans give good reviews to the old favorites mainly due to our incurable case of the schmaltz.  Sometimes the fact that we ate there with grandma or the owner knows our name makes a place 5 stars for us, but deep in our hearts, behind the denial and just past the townie loyalty, we know it's not.  Worse, some restaurants take advantage of us softies, riding the wave of bar mitzvahs and first dates of yesteryear as they serve up wilty lettuce with dirty fingernails and a sneer.\n\nNot so at Harris'.  IT WAS AMAZING.  The white cheddar spread that arrives with the bread was life-changing. And with every appetizer, salad, entree and side that followed, we were progressively impressed with the passion Harris' has for food and their sky-high standards.  I thought I hated creamed spinach!  Not so, apparently.  The Mr. loved his steak -- possibly a little more than he loves me, at least in that moment.  And I'm going to say that the perfectly-cooked salmon I had here was better than my previous best, at none other than Chez Panisse.  You heard me.  CHEZ PANISSE, muthas.  \n\nAlso, the service was bang-on.  When I finished my wine but the Mr. was lingering over his beer, the waiter insisted on comping me a half glass of wine, so the Mr. wouldn't have to drink alone.  He *comped* my wine.  Hello?  Is it me you're looking for?\n\nIt was all so impressive, and even a bit surprising.  Because you see (speaking of Lionel Ritchie) the last time I was at Harris', it was 1987, and I was wearing a pink foil gown.  And I'll bet my alabaster patoot that none of the other places I went to for my formals would be a place I'd enjoy eating at today.

I came here with my partner for a \"special\" night out on the town.  Harris' has been on my bookmarked list for quite some time now and we both felt like a steak so why not check it off the list.  I can't say it was a bad decision as I wanted to go regardless of what I had heard, but I've heard great things so all I can ask is... What happened?\n\nWe enter into a dark room with low lights and a meat display case to our right.  Not for the faint of heart, let me tell you.  Upon arriving we are promptly seated in a large general dining area with other tables filled to capacity.  Within 20 mins the room quickly clears out.  It was a late night reservation so the restaurant had to be doing something right.  I think I figured it out... they appeal to tourists off the main strip and close to several hotels.  The crowd was a mixed bag.  We came dressed appropriately in button down shirts with dark jeans and dress shoes, looking mighty dapper I might add.  The table to our left was a family of 4 - also dressed very nicely, but maybe a bit too much.  One of the two sons, probably 13, had on a count Dracula ruby-encrusted necklace straight from the Eddie Munster show.  The husband, clearly lost, wore his cuffed light blue pants with alligator dress shoes pointier than the wicked witch of the west. As Galifianakis would say \"It's a mess!\".  The table next to them came in shorts and backwards baseball caps with mickey mouse and sports teams sporting their chests.  BUT enough about the crowd... let's get to the food.\n\nKnowing that Steak houses are known for large portions and outrageous prices we decided to split a salad and go straight for the meat.  Bread came with mini crostinis and an amazing cheese spread. Yum!  The Ceaser salad was standard and although good, it felt a bit cheap and iceberg lettucey. Nothing to write home about.  Now to our steaks.  My date had his cooked perfectly, and mine was a bit overdone.  No going back at that point, other than waiting another 15 minutes for a perfect medium and a second steak.  Oh well.  I didn't mind, so I didn't mention it.  You got your choice of a baked potato or mashed potatoes and I chose the baked as my partner chose the mashed.  Both were good but a bit plain. I had asked for the works, with fixings of sour cream, and chives + a little bacon.  Couldn't hurt right?  That gave the potato the extra bit of flavor it needed.  What came with the steak dish is what shocked me the most.  The menu boasts a serving of seasonal vegetables.  I had no idea that snap peas would be served with my steak. VERY awkward.  It felt as if the chef had cooked too many snap peas from the employee dinner and decided to serve them on our steak plates.  How in the world does snap peas go with steak and potatoes?  \n\nAll-in-all if I wanted a TV dinner I would've stayed home.

Received a confirmation for the reservation, where in the email, it included the \"dress code,\" of which i did not see the restaurant regulate. This wouldn't really bother me except for the fact that i made my bf wear a collared shirt over whatever he usually wears. \n\nService was average at the beginning of the meal. What shocked me was other servers brought their patrons a little dessert with a candle for whatever reason, anniversary or what have you. However, it just never occurred to our server that he should do one of those courtesy \"what's the special occasion for todays outing etc..\" And here we are ordering enough food to feed probably 4 people... Way to make a person feel special on their actual birthday day. I don't even care about getting a complimentary ice cream or what not, just slap a candle on the bread pudding so i can make my man feel a lil more special on his birthday. Then, to one up this situation, i had to try to flag down the server to get the bill etc. etc. Basically after he took he order, gave two courtesy check ups, he was gone serving the table right next to us with his undivided attention. All we had contact with thereafter was the bread person, water person, person who collects the dishes, of which one of them was the one that handed us the dessert menu. I literally had my hands up a few times, said \"excuse me\" in a voice level to match that environment, in order to STILL not get the server's attention. I really regret that i didn't just use my outdoor voice to get his attention. Anyways, meal itself came out to be $240 before tip. Service cannot even compare to Alexander's steak house, which is why for our last casual meal there (@ alexanders), the server received around the same amount of tip that we gave this guy, for a bill that's a lil more than half of this one. Lucky for this guy, all the other people who helped us did their part, so he got his standard 17ish% from us (but i wish most of it goes to the rest of the crew). Definitely cheap for the amount we ordered at a place like that, but definitely not worth it for the food and quality of service we received that day. \n\n\n\n\nFOOD:\n\ncrab cakes- Tastes very good, not too skimpy on the crab. \n\nfried mushrooms- Very good. Dipping sauce was very good, asked the server what type of sauce it was and he said soy wasabi... didn't taste any traces of wasabi at all, so idk. \n\nsoup of the day: parsnip with black truffle soup. We liked this as well. I saw little dots of the black truffle, but couldn't taste much. Kind of tasted like a light cream chowder, nonetheless, I enjoyed it.\n\naustralian styled kobe (bf's dish)- Got medium, and I'm assuming that we should've ordered this in medium rare. It was extremely charred (extreme grill marks), steak was not juicy at all. Cannot tell the difference between this and regular steak (actually had more juicy steaks for a way smaller price tag).\n\npetit filet with whole maine lobster- Ordered a medium as well for the petit filet, extremely charred (extreme grill marks). The lobster was okay, steamed/boiled and comes with a side of butter, nothing special except for the fact that it's HUGE and i mean HUGEE. Definitely a lot cheaper than I thought it would be (that's a pro). Favorite part of the dish was the scalloped potatoes though. \n\napple brioche bread pudding- Loved the cookie crumbles and raisins on top. Personally not a fan of bread pudding, but the bf is. \n\nglass of cabernet from south australia (forgot what it's called)", "author": "Tina S."}

I got there early since I didn't have a reservation and also parking near here could be challenging.  Of course when I arrived I was promptly ignored by the older staff at the reception area until a young lady showed up and asked if I had a reservation.  Having been tipped by other Yelpers I knew they had some nice tables near the bar, sure enough got a great table since they are empty. \n\nI got their special martini which is kind of nice with an orange twist.  Since I love sweetbread I got that as an appetizer, steak tartar could wait another night.  The Porterhouse steak serves as my meat dish.  \n\nThe sweetbread was very delicious with a cream sauce and was quite a hearty portion for sweetbread.  I've tried other places in town that charged twice as much for the same portion and was not as good.  The porterhouse was equally impressive with good dry aged flavor and tender.  The steak was perfectly cooked except for a small part near the edge of the tenderloin that came out a little dry(which is understandable).  \n\nOverall this place is exceptional for steak.  The service was good and the bartender actually came over when he saw that I needed something.  Most places would ignore you since he wasn't my server.  The food was exceptional and next time I might try the rib eye steak since I heard it was pretty good.  Of course you do pay for it since it was $91 including tips.", "author": "Jim J."}

The food was good, but I cannot help but to give them 2 stars because of what happened during dinner. \n\nSo we ordered red wine and were enjoying our family time as we just got married this weekend. The food comes out and one of the waiters knocks over my dad's wine glass and the red wine gets on my husband's shirt and the seat. Then the waiter tries to put another plate on the table and knocks over my husband's wine glass. So the table is bloody red and my dad's dinner got covered with some red wine too. The waiter, I'm pretty sure, panicked but he did not give us an apology and just left.  Our actual table waiter kept telling him \"it's ok, it's ok\". I understand he was trying to calm the waiter but to us it was not okay! It is red wine! And we are from out of town and cannot take the shirt to cleaners right away as we need to travel back home. \n\nFinally the restaurant manager comes out and gives us a very brief apology with her business card, offering to pay for the cleaners or to replace the shirt.  \n\nBut that was it.  No offer to make the drink free or to give us free wine or desserts which usually happens at a nice restaurant like this.  My parents and husband are too nice to say anything and just kept smiling. I think they are lucky my family were just so nice. \n\nAnyways, I felt upset about how they dealt with this situation and am writing my very first review ever on yelp. I'm never taking my family or friends back there again.\n\nWell, it is over a week since we were there at the restaurant. And I am updating my review.  I am now giving 1 star for the terrible customer service. \nBecause my husband's red wine stain could not come off, we went to get a new shirt. At that time when the waiter spilled red wine all over our table, the manager by the name of Elise Mitchell, came to us with a very brief apology with her business card, she said to let her know for any damage. So this past Saturday, I emailed her with the attachment of the receipt. \nI did not hear back from her for a few days, so I called the restaurant on Tuesday night (11/3/15).

To start off, we were served Crostini with cheese spread and warm Pain Epi supplied from Acme Bread Co., both were good and the latter was exceptional with its crunchy exterior and fluffy texture.\n\nNext up we had the traditional onion soup and the daily special mushroom clam bisque.  Both were well done and I especially liked the bisque with the copious bits of clam and smooth mushroom flavor at the end of each spoonful.\n\nNow, the entrees - Steak Diane, Pan Roasted Breast of Chicken with a Sherry glaze, and Atlantic Grilled Salmon with Champagne sauce.  Wow, just...wow.  The execution of these dishes was simply extraordinary and the chicken and salmon, in fact, have set a new personal standard against which all future poultry and fish dishes will be compared =D\n\nThe filet mignon was literally melt-in-your-mouth and perfectly complemented by the cognac and shallot demi glace.  The chicken breast was so juicy, rounded out by a delicious, zesty seasoning.  Finally, the salmon was so tender that it had an outright creamy texture to it upon first bite.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the Guinness Chocolate Cake and Classic Creme Brulee.  The cake turned out to be only okay - somewhat bland butterscotch frosting and dry texture.  The Guinness ice cream though, was fantastic and tasted exactly like the stout: no more, no less.  The creme brulee was very smooth and creamy, but I would've appreciated having it served colder rather than at room temperature.  \n\nLastly, the service here was some of the best I've seen yet: extremely well-mannered, great awareness and timing with orders and refills, and even the maitre d' and bread/water server came by to ask how our food was!  Suffice it to say, Harris' was by far one of the most impressive meals I've had in recent years and I look forward to my next visit.\n\nBest impromptu steak dinner ever ;)", "author": "Eric F."}

What's better than that?\n\nI came here around two months ago with my best friends and just HAD to have the Filet Rossini before the foie ban (T_T tears!) \n\nMy meal consisted of:\nAppetizer - Veal sweetbreads sauteed with shitake-sherry cream sauce. The sweetbreads were very tender and practically melted in my mouth. \nSteak - Filet Rossini. It was cooked nicely to a medium-rare and every bite I took was heavenly. I only took three bites and already had a mental tantrum that this dish will no longer be served...\nDessert - Some berry tart thing. By this time, I had already injested a few glasses of wine (the three of us polished off 2 bottles!) and wasn't that interested in dessert. I think my berries were too sour?\n\nI think I've lucked out with awesome servers lately. Service was AMAZING. She was amiable and super friendly.

We ventured to SF  and planned to eat at the House of Prime Rib. Little did we know, the reservations were booked 2 months in advance?! We had to yelp for other steakhouse options in the Nob hill district but the valet boys gave us an option of Harris down the road and noted that it was as exceptionally good.\n\nI had the aged prime rib and my bf had the aged porterhouse, both accompanied with cream of spinach and mash. Buttery melt in your mouth, aged steak, you never want to switch to regular steak, GOODNESS!\n\nThough, our server became inattentive and overlooked our table by the end of our meal. We kinda felt outraged, robbing us of an overall outstanding meal at Harris because we waited 15mins to get our check.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-29", "description": "Harris' was chosen for dinner our first evening in SF and what a welcome it was.\n\nI purposely selected this restaurant as it was described as being very similar to one of my favorite Chicago restaurants, Joe's Stone Crab.\n\nI anticipated greatness and was not disappointed.\n\nUpon walking in, one can tell that Harris' is an expense account kind of place. It's very clubby and old-school in its decor and menu, and I expected the service to be along the same lines.\n\nWe were seated at a booth for two and the waitress greeted us almost immediately. I was instantly struck by how non-stuffy she was. She was enthusiastic, laid-back, and very personable. I knew we would be in good hands.\n\nMy dc ordered a martini and it was served with the extra in a cute little bucket with crushed ice. I love little details like that.\n\nWe mulled over the wine list and asked our server for recommendations and finally went with a Paraduxx Cabernet/Zinfandel blend. I had a hard time not downing the whole bottle, but I wanted to save it to be enjoyed with my dinner.\n\nFor starters I ordered an iceberg wedge salad. Sounds pretty boring, right? Not a chance. This huge wedge of lettuce had the most amazingly yummy dressing, which was a ranch dressing with chunks of goat cheese and fresh chives on top. Iceberg lettuce is the most appropriate choice as most other lettuces could not stand up to such a heavy dressing. My dc had a mixed greens salad with smoked trout and hazelnuts and a raspberry vinaigrette. He ate every bite so I assume he loved it.\n\nMy typical steakhouse selection is a bone-in ribeye, partly because it's so flavorful but also because it's huge and I love the leftovers. Since I was on vacation and thus had no need for a doggie bag, I opted for a filet mignon. I almost always shy away from this cut as it can be rather boring, but the waitress assured me it would not be bland and also would bring me a side of mushroom-cabernet sauce on the side to liven it up.\n\nMy dc ordered a \"Harris\" steak, which is a bone-in NY and we both had baked potatoes on the side and shared a side of creamed spinach. A baked potato is not something I typically order since I can have one at home anytime, but something told me that this place would execute it perfectly.\n\nOur steaks arrived and they were cooked exactly as we specified. The baked potatoes (which naturally came with all the fixins) were flawless, and the spinach had bits of roasted garlic in it. The filet was indeed flavorful, but it didn't stop me from liberally slathering the mushroom-cabernet sauce all over it. Had I been less ladylike, I might have licked my plate clean.\n\nDessert was almost out of the question as we were stuffed. But only almost. We went back and forth and decided against anything chocolate as it would be too rich after that feast, so we opted for a lemon meringue tart.\n\nA silky and mouth-puckering finish to a terrific meal.", "author": "Melanie S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-04-11", "description": "THE SHORT: Award winning beef, family owned ranch, excellent wine list - go!\n\nTHE LONG:  I could have laid down and died here.    \n\nI agreed to Easter dinner with some of SF's finest, before knowing they were taking me to Nob Hill's finest steak house: where big eyed boys with big wallets sit in big brown leather booths and buy big -n-old cuts of big deal beef that still has that big blue stamp in that big white strip of fat you can see in that big glass case - and it's served on a white plate so you can see bloody streaks ooze with every slice of the big knife... and each bite drips big drops and these men in suits just throw their ties to the side all wide eyed til that first bite when their eyes roll back in their head like they're gonna seize but they just keep eating long after you hear their buttons popping because it's that quiet - until there is absolutely nothing left on their plates but a big bone or puddle of - blood - and a grin on their face.  Sophisticated? Sexy? Repulsive? Demonic? Debatable!  How did I get myself into this?  \n\nI didn't get to weigh in because I was notified via OpenTableNow -reserved seating for 7 - huh?  The group was growing and now so was my anxiety.  I've had a few dinners that have left me thinking my friends were possessed after swallowing massive chunks of steak tar tar.  Slightly intimidated by beef in the raw, I called my mom who assured me \"it will be fabulous.\"  I tried to negotiate brunch instead but she insisted - you're going!  I hung up, read some Yelp reviews, and then played w/ the idea of ordering lobster or even salmon Rossini style (foie gras on top) - embarrassing.  I resolved to stand my ground,  withstanding my companys' bloody judgment - beef medium-well & doubtfully sharing - critics can kick rocks. \n\nValet outside greeted us at the door with a Cheshire grin.   I tried to ignore it but when the ma\u00eetre d took our Mag of champagne, I couldn't help flash some teeth back.  Catching a shivering glance of the cuts in the case and a few larger uncuts aging in the glass wall, my heart gave a beat, but my mind won- oh yeah, this was going down- but my way. \n\nInside, the beauty and charm is dark, but classic chandeliers light the room, leather studded booths decorate the walls, and candles bounce just enough light off of each glass to put a twinkle in your eye.  It didn't feel like home or even the inside of a romantic 5 star but it was comfy w/ a tinge of stuffy that a glass of wine would fix.    \n\nWe arrived at our table where my boys had been patiently sipping Eagle Rare Manhattans that smelled of trouble but tasted like poetry.  We moved to oysters, salmon, deep fried mushrooms, and cheese - washed that down with a crisp bottle of Sancerre Le Rochoy - alright for white but I was ready for champagne.  Wise guy forgot to chill it so I waited patiently.  I'm not an oyster enthusiast, but I enjoyed mine best w/ the soy ginger - very clean.  One of my boys eats oysters regularly sucked one down and spit out \"spectacular.\"\n\nThe beef:  the waiter discretely asked each of us how we'd like it.  I ordered the filet [my way] a la mode aka Rossini:  12oz filet mignon (butterflied) drenched in a rich black truffle cabernet then topped with a slab of foie gras.   They must have triple dipped this little goosey piece in ghee three times before grilling because it buttered my beef in a way that allowed my teeth to be lazy.  Whoever says the first and last bite is always the best hasn't hit this.  I can't promise, but I'm pretty sure they do it like this in heaven.  I ordered a salad - will skip next time.   Wavering between the baked and scalloped potatoes, not wanting either, I settled on baked.  The waiter ended up bringing me both - very sweet.  Drank Brown Estate.\n\nOthers surprisingly ordered Scottish salmon, foie gras entr\u00e9e (off menu item), more beef, and a whole Maine Lobster.   Ma's lobster weighed in around 2.5lbs - 3lbs and she generously shared - the flesh was sweet & fresh - didn't need butter but who eats lobster without butter?  Not me - dunk it, throw your head back and let it slide.  Saving room for dessert, I ate just enough beef to finish my gras, boxed with my loaded baked potato, a meal of it's own- junked the scalloped. \n\nDessert:  You want that chocolate cake w/ champagne - too inappropriate to talk about here.  The key lime pie sounded so good in their groans that I snagged a bite before remembering my mango allergy - I lived to tell the tale (bang'n) and warn you not to order the huckleberry bread pudding w/ lemon ice cream that sadly sat to my left.  Great idea but execution lacked everything stimulating in dessert - from texture to taste. \n\nBottom line: If you have a little bloody meat anxiety, I sincerely encourage you to relax, and make the trip to Harris'.  Don't be embarrassed or make a loved one or ten experience this without you.  Trust me - I am not one of them.  You will not only survive but maybe even want to lay down & die here.", "author": "Rayna A."}

Got seated in a corner, which was nice since it was roomier. First thought was the green leatherette bench style seats. Ok, maybe it's the style here, not really into it. The host was nice, but the whole atmosphere made me feel a little young, it was filled with older people (45 and over). That's fine, it is Friday night, maybe the younger crowd are out at drinking. Ordered the Harris steak in-bone N.Y. Steak with expectations matching it's cost. First cut, tough, tough, why is it tough? This steak is 55% over priced. What happened? I ordered it medium rare. The whole experience went downhill after the first attempt at cutting into the steak. I'm not sure if the excessive need to chew drained the savory flavor I was expecting. The wine was great, a Cabernet the host recommended. But if you're going to price something the same as a steak from Mastro's Steakhouse, make sure it doesn't fight back when someone puts a knife through it.", "author": "Jan R."}

Do you love fine dining, and don't mind spending about $100 per person after a round of cocktails, oysters to start, salads, wine to accompany the meal, petite filets all around, and maybe a few desserts and coffees to finish the night? If money grows on trees for you, and you have an appetite for some fresh beef in a dark/elegant steakhouse, Harris is the place for you.\n\nLucy made our Christmas Eve dining experience the best. She was sharp and witty. She even responded well to my father's typically annoying behavior when we dine out. \n\nStart the night with a martini. Gin, vodka, whatever pleases you. Your drink comes in a small class container on ice to keep it nice and cold. Then, don't pass up 1/2 dozen of the oysters. Yum. For the main, my personal fave is the petite fillet...a hearty 5-6oz portion of deliciously seasoned steak. It comes with veggies and a potato (baked, or chef's choice), unlike other steakhouses where EVERYTHING is a la carte.

You can carry a conversation with no difficulty.\n\nPro - Many restaurants are unable to seat 12 of us during the prime dinner hour; however we've never had that issue on Christmas Eve. at Harris'. \n\nWe sat in the overflow banquet section. Nice round table seating all 12 of us. (Just an observation - the room noticeably not as crowded as years past due to the economy. Several emptied tables around us as the evening progressed). \n\nGreat selection of meats cooked to order; several choices of desserts that all tasted good; strong coffee; nice house wine; and nice pace of food. Table cleared promptly. \n\nBetween all of us, it was either the porterhouse steak, the prime rib, the petite fillet mignon, or the lamb chops. Something for the carnivore in all of us. \n\nEvery entree came with veggies, and choice of baked potato or mashed. \n\nNice offering also - 1/2 order salads so you don't need to split a regular salad into two. \n\nMost memorable starter - the special seared ahi.  The best flavors ever. It was fish; but in some way, tasted like meat. Definitely someone order this if available!\n\nHow much was the total bill for 12 people you're wondering? Well, if you have to ask, you may want to consider a less expensive place to dine.", "author": "Shirley N."}

The resourceful lawyer made back up reservations here so it all worked out perfectly.\n\nSince I was told that I didn't look as fat as a I have been feeling, I decided to go with the larger filet mignon.

But whatever, we decided to roll with it.\n\nBoth my husband and I had massive problems with the food.

Would have had a much better dinner at Ruth Chris's for the same price and it would have been fresh and perfectly executed.  Every dish I ordered had flaws - some minor (over-seasoned crab cakes, over-cooked beef smothered in salty sauce), some completely gross (potatoes that tasted moldy), and some insulting (molten chocolate cake that had no \"molten\").  \n\nWhat bothered us the most was how old, dirty and neglected the dining room was.  \nWe stared at cob webs and dust spotlighted on the silly shrubs they had in the center of the dining room.  How could the staff NOT see that?  It's obviously they've been there a LONG while.  I uploaded a picture.  If my crappy iphone camera could pick up the detail of dirt, grime and cobwebs in their dimly-lit room, I don't see how the staff could walk by it every day and not see it.

This time at Harris' Restaurant. There's some kind of magic to places like Harris' with regal interior embellishments surrounded by the dark wooden wall, live jazz, stiff martinis, delicious steaks right underneath the scent of the Christmas trees. I'm not sure if the drink was stiff enough or the lighting was perfect, but it made my boyfriend in his suit look like Cary Grant... and he's asian! How could that possibly happen? That's why I say it's Harris' Magic. \n\nWe had:\n\n- Famous Martini (one vodka and another was gin)\n- Petit Filet Mignon\n- Porterhouse Steak\n- Peppermint Cheese cake\n\nVodka martini went down like water which was dangerous. I love the taste of the olive soaked in gin so I opted for the gin.\n\nI'm not the one who can really talk so much about the steaks unfortunately, but I must say that I didn't leave a crumb on the plate. Petit filet mignon was a perfect portion for me, and I like my greens as simple and light for the change of taste. Now I took a bite out of the porterhouse steak - delicious. I had to take couple bites because it was so flavorful than my filet mignon. The peppermint cheese cake was just the right finisher to our romantic holiday. Lot more cheese tasting, slightly savory than the usual sugary cheese cake else where. I appreciated it but I can imagine will be people who  prefers the rich sugary sweetness. \n\nOverall experience was romantic.

Someone described the environment of Harris' Restaurant as that from the Great Gatsby and I couldn't have said it better myself. We made a relatively early reservation and were seated pretty quickly. There was crackers and cheese spread followed by bread and butter. Tried to resist but can't control a little carb-loving haha.\n\nI really wanted to try foie gras and wanted filet mignon. Figured I was being efficient when I ordered the filet mignon rossini. Plus, the waitress smiled approvingly after I ordered so I figured I was good to go. This may be preference but the dish was just way, way too rich. The foie gras topped on medium rare filet mignon(which I actually found to be a little tough) on a toast and then placed on top of cabernet sauce proved to be too intense for my palate.

I had put this place up with Alexander's as the top steak places i've eaten at in the bay area and i've been to a lot of them (Town, Bobo's in sf, Ruth/Chris, Mckormick's etc).\n\nI ordered the 16 oz bone in NY (the Harris cut). Though it was okay, it just didn't have the wow factor. I'm paying 49 bucks for this piece of meat and I expect it to be near flawless. It lacked a little bit of flavor. It was good but needed a touch more salt; just something to give it more pop to my palate. \n\nOur waiter was very nice. Unfortunately the service itself was less to be desired. I think the problem is that they seem a bit understaffed. That or the waiter wasn't on top of his game. Who knows. But he did ask if our steaks were prepared okay and they were. The biggest issue is that it took a long time to get our bill, then more time to give him my credit card despite me putting the tab at the edge of the table and him walking right past us. \n\nBottom line is that when I shell out a decent amount of dough, I shouldn't have to fight tooth and nail for service. That leaves a bad taste in my mouth. On top of that like I mentioned earlier, the steak from a scale from 1-10, 10 being spectacular was probably a 7.5 at most, maybe 8. \n\nHarris should take notes in terms of food and service from 5A5 Steak.

It was grilled to my liking--medium rare with tender pinkish red center. The steak was marinated nicely, and the sauce was delicious, and again, emphasis on it being SO TENDER! I also tried my sister's prime rib. It came out juicy and pink, but I guess the hot plate must have cooked it some more, so it got a little rougher than expected--but the flavor was still there.

So they let our table go, but was able to provide us with a lounge table asap, which was nice because the live band was in the same room. We started off with the cheese and toast, which was pretty good and the warm bread was delicious. Made a mistake as to eating so much of it because I was too full to finish my entree later on. I ordered a lemon drop, but I felt like it was still too strong of an alcohol taste for me. BUT, it came in a cute small container where it was kept cool with a mini barrel full of ice which I posted pictures of, which made it aesthetically pleasing. We brought our own wine and it cost $25 for the corkage fee. They had a nice container to serve our wine in too. We started off with Shrimp appetizers and crab cakes. There was a lot of crab in the crab cakes, but I was much more into the shrimp cocktail appetizer. The shrimp was big and good! The salad we ordered was interesting, because it wasn't cut into pieces, but large leaves from a cabbage which we cut ourselves when we got it. The cherry tomatoes it came with was super sweet, but too bad it only came with two pieces of those. We then ordered our entrees, which I split a executive cut of the prime rib (22oz) with my boyfriend, which was sooooooo filling for both of us each! I liked that even though we split the order, they gave us our own choice of potatoes (mashed, baked, or fries). It came with creamed spinach which was yummy and my mash potatoes was delicious. We ended our dinner with desserts of course! I had this apple tart which was WARM paired with vanilla ice cream, which I thought was the best of the three desserts we ordered. We also had the Eggnog Backed Alaskan which was good too, but I enjoyed my apple more. The chocolate molten cake paired with ice cream was good too. Service was excellent til the end, but I guess it was because they were closing up and we stayed a little more than half an hour since the restaurant closed.

It's an old school steakhouse w/ dark woods, spacious booths and tables and a meat counter.  A valet parks your car, a not inconsiderable convenience in this part of San Francisco.  Or any part, for that matter.  Our experience was flawless.  We were seated at a table in a small library-like side room by the bar w/ built-in bookshelves flanking a fireplace over which hung a portrait of \"The Boss\".  We were brought toasted bread rounds w/ cheese and butter while we perused the menu.  We decided to share a spinach salad, a petite boneless New York steak, the bone-in ribeye and a side of creamed spinach.\n\nService was attentive, w/ water glasses kept filled and bread brought.  Both the waiter and the busser were present and available.  The waiter even was able to answer Alan's query about the Raiders-Jets game this afternoon.  The couple at the adjacent table got involved in the discussion, he being a Jets fan while she was a Patriots fan.\n\nI started w/ a gin martini, de rigeur for a steakhouse.  It was good.  We placed our orders, both steaks ordered medium rare since we were sharing them.  I ordered a baked potato and Alan requested onion rings rather than a potato, a request that was generously accommodated.  The salad arrived split and was not only delicious but substantial, w/ lots of baby spinach, sliced mushrooms, pitted kalamata olives and sweet yellow pear shaped tomatoes lightly dressed w/ a tasty vinaigrette.  When the steaks arrived I cut the baked potato in half, giving one half to Alan.  Butter, sour cream and chives were offered.  Rather than 3 or 4 onion rings as Alan had expected, there were probably close to a dozen of them on the plate.  I had a few and they were crisp and good.  The steaks were accompanied by lightly sauteed green beans and carrot strips.  Both steaks were tender, flavorful and cooked medium rare, the New York a little firmer than the ribeye.  The creamed spinach was tasty, w/ a hint of nutmeg.  Around 6:00 a pianist and bass player started playing in the bar, sounding very good.

The pepper steak was delicious, with its crispy peppercorn crust and creamy sauce, the whipped, buttermilk mashed potatoes were excellent, and the snap peas were provided just the right amount of buttery crunch.  But then there was the service, which was honestly outrageous for a restaurant of this caliber.  \n\nA.  We made reservations for 9 PM.  We showed up at 8:45, hoping that by some small miracle we would be seated early.  We weren't, which was fine.  But then . . . 9:00 rolls around.  And then 9:10.  And then 9:15.  Meanwhile, nothing is said to us and the hostess either ignores us or gives us a placating smile when she passes.  Fine, I get it, sometimes, even with reservations, a restaurant gets backed up.  But at least fucking apologize or make some acknowledgment that we're waiting around with our thumbs up our asses.  \n\nB.  After waiting over 15 minutes after our reservation to be seated, I was notably annoyed.  But ohhhhh, the waiting had just begun.  Because it took our server another 15 minutes to even come to our table!  What the hell.  \n\nC.  Admittedly, I liked our server.  He was personable and friendly.  However, he didn't check back on us after the food came.  Personally, I was fine with that because all I really wanted at that point was something edible in front of me, but if we had needed something, it would have been a problem.\n\nD.  All right, this is the strangest part of the evening.  So we're done eating, and we both had leftovers that we wanted boxed.  I had about half of my steak, potatoes and snap peas.  My friend had a small portion of steak and potatoes.  Our plates are taken and our server returns with a bag.  I peer inside and see . . . one box.  Well, that's weird.  Did they accidentally throw out my friend's steak because it was such a small piece?  I look inside the box, and there lie two bare, sad looking pieces of meat.  I almost broke down in hysterics to see that they had thrown out my precious mashed potatoes and snap peas.  Also, what the fuck were they thinking, packing two people's dishes in one box??  Even at a restaurant like Chili's or a diner, they pack each person's food in different boxes.  I mean, come on.  \n\nThe only positive thing I can say, aside from the food, is that when I complained about my missing potatoes and snap peas, the server came back with almost full portions of the sides (in two separate boxes now).  But really, it shouldn't have happened in the first place.  When I'm shelling out more than $80 on dinner, I expect better service.", "author": "Jenny R."}

The scallop potatoes is a must have! Out of all the steak house I've tried, Harris is at the top for now. I wanted to give this place a 5 star, but couldn't because of service.\n\nWaitress was very nice, but the guy that was checking IDs for a bottle of wine that my friend and I brought in was a real jerk. I forgot my ID so that was my fault. I quickly called my friend to see if he can bring my ID to Harris because it was a very expensive bottle of wine and it was for my friend's birthday. I explain to the guy that I will have a friend bring my id in. He explain that he can't pour it for me which i completely understand. What really bugged me is his attitude about it and that smirk on his face as if he caught me being underage. He came and check on me like every 5 minutes which was very annoying. I never even touch the glass or the bottle, it's just sitting there. It felt like I was in trouble and he's constantly watching me. I felt so uncomfortable. Finally when my friend came in with the ID, I just wanted to show him that I'm not underage, but he was no where to be found. Which was very weird because he was checking up on me every 5 minutes.\n\nLong story short, LOVE the food, didn't like that person who made me feel uneasy and uncomfortable until I got my ID.", "author": "Heidi L."}

We (my husband and I) have had much better steaks in San Francisco for lower prices. It's fancy but quality of food is not on the top. For example, I had Diane stake which was very tender, but the sauce was not a good match. My husband had a port-house steak, which was also soft; however, half of it was left on his plate - some parts were completely raw, and hi asked for medium-rare.

Honestly I wasn't expecting to be too impressed since I'm not as much of a meat eater myself, but I was willing to take one for the team.  I'm glad to have been wrong in this case.  \n\nThe food was exceptionally good!!  We shared the steak tartare appetizer which tasted so fresh and crisp that it could have been a salad!  He had the filet mignon and I had the bone-in rib eye, medium rare.  I feel that my rib eye came out a little more cooked than I wanted, but both were still tender and very juicy.\n\nI liked that Harris offers some alternatives to meat on the appetizer menu.  I was so tempted to get the mussels and clams, but after the Thanksgiving feasting, we decided to forgo another meal of overindulgence.\n\nThe bar was a nice place to relax with a drink before starting our meal. \n\nThe atmosphere was really classy and comfortable.

The d\u00e9cor is very classic American steakhouse, complete with dark wood, tufted leather booths, and chandeliers. The six of us were seated at a booth that really only comfortably seats four, so two of us sat at a small table they added that jutted awkwardly into the aisle.\n \nBefore we even ordered they gave us a complimentary plate of crostini with cream cheese spread. The spread was soooo good! (But really, put cream cheese in anything and I'll like it. Philadelphia roll, anyone?) I didn't want to ruin my appetite but I couldn't stop myself. They also serve the pain epi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FqYg7BcsryLFiUTknxpQpw?select=4uk2EKh5RA9YM4WjjiD88A) from Acme, which makes the best crusty breads in the city!\n \nI got the filet mignon Rossini (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FqYg7BcsryLFiUTknxpQpw?select=AXW2fqSqiAIJTt98hNRUOQ). It's a petit filet topped with grilled foie gras served with toast and a black truffle cabernet sauce. The filet itself was cooked perfectly rare (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FqYg7BcsryLFiUTknxpQpw?select=HEEmbY601A6IrWVJwroKfg), just the way I requested it. It was amazingly tender and required minimal chewing, just the way I like my steak :) Though it could've been seasoned more it was good with the truffle-y sauce. Maybe it's because it was grilled, but the foie was completely overcooked. The piece of foie on my plate was also substantially smaller than the other Rossini at our table.\n \nMy neighbour got the regular filet mignon with scalloped potatoes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FqYg7BcsryLFiUTknxpQpw?select=wPjsfCp_8kQxhytsIhqKwA). His steak was considerably larger than the one in my Rossini. His dish also came with snap peas, which I thought were better than the haricot vert in mine. And the scalloped potatoes... WOW! So flavourful and just the right amount of cream and cheese - definitely some of the best I've had! My baked potato only came with sour cream - no bacon bits, cheese, or chives :( My other friend got the prime rib (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FqYg7BcsryLFiUTknxpQpw?select=C5f5QxmI_8fafQT9hAYv6Q) and it was massive! I'm not big on prime rib but he enjoyed it, especially with the horseradish sauce.\n\nFor dessert our whole table shared a seasonal crisp (cherry) and Guinness chocolate cake. The cherry crisp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FqYg7BcsryLFiUTknxpQpw?select=7iUkOnUkFZ5yYYwpxoxBPg) was the better of the two. It was filled with super-plump cherries and buttery-goodness. The Guinness chocolate cake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FqYg7BcsryLFiUTknxpQpw?select=VZDX2c2wxX7tAQE8Dfkbgw) was decent, but nothing special. Though the Guinness ice cream made me pretty happy!", "author": "Steph L."}

When we first went to Harris, we were tempted to blow our money on House of Prime Rib instead, but we figure why not try something else? I can tell you, I wasn't disappointed with the results. \n\nThere were 3 things I tried on the menu: tar tare, Filet Mignon, and foie gras. All three things were excellent. I'll start with the tar tar. I've never had it before, and was a little reluctant to try, but I'm glad I did. The right mix of herbs and seasoning made it excellent, with or without their delicious bread. \n\nThen the foie gras. I love foie gras, and this was no exception. It was cooked to perfection, as my knife cut right through it. It had the appropriate texture, consistency, and taste, and I'd be happy to try it again. \n\nLastly, it was the steak. I order medium rare, and sometimes I find my steaks often not warm enough because they want to get the right level or rarity. Harris did not have this problem. It was tasty, and there was no need for extra sauces. The steak itself was great enough. \n\nIf you're willing to fork over the dough, I definitely recommend this place. Top the meal with a bottle of wine, and you have yourself a winner. Service and environment was also excellent. Our waitress was kind without being annoying, so I would definitely give her a shout out here.", "author": "Andy V."}

When his meal came out with all vegetables, no potatoes, the waiter immediately brought out two large side orders of potatoes, for him and the table.  A couple of us took our leftovers home, and they were packed very nicely.  As it was a friend's birthday, we got a free dessert with a candle and sang.  \n\nThe restaurant is very nice, about 10-12 seats at the bar with a lively bar room and two separate dining areas that were more quiet.  \n\nThe prices are high, and worth it.

I'd have to agree with some of the not so stellar reviews that the steak is passable but not jump out of the seat great (which it should be at this price). I suppose we're paying mostly for ambiance here, so if that's your reason, then that's a plus, I loved the mural paintings of city landmarks on the wall where we were seated (near the bar) and the live music was nice.\n\nFood-wise, it was ok. If someone packed this up to go and served it to me while watching football at a friend's house it would still only be ok. My ribeye cut was slightly overcooked (was medium to well done), and my friend's filet mignon was too rare (was too pink to the point of bleeding slightly). We both had asked for medium rare. It was only ok taste-wise as well. Borderline bland. I was tempted to ask for some A1 or something... which is damn near blasphemy for a legit steakhouse.\n\nThe scalloped potatoes were good, not great. We also ordered steamed clams which were tasty but they didn't even give us separate dishes to share this (we re-purposed our bread plates). We also ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms which were ok, but not as tasty as I thought it'd be. (They forgot to bring us this until I asked our waiter after receiving our main dishes).\n\nI do give them bonus points for seating us very quickly despite us doing a walk-in since we showed up over 2 hours early ahead of our reservation.

We shared a couple of crab cakes which were lightly breaded and was mostly crab not mostly breading like some other places. Scrumptious. \n\nI had the \"famous\" Harris martini - vodka is my preference. I asked what makes it a Harris martini and the choice of vodka or gin comes in it's own small glass carafe that has its own ice bath of crushed ice in a wooden barrel... very cute and chilled!\n\nMy honey had their famous Manhattan and it too came in its own ice bath... very smooth. \n\nI had the lobster bisque - the soup of the day - but I have to admit I was expecting it to be the classic, very creamy soup with chunks of lobster but it was more thin in consistency and not so creamy. No chunks of lobster either so bit disappointed...\n\nMy honey had a Caesar salad... he gave me his one long anchovy... acquired taste I guess. \n\nSo drumroll... for the main course... I had the bone in Ribeye - medium rare - cooked perfectly and delicious. I like my steak a bit more salted so I had to touch the salt shaker (sorry!) and my honey had the petite NY strip which was actually very lovely - not as chewy in consistency and cooked well... juicy, soft and I think next time I would order that. \n\nNo room for dessert!!!

Please, dont order anything more than medium-well. You might as well just not eat here if you are ordering well done aka overcooked.\n\nIf you have been scared to move down from medium-well, they cooked my medium perfectly. It was tender and juicy. Not so much red which is how medium should be. A lot of places tend to undercook when asked for medium, and it becomes more of a medium-rare. \n\nI was not a fan of the veggie medley though, don't get me wrong, it was cooked fine, but I just don't like carrots/split pea or whatever it was. \n\nMy GF had something that was good also. \n\nWe topped it off with creme brulee.

My review is based on the service compared to the spot on food from the culinary staff.\n\nOnce arriving - and finding a street spot less than a block away; we were greeted by the hostess who stated she could find a place for us in the lounge - which was perfectly fine. \n\nAfter sitting down, our party of three (3) - we were greeted by our server, Kevin, with a drink order - regular coke; anchor steam; and water along with a basket of bread being delivered. Kevin proceeded to list all of the specials - including entrees, salads, etc.\n\nThe drinks were delivered promptly - however, Kevin never came by during the entire dinner service again to ask about additional orders and only once for a second to check on us. Kevin would check on all of the surrounding tables - yet never would come over to our table.\n\nAfter reviewing the menu - we decided to order the Porterhouse; Executive on the Bone Prime Rib; and a regular order of the prime rib from Kevin. All of the menu items - came out perfectly; with all of the dietary needs being addressed perfectly - no butter on the steak; naked potatoe; etc. \n\nOur server Kevin - had a rather large section of 8 tables in the lounge area - and pretty much neglected us the entire time. While I realize we were not ordering bottles of wine; appetizers; salad's, etc it would have been nice to be able to order an additional beer or coke instead of just having one the entire meal. However, a $160 check for three people - while not ideal for Harris's is not a small amount either.\n\nAfter completing our meal; it took our server Kevin roughly 10 to 15 minutes to deliver a check - meanwhile he stopped by numerous tables; some even twice. It will honestly take me a lot to ever considering coming back after this service - i truly felt like a second class citizen.

But it was a good experience just to try it once. The steak is not a small portion either. Order also comes with mashed or baked potatoes & some veggies. We also ordered the Veal sweetbread as appetizer. That was also very delicious. And the cream of spinach was fantastci!! I would love to try the Diane steak next time.", "author": "Alyce l."}

The steak, which should have been the main event, was just fine, which in itself was a disappointment.\n\nI'm trying to work my way through the steakhouses of SF - currently Ruth's Chris is winning because of Dine About Town (absolutely fantastic value at $35 for three courses, though I wouuld definitely hesistate about paying full price), and Alexander's is a close second because of good food and great service.  However, I'm still waiting for that ah-ha moment with a steak - I've never had a steak where I take a first bite, my eyes light up, and I got omg!  \n\nHarris' has a good, solid steak.  It is cooked correctly (I always order medium rare), has a good texture, is juicy, and all those other adjectives one looks for in a steak.  For the price, though, I didn't find it all that much better than Ruth's Chris.  However, Harris' did the non-steak portions of the meal well.  \n\nWe were pretty excited about the cheese spread that came with the bread - quite a few steps up from plain old butter!  As an appetizer I had the oysters, which were fresh and  were fine taste-wise, but don't really compare to a seafood restaurant or someplace that specializes in oysters.  We ordered the creme brulee to share for dessert, which was also pretty good taste-wise, but doesn't compare to a french restaurant.", "author": "Cathy Y."}

The decor is very much a boys club and meat market, literally (there was a deli window with raw meat as soon as you entered the place, only put-off of the night). \n\nWe started with drinks in the bar. Wonderful drinks and a great jazz band. We ordered apps which came quickly. We took a bit too long at the bar and we were worried they would give up our reservation but the hostess encouraged us to take our time!  - Smoked salmon app was delicious and a bit big for two people. Drinks were tasty and liberal.  \n\nNext it was time for steak.  I encouraged my husband to get the Kobe steak as he'd never had Kobe beef before. I had the Filet Mignon, which was delicious or so I thought until I learned what delicious was. I had one bite of the Kobe beef and discovered pure bliss. I work in Finance and have had great steak before but this was absolutely another level. Wonderful wonderful. Too stuffed for desert but that looked good as well. \n\nWe will definitely be returning.", "author": "C N."}

When I pay more than $50 for a cut of beef, I expect steak perfection. I ordered a 24oz porterhouse, medium rare. It was served medium. Major fail. The perimeter was well done. Medium through-out the rest except right at the bone where it was medium-rare.  If I wasn't in a hurry, I would have sent the steak back.\n\nThe new york side had a lot of tough tendons. I struggled to to cut through the tendons with the serrated knife.  Place this upscale should be issuing the sharpest german cutlery.  The filet mignon side was melt in your mouth delicate.\n\nThe steak did have that dry aged flavor.  Bit gamey at the edges.\n\nThe best thing on the plate was the baked potato. It was cooked to perfection.\n\nThe decor is upscale, but dated.  Ambiance is good for dates. Hopefully the rest of the menu lives up to the high prices.\n\nService was good.\n\nI wouldn't go back for steak.

I came here to celebrate my graduation with my family and BF, and I thought it would be nice to book a place where everyone could get a really great steak and enjoy some pampering. \n\nWhile my BF was very impressed (he said he could tell it was a 'fancy place' because every time we were served it was a different waiter who somehow still knew who had ordered what) I was a little underwhelmed. \n\nMy steak, the filet mingon, was only okay. It was cooked well, but the outside lacked flavor. I hate to say it, but I've had better steak at a chain like Ruth and Chris'. The service also left me a little disappointed. While everyone was polite and professional, I didn't feel engaged by our waiter. When we're throwing down this much money for food, I'm used to being, well, waited on. I want suggestions and anecdotes and personal opinions. Instead I felt like he gave us the bare minimum. \n\nThree stars might seem harsh, but keep in mind I'm not holding Harris' up to the standard I hold a McDonald's. As one of the city's most famous restaurants, I expected better. That said, the food was still really good, and the restaurant was beautiful and the staff very professional.

Boy was I disappointed. I have to first say that this review does not reflect the food, because we only went to the bar. \n\nMy brother was visiting from Hawaii, and we thought it would be fun to take my Mom out for a drink and some live jazz before we set off for dinner. \n\nIt started off badly with the valet. Although it didn't seem crowded with cars, we could not find the valet attendant. Finally he showed up, but was not at all apologetic for making us wait and not very friendly. When we walked into the restaurant, nobody greeted us. We kind of waited and looked around, but when it was obvious no one was going to greet us, we found our own way over to the bar and sat down. The bartender was rather gruff, just placed 3 cocktail napkins down in front of us. No greeting, nothing. We sat there awkwardly for a moment, when I noticed that one of the lounge tables had opened up. Since this was a more comfortable option, we switched seats. \n\nWe waited some more for a few minutes (again, it was not very busy), and after a while a rather curt waitress came by and took our drink order. My brother asked her if they had Chimay blue, and she shot him am incredulous look and said 'no....just the red, which I highly recommend\". Whatever. So we got settled with our drinks and were listening to the jazz, when my mother said she was a little hungry. I looked everywhere for our waitress, but couldn't find her anywhere (this went on for over 5 min). Finally I was able to snag some employee (a rather pompous looking guy in a suit) and asked him what kind of nibbles were available. He seemed annoyed and said that all they had were the appetizers on the regular dinner menu. I said \"OK, can I look at that?\". Again, he seemed annoyed he had to work, but came back with the menu. \n\nWe quickly decided on the steak tartar and this came out pretty quickly. It was a nice presentation and very fresh and tasty. We ordered another round from our waitress. When she came back with the drinks, we had our camera ready and asked her if she wouldn't mind taking our picture. She rolled her eyes and sort of sighed, seemed totally put out and irritated that I asked, looked around and said \"um, give me a minute OK?\". Really? How long does it take to shoot one picture? Rude! We sat there waiting and waiting with the camera turned on and ready to go. Finally about 5 minutes went by and she still didn't come back, so we turned the camera off. Then she came back with an \"OK, I'm ready now. I'll take your picture\". There was no, \"so sorry about that....or \"thanks so much for waiting\", she was just plain rude and unfriendly. She reluctantly took the picture then went back to her tables. \n\nWhen the check came, she was suddenly a lot more cheerful and friendly, since it was tip time. We tipped her slightly over 20% (just because we didn't want to wait for our change because of the slow service) and left. \n\nFor that caliber of restaurant, I have to say I was extremely disappointed with the bad, unfriendly service and don't think I will go back or recommend it to any of my friends.", "author": "lani P."}

Party of five, online reservation, choices of either a cozy booth plus a chair or the round table by the kitchen; This party of five always requires elbow room, so there.\n\nStarters: everyone else had onion soup & deep-fried mushrooms.  I went with foie gras...fantastic!  Pan-seared melt-in-your-mouth buttery goodness of what I normally don't like: liver.  So good, even our 10-year-old loved it.  Yah, I should keep in mind those poor French ducks & geese, how they were subjected to forced tube-feeding torture.  To make it up....\n\nMains:  everyone else had salmon, Rossini (yah, more tortured birds), NY strip for KiT (tough guy steak for tough guy 10-year-old), and I went with the Wagyu.  There, \"American Kobe.\"  Them cows were pampered to death!!!  Offsets the bloated French liver choice, non?  Almost a pound super-marbled rib-eye cooked med-rare, but being it was a half an inch thick, should have had it rare, but no matter.  First bite wasn't impressive, which was bothersome for such an expensive cut.  Then I realized the steak knife itself was shredding the meat...criminal!  Good thing there was an extra butter knife.  No more rough surface area, the Wagyu stood out, and it was awesome!  The marbling was evident from the blade fully coated with beef fat shortly after use.  Yep, finished the whole slab.

The meat here is aged for weeks, so when it is perfectly cooked and seasoned it tastes delectable.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the ambiance and decor of the place. It is so snobby, dim, and stuffy. The booths need to be replaced and the tables need to resized so everyone is not so cramped against the table. \n\nAs for drinks, their wine list is on the expensive side for the wine selection. Napa/Sonoma bottles are marked up more than comparable restaurants. However, their cocktail list is grand! Everyone must try the Eagle Manhattan - such a great drink! You should consider bringing your own bottle and letting them charge a corkage.\n\nThe best cut of meat that Harris offers is the bone-in ribeye steak. The marbling of the steak really add to the flavor and the texture - it prevents the steak from drying out when it is grilled. The steak was the perfect medium-rare and was trimmed satisfactory. The mash potatoes were well cooked and flavorful.\n\nThe way Harris seasons their steak is the way all great steaks should be seasoned. Unlike Alexander's and Elephant bar, Harris seasons their steak like Black Angus - they barely season it at all. Salt and pepper is all that is needed. New Californian restaurants drench the steak in sauce and spices which hide from the flavor of the meat... yes there is flavor in a good piece of steak.\n\nWill definitely be back at least a couple of times a year!", "author": "Jason T."}

Great theme, considering that we would be heading to Yoshi's after dinner to watch Goapele. \n\nService was mediocre but much acceptable since the house was rather busy and our waiter sure wasn't slacking off.

The steak tartare has fought its way to my heart. I can't decided whether I like Bix's more or Harris' more. My Kobe was good but I prefer the porterhouse. Both steaks were tender and juicy but the kobe was a bit too fatty for my taste.

When we arrived, we were seated at a very comfortable booth.\n\nWe started out the meal with Manhattan style clam chowder and their complementary sour dough bread, crackers w/ chedder cheese/cream, cheese  and port spread.  The chowder was full of tomato flavor, the bread was warm and delicious and the crackers was great w/ the super tasty spread.\n\nFor dinner, we ordered the bone-in ribeye steaks, and had sides of creamed spinach, string beans and scalloped potatoes.  The steaks came out perfectly cooked.....juicy, tender and super flavorful.  The sides of creamed spinach and scalloped potatoes were perfect matches for the steaks.  The beans were good....but not the best that I have had.\n\nFor deserts, we had the peanut butter pie and key lime pie.  Both deserts were sweeeeeeet and sooooooo good that I could of have another serving.\n\nThe service was wonderful and the jazz music in the background made the meal memorable.\n\nAn old school steakhouse that lives forever!", "author": "Raider J."}

I can now check this place off my list although my meal wasn't everything I had dreamt it would be.\n\nHarris' was celebrating its 25 year silver anniversary and was offering a generous celebratory prix-fixe menu in honor of it. Had to get it.\n\nThey started us all off with the chilled vichyssoise. I then had the mixed greens salad followed by a lemon sorbet to cleanse the palate. About a half hour later I received my entree, the filet mignon rossini topped with foie gras and a black truffle cabernet sauce. The filet mignon was pretty good, not great, not memorable, not nearly as tender, juicy or flavorable as I had hoped. I also sampled a little bit of the boneless NY strip with the same results. My favorite part of the entree had to be the scallop potatoes. To finish off my meal I ordered the opera cake dessert which was decent but probably would have appreciated it more had I been a coffee fan.\n\nFunny note -- the murals on their walls depict a herd of grazing cows amidst a lush green valley. From our booth we could see a small calf staring straight at us with puppy dog eyes. I started feeling bad while eating my steak. Ha ha!", "author": "Erich D."}

Our anniversary comes along and surprise, surprise, he chose Harris' restaurant. Coincidence? I don't know.\n\nOn arriving, my boyfriend was lucky enough to find parking right in front of Harris' as opposed to paying $10 flat rate for valet parking which isn't bad because we've done it for Ruth's Chris. Very convenient.\n\nFrom the exterior, Harris' is more polished looking than other steakhouses on Van Ness like Ruth's Chris or House of Prime Rib. It definitely had the essence of high class elegance.\n\nTable for two. We were escorted to a booth but were given options to sit wherever we desired, of course we chose the leather booths! It was just my boyfriend and I but we like the extra space. Not only were they comfy but they were clean. Booths are really hard to slide into and the kind host moved the table for us to sit which was nice and they do it for all their guests that sit in the leather booths.\n\nOur waiter arrived with menus. All the waiters and waitresses in the restaurant matched with burgundy vests, white long-sleeved collars, black slacks and shoes. The servers wore more of a chef-esque outfit in all white without those hats.\n\nI'm underage and forgot that my boyfriend no longer is but water was served in crystal water glasses. They don't have ordinary pitches of water here, they're steel. We were given two different kinds of bread with cheddar spread and butter to start. I've never tried cheddar spread but it was tasteful.\n\nCaesar salad to begin. A lady followed with a large pepper grinder. It was really thoughtful of them because we had smaller salt and pepper shakers on our table that sat close to the candle. Still a very nice gesture.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the 49er cut while I got the filet Mignon. There's a 4 inch difference with the filet Mignon and the petite filet Mignon. I opted for the larger cut. Both were served with vegetables and a side of mashed potatoes or baked potato. We both got the baked potato. Places like Ruth's Chris have you order the sides separately.\n\nOnce the food arrived, our waiter told us the condiments for the baked potato were behind. I thought he wanted us to get up and get it ourselves and sure enough, another man comes with a serving metal tray with sour cream, soften butter, and chives. He gracefully put it on our baked potatoes depending on requests. \n\nI like my steaks well-done, and always get steak sauce with my steak. I still like the taste of the steak with sauce but let me just tell you about the steak alone. It is tender and juicy for a well-done steak, yes. I'm so used to dried, almost burnt steaks, haha. Even though I didn't need steak sauce to savor it down, I still like the taste of it.\n\nWhen we asked for A1 sauce, my boyfriend and I are so used to it given to us in the A1 bottle like most steakhouses but not at Harris', it's given to you in a gravy boat. Yes, a gravy boat.\n\nWe're always too full to get dessert but our waiter suggest we take a look anyway, which was really nice of him. The dessert list is really short but they have lots of wines and liquor but of course, still young (just a few days, literally). It's nice that they include the pastry chefs name in the dessert menu too, I'm not sure if they did that for the standard menu though.\n\nWe're all used to restaurants having the standard black \"leather\" guest check/bill presenter with the credit card holder sponsored by one a credit card company. Not at Harris', they have their own guest check presenters. Very nice touch.\n\nSome people might think that it's expensive which it is but you pay for what you get, really. The atmosphere, the people, the food. All excellent. I liked it better than Ruth's Chris quite frankly. We've paid more in other restaurants like Melting Pot which had horrible service, atmosphere, and food.. never again. But you won't get that kind of service from Harris'. They're top notch and one of the finest restaurants in San Francisco.\n\nUpon leaving, we were greeted goodbye by the host. They had toffee in a clear glass bowl with silver tong on a plate right beside it. No peppermint wrapped in plastic over here!\n\nOverall, great restaurant, great service, great food. \n\nThomas was our waiter and he was completely generous and not irritated by us. He helped take a picture of us as he joked that he was technologically impaired since I had an dslr, hehe. But he did just fine.\n\nYou can tell, we're new to this kind of service. Give us a break, we're 20. Or at least I am, lol.", "author": "Jessica R."}

Sadly, after last night, I'm not sure I'll go back.\n\nThere were three of us in our party, one from out of town. Texas of all places, where steak is sometimes served for breakfast to infants. We were celebrating a big event, and each of us ordered a different steak. While mine was properly cooked, the other two steaks were both over-cooked. Big time. How embarrassing to take a good friend to a steak place only to have their steak overcooked. Not to mention the fact that, once we told the waiter about it, he never came back to our table to check on us. Ugh!\n\nI believe if the only thing you're going to serve is steak, then you better cook your steaks right. Otherwise, there's really nothing left to order on the menu. If you do one thing, at least do it well....\n\nAt $42-$50 per steak, I would either like mine cooked the right way or I want the waiter to do something entertaining, so I can get my money's worth.\n\nVery disappointing!!!!", "author": "kim g."}

Harris' exemplifies these traits, and adds to them: dry-aged steak, live music, and old men. I'm ok with the steak and music, but this place must be a magnet for the grim-reaper.\n\nSet the demographics aside, and open your liver to the Eagle Rare Manhattan. If you like a tasty manhattan, look no further (it's too dark inside to see any further). Moving on, the Harris' dry-aged steak is phenomenal. I asked for medium-rare, and the steak was crawling on my plate when they brought it out. No big deal, because my knife and fork ensured it didn't get very far. \n\nGreat steakhouse, but the scene is a joke. You've got old men that reak of depends on one end, and a few younger yuppy guys on the other end.

Second, yes they did apologize but after 15 minutes waiting for my steak and seeing my bill, there was no adjustment made. (not that I was expecting one but considering how many times I've been here for 10 years), I've never experienced a steak dinner at a restaurant that DIDN'T compensate with either a dessert or something when clearly the steak was not made to what was ordered, a $55 one mind you.....\nAlso, I was disappointed with the flavor of the beef, rather bland, I soaked it up with my bearnaise sauce! \n\nOur waiter wasn't very attentive either, my mom had ordered a baked potato but she got the au-gratin potatoes.

Dark lighting, dark wood.\n\nService: friendly, fast, knowledgeable. I had a request for a candle since we were celebrating a birthday and it was perfectly done!\n\nDrinks: Tried their signature martini and the server was honest that the drink isn't anything all that different, it's just the presentation (they pour some of the martini in the glass and store the rest in this ice bucket).  Pretty neat, but it was just presentation. Drink was vodka.\n\nFood: Creamed spinach was good. Nothing earth shattering. Like what Popeye would eat.\n\nSteak: I ordered the Porterhouse and it was ok.  The filet part was good. It was juicy (it was overdone, but at least it was still juicy) and tender and so tasty. The strip side was somewhat flavorful, but overcooked, hard and tough.  So needless to say, I ate around the bone and left the rest for leftovers (not for me).  It wasn't bad, but I was surprised that my steak just wasn't cooked well.  I did ask for it Medium, which was supposed to have a warm pink center, but it seemed pretty dead to me.  So maybe you have to order it slightly under what the server says? I don't know. Disappointing. Given all the other reviews, I'd give them another shot, but wouldn't mind trying another modern steakhouse before returning.  My steak was ~$48, and the portions were quite large.\n\nIt's one thing for me to overcook my steak, but I just figured a steakhouse would have the most perfectly cooked warm centers of the steak.\n\nDessert of a chocolate, caramel cake thing was just ok. Tasted like it was store bought.  Ok, it's hard to taste store bought, but it just didn't taste like it was totally fresh and homemade...\n\nBest part of the food might have been the little crostini and cheese spread they brought before our meal.\n\nOverall, I'm not sure I get why this place is so highly rated.

The restaurant was not open, however, and we had to wait on the sidewalk with other early dining patrons which was an odd way to start the evening.  Even the valet staff was on duty, but the restaurant did not unlock the door until 4:59 (Our reservation was at 5:00).  It is not a customer friendly policy for an upscale restaurant and even more puzzling in that it is a missed opportunity for the bar.\n\nWhen we were seated at our table, the ambiance was very nice as described by other Yelpers.  I am a big fan of the dark, wood paneled, old fashion steakhouse, but the decor in this restaurant struck a good balance of traditional and modern.  It is worth noting that almost all of the tables in the restaurant are booths and the tables for 2 are quite small (although due to our early dinner, we were seated at a larger table, which we appreciated).  \n\nBefore I get into the food, I want to say that the service was excellent and in particular, our server, Lucy, managed to handle quite a number of tables, but was always available to refill our wine glasses or attend to other needs.  She was also helpful in answering our questions about the menu.\n\nThe menu is a traditional steakhouse menu with all of the popular cuts of beef, steak sauces and a few additional dishes for the customers who prefer something other than beef.  While we were looking at the menu, a plate of toasted bread and cheese spread was provided, which wasn't very flavorful.  Unless you are really hungry, you might want to skip this (they also provide a nice baguette with the meal).  I brought my own bottle of wine and felt the corkage fee was reasonable at $25.  The server decanted the wine and filled our glasses throughout the meal.  The wine list seemed quite sufficient and had a number of moderately priced options, but I already had a special wine that I wanted to bring and enjoy with our dinner.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer to share, which was the Veal Sweetbreads with a sauteed cream sauce.  The sweetbreads were well cooked and the mushroom sauce was flavorful, but the dish lacked a bit of a WOW factor that we had hoped for.  Very good, very competent preparation, however.\n\nWe also ordered wedge and spinach salads, both of which were good and not overly dressed.  When we were placing our order, the server suggested half portions of the salads, which was a great suggestion and delivered a perfect portion for our meal.  \n\nAs far as the steak goes, we both ordered the bone in ribeye, which is accompanied by potato and daily vegetable (Asparagus).  I had noticed that other Yelp reviews discussed the temperature of the steak preparation, so we made sure that we clarified how the steaks should be ordered.  Typically, medium rare is how I prefer my steak prepared (erring on the rarer side) and my companion prefers even rarer.  The server steered us to either ordering rare or Black and Blue (rare with a charred crust).  We both ordered rare and while I really enjoyed the steak, it was cooked more than what most people would consider \"rare\".  Definitely order an undercooked steak, if you don't like it too well done.  The baked potato comes with the typical toppings served table side and the potato of the evening, buttermilk mashed was well prepared.\n\nFinally, because it was a special occasion, I went for dessert an ordered Baked Alaska, which is something that I haven't seen on a menu in many years.  Knowing that it was a special occasion, they also served an ice cream sandwich with homemade cookies and an amazing chocolate sauce.  The Baked Alaska was good, but the cookie was even better!  A nice end to a wonderful dinner.  \n\nAll in all, a very good, competent steakhouse (except for the odd steak temperature  approach).  Everything was very good, but nothing was exceptional, except for the server, Lucy.  A good special occasion or business dinner location.  \n\nOne additional note is that they have live jazz music in the lounge, which we couldn't hear in the dining room, but looked like it was worth the trip just for the lounge.", "author": "David B."}

She grew up in San Francisco and always wanted to have dinner at Harris', but never got around to it. I have to admit that we were a bit disappointed with our experience at Harris'. Lets talk about first impressions. I absolutely loved the ambiance of this place. Harris' is old school San Francisco charm! As soon as you sit down you just feel good about life. Similar to how you would feel at House of Prime Rib or Tadich. I love the feel of San Francisco institutions. For an appetizer we shared the prawn cocktail. The prawn cocktail was absolutely amazing. The prawns were MASSIVE and so fresh. I've had prawn cocktail several times at different restaurants, but this was definitely the best. Now on to the bad news- our steaks. I settled for the filet and my mother ordered the ribeye. Although both were cooked to a perfect medium rare, the filet was completely bland and the ribeye was fairly gamey tasting. I've had aged steak many times, but never to the point where it tasted spoiled. We both had to salt and pepper our steaks for different reasons- mine was bland and lacked any flavor and she had to mask the fairly foul flavor in her steak. In fact the ribeye almost had the flavor of gamey lamb.\n\nAnyways, personally, neither of us found the experience to be worth going back for.", "author": "David D."}

Once I tore it off the bone - I did manage to restrain using my teeth - my mouth was treated to a perfectly cooked piece of beef that melted in its own juices.  Less spectacular and quite disappointing was the Kobe Style Wagyu Beef.  Although the flavor was there, the texture was far from what was expected.  The Bone-In Ribeye on the other hand was on par with the porterhouse. \n\nFor beginnings, I highly recommend the foie gras and the oysters.  The oysters were such a hit, we ordered two for a group of three.  An honorable mention goes to the smoked salmon.\n\nOf course, I always leave room for dessert!  In this case, it was a brilliant decision since the apple tart, carrot cake and ice cream trio were all amazing.  I was slightly distracted from the sugar and butter because of my glass of dessert ice wine.  If you can still put anything else in your body at this point of meal, order a glass, or two!\n\nOverall, a lovely dinner with excellent food and attentive service.  The atmosphere has a classy steakhouse feel of large booths, dark wood, dim lighting, a live pianist and large portions of beef. \n\nFinal thought - the steamed vegetables that fall of my plate as I slice through my steak, is a nasty distraction.  Vegetables should be treated kindly as well, or they don't belong in the dark shadow of my meat!", "author": "Steph T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-10-26", "description": "Sometimes you want to escape the uber-sustainable, uber-organic, ever-changing-menu locavore scene that has taken over San Francisco in exchange for a minor lapse of old school decadence.  The beef comes from out of state (Kansas and Nebraska) and eats corn instead of grass (which I'd personally prefer if I were a cow).  I have no idea what it is injected with and as I far as I'm concerned, it's high grade yummyness!  The menu is very low on innovation, but high on presenting excellent traditional steakhouse fare..\n\nFoie Gras: I'm normally not one to talk about portion-to-price ratios, but I have to deviate.  This was an insanely large portion of foie gras with two large livers, practically three times a traditional appetizer!  And the quality did not go down with the supersizing since the searing was perfect with the tender and fatty insides intact.  The toasted brioche was nice, but could have been a tad thicker so it isn't reminiscent of morning toast.  The orange marmalade added a good sweet contrast, but I feel the chef could have been a little bit more adventurous with a seasonal and/or non-traditional local fruit.\n\nSteak Tartare: Apparently they process a filet mignon to order and then add in the traditional spices.  I'm normally biased against machine processed tartare, preferring hand chopped, but the quality and freshness of the steak was so good I easily forgot.  Heck, this ranks in my top list of San Francisco tartares so I can only imagine how divine it could become with textured hand chopped pieces.  The crostinis are no frills, but do the job of starch support.\n\nPorterhouse: No innovation, just perfection.  Super fresh and high quality of my favorite cut (because you get basically two different cuts in one).  Cooked perfectly to your specifications.  No need for fancy sauces or even anything but the beef.\n\nOnion Rings: I liked that the batter was flaky rather than the fast food sheath of fried dough.  The onions didn't seem to be any exotic variety, just a simple yellow.  Would have been better if they concocted a sauce more exciting than Heinz ketchup.\n\nPotatoes Au Gratin: So even though the steaks are so good they don't need any accompaniments, you can be overly gluttonous and indulge in this creamy and cheesy delight.  The top has a healthy dose of gratin\u00e9ed cheese crust and each layer is a firm, yet supple blanket of thin potatoes with just the right amount of cream in between.\n\nBaked Alaska: For those who think fried ice cream (a la chain restaurant) is declasse, then Baked Alaska is the answer for discriminating palates.  Though an old trick, the seared meringue encasing the sponge cake and frozen ice cream is always a pleasant cross section of textures and flavors.  I, personally, would want them to swap out the banana ice cream because it's really not one of the tastier ice creams out there.  And besides, the caramelized banana slices on the side will give you your monkey-food fix! \n\nPeanut Brittle: Not on the menu, but at the entrance.  First of all, it's great to see a restaurant offer alternatives to the generic plastic wrapped peppermint hard candies or those germ-ridden bowls of candy coated chocolate mints.  This is the real deal, probably made in house because the ratio of sugar brittle to whole peanuts was off, made a much better munch out the door.", "author": "Adam B."}

Being on time isn't his forte, so unfortunately we were about 30 minutes late for our reservation (we called and let them know we were running late).  Despite our tardiness, we were seated as soon as we walked in.  We took a cab from downtown, but they have a valet if you are driving which is very convenient.\n\nThey gave us the dinner & wine menus and some toasted bread with cheddar cheese spread to nibble on while we chose.  We decided to order a bottle of wine and since their menu is so extensive, this took a few minutes.  After we settled on a bottle, we ordered it and the waiter said he would be right back to take our orders/bring the wine.  This is where my only complaint of the evening comes in - it took him about 20-25 minutes to reappear.  By that point I was pretty hungry (8 PM reservation + 30 minutes late + waiter hiding for 25 minutes = hungry Liz!).  When he did reappear, he had the wine and took our order.\n\nI had the chicken dish and the bf had the Harris' steak.  The chicken was fantastic - the sauce was delicious and the chicken cooked to perfection.  Matched with a baked potato it was awesome.  The Harris' steak was also delicious.  It is dry aged (apparently most steak is wet aged - the waiter was very help in describing the difference between the steaks).  That came with the potato of the day - potatoes au gratin - which were also delicious.\n\nBesides the great food and (almost) immpeccable service, the ambiance in Harris' is refined but not stuffy.

I decided to take a friend here for his big 30th birthday because he wanted to go to a real steakhouse and actually eat a proper steak. Based on the great meal I had the first time I came to Harris', it was a no-brainer to go here.\n\nThe service was adequate, but I was not impressed considering the price-point of the restaurant and what the cost of our meal would be in general. Our water was forgotten and wasn't given out until our main waiter noticed that we hadn't received it yet (even though we had already requested it from the busboy seating us). Speaking of which, we had several waiters throughout the night. And while none of them were rude or lacking, it didn't seem like there was one dedicated waiter to tend to our table. When my meal came out, which included a baked potato, it didn't come with any toppings and I was halfway through my meal before another waiter came by and asked me if I wanted anything on my potato. Better late than never? Maybe we just looked too young? We were certainly dressed better than most of the tables around us though... I think the \"dressy\" attire and \"classy\" ambience descriptions are taken very loosely (I saw jeans/untucked polos, tennis shoes, and 49ers sweatshirts).\n\nMost disappointing was my filet mignon steak. I asked for it rare, as insurance that if it was overcooked, I'd be okay with medium-rare. It came out medium-well, with some of the outside edge basically well-done. I'm pretty sure it was left out under the heater lights too long. The seasonining and taste was fine, but even the very center portion (which was medium-pinkish and not rare), wasn't the melt-in-your-mouth transcendance I remembered. Perhaps I've been spoiled by other places with excellent filets that Harris' is no longer special? Or maybe I really did just get a mediocre steak... The hassle of sending it back or just eating the well-done steak just told me to be happy with my friend enjoying his meal and not interrupt the pace of the meal by having to wait for another steak.\n\nMy friend's Kobe steak was out of this world good though. And at $190 a pop, it damned well should be. It was buttery, tender, and delicious. I'm not sure if it was worth the hefty price tag when that alone could get you an incredible meal at any respectable SF restaurant elsewhere. I'm sure it was a memorable experience.\n\nTo end the meal, we shared a creme brulee dessert that was standard; nothing amazing or bad to write more about. \n\nI think I would still recommend Harris' again as one of the better steakhouses in San Francisco; but I am weary of returning anytime soon. At least, not on my own dime. My birthday is coming up though....", "author": "Mercutio k."}

He made reservations at 8pm, we waited in the bar and piano lounge for about 10min, while we enjoyed a cocktail. \n\nWe were then seated in a warm and comfortable dining area, the whole restaurant has that 60's-70's feel to it.

Maybe not the best choice in coming the day after Thanksgiving, but I was taken out by a friend's family who were in town for the holidays and couldn't refuse the offer. What can I say, I'm a gluttanous pig!:)\n\nHarris' definitely lived up to the hype. The elegant setting had an intimate open dining room with several private seating areas. You can tell the staff  takes pride in their work as they come across as extremely passionate.\n\nOur table had difficulty choosing a bottle of wine from their extensive list, but the sommelier quickly and attentively came to our aide. He was like an artist with his descriptions and recommendations. After the meal, he even came back later on to provide a written list for recommendations for my friend's family trip to Napa for the following day. As our group was choosing the wine, I was trying to sway the group to try one of the Malbecs, The sommelier ultimately steered an '07 Lang & Reed Cabernet Franc from Napa. Everyone agreed it was the perfect choice.\n\nI ordered the Prime Rib medium rare, which came with creamed spinach and the choice of the scalloped potatoes as my 2nd side. The meat was served rare, but after my first bite, there was nothing that would have convinced me to send the meat back for further cooking. With fork and knife in hand, I was now like a wild protector of the food and intoxicated by its power over me (or maybe the alcohol from the wine was starting to kick in.....). The Prime Rib's destiny was now to the pit of my stomach. \n\nBoth the creamed spinach and the scalloped potatoes were cooked to perfection. Be warned people, this place is not skimpy on fat or butter. If you're looking to drop weight, stay away! By the end of the meal, I was way too stuffed to even think about dessert. The only thing I would have consumed at this point was maybe a handful of Lipitor. \n\nPerhaps if I had to see and/or contribute to the bill, my rating wouldn't have been as high.

I ordered a medium rare Harris Steak, which was tasty, esp near the bone.  The steak, however, was far from a cool red in the middle to edges.  I love steak, and I believe rare-medium rare is where meat really distinguishes itself.  \n\nMy expectation is that a steakhouse would take utmost care to assure accurate temperatures.\n\nGiven my table mates, I decided not to make a stink of it, and ate my steak - which was flavourful and satisfying, despite its overcooked edges.

The truffle steak sauce and foie gras used to only be offered with the Filet Mignon. It can now be added to any steak of your choice, 14 dollars for the foie gras and 10 dollars for the truffle sauce. This is rough 20 dollars more than what it used to cost if memory serves me right. The truffle sauce tasted like some sort of salty beef broth mixture with little to no truffle flavor. The sauce was clearly not reduced for long enough to properly concentrate the flavors of the broth, wine, and truffle. The portions of the foie gras was incredibly inconsistent, maybe the restaurant should start weighing their foie gras because my fiance's piece of foie gras was more than twice that of mine. The foie gras on the old Rossini used to nearly cover the entire piece of the filet, yesterday's covered about 20%. The meal overall was very disappointing and I will probably not be returning. Increased prices together with decreased quality will inevitably lead to disaster. Honestly the price would have been fine if the foie gras and truffle sauce were prepared like it used to be. Prices of ingredients are constantly increasing but a restaurant has to maintain the quality to justify their prices. As other reviews have said, you're probably better off not ordering this truffle sauce if you have memories of what the old Rossini used to taste like; you will surely be disappointed. Steak as usual was cooked perfectly which is why I gave the restaurant three stars.", "author": "Tommy L."}

Sophisticated, luxurious, impeccable. From the instance I saw the cuts in the butcher's window I was hooked.\n\nThe wine list was definitely award winningly extensive but I opted for a well crafted Martini instead. Not too many places I know are brave enough to serve sweetbreads. So when I saw that they offered them here as an appetizer, it was a no brainer. Cooked just right for a crisp yet moist texture, in a spectacular mushroom cream sauce. I was basically mopping up the sauce with every piece of available bread. Never have I seen a place that served NY steak in so many ways. I was in heaven. When I saw that they offered under the \"Classics\" a NY Pepper steak, with cracked black pepper, and a  brandy, cream and peppercorn sauce, I was immediately sold. What a steak it was, perfectly medium rare, spicy from the pepper, and rich from the sauce. Couple that with a decadent side of creamed spinach, only a lobster tail could have made this meal better. They did offer a whole maine lobster and clams but I figured that would have been overdoing it. Just a little bit.\n\nService was extraodinary and very formal. They definitely take things seriously here. Just being in the restaurant is a special occasion. Simply perfect all across the board.", "author": "Kim N."}

The ribeye didn't have to be swimming in butter to be rich and flavorful--it was so succulent and tender I thought I had cut off and was chewing on a piece of fat.  The baked alaska  encased in a meringue pillow was gooey, marshmallowy soft.  \n\nSERVICE:\nExcellent.  Right amount of check-in, efficient without being rushed and laughed at all my jokes.  \nME:  What's a blondie? \nFRIEND: You don't know what a blondie is?\nME: No, I grew up in a 3rd world country.\nWAITER: (Laughter, laughter)  It's like a brownie, but it's a blondie.\nME: Oh.

We can even pick off some half chewed mango pits left over from the other patrons' plates to give you that old home feeling.\n\n*I took some creative liberties with that last line, but the service was excellent nonetheless.\n\nENTERTAINMENT:\nSusan Chen plays jazz with her trio on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.  If you shut your eyes real tight, you can almost hear Diana Krall.  Well, not really, but if you think back to the first time you heard Krall's Live in Paris album and how awesome that was, you'll hear Let's Fall in Love in your head.\n\nAMBIENCE:\nOld world San Francisco with comfortable booths and beautiful woody interior.  Lighting just dark enough to be forgiving.  \n\nMISCELLANEOUS:\nValet parking is $10 and worth it as parking on a Friday night in these parts is virtually nonexistent.  \n\nThe peanut brittle atop the cabinet of displayed cuts of meat for sale is good and crunchy.

And yes, sometimes i secretly judge how the rest of my meal is going to go simply by how good the bread is.  And jesus, Harris' does it right.  Not only do you get a nice, perfectly crispy on the outside, soft & warm on the inside, loaf of bread with butter, you also get a plate of what i can only describe as crostini-like bread with an incredibly lip-licking delicious butter cheese spread.  Thats the best way i can describe it - butter cheese.  Its damn good.  I dont care what its really called.  Thats what i call it.  Damn-Good.\n\nNow for the steak.  Im no steak expert, by all means, but i know what taste good and i know what i like.  I went with the Harris' Steak:  a bone-in New York cut.  It was cooked to perfection and felt like butter on the tongue -- nice and flavorful with a chaser of baked potato.  Swoon.  \n\nA perfectly light pinot paired very well with my meal.

I can only imagine liking this place if I ate at Red Lobster most of the time and had lots of money. Oh, I'm describing yuppie transplants who moved to SF to be cool. Now it makes sense. \n\nIf you are hungry for a piece of cow made with loving expertise, spend your money elsewhere. The steak at Harris is far below average--it's marginally better than Outback Steakhouse or Sizzler, but that's about it. Don't expect a tender, juicy, perfectly prepared steak. I don't know how you can ruin a medium rare porterhouse, but they found a way to make it dry and tough. Like turning wine into water, they just do not do justice to the meat they carry. Not that that tiny porterhouse was much to write home about anyway. Oh, and the side order portions are also insultingly small. Some of the sides do taste pretty good, but I'd rather make a ton of scalloped potatoes at home than to pay around $6 for a tiny helping. \n\nHarris is terribly overpriced for the quality--not nearly as expensive as Morton's, but you get vastly better value at Morton's since they can produce a tender, juicy piece of meat. Harris' service is slightly above average, but it's less attentive than, say, House of Prime Rib. \n\nPluses: The wine list is decent. You can buy raw meat from their butcher--this way there's half a chance someone will do the meat justice. The decor/ambiance is very nice, which to me is the only logical explanation for all the positive reviews.\n\nDo yourself a favor and skip it.", "author": "Jeff K."}

The scalloped potatoes were a bit on the mediocre side, and the veggies were nothing special, but I didn't pay for it, so can't complain too much!

Our food was okay, the self-serious old-school ambiance was okay, and the service was okay. Sadly, not a single thing was excellent. That's the tragedy.\n\nMy $44 Harris Steak was a little chewy but heck, serviceable. (Sometimes you're just not in the mood to point out the imperfections, you know?) The best I can say about my wife's similarly priced filet mignon is that it tasted thoroughly okay. Nothing was wrong with it, but it was not special. It's a shame to pay $100 for two pieces of meat and feel unstirred by them.\n\nThe complementary vegetable side (stir-fried snap peas with shaved carrots) was truly tasty and gave the plate a little life.\n\nThe baked potato was just a little dry. I salted & peppered it and filled up on it. Like the steaks, it was serviceable. You could find a potato just as good at a well-managed buffet restaurant. \n\nI ate every bite of everything on my plate and reveled in the great company. The waiter was attentive enough and professional, with an antiseptic smile.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-10", "description": "I want to give this place 5 stars.  I really do.  I had a GREAT time here with 2 of my friends on a Thursday night.  So many aspects of the dining experience were top-flight.  And yet, the thing that matters most -- the steak -- was worst thing about it.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nWe came here with uber-high expectations, given its top rating on Yelp as well as elsewhere.  We'd also just come back from Las Vegas where we enjoyed a couple great steaks at Morels and Carnevino.  I guess we were spoiled beforehand, but we didn't expect anything less from Harris', especially after we entered the elegant oak-paneled dining room and sat down in one of the plush leather booths.\n\nOur appetizers were very good.  We opted for the deep-fried mushrooms (my favorite), the oyster platter, and crab cakes.  I thought the crab cakes were the weakest of the three, being breaded on the outside yet rather mushy overall.  A good crab cake should contain hearty chunks of crab rather than uniformly shredded crab; unfortunately, only the latter applied here.  My friend had a martini which was excellent -- and served in a wooden bath of ice, to wit.  True to their name, the appetizers built our anticipation for the steaks all the more.\n\nAmong the three of us, we ordered a filet, \"The 49er\" New York strip, and a bone-in ribeye.  My friend's ribeye was the best cut, marbled and savory throughout, and really quite delicious.  He asked for his cooked medium-rare, and although it was more like a medium, it was still plenty juicy and tender.\n\nI'd also asked for my NY strip to be cooked medium-rare, yet after my second bite I noticed it was still brown and hot right through the middle.  I'm not usually one to send back food -- in fact, I've only done it once before, at a Morton's in Boston when my baked potato was cold -- but for a $50 steak not to be cooked right, I was pissed.  Our waiter came by, heard me out, and asked me to cut my steak in half.  It was medium-well.  He apologized and let me know he'd bring out another.\n\n15 minutes later, my new steak arrived, this time more rare than medium-rare.  I don't mind rare so much, and it was certainly more tasty this way, but it still wasn't quite right.  My friends were almost done with their steaks by then, and I didn't want to be a spoiled Chinese Goldilocks, so I ate my steak as quickly as I could.\n\nFortunately, the meal ended on a high note.

Some of the best cake I've ever had.

The well done rib-eye and medium new york cuts did stay true to his recommendations. They were more than delicious. I had the rib-eye and it was sooo juicy and tender. The evening's potato, scalloped potatoes, served as the perfect companion to the steaks as well. \n\nThe homemade trio of ice cream was melt-in-your-mouth delicious too.

I have to believe so now because this location just didn't give me the same warm feeling. \n\nI brought ze bf here for his birthday because he loves himself a big slab of cow and we haven't tried it here. I've had the Harris' off I-5 and thought it was be just the same. Nah. I had the Filet Mignon, and he had the Ribeye. Our friends came along and they had the Harris Steak and the Pepper steak. Of the 4, the Filet Mignon was the best. it melts in your mouth. Everything else I think was left on the grill a little too long as they all complained it wasn't medium rare as ordered, but didn't want to be fussy about it since the service was already questionable.\n\nThe server did however drop off a scoop of ice cream with a candle for his bday since the little booger didn't want any dessert to celebrate. So kudos to Harris' or the server for that.\n\nThe check for 4 guests, including some who ordered soups, salads, and a bottle of wine to share came to a grand total to around $230.

There was a delay right from the start with us not being offered drinks.  Once we were, we ordered diet cokes.  We aren't cheap, we just aren't drinkers.  But the server kind of made this face and that dictated our service the rest of our meal I believe. \n\nThey provide you with a nice tray of bread chips and a delicious cheese spread.  This free bread ended up being the best part of the meal.\n\nWe ordered onion rings because my husband had them here before and remembered them being amazingly good.    They came out quickly and we were disappointed.  The breading was really thin and also inconsistent and some rings were two onions and some were one.  I would not get them again.\n\nOur steaks were brought out next.  I ordered the Peppered Steak medium rare and my husband ordered the special which was a grass fed New York Strip medium.  My steak hovered between medium well and medium.  My husband's steak hovered between rare and medium rare.  My steak was extremely tough and hard to cut.  I ate less than a quarter of it before I decided it wasn't worth my time.  My husband was dissatisfied with his as well.  Our server never asked how we liked our food, so we did not have the opportunity to call out the temperature difference.  He never even came back by.  We traded steaks to see if we liked the others better but at that point the mood was really ruined.\n\nIn regards to the other food we were served:\n-Seasonal vegetable (comes with all entrees):  Haricot verts and shredded carrots.  They were very good with a twist of salt and pepper.\n-Potato Side (choice comes with all entrees): Scalloped potatoes.  They were okay.  They didn't have a lot of flavor, but the texture was very nice and they had a certain creaminess.\n-Potato Side (choice comes with all entrees): Baked Potato.  Once again, it was just okay.  They don't top it until it's at your table and then you have to wait for someone to come by with the \"topping station\".  They had butter, sour cream and chives.  Because they waited to top it, the toppings did not melt very well.  The first few bites were good but the rest were plain and dry.\n-Saut\u00e9ed Mushrooms: My husband got these to accompany his steak.  At other places, we have enjoyed them in broth and seasonings. These were just coated in butter and some herbs. They were pretty plain.\nOverall service:  Slow\n-I never got offered a refill for my soft drink and it was empty for more than half of the meal\n-It took forever to get our check. We actually were going to give them one more chance to impress us by ordering a dessert, but it took so long (15 minutes) for them to come back that we decided to grab dessert somewhere else.\n-I assumed since the valet was through them, I could give the host the ticket when we were paying our bill, so our car would be ready for us.  I attempted this and the male host acted like I was doing something strange and said, \"Actually, you will take care of that through them.\"\n-I felt the tables around us were getting much better service than us, our server literally didn't check back our entire meal.  Who does that?\n-The ladies room was not up to the same standard as the rest of the restaurant.  There was an unflushed toilet, an unpleasant aroma and just an overall look of disrepair.  Note to the owner: Go to Home Depot and invest the $60 to get new toilet seats.  While you are there, pick up spackle and paint and fix the hole in the wall.\n\nI was really expecting a great experience and unfortunately Harris did not deliver on either food or service.", "author": "Kristen D."}

I certainly cannot complain about the food (except for the dessert, but that's likely bad ordering on my part). Overall the vibe is just a bit old world stuffy. \n\nWe had crab cakes for the app, probably the best I've had on the west coast. I opted for the special of the night which was filet medallions in a mushroom sauce. I love mushrooms especially on my steak, this didn't dissapoint. The scallopped potatoes were soo good. I was slightly jealous I didn't get to use the baked potato topping man but not really after I ate bite after bite of cheesey potatoes. \n\nAs for the dessert, I guess the moral of the story is don't order a fruit crips at a steakhouse.

Everything about Harris is very old school, dark wood paneling, low ambient music, and even the clientele is very  much a representation of all this.  A lot of them were from the 'mature' crowd, so if you're looking for the trendy hotspot to see and be seen, this ain't it.  However, it does seem to be the type of space where folks from the old- boys- networks are making multimillion deals.  Just saying.\n\nThe boy went all out and ordered the SURF AND TURF.  Basically it's a piece of filet mignon and a lobster the size of my arm.  The entire order was so ostentatious many people stopped to just stare at our table.  I ordered the FILET MIGNON ROSSINI with a side of mashed potatoes.  Call me uncultured, but this was my first encounter with REAL foie gras (not just pate), so I wasn't really expecting much, but it is very delicious.  Harris also makes a mean sidecar (as well as other cocktails).  Those drinks were incredibly strong.\n\nOkay, so now for some cons: I say delightful because it wasn't exactly perfect.  When I'm paying this much for a steak at this caliber of a restaurant, I expect my dish to come out exactly as I ordered.  I asked for a MEDIUM RARE, but they came out with MEDIUM WELL.  They overshot it into almost no pink territory.

I made reservations for 6:30 on a Friday night. Place was nicely decorated with Christmas items already, it felt very cozy and warm.\n\nFood was delicious and plentiful. We had the shrimp bisque and Caesar salad to start off. Salad was coated nicely, not too much or too little dressing and just the right amount of anchovies. My husband had the bisque, which I thought was good (salad, IMO was better).\n\nWe then went to the main course, my husband had the rib eye, I had the filet mignon with foie gras. Both were excellent and cooked the way we liked it (med rare). We didn't have any leftovers.\n\nNice, pleasant experience. Come hungry, you'll be sure to leave happy.", "author": "Jenny T."}

I feel like these people ate at a completely different restaurant than the one I went to. Maybe they were blind-folded and had their taste buds removed or numbed with an anesthetic...I don't get it. I am utterly shocked that they have 4 stars.\n\nMy wife and I went here while we were in San Francisco. Please understand that my rating is based on the fact that this is an upscale restaurant. If this were an outback, I would give it a 3-star. For the price, I would avoid this place at all cost. You really are better off eating anywhere else in the city. The food was mediocre at best. The service was mediocre at best. The ambiance was mediocre at best. One of my favorite things in these types of restaurants, aside from the actual steak, are the side options. The choices were limited and the selections we made were sadly mediocre with the exception of the onion rings. The onion rings were the best thing that we ate. I ordered a bone-in ribeye and the the bone (that typically runs along the side the entire ribeye) was a small shard of bone that was probably 1/2 an inch dangling to the bottom of the steak. The steak was thinner than I expected as well and the texture of the steak was grainy. This typically means that it was not dry aged properly and that the meat is just old. We were so excited to eat out that night too, and unfortunately, this place was the worst choice we could have made. \n\nDon't listen to the reviews in the magazines in the hotel. This is how we fell for it. The magazines in the hotel rave about this place. If you in the mood for onion rings that cost about 100 times more than what they are worth, then this is your place! If you want an actual nice steak dinner, then this is the worst spot for it. I hope this helps some one else avoid what we went through.

Portorhouse steak for the bf with scalloped potatoes (kind of like a potato gratin). My boss recommended this since it's a bigger piece of meat and has a bit of filet mignon on it\n2. The only chicken dish they had on the menu (ehh, it was decent but def not something you should order unless you're like me and don't eat beef)\n3. Spinach salad\n4. The soup of the day: Manhattan(?) clam chowder with a tomato base (interesting take on clam chowder. I prefer my creamy rich soup better)\n5. Cream spinach\n\nI don't eat beef but my bf said it was excellent. He finished it all and most of his meal. Everything else to me was OK. It was good but it wasn't like \"I can't stop eating it so i'm going to stuff myself silly.\" I know its hard for me to judge a steak house since I dont eat beef but i'll rate this place on experience.

Our server looked at us and gambled that we would enjoy a more casual style of service, peppered with dry witticisms. He was right! Lucky him!\n\nThe kitchen here is very accommodating. They will pretty much adjust anything, portion-wise, to suit your needs. For example, we were wondering how large the spinach salad was, to decide whether we would split it or order two appetizers.

What better time to open it than with some delicious aged steak!  (Corkage $25.)\n\nHarris' offered some delicious appetizers.  We ordered the sweetbreads and crabcakes - and both were fascinatingly good.  The sweetbreads were lightly layered with a delicious creamy sauce that didn't kill the subtle flavors of sweetbreads, and the crabcakes were fresh with a tangy sauce.  Perfect.\n\nI ordered the Filet Mignon Rossini - which was the aforemention filet mignon w/ truffle sauce and a hunk of foie gras.  I ordered this based on various Yelp reviews, but in hindsight, I would have been happier with a regular Filet Mignon, only because I tend to like my steaks without any sauce.  The truffle sauce was good - but so unnecessary.  I would have much rather had the steak and foie gras - NO SAUCE, and perhaps I should have ordered it this way.  One *ding* was that I ordered  \"rare\" as I always do with filet mignon and it was more what I consider to be \"medium rare\" at best.  Rob ordered the ribeye - and I thought it was very good, and cooked perfectly to the medium rare requested.  That said, I've had better ribeyes.\n\nThe service was excellent at Harris'.\nThe ambiance was exactly what one hopes for from a steakhouse.  With wood paneled walls, large and spacious booths, the dining area was nothing short of ideal.    The murals on the wall of grazing cows in green meadows was a classic touch.  You feel like you're in a different world once inside Harris'.\n\nThe steaks, while very good, were not stellar.  The menu was terrific, and not having tried everything, I'm comfortable with a four-star rating.  Though the appetizers almost made this dining experience deserve 5 stars, I expect to be wowed just a little bit more to warrant a true 5-star rating.  We didn't have dessert on this evening.\n\nTuesdays through Saturday, Harris' has a live band playing in the bar area.  The location is ideal of business dinners, but the ambiance also makes it an ideal date location.  I'm not sure how loud it gets on weekdays, but on a Sunday night, it was about  half full and perfect for the random date night.", "author": "Grace K."}

If you are looking for amazing service along with outstanding food, this is the place you want to find yourself.  \n\nMy family and I decided on this place for our annual dinner in SF visit and we couldn't have picked better.  My brother, dad and I had the porterhouse steak medium rare.  I cannot tell you how long it has been since I have had a steak cooked so perfectly.  Everywhere else I go, it's always just under or just over where I'd like my steak.  This, however, was cooked incredibly.  My mom had the filet mignon rossini which just melted in your mouth.  I had never tried foie gras before, but I was floored by my taste buds.  My aunt had the prime rib and was also incredibly happy with her result.  The sides were buttermilk mashed potatoes and seasoned seasonal vegetables...mmmmmmm.  I was so happy by the end of the meal.\n\nWe indulged in some wonderful seasonal desserts at the end of the meal.  I had the candy cane baked alaska, my brother had the chocolate lava cake with edible holiday decor and my mom had the trio of handmade ice cream: pumpkin, eggnog and meyer lemon.  We just passed the plates around the table until they were all eaten.  I never knew eggnog ice cream could be so tasty.\n\nOur server was Brian and he made my experience just that much better.  He made it a really personable dining experience and treated us as if we were his most important table, even though he was still making sure his other tables had a great experience too.  He rolled with our humor and was very witty.  I would definitely go back to sit in his section again, it was that pleasurable. \n\nSo point of this review is to hopefully get you to go and try Harris' restaurant in San Francisco.

It was unquestionably the worst steakhouse dining experience I have ever had.  While the food was good, the service and the staff were deplorable.\n\nOn the recomendation of our conceirge, we took a car from our hotel around 8:00 p.m. without a reservation.  when we arrived, the supposed Maitre d' stated that we would have to wait 30-45 minutes for a table in the dining room as they were currently full.  Not a proble, as we did not get a reservation. \n\nWe went to the bar and took 2 seats and were promptly greated by the bartender.  We ordered drinks and so began our near hour wait for a table.  While seated at the bar, we were treated to conversations between the bartender and the servers about the other customers in the resturant.  They did not care for most of them and bashed them.  It was entertaining.\n\nAfter an hour, my friend went to ask about the status of a table as we had peeked into the dining room and took notice of the 3 empty tables just sitting there.  It took him a while to come back as no one was at the front desk to assist anyone.  as we discovered, it was rare when someone was actually manning the front desk.\n\nAfter we were seated, we met the worst waiter in fine dining.  At no point did he stike up a conversation with us or ask us how our evening had been.  He didn;t give us the opportunity to state that it was my friend's 40th birthday we had decided to share with them.  \n\nOur waiter was clearly ready to go home and became huffy when we asked for more time to peruse the menu and wine list prior to ordering.  We finally decided to start with onion rings.  The rings were not greasy and had a great flavor.  We then both ordered filets with french fries.  As always, I ordered mine medium rare.  We both ordered salads as well. \n\nA few minutes after we ordered, my friend decided he wanted to add a baked potato.  Heflagged down our waiter  asked the waiter to bring one with the steak and the waiter said that \"may be a problem\" as the kitchen was \"already shut down.\"  Shut down???  We didn't even have our food!\n\nWhile waiting on our entees, my friend realized he had left his wallet in his coat and went to the front to claim his checket coat to get it back.  About 10 minutes later the steaks arrived by my friend had not returned to the table.  I asked the waiter to check on him.  My friend finally came back and said he was waiting up front for 10 minutes and no one came by to help him.  He stated that the waiter come up there, following my request, and assisted him.\n\nI cut into my steak to find a medium on its way to medium well steak.  I asked the waiter to recook the steak and he made no amends for the mistake at that time.  About 15 minutes later, I received my second steak that was cooked to perfection.  However, the fries with my steak had clearly been refried to warm them up and not remade.  \n\nAt no point during out meal, did the waiter ever ask how our dishes were.  I am accostomed to being asked after each dish how I enjoyed the dish, but they didn't care at this place.  The only time the waiter made apologies was when he dropped off the check and wanted to secure his tip.  No manager ever came around and no one was anywhere to be found post-meal to discuss our troubles.\n\nCall me crazy, but when you are spending $500.00 plus for dinner and wine, I would think you should get service to match.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  Our experience was horrific.", "author": "Jeff S."}

If I had to rate the bar I would rate my score at least a 4 maybe a 5. The bar staff is incredibly friendly and can make good drinks and good pours. It was busy and the bartender noticed we had be standing for a while. When there were two open seats he politely told other customers the seats were for us. They are organized and make you feel very welcomed around and near the bar.\n  When it was time to be seated, the dinning room is nice with spacious booths for your party. Hosts and servers are super friendly as well. I ordered the rib-eye bone in medium rare that come with veggies and mashed potatoes. Sides were good and my steak unfortunately was not that great. The butter that I'm assuming is suppose to melt on the meat didn't even budge.\n  Should I ever come again I think I'll just stick around the bar and maybe order from there and most likely try something different on the menu.

I chose to go here instead of House Of Prime Rib and I left dissatisfied. First of all, the service was 5 star, and the ambience was quite nice, so the grading is on the food.\nThe mussels were very good and the wedge salad was sub par with most steakhouses. We had the ribeye and the Harris steaks. My ribeye was IMO very average. I cooked a trader joes filet a few days before, and that was all I could think about while eating my ribeye. It didn't have the normal marbled consistency a ribeye should have, nor the flavor that I expected at medium rare. It just wasn't a great cut. The Harris steak was slightly better, but still not very impressive. The potatoes au gratin were very good despite being a little cold.

I could care less about who my company is with at Harris', but if I had to compare my steak meal to something it would be the perfect first date. \n\nI arrived to my date about 10 minutes late due to traffic, but I called in and Harris' was very understanding and apperciative for my call. When I arrive, I'm warmly greeted and quickly seated to my table. Although Harris' is a fine dining establishment, I didn't feel like I was surrounded by pretentious people or uncomfortable that I wanted to scarf down my bread and smear it with copious amounts of their cheese spread. What I hate most on a first date is being judged for the way I eat. So Harris' was a perfect place to not only get the fine dining experience but to also feel comfortable in your own skin. Anyone that can make you feel comfortable with your quirks and treat you to the finer things in life is a winner in my books. \n\nAnyway, let's get back to what this date had to offer besides what was just on the surface. I had already picked out my entree weeks before even coming here due to a recommendation, which was the Filet Mignon Rossini w/ a baked potato. My other party ordered the Bone-in Ribeye w/ mashed potatoes. I appreciated the fact that they included the potato sides w/ the entree as opposed to having to pay for it separately like most fancy shmancy steakhouses. What I also loved was that they offered vino by the half bottle, which is perfect for me since I tend to enjoy 2-3 glasses of vino per meal and my company is not a huge wine drinker. (Also, thanks to my server who let me keep the bottle after I had made a remark that it was \"too cute to throw away\" cause it makes for a perfect vase for a half dozen of dried roses). We started our meal with the crab cakes and plate of fresh oysters. The crab cake was delish and didn't taste too heavy or buttery, like I've had at other establishments. The oysters were divine and were not skimpy at all. You can never go wrong with some aphrodisiacs on a first date. ;) Our steaks came out cooked to a perfect medium rare. I always appreciate when a date can handle their meat and to make sure it is perfect at first glance. The Filet Mignon Rossini is topped with perfectly grilled Foie Gras and Black Truffle, Cabernet sauce, and wiith just the first bite, I had my first mouthgasm. After I had given my company a bite of mine and it looked like he had died and went to heaven, he looked at his steak and looked back at me and said, \"I think they messed up my steak.\" In which, I asked, \"how so?\" He replied with the saddest look on his face and said, \"It doesn't taste like yours.\" For the rest of my meal when I would take breaks in between bites, he would quickly ask, \"Are you going to finish that?\"  Typically, I can never finish a whole steak even if it's only an 8oz, but this steak had me coming back for multiple mouthgasms. Also, because I wanted to torment him, I made sure I finished my whole steak so that I wouldn't have any leftovers. That my friends, was honestly the best perfect date I have ever had with a steak. \n\nYou can trust that you'll find me coming back for more with Harris'. He seems to be a busy man and it's been a week since I've heard back from him, but this wouldn't stop me from jumping on any opportunity to go on that second date if the opportunity arose. Harris', till we meet again (which I hope is lots sooner than later).", "author": "Lisa T."}

Whenever I was in the city and I'd pass by it I would  always wonder what it'd be like to eat there . I'm a sucker for pricey aged beef what can i say.  Any ways I finally got my opportunity.It was my Cousins husbands 51st birthday and he had a hankering for some good ol prime beef. We walk in and head to the hostess to be seated. She informs us that the dining room is completely booked out but we could sit in the lounge. My cousin took offense because she noticed that the dining room had plenty of tables, I sensed she wanted to leave but  we ended up staying and having a wonderful dinner.  We started out with smoked salmon appetizer which came with some breadsticks and some  thyme cream cheese was actually very good .A revelation lol ...I personally hate fish but I enjoyed the salmon (tasted like ham for some reason). We also had the crab cakes . Another seafood item I would normally never order but it was absolutely  delish. For my entree I had the rib eye medium-well blackened upon my cousin Erica's recommendation. I always get rib-eye   just never blackened. The steak was on point . Expensive and Very good . The marbling was magnificent and was so tasty. The baked potato was just  a baked potato your everyday run of the mill baked potato . Overall i enjoyed my experience , I would like to have to been  seated in the dining room but the lounge was very cozy and the live music was great. \n\nThe second best steak I've ever had.

Him and I have been meaning to go here for the longest time but never seem to make it and finally here we are! \n\nSo let me first start by telling you a Little bit about the ambiance. The restaurant had a nice classic feel to it and the lights were perfectly dimmed (if you're trying to be romantic). The crowd was a little more mature than what we're used to but we don't mind that at all. Most importantly though, the service here was impeccable! I am the type of person that is very hung up on service. Bad service = bad dining experience. \n\nOur dinner started off with the Steam Calms Mariniere as an appetizer. The calms are quite small but they give you a good portion so small or not you'll be satisfied. I normally don't like to eat bread before having dinner but the broth was so yummy I couldn't help but to keep on dipping in it. The broth had a hint of some sort of bitter vegetable and lots of white wine. \n\nNow onto the main course. I had order the Regular cut Prime Rib. My Prime Rib was cooked perfectly and the Au Jus I used to dip it in was loaded with tons of flavor (I drench my steak in the Au Jus). I couldn't finish my Prime Rib (being that it was like 12-15oz) so I ended up taking it home for lunch the next day. My boyfriend however ordered the Rib Eye steak. Oh how I love Rib Eye steaks!!! His steak was super juicy, huge and tender. Dimmed lights or not I still seen the juices falling off the steak as he was cutting it. \n\nSo to summarize this restaurant; it was an amazing experience! I would recommend that everyone at least try this restaurant once. This place might be a little pricey but it's worth every penny.", "author": "Kee G."}

Even though I swore not to drink more than that because I was feeling roly poly, I also had a couple of glasses of Cakebread Sauvignon Blanc because the Peruvian allegedly could not help finish the bottle.  As always, this was tasty too.\n\nI had the Harris steak medium rare and it was perfectly cooked, tender and juicy.  So good.  The others seemed to enjoy their filet mignons.  We closed with the eggnog creme brule and molten chocolate cake.  Neither of these were spectacular so I probably wouldn't order them again.  \n\nAs always, it was a night of interesting conversations about life, love, apirations and getting rid of baggage.  Just kidding.  We only talk about reality TV.", "author": "Seong P."}

To get an idea of what she likes, I asked what her favorite food was, to which she replied \"steak\".  The corners of my mouth pulled up, a twinkle developed in my eye, and my heart skipped a beat when I heard this.  THIS, I thought to myself, is the kind of girl I want to have a meaty, delicious dinner with!!\n\nI looked around Yelp and settled on Harris'.  Reservation was made and we both showed up promptly and were taken to our seats.  The decor is cool, but maybe a little too old-world for me.  Lots of beautifully stained wooden booths and highly detailed carpeting.  Not what I was expecting, but our table was somewhat off to the side, perfect for a young couple out on a date.  \n\nDate got the boneless NY Strip, medium. \n\nI got the porterhouse, medium rare.  \n\nWe did not speak all that much during the date, except to grunt about how good the meat was as we tore at it like animals.  We would momentarily come back to civilized eating when taking sips of the luscious Cab that was chosen for us by our great sommelier.

The lighting was pretty dim which added to the intimate feelings but made me sleepy too. haha\n\nNOISE LEVEL: Our reservations were at 6:30 and for most of our dinner, it was easy to have conversation but towards 8:00 the room got pretty loud. \n\nRESERVATIONS: Unless you reserve the rooms near the bar, I dont suggest too big of a party because I noticed a big party come in and they could only fit 6 people in a booth and then the restaurant tried to squeeze two chairs and the end of the table which looked awkward and uncomfortable. They had many wine spilling accidents as the night progressed.\n\n\nSTAFF: The waiters were really good about keeping our water glasses full, table clean, and checked in with us often. \n\nNow on to the FOOD:\n1) Free appetizers: bread chips with some sort of cheese dipping and butter- Half way I wished the bread was soft instead of crispy and low and behold, they came with some soft bread for us too but it wasnt warm and a little dry. Well its free right? cant complain too much. \n\n2) Ribeye steak, medium rare ($45) with scalloped potatoes and snap peas and shredded carrots: Some parts of the steak was more medium well than medium rare. But still really good. The scalloped potato looked like a lasagna. The sauce and cheese was a bit salty but it tasted good with the steak.  I didnt actually eat the snap peas and carrots since I was too busy with the actual steak. The steak was pretty big, bigger than my hand and I ended up taking 1/4 of it home. \n\n3) Prime rib (\"medium rare\"), English style cut with baked potato and creamed spinach ($38):  Baked potato was whatever and the creamed spinach looked like it should taste saltier maybe like a sauce for the prime rib? But I dont think my bf didnt eat much of the spinach. The actual prime rib looked more rare than medium rare but he wouldnt listen to me and send it back. He could have finished everything if he wanted to since his serving was smaller than the ribeye. The prime rib was nice and  tender  but I liked the ribeye better. Someone came by with a bunch of sauces for my bf to choose from for his baked potato (sour cream, green onion...etc)  and prime rib (horseradish). \n\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience here but because the bill was pretty steep (90+ for two people) I dont think I would come back because there are so many other expensive restaurants I want to try in SF and Harris isnt something I would particularly crave for.

No matter, we like getting a drink at the bar beforehand anyway.\n\nThey seated us at the table near the door while a jumanji monsoon brewing outside. Although we're in our lower mid 20's, we like to try out places normally frequented by an older crowd; and I have to tell you, we are seated by the door much too often at these places to be a coincidence every time. That said, I don't necessarily hold it against Harris', because it could have been a coincidence this time! (insert bovine expression here. get it? bovine?)\n\nThe ambiance was fantastic, and live music played from the library (a separate but connected room from the main dining hall). Our waiter was awesome: he had character, and wasn't shy to offer suggestions (I hate when waiter's respond \"everything's good on the menu!\"). \n\nHere's a little tidbit he told us: Harris' Restaurant has no relation to Harris' Ranch (which you pass on I5 on your way to LA). Apparently the ones responsible for opening up the two places were brothers or nephews or cousins or something weird, and through some feud they split and became mortal enemies. I don't know - I was little tipsy at this point - so the details elude me. but, 2 takeaways. 1) it's a semi-interesting story, so ask... and 2) none of their beef comes from Harris' Ranch. it comes from the Midwest.\n\nWe weren't too hungry and the portions looked big, so we decided against ordering an appetizer. Instead, we planned on getting a bottle of the house Pinot, our entrees with a side of creamed spinach, and dessert. \n\nThe house pinot was wonderful. I'm forgetting the name off the top of my head, but it was something 3-lettered, like ZDX, or A to Z. It was much more subtle and muted than what we were expecting - one of the least tanic pinot's I've tasted. Great smell and after taste though. \n\nWe got our food FAST, which i wasn't expecting at all from what other reviews have said. Like, chinese restaurant fast. We had a 8pm reservation and no one was waiting for our table afterward, so I'm not sure what their reasoning was.  \n\nI got the Harris' aged steak, which the waiter described as \"double-aged.\" This appeared to be the mainstay of the aged steak menu, so I ordered it (I'm a fan of ordering the recommended or most popular item on a menu, regardless of what it is). \n\nMy steak was good, but not great. To be fair, I've only had 2 aged steaks in my life, including this one. The other one was at Epic Roasthouse down by the embarcadero. Comparatively, this steak was a little juicier, but seemed a little less flavorful. I guess it depends on how people like their steaks, but when i ordered something that was touted as \"double aged\" for 40 something bucks, I was expecting king tut's overly-pampered pet cow or something. I don't want to be dramatic though - I thought it was very good. But perhaps I was expecting too much by expecting the best steak of my life (editor's note: at this point we are 1.5 bottles of wine and a cocktail in though, so my senses weren't exactly at peak performance).\n\nThe mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were temperature hot, garlicky and buttery, everything you'd expect from good sides.\n\nFor dessert we got the \"baked alaska\" which is a classic dish for a steakhouse. It was very good and well executed, but seemed a little out of place, unremarkably plated, and overall Ruby Tuesday-ish for a 4$ restaurant.\n\nThe pricing was within reason. $160 something for the above, before tip.   \n\nOverall, worth a trip, but perhaps more for the ambiance and experience than the steak itself.", "author": "James W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-12", "description": "Steak.  The Food of Kings, the Man's MAN'S Meat, the Toughest (reputation not texture) Food on the Planet and dare I say, the Mike Tyson of Entrees.  I'll always think of steak as the first grown-up meal I ever had.  Being old enough to order the same thing my dad did at a restaurant was (and still is) a big deal.  If that doesn't scream adulthood, I don't know what does.\n\nIf you hate the sight of blood dripping off your steak or if you order your steak Medium, Medium Well and/or Well Done, then we are NOT friends.  You do not know how to eat a steak, and someone that would purposely sabotage an awesome experience such as a steak dinner isn't to be trusted.  Now, if you love the sight of blood dripping off your steak or if you order your steak Blue, Very Rare, Rare and/or Medium Rare then we are not only friends, but we are also going to watch the special midnight showing of Twilight: New Moon when it comes out on November 20th.\n\nBefore we get started, let me just say that I've been to a few Steakhouses in my time.  Morton's (In San Francisco/Dallas/North Carolina), Ruth's Chris (In San Francisco/Las Vegas/Los Angeles/North Carolina), Tad's, House Of Prime Rib, New York Prime(In New York), LarkCreek Steak, Laury's (In Las Vegas), Houston's (In Dallas), Izzy's, Barclay Prime (In Philadelphia), Bern's Steakhouse (In Tampa), San Mateo Prime and Sizzler (Sorry, I had to give them a shout out).  Keeping all of that in mind, I am happy to report that the best steak in the United States is at Harris' in good old San Francisco, California.  YEAH I SAID IT!\n\nSo why does Harris' rock so hard and why are they better then all of these other steakhouses?  I'm glad you asked.\n\nThe Staff - They were quick and efficient.  You can always find a server when you needed one, but they weren't too overbearing.  \n\nMy waiter rocked and was very professional / knowledgeable about the menu.  \n\nI was also stoked with the service of the valet guys.  They made sure to have a cab waiting for us as soon as we left the restaurant (yeah, I got it like that).\n\nThe Vibe - There is a real old-school vibe to the restaurant.  It's a classy joint without the stuffiness that normally comes along with a place like this.  The decor is what you would expect from a steakhouse, but I really enjoyed the overall ambiance of the place.\n\nThe Food - Okay, this is what it's all about right:\n\nAppetizer - I decided to go with the Oysters and the Sweetbread.  The oysters tasted really fresh which is always important when it comes to seafood.  There were 6 oysters total which had 3 different sauces applied to them.  They all tasted AMAZING, but I liked the mignonette sauce the best.  For those of you that don't know me (and for some of those that do), I'm a huge carbivore (carb eater).  I know, I'm so out of style.  That being said, I actually ended up enjoying the sweetbreads more then the oysters.  I know, I'm weird.  It came in a large, 3 piece portion and they were seared with a nice sauce.\n\nEntree - The 49er cut (Medium Rare) which is basically a huge boneless New York cut.  What can I say, I'm a proud Cali kid and represent the Bay to the fullest.  \n\nSides - My entree came with two sides.  I went with a loaded Baked Potato and the Sauteed Mushrooms.  Just like the steak, the sides were AMAZING.  The mushrooms were dope and the baked potato complimented the steak perfectly.  \n \nBottom line, Harris' steaks tastes like Johnny Depp's acting career.  Massive and awesome.  In other words, if you want a good steak, don't come to Harris'.  If you want a steak that will make you feel like how you did after your first kiss, if you want a steak that will melt in your mouth, if you want a steak that is so good it will make you want to slap your momma, then you need to eat at Harris'.", "author": "Ray-Ray B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-26", "description": "It's time to write a steakhouse review and I am going to start here.  But, see the Bobo's review for THE BEST steak in the city and in the area.\n\nFor years I was on a quest to ferret out the best New York steak that I could engulf with the entusiasm and gusto of a rabid Giants fan.  I have been to steakhouses in several states in the past few years and my top NY steak of all time, until a few years ago, was digested in Chicago and came from the Chicago Chop House.  Charred, but med-rare-rare, succulent, tender, and extremely tasty.  They dry aged their steak back then but I have heard that they have changed ownership a few years ago and might be wet aging thier beef.  What a shame! \n\nBefore I continue I need to explain my NY steak theory.  The first time that I go to a steakhouse I always order the NY because, if a steak house can crank out a \"shut your mouth\" NY- then the other more flavorful cuts of meat should be even jucier to consume.  Most steak afficiando's know the basics of Steak 101, so I won't try to lecture on cuts of meat education-  i.e. the differences between rib eye, sirloin, etc..\n\nFor those who are interested, I will provide a list of my favorite steakhouses/steaks in another review because I have finally found- \"Hands down the best steak in town- or the country\" and it's in SF! But , for now, I am going to focus on Harris'. \n\nI am a native of The City, don't call it Frisco, and I have/had been to Harris' dozens of times and had dozens of DRY AGED NY's.  So, up until I took my trip to Chicago, and until I tried another City steakhouse, I thought that Harris' NY was THE best  NY that I had had.  Also, out of the dozens of trips to Harris' I have only had ONE really bad dinning experience, but it was a doosy!  Steak was sent back, waiter was an asshole, wine turned to vinegar, caesar salad was wilted and flavorless, my martini didn't even taste like a maritni, side of spinach was luke warm.  Needless to say that I never went back for a few years.  This was a good thing because I would have never found my steak of all steaks if I hadn't had such a crappy experience.  \n\nBut, I did get the guts to venture back and I was not and have not been disappointed since.  While not being able to produce THE best steak in the city, hence not \"Hands down best in town,\" Harris' is the SECOND best steak in The City.  The Harris Steak- bone in New York- is tender, cooked to perfection, and bursting with flavor.  The Filet however, doesn't have the flavor of the NY but is a little more subtle and obviously more tender.  They also have a more difficult time cooking this steak to my specifications.  The Ribeye is even more delicious than the NY but it has way more fat and less beefy stuff.  I am not a fan of always ordering the ribeye at steakhouses.  I like to eat meat not globs of stuff that looks like lypo fat.  Harris' Porterhouse is one of the best in The City, always nice nutty flavor and is yummy, but sometimes, again, not cooked to perfection.\n\nThe sides and appetizersat Harris' are top notch compared to most steakhouses.  The chain's e.g. Ruth's Chris, and Morton's, sides are usually hit or miss, and more often a miss.  I sometimes, just stick to the entre and one side if I HAVE to go to a chain steakhouse.  At Harris' I ALWAYS start with the Harris' martini with the classic barrel presentation.  For some reason they just taste better that other martini's at other establishments and the small barrel with crushed ice and beaker of leftover gin is too cool and unique not to order.  It is a must for martini afficiando's.  \n\nThe Caesar salad is very good.  Rich creamy dressing that has a nice pungent bite.  The crab cakes aren't that good, too much other flavors  getting in the way of the taste of the crab.  I love French onion soup and I am also on a quest to find the best in the city.  But, Harris's version lacks the real tangy flavor that I am trying to find.  Prawns, clams, and even the steak tartare are all equally delicious and worth ordering.  \n\nThe atmosphere is classic old school steakhouse.  I love the big leather encased booths and large dinning room.  I am a lover of dark wood interiors with dim lighting but Harris' lighter wood, brightly lit main dinning room is one of the more classic dinning rooms in The City.  \n\nThe staff is always knowledgable about the steak and the wine list.  They are attentive without being obtrusive, and friendly while maintaining a professional demeanor.  The wine list surprisingly contains more than your typical steakhouse selections.  However, it also includes the popular big and bold cabs.\n\nOverall, Harris' is one of the best steakhouse experiences.  The food, ambiance, and service come together to create an elegant, but not too antisceptic environment in which to have a great evening.\n\n\"Best of\" list is yet to come.", "author": "Edmond S."}

I had never been to a real, classic San Francisco steakhouse, so I was very curious (and starving, as it happened!)\n\nThe place certainly matched my expectations - a grand, formal building on Van Ness, with an elegant entry-way and a subdued dining room. The feel was that of an older, very prosperous crowd. The Ma\u00eetre d' was friendly and attentive, and seated us in a quieter room off the main dining area, away from the main bustle of the restaurant but still within earshot of the piano...!\n\nI started with a very tasty Martini - served a small glass, with an extra little carafe alongside, nestled in a little barrel of ice. (Their signature, apparently.) A good start...\n\nI then opted for their soup of the day, a very tasty Potato & Dill, and inevitably, went for the Fillet Mignon - the first dish on their menu, and apparently, a must-have, at Harris'. At $44, it is fairly scandalously expensive (though it's a steal next to the $75 Kobe beef steak), but it was my birthday, after all...\n\nSure enough, the steak was excellent, succulent and tender (and more than enough  for me), served with steamed veggies and potatoes (Au Gratin potatoes - not the baked potato I asked for -- though to be fair, when I complained, the waiter brought me a baked potato as a side, with his profound apologies.) Indeed, service was excellent throughout - the waiter was friendly and casual, but clearly knowledgeable about the different meats (and obviously, a steak guy!) and - a nice touch - he overheard us discussing my birthday during the meal, and unprompted, he brought us a little celebratory ice cream dessert after dinner.\n\nA good meal - excellent steak, in a refined setting. Not cheap, but worth it, for a once-in-a-while special occasion. (But, beware the sleazy limo guy hanging out outside who appears to be in league with the restaurant doorman, to snag diners & charge them outrageous off-the-meter fares to get home -- luckily, we managed to get a regular cab!)", "author": "donal c."}

It had a old\nWestern romantic look to it and even had a live band playing. GREAT!\n\nChecked in at 8:50 for my 9:00 reservations with the nice hostess that offered us the bar while we wait for our table. Unfortunately it was full so we decided to wait. Bad idea.... We ended up standing there waiting for 45minutes after our reservation time!!!! By that time my BF was already a little steamed u can say... \"what's the point of making a reseration?\" he says.\n\nWe were seated in a small room at the end of the bar that seems like a story book parlor or library with a giant cowboy painting hanging on the wall. The room was cozy with 4 tables of 2s. Right when you sit the hostess offered you to coat check :) We had Tom as our waiter and he was super helpful! He helped us decide on a bottle of wine and we got the Von Hazle Riesling $40 which I LOVED!\n\nThey also brought water , bread, baguette and spread while you wait. I liked the cheddar spread very much.\n\nFor appitizers we had the oysters on the half shell. 6 for $15. I was told they were sweet water oysters and it came with 3 sauces. The regular cocktail sauce, a vinegar sauce, and a sesame soy sauce with a hint of Ginger which was delish!!!\n\nMain course my BF had the 49er NY boneless steak medium rare. It came out on the medium and dry side :( it was a good size though.... For $49\n\nI had a porterhouse steak $49 medium rare. It came out bigger then my face! When I cutter into my steak I thought my cow was gonna walk off my plate any minute because it was so raw! I really didn't wanna bother my superb waiter but I ended up having it sent back. So they had my steak threw back onto the grill for just a little bit longer. When it came back, Tom got me a fresh new side dished and my steak was cooked perfectly! Upon my first bite... A piece of the steak was so chared, it poked my tongue and I swear it's still aching today! FML! Other then that I loved my steak even though I could only finish 1/4.\n\nOur main dished came with veggies and mashes or baked potatoes. Bf and I thought the mashed potatoes were great!\n\nUnfortunately we were to tired and Full to have any dessert.\n\nSince we were sitting close to the end of the bar we heard of employee chattering which is a little hard to ignore through out the whole dinner. I do understand since it's the end of the night and they just wanna chill. But there goes our romantic night (attempted but failed. Lol) our corner seats happens to be where the employee on break seems to migrate to -__-  \n\nOverall it was a good experince, yes pricey!\n\nour waiter Tom, coat check lady, and host gets [5stars] :D", "author": "julie n."}

I asked the server about the ribeye and she assured me she had eaten one and it would be very tender.  I bit into a piece of bone that was not attached to the main bone. I had to give up it was so tough and when my friend had finished eating I was finally able to send it back after a 30 minute wait.  I never heard from a manager and I thought that with its reputation I would at least get an apology.  The server  did bring me a petite filet which was wonderful.  The baked potato was so small that I ate it in four bites.  I had the bread pudding for desert and it was a real disappointment!  My friend had the cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e and he enjoyed it.

They definitely serve up a great steak, with good service, and a decent wine list. \n\nWe arrived early and enjoyed a cocktail in the cozy lounge, which we sipped while being serenaded with some smooth jazz delivered by a trio of musicians.  Whereas the lounge seemed somewhat cramped and dark, the dining room opened up and was lighter and more welcoming.  Dinner started with the tartare and a wedge salad (dressing changes, but ours was ranch with goat cheese), both of which were quite good.  Then came the Rossini Filet Mignon, which was perfectly cooked, and topped with foie gras.  Delicious.  We ended with a melon sorbet that was unique and refreshing. \n\nStreet parking was relatively easy to find (or pay $10 to valet) and for us out-of-towners, the proximity to Fisherman's Wharf and Ghirardelli Square was a plus, too.  Yelpers say this place is dressy -- people wear different things to dinner, but I was comfortable in a pair of khakis and a polo shirt.  A few diners (but not many) wore blazers. Most were more on the casual side of business casual.", "author": "Steve M."}

Added, I also had great expectations heading to Harris'--after trying and loving House of Prime Ribs down the street and hearing rave reviews about how Harris' even tops that.\n\nSo onto the experience.\n\nThe atmosphere and environment is just right: exactly what you'd expect in an upscale American fine-dining steakhouse. We were seated in the main dining room, gently lit. It was a 6pm dinner, so not quiet so packed yet, but a good amount of diners were there. As the dinner progressed, a live jazz band started playing in the small dining room, and it really added to the mood.\n\nThe food:\n\nWe started off with the appetizer grilled foie gras with toast, and an orange marmalade. Love the toast, and it really goes well with the foie gras and the sauce. What's not to love? The foie gras itself... unfortunately, it just wasn't the same as what I thought it would be (perhaps I had a wrong image in my mind). Perhaps it was also due to I was not feeling that great, but it was way too greasy for me. I couldn't really finish it.\n\nThe steak tartare, on the other hand, was absolutely amazing. Not as delicately prepared in a tiny bowl as in other restaurants, but the flavor and the freshness is perfect! \n\nAlso they serve you a cracker with cheddar and wine paste appetizer, which is amazing as well!\n\nAfter the appetizers were the steak itself. I got the Harris Steak, medium rare. It's done really well, juicy and tender. Surprisingly, there was no sauce on the steak, but it's juicy and flavored enough that you don't actually need any either.\n\nIt wasn't bad or anything, just a bit disappointing. What made me wonder a bit was that in the end, I had leftover steak--which usually never ever happens to me. My girlfriend, on the other hand, loved the place. \n\nI'd definitely give it another try when I'm not sick.", "author": "Lei X."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-10-10", "description": "My husband wanted some steak for his birthday, so we decided to give this place a try.  I like the clubby old-school steakhouse look, but at least they don't go overboard with it so it doesn't look too stuffy.  We had reservations for 7:30 but arrived around 15min earlier, but they seated us right away anyway.\n\nHubby got one of their \"King Eider\" martinis for his ap\u00e9ritif and it looked pretty cool.  They serve it in a small-ish martini glass but they give you a tiny carafe in a little ice bucket for the rest of it...this is pretty nice, especially for people who like to nurse their drinks since it guarantees that your martini is always perfectly chilled even though it's a large portion.  I only had a small sip since I was DD for the night and it tasted really good too.\n\nFor our appetizers, we started off with the oysters and the sweetbreads.  The oysters tasted really fresh, and came 6 oysters and 3 different sauces...they were all good but I like the mignonette sauce the best.  The sweetbreads were even better, we got a pretty large portion (3 pieces) and they were seared with a nice sauce.  They were cooked perfectly and I gotta say a lot better than what I've had at some French restaurants! \n\nFor our main course, I had the filet mignon rossini and hubby got the ribeye.  My filet was cooked perfectly medium-rare, and they gave a really generous portion of nicely seared foie gras on top.  It came with a really nice red wine sauce, though I couldn't really taste the truffle that was supposed to be in the sauce.  I'm not a big potato person, but I LOVED the scalloped potatoes that came with my steak...it kinda tasted like mac&cheese but with potatoes instead of the mac.  Very yummy.  Hubby's ribeye was also really good, it had those nice little pockets of fat that ribeye steaks do, and had some nice beefy flavor from the dry-aging.  We had some mushrooms on ths side, which I thought was a little too peppery but the hubby liked it.\n\nFor dessert, I had the chocolate cake and hubby had some sort of fruit crisp.  They were both kinda meh, but then I didn't really have great expectations at this sort of place anyway.  It satisfied the urge to have something sweet at the end of our meal, that's all.\n\nFrom looking at the website, I was kinda scared that they wouldn't have much of a wine selection, since it only indicated their banquet wine list which wasn't much.  However the wine list they have at the restaurant was much more extensive.  We wanted to try something new, and settled on a Bordeaux-style blend from Napa (Robert Craig \"Affinity\").  It wound up being really good for the price, and went really well with our steaks.  Their wine markups didn't seem too bad, especially comparing to other restaurants in this price range.  Our bottle was less than 2x of the retail price, as opposed to the 2-3x markup you see at some other restaurants.\n\nService was pretty good, you can always find a server when you need them but they're not all over you.  One thing that was pretty curious was that the bathrooms had some sort of malfunction (water started coming up from the drains!) and we were surprised with their swiftness in dealing with the situation.  Probably within the hour, they had everything cleaned up as if nothing happened, so we thought they dealt with the problem really well.\n\nWe don't go to steakhouses often, since it always seems so easy to just cook steak at home (as opposed to fancy French dishes).  However, I felt like we got our money's worth here, in terms of the ambiance, getting pampered, and perfectly cooked steaks.  Hubby likes the ribeye at Ruth's Chris better, but I like the filet here more (might have something to do w/ the foie gras on top).  We've only ever been at Ruth's Chris during DAT though and pay so much less that it's probably not a fair comparison.  It's not as fancy-shmancy as Alexander's but I actually liked their steak here better, and it's a much better value overall due to their larger portions.\n\nDefinitely recommended if you're looking for a good steak in the city.", "author": "Arlene M."}

I did have a sip of their famous Martini and it lived up to the hype.\n\nIt's definitily a pricy place but good for a night of indulgence.

I ended up ordering the prime rib (executive cut that is) and my BF ordered the porter house- both were HUGE!! We also ordered the crabcakes which came out pretty good as well. My prime rib came with a side of garlic spinach (with an added piece of hair in it....) and potato scallops (a bit salty but nonetheless good) and his porterhouse came with a baked potato and veggies. We barely touched our food- the BF wasnt feeling too good and I was just overwelmed by the size of my entree. \n\nTo top off our meal our waiter brought out a mini icecream dessert for my BF since it was his bday and we also got a crabcakes on the house due to the hair in my spinach..\n\nOverall great restaurant with excellent customer service, specifically from the bussers- our waiter was not as attentive and we found ourselves having to wave him down on several occassions. Our glasses were constantly refilled and our plates were taken away promptly. \n\nGood food, generous portions and excellent service from the bussers.", "author": "M W."}

The steaks are usually grilled to the right temperature but unfortunately, my last steak was over cooked. They took care of it however without any problems. \n\nI think the one thing that makes Harris truly special is how everything else is delicious. The crackers and spread that they have are ADDICTIVE.

My friend got the steak, and the thing was bursting with goodness (we shared dishes).  Like when you eat this steak, your mind melts into poetry.\nMy Scottish salmon was quite excellent as well - very soft, juicy, and easy on the tongue.  Not like cheap salmon that tends to taste dry.\nThis restaurant is very high class: there is LIVE MUSIC playing - a jazzy band with piano and other pieces (funny story: I'm getting into Brazilian music, and I noticed they were playing a song I know by Antonio Jobim...didn't expect that!).\nAs my friend noted, the SERVICE IS EXCELLENT.  Need anything?  They seem to come by just when you need them.  They also don't barge in when you are about to say something important, like sometimes servers do in places like Red Robin (not hating).\nThe ENVIRONMENT IS CLASSY.  Imagine being in a wealthy New England banker's mansion, or a steak magnate's home - well, if you're reading this review in the restaurant, don't close your eyes to imagine what's already around you.  Silly.  Rich, dark brown wood paneling, book cases, huge paintings...wow.\nRESERVATIONS SEEM EASY TO GET - I reserved a spot just a day beforehand, but still managed to get in.\n\nCONS:\nThe VEGGIES on both our plates (these green bean things) weren't cut at the ends (these are kind of harder to chew), and were pretty average.\nBread before the meal is a bit hard to chew.\nIf you're poor, this is unfortunately not an economical place for you to dine.  The PRICES ARE VERY HIGH.  The Harris Steak is at $48, the Scottish Salmon at $34, and most starters around $15.\n\nThat being said, the food is delicious, the environment breathtaking YET cozy enough for an intimate date, and the servers are very friendly.\nEveryone should try dining out at a fine place like this at least once in their lives.", "author": "Ulysses L."}

Three of us shared this and the regular filet mignon. Between the two dishes, I would definitely have to say that this was the better of the two. I really liked the rich flavor of the foie gras with the filet mignon. YUM! But again, I don't think I could have finished this dish on my own.

Glad I shared it with everyone else because even a dessert lover like me can not even finish this delicious slice of cheesecake.\n\nBanana Baked Alaska\nI usually do not like bananas, so I wasn't too excited about this dessert, but when I tried it I really liked it. I really liked the meringue like shell, it kind of just melts in your mouth.

They gave each of us a piece of bread and these little toasts with butter and spread. For appetizers we ordered oysters (comes with 6 and 3 sauces), smoked salmon and crab cakes (comes with 2). All the appetizers were good! Oysters were fresh and the crab cakes had a lot of crab in it. The smoked salmon came with little thin pieces of toasts. For dinner we ordered filet mignon, prime rib, chicken and salmon. My mom loved the filet mignon. She said it was very tender. My dad also loved the prime rib. He got the regular cut and it was humongous! My husband got the chicken which was delish! We didn't think a steakhouse would make good chicken but it was very tasty! My salmon was also good but not as tasty as the chicken. All entr\u00e9es come with saut\u00e9ed vegetables and a choice of baked potato, mash potatoes or french fries. Prime rib comes with cream spinach instead of saut\u00e9ed vegetables. The baked potato was delicious with all the butter, sour cream and fresh chives. (Heart attack). 4 stars only because our waiter only checked in on us once. We didn't feel like the service was outstanding, he only came to give us menus, take our orders and give us our check. I requested a slice of cake or something for my moms bday when I made the reservation but nothing came so I had to remind our waiter and he came back with a tiny little cup of I have no idea what it was with whipped cream,  a candle and happy birthday written in chocolate.

This restaurant is not recommended for first dates or dinners with people you cannot sit and converse with for around two hours straight. In other words, come here to celebrate with loved ones and close friends!\n\nDuring the month of May, Harris' Restaurant celebrated its Silver Anniversary with an amazing Prix Fix menu. So that's what we ordered with a wine pairing that was very well selected for each course.\n\nFirst off was the amuse-bouche of vichyssoise - a creamy cool starter to get the palate going. Then, Harris' Caesar Salad. It was pretty memorable. I don't think I've had such a good one before! A lemon sorbet to cleanse the palate... A little too lemony and a little too cold for me. Unfortunately since the gigantic salad came at the beginning of the meal and was absolutely delicious, I filled myself up with it rather than waiting for the main course, Filet Mignon Rossini, the medium rare filet mignon topped with melt-in-your-mouth foie gras and a side of mashed potatoes. Absolutely deeeelicious and meaty. \n\nWhen the dessert arrived [Opera Cake], I just looked at it. Took a few bites, and that was it. Too full to the point of near explosion. For a Prix Fix menu, one would expect a skimping on portions. This was not the case at Harris'. It was worth every pretty penny spent. Service was top-notch, the courses well-paced. Company was fantastic, so Harris' is five stars in my book.\n\nPS - Would it be inappropriate to walk in and only order the Caesar Salad?

For $175, I do not feel it was worth it except for the experience.  One complaint is that we had them serve it with our appetizers so everyone could try but they didn't include the sides yet still charged full price.  The American Kobe has a little meatier taste and in my opion is the better value at $75.  The Japanese Kobe is NOT twice as tasty as the American version.  The fillet mignon is good but small.

The hostess (tall blond generic looking woman) tonight who greeted us (or actually, didn't really greet, just led us to our table) at this so called 4.5 star Yelp rated restaurant was indifferent, no smiles, no warmth, possibly the coldest hostess I've ever had.  And for it to be at this supposedly \"high class\" restaurant?  Unacceptable.  I must mention that when she led a group of men to their table later on, she was all smiles--so I should give her some credit ;)\n\nThe appetizers were completely average.  Had the crab cakes--had better ones by the wharf, nothing special.  The french onion soup was better, and maybe even worth what we paid.  The soup of the day, a shrimp bisque, too creamy without the delicacy that the better bisques should have.  \n\nI had the pepper steak--and I will say this, the steak was very good, definitely good quality, but I would not say the best quality.  The scalloped potato sides was decent, very rich, and the vegetables were less than impressive.  The sauteed mushrooms were enjoyable, and the creamed spinach was good--but not necessarily better than the creamed spinach from Boston Market (yes, I compared it to a fast food place).  \n\nThe steak Diane was good, however, my boyfriend had asked for medium rare, and only half of the mignon was medium rare, the other half medium.  \n\nHere's the thing, it's good steak when it's cooked correctly (which apparently is inconsistent), skip all the sides and appetizers, and even then, I'm not sure the steak's worth as much as they ask for.  I personally wouldn't go back.  If I'm going to enjoy my steak, I gotta have the appetizers and sides to be great to go along with it.  \n\nAnd service should be exceptional, and it really was brought down by the hostess.  It's not the worst food in the world, but it's entirely questionable if it's worth $65 a head without wine.  Go to Gary Danko's.

The prime rib was cooked perfectly and EXTREMELY tender, just a little more fatty than I prefer.  I ate one and a half slices of my 3, a few bites of the potatoes and a third of my creamed spinach.  The spinach was cooked really well, too..but eesh..garlic breath alert!\n\nWhile some believe HOPR is the best place for prime rib, I think Harris takes the cake.  The service is always great!  If you don't know what kind of wine to pair your food with, the waiters usually have great recommendations.  Eating at Harris is like having an expensive party in my tummy.

We both agreed that the strong flavor of onion somewhat detracted from the delicate flavor of the beef. Nonetheless the texture and overall flavors were superb.\n\nNow for the reason this restaurant exists: the steaks. The 15oz boneless American Kobe beef ribeye immediately caught my eye. My girlfriend decided on their classic dry aged bone-in New York \"Harris Steak\". Both arrived cooked perfectly to medium rare. I would have loved to see just how incredibly marbled the ribeye was prior to hitting the grill. The rich flavor was outstanding! The dry aged New York did not disappoint in the least either and was very tender, flavorful and juicy. Their grill imparts a great flavor, and just he right amount of butter topped each steak. Overall it was beef heaven!\n\nWe actually had room for dessert after all that amazing beef.

I paid with a CC and left 20% cash tip.  I checked my account online and noticed that the server had added extra gratuity on my CC.  I had my CC copy and clearly, there was no tip written.\n\nI called the manager and explained that I left a cash tip but the server had added gratuity.  The manager never apologized and tried defending the server.  He said that for parties of 6 or more, gratuity is automatically added so that the server must have gotten confused and mistakenly added it.  WHAT?!  How can you only have a $100 check at Harris' for a party of 6 or more?  All I got was we'll look into it and not even an apology.", "author": "danny m."}

Beautifully warm night in the city.\nThis might not happen frequently so I decided to go out on a limb and celebrate with a good steakhouse. I have been there previously and not disappointed. I had the porterhouse steak, $40.00 comes with steamed seasonal vegtables and choice of baked potato or house potato which is different every night. Also had an appetizer of chilled prawns-$15.00 for 5. Love them things. My steak was made to order, huge and delicious. The wife had the filet mignon for about $39.00 and the kid had the peite felit mignon. Also had a side of sauted mushrooms, very nice and a glass of house cabernet.\nThe service was inpecable, as it should be at this fine establishment and we capped off the night with baked Alaska.\nIt cost but the Giants and my family are worth it.", "author": "jack d."}

These were the best oysters I've devoured in my life--so big, so plump, so refreshing. Next up were the crab cakes with beurre blanc. I wasn't  impressed with them, but they weren't terrible--they could've used more seasoning. Beurre blanc just doesn't complement crab that well IMO.\n\nFor the main course he had the Harris steak (thick bone-in New York) and I had the Ribeye steak. Although I'm not a big fan of New York steak--or New York for that matter--I just fell in love with this one. It was juicy, tender, had a nice crust, and tasted heavenly. Mmmmm. The ribeye was like Safeway slab next to this.

Excellent steak in a fine dinning environment\r\n\r\nCost? About $100/person with tip for a cocktail, wine, appetizer, steak and desert.\r\n\r\nAtmosphere? Formal old world elegance. The kind of place you could wear a suit if you so choose\r\n\r\nRecommendations? Steaks are awesome; the house martini was great (though made with a softer Bombay gin, and not Tanquery), and comes in a really interesting service; Baked Alaska was great, the chocolate cake was slightly disappointing \r\n\r\nGood date place? Yes. Your date will have a great meal, the booths offer at least reasonable privacy and (s)he may think you are the next Warren  Buffet or Bill Gates, who by the way dined there together last year. \r\n\r\nCompare/Contrast Bobo's and Harris'? Battle of the steak superstars. Prices for similar meals were almost exactly the same (with tip $190 for two at Bobo's, $195 at Harris). Bobo's is self consciously casual while Harris' is formal. Bobo's, like Ruth Chris, puts a little butter on their steak, Harris does not. I'd say the buttered steak will appeal slightly more to people who don't eat steak regularly.\r\n\r\nWhat is this dry aged/wet aged stuff I keep hearing about and does it really make a difference? In dry aging meat is hung in a super-clean, chilled room. A crust forms on the outside, and the meat begins to break down in what is essentially a carefully controlled rot. In wet aging meat is stored in its own juices. Dry aging is more expensive - between evaporative loss and  the crust, which needs to be thrown away, the steak can loose 10-20% of its initial weight, but it produces a fuller flavor. Harris dry ages cuts with bones and wet ages fillets, Bobo's dry ages everything. Ruth Chris wet ages everything.  I understand The Palm wet ages everything except at its New York location, where it dry ages everything. \r\n\r\nDon't you feel horrible eating these poor animals? No. It's not my fault they're filled with meat.", "author": "Bill S."}

If smoking were allowed indoors, this place would reek of cigars.  Dark wood, live jazz, wait staff in ties and white jackets.  My favorite style of restaurant seating, round booths.  It's like you're all cozied up in some enormous tufted leather chair.\r\nFor private parties, there is a room called the Library Room, which makes me think of the game Clue - i.e. Professor Plum did it with the Lead Pipe in the Library.  Wow, now it really does sound like a Mafia joint.\r\n\r\nStiff Drink:\r\nKing Eider Martini (see Susan B.'s review).  Served up with a little barrel with ice to hold the mini-carafe of the rest of it.  Great for the martini-lover.  Threatened to knock me on my ass.  Must be followed with the consumption of pounds of decadent food to balance out the alcohol.\r\n\r\nGetting Started:\r\nThere are 3 starters that I can recommend - the Mixed Field Greens with Roquefort, the Sweetbreads, and the Traditional Onion Soup.  Think Onion Soup is all about the cheese?  Try this one.  The flavor is excellent.\r\n\r\nRare Steak:\r\nMy advice with premium aged meat such as they serve at Harris' is keep it simple.  What I mean is go with a preparation that doesn't involve a lot of sauce.  For example, choose the Ribeye or Filet Mignon over the Steak Diane.  If you like sauce, order the Bearnaise on the Side.  The meat is very tender and very well-flavored.  The portions are big, but take home the rest to have with eggs the next morning.  Yum, yum.\r\nThey do have other options, such as lamb, chicken and salmon.  I doubt I'll ever try them, but it's good to know.\r\n\r\nOn the Side:\r\nCreamed Spinach or Bearnaise Sauce.  I love how the Bearnaise Sauce is listed as a \"side\".  You might want a soup spoon with that.\r\n\r\nHappy Ending:\r\nI like the desserts here.  The cheesecake is very good, as is the Creme Brulee.\r\n\r\nDo not come to Harris' if you are seeking innovation or trendiness.  You will find neither here.  Do come if you are looking for a solid, elegant dining experience with great service.  We come here on special occasions such as birthdays (we celebrated one tonight) and other milestones.

You have heard the food is good and it is true and I will give Harris' credit for that later. The main reason for my review is to critique the service I received there. \n\nSo I arrive there and valet the car, everything is fine there. They seat me and I order my food, everything is fine there as well. Now here is where it gets weird. \n\nAfter I order my food the valet guy comes to my table while we are having a conversation and he proceeds to tell me that he has locked our keys in the car and the car is sitting out front with the lights on. Ummm.....wtf is that!?!?\n\nOK so honest mistake, right? That's fine...I understand that $hit happens sometimes. So I ask the valet if he can call a tow service to come and slim jim the car. He said that he can't. So instead of talking with my girlfriend, they expect me to call a tow truck to fix their mistake?\n\nJeez you'd think I was at frickin Denny's or something. I paid 75 dollars for a steak and you can't even place a freaking phone call to fix YOUR mistake?????? \n\nSo I call over the manager...thinking that this guy will probably see the problem with all of this. He comes over and I tell him what happened. He said he will \"look into it\". Am I being unreasonable to ask you to fix what you did? Or is it common practice to inconvenience the customer while they are still eating?\n\nOK so for the next 45 minutes while we are eating we think that everything is fine and that the tow truck should be here by the end of our meal to help us out, right? NOPE! \n\nThe manager who was going to \"look into it\" comes back to my table after dessert and tells me he could not get anyone to open the door. How hard is it to call a tow truck? Do you have internet? A phonebook?A brain, perhaps?  Are you a complete moron? Seemingly so....because he gives me the genius advice of...and I quote \"If you have AAA I would suggest you call them.\"\n\nWell jeez thanks for the tip jerk off! It took you 45 minutes to come up with that diabolical plan to amuse me? Ummmm did you honestly wait till now to tell me this crap???....knowing that tow trucks take an hour? \n\nI called Bill Wren immediately after and a tow truck was on the way. Harris' manager seemed to think that having their customers stand outside in the cold waiting for a tow truck for an hour because their valet guy locked our keys in the car was an example of customer service.\n\nAny nice establishment would have told me they locked the keys in there and that they have ALREADY called a tow truck to come and fix this as to not RUIN our experience. \n\nThis was my first time here and my LAST. Anyone that does that to a customer deserves not to be around. The food was good, but not good enough for me to go back given the events that took place. The manager there needs to get his ass back into restaurant management classes instead of trying to pretend like he is the manager with his cheap ass suit.\n\nI was a waiter before and the CUSTOMER is not always right, but in this instance I feel that I am justified in writing this review. \n\nLet me cliff note this for the manager of Harris':\n\nIf YOUR people screw up, then YOU fix it. You don't tell the customer to fix something that YOU screwed up. \n\nAfter all that I didn't even get an apology, even though the valet was obviously apologetic.

Delicious!\n\nWe were meeting up with a large group of friends, one couple with a 6-month old baby.  We had our own private room - fancy, eh ... I just think they didn't want the baby to disturb the rest of their patrons - that's cool, I get it.  Either way, the baby didn't make a peep all night - now for the adults, that's a completely different story!\n\nStarted out the night with some perfectly shaken, chilled martinis (according to their site: Harris' martini is as meaty as the beef that hangs in the famous display window out front - huh ... interesting visual, but okay I'll run with that) and an order of deep fried mushrooms.  Let's just get this out of the way - when dining at Harris, at least this most recent experience of mine, eating low cal/low carb/low fat was not in the evening's plan ...\n\nFor my main course I enjoyed the Petite Filet Mignon.  Petite?  Not on your life.  Tender to the cut?  Cooked to order with perfection?  Abso-freaking-lutely.  There was plenty to satisfy my appetite with enough leftover for my friend to bring home for the next day.  He went large, feeling like big man on campus, he ordered the Executive Cut Prime Rib on the Bone.  For the love of early man.  This was a huge cut of beef.

The ambiance is old school classy but still has that SF casual atmosphere, excellent service that's not overwhelming, from the maitre d' to our waiter to the valet that stood out in the middle of Van Ness to hail us a cab. \n\nAlthough some of the filet preparations sounded temptingly delicious, I went for the American Kobe, which was well worth the $80 - perfectly tender, well seasoned without hiding the flavor of the well marbled beef and accompanied by some of the most savory scalloped potatoes I've ever run across. Aaron gave me a bite of his filet mignon, but even that was nowhere near as moist and tender as my American Kobe. Highly, highly recommended. They also now have Japanese Kobe as a regular item on the menu, but at $170, I'll have to wait a while to try that. After a meal like that, we decided to go with a lite dessert - the trio of sorbets, which were amazingly good. Aaron had told them it was my birthday, so one of the the sorbets had a little candle in it. Awww, how sweet.\n\nI adore this place and I'm putting it on my list of all-time favorites. With quality, atmosphere and taste like this, Harris' is going to be one of my go-to spots for special occasions and ill-advised splurges.

We always get the steak tartare, which is the best I've ever had.  The last time I was there I ordered the prime rib, which was delicous.  The only thing I would changes is to get the prime rib cut English style because the portion I received was pretty thick.

In a word, I was obsessed.  Perhaps it was the fact that as it is two blocks away from our place, I was constantly passing by it.  Perhaps it was the font that they stole from Harrod's.  Perhaps it was the nearly pornographic manner in which I viewed the menu with its pricey steaks, broke from all my moving expenses.  Most likely, it was those damn steaks in the window, in their various states of the 21 day aging process, some hale and red, others intriguing with their deep plum color and questionable freshness.  \n\nI decided that when I had a really good sales day, I would take the bf and I to Harris'.  That day came, and buoyed by all the positive Yelp reviews, there we were in Harris'.  Now, even though this is pretty much a glowing review of Harris', I beg of you: do not overly build up the steak house.  Eating there the first time, I think I was mildly disappointed, by no fault of the food or the service.  I'm not sure what I was expecting...unicorn steak?  I was mildly meh that night, perhaps because of my mythical build up of the place.\n\nHowever, within a couple of days, I thought...hmmmm, Harris'.  That was pretty damn delicious.  And, in fact, whenever I am in need of steak in my belly, Harris' is really my only consideration.  I am fond of the Harris', a nice big New York steak.  The little crispy bread pieces with the cheddar/wine butter, as well as the home made bread served immediately afterward, are tasty signs of what's to come.  The Caesar salad is quite excellent.  The potatoes are delicious, and they were quite kind about letting my temporarily low carb sorry self substitute creamed spinach for those delicious potatoes.  Oh, and the wine list is worth a read just to marvel at the sheer bulk of the thing.  Usually I go for the wine by the glass, but in a group, deciding on a bottle out of all the choices is mind boggling.  I consider that to be a good thing.\n\nSo, to recap: no unicorn steak.  But damn tasty vittles in a cool, relaxed old school atmosphere, with impeccable service and most likely the best steaks in town.", "author": "Tanya N."}

My sister decided to set up a dinner date for us, it was the best wedding gift, she even selected our entire menu for us! On that note, she also told me she had a great experience working with the restaurant to select our menus paired with wines. \n\nWhen we arrived, the restaurant was completely full, the ambiance was lively. They sat us in their Library Room in the back of the restaurant, which is a little more quiet than the main dining room where there is booth seating. Our printed menus were set underneath our linen napkins. The server was really nice and since we didn't have to order anything, dinner was served a few minutes after we were seated. \n\nWe started off with the half dozen oysters and crab cakes, both very fresh and good. The salad, baby spinach salad with apple wood smoked bacon, pine nuts, mushrooms, soy vinaigrette was okay, seemed a bit dry but not bad.  \n\nFor the entree selections, we had the Imported Japanese Kobe, a 13 oz ribeye cut of authentic, imported boneless Wagyu beef and the Filet mignon Rossini, a filet mignon with grilled foie gras and black truffle Cabernet sauce. Both entrees were sooo delicious and good. They were cooked to perfection as we both requested medium rare.  I do have to admit that the Japanese Kobe was fatty, but wow, it was so buttery. I think that people should try this expensive dish at least once in their life. I was eating everything with a big smile on my face. \n\nWe had assorted desserts, bread pudding, cheesecake with boysenberries, pineapple sorbet and the coconut sorbet. All the desserts were really good and the sorbets were perfect after the rich entrees. \n\nLoved the experience, loved the pianist, loved the atmosphere and love love loved the food!

The crowd is sophisticated and not over boisterous, maybe because there is enough distance with every half-moon booth.  \n\nStarting with appetizers, now the portion here is very filling, so unless you plan to share the entree steak like me, it'd be smart to order no more than 1.   \n\nOn to the appetizers, My personal favorite is the Sweetbreads sauteed with wild mushrooms and cream.   The meat is very tender and melts almost like Foie Gras, and filling is excellently finished with succulent flavor.  \n\nIf you feel there is still some room for more before the main steak entree, I'd recomme the Baby Spinach Salad.  It tastes refreshing and not overly filling if shard by two.\n\nSteak Entree, after trying the Fillet Mignon, New York, Porterhouse, and Kobe Steak. Kobe Steak is the clear winner here.

We would always have to roll up our windows when passing and hold our breaths if we didn't catch the vent shutoff switch in my car in time.  The incredible sight of hundreds of cows all in a confined ranch along the road is something you don't see everyday (at least to a city boy like me).  My second favorite steak place ever! (My first being Donovan's in La Jolla).  I try to come here at least once every couple months because there simply isn't a better place for steak...combined with the excellent service (for the most part) to compliment their food.... \nEverything on their menu is delicious...even the free stuff is yummy...and by that I mean the complimentary toast and cheese...I almost got full off of those mini-toasties the first time I came here because I couldn't stop eating it...\n\nMy favorite's starters are the crab cakes and the half shelled oysters...mains have to be the Filet Mignon with the whole lobster (this costs an arm and a leg but it is worth it) and their Porterhouse cuts...not much to review on the food...it is always above par.\n\nFor an intimate and romantic evening...remember to always make reservations because the main dining room is beautiful, classy, and very romantic....without reservations they will seat you in the bar/lounge area which isn't bad..but a little too loud at times.  The bar area is a much more casual dining experience with the same menu...with the benefit of a live band that's makes the dining experience very relaxed and cool.  \n\nI've always had top notch service in the main room...however on a few instances in the bar/lounge dining room, I was forced to constantly waive down servers and wait for my glasses to be filled.  I feel like the servers in the main room are much more attentive from my experience.\n\nOverall....Legit steakhouse for the city but def not the best...not incredibly hard to get a reservation in the main dining room...but even without a reservation...it is very possibly to get a seat even on a Sat night at the bar room.  I suspect this is because the food is so expensive in this current down economy.  I love that the this steakhouse is also only a block away from the best Prime Rib in SF (House of Prime Rib).

I still go back and enjoy a different atmosphere, but I always go back to Harris' for the meat.\n\nOK, we have sufficiently set the scene that they are the best.  But what should you eat there.  The fillet is always wonderful and I have never been disappointed by the Harris' Steak (bone-in New York), but my personal favorite is the Kobe Ribeye.  Every time it is perfectly ribboned with fat and the meat is tender and absolutely packed with flavor - I am salivating just thinking about it.  The Japanese Kobe Ribeye is also fantastic, but I am not sure it is enough more fantastic to justify the additional cost.\n\nIn the end, many try, but there is only one Harris'.

The decor exemplifies old school class - it was nice to stroll through the bar room, with its impressive dark wood carvings and three-piece jazz band.

Both were tremendously tender and the knife cut through my rib eye like butter.  Being the first time we had aged meat, the best way to describe it is it tastes like a cow.  It had a very beefy taste, and thats a good thing.  If you're trying to choose which cut, I'd say you already know, its the cut you are most likely to buy at a store when spoiling yourself.  The New York and Ribeye we had both had their distinct flavor, but i would actually go with the New York or Filet Rossini next time.  The ribeye is definitely more tender though.  \n       The sides are kind of limited, but the basic is the snap peas/carrots and scalloped or mashed potatoes.  The scalloped potatoes are very good with a note of rosemary.   They have other sides you can order too, like mushrooms.  \n       Dessert, we had the banana creme creme brulee with peanut crust.

Even though, I could have paid 10 bucks and tips for valet, I figured my dollar would be better well spent for a two block stroll from the premises.\n\nUpon arrival, we were seated in the bar where they had live music which was fantabulous.

Last time I had a Porterhouse was at the Penthouse strip club in NY. It was a very enjoyable piece of meat and the girls of course, but the meat at Harris was decent but small and not quite enjoyable at Penthouse. Same goes for the Ribeye. \n\nHarris' is almost the same as Alexanders in Cuptertino. But Alexanders offers more options, varieties and course meals. I wanted to order a course meal at Harris but you have to be in a banquet group which sucked. \n\nBut the service was decent and professional. The place is pretty old but lots of history. If you read one of the reviews from Harris' which used to be known as 'something else' on the wall, you could buy a steak for 3.49 or something like that back in the 1950s...

We had a full run of the menu: fresh oysters and crab cakes to ignite the appetite, spinach salad with apple wood-smoked bacon, pine nuts, mushrooms to bridge the gap, and then the steaks.

I'm more about flavor in a steak than texture so generally order NY steak style cuts.  The cuts here are marbled, aged, and mouth watering.  I've also sampled the filet mignon courtesy of my dining mates and from ordering the porterhouse once (which is essentially a new york steak and filet mignon combined on the bone) and found it to especially flavorful without any sacrifice on the texture.  \n\nAlso, if you can't get a reservation for the time you want, you can always walk in and wait for a spot in the lounge where there are other tables and bar seats.  We couldn't get a reservation until 10 and walked in and seated immediately in the lounge.  With the jazz band playing, I thought the seats were actually better than those in the main dining room.  The complimentary warm bread and cheese spread is tasty also so be careful not to to stuff yourself with carbs before the highlight of the meal arrives.

My husband helped by saying he wanted Cabernet so that helped limit the selection to 2 pages. Our waitress was really enthusiastic and helpful in helping me choose a bottle of wine that would suit everyone's entree. I believe we finally settled on a 2006 Duckhorn Cabernet Sauvignon (our waitress favorite) and it was really delicious. Nice color, soft texture and just the right amount of fruitiness without being overly sweet. Very easy to drink.\n\nFood:\n- the complimentary toast and cheese spread is really good. Taste just like cheese-it crackers\n- the toast & salmon spread starter was also really good. It came with my 3 course meal. \n- My 3 course meal for $55 consist of ceasar, buffalo New York steak, and chocolate tart.  The ceasar was good but couldn't finish it because it was a really large plate. \n\n***and now why my review for this place is only 3 stars***\n1. I was warned that my buffalo new york steak would be very lean. It was very lean and just too meaty for me. Plus it was huge 12oz. I ate maybe 1/3 of it and got full. It was also drenched in some mushroom bourdeaux sauce (?) and made the dish very salty. My meat was cooked right - medium rare but it was just too lean for my taste. I didn't enjoy my entree very much so I can only give this place an A-OK.\n\n2. had several bites of my husband's filet mignon and it was also very tough. Doesn't melt in your mouth the way Ruth's Chris does.\n\n3. Had a bite of my friend's Rib-Eye. Better. It was good. If I do go back I would probably order that cut.\n\nOther food:\n- mashed potato. Very good, buttery, garlic-y.\n- veggies: snow peas. Crunchy. Sweet.\n- chocolate tart: not bad.

For some reason, I have set Harris's up on a pedestal since I've eaten here 10 years ago.  I've been ranting and raving saying this was the best steakhouse in the bay area.  However, dinner last night was quite the opposite. \n\nI ordered the filet mignon medium rare, which shockingly came out medium/medium well. The outer part of the steak was more medium well, and the center part was the only part closest to medium rare, but still over cooked.  Our server was nice enough to have them make another one for me.  The next one came out rare!  The server had to take it back again, and have them cook it a little longer.  After the third attempt, they finally got it right.  The steak was good, but not great!  I've had better and it was beyond disappointing.  How can such an established steakhouse not know how to cook steak properly, and get it wrong not once, but two times?!?  My husband ordered the 15 oz. kobe steak for $74, which he enjoyed, but said Forbes was better.  \n\nSo hands down, the filet mignon at Forbes Mill House in Los Gatos tastes way better.  Although, you have to order the sides a la carte, the steak is not too salty, nor do you taste the char from the grill, and when you order the steak medium rare, the entire steak is cooked to perfection.   The interior is more modern.  They also have a kobe/lobster tail dinner for $67 and it is delish!   My husband gets that every time, and we share the giant, succulent lobster tail.  \n\nOverall, if I'm craving a nice steak dinner, I'm heading to Forbes.

I could eat that for my main.  The fried onion rings and fried mushrooms are also GREAT.  A bit of a denser, flavorful batter that is DELICIOUS.\n\nSoups/Salads: I've had the French Onion and the Caesar and really enjoyed them both.\n\nSides: Creamed spinach is just OK.  I don't really recommend that.  Everything else is pretty tasty.\n\nTHE STEAK!!!!:  I usually get The Harris Steak - a bone-in New York.  Just a really delicious and perfectly cooked piece of meat.  I've had a few of the other cuts and they've all been great examples of each cut.  You can't go wrong with the meat choice here.

For entrees, I had the 18oz ribeye and it was my favorite out of all of the entrees. It was cooked just right and the buttermilk potatoes and snap peas that came with it were excellent as well. The rest of my family had the Filet Mignon Rossini, the pepper steak, and I can't remember what else but the ribeye was the best. For dessert, we had the creme brulee and the fruit crumble.

Absolutely amazingly soft grilled foie gras with black truffle placed on top of a perfect cut of filet mignon, then topped off with perfectly flavored cabernet sauce.  47 bones for the cut, who cares, I would have paid $100.  Totally worth every bite.  The decor was kind of dated, old, and cheesy, but most steakhouses are.  The live piano was a nice touch, and the service was flawless.  Take you Mom, your Dad, your Grandma, and you Nieces, they will love you for it.  Oh, and bring your credit card too, our bill for a table of twelve was $1477.  Yikes!", "author": "Curran J."}

Oysters weren't the best but also not the worst. Just \"eh\" in my opinion.\n\nFrench onion soup: NO MELTED CHEESE?! I love the melted cheese on french onion soup but theirs was soooooooooo good, it didn't need it. The soup was sweet without being over bearing and every bite tasted of rich oniony goodness. You could really tell they took their time making it and making sure to slowly cook down the onions. Order this for sure. YUMMM! The bf and I LOVED this.\n\nBaby spinach salad: Super fresh spinach, crispy bacon, lots of pinenuts, fresh mushrooms and a nice tangy/sour soy vinaigrette.\n\nWine list was daaaaaaaaaaaaaamn long. I went cross eyed just reading it. The waitress was really nice and helped suggest a couple bottles. \n\nSat in a HUGGGGGE booth that was meant to seat way more than two people which was nice. The whole restaurant is pretty dark and romantic... except for the giant countryside mural with grazing cows on the wall. A bit weird in my opinion... \n\nOnto the main attraction...\n\nFollowing the advice of many many MANY fellow yelpers, I jumped on the bandwagon and got the filet mignon rossini. It did not disappoint! The foie gras was perfectly seared and not bitter like how cheap foie gras can get when overly cooked. And they sure didn't skimp on the foie gras cause it was a damn big piece! The filet was tender yet firm, very juicy and rich and with the black truffle and cabernet sauce.... *drooool*. I can't even begin to describe the sauce. Rich and full of flavor, but light, it was a great compliment to the filet. A cream based sauce would've just given me a heart attack.\n\nOhmigawd... the scalloped potatoes... were... the BEST scalloped potatoes I've ever had. Creamy and cheesy with a crispy baked cheese crust, the potatoes had the perfect consistency too. They were cooked tender but not mushy. I would go back just to eat a plate of their scalloped potatoes.\n\nThe porterhouse kicked the bf's ASS. It was bigger than his head. Ok bigger than his head AND mine combined. It was insanely huge (pix to be posted soon) and juicy and very simple with the yummy natural meats juices and flavor coming out. Just a really well cooked huge steak. No frou frou sauces or anything. Just a great steak. Wait, there was a dollop of butter on it. Nothing too special and it was definitely a compliment and didn't take away from the steak. \n\nSidenote: I am a beast when I eat and was gettin all hot and sweaty when my delicious filet came out but I didn't have a hair tie! The nice watress, and a bunch of the other staff members, ran around looking for a rubberband for me. The little hostess lady found one. Great staff and service!", "author": "Beverly T."}

I don't know a whole lot about steaks, I'm definitely no meat expert, but I've had plenty of them in my time.  I love steaks and I can say without a doubt that Harris' knows what they are doing.\n\nThey keep it simple and the way any good steak should be cooked: with some salt and pepper and NOTHING ELSE.  No fancy sauces or reduction mumbo-jumbo.  All you get is perfectly (I don't use that term lightly) cooked aged beef that melts in your mouth.  The taste is apparent and the quality is unrivaled.  \n\nI also had their crab cakes and scalloped potatoes which were both really awesome.  Way better than the average appetizer/sides you can usually get.\n\nThis is one of the few expensive (let's say more the $50 a person) places where I can truthfully say \"you get what you pay for\".  Every little morsel if worth your cash.\n\nA couple of tips:  \n- Don't be afraid to ask about the differences between cuts - they'll gladly explain\n- Be specific as you want about the way you want your meat cooked, these people are pros and understand that everyone is different\n- Everything is a la carte, so don't expect a side with your steak - but trust me, that hefty price tag is worth it", "author": "Brent T."}

Ordered the spinich salad - big portion and a great mix of flavors.  Main course was the porter house steak, scalloped potatoes and asparagus.

Scalloped potatoes were tender, rich and delicious.  Asparagus was good but nothing special.  Had a nice red wine with dinner too.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-06-23", "description": "So I went with my younger sister a few weeks ago for the first time since we were very little. My mom took us there around 15 years ago when I was about 6 years old. The asshole concierge at the hotel we were staying at suggested we go there even though we were dressed in sweats. My mom says they were incredibly accommodating even though we weren't dressed properly.\n\nAnyway, a few weeks ago I went with my sister and it was wonderful. We went on a thursday and had reservations at around 6:45pm (we dressed nicely this time). The man who sat us was extremely nice and asked us if we wanted to sit in the library room (this really small off-shoot room from the regular dining room with only four tables). My little sister and I said sure and they lit a fire in there for us before we even got in the room. It was very cozy. He took our drink orders before taking off to do his regular duties. \n\nWhen our server first came she brought our drinks with her. She was very nice and chatted a bit with us as we were the only ones in the room. I ordered a cosmopolitan and my sister got a Shirley Temple. My cosmo came in a little carafe inside of a tiny barrel full of ice. Too cute for words. The glass came chilled with a lime speared on a stick and the waitress poured it out for me every time she came around. My little sister's Shirley Temple was quite good as well. \n\nThe bread was a bit hard, which we thought was hilarious and we tried many different ways of eating it in a dignified manner, but that wasn't gonna happen :). We also got these weird hard bread chips that came with this kind of cream-cheesy salmon dip. They were tasty but had the consistency of biscotti, ouch.  \n\nAppetizers: \nSweetbreads with wild mushrooms and cream. If anyone doesn't know what sweetbreads are, they are the thymus gland of a calf or a lamb. To be honest, it was a bit weird. I'm glad they had the sauce...the texture was really good though. \nOysters on a half shell: tasty\n\nMain course: \nMy sister had the filet mignon with asparagus and scalloped potatoes. She absolutely adored it. \nI had the petite filet with whole steamed Maine lobster. It came on a platter along with clarified butter, scalloped potatoes and asparagus. They took the claw meat out of the shell for me and cut the tail in half. I gave half of the lobster to my little sister because I really couldn't eat all that so essentially we both got steak and lobster ;). The lobster was buttery and delicious, I've discovered that I love claw meat. The filets were wonderful and cooked perfectly (medium is my favorite). The asparagus was wonderful as well. \n\nAbout this time i got another cosmo and was feeling a bit loopy. We got tasty desserts,  chocolate cake with espresso chip ice cream and a trio of sorbets which my little sister asked for a substitution for the coconut sorbet and they were more than happy to oblige. \n\nOverall, a wonderful experience that I would suggest anyone have. I don't like wine with my food (I know, I'm a freak) so I didn't taste that although there were some Napa wine assholes who were there swilling it around, sniffing it and basically acting like they were gods of the universe. Oi. Just drink the f*cking wine and shut up.\n\nIt's good for kids if your kids are well behaved. Don't take little monsters in there. When we went there when we were really little, we were good kids. My mom says that other patrons came up to our table to say that they could never have brought their children in there.", "author": "Alicia L."}

I forget, that might be a ski brand). The filet mignon + foie gras was good because of the sauce, but the foie gras was dissapointing. The rib eye was bad, dry, no flavor, nothing special, rough texture.

Shortly after being ensconced in a leather-wrapped, semi-circular booth, it occurred to me that I should have visited this place sooner.  The Eagle Rare Manhattan, served in a miniature, ice-encased wine cask, only strengthened my hope that I had, at long last, found a place in SF where I could simultaneously slake my thirst for good steak and meaningful tradition.\n\nI'll be back in the high life again\nAll the doors I closed one time will open up again\nI'll be back in the high life again\nAll the eyes that watched me once will smile and take me in\nAnd I'll drink and dance with one hand free\nLet the world back into me\nAnd oh I'll be a sight to see\nBack in the high life again\n=====================\nWhat is a visit to a steakhouse without the traditional eating of the iceberg lettuce wedge?  And what am I, if not a consummate traditionalist.  Harris' throws a bit of a knuckleball here, serving the wedge with \"chef's choice\" dressing.  I joked to my dining partners that the chef has likely chosen blue cheese for the past 17 years.  I was wrong, and my wedge came with dill ranch.  Delicious, if not necessarily traditional.\n\nYou used to be the best\nTo make life be life to me\nAnd I hope that you're still out there\nAnd you're like you used to be\nWe'll have ourselves a time\nAnd we'll dance 'til the morning sun\nAnd we'll let the good times come in\nAnd we won't stop 'til we're done\n==================================\nThe porterhouse steak was excellent, and Harris' proved they know what \"medium well\" actually means.  I chose the \"potato of the day\" because it happened to be scalloped.  I asked the waiter to explain what they thought scalloped potatoes meant.  As I told him shortly afterward, he had me at \"cream and melted cheese.\"  Based on my experience at the other end of the steak production line, I cringed when my porterhouse was $48, but you're frankly not going to get it for any cheaper anywhere else that's reputable.\n\nWe'll be back in the high life again\nAll the doors I closed one time will open up again\nWe'll be back in the high life again\nAll the eyes that watched us once will smile and take us in\nAnd we'll drink and dance with one hand free\nAnd have the world so easily\nAnd oh we'll be a sight to see\nBack in the high life again\n===============================================\nBecause I am who I've always been, I opted for a liquid dessert.  The Graham's 1991 port was decent, but not as tawny as I had hoped.  A decent reminder that life can't always work out exactly the way you hope.\n\nPost-script [really more of a pre-script]: one of the double-edged tricks of selectively excellent memory is that I still clearly remember, and can only anticipate that I will always clearly remember, that late fall day, circa 1992, when I drove into school to attend play rehearsal.  I was wearing a white-and-black checked silk shirt, because that's what people did back then, and listening to Steve Winwood remind me that you can always get back what you once lost.  The song made sense to me, because I intended that very night to get back the girlfriend I had lost by being stupid.  I remember, too, how all that turned out.  But what I prefer to remember is that perfect, sunset-drenched moment of perfect hope and pure music, where the plan seemed as fool-proof as anything I had ever envisioned, and the payoff looked as tantalizing as anything I could ever imagine.  At a minimum, the memory serves to remind me that my excessive optimism has deep roots in my personal history, even though it may not always pay off.", "author": "Ben P."}

For you risk takers and those who love to live on the edge, maybe yelp isn't for you. Joking! Don't get me wrong, I'm a very adventurous person. BUT. When it comes to food, and when it comes to paying a hell of a lot of money for food, I'd rather not be a (insert name of resto) virgin. \n\nSo. With that said. I read a lot of yelp reviews on Harris' and looked at all 194 pictures. And scoped out the menu on the website. All before coming here for mother's day dinna. Some of you may think that takes all the fun out of the experience. Nope. I was prepared. And didn't look like a newbie, suckas.\n\n1) Party of 5, seated in a booth. One yelp review said something about the hostess pulling out the table to make it easier to get in. Was not done for us. So I was forced to awkwardly bounce and slide across the booth. In a dress. Call me a pro. \n\n2) Comp crostini with butta and cheese shmear. Some reviews say salmon spread, others say cheese spread. Def cheese, not salmon, peeps. This was brought to our table right away. I knew they served bread also (thanks to the pics!) so I asked for that also. SO good. Warm, crusty....mmm. Sounds like I'm describing someone's feet. Everyone gets their own piece of bread, so you don't have to rush to make sure you can grab another piece off the communal plate other restaurants give you. \n\n3) Appetizers: steak tartar, oysters, smoked salmon. \nI'm really not a fan of raw things. Raw veggies, yes. Raw steak? Oh no. I did try a bite, though (told you I'm adventurous), and it really wasn't that bad. It had a slight peppery bite to it, and it was served with the same crostini as the comp, but larger. Oysters - THAT is something I will not eat raw. When I grow a pair, I will. Smoked salmon was DELISH! Served with crostini, a little drizzle of balsamic (I think), capers, diced shallots, and a dollop of cream cheese. MMM. \n\n4) Lamb chops: I love lamb, baah. LOVE IT. So when I saw a picture, I knew that was going to be my order. However, out of all the reviews I read, I didn't read anything about the lamb. Here it is. 3 chops, served with veggies and baked potato/potato of the day. The chops are a good size, a little on the small side, but hey you get three. I asked for them to be cooked medium, and they were cooked to perfection. So juicy, so tasty. My only complaints: 1) A little too much fat on the chops. Okay, there wasn't thaaat much fat, but there was enough to make my mouth feel oily and greasy. Hate that feeling. 2) The mint sauce that comes on the side. WHY DIDN'T ANYONE WRITE ABOUT THIS?? This is biased, obvi personal opinion. I hate fresh mint, absolutely hate it. Upon first glance, I had no idea what kind of sauce it was. I usually dip the tip of my fork in things to taste, but my dumba** used the end of my knife and ended up getting way more than needed. I kid you not, the moment that sauce touched my tongue I wanted to throw up. Again, biased because I hate fresh mint. I sat there for a second, not letting myself swallow the sauce, before throwing all etiquette out the window and spitting it out in my napkin (discreetly!). Oh boy. That sauce was a no no. \n\nI would continue and write what the rest of my table ordered, but I'd be repeating what everyone else has said. Long story short: a) prime rib executive cut is freaking huge. b) servers bring a little tray of sour cream, chives, butter for the baked potatoes, and horseradish for the prime rib. c) scalloped potatoes were yums. d) kobe beef has a good amount of fat in it. \n\n\nWould I come here again? Most likely not, only because ya girl is BROKE. Do I want to come here again? Forsure. \n\nAnd thank you peeps for letting me know there is peanut toffee/whatever-it-is to grab on the way out.

The ambiance in the place is definitely old school as a lot of the other reviewers have said. Low lights, leather booths and great servers.\n\nWe started off the meal with their special mussels & a bottle of Honig Cab. The mussels were topped with a garlic tomato broth and complemented with sausage. Delish. We went through the bread basket dipping it in the sauce.\n\nThe Caesar salad was also yummy (with a sardine), but I would probably cut it if I were to do it over. We had enough food with everything else and who needs lettuce when you are devouring yummy steak? Leave healthy at the door.\n\nFor dinner my boyfriend ordered the Filet Mignon Rossini. Filet topped with foie gras & black truffle Cabernet sauce. Since truffles are are arguably one of my favorite flavors in the world, I ordered the same thing and told the server that I thought I would be jealous if he had it and I didn't. Her response, \"You would.\" Dinner came, and she did not lie. I ordered mine medium rare and it came on the rarer side, which is more than fine by me. Savory and delish. We both left stuffed but are looking forward to the leftovers :)\n\nOverall, great food in a cool atmosphere. Not cheap though, so save it for a special occasion.", "author": "Katie W."}

The Boyfriend is a Carnivore among carnivores so when deciding where to go, I checked Yelp's steakhouse reviews. Harris' certainly lives up to its 4.5 stars. For starters, this place is very Man, by which I mean that it has dark wood paneling, rich brown leather couches and chairs with tapestry-like fabric depicting stags or horses (couldn't tell which). I half-expected to see old white gentlemen swirling brandy and puffing on cigars while discussing the latest railroad transactions. The walls are covered with murals of lakes and forests and the like. But on to the food.\n\nThe menu is very simple. You have your standard cuts of meat as well as two seafood options (salmon and lobster). In addition to the regular cuts they also have kobe beef and a special imported kobe beef -  the latter priced at a hefty $170. The Boyfriend started off with the oysters while I had the shrimp bisque. He enjoyed the oysters immensely (I am not a shellfish kind of girl) but the shrimp bisque was so-so. It seemed to lack enough flavor to be really tasty. \n\nWhile we were waiting for our main course (49er cut - boneless New York for him and filet mignon for me with scalloped potatoes for both), we nibbled on the bread chips with spreadable cheese and butter as well as the large crusty bread they provided. To be honest, this part wasn't particularly impressive. It was reminiscent, as the Boyfriend remarked, of Handi Snacks. \n\nWhen the meal came out, though, it looked delicious. The cuts were larger than I expected and it smelled wonderful. Along with the excellent scalloped potatoes came snap peas (which I love). We also ordered a side of button mushrooms. The meat was tender, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. I don't like the blood to run when I cut into my meat so I ordered it medium while the Boyfriend had his 49er medium rare. Filets, as you might know, are more tender than the other cuts but the New York is more flavorful. Both were excellent. Harris' has an extensive wine and drinks list so I had a glass of cabernet sauvignon and the Boyfriend had some Glen Morangie. \n\nThe service was not impeccable but nothing to complain about. The hostess was a bit cold but our waiter was very attentive. I asked if there was anything special for the Boyfriend, seeing as how it was his birthday, and he brought out a scoop of ice cream (vanilla or chocolate, your choice) in a little waffle tart with a candle. \n\nOverall, this place is great. I've had better mushrooms (K.O. Prime) and better service (Aujourd'hui) but I've yet to have better filet mignon.", "author": "Christine P."}

So do I need to add to the glory that is Harris' Restaurant? \n\nOf course I do! Because it's just that good! I'll do my best to break this review down into little parts, from start to finish:\n\n1) The Wait: Like many have said already, we made reservations about 3 days before but still waited about 30 mins. Nothing new coming from a fancy restaurant. Unfortunately, Harris' did NOT offer free wine the same way that Pacific Cafe does. =(\nHowever, they did offer free matches and peanut brittle. If you like fire and peanuts like me, that's always a good thing.\n\n2) After being seated: The waiter was a pretty friendly dude. Always a plus. While you wait, they give little toasted bread chips with salmon cream cheese, which hit the spot. Just be sure not to fill yourself up too much with that stuff. There was a live jazz band playing that night. Had I not been trying to beat Super Mario Bros on my DS, I would give you a more thorough review about the music, but from what I heard the band sounded pretty good!\n\n3) The Meal: I ordered the Porterhouse medium rare, with mashed potatoes and a side of creamed spinach. The potatoes were decent, nothing too special. The creamed spinach was quite delicious for me. I suggest it to anyone. Actually, I command you all to eat it with your steak. Do it. \n\nThe steak itself was really good. Perfectly cooked medium rare, with all its delicious juices and texture. I was quite impressed. My brother ordered kobe beef. If you can afford it, GET THE KOBE BEEF. It melts in your mouth in all its glory. That's only IF you can afford the $70 price tag. I personally can't, but I'm glad he can.\n\nIf you do decide to eat here, feel at ease knowing that you'll get what you pay for. The steak is great, especially with creamed spinach. The service is good, and the environment is classy. Being a college student, this will be the first and last time I'll be eating here during my college career because...well...I'm a college student. I think that's pretty self explanatory in terms of my financial status. \n\nBut hey, if you've got the money to afford it, then go for it. It's worth it.", "author": "Daniel M."}

Many high class places tend to treat you different by the clothes that you wear but I saw people in shorts, gold shirts and sandals and they treated everyone the same. \n\nThere was a Jazz Band playing in the background which mad for a good vibe in the dining room. The way they bring out the martini is pretty cool as well. It somes in a seperate \"jar\" in a barrel with ice and teh waiter pours it for you there.

It was just okay. \n\nThey definitely seem to appeal to a older crowd.. probably people who have been going here for years and have a regular date night here. It also seemed like a popular place for business dinners (read: expense accounts). \n\nI think the wine list was decent and the ambience is the closest to a classic steak house that I've come across in SF, so that part was nice.

It has been on my list for a while and I was itching to give out 5 stars since its been quite a while.  Alas, not 5 stars in my book, but still an excellent restaurant.\n\nAPPETIZER:\nI took one of my fellow yelper's recommendations and ordered the oysters as an appetizer ($13 for 6).  Our server either missed our order or forgot and brought out the steaks.  He was extremely apologetic and even comped our oysters.  These oysters were probably the best I've ever had.    They came with three different sauces, but I just stuck with a lemon and a little cocktail sauce.\n\nENTREE:\nI ordered the FILET MIGNON ROSSINI (filet mignon with grilled Sonoma foie gras and black truffle, cabernet sauce) for $46.  I had my steak Medium Rare and it was very tender and juicy.  Probably one of the best steaks I've had.\n\nI also had a chance to try some of my friend's HARRIS STEAK which was also very good.  It has a nice seasoned crust on the outside and very tender on the inside.  After having the filet mignon, the Harris Steak just doesnt compare.\n\nDESSERT:\nI ordered the Creme Brulee which was pretty big.  The custard was excellent.  The caramel crust was a little too sweet for my taste.  \n\nOVERALL:\nOverall a good experience.  I would probably come back, but I definitely want to try the other great steak places in the city.  Excellent restaurant, but I wasn't especially blown away by anything, except for their fabulous oysters.", "author": "Bert N."}

She was snobby, cold and muttered under her breath. \n\nWe had the clams and the crab cakes for appetizers and they were both delicious. I mopped up the clam juices with their yummy crusty bread. Everyone else got a salad or a soup, but I just took a bite out of my bf's ceasar salad. It was super yummy w/ real anchovies on it. For the main course, I had the filet mignon rossini... filet mignon with a slice of foie gras on top. O.M.G. that was seriously orgasmic. The meat was cooked perfectly and the foie gras literally melted in my mouth. There was a side of mashed potatoes and some green beans. The green beans were perfectly tender and cooked-- not mushy or chewy. The mashed potatoes were to die for. I really wanted to eat them all, but there was just no room.\n\nFor dessert, the bday boy had the creme brulee, his mom had croissant bread pudding and his dad and sister had ice cream. I just dipped my fork into everyone else's desserts! The creme brulee was soo delicious-- it had the perfect sugar crust on the top and the custard was still slightly warm.

Just the steak. The first bite, and my pants got tight. And by that, I don't mean I was anywhere near full yet, I mean I got a boner. A food boner. I went for the baked potato. It was just a good, standard baked potato, but the snap peas and carrots that came with the meal were delightfully crisp and delicious. My girl got the filet mignon rossini. I've got to say, the sauce on that was incredibly delicious and complimented the steak perfectly. Next time, I'm ordering that one. And giving her the extra foie gras since it aint my thang. The complimentary bread, crostini, and spread were all out of this world. The prawn cocktail was of course awesome. I wish I got more prawns, but I was expecting that.

And I want to go here to celebrate, but I'm afraid to make the reservations, because I'm afraid I'll jinx myself, fail, and have to call the restaurant and cancel, awash in shame and humiliation.  I mention this to my husband, and smart guy he is, made the reservations himself.  And I pass. Woo-hoo!!!\n\nWe were seated immediately, and were brought the little crostini type bread and some kind of fluffy buttery stuff. My husband and I agreed: tastes like Cheetos! (but in a good, non-chemical way).\n\nWe started with the steak tartare appetizer. It was insanely good and quite a plentiful portion.  It was chopped with onions and was delicious.\n\nMy son had the shrimp cocktail. He devoured it in roughly five minutes, so I assume it was good.  I can only assume, because when I started to grab a shrimp, I thought he was going to bite my hand.\n\nThe waiter was very friendly, but not overly so. We asked for help with our wine selection. He listened carefully and  helped us pick a wine that was just perfect.\n\nThen my husband and I each had the Filet Mignon Rossini, rare, which is the filet topped with Sonoma foie gras and cabernet sauce.  Or as I like to call it, freaking heaven on a fork.  God it was delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly.  This is key because as a female, when I order steak rare, I don't always get it rare, like they think I don't know what I'm doing when I order.\n\nWe had scalloped potatoes, and they were so rich and creamy it was amazing.  Kid had baked potato.  What can you say about a baked potato? It was a potato that had been baked.  He asked for sour cream and butter. Kid doesn't like creativity with his food.\n\nKid had the Harris steak, which was a thick cut, bone-in New York strip.  He loved it. He is quite the carnivore.\n\nTo finish up, I had the lemon tart.  It was perfect.  Let me put it this way, my son and husband both had chocolate desserts (a cake and a brownie sundae type thing), but I was so engrossed in my lemon tart that I did not even ask for a bite (if you know me, you would know that is really something).\n\nMy son's cake, according to him, was \"awesome.\"  My husband said his sundae was good \"but not the reason I came here.  The meat eclipses the sundae.\"\n\nOne other thing I'd like to add. My son drank a cherry 7-up with the appetizer, and immediately asked for another one. He didn't get it until he got his meal. Whether this was deliberate on the part of our waiter or not, I don't know, but I am very happy, because I don't like him sucking down endless sodas.  So if it was intentional, I salute you, sir!\n\nAll in all, a wonderful topper to what was a fantastic evening.  We will definitely be back.\n\nRe: Clothing\n\nMen, if you're thinking of taking your girl here, for God's sake, put on a damn tie.  I saw so many sloppy men there, with girls who looked like they'd obviously put time into their outfits, it was pathetic.  \n\nAn untucked shirt is NOT appropriate attire when you're slinging down $50 for a piece of meat (and that's just the meat).

However, I do have a weakness for good steak. In particular, filet mignon always does it for me. After having the best filet of my life at the Metropolitan in Seattle, I've been just slightly underwhelmed by the (still very good) steak I've had in SF. Bob's, House of Prime Rib, Boboquivari's, and Ruth's Chris are all spectacular, but in my book, barely miss the mark. It's not a surprise then that I was excited to finally give Harris' a try for the very first time.\n\nOverall, Harris' was wonderful. I usually loathe pretentious four-dollar-sign restaurants, but everything about Harris' made me feel immediately comfortable and welcome--from the incredibly attentive and hospitable service to the extravagant, yet charming decor that adorned the walls. Most importantly, the food was delectable. The crab cakes with beurre blanc were out-of-this world - without question, the most amazingly delicate, savory crab cakes I've ever tasted. Even the baked potato that accompanied my steak was top-notch - it's hard to cook a baked potato that one can say is far superior to any he or she has ever tasted, but Harris' manages to pull it off.\n\nThe only four star part of my dining experience - and undoubtedly the most important part - was the steak itself. I ordered the filet mignon Rossini - a petit filet with grilled foie gras and black truffle, cabernet sauce. Although the steak was really good, it probably ranks as the third or fourth best steak I've ever had (surprising only because of Harris' premiere reputation). Although I ordered my steak medium, the first filet I was served was an overcooked medium well and the second filet I was served was an undercooked medium rare. Thus, it was hard to fully appreciate the steak when it wasn't cooked the way I wanted it to be. Furthermore, the grilled foie gras was delicious, but not as great as I've tasted elsewhere. By the end of the meal, even though I had a really good steak, I guess my expectations were too high because I left just a tad disappointed. I expected the best steak of my life and got something that was delicious, but not worth the almost-$100 price tag.\n\nDespite this, Harris' undoubtedly provided a dining experience I won't soon forget. I am inclined to give it another shot and likely will when I have another $100 to fork over for dinner (i.e., not anytime in the near future).", "author": "Joseph F."}

The lounge area is very 'steakhouse' - lots of dark wood, dim lighting, overstuffed chairs, cozy booths, and a bar with many bottles/glasses/mirrors.

Definitely taking a taxi home.\n\nAnyway, I was referred here by a friend as they have a Kobe rib eye.  Husband loves steak and knows the quality of kobe beef and it is his birthday so since this steak is the most expensive steak that we've ever bought in our lives ($75), had to get it for him.  Bite for bite though not as expensive as the Shogun beef he had in Japan.  Upon reflecting on the quality and flavor of the meat, this was the best steak he'd ever had in his life.  That is saying a lot and wonderfully so as that would have been really disappointing.\n\nInstead of a bread basket you get sliced bread (croutons) with a wonderful fluffy cheese.  MMM.  I could have eaten this all night.  Started off with their shrimp bisque - HUGE!  Too huge in fact, no one can eat that bowl of soup and have room for a steak.  NOT FAIR.  I got a petite filet which actually wasn't as good as I had hoped, which is why this place is getting a 4 from me.  Not every will get the kobe steak, but many will probably get filets and it was just not as tasty as I would have liked.  I only had half of my filet, what a shame.  The buttermilk mashed potatoes were just ok as well.  \n\nBut the DESSERT...heavenly.  We had the apple pear and ginger cobbler, as well as their chocolate cake with raspberry sauce.

It's what you deserve for an occasion that's special for you.\n\nDeparting from steak purism (which, in high quality steak houses is the way to go) I order the Steak Dianne regularly. No one makes it as good as Harris' does. Not Ruth's Cris or Morton's or any of the high-end chain steak places. I also go here because their wine list is immense but they have an excellent sommelier to help guide you through it to find \"a California cab that's bold but silky, complex but well-rounded and oh yeah - that's $45 or less please\". They hook you up without even a quirked eyebrow. \n\nEat light at lunch so that you can enjoy the potato du jour or/as well as their excellent steak tartare, oysters or fried onion rings. All very good but these rings deserve special mention because it's virtually impossible to find a real onion ring anywhere that cannot be pulled out of it's batter. Your incisors will slice through each bite with never the unpleasant, flapping-greasy-onion-against-your-chin experience. \n\nUse the valet parking, it's ten bucks and worth that unless you simply cannot drive without the incredible sense of victory upon finding a spot off Van Ness having circled each nearby block for 15 minutes.", "author": "Ben S."}

The bread that accompanied was soft and warm. Each salad was not overdressed and a nice portion- not oversized to fill you up too much for dinner.\n\nI had the petit filet- medium. The temperature was perfect, the accompanying potatoes were nicely mashed and flavored with garlic. The overal meal was wonderful. Our waiter chose for us a nice cab from Stag's Leap which was the perfect combination to enhance the flavor of the meat. \n\nThe atmosphere was great, great music, live and not too loud.

To be honest, I was probably a bit under-dressed for this place, but they didn't say anything to me about it. They treated us just as if we were high-class businessmen. Our meal was pretty much perfect. My girlfriend had the steak and lobster and I had the oysters and the chicken. They seemed to know the exact right amount of time to cook the chicken so that it was cooked all the way through and no longer. Perfect. The service was excellent and the food also excellent.

It also helps that I live one block from the restaurant so am often tempted by the hanging meat in the window. Been here many times and recently went for a good friend's birthday dinner. We had a large group of 10 and unfortunately, had to wait 30 minutes for our table but the hostess was very polite and offered us a couple of appetizers on the house.\n\nEvery time I eat at Harris', I get the same thing and it's always superb - caesar salad (extra anchovies) and the filet mignon with the seared foie gras on top. Absolutely the most scrumptious combination in every bite!  Definitely opt for the scalloped potatoes and you won't be sorry! The fried calamari is also tasty. They had a crab and avocado special salad that was pretty good as well. The ribeye, porterhouse, and peppered steak are also solid options. You can't really go wrong with anything here. \n\nGood tip - If you bring a bottle of wine and buy a bottle, they waive the $25 corkage fee. The wine here is a little pricey so if you have enough people for 2 bottles, bringing a bottle is a nice option.", "author": "Josephine H."}

If you like your meat with no butter (like Ruth's Chris) and little flavoring that this is probably your place. The meat was kind of dry and I didn't really get the aged flavor. I would recommend getting the NY Rib Eye instead. The meat was juicier and tasty. \n\nThe setting of the place was very professional, all the tables were nicely cushioned boothes.

I actually ate 3 crockers of the cheese butter, and I'm a tiny woman. Then we ordered steak for my husband, crab cakes and a spinach salad for me.

Its alright. We sat in the corner and played games on our phones and people watched (trust me...this was HILARIOUS!). The staff was wonderful. They let us know when we were next on the list and the exact status of our table. I was appreciative as I started to get a little restless. \n\nI ordered the Porterhouse and a glass of Chardonnay. The meal was fantastic. I couldn't have asked for more. I wouldn't say it was a 5 star meal...but definitely a high 4 star occasion!  Our server was wonderful...the musicians in the corner were fantastic. Being New Years, the ceiling was full of balloons and the staff was fun and festive. \n\nIt was a quiet New Years...but not one I'll forget anytime soon. Thanks Harris'!", "author": "Hilary G."}

True, it may be the best \"Steak Place\" in the city, but there are other restaurants serving better steak. In fact, when we were there last they burnt both our steaks (serves us right for ordering medium-a-little-rare, and not rare). The butcher shop is, without being too harsh, a joke. I'd rather whore my husband out in the Tenderloin (to make enough money) and mail order from Lobel's (although we had some pretty crap experiences with them, too), Niman Ranch or Allen Brothers and pay for the shipping (which could buy you a steak or two from the supermarket). The side dishes here are lackluster at best. \r\n\r\nThe Space/Ambiance: Old world meets diner? Unlike aged & seasoned meat, an aged & seasoned wait staff does not always equal \"better\". Their service was not bad, but hey, you'd be a little crotchety too, if you were serving on brats your grandchildren's age. \r\n\r\nPrice: Not too bad for one of SF's finest steak places, but since I'm a reverse vegetarian, I expect more for my money. \r\n\r\nTip: Try Boboquivaris on Lombard when they're not crowded and you'll (hopefully) get some good steak.", "author": "B C."}

On a whimsical and financially irresponsible decision, we ordered the imported japanese wagyu, a bottle of wine, some 9 dollar spinach (which is only significant because it was so out of place on the receipt), and some Louis. All I could think was, this 170 dollar steak better be worth it. And I can safely state that it was worth every penny.\n\nAs a disclaimer, this was imported wagyu from Japan, not the other \"cheaper\" domestic alternative on the menu, which was expensive in its own right. I have not had wagyu in Japan, so I cannot compare whether this is better or worse. But compared to all, and I mean every ounce, the steak I've had in my life, this has been by far, the best. The flavor is excellent and each morsel just melts in  your mouth.\n\nNext time I'm back, I'm definitely making it a point to visit again.

It is funny how everyone has their own interpretation of the salad, but this one was really delish!!! \n\n I originally wanted the filet mignon rossini since I heard a lot people raving about here on yelp.  Unfortunately,  I  was not very hungry so my friend and I ended up splitting the lobster/ filet mignon meal, which turned out to be the best idea ever.  I think it was very smart also because that plate of food was less then $50 for us each.  I would rather pay that price for both steak and lobster, rather than just for steak.  The portions were huge!!! I seriously don't know how just one person can finish that entire meal by themselves.\n\nThe first bite of the lobster was HEAVEN.   Everything was done beautifully.

The four of us normally go to a steakhouse to celebrate birthdays, and Harris' was next on the list. As usual, we all got medium rare, 2 porterhouses, 1 fillet mignon and 1 ribeye. The fillet mignon looked to be cooked perfectly as did one of the porterhouses. My ribeye on the other hand looked more like it was medium well than medium rare though, and my other friend's porterhouse looked kind of iffy too. I HATE complaining but very early on I decided to check with the waiter to see if he agreed that my steak looked too well done. He assured me that \"medium rare is supposed to look like that\". \"That\" was mainly brown with a bit of pink. Sufficiently embarrassed, I continued eating this leather like piece of meat. After another 10 minutes my other friend lost it and asked for the waiter to complain that his steak was too well done. The hilarious thing was, the waiter thought it looked too rare! WTF? I know it's dark but was he blind? Anyway, at least he took the 2 steaks back and got us 2 new ones which were cooked a bit more to our specifications.\n\n2) Of course, after realising his gargantuan cock-up, he assumed that we were pretty much a write-off for any kind of decent tip. He did nonchalantly hand out some dessert menus. We were actually going to order something but as he had disappeared, we didn't have the chance to order anything before we had to leave to go watch a movie (we had to ask the busboy for the check).\n\nPerhaps our experience is the exception to the rule, but to regard this as one of the best steakhouses in San Francisco is an embarrassment to the city. I'd much rather eat at Ruth's Chris or Bob's, and there's no comparison to steakhouses outside SF like Peter Luger's or Chicago Chop House.

The Prime Rib was probably the best I'd ever had. In fact all the food was great! We started off in the bar with a few drinks and appetizers and the atmosphere was great. The one thing thing that bothered me was our waiter. If I'm going to drop a car payment on dinner then I expect to be treated a little better. Our waiter wasn't particularly bad he just had this attitude that he was better than us and that because he was working at such a classy place he was entitled to being stuffy. It honestly pissed me off because we were there for our 1 year anniversary and I wanted everything to be perfect. If it wasn't for the waiter I would have given this place 5 stars hands down and the only reason that I'm giving 4 is because the food was good enough to make up for the arrogance of our waiter.

Any who, I decided to take my boyfriend here for his birthday based on all the hype on Yelp but to me the overall experience, I felt, was overrated. The ambiance was definitely an old school vibe which I liked because I was expecting/wanted a pretty traditional steakhouse because nowadays steakhouses seem to go on the adventurous side like using some some crazy sauces/ingredients that I can't stand i.e. Alexander's steakhouse. Sometimes I just like my steak to be steak you know? My boyfriend ordered the New York Steak which he said was excellent and I had the filet mignon. The filet tasted burnt and smokey and rather bland which definitely was not something I was expecting coming from a five star steakhouse. Even my boyfriend said my filet tasted a little off. Mreh I don't know, I wasn't really a fan of Harris so I'm not sure if I'd go back here again.", "author": "Megan D."}

They're supposed to be an award winning restaurant, known especially for their steaks. Though, the overall dining experience was excellent, my steak was far from par. I felt that for the price of the meal I had eaten, the cut of the meat wasn't that much better than steaks I've gotten from the grocery store. On top of that, I ordered my steak medium rare, and it came out almost medium well, such a waste of good meat.", "author": "Mace M."}

So at first I thought of Ruths Cris. Than I decided to Yelp and saw Harris had half a star more (4.5) to four for Ruths Cris or House of Prime Rib. So I decided to go there. I got the 49er New York........#%&*#@..... sorry I was just going back savoring how good it was. It was one of the best I have ever had. Ok second. the best so far was a steak house in Vegas (forgot the name. It was in  Bellagio). I usually put A1 sause or steak sauce when I get steak from places like Cattlemans but this steak did not need anything. It was perfect the way it was.\nI was hungry but the ealiest reservation I could get was 8:45. But we decided to go there early around 8 just to see if there might be an open table. And wala there was. We got seated right away. With the steak, we ordered E. Guigal Gigondas red wine. mmm went perfectly with the steak. And I opted for sliced potaoes with the steak, (patting myself on the back) great choice. My friend got whole potatoe. That was also great. Waiter had a trey for the whole potatoe which had their special butter, sour cream, fresh chives and umm something else. And he slapped it on the potato (am I spelling \"potato\" right?). My 49er New York steak was $49 which is not too bad for an awesome steak. My friend got the Fillet Mignon Rossini that came with foie gras and balck truffle with cabernet sauce ($47) that was yummy also. But yea I ate half of hers also since I dont believe in wasting precious good eats. The place was typical upscale enviroment. i saw people in suits and also in casuals so they are not strict on the attire.", "author": "Mark M."}

The good:  great food in an old fashioned steakhouse setting with live jazz at the bar.  The bad:  no reservation on Wednesday night, thanks to the concierge...damn concierge.  We were told to wait for about 45 minutes at the bar.  I ordered vodka but was not asked for preference so was served Gordon's...yuk.  After waiting for an hour I went back to inquire about our table but there was nobody in that area so I stood there for about 10 minutes and was finally assisted by a waiter who said that he would check, then a manager asked if I was being helped so I pointed to the waiter and said yes to which she replied, \"are you his friend?\".   I told her that he's checking on my table because I've been waiting a very long time and saw that there were at least 7 open tables to which she replied with an apology and said that we would be seated immediately and we were.  However, unfortunately we were seated in the stupid waiter section. This guy was just plain dumb so I didn't take it personal.  I watched as he delivered the same stupid service to other tables.  The BV Georges latour reserve helped numb the nausea of bad service.  Speaking of wine, They have a great wine list, chateau la tour and a large selction of diamond creek if you want to spend a bit more.  The service was bad, from not refilling drinks to attempting to make us keep our appetizer forks for the entree to the puzzled look he gave me after i asked if i could switch from fries to a baked potato before my entree arrived, this guy needs to do something else for a living.  Onto the food, great steak cooked to perfection.  Fries were ok and guess what?  I also got a baked potato, seems that the steakhouse kitchen was able to accommodate my request after all, who knew?  Friend's steak was overcooked so they brought another one out that was actually cooked as ordered (medium rare) but instead of cooking another order of his fries, they refried them making them extra hot and greasy.  I didn't bother for coffee or dessert but just wanted to leave.  I would recommend this place because the food is really good and I hope that your service is outstanding as it should be when you go to a good steakhouse.", "author": "James R."}

Never asked how our drinks were, forgot a side dish and screwed up my order (and didn't apologize) and after serving our main courses, she didn't ask us how everything was until 20 min later!  When we said 'no thanks' to dessert, she said, \"not one of you is getting dessert?\" obviously showing she was pissed off we weren't raising the bill to her liking in order to increase her tip.  She was just so unnatentive that we didn't get the bill until 30 min AFTER we said no to dessert and our plates were cleared.  wtf?!

We were 15 minutes early for our reservation so we had expected to have a drink in the bar before we were sat.  Yet we were pleasnetly surprised to find our table was set and ready to go.  The host was gracious and very professional.  He showed us to our own booth which provided for a private yet roomy atmosphere.  The restaurant itself is dimly lit with beauitful woodwork and a very romantic feel yet not stuffy or super formal.  We were welcomed by both the waitress and her assistent with waters and complimentry bread.  She gave us adequate time to peruse the the menus and we were able to order cocktails, appetizers and a bottle of wine (to let it breathe) before selecting our entree's.  I know this is typical practice, but sometimes, it goes awry in even the best of restaurants.  I ordered the steak tartar which was made with capers and chives and it was THE BEST I'VE EVER had!  My husband who is not a huge fan of steak tartar tried a bite we ended up fork battling for the last bite!  He also orderd the wedge salad and it was huge with a chef made salad dressing.  Very delicious!  I ended up ordering the petite filet and whole lobster (hey, it was my birthday) they both were amazing!  I am a VERY picky person with my filet. I order my steak \"blue\" meaning, I like it so rare, it's cool in the middle.  It was cooked to perfetion and bloody as ever!  My husband ordered the pepper steak and ate the WHOLE thing. The sides include a baked potato with all the fixings and fresh mixed veggies.  I'm not a huge potato fan so I asked if I could substitute the startch with extra veggies which was no problem.  They consisted of crisp carrots and baby snap peas! Wonderful! I loved that it wasn't some soggy mix of over cooked spinach or broccolini.  The SilverOak was incredible (no surprise there) and compliemented the meal exceptionally well,  The lobser was HUGE and definitely was picked at until we could eat no more.

This place  was really fancy, not a place I would usually go just for dinner but for a special occasion. The people who dine here are a lot older; I was probably the youngest person here and that's also including the waiter. So I just felt a tad bit out of place because everyone seem to stare but that was ok..lol I ordered the Fillet Mignon with grilled Sonoma foie gras and black truffle Cabernet sauce on top..and also with a side of scalloped potatoes. I have to say it was one of the best steaks I've ever had!!!!!!! The foie gras just melted in my mouth and the sauce just went perfectly with the steak. The portion was just right and the scalloped potatoes were so delicious. I don't know how they made it but I think there was some sort of cheese melted in it. I'll probably come back here again for special occasion... it is a little pricey but WORTH IT. \n\nO yeah even when you don't think you have any room for dessert think again!

It's not extensive, but it's substantial.  \nI married into a Korean family and we bonded over purses.  Especially the women. From the real deal to  the forbidden thrill of a well-crafted knock-off at a fake Prada party in a tiny Inchon apartment. \nI don't get out of the house very often these days.  And I have even fewer occasions to carry a designer handbag.  \nHarris' is definitely the kind of place you can sport a fancy purse. Nearly everyone dresses up.  Most of the patrons are over 50.  Surprisingly, unlike HOPR, the demographic is even more Caucasion than my home turf of Upper Noe.  \nLuckily, my dining companion was Korean.  So I got to bring one of my purses out of hiding.  And kick it like a fancy lady.  Fancy white Korean lady.  \nI ordered a Special Martini.  It was foul - way too strong, and the only bad thing I ordered all evening.  \nEverything else was decadent and superb: 1/2 dozen oysters on the half-shell, iceburg wedge w/ goatcheese/ranch/green garlic dressing, filet mignon w/ foie gras (medium rare), 1/2 bottle of blackbird merlot, and chocolate cake for dessert. \nMy dining companion had the porterhouse.  We switched 1/ 2 way through, because the filet mignon was way to intense for me, and my friend had been craving foie gras for nearly a week.\nMy friend wanted to take his leftover 1/2 eaten porterhouse home to his dog.

I say she's allergic to lobster (congestion, gets tired, throat closes) she says it's always another factor other than the lobster that happens to be served everytime. The deal is we have a meal fit for kings and if she has any symptoms this is her last lobster.\r\n\r\nWe order everything. Nothing is off limits. We're not even looking at the prices since i believe this is her last lobster dinner. Crab cakes. Salads. Steaks (Petite NY for her, Filet for me). Two bottles of wine (Chateau St. Jean Durrell Pinot for her, Cinque Cepages for me). Dessert. And the lobster. A 2 1/4 lbs. lobster.  \r\n\r\nComplaint #1- with the kind of scratch you throw down for entry you'd expect the lobster to be cracked for you. Nuh uh. \r\n\r\nComplaint #2 It is commonly known (certainly amongst the higher end restaurants) that a lobster can take on a certain aroma if not opened. The steam coupled with the shell can sometimes give off a wet sock odor. Lorenzo, my lobster, fit in that category. \r\n\r\nComplaint #3- They drop this big red bastard on a massive Genghis Khan-sized plate next to my potatoes, vegetables and my filet. The intermingling of juices flowing like a river from the lobster and vegetables seep down into the my highly coveted filet juices. My filet (which i cant fairly assess) was soaked from said juices and took on the flavor of a cow and lobster love-child that was a strict asapagus eating vegetarian. Not cool.\r\n\r\nBut I look over at my beautiful wife and she is in carnivore heaven. Everything is to her liking from her non-lobster infultrated steak to the hunks of lobster i yank out of Lorenzo's exoskeleton and drop on her plate. Her face makes the whole experience worth it.\r\n\r\nThe dessert comes and it is amazing. A rich chocolate cake topped with fudge and a vanilla bean ice cream. Now, im not a big dessert guy, but this was one of the better ones ive had.\r\n\r\nAll in all the evening was great. The wine fantastic. The crab cakes superb. The lobster smelly but supple. The steak soaked. The dessert memorable. The check, not as bad as I expected. The waiter, a snob without cause.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, my wife is allergic to lobster, although she wont admit it.

We had been there once before, but not for a few years. We had an 8pm reservation, and once we arrived, we only had to wait for a few minutes while they set our table. \n\n~The complimentary crostini with the cheese spread was so yummy and a perfect starter to the meal. I was in the middle of a conversation with my dad, then I looked up and they were almost gone! Needless to say, my husband loved them! lol. Also, the french bread served with the meal was great! You get your own little roll so it is perfectly crusty on the outside, but soft and tastey on the inside!\n\n~Appetizers: we got the crabcakes and the foie gras. It came with two nice size crab cakes with a sauce on top and it tasted really fresh and delicious. The foie gras was really for my dad, I am a very picky eater and wouldn't normally touch the stuff. But somehow, my dad talked me into taking a bite. To my surprise, it was described perfectly by the reviews here... buttery, rich, and flavorful! \n\n~Entrees: My dad got the sweetbreads, which is normally an appetizer, but they made it into an entree for him and served it along with a loaded baked potato and vegetables. He was so pleased with his meal, and he is the type of person that would rather cook for himself and generally complains whenever he goes to restaurants. Again, he somehow talked me into taking a bite of something I would usually NEVER try. It wasn't bad. Not something I would want to get myself, but I am glad I tried it. It goes perfectly with the toasts they put it on. My husband got the lamb chops which came with 3 and was served with scalloped potatoes and vegetables. The lamb was very tender and juicy. I ordered the prime rib, which came cooked to perfection, medium rare , just how I ordered it. I rarely order prime rib out because my dad makes it the best I have ever had it, but they did not disappoint. And it was definately better than the prime rib I had last time at The House of Prime Rib (which seemed kind of bland that day). I got it with the sauteed button mushrooms which were pretty good and the scalloped potatoes which were creamy and cheesy and delightful! All in all, the food was fantastic!\n\nI am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 based on the service. The last time I went, the service was wonderful. But this time, it fell short of my expectations. I managed to drink all of my water, and still had to wait before they came by to refill my glass. We looked to talk to our waiter a couple of times, but he was no where in sight. Also, we all hoped to share a dessert, and with 25 minutes left before our ride was to show up, we figured there was time. But it took 15 minutes before we were able to get our waiter to bring us the dessert menu, and then he disappeared again. He came back 5 minutes later, but by this time, we figured we didn't have time, so we passed on the dessert. Bummer!", "author": "Stephanie K."}

As I walked into Harris', I was presently surprised to find traditional steakhouse decor- simple, understated, yet elegant at the same time.  You can tell right off the bat that this is a power-dinner kind of place.  \n\nI sat down at the bar with my lovely date, and we ordered a few drinks as we were early for our reservation.  My gin and tonic was on point, and the service was quirky and friendly.  The bartender was definitely an interesting fellow.  Once our table was ready, I got ready to pay my bar tab before being led to our table, and our server told me that she would just transfer my tab to our bill.  Brilliant!  I like this place already.\n\nOnce we were seated, I felt we had an exceptionally knowledgeable server.  Having been in sales for many, many years, I appreciated the way that she indirectly upsold me without being pushy whatsoever.  I had the crab cakes to start, which were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Then I had a chop salad with a house garlic-ranch dressing, which was outstanding.  For an entree, I opted to go with the giant Porterhouse rather than the Kobe.  Though I was feeling sassy, I wasn't feeling sassy enough to dump $170 on a steak.  However, I imagine it must be absolutely magnificent.  Maybe one day.  Anyway, the Porterhouse was perfect- I believe a great steak should stand on its own without sauces or strange seasoning.  Harris' definitely did not disappoint.  The steak was cooked to a proper medium-rare temperature, and they weren't afraid to send it to me a little bloody.  \n\nEverything here was outstanding, as it should be for the price.

Not that Harris' wasn't good or anything...but it just didn't stand out from the other steakhouses that I've been to. \n\nThe place was really nice and elegant and the service was good but not outstanding. There is a meat display window on one side of the restaurant but the meat actually looked really old and nasty.\n\nShortly after we were seated they brought us these bread crackers with a really delicious spread. I'd like to say that it was some kind of cheese spread. Yummmm...I could probably munch on that stuff all day. For our entrees I ordered the fillet mignon with the potatoes au gratin. Now I usually get the petite fillet as I'm not really a big meat eater but I opted for the regular cut because the hubs ordered the petite fillet with the whole lobster and I thought that he'd probably want more meat.  It ended up being a pretty big portion (to me at least) and I probably only ate a little more than half of it. The rest went on the hubby's plate. The hubby was loving his lobster which didn't really seem like a whole lobster because he chose to have it served to him out of the shell. I told him to get it with the shell just for presentation purposes because I saw a server carry a plate out for another table and it had the entire lobster on the plate (shell and all) and it looked huge!. Actually I think I really just wanted to take a picture of it so I could post on here and it looks better in the shell. He did offer me a bite up his lobster and it was yummy! He ate it all up and his petite fillet (plus my leftovers) and was pretty full. He did agree with me , however, that he preferred Ruth's Chris. We were too stuffed for dessert although there choices seemed delicious. The bill came to about $140 for both of our entrees. We didn't have any wine or cocktails and his plate alone cost $88!  Overall, it's a good place but I doubt I'll be going back any time soon.", "author": "BrElla4eva H."}

Instead the steak was filled w gaps of fat, ( not marbled within the meat mind u) and the flavor was a $30 steak at best. After talking about how excited I was to go to Harris' for a good steak, I was thoroughly disappointed. Other than that, wait time was good, and staff was professional.

Our server, Frederick, made us feel truly special and was helpful in inspiring us to choose certain menu items we might not have ventured to try. For example, the house Manhattan is a most exceptional cocktail. Harris' has their bourbon hand crafted and brandies their own cherries -- what a delight! Their knowledgeable and friendly bartender, Robert, will be happy to tell you  in detail exactly what makes their Manhattan so special.

Harris was well worth the splurge. I'm not a HUGE fan of steak, but damn this steak was good. Everybody had excellent cuts of steak; I had a rare \"petite\" filet mignon which was actually enough food for my dinner AND the next day's lunch. The $40 \"petite\" steak came with veggies and choice of potatoes--baked or au gratin. You would think that a $40-$50 steak SHOULD come with sides, but I don't take it for granted that some places (ahem Mortons) charge you extra for this, and really appreciated the sides. I got the baked potato which was good, but it was lacking in toppings, and by lacking, I mean it was lacking bacon and cheese. So that's the the minus one star there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-17", "description": "I am giving this business four stars because, well, they deserved it.  That doesn't mean that I wasn't disappointed.\n\nI am mostly disappointed that there is not a GREAT steak house in SF.  Bob's is good.  The steak and probably half the menu at Bobo's is fantastic, but the atmosphere, while quaint, falls short of the classic steakhouse.  After reading the Yelp reviews I was certain that Harris' was it.  After going, I now know that it is not.\n\nGoing to the Celtics game in Oakland with some Boston buddies and wanted to have a steak before hand.  One suggested Ruth's Chris or Morton's.  The others of us blanched at the overpriced, underwhelming chains, but we reluctantly agreed.  Don't get me wrong, I like these places, but not in a restaurant mecca like San Francisco.  After reading the mediocre Yelp reviews on both I just couldn't bring myself to do it (Oh, they have some good reviews, but not by anyone who has paid full price).  So I booked Harris'.\n\nSince we had to go early in order to make the game, we were the first ones there.  And seeing the place empty really gives you a flavor for the decor.  It's just old.  (I went in Dec before Ian R.'s review).  I thought it was going to be a high budget place, but really it looked no better than Alfred's.\n\nThe menu.  It's a little light as far as traditional steakhouse fare goes in terms of the apps and sides, but pretty standard stuff.  Lot's of good steak choices including Kobe beef.\n\nI realize that this term is overused and the beef really has nothing to do with Japanese Wagyu from the Kobe prefecture.  But they claimed to have real aged, marbled Wagyu both from the US and from Japan.  Hmmm.  After falling in love with the stuff in Japan I am desperate to find it here.  And unless your name is Jeffrey Chowdorow, you can't get it in the US.  He told me how he gets it and it might be too strong to assume that nobody else has it, but his place Kobe Club in NYC is the only place that I have ever had real Wagyu equivalent to Japan. \n\nSo I gave it a try and opted for the pricier Japanese Wagyu.  It's OK and I can see the resemblance, but it's not the same in my opinion.  It's very fatty in a good way, but the fat is not as creamy as it should be.  More greasy than creamy.  The $230 steak at Kobe Club is totally worth it.  The $160 steak at Harris' not so much.  Oh, and Harris' menu says \"thick cut\".  The cut was about 1/2\" thick, thin by any steak standards.  It was thin but very large, almost as if it had been pounded out.  So the steak was a downer and I considered a 3 star review because of it, but I didn't go there because I had more hoped than expected it would be 'real' Kobe and was willing to take a flyer.  Had I expected better and dropped the $160 for nothing, I would have been really pissed.  Heck, I may go back and change it at some point as I am torn between spending a lot for a disappointing dish and punishing them for a single dish for which I admit there is some subjectivity.\n\nThey also had a steak with foie gras and black truffles.  Had this at Mix in Las Vegas recently and it was one of the best dishes I have ever had.  May have to go back to Harris' to see if their version is in the ballpark.\n\nMy friend's liked their meals, but said they were not exceptional.  They each had a steak with a lobster tail and the lobster was actually pretty big, neither could finish.   I helped, and have to say the lobster was very good.  Was disappointed with the creamed spinach. The service was good, but I would expect it to be as we were the only ones in there that early.\n\nBTW - the line of the night came from our waiter.  I asked him the difference between the Japanese and American Wagyu on the menu.  He gave me the rote answer I was expecting, then said, \"the Japanese one has more fat content because Japan is more crowded so the cattle don't move as much\"  HA HA HA HA!  What, if the key to the right fat content was keeping the cattle from moving, nobody in America thought to erect a pen?\n\nWhy, in this great city, don't we have a great steak house?

Don't bother with parking 10.00 valet is worth it. One of my favorites.\n\nAtmosphere: Classic steakhouse. Very Classy with more appeal to the older crowd. Dim lighting with piano music was nice touch. Atmosphere really helped you forget you were on busy Van Ness. We're in our early 20's and were easily the youngest diners there. More of a family place than a friend's or date place.\n\nService: Server was nice. Nothing to complain about except he could have rounded on the table a bit more to fill up the drinks. Despite older crowd, the staff there didn't make us feel out of place. They also pushed back our reservation without issue when we called to say we were going to be late. Thanks!\n\nFood: EXCELLENT FOOD. Fillet Mignon Rossini was one of the best fillet dishes we have had and felt right on par with the Kobe Fillet we had at Forbes Mill in Los Gatos. The Rossini had BEAUTIFUL presentation which was only outdone but the quality of the food. Meat was some of the most tender i have had and was cooked perfectly to order. Cabernet Sauce was excellent and memorable and the Foie Gras on the top was a nice and flavorful touch. 9/10 on this dish. Bone-in ribeye was excellent as well. Tender and juicy with the melt in your mouth sensation you look for in great steak. I'll give the ribeye an 8.5/10 just cuz it was a little overcooked for medium rare.\n\nThis is a great place. I'm currently torn between Harris and Forbes Mill as my favorite steakhouse. Steak quality was a 9/10 only slightly below Forbes Mill. It was nice that Harris included sides with the dishes. I'm really excited to go back. Be prepared to spend 50.00 per head but it's worth it.", "author": "Darrell T."}

Our reservation wasn't until 8:30, but we got there a little bit early. The hostess told us we would have to wait a bit so we went to the bar to grab a drink. The d\u00e9cor of the place reminded me of the 1920s era which I love! Compared to other steak restaurants we have been to, this one was much more classier. We finally got our table and ended up ordering our food. We started out with the Foie Gras. It was my first time trying it, but OMG it was SOGOOD. For entrees, my bf got the Filet Mignon and I ordered the Steak Dianne. Our server later informed me that the sauce on the Steak Dianne had cream in it, so he was able to substitute it with the sauce that was on the Foie Gras. How convenient! Our food came out in perfect timing, along with some glasses of wine we ordered, equaling a complete meal. When we were finished, we were looking at the dessert menu and they had sorbet! Overall, our experience at Harris' was a very pleasant one. Our server was amazing for accommodating with my food allergies and taking the time to just be real. Thank you, Harris', for helping to make my Valentine's Day this year a memorable one :)", "author": "Marissa C."}

I wasn't the most excited because I'm not exactly the best judge of steak. But I have to say, my Harris' experience has me yearning to come back for more. We sat in one of their closed off rooms with a \"library\" and a romantic fireplace. Like I said, I'm not the best judge of steak...but I can tell you that I really liked it and my dining partner loved it as well. We also ordered the sauteed mushrooms which were the BEST I had ever had. We've been to our share of steak/prime rib houses and these mushrooms have set the bar. The only glitch of the evening came when I found a teeny bug on my plate in the little cup of sauce. How could I possibly give a restaurant 5 stars when I found teeny bug?? As soon as I told our waiter, he was shocked but quickly took the plate back to check for himself and came back out to say that he did indeed find the bug I was talking about. He repeatedly apologized and told us that in the 20+ years he had been a server at Harris', he had never seen a bug on a plate before.\n\nWe move on from this glitch because our server seemed so apologetic and went on to dessert. When he delivered our dessert, he apologized once again and informed us that the dessert would be on the house. I was overjoyed because hey, who doesn't like free stuff?! The Banana Baked Alaska was absolutely delicious and I would have been perfectly fine paying for it!! \n\nTo top off the evening, Harris' has live piano and vocal jazz that just makes your dining experience superb. The music was wonderful and we sat there for an extra 15 minutes just enjoying the music. \n\nSave on parking: Harris' offers Valet parking, but being the cheap-o that I am, I refuse to do Valet unless I cannot find parking. We found parking a couple of blocks away and since it was at night, we did not have to pay the meter. There is plenty metered parking around Harris' so I would suggest circling once around the block to see if there's parking.", "author": "Diana K."}

He wanted steak, so I asked around and one of my cousins told me this place is one of the best steak restaurants around. I made reservations the morning of and got the time we wanted right away. All the people there were really courteous. The decor was interesting. A little more western for me, but still nice looking. \n\nWe started off the evening with a 10 year old Brandy. My husband was in love with this particular Brandy. For the first course, we had the steak tartare. It was good, but could be better. The portion was good though. Then we had the soup of the day. Don't recall what it is called, but it was delicious! For the main entree, my husband had the ribeye steak with scalloped potatoes. I had the Filet mignon Rossini, which was accompanied with grilled Sonoma foie gras and black truffle, cabernet sauce. Both dishes were super tender and very tasty. The Filet mignon was one of the best I have ever tasted. Most other places over cook it, but they made it perfect. I always order medium-rare. The sauce went perfectly with the filet. Also, the scalloped potatoes were delicious. If you ever tasted the scalloped potatoes at Ruth's Chris, you would want to taste this since it is way better. As for the dessert, we had a seasonal crisp a la mode. That was not very good, but since the rest of the dinner was pretty good, I will let that go. \n\nOverall a pretty good dinner.

On the rare occasion that I'm fixing for a prime rib, I'd go down the street to the House of Prime Rib, but I've heard from an industry insider that they think that the best prime rib available anywhere in SF is also at Harris.\n\nUnless you're independently wealthy and can eat red meat like that everyday, Harris is definitely not an everyday sort of place.

The service is decent as it would be in all upscale restaurants where you're paying an arm and a leg for a meal.\n\nI got the New York medium while the girlfriend had the filet mignon medium.  We both liked our steaks.  We also got some extras.  We didn't need the carmelized onions that I spent an extra $5 on, but the creamed spinach was really good.\n\nFor the ambiance and the price, I'd say it was a fair deal for what you were getting.  In fact, the only place that separates this as a 5-starrer from Ruth's Chris (up the street) as a 4-starrer is the price tag at Ruth's Chris (and the fact that you pay extra for sides to the slightly higher priced steaks at Ruth's Chris).", "author": "Anx R."}

I prefer this to House of Prime Rib for steak dishes (but not prime rib). As with any five star rating I give I can't think of anything notable to criticize. Some don't care for the interior decor but I think the timeless interior decor with big oversized leather booths dark lighting is a perfect setting for their steak and prime rib fare.

Well, after 20 something years of wondering, we've finally come to dine at this marvelous classic steakhouse. This is indeed the best restaurant for steaks. \nWe came here on a Friday night during the holiday season and made reservation several weeks in advance. As far as parking goes, we just did the $10 valet as parking can be challenging and we were running late on our reservation. \nWe were promptly seated in a cozy booth for two. The restaurant was majestically decorated with Christmas lights. A very appetizing plate Bread crackers with cheesy dip was brought to our table. Our friendly and efficient yet well-paced waiter shortly arrived at our table and explained the different cuts of meat and how they're prepared. \nTo start off , I ordered the Smoked Trout salad which was delicious. The greens were fresh and locally grown. It had just the right amount of vinaigrette dressing and the fish tasted freshly smoked. For my main entree, I ordered the Steak Diane which was recommended by our waiter as well as the friendly table next to us. The steak Diane is all-time classic and is recommended for 'first-time diners' who couldn't decide on what to order. I like my steak medium to medium-rare and it came out perfect. The steak is served with the demi glace of cognac and shallots sauce which is an excellent complement. \nMy hubby started off with the clam bisque. It was nicely done with fresh sandless clams in the creamy but not too rich broth. For dinner he ordered the grilled Porterhouse steak which is a huge T-bone cut that includes NY strip and the fillet mignon. To my surprise, he finished the whole steak. \nTo top off our delightful dinner, we ordered the apple cobbler a la mode. The ice cream was freshly made they combined tart apples with sweet apples . \nThe service was excellent, our glasses were constantly filled, warm breads were being brought to our table. We felt so pampered and had such good experience that I took my dad here for his birthday two weeks later.", "author": "Nancy M."}

My comments on Harris':\n- Come for the steak. On my last trip there a few weeks ago the waiter suggested a bone in Filet. What? I know, I'd never heard of one either. It is the end of the filet that apparently has a bone on it. I ordered it medium, of course it came out perfectly. I ordered it Au Poivre (peppercorn) with a side of Demi Glace sauce. Food ogasm. All the way.\n- Sides that come with the steak are very good. I remember the Potatoes Au Gratin were amazing.\n- I thought the salad (wedge) was ok but could have been better. Usually great steak houses have big bold salads, this one seemed kind of wimpy.\n- Wine list was good. Prices seemed reasonable.

I hadn't eaten meat for over 6 weeks (Lent) and this was going to be a \"welcome back to carnivore life\" dinner. For the most part they delivered. \n\nMy girlfriend is vegetarian so they made an off menu veggie platter for her that looked really good - basically every side they normally make thrown together: broccoli, asparagus, potato, pea pods, mushrooms, spinach, baked tomato, and I'm probably forgetting something else. I had the petite NY steak which was good and at 11 oz, not all that petite! Unfortunately, it was overdone, I had asked for it medium, my first bite was closer to medium-well so I didn't say anything. I should have realized that a hot piece of meat will keep cooking so by the end, it was more like a well done steak. My own fault for not commenting to the waitress although given how long it had been since I had a steak, I wasn't really thinking. Despite that, the meat was flavorful and tender. Really good... Scalloped potatoes were great, definitely get that over the baked potato if you get the choice.\n\nWe finished off with a baked Alaska that we shared which was pretty good. My one nit is that the wine list was overly pricey - there were definitely some good wines on there but the ones in the less than $75 range seemed to be over priced relative to the quality. The waitress recommended a wine and wanted us to say it was fantastic for the price, which we wouldn't say - it was good, but not amazing.

From the perspective of atmosphere, this is a top notch place, it looks like a steakhouse should: darkish, big brass chandeliers in the main dining room, with separate small rooms for dining off of the bar area.  \nI will say that the Wagyu ($75) was absolutely special, and the fillet with foie gras and truffle sauce was tasty, but how could it not be? (both ordered by others in the party). Nevertheless, I was disappointed with my steak, a petit NY, cooked accurately to medium rare, but tougher that I think it should have been.\nReally the biggest point of contention for me was the lack of the traditional list of sides.  Instead of several side options to put with your steak (usually three different kinds of potatoes, cream spinach, veggie medley, etc.), they force you into one of two potato styles, and veggies.  It was in essence a hybrid of a typical restaurant menu item and a typical steakhouse menu item.  I didn't like that.  \nSo, I have now been to four of the five big steakhouses in the City (Bob's, Acme, Harris' and Alfred's, have yet to go to Mortons and Ruth's Chirs doesn't count as it is a chain, and leaving aside Izzy's) and on ambiance, Harris is tops, but not on steaks and sides.

We had tried Morton's..been to Ruth's Chris..been to Palomino's for steak and of course..have gone to House of Prime Rib.   The last place I had not tried was Harris'\n\nWent here on a Monday.  It was STILL PACKED.   I think a lot of businesses have dinners at places like this.   I saw a bus of business people having an \"event\".\n\nI noticed you get better service if dressed in a suit and I put that idea into practice each time I go eat steak.   I showed up to Mortons' in a armani suit and ruth's chris in a brioni.   Hugo Boss w/blue pinstripes was the suit of choice for Harris'\n\nWe were immediately seated and right next to their very humour house guitar player.  He was playing the theme song to Gilligan's island and other fun 80s TV shows...that guy is a HOOT!\n\nWe were here to try the Kobe Wagyu beef ribeye.  Okay this is NOT the Kobe from japan.  You can't get that unless IN Japan.   This is just the US version.  They have the same genetic strain of cow..WAGYU and it has the same marbling but isn't massaged and fed beer like Japan.\n\nStill..it's a good piece of steak and we had to try it out.\n\nONly a month back..we had tried Morton's steakhouse's harris ranch cornfed Ribeeye.  That one was seared crispy and was juicy on the inside.  The searing really made it work.\n\nThe Kobe style ribeeye at Harriss' came out not as crispy.  Although I remember that you can request that..which I should have.  But what made up for it was the tenderness of the beef.  It was considerably more tender than the one at Mortons.   I think if we requested the seared outer crust..it would've been the best steak I've ever had.\n\nIn addition, we ordered a pepper crusted NY strip.  That's usually my favorite cut of beef..but the ribeye's have been winning me over.\n\nWe finished the meal's off w/some champagne. Very nice finish for a birthday occasion. \n\nThe crowd is definitely corporate, and obviously snooty...but we didn't care.  We got ours! \n\nI'd come back here and request the sear.  That will make it an incredible steak.\n\nThe other shocking thing...the price of the kobe wagyu steak is the SAME price as a regular steak at Ruth's Chris.

This time however was a disaster.  Our waitress seemed annoyed that we asked her to decant the $300, 20-year old Bordeaux we brought.  After uncorking it, she literally turned it upside down and glug-glug-glug dumped it into a decanter.  So much for keeping sediment out of the decanter.  She called it a \"splash decant.\"  Maybe that's good for a 2010 cabernet that needs significant aeration - but it ruined a prized and well aged Bordeaux.  She poured it into the cheap, standard glasses they set the table with, instead of providing the high quality glasses they have.  We complained to the manager, and they gave us a new waiter and tried to make the best of it, but the damage was done.  It kind of ruined the rest of the meal to boot, which was good but not great to begin with.  I viewed this as an aberration, and wrote a long letter to the restaurant afterwards rather than immediately post an online review.  But they never responded.  So maybe it wasn't such an aberration.

I have been to multiple places that people claim to be the best and this one has continually delivered. I have had the pleasure of having the filet, prime rib, new york, buffalo, rib eye, and the porterhouse. Of all the Porterhouse has been my favorite I always order the steak prepared blue and this is the only restaurant that I have ever attended that will cook the steak correctly. Only once have they ever slightly over cooked it, and replaced the steak immediately.\n\nI highly recommend the steak tartar, and their Eagle Rare Manhattan.", "author": "Dave W."}

Our meat was prepared precisely to order and was very flavorful. While it's pricy and much more a dressy steak-joint than a hip foodie treat, the food was extremely well-prepared. The shrimp cocktail was fresh and delicious. The pumpkin cheese-cake was extraordinary. Even the side-vegetables were exactly right - crisp snap peas for example. The service is flawless in timing.

More intimate and secluded from the main dining area, quieter. \n\nWhile everything on the menu is equisite, I suggest...\n\nCaesar Salad. Heavy...This can be split with your date/wife/etc..Crunchy, cold and crisp with lobs of creamy caesar sauce..\n\nMain Course - Get the PorterHouse. You'll never had a hunk of meat so tasty, dry aged, juicy with the fat well proportioned and marbled intra meat.  The filet side melts in your mouth. You dont need a steakkniife, a butter knife is all you need for this half of the steak. Opt for it cooked Medium Minus or Medium Rare. Dont go any higher or it will ruin the steak. Sides usually come with a garlic mash or other pototatoe, veggies. \n\nIf you have a dog, package that bone..you're dog will absolutely love the bone.... \n\nDessert - All are great options.

I had to change the reservations a couple of days before the date to a later time and that was no problem at all. When we got there, we didn't even bother with parking since it's SF and we were both really hungry. The valet was like $10 from what I remember but it was totally worth it especially because it was a Friday night. We were seated right away in the library room which was really cool. There were only four tables in the four corners of the room so there was plenty of space which I appreciated. In the main eating area outside, they had someone playing the piano which was really cool too.\n\nI had expected the service to be really good but their service exceeded my expectations. You can tell when the servers are actually well experienced and their actual career is in the restaurant industry as opposed to a young, college student just waiting tables to have some extra cash. Besides from our waiter, they had two people waiting outside of the doors just waiting to either fill your water or clear your table or what not (I was pretty entertained by this but my boyfriend said it was pretty typical of nicer restaurants.)\n\nEarlier in the day, I had mentioned to my boss that I was going up to Harris' for dinner and he had mentioned something to me about how it was kind of \"old-school\" and how the crowd will tend to be mostly businessmen and older people. He's usually really good with recommendations about that kind of stuff so I was iffy about eating there. Upon my arrival, I did notice that crowd was exactly how it was described but it wasn't bothersome at all. it was a very comfortable environment.\n\nAnyways, the food that we had was amazing which completed the experience for us and really made me not feel bad about spending boyfriend's money like this. We started off with oysters which came with three yummy sauces. They were very healthy sized oysters and they tasted really fresh since I hear the older something from the sea is, the more it tastes and smells like the sea. For our entree, boyfriend  had the porterhouse. He ordered it medium rare but the filet mignon was more on the medium side and the new york was medium rare. It was a huge chunk of meat but somehow he managed to eat it all. Me on the other hand, I'm more of a filet mignon kinda girl so I ordered the  steak rossini which has a really good sauce. My boyfriend kept on stealing my sauce and so together we pretty much cleaned the whole plate. The vegetables were really delicious. Afterwards, we were so full but managed to have enough room for desert which topped off the whole dining experience.\n\nSomething that surprised me was how potent their martinis were. My boyfriend kept on trying to tell me that martinis are supposed to have a super strong vodka taste and that they were only supposed to have a slight flavor to them. It definitely wasn't what I was expected but I guess I was getting more for the price. Something that was also really cool was that the martini glass is kind of small so they serve the drink to you in this glass sake shaped bottle that you keep cooled in small wooden bucket/bowl thing and you pour the martini for yourself and it's kept cold.\n\nI really loved this place and I would definitely go back.", "author": "Helen L."}

I have to say that when i eat out at a steakhouse now, i seem to find myself comparing it to Harris'. I have grown to fall in love with everything about Harris'. The steaks are perfectly dry aged and marbled beautifully with fat. My favorite cut is the rib eye (medium rare of course) and Harris' consistently serves in my opinion the best steak. I love their American Kobe Ribeye, it is extremely tender and is deep in flavor. Although their booths for two people are kind of small (try to request one of their bigger booths) the food more than makes up for it. It is a nice place to have a drink as well with a live jazz ensemble playing in the bar area.

It has that old San Francisco feel.  It probably hasn't changed since they filmed The Streets of San Francisco. Drinks - All of the old classic cocktails - Negroni on the rocks was my choice, and it was tasty. Food- The bread came with butter and with a pimento cheese type spread.  I got seconds on the cheese.  Like all steak houses they had steaks and they were expensive.  I am sure they are great quality and this is the reason for the price.  The greatest disappointment of the night was the filet mignon with foie gras on top.  Sounds unbelievable, I know.  I have never had the two together, foie usually with some sort of berries and toast.  I never knew the reason why, now I do.  The flavor of the steak was way too overpowering and the two did not compliment each other at all.  Separate  the two were ok.  If you can't live without cheese spread, then go here.

Having said that, I ordered the prime rib which was tasty, though not the best I've ever had. But seeing how it's $37 and I ate less than 1/3 of it, I wanted to take the rest home. I also wanted to take the bread since the spread it comes with was soooooo good. Now this is where Harris looses its stars. I ALWAYS ask for the to go box and ALWAYS pack my food myself. I'm a pretty anal when it comes to that - I like things compartmentalized and grouped. I know that the kitchen is busy and usually they just slide the whole plate into a box, no big deal. That's why I don't mind doing it myself. I prefer to do it myself... \n\nSo when I asked for the boxes, the server was very polite and insisted that he take my plate back and it would be packed for me. I was uncomfortable, but hey, our server had been very great all night and it's a high end restaurant. It'll be fine (I was trying to control my OCD tendencies). .... But it wasn't fine. When the package came back there was only 1 box. Hmmmm ... He must have forgot the bread and threw it out. No big deal, didn't need it anyways. When I opened it the next day I saw that the bread had been packed on TOP of my steak!! The box was probably about 6\"x8\" and I barely ate my meal - there was NO room for the bread. Not to mention it soaked up all the juices from the meat!! I couldn't believe it. My meal was squashed so bad there was an indent in the middle of the prime rib from the soggy, compressed, bread - which by then had turned a reddish/pinky tinged brownish color from sucking up all the au jus. My $37 prime rib was totally dry. \n\nI was stunned - I'm still stunned. It just doesn't make any sense. Why would he do that? It doesn't even have anything to do with training or experience, ... it's just common sense. Why would anyone squish, into a tiny box, half a fresh baguette onto an almost full order of prime rib? ... I know what you may be thinking: we weren't bad customers. We were not rude, impatient or picky. I've worked in restaurants before and I know what a bad customer is. ... Needless to say, I'll never let anyone pack my food again... And I will not be go back to Harris.  Instead, I'll head across the street to Ruth Chris...", "author": "kiki s."}

Our sides were good, but like an other reviewer mentioned it's all a lot of food so I would recommend opting for the vegetables.\n\nThe staff on the other hand was great, very attentive.\n\nOverall, it's not worth the price we paid, at least the steak isn't.", "author": "Elsa H."}

It was a Monday night so the place was not very busy.  Plus side on this is I believe it allowed our server to be very attentive which she was (cute Asian lady :).  Downside, the food was ehh.  I now have a frame of reference because I just ate at a restaurant here in NY that specializes in steaks and the food was fantastic.  I thought I'd get the foie gras before California made it unavailable.  Liked the creaminess but It was bland.  I also ordered the sweetbreads and I also thought a bit on the bland side.  I was looking forward to the porterhouse but unfortunately it was a little overcooked (asked for medium-rare) but on top of that, not very juicy.   Furthermore, shouldn't a good/great steak have a little bit of a crust  or crispiness on the outside and total juiciness on the inside?  Unfortunately, my steak had neither.  I will leave off by saying excellent wine!  Great suggestion by our server!", "author": "FRED I."}

Ordered two glasses of champagne and some oysters. Oysters were kumamotos - so delicious, as always. Followed the oysters with some fried mushrooms and caesar salad to share. The salad was great. The mushrooms were good, but i'd recommend trying something different. For dinner we split the porterhouse. They charge a $5 split fee, but it does not come across as excessive as they basically give you two giant helpings of potatoes and veggies on your plates. The porterhouse was more than enough food for the two of us. We ordered a bottle of Husch red (pinot maybe?). It was $40 and a fantastic pick. Our server was great.

Trust me when I say that, together, we can be quite the raucous group.  We enter the house of meat ready to wine, dine and spend a pile of cash.  We were lucky to be placed in the care of Lucy aka the most professional, interesting and entertaining server of all time who not only matched us wit for wit and laughed at all of our jokes but also knew her product like a monk knows the bible, went above and beyond to help us select a fantastic wine at a reasonable price and spoke fluent Midwesterner despite being an SF native.   Having settled in our giant comfy booth we check out the menu.  It's a fancy steakhouse menu of which we sample the crab cakes, oysters, iceberg salad and crab bisque.  The table is completely silent except for the occasional mmmmmmm.  Lucy sends over the sommelier to help us with the wine.  He pours, we taste - it's perfect.  Ok folks, here comes the main event - STEAKS!   First bite - oh my god - second bite - I never knew it could be this way - third bite - I can't believe I was ever a vegetarian ...  on the fourth bite I slip into a nirvana like state that I can only describe as somewhere between a coma and an orgasm.  We finish up with some dessert drinks and chocolate cake.  Then we go to the movies.  . .

However, there was something just missing to it... it didn't had the WOW factor. \nMy friend got the onion soup, which is not the regular french soup, i.e. no gratin nor bread on top, however, the flavor is soooo good! Just a tiny touch of spiciness, not sweet at all, good portion and enough onion. \nEntree, I had the pepper steak with the sauce on the side, and instead of the New York I ordered a Rib eye... this was amazing. \nThe pepper crust just gives the steak the perfect flavor. The steak was soft with just the right amount of marble (fat)... perfectly cooked (order it medium rare) and the quality of the steak itself is outstanding. \nWe avoided dessert (since already too much food), but they bragged that the creme brule is the best in SFO. \n\nSecond time I had the cured house salmon... Its good. \nOn the entree I had the Rossini... WOW!!!! I was a skeptic about the match of the flavors and I thought you were just waisting both, a nice foie gras and a great fillet mignon.... I was sooo wrong, this is just so beautiful!!! The foie gras complements the delicious buttery fillet mignon, and the sauce.... oooooh it just adds sooo much to the flavor, is unbelievable. \n\nBoth times I had the classic martini. It is so great. At first I had ordered the King martini, it comes with a bit flavor of orange which I really didnt like it so I send it back. This brings me to my last point, the service.\nThe service is amazing! When I send my martini back they was not a question nor weird look, just plain good service \"Sure Sr. So you like the classic martini instead. I'll be right back\". Doesn't get better. \n\nFood 28.

Harris' truly exceeded all of my expectations and I think that they manage to transcend \"steak house\" and are a great special occasion destination.  The service was polished and friendly, the RIDICULOUSLY AFFORDABLE wine list has so many little treasures and the food was perfect right down to the crispy, bright green sugar snap peas. Working at a Mobil 5 star restaurant for several years has made me picky about service and Harris' nails it perfectly. The bartender made fantastic cocktails with crushed ice for our martini and even a sugar cube in my Champagne cocktail, as there ought to be. The lounge and live music create great ambiance and the service has such finesse (water always full, napkins replaced/ folded, guests given the right of way in the dining room etc.) that you're just able to relax and enjoy the food, which is just as finely tuned as the service.

The shrimp bisque and the wedge salad were excellent. My wife ordered the Prime Rib medium and that is exactly how it came out. She LOVED it! She said it was better than the House of Prime Rib and the best she'd had since Lawry's. I had to go with my favorite cut, the Rib Eye. The steak was prepared medium to perfection with a very slight char on the outside. Honestly, one of the best steaks I have ever had, and I have been to plenty of steakhouses, both chain and local! If you have the opportunity, you must try Harris'. You will not be disappointed.", "author": "Mr Z."}

You wont find one anymore authentic, these guys farm the beef themselves! If you have ever driven south on I-5 to LA from the Bay Area whether day or night, you either saw the Harris ranch and smelled Harris ranch or just smelled it! Wheres the beef? Right there! These guys know what they are doing and right from the moment you walk into the restaurant you know there will be no messing around, steak is for dinner! If your out for a nice steak dinner and you want the best, Harris' is it! If you want mediocre and easy on the wallet, take your business to Izzy's Steak House on Steiner, otherwise Harris' is what you are looking for. I have eatten at every other top tier steak house in San Francisco, and I havent found one to be close to Harris'. Harris' is the only steak house that produces time after time quality steaks cooked to perfection with an atmosphere that makes you feel like your somewhere special. God made beef perfect, do the right thing and make him proud, order your steak medium rare!", "author": "Michael G."}

Major plus considering it was Valentine's Day. Nice, open place. They give you bread w/butter and some kind of bagel like chips w/a cheese/wine spread which was good. We look over the menu and order a couple of appetizers: the fried mushrooms and crab cakes. For our entrees, I ordered the filet mignon medium rare (my absolute favorite cut of steak) while Jan ordered the ribeye medium rare as well. When the appetizers arrive, we dig in and boy were they tasty especially the crab cakes. When we finished our appetizers, I was anxiously waiting for my steak even though Jan was telling me to be patient and enjoy the ambience, but I can't help but seem like a fatty when I'm craving me some steak. Hahaha! So when we finally get our steaks ooohh did it look good and boy did it taste GOOD. Wow... super tender and juicy. LOVED my filet mignon! Jan liked his steak, but he didn't like that his cut had a little too much fat than he'd like. Great service and yummy food. Overall, we enjoyed this place. Definitely coming back here again sometime.", "author": "Jan And Daph S."}

All of us are in the food service industry and have worked in several different restaurants over the past few years in differend parts of that state. Service and food were nothing short of spectacular! We all agreed that it was some of the best steak and service that we have ever experienced. Every team member worked together to make sure every table had the most enjoyable dining experience possible. The menue is great and that wine list, amazing, ranging from $8 per glass to $3300 per bottle, lot's of veriety.  When i vist the city again for some special reason, i will make sure to stop by and dine at Harris', great place, location, atmosphere, and experience.", "author": "Zachary J."}

We sat at one of the four tables in a separate room off the main dining room (called the library); it was warm and cozy by the fireplace. It was almost like we were dining by ourselves with the chef cooking just for us.  The steak (filet and the Harris cut) was cooked to perfection, along with the vegetables, a fresh roll, and the baked potato.  The spinach salad was a perfect blend of salad and dressing with just enough dressing on the salad. The service was just what you would expect from a first-rate restaurant, attentive, but not intrusive. For dessert our waiter suggested the dark chocolate covered chocolate mousse with raspberry filling - perfect way to end the evening. We will definitely return!  Service was excellent, we never felt rushed, the food was of the highest quality, can't think of any way to improve our experience...thank you!", "author": "K W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-11-16", "description": "Simply the best.  I've dined at Harris at least a dozen over the past three years -- in the dining room for a special occasion, at a table in the lounge area with an impromptu group, and at the bar itself for a spontaneous meal -- and Harris always gets everything right on just about every front.  The service is professional and warm but generally understated and never overbearing.  The atmosphere is polished but comfortable -- exactly what you want when you want to go out for a high quality meal without a lot of drama or pomp and circumstance.  And the food, of course, is top notch.  There is no better steak in city, and the kitchen understands temperature perfectly -- my wife is a huge fan of 'medium minus' -- the perfect compromise between medium rare, which is often just a bit too red for her in the center, and the standard medium which at many restaurants often winds up over done.", "author": "Matthew B."}

We had a bit of a service \"blip\" after we sat down (we waited a little too long for the waiter to take our order), but after that the service was superb, really.  The wine list is amazing, with dozens of wines by the glass and hundreds of great bottles from about $30 up to the stratosphere ($1000+).  When I ordered a glass of wine, the server knew which one I was talking about without reference to the menu.  The caesar salad is very, very good, as are the scalloped potatoes.  I had a 49-er cut steak which was perfectly cooked and juicy.  The creme brulee for dessert is big enough to share, and I thought the coffee was fine.  A very satisfying meal and very nice ambience.  Most, but not all, people were dressed up in at least a nice shirt, and most of the men had jackets.  A quiet restaurant with connecting jazz bar. There was live jazz the night we were there.  Valet service was prompt and professional.  I would go back again if I had some big $$ to shell out (entrees run 30-70, most about $40-45.  Salad was about $8, wine starts at $6/glass)", "author": "Frank S."}

While the price may seem a bit steep, it's well worth the price.  As the old adage goes, \"you get what you pay for\".  What you pay for here at Harris' is a high quality savory dish accompanied by professional service.  The Filet Mignon (priced at $40) seems to melt in your mouth like butter.  The porterhouse is great bang for the buck also, as it is a large cut of meat certainly geared to satisfy the palate.  Enough about the steak.  Maybe it's sacreligious to praise something besides steak at a steakhouse, but there is a dessert dish here to die for.  Top off your dining experience by ordering a slice of the peanut butter pie.  After throwing down a porterhouse steak and a slice of pie, you're ready to just go home and kick your feet up.  After a meal like this you're ready to praise this restaurant for a job \"well done\".  Pun intended.", "author": "Rex J."}
