{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-10-22", "description": "Chisme is a good sized, modestly priced Mexican restaurant on Sutter between Leavenworth and Jones, which is a great choice if you are in the Nob Hill area where modest priced and tasty options are few and far between. The order at the counter concept and open seating means that it is a flexible place to get a quick bite.  The wide open door and chilly SF weather means that it might be a windy bite.  The tables are more geared for communal dining and largely with high top tables that are not very family friendly.\n\nThe staff is so friendly and inviting.  They have lots of knowledge about the menu and are very patient.  The tacos come two per order and are quite large.  I encourage anyone to bring  a friend and split a couple of orders so you can have more than one taste.  We had:\n\nChicken Taco ($11): two corn tortillas with shredded, spicy chipotle chicken, caramelized onion, some peanut mole and queso fresco.  I was not a fan of this taco, because it was not very flavorful.  Mole is a personal favorite of mine, and I could really only taste chipotle and felt like the mole was totally lost.  It was not a well balanced taco.\n\nMahi Mahi Taco ($12): this was a solid taco.  Two corn tortillas had a drizzle of creamy dressing (coconut ranch that tasted mostly of ranch) topped with sauteed spinach, grilled and heavily spiced mahi mahi, grilled pineapple salsa with habanero and some red onions.  The taco was tasty - good fish that was well cooked.\n\nJackfruit Taco ($9): THE BEST TACO ON THE MENU!!!  Two corn tortillas were loaded with fried jackfruit, a little spinach and lots of tangy and sweet red cabbage salad before being finished with a verdant and fresh mint verde.  So good and would return just to have this.\n\nPinchelotes ($8): traditional Mexican street corn that is halved and put on a stick for easy sharing between two.  A well prepared classic.\n\nChips and Guac ($9): a VERY generous portion of guac and the staff is willing to replenish the chips.  The guac is fresh and has the perfect balance of salt and lime.  A solid, traditional choice.\n\nDeath Via Ginger ($4 for hot as opposed to cold): absolutely the best thing that I had.  It is a hot ginger brew with mint and lime that is about the best hangover or make-you-feel-better regardless of what ails you drink.  I love, love, love this and would come just to get one.\n\nOverall, the tacos were a bit mixed for me.  The mahi mahi was classic but nothing special, the chicken was a miss and the jackfruit was out of this world.  I would come back and recommend, but I can't say it is the best ever.", "author": "Stephanie B."}

Today, I finally decided to try it out! Honestly so surprised how vegan tacos can taste so good. \n\nFirst, I ordered 2 eggplant tacos. I added guacamole for an extra dollar. The taco was honestly full of flavor! I didn't really have much complaints other than I wished the guacamole was evenly distributed lol I felt like it was just a big blob. The amount of guacamole was also a little too much.. but who am I to complain? More is better than less. I couldn't finish my two tacos because I was so full from eating their chips & salsa- which was also very delicious! I loved their red and green salsa. Their green salsa was so creamy and spicy. Additionally, my boyfriend ordered a mahi-mahi taco and he liked it as well. Also, we ordered coconut horchata and they were boooombbb!\n\nSecondly, the service was great! All staff were kind and helpful :)\n\nLast, I loved loved the atmosphere. The lights were purposely on the dark side and it made me a little sleepy lmao. I was so full that I was about to pass out in the restaurant.\n\nOverall, my total was $41 which is a little expensive but it was worth it for the experience!

You know when you eat something and you feel all nourished and happy and wholesome? That's how I felt after having the food at Chisme. Ingredients were really fresh, and the even the fried food wasn't too greasy. Everything was just absolutely delicious, and perfect and I felt satiated and satisfied and very happy. \n\nI'm not vegan, but my friend and I thought the vegan options sounded delicious, so we got the eggplant and jackfruit tacos. Best decision ever. It's so delicious, it just doesn't cross your mind that you're eating something vegan. The combinations of toppings also went so well, and might I say the hot sauce also had just the right amount of heat. My friend LOVED the peanut mole in the eggplant tacos. (Tip: it's on the steak tacos as well!)\n\nWe had an early dinner around 5.30pm, and knowing myself, I knew I'd be hungry by around 8pm, so I got a box of steak tacos and cauliflower ceviche to go (recommended by the lovely lady at the counter). I personally preferred the vegan tacos to the steak tacos, but they were also so good. Cauliflower ceviche came with fresh, warm, chips. The whole combination was to die for. The ceviche was so incredibly refreshing, the perfect late evening snack I wanted! \n\nAlso ate pinchelotes... and I love corn, so that was good too.\n\nEverything everything EVERYTHING was good.

We ordered the following:\n\nSteak tacos - I really enjoyed the marinade, it was unique in a very good way. \nMahi mahi tacos - These were just ok, I think the fruity salsa overpowered the flavor of the mahi mahi.\nJackfruit tacos - Whatever topping they had (it was pink though.. Seasonal greens? Sweet cabbage?) made the entire taco really tart. Even after taking some of it out, it still tasted interesting to me...  We weren't huge fans of this one. \nPinchelotes - Really good. They sure didn't jip on the cheesiness!\nGuac and chips - Extra chips are free!\n\nMake sure to try the house hot sauce! It has a real nice kick to it, and it's sweet.\n\nIt's pretty expensive here. The tacos range from $8-12 for just 2 tacos and I'm pretty sure the pinchelotes were about $8-9 (seeing as how I usually get elote for $3.)

The food was out in a prompt fashion, and our taste buds lit up when we took our first bite. Holy moly peanut butter MOLE. These flavors WORK. Every bite was just like the first - magical.

To get straight to the point, everything was delicious, the decor of the restaurant looks fantastic, and the woman at the counter couldn't have been nicer. \n\nOf the two different types of tacos we ordered, I personally like the jackfruit one a tiny bit more; the mint verde that was lathered on top of the cabbage in the taco was my favorite part of the taco. Our only criticism with the skirt steak taco is that the meat itself could've been cut a bit more, into smaller bit size pieces. With how the meat is cut right now, there's a good chance your first bite pulls out the entire piece of meat, leaving you with a meatless taco. Be sure to grab extra napkins for the skirt steak taco too! The (delicious) mole sauce is going to be dripping all over your hands once you're through with the taco. Overall, both tacos were carefully thought out in composition and I can definitely appreciate that.\n\nIf you've never had elote before, be sure to order one at Chisme! There are few things better than cheese on a cob of corn on a stick. You won't regret it.\n\nReading through the other Yelp reviews, it seems like people's primary criticism of Chisme is that the prices are too high, and that you can't mix and match the tacos. I disagree on both these points. The prices are perfectly reasonable for what you're getting, and you'll definitely be full after having an order of tacos. Not specific to Chisme, but to all restaurants in general: if the restaurant publishes its prices (which Chisme does), if you're unhappy with the pricing, just don't go; nobody's forcing you to. Re: mixing and matching, I've got a solution for you: come with a friend! Just order two and share :)\n\n5/5 experience, definitely coming back to Chisme.", "author": "Austin W."}

This paired very nicely with their fresh greens and mint verde. The mole sauce on the papas rojas was so good! Crispy potatoes topped with a savory white sauce. Yum! \nAlso, don't forget about their spicy green salsa. It definitely has a kick to it!\n\nThey offer bottled beer and wine, but we opted for the draft. I forgot what the brand of beer it was, but we went for the Cascade Sunshine, which is a light IPA. It paired very nicely with our meal.\n\nIf I had to nitpick something, I wish we could mix & match tacos. Since all the vegan tacos are $8 for 2, maybe at least we could mix and match the vegan options? Or maybe mix and match, but reflect the price of the higher priced taco. [Ex: Someone buys a steak & shrimp taco, it would still be $11 for the two].\n\nOverall, Chisme offers delicious tacos in a cozy environment at a decent price. I applaud the extensive vegan options and bold flavors not usually seen at a standard taqueria. I will be back again soon!", "author": "Lanie L."}

The menu is vegan heavy but there's several options for all the carniwhores out there. Beer and sangria available. \n\nSeveral reviews comment about the high pricing of Chisme which I agree to some extent. $5-$6 tacos at Americanized/Californian/Modern Mexican restaurants are the sad reality of San Francisco, thanks to sky high rents and one of the highest minimum wages in the U.S.\n\nI'm fine with that as long as:\n\n(1) They're larger than $1.50-$2 street tacos. \n(2) They're made with higher quality ingredients.\n(3) They taste good.\n\nChisme has some of that down. I ordered the Skrrt Steak Tacos: Steak, caramelized onions, peanut mole, guacamole, queso (2 pc - $12): http://bit.ly/2xWV9Gx. The tacos are larger than street tacos and have a good amount of meat in them (guesstimating 3.5 oz per a taco). Two were filling for me. \n\nBut, as others have mentioned, the tacos are very bland. It's supposed to have peanut mole which sounds delicious but I didn't taste any. The tacos were in dire need of salsa, hot sauce, and a squirt of lime which Chisme doesn't seem to offer which is really odd.\n\nWhile ample in portion, the steak was chewy. They were in long, flat strips so it was hard to get a clean bite because of the chewiness. \n\nI never heard of Chicago-style tacos before and I asked my taco fiends at work, and they have no clue either. I did notice that the corn tortillas were larger and thicker, and good quality compared to your standard corn tortillas at a taqueria. Maybe that's the \"Chicago\" twist?\n\nI also ordered one of their vegan sides: Flower Basket - Fried pickled cauliflower + crispy curry kale w/ coconut ranch ($10): http://bit.ly/2xVoMud. I didn't like this at all. The cauliflower was sour as to be expected but it needed a better sauce for balance. The coconut ranch was watery and didn't taste like anything. Maybe a cashew cream based sauce would work better? The crispy kale reminded me of kale chips which I usually like but it had gooey [undercooked] batter in the middle. There were maybe 7-8 pieces of veggies and for $10 ($2 increase from last week), it was grossly overpriced. \n\nTheir drinks are also grossly overpriced: a small cup of horchata with mostly ice is $6 (see Genevieve Y's picture: http://bit.ly/2fN4pob) and a cup of agua fresca is $7. But, they do have complimentary fruit infused water which I did enjoy because who doesn't love free?!\n\nService is friendly and food is cooked to order. \n\nLoved the d\u00e9cor. I AM in love with the Mariachi honey bears on the wall - so cute!\n\nSince they're really new, Chisme does have potential. Add some salsas and lower the price points of the sides and the drinks, and they'll get the hangry spillage from Liholiho across the street.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I stopped by Chisme with a few friends after seeing a show nearby.  Finding solid vegan food has been more difficult than I would imagine in San Francisco, but Chisme had a few tacos and other menu items that are vegan.  \n\nThe vegan tacos are jackfruit, eggplant, and plantain. All three were delicious. I think maybe the eggplant was my favorite as the breaded and fried crispy pieces of eggplant were crunchy and delicious. \n\nThe cauliflower ceviche was also delicious. As someone who recently started eating more of a plant based diet, I definitely find myself missing some of my favorite foods. While definitely not the same as real ceviche, this cauliflower ceviche definitely hit the spot with the lime juice and jalape\u00f1o flavors. \n\nThe staff was extremely friendly and attentive, the place was clean, and the decor was nice. \n\nI will definitely be back!", "author": "Paul W."}

Great food, excellent service, and nice venue. \n\nfirst and foremost, the food. the mahi mahi tacos are great. full flavor from the fish and the toppings. the pineapple bits bring out the sweetness and the slaw and sauce carried the flavor of the fish making a mean taco. \n\nAlso tried the quesadilla. if youre for the traditional super quesadilla, id veer left from this item. the reason being is that the meat is sauteed with red onions and other seasonings that focus the taste on the seasonings, rather than the meat. not bad or terrible, just not your typical tacqueria style. \n\nlastly dessert and drinks. the plantains are an interesting take. if youve had thai style fried banana then this isn't far from that. plantains have a natural sugar coat when fried, so this was a lot sweeter, but the vanilla ice cream calmed the sweetness down. the churros are stuffed wtih caramel, so be careful of sweetness overload. the cream that accompanies the churros is great! homemade and not too dense. \nif you still have room, get the horchata. its a vegan take on it and it is honestly such a refreshing drink to have with your meal. hope this helped. leave a line, or lets explore food!!!", "author": "Nikole D."}

Very soggy tacos that drip everywhere and the tortillas rip open very easily so be careful and make sure you eat over your 'plate'. \n\nThe mouth feel / texture also needs some work: the spinach gets warm and soggy due to the dripping wet black beans and watery salsa and then it clumps together and all comes out at once making a huge mess that you have to scoop back into your tortilla with your fingers. \n\nAnother factor - if you are zero waste friendly this may not be the place for you.

I love me some pork, but I would gladly swap my carnitas for this forever (ok, maybe 80% of the time). If only other joints served jackfruit, there would be more vegans in the world.\n\nThe eggplant tacos were a-okay, a little difficult to eat honestly (maybe the eggplants need to be chopped into smaller pieces?) but they tasted good. The guac wasn't anything special and I wish the tortillas came separately.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience at Chisme and I will definitely be coming back for the jackfruit tacos.\n\n-\n\nNow a couple of suggestions for the restaurant owner:\n\nPlease serve food on actual plates; there is no reason for food to be served on disposable plates when this is a sit-in restaurant. It's wasteful and SF is all about being ecofriendly. \n\nPlease allow for a mix and match type order for the tacos. I really wanted to try other flavors but the orders come with 2 tacos. The tacos are pretty expensive, so I think being more flexible about this would compensate for the price.\n\nI would suggest a better presentation for the guacamole and chips (definitely more chips).

They also have an amazing vegan cauliflower ceviche, a super tasty poblano mashed potato, the poblano pepper (not spicy) totally make it very unique.

So typically for the most part I feel Mexican food isn't something that can be improved on very much, but I am not sure what the hell they are doing back there in the kitchen but I think I would equate it to sorcery.  The food was so good, I cannot really say what in particular as to what I all ate because the group I was with literally got everything on the menu.  I am not a huge fan of vegetarian or vegan dishes(pretty sure I was a Tyrannosaurus rex in my past life) but it was fricken delish!  That is definitely something that I am going to remember for sure.  Their drink choices are on point too, though I didn't have any of the horchata, as I opted for the beer(don't judge me).

Too saucy/messy, the meat was gritty, and toppings got lost and overwhelmed by the saucyness of the tacos. I will say they have A LOT of vegetarian options here, especially taco options I didn't try, so if your a vegetarian maybe ignore my review and try this place out.

The steak was cooked well but I had to add at least 2 pinches of salt to each taco. The tacos definitely looked tasty, but I was a little surprised I had to add salt to taste, especially when I'm not one to add much salt to my food usually. \n\nThe website boasts \"affordable and contemporary Mexican-inspired cuisine,\" however, I wasn't impressed by my $8 guacamole and chips. There were only 14 chips intricately placed in the guacamole, which tasted very fresh. I just didn't see how 14 chips in guacamole with a flower in the middle served in a paper bowl served for here could be justified. They charged an extra $2.75 for extra chips as well. \n\nI'm hoping it was just a one time incident in regards to bland tacos. As far as price goes, I think the chips and guacamole were a little overpriced. At least offer more chips and present the chips and guacamole in actual porcelain/ceramic bowls if you're going to charge that much. I could purchase a whole bag of chips for the price of adding more chips to the 14-chips I received... \n\nRegardless, I do love that Chisme offers good vibes and a fresh take on Mexican food... The Counter seating by the window would definitely be a great spot to people watch. \n\nI'm a full supporter of all the restaurants popping up in our Tendernob neighborhood.

Then with my dad, then with my homies again. Through these three visits, the food was consistent with the first visit. \n\nChisme has a nice atmosphere and the staff are very friendly. They feature - basically - tacos, a few side dishes like roast corn with cojita (mmmm!) and some small unique salads.  Textures are a major thing here. A taco may be piled with crispy pickled cabbage, a few deep fried bites, and liberally doused with piquant sauce. Mashed potatoes are gooey with cheeses. For me, the range of textures, the freshness and piquant spices really make this place. They encourage you to try their house made green salsa, which is citrusy and fresh, and tummy warming.\n\nRegarding drinks, they have a good selection of beer, wine, and some really tasty non-alchoholic bevs. \n\nit's nice to see rice and beans - the perfect protein - on the menu with their fresh mango salsa. However I was surprised at the low quality of the white rice served with this dish. White rice, ok fine, but the rice itself is not a fine grain of rice. It's mushy and just very different from the overall consistent quality they have in everything else.\n\nI'm not exactly certain what a Chicago style taco is. However the tortillas are thick and tasty. I wonder how sustainable it is to ship them across the country though, and would it make a difference in price if they made them locally?

I love the artist Fnch so I was happy to find his little honey bears lined up like they were meeting me for lunch. My boyfriend and I split the Via Via and the Jackfruit tacos. If you are two vegan eaters, order just like that. Eat the Jackfruit tacos first (I still cannot believe how good they were), and end with the sweet plantain. \n\nOnly open for 5 weeks, this place is going to be around for awhile, they're food is just too good.", "author": "Jacklyn K."}

I had no idea that it had just recently opened until the owner started chatting with me as I was in there eating - really awesome customer service! I had the chicken tacos and decided to treat myself to some churros since I noticed a few other people were also eating them. The food came out pretty quickly and the chicken tacos were super good, the presentation alone gets 5 stars because they looked too good to eat. The churros were even better, if that's possible. I truly don't think I've eaten such a delicious desert before, and that's not an exaggeration - everyone needs to order the churros!! The girls at the front were really nice and friendly, they answered any questions I had with no issues - which I appreciated.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-05-28", "description": "First and foremost the people that have taken our orders have been amazing and this review does not reflect the service or staff whatsoever. \n\nI think the problem I have with Chisme is perhaps the efficiency of the kitchen, speed of food deliver(chips and guacamole came out 15 minutes after our order was placed , when our mains arrived on a slow Monday evening)/prices on our meals on both visits have been insanely high, for that money I Could have eaten at Liho Liho across the street or 2x visits to any of the rest of the neighborhood taco places. \n\nI understand Brick and mortar prices when starting out, I've been a member of the service industry for 20 years, cook,expo, server, bar back, bartender, barista etc. but for a very small steak quesadilla $12 dollars is pretty bad. I was very excited for vegan options for my girlfriend since the usual is a veggie burrito minus some toppings at other places so when she sampled 2 different tacos on 2 visits and was left unimpressed it bummed me out. Also there are a lot of fried options for the vegan choices. It would be nice to see the jackfruit made like carnitas or pulled chicken as opposed to deep fried. Over all it just feels like I'm dining at an off the grid style food truck inside of a great store front. I think part of the menu needs a reinvigoration instead of the usual suspects you might see at so many \"hip\" Mexican takes on classic styled restaurants. \n\nI make vegan Mexican food all the time at home, family recipes and new ideas. I'd love to see some classics made vegan instead of what we ordered. We live in the neighborhood and would love to love this place, but $40 for one order of tacos, a quesadilla, 12 chips in a pile of guacamole and a horchata(fantastic) is not worth coming back unless some things change. It's sit down prices at a fast casual place. \n\nI would love to have my mind  changed but I think portion control, prices, and menu revamp would be needed.", "author": "Joe A."}

I like the decor, the staff seemed friendly, I believe I met the owner and she seemed interesting, and most importantly, I loved the concept of the menu...but, I felt a little let down by the \"casual cantina\" it represents itself as. The menu is priced for a minimum of $20 per person to have a meal. It is hard to walk out of there satisfied for less. The most filling item is a $12 quesadilla, but I still wanted more. And it took almost 20 minutes to get. Great place to eat, have drinks and share a meal with friends. Not so great for stopping in for a quick reasonably priced meal.  But all the cute plates did look yummy. Quesadilla was tasty, but not $12 tasty. The safest part is that I'm a taco fiend. I LOVE tacos. But I would've had to have spent $20 to be satisfied with a taco meal there. You get two tacos for $12, basically forcing you into ordering more.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-27", "description": "This review is for the vegan options. The jackfruit taco was outstanding. Deep-fried (?) jackfruit gave it a crispiness I've never seen before. The texture worked really well. The eggplant was interesting, but I probably won't order it again. I didn't love the other vegan one (black beans and plantains) because it tasted like a Caribbean plate in taco form, which is to say, it was tasty but not what I want in a taco. I didn't love the horchata but my bf loved it. It tasted like coconut milk with cinnamon... which again, is fine, but not what I want when i order horchata. (The coconut ranch also tasted very strongly of coconut, didn't love that.) I wish you could order one taco instead of two, but I think that would draw more attention to the ridiculous price per taco. But it's a fancy taco and a tasty taco, so I'll pay the extra for that jackfruit.

So I got that going for me.\n\nThe guacamole is good, too, but I prefer mine with onion and tomato mixed in.  Chisme's guac is made fresh with avocado, cilantro, lime, and salt.

Both times everything was stellar. The second time, we ordered steak tacos but the girl that took the ordered accidentally put in chicken. When we pointed this out, she kindly said sorry and said she'll arrange steak, she did this without charging us the difference. Then, when the food arrived, we had not realized that one pair of the tacos has a peanut mole on it, and did not ask for it to be removed when we ordered. This was not a problem but the girl just left the peanut one and brought a second pair without peanuts to no extra charge. \n\nJust an example and it was this great overall.

The mashed potato was the bomber (pbbly the best mash I've had) and the rice/beans side was also really good. \n\nMy only 2 gripes:\nAt $4.5-$6 (including tax) for EACH taco, it's pricey for what you get. A portion of 2 is not filling. I wish they'd have an option to do 3 for $10.\n\nSingle-use cups, bowls, and utensils drive me crazy. I know the owner said that they recycle and not having to do dishes saves water. But take into account what it takes to produce/transport those paper plates and plastic water cups (which are not recyclable or compostable) = not so convinced. Super Duper uses corn-based compostable utensils so maybe that's a good compromise? Just my 2 cents. \n\nRegardless, great creative tacos and menu. Vegan friendly.

The items I tried were the:\n\n1) steak tacos: these were tasty and I felt had a fair amount of steak in them. I know other people complained about the amount, but I didn't have that issue. The steak was also tender and not overly salted (I hate salty food). The peanut mole was something I enjoyed, even though I was hesitant at first. \n\n2) mashed potato bowl: these were my favorite item. Poblanos in mashed potatoes are delicious! I'm surprised this isn't more common. \n\n3) black bean and mango: I liked this a lot as well. Black beans and mangos, what's not to like?  \n\nMy wife also had the via via taco. I didn't get a chance to try it, but she loved it. \n\nAll in all, this was a positive experience for me and if I lived in the area I'd go back for sure since some of the other items I saw people eating looked good as well.", "author": "Sargon N."}

Awesome decor and wild use of color. No tipping option on their square tablet payment machine. I can't  figure out why in the most expensive city in the country one would not always have a tipping option at a restaurant is absurd and makes us guests feel like you don't care about your staff which in turn makes me.not want to support you in my neighborhood. Now don't be rude with weird amounts please....15% ,18%,20% is acceptable. You also have no happy hour pricing at all. I walk by every day and I see the place empty. Just a couple ideas to fix this before you go belly up and start blaming  the neighborhood. There are many in the direct neighborhood who don't have kitchens but I keep walking by every day because of these few easy fixes. A frequent diner program would be cool too. Like 2 free tacos after 10 meals, I mean who cares taco cost is cheap and it promotes repeat biz.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-03", "description": "I came here twice during the soft opening. So far the menu consists of 6 kinds of tacos, sides, and one dessert. They have a small selection of bottled beer and 3 on tap which are served in disposable plastic cups. The tacos and the sides are also served on disposable containers, so the place has a cafeteria/food truck kind of feel. I was pleasantly surprised to see that half of the taco choices are vegan and they're priced lower than the meat options. $8.25 for two veg tacos (two of the same kind, no mixing) seems reasonable, or at least no worse than anywhere else. And they were good enough that I probably would eat them again. However, most of the side items and some of the drinks are ridiculously overpriced. I tried the $8 pinchelotes which are two cuts of seasoned corn on skewers. The total amount is smaller than one ear of corn. It tasted okay but that would be an outrageous price for one ear of corn in any restaurant. The rest of the side items are similarly small and overpriced. There's more ridiculousness happening on the drinks menu. $7 for agua fresca?? That's for one plastic cup, not a pitcher. And $6 for horchata. And you can see the $9 dessert in the photos. There is no salsa bar but if you ask for it, you'll receive salsa verde.\n\nI might come back for tacos but I'm staying the hell away from everything else on the menu.", "author": "keith s."}

The salad was also simple, yet unique, and having the option to add meat on top of it would be ideal (sorry vegans). Also, since I often judge a cantina by the quality of it's chips, I say AMEN to this place+ they give you more chips until you can't chip anymore. The Tacos have thicker tortillas and are truly filling! I ordered a few different ones like I have at other places near me because I'm use to the small bites nature of most tacos- nope! Could barely eat my second one because I was so full! Keep that in mind when looking at the price! Like others have said, the \"salsa\" is spicy! Amazing, but spicy, especially for the ill prepared.
