Everything we got was delicious!\n\n- Braised pork belly - Tasted the way it did when I was growing up. Note that this is similar to the Japanese kakuni style and not the crispy skin style. So amazing and flavorful! I loved the quail eggs, which was a unique addition (growing up we cooked this with regular chicken eggs). \n- Shanghai sauteed rice cakes with cabbage and pork - To die for!! I think this dish isn't written about much because it's not as well known in the US, but honestly, Jiangnan's serves one of, if not the best, rice cakes I've ever had! The rice cakes are sauteed perfectly and tossed with a delicious saucy Napa cabbage that's been cooked till it's absorbed just the perfect amount of the light gooey sauce flavor. And the little pieces of pork are perfectly seasoned and cooked. \n- Sweet and Sour Spare Ribs - so authentic, not your orange American sweet and sour sauce with breaded, fried meat! This is braised but with the slight tanginess that can only mean a splash of vinegar at the end of the cooking process. Yum yum YUM!! And of course, fall off the bone meat. \n- Bell peppers and potatoes - a good dish, and interesting and unique for sure, but I probably wouldn't get this again given all the other things I want to try.\n- Dry fried string beans - also good, but not great; next time I'd like to try another vegetable dish, like the napa cabbage!\n\nThe only downside is that we came at 6:30 pm on a weekend and had to wait about 35-40 minutes. I wish they'd use the Yelp waitlist so I could put my name on the list in advance! But other than that, everything was phenomenal. Food was great, service was quick (it's not American service, but it's good service for an authentic Chinese restaurant). \n\nI can't wait to come back and bring my very Chinese mother here. This is probably the highest compliment I can pay. \n\nMy new favorite Chinese restaurant in the city!!", "author": "Jaching H."}

Nothing is oversweet and the vinegar mix tastes remarkably clean and doesn't end up being as heavy feeling as you'd think. We split a lions head meatball (just get one, or you'll over-order), the spare ribs, the duck, and this stewed cabbage and chicken. Everything was quite good, with the spare ribs and cabbage remarkably being the highlights. The cabbage was really just mushy greens with a little chicken and I have no idea why it tasted so good.

I love the small quail eggs that come with it too. I also tried the Lion's Head meatball or Homemade Meat Ball in Sauce ($4.99 each), which is pretty good too. Both of these dishes are heavy soy sauce based so you probably want to order some rice to eat with it as it can get a little salty by itself. The Shredded Potato with Green Pepper ($7.99) was a nice, light dish to go with the other two. The flavor and texture of the potatoes were just right. Overall, their food is pretty good and authentic. \n\nThe service was not bad. We did have to remind our waitress a couple times for things we asked for, but it was okay as she was good about bringing them. The food portions are not large, which allows you to order more items. They are located in a busy area on Balboa St in the Outer Richmond District, so parking may be a little bit of a challenge.

(Note: latecomers may have a short wait as it was full when we left with people hanging about the front door.)\n\nI'm always nervous about showing up with so many small kids because as everyone knows they are really messy. The staff there were more than welcoming. Even after 2 glasses of water were spilled. They even commented (in Chinese) about how cute the kids were and how good they were at drawing (I disagree - they were kid terrible). \n\nBut on to the food! It's great to go try out Chinese restaurants with lots of people so you can order a bunch of food. Even better with adventurous eaters - or at least eaters who let me do all the ordering :-). For Jiangnan food we ordered -\n\n * stewed duck soy sauce - yum yum! I love duck and this was no exception. Definitely order a side of rice to mop up the sauce which was savory and rich.\n\n * cauliflower pork belly - this was one of my favorite dishes, cauliflower chunks with small slices of pork belly just for flavoring, not heavy or fatty at all as the pork belly might suggest\n\n * salt pork veggie fried rice - was not like a crispy fried rice, more like softly steamed with a velvety texture and nice light pork flavor, very comforting and a huge it with the kids\n\n * yang chung noodle soup - very lightly flavored broth with noodles, hits the same spot as a matzo ball soup, may not be for everyone as it's very mild though the noodles were good\n\n * sweet and sour spare ribs - or at least I thought this was what I ordered but they weren't very sour at all, in any case they were still good.\n\nThe group also ordered pan fried dumplings which I didn't try, eggplant (which I liked but I almost always like eggplant), and rice cake.\n\nI would definitely bring my Chinese parents here.", "author": "Jean K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-10", "description": "Came after reading an article in the chronicle that featured this restaurant as one to try for Shanghainese food.\n\nStarted off our meal with a braised lion's head meatball to share. It's about a half pound pork meatball braised in brown sauce. I thought the meatball was remarkably tender, but I'll be honest, I much prefer lion's head to be stewed in a clear broth with napa cabbage. That being said, Jiangnan's version was still very good.\n\nNext, we ordered the large bowl of noodles. For $6, the value is off the chart for this dish. I love the white peppery chicken broth it's cooked in and it also comes with some baby bok choy which is a nice touch. It's meant to be a sort of substitute for rice and as such, you should be ordering additional entrees to accompany this bowl of noodles.\n\nTo accompany these noodles, we ordered a variety of entrees. My favorite was the shredded potatoes sauteed with green bell peppers and vinegar. A must try if you haven't before. My second favorite were the sweet and sour braised spare ribs. Unlike takeout Chinese food with its red sauce, these spare ribs are braised in a thick, sweet and savory brown sauce. They were also fall off the bone tender!\n\nBringing up the back, we also ordered the oxtail soup, the braised bass, and the preserved vegetable fried rice. All had it's own merits: I loved that the bass was a whole fish and not just filets and I also liked the addition of tofu knots and the fermented/spicy flavors of the oxtail soup, but both left a little to be desired in my opinion. I thought there weren't nearly enough oxtail pieces (only 3 in our order) and as for the fish, I didn't really see the soft tofu as added value to the dish. It almost made picking bones out even more difficult. The rice dish was too soft/wet for a fried rice in my opinion.\n\nAs for the space itself, it's pretty cramped. Definitely no elbow room - a table for 4 is sat at a table for 2 in any other restaurant, to give you an idea. So get cozy and enjoy!\n\nThat being said, this meal was definitely very good and very filling. All our choices also came to under $100 pre-tip.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

It felt like going to Disneyland as a kid for your very first time and having a hard time contemplating whether you would like to go on Alice in Wonderland ride or Mad Tea Party. They are both too hard to choose from! When you go on both rides, however, you realize the former involves sitting in a car and riding from the beginning to the end. After reaching the end, you feel like you had an adventurous experience, but there is no use starting from the beginning to the end again; it definitely didn't make you a different person. The latter involves spinning until you finally come to an end and stop. Once the ride stop, you just want to go on this exhilarating experience all over again. This restaurant seemed more like the former.\n\nThis restaurant caught my attention because of the super high Yelp reviews. The Sauted Rice Cake with Chicken and Napa Cabbage ($11.99) was good, but it was not like \"Oh my! This is the best dish I have ever eaten in my life.\" \n\nMy dish tasted very light and I could barely taste oil. It did not feel like the soft cabbage pieces were totally drenched in sauce. On a plus side, this place uses napa cabbages which are one of the best cabbages in the world in my opinion! The chicken was ok. It didn't look like there were too many pieces.\n\nMy friend asked for a customized green onion noodle dish ($6 - I thought I was mad when I saw how cheap this dish was!). It did not meet his expectations in that it lacked flavor and there were not too many green onions in his dish. He also ordered Braised Pork with Quail Eggs ($12.99) and thought the meat was a little overcooked. \n\nThe service was great! The waitress welcomed us and said goodbye as we walked out the door. She didn't hesitate when we asked for extra take out containers.\n\nThis place was good, although it was a little expensive.

Jando is well versed in many different cuisines... but particularly has extensive knowledge of Chinese food. So when I started pressing him weeks in advance about where we could go to get some authentic Chinese food. Since we were located in the financial district for work, he was not very optimistic. But when crunch time came, we made Jiangnan Cuisine our destination.\n\nAs we walked in, we were told that Yelp doesn't even have a category for what this food is. They have Shanghainese as a category. But that doesn't fully encompass the Jiangnan umbrella. I love knowing things like this when going into a restaurant. The inside was small, smelled amazing, and I had no idea about anything on the menu... just what I was looking for! We ordered for the entire table. And I started typing captions for my pictures in the beginning. But apparently the further into the food coma I slipped, the less I was motivated to do so.\n\nWe started with the shredded potatoes. I have had this before and it is very authentic, but very simple. These were some of the better I have had. Then the Lions head meatballs... the star of the show in my opinion. Absolutely incredible. I could have eaten these basketballs of meaty saucy goodness for the rest of the meal and been satisfied. I should have kept this sauce around until the rice showed up to soak it all up. The green beans were perfectly cooked and perfectly spicy. As for the tofu (not sure which one it was), I was pleasantly surprised. I don't like anything with huge chunks of tofu. But the sauce that drenched this dish could have gone on anything and been fantastic. The dumpling soup was also fantastic. I mainly had the dumplings because of slowing down. But those were enough to make this dish a five star. I was also slowing down because the pork belly showed up soon after. Did I already give the star of the show award away? Ehhh, short term memory. THIS was the star of the show. Everything was absolutely fantastic. But if I did this over, I would have gotten two orders of meatballs and two of the pork belly and not shared with anyone.\n\nThanks Jiangnan Cusine for a great meal, and Jando S for leading me there and guiding me through culinary bliss.

They got our name and promised to call when we were up.  So, we walked around the street checking out various shops, including a cool traditional Chinese medicine dispensary.  They told us the wait would be more than an hour, so we figured coming back in a 1/2hr would guarantee they wouldn't miss us.  And plus they had our cell #.\n\nWe stood outside their door for another 1/2hr, probably much longer.  Stood there like idiots until we realized everyone who came after us got in already.  So, finally, we asked what's up?... they claimed they came out and called our name and actually called our cell too.  What a f'ing LIE.  We stood there the whole time.  Not a single person came out in the entire last 1/2hr.  No one called our cell.  DO NOT LIE TO US.\n\nAnd of course, it doesn't end there... they forgot to bring me water despite my asking several times.  Also, out of the first 3 dishes we ordered, they didn't have 2 of them.  I HATE that.  So annoying to have your heart set on something and get denied... and 2/3rds of what we ordered?  Seriously?  Anyway... we eventually settled on...\n\n1. Stewed Duck in Soy Sauce (Half) Wuxi Style $19.95:  I would say this is their main specialty.  And honestly, it looked gorgeous.  I hate to say it, but it tasted pretty good too, though my gf notes the meat is a bit on the tough side.  Authentic Wuxi flavor though.  7/10\n\n2. Delicious Braised Pork $11.95:  Very similar flavor to the duck, and probably used the same sauce for both.  But again, that would be pretty authentic flavor-wise for the region.  The pork itself was tender and delicious.  Very nice.  7/10\n\n3. Shrimps with Maggie Sauce $16.95:  This my gf didn't appreciate too much.  She was perplexed with what \"Maggie Sauce\" was meant to be.  I explained to her that it's found on many American-Chinese menus and they use that Maggie soy sauce based seasoning, but she insists she has never seen such a name used to describe a dish in China.  She calls this dish \"home-cook made shrimp\" meaning something a casual mom would make.  At least the shrimp was perfectly done, juicy both in body and brains.  7/10\n\n4. Vegetable Rice with Salted Meat $9.95:  I think she found this most offensive and least authentic.  She said that this dish, as is indicated in Chinese, is traditionally cooked in a pot with the meat, like a paella.  What they gave us was just standard Cantonese fried rice with dried meat.  So, pretty much nothing like what it is supposed to be.  But I guess if you didn't know all that, it would taste alright.  3/10\n\nTimes like this really demonstrate how lame Yelp's single score system is.  Their service is beyond bad, clearly at most 1/5 stars.  But their food is actually pretty good.  I mean, if they weren't LIARS and so bad at manning our tables, I would have given 4/5, but I guess I'll still let them pass...\n\n3/5\n\n#sanfrancisco #chinese #wuxi", "author": "Dean C."}

Now I'm not sure it's worth a long drive from outside of SF but if you happen to live in The City, it's probably worth your Uber / Lyft ride over.  If you come at usual dinner time, there will be a short wait.\n\nWe had a lot braised pork, eggplant (yuxiang qiezi), string beans.  It was all great.

No one there to even man the stand so why bother having it. There was no semblance of a line or anything when you go in. It really irks me when establishments don't have an orderly process in place. A notepad was on the stand for you to scribble your name down. Just hang that notepad somewhere and get rid of the stand. \n\nThere was no one there to greet or acknowledge you while you're waiting. Very understaffed. I would have gone elsewhere if I weren't starving. Even the people who were seated seemed to have been waiting for ages. One group actually got up and left because the wait for the food was too long. When I finally got seated at the bar table, it was time to see how long the wait was to order and when the food will come out. \n\nThe waiter is actually quite nice making me feel bad about the above criticisms (but they still should be noted nevertheless). It gets pretty hot in this little space by the way. But then the bar table area also needs more lighting. It was kind of a farce seeing chairs being moved around from table to table for bigger groups. People didn't seem to mind at least. It took ~15min for both dishes to come. So now finally on to the food. \n\nEGGPLANTS \nI have this huge, undying love for eggplant and it originates from this dish (and a Sichuan variant). The eggplant is so tender and easy to chew. Beware this dish is served HOT. Don't attempt to stuff an entire piece in your mouth at first like I did. I burned my tongue and the roof of my mouth because I was so hasty. The sauce is spicy but not too spicy. From what I saw, it has ginger, garlic, black bean paste, scallions, and dried hot chilies. There's a vegetarian option with no minced pork. The eggplant glistens which is typical because you have to throw a lot of oil at it to force the water out.  \n\nBRAISED PORK\nI love the fatty portion of the pork. It just melts in your mouth and your taste buds soak in all that rich flavor. This dish is substantially sweet if you're wary of sugar. The lean meat is much more rough. I dipped those parts in the sauce to make chewing easier and to pick up the flavors. The quail tea eggs were a nice surprise! They are very dainty and cute. Like the eggplant (although for a different reason), I would take small bites of the fatty parts because I haphazardly put a whole piece into my mouth and it did not go down comfortably. Too rich! The portion size is decent. Pricey at $13.   \n\nI had to wait for a prolonged period of time to get containers and to pay as well which was not new at this point. I noticed that they increased the price of the Braised Pork by a dollar since a month ago. If you are planning on coming here, I would do it soon before they decide to raise prices again. \n\nThe reason I was really excited about this place is they serve a lot of my favorites dishes that my mom makes at home. The food met my expectations but the overall experience could have been better. The operational kinks need to be smoothed out before I can bump up my rating of this place.", "author": "Lauren H."}

I've tried a few in the city and east bay and was never quite happy with what I found. \n\nSF is mostly Cantonese or Americanized Chinese that I don't care about. So when I heard there was a jiangnan style Chinese restaurant opening, I was eager to try. It's a region in south central China near Shanghai. I've been to Shanghai once and really liked the food there. \n\nCame with a friend on a Saturday after a daytrip. So it was after dinner time but the restaurant was still packed. We put our names down. Luckily the wait wasn't too bad. \n\nThe restaurant is a bit small but very clean with jiangnan themed decors. Our server was very friendly. We spoke mandarin with him.  \n\nWe ordered Suzhou stewed duck \u82cf\u5dde\u9171\u9e2d, braised pork with quail eggs, homestyle eggplant, and veggie rice with salted meat. We got our food after just a bit wait. Everything we tried were so authentic and delish. I probably wouldn't order the rice again b/c it was good although not outstanding. But man, the rest of the dishes were phenomenal! My favorite was deff the Suzhou stewed duck. Omg it was seasoned and cooked to perfection with soy sauce. Finger licking good! My friend couldn't stop raving about the braised pork. I must say it was pretty awesome with those quail eggs! And I'd totally get that homestyle eggplant again, too! \n\nNow this is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the city. I've already made plans to come back with another friend of mine. I have been thinking about that lion head meatball all this time. Can't wait to try more things on the menu!!!", "author": "Angela F. W."}

The vegetable fried rice is uniquely delicious. It's made with fresh steam rice so it's more moist than typical fried rice made with cooled rice. \n\nThe Xianghai Yang Chun Noodle Soup at 5.95 is a fantastic value as is the Braised chicken legs at $4.95.\n\nIt's a well kept secret.

Possibly run by the old manager of that restaurant? \n\nIt's nice and cozy inside. The service wasn't all too bad, even though we came late in the afternoon close to their closing time, and most of their tables were taken. I'm a big fan of their food, most of it tasted very home cooked and authentic. \n\n- their shredded potatoes with green peppers might be my favorite version in San Francisco. Not overdone, just great garlic/vinegar taste\n\n- Half duck: Half is more than enough for 2 people. The taste was pretty good, just smothered in a thick, sweet, soy based sauce of some sort. It isn't your traditional Peking roast duck, but I thought it tasted pretty good. Though I'm usually wary of the fat, and this duck contained ALOT of fat, it was like, a rich, delicious fat, enhanced with the sauce!\n\n- wonton soup: No complaints. You get alot of wontons, and they're pretty good. Tbh, not a big fan of \"wuxi style\" soups, because it usually comes with dried seaweed that gives the soup a different... older taste. Guess that's just a Jiangnan cuisine thing. \n\n- braised beef with potato: Yummy, comforting, carb-y soft potatoes and tender beef. It's delicious. Just not a big fan of the type of beef they use, which is the type alot of Cantonese clay pot beef dishes have, the kind with a layer of thick white tendon that curls up? That kind of beef just have a certain distinct, game-y flavor that I don't really like.", "author": "Ke C."}

We woke up one weekend craving for Chinese food, so made the trip to Jiangnan Cuisine. While some other review cautioned for the wait, when we arrived for lunch on Sunday around noon, there were still a couple of open table. We ordered eggplant with minced pork, a lion head meatball, tomato/egg noodle soup, along with fried buns with sweet & condense milk. We originally was thinking getting two lion head meatball since we were super hungry, but was warned about the size (1/2 lb!!) so we went down to 1 meatball. Good choice since the portion size was HUGE. The eggplant was soft and sauce-y. The only dish we didn't finish was the tomato/egg noodle soup, which was huge in portion size. It grew even larger as it soaked in more broth as time went on. I thought out of all the dishes, the noodle soup was the weakest as the noodle was just soaking up way too much broth. But the dish was still decent, and the rest of the dishes are excellent. The fried buns were excellent, which I think should be called Chinese donut as it's more similar to American donuts. The dish is pretty basic in concept but brings up so much childhood nostalgic. Overall, we had a great time, and we're already planning to come back to try some of the other dishes.", "author": "Sharon L."}

What a fun dining experience! \n\nI came here on a Saturday evening, so my party of 3 had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. I'm not well-versed in Shanghainese food, so I found the pictures of menu items posted outside to be quite helpful. Once seated, we were served complimentary green tea -- a nice touch since it was quite chilly outside. We started by ordering an item off the \"Dessert & Appetizing\" menu. We chose Chinese fried bread, which to our surprise was more of a dessert than an appetizer (it's hard to know with a title like \"Dessert & Appetizing\"!). The fried bread resembled donuts and came with a deliciously sweet dipping sauce. But hey, I'm not afraid to eat dessert first! \n\nNext, we ordered 3 main dishes -- kung pao chicken, shrimp chow mein, and braised pork. The chicken dish was flavorful and slightly spicy and I really enjoyed the chow mein. However, I LOVED the braised pork. The meat was super flavorful, the sauce was incredible, and the quail eggs added a delightful touch. This dish is a bit fatty, but that contributes to the great flavor. \n\nSo glad I stumbled upon this restaurant! I can't wait to come back and order more adventurous dishes!", "author": "Elyse W."}

This is a cute little restaurant with more of a Suzhou style decor. The place is small, and they don't take reservation for small parties. We went there pretty late at night, but still waited for 15 minutes, not too bad based on SF standard.\n\nI ordered mostly the traditional dishes you would eat for Chinese New Year only if I could eat more (only 2 of us):\n\nLion's Head - 5 star. Hands-down the best one I've had in bay area. Very good flavor, and you can tell it's fresh, and it's all meat (quite few restaurants mix too much flour in there).\n\nBraised Bass with Tofu - 5 star. The fish is very fresh and tender, tofu absorbs in the flavor and adds in a good balance.\n\nCauliflower (Gan Guo Hua Cai) - 4 star. It's cooked to just the right texture. The one star taken off is because it's a bit salty to my taste.\n\nVeggie and salted pork rice (Xian Rou Cai Fan) - 5 star. Even though it's not completely the way that Cai Fan is cooked (missing the crunchy rice part), it is so good that we devoured it. Considering I am trying to control my carb intake... I failed miserably.\n\nGlutinous Rice Balls and Osmanthus in Fermented Rice Wine \uff08Gui Hua Jiu Niang Yuan Zi) - 5-star. It's simply just tasty! And it's made in the authentic way that reminds me of mom's cooking.\n\nSesame balls - 5-star.

We got dessert as 3rd course, and waited forever for the 2nd dish to come out. But it must have been a busy night for them, so they just served based on what got ordered by other customers too. It's easier to batch cook. And at least they are considerate enough to serve us one course really fast so that we don't sit there without anything to eat.\n\nWill definitely go back to try out other dishes.", "author": "Jenny N."}

We came here after an appointment at UCSF, my who is Chinese & another doctor & visiting doctor from Bejing recommending this.  We never had Jiangnan cuisine or even heard of it, so this was quite a treat.  It is a small neighborhood homey place with friendly service in a bare bones atmosphere.  The braised meat balls are a must; you order them individually & they are like the Shanghai style lyon's head meat balls with a slightly sweet & salty sauce; this region is just west of Shanghai.  The ppotatos with bell peppers are comforting with fresh potatos & green peppers & cumin in a spicy sauce.  The ox tail was highly recommended with tender ox tail, little egg dumplings, mushrooms, greens, & other vegetables in a savery broth; the ox tail is easier eaten at home as it is on the bone, well, at least for me.  The Jiangnan noodles are also superb with thin rice noodles, minced pork, & greens in a peppery broth.  So, for some wonderful Jiangnan cuisine & something that is not your everyday Chinese food even by bay area standards with friendly service in a bare bones atmosphere at reasonable prices, Jiangnancannot be beat.

We both agreed it was excellent.\n\nLion's head meatball ($3.95) --tender, delicious, HUGE. Comes in its own bowl with a delicious sauce.  They also seem to sell this as a to-go lunch priced for George Washington high schoolers at $4.00 for meatball + rice.  A great deal.\n\nDelicious Braised Pork ($11.95)--the famous Hong Shao Ro (red-braised pork). EXCELLENT. Meltingly tender meat, with an unctuous layer of fat and thin chewy skin and the most delicious sauce.  Comes with 2 hardboiled eggs coated in the sauce too.\n\nFried Chinese Bread ($5.95)--6 small perfectly uniformly shaped steamed piping hot buns, flash-deep-fried so that the outside is crispy and the inside is soft and pillowy. Served with a small bowl of condensed milk to drizzle over as you please (or not).  We almost didn't order this one and we are so glad we did!\n\nStir fried spicy chicken with soybeans--on the other menu (not the lunch menu).  Very tasty. A bit less memorable than the other dishes we tried, but still great.\n\nThe woman who served us spoke primarily Mandarin, and she is very sweet.  I saw her give a free lunch to a young woman who had ordered some takeout, but then didn't realize that they didn't accept credit cards. \n\nThe decor is nice and tasteful and the dining area is very clean.

Came out to $15/person, including tip.", "author": "B. Y."}

We ended up ordering the lion head, braised pork, house special eggplant, and 1/2 soysauce duck. We thought it's cute the lady kept telling us we might be ordering too much instead of trying to hit make money from us. The food was really good, I think the only thing I felt was more standard was the lion head, which tasted good but similar to most restaurants. Other 3 were all really good, duck is super yummy but keep in mind the way it's prepared here doesn't have crispy skin so if thats what u like then this one might not be for u. The pork is very tender and comes with quail eggs (adorable and tasty). Will try to come back next time I come to the city again. Only minus is the typical Asian restaurant flaws: mediocre service and ambience but those things dont bother me much if the food is legit.", "author": "Cathleen L."}

It is quite a small restaurant but the food is great!! Coming from New York, we always have a variety of food and usually proclaimed some of the best in the nation.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-04", "description": "I am glad to see this restaurant is doing well with people lining up outside. \n\nFINALLY there is a non Cantonese Chinese restaurant opened in SF besides those spicy sichuan and northern China food.  I say \"finally\" because I am not big into spicy food, and those northern China food usually just good on noodles, dumplings...I like them but need some more variation - a good Chinese dish.\n\nI have been living in SF for 17 years now and am really tired about the very plain taste of Cantonese food which often tastes cheap.  Please do not get me wrong.  I love quality made dim sum and the steam fish done by the Cantonese seafood restaurant.  They do a great job.  However, if you are the immigrant who come from the region other than Canton Province, you know what I am talking about by the plain taste of Cantonese food.  Besides corn starch, black bean sauce and small garlic chunks are added into their dishes, there is no much flavor at all.\n\nSo, you see how happy I am that there is a good Chinese restaurant with Jiangnan flavor opened up in my neighborhood.  My friend and I have visited there three times now and most of the dishes we tried were pleasant.  The portion is a little bit small compared to the Cantonese restaurants, but it is Ok.  \n\nThe \"lion's head\" ($4.95 per piece) is a must try.  It tastes even better with plain rice (true for other meat dishes they have).  For this dish, they do a better job than many Chinese restaurants do in the greater China region.\n\nThe restaurant title in English \"Jiangnan\" means south of the Yang zi Jiang (river), and in general it indicates to the area in the broad southern region.  The title in Chinese is \"Su Wei Guan\".  Su is the ancient title of the province \"Jiang Su\".  \"Wei\" means the taste/flavor.  \"Guan\" here is another word for restaurant.  I like it.  They picked up a nice name.\n\nEverything else is good.  Servers are sincerely friendly, and the kitchen staffs do a good job.  Restroom is very tiny.  So if you are not a petite size, visit a restroom first before you come.\n\nA few suggestions to the restaurant:\n1. Lower the volume of the music - it makes the background too noisy.\n2. Remove the valet use table/desk at the entrance - It makes the entry and exist unpleasant.\n3. Put some cushions on the wooden bench along the wall - too hard to sit on.\n4. Menu - adds a brief intro to your food and its region.\n\n\n* In my opinion, you can find very few nice Chinese food (non Cantonese) in SF.  You need to drive to the south bay to find them.  I called it \"the belt\" region from Mountain View down to Cupertino, San Jose, Milpitas, and up to Union City and Fremont.", "author": "TG B."}

I'm not going down the route of best ever or most authentic place in San Francisco because that's just unnecessary. With all of the Chinese restaurants we have in the Richmond district it's nice to find one that stands out and offers unique flavors for a fair price. At least in my experience,  it's very rare that you find a Chinese restaurant that specializes in braised meats. You can tell a lot of care is taken in the food prep and it appears to be a small family run place, but I could be wrong. I intend to go back to try much of the menu but today I can speak to the braised pork, Mapo Tofu, lions head meatball and the spicy pork. All were spot on.", "author": "John D."}

We ordered too much for the four of us, which is a happy accident.  I love having enough leftovers to not have to cook the next night.  Lion's head was tender and juicy, a winner with the kids.  The portion of the braised shrimp was generous to say the least---this would have made sense in the real Jiangnan, where river shrimp are small, so when you spoon them up and dip them in vinegar, you can easily fit 5-6 in one bite.  We have bigger shrimps here, so the dish seems, massive, when it's pretty much nothing but shrimps, all 30-40 of them.  Wuxi wonton was perfect, in both the subtle umami taste of the broth and the silky wonton skins.  One of my favorite was the spareribs.  Something so pedestrian, something that you seem to able to master easily at home, but actually rarely done so well, with the perfect blend of sweet and tang, fat and acid.  Strings beans and rice cakes with mustard green were good too. But I think any decent Chinese restaurants would have made them quite well.", "author": "Candice B."}

We arrived on a Thu (8/17) just at opening and were seated in the front.  We ordered the beef chow mein, eggplant dish, and won ton soup.  We wanted to order green beans, but the server said the quality was poor.  All were $11.99.  Since we expected the food to be spicy, we also ordered a couple of small bowls of rice ($1.25/ea) .  The waitress had some difficulties explaining the dishes to us.  Her helper brought out the chow mein and the eggplant dish first and not the soup.  Finally the soup arrived.  Generally the soup is served first.  There are no condiments on the table such as salt, pepper, soy sauce, hot sauce which are typical of Asian restaurants.  They never brought out the rice.  The food was good to average and is about 20-50% higher than a typical Chinese restaurant.  Of course, people pay the higher price for quality and ambience, but this place didn't have it.  The music was way too loud and we had to ask them to turn it down.  After finishing our meal, we had to wave down the servers to get take out boxes and the check.  People were waiting to be seated and it was crowded at the entrance that one woman leaned against my chair and finally moved away when I looked in her direction.  Unlikely that we would return.

Kudos to the kitchen for managing the large influx.  Walking through the kitchen to get to the restrooms, I was impressed at the chefs' efficiency in a relatively small space - particularly given the menu's variety.  Only hiccup was that I only intended to order one soup, depending on which of two options could be made vegetarian, and instead both were brought to the table (along with the two entrees and order of  vegetarian spring rolls); too much for two, but I like leftovers.  Best dish was the Wuxi Style Tofu Soup with irregular tender platelets of tofu (instead of the usual cubes), lots of mushrooms, and some nori (and probably not a vegetarian stock); next best was the cabbage dish heading up the Vegetables section of the menu.  The Eggplant without meat was fine though a bit sweet, the vegetarian spring rolls were as expected, and the Xianghai Yang Chun Noodle Soup was good but a little boring.  All of the dishes were served piping hot.", "author": "Peni Soo G."}
