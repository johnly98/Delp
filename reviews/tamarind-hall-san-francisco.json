Tamarind's pumpkin curry was incredible. It was light, but bursting with lovely flavor. Their papaya salad was also wonderful and full of fresh vegetables. I was so enamored by the food that I made sure to make a mental note to use them for a big annual work event that was coming up.\n\nAs the event neared, I made sure to reach out to Tamarind Hall well in advance. Salisa was amazing from start to finish. She eased all of my worries when it came to quantities of food as well as executing both vegan and gluten free dishes.\n\nFor the big event we ordered their Platha Dip with three curry sauces, their Thai Pumpkin Curry, their Prig King and their coconut rice. Salisa made sure to be there for the delivery the night of and her and her staff even brought flowers to adorn the food display. It was evident how much she cares about making sure her customers thoroughly enjoy their experience with Tamarind Hall.\n\nThe Thai Pumpkin Curry was dreamy with Kabocha squash submerged in creamy, bright orange coconut curry made with tangy kaffir lime leaves, wild ginger, lemongrass and Thai chilis. The Prig King was full of fresh green beans and other assorted vegetables (Salisa was kind enough to add them) in a fragrant sauce, and the coconut rice was divine.\n\nEveryone at the event who tried the stunning looking spread was impressed. Everything tasted so fresh and it was all so beautiful.\n\nI have yet to actually visit Tamarind Hall's physical location for a meal (I definitely plan on it though) - but if you ever need fantastic catering for an event - please do not hesitate to order from here. \n\nTrust.", "author": "Jessica T."}

I am sad that they closed off the upstairs, because it was a really cool aspect of this place.  I felt that when you went upstairs, you were able to lounge around with friends, and they could care less.  \n\nI came here with a party of six for dinner and we were seated immediately .  I do recommend that this place invest in some new furniture because a lot of us just sank into in the chairs for lack of any cushion.  We were helped by Lisa who was super friendly and fun.  We decided on family style where we would order a bunch of things and share everything.  We ordered the garlic fries, very healthy fresh rolls, fried calamari, curry for 3, pad see ew, fried chicken over fried rice, garlic dungeness crab and noodles, omelet wrapped pad thai, and the garlic pork ribs.\n\nAll the food was absolutely delicious.  Everything tasted fresh, full of flavor, and was served piping hot.  The service was really good.  They checked on us constantly and helped us clear empty dishes to make room as soon as we finished them.  \n\nMy only recommendation for food would be to add add more roti in the curry for 3 appetizer.  We were left with 75% of the curry and no naan to dip it with.  My other suggestion is new chairs.  Other than that, I would recommend if you like Thai food.  I will be back.", "author": "Victor L."}

Ambiance was cool and bar area looked pretty cool. The staff there is so nice and attentive. \n\nWe ordered the Khao Koo Kapi which is a rice cooked in shrimp paste with egg, sweet pork, mango slices, chilies, etc all neatly laid out. Really flavorful and not that many restaurants carry this. Reminds me of my mom's homemade version. Also had the Tom yum soup which was really good as well. Lastly even though it's not thai, we had the garlic noodles with fresh crab because we had been craving this. Oh and of course they have Thai beers. \n\nOverall good place.

We ordered the healthy spring rolls with mango, avocado, and some other items wrapped up in lettuce to start (Happy hour $6), as well as the Pad See Ew with chicken and the Salmon Curry.  All were good, but I wish that they had other options for the yellow curry (besides salmon), as it is the mildest curry available.

The first time was OK but it was literally just my friend and I at the bar and the restaurant was practically empty. \n\nWent back a week later when it was busier and man was it a disaster.\n\n- horrible service (guy would take drink orders with half the table and not finish going around, I had to call him twice to actually take my order too). Food came out at very different times for all 8 of us (one friend didn't have his simple dish meanwhile everyone else was already done eating as it was getting cold. Random and inconsistent service: we ask for 3 IPAs and get two different beers. Instead of just fixing this simple mistake, the waiter would attempt to argue with us.. DUDE, just bring us IPAs and let's get over it! \n\n- bad food: I really hate to say this because I wanted to like the place. But it tasted blend for me and outright bad for some of my friends' dishes. Some left hungry without barely eating anything on their plate.\n\n- when we got the bill the 18% gratuity has been automatically added since we were 8. Since we literally had bad food and shitty service, we complained and asked if we could enter in our own tip since we had absolutely not been satisfied with anything. INSTEAD of apologizing or trying to understand what they had done wrong and try to solve the situation, the waiter argued with me and never once apologized. He even argued about the food and said \"WHO didn't like the food??\" To which half of the table answered.\n\nBonus shitty point for the water glasses not rinsed well and tasting like soap/product.\n\nNever coming back here..", "author": "Alexandre T."}

Experiences at most of these places fell flat as it seemed they were stingy with the seasonings. Moreover, I've know Thai cuisine to be filled with fresh produce. Tamarind Hall nailed it on all fronts. The food I enjoyed was full of freshness and flavor. Complex flavors that come together nicely. The heat complimented the meat. Fresh and varied produce to balance it out. I highly recommend and will make Tamarind one of my regular destinations. My taste buds have been to Bangkok.", "author": "Oakland O."}

Right as I walked in, I could tell this place was bumpin' with patrons so you know it must be good!\n\n The layout was confusing and not just puzzling to me but to all those that came after me. Usually restaurants have the register or check-in table and hostess somewhere near the front of the establishment but Tamarind Hall's was in the middle left hidden amongst the tables. I didn't exactly understand the protocol here but I realized that because the place is so busy and there was only 2 waiters bussing the entire place, you have to be swiftly go in the middle near the register and wait for one of the waiters in grey to pass you by so you can flag them and tell them you want to check in. Despite having an 8:30pm reservations, we weren't seated until 9pm or so. \n\nWe were seated in the way back near the bar area behind a tree. It was sort of hard to flag waiters down when you're hidden in the black shadows. \n\nRegardless, the food here was amazing! Granted, I only tried the two most mainstream Thai dishes you can get: pad see yew and pad thai. The portions were huge!! Flavoring was also on point. The pad thai was beautifully cradled inside an omelet shell and you have a choice between beef, pork, chicken, or shrimp. \n\nI would definitely come back to try their other menu offerings but maybe on a less busy night where I don't have to flag people so many times just to grab their attention. Perhaps on busier nights they should hire more manpower to accommodate.", "author": "Connie M."}

We were so chatty as this was a reunion of sorts but the service seemed slow to me.\n\nTake that with a grain of salt , because since we were chatting up a storm ,  we had not even looked at the menu when the server first checked. After that he used that as the pace we were comfortable with but I am just used to being checked on more frequently especially when the place is quiet.\n\nTypically at Thai restaurants the dish they serve with pride is the Pad Thai, but we all seemed ready to venture to other dishes.

This is definitely my favorite place for Thai food in SF! They have an impressively extensive menu and the coziest of interiors (hello Christmas lights all year round), and serve up incredibly flavorful and unique Thai food at an affordable price. \n\nI get the happiest vibes walking in - this neighborhood gem is casual and dimly lit and situated on Grant street in the quaint area of North Beach. Service is attentive and friendly - no complaints here :). \n\nOn to the food! The menu is massive and can therefore be overwhelming. My suggestion is to order several apps if your party is small in order to try a lot and share, tackle the mains if you're ambitious, or do a mix and match :). Here's some of my faves:\n\nThai-Style Fish Cake (appetizer - $10.95): This dish first off looks beautiful but secondly it is so delicious! The fish cakes are spiced really well and pair well with the sweet chili sauce that comes with it. Super delectable!\n\nCurry-osity (appetizer - $11.95): Two words - get this! The dish comes with 5 different curries / dipping sauces, each wonderfully flavorful, and pieces of roti pratha to dip in the curries. The pratha is buttery and delicious! We ended up asking for more pratha and then when that was done we kept the curries to have and add to our other dishes, like the fried rice.\n\nPad See You (main - $10.95): My brother in law orders Pad See You/Ew every single time he eats at a Thai restaurant and he said this is the best one he has had. Far too often this dish can be bland and underwhelming, but this one was perfect and not dry either! I absolutely loved it and thought the noodles were cooked perfectly.\n\nDungeness Crab Fried Rice (main - $15.95): This dish comes out with a good-sized heap of crab on top of the rice and boy is the crab FRESH. The rice has beautifully subtle flavors, with the flavor profile increasing when you add the light and lovely chicken broth. We really liked this dish just because it was simple and fresh. \n\nI cannot wait to try more things here and will keep coming back with groups! They take reservations on Yelp and they are usually easy to come by! So if you're in a pickle on a busy night, head here but really just go here regardless :).

I wasn't so happy about the egg noodles because they were really soggy, so if you order the duck soup please request for ho fun noodles! Duck was good and wasn't too fatty and goes well with the broth. The sea bass dish was all bad :( Fish was undercooked and the noodles were soggy. I told our waitress about it and she took the whole plate and gave me a puzzled stare like I'm being difficult or something. \n\nWell why would anyone want to eat undercooked fish that's still frozen from the freezer??! Instead of apologizing or asking to replace the dish with something else the waitress just snatched my food, bounced to the kitchen, and didn't utter a single word. Finally, she comes out and stares at me, and I politely ask if they could replace that dish with something else. She goes back to the register to talk to the manager I assume? Then flatly tells me \"NO.\" I was astounded and cordially explained that the dish hasn't been touched and the fish was undercooked and everything. Again she stared nonchalantly back at me and still said \"NO.\" I was annoyed as hell at this point already and we just stared back and forth at each other confused.

We were staying not too far from Tamarind Hall, and after hitting up a different cuisine each night (such is a luxury of a city like SF), we finally came to the Thai \"leg\" of our food adventure. \n\nWe came in pretty late, half an hour before they closed; but they still served us, and never made us felt rushed - which we appreciated. We ordered chicken satay skewers and lemon grilled chicken fried rice. Both are not spicy and pretty boring choices, I know; but understand that we ate there during the freak heat wave at the beginning of September, and with hardly any a/c anywhere, I don't think we would have enjoyed a good hot curry that night, even if we had tried. \n\nWe did, though, order the free lemon tea, courtesy of checking in to Yelp, so that was a nice bonus. Everything tasted very flavorful - I especially liked the skewers! The chicken fried rice, I found a little salty, but the chicken was pretty good (not dry or anything). For the record, my partner happily devoured everything with no complaints. \n\nStaff was friendly and food came pretty fast.\n\nOverall, a good experience. In a city with so many choices, I'm honestly glad we made this one!", "author": "Amy B."}

Talk about enhancing our eating experience and vibes man. \n\nBeyond the weed, this place had a great vibe and a decent array of Thai food and some nice wines, which they offer by the bottle. I went with the Salt-n-Pepa Calamari; this was a tad on the spicy side with jalapenos, light soy sauce, chili sauce, garlic, scallions, and ginger served with a sweet mint sauce. A superb way to start the meal especially if you're not familiar with Thai food. I'm not even really sure this is an authentic Thai dish. \n\nFor the main, I ordered the Pad Woon Sen with stir-fried glass noodles, chicken, cage-free egg, and celery. It was a pretty flavorless dish and needed a decent amount of sauces and spice just to get it going. I tried some of my buddies meal, the Prik King with pork, served with homemade chili jam and flat noodles. Prik King, besides having a great name, was probably my favorite dish of the night. I loved the chili jam and the flat noodle combo, and the pork added some salt which elevated the entire meal.\n\nOur group took up a good portion of the restaurant, and the seating felt pretty tight.

I was pleasantly surprised that it was an entirely different feel and menu from the thai restaurant that used to be in that location. We decided to try a variety of options (we were also hungry and couldn't make up our mind). \n\nWhat we ordered:\n- fresh rolls with shrimp: tasty veggies, great peanut sauce, rolls kind of fell apart as soon as you picked them up\n- crispy tofu: tofu had great texture, and once again came with a great sauce, but the tofu itself could have used some seasoning\n- tom kha gai: my favorite item by far; generous portion of chicken and a clean, tasty broth\n- pad kee mao with beef: fantastic noodles and a good helping of beef. Could have used a few more string beans\n- basil eggplant with tofu: my second favorite item that we ordered. The eggplant was perfectly cooked (soft but not mushy), tofu had a ton of flavor, and it came with rice (what a great deal!)\n-  side of sticky rice: because I love rice and eat it plain\n\nThe portions were on the smaller side, which is both a good and bad thing (good because then we don't eat too much, bad because there aren't any leftovers).

I'm only giving 2 ** because the food was actually good. If I had to order here, I would only be ordering take outs, given I had time to spare and will not go out of my way for this restaurant. I would recommend getting knockout wings if you love spicy food. It maybe categorized as a mediocre Thai place but not compared to OSHA, considering everything. We had to waive at waitress to get their attention to even pay. If you don't care for customer service and are okay with paying somewhat of an expensive bill, then this is the place for you.", "author": "Payal K."}

It was pretty slow in there so I wasn't sure how good it was really going to be but I was very pleasantly surprised with how great everything was. The Thai mango mojito was SO delicious :) and the pad Thai and fried chicken over chicken fried rice were both great. I've eaten a lot of pad Thai in my day and the pad Thai here was actually pretty fantastic.\nPrices are a little high at $11-13 avg a plate, but it is a pretty nice  bar/restaurant. Though When I came in it was pretty hot inside and it seemed like they really needed to run the ac or atleast some fans. \nThe food was great though so I highly recommend :)", "author": "Becca D."}

Ordered the Lao steak and it took 45 mins for them to make it. They asked how it want done but the steak was less than an inch so it was super done and then they lit it on fire so it didn't matter anyways.

I'm more used to smaller Thai establishments that are more traditional and a little old school. The vibe was pretty hip here - as all things SF and I like it! You can go for night out with your friends and still get some pretty decent food.\n\nMy top favorites were:\n1. The Knock Out Chicken Wings - SOOO GOOD, but if you can't handle spicy, heed my warning and do not order these. There is so much flavors in these, you can taste it even when your tongue is on FIYAH. 10/10 would order again.\n2. Roti / Curry - the curry sauce that came with the roti is bomb.com which translates to bomb.com curry entree. Enjoyed it so much we ordered a second serving of the roti - nommy!\n   *Although, we took the curry togo and the next day when I microwaved it, the consistency turned into a thick rubbery dough... Not really sure what happened there, but it did not look stomach friendly. Needless to say, we threw it away.\n3. Salmon carpaccio - friends really enjoyed it, I thought it was a little on the salty side.\n\nThings I wouldn't order again:\n1. The two noodle dishes we got. Pad Thai and PadSeeEw, both were mediocre and not worth your carb calories for the day. Skip and try something else. These were disappointing.\n\nI also got the Siamese .. something, I kept saying Siamese Twin to the waitress because that's all that would come to mind..

We felt a bit rushed and weren't really checked on besides when we got what we ordered. The waitress did let us know when last call for food was though! Which was nice because that didn't anyways happen. Friday night the kitchen seemed to close around 12, but I don't remember the exact time. The full menu was available until then. \n\nFood was satisfying... Better green curry than usual places. Comes with an egg, noodles, and veggies. Good quality ingredients. Curry was pretty brothy/thin, styles wise. What I liked was the chicken wasn't that semi-mushy/chewy chicken pieces that are cheap quality. You get a lot of food with this dish! It was very good; I'd get it again. I got a side of jasmine rice with it, which I think I preferred to the noodles. It was her particularly aromatic of anything, but the noodles were a bit mushy for my taste. \n\nThe appetizer, chicken satay, was pretty good. Came out luke warm which was kind of weird because it wasn't busy at all. 5 small skewers of chicken with a flavorful peanut sauce and some cucumber bits. I was expecting bigger pieces for $11 but it wasn't too offensive. Husband got the Prik King with chicken. He said he expected it to be spicier but said it was pretty good. Satisfying but now like, wow-ing. He ordered a side of the peanut sauce for it which seemed to help for him. \n\nThai tea was pretty good but possibly too sweet for some. I almost asked for more tea for it, but it wasn't quite enough for me to bother. \n\nThe dining space is small/medium, but it's not too crammed, and not loud despite a bar and sports on TVs. \n\nI enjoyed my curry more than husband liked his Prik King, but I'd go back. =)", "author": "Kat B."}

On the one hand, they're still just taro fries.  On the other hand, they're the best taro fries I've had.\n\nThe salmon curry was also great: really vibrant curry flavor without being too heavy.  The staff mentioned they grind the curry spices every morning.\n\nThe pineapple and coconut sorbettos were a perfect way to end the meal.  They weren't too sweet and were light enough to refresh without bogging you down.\n\nThe presentation of each dish was also beautiful.  A few of them also came with orchid garnishes, and the sorbettos were served in the frozen shells of the fruits themselves.\n\nI am going back and bringing friends.\n\nThese guys need to start a second location or sell their food at stores.  The only bad part of the experience is that parking around the restaurant is tough.", "author": "David L."}

Instead of vegan rice, they served rice with egg. At first i was sceptical but thought it May be tofu but At first bite I realised the taste is quite different than tofu. When I asked the chef about whether it is an egg, she changed my dish without telling sorry or explaining or confirming that there is an egg.

They were perfect for the hot spicy and delicious food to come. \n\nWe got a roti and curry, which was served with both green and red curry for dipping, and this was awesome. Some of the best we've had. Then we got the grilled eggplant appetizer which was really tasty, it was a very unique flavor and had an interesting tangy sauce with it. \n\nFor mains we got the khao soi, which was incredible. We've been chasing the dream of khao soi ever since visiting chiang mai 3 years ago, and these guys delivered. It was sweet, spicy, soupy and crispy all at the same time - yum! We also got a pad kee mao, which was okay not great, it just paled in comparison to the delicious khao soi. \n\nI will definitely be back here to try out more delicious northern thai foods.", "author": "Deepak R."}

The owners and staff are Thai, and the Thai hospitality and culture shine through the entire experience. I have been twice, and have relied primarily on recommendations of our servers to pick out favorites. Even when we went with a group with pretty diverse tastes (a few hungry boys and a vegetarian), they picked a nice variety of choices for us all to share, explained what everything was and took care to tell us what was spicy and what had meat. We ended up with great food that came out in a nice cadence (not all dropped on the table at once) with something for everyone. Also the space is completely renovated from the old King of Thai and it looks fantastic with very cool art. Definitely a whole new experience and new ownership. \n\nOn the menu, favorites are Laap Gai (which my boyfriend tries to make at home now we loved it so much) and the Roti Gaeng Neur (both with beef and tofu), which was warm and spicy. I'm not normally a big fan of curry but this was stellar. The Somtum Gai Yang was another favorite on the lighter side - spicy and very fresh. The eggplant salad was a vegetarian special that's definitely worth trying too - it uses the eggplant as a base for a bunch of seasonings and flavors that really shine. Can't wait to go back and try more!", "author": "Alexandra M."}

Normally I don't like being able to feel the cold air gust in every time the door is opened but it was so warm in the restaurant I actually looked forward to anyone opening the front door! I think they should maybe turn on the AC when they are packed, all the body heat really makes it uncomfortable to sit there through a meal.\nNow for the food, I ordered their vegetable pad Thai and Panang curry. The pad Thai was decent, the noodles were a little thinner than I'm used to but the flavor was still there. Their Panang curry was delicious though! It was very flavorful and they include a side of rice with the dish.\nThe best thing about this restaurant is definitely their screaming Thai ice tea! It has a splash of vodka in it and tasted DELICIOUS! I would have never thought of making Thai tea an alcoholic beverage but it really goes well together. \nThe reason for four stars is because the service was a bit slow. I understand they were busy on the night I visited but I feel like the waiters could have checked up on our table a little more often. I had to stop a lady and ask her for the check.

Don't be that lame white person who orders pad thai. Instead get the Khao Soi. It's an incredible dish, and this specifically is the best Khao Soi I've had in the US. A little spicy but you will be rewarded for your courage.\n\nThey have a vegetarian Khao Soi option too which I might like more than the chicken version. I order veg : chicken in a 60 : 40 ratio. In general this place is very friendly to the veggie life.\n\nEverything else I've tried has also been high yield, except the duck soup which was just okay. It's probably good compared to most duck soups, just tasted bland when compared side-by-side with the Khao Soi and other elite spicy dishes\n\nThis place has a very positive energy as well. Great for watching sporting events as there are TVs you can see from almost any seat. The cocktails are creative and I enjoyed the beer choices as well\n\nAgain, the Khao Soi is so legit. In fact, I've set many of my online avatars to an image of the Khao Soi from here. Recently I've started opening conversations on Tinder by asking if they've heard of Khao Soi.

We are so glad we did!  They were so welcoming and friendly.  Best of all, everything we tried here was based on their recommendations and everything was great!  We sat at the bar given there was only two of us. This super helpful bartender 'Mindy' helped us pick and try the best things on the menu. Starting with drinks, they had a nice variety of beer, wines, and adults beverages - all of which were very good.  For appetizers, Mindy suggested trying the 'Curry-Osity' as a curry sampler and home made Thai Bread - soo soooo good.  Great start and recommendation.  Then for our entrees, we ordered Phuket-styled Crab Meat Khanom Jeen and Salmon Yellow Curry.   Ok - just to note - NEITHER OF US HAVE EVER HAD CURRY!.   These entrees were incredible and a great intro to Curry.  Mindy shared that the Phuket style Jeen was not something easy to get in the states and was very good - So right, as it was so good. Great blend of noodles, flavor, and crab flavor.  Mindy also mixed it for me to show how to properly eat it.  So great! The Salmon Curry was also very good and perfect for a intro into the curry world. Service was so good and friendly.  We observed many families stopping in, locals, and other visitors.

I've had the eggplant, pumpkin curry (twice) Tom yum (vegetarian) soup bowl, and a few other things. If it says it's spicy, and you order it mild it will still be verrry spicy. I can handle a moderate amount of heat, but the mild is almost to spicy for me. They also drown it in sauce. I'm a saucy girl, I can never have to much. But when your curry is literally a soup, that's going overboard. Luckily I always get take out and can leave half the sauce in the container so I don't drown my rice. It's always a bit too salty for me. Only reason I ever go back is because it's only two blocks from my house and they have some vegan friendly options. Would not recommend unless as a last resort.", "author": "Abigail L."}

Again the food was not the problem. I had my 2, 4 year olds my 8 year old, mother husband and myself. I ordered the 20 priece chicken wings for my 3 children split. They did not come out till myself and other adults were almost finished with our food(I was even feeding my kids off my plate till it came, not an issue I will always my children first) but they could have told me it would be that long. Then when I got my bill they added a 26.78 gratuity for a party of 6!  How do you even justify making all the kids wait till everyone else was finished to bring their food, and then count 3 entrees as a party of 6. Ridiculous I really feel like I was just scammed out of 30$ for my kids to not eat and just take up 3 extra chairs. I will also add the restaraunt was completely dead it was after lunch rush and only 2 other people in. So for 1 appetizer 3 entrees and 2 sodas the bill was 187.34 the whole 26.78 gratuity was almost double any entree cost on the menu. Not cool or ok and will never go back because of desperate need of 30$ to allow children to take up 3 chairs in an empty restaraunt and not even get their food .", "author": "Eleyana H."}

The 'to-go' presentation was off, portions of the sticky rice were uncooked and very hard to break up and incorporate into my meal (impossible to eat with a fork alone, had to use my hands). Papaya salad was good, inconsistently spicy.\n\nUnfortunately Tamarind Hall doesn't have any dishes that pop's off the menu.

High quality food, generous portions ( the serving plates themselves could be a bit smaller though) nice wait staff in a fairly spacious setting. We came in around 8 and were seated easily. The menu is not huge but plenty to satisfy wants. They have bat in the back and  a good list of bar bites noodles  and salads ,which for some would be enough. A selection of soups and  tasty mains. We got 5 dishes for 4 people Basil Eggplant ,massaman curry ( this could have been a little tangier), roasted chicken leg with multiple spices, The standout for me was  Roti Gaeng Neur -Prime rib eye steak in  curry, coconut milk, thai eggplant and basil leaves served with crispy roti flat bread.Of course pad thai, did not feel the peanuts as much but the flavor was all there. We were told their new chef is from Lers Ros , which might explain the consistent high level of preparation. 3 areas I'd improve 1) is noise reduction, it gets excruciatingly loud  either from their (annoying blase)  music or other diners. It's a real problem. 2) The decor has no sense of style or character, they could easily fix that. Lastly, the plates for serving are huge and the small plates for eating are like coffee saucers, which makes for a very awkward situation trying to eat with 4 people at a table. Go for the food, and hope it's not too crowded or you wont hear your self think.", "author": "Aaron Z."}

I had dinner at Tamarind Hall last night and the phrase, \"lipstick on a pig\" comes to mind.  \nWhile the fresh coat of paint and updated bar are a nice upgrade, everything else has gone downhill.  The drink are no longer cheap, rather they are slightly more expensive than other options in the neighborhood. The service is poor, and despite the place being mostly empty our food took forever.\nWhen we get to the food is where the one star review kicks in.  Or soup was luke warm and the noodles not cooked properly.  The broth was weak and had a musty and the chicken flavorless.  Flavorful authentic Thai food this was not.  More of a gross halfhearted attempt at Asian like soup.   My salmon curry was terrible.  The fish was dry and very over cooked.  The curry sauce was strange and quickly separated into oil and something strange.  It was hard to eat.  \nBottom line is that there is no reason to go here.  If you are looking for Thai food, pretty much anything else in the area is much better and cheaper.  If you are looking for a bar, there are many other better options in the neighborhood.  The new owners have taken something mediocre and made it awful.", "author": "Derek n."}

The new 'owners' have their thumbs in literally EVERYTHING which is not a good thing.. \nKing Of Thai was a great place. The food and drinks were good and prices were great. \nWith this new version of Thai in the same location the food is bland and a bit too pricey for what I think they're trying to convey to the crowd they want to cater to.\n \nThe new owners have pushed out the neighborhood regulars in an effort to cater to a less than 'diverse' crowd. I've seen the owner intentionally pick arguments with some of the old regulars (who I know for a fact welcomed her with open arms), get rid of the happy hour & raise drink prices several times in an effort to get them to move on. I've talked to a great many of the old King Of Thai regulars from the neighborhood and almost all of them have said they don't feel welcome and will not go back to Tamarind Hall...\nIn all honesty, I highly recommend finding a Thai restaurant withh tastier food and is more down to earth..\n This place now SUCKS.", "author": "Jane D."}

For appetizers, we tried the Yam Makua Yao, and Yum Kai Dao, both of which were full of flavor, and nothing like I've ever tried before. The duck eggs in both of the dishes were fantastic. For the main course, I tried the Massaman curry with beef, which was classically delicious and satisfying. My boyfriend got the Basil Eggplant dish, which was AMAZING! Seriously, you should try this. The normally humble eggplant was so full of flavor in this dish. I am getting this next time, which will be soon.

So I would like to start the review off saying that the food was phenomenal, the service used to be great. I tried everything on the menu from the curry to the more traditional kha soi, all were great. \n\nHowever, this review is for when I visited Tamarind Hall again with a group of friends on Saturday night last week. We had a spot at the bar and it was crowded. The bartenders (not the owner who is so sweet) did not acknowledge us for ~20 mins. When one of us finally got their attention and asked for drinks and water, they did not bring us water for the next 30 mins. In total, between all of us, we asked the bartender for water at least 3 times. Each time, she would glare at us. This is on top of my drink order taking 30 mins. I watched as they served other people and even had time to file glasses in the back between the 2 bartenders. I think the service was just abhorrent. In addition, I asked the host if he would tell us when one of the larger tables left, so we could sit down. Instead, we left to find all of the tables completely empty and cleaned and no one let us know. I felt compelled to write this review so that the owner would know and make sure this doesn't happen to other customers.", "author": "A B."}
