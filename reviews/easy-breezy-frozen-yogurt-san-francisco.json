Easy Breezy offers bold flavors that come in a variety of dairy and non-dairy options -- including low-fat, full fat (omg ew), coconut milk and cashew milk -- so there's always something for everyone. With that being said, however, I wish they had more flavors.

Not sure if the price has been jumping up a lot since they opened, but now when you get roughly a cup of yogurt (small size) with maybe 1/3 cup of toppings, it adds up to well over $5.00 a serving; which seems much higher than when we started going there years ago. \n\nWhile it is possible that this is the going rate for frozen desserts out at a shop, what we realized is for this price you can go get gourmet frozen desserts at the grocery store for half that price per ounce or go to Super Duper for the best organic soft serve I've ever had!\n\nWe like the shop, their posted commitment to treating their employees well, organic, high quality products and such, and want to support local businesses, it's just more than we can justify paying for dessert.

The inside boasts a large seating area, but the actual frozen yogurt dispensary and toppings area is a bit awkward.  The toppings are featured right next to the cash register, and on a table which rests on a weirdly located column in the middle of no where.  The line is confusing because in order to get toppings located on the table where the column is, you pretty much have to get out of line.  Then, once you're done getting all the toppings, do you simply go to the back of the line?  It is chaotic, to say the least.  \n\nThen there is the issue of the toppings located right next to the register.  People are naturally indecisive and may take a long time choosing which toppings they want with their flavors.  Having the toppings right next to the register slows down the line.  \n\nThey offer shots of water by the seating area if you're thirsty.  Be prepared to take about 5 shots of water though, because the cups are small.  \n\nIn conclusion, they have some great flavors.  They also offer \"organic\" fruit as toppings which explains why they are able to charge higher than other \"non-organic\" froyo places.  The waffle is a must try.", "author": "Victor L."}

She took her time adding spoons to the different containers - she obviously didn't look happy to be at work. Then at 12:06 she let me in the store. I asked to try most of the flavors (no one else was there and it was my first time). She looked very annoyed and then went quickly putting together the samples. I had my hands full of samples and then she held out the next sample and looked annoyed I couldn't hold yet another sample. I don't understand why she couldn't just place the samples on the table.

It was difficult to surprise her since we circled the neighborhood several times in order to find parking. Good thing she doesn't know Noe Valley very well, or else she might've guessed where we were heading.\n\nThey had two non-dairy flavors to choose from. They aren't labeled \"Vegan\" on the machines, but I had checked enough beforehand to ensure that they are indeed Vegan. They have an almond or coconut milk base which is different from your usual soy. Good thing I checked online before heading here since the customer service was nonexistent. I know that Noe Valley is filled with pretentious yuppies, but it was the most unfriendly experience in a froyo shop that I could imagine. I think the only word that the guy at the register uttered was the cost of our bowl. Which, was actually quite reasonable since it's per ounce. I was expecting to pay much more.\n\nWe tried the mint flavor, which was okay. Kinda bland and not too creamy. It could've been the almondmilk base, which left it watery. There was also a lack of mint flavor which you can't blame on being Vegan. \n\nThe Cake Batter however was the stuff of wet dreams. It utilized coconut milk to much better effect. I used to love me some Coldstone cake batter ice cream, back in the day. It was probably my favorite ice cream before I realized that cow's milk is for cows. This rendition of cake batter wasn't quite up there in creaminess, but it's damn good! I would say it's the best froyo in SF. Yogurt Farms in Santa Rosa might be better, but that's a helluva drive.\n\nThey rotate flavors often it appears. Whatever is on the menu, the coconut based version is the way to go. Not sure why on our visit the two Vegan flavors weren't on the same machine. This would allow you to do the swirly with the center handle that mixes the two. Only makes sense to me. \n\nThey had some gourmet looking sauces and toppings, but due to the aforementioned lack of service, we went with some standard fruit toppings. We didn't want to bother the gruff gentleman at the counter with any more questions. A great choice as it allowed us to savor all the cake batter goodness.

It tastes like a high quality McDonald's I've cream cone with a richer texture and better mouth feel.

The custard is there though!) \n\n-classic tart: slightly sour, but still very rich. It doesn't taste like a non fat yogurt, but still doesn't stand out as amazing. If you're a fan of original tart at other places, got won't be disappointed \n\n-non-dairy basil: I was a little hesitant to try this in the beginning. I quickly jumped on it though (how often  do we run into basil yogurt?). The basic is incredibly strong, in a good way. If you love basil, you will love this flavor. If you don't, you may still like it as it does have the other delicious elements of yogurt (cold mouthfeel, sweetness, and tangy finish) \n\n-vanilla bean: this is the non fat version of the vanilla custard. If you're watching your calories and fat intake and want a nice vanilla yogurt, this is a good choice. It's not my go to though as the custard is so good! This one tastes a lot like the coffee beans vanilla bean beverage. \n\n-non-dairy chai spice: the chai flavor is definitely there but I was expecting a bit more from this one.

There is often only one person working and since they have to get you the sample, you have to wait for him/her to be free to get a sample. The guy working there today must've been in a bad mood because I saw him snap at a customer saying that he has to ring everyone up first; therefore, he has to wait since he has to be the one to get the sample for him. \n- mushy sloshy fro-yo. I like mine more frozen. Theirs is often too soft and melts super fast. \n- uh, expensive? My barely half-full regular froyo and a kid size (again barely) half-full froyo came out to be $16. Many people being rung up were at $24, so I just paid it and didn't question it, but couldn't help wonder why the heck was it so expensive?! I used to go to Nubi Yogurt on 16th and Bryant and packed the entire cup with yogurt and fruit, and it was never this much. \n\nSo I called around a bit to find out what other places charge: \n- Nubi: $0.39 per oz\n- place b: (I'll fill in the names later) $0.43 per oz\n- place c: $0.49 per oz\n- place d: $0.53 per oz\n- This place, Easy Breeze whatever: $0.61 per oz\n\nNo wonder, they add up.  There aren't any other yogurt places around in the neighborhood, so I guess they can charge an arm and a leg and still get a lot of customers. I will definitely think twice before coming here next time though.  Something about a $16 half-full froyo just doesn't sound right.  Let's say mine was $10 since we had the small kid's size too.

It isn't great, either. But it's fairly good and it's open late and there's a lot to be said for that.\n\nWhen you walk in you'll notice that it's warm. It doesn't really matter what the temperature is outside, but the heat from the machines definitely keeps this place at just-below-sauna levels at all points of the year. They have five or six flavors with a blackboard wall above each where the flavor is written. Quite advanced, I know.\n\nThe staff is nice, but often the froyo comes out too liquidy because of the aforementioned heat. Toppings are plentiful and it's the standard weigh-and-pay that you'd get at any other froyo place.\n\nBonus points for being open late most nights, but they suffer from a lack of flavor options (tart, vanilla and chocolate were three of the flavors on one of the nights I was there and when you're going up against Yoppi and places like that with Oreo and Cheesecake and Sparkling Unicorn, or as it's known Cake Batter, you've got to up your flavor game) and the flavors not really matching their ice cream counterparts.\n\nDefinitely worth stopping in if you're walking by, but not worth making a long trip.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-19", "description": "Being vegan and loving my desserts, as soon as I heard that Easy Breezy always offers one vegan flavor I went over there today to try it out.\n\nSince it was my first time I was a little lost when I walked in. It's all self serve, which I didn't know before going. The flavors are written on a chalkboard above each self-serve machine; and the vegan flavor isn't actually labeled \"vegan\" but \"non-dairy\". \n\nOnce I got that figured out I started checking out the toppings. Around the pole in the middle are toppings like crushed potato chips, Fruity Pebbles, and Oreo crumbles. Not really my thing, even if some of them are technically vegan.\n\nTo the left of the cash register are the sauces, and the hot peanut butter sauce is vegan. And delicious. If there weren't employees around I would be tempted to just put my face under it and squirt it into my open mouth. To the right of the cash register are the fancier toppings like blueberries, cut strawberries. and mochi bits (which are vegan and delicious. They checked the ingredient list for me to make sure, and I totally appreciated that).\n\nOnce you've got your strategy planned you choose a cup from three different sizes. I chose the smallest one just in case since it was my first time to make sure I liked it. I wasn't sure what to do at the dispenser machine under the vegan flavor, so I put the cup underneath it and tried pulling the handle down but it wouldn't move. I thought maybe it was locked so I tried the next handle over, but that was for a \"swirl\" of two flavors, one of which wasn't vegan.\n\nFortunately the two employees were watching me do this (and probably enjoying seeing a clueless customer trying to get at their product with slapstick results), and they told me that the handle I was pulling wasn't entirely vegan. I offered to pay for the fro yo I had put in the cup with the wrong handle, but they said don't worry about it and took it in back and said to try the vegan handle again. This time I got it to work (note to self: start doing arm curls at the gym...), and once the fro yo was in the cup I added the peanut butter sauce, some strawberries, and some mochi bits and put it on the scale.\n\nIt was $6 for my cup, which was actually less than I thought it was going to be. Even though it was the smallest cup size I think that's a really fair price for what I got. People who are complaining on here that it's expensive should just stick to $2 tubs of corn syrup and sugar \"ice cream\" from the store. And not get so much.\n\nThe trash receptacles I saw in the shop were all for composting, which is good because the cups, spoons, and napkins are all compostable (as is any food residue of course). The shop was clean and simple with windows onto 24th for people watching.\n\nI was a little hesitant to go here and almost decided to go to the Irving location instead. I'm a kid kicker, and there tend to be a lot of kids around Noe Valley. But there was a family with two kids when I got there who weren't too out of control or annoying. Right before I left a family with two kids did come in, and the dad parked the ridiculously oversized SUV stroller along one bench and they proceeded to take up two tables; but it seemed like there was enough seating for people and the turnover is fast enough where no one had to stand.\n\nThe two people working there were both really nice and helpful, especially since I felt like a mouthbreather when I first walked in because I wasn't sure how it worked. They helped me along each step of the way, and were on top of my dietary restrictions (vegan) the whole time, which was appreciated. They were offering samples to quite a few people who came in after I got my fro yo and sat down, so they definitely aim to please here and it's nice to see people being proactive and not just phoning it in and standing around talking to each other and filing their nails while you're trying to get the food in your face.\n\nI could see going here regularly. It was a good hike over the hill from the Castro, and the cup I ate didn't feel like it was heavy in my stomach on the walk back home. Oh, the vegan flavor today was cherry marzipan. It tasted like cherry soft serve fro yo, not overly sweet, and the consistency was just right.

Today I got less yogurt than usual and it cost more money - I looked at the wall and they are now charging 71 cents per ounce!!!

Their toppings are done in a small space, so take a good look. They have multiple types of syrups -- marshmellow fluff, peanut butter, chocolate and a bunch of dry ingredients.

When I found out about Easy Breezy, I knew that I had to pay it a visit. Brand new frozen yogurt place, located in Noe Valley, and they're eco-friendly. I'm sure that most food businesses are into the whole earth-friendly approach. That's just another plus! The decor is absolutely adorable. From the nature inspired chairs, benches, and even their walls. It's very kid-friendly.  Unlike all of the other frozen yogurt places around the city, which have a very modern feel to them. It's definitely the place to go to on lazy Sunday afternoons. \n\nAs for the frozen yogurt. I should start out by saying that the texture is VERY creamy. It's almost like eating soft serve ice cream. But healthier! Some of their flavors are organic and non-fat. They have a good variety of flavors. My boyfriend and I tried their Cake Batter and Vanilla Bean. We also tried a sample size of their Chai flavored yogurt. The texture was like I said earlier, creamy. But i'm not much of a chai tea lover, so that flavor didn't really win my interest. Cake batter tasted OK. I didn't expect much from it though. My favorite as of now would be Vanilla Bean. I love anything that's vanilla flavored. Vanilla over Chocolate!  It was JAM PACKED with vanilla bean flavor. Very poignant flavor. And not bland at all. Creamy frozen yogurt + jam packed vanilla bean flavor = AMAZINGGGGG!  \n\nI'm definitely coming back here to try their other flavors. As for the price, I can't quite remember how much they charge, but I paid a total of $6 for a good amount of froyo. It's a bit pricier than other places, but it's definitely worth it.", "author": "Nataly T."}

I did not try the peach or the plain \"tart\" flavors.\n\nWhy 4 stars, you might ask, given my lukewarm review of the froyo. Well I will tell you - two reasons: custard and topping selection. The custard, which comes in the same type of dispenser as the yogurt, and which is advertised as full fat -was truly DELICIOUS! The topping selection was diverse, everything looked delicious, and the cookie dough topping were these plump, robust moist chunks of chocolate chip cookie dough. Tasty.

I tried the original tart fro-yo and the frozen custard soft-serve which was a chocolate flavored one and I thought they both tasted absolutely wonderful:-)  I think this is one of the few places out there that I know of that has self-serve frozen custard available - most places that have this don't offer it so that it's actually self-serve.  They have a wide assortment of toppings that you can choose from - everything from your normal sprinkles, bursting boba, mochi, peanut butter cups, fudge sauce, fresh fruit, crushed potato chips and more!   \n\nI love how they use a lot of wood for their benches and tables, which creates for a cool, natural and inviting vibe.  They also have a water dispenser near the door, in case you forgot to bring your own water.  Though it's not really the most convenient place for me to get to, nor is it the cheapest self-serve fro-yo place around, I'd certainly pick this place over others due to the overall taste & quality of their fro-yo + frozen custard and also the fact that it's not chaotic inside (well at least when I went, it wasn't) and since it is self-serve, by the time you get to eat your fro-yo, it's not going to be half-melted.

Ah, well. Given exactly how divine it is, I think the proximity to my apartment  is going to be a bit problematic, as I've been there practically daily since it opened (it's that good).\n\nThe outstanding flavors, for me, were: Chocolate Custard (and I don't even LIKE chocolate that much); Raspberry (which tastes like real, tart raspberries -- not like what you would expect); and Cake Batter (which, unlike the overly saccharine flavor that cake batter yogurt can sometimes have -- this tastes like actual cake batter). \n\nThis yogurt is so good, I have yet to taint it with toppings (nothing against them, though -- they look amazing, too). \n\nAs a random side note, I love the mascot (and the cute merch) -- the tote bags are really generous (thank you!), and the tattoos are a really cute idea for kids.

It tastes like a rich and wonderful cheesecake.The have non dairy options which are great for those with such dietary restrictions. Some of these have been cucumber, grapefruit, nutter butter. I cannot comment on toppings as I do not eat them. There does seem to be a good variety including ones for all age groups. There are the sweet candy type and then the nuts and doughs. One of my favorite things are two of the people that work there. Bailey is just joyous and smiles all the time. One thing really special about her is she really loves the product.

Not a huge selection of flavors but I never get anything but original tart, so that matters not. I like the texture and taste of the yogurt. I'm not a froyo connoisseur, but this tastes like all the other good quality franchise (Menchies, Yogurtland, etc) and I'm satisfied with it.  Great selection of toppings with all ur usual nuts and candies and fruits and a bit more --- I'll have to give bacon bits a try next time!", "author": "Elizabeth T."}

Who knew?)\n\nTrue, it's a bit pricey, but we're talking prime 24th st. location and a clean attractive place staffed by friendly people serving Strauss organic yogurt.

The lines for the register and the lines to the yogurt machines sort of fuse together making things very confusing. There were no spoons or small tasting cups accessible, had to duck around a bunch of people to ask the register guy for some. He instead came around and served me my tastes...whatever.\n\nSitting in the window eating my yogurt, however, made me very happy.\n\nI'll go back for the yogurt but they have to figure out how to make the place flow a little better!", "author": "Latte Queen W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-27", "description": "Fabulous taste. I find it a little on the outrageous side to pay $10.23 for 15.05 oz of yogurt which is less volume than a pint (16oz) of, The Latest Scoop brand Gelato made in Berkeley Ca, which is a top notch ice cream sold for $6.99 in the stores, which is close to half the price at .44/oz and Cold Stone at .48/oz.  I'm all for paying for quality and yes you get what you pay for but this has gone too far. In addition, they didn't have the small kids size cup, which was part of the problem, so you are naturally going to spend more filling up the next bigger size, hard as you may try to not fill it up. Again, amazing taste, great job, but I find this little store on the monopolizing side of the house. Perfect location where persons may be fooled that yogurt should cost this much. Like hell it should. Hey Breezy, how about competing with Cold Stone and Latest Scoop, don't get greedy asking 25% more just because it's yogurt and a notch healthier. Dave M.", "author": "Dave M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-09-03", "description": "Everyone is praising Easy Breezy, but are they blind to the worst user experience in Froyo history?  Let's start with the way the machines shoot out froyo like lava.  Part of the self-service experience is being able to control the way the froyo coils in your cup AND to control how much froyo you are buying.  Before I knew it, I had over 9 dollars of froyo in my cup.  9 dollars!!  That's problem number 1.  Next we have the caroseul of toppings.  These toppings also launch at a rapid pace giving you little control over the volume you are building in your cup.  And there are three toppings stations.  One by the checkout counter, which is logical.  The second is squished next to the checkout corner and the row of froyo machines and the third is past the checkout counter.  If there are more than three people in the place, it's pretty cumbersome to navigate this obstacle course.  There's absolutely no logical flow.  Have the owners never seen a Yogurtland or a Menchi's?  It's not rocket science.  Dedicate space for yogurt next to a dedicated space for toppings which then leads you to the checkout counter.  The price per ounce is about 50 cents or more, which is high for froyo.  I'll say that they have interesting flavors and actual hot fudge and some cool toppings, but the UX is so poor that I'd almost rather go without froyo at all.  Everything is set up for you to wait longer than you need to and pay more than you would want.  It should really be called Easy Breezy Pay Us All Your Cash.", "author": "Jeremy G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-08", "description": "I watched with interest as the Easy Breezy was built and opened near my house, especially when I found out they use local strauss organic yogurt and organic toppings. Still, I'm not a huge froyo person so although I'd walk by and think, oh that looks good, I was never in the mood to try them. Till the heat wave. I love hot weather! And last Monday, it was HOT! Even after the sun sets, which is so rare here in SF! Thinking of childhood memories of going for ice cream on hot summer nights in new England, I decided this was the time to try it. I saw they had raspberry tart, yum. I walked in, it's very small, three machines with two flavors each, four basic flavors and two special rotating flavors, a bunch of tables and chairs up the front, and some tucked in corners toppings. One machine with chocolate and something was blocked off. Odd. The family in front of me went over to get some raspberry tart yogurt. But the employee rushed over and said that due to the heat, the machine had broken down, and that's what happened to the other one too. Ironic that something that would be good to beat the beat got beaten itself. Only one machine was working, plain tart, and plain custard. The kids in front of me got all upset and their parents took them to find ice cream instead. I thought about leaving but then decided to try these plain flavors. I got mainly tart, with a bit of custard (which is not frozen  yogurt or fat free the sign says) on top. With little flavor in my ice cream, I picked some toppings that would give me the most flavor - organic fruit and lychee boba. Mixed in, I got fruit yogurt, except that then it kind of  muddled between the custard and the tart. I took as much as I wanted without worrying about the price, and it only cost $4.50. It was good! Not too sweet at all, which I liked. I didn't feel a sugar rush. I enjoy plain yogurt anyway (usually with fruit or as a topping) so someone who doesn't may not like it. I would love to come back when they have actual flavors and try those, or maybe the chocolate sauce. I've seen yummy flavors like lemon or acai advertised. Plus, although this place is popular and there's always people outside eating their frozen yogurt, you don't have to put up with long lines like you do at the ice cream places that are closest to us. Those ice creams are probably a little bit tastier, but not always worth waiting an hour, and this place is tasty too, and way more healthy!", "author": "Merredith L."}

(this has happened to me the two times i have been here, and it's been a bummer because they have some good-looking toppings like brownie bits and various fruits near the register.) i also wish they offered little tasting cups at each yogurt stand so you could try a flavor by yourself, as there isn't always an employee available to give you a sample. also! i just read that they give out punch cards! i did not see any there. rats. solid 4 stars -- with a few improvements, they'd be a 5.", "author": "m r."}
