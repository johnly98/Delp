Some decent tunes filled the room, but the drunken band of idiots occupying half the establishment took away from some of the entertainment value. I'd forgotten, in a city where last call takes its final breath at 1:30am, the populous needs to get their drink on EARLY. So expect to find stumbling fools aplenty at 10pm. \n\nI would potentially return, if only to see if they could fulfill their broken promise.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-10-23", "description": "Here's a review of the place from the perspective of someone who has played a number of shows here over the years:\n\nPros:\n-Floor layout:  The area in front of the stage is relative small, so that helps make it seem like the place is packed with people and also makes everything that much louder.  The bar is off to the side, so that makes it easier for people not there for the band to stay away, and I'm sure it's nice for the bartenders who will have an easier time hearing drink orders.  Oh, another big bonus... no need to haul your gear up a huge flight of stairs because everything is on one level.\n-Foot traffic:  It's North Beach and there are always people walking around in the area, so chances are you'll be playing in front of more than just your gf/bf and perpetually single friend who's got nothing else better to do on a weekday/night.  \n-Other stuff:  TWO Ceiling mounted fans pointing at the stage!!!  Given the tiny ass stage this makes a HUGE difference.  In the past, it would feel like a freaking sauna on stage.  Bar staff/bouncer dudes have always been respectful and A-OK to me.  Oh, and no cover charge, so there's no excuse for your cheapass friends to come out to see your awesome band. \n\nCons:\n-Stage:  it's tiny, and if you're anything more than a 3 piece, you better make sure everyone in the band loaded up on deodorant.  Consider backlining with other bands as much as possible, otherwise prepare to setup your gear FIFO, not LIFO (you know, because the stage isn't deep enough for more than just one band's stuff).  \n-Sound:  No monitors (as of Oct 20, 2012), soundcheck, or sound guy.  Note to whoever in the band stands closest to stage right:  the mixer is in front of you so you'll likely be your band's sound guy.  Expect everything to sound like shit from the stage.  \n-Parking:  is pretty much impossible on the street... a number of hourly/fixed rate lots are nearby if you're low on parking karma\n-Other stuff:  No separate access for loading in/out means you have to wade your way through the crowd to make it to the front door.  No green room (but you probably knew that if you're playing here).", "author": "Steve L."}

Had some pizza at Golden Boy, walked around with some buddies to hand out some handbills to promote the show in the neighborhood and eventually got back to the venue. \n\nThe music was supposed to start at 8 to 8:15 but the manager was telling them they couldn't start yet. It was 8:30 by the time I got there. They were supposed to wait for a hand wave or something from the guy in charge who was merrily playing beer pong and drinking. \n\nAt about 8:45, after having several people ask him when the band would start came over and said that the concert is definitely not happening and the shuffling iPod DJ would continue. Everyone who came out to see the band was sort of awe-struck. \n\nHow many times has anyone seen a band be able to fully set up, sound check and be totally ready to go, with 20some people there to see them - and more on the way...... and then be told they can't play because: it would disrupt the cliquey beer pong tournament that had a whole 10 or so people playing in it.\n\nWe decided the best thing toi do was to clear out and left the place almost completely empty in the bar area with that dozen of people hanging around the beer pong tables.\n\nI know one friend was asking for her money back for her beer, I hope she got it. Sure, the band got paid their $50, but that's not worth the price of them and their fans that came out getting jerked around.\n\nThis was a fiasco in management at the Grant and Green. I'm avoiding that place like the plague - there's always Mojito next door, where they value live music.\n\nIf you're a beers-willing 35 year old frat boy wanna be who want to relive the beer pong days, yay, by all means, but i can't get over how badly this was all handled by this guy. \n\nMaybe other days there are better... I just can't get over this.\n\nSorry about venting.\n\nbut... seriously?", "author": "volker n."}

That said, this one does.\n\nMy introduction to Grant and Green was during the North Beach Festival, where thousands of people (most of whom wish they were still in college) relish the opportunity to drink during the daytime and still adhere to socially acceptable standards. These people wake up thinking, \"Today, I am going to PUNISH my liver. And it is going to be the tits, because everyone else is a-floatin' in the same boat!\" Clearly, these are my brethren. \n\nSo I'm with my girls, and we're bar hopping, making our way over to the beer gardens, when we come upon this divey looking place with a sign that says, \"NORTH BEACH FESTIVAL SPECIAL: JACK DANIELS SHOTS\" and I'm like, \"Ladies... pit stop.\" I make quick friends with Ben the doorman, who's impressed with my ability to slam the whiskey like its the Sweet Nectar of Life and therefore does not charge me.\nWe move onto the beer gardens, followed by the concert in the park (Unauthorized Rolling Stones- fucking UNREAL., fyi).\n\nAfter the face-melting rock of the 'Stones cover band, I felt a twinge in my soul, like, something was amiss. The problem? The Jack Tingle (that's what I call my whisky buzz) was fading fast. So I confer with the gang, and it is decided that a return trip to Grant and Green is in order. Back we go, and before you know it I've regained my stride and power through the rest of the afternoon, befriending G&G all-stars such as bartenders Zak and Blaze, and the neighborhood drunkard Perry (whom I had to inform that I was not, in fact, employed by Centerfolds, much to his dismay).\n\nBy the end of my evening, I had lost my (roommates) sweater, my sunglasses, and my ability to stand or reason.

I was rather pleased with myself too, for using public transportation for the first time in my life.  \n\nLater that evening, I ended up at the Grant & Green.  The band was late, but the bartender was amazing.  I had a straight-up, slightly dirty, vodka martini right away, and was immensely pleased with how quickly it came, and how perfect it was.  The bartender didn't even bat an eye when my male companion ordered a lemon drop.  We hung around this bar for hours...  And when my male companion left to move the car, the bartender bought me two double washington red apple shots, and then gave my male companion a freebie too.\n\nYou all have this lovely lovely bar, and the fabulous Shannon Curfman (who rocked my socks off that night), to thank for me coming to this city and falling in love with it.", "author": "Suzanne C."}

With all the handsiness and douchebaggery going on in your bar on Friday, I find it appalling that you chose to single out my friend for having a LAPTOP bag with him. You claimed it \"wasn't working\" to have it in the bar because it was \"in your way\" and that's not all you said.  And nothing you said was said in a remotely polite manner. Well, thanks to you, we all left. About 20 of us. 20 nice people who also happen to be good tippers and who were simply there to support our friend's band. Nice job.

I would have much rather heard some live music than listened to some frat boy's iPod playlist.  Well, eventually the band announced that they were cancelled, and the crowd left in herds.  So my friends and I decided that the band was being treated very badly, and that we could not support a bart that thought beer pong and live music weren't a cool mix.\n\nWe ventured down to 15 Romolo, where the drinks were original, the bartenders were voted best in San Francisco, and the manager was super friendly and even sent us out a free app after we had told him about the management out at Grant and Green.  \n\nSo if you are in the North Beach neighborhood, I highly recommend 15 Romollo as the place that you become an avid patron of because of its cool atmosphere, highly inventive cocktail menu, and great people.", "author": "Michael C."}

The band was cool, but good lord it was hot in there!  Felt like 110 degrees.   The drinks, service and locations were all \"ok\".", "author": "James B."}
