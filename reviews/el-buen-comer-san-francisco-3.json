Okay maybe i am exaggerating there was maybe two other small tables occupied. \nIve been here a couple of times and there usually aren't many people, so u never have to worry about waiting. \n\nThe food? At first the food was alright. But then the last couple of times i came here they got my order wrong. And unfortunately the food was also cold\nAnd my wife had a hair in her food?! Oh NO BIG DEAL. \n \nThere was another occasion when i was craving something and i called ahead to make sure they are open, and the lady that answered the phone said they were closed but yelp said they were going to be open for another hour i asked her about the mix up and her excuse was that the manager wanted to close early because they had no customers. \u200d\nSo i drove up there and guess what they were open!\n\u203c\nThe service well, they pick and choose who to be courteous to. \n\nHonestly i will never come back", "author": "Paola R."}

My rice and beans were cold and so were my wife's. \n\nThey changed it and brought us some hot beans. When they brought me my check I thought at least a 10% off for inconvenience on having to wait for my food to be redone. Nothing. Not even an I am sorry from the manager. Now I am feeling this pain on my side and so is my wife. \n\nI think the health departnent needs to be revisiting this place. Also, the flavors are good for the most part. They are overpriced.\n\n\nSo apparently it was not a hair but it was a piece from the tortilla basket. Interesting. This owner does not want anymore patronage because they feel my review was unfair? I have posted a picture of what the owner sent. Also, I never asked for a free meal or comp. you said your food cost is high?

El Buen Comer fits nicely in that in-between category of Mexican restaurants; far from a dingy taqueria & just as far from overpriced, upscale quasi-Mexican eateries. \n\nTheir thick & hearty chips are the perfect vehicle for buttery guac. Complex flavors like lime, spice, onion, & garlic running throughout. Fantastic! Top 5!\n\nRolled chicken tacos were delicious & crunchy. Tomatoey chicken tinga sat atop a fluffy, homemade corn tortilla. My lunch partner also ordered tacos & when she recapped our meal to my bf, said, \"You wouldn't like it, it's not greasy enough!\" For me, that's a plus, but I know that's a deterrent for the Mexican food aficionados in my life who like an oily shimmer on their carnitas & carne asada.\n\nI'd be here more often if I could only convince my favorites to take a break from their greasy go-tos!", "author": "Fancypants X."}

I think the price was a little steep ($9) but they did give us more guac than we could handle (3 people)\n\nRajas de crema Sope - mild/underwhelming taste. I found myself mixing the guac and salsa with it to give it a little more umph, although I will say that the tortilla had a nice crunchy base.\n\nMixed squash - nothing special about this dish. Ended up being just some cubed variations of squash that were sauteed, and I ultimately mixed it together with my mole and guac.\n\nPollo con mole - I was recently in Mexico city and fell in love with mole. Buen Comer's mole was pretty on par with the flavors I experienced then. Extremely delicious flavor, and tender chicken which is easy to shred. Definitely the highlight of our meal!\n\nI'm definitely glad I checked this place out.

The service here was kind, and our server gave us a number of good recommendations.\n\nWe started our meal off with the chips and guacamole to share, and the guacamole was so fresh--the avocados used were perfectly ripe and very flavorful! We split a couple dishes for our main course--the plate of three sopes (extra thick tortillas) with chicharron, chicken tinga, and nopales (cactus) was good but not all that memorable. The Camarones a la Diabla was a hearty plate of very spicy grilled shrimp with onions, and the mole verde de puerco, or pulled pork in a green mole, was probably my favorite--the mole was made from and had a distinct flavor of pumpkin seeds, which were so nutty and toasty! The main dishes were served with rice and beans, and we also had a basket of handmade tortillas, which were deliciously thick and chewy!\n\nOverall, this was a great place for a brunch in a friendly and homey atmosphere.

This place is not quite at that level, but I do like its aspiration of producing a comida corrida dining experience more akin to what you'd have in a nice, little neighborhood in Mexico City. In other words, this is no counter-order taqueria.

It was very simply made but definitely full of flavor with cojita cheese sprinkled on top and rice to help soak up the rich sauce. As a side dish, the $4.50 Jicama con Naranja was an unusually refreshing and spicy treat. Looking like French fries, the jicama was tossed liberally in chile, and then it was topped with a few orange supremes to brighten up the crunchiness (photo: http://bit.ly/2ikiYCr).

I'm not a fan of chicharron, but I really liked this one, wasn't greasy like straight-up fried fat.  I like sopas to be doughier/thicker, theirs was kind of crisp & on the thin-side but I'd order these again, they put plenty of toppings on it.  Other Yelpers mention how they'd wish some dishes were spicier but there were sides of very spicy salsa for condiment.\n\nI thought I didn't like the chicken mole because the mole had kind of a raisiny sweetness to it, but I found myself topping my rice, (3 times) and dipping tortillas, (2 times), into the sauce.\n\nThe hands-down star of the night was the shrimp diablo, so flavorful with  spices with a hint of sweet and the shrimps were very plump and fresh.\n\nI had, (for myself), the thinly breaded steak and loved it.  I never thought thin slices of steak, kind of crisp being lightly breaded, fried and seasoned would be impressive but it had such a homey flavor, I was really glad I ordered it.\n\nThe menu changes slightly every night, so I was disappointed when they didn't have rice pudding, so I made up for it by ordering the lightly fried plantain slices with a side of condensed milk & flan.  The plantain slices were a but too starchy for me but I'm a sucker for condensed milk so I enjoyed it, (I couldn't finish it all, just about 60% of it).  The flan, though small, was very refreshing with a hint of rum and slices of strawberries around it.\n\nI would come back again, although a bit pricier, the authentic and freshness and hand made factor makes it deserve the respect of slightly higher prices.", "author": "Johnnie N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-19", "description": "So, I finally get over my fear of dining solo for lunch and then this happens at El Buen Comer:\n\nDude *looks at empty chair*: \"Are you waiting for someone?\"\nMe: \"Nope.\"\n\nDude: \"Awwwww, you're eating by yourself?\"\nMe: \"Yes, I am.\"\n\nDude: \"You shouldn't eat alone, let me buy you a drink.\"\nMe: \"Sure, I'll take a double Hendricks straight up with a twist.\"\n\nDude: \"But, there's no full bar here...\"\nMe: \"You're observant.\"\n\nDude: \".........\"\nMe: \"Have a nice day!\"\n\nOk, I'm not that mean but I did think of responding sarcastically when he offered to buy me a drink (it was a really nice gesture but I just wanted alone time). If you see someone dining alone, please don't pity them. Many do it by choice. While I use to get major anxiety from it, I now relish the serenity, not to mention the solo foodgasms. \n\nEl Buen Comer opened in early June and I've been eyeing this place because I read that the owner started a restaurant out of her living room in the TL. With the help of La Cocina, she started doing pop-ups at the Noe Valley Farmer's Market and now has her first brick and mortar in Bernal Heights.\n\nEl Buen Comer serves up authentic, Mexican food - none of that overpriced hipster Mexican food (e.g. Tacolicious, Mateo's, Padrecito, Velvet Cantina). Their specialties are guisados, slow-cooked stews. Don't have your heart set on anything you see on their online menu because the menu changes daily. I wish they could post on social media their menu for the day since a lot of people do choose restaurants based on the menu and their dietary restrictions. \n\nI initially came in for the Mondongo, tripe stew that I saw on their online menu but they didn't have that. The only guisado they had for the day was a pork mole. I wasn't feeling pork so I decided to order something I normally wouldn't: Milanesa de Res, a breaded beef filet ($14) which was served with rice, black beans, salad: http://bit.ly/29L0EM0 and housemade tortillas: http://bit.ly/29RmH4z. \n\nThe milanesa was lightly breaded and had a jerky-like texture because it was pounded so thin (I think I ordered wrong). The rice and beans were simple and enjoyable, as were the freshly made, thick, hot corn tortillas. The salad was my favorite part of the dish. The greens were perfectly dressed in a creamy and tangy dressing, and I liked the tart crunch from the apples. Portions were fine for me but I don't think this would be filling for a hangry man. \n\nI had to sample more than one thing from the menu so I also ordered two Sopes: Chicharron and Tinga de Pollo ($3 each): http://bit.ly/2a6hqqG. Initially, I thought they were going to be super small like the ones at Cala but these sopes were sizeable (4 bites vs. 1 bite) and super delicious with the duo of salsas. Both were savory, flavorful, and had great texture. The chicharron was my fav as I love pork rinds. \n\nService was super friendly, prompt, and attentive since I was one of three tables there at the time. \n\nLoved the contemporary rustic space - high ceilings, wooden furnishings, open kitchen, and teal tiling. Great for a casual date or for a large group dinner. \n\nParking is easy during lunch on the weekdays and weekends but can be a nightmare at night. \n\nI hope the owner considers posting their daily menu on social media because I really want to try one of their guisados. The restaurant industry in the SF is super cut throat so I'm rooting for El Buen Comer to do well!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

However it's pretty overpriced and for the price, I'd expect at least big portions- they happen to be pretty small. The $16 mole was tasty but came with two small pieces or chicken. The tortillas that come with this are super good, clearly handmade corn tortillas and slightly thicker than normal. I normally skip tortillas but these were really fantastic in both taste and texture. The chorizo and potato sope was pretty good too, loved the salty chorizo with the potatoes. The sangria was just ok, nothing special and I would skip it in the future. Overall, the food tasted homemade and was tasty and the mole had a nice depth of flavor. Service was good too- were in a bit of a hurry and they made sure things came out quickly and got the check fast. My main thing is that you can get equally good, or better, Mexican food at a much better value in San Francisco and that's why I'm not sure I would come back here. I also didn't like the chicken in my chicken mole- the sauce was great but the chicken was a little over cooked and not too enjoyable.

The ambiance is amazing - high ceilings with a rustic yet modern Mexican feel, and large windows that allow light to pour in from the street. What a beautiful venue! They also have a large communal table that has bar seating - seemed like a fun table to sit at!\n\nAll the pics on their Yelp page looked great - so my bf and I shared the 3 Sopes for $10 (which are kind of like tacos, but thicker, softer, made of corn, and lie flat). You can choose whatever meats you want, so we got the chicken tinga, red rice and egg, and chorizo. We loved the chorizo and tinga ones!!! The neat thing is that you can also get the taco or tostada version of these too. We loved trying the Sopes though since we don't usually see those offered at Mexican restaurants. \n\nGuacamole is a MUST.

The place did not live up to the hype, at least not for me.  The service was decent to above average, and at the time we arrived, the restaurant had not yet been over taken by disheveled millennials, so energy in the restaurant was decent as well.\n\nI'm sure the restaurant was okay once; but, there are other restaurants that serve great if not better food for a lot less (one plate of milanese de res, and one of camarones a la diabla, a small bowl of guacamole, two beers and two sangrias = $90+, including the tip). If you wanted an extra corn tortilla, that was another $1.50, which to me seems mighty unreasonable - I know how to make tortillas, so I was not impressed that they were \"hand made.\"  I've also not ever been warned in a Mexican restaurant that the habanero salsa might be too piquant.  It was an odd piece of advice; but, it kind of told me a lot about the clientele and who really patronizes the place.  Many places in the Mission make their own tortillas, have different kinds of salsa without salsa warnings, don't charge that much and have their families in tow - not here. The servings were stingy - not at all what I'm used to in Mexican food.  Both our plates very small servings of rice and beans and my camarones and chelada had way too much lime, which made my meal very tart.\n\nThe food was okay; but, as soon as we walked out of the restaurant, I turned to my husband and asked if he liked the place. That's all I needed to ask to know we were not going back there again because the price of food, portions and overall meal did not impress either of us.", "author": "Criss R."}

Leaving the mob scene at the park, we wanted to get far enough away for parking. Yelped this one, and made a reservation online (there were 5 of us). Realized we were going to be late, so I called (twice) and they were delightful both times. With 3 kids, I cannot tell you how thrilled we were that they didn't do the old, \"sure we'll have a table,\" when they really don't. We walked in, they removed the \"reserved\" sign and seated us immediately. Hooray!\nGreat atmosphere, and super nice staff. Now, the food. The little guy is the non adventurous type, so he got a quesadilla, made special. The rest of us did the full family style dinner, and it did not disappoint in quality or quantity! Favorites were the delicious salsas, guacamole, and chips, and I'm now borderline obsessed with the jicama with orange and chili (WOW that was delicious!). The sopes were deliciously crisp and tender, and loaded with delicious toppings. The tacos were excellent, and the mole was perfectly rich and flavorful. The albondigas were a hit as well, and the tortillas were so fresh, HOT, and delicious I couldn't stop eating them, and I never eat the tortillas! The only word of caution- we forgot to say \"no chicharones please\" so we did end up with a couple of items that we couldn't eat, but that was our fault. If you don't like the chicharones, just make sure to let them know in advance, and they'll leave them out for you!\nDessert was a pile of crisp, fantastic churros and chocolate sauce, creamy flan, and coffee that had a slightly spiced (hint of cinnamon) touch. \nDefinitely recommend if you're in the neighborhood, or if you just want a relaxed, fun, delicious and authentic Mexican dining experience!", "author": "Cindy B."}

As I write this review the morning after I am trying to remember if I have ever had better Mexican food anywhere. Even counting places like Nopalito or the amazing Hierbabuena near Todos Santos, Mexico, I can't think of anything quite as good as this.\nA buddy and I shared (which is the best way to enjoy this place) a few dishes, including the green mole with pork, Albondigas (meatballs), black beans and rice and of course the show stopping home made tortillas. \nWe started with the chorizo laden tostada, which is a small tostada type appetizer. The accompanying tomatillo salsa was excellent, but I didn't think this dish was mind blowing. Great but not over the top. It was the first bite of the green mole with pork scooped into one of the heavenly tortillas though that nearly had me in tears. That dish is hard to put into words. It tastes like the most authentic, home style, velvety, rich but not too rich spiced perfectly, creamy, delectable insanely awesome dish you have ever tasted. I just sat there in disbelief. Seriously, it was that good to me.\nWe ordered a few margs which were excellent. The accompanying rice and beans were of perfect texture, taste and quality.\nThis place immediately shot up to the top of my All Time All Star list and is currently hovering around the top spot for favorite restaurants in the City. \nIt was already an hour wait for a table so maybe you shouldn't take my word for it and go somewhere else, but I thought it best and the right thing to do to give a review with mad props for the owners of this place, who have brought to SF some of the most incredible food the City has seen.

We had chips with guacamole, pork mole verde, chicken taquitos (dorado tacos) and black beans. \n\nLet's start with the chips - the warm, home made chips and fresh guacamole with chunks of Mexican cheese. So good! The black beans were perfectly cooked and creamy the pork was tender and the mole was not too rich not too spicy and not to dark - again so good! \n\nThe service and location were great - we can see ourselves becoming regulars at El Buen Comer!", "author": "Melissa G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-02-19", "description": "The food was tasty and I appreciated the quality of the ingredients that they use as well as the home made tortillas. However, the food was particularly pricey but what I found unacceptable is that we paid more than $10 of extras that were not communicated by the staff beforehand: We asked for more salsa and the bill included a $2 surcharge for a small plastic cup of salsa to which you add tax and tip. A request for more chips ended up with another $2+tax+tip surcharge for a cup of tortilla chips. 3 additional tortillas did cost an extra of $2.75+tax+tip. Again, you can definitely notice that these are quality ingredients but I find that this is not an acceptable practice to not communicate, at a minimum, that these come at an extra cost. \n\nSome people like to fly low cost airlines where everything is extra but at least you know before you take your seat. Personally, when it comes to restaurants and food, I want to feel that I am welcome and that food is an expression of the cook's generosity not feel that I am a walking wallet. Regardless, I like to sponsor businesses that embody impeccable ethics. Until El Buen Comer changes its practices, I will not return.", "author": "Laurent S."}

But, having said that, I feel super confident that you don't have to be from my neighboorhood, city or even state to enjoy what Do\u00f1a Isabel is cooking in her kitchen at El Buen Comer.  \nIn fact, I waited until I had some out of town guests in order to sample the menu, though small, it's concise, and there are some staples, as well as specials written in, which I assume change weekly.  \nWe started with guacamole, and this is the holy-moley-guacamole, without any sour cream, tomatoes, or fillers, just the avo, lime, cilantro, and garnished with healthy cubes of lovely cotija cheese.  The guacamole comes with their signature chips, I can only surmise are made from their own hand made tortillas, some of which souffl\u00e9 up and make themselves into little guac scoops!  Its a must-order.\nWe tried three different kinds of sope, though you can choose from taco, sope, or tostada, each on the home made masa base you decide on.  We picked chicken tinga, cactus(nopales), and chicharr\u00f3n.  All were really amazing.  That chicharr\u00f3n is not the crispy kind, its more like a lovely tripe, not for the weak of heart, but for the experience, its right in the zone.  This all comes out on beautiful clay plates and a small bowl of their potent green sauce, which you only need to augment the food with a drop of.  Any more, and you throw off the existing balance.\nIsabel's food is homey but everything on each plate is seasoned with care.  Rice and sumptuous black beans accompanied chicken chilaquiles, and it was a symphony of flavor, with the lead violin being played by the spicy salsa roja.  Nothing lacked, and there is no greasy soggy undesirable, oh no, quite the opposite, se\u00f1orita, its a plate-licker.  You will be tempted to get after every last freaking molecule.\nThe Milanesa de Res, I know, some people are going to expect a different Milanesa, but this is razor-thin slices of good beef, dredged in breadcrumb lightly and deep-fried.  Comes with Salad and the Notorious R&B(rice and beans).  I had the wherewithall to order an over easy #eggporn with that to seal the deal as it was still within the weekend brunch hours, so I felt the calling and the calling was answered.  I will be haunted by this dish in my sleep.  Don't expect a wienerschnitzel-type Milanesa and you won't be disappointed.  If you are looking for a more Teutonic pounded meat, go to Schmidt's or Los Panchos, son.\nFlan, oh the flan, it was coconut-crusted and freaking FLANTASTIC, and I will get it again.\nSo, if you're looking for the real deal authentic, not trying to be fancy but definitely Distrito Federal, Mexico City, M\u00e9xico, Uber, Lyft, drive, run, bike, but don't walk to this lovely rustic family operation and support your local delicious-maker, \u00a1Oral\u00e9!  Buen Provecho.", "author": "Kevin M."}

The food was good and our server was very polite. When we got our check I mentioned to the server that the price of the tortillas was really high (10dls for 10 tortillas, 1dl per tortilla). I asked to speak to the manager, I wanted to tell him that the price of the tortillas was too high, my dinner plate was 15dls and it was meat, rice and beans. The manager said that nobody had complaint before, and that the tortillas were organic. I said that I understood they were organic but in my opinion still very expensive, he said \"ok but nobody has complaint\". I told him I was just giving him my opinion and that I was going to writte a review on yelp and that is how places start to get a bad reputation. He told me if I needed his name so I could include it in the review to let him know and walked away. Another man asked him if everything was alright and he said \"she thinks everything is expensive\"...the man's response was that he buy's expensive ingredients so he can sell expensive food!. The point of this review is not even about the tortillas anymore, but I am completely amazed at the lack of professionalism and customer service this restaurant has. Both of these man were in charge, and they were both very rude and unapologetic. The menu of this restaurant has a story of the way it began, and how they got support from \"La Cocina\",  (a program I have supported and given many donations to) and it says that when one comes to El Buen Comer they hope one feels like at their house.... I guess they failed this time to make us feel at home huh? Needless to say I will never come back to this restaurant, I don't mind paying reasonable prices for good quality food but if you want to charge like you are a five star restaurant maybe you should treat your customers like a five star restaurant as well...it's a shame because the food is good, but in a competitive market like San Francisco you need much more than good food to last!", "author": "Monica M."}

Authentic! \nI am a Chicana raised in a family that lives to eat therefore I know my Mexican food.\nThis is not your regular Mission District Mexican joint (not that I don't love a late night burrito here and there). This is an authentic, family owned, home style Mexican food establishment. The flavors remind me of my last trip to Mexico City....spot on. We started with chips and guacamole. The chips are SO good and were freshly fried. The guacamole had great flavor, also tasted fresh. We all ordered sopes. We tried Papas con Chorizo, Chicharr\u00f3n en Salsa Verde, and Frijol con Queso. The sopes are handmade and the masa tastes fresh and delicious. I wasn't too crazy about the chicharr\u00f3n en salsa only because it had too much sauce for my liking, I still devoured it however. Maybe next time I'll request less sauce. Yes, there will be a next time. We also ordered Calabazitas. I had them with a side of black beans and fresh, hand made tortillas. I'm telling you, these tortillas are small but deadly; I could easily eat a basket to myself! \nThe decor is super cute, artifacts imported from Mexico. The ambiance is calm, staff is super friendly. The place feels like you've walked into someone's home for dinner. Everything is served in Mexican clay dishes (which I love). There are so many more items on the menu that I can't wait to try.

I'm sorry, I can't remember the exact wording of this menu option, but basically it's a tasting menu featuring the chef's choices.  It's $40/person and starts with chips, guac and jicama salad . . . ends with fabulous flan and churros.\nFrom start to finish it was amazing.  We've been here before and have enjoyed everything we've ordered, but having a sampling meal this way, took things over the top for us.\nWe started with chips/guac/jicama appetizers, then we were brought two huge platters of sopes and tacos.  Each one was described to us and the biggest dilemma for us was which was our favorite.\nAll this was followed by the entree courses consisting of 2 stews, rice, beans and summer squash w/ corn and tortillas.  \nFinally the flan and the churros . . . fantastic.\nHaving lived in SF and near the Mission for 30+ years, we thought we'd had good Mexican food.  Dining at El Buen Comer makes me feel like we've actually discovered a whole new ethnic cuisine.\nDon't get me wrong, when I'm craving a burrito, only La Taquiera or La Corneta will satisfy.  For me, El Buen Comer is Mexican food on another level.  Like how I love Mitchell's Ice Cream, but also always have to get a frozen yogurt at Costco . . . they are different and separate. You need both in your life, and one cannot replace the other.\nThe same now goes for El Buen Comer.  It's a second choice I never knew I needed in my life, but am oh so happy I found it.", "author": "bb b."}

The service was impeccable and we were greeted immediately by such warm and welcoming server.  This is a rare treat in San Francisco and such a great way to start our visit.   \nThe food-SO GOOD.   We have kids (it's not really a kid resto but kids are welcome especially at 5 when we arrived) and they had the best quesadillas with home made tortillas and Oaxaca cheese.   The black bean side was rich and complex-so delish.   The Mexican stews made for sharing were hearty and smooth-pork with mole verde was so creamy,  meatballs were a crowd pleaser, and did I mention those tortillas??? Amazing corn, probably just made for us.  Wow!! This place is amazing, the food is so special and reasonably priced and the desert was off the hook. Best flan in town.  For real.  Rice pudding to die for and of course churros made to order.    Loved the wine list, the veer list has classic beers and some cool surprise Mexican craft beers and the aqua fresca was easily the best in the Mission.  I feel so lucky Buen Comer is in our hood.  We will be going there often.     \nRun don't walk to have an authentic experience in a warm and welcoming setting.", "author": "Jennifer T."}

We started with the guacamole and then split egg tacos and the green mole pork. These were items that were written in on the menu, so I would imagine they're not always offered. The guacamole was great and refreshing. The pork was tender and the mole was delicious. It came with homemade tortillas which were fantastic. The egg tacos were slightly blander but only in comparison to the flavor packed pork, and still a great dish. \n\nThe service was good, the staff was very attentive. We weren't in a rush but the meal wasn't very fast. Don't come in expecting to leave in 30 mins.", "author": "Scott R."}

Nopale salad was delightful. Mole verde puerco, creamy, rich flavor with hint of spice. The black beans were good as well.  We had trouble deciding on dessert, so we ate two. Arroz con leche was creamy, tender not too sweet. The flan with coconut was outstanding. Try the hibiscus drink, sweet and refreshing. The cabotella beer was so good with our meal.  This restaurant is very busy after 6pm, so it's best to make reservations. Service was very well done. Decor is minimal, very noisy inside. Needs something to muffle all the noise.

We met the team (a family I believe) when they were running a wonderful food truck at the Noe Valley farmer's market. Their food was outstanding then and it remains so. The restaurant somehow manages to capture what I believe to be more traditional cuisine with the food now being served at more trendy and expensive taco places that populate downtown. We plan to be regulars. As the place can apparently get crowded, we are not alone in our enthusiasm for the restaurant.", "author": "Steven D."}

My wife, mother-in-law, our little daughter and I stop at \"El Buen Comer\" for brunch earlier today. Started with the Chips and Guacamole, we had the Milanesa, Tacos Dorados and the \"Puerco en Mole Verde\". All dishes were delicious, minor comment for the tortillas as they were not as thin and crispy as we expected but the wonderful flavor was definitely there. Now for the tricky part, the service. I understand this is a small place but there were many issues: I know that baby strollers can be painful and tricky for restaurant managers, however we requested a table in the back located next to a column, one of the servers told us in a very rude tone that we couldn't put the stroller there. I get the rules but in this case it turned out that the people sitting at the same table before us had one parked there!!! Besides we were able to take the seat out fold it and no extra space was taken. Strike One. My wife noticed then a piece of glass on the floor, of course accidents will happen but even after we pointed that out to another server he just limited to pick up another small piece of glass, 10 minutes after that we found out another piece. Just take a broom and clean it. After that I'm not sure why we stayed. Food delivery was rather harsh as my wife's plate was almost thrown on the table. We never got anybody to stop by and ask how everything was. Love the food, I hope the restaurant does good as it is in our neighborhood but service has to improve.", "author": "German G."}

When I go to a Mexican restaurant, and there are no Mexican people eating there, it speaks volumes.  Those raving about this food do not know what really good down-home Mexican food tastes like.  They must be impressed by the decor.  Sorry.  From one born and raised in the Mission and of Italian and Mexican heritage.

It wasn't the most pleasant  experience  and I thought  I'd let it lie but I decided I must share. As a native San Franciscan  I have to say there are better tasting, more welcoming restaurants in the Mission. Like someone else mentioned, it's a sign when there aren't any latinos eating at the establishment.  Overall I found  the food to be bland and portions were on the smaller side. The worst was the service.  It took entirely too long to have our order taken and receive our food. When we got our chips and guacamole I noticed  something on a couple of the chips. Is it hair? Upon closer inspection  it appeared to be fiber, maybe from a kitchen towel. When it was brought to the attention  of the waiter they tried to explain  it was from the basket it was served in. The basket  did not have hair like fibers. They offered  to replace it.  Do you even  have to ask? It was replaced  only to have a big fiber ball on the outside of the guacamole  ramekin. Waitstaff which I believe were the two sons, noticed  us inspecting  the dish right away and came and asked us what was wrong. We showed  them, but said it was fine as it was on the outside of dish.  Their  response was \"we're not perfect\", and said we didn't  have to pay for it if we didn't  want to or like it, and walked away. Really?\nWhat a poor response. Poor customer service. Never again. On the positive side, I guess you can be assured they're cleaning things. There's trace towel fibers around to prove it.", "author": "F K."}

It's hard for me to write a lukewarm review for a well meaning place, but I have to be honest. The food isn't bad. It's not great. It's just fine. We got the camarones plate that comes with rice and beans for $17!! And that's where they lose stars with me. For a few pieces of spicy shrimp and some staple sides, it was way too much money. The plate came with 2 handmade tortillas that were smaller than the size of my palm. When I asked for more, they said they would have to charge me extra. So I declined. The guacamole with their homemade tortilla chips was good. I also got a $4 cactus taco which I regretted. It wasn't anything exciting. And it was tiny! I kinda wished I had gone to one of Mission's fine taquerias for more food at 1/3 of the price! Service was good though. I can't knock them got anything other than ok food for way too much money.
