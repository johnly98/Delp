They have hardly any seating inside but I appreciate the grab and go vibe. Their condiment bar is so righteously stocked. They have anything you could want to add to your coffee; raw sugar, brown sugar, splenda, simple syrup, almond milk, you name it. The aesthetic is so cool and minimalistic in this coffee bar. The ready made fridge was closed when we went in. I wasn't sure if it was because we showed up around closing or if it was broken. I didn't get a chance to try their pastries but they looked super amazing. The espresso here is very smooth and bright and reminds me of honey.

Coffee Bar is one of five that I walk by every day on my way to work. I've stopped by here a couple of times specially for their Horchata Cold Brew ($5) which is very good. I've also tried their Vietnamese Cold Brew ($4.25) which does not have the intense deep strong sweet taste of coffee that you expect from Vietnamese coffee. I've also tried their cappuccino with both regular and Almond milk and found it to be good but not great. \n\nLike every other coffee place in FiDi at the peak morning hours expect a rush. Here it becomes a little pronounced as the place is very small and a lot of people end up standing close to the exit almost blocking it. I think they need to do a slightly better job of controlling the line and letting people move outside from where they can pick up their orders. Due to the rush I've not tried their hand crafted (pour over) coffee selection as the wait for that can be pretty long. The cashier and the baristas here are pretty good and treat patrons with respect (most coffee places in FiDi are like that except for Peets). Overall it's a nice place for me to cheat on my regular illy Caf\u00e9 once in a while.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

Starbucks, for example, uses a bulk matcha mix for their matcha latte, which has sooooo much sugar and milk emulsifiers. Big coffee shops also get packed to the brim with long lines because people like going to places that feel familiar. \n\nIn this infinite sea of the Financial District, I like going to Coffee Bar on Kearny, which is a very small shop. There are seats outside, but the space is too small to have real cafe tables. They offer pre packed take away meals like salad and chia pudding, which is fantastic! \n\nFrom a quick internet search, I learned it has a few other larger locations. They also get their beans from Bay Area Coffee House Mr. Espresso. \n\nCoffee bar is a solid small business coffee shop with great tasting coffee. I've gone here a couple time for lattes, and have enjoyed it so far. The latte is strong and rich, and the perfect pick-me up. \n\nThe space is contemporary and chic, but unpretentious. Hipster coffee places don't have the best sugar stations. I find that the mark of a great coffee shop is if they offer brown sugar for your coffee, which enhances the richness of the coffee unlike white sugar. And Coffee Bar has brown sugar! \n\nOverall, my favorite FiDi Coffee place so far.", "author": "Joanna S."}

It was barely hot, which I could've dealt with had it not been so sweet.  \n\nWhy, oh why do these coffee shops need to use sweetened almond milk? I don't get it.  Not everyone likes the taste of sugar in everything.  Think of it as a math problem: you can always add (+) in sugar if you want but you can't subtract (-) it from a drink!

Likewise, they have an honor coffee system, where you can pour yourself a cup of coffee and leave your money in the jar.  \n\nI love the people that work here--they are always friendly and smiling.  It is such a pleasure when people enjoy their job.  I asked one of the baristas how he is always in such a good mood the other day, and he told me CB is a pretty chill place to work.  Love that.  In addition, there are always a ton of people working so your order comes out with a quickness.  They always put a little heart in the foam on my latte--nice touch!  \n\nI note that they have pretty good-lookin' food options, although I haven't gotten around to trying anything yet.  They have yogurt with granola, sandwiches, and salads.  They also have pastry if you're into pastry--I think the cheddar scone looks kind of dope.  Again, I haven't tried anything because I am perpetually on a diet.  \n\nThis place is insane in the morning, so lookout.  I try to come around lunch so I'm taken care of throughout the afternoon.   If you come after 2:00 p.m., you might not be able to fall asleep later on in the evening, just so you know.  \n\nThat's all she wrote!", "author": "Sunny S."}

I've long been a fan of Recchiuti chocolate so when the boss mentioned that they have a Recchiuti Mocha, I was sold...and then I actually tried it and I was hooked. The place itself is very small, and usually packed. The people that work there have the largest chips on their shoulders - it's like they're doing you a favor by deigning to look at you and taking your order...call me crazy but when I order a small cup of coffee for $6, I expect better service! But you know what, I liked the coffee enough that I dealt with their crap-don't-stink attitude - until today.\n\nI waited in a line that was out the door, when I was almost at the register one of the guys behind the bar asked me for my order which I gave to him. He didn't take my name. I finally paid and stepped aside to wait for my coffee with the rest of the pack waiting for their coffee. The guy behind the bar says \"your drink is ready\" - just that, to a group of six or seven people. And then he repeats it, same thing \"your drink is ready\" - so I asked him if he was talking to me. He said yes and then under his breath \"I've only said it five times\" - hey, here's a couple of tips - 1) ask for a name when you take the order 2) when you say that someone's drink is up, say what the drink is 3) maybe, and this is a radical idea, make eye contact with the person whose drink is ready so they know you're talking to them and lastly keep your smarmy comments to yourself. \n\nI pass six coffee places between Bart and my office and going forward I will be patronizing the other five. I'm sure my small $6 drink makes no difference to their bottom line but it makes a difference to how I start my day by going someplace where I'm going to get a smile with my coffee, or at the very least going someplace where I don't get a crap ton of attitude with my coffee.", "author": "Debbie B."}

I can't do black coffee, and I'm picky.  Sometimes I feel like a \"cheap date\" with liking McDonald's iced coffee.  I usually prefer Starbucks and when I am near one, Philz.  I decided to head to Coffee Bar after stopping by a nearby client's office.  \n\nI stopped in last Tuesday right before 10:30AM.  There were still a handful of people getting coffee.  It was a hard choice between the usually strong iced Vietnamese coffee and the Caramel Latte, but I chose the Caramel Latte.  It was 12 oz. for $4.25, a little pricey indeed.  After about five minutes or so, my coffee was ready and I took the first sip..first sip had a little bite but it was good.  Second sips and beyond..OMGG..best latte ever!  It was very well balanced, not too sweet, but not bitter at all and not \"strong\" tasting.  It did give me a teeny bit of a buzz after I finished. \n\nWill definitely be back when I'm around that area of FiDi.

After all, we're not in Italy where there would be six cafes in a row with bulbous waiters in starched white shirts with their little mustaches and their little silver trays. No, this is the heart of the San Francisco business area where everything has to be on the go and out of my way - or out of somebody's way since my battle-scarred shoulders have a higher incidence of grazing and shoving on this stretch of pavement than any other in the city - including Chinatown on Saturday mornings. But you can actually sit down and have your coffee here as you watch people who make more money than you flash you a patronizing glare of disdain.\n\nWhat a treat when you happen to want to take a break before a meeting you dread back in the office. And the coffee is smooth and robust enough to enjoy while you've parked your derriere. For $4, you can get a rich, nice-afternoon-size Vanilla, Caramel or Havana Latte, the latter quite alluring with less of the requisite sweetness. But for $3.50, a large cup of their drip coffee satisfies me just fine even if it's nearly twice the price of what I could get at Starbucks. Coffee Bar's beans are sourced not from some Brazilian rain forest plantation or some Italian hilltop monastery but from a local roaster named Mr. Espresso which I previously knew as the roaster you see outside the window of any East Bay-bound BART train lurching toward the next stop.

Decided to treat myself to a pricey latte to rid myself of Monday morning blues -- Coffee bar did not disappoint. \n\nI read reviews before hand and saw some great buzz about their almond latte, which I ended up getting. It was delicious! The taste of the coffee was stronger than in some almond lattes I've tasted, where the almond latte overpowers most of the espresso flavors, but not this one. Even with the added splenda, the coffee flavor was strong and powerful, yet retaining the grainy almond milk taste. \n\nTips:\n+if you're in a rush, you can drop $2 into a jar and grab your own drip coffee to go. \n+almond milk is an extra 40/50 cents? \n+pretty latte art :)", "author": "Anu P."}

That is the same relief I felt when I discovered Coffee Bar, a coffee provider in the FiDi where the quality of drinks actually matched the district's uniform, wallet-draining prices.\n \nThe Vietnamese Iced Coffee embodies the desirable meld of a pro wrestler and a cherry blossom tree - its forceful caffeine content hurriedly punches you awake, while its intoxicating sweetness is emotionally uplifting. It is the ideal remedy for anyone seeking a mini-getaway from a stuffy, windowless office.\n \nThe foundational Vanilla Latte's evident identity crisis is manifested in its decision to feature neither a strong vanilla essence nor coffee taste. The sweeter and airier Havana Latte, which is not as serious as a normal latte, is perfect for later on in the week when the weekend's horizon becomes visible.\n \nShould you be in search of an incapacitating breakfast, the Nutella Brioche bun is sturdy and fluffy all at once, and is thickly painted with the decadent, hazelnut paste.\n \nAlso, if you are running late for a teleconference, Coffee Bar offers a tank of freshly brewed coffee on the side of its counter for self-serve and self-pay.

It was to the point of being undrinkable.....I've made mochas at home w/ Hershey's Syrup that tasted better than this did.  Watery & a slightly bitter taste from the chocolate syrup they used.  I actually had an involuntary groan of disgust upon 1st sip & if that wasn't bad enough, it was served on the cold side of lukewarm.\n\nSo overall, I'd have to say 3-stars for the latte w/ the caveat I wouldn't call it A-OK but *only* OK & 1-star for the mocha averages out to 2-Stars\n\nFurther justification that my fav coffee spot in FiDi continues to be Prima Cosa.

The Havana Latte hits the spot as well (though it can also be a little too sweet for my tastes like the Vietnamese).  \n\nSeveral mornings would be a coffee and a croissant with jam, and that was always satisfying.  The raspberry jam they serve is great and the pastries are decent, though nothing to write home about.

The pastries, especially the scones, are pretty good but definitely not worth a trip to Coffee Bar on their own. \n\nIf you get there fifteen minutes before eight or nine in the morning, be prepared to wait some five minutes for your latte because this is in the heart of the financial district. It's a very small space, and you'll probably have to shift yourself several times as people ask you whether you're in the queue to order. If you get tired of moving around as your latte comes out, sit on the absolutely gorgeous patio furniture outside. I asked about the benches and chairs, and they were commissioned by the design firm Selamat--in case you were curious.\n\nThe food in the refrigerator is delicious, as well. I've had several of the small dishes, including a curried chicken and a salami sandwich, and I'm surprised that they were well priced on top of being conveniently packaged to go. You can also buy a small container of yogurt here, and it'll come with a small selection of toppings, including nuts, some homemade jelly, etc. \n\nNote: if it's regular coffee you're after, you can just fill it up yourself and put cash into the jar next to the brewer. It's a great setup.", "author": "Bee L."}

There were 3 factors that really stood out about this place for me.\n\n1) Coffee - Never had a latte that was so creamy with bold flavors. It was far beyond anything that you'd get in your local Starbucks and Peet's. The individually made coffee was amazing as well and stacks up to Philz, Blue Bottle, etc, but without the fancy names. I kinda appreciate how this place leaves out the gimmicky, marketing words.\n\n2) People - The owner's passion, expertise, and creativity is evident. Similar to the way not everyone appreciates one artist, I'm sure not everyone will appreciate Coffee Bar. With Coffee Bar, the owner has created his own style and uses his methods of what he believes make the best cup of coffee. The employees appear to be just as passionate as the owner and carries the philosophy of perfecting each individual cups. \n\n3) Price - It's surprisingly not expensive.

This is an ode to Coffee Bar's ridiculously amazing caramel latte. Treat yoself, guys.\n\nSometimes (especially with specialty drinks), you'll have pockets where the flavor is perfect, and others where the milk didn't blend in and bitterness punches you in the mouth. That's never the case here. The baristas here really know their stuff, and I can sip my drink start to finish without ever noticing a change in taste. This applies to their mochas and regular lattes as well--but the caramel latte is just too perfect to miss. The only other one I've had that is a close contender is from Coffeehouse Northwest in PDX.\n\nThe sweet flavor is subtle and nutty, balancing beautifully with the espresso and with just the right amount of milk.

Don't get me wrong, I frequently drink black coffee straight, so it's not that I'm adversely affected by bitterness.  However, the bitterness I experienced from the cappuccino seemed it stemmed from a source that was not natural for the bean.  It was a bitterness that seemed to be from over-burnt coffee beans, so I had to subtract 1 star.  Another minus .5 star for the price.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-07-09", "description": "This is my choice for straight-up espresso when I need a little sumthin sumthin in the afternoon.\n\nThey do a nicely-pulled shot in a real ceramic cup, and serve it with a little glass of water without asking. Stand-up tables at the window. It's all very Euro and oh so civilized.\n\nI find their other coffee drinks to be fine, but not necessarily better than other places in town. Baked goods are tasty too. The whole thing is a little pricey and pretentious (which of course is the case with all the high-end coffee joints in SF) but it's quite pleasant and it's a carefully-made drink. The espresso is ground, weighed, and brewed with skill. Not fast like Starbux but not crazy-slow like Blue Bottle, where they stop and calibrate the machine for like 30 minutes right before it's your turn in line.\n\nIf you enjoy a good coffee or espresso drink you should try their stuff and see how it stacks up to your favorite. It's worth a visit for sure.", "author": "Al M."}
