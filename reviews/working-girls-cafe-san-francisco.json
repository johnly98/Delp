There are fancy sandwich spots nearby that charge an arm and a leg for organic, specialty ingredients (e.g. steak with goat cheese), but sometimes you want something basic, yet high quality.  If that's what you're after, look no further.  Favorite go-to sandwiches are the roast beef and cheddar, and the chicken parmesan. \n\nI've tried most combinations of a make your own sandwich, about half of the specialty sandwiches, as well as the quinoa bowl and they're all great.  The deli meat is high quality and the bread (especially the toasted seeded roll) is fantastic.  My only gripe is that they've raised their prices several times over the past year without improving their sandwiches, which puts them very close to the higher priced spots, yet lacking in the specialty ingredients those spots offer.  They did recently refinish the interior, though I didn't have any gripes about that to begin with.  \n\nIf you're looking for a quick and 'simple' sandwich, this is your spot.", "author": "Tom G."}

While looking up easy breakfast places while in San Fran I was hurt to see that everywhere was so dark expensive. My boyfriend and I just so happened to put down yelp and go out on a limb and stop at any place we saw. On the way to get food I came across a man who was dancing and having a blast walking down the street. I said \"I wish I was going nuts where that man was going\" ironically the place we went for breakfast that day (and the rest of our trip) was the same place the happy man worked at. Upon going in the employees were so nice and after a day they started to know our order. The man ended up being from where me and my boyfriend are from which was awesome! If I ever go back to San Fran I am going to stop by here in hopes of seeing that man again! Awesome food for a great price and best service in San Fran! I recommend this place completely!!!

But if I go out and stay up super late the night before, I end up hitting snooze one too many times and I have to make a run for the bus. This was my situation last Friday. When figuring out what to have for lunch, I decided to finally check out Working Girls' Cafe.\n\nI ended up ordering the Caprese sandwich: fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil, olive oil and balsamic vinegar on a toasted french baguette ($9.25). For some reason, it took a while for them to make this. Even the cashier apologized for it taking so long. Wasn't a big deal to me in the end, but it was nice that he acknowledged how long I had been waiting.\n\nI brought the sandwich back to work to eat in our break room. The bread was warm and toasty. I took a bite of the sandwich and wondered where was the flavor?! The mozzarella, tomato and basil where all cold which provided an odd mix of temperatures in comparison to the bread. I wanted the mozzarella to be warm and gooey. The olive oil and balsamic barely added any flavor. This sandwich was in need of some seasoning, like salt. On the positive note, the mozzarella and tomato tasted nice and fresh. And the sandwich was huge. You're definitely getting your money's worth in terms of size.\n\nMy coworker raved about how good her California melt was here, so I was expecting an amazing sandwich. Instead I got a sandwich with good ingredients, but no flavor. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Who knows. But I won't be back to get their Caprese. Maybe I'll try the California melt instead?", "author": "Elena N."}

The Financial District is a (relative) ghost town on the weekend so roaming its streets fresh off an airplane and hangry is not the place to be. Thank goodness for a quick check of the Jelps. WGC, it is. Plus, you know, the name sings to my soul.*\n\nWalking in, I'd skimmed the reviews and prepped myself for a Soup Nazi run-in. I experienced nothing of the sort. Yes, the owner is direct and has his way about him but there's a reason he has a legion of loyal customers. Figure out how the system works, order appropriately, take your food, and go. It's easy. Do it. And, I did.\n\nI opted for the MexiCali without sour cream.** The sandwich was huge, messy, filling, and more delicious than it had the right to be. It's a chicken sandwich, packed with jack cheese, black beans, corn, tomato, lettuce, and Spanish Sauce (admittedly, I had some pause when contemplating said sauce) all on a toasted roll. The flavors work. Sometimes when coming up with a sandwich, it's easy to just put a bunch of stuff on bread and eat it. Not so here. This combination took some thinking and the execution is fantastic. No, the sandwich doesn't come with a side (I got chips with my sandwich) but it's so large that you won't need one. You may *want* one but you won't need one. I am a fatty who eats a lot and by the end of getting through this bad boy, I was panting and my hands, mouth and shirt were covered in Spanish sauce (eyes up here, bub). WGC is popular for a reason. Don't question it; just do it. I may not venture inside its doors on a busy weekday at lunch time but on a cold and lonely Sunday in the Financial District, you better believe I know where I'm headed.\n\n*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv-0mmVnxPA\n** Sour cream is second to mayonnaise in its nastiness and evil.", "author": "Johnny T."}

However, one day I found myself walking down Montgomery on a Saturday morning and in need of a true breakfast, as I knew a Starbucks pastry just wouldn't cut it since I'd just come from the gym. \n\nWell times like these are where the \"Open Now\" feature on Yelp was invited, because I know that 90% of the restaurants on Montgomery/Kearny are only open during business hours on weekdays.\n\nSo to Yelp we went - and that's how we came to find a little establishment called the \"Working Girls\" Cafe. I say \"Working Girls\" in quotes because when I walked in there were two large, male construction workers, myself, and two men working behind the counter. So the title may be a bit of a misnomer, but that really doesn't matter much to me. I come for the food. \n\nAnd although I came in with low expectations, I left the place full satisfied. The #2 - ham, egg and cheese - substituted with a croissant (!) instead of the bagel is fire.

So there is one girl running the microwave and one guy 'working' the cash register only concerned with the girls who walk by and come in. He's looking at photos on one customers iPhone of her 2 Fast 2 Furious car when she says, ' Can we order my food, I only have 15mins.'. Money well spent on that guys wages. If he put that much energy in helping out in there they could have time to heat their food properly. Needless to say the sandwich was forgettable at best.

We were actually on our way to another place, but we saw their sign outside on the sidewalk with a list of their salads & they sounded pretty good. Plus there was a line inside so we figured that should be a good sign as well.\n\nThe guy who took our order was very friendly. We ordered the Mixed Green salad - sans cheese & apples, but added chicken. Also, the Caprese salad - sans mozzarella, but added salmon. As we waited, we continued to look at the reviews of this place on yelp. A couple of reviewers said they found cockroaches in their salads. Of course, we were like \"UH OH... Is it too late to cancel our orders?\" But we braved on. Our orders came up. The first thumbs up I have to give them is the fact that the chicken & the salmon on both salads came out to us piping HOT!!! So with the idea that there might be some extra \"protein\" in our salads, we actually ate them fairly slow & scrutinized every bite. In the end, we finished our salads without any problems. And I have to say they were delicious! The only thing was eating our food slowly & cautiously hoping to NOT find a cockroach...

My go-to salad is the Chipotle salad which is a bit spicy, sour cream, and tortilla chips. It is a big portion for $10. I also like the variety of sandwiches they offer.

It comes with tomato, cucumber, red onion, pepperoncini, kalamata olives, feta cheese, olive oil, lemon juice, and a little bit of mint. It really good if you are looking for a light lunch. \n\nI have also had their bbq beef sandwich which comes with roasted beef, pepper jack, BBQ sauce, lettuce, tomato, mayo, red onion on a toasted French roll. It is delicious, I do not order this as often as it is a heavier menu choice than the Greek salad. \n\nThere is usually a little bit of a wait for this place at lunch time, but it is worth it.", "author": "Stephanie T."}

There's a line to order and a group of folks waiting for their orders. The two often blend together so it's worth asking which is which. I had the soup and small salad combination and for around $8, it's pretty decent. I had the Greek salad which was chocked full of olives, tomatoes, feta, and pepperoncinis. In regards to the soup, I'm actually not sure what I got. I think it was some bean stew which was decent but the next time I'm here, I'll just probably get a full-sized Greek salad or try one of their many sandwiches which seem to be the main draw here. \n\nI'm probably not going to be a regular at Working Girls' Cafe but I think it's still an option.

I could not have been more underwhelmed by this sandwich. \n\nThere is a place right across the way tucked away in the building next to mine called Kinetic Cafe (or something like that) that serves the exact same thing but better and for $6.

Oh and sandwich & chips was only 7.50- not bad in the FiDi!\n\n[Edit]- I actually went back today (5-16) and got the California Melt. Awesome. Seriously yum! I think I will have the salad tomorrow! Their Cobb looks tasty!\n\n[Edit #2]- I went back today for their Cobb salad. I was not a fan. I can't bump this place up to 5 stars just yet. \n\n1st of all, the Cobb salad didn't have egg on it!? what is that! if I am paying 8 bucks for a Cobb salad I want egg on it! I also didn't enjoy it because I don't like feta cheese, but that isn't their fault I forgot to tell him. They also changed the dressing for me because I don't like vinaigrette, so they earned some points back, \n\nOver all the salad experience was a little bit of a let down... I am willing to try the chicken Cesar...  to be fair, a non-deli snob would probably rave about the salad, but I just was disappointed. Maybe I expected too much because the sandwiches are amazing... who knows. \n\nI will probably stick with the sandwiches from now on though.", "author": "Jessica R."}

I never thought I'd ever say (in my head, at least) about a salad, \"Too much stuff!  Too big!\"  WGC's salads approach that, though.  They're spectacular.  My current favorite is the mixed greens with walnuts, gorgonzola, apples, and other goodies.  With chicken, it's ten bucks, but it's huge and wonderful.  The Asian chicken salad and the baby spinach salad are similarly delish, with the Caprese coming in right behind.  Their sandwiches are imaginative and lovely as well.  Today I had their Caprese sandwich.  Fresh mozzerella, thick slices of tomato, julienned fresh basil and romaine served on a toasted french roll with a balsamic vinaigrette.  Jeezusgod, it's good.\n\nI don't come here as often as I'd like because it tends to fill up when I go to lunch, which is on the late side (1:00-ish) and there isn't a lot of space to wait.

I will not go to Starbucks across the street because it is some huge global chain and why would I waste money there? Why would I eat at subway's next door when I can get some quality ingredients here? This place hires mostly women who probably wouldn't get a job elsewhere. Note the name \"Working Girls Cafe\".

(vegetarian protein at its best).", "author": "David F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-11", "description": "it's good, but not great.  i usually get the italian sub.  this place gets PACKED during lunch hour, and sadly, the decrease in performance is super apparent.  the margin of quality between my 4pm italian sub and 1pm italian sub (not on the same day, mind you) was pretty large.  i find it a little pricey for a sandwich, but it's certainly comfort food.", "author": "Jon Y."}
