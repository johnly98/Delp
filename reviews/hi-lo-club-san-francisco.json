It's calm, quiet energy puts me at ease and the patrons are usually people that appreciate quality cocktails and a great beer list. The vibes are great inside those walls. \n\nRecently, I popped in for a cocktail with some friends and ordered a couple off the concise list. The cocktails were perfectly crafted and super tasty!

I say, \"Okay, I'll go and get some cash\".  She says \"Okay, go fast. Like, seriously, make it quick.\" I gestured sarcastically how I was going to run to the ATM. \n\nSo let me get this straight; you have a $15 minimum AND you don't trust me to make my way to the ATM to get cash? What a joke. \n\nAnother observation: there was a tinder-couple sitting next to me enjoying some conversation and at some point they ask if they can order a drink and get an extra glass so they can share. The same lame bartender tells them \"it's an extra $$$ to share.\" (I don't remember the exact amount, might have been somewhere in the $2-4 range). The guy replies jokingly \"Okay I guess we can just sip from the same glass\". \n\nThe last-straw was when she put the drink-menu in front of me while I wasn't even done with my beer. I felt pressured to either buy another drink or leave, and rush finishing my first beer either way. On a slow wednesday night, for that matter. No thanks. \n\nThis bartender treats customers like children while complaining \"we have very strict policy - sorry\".

For someone who does not tend to drink cocktails because they are usually too strong, I was so pleased that this blend was not only moderately strong, it was refreshing, slightly effervescent and not too sweet. At $9.00 a pop I enjoyed two last night, with no head bend this morning. \n\nThe music was a little loud and the bar was stuffy.

Why is this listed as a dive bar?  It's not a dive bar.\n\nI've lived in this stretch of Polk Gulch for almost three years.  Somehow for the first two, I managed to walk right by Hi-Lo without really noticing it was there.  It's mostly dark-tinted glass out front, with the side area where Iron and Steam does their thing during the day.  When you walk-in, it's no longer nondescript.\n\nThe environment makes me think of a bombed-out building in some European village during World War Two - believe it or not, I say that in a complimentary way.  Perhaps, romantically, I think this feels like a place where a soldier would spend the night and feel a dark and quiet refuge from the war that will come again in the morning.  Or maybe a place where the people from some French village come at night to try and carry on their antebellum way off life in the midst of chaos, knowing that one day this too shall pass.  \n\nThe walls are distressed, and there is limited natural light coming in from a skylight.  The lighting fixtures feel impromptu - and, it is DARK once the sun is down.  You gotta take a few minutes to let your eyes adjust.  That said - the bar is beautiful, and they have an amazing selection of liquors and craft-beers.  I'm not a cocktail guy, usually, but I love their beer list.  It is a little heavy on the import-side, but that's fitting for the vibe.\n\nAnd back to the dive bar statement - this place is WAY too classy for that.  The service is really knowledgeable, the products are good quality and I would rate the crowd as upscale but casual, good age-range, no fratty-douche bags.  And, it's never loud or obnoxious.

After seeing the latter club's 2nd floor light show from a block away, I knew that Playland was NOT a spot to walk into with at least one cocktail in your system. Enter Hi-Lo...\n\nThe ambiance inside is equal parts urban loft and classic speakeasy. An ol'-timey cash register sits behind the bar, and credit cards are a relatively new thing for this joint. Just the type of low-key place I was looking for.\n\nFor a place that could be easily overrun by hipsters (and I caught a few out of the corner of my eye), or a bro crowd biding their time for the perfect moment to pounce into Playland, the clientele was diverse, unpretentious, and laid-back.\n\nThe bartenders were quick and appear to know their stuff. My gin-based \"20th Century\" - with Cocchi American, crime de cocoa, and lemon - was a sweet-yet-tangy way to start the night, and with a $9 price tag across all of their signature cocktails, you won't go broke posting up here for a couple rounds.\n\nIf you're heading out to Polk Street, chances are you've got some sort of agenda for your evening, and it's probably not a low-key one.

To boot, another member of the staff (bouncer?) thought it appropriate to get this idea across to us by reaching from behind me and violently slamming my arm to the bar with my glass in-hand as I am reaching the glass to my mouth to finish my last gulp - without first taking more subtle measures to insist that we immediately finish (which we were trying to do!) or warn of the possibility of a physical altercation. Customers sitting at a bar finishing their drinks should not be treated with such a lack of respect or disregard of personal space. \n\nI hate writing reviews based on a single interaction where a couple of employees experience a poor lapse in judgement, but not allowing reasonable time to finish a drink and violating someone's sense of security without any warning because you want to close up quickly is grossly out of line. \n\nI know staff wants to finish work and get on with their night, but I've been at many bars in other locales with a 4am closing and have never been treated with such a lack of respect. \n\nThe bar is pretty cool, but I worry that this treatment is indicative of what management and staff think of its clientele.", "author": "Scott M."}

It's a great starter bar if you're out for a night of barhopping, or a great \"break\" bar if you're looking for somewhere calmer to wind down. There's nothing too interesting or unique about it -- I know that doesn't sound like a positive trait, but for me it is. The unique bars on Polk Street (like Soda Popinski's) are always so crowded that I often find myself looking for a quieter place to relax. \n\nThe atmosphere is dark and intimate, with a large standing space. From the exterior, it doesn't look like anything special (gray and boring-looking, with a faint \"Hi-Lo\" sign and a bouncer in the front), but once you step inside, you immediately feel more comfortable. The decor is classy-hipster, with hardwood flooring and concrete walls. \n\nThe bartenders are nice enough, and knowledgeable about their drinks. My friend told one of the staff to mix something random, and he whipped up some fabulous concoction that I downed within a few minutes. \n\n**NOTE:** If you're looking for somewhere to dance, this is not the place (yeah, they shouldn't be calling it a \"club\" at all). \n\n**TIP:** THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY. There are definitely ATMs all over Polk Street, but if you only have a card on you and you don't want to pay any service fees, you might want to bypass Hi-Lo.", "author": "Christine L."}

Not too crammed. We asked for an IPA but they didn't have any, so the female bartender with the black short hair recommended the Almanac. Little did we know that it was actually called the \"Sour Almanac\" and it was the most disgusting thing we had ever tasted. It was NOTHING like Alagunita (we asked for something comparable to that IPA). \n\nWe don't like to send drinks back but in this case, we just couldn't make ourselves drink it. Plus, we figured it wasn't a cocktail that took time for them to make so the bartender wouldn't mind pouring a different beer from tap. Boy were we wrong! The bartender immediately started with an attitude and said \"That's what you ordered. I didn't make a mistake.\" Mind you, we never accused her of making a mistake. We simply wanted a different beer because we were not aware that it was going to be sour. \n\nWe asked another bartender to change our beer but he said \"it clearly says on our menu that it's a sour beer.\" Ummm MENU??? What freaking menu? We didn't have a menu and we didn't order from one. The bartender picked something for us that was nothing like what we expected and so we simply wanted an exchange. Nope, not going to happen. Long story short, we were stuck with two $10 Sour Almanacs that were so bad we couldn't drink them and our mood was ruined so we left. I've never encountered a bartender who refused to exchange ONE drink. It's clear to say that we will never return to this bar.", "author": "T H."}

Among the very few options for a proper cocktail on Polk Street outside of restaurant bars, Hi-Lo Club is probably your best bet. A smallish but well stocked bar turns out drinks with the speed of your average vodka soda type bar but with most of the benefits of an upscale craft cocktail bar. (Most, but don't look for egg whites, artisanal hand carved ice, or housemade celery bitters). If nothing else, come for the beautiful glassware.\n\nBoth times I've been in I was helped by Lori (Laurie?) who impressed me with her ability to juggle multiple orders of fairly time-consuming cocktails without sacrificing quality even on a Saturday night--because there's nothing worse than paying 11 bucks for a free-poured drink that hasn't been mixed long enough for some ice to melt.

I did not have any cocktails but their whiskey selection was above average.  I say that because behind the front line, I found a hidden gem in the form of Pappy 10.  It wasn't exactly what I was expecting but it was a sweet surprise nonetheless.  Bartender is friendly and everyone loved their drinks.  \n\nHowever, one of the qualifiers for Pappy is that it's going to be EXPENSIVE.  For a $39 bottle MSRP, it cost $20 for a pour.  Now that's fine with me, I'm not going to argue the price because I KNOW (believe me I do) how ridiculous it is to come across a bottle like that.  My issue is with the CASH ONLY business model.  Sure you can get more value out of your business but if you're going to offer higher-priced liquors, that model sort of goes out the window.  If you are going to have any number of drinks at Hi-Lo Club, you'll be racking up ATM fees like crazy (actually, THAT may be the real business model...lol) unless you carry fat wads with you all the time.\n\nAll in all it's a pretty good location and another place to note down where to find a rare pour of whiskey.

I know we will both be back and will bring more friends to share the experience.\nAlso we were unsure of where to have dinner so asked the bartender.  He ended up giving us a list of places in the neighborhood.  It wasn't too busy so he had time to do it. For the people who rip on the service, not sure what happened, but both times have been positive for me.", "author": "carolyne c."}

They recently did a bourbon/bacon new cocktail menu launch party, which really solidified my love for them. I mean, a manhattan with a side of free bacon; yes, please.\n\nSo other than that rare bacon night, they also do really great cocktails on every other regular night. They've got a good liquor and beer selection and pleasant bar tenders. The interior of the place is also really beautifully done. There are tin ceilings, a huge I-beam stretching across the ceiling, and rustic crackling paint walls. They also usually have tea lights lining the liquor shelves which is a really lovely touch. Also I came one night and the bouncer had a big snake draped around his shoulders, so there's that.\n\nThe place can get a bit loud, and the crowd is sometimes a little square, but I can't dock them stars for that.

So, I insisted we check out The Hi-Lo Club. Often I'm suggesting off hours to convene for a drink -- 4pm on weekdays or 2pm on a Saturday... or 1am on a Wednesday. I really do this out of respect for the bartenders as... say... there's a good chance I have a hankerin' for a gin fizz, and in a bustling crowd it's poor form to order one. With that in mind, we arrived at 630 on a Friday -- their second Friday being open. \n\nMartinis and Manhattans were the orders and they crafted a Rittenhouse Rye Manhattan that was pristine. They served it in a vintage coup glass. (If you would like to take me home, note: serve whatever you're serving in a vintage glass.) \n\nSome don't like it loud. Some don't like simple, open design. I do. Diner table booths. Concrete walls. High ceilings. It's loud. It's airy. It's comfortable. Note: the prior business's awning is still up that reads \"crepes, pastries,\" and 1423 is the correct address. Cash only. ATM across the street. \n\nThe last thing I was expecting was table service -- on a Friday at 7pm... table service they had, and five stars they get.", "author": "Jon A."}

The bar is disguised under the awning of it's former establishment, and unless you're looking for the gilded letters on the window it's easy to miss.\n\nUnless of course it's 10pm on a Friday when it turns into the hotspottiest hotspot on Polk Street.  And for good reason.   Everything that was great at their previous incarnation, Koko's, has been tweaked and tempered until nothing was left but sweet and sublime.\n\nCraftsmanship is evident in every detail, from the bar that occupies the length of the establishment, to the weathered walls, to the delicate silhouette of HI-LO from the window stencil that shows on the opposite wall in evening light.  The lighting is brighter than Bourbon and Branch and feels more authentic.  \n\nDrinks are bohemian, boozy, and about $12 a pop.  You get what you pay for, and a few of these will leave you reeling.

But....\n\nI went there with a couple of friends, I arrived first. Wasn't ready for a cocktail, and ordered a glass of their tap wine. Don't do it. This is a cocktail place, and this is what they know. The wine was bad, I cautiously sipped it for a while not wanting to complain, but then my friends came and confirmed that it was in fact really bad. Not a bad wine, just a bad keg. It was completely corked.\n\nI think the woman that was serving us was the owner, I politely (reluctantly) asked her if the keg was old, and she said she had just opened it and very nicely offered me something else. I ordered a Pimm's Cup which was really tasty. But then she came over and charged me for the drink (I had already paid for the wine). All my friends were shocked--that was not the impression she had given.\n\nI paid, not wanting to cause a scene, but it was really rude. I had been planning to leave her a nice tip for changing my drink (and the $2 difference in price), but instead I left nothing.\n\nI most likely won't be going back. It's too bad.

The owners did all the decorating themselves, importing the original bar from the Koko, even going as far to import antique ceiling tiles from New York City, and putting in old-timey floor boards and a secret storage room (VIP room) with 100 year old newspapers on the wall.   Oh yes... The bathrooms! Oh the glorious, clean, private bathrooms!! (Koko insiders will remember the less-than-ideal restroom situation...lol.)

They have a decent selection high-quality beers as well (IPAs!). Just don't go here expecting darts and cheap drinks, or sports TVs on the wall. That's not this bar.  \n\nFinally, if you go to a bar, and it clearly says \"Cash Only\", respect the freedom and business decisions of the owners, and don't go writing some lame Yelp review because you were **too stupid to read the signs**.

What I remember from KoKo's: Quality cocktails at a good price with friendly service and a laid back crowd. That combo's probably too much for any bar to pull off in their first few weeks of being open, so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt as they work out the kinks.\n\nThe space is a lot more open than their old spot, with big floor to ceiling windows in the front. Lots of booths are great if you get one, and when we were there they had table service. Our server also doubled as our drink-maker. She was a great server, but not so great at the drink making. I had a Sazerac and an Old Fashioned, and they were both watered down and way too sweet. After every sip of the Old Fashioned, I considered abandoning it and going to another bar, but I don't like wasting alcohol when there are starving children in China who probably don't have any alcohol at all. It's just how I was raised. Other people in my group seemed to enjoy their drinks, so I may have just been unlucky. Things were also pretty busy that evening, much busier than any time I had been to KoKo's - not sure if this is because it's still pretty new or if it's going to be a permanent thing, but I like my bars a little quieter.

The front of the place seems a little empty, but the booths and counter are nice. Nice strong drinks, but this is cash only, so I gotta ding it.", "author": "B Y."}

Has the look of seediness of that time in the light of candlelight and dimness. Just because of the length of the bar it could have been a soda counter without the soda.  The bartenders knows their craft and the mixologists within will be happy with what they have on their menu.  Will come back.", "author": "Uei L."}
