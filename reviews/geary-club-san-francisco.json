I found it 7 years ago when I was visiting a friend in San Francisco, and ended up at a terrible blues bar with a terrible blues band and a terrible cover charge that only twisted the knife. While there, I took out my phone and searched Yelp, and on my then-terrifically-slow 3G connection, found Geary Club about a mile and a half away. When I read the complaints about indoor smoking and rude bartenders and unfriendly patrons, I knew it was the only place nearby I would probably enjoy myself. I was not wrong. Within 20 minutes of arriving, Lillian had scolded my friend's cousin for being on her phone, yelled at someone for insulting us (the lady in question had actually just heard us say we're from Texas and was yelling that she loves Texas) and kicked everyone out of the bar. Only after being talked down - at length - by several regulars did she repent and let us all stay. \n\nBy the end of the night, we had somehow befriended Lillian enough that when we asked where we could go to drink a fifth of whiskey we had just bought because the aforementioned cousin had taken someone from the bar to our shared hotel room for naked time, she took us nextdoor to her apartment, bade us wait til she closed the bar, then she came up and offered to cook us some pork chops, which we turned down, then we shared edibles and drank the whiskey while listening to patsy cline and talking about life and love. That night was not only the highlight of the trip, but also one of my favorite memories. I'm sad to hear Lillian is no longer at the bar, but I am incredibly happy that I got to meet her.", "author": "Wes D."}

This is your neighborhood dive bar. 1 TV, rail liquor selection, and bottled beer. \n2. I loved the atmosphere for a dingy dive with a great cast of characters enjoying a Friday night. \n3. Lillian has been running this joint for a while and will take good care of you. She suggests a beer and a shot Anchor Steam and a shot of Fernet Branca. \n\nDont bring your date here unless you wanna test them on how down to earth they are. There are bar flys literally.

Also - I wonder where it would be held?  Atlantic City?  Reno?  Jacksonville, FL?  I'm not exactly sure what it would look like, but I know it would smell of:  Stale beer, old cigarette smoke, farts, and lord only knows what else.\n\nOh sure.  There are divier dive bars (like, where you think you might get murdered by the guy ranting to himself in the corner - eh hmm...  looking your way Jonell's), and there are certainly seedier joints.  This is a dive bar's dive bar.  On the one hand, Super Divey.  On the other hand, actually pretty classy as dive bars go.  I was told to come here on a recommendation while I was at Ha-Ra Club.  Sure enough, it's a good thing I got the tip, because I would NEVER have found it otherwise.  You know a bar can stand on it's own two legs if it does NOTHING to be noticed.\n\nWhat you'll find: \n\n1.  Bottled Beer only (for beer - they have the hooch) - Which is fine, because they have Icey-Cold Mueller Light bottles.  (is best beer - taste a-ok's, no filling ... thanks to my Russian friend for that assist)\n2.  Bartenders who think short-term bartending gigs are at least two decades.  A few nice ladies - although, I suspect you need to go at least for five years before you are considered Geary Club Elite.\n3.  Neighborhood patrons.  This is a nice classic gem nestled against the back-drop on impending gentrification.\n4.  A guy who calls himself \"Evil Robert\".  I didn't think he was that evil.  ...just saying.\n5.  A bar that is open Ear-lie in the Morning.\n6.  A stuffed Tiger-Head.  Named... wait for it... Tony.", "author": "Adam S."}

The Geary Club is a special place, dissimilar from the other bars in the Tendernob.  Here people are quite friendly, but not at all outgoing or pushy-\"friendly\".  Sit for a while, think, nurse your (cheap) drink - and when you actually have something to say, say it.  This bar is much quieter than most; but the conversations much better.  \n\nHere you will hear the sound of people speaking standard American English,tho not always with an American accent.  There's none of the hideous Stanford-drawl of the Marina douches, nor the equally hideous Norcal-snark of the Mission iClones; nor any incomprehensible ghettobabble; nor the crazy bum-gibberish endemic to the TL.  It's a subtle thing, but the sound of a place contributes a great deal to its character.  At the Geary one rarely hears the grating tones of pretension, snobbery, or willful idiocy.\n\nThe volume on the (fairly decent, and appropriate olde-timey) juke box is kept low.  The bartenders can control it, but flat out refuse to turn it up loud.  The clock on the wall is set to Network Standard Time, none of that imaginary Bar Time bullshit.  There's no sign on the door, and there's a tiger head named \"Tony\" mounted over the bar.  The bartenders are all older women, one of them notable as a cougar, all decent & polite people.  \n\nThe patrons are a pretty broad cross section of the City.  Taxi drivers, laborers, ad men, programmers, students, artists..  anyone who loves cheap beer and good company.  Natives, immigrants, economic refugees from the flyover side by side.  \n\nNot to say it's a perfect place.  There is only one variety of wine, some pink girlie stuff I don't want to drink.  A cheap red wine would be greatly appreciated, if management is listening.  Beer selection is not huge, but at least a bit eccentric.

It's open door welcomes visitors, but it's dwelling-like storefront is devoid of signs, windows, and neon.  The sounds of laughter and music beckon visitors to enter, but the unmarked exterior makes first time visitors apprehensive of what might be inside.  Bar?  Restaurant? Private Club? Somebody's Garage?  I stumbled by this place on a Saturday afternoon, and couldn't resist casting a pensive glance inside.  What dwelt within? Naught more than a neighborhood bar, a sight that didn't reveal itself until my pupils dilated enough to see amongst the interior lighting, which is equally sparse as the exterior decor.\n\nThe long, narrow room reaches deep into the building it dwells in.  It's dark near the entrance, gets darker further in, and becomes *really* dark near the back.  Modest-sized TV's sit at either end of the bar...get a seat near them if you want to watch a game.  The interior is definitely old-school....cheap simulated wood paneling on the sides with stucco up top.  The barmaids are quick, friendly, and cute-as-a-button.  Liquor selection is average, and I didn't see any beer on tap.\n\nThe crowd I saw was mixed, and somewhat older.  Neither the beautiful people from the trendier part of Geary nor the freaks from the Tenderloin were present.  A younger guy sat on one side of me, and a lady in her 70's on the other.  Striking up baseball chitchat with the younger guy proved futile...all I got in return was a punkish gruffness.  The lady on the other side proved very talkative.....in baseball, history, and politics.\n\nBluntly put, it's a dank, dark, somewhat characterless space whose only saving graces are the bartenders. One might see it as an upgrade from the Tenderloin, or a refuge from terminally trendy spots several blocks down Geary.\n\nAnd empty beer and four point lead by the Phillies over the Giants signaled it was time to move along.  I pondered the Geary Club's virtues as I walked out the door, racking my brains for a reason to praise it.  Halfway down the block, I'd drawn a blank.

I've spent way too many minutes staring at the computer screen, fingers frozen over the keyboard. The few reviews I've cranked out have left me feeling 'meh' so I decided to \"go back to my roots\" (a late night week day drinking festivity that involved me acting like a total girl). Yep, fueled by a much needed chat fest, continuous vodka tonics and snappy attitude from every angle of the bar I could feel the magic of Geary Club thaw my Yelper's block.\n \nIf you don't know what kind of a place Geary Club is, I can sum it up for you fast: it is a bar to get your dive drinking on! \n\nNow I'll elaborate. This place is \"classy\", like the same level of classy an afternoon shift stripper with a missing front tooth and an eye patch is. There is no shame. You know, a bar where some truly quality drinking takes place. One of those multipurpose bars where your mindset can be up for a cheery day of drinking to the truly depressing \"I don't give a flyin' f*ck anymore, I just want to be loaded\" as you slurp away at your drink and stare off forlornly into space or a recovery/ recollection drink from the night before. It's a place where you get your drink with a bar stool and counter space. A bar where no natural light has the strength to make it past the first foot of the door (a special bar vortex if you will).  \n\nYes you can smoke in here and yes, as a smoker I appreciate this. Even as a non smoker you should be able to appreciate this too because this little drinking palace is in the heart of TL. One glance around the room or pop outside should tell you the funk you WOULD be smelling if this was a non smoking establishment. And of course there is a certain delight in ashing into a piece of foil bent into an ashtray (I told you, this place just exudes true class). The crowd is an healthy slice of the local neighborhood. $20 can get you 3 to 4 rounds (with tip) for your group or your own sorry ass. Of course, you can be like me and my friends and smartly invest in the jukebox so you can have a soundtrack to your commiserating.\n\nThe best part of Geary Club though is the \"on the border of kicking your ass\" feel to the place. Whether it be tough as nails bartendresses, the attitude of the other patrons and the neighborhood or the aftermath of too many well drinks, you can pretty much assure yourself you will have your ass handed to you in some way or another if you aren't in check. But really, sometimes we have to learn our lessons the hard way no?", "author": "Veronica G."}

From the little twinkly lights over the bar, to the rockin jukebox time-warped from the 80's. It's a nice place to round out a bar crawl, especially if you only have a few dollars in your pocket (two drinks-$7!)\n\nLillian is one of the sweetest bartenders I've ever met.

I was told that there was a \"hot\" German bartender that gets drunk and occasionally randomly \"tongues\" customers. I was told it was a rowdy TL dive bar.  Isn't it interesting how different people perceive things so differently?\n\nThe bartender was very pleasant but not what I'd call \"hot\". I thought perhaps the hot bartender had the night off until the one that was there told someone that she had to work a 12 hour shift because mom wasn't feeling good. Unless mom is an unusually attractive sixty something this must have been the \"hot\" bartender. I did see her get very cozy with one of the customers. Also, not that it matters, but I know Germans and I'm not convinced she even had a German accent; it sounded eastern European to me although I make no claim of accent expertise.\n\nThe Geary club is a typical dive bar with a cliquey set of regulars. They don't have any beer on tap if that's important to you. Finally this place is a little smoky, how did I stand going out before they banned smoking in bars? Just a little smoke is intolerable to me now. \n\nSince this place is so close to one of my favorite bars, Edinburgh castle, I doubt I'll be back.

It stunk like an ashtray from 1975, and I am NOT the type that is usually sensitive to stuff like that.  Maybe I've been living in SF too long, but I felt like I was going to hurl after a minute of breathing that stuff and could feel it seeping into my skin.  To top it off, folks were having a good old fashioned bar fight at the entrance, and the other guys in the place gave me the creeps enough that I shuddered on the way out.  \n\nI am so tempted to give my first 1 star rating, but I guess I must have missed something based on everyone's review.

How in the hell did this place ever attract 49 patrons with internet access?  \n\nMy favorite dive bar on the planet was a place on the North Sea in a town called South Shields, England.  My old man sent me there right out of college to become the Taco King of northeast England (it's a long story). If you've ever been to So. Shields you'd understand why a taco stand wouldn't work in a bitter-ass cold, god-forsaken, industrial crap-hole of a town.  You walk into this bar (I can't remember the name of it-it was 20+ years ago) and the people there all smelled bad, their teeth were rotted, a few were wearing eye-patches, some had a bullet wound or two, I even saw a peg leg.  And I'm only talking about the women in the place.    \n\nANYWAY: here's why I love my wife.... I convinced her to come to a dive bar (which is now my new favorite dive bar) I found on Yelp.  She went to the art museum earlier in the day without me and was going on and on about Frida Kahlo.  I wanted to give her an extra dose of culture (she trusts me on these matters, hence the deep love) so we dragged our asses up the hill. We walked into the filthiest of the filthy, grimiest of the grimy, smokiest of the smoky, ten seat (?) shit-box you'd ever hope to find.  \n\nWhen my wife (or any chick) walks into a bar (any bar) says, \"I can't decide what I want\",  that's her way of defaulting into ordering a cosmo.  A quick look around The Geary Club told me ordering a cosmo would get her ass kicked.\n\nRound One:\nI scanned the bar and saved my wife getting the crap kicked out of her and ordered her an amaretto sour.  \n\nLillian the bartender asks: \"What's in it?\" \n\nSo we got our 9 ounces of amaretto with a splash of sour and I got my Anchor Steam.  By now we had settled in and we were right at home having cocktails with Lillian. When I say having drinks with the bartender, I mean drinks with the bartender- she had 2 or 3 drinks of her own going and I have to guess she was on her fourth or fifth of the day.    \n\nRound Two:\nAfter peering the smoke to see what else they had behind the bar I saw the only other chick-drink-that-won't-get-your-ass-kicked Baileys and Bushmills.  Next round I got her about 5 ounces of Baileys with 4 ounces of a Bushmills float.  \n\nRound Three:  We came back after dinner (exceptional Thai just down the block) and Lillian asks, \"Are you drinking the same?\"  So she starts pouring a Baileys and Bombay as if people order it every day.

This was a huge relief for me as I was getting tired of the cramped smoking-room at the Hemlock. \r\n\r\nThe other wonderful thing about the Geary Club is that there are always middle-aged men who have the best wisdom free of charge. \r\n\r\nThe bartenders are great, especially Lily who is this German-born lady who I always picture in my mind eating a big-ass soup in a cup. Drinks are always cheap at this place and my only complaint about the selection of booze is that they don't carry Pabst Blue Ribbon but they have every shitty American beer that you can find in the grocery store. They serve Fernet, Ketel One, Jack Daniels, etc. but no Pernod. I guess the way it goes is that they ain't gonna switch up the way they've been doing things just because I happen to think Pabst is the best liquid I've put down my throat since I got weened off the teet. \r\n\r\nI still can't get over the fact that people in their 80's still go to bars to get drunk. I wonder what their one-night stands are like now that I think about it. Thinking about the great octogenerian regulars at the Geary Club makes me wish I didn't live in Yountville these days.", "author": "Nessim H."}

I heard the bartender's some kind a legend but didn't get the full experience while i was there. Actually.... i don't really remember much about the bar, except for its closet-ness and weird small glasses, but a good time was had by all. In the middle of the afternoon.

I order one of my usual drinks at a place like this - Bushmills on the rocks.  Nice pour at a good price!!!  The people were nice and the jut-box was playing proper tunes - what more can you ask for in a good dive?  \r\n\r\nAlthough I love the Night Cap, I'd have to put this hidden gem on par with it, in terms of dive bars in the TL.  It is small, so if you have a big group, you might stick with one of the slightly larger bars in the area.  Although how packed the place is, I'm sure depends on the time/day.

The regular bartender seems usually to be coming down from a heroin bender. But she's friendly and real. Bars like this are mirrors into the soul. You take a pull of whiskey, drag of a cigarette, watch the pretense slip away. This is you. This is your life, actually. I love this bar. The same way I loved my first car. It was a piece of crap.

Oh, and the drinks are strong and cheap. Ask for an ashtray and you get a piece of tin foil. There is a stuffed tiger head above the bar that looks like it was taken from a Disneyland ride.

No frills, no pool table, no specials - just a row of stools and the ladies keeping your glass full. Well, the jukebox is something frilled, I guess, but there's nothing on it from after, like, 1990. What satisfies is its utter lack of pretense, the happy hour prices at any hour, and the decor that changes seasonally but always includes one dusty and very unconvincing tiger head. Couple this with the lack of any sign indicating the name of the business (legend has it the sign caught fire, taking a nearby tree with it) and you start to see why young locals dub it \"no name\" or \"tiger bar\". But it's thankfully mostly youth free, just the normal neighborhood working folk getting off at 6 and staying until the limit's reached. Definitely a winner for the frugal, as you can get a G&T for under $3 and you never pay more than $6 for anything, even top shelf liquors.", "author": "Michael K."}
