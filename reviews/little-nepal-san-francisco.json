The momo sauce was good, could have had a little more pop and flavor to it though, maybe some salt.\n\n\nFor the tarkari, we substituted paneer for the tofu. As a paneer tikka masala fan, this was tasty and quite filling because of the creaminess. The green beans were a nice touch.\n\nThe bean dish was interesting and different with the bamboo shoots addition, but I'd say this dish was very light and delicious. Also, a more healthy pick.\n\nThe naan and rice come with order of an entree and the naan and rice we're done right.\n\nI'd recommended trying out this restaurant. \n\n\nExcuse the messy food/table in the photos!", "author": "Shruti D."}

All served as a great prelude to our main courses of Poleko Khasi (lamb) and Poleko Kukhura (chicken) - that was served beautifully. Lamb especially is a tricky dish to prepare as many times the gamey taste is too obvious but this was not the case at all here.\n\nThe service was timely, polite and courteous and the ambience was perfect.

Granted that I live on Market street and finding a parking can be a little tedious here,  i offered them a simple solution to the issue: I'd wait outside on the street when the delivery is on the run to save them from parking hassle.

It was the perfect blend of smoky, sweet and savory. The chicken was tender and perfectly sized. My stomach is stuffed but my tongue is still craving it. The lentil soup and curried vegetables that come in the combo were good, but not as fantastic as the main event.

There was a smooth chutney/sauce that didn't seem to go with anything, or maybe I may have done it wrong?\n\n* Rice pudding - perfect portion and end to the meal. Reminded me of horchata a bit.

My husband who doesn't tolerated any spicy foods couldn't stop eating it. My son finished the leftovers the next morning. \n- the Mismas Poleko Masu: had chicken, lamb and salmon. The dish was served on a sizzling plate. Although the meats were a little overcooked for my taste, my husband devoured it.\n- Tofu Tarkari: soft tofu with crunchy string beans in a creamy sauce.\nThey gave us free dessert, not sure what it's called.

I was so not in the mood for curry, but my friend was craving lamb so we hit up Little Nepal. Luckily they had much more than curry available... I got the prawns that came out on the hot plate. I could've chosen a la carte for $17.99 but I opted the combo $19.99, which came with white rice, a couple corners of naan, a mini side of lentil soup and a mini side of curried vegetables. The prawns and his lamb were a little tiny bit over cooked, which was partially our fault because they sat on the hot plates too long. Besides that the dishes were both very flavorful with saut\u00e9ed onions and cabbage along with the meat. So were the rest of the sides. I came with hardly an appetite and we both left after practically licking our plates clean, simultaneously. \n\nService was efficient. They were busy, but still approached us and sat us as soon as we walked in.  \n\nThe tables were clean, they had cloth covers, glass tops and even paper on top. \n\nI like this little place.

Their menus claim to be the first Nepalese restaurant in SF, but somehow I find that hard to believe.\n\nI had mixed feelings about this food. We tried the veggie momos, the nepalese chow mein, and then tofu and green beans combo platter. I would skip the momos and the chow mein - neither were great in my opinion. We substituted the tofu for paneer in the tofu and green beans dish and it was really tasty! It was basically their take on paneer tikka masala but with green beans as well! The combo plate is a really good deal for all the food you get! \n\nThe restaurant does serve sizzling platters as well so when we were there, it tended to get very smokey at times when they brought out one of those plates.

No? Well, I don't know you so who cares (shrugs). Anyway, I can count on one finger the number of times I've had Nepalese food since that trip. That finger was the Taste of Himalayas restaurant on Lombard, which turned into Shangri-La and then switched to Indian as Viva Goa. In fact, Little Nepal may be the only Nepalese place left in the city since Metro Kathmandu in the Lower Haight closed a couple of years back. That seems a pity since it's a hearty, tasty cuisine, a compelling melding of Indian, Afghan and Tibetan flavors that's quite unique.\n\nIt seems ironic how you have to trek to the peak of Bernal Heights on Cortland to find this hill station of a restaurant. Once you're inside, it's quite clean, modern and tranquil except for the 24-line bus that keeps rattling by. Jamie W. and I decided to take that bus for the first time from the Castro and discovered a whole section of the city we never traversed. I knew the first thing I wanted to order was the $6.99 plate of Himalayan Momos. Momos were what my sherpa and I ate for dinner on that Annapurna trek. Impressed yet? Oh who cares. Anyway, the momos here didn't look like the creased, overstuffed pillows of joy I remember.\n\nInstead, they looked like standard potstickers but much meatier with plenty of minced pork inside and a sturdy wrapper that tasted quite al dente. It came with an unusual chutney sauce mixed with chili and sesame oil (see photo). Jamie ordered as his entree the $16.99 combination dinner of Khasiko Masio Masu, which is a spicy minced lamb curry cooked with mushroom, green peas and spices. It came with all sorts of goodies - basmati rice, naan, a lentil stew, mixed seasonal vegetable in a broth, and more of that chutney sauce (see photo). It was genuinely good stuff.\n\nMine was a carnivore's delight and an overeater's dilemma - the $19.99 combination dinner of Mismas Poleko Masu. This is what Sizzlers would generously call a mixed grill special - chunks of tender tandoori chicken, Atlantic salmon and lamb, all of it marinated in olive oil, garlic, ginger and spice and nicely charred on a cast iron server (see photo). I also received the same delicious accessories as Jamie. Needless to say, we were stuffed with no mountain climbing imminent to burn away what surely must have been a high triple-digit calorie dinner. Out of guilt, we briskly walked down Cortland and then cut across Mission just so we could pretend some of those momos melted away.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...delicious Nepalese food, your only option in the city unless you go across the bay\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...hill station chic\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...smiling though their attention wavered when their regulars started coming in\nTOTAL - 4 stars...did I mention I've been to Kathmandu?

We don't have the opportunity to get together often since we live all over the Bay Area, but we were excited to finally catch up over some yummy Nepalese food in Bernal Heights.\n\nTo make things simple, we decided to order their set menu for 4 people, which we were told would be plenty of food for our little group.  We started off with their mismas pakauda, which was a fried spiced spinach and onion mix with mint sauce.  We all really enjoyed this dish and it was sort of like Nepalese onion rings.  Next came the Himalayan pork momo's, which were steamed flour dumplings served with a couple different sauces.  This was another delicious dish that I really enjoyed, and the dipping sauces were all really tasty and spicy.\n\nOur entrees consisted of alu tama bodi (a curry of potatoes, black-eye beans, and bamboo shoots cooked with fresh tomato, garlic, ginger, and spices), khasiko masino masu (minced lamb curry cooked with mushroom, green peas, and spices), and poleko kukhura (tandoori boneless chicken marinated in yogurt, ginger, garlic, and spices).  I really enjoyed the lamb curry and the vegetable curry was ok too.  The chicken was a little bit dry for me, but had good flavor overall.  Along with the entrees, we were served rice with naan, some lentil curry, and another side dish that I couldn't identify.  I didn't think it would be enough food, but it turned out to be quite a bit, and we were all very full by the time the rice pudding dessert came.\n\nThe food here is pretty yummy, but the service is something else entirely.  I actually thought it was pretty bad and there was a language barrier that made communication almost impossible.  Checking out was slow and we did our best to try to accelerate the process considering people had buses and trains to catch.  Overall, I think it's worth coming for the food if you're willing to be patient with the service and not ask too many questions.

Cortland Avenue's strip of restaurants and cafes is pretty cool, but who knew it was also home to the only Nepalese restaurant in SF?  Surprising, given they city's vast food scene, but apparently true according to Yelp.\n\nSince my friend and I were having Nepalese food for the very first time, we both wanted to try a variety of items.  We started with the Lamb Samosas and each ordered an Aanp Ra Dahi (Mango Shake), but we couldn't decide on what entree to get.  As it turned out, the Mismas Poleko Masu was the perfect dish for us - a sizzling platter of Tandoori Chicken, Atlantic Salmon, and Lamb (marinated in yogurt, olive oil, garlic, ginger, and spices).  Making it a dinner combination (instead of a la carte), the sizzling platter also came with basmati rice, buttered naan, lentil soup, mixed vegetables in curry, and a spicy dipping sauce.\n\nThe lamb and curry in the Samosas matched really well (though I could have done without the peas) and I liked how the dough wasn't chalky, but it was the size of each piece that impressed me the most (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Kx1WExNj5ogaFe0cyg9L6A?select=kHHFjcxOyoUuVt19RcYclg#Clv1Iljrd6k2ENruckjMPw).

The Tandoori Chicken was pretty decent overall (although a touch dry), but the lamb felt overcooked and dry.  The taste might have been okay, but I can't say for sure since I couldn't get past a couple of bites.\n\nAs for the side platter (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Kx1WExNj5ogaFe0cyg9L6A?select=kHHFjcxOyoUuVt19RcYclg#W_YJtWRC2JsR_rYQHMCatw), it was just okay.

It's consistently tasty with large portions for leftovers, and the option to order as a meal or a la carte makes the price a great value. Service has always been friendly, but questionably professional during my most recent visit.\n\nI drove by at 9:15pm with the intent of ordering takeout, since their hours state closing at 10pm. I noticed the \"closed\" sign on the front door, but there were still people inside...so I called to see if they were actually open. A younger guy answered the phone and I asked if I could place an order for pickup, and he goes, \"Yeah, I guess that's okay. The kitchen is about to close.\" So I took the yes and ran with it. While I was still driving around looking for parking, I asked him what the chicken curry options were and he goes, \"I don't know, we have a lot.\" I'm slightly irritated at this point because they don't even have a proper menu listed on Yelp, let alone have their own website, and I'm trying to take advice on what to order from someone who doesn't sound the least bit interested in helping me. I finally asked him if he could just wait for me to park and come in to look at the menu, which he said yes, but when I arrived and had questions regarding the differences between 2 of the dishes, he mumbled something quietly (which I still don't even know what he said,) and I just gave up at that point and ordered something random. I watched him interact with guests that were closing out their tabs, and he was completely disengaged with them as well.

Never had silky tofu in a curry before, but found it to be delicious!\nPalak Paneer ($13) -- Spinach and cheese cubes curry.  Very fresh ingredients and super flavorful.\nPoleko Khasi lamb ($16) - Lamb tandoori.  Great dish.  4 huge pieces of boneless lamb, tender and juicy.\nKukhurako Ledo ($16) - Boneless chicken tandoori.  I'm shocked it so recommended so often as while good, was definitely not the best thing on the table.  Chicken was slightly dry...\nHimalayn Momo ($7) -- basically Nepalese/Indian version of dumplings.

I stumbled upon Little Nepal (Himalayan/Nepalese cuisine) on Yelp and immediately thought it was Eskimo food because you know, Eskimos are from the Himalayan Mountains. I'm not even going to try to explain my logic here. :/\n\nWith a quick tap to Wikipedia, I found out that Himalayan/Nepalese cuisine is similar to Indian cuisine with Chinese influences. Lentils, curries, and tandoori are some common dishes. Ok, interesting enough to give it a shot. \n\nTucked along the cute Bernal Heights neighborhood, Little Nepal's contemporary and festive vibe with crisp white linens, shiny wooden furnishings, bright orange walls and colorful mini portrait quilts was a pleasant surprise. With seating for about 35 people, this cute restaurant was nice and cozy.\n\nWe started our Saturday night dinner with the Himalayan Momo ($6.85). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Kx1WExNj5ogaFe0cyg9L6A?select=Hcc-htAdOZs_JFtxw7PWCw The potsticker-like dumplings were steamed and served with chili, sesame and tomato chutney. The skin was a bit doughier than expected (I'm trying to stay away from refined carbs) so I just ate the pork filling which was packed with robust seasonings. I loved the accompanying aioli-like chutney which gave a fiery tang. Next, came the Tofu Tarkari ($10.35), a tofu and green been curry dish which was a lot SMALLER than anticipated. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Kx1WExNj5ogaFe0cyg9L6A?select=nouAWbMVfKn2dEB3Uj7CVw The mini silver bowl had only three fried tofu pieces and green beans swimming in a fragrant light tomato cream sauce with prominent garlic and ginger spices. The silkiness and tantalizing flavors of the sauce was purely addicting and a perfect accompaniment to the basmati rice and soft naan which I sneaked several bites of (SHHHHH!). As the aroma of sizzling onions permeated in the air, I knew our Poleko Kukhura (Chicken Tandoori -$13) dish was arriving. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Kx1WExNj5ogaFe0cyg9L6A?select=SbjYhwXJ-k7lAWOJLDOq0A Yelpers weren't lying when they say this is the \"best chicken tandoori\" they've had. Marinated in yogurt and spices and then grilled, the chicken breasts were succulently moist (from the dairy in the yogurt) with aromatic nuances of garlic and ginger. I could have scarfed down the whole platter by myself (SHHHHH! x2). \n\nService was friendly and attentive but rushed. Towards the end of dinner, our waitress asked us twice within a 2 minute span if we were finished when we still had food on our plates. My friends and I are fast eaters and I can understand if we were taking our leisurely time and if they were closing but that wasn't the case. \n\nI heart Wikipedia.

This was probably the most forgettable item of the night (probably because I eat dumplings all the time, so I really didn't care too much for it). It was moist and flavorful though! Next was the lamb samosa which was delicious! I usually skip samosa's because they're usually really dry and the seasoning seems to be off. However, Little Nepal is a game changer and I definitely hold other samosa's to their standards! Moist, seasoned well, and it was a pretty big looking samosa! Next was the chicken chhoila. My friend and I had no idea what this dish was and thought it was the chicken tandoori look alike item (it looks like it)! Had a nice flavor and the chicken meat was nice and moist. The entree was the poleko kukhura (which is very similar to chicken tandoori) but it was definitely as other reviewers mentioned... the best tandoori I've ever had! Seasoned perfectly and the meat was soooo moist! This was probably the highlight of the meal. Finally, the vegetable curry that came with the meal was the alu tama bodi, which reminded me of other vegetable curries... so it didn't stand out too much to me but it was good. The meal also comes with a rice and some other curries on a platter. Overall, the meal was good. I got kind of overwhelmed with all the different curries that kept coming... eventually some of them started tasting the same. Place is clean and my cup of water was constantly filled. The only thing I wish they did differently was that they told you what they put down on your table... my friend and I got confused on two of the dishes since they were both chicken and neither of us knew what was what! If you're looking to try food from Nepal, this is a good place to start!", "author": "Johnson S."}

Nice fresh, spicy flavor, not sweetened.\n\nThe Kukhurako Ledo Combination followed and we thought it was nice but not as outstanding as its price would demand.  The chicken was well cooked with a nice balance of flavors.  The portion was a bit small and the variety and complexity of the flavors could have been more outstanding.  The sides were very nice in particular the lentil side was quite good but again the portions were miniscule.  The nan and rice were disappointing.  The nan was flat, flavorless and chewy and the rice was incredibly watery.\n\nSaagko Tarkari A La Carte followed the chicken dish and we thought it was quite good.  Mustard greens were spicy and well cooked but again the price demanded it be more outstanding and unique than it actually was.  The rice and nan that came with the dish were the same disappointing, watery, flavorless, small portions that accompanied the chicken dish.\n\nOverall the main dishes were good.  The sides were very good and the nan and rice abysmal. The atmosphere was quiet with annoying repetitive music.

But in  no way does that take away from the friendly service or the delicious, authentic courses served here.\n\nTouted as the first Nepalese restaurant in SF (are there others?), it appeared that it's family-run. The space is minimally decorated but warm and inviting.\n\nFor starters, had the Himalayan momos, which basically resembled potstickers but with much thicker and doughier skin.  The spicy chutney sauce that accompanies it gave the dish a nice kick and added some Indian/Nepalese twist.\n\nFor entrees, the Kukhurako Ledo (boneless chicken cubes in a light cream broth with cashew nut, tomato sauce, garlic, ginger and spices) was delicious, especially the sauce which I ended up smothering over my basmati rice.  The Poleko Kukhura (tandoori chicken) was also quite good  and served over grilled onions and peppers.\n\nThey have several types of Indian beer (Kingfisher, Taj Majal and Flying Horse), all of which have a light, crisp finish that pairs well with the spices and the curry.", "author": "F.

We were on our way to dancing and I was anxious to get there.  I suppose this could be a pretty good date spot but the crowd was a little too Bernal Heights for me--meaning it seemed as if we were the only single people in there.  Everyone else looked like married locals who came in regularly.  \n\nThe decorations are also a little bit on the bland side.  It really does have the feel of an accountant's office that has been dressed up with Nepalese knick-knacks. \n\nAs to the food, I didn't really like the minty samosas everyone raves about.  Maybe it is because mint just reminds me of toothpaste and that is not what you want to be reminded of while eating.\n\nAlso, the choila that this place is known for just didn't do it for me.  \n\nThe seasoning just felt super bland to me--except for this slightly sour taste I could not put my finger on.\n\nIt might have been just me. Everyone else seemed to really love the food and it was a topic of discussion for a while.  If I ever come back, I will definitely have to try the chicken instead like my date did.  \n\nIn my opinion the service was a touch slow too as well, but maybe it was just because I didn't enjoy the meal.", "author": "Nikki K."}

This place serves authentic Nepalese food...period. I've read some reviews on this place and there are plenty that are way off base, the ones that say the food is bland and that they were expecting more flavor. It should be made clear to these reviewers that Indian and Nepalese food share similar ingredients but there is a difference. This is very good and certainly authentic Nepalese food. If it sounds like an Indian dish then it is one. If you come here, and you most definite should, I recommend getting the vegetarian combo to have a close authentic experience since in Nepal it's rare to have a meat dish on your thali but dal, veg and rice is plentiful. But if you must have meat, get the chicken chhoila (I was told this is an excellent version) and chicken or veg momos to start. The saagko tarkari (mustard greens) is spot on and so fresh tasting it brings back memories of preparing the leaves for cooking with my mother- and sister- in laws in Chitwan. We also had the Jhinge macchako tarkari (shrimp) though not a common dish, was well prepared and delicious. Service is friendly and relaxed. Don't expect to rush through your meal.

Skips all the heavy cream and spicy-but-with-no-real-flavor food you find in similar restaurants and gives you nothing but well-prepared and well-seasoned food. I particularly like this restaurant's momo.\n\n2) Complete meal options. In a lot of similar restaurants, you have to order lentils, veggies, rice, and bread separately from your main dish. You usually don't end up ordering everything because it's too expensive and you're left with way too much food afterward. Here, you have the option of paying a little extra to get a nice platter with a little bit of everything included. Thank you, Little Nepal, enabling customers to [affordably] order balanced, complete meals.\n\n3) Ambiance. From the traditional steel/bronze dishes to the background chanting, everything about this little restaurant exudes calmness and warmth. What a nice place to go to when you feel homesick.\n\nThis is going to be my go-to restaurant for my best and worst days. I recommend this place to everyone.", "author": "Sofia T."}

OMG.  A+.  When you order the combination, you get your entree and rice, naan, mint and tamarind chutneys, and two very small containers - one with vegetables, the other with dal.  Let me just say it right now, do yourself a favor and ask for a side order of the dal instead, especially if you're ordering for 2 or more people.  It is some of the best I've ever had...and it's not some generic style, either, it's Kali Dal (the best style you'll ever have, made with black Urad lentils).\n\nBut yeah, great deal w/ the combo for the amount of food you get.  You definitely get leftovers out of it.  The Kukhurako Ledo is like a combination of Korma & Tikka Masala...enticingly good sauce.

The bowls of the spoons are too deep, so you can't do that.  Result: precious soup residue left cold and saliva-y after every swallow.

Both of these items are unique and excellent. \n\nFor entrees the big crowd pleaser is the Kukhurako Ledo (like Chicken Tikka Massala, but BETTER), the Chhayau Tarkari (mushroom curry), the Machhako Mitho Tarkari (salmon curry), and Tofu Tarkari (Tofu curry) are all fantastic. \n\nYou should try this little Bernal Heights gem out immediately. The restaurant has decent enough surroundings and the wait staff is good, but I usually order take-out.", "author": "Yvette K."}

We started off with mo-mos and merlots and moved onto the entrees pretty quickly.   The hit  dish was definitely the Tofu Tarkari -- the tofu was incredibly soft and creamy inside with a perfectly chewy outside. It was drenched in an equally creamy tomato-based curry that put me over the top.  If you get the combo, it comes with naan (the best naan I've had in my life - crispy and buttery!!), veggie curry, lentils, and rice.  \n\nService is excellent and the owner of the restaurant is a super friendly, hospitable guy.

But maybe some of you are better at directions, or maybe my GPS unit took me through some backroads instead of the main route.\n\nAnyway the place was quite quaint.  Small restuarant, and there was no wait when we arrived.  We got there for a late diner, probably 9ish.  I was starved!\n\nThe meal started with appetizers:\n1. Momo - basically they're potstickers. We got vegetarian.  Potstickers.\n2. Samosa - My former roomate used to make these grea potato samosas.  I miss her cooking.  Anyway we got lamb samosas, and they were deeeeelicous.\n3. Choila - We got lamb. Basically lamb cubes. Garlic. Lamb and garlic is always good in my book. You can get pork or some other meat product, too.\n\nThen came the entree.  It came with rice, naan, some vegetable soup thing, some bean dip type thing, and we got some sort of other vegetable dish and a chicken dish.  I had a few bites and I was full.  The food didn't seem to come in really big portions, but I was good and stuffed.  We both ended up taking most of the entrees home.\n\nThey say Nepalese food is influenced by the foods around Nepal.  At least that's what they say on the menu.  And it's apparent, too.  I could just as easily have been in an Indian restaurant.  The food here is good and portions are plenty.\n\nThe verdict: A good place to bring a date.  Kind of like a more upscale Naan n' Curry. Just hope you don't mind smelling like the food after.\nFour stars for \"will come back for a nice dinnerdate.\"", "author": "Robert L."}

It's situated in the southeast quarter of Da City in the quiet, hilly Bernal Heights area. The dining room is small and simplistic but with enough alcove area to comfortably separate tables from diners. \n\nThe pork momo appetizer is always an ideal way to start the meal. I enjoyed wolfing down the goodness that incarnated itself in the Jhinge Machhako Tarkari. In Nepalenglish, it means King Size Tiger Prawn cooked with ginger, garlic, tomato and spices. My Lady N noted that her Khukhurako Ledo (Boneless chicken from clay oven (Tandoori) cooked in light cream, cashew nut, fresh tomato sauce, garlic, ginger and spices) was satisfying and tasty. Each of our meals came complete with naan, rice and a good mix of seasonal veggies. A reasonably priced (6 bones) crisp pinot grigio and a chablis both complemented our meals nicely.

The Poleko Kukhura was also ordered and apparently very good as well. You can order your meal a la carte, or combo (includes Basmati rice, naan, lentil, mixed seasonal vegetables and Chutney sauce). Getting the combo is only a couple dollars more and the sides are great- -also provides enough food for a good take-home portion. I recommend having the Talus Pinot; it goes well with all the flavors.", "author": "Yes P."}

Also the tofu totally melted on my tongue like little Himalayan clouds - I think it was the best tofu I've ever had. Yogurt on the side tasted like it had been made fresh, Naan bread, lentil soup were great, etc etc.\n\nI take stars off for the ambiance - the dining room was nicely decorated, but it was too brightly lit and I could smell someone mopping the kitchen during our meal (I have a thing about that).

When you look at it from the outside you think it looks fashionable and probably has good food, but a little too fashionable for the type of food that reminds you of your trip to Nepal.  However, when you step in you smell Nepal and feel a little like you are in a tea house.  They nailed it, and you haven't even had the food yet.  I felt so good inside that it didn't even matter what the food tasted like, but then I tasted the food.  The food is fantastic.  I have found that a lot of the times nepali/indian restaurants will control the taste of the dish simply through the curry.  However, at Little Nepal you could taste the flavor in the Lamb as well not just through the sauce.  The meat was well marinaded and the momo's were top notch.  If I were ever sophisticated enough to be able to open a Nepali restaurant in San Francisco this is what I would create.  I couldn't ask for anything more.", "author": "Harry B."}

I was introduced to this nifty little treasure by my co-worker on a friday evening. The next day, I had returned with some friends. Yup, you read that correctly - it was that good for me to come back two consecutive evenings. \n\nThe service is great. Space is limited, so I expected to have to wait for a table for hours. However, with a party of 6, we were seated within 15 minutes. \n\nThe food is wonderful. For appetizers, I've had the momos and samosas. Momos are aight, at best, sorta like nepalese pot stickers. The samosas are crispy burst of curry-flavor goodness. For the main entrees, I've had the Prawn Tandoori, Chicken Tandoori, and the Chicken Curry dish. All were intergalactically mind-blowingly delicious-alidocious!

I decided to order from them, thanks to the favorable reviews on Yelp. I already knew I'd be spending a little more money than usual for delivery, but it was surprisingly expensive for two people. The delivery took well beyond the estimated 45 minutes to get our food, which had, in the meantime, gone cold. Worse, the samosas had been forgotten from my order. I phoned the restaurant; the man who had taken my order remembered me. He said he would cancel the charge to my credit card and reprocess for a lesser amount. He even phoned back after he'd done so.\n\nSo now you know everything that went wrong. I wasn't especially angry or inconvenienced, and honestly, the gentleman at Little Nepal was courteous and helpful.\n\nIt was easy to see how the samosas had been forgotten; we'd ordered combination meals, and that made for several containers of food. Each combination dinner comes with sides of rice, naan, chutney, vegetables, and soupy lentils. Wow! I'm tough to please when it comes to rice and naan, and this was perfect.\n\nThe vegetables were wonderful, and the lentils were out of this world. We split orders of Kukhurako Ledo (that's Tandoori chicken) and Bhanta Tarkari (that's a spicy eggplant dish). The Kukhurako was, for the price, a little on the dry side, but it was delicious. The eggplant dish was stellar. Eggplant, of course, has a naturally spicy, slightly nutty flavor which, in this dish, was enhanced and complemented by subtle spices. Mmm! I'm a believer.\n\nWhile I'm not opposed to having food delivered again, I think next time I'll make the trip out and visit the restaurant proper.

Momos are little dumplings, sort of like rice buns or potstickers I guess would be the best way of describing them.\n\nIt helps if you recognize that geographically Nepal is located south of Tibet, between China and India.  So the cuisine is a mixture of Chinese and Indian.  Is it spicy Chinese or bland Indian food?  You be the judge.  \n\nI am sorry they don't have Jand, which is a homemade rice wine kind of like a unfiltered Nigori Japanese Sake, but a bit more sweet-sour and not as potent.

My gf & I hadn't been here in ages, so we decided to do the 2 person set menu ($45, though with two large beers, tax & tip it was $75.)  It didn't look like a ton of food, but we still came home with a small lunch for each of us.\n\nThe set menu features the three best known Nepalese appetizers: momos (4), samosas (2), and their special chhoila (\"barbequed lamb or pork marinated in mustard oil, with garlic, ginger, and chooila masala.)  The Chhoila turned out to be our favorite dish of the night, though the first piece of lamb I tried was so tough I had to spit it out.  The rest of the dish was fantastically flavorful - the chhoila masala is a great compliment to the taste of the lamb, and the whole thing is deliciously garlicy.  The momos and samosas were fine, but not as good as I've had at other Nepalese/Tibetan restaurants.\n\nThe entrees chosen for the set menu don't seem to be the best pairing: tandoori chicken and alu tama bodi - black eyed peas & potatoes.  Both were tender and savory in their own right, but I'm not sure I'd order them together again.  (It's worth noting that the chicken was still incredibly moist when I reheated it for lunch the next day.)\n\nThe meal finished with tiny dishes of sweet but soupy rice pudding.  It was tasty but a bit like drinking (coconut) milk with one's rice, rather than eating a firmer pudding.\n\nOverall, a nice experience.  I wouldn't come here all of the time as the prices seem a bit high for the amount of food and occasional lapses of quality.

It was described on the menu as tofu and green beans in a light tomato cream sauce with ginger and garlic. It came to the table as a fluorescent orange glob. The tofu was the soft variety (usually used to make sauces), which doesn't absorb any marinade or sauce, unlike the firm stuff. The tofu had a tough exterior and a mushy bland taste. The sauce must have been almost all oil. I couldn't even taste the tartness or sweetness that a tomato sauce would impart. Every bite tasted like fat.

I went again last night and it was even better than I remembered. We had the set meal for two, which came with three appetizers, two main courses, and a little dessert, all for $44 total. The appetizers were delicious, but by the time we finished them, we were pretty much full. I don't know how two people are supposed to finish all that food! The main courses were equally tasty, and since we brought most of it home with us I'll have the pleasure of eating it again tonight! The dessert was a sweet little bowl of creamy rice. Nothing spectacular but a nice end to the meal. \n\nThe service was really worth noting. Our waitress was so attentive and sweet.

Sure glad I did.\n\nThis is the second Himalayan place I have ever eaten at and the first one I have liked. San Francisco's only Himalayan restaurant is holding up their end quite well. I'm very familiar with Indian food and this place did a great job on the meats, they were  tender juicy and smoothly consistently spiced yet mild.  We shared appetizers vegetable samosa, chicken Choila,and  lamb Kukhurako Bhutan. Our favorites were the last two - chicken choila and lamb K. Bhutan. \n\nHowever, to enjoy the naan, as well as rice and some vegetable side curries (rather unremarkable) you must order an entree and get it combination style. I read the raves here about the naan so I tried it and wasn't sorry. Delicious with the chicken Ledo!  But who can eat all that rich sauce??\n\nThat would be me. We shared two entrees, the super rich creamy chicken kukhurako ledo combination (so I could get naan with it),  and tandoori combination of salmon, lamb and chicken, called Mismas Poleko Masu. \n\nWinners were both entrees! \nThe Ledo is so darned rich that you cannot eat it with rice, you fill up too fast. But it makes superb leftovers the next day - out of this world in fact.  \nPoleko Masu: Of the three tandoori-cooked meats, salmon was the first to disappear, lamb next, then chicken. Truly a meat eaters platter.\n\nI reccommend the lamb anything and the tandoori anything. Get combination style so you can taste it all, enjoy the buttery naan, and have enough to take home.\n\nIf you just get appetizers, you will fight over who gets to take the Choila and Bhutan lamb home. Better get your own. \n\nWe drank nonalcoholic beer to help it all go down and mint teas to help digest it all. Absolutely no room for rice pudding.\n\nI dont usually eat that heavily but it was mild enough and greaseless enough that I could. DELICIOUS. After a short walk, you will be in the mood for a little dessert.\n\nBeautiful courtesy and excellent service. Peaceful clean and  modern ambience. A popular place, a few families with kids, and some Indian couples. \n\nThis is a good place to introduce people with varied palates and spice tolerance levels to Indian style food because there is next to no chili. Flavorings are mild and balanced. My near vegetarian midwestern friend broke rank and devoured the lamb and my sushi-all-the-time manly friend devoured the tandoori salmon, chicken and lamb all with naan.\n\nStreet parking is challenging but possible.

We dined at Little Nepal for the first time on a very slow Sunday evening, so I can't comment on service or food quality on a busy night, but on the night we visited, the staff was very friendly, the courses were timely, and the food was super tasty. \n\nLittle Nepal is the best of three Nepalese restaurants I have tried so far. If you have not had Nepalese food before, the flavoring and spices will seem similar to North Indian cuisine and equally as savory. However, Nepalese food is lighter on oils and dairy, so I don't find myself as uncomfortably full as when I have eaten a number of Indian dishes. In addition to a number of excellent vegetarian offerings, Little Nepal serves chicken, lamb, prawns, and (okaaaay) Atlantic Salmon. There is a dash of Chinese influence as well - Little Nepal serves tofu and a chow mein dish. \n\nWe stayed vegetarian. The samosas were best of show and the Himalayan Momo (steamed dumplings) were wonderfully light, savory, and served with an excellent medium-spicy chutney. \n\nWe ordered three entrees for two people (one ala carte and two as combination dinners with naan, vegetable stew, and chutney. That was plenty and we arrived with an appetite. The mustard greens (Saagko Tarkari) were heavenly, and the potato/blackeyed peas/bamboo shoot (Alu Tama Bodi) and mushrooms (Chhayau Tarkari) were very good. Washed down with several tall bottles of Indian beer, we walked out of Little Nepal for $20 each before tip. \n\nThe decor is modern, but nicely done. We were very comfortable on a night when the fog was blowing in sideways down the Alemany Gap. Tell your friends (or keep it to yourself). Little Nepal is very, very good.\n\nFour stars instead of five not for any fault, but merely because this is a neighborhood family restaurant and as good as it gets in that category.", "author": "Scooby S."}

There were four of us so we decided to order two combinations and share, plus some appetizer.  We've ordered the Khasiko Pakuma (lamb) combo & Poleko Kukhura (chicken) combo.  We also had a side order of garlic naan...it was so delicious, we had to order another order of garlic naan...you gotta have this....it's nice and warm and the garlic and butter on the naan smells great.  The Chhoila (pork) appetizer was also yummy.  Everything we ordered was delicious.

There is a lot of Indian influence in the spices used. I would recommend starting with the Chhoila, which are well spiced cubes of lamb or pork (I prefer the pork). They cook it perfectly. The Momos, which are much like pot stickers, are also very good. For the main dishes, I've yet to have a bad one. My favorites are the Kukhurako Ledo (similar to chicken tikka masala) and the Khasiko Pakuwa (lamb in spicy tomato sauce). You can order a la carte (comes with Nan and rice)  or combo (Nan, rice, lentils, veggies and chutney). If you get the combo make sure you are hungry, cause it's a lot of food.

Napalese food is similar to Indian food with chutney, naan, cooking style but a lot less greasy and heavy. We ordered the following food to share: chicken momo, Chicken Ledo (combo), Chicken Pakuwa (a la carte), Lamb Masu (a la carte)  and the Tandoori chicken (combo). All entrees come with naan bread, rice and sauce and combos come with that plus salad, lentil (soup) and chutney sauce. The chicken momo is like a dumpling stuffed with chicken and comes with chutney sauce (not spicy.) The Chicken Ledo is sort of like curry with tandoori chicken cooked in creamed sauce. The sauce was excellent with rice and naan but the chicken was overcooked. My favorite is the Chicken Pakuwa (chicken cooked with tomato sauce similar to the marsala) because the meat was very tender and delicious. I normally do not eat much rice but I overate that night because the sauces were so delicious. The tandoori was a very tasty breast meat cooked to perfection with spices. The Lamb Masu was very tender (taste like Rendang beef) but it still taste a bit gamey. My other three friends loved this dish and ate everything even the sauce with naan bread. I do recommend the mint tea with ice for easy digestion.  The bill turned out to be $23.00 per person and it is worth every penny. I will definitely be back to sample more of it.", "author": "Allison H."}
