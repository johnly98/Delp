One of the best sashimi bowls I've ever had for one of the best prices I've ever paid. The people complaining about the price compared to other sashimi bowl places need to learn the difference between a poke bowl that needs a ton or sauce and toppings to cover up mediocre quality fish(that they end up charging the same for) and elephant sushi golden gate.\n\nTheir fish is so fresh, last time I went I saw them butchering a humongous bluefin tuna to portion out and turn into sashimi!! The rice is perfectly seasoned and warm, when you take a bite of everything alltogether it just warms your stomach and soul. \n\nMy gotos are the number 1 and number 4.#1 if I'm on a budget and #4 if I feel like ballin on a budget! For number 4 I'm used to paying 10 dollars each for the same amount of uni or monkfish liver but here you get a complete meal for the same price!\n\nDon't miss the dollop of wasabi they put in the bowl if you take it togo. You don't want to not use it at all(it's the good stuff not the green food coloring horseradish stuff) but you also don't want to take a bite and not notice you just ate a teaspoon of wasabi!", "author": "Conway W."}

The place filled up completely awhile later. I already had this restaurant bookmarked before finding out it participates in Skymiles but never got around to eating here because of the extremely limited open hours and the location (which ended up not being a problem). \n\nEven though there is a Yelp checkin offer for a free miso soup, it seemed like it was complimentary for everyone. You can help yourself to cucumber spa water, and they serve a cup of tea with your meal. The service was very friendly and accommodating. The chefs were quite jovial singing along to the pop songs while preparing the food.     \n\nNUMBER FOUR SASHIMI BOWL (Ankimo, Uni, Masago, Cucumber)\nThe presentation was beautiful. Uni is definitely an acquired taste that I haven't exactly acquired yet. With an interesting combination of bitter tones and soft and slippery textures, it had a decadent flavor and was not too salty. The rice steamed with kelp was delicious, deep with flavor but not too overpowering with salt or sugar. The glowing orange roe was salty (which I heard is a sign of quality). It had a strong hint of orange zest. Everything was just so tasty. Even the tomato slices were deliciously tart and fresh. The Ankimo p\u00e2t\u00e9 was so delicate yet so rich in complex flavor. It was fatty, savory, and bitter adorned by a bright and spicy sauce. The tuna had a beautiful color and fine texture and flavor. Getting this sashimi bowl was definitely worthwhile.   \n\nHAMACHI NIGIRI\nThe nigiri was a bit disappointing after having the bowl. I felt the fish didn't taste as fresh and was rather bland in flavor. Then again, I probably shouldn't have waited to eat this at the end.", "author": "Lauren H."}

I received 18 slices for my 6-item Sashimi Bowl ($18): http://bit.ly/1SVV782. I choose sake sashimi (2x), hamachi, ankimo, uni, and avocado. You also get to add complimentary toppings like garlic chips, jalapeno, cucumber, etc. All the fish were incredibly fresh and silky smooth. To get more bang for your buck, I would opt out of the avocado and choose another sashimi item instead. The garlic chips are hummus chips from the Hummus Guy at the Farmer's Market (http://bit.ly/1KnNDYT). Their like crack chips and an interesting topping to add for a sashimi bowl. My only gripe was the sushi rice was too citrusy, like it was accidentally doused with lime. \n\nDon't forget to enjoy Elephant Sushi's housemade ginger in the little mason jars which is super spicy and packs a good punch.

I've been trying to come here during their open hours and today was finally the day! The location itself is fairly small. It has 2-3 small tables inside, one large bench like table for 6+ people, and a table or two outside. This would definitely be a nice spot for a lunch by yourself on a workday or for a takeout meal. I can't say the fish quality is perfect but its decent enough for a MYO place and I love the flavors they use. The service is also really nice. I stopped by on a Thursday for around 11:30 and there were already a couple people ahead of me in line and by 12 a decently large group of people were lining up. \n\nI ordered 2 bowls and I'm glad I did because the portions are on the smaller side. If you are really hungry I'd suggest two bowls. If you are looking for a light lunch, one bowl is fine. I did one MYO 6 item sashimi bowl ($16) and a Number 3 ($12).\n\nFor my sashimi bowl I got uni, seared walu, salmon, ankimo, albacore, and hamachi. You get between 1-3 slices of each. They didn't do as much with additional flavors in the bowl since you choose your own flavors but I wanted to try the basic fish. The quality of the fish itself is decent for a MYO place. The salmon, albacore, and hamachi were average. They were all on the soft side and didn't have the crisp clean flavor of fresh fish but they were fine. The walu was a bit better though still not very flavorful. The ankimo wasn't very creamy but still retained some of its distinct flavor. The uni was the surprise. I've had a LOT of uni but something about today's uni was very different. It didn't have the typical sweet, slightly buttery taste, with the slightest bit of ocean. It was almost just buttery all the way through with the slightest bit of the uni aftertaste. I really enjoyed it and it was a sizable piece. Overall I'm being nitpicky, but in reality it's a solid bowl of food for only $18. On top of that the rice is wonderful. It was flavored very well and had the best texture. It also tasted like they used just the slightest bit of some form of citrus oil. Whatever it was, it was great. (4/5)\n\nMy second bowl was the number three which had seared walu w/ fried garlic pieces plus albacore cubes with fresh wasabi vinaigrette, truffle oil, and capers. This was an absolutely delicious combination of flavors. The fish quality was also average but the additional flavors more than make up for it. The fresh wasabi vinaigrette had such a nice bright flavor and it made the rice and fish incredible. I've had pickled wasabi before and this is like a toned down version of it. It also went really well with the truffle oil which can be metallic-y tasting but with the vinaigrette it tasted pretty nice. (4.5/5)\n\nOverall, I am extremely happy with my meal and I can't wait to come back. And as happy as I am with the fish I think I may love the rice even more, which may be a first.", "author": "Vivian C."}

However, during the holidays, the warden let us out of our work cubicles early, so I decided to seize the day and come here. I was right. It is tiny in here with no counter and about a half dozen tables of varying sizes. Only two were occupied, so I sidled into the two-fer table next to the front entrance.

I have not tried the food at the first location, however it has been one of my yelp bookmarks. Definitely excited to try Elephant Sushi regardless of the location!\n\nNewly opened for four months. Small establishment. Looks a bit obscure from outside, but inside it is modernized, chic and clean. Inside seating fits about 5-6 small tables and 2 tables outside. \n\nHas 4 different kinds of sashimi bowls. All priced at $12. You are able to customize your own sashimi bowl as well. There is a different price for your own bowl. The current 2 most popular sashimi bowls are number 1 (salmon, snow crab, avocado, \"walu butter fish\") and the spicy trio (spicy tuna, spicy scallop, spicy salmon & avocado). \n\nI order the number 1 sashimi bowl to-go and checked in on yelp to get my free miso soup! The wait time for my order was 10 minutes during lunch hour rush. Pretty reasonable time especially for this area when all the city workers swarm out for lunch. The lady who was ringing up my order was friendly, conversational and provided great customer service. She offered me a seat while I waited for my order. \n\nThe sashimi bowl was beautifully put together and fresh seafood. No imitation whatsoever.

The truffle oil didn't overpower the dish as I would have thought and liked the tart pop from the capers. \n\nTuna Nachos (believe that's the name) was surprisingly hefty and can be a meal in itself. Liked the balance of textures and the subtle heat notes in the tuna \n\nThe fish have a great meaty texture and refreshing light and flavorful.

So on a Friday when I really needed a lunch break, I walked down Larkin to pay Elephant Sushi a visit. On the way, I passed Mr. Holmes, the Chairman, and Soul Groove. But I held out and didn't stop until I arrived at my intended destination.\n\nHaving done my research, I knew I was supposed to stride confidently up to the counter and place my order before seating myself. The spicy trio sashimi bowl sounded delicious, so that's what I went with. Bonus: free barley tea for all customers, and if you check in on the Yelp mobile app, you can get a free coffee cup of delicious miso soup, complete with fresh shiitake mushroom slices.\n\nI sat at one of the outdoor tables with my order number and quickly received my tea, soup, and wasabi, as well as the condiment tray of soy sauce and homemade pickled ginger. Ahh, that soup was simple yet well executed. I'd come back just for the soup. And the tea was comforting and familiar.\n\nThe spicy trio ($12: $4 for each of salmon, scallops, and tuna) surpassed my expectations on freshness and taste. It also came with a couple of slices of avocado and taro chips (way better than the ones at Freshroll). Some rice was hidden under the pile of fish, accented with sesame seeds, seaweed, and a light ponzu sauce. I usually eat on the fast side, but I consciously wanted to savor every bite and took my time. The waitstaff who took my order stopped by and asked how everything was. I expressed my satisfaction and asked for a refill on the tea, which she happily poured after a few moments' wait.\n\nThe verdict: I'm gonna need to come by again. #Treatyoself and take a real lunch break here. I think I'll try the poke ($14) next time.", "author": "Tiff T."}

I stopped by on a lunch break maybe 40 minutes before closing time and they were out of a lot of items, but the lady at the cashier helpfully pointed out what was available on the menu and one of the sushi chefs offered to make a sashimi bowl for me on spinach since they were out of rice. \n\nI opted for the sashimi salad I believe is what it was called (it was right under the poke on the menu), and it did not disappoint. Beautiful presentation, fresh fish, and a solid portion. The orange slices added a great touch of juicy sweetness here and there. Plenty of nice big chunks of ahi tuna and salmon, I couldn't finish it all in one sitting. As I was eating one of the waiters also stopped by with a plate of two pieces of fish, I don't recall seeing it as included in my meal and I think maybe they felt bad for being out of a lot of things (I had expressed my desire for something with rice since I was so hungry) and wanted to make it up to me. Either way, it was delicious, some time of fully cooked fish that was very tasty. I appreciated it. You also get free tea with your meal!\n\nIt's a great little sushi restaurant with a good ambience for a nice lunch break or catching up with friends. I'll be back.", "author": "Rachel W."}

The first time I came here, I walked in about 10:20 and they said they weren't open yet. They said that they open at 10:30, even though it says they open at 10am on the yelp page. Even so, I waited until they opened. I got a customized sashimi bowl which was decent.\n\nI came back yesterday hoping to get take out to bring to work as my lunch. I came here 10:15am and AGAIN, they said they were gonna open \"soon\" at 10:30am. Again, I waited in my car and I came back in at 10:30am. When I walked in, the workers started kind of giggling and semi-laughing that I came back right at 10:30. The waitress said they were gonna open in a \"few minutes\"... which she quoted 10-15 minutes (which is not a few minutes) because \"there was something wrong with the thing.\" There was nothing wrong with anything. They probably couldn't wake up early enough to come to work and prepare everything on time for opening. Completely unprofessional.\n\nI hate posting bad reviews, especially for this reason. But I'm mainly mad because I could've gone to a different restaurant to get lunch instead of wasting my time waiting when she first said that they open at 10:30am. I had work at 11am, and I couldn't wait another 15 minutes or even go to a different place to get lunch.\n\nPlease change the opening time to 11am since your workers can never be prepared enough to open at 10, yet alone 10:30am.

Today however I had a doctor's appointment in the area and it make a point to stop in. This essence of this place is like what you would expect. Its small but yet has a hip and modern touch to it. Simple but elegant. I thought the tables with the ginger and soy sauce bottles were a really nice touch but maybe its the mason jars that called out to my southern roots. \n\nRegardless, the food was the bomb.com. If you check in on yelp, you get a free miso soup so of course I got a miso soup. I have much appreciation for miso soup that isn't stuffed iwth tofu. This one was unique in that there were plenty of seaweed AND mushrooms. That's right shitake mushrooms people. Usually you get like what 5 pieces of the smallest bits of tofu possible and then like 4 pieces of seaweed? This soup was packed with taste and mushrooms and seaweed. I believe regular price is like $3? but it was well worth it. \n\nFor the main dish, i got the sashimi bowl but pick your own 4 items. I got the salmon, uni, butter fish, and hamachi and subbed out rice for salad. For $14, this was a seal. You get like 4 or 5 pieces of each item and they were not these small little cuts either, they were of good size and well worth that $14. Best chirashi ever if you ask me. Very fresh as well. \n\nFinally they make their own ginger which was needless to say very fresh and delicious.

Not hunks of fish. but chopped up in a spicy dressing on bed of rice- tasty nonetheless. I thought It was  small portion for a lunchtime $14. Also, disappointed i couldn't use my free miso soup coupon. They didn't have any! It was just after 12 so I'm not sure of the reason, They weren't particularly friendly or informative.", "author": "Frank S."}

I jump on yelp and what do i find, they have a second location open for lunch which is less then 5 minutes away from my office...... SCORE!!!!!!! Have been to the lunch location on several occasions and it has not disappointed one bit. The fish is as fresh as you can possibly imagine. For a sushi lover I can not think of a better that I have EVER had fish that was as fresh as it is at either of these two locations. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend either of there locations for anyone who loves sashimi or raw fish.", "author": "Dmitriy G."}

It's a tiny little spot with communal tables and benches inside and a clean bathroom. There's some outside seating as well. I've tried a variety of their roles here and the only one that I really enjoy is their salmon one (I forget the name but it's pretty popular and there is a picture of it on their wall). Highly recommend that. Their miso soup is also good (even though it's pretty hard to mess that up!). I'll be back here for the salmon for sure and I do recommend it as a lunch stop.", "author": "Isabel B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-07", "description": "Wow! I did not know of Elephant Sushi from their other location. Wonderful that they opened in the Tenderloin. They are not associated with the restaurant formerly there, which was affected by a fire next door. (That place was not bad, but it wasn't at this level.)\n\nFresh fish, generous portions, nice decor, friendly staff. This is not a \"good for this neighborhood\" review. It's good. Period. Even in an upscale area, this would be competitive -- better than most.\n\nI had the bowl with four items. Avocado, uni, ankimo, and hamachi. Just great.\n\nThey pickle their own ginger and make their own shoyu (soy sauce).\n\nDefinitely a great new spot I will be patronizing.\n\nAn update. I have been back numerous times. This place is unbelievably good. It's so good, I don't know how they make money. The quality and the quantity is so much.\n\nPS But be warned. This is not a criticism of Elephant Sushi. It's more a public service announcement. Butterfish aka walu aka escolar aka super white tuna is a dangerous fish. Not just raw, but more generally. You can look it up. The little bit they give you as a starter is fine. It tastes fantastic and it likely won't cause problems. And this isn't specific to this restaurant. I'm just letting you know from the most unpleasant personal experience that butterfish should be avoided in quantities of more than six ounces. (I'd stay away from more than two pieces of sashimi or nigiri.)", "author": "Frank W."}

Loved the spicy tuna with the chips.  I also had the white dragon roll which I loved.  When you check in you get a free miso soup.  I tried some of my friends white out rolls which was also awesome.  Everything was so filling. They thought my other friend accidentally ordered shrimp tempura, which she hadn't since she's allergic, but they ended up making a roll out of it and giving it to us for free.  This isn't in the greatest part of town.  It smells like urine outside and then happen to look out as someone was urinating on the street to add to the stench.  All the signs on their doors, website, and yelp say they open at 10am.  We got there right at 10am to beat any rush and get a table so it wasn't busy but they told us it doesn't open till 10:30am!!  Was annoyed at this and asked them to change their signs and website but said they wouldn't.  Not great professionalism to me.  Beware, you may have to wait in the dirty TL till they open or walk around the lovely neighborhood :\\", "author": "Emily F."}
