I was kinda shocked to see someone go above and beyond. Also as i was picking up my green iced tea, I said to an employee \"i thought i heard my name called\" and he said \"yeah i thought i did too, and he went to the counter to double check for me and handed me the cup\". There are a ton of seats and I was lucky to find a place with charger. Great place to relax with free internet.\n\nDefinitely will be my go-to starbucks place once I'm in the area again.

Diffident and unexceptional service when I paid for my purchase with my Starbucks gold card but nothing prepared me for the snotty and unprofessional response of this same barista when she accidentally sprayed my MacBook Pro with caramel sauce while making a drink. Typically there would be a plastic guard to protect Starbucks' customers and their belongings from flying drink ingredients. After I visibly recoiled and started to try to get caramel gunk off the back of my Macbook, she offered an insincere \"sorry\" without any attempt to rectify the situation. I asked her if she had a napkin so I could wipe this sticky caramel goo from my computer and she actually pointed across the room to the stand with napkins and told me to walk over to get one.

In the promotion, if you buy a holiday drink by said date you will receive a sticker and when you get 5 stickers, you turn the booklet in and get your FREE GRANDE beverage. \n\nI was in the process of filling my card up, when I went thru the drive thru, when I realized that I had left my booklet in my husbands car. The sweet girl at the window said no worries and she gave me another booklet. She told me that I could combine the booklets for my free drink.\n\nAfter having a less than stress free day, I decided that a shot of free caffeine is just what I needed. I went thru the drive thru and I placed my order. I should note that before I placed my order, I explained to the girl taking my order that I had the sticker booklets. She asked me to pull forward to the window and to give Justin my booklets and then enjoy my drink.\n\nI pulled up to the window and I handed Justin my booklets. He looked at me puzzled and said 'do you want to buy another drink.' I said oh no thanks, its just me and I only need the one coffee. I was confused and thought maybe he thought that I wanted to purchase a coffee and get one free. I explained to him that I wanted to redeem the booklet and he told me that I did not have enough stickers. I said 'isn't the promotion valid if you have 5 stickers?' and he said yes but they needed to be on the same booklet. I told him about my earlier conversation about ending up w/ 2 booklets and described the cashier (what she looked like, the time of day etc) and he just looked at me and said your total is... He would not even get anyone else to help or see what we could do to remedy the situation. I just handed him my card, paid and left. He was not pleasant at anytime during our conversation and was giving me the stink eye, or maybe he had an eye infection, I don't know.\n\nAnyways I called the store to ask them what their policy was on the booklets. I spoke w/ a VERY kind and understanding employee named Matt and he said that he would honor my 2 booklets and was apologetic for the way that I was treated yesterday.\n\nI only took 1 star off my previous review, only because I think they should be clear w/ their employees when they offer promotions so that their is no confusion, and because of the rude way that I was treated. Justin could have just gave me a simple 'I'm sorry ma'am but I cannot accept your booklet because of X, Y and Z.' \n\nA big thanks to Matt for helping me out", "author": "VeeVee N."}

Central location, fairly visibly in the area. High traffic with the select stores in the vicinity. Great, quick, and knowledgable service. \n\nBasically, for a commericial take on coffee you get the name you pay for. McDonalds for fast food burgers. Starbucks for fast coffee, though Starbucks should be held at a higher standard than a fast coffee chain. \n\nMy regular order would be a carmel macchiato, seven pumps of vanilla, upside down, whip cream, and 180. Though I'd since revised it to a more pristine price to a tall coffee, whip cream, and carmel drizzle 180. Still adding the 180 through trial and error to hold that right temperature.\n\nI drove through to order, to my suprise they said they can't do the 180. Which I have never heard of before. Simply a change outside the norm, and its unfeasible for AJ to aquire that order. Maybe broken down to laments terms of extra hot could've I got my 180. Sad to say, I did not get my order in to my liking as well as not receiving my receipt. \n\nTheir customer service could use work, in particular that one shift I dealt with. I would recommend this to others, but with great hesitation. I can only hope for the location to get better and hold a high standard with its employees.", "author": "Michael D."}

Every venti iced drink except the macchiato gets 6 pumps of syrup/sauce unless otherwise stated by the person ordering. So when I say with white mocha instead of classic I expect 6 pumps of white mocha. Two days ago, the girl asked me how many pumps, so I told her. It could have been she just wanted to be sure, which is fine. When I got a refill, nothing was said or asked but for some reason I only got 4 or 5, not sure which but def. sure it wasn't right, because I get it all the time and it wasn't sweet like normal. Today, I got the same thing and the chick messed up in two ways. 1, she put both, AND she put seven pumps, so it was way too sweet. \n\nOnly reason I still come to this location is because its convenient and if they mess up, they will fix it so long as you say something.", "author": "Lucylyn G."}

Sure, I only order an iced coffee with my little customizations, but I have never received my drinks more quickly at any other Starbucks in San Francisco unless I personally knew the employees or there was no line, which is rare at 7:30-8 am in FiDi or SOMA.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-11-15", "description": "When it comes to Starbucks, I don't really expect too much... a standard atmosphere and a reliable Grande Nonfat Chai that I can get fairly quickly. This place underwhelms even with that low bar.\n\nI used to come here several times a week since I lived right across the way at Rincon Towers. However, over the course of a couple months, I finally gave up on it altogether and started making the farther walk to the Starbucks on Howard & Beale because this one was so bad. Let's review the transgressions.\n\nFirst, the speed is best defined as glacial... this place has set a new Starbucks record for slowest moving assembly line ever. I usually dropped in around 6AM, and there typically weren't many people and yet it would take them 7-10 minutes on average from the time I ordered to the time I walked out. This was mainly because chatty cathy the barista couldn't seem to realize her job was to make the coffee instead of wandering around aimlessly behind the bar talking to anyone who would listen. The last straw was when I missed my bus to work for the third time because they actually exceeded 10 minutes... at that point, it really was faster to walk the few blocks to Beale and order from someone competent.\n\nSecond, at least once every other week, they would get my order completely wrong and give me something else (usually a plain latte instead of a chai latte). Since I didn't have time to order another drink since it had taken them so long to get me the first one, I would have to suck it up and try to settle for that as my morning drink. Gross. It would be one thing if they just continually misheard me (which they did a lot, see point 3) but when I looked at the cup, it was usually marked correctly and the barista just didn't make the right thing. Really frustrating.\n\nThird, they never got my name right. I actually don't really care if they do but I mention this just for the amusement factor of the variety of different permutations I got... my name is Kara and, of course, I got all the typical mistakes like Carol, Karen, Caroline... but I think the best interpretation of my name was the day I got my cup and she had written \"Shay.\" All I can say to that is... seriously?! \n\nSo yeah, this Starbucks store is a fail. I've since moved and if you want to see a good Starbucks in action, the Polk & Vallejo one is where it's at!", "author": "Kara B."}

No other Starbucks I've been to asks this, and in such a weird accusing tone.  WTF. The first time they asked me this here, I thought it was just a bad mood barista or something. But I've been here 4+ times, and each time when I've went to get a refill for the road they ask \"Did you leave the premises at any time while drinking your coffee?\"  Weird. Now I can understand not giving refills to people saving cups walking around town abusing the system-chain, etc, but when the place is empty, you just bought the coffee from the dude 3 minutes ago, he watched you drink it in the shop, and he still asks this - - just stupid.  Apparently if you step just outside for 30 seconds to the sidewalk to get a newspaper to enjoy with your coffee, you're screwed and risk having security called on you.  Who are these people, the Coffee Nazis?", "author": "Jack H."}

They are fast, efficient,  friendly, and energetic.    There are several  Starbucks within minutes of each other, and it is worth it to walk the extra block, to go to this Starbucks.", "author": "tammy o."}

Just tried their Peppermint mocha today for a pick me up and damn it was good!  Well, service was really fast at this location and most of their staffs are friendly.", "author": "Josie K W."}

Longer lines, not enough of the right pastries. It goes to show what one incompetent can do, even at a strong chain. As a result of the mismanagement I now go to the Starbucks over on Mission. The new manager needs a some retraining; your selling coffee it ain't rocket science!", "author": "Eric R."}

At eight in the morning, when im purchasing a grande, I really dont need to be pestered.  Sorry pal, but you suck. 1 star for the classic sausage.", "author": "Buddy Garrity L."}
