No wait and we were seated straight away.\n\nSushi Time!!..\nAfter having gone through multiple reviews here on yelp we decided to order four rolls. Here are they in the order of agreed upon priority:\n1. Sexy Scallop: very tasty and the spicy albacore was so fresh and nice. \n2. African Spider: really liked the crab and albacore in it. The fried pieces in the middle of the roll were also good. \n3. C-2: very unique flavors. Liked it a lot too. \n4. Spicy Crunchy Roll: nice and fried roll. The house spicy sauce was amazing. I used it with some of the other rolls also. \n\nOverall an amazing time and we will be going back for sure, with more sushi lovers.", "author": "Nipun S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-06-06", "description": "I had limited time in SF and really wanted to get some good sushi for my last meal in town, but was really disappointed by Sushi Bistro. The ratings looked great but it's a shame when Yelp fails me.\n\nMy first impression was that the restaurant ambience was a bit disorderly. There was some sort of reggae/rock music playing and sports playing on TV. The plates on our tables were all different colors and sizes. Some were triangular, others rectangular, some were round, and some were curved upwards on the edges. My serving plate was blue and my boyfriend's was yellow. Visually, it made the experience a less appetizing.\n\nAs for the food, if you like avocado come here. We tried several different rolls, but I felt like each one was an avocado roll.\n\nDouble Jeopardy - This is described as a tartare, but I felt like I was eating a guacamole, that happened to have bits of fish in it. There was just so much avocado filling up the dish. I liked the use of the shrimp chips and the flavors I got when I wasn't eating mouthfuls of avocado.\n\nDrunken Halibut - The halibut was a bit overcooked for my liking. It was a very average dish.\n\nUni Nigiri - Very average quality uni. It's not bad, but it doesn't do uni much justice either. \n\nFive Wishes - The presentation was very unappetizing. The house sauce was all over the plate and it just looked messy. I appreciate that real crab was used, but this dish was almost inedible. Something about the flavor was just off. We just ate the salmon and pieces off the tops of the rolls. Again, there was too much avocado. It said that the rolls were topped but a mixture of fish, but two of the cuts were entirely topped with avocado.\n\nSashimi spirit - I did not taste the spirit of sahimi in this one. The flavors were bland. I don't think the soy paper enhanced the dish in any way compared to the traditional wrap.", "author": "Sany N."}

We came in for a team work dinner and were warmly welcomed by the staff as well as owner of the restaurant. Almost instantly we had an assortment of cold and warm sake at our fingertips. Side note: they carry a unique variety of craft beers if you're into that- we tried a sweet potato flavored lager. The staff also brought out a small kimchi dish and hot edamame. For dinner, we decided to go family style and order lots of different sushi rolls. It was my first Sushi Bistro rodeo but my teammates were seasoned professionals. We told the owner a couple rolls we had a good history with and then told him to surprise us with the rest. \n\nAll the sushi was out of this world.  \n\nI can't remember the names of all the rolls but one of our favorites was the Legacy roll. All the fish is extremely fresh and the mixture of ingredients melt in your mouth. The shrimp tempura roll was also spot on. We also enjoyed a poke seaweed salad which was also incredible. \n\nThe overall atmosphere was very very clean and the staff were more than accommodating.

It's definitely worth getting those dishes. The presentation is also very pretty. We didn't expect to get that much food, so we had to take the spider roll to go.

To be fair, the fish is usually pretty tasty, but the prices are definitely on the high end and the service is terrible. Last night my gf and I ordered a bunch of apps and sides (these were fine but nothing really stood out) and a couple rolls. When we received the rolls one was completely fried and tasted like garbage (who wants fried sushi anyways!?) When I told the bartender this is not what we wanted she just shrugged her shoulders and said there's nothing she could do. The manager then came over and said it was clear that what we ordered is a fried role (which is absolutely not true!) and made no effort to correct the situation. To add insult to injury we were charged full price for a roll we didn't touch and not one member of the staff said thank you for coming in. So yeah, I will definitely not be back and wouldn't recommend anyone coming here, esp with all the options in the neighborhood.", "author": "Andrew M."}

Don't get me wrong, sushi bistro is still good in my book. It's just a TAD pricey for what you get. They definitely give big portion for sashimi/nigiri here. I love their seared white fish nigiri - it's the perfect combination of Smokey flavor and tender richness. Salmon is good, can't go wrong. Though a friend pointed out to me that I might like it because it lacks fishy flavor - as in it is lacking any flavor. \n\nTheir rolls here are pretty innovative with a contemporary mix. The butterfish blaster that everyone suggest is just OK. Too expensive for a few bites of art. Can't go wrong with classics like dragon roll and spider roll. Love the salmon roll. My favorite here is the red devil!! It's made with brown rice but I think that extra chew from it actually makes it better. Topped with chopped fried garlic, super yummy. \n\nThat being said, I like that all their rolls are actually pretty different and interesting flavors.

I always have to remember not to order as much as other places b/c of their huge pieces.  They also have a great selection of beer and sake.  It's like a pub feeling when you enter the restaurant.  They don't have a great selection of specialty fish, but the classic ones are great and are giant.  \n\nI love the king salmon and yellowtail belly here.  They are giant and great quality.  I would say it's the best bang for your buck.  Their uni is local, which is not bad.  And of course they are huge.  \n\nThey come out with some specialty pieces on the weekends, but not a great selection.  I would go to Daigo instead for the special fish.  Sushi Bistro's \"fresh\" scallops isn't that fresh actually.  Scallops are hard b/c the average piece would have a fishy taste to it.  Their giant fried shrimp head isn't all that great either.  It's not fried that well that you can eat the whole head.  Other than that, the classic sushi pieces are awesome.  Their appetizers aren't that interesting.

Lots of options for rolls, including riceless, brown rice and veggie rolls, but nothing really special and somewhat pricey for the portion sizes\n\nI'll preface this review by saying that I was doing a Whole30 when I dined here, so what I could eat was very limited. That being said, the menu does have some options that can easily be made Whole30-friendly and is allergy-friendly in general.\n\nFor those not restricted by allergies or elimination diets, there's plenty to choose from on the menu: various rolls (classic, \"unique\", riceless, brown rice, veggie), sashimi/nigiri, lettuce cups, teriyaki, noodles, salads and appetizers. I loved the cute names they had for a lot of their rolls (like Nemo Found), but they mostly looked like any other sushi bar's rolls, aka a more-or-less random combination of fish with avocado and cucumber, maybe some other veggie, and some sort of sauce. Nothing super special or unique.\n\nI went with 2 of their riceless sushi rolls due to my dietary restrictions and found them to be just okay. I've had riceless sushi rolls at other places that were more inspired than just fish, avocado and cucumber, so I found their rolls to be disappointing in comparison and lacking in creativity. Also pretty pricey given there wasn't necessarily any more fish in them than a normal roll. The 2 rolls were in fact pretty much the exact same thing, just presented differently - one had everything wrapped in cucumber, the other had the fish on the outside. Unfortunately they don't have fresh snow crab, only crab mixed with mayo, so I had to leave that out of my rolls. Instead, they just replaced it with more avocado or cucumber.\n\n* BIG ISLAND ($14.95) - 3/5\n[salmon, tuna, albacore & tobiko, snow crab, avocado & sprouts wrapped inside a thinly sliced cucumber; no rice]\nCame with 6 pieces, which was a very small portion given it costed the same as the rolls with 8 pieces.

Fish/sashimi was pretty fresh but I've had better\n\n* FIVE WISHES ($15.95) - 3/5\n[snow crab topped w/ salmon, tuna, yellowtail, albacore & avocado, served w/ mixed greens and house creamy sauce; no rice]\nPretty much the exact same thing as the Big Island.", "author": "Jessie L."}

Honestly, I have no idea why it's been so hard and taken so long for me to write this review.  Despite having eaten here multiple times, I can never seem to get anything done for Sushi Bistro!  Maybe (probably) it's just me being lazy...\n\nCompared to my first trip here, when they were a tiny restaurant just a few doors over, Sushi Bistro has changed quite a bit over the years.  The space is larger, the look/vibe is trendier, and the menu is larger.  Yet, despite how much they've grown, their food hasn't changed.  Whether it's the rolls, sashimi, starters, small dishes, salads, or combo plates, everything looks and tastes just as good as before (from what my friends and I can tell, at least).\n\n-- AHI TUNA POKE SPECIAL - Cubes of Garlic-Soy Marinated Ahi Tuna served over Organic Baby Greens, Avocado, and Crispy Potato Vermicelli...$15.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=J6OS2QeY_TidZm1fXbP74Q)\nPretty good all around.  Not surprisingly, being a Japanese restaurant, the tuna was terrific (so fresh!).  I liked the texture contrast of the potato vermicelli as well, but I felt the sauce was a little lacking, both in quantity and flavor (specifically, it could've used some sesame oil).\n\n-- AFRICAN SPIDER - Tempura Soft Shell Crab, Fried Albacore and Salmon, topped with Avocado, Sprouts, Drizzled with a Sweet & Spicy Eel Sauce...$14.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=ApC9vqCx6aWCY2u1su9amw)\nMy favorite of the night, though they have better rolls.  The soft shell crab was fried up quite nicely (crispy!) and each piece was pretty meaty.  Plus, while I'm not usually a big fan of fried fish, it actually worked well in this case.  A little heavy on the sauce, which I found to be a bit sweet, but solid overall.\n\n-- NEMO FOUND ROLL - Salmon, Unagi and Avocado wrapped in Soy Paper and topped with Eel Sauce...$11.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=xSuhZo_7Uem9o8i4bWvvnw)\nMy least favorite of the night, unfortunately.  On paper, it sounded great, albeit simple.  However, despite how fresh the salmon was and how well it usually goes with unagi and avocado, the flavors seemed really light.  So much so that the eel sauce overshadowed everything else.\n\n-- SEXY SCALLOP ROLL - Spicy Albacore, Salmon, and Avocado topped with chopped Hokkaido Scallop, Tobiko, and Scallions in Soy Paper...$13.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=8kgQoull4U6MDktD4oC3NQ)\nWhile I generally like rolls with scallops, I thought this one was just okay.  On the one hand, the scallops were tasty (delicate, clean) and the salmon was great.  On the other, I could have done without the spicy albacore, though I'm generally not big on any \"spicy (fish)\" in my rolls.\n\n-- UNI NIGIRI...$13.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bistro-san-francisco?select=LXqVraMCyy7MkNJAvb7hxg)\nDelicious!  Each piece of uni had that bright, mustard coloring to them and were oh so flavorful.  The price seemed a shade high for what you get, but there's no question that it was good!\n\nAlthough my experiences with these particular rolls were rather mixed, I've had others in the past that were much better in comparison, such as the Butterfish Blaster, Sashimi Spirit, and the Hirame Fusion.  In addition, their lettuce wraps are worth trying as well, though I've only had the Summer, Fall, and Equinox wraps.\n\nAs far as service goes, I've never had any issues with it myself, but I can see why some find it rough/uneven.  However, what really stops Sushi Bistro from being part of my regular sushi rotation is the parking.  I don't hold it against them with their rating, since it's well beyond their control, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't something I keep in mind (desire to come back vs willingness to circle endlessly).  If there was a guarantee of finding a space though?  I'd definitely come back more often.", "author": "Mike L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-07-26", "description": "I came here twice in the last month. I have to warn you, this place has NO PARKING. I don't have much patience so when it comes to parking, and not being able to find one, it definitely kills my vibe. Although I try to keep my ratings independent of the parking, I would still like to share the pain in finding parking around this area. The first time I came, I rated this location a 4 star, and I loved the food and service. The second time i came, we spent about 20 minutes looking for parking, I would rate the parking a 2/5, saying downtown SF is probably a 1/5. \n\nWe ordered the genmai tea which was 1.5 each, out of a teabag. The tea is great, but service was bad. I had to ask every single time for the server to come and fill my tea. There was never a time where the server decided to check on my tea or us in general to see if we needed anything. It wasn't until when we were almost done and leaving did a nice korean server come by. She checked on us a couple of times and that was appreciated. \n\nThis time around, we ordered complete different items to try out their menu as a whole. We tried two different lettuce wrap, the Solstice and winter. Solstice was composed of diced ahi tuna seared, avocado, crunchy flakes and tabasco sauce for $6.95. Winter was made of spicy tuna, avocado, aioli and shrimp tempura. I have to argue that the winter lettuce wrap was more flavorful. I tried winter first then went to Solstice and it tasted very bland. Each of the lettuce wrap was a few cents off from 7 dollars. In my opinion, I fee like they are over priced for what they are. \n\nWe also ordered 5 wishes which was a popular item off yelp. \n$15.95 Five Wishes made of snow crab topped with salmon, tuna, yellowtail, albacore & avocado, served with mixed greens and house creamy sauce (no rice). I would rate this a 5/5. This was very fresh and I enjoyed the taste and texture of this. Beautiful picture as well. There was no rice in here. \n\n$14.95 African Spider made of deep-fried soft shell crab, fried albacore and salmon, topped with avocado, sprouts, drizzled with a sweet and spicy eel sauce. I think this was my least favorite because the stuffing inside was pretty thick and hearty. Felt very oily and a bit too much. It was also very salty in the middle too. I would say this is a 3/5. This was a bit too much for me in terms of how heavy it was. I did however enjoy the sauce in this dish. \n\n$12.95 Albacore Dream composed of spicy tuna and avocado topped with albacore, served with house special and spicy sauce. This would probably be a 4/5. This dish was pretty spicy, as it was topped with spicy tabasco like sauce on top. I did like the middle which was the spicy tuna and avocado inside. \n\n\nOverall food is great, service is highly lacked, and parking is horrendous. I would recommend coming here if you wanted some good sushi in the area, but I wouldn't necessarily drive all the way out here for this place as you'll end up being more disappointed.", "author": "Amy Y."}

I think it was breast meat. The teriyaki sauce was also a bit overwhelming. I wouldn't order this again.\n\nI ordered Crunchy ($9.99), which was a regular classic roll and not a Signature Bistro Roll. This was definitely delicious and not too bad for the price. This is a safe order. If I come here again, I'll try one of their Signatures next time.\n\nMy friend order a sashimi bowl and he loved it.

Good thing we arrived around 7:20 and checked in. We were able to be seated at roughly around our reservation time. We squeezed into a tight table that brought us closer to our neighbors than to one another and panned the extensive menu. We were greeted by an amazing waitress that seemed a little flustered with the busy night. We asked for recommendations but she was speaking so fast that we had no idea what she was saying... But no worries! I did research! \n\nI read that their African Spider Roll was pretty popular so of course that was going to be on our list! We also ordered the M&L and started with the gyoza. The gyoza was quite small, but it's an appetizer after all. It was sadly lacking the crunch though. The M&L was a huge roll! I had to split it in two in order to finish it whole. I felt like the fish was a bit over cooked inside, but the spicy tuna was great and definitely gave this roll a kick. Lastly, the African Spider Roll was definitely more exotic than rolls I've ever seen and rolled in the perfect bite size.\n\nI would recommend to make reservations before going and trying anything that you've never had before because I'm sure you can find it here!", "author": "Linda K."}

Unfortunately, we were missing one individual in our party who was parking the car even though he knew there would be four people dining. It would have been nice if he had waited until everyone was seated.\n\nLike Anu P stated, our party might have had the same non-smiling female server as when my wife asked what was popular regarding the sushi rolls, she could have done a better job of recommending some based on asking what our tastes were like.\n\nWe ordered the Butterfish Blaster which is a SB Favorite and our party agreed that this was pretty good if you like seared fish.\n\nAfrican Spider was nothing special as was the Monter in Law. Two of us ordered udon of which I had the Nabeyaki which was pretty good with the only exception being that the tempura was presented in the broth at the time of service which meant part of the pieces were already soggy by the time I pulled it out of the soup. A better way would have been to present the tempura on a separate plate.\n\nFinal rating is 2.5 stars for this lackluster dining experience.", "author": "Richard H."}

The sauce had a good kick to it and the spicy tuna was a great touch.\n\nM&L Forever:\n\"Spicy tuna, crabmeat, Cajun flavored albacore, avocado and grilled big eye tuna inside a crispy exterior drizzled with bonito sauce.\" These rolls were pretty big and tasty. I wouldn't have thought that Cajun albacore would be good, but it was!\n\nThe New Legend:\n\"Shrimp tempura, spicy aioli, avocado topped with seared albacore, spicy garlic sauce and scallions.\" The albacore was really fresh and I enjoyed the little bit of heat from the aioli.

I used my handy dandy Google machine and found out that butterfish is sometimes fraudulently sold as escolar. \n\nEscolar can cause many health problems apparently, so after telling the waiter that this is not what we ordered, he finally took it back.

Our waitress wasn't the nicest (no smiles, small talk or recs), but she was quick, refilled our waters etc. \n\nFood: Being a vegetarian, I'm always on the hunt for good veggie sushi. Sushi Bistro kills it with unique combinations and flavors. No avo-cucumber rolls here, folks. I got 2 vegetarian rolls (a little ambitious): Notorious VEG (fuji apple, inari, cucumber topped with avocado served with ponzu) and In the Sun (avocado, cucumber and mango wrapped in soy paper topped with thin sliced tomato). Both were fantastic - generous servings of avocado and since we were celebrating, I had them use the white instead of the typical brown rice they put on veggie rolls.

The atmosphere was very hip and upscale. It was very easy to carry on a conversation.\n\nHad the Butterfish Blaster roll (the sauce!), Spider roll (not as good as other places- wish there was more crab and it had been fried longer for crunchier texture), Monster In-Law roll (tos of meat), Summer lettuce wrap, a bunch of Nigiri (including ocean trout omg), and Suigei (drunk whale) sake.

I decided to try this place out because it's close to my boyfriends home. We get here on a Friday and it is DEAD. I mean TWO other people in the entire restaurant. A women with a huge Herpes sore on her mouth seats us and walks away. She then returns and I'm already having a bad feeling as her hands graze our condiments that she sits on her table. I order: a rainbow roll/ salmon/ ikura w quail egg/ toro/ and scallop hand roll. Now as a avid sushi water I can tell you if the most expensive sushi doesn't taste good then \" it ain't fresh!\" The food was SO disgusting I couldn't even finish any of it. Between me and my boyfriend we only ate 20% of the food because it was THAT BAD! The waitress (who only came up to us twice and spent her remaining times laughing and talking with the other workers) came to grab the food and as I expressed my concern she was very rude to me. She also never even took our order and I had to get up myself and tell the chefs what I wanted because she wasn't doing her job. After we finished our beer we waited for our absent server and ended up going to the front to pay. I asked if DAVE was the manager and proceeded to telling him how we hardly ate any of the sushi and it wasn't fresh. Not only did he begin shouting at me as I remained calm and talked to him about my concerns, but he even assured me that the fish was fresh (I assure you it WAS NOT) and charged us the FULL PRICE about $88 for BAD FISH we didn't even eat. He then proceeded to balling up our receipt when my boyfriend handed him the card. When I asked for another receipt he printed one stapled it together and threw the stapler and handed me the receipt in a rude forceful manner. Now I'm going to tell you something. I HAVE WORKED IN A RESTAURANT. It saddens me when you calmly speak to staff about a problem and they do NOTHING TO ACCOMMODATE you. Instead they are rude and inconsiderate. When I was a server I went above and beyond to understand someone's complaint... within reason. To fully charge us when we obviously didn't like the food as we didn't even eat any, to give such poor service when there are only 4 people in the entire restaurant, and lastly for the manager to act extremely rude and unprofessional gives this place 0 stars. I will say one thing the sushi chefs were really nice. It's not their fault that they are serving old sushi. I'm not doubting the reviews here but if your a serious sushi water who knows the difference between crap and fresh (obvious difference) then this place is NOT FOR YOU.", "author": "Gigi M."}

On a cold San Francisco evening, it seems a little weird to meet up with friends to have sushi, but this girl loves her sushi! \n\nWhen I walked in the door, I told the hostess I was meeting about 4 or 5 of my friends for dinner. She was rather rude to me, looking at me like I didn't belong. Then said they weren't there. Then said \"There is a group around the corner\". Kind of confused, I ended up finding my friends.\n\nWe were waiting on a 5th person to arrive who was running late, so we decided to order drinks. They have a pretty nice selection of beers, wine, and sake. I ordered beer, one of us ordered hot sake, and the rest had wine. \n\nOur server kept coming back to see if we were ready to order. She was rather rude about it as if we were taking up a valuable table. By the time our 5th friend arrived, only 20 minutes had passed so it wasn't as if we had been waiting for an hour. And there was a good crowd in the restaurant so it wasn't as if they were losing money on us sitting at a table having drinks. \n\nWe placed our order and the food came out fast. Probably the fastest I've experienced from a sushi restaurant. Because my rule of thumb on trying a new sushi place is to order the spicy tuna roll I ordered that and the unagi. The spicy tuna roll was not too spicy and not too mild and the tuna was really really fresh. With the unagi, you receive 2 pieces and they are huge and really really fresh. \n\nAfter dinner ended, we ordered more drinks so we could spend more time catching up as we all hadn't seen each other in a while. However, after we had been there maybe another 20 minutes after our plates were cleared the server was growing anxious to get us out the door. She gave us our bill and told us that we could only pay with 2 credit cards (apparently they only allow 2 credit cards per table) so we had to split the bill in half and pay each other using Venmo. Which is not a big deal, but the restaurant should have a sign up front letting customers know their credit card policy (if they do I did not see one).\n\nAll in all, it was a positive dining experience. I would give 5-stars but the attitude of both the hostess and our server dropped it down to 4-stars.  Usually I do not complain about service unless it is horrible, but I do think that if you're going to work in an industry that serves the public, you should at least try to be upbeat and nice.", "author": "Erin W."}

We learned from our experience and will remember to assign time to the agonizing and impossible task of finding free street parking in SF at dinner time. I think what made it especially hard was that Sushi Bistro is located in a neighborhood and not main commercial areas so most of the cars on the street on a weekend would probably never move because they belonged to people who lived in the area.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered 3 rolls - the Omega 3 (good sauce but I found it to be kind of a weird texture in the middle), the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (really good but not as unique as some of the other rolls that Sushi Bistro offers - tasted like a good dragon roll). My favorite roll of the night was the Spicy Scallop - it wasn't too spicy and definitely wonderful for scallop-lovers like myself. The scallops were so soft! \n\nI would definitely consider coming back here.

We sat at the bar, which was comfortable and highlighted by a bartender with fantastic facial hair. Asahi Kuronama (Black) was delish; tried a sip and was amazed. Really enjoyed the velvety and rich flavor, not overwhelmingly so, without a bitter after taste. \n\nLoved how many options there were and their unconventional roll names. We tried the Albacore Dream and Five Wishes. I wasn't particularly fond of the first; it tasted fine, but no sparks flew. The sauce was a bit weird too, but it wasn't a typical roll, so it it could be that its creative parts didn't quite pair up as well as they could have. Was pretty happy with Five Wishes' super fat slabs of sashimi - I should have just ordered nigiri or poke, being such a sashimi fan. Something was off though! Maybe the lack of rice? But I've have sushi without rice... The interior texture of minced crab was an odd contrast to the slippery sashimi as well.\n\nWe had our waters refilled twice over the course of an hour. My empty glass remained that way for at least 10 minutes, which is not happening when I've added one dab too much of wasabi. \n\nAt the end of the night, my friend and I looked at each other and asked what the other thought of the meal.

THREE THUMBS UP.\n\nAlthough really unique and tempting with all the creative combinations of sauces, components and flavors they offer, not all of the special & unique rolls are perfect...I love the Butterfish Blasters roll (snow crab meat and avocado wrapped in butterfish torched with a garlic-soy). Such a tender roll with a rich blast of flavor. But I warn against the Hot Love (baby lobster, avocado and crab meat rolled in  snapper, baked with spicy sweet sauce). Sounds so good on the menu...but it is drenched in thick, overpowering orange sauce, the \"crab meat\" inside the roll is fake, and I don't know what is wrapped around the outside but it has a really rubbery texture...the whole roll is just overwhelming and wrong. Order unique rolls at your own risk!\n\nThe menu also includes vegetarian rolls, brown rice rolls, signature rolls, small plates, teriyaki, udon, and salads. \n\nYou will swoon over the sashimi (and non-ridiculous wait for a table unlike at some tiny sushi establishments).", "author": "Jessica C."}

In this case, Sushi Bistro made sushi still feel like a treat!  \n\nI asked about the sauces, and they immediately brought over the gluten-free tamari that so few restaurants carry (yay!) and were able to confidently direct me to which rolls would be safe.  The rolls I ordered were DELICIOUS and the service was fast and friendly, super professional.  The music is played at a regular volume so you don't have to yell (I remember it being a bit loud years ago), and best of all, they let my friend and I sit there and talk for SO LONG.

So here it goes...\n\nI came here for a dinner date with my favorite boy. We didn't have dinner reservations, but luckily there was a table available for two. Like most restaurants in San Francisco, Sushi Bistro was really small in size. I think they could have used bigger tables, but oh well...we made the best of our tiny table for two. \n\nWe ordered a total of six dishes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TmXkYM0N-FjrMasxj5uXsA?select=7g90tMXSX7R64KLstEG2yA) and two beers each. What I really didn't like was how our table was so small. We couldn't fit all of our food and our waiter was really terrible with pacing. He kept bringing out plate after plate and I felt very rushed. There was literally no space on our table and instead of giving us some time to enjoy our food, he would stand at our table and wait for us to rearrange the plates somehow so that he could fit the next plate.\n\nOn a lighter note, the sashimi and rolls were fantastic. My most favorite roll of the night was the butter blaster (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TmXkYM0N-FjrMasxj5uXsA?select=FhSDQZYwjvHQ6-gflkFGcg). It was the most tasteful roll I have ever had. It consisted of snow crab meat and avocado, wrapped with butterfish. The butterfish was very rich and soft--I just couldn't get enough of it. I also really liked the yellowtail belly (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TmXkYM0N-FjrMasxj5uXsA?select=BFanUmX0bKFu2R0IpLJh2Q); it was the most rich tasting sashimi I have ever tasted. Don't get me wrong, everything was absolutely amazing, but those two were the highlight of our dinner.\n\nOur bill came out to be a little over $100, which was fairly reasonable for the excellent quality and taste of the food. \n\nP.S.\nCheers to my 500th review! ;D", "author": "Lien T."}

Tonight was the straw that may have broken the camel's back.  I made reservations for 7pm for 2 people.  I arrived right at 7, but my friend was having trouble parking so I had her pick me up and we circled the block one time and found parking.  We were seated by 7:10 and ordered quickly.  I ordered a small Sapporo, and we got some edamame (thank God).  We also ordered three rolls and an Unagi Nigiri.  The Unagi, beer, and edamame came right away, and my friend and I settled in and started catching up.  And we caught up for at least 30 minutes before we finally realized our food was no where to be seen and the tables to our left and right ( who had arrived well after us) were being served.  I finally got the attention of an employee, who \"went to check\" on our order.  A couple of minutes later out waiter comes over and says that our ticket was lost, but they are making our sushi now.  No biggie - this happens sometimes, and we are enjoying catching up.  They then bring out our Watermelon Man, which is delicious as usual.  And then we wait....and wait...again, as our neighboring tables receive even more food.  Finally our second roll comes, and a few minutes later our third.  We finished our meal, and then waited, again, for the check.  Two HOURS after we arrived the check comes, and NOTHING is comped.  Are you serious?!?!   I've had it at this point.  We signed the bill and I (stupidly) still tipped 20%.  On the way out though I did stop the manager to say that I was disappointed.  And the response?  Not \"oh I'm so sorry - let's take care of that, you should have been comped something\".  A half hearted sorry, with a terrified look on his face.  Seriously.  Maybe you don't recognize me, but I come here often, and I order take out regularly and bring friends here.  \n\nYou made us wait for an HOUR for our food - it is a given that you should comp SOMETHING.

What I totally loved was how little rice the sushi had! This allows you to taste all the flavours and none of that glutenous rice taste. This in itself would bring me back here. The choices are amazing and the combination of flavours, although sometimes unusual, melt so well into each other. New age sushi for the adventurous palate.\n\nI have forgotten the names of our rolls having changed our mind so many times before the waitress took our order. But what I remember so well is the Hawaiian Breeze, something I would never usually go for fish mango and apples with cilantro pesto, oh my! Brilliant absloutly brilliant. Everything else was just well put together. \n\nNow what I don't like about the place is the smell of heavy musty air inside and the swarm of fruit flies by the door. They really should work on that. We almost walked out if the place didn't look clean. Still rather a turn off. Also when we asked for a price of two fish pieces, we could swear the waitress said $6.50 not the $8.50 charged.

Really cute place for a date or just dinner with friends. \nI always get: \nFive Wishes - super yummy. Fresh and doesn't have rice so it's perfect for low carbers ;)\nSashimi dinner- has all my favorite fish and comes with soup, salad, and rice. Always very very fresh. \nOyster- we always get at least a dozen oysters. They are SUPER yum, fresh and I believe $2 an oyster which isn't too bad for a sushi place. \nAlso every time I come, I tell the chef to surprise us with a few different fish or sushi. He always does a great job at that. I've tried a lot more and everything is absolutely great and fresh!\nI would suggest making a reservation as it gets pretty busy in the evening especially thurs-sunday.", "author": "G O."}

But we were very impressed by the quality of the food and the attentive service. They are there at every turn! And they all help each other out. You can ask any server/host/bus person and they will help you. We like that, and coupled with the good food, we keep coming back.\n\nBecause we were so comfortable in this environment, Sushi Bistro is where I first ventured out and tried eating seafood. And now I eat raw fish and sushi rolls all the time! \n\nIt does get busy so make a reservation if you don't want to wait. My fianc\u00e9 and I don't usually make reservations because we like to get there right when they open at 5PM. \n\nWe always sit at the bar so that we can have Skip, the bartender, be our main server. We love Skip; he is a great, attentive server. We used to come just because the food is so fresh and delicious but now we come because of the service.\n\nThe other servers are good too but they come and go. Skip has been there since we've started dining there and so has the host, David.\n\nTo the food! What we order everytime:\n\nAppetizer:\nGyoza\nMagic Mushroom\n\nMain:\nRed Devil\nC-2\nNew Legend\nYellowtail Basil\n\nSashimi (Our Dessert!):\nSeared Albacore\nNew Zealand Ocean Trout (melts in your mouth!!!! oh so-good!)\n\nWith one appetizer, four rolls, and two orders of sashimi, along with our drinks, it usually ends up being about $70-$80. \n\nWe travel to Sushi Bistro from San Jose. We'll drive up to San Francisco just to eat dinner here and then drive back home... we've even done it during weekday rush hour traffic. That's how much we love it.\n\nWhat we don't love. Parking. It is a residential area and all the residents are back home and not going anywhere at dinnertime... it can take up to 30 minutes to find a parking space! But that's just something we have to put up with! \n\nLove Sushi Bistro!", "author": "Linh F."}

We also had the jalapeno yellowtail, which wasn't exactly up to Nobu standards, but was still delicious. They have a decent sake menu, with probably 5-7 nigori choices (my fave), which is kinda rare.\nI expected to be paying big bucks at a hipster sushi place in the middle of San Francisco, but prices were totally affordable. I think for 3 of us to eat the nigiri special, sashimi special, yellowtail entree, salads, edamame, pitcher of sapporo, and bottle of sake, it was like $120.\nOnly bad part: parking.

The service was excellent, but the food was not so great.  We ordered the gyoza, the scallops, and a roll.  I would have ordered a combination box, but the thing is they don't offer it here. That's a first...  The plating was pretty nice, except my scallops had some things on it that were questionable to me.  It appeared to look as if the whiskers from shrimp had been plucked and put on the scallops as decoration.  Cool right?  Well not if I'm allergic to shrimp.  Oh well, no big deal.  I just picked them off and ate it.  The scallops should be called \"Soy Sauce Scallops\" because they were overpowered with some type of salty sauce.  The menu said they were \"seared\" but i felt and tasted no sear at all.  As for the gyozas, they were not crispy, but felt soggy. \n\n As for the check..they added a sushi roll that 1) we did not order and 2) they don't even sell that roll anymore.  Epic fail.

The sushi never tastes heavy, and the flavors never just mash together.  Each roll has a unique and light feel and taste that surprises me with every visit.  The menu goes far beyond your normal rolls but does not just go wild for the sake of it.  A tried and true taste is present in each option that always seems to just work perfectly.  I always get the butterfish as an appetizer and I have yet to be unimpressed.  \n\nUsually just good sushi would not warrant a 5 star rating, but combine this with a fun and upbeat atmosphere, and then pile on lighting fast service.  I have been there just as a group of two and also as a group of 5.  Every time the restaurant has been packed and every time the appetizers, drinks, and rolls come out quickly and with almost perfect timing.  Appetizers finished? Plate cleared, a minute or two of talking, and all of the sudden the next roll is there.  The service is great and it is not just fast, it is well timed regardless of the volume they are experiencing. \n\nSeriously though, get the Butterfish", "author": "Greg M."}

After finding out that a nearby sushi restaurant that we wanted to go to was closed, we decided to try this out since there were a good amount of positive reviews. However, I came away with negative thoughts about this place.\n\nThe customer service is pretty bi-polar. You walk in and are greeted by someone who is very enthusiastic and happy to see you then you get seated and the waitress just has a sour attitude and rushes you while you're trying to decide what to have. You could see that she was annoyed and took it out on us (even though we didn't do anything).\n\nEverything was sticky. The chair was stuck to the floor, the chair was sticky, the table was extremely sticky. It felt like someone spilled soda all over the place and no one cleaned it. Something you don't want to see at a restaurant..a dead fly in our water. Disgusting...\n\nThe menu was a bit unclear. We thought the \"something unique\" was sushi because it wasn't clearly marked, but those are appetizers. We got the Double Jeopardy, which was--unique, and it tasted really good. It was like asian guacamole. It was guacamole with fresh fish and shrimp chips. We also ordered the Albacore Dream, Sexy Scallop, and the Watermelon-man. My favorite was the Albacore Dream. The mangos in the Watermelon-man were hard and the Sexy Scallop was a bit too spicy. The fish is probably fresh and delicious, but it is hard to tell because the fish in every dish is masked by all the other sauces and flavors that they put on the rolls.\n\nThe food is definitely on the expensive end ($10-15) for a standard roll. I probably won't be coming here again..", "author": "Kevin H."}

Since by definition, there really is no such thing as a sushi bistro, I had my doubts, but those fears subsided once I took a quick look on Yelp and found a four-star rating.\n\nThe place took reservations, which is sometimes a rarity in the city. There's a bar and then like a row of tables alongside one wall. There are also more tables in the back, although I didn't see how many, but I took a quick glance when going to the restroom. \n\nI guess no one eats at 5:30 except for me in the city, so we were immediately seated. They brought us some green tea, with teabags in the cups, which made me wary because you only see that in non-Japanese-owned establishments. Speaking of which, I looked behind the sushi-counter and didn't really see anyone who looked Japanese. Oh well, with almost 1,000 reviews and a four-star average, I had to trust in the system. \n\nFor three of us, we just kept the rolls coming. What was great was that we would order one or two at a time and when they were brought out, we would order another, but there were not huge lulls in between. They came out at just the right pace and our waiter/host was really nice, and then I learned he spoke Mandarin when he was talking to the table next to us, which kind of threw me for a loop. So we got the following:\n\n1) african spider   12.95 (NOT A FAN, THERE WAS SOMETHING WEIRD ABOUT THE SAUCE AND THE WAY IT WAS FRIED, PASS!)\nsoft shell crab, sprouts, tobiko, deep-fried cajun albacore and salmon topped with avocado, eel sauce, and spicy sauce.\n\n2) monster in-laws   12.95 (WAS SUGGESTED THIS OVER THE YT JALAPENO, AND IT WAS GOOD)\nchopped spicy albacore, cucumber topped with yellowtail, jalapenos, spicy and ponzu sauce.\n\n3) rock'n roll   8.25 (ALTHOUGH NOT A ROLL, IT STILL CAME IN 8 PIECES AND WAS MY FAVORITE OF THE MEAL)\nbaked spicy scallops served on top of a California roll. \n\n4) 49er     8.95 (ALWAYS LOVE THE REFRESHING COMBINATION OF SALMON AND LEMON)\navocado and tobiko topped with salmon and lemon.\n\n5) aloha 101   9.95 (REALLY PRETTY PRESENTATION WITH THE SUSHI, MARRED BY WHAT DK CALLED LEFTOVER RAMEN SOUP BASE FOR THE DIPPING SAUCE. I DID NOT LIKE THE SAUCE AND FELT THAT IT RUINED THE DISH WITH HOW IT LOOKED AND TASTED. PLAIN OL' WASABI AND SOY SAUCE WAS BETTER)\nahi tuna, mango & cucumber wrapped in seaweed, flash-fried, served with spicy garlic sauce.\n\n6) butterfish blasters   13.95 (ORDERED THESE BECAUSE OF ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS, BUT NOTHING REALLY SPECIAL. GOOD, BUT WOULD PROBABLY TRY SOMETHING NEW NEXT TIME, AS OPPOSED TO GETTING THIS AGAIN)\nsnow crab meat and avocado wrapped in butterfish torched with a garlic-soy\n\nI think we had one more order, but I can't remember what it is at this time.

We've been back since then and still have never had to wait for a table. Keep in mind we eat a little earlier than the dinner rush hour.\n\nThings we've ordered:\n- Sexy Scallop Roll ($10.75) - Salmon wrapped in rice and soy paper topped with scallops.\n- Albacore Dream ($10.95) - Spicy tuna and avocado topped with albacore.\n- Omega 3 ($8.95) - Fried Salmon, cucumber, and avocado topped with salmon and albacore.\n- Monsters In-Laws ($11.75) - Spicy albacore topped with albacore and jalepeno.\n- Spicy Crunchy ($9.25) - Yellowtail, salmon, snapper, shirmp, and macadamia nuts deep fried.\n - African Spider ($12.50) - Cajun flavored albacore, salmon, and soft shell crab.\n- Salmon Sashimi ($7.90) 4pc.\n- Hokkaido Sea Scallop Sashimi ($11.90) 4pc.\n- Tempura Appetizer ($7.95)\n\nThe Sexy Scallop is by far my favorite roll. Salmon and scallops are my two favorites and this roll has both, so what's not to love. The sashimi here is ridiculous. The slices are HUGE and the quality of the fish is actually pretty good. The Omega 3 Roll is also very good as is the Monster In-Law and Albacore Dream, which my boyfriend really likes. People seem to really like the Spicy Crunchy roll, but we weren't that impressed with it. I'm not a big fan of deep fried rolls though, so I guess I'm kind of biased. \n\nOverall Sushi Bistro is the kind of place you go if you want creative rolls. If you're looking for traditional sushi, this is not the place to go. Biggest complaint is that the tables are only inches from each other. Each time we've been we've felt like we were part of the other tables conversation. But if you are looking for something creative and tasty for around $70 you can get 4 rolls, an appetizer and some sashimi.", "author": "Eifeh S."}

This was where I had lemon and soy sauce on raw scallops for the first time and it was excellent.\n\nThe rolls aren't that great. The Billie Jean, supposedly baby Lobster with fresh avocado, cucumber and wrapped with soy paper and aioli and topped with salmon tasted like a California roll with a slice of salmon atop of it. To be fair, I substituted seaweed for the soy paper since I'm not a huge fan of soy paper. The African Spider was good, but I get a similar spider roll in most other places.

Nothing wrong with those types, but it's refreshing to see a new take on sauced up maki rolls.

They have really creative names for their dishes by the way. The garlic-soy dressing combined with the freshness of the butter fish melts right in your mouth.

If you enjoy mushrooms this is a fried mushroom medley with a hint of sweet and spicy flavor. \n\nThe reason why this place is not 5 stars is because the maki/rolls were not on par with their sashimi/appetizer/small plates. It might be the ones I ordered but I tried 3 different rolls and they were all meh.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-01-11", "description": "I am a purist when it comes to sushi and the food here was disappointing.  Their shari (sushi rice) was lame.  I mean the presentation was fine--of adequate size, and styled--yet the fish (hamachi, toro, maguro) was not of high quality and therefore tasteless.  My uni was beyond fresh so had lost most of its cat-tongue texture (I KNOW it grosses some you out, but that is part of the discrete and essential charm of experiencing urchin gonads!) and was just this side of edible.  I ate it anyway, because it was expensive, I was hungry, and our servers were so nice.\n\nMy friend's nigiri fell apart when he lifted it from the plate.  Sticky rice is supposed to be sticky; it's really the unsung star of any sushi experience in my book, holding it all together and imparting those slightly sweet and sour, seaweed-ish under notes against which all manner of delicate fish meats seem bright.  It should be made with dashi, of which there are different kinds.  Dashi can be made from kombu (dried kelp), katsuo-bushi (dried bonito flakes), niboshi (dried small sardines), hoshi-shiitake (dried shiitake mushrooms), and more.  Sorry, but we just started laughing!  We did not like the rice.\n\nSushi Bistro signature rolls are the reason to go there, though.  Colorful, creative and made for an American palate they come rolling out at just the right temperature in the arms of a good-looking and attentive staff.  I had a hard time finding ones that did not have deep-fried fish bits or \"spicy\" (what you do with fish that is no longer sushi grade) hashed with mayonnaise mixes included, though.  The ratio of fish was notably weighted towards the roll on all three selections we ordered but, again, we were trying to avoid the gobs of fish-flecked mayonnaise and batter-fried mascots of the deep adorning all the tables surrounding us.\n\nWe've been here a few times before, mostly with friends from the East Bay who buzz to SF specifically to fill-up with the hip and friendly Sushi Bistro crowd.  We usually order a bottle of cold saki, the names of which I can never remember.  This time, the two of us split a large hot (house) sake--yuk ... swill.  Oh well, I'm not a sake connoisseur and some things just taste better when you're enjoying them with friends.", "author": "Vicki O."}

From the moment we sat down, an unhappy waitress comes to us and ask for our drink order, proceeded by food order. We must have ordered 8 items (rolls, sashimi, gyozas). The sushi rolls were pretty good and the sashimi was tasty but the \"idle\" time in between when the dishes came out was a bit disappointing. We were done with one plate and then sat there twiddling our thumbs until the next dish arrived. Given our tables weren't big, the dish size was huge which took a lot of room. Mind you the sushi or sashimi didn't require so much platting space. The waitress would shove one dish to the other and request that we hand over the plates that were done. Why didn't she just lean in a grab it herself? Ain't like the table is big anyways. \n\nNow the part that got me worked up was when we received the bill. The restaurant charged us for a roll we simply did not order OR receive! This was the Billie Jean roll. Now if you read the description of the roll, one who did see or eat it will know they had it because it's much different than your everyday roll. We did not have no roll that was wrapped in soy paper, that included baby lobster and topped with salmon & lemon! We told the waitress we did not order or get it. She hands the bill to someone and a RUDE ASS sushi chef or whatever that A-hole wants to call himself comes to our table adamantly claims he brought out the roll along with another roll. He then puts down the bill hard on the table and walks away. WOW! Are you f-cking joking with me? Who does that? We sat there with a blank face because we couldn't believe that just happened. We didn't want to make a scene since we were celebrating an event so we went ahead and paid for the freaking bill including the stupid mandatory 18% charge for a party of 5. Mind you, we would be fine with paying any \"mandatory\" fee if the service was up to par. \n\nNeedless to say, I will NOT be coming back here or recommend this place to ANYONE.

I showed up in an attempt to fulfill a sushi craving after watching a documentary on a famous sushi chef. Unfortunately, the sushi at SB did not match up. Instead, what I found found was lackluster quality and forgetful dishes.\n\nWe got a mix of rolls and nigiri so I can say it wasn't limited to a single dish or item. Some of the standouts bad dishes:\n\nThe uni lacked texture and was watery, possibly suggesting it was thawed from a frozen state? The other fish we had was mushy too, for a lack of a better adjective.\n\nI took Yelp's suggestion and ordered the Hot Love dish (baby lobster with avocado and crab meat). The dish sounded good but in actuality, it was stringy and there was way too much lemon. In fact, I got a big bite of rind in my first bite.  \n\nOverall I was quite disappointed by my return visit.

I was fine with it, but my friend didn't like it at all. I wouldn't order it again.\n\nMonster-in-law Roll - I like it spicy so this was perfect for me! Has sriracha and a jalepeno on top to add a little kick to it and the roll itself was packed nice and tight and packed with such intense delicious flavors! One of the best rolls I have ever had!

You get the more Americanized feel to it (this didn't matter to me at all). \n\nThe rolls are definitely not your traditional rolls. I will definitely be back for the red devil and probably be interested in trying other rolls. \n\nI did not like the spider roll at all it just tasted I was eating a cucumber roll. The spicy crunch was good and I might possibly order that again. The M&L was okay. The reason I may think that the spicy crunch and M&L were okay because I usually like rolls that have the raw fish on top and have more of a moist taste (if you get what I mean). M&L and spicy crunch were more on the fried side.\n\nI wish I could rate closer to 4.5, this is just due to the spider roll. Sushi bistro I think you can do so much better!

The selection of rolls is outstanding.  From the ubiquitous California roll and spicy tuna roll to the more adventurous sexy scallop roll (spicy white tuna, salmon, and avocado topped with spicy chopped scallop, tobiko and scallions:  piquant and yummy) and the big island roll (salmon, tuna, yellowtail  tobiko, snow crab, avocado, and sprouts wrapped inside a thinly sliced cucumber:  absolutely delicate and delicious) diners will not be disappointed.  An unique selection of non-traditional appetizers does not disappoint:  jalapeno hamachi sashimi, ahi poke, and seared branzino (sea bass) with daikon were all super.\n\nThere is a good selection of premium sakes, including the fresh, clean Suigei and the sweet, melon-like Otokoyama, as well as hard to find Japanese beers like Echigo in addition to the normal Sapporo and Kirin.\n\nService was super-fast and friendly.

At the end of the night when we asked to split the bill, she reacted very harshly when we were trying to reason a good way to split it. They only allow two cards per bill, and one of us had cash while the rest had cards. We simply asked her to take the cash that one of us had and subtract the amount of that meal, so we could accurately figure out how to split the rest (tax and all) fairly among 4 of us while only using two cards. She REFUSED to do so. The whole ordeal lasted 5 times longer than it should have because of her incompetence to best serve us, the customer. It would have been one thing to politely say that she couldn't do that or didn't know how, but NO she sternly replied and was very very disrespectful.

There were no Asians eating here, which got me a little worried.  Why is this place so crowded?  It's because of the Butterfish Blasters.  It was the best roll that I've ever had.  It comes in a family of 6 and has plenty of fish and sauce so you don't have to ruin it with soy sauce.  The Hot Lava had two pieces so it was hard to share with more than two people.  The lemon at the bottom was a nice touch and balanced out the crab and squid on top.  The sushi rolls are about the ingredients other than the rice.  I didn't feel too full from the rice but from the actual fish.  They go light on the cream sauces here too, which I appreciated.  The Monte Carlo also had butterfish but it was not as good and you can't really taste the brown rice.  The Sexy Scallop roll was ok but I would not recommend it.  The agedashi tofu was lightly battered and perfect. I'd come here just to eat the Butterfish Blasters and the tofu.  \n\nOur waiter looked like someone from Moby Dick (probably b/c of his mustache) but he was nice and efficient.

The baked scallop topping on the rock & roll was really heavy with mayo and made the rest of the roll soggy. The soft shell crab in the spider roll had a mushy, unpleasant texture in the inner portions of the roll. \n\nFor the purists, Sushi Bistro satisfies with its EXTREMELY FRESH sashimi. Wow, talk about good. REALLY GOOD. Melt in your mouth, decadent, sinful, creamy good. We've ordered the 12-piece sashimi platter and we eye each other nervously over how many pieces each person eats. The best fish is the Butter Fish, the white fish nestled in the middle of the sashimi platter. True to its name, it's like butter in your mouth.", "author": "Monelle A."}

I want to hate places like this from the outset. But after two visits here, I'm clearly impressed with the service and the quality of the food. I would classify this place as the default sushi place one would go if they didn't want to think about somewhere new to try and just want something good and satisfying to eat. \n\nThe clear standouts for me are the 12 piece sashimi platter and the \"New legend Roll.\" I've been told that the best sushi should stand on its own, without any type of soy sauce, and that when you bite into it, it should simply \"melt\" with each subsequent bite. This is that type of sashimi. Added plus for being generous with the portion size. \n\nThe spicy garlic sauce and scallions adds great flavor to the seared albacore in the New Legend roll. I also love the crunch that the shrimp tempura provides. \n\nEven the standard miso soup and side salad with Japanese dressing are good. They also provide very good (and complimentary) sweet pickled cucumbers to start the meal.", "author": "Lael A."}

Pretty standard.\n\n7-flavor Albacore Salad - seared albacore with seven spices served with fried onions and green salad.  I LOOOOOOVE albacore so therefore I loved this app.  This could also serve as an entree\n\nMonster In-Laws - chopped spicy albacore topped with yellowtail, jalapenos, and spicy ponzu sauce.

I'm not a fan of tempura though.\n\nM&L Forever - spicy tuna, crab meat, cajun flavored albacore, and grilled big eye tuna inside a crispy exterior drizzled with bonito sauce.

I really liked the African spider.  It was very flavorful.  The sauce really helped.  The Hawaiian breeze was good.  I found it very refreshing with the slices of fuji apple.  The monster in law was good too if you like spicy foods.  I think the rolls could have been better had they used more sauces to liven up the flavors.  I liked how they didn't load the rolls with tons of rice.\n\nOne thing I founds pretty interesting on the menu was that they offered brown rice rolls.  It's a healthier alternative.

It's changed locations, waitstaff, decor, etc.  But it's still kind of suck.  Yeah.  It pains me to use such poor English but there's no better way to describe it than suck.  \n\nI got some nigiri: Amaebi, uni, hamachi-toro and hotate-gai.\n\nIt was just after the restaurant opened for evening service.  The interior of the restaurant was painted all black and had that sexy-in-a-bad-way vibe.  The bright sun outside overpowered the subtle mood lighting inside and made me feel like I was a salary man in Tokyo, sneaking in a snack at a panty shack before heading home.  If there was a dancer on the bar top, it would have completed the mental image.  I was a bit ashamed to be eating there.  Alone.  \n\nMy nigiri arrived in 3 parts.  The first was the hotate-gai.  Not bad.  But not much flavor either.  It's a plus when the nigiri does not smell like over-ripe seafood.  But it's a minus when there is no flavor at all.  I could have been eating vegetarian agar atop rice.\n\nSecond came uni and hamachi-toro.  The hamachi-toro had some knife work on top and a little squiggle of extra fish.  But the fish was not tender.  It was not melting.  I had to use both hands to tug apart the slice of fish as I bit into it.  The power of chopstick kung fu alone was not enough.  Something akin to gristle prevented my teeth from cleaning separating the two bites.  I was left with have a slice of fish hanging out of my mouth.  The uni was also not flavorful.  The dim lighting prevented me from admiring the color and texture of the uni.  I attempted to ascertain the freshness by squinting at it while holding it so the light from outside fluttered in.  When I ate it, there was no burst of intrigue.  I cannot say what it was.  Except it was suck.\n\nLast, the amaebi.  I appreciate that they gave me three instead of the usual two due to the small size of the shrimp/prawns.  But the heads were not battered, and the whole thing was dowsed in this sharp brown sauce that overpowered everything.  It was too strong, too salty, too sour, and it got everywhere.  \n\nI gave up on that sushi meal.  It was disappointing.  The whole experience was unusual and surreal.

Both Five wishes and butter fish contained no rice in the roll, making for protein-rich bites. \n\nComplaints: \n- The snow crab described in the menu was HEAVILY mixed with an egregious amount of mayo, giving it that ultra creamy texture. I personally did not like this Americanized kami. \n- Brown rice didn't look or taste like brown rice.\n- Tuna was not fresh\n- The overall taste of the rolls didn't come together very well; just one thing overpowered another.\n- Fuji apples are always awesome, but I was a bit...ambivalent on how it played out in a sushi roll. The sweetness offered an overbearing flavor so that the final impression is how sweet the sushi roll was, and you could hardly taste much else. It adds a nice crunch though.\n\nPositives:\n- Simple and elegant presentation.\n- Rolls not overpadded with rice.\n- Decent number of rolls and size for the price.

(Because once a week is how often I would prefer to eat sushi :] but anyway...) Rolls range from about $8 - $14. We were a group of 6 (5 adults, 1 child) and we couldn't decide on what to order for the life of us. Soo, this is how our ordering went:\n\nWaiter: what would you like?\nUs: What are your favorite 3 rolls?\nWaiter: Well, the [blahblah-insert names]\nUs: Can you just order us 10 of your best rolls?\nWaiter: Sure, anything you guys don't eat?\nUs: No california rolls!\nWaiter: Ok, any allergies?\nUs: Nope.\nWaiter: Do you like spicy food?\nUs: Sure!\nWaiter: Okay, I got it.\n\nWell let me tell you that was the start of a good good night!

It is crab meat and avocado wrapped with butterfish. Made a unique and tasty combination that had great flavor and texture!\n\n2 - Original ML ($11.50): Very good and not even on the menu!!

I think if it would have let it cool I would have liked it better.\n\n5 -Hamache Kama (9.50): had yellowtail inside of it.\n\n6 - Monster in Laws (11.75) This one had some albacore, yellowtail, and even jalapeno in it. \n\n7 - C-2 (11.95): Another favorite of mine! This one had stripped tempura on top of the roll and eel sauce dripped on top, too!\n\n8 - Watermelon man (8.95): It looked like a watermelon piece, how cute! Also, had some mango and macadamia nuts inside it!\n\n9 - Aloha 101 (9.95) - A really original roll. Very fresh tasting and it came with a garlic dipping sauce.\n\n10 - Rock n Roll (7.95) - Not your usual Unagi and avocado rock n roll. This one had baked scallops on top of california roll. I've had this roll better at other restaurants, probably wouldn't order it again.

You can get a spider roll anywhere, but this one's on crack and I'm addicted!!!\n\nBy the way, did I mention the complimentary cucumber salad prior to dinner?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-06-11", "description": "Sushi Bistro is definitely worth a try, but I'm hardly impressed. The food, while tasty, is overpriced (the average price for a roll being at least 12-13 dollars). The swanky, trendy-bistro-in-the-Marina feel gets a little tired, especially when you're in the Inner Richmond and just want a chill dinner with a friend to catch up and are trying to converse over the loud club music blaring in your ears. Also, there is always, always a wait so it's recommended that you drop a friend off to put your name on the list while you circle (for days) looking for parking.\n\nIf you do find yourself in this part of the city and have a hankering for a modern, fusion take on sushi, though, I do recommend these rolls: \n\n- Five Wishes: (tuna, salmon, hamachi, albacore) and avocado wrapped around a creamy snow crab mixture. It's rice-less and because it is, every piece is soft and creamy and sort of just melts into your mouth.)\n- Rock and Roll: Essentially a California roll baked/topped with a creamy scallop mixture. The scallops are tender, the sauce has a delicious, tasty kick to it, and at only $7.50 (possibly their cheapest roll), this warm delicious roll is a winner.\n- The New Legend: Your standard shrimp tempura roll that's dressed up a little prettier and topped with seared albacore. Solid, reliable, delicious.\n- The C2: Pretty much the same as the New Legend, another reliable roll with familiar components that people always generally like in fancy rolls (lobster, tempura, eel sauce). \n\nThere's also brown rice rolls, a vegetarian section, and a unique list of appetizers that is interesting to try (with names like \"Magic Mushroom\" and \"Butterfish Blasters\" - how can you resist?). \n\nSo,it's good, but there's just that certain je ne sais quoi that's lacking. I've yet to try anything really outstanding enough to garner the sometimes ridiculous wait and worth the nightmarish attempt to find parking (I know, not necessarily the restaurant's fault, but it is what it is and it does matter sometimes). They do get points for innovation/an attempt at fusion cuisine. While fusion is usually a hit or miss, I find that SB falls somewhere in between that. \n\nDecent, but not amazing. Almost, just almost, Sushi Bistro.\n\nOh, side note: one of the waiters/servers here is super cute - he's tall and Asian (Chinese, I believe).

Over 1000 reviews and 4 stars means they're doing something right. Right?\n\nI want to start off by saying that sushi bistro is definitely more fusion and catered to american tastes. Most sushi places (that I go to anyway) are typically fusion and not authentic japanese...but this place was really Americanized. Small restaurant with dim lighting for dinner. We came at about 6:30pm and there wasn't a wait for 2 at the bar, but it was basically a full house. \n\nThe waitstaff is super friendly and attentive. They clean and swipe up all your dishes the minute you're done! I'm not sure I really like that, but hey! Anyway, on to the food...Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but our food was just ok. I don't think I'd come here if I was craving sushi. \n\nWe had the sexy scallop roll which consisted of spicy scallops atop some sort of fish and avocado roll wrapped in soy paper. If I remember correctly it was salmon and white tuna or something? I love spicy scallops and it's sad to say that they were very fishy :-(. We also got the crouching tiger roll which had shrimp tempura and unagi which was the better of the two, but also not very memorable. The poke tuna salad was mediocre with strange chunks of tuna. (think chain restaurant poke salads) I appreciated the generous amounts of avocado though. I think the best part of our meal was the agedashi tofu and sake. Large pieces of nice soft tofu in a light sauce and fish flakes. Not sure what the sake was but we requested something \"light, girly and perhaps fruity\" and whatever the waiter got us was pretty good. Our total came out to be about $60 for 2, I guess that's sushi though.", "author": "Stine H."}

This roll definitely MORE than satisfied and I would get it again.\n\nMy friends got the African Spider roll, which was delicious but a bit too fried for my taste. The spicy crunchy roll was actually not your typical crunchy roll. It's not just a roll with tempura flakes on top, but the entire roll is fried!\n\nAppetizers...\n-Tempura: pretty good, but it was overall your standard tempura plate\n-Mushroom special: AMAZING! The mushrooms come wrapped in something fried, with some sauce on top. The fried part and the sauce were flavorful, but not enough to take away from the mushroom flavor. My friend hates mushrooms and she still loved this dish!\n-Gyoza: Pretty good -- not too crispy, which I rather enjoyed. I don't like things that are too fried.\n\nService was great! They were really nice about allowing us to bring our own cake for our friend's birthday.\n\nOverall, it's not your \"classic\" sushi restaurant.

For the first week or so, from the outside it looked nearly identical to Namu next door, doin that whole dark and sexy restaurantana (like a persona? making up words is fun). But when I came here with my roommates last week, it turns out it ain't so swank inside--there's hints of thought-out decorating here and there, but the walls seem unfinished and the floor looks like a construction site with paint splattered all over it (perhaps the paint that missed the wall?). Also, I think someone else clued them into imitating their neighbor's lighting, since it was pretty bright in there that night.\n\nDespite my qualms about the interior design of Sushi Bistro, I still like the food here. I swear I've ordered at least a third of the menu by now, though I never seem to remember what is what since there are so many crazy rolls (similar yet different from one another) to choose from. But if you're looking for a suggestion or two, M&L this time around had a tasty crunch to it, and even their brown rice rolls (try First Crush) make you forget it's brown rice. The agedashi tofu is always a safe bet, too, especially as a pair to a solo roll. \n\nAnd parking still sucks. That hasn't changed.", "author": "Kate V."}

We sat at the sushi bar at the back, which worked well for me, since I have hearing issues and the noise level was a bit high, primarily because there was mostly a young-ish crowd.  The place was full when we got there around 6:30 pm.\n\nI started off with portabella mushroom appetizer then had the vegetarian udon, served in a metal bowl/pail that kept it nice and hot. It was filled with thinly sliced winter squash, green beans, mushrooms, a balanced amount of noodles and a very tasty broth. And Lanjo had a sashimi platter that had a wonderful variety.\n\nBancha, warmed sake and a dessert of green tea ice cream complimented the meal.  This place is \"tucked away\" on Balboa Street, a few blocks off Arguello Street, walking distance from the Upper Haight.\n\nThe wait service was excellent, by the way - attentive without being intrusive.\n\nI highly recommend Sushi Bistro and will definitely go back again.", "author": "Stephen S."}

ONNNNNN.\n\nSushi Bistro is the prime example of a sushi restaurant that's designed for people who do not like sushi. If you love this place, then chances are you're more interested in the sauces than the actual fish, because the fish here is really not that good. \n\nI have a rule and it's served me pretty well throughout the years: if a sushi roll has too much sauce, then they're trying to cover up the poor quality of the fish. In the case of Sushi Bistro, this is completely true. When you eat here, the actual fish is the last ingredient that you can taste in each bite. Every roll is drenched in, doused with, and dominated by so many different sauces that they could easily replace the salmon with tofu and you can't tell the difference. \n\nIt is for this reason that I also ordered some of their sauce-free nigiri. The fresh salmon and tuna are mediocre at best, especially for the prices that Sushi Bistro charges.\n\nNow, that's not to say that the different tastes weren't interesting. They do have some pretty unique and creative rolls here, like the New Legend Roll and the Butterfish Blasters. The only problem is that it's all overpowered by sauce, and way too much of it. The ahi tuna poke dish was probably the worst dish I had here, and I think it's because that's more of a dish with which you can't really hide the fish quality.\n\nBottom line: if you love fresh, quality fish, then stay far far away from Sushi Bistro. But if you want a cool place to hang out with friends over some sake bombs, eating creative & unique rolls, then it's definitely worth checking out.\n\nFor me, however, if the fish is raw, then it'd better be good quality. Otherwise, I'm sticking to the edamame all night.", "author": "Roy C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-03", "description": "Sushi Bistro is not your average... actually it's not even a Japanese restaurant at all. It's more of a hip bar with that serves Japanese food. There's loud music playing so much that it's hard to have a conversation at normal loudness. The lights are really dim inside the restaurant so I would have to say this is an American-style sushi bar rather than a Japanese sushi bar. Not that it's a bad thing.\n\nSushi bistro has a lot of different special rolls they serve. There's also some regular nigiri pieces and Japanese bento dinner combos. The dishes are pretty much a hit or miss. Some of the ingredients didn't compliment each other well. All the ingredients was fresh and delicious though.\n\nMiso soup was alright. There's nothing really special about miso soup. The interesting thing is soup is usually the first item to come, but it ended up as the last item. Did they run out of miso soup?\n\nThe Spicy Girl's pretty kicking good. It has small chunks of tuna gathered together to form an underside down bowl with a layer of avocado on top. The creamy house sauce didn't go great with the tuna and avocado. It was too creamy since the avocado was already creamy to begin with.\n\nOtoro (fatty) tuna nigiri is awesomely delicious. It's such mouth watering good that it will send your taste buds to heaven the instant it hits them. The $14 price for two pieces is well worth the experience and the is pretty much the average price for two pieces..\n\nThe Caterpillar roll was a total miss for me. There was way too much cucumber inside the roll and it was drenched in the sweet sauce. The amount of rice and eel was really sparing compared to the cucumber. The avocado was nicely placed on top of the roll and they had two toothpicks that formed the caterpillar's head. I thought it was a nice touch.\n\nAlbacore Dream is a spicy roll with tuna and albacore. The ingredients mixed really well with each other and it had a really nice spicy zing at the end.\n\nNemo Found is really a unique roll that I didn't like. There was too many ingredients and different tastes inside that it just didn't taste good. A party in my mouth and everyone was invited is a good way to describe it. \n\nOverall, this is a nice place with fresh sushi. Parking in this neighborhood pretty much sucks so come early if you've made reservations.", "author": "Steven B."}

Second for those of you who have kids think twice before going here.\n\nMy friend actually recommended this place and we ( three couples and 4 kids) decided to give it a try. Now if you don't have kids you still might want to read on. ;-)\n\nIt started out very good, we had to make reservation and they gave us separate room in the back which was ok with us. Also provided high chair for one kid as we requested. So we ordered, we ate, and the sushi was really good and fresh. Kids also ate and then they started to hang out in hallway. The waiter came by and told us that the kids will get run over to one of us, not saying anything else. So we were like joking about it thinking the kids will run over them instead. After awhile, they asked to sit the kids, so we did. The next thing we know waiter comes with the bill and says we can't order anything else because there were many complaints about the kids. We asked why and then he started arguing madly with all the hate he had built up towards our table. We spoke with the owner and he basically told us the same thing to get out.... we were like wow, really? We actually had food on the table and drinks.... we paid and left in anger. \n\nAnyway, may be its not the right place for the families to have sushi at but the way conflict was handled by staff and the owner, tells me they have no customer service skills, rude talk manner as well as careless attitude towards the customers and apparently the business it self.\n\nI will not be back to this place, sushi were good but the whole experience was horrible.", "author": "I R."}

A weaker minded soul who left Sushi Bistro with a much to be desired palette may question if their taste buds were indeed defective, a genetic mishap of the 'ole factory sense.

I told her it was the modern day equivalent of this: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Cave and I dare not place the teachings placed upon me in jeopardy.  Her goading of \"best poke ever\" was weak temptation at best.  However, when I felt the time was ready, I entered this dwelling, ready to see if I could put past debacle behind me.  *inside debacle joke*\n\nComing with fellow statesman Le Chez along with our respective padawans, Lil Twist and semierectpenorsu, after a day of basketball, we arrived, underfed.  I had won a bet with Le Chez, calmly sinking a halfcourt shot, with Reggie Miller theatrics, much like Game 1 of the Pacers v. Bulls ECF.  I basically curled, shoved le Chez aside to create room, received an inbound pass and sunk a half court shot, then celebrated, hopping up and down on an uninjured ankle while the commentators bellowed, \"you can dance brian, you can dance!\"  What I basically mean is I sunk the half court shot first after 30+ attempts.  As a result, dinner was on him, $30 dollar minimum.  However, because he is a brother, we split 4 rolls, 2 rolls each of our choosing.\n\nWe ordered:\nbig island: 2/5 the big island was wrapped in cucumber.  while there was an assortment of fish inside, the taste was dominated by the crab.\nomega 3: 3/5 a deep fried roll that tasted like fried tempura and sauce.  \nrock n roll: 4/5 the best of the bunch.  it was basically a miniature lionking\nnew wave mahi mahi: 2/5 taste was again dominated by crabmeat\n\nI believe that more people come here for the ambiance.  It is a place to be seen I feel.  It is a great date place for sure...unoriginal (it isn't a Marine World, where one can walk around superhero cape'd, that's for sure) but effective.  There is nice presentation to their dishes and the service is good, however, the food leaves much to be desired.  The portions are small and the best thing I ate that night was the cheapest roll - California roll with baked scallops on top and the miso soup.  The rolls don't taste like an amalgamation of taste, but instead, one flavour dominates the rest, The padawans even gave negative feedback.

The fish was amazingly fresh: melt in your mouth delicious. Absolutely perfect.\nBut the fish to rice ratio, unlike a lot of other sushi spots, is way more fish than rice.  I'm sure this will be a huge attraction to folks who prefer sashimi only but a California Roll with a slender layer of rice and an overabundance of the crab is just too overwhelming.  The sushi slices were huge, exceptionally long but served with just a tiny pouch if rice. We prefer a balance of the two.\nWe ordered the Butterfish Blaster, the Omega, and M&L Forever.

We had never been before and reading the menu, thought it might be a bit too fusion for us. But it was incredible (and we are serious about our sushi!). First off the service was fantastic. Attentive but not in your face. Instead of an overwhelming table full of dishes, they brought each dish out at its own pace. When we finished one, the next arrived quickly. We ordered hot sake and it was there in literally a minute, both times. \n\nThe fish was all very fresh and the portions were very generous. We had the African spider roll which was delicious. The batter on the crab was light and tasty. We also has the \"hot love\" and it was so delectable and incredible. The nigiri portions were large and the fish super fresh. Since we ordered mostly nigiri, after trying the one roll and appetizer dish, we found our selves wanting to come back to try more of their inventive rolls and dishes. \n\nAnd to top it all off, the prices were very reasonable. Cheaper for larger portions than at many other sushi places.\n\nWe were just really taken by this place and will definitely be back!!", "author": "Patti M."}

Most of the rolls were pretty good but I would not order the new wave mahi mahi again as the flavors didn't blend well but the rest of the rolls were pretty good and the ahi poke special was different because it was spicy.\n\nIt came out to about $25 per person including tax and tip so it wasn't bad for sushi.

Little salad thing they gave us after water. I can't remember what they call it in Japanese but it was alright.\n\nAloha 101. Seared ahi tuna, cucumber and mango wrapped in seaweed, flash fried with a spicy garlic sauce. I thought this was okay because I love seared tuna. But I also did not taste any of the mango, I don't think the mango was ripe enough to add its fragrance to the roll. The sauce was not spicy at all, but I'll admit I probably also have a higher tolerance to spiciness than most people. \n\nHot Love. Baby lobster, crab and avocado rolled in snapper and baked with a spicy sweet sauce. I think this was my favorite dish of the night. I liked the addition of the lemon to the bottom, gave it an additional tangy flavor. I liked the sweet sauce a lot, it added a lot to the flavors of the lobster, crab, avocado and lemon but it was by no means spicy so if you're expecting to get a kick from it, don't. \n\nHirame Fusion. Salmon, cucumber and scallions topped with seared halibut sprouts and ginger-carrot sauce. This was alright, I think I liked it more than I would have just because salmon is my favorite sushi fish. I liked the halibut too since it was a more unexpected addition to a sushi roll, but definitely nothing to write home about. \n\nThe service was really good however, they were very quick to refill water glasses. And I liked how all of our dishes came one by one, as we finished one another would come so it didn't hog up our small table space. \n\nNote: Do not come here expecting legit Japanese sushi, it's more Asian fusion than real Japanese cuisine.", "author": "Constance C."}

So proud of you, so incredibly proud of you.  On such occasions, eating lots of good food is a necessity.  \n\nWell. I learned tonight that there IS such a thing as ordering too much food.  Because by the end, I didn't feel so hot.  Maybe it was also the things we ordered because everything started to taste the same after a while, which is why I'm giving the place a 3.5 now.  But, I think that the place still deserves anywhere between 3.5-4.25 depending on the day and what you order.  I see it as sort of like the scores you get for standardized tests, where they give you the range that you fall into, depending on the day and the particular test.\n\nAnyway.  Here's what we ordered tonight.  The good and the bad.\n\nTASTY:\n+ C-2:  Always a hit in my book.  Lobster, avocado, and some other stuff, with shrimp tempura and eel sauce drizzled on top.  Tastes exactly like you think it would taste: pretty damn good.\n+ Five Wishes:  I liked this one.  The snow crab in it was really creamy, and the salmon, hamachi, tuna, and some other fish that was on top of the roll was just really good too.  The hamachi was, as usual, the best. \n\nWEIRD:\n- Magic Mushroom:  First, the name.  Magic Mushrooms make me think of two things: 1) Toad from Mario brothers and 2) drugs.  This one just tasted like weird mushy stuff wrapped in something else undecipherable.  Not bad.  Just weird, and a little unnecessary.\n- New Legend: Um, this tasted exactly like the C-2 even though it was supposedly different.  Er, I guess that's a good thing, but there were only two of us, which meant we had to eat a lot of the same thing.  Again, unnecessary.\n\nFinal word:  So yes.  My range for Sushi Bistro is now 3.5 - 4.25.  A new way of reviewing things.  Maybe I should go this route more often.

Definitely not traditional rolls that you would get in Japan, but very tasty. Dinner for two, with tax and tip was $50. A tad expensive (well, maybe not for sushi, and now that I think about it, not for SF). Let's say instead that it was not inexpensive.\n\nI'll be stopping by again next time I'm in the area and want to treat myself.", "author": "Matthew C."}

Ordered it as sashimi. I found the hiramasa the best.\n\nPoke - Wow. Best poke I've had in the city. Better than some I've had in Hawaii. The key thing I liked is that they didn't smother the maguro in sauce. It wasn't overly salty. The seasoning was light, and it came on a bed of lightly dressed salad. Perfection!\n\nHot Love - their own creation. If you like crustaceans, you'll love it. Tasty.\n\nAgedashi Tofu - always a standard for me. If you like it, get it.\n\nWide selection of rolls. Sushi comes in nigiri or hamachi. They have multiple kinds of hamachi and maguro, as well as daily selections. Lettuce wraps, salads, rolls, teriyaki, etc. the variety was actually a bit overwhelming, including a respectable sake selection, so check out the menu before you go. \n\nService was attentive, fast, and friendly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-11-07", "description": "WARNING. Do not come here if you are looking for traditional sushi. It does not exist at this restaurant. The dishes are all fusion/Americanized (read: deep fried, spicy sauced, avocado-ed, mango-ed, etc.)\n\nThat aside- the service, first of all, was very good. We got cucumber salad and waters and drinks as soon as we got seated (but charging $1.50 for green tea, COME ON). Waters and teas were refilled really fast, dishes were cleared promptly. \n\nSecond- I made a mistake in thinking that this was a trendy but traditional place. Should've read Yelp reviews first! I ordered a king salmon nigiri, negihamachi roll, salmon roll and cucumber roll. The king salmon was delicious. Negihamachi had cucumber in it...doesn't negihamachi just mean yellowtail with scallions? I could not taste the scallions, could barely taste the fish...really just had the watery taste of cucumbers on my tongue. The salmon roll (I asked for just plain salmon!) had cucumbers AND avocado in it. Didn't I ask for plain salmon? What is up with the filler? Not really impressed as the fish was fresh enough (I think?) but was SO watery and not flavorful, the rolls were poorly constructed (wtf is up with them using almost no rice?) and fell apart easily. The seaweed was soggy in the salmon roll I got. Pretty gross.\n\nMy boyfriend doesn't really do the raw fish thing but even he felt like the \"unique\" rolls and dishes were way overdone. Too much sauce, too much fried stuff, too much avocado, too much spicy sauce that didn't taste like anything. My two American friends (whom he shared the dishes with), however, really enjoyed their dishes (hot love, aloha 101, albacore dream, african spider, Caucasian Afro, Spicy Crunchy). So if you're looking for traditional sushi, do not come here. If you're looking for a fusion meal or to start someone off on their first sushi experience, you're probably fine.\n\nIn the end, I definitely wouldn't come back. The meal cost me about $35 tax/tip without alcohol (2 nigiri, three rolls). I'm more of a traditionalist, but even with that in mind I'd be wary of fish that is tasteless/watery and possibly unfresh. Even if you cover it up with a bunch of sauces and deep fry it, its still not worth the price tag and possible stomachache.", "author": "Emily H."}

We seek untried sushi restaurants in SF, at least untried among the 3 of us. Premise is that there aren't very many good sushi places to go to in SF. Sad but kinda true. So our quest began to uncover the gems of the City.\n\nNot sure Sushi Bistro falls into this category. But if you're looking for ROLLS in an unconventionally modern, dark and hip sushi restaurant,\nthen this is the place for you.\n\nListed in order of most to least fave rolls we tried:\n1. Butterfish Blasters ($13.95) snow crab and avocado wrapped in butterfish lightly torched with a garlic-soy. Based on the description I expected this dish to be hot but it wasn't. Nevertheless, the fish was soft and it was really nice to bite into the crab and avocado rather than a ball of rice.\n\n2. Hawaiian Breeze ($11.95). Mango, avocado and slivered fuji apple topped with tuna, macadamia nuts and drizzled with cilantro pesto. Totally unexpected flavors from the cilantro and pesto but it gave a very 'fresh' aromatic taste to the sushi. Admittedly I barely tasted the tuna. I caught more of the sweetness from the mango and fuji apples. But I liked the creative use of apples. It worked well with this roll.\n\n3. Albacore Dream  ($11.25). Spicy tuna and avocado topped with albacore, served with house special and spicy sauce. This one had a nice heat to it from the spicy tuna, but the spiciness did overpower the \nalbacore, which I typically like to taste and enjoy.\n\n4. C-2  ($12.95). Baby lobster, avocado and cucumber topped with shrimp tempura, drizzled with sweet eel sauce. The shrimp tempura stayed crunchy on top of the roll but overall had a sweet taste. I couldn't even tell I was eating lobster, which was a shame.\n\n5. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon  ($10.95). Shrimp tempura, avocado & cucumber, all topped with unagi and eel sauce. This one was not memorable except that it was a little too sweet especially since it tasted similar to C-2.\n\n6. Monster in-laws  ($12.95). Spicy albacore and cucumber topped with yellowtail, jalapenos, spicy and ponzu sauce. Visually pleasing with the delicate slices of jalapenos but honestly I tasted a fish that was a bit \"fishy\" and so I couldn't eat any more of it.\n\nWhat Sushi Bistro does well is innovative roll names, easy on the rice (awesome), and heavy on the \"stuff\" to roll into the sushi. I could see myself coming back w/ a group of friends so I could try more of the inventive rolls. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're a sushi purist.", "author": "Cindy W."}

However, for being in San Francisco and at these prices, I really should label the experience here as an injustice. The Teriyaki Chicken with Tempura was laughable at best in terms of taste and presentation, being served on a plastic plate. Yes, plastic. As far as portion size is concerned, it was an absolute atrocity. The chicken breast was the thinnest sliced chicken breast that I've ever seen. It was literally about 1/4 inch thick. It was just a plain, thin slice of chicken breast with teriyaki sauce drizzled on top. Needless to say it was under seasoned. The salad was mediocre and not worth the time to type this sentence. The rice was soggy. Yes, soggy rice at an asian restaurant. This is what Asians do best, folks, COOK RICE. Please don't embarrass yourselves any further and learn how to cook rice for crying out loud. The tempura was really the only redeeming factor in this dish, but it was not anything even close to stellar. For $16.95 the owners of this establishment should be ashamed to be seen in public. \n\nThe nigiri offerings were adequate for human consumption, but that's as far as they go. Portion size was decent and more specifically the fish was of adequate to above average in size. It was sufficiently fresh and edible, but lacked flavor and refinement. However, the rice was utterly sub-par. I am left wondering if the rice even had any vinegar in it. The consistency was soggy and it had absolutely no flavor. The rice is not just an afterthought in sushi and isn't there just to have somewhere to lay the fish on, it is part of the dish and warrants just as much attention and execution as the preparation of the fish.", "author": "Aldo S."}

A new clientele, that is young and hip, that desire the loud blaring music and dimly lit tables. Early reviews of the Sushi Bistro long ago would mention that the long wait for food was made up by the creativity of dishes and freshness of fish. I can only imagine the wait time with the new hipster packed restaurant. I say something has to give, and unfortunately, it is the quality of food. There is no way Sushi Bistro could meet the high quality that it once had and crank out the number of plates to meet demand.

One of the draws for me was the large selection of vegetarian rolls, however, none of them were really good. (My fish eating friends weren't that impressed by what they ordered either, other than the spicy crunchy roll).  \n\nI tried the crunchy veggie roll  ($8.95) which is made up of lightly deep fried vegetables with crunchy tempura batter outside, drizzled with sweet sauce. The vegetables in this roll were basically just yams and avocados. It had a strange taste of Thanksgiving as my friend pointed out. Disappointed, I pawned my veggie rolls off on the others and I opted for another veggie roll - the tuscan roll ($8.50) which was made up of avocado and sun-dried tomatoes wrapped in seaweed, flash fried, and served with sweet and spicy sauce. Another disappointment. As much as I love sun-dried tomatoes, they do not belong in a sushi roll. Furthermore, their sweet and spicy sauce belonged on chicken, not sushi. \n\nBottom line, with good company, mediocre food doesn't really matter but I was disappointed in Sushi Bistro and think SF has much better sushi to offer. Their sushi is definitely innovative, they have good service, and a few large screen TVs with sports and music. So if you do opt to come here I'd go with ordering something super basic e.g., avocado hand roll, otherwise you'll probably be disappointed if you're looking for traditional sushi.", "author": "H T."}

I had the Volcano roll (baked salmon with spicy sauce on top) and it was delicious. I had asked the waiter beforehand if it was filling, and he informed me it was because of the creamy sauce it came in. It's okay though, it's not his fault.

Ok.\n\nI noticed that the waiters all worked together to tend to us during our meal. We may have had one main server but different people came around to give us our food and such so service was pretty quick.

The servers were impressively thorough in checking that certain dishes were made without soy sauce, dairy, and egg. The only reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of a gluten-free or allergen-free menu on hand. This would save the customer and the servers a lot of time.

Although I have heard from several people that the Mission location is better than the Inner Richmond location.   I had heard about this place from several people and it received some great reviews and when I arrived I saw that it was Michelin Guide Recommended so I was very excited.  The menu was a little overwhelming.  There were tons of options.  Do not get me wrong, I believe the ability to make decision are great, but not so much when it comes to my food.  As Chef Gordon Ramsey always suggests, keep the menu simple. The first time I went to Sushi Bistro, I was so overwhelmed with the menu that after checking in on yelp I checked the highlights and recommendations.  I was not in the mood to take 10-15 minutes to make an order.  The highlights and recommendations were spot on accurate.  I ordered:  salmon nigiri, crouching tiger hidden dragon, butterfish blasters, and sexy scallop.  Dish after dish was delicious.  I could not have asked more from this place.\n\nI had such a great first experience that when I had a friend come into town I recommended that we go there.  The second experience was not good.  The food was good, but not as good as it was before. The first experience met the standard of reviews that it received.  The second experience fell short.  It could have been my taste buds, but my boyfriend (who had gone with me the first time) stated that he agreed that the first time was significantly better so it wasn't just me. Also the food came out very quickly, which I would never complain about, but all of our food pretty much arrived all at once.  There was a group of 5 of us and we were not able to fully take in the experience because it seemed very rushed and then we were done eating so we left.  Also, the place wasn't packed so it wasn't like they were trying to get seat other people.  In fact, we were seated in the back room and we had it all to ourselves the entire time until the very end when we were paying our bill.  It could have been a different chef that night.  The thing about a truly great restaurant is that the food is consistent night after night.  Based on that I have to give this 3 stars.  Consistency is key.  Also I have to try the location in the Mission which I heard is better than the Inner Sunset one.", "author": "Vagabond V."}

For instance, I know that I've only ever given 5-star reviews to 5 sushi places:\n\nYum Yum & Maruya (which are really for simple, take-out lunch sushi)\nCha-Ya (which is vegetarian, so it's not like I was grading the fish quality)\nHama-Ko (admittedly awesome fish, but it's a mom-and-pop shop that's mostly about nigiri, no fancy rolls)\nSangha (which is, alas, closed)\n\nAs you can see, I've never given 5 stars to an all-out fancy-roll sushi dinner joint.  Until now.  Which I guess makes Sushi Bistro the best sushi in the city.  And funnily enough, I wound up here entirely by chance--no Yelp research involved.\n\nOk, so what makes it the best sushi in the city, you ask?  Suffice it to say that I tried 6 or 7 different rolls, any one of which could have been the star dish at a lesser restaurant.  Extremely creative flavorings (like the apple in the first crush roll), ridiculously fresh fish (like the spicy tuna on the red devil roll), generous portions, and reasonable prices considering the taste-bud tour de force you get (we were all quite satiated for a grand total of $24 per person).  Atmosphere is polished but intimate, not quite as trendy as Namu next door but still full of yuppie neighborhood couples who could probably be having kids by now but would rather spend their money on sushi.

I'm back in the hood, and the joint's got new digs, new rolls, and a whole new vibe.  I still think that it's an amazing value for the fish that you get.

First when they moved to a bigger place I was worried that the quality of the sushi would start seriously slacking. It actually didn't. The decor was much more appealing, and it was definitely more roomier which I appreciate. And the dim lightning makes for a great date spot. (Be careful of the sake intake when you're on a date... everything looks better when your drunk and in the dark). \n\nAnyways, then the iPhone commercial for the UrbanSpoon app came out, and when I saw it I was so excited because I've been supporting this place since 2006! WOW... what a change a famous commercial makes. TONS, and TONS of reservations pouring in, making it harder to maintain that intimate feeling between you, the sushi chef, or server. They are now far too busy to even stay at your table to take a sake shot with you.\n\nThen, they opened the 2nd location. This is where I really noticed things to go downhill. Smaller portions, things I've had hundreds of times seemed lackluster and not the way I always remember. Something was a little off. Quality control went down, and the portion size DEFINITELY did, while the prices increased slightly. Although the flavors of most of the rolls are there... I don't know... its just not what it used to be. Before, I didn't mind paying $12 for a fantastic roll that was absolutely orgasmic and generous (portion wise) - but I left basically with the feeling like \"my best friend got famous and now she doesn't remember who she really was, or who I am anymore...\"\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nI still give it four stars instread of three for the flavor and uniqueness of the rolls, including some of the new ones and the daily specials on the menu.

It also catches the draft from the door whenever it is open.\n\nI politely refused to sit there and agreed to wait for a better table.\n15 minutes later a table became available, however the hostess was less than interested in seating me (the table was placed for a party of 4). I kindly asked to be seated there with the prompt reply that it was reserved for a party of 4.\nNoticing the reservation list, I saw that the party of 4 had the same reservation time slot as I, 8:00 pm and they were 15 minutes late past their time. So I politely stated that fact with a second request to be seated. I was again denied seating at said table.\n\nAfter a brief debate with the hostess's and a waiter, my companion and I left on our own accord.\n\nThis is not the first time I have had this experience. I would also like to point out that I never choose to eat at Sushi Bistro and only attempt to dine there when a request is made.\n\nSparing you the reader the longer full details of this experience, I have summarized the events I had the unfortunate time of dealing with.\n\nTake note, Sushi Bistro = good food with sub par service (at least from all the times I've been there).\n\nI'd recommend if you go with a party of 2, make a reservation for 3, wait to be seated and then if asked, say your friend couldn't make it.\n\nIt's a sad day when you have to trick a restaurant into seating you properly.", "author": "Mathew R."}

One of my chopsticks went flying . . . almost before it hit the floor the waiter zoomed a new pair onto the table.   We had a light meal of tempura and a couple rolls.  All very tasty. Interesting that brown rice sushi is offered. But as pointed out in another review, the sushi isn't over-burdened with rice. A good effort toward healthy food - easy to eat a plant-strong meal if you wish.   Service was just amazing.  A pleasure to eat here and to receive a modest bill at the end -- $38 for two of us, incl large hot sake.  One of the rolls took longer. . . twice the staff assured us it was on the way and apologized for the \"slowness\" which was not really slow at all.", "author": "Bill H."}

Most sushi places with sushi as great as this charge you an arm and a leg. Here, it is affordable. I am a college student on a tight budget - Sushi Bistro is definitely where I splurge, but I am so glad it is priced where it is - Not too cheap, not too expensive.\n\nThe service (waiters and waitresses) aren't always the nicest people but it tends to be dark and busy in there.

Sure, there are plenty of beautiful looking rolls here... but they all just taste the same in the end because there are so many different ingredients masking each others' flavors.\n\nThe first time I came here, my boyfriend and I ordered some rolls and their 10 piece nigiri... and it was AWFUL. The rice was cold, hard, and fell apart when you picked up a piece of sushi. The chefs didn't even season the underside of the fish with wasabi. I told the waiter and he nonchalantly said that people didn't like the wasabi there. What he meant was that \"Americans\" don't want the wasabi. However, \"Americans\" mix a ton of wasabi in soy sauce for sushi dunking, so why don't the chefs just make the nigiri properly? \nThe 2nd time I went was only because my boyfriend had a gift certificate. We decided to give it another chance. I didn't even bother ordering anything other than nigiri (and I made sure to tell the waitress to have the chefs season it properly). The bf got a few of their rolls... which promptly fell apart the second he picked them up with chopsticks. I ate one of each type and was not impressed at all. I think the rolls are just a means to utilize the last bits of leftover fish they have available. Also, the waiters find it perfectly acceptable to grab items from your table while you're eating, so one of em knocked my food right off of my chopsticks with his hand. Gross.\n\nIf you want REAL sushi... god, I really hate to give away my current favorite spot... go to Okina on Arguello. The sushi chef/owner is a PRO. You pick your sushi up (yes, with your hands) directly from the bar. YUM! Forget the excessive amount of soy sauce and wasabi that you're used to, because it just covers up the natural taste of the fish. And Okina provides top rate seafood here- unlike the pathetic specimens Sushi Bistro offers.  Whenever I go to Okina, I just tell the chef to make me whatever he wants. It's always DEEEEEELICOUS!! He doesn't serve \"fancy\" rolls or certain types of fish because he knows what ingredients mix together badly or types of fish that cause indigestion.", "author": "Suzi G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-01-06", "description": "A unique and modern spin on classic sushi roles.\n\nWe decided to venture beyond our usual sushi joints this week and found ourselves the patrons of Sushi Bistro located on the outskirts of Inner Richmond. The first thing that strikes you is that this is a place for young, but experienced, sushi eaters. The prices keep the college age riffraff  away while the more bombastic atmosphere is likely to turn off anyone in the 40+ crowd. But for those with a youthful attitude and some cash to spend, you could do a lot worse than Sushi Bistro.\n\nI tried one of their specialty rolls, the African Spider, and the more classic Caterpillar Roll. Both were constructed with high grade ingredients and very flavorful. The caterpillar, tragically, lacked a certain level of cohesion and thus fell apart without careful chopstick action, but I had mastered the technique by the third attempt. I will say both rolls were HUGE, and because of the rich flavor, I can't recommend eating one roll on your own... it's just too much unless you really want a lot of one thing. Better to take a date and split a few rolls to vary the experience.\n\nThere was also an order of poke at the table, which I would describe as \"deconstructed\". I didn't try any myself, but those who did said while the tuna itself wasn't \"the best\", the dish when eaten as a whole was quite good. That seems to be a good way to describe a lot of what's going on at Sushi Bistro.\n\nOn a lark, Diner B and I tried their shooters, which for some reason do not appear on their online menu. If memory serves, it was a raw oyster, quail egg, some roe and a good helping of sake. Frankly, it was more than I could shoot all at once, which detracted from the overall experience. Can't say I would bother with the expense again.\n\nAlso, the miso soup was only so-so. But the point of the place, as I see it, isn't just about the food. It's about the atmosphere. So, if you aren't looking for the purist experience and are willing to spend a little more, this would be a great date place. Just be sure to order the rolls.", "author": "Sean K."}

ROUND OF APPLAUSE please! :) We devoured:\n\nAFRICAN SPIDER - Cajun flavored albacore, salmon, soft shell crab, sprouts, tobiko, avocado and spicy house sauce. I honestly didn't think the albacore was that Cajun tasting. It was rather mild but I didn't mind because I don't like spicy.\n\nCROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON - Shrimp tempura, aioli, avocado & cucumber, topped with unagi and eel sauce. The tempura was perfect, hot and crisp. Everything married well and the portion was big!\n\nWAIKIKI - Mango and avocado topped with unagi, eel sauce and macadamia nuts. Sweet and savory, soft and crunchy! I love the textures and contrasting flavors of this roll. Who knew mango and nuts would be so tasty in sushi?\n\nAs we ate the rolls, we kept wondering if the brown rice was real brown rice. We thought the texture was too soft/tender but the color was consistent. It tasted great but was it the real thing? The waiter told us that they buy a special kind of brown rice from Japan especially for sushi. Well I guess they hella told me! I love brown rice sushi but it's not always done right.

The mango salsa did not sound too appetizing to me, but my friend wanted to order it. It was the best roll I had all night. The mango salsa did not over power the taste of the sushi, instead it enhanced it. So glad that we got this roll.\n\nC-2 Roll\nBaby Lobster, avocado and cucumber topped with shrimp tempura and drizzled with eel sauce\nThis was one of Jenny's favorite's roll. It was good, but I still thought the New Wave Mahi-Mahi roll was better.\n\nHamachi Kama\nElla doesn't eat raw fish, so she always orders something cooked. Actually, she always orders the hamachi kama, which is cooked yellowtail collar. Really good especially when dipped into the ponzu sauce. The price is reasonable here and they give a big portion. YUM!\n\n\nSexy Scallop Roll\nSpicy white tuna, salmon, avocado topped with spicy chopped scallop, tobiko and scallions.\nWe had originally ordered this, but I think the waiter left it out, so I got to try a piece from Anita. After trying this roll I'm glad that I didn't order it because it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I really like scallops and I thought having scallops in a roll would taste really good, but it didn't thrill my tastebuds too much.\n\n\nThe New Legend Roll\nShrimp tempura, spicy aioli, avocado topped with seared albacore, spicy garlic sauce and scallions\nA roll that I suggested we order. I love seared albacore so I wanted this. The roll was pretty good, too bad it was just a tad bit spicy. You know me and spicy food. Not too fond.

I get that sense at Sushi Bistro.\n\nWhile I do appreciate the generosity and thought behind humongous pieces of sashimi (literally 4 inches long and 3 inches wide), I cant help but scoff at it as well.  I didn't really enjoy biting the raw piece of fish numerous times, as the beauty of sashimi is taking it in one bite and letting the favors bloom on your tounge.\n\nAside from that, I'd say the experience was a solid three stars.  We started off with the butterfish blasters and the miso glazed sea bass.  The sea bass was tough, and had gone down in quality from the last time I had it.  The blasters were fishy and in general had a slop-like consistency, which prompted me to send them back.   However, the older woman server was rather abrupt and somewhat rude when she told me that they refuse to take the dish back.  Later, I spoke with another friendly server-David- about this and he explained to me the small-business mentality behind their refusal which I respect, and subsequently smoothed it over.  My suggestion is maybe the first woman shouldn't be dealing with customers, because her people skills definitely need improvement.  \n\nThe edamame was a bit overcooked and soggy.  We also had the albacore dream roll which was excellent, and my boyfriend enjoyed his tempura and sushi roll (forget the name) very much.  David took care of some mochi ice cream for us to make up for the blasters incident, which we both appreciated.\n\n\"This may work out here near USF, but this shit wouldn't fly downtown\" - was how my boyfriend summed up our experience, and I have to agree.", "author": "Genevieve M."}

But the pieces were HUGH.  It took me at least three bits to finish one piece.  I think if the fish is fresh, I don't mind the piece is smaller.\n\nThen we ordered some of the dishes from their \"Something Unique\" section:\n\n1.  Double Jeopardy - Chopped Jeopardy - Chopped Salmon, Albacore & Avocado served spicy sauce\n2.  Hot Love - Baby Lobster, Avocado and crab meant rolled in Snapper and baked with special sweet sauce\n3.  Butterfish Blasters - Crab Meat and avocado wrapped in Butterfish with soy sauce\n4.

Scallop Supreme - Seared Scallop served with Edamame Sauce\n\n**The presentation of the dishes were all nice but they were all tasted the so-so, nothing was special.  I don't recommend any dishes from here.\n\nSince we wanted some rice so we ordered some Nigiri Sushi and a roll, we ordered Hamachi, Uni, Salmon and Couching Tiger and Hiding Dragon Roll.  Again the fish did not seem fresh and the piece was HUGH on top of the tiny rice.  Actually I should not complain with that but I think the proportation of the rice and the cut of the fish should be well balance.  It was just too off here!  The CTHD roll was actually Dragon Roll.  The rice was too sticky (too much water) and too much sauce, nothing special on this one! again.  \n\nAnother thing that made me dislike the place was the service.

I found this restaurant on Yelp based on its rating and high number of reviews because it must be super good if a thousand people gave the restaurant an average of four stars right?\n\nTo be honest, I was a bit disappointed when we got our food. We ordered 4 different rolls: Albacore Dream, Aloha 101, Hawaiian Breeze, and M&I Forever. My favorite of the four is the Albacore Dream mostly because of the spicy tuna, albacore, and sauce. The Aloha 101 came with six pieces and a dipping sauce. I wasn't much of a fan of the slightly fried outside of the roll, so I thought this roll was just okay and that there was not much flavor to it even with the dipping sauce. The Hawaiian Breeze was quite interesting as it contains three types of fruits (mango, Fuji apple, avocado) with tuna and some kind of sauce. What was unique about this roll was that there were also macadamia nuts on top, but I guess I was not used to all these different flavors combined together. The M&I Forever had much more tuna, crab, and albacore, but the crispy exterior made me tired of the taste quite easily and the pieces were not that big.\n\nNormally at other sushi restaurants we have been to back home, four rolls of sushi are enough to feed the whole family because we are a family of skinny people. Unfortunately, we left the restaurant feeling just content and could still eat more. The prices are a bit pricy for somewhat smaller rolls compared to what we are used to. I think we finished our meal in like half an hour and wandered through SF looking for desserts and snacks to fill the remaining space in our tummies. \n\nUnlike the majority, we were not quite satisfied with our experience food wise. As for service, it is actually really fast and friendly! Maybe we ordered the wrong thing? I guess this restaurant unfortunately isn't our cup of tea. (We actually got tea afterwards. Teehee. Get it? Not our cup of tea, so we went to get actual tea. Okay, I'll be quiet now)", "author": "Julia N."}

We were seated right away because we had a small party.  I'm not sure if they take reservations because they get very busy and seating is limited.  \n\nHowever, they do turn over their tables quickly.  It's almost like a fast food sit down restaurant.

Though being hung over from The Eve of New Years Eve '08, I managed to squeak out a high level of satisfaction from the fare. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised at Sushi Bistro's deviation from the traditional stylings of most sushi bars. \n\nBut that's point-in-fact of my review herein (does that make sense? I blacked out). This is not your traditional sushi spot. If you're looking for authenticity, this is not where I would go. But if you're looking for a fresh take on traditional, or a well-played adaptation, this is it. \n\nThe rolls and salads are unlike anything I've ever had. When I was there, they features a number of rolls with baby lobster. I'd never had a baby lobster before. I felt kinda bad, but it tasted so good. I like to believe the good and the bad balanced itself out. If it tastes so good, it can't be bad. \n\nAnd if I remember right, which is highly questionable, their Sake selection was pretty respectable. I seem to remember having a couple of new bottles there. But who knows...it was so long ago!!! Wait, that was only a year ago...uh oh. \n\nThe point is, they present their sushi well, they have created something different and their fishies are choice.

I've made it a point to start checking out restaurants that I've been wanting to try in the city a lil more often now because I'm 5 months pregnant and when the baby arrives I don't know if we'll have the time, money or energy to do it as much. \n\nSo here we are at Sushi Bistro after circling the 2-3 blocks around the restaurant for a good 10-15 minutes. The hubby is a bit grumpy at this point. It looks like the place is packed but they were able to sit us at the bar. I didn't mind since I was hungry and just wanted to sit and eat already. I took a look at the menu and searched for some yummy rolls that didn't have anything raw in them. Here's what we ordered: \n\nCrouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (Shrimp Tempura, Aioli, Avocado & Cucumber, Topped with Unagi & Eel Sauce) - Soooo good! 2 Thumbs Up! \n\nC-2 (Baby Lobster, Avocado & Cucumber Topped with Shrimp Tempura, Drizzled with Eel Sauce) - Even better that the Crouching Tiger! It was my favorite among the 3 different rolls that we ordered. The hubby agreed and said that next time he wants a a whole roll just for himself. \n\nRock'N Roll (Baked Spicy Scallops Served on Top of a California Roll) - Came out last and was probably my least favorite. It came out piping hot! I was kind of full after the first 2 rolls at this point but managed to squeeze in a couple of pieces of this one. They were difficult to pick up with chopsticks...probably because the pieces were warm and a bit mushy. The scallops had a nice spicy kick to them. I don't think I really liked the combination of the 2...and not really liking the taste of warm california roll so I probably wouldn't order this particular one again. \n\nOverall, I CAN'T WAIT to go back again...even more so after my baby is born so I can try the other raw rolls on their menu that sound super yummy!", "author": "BrElla4eva H."}

Who tends your hot tea cup when no one waiter/tress claims you as their patron?\n\nThe menu is nouveau sushi - read more rolls and deconstructed roll plates then traditional sushi.  I'm fine with that, I like a nice spicy tuna roll with mango and crunchy tempura bits.  No one in Japan is going to claim that as authentic but I claim is as yummy.  That said, Sushi B is pushing the limits.  If you are someone who likes to yell \"X-treme\" before you do some retarded physical stunt equally likely to make you infamous or earn a Darwin award, Sushi B might be the place for you.  I for one like my bones hole and my skin on.\n\nTo be fair and to the point, the cardinal sin for this place boils down to the fact that the food was really unimpressive.  Nigiri portions were huge, dare I say \"X-treme!,\" but the fish was either frozen or of poor quality.  A couple of rolls were hits but nothing stands out in drawing me back.  \n\nFor that I write this neg-review.

The albacore dream was oversauced and the tuna was slightly spicy, slightly warm. The crouching tiger rolls were delicious, the unagi and avocado combo was yum. The C-2....could have sent this back.

You pay a bill for a party of 5 and tip $20, and then after your party leaves the restaurant, the cashier at the restaurant comes OUTSIDE and asks you for another $4 in tip?  Well this happened to me!  The gentlemen (and I use that term loosely) came out and said that we should have tipped 15% and asked for another $4 in tip!  The bill with tax was around $150, before tax it was around $137.  I thought a $20 tip was fair for our fine waiter.  Nope!  It was not good enough!  The cashier, not the waiter, came outside the restaurant after  we had left and asked us to come inside and tip some more!  An argument ensued and he started telling me that I lived in America and  since they are all paid minimum wage at the restaurant, I should tip more!  I will admit that $20 is not exactly 15% of $150 but since when is a 15% tip required?!?!  A tip (also called a gratuity) is a VOLUNTARY extra payment made to certain service sector workers in addition to the advertised price of the transaction.  It is actually supposed to be 15% before taxes, not after.  This would mean that I was more than fair, since 15% is around $20.xx depending on the exact total of my bill before tax.  So I actually shorted him less than $1.  Never in my life have I ever had someone chase me down and ask for more money (for tip!!!).  For goodness sakes, he was not even the waiter.  He then started yelling and pointing at me asking if I lived in America.  Well since I was born here, I suppose I am a citizen, and being a citizen of these here United States, I know that a tip is OPTIONAL. \n         Now if you want good sushi and good food, please go here.

No taste, no creativity, quickly made Sushi that cannot be Japanese owned because the fish leaves that  not fresh taste in your mouth and another key to their declining food quality is the fact that the chef's do not realize that you cannot put a small amount of rice in your nigiri sushi...Sign that the chefs do not know how to make sushi. Very Americanized sushi with horrible parking in this neighborhood would not make this a recommendation for anyone looking to experience all the wonderful places for Sushi in the San Francisco Bay area. PASS ON THIS PLACE TAKE MY ADVICE. WAIT STAFF HAVE TURNED OVER QUITE A BIT LATELY AS WELL WHICH IS NOT A GOOD SIGN. \n\nWorks for neighborhood folks too lazy to go to a real sushi restaurant...", "author": "Reynold B."}

It was packed to the brim on a Friday night w/ ppl in every square inch of the place!\n\nWe went for their Black Weeds signature roll (lightly seared baby tuna seasoned w/ black pepper & sesame oil, topped w/ seaweed salad & spicy albacore), which didn't sound that appetizing right off the bat, but ended up being our favorite roll. I'd definitely order it again. We also ordered Butterfish Nigiri, which was gigantic! If you're into equal fish/rice ratio, I'd order up a side of rice since the fish dominates- there was just a small bit of rice to accompany it. The Caucasian Afro starter dish (spicy tuna mixed w/ guacamole served w/ onion & tomato sauce garnished w/ crispy potato vermicelli) was tasty and fresh. It made for a great app.\n\nIf you don't have reservations, be prepared to wait awhile. Service was lightning fast, but since they were churning out so many rolls, the servers kept on serving us dishes that weren't ours. They also kept pouring us cold tea to refill our cups. Hopefully this isn't a regular thing.\n\nOverall, I'd make a point to come by here if you're really into sushi. Bring the health fanatics & vegetarians too since they have special brown rice and veggie rolls!\n\n\nSidenotes: \n-It's a shame that their logo doesn't reflect its clean & modern interior.

Our dinner, with drinks, was just over $30 each, and we were pretty full. Be sure to try the sexy scallop roll!\n\nI agree with others that if you just want to chill at a little quiet sushi joint, this probably isn't the place - it is pretty loud and a tiny bit swanky; but if you're in the mood for a lively, snazzy place and you don't feel like trekking down to the Marina or the Mission, this is your place!", "author": "Kate S."}

The staff was pleasant and accommodating when my tourist friends went to the sushi bar to watch the chef at work...  Our food came out quick and we were attended to promptly when our dishes were empty and we were ready for more...\n\nNow for the food... it's not that it wasn't good - I've had rolls of the same quality before.  I overlooked half the menu though, because I noticed many were \"fusion\" type rolls.  I'm all for artistry and creativity, but when it's come to sushi, I've lucked out with finding anything good in the \"fusion\" department.  I usually steer clear of those, because I know that it's just a bunch of fluff that will confuse my tastebuds more than satisfy me.  \n\nMoving on... the spicy tuna rolls were super.  I had something with Yellowtail in it, but I can't put my finger on the name because it's been a while since my visit, and it was ok.\n\nMy guests had the spider rolls, and apparently, my friend from Turkey had never known that soft shell crab existed...  The idea of eating the whole damned thing boggled her mind., but once she got her first taste, she quickly made haste to flag down a server and make sure I order her another portion.  That MUST mean something.  \n\nMy native SF friends helping me play tour guide had the sashimi plates, and they looked incredibly good.  Thick, fatty morsels of vibrant bits of fish... I had to look away while they ate to make sure I did not commit the sin of coveting the contents on my neighbor's plate.  I'm definitely going to try what they had if ever I am in the area again.\n\n3.5 stars... good and fresh, but I really have to work the \"fusion\" idea into my head one more time to be adventurous here, and the staff did a wonderful job making sure we had everything we needed for the night.  A small part of this rating could have been higher if it weren't for the smell that I noticed from the paint off-gassing.

The beef teriyaki was delicious and the tempura were deep fried to perfection. We also had edamame- yum, one of my favorites! We also ordered sushi (I'm not a sushi expert) so I cannot remember everything that was ordered (too many things to count!). My favorite sushi of the night was the halibut and the salmon skin roll.

One of my favs since I love soft shell crab and they always serve this with a huge one crawling out and it's fried to perfection.\nBig Island ($13.95)- Salon, tuna, yellowtail, snow crab meat, avocado and sprouts wrapped with a thinly sliced cucumber. Fish is always fresh and it's just so refreshing to eat a sushi with cucumber instead of the usual.\nSpicy Crunchy ($9.75)- Yellowtail, salmon, snapper, shrimp and macadamia nuts deep fried and is served with spicy house sauce... Who DOESN't like deep fried sushi? I know I do!\nRainbow roll ($9.75)- The usual rainbow roll is always a good choice!\n\nIf you want to try something different, give the lettuce wraps a try.

This is fantastic, because I am an ignorant white chick who is easily confused and who thinks all of the bottles look the same so I can never remember which kinds I have tried and liked in the past. \n\nWeird rolls. Rolls with fruit and fried stuff and odd sauces and odder combos of ingredients. Plus, for some reason that does not transcend into the nigiri/sashimi, they serve some of the fish at entirely the wrong temperature.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-12-30", "description": "I am in the minority, but I am going to give Sushi Bistro 3 stars not because I dislike their food, but because I never have a craving for this place simply because every Japanese restaurant (along with, to my dismay, some Korean joints) provides rolls.  Thus, why circle Balboa like a vulture in order to find a parking spot to squeeze my non-Mini car into?  If I want rolls, choices are aplenty.  Many do them just as well as Sushi Bistro and you get much more bang for your buck, too.\n\nLuckily, in my case, all of this is moot because I do not even care for rolls.  They are okay, but I do not ever have a yearning for them.  I almost exclusively eat nigiri and sashimi because I want to taste the fish.  I want to savor the ocean freshness of naked fish.  When fish are drizzled with, soaked in, overwhelmed by sauces, my poor taste buds, for all their sensitivity, cannot find the fish even with state-of-the-art GPS.  This is always a bad thing, in my opinion.  Not only is it frustrating to be unable to experience that freshness, in the event the fish is not that fresh--chances are it is not--I want to know instead of be suspicious as I plow through the mayo.\n\nBack to Sushi Bistro, their fish is hit-or-miss, in terms of freshness.  Some of the sashimi salads are quite nice with delicious sesame ginger dressings.  The rolls' fish do not impress, however.  Also, prepare to spend, on average, 20 minutes to find parking during the weekends.  They do not take reservations.  The interior is colorful and aims to be hip and modern.  The service is on point.  Do not skip the green tea ice cream.  It is house-made and tastes like really good matcha.", "author": "Dee C."}

And then when you get your sushi you'll wonder why they call it Sushi bistro. Calling this sushi is sacrilegious. For that you should go do a 100 Hail Marys' inside the backroom of a Chinese Fish Market.\r\n\r\nI think there should be a rule. Like you can't call it sushi if the fish comes from a Costco freezer. I got the \"Catch of the Day\" Sashimi combo or whatever it was and it was more like the \"Catch of Last month.\" The snapper tasted like fish flavored gummy bears. The tuna looked like a block of lego and tasted worse then one too. The only thing they didn't mess up was the salmon....but no one can mess that up. Not even Kitaro. \r\n\r\nOnly good thing I can say about this place is that a few of the hot appetizers were pretty good. Hot Love, Lava Flow I think.

Crispy delicate soft shell craft, salmon, and albacore with a spicy sauce.

Chef/restaurateur Nobu Matsuhisa show off his well presenting delights with influences from Japan and Peru. So what is the dam fuss about this place? A few years ago, I flew down to Los Angeles to try the food myself. In his Beverly Hills location, the modest decor triggers no excitement. Sitting at the sushi bar, I view the assortment of fish. Without wasting a Hollywood minute, I order his signature miso black cod. With a crispy skin, the cod combines sweet miso with mirin.

Tons of sushi aficionados had recommended SB time and again, telling me amazing things of innovative rolls such as spicy tuna with jalapeno in it.\n\nDecent decor but nothing particularly memorable.

We were seated immediately, which is always rare -- dare I say, alarming -- for a good sushi joint.\n\nI started with some miso soup, which I wasn't crazy about. That was worrisome to me, since miso soup is one of those standard things that is usually good if not delicious. I didn't even finish it!\n\nFirst up was some kind of Hawaiian-themed roll with ahi, mango, and cucumber which was okay but kind of bland. Next we had sake (salmon) and maguro nigiri. I am no expert on sushi preparation technique, but the slices of fish on the nigiri were huge and thick, and sliced in a way that left them tough and chewy. They were also lacking in the rice department... each piece of nigiri had about a tablespoon of rice attached, and there was no wasabi in them!!\n\nFinally, I had a roll which is not on the on-line menu, and I can't remember the name of it. The waiter helpfully suggested it when I said I wanted something with crab that wasn't too mayonnaise-y. He described it, quite accurately, as a Rainbow Roll filled with crab instead of rice. It arrived in a beautiful presentation, the slices of the roll arranged in a circle around some dressed mixed greens. I enthusiastically took my first bite and was saddened, then sickened by the plastic, manufactured taste of imitation crab. I know that many MANY rolls are made with imitation crab, but this just had a disgustingly distinct and fake flavor to it. I truly couldn't eat it. I would have sent it back but I was on a date and didn't want to seem overly fussy! :) I simply ate the fish around it but was decent but still not very well sliced.\n\nI would CONSIDER giving this place another go, but I'd have to be convinced by someone who loved it and would order the right things for us!\n\nOne extra star for the \"Sushi Not Bushi\" bumper stickers (and shirts) they produce!

Most importantly the rice to fish combination was excellent, not too much rice and it wasn't packed solid! \n\nAgedashi tofu, soaking in the broth, delicious! The Maui salad was fresh and yummy avocado, mango, macadamia nuts to its mixes! We had a bunch of rolls to share and all were unique and just very different! Hawaiian, Omega 3 with all kinds of fish, Volcano, Waikiki, Yellowtail Basil, everything was just heavenly! \n\nParking was a nightmare but it's worth it, we'll be back!", "author": "Yan M."}

We got our food really quickly and it was great! I'm not too great on chop sticks and had a slightly difficult time eating in because the rolls are really big and I was too embarrassed to ask for a fork, I made do though, can't complain too much about a generous piece of food! The second time my friend and I ordered to go and once again we were given our food quickly and headed back to my house to feast over a glass of wine, this time I cheated with the fork and was in heaven!

In fact, most of their menu consists of their own creations..with the \"typical\" sushi restaurant findings tucked in way at the bottom of a back page. They are saying to you, \"Get those traditional rolls somewhere else.\"\n\nI came here last night for dinner. A last minute decision only because our original destination was closed for vacation. The place was packed, but we still managed to snag 2 seats at the bar. Service is quick--almost a bit rushing, as in, \"let me rush you right out of here so we can have a quicker turnaround.\" I don't like that kind of rush...minus one star. \n\nThe food, however, was decent. More for the creativity than the taste. I ordered the Sexy Scallop. My friend got 5 Wishes. Both were relatively tasty and a nice attempt at introducing something different. Not authentic, but hey, you get those traditional rolls elsewhere, remember? \n\nBetween getting the bill and paying for it, we probably had a 5 minute lag time (during which we were once again rushed by the waiter). Afterwards, they practically threw the unsigned credit card receipt at us. Didn't like that move much, but at least they had good aim. \n\nNot a bad meal, but I still suffered indigestion afterwards. Only this time, it's not from the fish--it's from the service.", "author": "Rona J."}

I've worked in the restaurant industry some and I usually have a rule about three things...never ever order the special, never go to a buffet brunch and never order fish on a Sunday.  This is my rule unless it's a really nice place, so nice they get shipments daily or at least on Saturday, otherwise you are eating whatever didn't sell from the Thursday or Friday shipment.\n\nNow, this place must fly to Hawaii, go to the fish market and get back on the plane to serve dinner that same night because the fish is always soooo unbelievably fresh (and yes, I know I spelt \"so\" wrong, but I don't care!) it just melts in your mouth.\n\nTheir dishes and rolls are very creative with some incorporating macadamia nuts and mango without over-powering the taste and texture of the raw fish.  \n\nPrices are pretty much what you would expect for a nice sushi place, not Ozuma prices, but not Fune Ya (see my other review).  The only issue here is the place is pretty small so you may have to wait for a table. (If it's too long a wait, try Namu next door--review pending--that place is awesome too...maybe I should move!)\n\nThe other great thing is I went here one time and called ahead to find out about a corkage fee, it was $5!

There are always seats opening up at the bar/counter where you can see the chef(s) creating their masterpiece rolls. Order from their specialty section of the menu. Mango inspired sushi roll is a favorite, Hawaiian Breeze. Odd how they come up with some of the names of the rolls? More reminiscent of a line of soaps from a shop.\n\nPlace is small, so it can get crowded and loud. Reggae music is always spinning in the background. Actually good recognize the artist for once in my life. Not a bad choice.\n\nService here is attentive but hit or miss. With such a busy place you might have two different servers. And both will ask if you have ordered, and you will have to ask for something more than once on occasion. They will eventually get it right. The runner at Sushi Bistro was on top of it all though.\n\nAnd the door is broken. It closes so slow letting lots of cold air in. Bring a sweater.", "author": "Ryan G."}

We decided to go to Sushi Bistro.\n\nSushi Bistro was quite good. We had the hamachi kama, uni, big eye tuna nigiri, toro sashimi, two signature Sushi Bistro special rolls M&L forever  (spicy tuna, crab meat, cajun flavored albacore, avocado, and grilled big eye tuna inside a crispy exterior drizzled with bonito sauce.) and the sashimi spirit (shrimp ebi, salmon, ahi tuna, butterfish, tobiko and avocado wrapped in soy paper topped with scallions.) yum yum. As usual, I also got the agedashi tofu. I think I can now openly say that I am an agedashi tofu connoisseur, every Japanese restaurant that I go to, I experience their agedashi tofu. \n\nTo go along with the meal, we got a bottle of Aladdin, a nigori sake that is in a pinkish bottle that reminds you of Aladdin's lamp (woohoo go Disney!)\n\nThe service was great,  the food was brilliant, and they have very innovative sushi rolls. The only downside was portion size for their signature sushi rolls (there were around 8 pieces.. small pieces) and the big eye tuna nigiri was a bit odd, the tuna was a bit torn up and seemed to be stretched on the rice. The toro however was great and melts in your mouth like it should. \n\nAs most good food is, the tab was relatively hefty for the amount of food I ate.

But i prefer the miso cod i make at home.\n\nDrunken Halibut: Alright, but probably wouldn't order it again. Not particularly memorable. The sea bass was better.\n\nHawaiin Breeze roll: Delicious!! I highly recommend this. I loved the mango and apple in the roll it was so refreshing and tastes really good with raw fish. The flavors compliment each other and don't compete. Also i've had macedamia nuts on a few other rolls and it always goes well with fruit and adds a nice texture.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try some more of their creative inventions.

The rolls are unique, full of flavor and do not have a lot of rice wrapped around them. It does make it harder to eat since they're full of fish with little rice so be careful not to break them. The sashimi is amazing, fresh and the platter comes with a huge variety with two of each, perfect for sharing. \n\nThey just moved to a new location so it's not as packed as it used to be. Parking here can be a pain and there are no garages nearby. It is well worth it though. This place is nothing less than phenomenal.", "author": "Ahmed S."}

My date actually introduced me to the place... he  proclaimed it was his favorite sushi spot, regardless of the fact it was also his go-to, uber-convenient neighborhood sushi spot a few blocks away from his house. \n\nThat night we started with the miso black cod on special (a dish I would not normally order) that was like a savory piece of heaven on a plate, lettuce wraps (a choice of \"seasons\" which contain different flavors) and a couple rolls.\n\nI can't say I remember which rolls we got that night, but I've been back several times since I'll just go ahead and list my favorites: Albacore Dream, 49er, Nemo found, Omega 3. There are a ton more, and they are all wildly creative and fun so best bet is to go out on a limb and try something new. And when in doubt, order a roll with avocado.  We joke that there must be a secret avocado orchard oasis in the back of the restaurant because the rolls are literally bursting with the fresh avocado on too-consistent, suspicious basis.\n\nThe sashimi is fresh and the pieces are extremely generous. Ask for a sake recommendation - we got a cold bottle of something I don't remember, other than it being delicious. (This is the kind you won't necessarily want to yell \"sake!\" and slam a beer with, you actually want to take your time to enjoy.)\n\nThe atmosphere is extremely comfortable and friendly. And added bonus, they serve you a scoop of free ice cream to cap off your meal. Flippin' sweet. \n\nI wouldn't recommend going here with a group larger than 4 people, since it's a small place, but regardless of party size, you will most likely need reservations any day of the week. The fare is extremely reasonable, so if you want to go nuts on some great sushi and not feel totally guilty...you totally can.\n\nEven if I had a horrendous, mind-numbing, run-away-screaming-and- lighting-my-hair-on-fire sort of date, I would still risk coming back again and again for the amazing sushi. But fortunately for me, I did not, and my boy and I make it a habit of spending a lot of quality time here.", "author": "Kelly R."}

Background music went from ibiza mix to depeche mode to journey, but thankfully no mash-ups.  So, not the place for a contemplative solo experience at the sushi bar, but the crowd seemed pretty upbeat.\n\nSushi: The salmon nigiri was very average, a bit tough and not that flavorful.  Hamachi nigiri was decent though not divine.  Same with the C2 roll.  The fish seemed unexceptional from a freshness standpoint.  I agree with the other reviewer who said that the fish/rice proportion for the nigiri was off.  I'm not an advocate of getting full from rice, but there just wasn't enough of it.  Priced a bit high for the quality you get.\n\nService: They need to hire a couple of extra people to achieve reasonably attentive service.  It looked like only two servers were handling the entire place.  They were hustling, but I went long stretches without hearing from anyone, especially at the end when I needed the bill so I could roll out of there.  It would have seemed even longer had I not struck up a conversation with the friendly couple sitting near me.  Once I got the bill, it charged me for an extra beer - a bit odd but I'll chalk it up to all the commotion.", "author": "Leon R."}

They don't go too crazy with their special rolls like at other places where it gets so crazy you forget that you're eating at a sushi place. Their rolls are perfectly portioned and the fish is always their main star. Not the deep-fried batter surrounding, over-mayoed crab salad or disproportionate cucumber/avacado - its their fresh fish. And prices? Wellllll worth. Not too high and not jaw-droppingly low either but worth every penny. \n\nThe New Legend, my favorite roll is a must. Their salad wraps are super yummy as well though filling (go for the Equinox). Wait staff friendly though often very frazzled because there is usually a line out the door no matter what day it is (reservations are recommended).

Yes, it's totes them.\n\nAnyway, I went to SB technically two more times before I left the neighborhood. The first time we walked in, it was pretty busy like usual on a Saturday night. In the past, I'd walk in and get an acknowledgment and asked how many in my party. This time, no eye contact, nothing. When a table opened up, the guy gestured in our direction so I started walking over there but the host gave me a dirty look and I realized it was for another couple. The host then said, \"Did you put your name on the list?!\" And I was like wtf, there was never a list before, even on their busiest nights. I said, \"No...\" and he gave me serious attitude. He must have realized he was being a total a-hole because he seemed to soften and said, \"How many?\" By that time I was on my way out the door.\n\nThe service has never been super warm or friendly so I understand it could have been a real off night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-09-14", "description": "Another yuppie restaurant with those for no true appreciation of good food. One lesson I've learned in life about Asian restaurants... When you walk into an Asian restaurant and the place is chock full of white people, the food is likely not going to be good. This was definitely the case with Sushi Bistro. The second I walked in and saw the place teeming with white people I knew I should've turned around and walked right out, but I was with 3 other friends and didn't want to make a scene. We ordered Monk fish Liver and Kumamoto oysters for an appetizer and the one thing I can comment on is that the oysters did not taste very fresh. I'm not very big on liver so I couldn't tell you if the monk fish liver was good or not, but my friend who does eat quite a bit of fish liver said it was definitely sub-par.. We proceeded to order 3 rolls including the African Spider, Monster In-Laws and the Sexy Scallop. The Sexy Scallop came out first and the scallops tasted like they had just been defrosted and were still soggy with a hint of mush. The Monster In-Laws arrived next with jalapenos on top that were so unevenly cut that some were a couple of mm's thick and others were so thin that only half the jalapeno cross section was there. Anyone ever heard of a mandoline? The fish was also clearly old, not to the point of being smelly yet, but enough that the fish mushed in your teeth. Then came the worst crime of all, the African Spider roll. To qualify my next statement I have to tell you that I order spider rolls almost every time I go out for rolls. This spider roll was the worst I've ever had. The only detail we need to get into is the soft-shell crab because that is what makes a spider roll a spider roll. I'm not even sure that there was any soft-shell crab because there was so much batter on the alleged \"crab\" because all I could taste was the fried batter. They left a couple pieces of the fried soft-shell crab on the plate outside the roll which was a nice thought, but I was extremely disappointed when all I tasted was extremely over seasoned deep fried batter. \n\nNow that we've covered the food I can talk about something that I rarely talk about at a restaurant, the service. I don't mind service that isn't great, after all I keep going back to \"The House\" in North Beach, but Sushi Bistro was downright horrendous. The first sign that the service was going to be bad was when they asked if we were ready to order and when we told them that we needed a few minutes. The server calmly walked away and 10 seconds later walked back to ask us if we were ready to order. But to be honest, I don't even mind that. What I mind is when the server clanks your water glasses and plates down on the table so loudly that you probably could have heard it across the room in one of the noisiest dining rooms I've ever been in. What was even worse than that was that is that instead of moving existing plates on the table to put new plates down the server took the new plates and pushed the already existing plates out of the way after clanking the new plates on the table. Terrible.... \n\nNeedless to say we walked out after just 2 appetizers and 3 rolls and went next door to finish our dinner. \n\nI hate to make racial comments, but I'm a Korean who has grown up in SoCal and I've come to learn that a majority of non-Asians have no idea what Asian food is about regardless of how cosmopolitan they think they are. Point and case is that most rolls in America have mayo and or avocado.. Neither are used in Japan because they don't need the fattiness of either item to hide the taste of bad sushi... \n\nWord to the wise, if you ever walk into an Asian restaurant full of non-asians, walk right back out...", "author": "Joe Y."}

And he was right.\n\nAs for the sushi ... oh man I wish I had the stomach and the funds to try every single thing on the menu. But what I did try was amazing. The Spicy Crunchy was by far my fave and the M&L Forever and C-2 were easily tied for second. The Black Weeds I'd probably not get again but still, totally unique and yummy at the same time.

We tried the butterfish blaster (butterfish wrapped around crab meat), spicy tuna roll, tempura roll, and tuna, trout and ebi sashimi. The sashimi slices are very generous portions -- not your standard sushi joint sizes. Overall, the meal felt extremely authentic.\n\nFor price and quality, I give this place 5 stars.

It has a slightly sweet and spicy garlic sauce, so I can eat it w/o the soy and wasabi. Others at the table had traditional bento box/tempura fare.

Minor details. Down to the food.\n\nWe ordered tempura as an appetizer, because we wanted fried food. It was not so different from any other tempura out there. Shrimp though had too much breading. Then we ordered two rolls-Billie Jean and Hawaiian Breeze. Billie Jean had lobster in it. It was good but the aioli sauce was a bit too creamy for me. Hawaiian breeze was delicious. Fuji apple and nuts in a sushi roll....who knew it could be such a good combo? That's the great thing about this place, they are quite creative. The flavors of each roll was subtle but go very well together.  You can tell serious thoughts were put into the menu.

The roll itself was very small and thin, and fried almost to oblivion.  I could not recognize or taste anything beyond the crunchy-hard fried tempura texture and the gobs of sriracha sauce glomped over the dish.\n\nSpicy crunchy -- hamachi, salmon, snapper, shrimp, lightly deep fried,  topped with macadamia nuts and served with \"spicy house sauce.\" Again, very heavy handed with the fryer. I could not discern the 4 different types of fish in the roll and sriracha once again made an ubiquitous and gloppy appearance.\n\nC-2 - the most decent roll of the evening - baby lobster and avocado topped with tempura, and drizzled with eel sauce.  Eel sauce = sweet teriyaki.\n\nMy biggest disappointment was with our pick from the \"Something Unique\" section of the menu -- I don't remember the name, and it appears to be a new item that's not listed on the website -- basically billed as tempura-fried oysters with tasty sauce... When it came out, it was impressive indeed - served in a huuuuge 6-inch long giant oyster shell.  The portions are fairly generous - 4 individual oysters with onion and other sauce fillers.

Not for traditionalists but if you are looking for a huge selection of different, funky rolls, you can't go wrong. The waiter was helpful in offering his recos. After staring at the menu for 10 min, I ultimately ordered:\n\nEquinox lettuce wrap - interesting concept, I enjoyed the different textures and tastiness.\nButterfish Blasters - crab, avocado and wrapped in butterfish; sriacha hotsauce on the side. solid.\nSexy Scallop - decent but not amazing.\nUni (nigiri) - overflowing uni = goodness.\n\nDined on a Friday night after calling ahead for a reservation, which I'd recommend. Line was long but having a reso got us quickly seated. Nice. The rolls came super fast and we were so hungry, the food was gone in 15 min max. I am still full.

You will get four silken innard crispy fried blocks of soy - sprinkled with nori, daikon and other fried (possibly fish based) sprinkly things. But it's the accompanying broth that soaks into the crust around the tofu that you're after. Satisfying, sweet, salty, umami. \n\nYes, yes, then get onto ordering lettuce wrap rolls (Solstice is a good one), mango chicken salad, ahi poke, karaage...etc. All freshly prepared, delicious, and innovative. Gyoza are small, but plump. \n\nHowever, let it not be said the place is without it's faults. First of all, parking is the biggest bitch I've ever faced. The Richmond needs to lick some yelper's sweaty n*&sack for some better parking. Second, I remember taking my friend Nick here and saying:\n\"I thought you would like this place, it's hipster and you're kind of hipster. \" \n\nit nearly ended our friendship.

Got a hefty appetite? just order a side of rice with it and you're set. \n\nThere is a large selection of rolls. Most have some type tempura battered deal in it and gets confusing. My first visit we made the mistake of ordering so many of these rolls the flavor profiles all started to taste the same. My advice?  Order one or two max w/the tempura deal (I loved the african spider) so you can appreciate the roll on its own and balance it with other items.\n\nOther things to note: \nNice staff, nice vibe, nice music \nI was surprised by their logo design, simply out-dated esp. for such a edgy town.", "author": "C T."}

We called at 5:45pm while en route to the restaurant and asked for a reservation for two at 6:30pm - well, no tables, but they were able to put us down for the sushi bar.  When we arrived at 6:30, they opened up a table for us instead!  The service was very good - prompt and attentive, water always filled, beer glass never empty too long, plates cleared quickly, and importantly the servers were not intrusive or too involved with chatting up the clientele. \n\nI agree with previous reviewers that this is not your typical japanese restaurant.  It definitely has more of a sports bar/lounge vibe with dark ambiance (too dark for us), flat screen tv's, and LOUD music (turn it down a little so we can enjoy the excellent food please).\n\nThe food was quite delicious, and average to slightly above average in price.   Butterfish blasters to start with (crab meat, avocado wrapped in butterfish and then seared - served with a spicy soy glaze), damn good.  Nigiri sushi next - hamachi, toro, uni, and amaebi (with deep fried shrimp heads with ponzu dipping sauce); huge cuts of fish, tiny ball of rice. Not really your classic ratio of rice:fish for nigiri, but I won't argue with the generous cuts of fish.  Very fresh and tasty.  The toro was too chewy (we've had much better toro at Ozumo) due to presence of some of the tough connective tissue.  Next we had rolls - in my opinion, this is their forte and what most people come for.  Creative, flavorful, and definitely off the beaten path.  We had the First Crush (spicy albacore tuna, fuji apple, topped with salmon and ginger cilantro ponzu sauce with brown rice), mouth watering good.  We followed this with the Sashimi Spirit (ebi, salmon, ahi tuna, butterfish, tobiko and avocado topped with scallions); a mouthful of flavors that blended together well but lost the individual characteristics.

We waited 45mins to sit down and even then these reserved tables were still EMPTY!!!! The only way to eat there now is to make a reservation or wait until the 10 seats at the sushi bar are available.\n\nIn my humble opinion, I don't think they need to reserve that many tables.

After seeing that they had 4 stars after about 250 reviews, I decided that I should try to infiltrate this den of deliciousness and see for myself what I had been missing.\n\nIt was super busy when I walked in but was seated right away due to my impeccable timing (a couple was just leaving and there was nobody in front of us).

Awesome.  The nigiri was good.  Huge pieces of hamachi over a smidgen of rice.  The large amount of wasabi on the side the size of a ping pong ball was exactly the size necessary to satiate my sinuses.  \n\nThe rolls were inventive and delicious and super huge.  I think we had 4 rolls and a few orders of nigiri and were totally stuffed.  oh yeah, that was on top of the fried oysters and gyoza, all of which disappeared rather quickly from the plates.  \n\nBefore long, we had both noticed that the itamae was drinking with some of the people sitting at the bar and we both felt a pang of jealousy take over our hearts.

First, this place serves rolls in a style that is unique to any other sushi restaurant I have ever been to.  I recommend \"Dave's Legacy\", a roll that is not listed on the menu, but offers such ingredients as deep fried Japanese pumpkin amongst other ingredients.  They are always on the search for interesting ingredients.  \n\nSecond, they are a small family run business who offer a great environment.  I have been lucky enough to get to know them quite will and they always treat me like family.  I live in Southern California and often frequent the Bay Area; after \"stumbling\" on this place, I have a hard time going out to sushi in my own area.\n\nLastly, go for the Butterfish Blaster.  I should not have to say anything else about this.  Just do it.", "author": "Brandon E."}

Still the place gets pretty busy and there can be a short wait in the entry way that is murder because you're basically forced to watch the other patrons feast while trying to hold your hunger together.\n\nTo be honest, I've never had any of their traditional sushi rolls because I never make it to that part of the menu.  Mainly I can't get passed the \"Signature Rolls\" and \"Something Unique\".  The Ahi Tower with spicy dipping sauce, the Hot Love with baked crab and lobster, the Caucasian Afro with spicy tuna and gaucamole, OMG the Drunken Halibut, and the C-2. I die.\n\nDon't miss out on the fried oysters either.  SO GOOD.  Decent alcohol prices too so don't be afraid to come here for a pre or post celebration.\n\nStill, I get the feeling that this is the kind of place that you either love or hate, and you sort of need to know what to order.  Parking is miserable but that's SF.\n\nSo the moral of this story is the decor/vibe, whimsical sushi names and deep flavors may definitely make the panties come off.

I was quick to think of all the GREAT restaurants in the city especially by me so I didn't have to travel so far living in the mission in all. Well, turned out they also knew someone in SF that was joining us for dinner that had ALREADY chosen Sushi Bistro (ummm a couple of blocks where he lived...guess we were thinking the same). So I went on to my trusty YELP to see what this place was like and see what you guys thought. I must admit I was a bit skeptical reading some of the reviews saying it was overrated. But to my surprise dish after dish was AMAZING! I couldn't believe it. We had the following (at least from what I remember);\n\nThe new legend - A MUST!\nSashimi salad - we were licking the plate on this one\nAfrican Spider (which apparently won some award...yeah whatever its DAMN GOOD!!!!)\nAnd some sashimi a la carte...which was also really good but definitely not the highlight.\n\nAnd the prices were just as great!

Their classic rolls are good, but their creative combinations really stand out. Give them a try -- you almost certainly won't be disappointed. The place is tiny and a bit cramped, but it's a fair trade for the great food. OK, this is probably not your best choice if you're a purist, but if you're willing to take risks (the fun kind, not the will-this-make-me-throw-up? kind), the payoff is definitely worth it. Delish!\n\nEDIT: They've just changed/expanded their menu, which now includes some yummy-looking brown rice rolls. I did not order any of them because I forgot to bring my gluten-free tamari sauce, but as I was chatting with the waiter after dinner, I mentioned that and he said, \"Oh, we have tamari sauce you can use.\" I hadn't even thought to ask because nobody ever has it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-06-02", "description": "Since Yelp doesn't let you do half-stars, I need to clarify the rating and say that I give this restaurant 3.5 stars. Further clarification on how I feel about sushi. I'm less interested in the debate between \"authentic\" sushi and \"neo\" or \"nouveau\" sushi. If you're one of those sushi purists/traditionalists, this probably isn't the place for you. That said, I feel a little let down after eating here. All the glowing Yelp reviews and personal recommendations from friends got me excited to come here and try this place. This excitement was further compounded when I read over the menu online before coming here and saw the different takes the chef had on sushi. Perhaps my expectation was too high, but still I haven't felt this let down since I found out Jennifer Garner married Ben Affleck. \n\nWe went on a Sunday night around 8 and walked in with no reservations, there was some space at the bar so we were seated immediately. The first thing I noticed was the din. People were conversing loudly to try and be heard over the pounding music. Even sitting in a tight knit group at the bar, my companions and I had to huddle closely to hear each other. No biggie, I've been in loud places before. I liked that they had a decent selection of sake, including 2 of my favorites, Karatamba and Otokayama. I especially liked that they served the sake in wooden boxes, as it should be served.\n\nOn to the food, I had a hard time deciding what to eat, all the descriptions in the menu made everything sound so tasty. I eventually settled for the Spicy Girl (avocado wrapped with spicy white tuna and macadamia nuts), African Spider Roll (Cajun flavored albacore, salmon, soft shell crab in spicy house sauce), and Monster-In-Laws (spicy albacore, cuccumer, onion, topped with yellowtail, jalapeno, and ponzu sauce). I also ordered the yellow tail belly, toro, and kanpachi nigiri. My first impression was that everything was extremely fresh. If nothing else, you know this fish hasn't been sitting around all night under ice like the last kid at dodgeball waiting to be picked. The cuts on the nigiri were large and very clean. The rolls too were very fresh. I especially liked the African Spider Roll, the avocado and fish inside the roll made a good contrast to the perfectly fried soft shell crab (nothing worse than an overly greasy soft shelled crab that tastes like it came from a KFC fryer). The spicy house sauce had a nice little kick to it. The Monster-In-Laws was also good and the jalapeno provided the right amount of heat in each bite. \n\nNow the bad news, some of the plates my companions ordered missed their mark. The Caucasian Afro (spicy tuna mixed with guacamole, onions, tomato sauce, garnished with fried potato vermicelli) was not spicy as advertised and tasted more of avocado than anything else. The Sashimi Spirit (sushi ebi, salmon, ahi tuna, albacore, tobiko, and avocado wrapped in soy paper) was again fresh, but seemed like it was trying to do too much at once with all the flavors. They all kind of muddled together and you didn't get a sense of what the flavor profile was. My companions also ordered the Aloha 101 (Ahi tuna, mango, and cucumber, flash fried and served with spicy garlic sauce), which on the surface sounds really good, but I didn't taste the mango and when you dip it in the garlic sauce, it kinds of kills the other flavors. They also had the Sexy Scallop and Spicy Crunchy rolls. \n\nMy biggest complaint has to be after eating half of all our rolls, they all started tasting the same. You could literally close your eyes, pick a roll at random and eat it and have no idea what you just ate. Herein lies my disappointment. With so much fresh fish at his disposal and so much obvious creative aptitude, the chef could have really come up with some distinct flavor profiles. If anything, I thought he was a little heavy-handed with the sriracha. I love this stuff, but when it gets thrown around too much, everything starts tasting like it. \n\nSo if you come here, stick with the nigiri for the most part. Order one or two rolls to get a sample, and wash it all down with sake from a box.", "author": "Tony V."}

Got a seat for 2 immediately at the bar.  \n\nThe bar is nice because there's actually a lot more room than other bars.  BF and I ordered:\n\n10 piece nigiri combo ($18) - Mmmm!!  HUGE slices of fish with teeny tiny balls of rice (which is how it should be).  Most of the fish was fresh.  The only one that was slightly questionable was the Hamachi...but maybe it was only that one piece that I had, since the other Hamachi was fine.  Great deal for the amount of fish you get!  I would definitely order it again.\n\nHawaiian Breeze roll ($12) - the BF LOVED IT! it had a nice clean, crisp taste to it.  It was a good kind of different.\n\nNegi-Hama cut roll ($7?) - Unlike many other places, we got BIG pieces of hamachi in the roll.  With a little cucumber and avocado. \n\nSpider Roll ($9 i think) - It was okay.  Not the best.  Over fried...a little too oily.  I think it's best to stick with their fresh fish here.  Wouldn't order this one again, but it wasn't bad. \n\nOh and you get a small dish of cucumber salad (pickled cucumber)...i love that stuff..just like how my mom makes it!\n\nAfter all that, a cup of tea ($1.50), an large order of house sake (7? or 8), the bill came out to be $58 (post tax, pre tips).

I give it a 3 and not a 2 b/c  the fish was amazingly fresh and they had good service. BUT: \n\nCons: \n-As good as they sound on the menu, the rolls are overcomplicated with too many ingredients. \n-The place is overpriced IMO b/c the portions are ridiculously small.  I really hate how they don't tell you there won't be any rice on the rolls and when there is rice, there's so little you can't event ell. \n\nWe got 3 rolls. \n\nThe five wishes roll was like any rainbow roll.  However instead of seaweed they use soy paper.  The slices of fish was really fresh, but there was no rice in the roll and the imitation crab was way too runny and had too much mayo.\n\nthe African Spider Roll alright.  They try to make it sound exotic in the description on the menu, too bad, it tasted as good as any typical Spider roll, and prob would be better if they didn't put 2304389 diff ingredients in it. \n\nThe sexy scallop was kind of gross.  They put some weird milky, sweet sauce mixed with the scallops that made it taste overly fishy.  I'm not a very picky sushi eater but i scooped off the scallop topping on entire roll after trying one piece.  THey ruin the consistency of the albacore by chopping it up.

Their creative rolls and generous proportions definitely keep me coming back. I've been here a few times and I always try to order something new because they have so many options!! Not only are their rolls great but their entree dishes are amazing as well.. I really love the Ahi tuna poke, where I'd have to say they DO NOT skimp out on the pieces or size of the Ahi tuna! A definite plus!! \n\nSushi Bistro just moved from it's old location, literally one door down, to a bigger and nicer spot! I'd have to say that they are much speedier at seating you then at the old location ( it was a little crammed and smaller,) and the space is much nicer. \n\nTheir prices are average for sushi, not extremely cheap but not overpriced either..

Sure, we have great food down here in the South Bay, and we have places that are even hip, too, with charm--and parking....and oh who am I kidding?  So many places up in the city just have a 'vibe' or a 'soul' that is lacking here in the heart of the silicon valley and Sushi Bistro is a great example.\n\nI solo-dine more often than not and sitting at the sushi bar gives me something to do instead of read a book like the lonely dork I am.  \n\nI scored agadashi Tofu, an African Spider roll and hamachi sashimi before heading out to see Diving Bell at the Embarcadero.  \n\nThe Tofu was ok.  The tofu itself was very silky, which made eating the giant cubes impossible.  I have a surgeons touch when it comes to using chopsticks and I still made mush out of it.  A tofucidal STAB STAB approach worked the best.\n\nThe African Spider Roll was very good.  The soft shell crab was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Unfortunately the sashimi that was inside was all but obscured by the crab.  Still, it was good.\n\nThe Hamachi Sashimi was a highlight.  Most of the time quality is inversely proportional to size....not here.  They served up two very large slices of sashimi to my surprise.  But unlike every other sushi joint I've ever been to that serves up massive pieces, Sushi Bistro slices it THIN instead of big-chunk style.  \n\nThe Reggae music they had going on was a great relief.

I.E., no DJ, no mood lighting, no modern decor, etc.  The room is tiny, in fact, and rather plain.  BUT, they do take reservations, and we did not have to wait but a second for our table. BRING YOUR JACKET!!  They have one those doors that opens automatically, but also closes automatically, which means it takes ages.  However, watching people try to close the door is excellent entertainment.\n\nFood and drinks arrive quickly.  If you order some dishes that are cold, and some that are hot (with tempura, for instance) ask for the cold ones first, so you don't feel rushed.  Everything was delicious.  They heat the edamame in butter (always good in my book, but I'm from Alabama), and use plenty of salt.

On the wonderful side, their cold sake list is amazing, and the quality of their fish, when it's good, rivals the best sushi around. Their crab meat is quite superb, and so I end up going for rolls that include it (and adding it to rolls, like the 49'er, that don't).

Lets face it, most sushi restaruants follow similar rules on portion size and such, so we had not expected the massive pieces of fresh nigiri that landed on our plates. I gobbled them appreciatively, happy to be tasting the big tender pieces of fish with just a hint of the rice below (Just how I like it!). \n\nMy Nigiri Picks: Hamachi and Albacore shown the brightest, but Sake and Maguro were good to! \nMy Roll pick: We didnt try the more festive rolls, opting for the traditional. My fav was old trustie: Negi-Hama (hamachi, green onion, and cucumber)\n\nOnly hiccup, hence the 4 stars...we ordered edamame as we waited, which didnt come, ordered it again, still didnt come, finally on third try got those salty beans after our many plates of sushi showed up.

I'm really glad I found this place!\n\nOnce I stepped in to this restaurant, you can tell that this place is very American. The majority of the waiters/waitresses were Caucasian and had no Japanese decor, but we let the food decide if this Japanese restaurant is worthy or not. We heard the butterfish was really good here, so we ordered the butterfish blaster (snow crab meat and avocado wrapped in butterfish torched with a garlic-soy), crouching tiger hidden dragon roll (shrimp tempura, aioli, avocado & cucumber, topped with unagi and eel sauce), and C-2 roll (baby lobster, avocado and cucumber topped with shrimp tempura, drizzled with eel sauce). When you come here, you HAVE to order the butterfish blaster! It's the most delicious thing EVER. That was my favorite out of the three things I've ordered. My second favorite would be the crouching tiger hidden dragon roll because it resembles the dragon roll, and I LOVE dragon rolls. C-2 was very good too.\n\nThis restaurant is a bit pricey on the rolls, but definitely worth it. Parking may be a problem during the evening time.

This is not my first visit to this place and i have never been disappointed till yesterday evening. What is the most terrible thing - I was communicating and dealing with the owner of SB himself (which i realized later). When I entered the restaurant there were 2 tables unoccupied - for 4 people each (created by putting 2 tabled for 2 together). Both tables had the sign \"Reserved\" on them.\nAnswering that there are 2 of us I was told that the waiting time is 20 minutes. In the line there is only my husband and I - no other people. We waited for another 5 minutes, then 3 people showed up from behind and the SB host (owner as I learned later) asked them the same question  he asked me \"How many of you?\". They answered: \"3\", and he replied: \"You can occupy this table\" and he removed the sign \"Reserved\" .  I then proceeded to ask this guy \"Do these people have reservations? \", He said \"No\". My question was \"then why did you seat them before us, and we have to wait 20 minutes?\" He answered \"Yes.\" \nWhatever questions I would ask him he would just simply answer, \"Yes\" with the nicest smile on his face, as if he wasn't even listening to me. I then asked him again, \"Why did you seat these 3 people before us?\" He smiled and just pointed his finger to a sign reading, \"We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.\"\nI felt humiliated and completely disrespected.  I am a good customer of this restaurant and just wanted to enjoy a night out with my husband. I just don't see why this man, who is the \"owner\", would disregard his customers in such a rude manner. I generally loved this restaurant, but after being mistreated like that in front of all the other customers, I don't think I can ever enjoy myself here again.", "author": "Helen T."}

No way! Chicken teriyaki is good everywhere!\" Well, let me tell you. NO. SB's version of chicken teriyaki is a dried out chicken breast from safeway with black pepper all over it. Fusion? NOPE. Just bad.\n\n**Nigiri. It's really not nigiri. HUGE pieces of fish (which were fresh btw and tasted good) with a small bit of rice - About half the size of the average American's pinkie finger. FAIL. I don't mind the huge pieces of fish, even though that's not the right way of cutting it, but the rice under it was a joke. A big reason why I'm giving only two stars is because there was a scale on my salmon which ended up in my mouth... To me - this just shows careless preparation...and when I'm eating raw fish, I think care is pretty important ;) First scale I've gotten anywhere in a LONG time....disappointing.\n\n**Service - It just wasn't there. Not professional. Most were friendly but still not professional. I'm not talking 4 star service or anything, just simple, straight up good service. The waiters all struck me as bar tenders, not as waiters in a Japanese/Sushi joint...MEH.\n\n**FLIES - There were flies...Buzzing around while we were eating. We were sitting closer to the kitchen than anyone else so not everyone would notice this but they were definitely there. Flies = dirty kitchen. I can't remember the last Japanese place I went to that had flies...Well, I can...But let's just say that I haven't gone back to it...\n\nSo all in all - Good rolls but none that blew me out of the water.

On such a rainy day, we don't want to go too far away from home and decided to give SB a trial.  It turned out to be a good decision.\n\nThe place is nice, just the music is a bit too loud for talking.  And, since we sat near to the door (the place was packed and we did not have choice or we wanted to sit at the bar), it's so cold and the door was frequently opened and closed.\n\nThe food is good.  I ordered a 12pc sashimi; it's so fresh and big in size.  It becomes my hubby's favorite.  As a sashimi fan, I would say that it worths the price $16.99 for that kind of quality and quantity.  The 2nd thing I ordered was Agedashi tofu, it's okay, not outstanding but hot enough when it's served.  The spider roll was good but not distinctive.  I should never ordered the chicken teriyaki and tempura.  The chicken was so dry and the sauce was so salty.  Tempura was good, shrimps were quite fresh, the pumpkin was tasty as well as the yam and potato.\n\nHowever, the beer was really expensive, $6 for a bottle of Asahi.\n\nThe service was not impressive though all the waiters and waitresses were nice.

The sesame chicken was a disappointment (v. bland), but not too shabby when dipped in the Aloha 101 sauce. And the sea bass was okay.

Don't dumb it down by flash frying, breading, adding avocado, warming it up, etc.  I just want fish flesh.\n\n2. occasionally raw: yes, raw fish can be good.  but it's better when diluted with avocado, flash friedness, and other delectable veggies or warmth to hide the rawness.\n\nI fall somewhere in the middle.

I was still skeptical when I went inside to see who was behind the sushibar, but boy, really my loss. \n\nThe nigiri here ROCKS!  Very fresh, HUGE cuts, larger than the sashimi slices at other places.  My only complaint is that they use so little rice for their nigiri here that when you dab it in soysauce, it's easy to lose it.  Would be nice if they pre-added some wasabi too, but those are trivial details.  I particularly liked the butterfish and the yellowtail belly.  They aren't stingy with their toro either, it was the same size as everything else.  Very well priced, I was caught off guard by their sushi combination, which left me pretty full.  However, as all the other yelpers say, do get the tuna poke salad, the tuna is ordinary but the sauce is zesty and they add these little crunchy salty things that adds a ton of flavor and texture.  The hamachi kama was not nearly as good as the other stuff though.\n\nThe only thing holding me back from a 5star rating is the in/out nature of this place.  The wait (as you might imagine) can be quite long for the value of the sushi, and it takes awhile to be seated.  While the staff will never ask you to hurry up, they do little things like asking to take away your plates, slipping you the check to try to rush you out for the next table.

They definitely had a great menu that spoke to me cuz they didn't just lay it out like normal; they gave u recommendations if you wanted something unique.  \n\nI got the \"double jeaopardy\", which tasted kinda like avocado dip with sashimi(which I loved).  I also had the 'sashimi spirit', which was a bit on the puny side but it was really tasty and fresh.  I had a side of salmon sashimi, which was huge!  The pieces were definitely huge, and tasted so fresh.\n\nWe also ordered a combination beef teri + tempura just in case we don't get full at the end.  It was alright, but definitely not their specialty.  Nothing special.\n\nOverall, although I disagree with the prices, i kinda expected it for such a fancy place.  I wasn't completely thrilled with the fact that my hot sake was done in the microwave in clear sight of my table.  Also, i know more customers mean more business, but they seemed a little pushy there to get me to finish my food right away and out the door.  The service was just a bit impatient, but still polite and warm.\n\nIt's not a place I'm going to frequent as a regular, but its definitely worth the occasional trip.  Everything was fresh, so I guess you do get what you pay for :)", "author": "Evan T."}

I heard a few people mention positive things about it so I was hoping for good sushi.  What I got was OK food.  First off, we ordered the seared halibut marinated in some miso sauce (Drunken Halibut?).  I was expecting a little fillet of halibut, but all i got where 8 measly slivers of halibut in some oily miso sauce.  The fish and the sauce didn't work well together which resulted in bland seared halibut.  I kept re-dipping the sliver into the sauce hoping to taste something.  Next I tried their Mackerel and Yellow-tail Nigiri.  The Nigiri looked weird in that the fish slab was HUGE compared to the rice which made the fish look kind of gross.  I enjoyed the Mackerel Nigiri which was tasty, the Yellow-tail however was bland and served too cold.  I had to eat some ginger just to warm my palate back up.   Afterward, the rolls we ordered came in.  First was the rainbow roll.  Looked like your typical rainbow roll however, for 9 bucks, i was expecting some imitation crab meat with cucumber and avocado on the inside of the roll.  What we got was a massive amount of imitation crab meat in a roll with with the diameter of a half dollar coin.  I felt like I was eating at some sushi buffet and tasted like it too!  Next came in the Spicy Crunchy roll.  This was a deep fried roll (which we didn't expect).  It arrived on a plate drizzled in some Mustard sauce and Hot sauce.  To put it briefly BLAND and boring despite their sauce efforts.  Last came the special roll of the day which had marinated seared fatty tuna on top with tempura asparagus, and other stuff inside.  It was presented on a plate with pesto sauce.  I was looking forward to this roll because it had Fatty Tuna, but it turned into a disappointing mess of flavors -- I had no idea what I was tasting.  All that flavor made it pointless to use fatty tuna on top -- they could use halibut, or yellow tail and it would taste the same and the roll would've been cheaper.\n\nAnyways, summary: I felt all there rolls were too done up with sauces.  Most of their rolls are cooked too so if you're a fan of raw fish and subtle taste, I recommend K's Kitchen on Monterey which has unique and fancy rolls with flavors that actually work together without being overpowering.  You'll be spending the same for better food.  If you prefer more cooked rolls, I think Kiki's or Kitaro's or a sushi boat have similar stuff for half the price.  You're basically paying for the atmosphere and better grade of fish (if you order the raw fish).  \n\nAtmosphere:  to loud.  Even the servers couldn't hear us.", "author": "Connie C."}

He had yelped the place and heard of some great reviews. \n\nLike always, we sat at the sushi bar because I love mingling with the sushi chefs. However, they were a little too busy to be chatting with us. I didn't mind because we were able to spend the evening to ourselves. The range of items on the menu were overwhelming. I didn't even know where to start. I'm a huge tuna/toro fan and so I picked out a few tuna dishes. We also got a sashimi plate and the cuts were BIG. I really liked that because they weren't being shady with their fish cuts like A LOT of restaurants that I've been to.\n\nThe only reason I would give this place 4 stars and not the 5 would be because the parking was ridic. My boyfriend had to circle around the place for about 30 minutes and we almost missed our reservation had I not gotten out and went in while he searched for parking. We ended up parking 4 blocks away from the restaurant. -_-\n\nBut for any sushi lover who is looking for some new creative dishes in sushi, this place is a must. They are certainly unique in their rolls and it gives you a fresh perspective on sushi dishes. \n\nThe restaurant itself is fairly small so I would recommend trying it out with no more than 2-4 people.", "author": "Laura Y."}

We got there as soon as it strikes 5 o clock and was seated by a host, who was very kind and polite. Ehh.. prolly not what i thought. \n\nLet's skip to the service! Anyway, SB gives you this complimentary cucumber salad thing which is in the same amount as the pickled ginger. Well, i finished mine and wanted some more, the host straight up was like uhhhhhh well do you want to buy a side order of that... in my mind, I am like WTF, a side order of what you give for FREE????? uhhhh, my bf was like go ahead just order it. A huge bowl of cucumber salad comes out... and I am like UHHHHHHH, I honestly did not need that much CUCUMBERS, but okay?? \n\nAnyway, if I asked for some more, just give it to me, what did you expect? I was gonna keep asking all night for 5 more pieces of your damn cucumbers.. goodness! Perhaps, before you make that type of judgement, see how much food we ordered.

Not only is the restaurant staffed by attentive and responsive servers, the fish is fresh, the portions generous, and the price of admission won't break the bank.\n\nI visited this sushi spot for the second time just last week. A word of caution: parking around this area can be a lesson in futility. You can easily circle like a hawk for that elusive parking space for a half hour or more and find nothing. Don't let this deter you! Sushi Bistro is unarguably worth your patience.\n\nAlso, MAKE RESERVATIONS. This is a popular sushi spot and regularly draws a respectable crowd who can't fit in this modestly sized eatery. The result? Oftentimes a considerable wait just without, in the fog and cold.\n\nOur party ordered virtually all the signature rolls during our last visit and the standouts are the \"Hawaiian breeze,\" \"new wave mahi-mahi,\" and \"watermelon-man,\" all of which contained a surprisingly refreshing burst of various complementary flavors. Sashimi is extremely fresh and served in good sized portions.\n\nTo sum it up, Sushi Bistro is well worth your money and your wait, though the latter can be minimized if you plan ahead and make reservations.

This sushi gem which just relocated a couple doors down is a great restaurant to get the freshest and most unique rolls ever.  I go in and don't even need a menu anymore. Things use MUST try are: Butterfish Blaster, African Spider, Ahi Poke Speacial, Double Jeopardy. \n\nOnce you get there you'll be greeted by David who when I first started going did everything by himself host, bus, and serve. Now he still helps everywhere but he has a few others to help. Make reservations when you go in because it is always crowed because the word is out. \n\nThe rolls here are very satisfying because they come larger than normal and don't skip out on the good stuff from snow crab to the butterfish. And the sashimi is very generous sizes. Swing by and enjoy excellence.", "author": "Nathan H."}

I ordered my self an order of Toro Nigiri along with other sushi, everything came except the Toro. After I decided to ask the waiter where is the nigiri i ordered and he replied with I already brought it. I was confused since I never received it, after which he said is was brought along with other nigiri that was ordered on the other end of the table. Now I might be going a little too far but when a person orders something at a restaurant aren't they supposed to bring it to me or someone sitting at the other end of the table?. I told the waiter to bring me another order since he F up and he raised his voice at me and became rude saying It's not my fault and you have to pay for it again.

Be nice, it's my first review! \n\nA client recommended this place yesterday...as she was getting her hair shampooed...just raving about how good it was but I was still skeptical.  But as the day grew on, I realized that the name rang a bell  and I once read about how good this place was/is since I was craving GOOD sushi when I moved to CA...but come on?! Who doesn't say that it's the BEST sushi, sashimi, I've ever tasted? Blah blah blah etc...\n\nAnyway, I decided to try it and was fortunate to beat the rush but parking was a pain in the a**!  If you don't like waiting...too bad...this place gets packed!  So if you're lucky, they'll be seats at the bar...if not, the wait is DEFINITELY worth it!  \n\nBorn and raised in HI, I'm used to having FRESH and delicious sushi and sashimi.  After last night, I won't have to pay for another over priced plane ticket just cause I miss sushi and sashimi!  Sushi Bistro reminds me of home.  Their dishes are unique and a little alarming...Some of the sushi combos, ie: fish with apple relish, etc intrigued me but also worried me as I tried to envision the taste...I definitely felt over whelmed on what to eat.  So I played it safe and ordered one dish at a time.  \n\nLuckily, the wait help is super friendly and they didn't make me feel unwelcome for being so indecisive like some other restaurants do.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I started with a safe one...CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON.  As soon as it arrived, he inhaled 3...I was still getting my wasabi ready when I looked up and saw that he was almost through with the entire roll.  I had to actually tell him to slow down!  \n\nThe roll was so fresh that I swear, the shrimp and unagi was probably still alive when they were preparing it...not like the frozen shrimp or packaged eel...we definitely didn't waste any time order our next few rolls, SPICY CRUNCHY, RED DEVIL, and RAGIN' CAJUNS...and my comfort roll, the Philly. \n\nThe fishes were all so fresh that it didn't even taste like fish!  I'm sure you've encountered smelly old fish...that smell sort of ok, looks great but taste like fish oil!!!  NOT HERE!  Also, they know how to cut fish!  I didn't have any chewy pieces...I hate it when places buy good fish and f**k it up cause their sushi chefs don't know how to slice fish.\n\nGive it a try and just order away, cause I'm sure any rolls or sashimi from Sushi Bistro will blow your underwear off...if you're wearing any.\n\nBTW..it was 4 out of 5 stars cause I wish they gave more for the price...but it was still worth every penny.", "author": "sonja t."}

This restaurant looks like it belongs in either the Marina or in the trendy part of the mission district.  \n\nIf you are going to go all out and be different, then why not change the way you eat Japanese food.  I have been taught to eat sushi a certain way.  You take the sushi and place the whole piece in your mouth.  With these nigiris or sashimis...............it is very difficult to put the whole thing in your mouth unless you are a working girl.  j/k.  These pieces are ginormous.  Size really matter.....which really makes this place stand out.  If you are going to be paying this kinda money...........why not give the consumers a bigger slice.  I have been to restaurants where the slices are huge but the quality of the sushi is terrible.  I thought I would feel the same way about this place but I was absolutely wrong.  The servers were prompt, the water was always refilled, the pickles and gingers were always replaced, the wait was short, the food was great.........it really deserves a 5 star rating.  \n\nMy friend Dom recommended me this place and this is honestly the first time he has ever .........and I mean ever.....taken me to a restaurant that was fantastic.

You made me do it !!\n\n\"I'll be right with you\" was what she should've said instead of ignoring us for 5 minutes. Hello, I'm only standing right in front of you. \n\nThe miso soup didn't have enough taste. How do you mess that up? It's miso paste and hot water.  I make better miso soup from the box of paste I buy from the supermarkets.  My friend thought the same, but we didn't mind.\n\nNot sure how the food tasted because I basically swallowed my meal in 3 minutes.  Why? Because I wanted 30 minutes for my food, and they gave me my order 15 minutes after all three of my friends got theirs.  They were practically done eating by the time I got mine..  \"Sorry for the wait\" was what they should've said.  I'm not asking them to kiss my feet, but I just wanted them to acknowledge their mistake.  Then he handed me the plate. Oh, I mistakenly thought he was the waiter and thought his job was to put food on my table, not hand me the huge plate of food that I waited 15 minutes for while staring at my friends eat.  Oh and the girls next to me who came in 10 minutes after me had food on their table.  But but but.. I'm starving over here. They don't look that hungry. =(\n\n\"Your sushi?\" No sir, not ours.  He repeated the sushi name.  No, it's out ours.  He repeated the sushi name. No, I ordered the HAWAIIAN BREEZE. \"Ok.\" Then another guy walks out and asks me the same question..... But I just told the other guy three times that it wasn't mine...\n\nEh, I don't know.  I've never in my life waited 30 minutes for sushi or a dinner combination box before, and I've been to my fair share of sushi houses. \nFood wasn't that great.  Sushi wasn't that great. The hostess was nice, but I can't eat her.  I didn't mind being ignore for a bit when I came in.  I didn't find the tasteless miso soup. I didn't mind that my meal took so long to come. I didn't mind that my meal came 15 minutes after all my friends' orders came.  I didn't mind the guy handing me the huge plate of food instead of placing it on the table I didn't mind swallowing my meal in 5 minutes (though my tummy might've). I didn't mind them forgetting my sushi and insisting on giving me the wrong one.  I didn't mind it happened once more again after it just happened. BUT I did mind that they did not once apologize for any of this.  A simple sorry would've changed my frustration.  \"Sorry for the wait.\"\n\nWould I come back?

Server was incredibly attentive, dirty dishes were cleared IMMEDIATELY (I almost didn't notice that they were being taken away), and my water was refilled at least 3-4 times, which in my book is worthy of 5 stars for the OVERALL EXPERIENCE.

Not everything at SB was a disaster, but I have no idea why with at least 4 other sushi places within 2 blocks on balboa, this one manages to stay in business and was actually busy at 9 on a Thursday. The Other perplexing thing is how in the world this place boasts Michelin and yelp recommendations. Citysearch I get- they're clearly paying to be highly rated, but really yelpers- I expect better recommendations or was I just here on an off night? \nSo as other reviewers note, the prices are reasonable- for fresh and delicious sushi, which sadly this was not. We had four rolls and all of them tasted the same- like tuna fish - even the ones with no tuna. Seriously, I've had grocery store take out that was better quality. \nThey only had 2 brands of unfiltered sake, but the aladdin was good and came in a cute little pink bottle. \nMiso was bland. Complemetary cucumber salad was tasty. \nSashimi and nigiri were ok, we had scallops, naguro, hamachi, and one other recommended by one of the 5 or so servers that we waited for- oops I mean waited on us. The table was not bussed to clear old plates to make room for fresh ones and we waited 20 minutes to get our check and sign our tabs.

How shall I put it? Cutting-edge, trendy, Haute Couture sushi? Or as Rayfil W. puts it, \"neo-sushi\". I wasn't expecting this type of sushi after a few long days of being locked up in hotel conference rooms for a conference. I was looking for comfort sushi. \n\nThe names of the sushi are original, some movie titles like \"Finding Nemo\", \"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\" which came as a long roll aligned like fence posts on a white oblong platter. The inside shrimp was crispy and underneath the roll was a tasty sauce, all for $10.95. The Yellowtail Basil Roll required acclimation. At first bite, I thought I was eating a sushi roll braised in Chinese black bean sauce (where's the spareribs or \nclams?). You couldn't taste the basil but the garlic flavor was prevalent. \nAt a reasonable $7.95, I'm not sure I'd reorder. It had the same tasting sauce on the bottom as the Crouching Tiger roll with a swirl of chili sauce for kick. \nThe spider roll ($7.95) was good, nothing memorable. The salmon skin hand roll ($3.75) came with lots of salmon skin but hubby agreed with me that this was bland as well as the Hamachi nigiri ($8.50/4) The Hamachi was too cold and lacked flavor over the unseasoned rice. We liked the unagi nigiri ($3.95/2). I saw other diners with either warm or cold sake and beer but was happy with my green tea. Lots of \"reservation\" tagged tables and this was only at 6:30 PM. I had called earlier and the reservationist told me they were not accepting reservations but there was no wait for walk-ins. Staff was courteous and cleared our table as soon as we completed a dish. \n\nThere is a very small sushi bar in the rear of the restaurant and a long bar adjacent to the small dining tables which fit 4 comfortably but much more difficult for larger parties. If you're feeling adventurous and looking for unconventional sushi, I'd come here. I'd be willing to give it another try but might avoid the novelty dishes because of the incongruous taste.\nSometimes it doesn't pay to get the last word.     Word.", "author": "Ry T."}

I never had anything like them before, and they were all delicious. The Stinky Salmon was slightly too watery for me, but the garlic sauce and the onions on top made for an interesting flavor.  Loved the Watermelon Man, the amount of avocado on top was perfect. Hot Love was also amazing, but I wish that it came in roll form instead of two fat blobs....it was rather difficult to eat, even with the spoon they gave us. But nevertheless, it was mighty tasty.

We moved to the Inner Richmond almost 6 years ago and just tried this place after passing by (before they moved to their new location). We were unaware of the excellent ratings and amazing Sushi. Now we're regulars who are remembered and given stellar treatment every time we go. \n\nI find their fish to be so fresh with very generous portions. We always switch up what we order but a few of our staples are tuna poke salad, the spring lettuce wrap, the African spider roll, and the New Legend. I could describe them all and tell you how truly wonderful they are but I think you should really go and just try it. Their new location is much bigger and more comfortable for me. You can make reservation (even an hour or two before you go) so that you don't have to stand in the long lines on Friday or Saturday.\n\nI love a place that remembers me but I never expect them to remember my drink order. Sushi Bistro always remembers what we like to drink and immediately tells us of their specials that they know we prefer. I feel so welcome there. Granted, I felt welcome before we were regulars too...always friendly and fast service.\n\nI still go to other Sushi places when I'm in another neighborhood or state but nothing compares to Sushi Bistro!

The fish was not fresh and we were some of the first customers in the restaurant when it opened.I have gone to this restaurant about 5 times and it continues to disappoint and get progressively worse each time I have gone. The nigiri and rolls were just not that fresh and when I informed the bartender-Skip he just shrugged it off. This place is rated 4 stars because you do not see a sophisticated eater dining at this restaurant you see hipsters and their usual non distinguished taste for the mediocre. The food was so bad that we would never recommend this place to anyone or ever return here to dine ever again. The fish left a bad taste in our mouths and the food overall was rated a 1. The service was OK but they have a little bit of nonchalance about them and do not provide any special service. This is a restaurant that continually declines from a food perspective and is nothing special. \n\nIf you are a sushi person and have really had great Sushi in Japan, Hawaii and other cities in the US and abroad this place would be rated no more than a two for the freshness of the fish and overall no more than a 2 for the sushi overall. I have to imagine that any people rating this restaurant a 4 or a 5 have not had really good sushi and the mediocrity of this restaurant suits them fine. \n\nAnother issue is this restaurant is located in an area where the parking can be very difficult and I would not take a cab or public transportation to visit this restaurant. because it is really nothing special.", "author": "Ricky R."}

If it's packed, look next door to Namu as a healthy second choice. This has quickly become my favorite block in the Richmond.", "author": "Phil M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-30", "description": "Incredibly extensive menu of varied selections with clever names. \n\nThe menu's so long, it can be daunting at first, but I have a simple rule for these kinds of situations: Go with the dish with the longest description! Odds are, even if you knew how to make the dish in question yourself (and had the time and patience to do so), you wouldn't have all those ingredients on hand at the same time! Also, in this instance, go with your gut reaction. Otherwise, you'll spend a half-hour lost in the menu.\n\nThe three of us got there at 6:30 p.m., just before the tiny space filled up. Very fast service; they slammed out one sushi dish after another. We ordered four dishes in total. All great. An average of eight pieces per order. Total bill per person, with tip, $21.00. Highly reasonable. Highly recommended.\n\n(Some of the dishes were ordered were Billie Jean, Five Wishes and Yellowtail Basil.)\n\nGood, fast, affordable, quality place to go to before a show at the nearby Red Poppy Art House or Brava Theater.", "author": "Paula M."}

The host/hostess and waitresses were perfect - real friendly but not obnoxious. We told the waitress what we were in the mood for and she picked a perfect appetizer and three of the best rolls I've ever had. \n\nGreat clean atmosphere and very fairly priced. Only setback is that the two glasses of wine we had were sub-par. Avoid the Pinot and the Chardonnay. I actually ended up mixing my Pinot with a glass of ginger ale so I could drink it faster and move on to beer, which was delicious as always.", "author": "Nick W."}

About 15 YUPPIES sat in the place talking about how great it was... very weird.  \n\nWe ordered our food and was pretty excited about the menu.  I mean, it seemed fairly creative with their dishes and I'm always interested to try something new.  \n\nSo I ordered the Big Island roll and unagi nigiri.  The roll was the most expensive one at $13.50-ish so I was looking forward to being amazed.  What a disappointment.  It came with 2 or 3 types of fish and were tasteless and the crab was IMITATION!  Do NOT charge me $13.50 for f-ing imitation meat.  If I want imitation meat, I'll go to Safeway a few blocks away and pick up some tofurkey.  And the roll had no seaweed whatsoever!  Instead it was a huge log wrapped in cucumber.  WTF?!  So they expect me to shove that huge log slice into my petite mouth and chomp down on big chunks of cucumber to get to some tasteless sashimi and fake crabmeat?  No.  Then I figured, well, at least my unagi will be cool.  I mean, you can't mess up unagi nigiri.  I was wrong.  So wrong.  They gave me two pieces of very pretty unagi nigiri that was drowned in sauce.  It could have been styrofoam nigiri and would have tasted the same under all that sauce.  \n\nGood things about it: we had decent service and the decor is contemporary and clean.  Bad things about it: Everything else.  \n\nBefore we left, the place was crowded with Marina-types slumming it.  I'll never go back.", "author": "Imelda M."}

Having lived, studied, worked, and traveled throughout Japan, I know what is good and authentic Japanese food.  I have tried many Japanese restaurants in the Bay Area and have not yet found one that is as good as Sushi Bistro for the freshness and tastiness of its fish!  My husband likes to try the more \"creative and non-traditional\" dishes like African Spider for which the chef owner had won a prize in a competition about 2 years ago.

First of all, the last two times I've gone, we've found hair in the food.  It must happen a lot because when we told our server, they were like, \"Um, OK, whatever.\"  And last night (granted it was a Friday but it was only 7:30!) the service was scattered and chaotic.  It took a long time for them to take our order, then they kept bringing the wrong food to our table.  For example, the server came and dropped a roll on our table, me and my co-diners don't know what it is, we're asking eachother who ordered it, no one knows, we leave it there.  The server comes back to bring out one of our appetizers, we ask what the roll is, he tells us, and then he goes, \"oh, you didn't order that.\"  And he just takes it and puts it on the table that did order it!  My tea mug wasn't re-filled and I wasn't offered water.  My tofu salad was soggy and over-dressed.  The \"seared\" tuna in my lettuce wrap, which is usually one of my most favorite things in the world, was overcooked to the point of dryness and blandness.  What happened to this place?  It was a terrible dining experience.  \r\n\r\nAnd, as if that all weren't enough, they didn't give us our complimentary ice cream at the end of the meal.", "author": "Jackie D."}

We first tried the Sexy Scallop which was my personal favorite.  I liked that I could taste each component of the dish and everything went together really nicely.  Next, we had the Spicy Crunchy which was ok aside from the fact that the roll kept falling apart.

The menu is replete with rolls complete with three different fishes, four mystery ingredients, an obligatory trendy name that makes easily amused people get excited about the food they are about to eat. The issues with rolls is achieving a balance between interesting flavors while retaining their distinct flavors. The failure is when the rolls become a bloody and mushy mess. Rolls such as \"monster in-laws\" \"sexy scallop\" are examples of horrible fusion roll failure. If you blind taste tested these rolls you wouldn't be able to taste the difference as they all essentially tasted the same and had the same consistency. To add further insult the rolls were poorly made and fell apart, and I certainly doubt that the person making it had any connection with Japan. Some dishes were good however including the \"red devil\" and ahi tuna poke special, but these dishes were more the exception than the norm.

Seriously...when fish that is supposed to melt like butter is ribboned with sinuous fibers it really makes you want to say - screw you I'm not paying for this crap. Also I asked for them to please not put sauce on the rolls yet they made us a 5 wishes..dressed it..remembered just before handing it to us that we asked them not to..failed to take the sauce off of the pieces that were splattered with it and completely removed the salad that accompanies it. We asked if we could have the dish in it's entirety but with sauce on the side (so we could use it for the lettuce..cos salad needs dressing..not rolls..). Oh and the sauce they use on the albacore is atrocious - it's sweet and further destroys the already hideous albacore. *IF* I go back it will be for sake and crab mix..cos..I still love their stupid crab mix...blah\n\nWhat the crap, Bistro? From 4 to 2..not lookin good buddy..\n\n--------------------\n\nThis is a sushi bar I go to when I have a hankering for crab mix. The fish and rice itself is good but once you have gone to Sushi Zone it is certainly knocked down quite a few notches. Several of the rolls are over-dressed and I for one am not such a fan of cooked fish in my rolls (unless it's eel). This aside, the food arrives quickly, the cold sake selection is rather nice, and the sushi is very good for what it is (when you consider 93% of the selection is fusion stuffs). \n\nMy absolute favorites?\n\n49 roll (add crab mix on the inside)\n5 wishes\nDragon Roll\nOkunomatsu (black pine tree) Sake\n\n\nAlbacore dream would be great but the sauce kills it. And don't waste your time with the Omega 3 roll. Sexy scallop isn't anything to write home about either...\n\n\nOh and parking? The suck.\n\n4 stars for the things I enjoy", "author": "Natalie G."}

The prices may be more then many sushi restaurants in the area, but let me tell you, its DEFINITELY worth it. Oh and let me just say, the reggae music that plays in the sushi restaurant just adds to the charm and uniqueness of the place.\n\nService:\nGreat!  The place is small which means consequently the servers are always around.  This is one of the places ive been where for several visits i have not had to ask for a refill for my water.  The older woman who does the serving in this place is incredibly friendly, if your lucky enough to get her, then good for you! \n\nFood:\nOh the food....oh the food...words can't even describe the sushi at this place.  Since i've lived in the city ive tried several sushi places and this place definitely has by far the best fish.  I know that sushi places get their freshest fish on Thursday's in order to be prepared for the weekend rush, and we went Sunday and Monday 2 nights :-)  and wow the fish was still so incredibly fresh and tasty.  Plus, we ordered several kinds of nigiri and man the fish was bigger then the rice they give you! How rare is that?? Plus none of the fish had that yucky white farmed color, their fish was so beautifully colored and fresh tasting.  The real bonus of this place in my opinion is their selection of sushi.  They offer unique combinations of fish in their sushi with adequately unique names such as crouching tiger, c-2, and african spider.  Oh and there is this roll with lobster in it, and wow, i was surprised to find...it wasn't imitation lobster! It was real lobster! Definitely a treat.  Everything here is priced higher then im used to for sushi, but for the quality and serving size, it is definitely worth it.\n\nI would say the only drawback of this place is the limited seating.  Make sure you get here early or make reservations! You know a place is very good when its a hole in the wall in a random location and people are waiting outside in the cold! :-)  But the wait is definitely worth the food, so it is hardly a drawback.  \n\nSo if your looking for some delicious sushi with a nice atmosphere, this is the place to go!", "author": "Mark R."}

I honestly prefer to just read others reviews but I am beginning to feel like I need to add my two cents to the deal. \n\nI have eaten my way through a number of sushi restaurants in the city and I am sorry to see that the average rating for sushi bistro is 4 stars. I just don't see what people are so excited about. \n\nThe only good thing I can really say is that the service was fast and that was nice because I was hungry. \n\nThe food was just mediocre. In fact I found the portion sizes of the nigiri and sashimi to be kind of a turn off because they were so large. Good nigiri is all about good balance between the rice and the fish. The pieces of fish were like 3 pieces of fish at other better sushi places I've been to. I guess it was fresh? It wasn't fishy but if thats all the good I can say about it then I don't think thats a very good sign. \n\nThe server was nice enough to offer to take the unfinished sushi off my bill. I guess it was obvious I wasn't that pleased with it because I only ordered a couple things and still wasn't able to finish.\n\nI don't think I will be going back any time soon.

Seems really different from what I remember...much louder and crowded with tables.  \r\n\r\nIt was Grace M's sushi bday fest, and we were there to eat TORO! Toro toro toro....  \r\nOff their chalk-written specials we had an order of the toro and their tuna delight (a 'sandwich' of fried sushi rice, spicy tuna, grilled tuna, avo and other random things) and more nigiri: hamachi toro, fresh sake, shrimp and uni.  \r\nIt was supposed to be two orders of the toro nigiri but we were told they ran out.  It was already ridiculously large portion slices of fish laid over a thumb-nub size of rice; they criss-crossed another two triangles of flesh ontop of the pair, I guess to make up for being just a one-off.   But it was soooo fresh and delicious, I still shoveled the entire piece in and relished every one of the 3minutes it took for me to work around such a mouthful. \r\nThe tuna delight wasn't all that delightful - the sandwich quicky devolved into more of a sushi sloppy joe and the grilled tuna parts were overdone.  We also tried their Five Wishes special roll, pretty good; I could've wished for a lighter mayo-ish cream sauce, but Grace liked it the way it was.\r\nThe hamachi toro was also exceptionally good. \r\nPrices aren't bad, especially considering their portion size - you're almost getting 2 orders for 1.\r\nComing here before 7:00pm is apparently key if you're not doing reservations.  And once it gets crowded, you're gonna have to 'work it' for your tea refills and complimentary ice cream.  Overall, money well spent. Happy Bday, Chiggins.

They have a lot of cooked rolls, which aren't my fave, and not a ton of raw rolls, but the fish is fresh and the rolls tasty.  I especially liked the spicy tuna roll, which, although not nearly spicy enough, you could tell had really good quality tuna -- the flavor of the fish came through and wasn't masked by the spice.

We had reservations for our party of 4 for 6pm and thank god we did because the place started to get really packed around 6:30ish.\n\nWe ordered:\n~ Butterfish Blasters: delish!  The butterfish was super buttery.  My cousin described it as a California roll without the rice and seaweed and instead, wrapped in fish...which is exactly what it is.\n~ Hot Love: sort of like the first dish except it had baby lobsters and it was baked.  I liked that it was a little spicy and peppery but that the heat did not overwhelm the dish.\n~ C-2: it was yummy but not as spectacular as everyone else made it out to be.\n~ African Spider: like your regular spider roll with Cajun spices although I didn't taste much of it.  The soft shell crab was still good nonetheless.\n~ Waikiki: most unique roll with mango and macadamia nuts.  The mangoes they used were not ripe so it was hard and sour (tasted more like apples) but I loved the macadamia nuts.\n~ New Wave Mahi-Mahi: you can't really taste the mahi-mahi but I loved the mango salsa in it\n~ Monster-in-Laws: the albacore and yellowtail were really fresh but not that special\n~ Stinky Salmon: the onions actually over-powered everything else but I thought the asparagus added a nice crunch to it\n\nWe also had two large and one small Asahi's, a house sake, another cold sake and a glass of plum wine and our bill came out to $150 including tip.  Yes...four small Asian girls managed to finish all that food and drinks.  It was crazy but we couldn't help ourselves.\n\nI enjoyed everything especially the Butterfish Blasters and Hot Love.  Everything was really unique and I loved that they only use a thin layer of rice for their rolls.  One complaint is that although their menu is huge, a lot of the ingredients repeated in their rolls, i.e. Hawaiian Breeze and Waikiki sounded really similar so it's hard to differentiate between rolls.\n\nAnyway, we kept ordering more food as we devoured the dishes that came but the servers were really nice each time and didn't seem to mind at all even though the place was packed.

Although the portions are not that big, they are not cheapos who give you itsy bitsy dice sizes of raw fish (at least not in the tekka maki). The fried yellowtail with eel sauce was delicious. The poke appetizer was great! Their udon is not the regular udon you normally eat where it's all floury. This one has a springy feeling when you chew on it (kind of like some of the wonton noodles). \n\n4 stars b/c one of the appetizers (hot lovin') was only alright. Also, my friends who had the bento boxes said it was only okay (regular bento boxes where you can get anywhere).\n\nI highly recommend ordering sushi with raw fish and udon!\n\nSmall and cozy place, and fills up fast so make sure you make reservations!", "author": "M L."}

Over three years in this neighborhood, and I never went here till tonight!  What's wrong with me?  At first was a little on guard against the hipster feel and higher prices than I'm used to.  But the service was extremely friendly, the jazz they were piping in made for an animated though not overbearingly-so backdrop, the cozy little place was buzzing, and the food was just delightful.  Five rolls was enough to satisfy two, and the total bill of $45 + tip was definitely worth it as these were gourmet rolls.  We got the Napoli, Spicy Crunchy, Five Wishes, Ragin' Cajun, and Waikiki, all beautifully presented and a panoply of flavors, like mango in an eel roll or macadamia nuts atop lightly fried tuna.

Food, drinks, atmosphere, service - all excellent. Reading other reviews, I'm wondering why we had so much of a better experience?! Maybe because we got there for late dinner (around 8.30pm)? Or maybe they have changed their attitude. ;-) The bartender is a bit grumpy but the cheery waitress/waiters make up for it. The food is delicious! Heaps of extravagant choices - quite creative roll creations - at decent prices for that kind of sushi. About $60 for 2 person for dinner including alcoholic beverages. You'll have to try 'Hot Love'. Baby lobster, crab meat and avocado wrapped in snapper. Hm, yeah, exactly. Can't wait to come back and continue to work our way through the rest of the menu.", "author": "Kristina T."}

I have had sushi all over the place but nothing compares to Sushi Bistro on Balboa St. in the Inner Richmond in San Francisco. We have been going here for several years and I still think they make the best sushi. The prices are reasonable, the fish is always fresh, the portions are very generous (they give you a lot of fish without adding too much rice on the rolls), and the menu is very creative. My favorites include the Ahi Tuna Poke Special (cubes of fresh ahi tuna marinated in spicy sauce, served with organic baby greens), Billie Jean roll (baby lobster, avocado, cucumber wrapped with soy paper and aioli and topped with salmon, Mont Blanc roll (shrimp tempura, avocado and cucumber, topped with butterfish and ginger soy sauce), Baby Lobster roll, Volcano (baked salmon with spicy aioli, crabmeat and avocado) and the Butterfish sashimi.

I guess I am more of a traditional sushi nigiri with no wierd messy cream sauce sushi type of gal. Yeah occasionally I like to try the special rolls here and there but this place was a miss for me.\nThis is probably the first time that I've been to ANY japanese restaurant where the miso soup tasted like it was watered down. It had no miso flavor at all but it was hot, like someone poured a whole jug of hot water into their soup pot then it was dished out. \n\nHad the agedashi tofu-this was pretty good, but nothing special or worth coming back for. The 4 chunks of fried tofu were huge.\n\nI had the black weed roll, and it sounded good: seared ahi tuna with cucumber, sesame seed and oil, topped with seaweed salad and chunky spicy albacore. This roll was $10.50 and it came cut into 6 thin pieces (about 1 and 1/2 inch thick). The seared ahi inside the roll was not seared at all nor fresh, it was the equivalent of getting chopped tuna out of a can. It was dry and small, and looked like had been cooked at the beginning of the day and stored a plastic tubbie until I ordered my roll. I had imagined a succulent piece of seared ahi tuna (like the ones you see at the store, slightly charred on top). this was literally cooked all the way and resembled cat food. YUCK. The albacore on top was nothing to die for, and couldn't even really taste anything in the roll except the seaweed salad. A sad disappointment for a expensive roll. I looked around me and the other rolls at all the other tables were exactly the same. Funky rolls with sauce drenched all over the top.\n\nMy BF had the s-2 special, 10 piece nigiri with tuna, hamachi, ebi, tobiko, butterfish, unagi, the cuts of fish were pretty good, but not the best we've had. I love butterfish and this came through not even close to what I had at Kiji. It was not as buttery and melt in your mouth like it should be. It came with the same bland and watered down miso soup and a ok usual salad at any old japanese place. My BF said the rest of his nigiri was OK.\n\nThe place was packed-full house and the noise level is so loud here I couldnt hear myself think. The decor is cool inside, and this is definetely a place to go to have drinks and OK sushi. Like I said, this is a place for crazy rolls with crazy names and over the top sauces that masks the true flavor of the fish. I would equate this place to the same level as places in the richmond like kitaro, or sakana bune, where you could get the same rolls for 1/2 the price less the cool atmosphere, bar, and misc other trendy dishes like hamachi carpaccio. Yes they have some special items on their menu that makes it perhaps more facinating for most but not for me. It was like everyone around me eating their gaijin sushi were in sushi heaven and I was like WTF it ain't that good!? \n\n Also, one last thing I CANNOT stand is how the sushi chefs were not Japanese. Ok not all of them can be, but hey if you look at the kitchen and see one mexican, and the rest some form of asian other than japanese making your sushi, what can you really expect?\nwell it explains why each of the rolls that came out, to our table and to the next were all DIFFERENT IN SIZE! \n$45 out the door, no alcohol. Price isnt a factor when eating good food, but this wasnt worth it at all. Service was decent, and everything was prompt.\n\nOnce is enough, never again.", "author": "Petri Y."}

I've been going there since it was an unknown hidden gem.  And after all the advertisement and after people started noticing and writing reviews, it started getting busier and busier.  It was now the HOT SPOT!  It was especially busy at nights and on the weekends.  \n\nParking is difficult which is pretty typical in the city.  You may have to walk some amount of blocks, but once you see the spot (might I add that I love the SB emblem of the butterfly), then you'll know the walk was well worth it!  It is a small and intimate setting that makes a nice date spot/ lounge spot w/ friends.  I'm thinking that the maximum occupancy is about 35-40 people.  The lighting is fairly dim but it has a nice ambience feel to it.  The owners of the restaurant are very welcoming and personable.  They were a Japanese couple (I have to add this b/c you'll find a lot of Japanese restaurants in the city are filled with Spanish sushi makers, servers etc).  But you really feel the warmth of the Japanese culture with a twist of moderness.  The wife always remembered mine and my ex's names and what our favorite dishes were.  We would go here at least 2 times a week - it's out of our way too, but that's how much we loved this place!  She also always gave us free edamame, soup, and green tea ice cream.\n\nThe food was fantastic - It reminded me of a Japanese/ Hawaiian fusion -similiar to Roy's Fusion, but better and affordable.  It had a great selection of creative and unique dishes and rolls.   They always came out so beautiful and pleasing to the eyes.  I loved the colors of every dish.   They also serve generous portions.  The food itself were all very tasteful, flavorful, fresh, and filling.  You'll find that you'll come out there very satisfied yet it's all so healthy.  \n\nMy usual order was Seaweed Salad and the \"Big Island Roll\"... this is my ultimate favorite roll!  I don't really eat white rice (I prefer brown rice)... but this roll had everything in it without the rice.  It was wrapped in cucumber and it was soooooooooooo goood.  mmMMMm I'm craving it right now... but I just noticed their site and they're now serving Brown Rice Rolls (they didn't have this a few years ago)!!! I have to move back for these!!!  Also, they also have an option to use Soy Paper instead of Seaweed... it's very good too - it melts in your mouth.  My ex would always get a Combination Dinner - usually Teriyaki Chicken or Beef Teriyaki and that was good too.... They give a lot of meat, salad, rice... they definitely fill you up.  It was also prepared very beautifully.\n\nAll the items on their menu looked good and I was hoping to try every one of their items!  \n\nBut yes - I LOVE SB... everytime someone asks for recommendations of Japanese restaurants in the city, this is the place that I highly recommend... it is to die for ... I mean to live for! \n\n(Oh - one con that I have of this place is that they had this tiny aquarium on the wall - it was a half of a bubble and it had a Beta in it .... we would notice that it wasn't getting cleaned regularly - everytime we went there, we were feeling sorry for that fish haha ...that's all!)", "author": "L A."}

The nigiri did not have balance; not enough rice to complement the size of fish slice. Tempura had good flavor, but had a dense batter coating; not airy light tempura.  Would not recommend this restaurant if food quality is important to you. Okay if you can accept average food, but are looking for a good atmosphere to spend with friends.", "author": "G L."}

We have our own bottle of cock sauce; you can borrow it, but don't lick the cap.  Debbie treats me right, knows me by name and always finds me a table.  I feel like Norm here.  I hate to share, but they deserve the business.  Unfortunately the secret is already out and thursday-sunday you might find yourself waiting on the sidewalk for a bit.  This place is SMALL and hard for big parties, but if you call ahead, Debbie will reserve a table for ya.  Try the lettuce wraps, summer is my favorite.  Their rolls are innovative to say the least.  I eat here almost once a week and still struggle with ordering because everything is SO good and unique!!   \nFavorite apps: Agadashi Tofu & Ahi tuna poke special\nFavorite rolls: watermelon man, nemo found & the in-laws\nYou really can't go wrong!\nYou also get a happy ending with every meal!

Of course you have all your usual sushi choices to choose from in J-town and all throughout SF however I have to say Sushi Bistro is by far my favorite.  Their custom rolls that they have are very untraditional with many rolls to choose from their menu being served hot which was new to me and it was great.  Their summer lettuce roll which consists of eel is a must have as an appetizer.  Along with the many rolls we ordered I also ordered some tong katsu and shrimp tumpura  which was very good.  Also nice to have Kirin on tap as well as the very friendly service.  It's a small cozy place, good place to bring a date.", "author": "David C."}

You might need a reservation if you want to sit at a table. Parking wasn't easy to find but then again it's SF. It's to be expected. We tried a variety of rolls to include: Hot Love, Rock n' Roll, and Spider. The Hot Love is good (takes 20 min to make) but won't fill you up as you only receive 2 pieces. The other rolls we got are the standard set of 6. They have some unique sushi here and I would recommend getting the Rock n' Roll. I felt sick after dining here but I don't think it was from food poisoning. My wife was fine and it was probably the combination of spicy rolls and fried crab that upset my stomach.

Its crab and avocado rolled up in butterfish, and lightly torched on the outside. Damn I just salivated while writing that. Anyways, the fish stays mostly raw, and this is an EXCELLENT dish. The butterfly is very flavorful, and the crab meat inside is well seasoned. I'd say a must get.\n\nAfrican Spider Roll:\nGot this on yelp recommendations. It was definitely good, but can't say it was that much above a spider roll elsewhere. I do have to say, that I normally find spider rolls overstuffed with sprouts, and the end pieces aren't as pleasant to eat; however, this roll did not have that problem, and they also left the large pieces of crab out of the roll, to eat on the side. \n\nYellowtail and Tuna sashimi:\nWOW. Very. Large. Pieces. I'd say 2.5 times the size of any piece of sashimi you normally get for the same price. Fish was fresh, but had some stringy tendons in it. \n\nOverall excellent sushi. I'd want to try some of their more special rolls next time.", "author": "Jeffrey T."}

As I got more acquainted with the place, I realized that it was all intentional after I saw the menu (no entrees) and no sushi bar. We ordered a few rolls and I definitely would recommend \"The New Legend Roll.\" They definitely had a unique line of specialty rolls and it seemed as though it was fused with a Japanese and Western culture.\n\nAs for the cons, I would absolutely advise them to lower down the music a tad bit. I completely understand it's a so called \"chill\" place to hang out for drinks and snacks, but it wouldn't be chill if a person practically had to yell to get his/her message across.

I usually lean more toward the traditional when it comes to Sushi, but decided to try it out.  We got there just in time at 7pm.  The place was packed by 8pm.  The music did take a little getting used to, and we did have to raise our voices by an octave to hear each other, but the fish was very fresh, and had the buttery rich taste and texture we seek.  We ordered waaaay too much!  Beginning with the Soft Shell crab appetizer and the Butterfish salad.  The crab is served with a Ponzu sauce and was very good.  The Butterfish salad comes dressed in a light citrus dressing, and is sprinkled with mango, corn and some other vegetables.  We shared the salad that had a really tasty dressing (don't bother asking, we tried....there is taste that we know, but were unable to identify.  The miso soup is NOT salty and has a nice rich broth.  Yes, we are beginning to get full, and the 12pc Sashimi plate hasn't even come out yet. We decided to go with the 'Watermelon Man' & 'First Crunch' rolls.  Both had very distinct tastes that were balanced with the fish perfectly, complimenting, without over-whelming.  I love some of the names of the rolls, and more importantly the novel combinations of ingredients.\nJust when we thought we couldn't possibly eat another thing, we're asked if we want green tea ice cream.  We ate it like the gluttons we are, and found it to be refreshing.  We would come back and sit at a table, as it looks a little more comfortable.", "author": "Arlene C."}

Everything we had was really good. \n\nWe started out with the Hamachi Kama, and were both pleasently surprised. It was so flaky and delicious, I couldn't wait to get our main courses. I got the Ahi Tower, because the few times that I've eaten sushi, it really hasn't been my thing, its not the fish, its the nori's texture that throws me off...anyways, my boyfriend got the Aloha 101, and I snuck some of that. After our first bites, we were pretty much fighting each other to get more of both of them because they were both awesome. \n\nI definately would recommend going here, and plan on going back. My only complaint was that they aren't great on filling up water, and it was HOT yesterday! But thats a small thing, and I think i'm the only one who pays attention to that, so it's pretty forgiveable.  \n\nIt was definately busy for a Monday night, which was kind of nice, as my \"weekend\" is Sunday and Monday and it's sometimes nice to go busy places because then it really feels like a weekend.

I asked a few friends at work if they had any recommendations and three of them said, \"Sushi Bistro.\" I made a reservation for 9pm on a Friday and was very pleased. The area is residential with lots of street parking. We showed up about 30 minutes early and they seated us about 15 minutes later. We ordered a few things off the menu to sample as much as we could: the winter lettuce wrap, tuna sashimi, M&L sushi (I think that was the name),  and a spicy crunch roll. Everything tasted great, especially the winter lettuce wrap. All of the food plus two glasses of wine came to $50 and we were surprised the bill was so low.

It sort of told me they didn't take themselves too seriously. Also, I'm used the stoic sort of angry faced Sushi chef who as far as I know has never had or cared to have a friend. For one, there were two chefs and they were laughing, talking and generally quite jovial while still keeping their eye on the food. Fun to see Sushi made!\n    As far as food, I went American,and ordered California rolls. Go ahead, mock me. They're delicious. We could get hand rolls or chopped sushi.

Also the fish did not taste all that fresh and was not properly sliced so that it was tough and hard to chew. Also, I was excited that they had a lot of different rolls you don't normally see on a menu the ones we got (California for the hubby, Baby Lobster and one other that I can't remember) were again, not good, totally unbalanced and not fresh. Their California and Baby Lobster rolls had way too much sauce and creaminess and therefore took away any of the fresh, sweet flavor of the crab and lobster.

I feel like they often use too much rice and try to cater to the newbie sushi crowd as most of the rolls are packed with non-traditional rolls. I feel strongly that if a place tries to pack their sushi rolls with lots of cream cheese,  cheese or deep fried batter, they are covering up something. We ordered the rock & roll and were expecting the usual: BBQ eel with cucumbers. What we received didn't replicate the texture, the look or the taste of what a Rock and Roll would be. Instead, it had some cheesy, mayonaisse topping on top and I nearly wanted to throw up. It's one of those rolls you can only eat one piece of. I've ordered the Crouching tiger, hidden dragon roll which was good, but not impressive. I've also ordered a few other things like the tofu kara-age, gyoza & tempura and they were all pretty mediocre to me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-24", "description": "We ordered the Chef's Choice sashimi platter, $35/20 pcs.  Seven types of fish were served.  The butterfish absolutely melted in your mouth.  The sake (salmon), tuna (maguro), seared albacore, regular albacore,  hamachi (yellow tail), and toro (fatty tuna) were very, very fresh, and each piece was 1\"x3\"x1/4\" - in other words, huge. If purchased separately, it would have been $42+.  The service was efficient, but we were there fairly early in the evening when there weren't many patrons.  \n\nIt's a small, neighborhood restaurant with minimal decor.  But, if what you are after is fresh, excellent sushi or sashimi at a very good price, go to Sushi Bistro.\n\nAlso, to be fair, there were many, more exotic choices, and we will probably return to try many of them.", "author": "Francesca A."}

However, the flavors don't always meld and the proportions of ingredients varied considerably - many of my rolls were way heavy on avocado.  The prices are reasonable and the service is friendly and prompt.  I did feel a little rushed at points - the timing of roll preparation was a bit faster than my preferred eating speed, but then it took a little while before we got the check and got paid.\n\nOverall, it was a good dining experience.

We arrived around 9 when our other dinner plans fell through; the place was busy but we took a seat at the bar. They had Kirin on tap which was the first indicator that this place was going to be awesome. The vegetarian selection was well thought out and expansive. We ordered the veggie gyoza, the asparacado roll, the classic veggie roll, the shiitake mushroom roll and the crispy veggie rolls. The classic veggie roll was like a salad in a sushi roll, it was amazingly fresh and crunchy from the romaine lettuce and the salad dressing perfected it. Sushi Bistro definitely loves to use sauces to make their rolls pop; they were the highlight of the rolls. The only negative I can see for their sushi is that some pieces would fall apart, perhaps they were in a rush? My favorite roll was the crunchy veggie, something about a crunchy texture on sushi is extremely appetizing. This place is awesome and now my favorite sushi.", "author": "Cori W."}

She sings softly in a large group and doesn't talk to anyone. However, when asked to do a solo performance, this beaming, gigantic voice comes out, streaming beautiful melodies.  Making the class respond with standing ovations.\n\nWhen my friend first took me here I thought, \"Where are we going on Balboa?!\"  I was amused by their icon of \"S\" and \"B shaped to look like a butterfly.  When we first walked in I wasn't impressed because it was super crowded (which is why I didn't give them the 5 star rating).  But we waited only 15 minutes and was seated at the sushi bar.  The sushi chef  (in fact the same one I see everytime I go now - been here 6 times), is amazing!  He took our order and within minutes we already received our fresh oh-so-delicious albacore sashimi.  He even gave us an extra slice on the house.  \n\nSushi Bistro offers an assortment of rolls, the freshest sashimi I've ever had, delectable dinner entrees, and specialty fushion small plates. The prices are reasonable considering the kind of quality sushi you get.  I want to highlight their rolls and sashimi in this review since that's what makes them so memorable.\n\nTHE ROLLS:\nReading their list eclectic selection of rolls will make your mouth water. From the Aloha Roll (seared ahi, mango, no rice, flash fried & served with spicy garlic sauce) to the 5 Wishes (five different types of sashimi with avocado served over crabmeat with spicy sauce), these delicious creations will make you sing.  The Albacore Dream and Watermelon Man are must-have's!\n\nTHE SASHIMI: \nThe sashimi will make you swoon.  I'm a picky sashimi eater.  I purposely sit by or at the sushi bar just so I could see the chef cut the slices.  And also, how its handle and stored.  The sashimi is not only super fresh, but given in large portions. My 2 pieces end up being 4 pieces.  One time I went with 3 of my girlfriends and in unison we all said \"Mmmmmmmmmm....\" out loud after taking a bite of the Yellowtail piece.  The people sitting next to us turned around, giggled, and ordered the same thing.\n\nThis place has consistently been a crowd pleaser.  Everytime I take a new person here they love it.  Special note to Vegetarians - they have a good selection of veggie-type rolls.  Not just your usual cucumber or avocado ones!  The music is cool too. They play reggae which gives it a chill, island vibe. \n\nP.S. You get free ice-cream for dessert!", "author": "Trish M."}

That said, my relationships with each restaurant can be likened to various romances in my life.\n\n1. Ozumo, Chaya: Upside: handsome immaculate presentation, someone your mother would brag to her friends about, 5 stars--easy Downside: Blackberry addiction, lacking that spark and sense of humor\n2. Ebisu:  Upside: Long history, friends with all your friends Downside: You went away for college while he stayed at home, you grew apart but attempted to drag out the relationship before you finally split up citing irreconcilable differences.  But remained friends.\n3. Okazu Ya (various locations), Noriega Teriyaki House: Upside: consistently economical and steady, kind of like the family minivan if it were made out of that mayo-surimi filler that they call \"crab salad\" Downside: Booorrriiing\n4. SushiZone, No Name:  Upside: Fun, cheap, spontaneous (which can be good or bad), a quick fix to make you laugh Downside: too much of a mess to ever consider long term--despite efforts to change him, it'll never happen, he'll always sleep on that dirty futon\n\nSo Sushi Bistro: Upside: Exciting, interesting, thoughtful, fresh, and super cute\nDownside: I'm so inclined to eat there every week, but I don't want to act too available because I may tire too quickly and ruin my chances in the long run\n\nSushi Bistro is so money!

A plus in my book, especially for those who are looking for healthier alternatives. I love some of the creative names they came up with for their sushi like Hot Love, Caucasian Afro, or Sexy Scallop. Haha! My favorites would have to be the Butterfish Blasters, Albacore Dream, and African Spider. The Butterfish Blasters, like it's name is so rich and melts in your mouth like butter. I never even knew what Butterfish was but it's delish! Albacore Dream was really fresh and came with multiple tunas in it. African Spider was good, anything fried is a winner. The soft shell crab was crispy and not oily or greasy. I also tried the Hot Love because everyone Yelped about it but I'm not a huge fan of it. It was thick and therefore got tiring. Also tried the Black Weeds and Hirame Fusion which I didn't care too much for. It was kind of bland and lacking some sort of sauce. I'll be nice and round up to 4 stars since Yelp doesn't do half stars, but they lose some stars in their service. Even with reservations, I felt like I waited the same time as some of those without reservations. Being San Francisco, the place was packed and cramped. Waitresses were friendly but slow. It felt like forever just for them to get us our tableware and water. Since it's always so crowded, I'll be understanding, I'll give them another chance to make up for service since their food is good. However, they'll lose more stars next time if this poor service keeps up. They have to make it worth my while to drive all the way up there from San Jose.", "author": "Karen L."}

The first time I ate here was about 8 months ago. I ordered a roll w/lobster (the name escapes me) and was totally dismayed when I discovered that they put mayo in it, especially since the menu did not mention mayo. I am not a mayo fan or a fan of mayo's \"fancier\" cousin, aoli so needless to say I was disappointed. Fast forward to last night. We ordered a spider roll, dragon roll, a side of unagi, and some sesame chicken. The spider roll was decent, the unagi was good, but unfortunately the dragon roll had aoli in it! I've eaten many a dragon roll in my day and I have never had one slathered in mayo! As for the chicken, we ordered this after we consumed our sushi. My friend also ordered an additional item following the consumption of her initial order. Her 2nd order was on our table within 5 minutes, however, the chicken I ordered took an additional 20 minutes! Now I'm a patient person and understand that the waiter may have forgotten to submit the order, but what really pissed me off was how NUMEROUS employees kept coming over and asking if we were ready for the check in spite of the fact that we told each person that we were still waiting for a dish! I understand that this place gets busy and they probably needed the table for their mayo lovin' clientele, but come on! I will never eat here again and I'm trying to wrap my mind around why people love this place so much. Next time I'm in the mood for sushi, I'll be dining at Kabuto on Geary!", "author": "j t."}

First time at Sushi Bistro even though I've lived in the hood for a while. I don't know what the hell I was waiting for. I love Sushi Bistro! Good thing its a good few blocks away coz I'd seriously be in tremendous debt if i lived across the street from them. I'd eat here every night and make friends with everyone who works there! I love that they play reggae as well. That was a big plus for my bf. He was more inclined to going out for sushi when he found that out. For people who do not like raw fish, they have a good selection of deep fried goodies to choose from. Personally i go for the raw stuff, and sushi Bistro was definitely fresh, fresh, fresh. They also give big honking pieces of nigiri and sashimi. I almost kissed the sushi chef. The more fish the better. My favorite was the halibut sashimi. We got a few orders of that. Yellow tail and salmon nigiri, which was also really good. The rolls, well they have a lot to choose from and I will definitely try all of them one day. We got the black weeds, watermelon man, something with basil, african spider, and the 7 flavor albacore salad. Everything was very tasty and had its own individual flavors. Every roll was very different and has a funky twist. Definitely not a purist sushi place. Its fun and imaginative sushi. We had a pitcher of Kirin with our meal as well and it came out to about $95 w/o tip. Its a little steep for everyday dinner, but worth every penny. Like i said, going into debt is in my future if I continue this sushi bistro habit.", "author": "Maria B."}

I mean, the music's pretty loud and somewhat annoying but the service is pretty good and rather efficient and not to mention one of the few sushi spots in San Francisco that actually allows you to make a reservation for six. For some reason, other sushi joints max out at five for reservations and no more is accepted. Hmph! Fortunately Sushi Bistro saved the day and my group had a lot of fun. Their sashimi is ridiculously fresh and I give tons of applause for that. It's harder than people think to find seriously fresh sashimi. I thought their chirayashi bowl was spectacular and very well-priced too. Big nice slabs of sashimi tastefully arranged around a bowl of great rice. There is more sashimi than there is rice (which is the way it's supposed to be). I got their \"Hot Love\" signature dish and it was just an orchestra in your mouth. It's so good with baby lobster and shrimp and avocado and more. I wouldn't go to this place frequently but would absolutely book here again if I'm going with a large group.", "author": "Pamela L."}

The menu was a great creative variety.  Their Unagi Nigiri is one of the best that I have ever had (Bond Street Sushi in Manhattan comes 1st).  Their server staff left something to be desired. I'm a food server veteran and figuring out who was ours was a big old guessing game.  And the sad thing was that neither of the two servers who were supposedly \"waiting\" on us - barely did.  The most helpful to us was the food runner, an Asian guy who remained attentive the whole dining experience.  The girl server who greeted us, took our order and ignored us the whole time even though she had forgotten to place one of our entrees.  The other supposed server was 89% caring about us, but then gave up as soon as a better 4-top was seated in his section. Understandably, but still no excuse.

The fish was very very fresh, and somehow the salmon was fresh enough to be completely lacking in fishy flavor, which is something that I have never experienced : ). The fried calamari was amazing. It was not those little circles, but big finger sized fried pieces that were no where near rubbery. We sampled the 12 piece sashimi to decide what was fresh and what we were feelin' that day, and decided that the butterfish and hamachi were working the best for us. We searched over the menu for something with both, found nothing, and asked if they could make a roll with the two fish wrapped in cucumber. They did and it was no problem, so we added 5% to her tip.

Maybe we shouldn't have started with the pesto sushi.  It sounded interesting, but the pesto didn't taste like it should have.  Maybe it was rotten or something.

We had a spicy tuna roll and an unagi roll.  Both were bad.  The unagi was drowned in that brown sauce that is usually used as just an accent at better sushi restaurants.  My fiancee also detected something hard in her roll and she nearly vomitted.  If that's not bad enough, all the rolls we ordered were not uniformally cut, and they were rolled loosely.

The reason I think its so good is because of the mix of the textures and taste.  You have sweetness from mango, crispness from fuji apple, crunch from fried macadamian nuts, pesto and of course really fresh fish.  I also tried their fried oysters which were not fishy at all, and no sand.  The specials of sashimi or nigiri you see on the board are very big portions.
