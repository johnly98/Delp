This isn't the best place for Japanese food, but it's not the worst either. \n\nPros: Huge selection of food - sushi rolls, bento boxes, ramen, udon, and curry. They have lunch specials everyday from 11am-4pm, and the prices are reasonable for the portion. They also offer parking validation ($2 off) for Japan Center Garage.  \n\nI ordered the katsu curry, and the amount of rice and curry was more than I expected. I could barely finish half of the bowl, so I would recommend sharing unless you're feeling very hungry. The curry was flavorful and not spicy at all, and the pork cutlet was average. The rest of my group ordered the bento box and sushi rolls and said they were pretty good, but the portions in the bento box were a bit smaller compared to other places I've been to. \n\nCons: Restaurant is small with few tables. There was a bit of a wait even though there was only one party ahead of us. The prices shown on the menu board outside were also not updated I think. The menu board listed the katsu curry as $12.95, but the menu they gave at the table listed it as $13.95. $1 difference isn't a huge issue, but it was a bit misleading.", "author": "Christine V."}

I mentioned this to one of the servers and she said they were not supposed to be soggy and that she'd take care of it.\nWhen she returned, she reassured me that the crumbles were made today. Additionally, she had sprinkled even more crumbles over the roll for me. Thanks... ?\nOn my second attempt to eat this roll, I encountered a large oily clump of crumbles, bleckh!!! The roll itself was ok, so I put in some elbow grease, and dusted off the crumbles from each piece. My dinner buddy suggested I use the pickled ginger pieces to wipe off the soggy bits, like a car wash, bahahaha!!!\n\nWe also ordered a Screaming Orgasm roll. The shrimp tempura in the center of the roll was, yet again, SOGGY.\n\nThe Hamchi Lover roll was good. Their sushi rice was acceptable. Boat loads of soggy tempura is NOT acceptable!

It was either this or the full place next door with a shocking 2 star average rating. Kushi Tsuru it is! Rock those 3 stars proudly, Kushi. It was difficult to find a place with both ramen and usual rice/sashimi dishes to please everyone. 8pm on Saturday and a family of 4 waited ahead of us, not too long before we sat. No point in writing my name on the list because they called me after we were already seated. I noticed they still accept customers with only 20 min left to spare. It appears they don't kick anyone out, very nice. \n\nOur waitress was efficient and super busy taking care of all the tables in our area. She did a quick check if everything was a-ok once food arrived. My fam and I ordered 2 item dinner Bentos, pricier than the usual Japanese establishment, but it's SF. Decent quality. I got chicken teriyaki and gyoza, comes with soup, salad, rice, and 2 CA roll pieces. Good kind of imitation crab meat mixed with mayo, none of that merely sliced fake crab stuffed into a roll. Miso soup was salty, probably from the bottom of the warmer at the end of the night. Spider-Man 1 roll was basic with 5 pieces and crisp soft shell crab. Satisfies the craving. Sashimi quality is ok. My sister's tonkatsu ramen was good! Broth wasn't too salty. Noodles were softer.\n\nRestroom situation is funny. When you gotta go and the two individual rooms are empty, no one notices nor cares about the men or women sign on the door. When in SF ... just to be clear, the first door says men, second one women. \n\nSolid spot for no frills Japanese food. Check out the udon or ramen places for soup. Next time I want to try out Izakaya KOU across the street near Boba Guys for skewers and a more urban experience, but gotta make a reservation.", "author": "Kristine F."}

I didn't like the tempura batter, the BBQ short rib was good but hard to eat with just my chopsticks and large pieces of it - a bit chewy, and the Saba was good. The salad was extremely disappointing.

Gave a really generous amount \n- Salmon Teriyaki: bento portion seemed pretty small and thin and had too much sauce \n- Beef Teriyaki: small portion, taste was sub par\n- Sashimi: Gave only 4 slices in the bento box. Definitely had way better sashimi out there\n- Lobster roll: proabably my favorite dish ordered. There were 8 pieces and fried lobster covered in sweet sauce on top! \n\nOverall, I would give the food 2 stars, but because the staff was friendly and service was fast I bumped my rating to 3 stars. Probably wouldn't come here again though.", "author": "Kelly H."}

My Ten Don!! So excited because I have been craving my tempura veggies!!! And it was...drum roll please....YUCK!!! Well to be honest, the rice was good. The tempura batter was so heavy and slightly sweet...as if they used PANCAKE BATTER??? WHAT?? Gordon Ramsey!! Where are you when I need you to ask them what kind of sh*t is this??

I decided to buy my then boyfriend's Christmas 2015 present on *drumroll please* Christmas Eve!  Before you start shaking your head, you should know that I waited that long because I wanted to get him something very particular, a bonsai tree, which you can't just get through Amazon.  (Actually, you can... but... ignore that for dramatic effect)  After searching up purveyors of bonsai, I was stuck between Katsura Garden, SF and Grove Way Bonsai Nursery, Hayward.\n\nRealizing that I still needed to buy gifts for a number of other people, too, I decided to stop by Katsura Garden and then buy a bunch of other things in Japantown (yay, efficiency!).  It was a cold, windy December 24th when I parked in the garage and commenced browsing and buying, swiping plastic like the credit card ninja that I am, crossing names off my list faster than the nonexistent Santa Claus (HE DOESN'T EXIST; YOUR PARENTS ARE LYING TO YOU).  Ahem.\n\nI finished a couple of hours later and was absolutely exhausted.  In retrospect, I shouldn't have purchased the bonsai first; that thing was heavy and hard to tote around from shop to shop.  As I passed through the mall, I decided to stop and eat before I drove home.  Hunger really must have messed with my mind and short-circuited my ability to think rationally (I have demonstrated sanity at times, I swear).  Instead of whipping out my Yelp app and making a wise choice, I swerved to the right and ended up at Katsura.\n\nI was seated immediately and experienced pretty attentive service the whole way through.  There were two waitresses that made sure that everyone in the packed dining area had everything they needed.  One star for that.\n\nThe menu had pretty typical offerings.  In the end, I settled on a beef curry rice bowl ($10.95) and an order of... dun dun dun... California rolls ($4.50)!  \n\nAfter placing my order, one of the waitresses brought me a cup of toasted rice tea and a bowl of miso soup.  The tea was good and the miso soup was decent (a tad bit too salty, but what can ya do).  Minutes later, the same waitress brought over the rolls and the rice bowl.\n\nI attacked the rolls first.\n\nHalfway through chewing the first roll, my heart sank.  They hadn't even bothered to season the rice at all.  Shamelessly hungry, I ate three more before pushing the plate away.  \n\nThe sloppy presentation of the beef curry rice bowl didn't inspire much confidence and one bite confirmed my suspicions - utter crap.  They really should rename this \"lukewarm bowl of curry sauce over a scoop of soggy rice,\" and make the description read: \"have fun playing the Where's Waldo? game with the miniscule bits of 'beef' swimming around.\"  But maybe that's too much to fit on a menu. \n\nI took a couple more bites before asking for the check.\n\nWhen the waitress asked if I wanted takeout containers I didn't know whether to burst out into maniacal laughter or glare at her.  Seriously??  \n\nAll snark aside, I think this place is a prime example of what truly disappoints me, that is, restaurants that take zero pride in what they do, places that seem to exist solely to churn out plated slop for profit.", "author": "Iona C."}

You don't come here looking for sushi that will blow your mind. It's a casual, unassuming place for when you don't feel like splurging. Special rolls are priced between $11-14, which is not bad! The portion size is pretty solid too - you get about 8 pieces. Each special roll comes with miso soup, which is fantastic for a cold or rainy day wandering around Japantown - completely delicious. We had the Hotel California and another roll whose name escapes me (it had tempura shrimp and spicy tuna on top). Both were actually quite good! Not the best sushi I've had but it does the trick! I liked how the lime on the Hotel California paired with the fish itself and the slightly sweet sauce at the bottom of the plate. And you can't go wrong with tempura shrimp!\n\nThe one major caveat I have with this spot is the service. We did come on an admittedly busy evening, but I don't think that's a good enough excuse. When we recited our order to our water (it was simple, just two rolls) she then repeated the order and it wasn't what we had said. I had to ask for hot water with lemon twice and when it came, there wasn't lemon. It took another two rounds of asking for lemon before I got it. I wasn't asking for much, so this peeved me a bit. It also took quite some time for the miso to come out, which shouldn't be that way given miso is pre-prepared in bulk.\n\nApart from the service, which perhaps wasn't how it usually is, this place is decent!", "author": "Sabina S."}

That's okay.\n\nMy review is mainly for the curry. I was wandering around, sad, alone, by myself, and I ended up here. I'd never tried this place, but it's been around for years, ever since I was in middle school. I figured it was time to give it a go. I had just finished crying. I needed comfort food. I had already tried On the Bridge and that place looked too happy and the people there were too kind, so I didn't really want to be seen.\n\nYou need places like this, where it's okay to dine by yourself and where the waiters don't really need to care THAT much - just enough to seat you, take your order, bring your food, and then get your check taken care of. Kushi Tsuru did just that.\n\nThe curry was actually quite good. I admit I was surprised; this curry got classified as \"close to the one back in Kyoto Daigaku\" for me. The portion was pretty huge and was only about $10. I ate about half when I got really full. I still had enough for two separate meals for the next couple of days. It also came with a croquette and meat, which was surprising to me. It's the only place I know that serves korokke curry in J-town so far, and that's by far my favorite. Plus, I didn't really have to order anything extra on top of it. They also serve your meal with miso soup, which has more flavor than other miso soups I've had. I know miso soup is supposed to be pretty plain, but whatever the flavor was there was pretty good, and I'm okay with having that as a soup.\n\nI wouldn't mind coming back here if I'm wandering around aimlessly in Japantown again.

From the food to the toys, anime and the trinkets she is just one of those kids who are so into it that whenever you say you're going to any place that resembles a touch of Nippon she would literally lit up from her usually cranky-hormone driven self. Having this in mind, I know she would love to go to Japantown and would love to have dinner in one of its restos. It's like a done deal, give mommy a pat on the back - but no. It wasn't what I would have expected. \n\nShe enjoyed Japan town alright but coming to this place left us feeling dissatisfied with the food and especially the service. Why did I felt this? Let me count the ways...\n1. The place is small the it couldn't accommodate our party of eight. We were told that we can have separate tables. Which we agreed since we were starving already.\n2. We needed a high chair for my friend's baby and they gave us one- a broken one. My friend questioned why are they giving us a chair with broken straps. They just shrugged and told us that they only have two and the owner has not fixed the chair yet. My friend insisted that they should fix it before some child falls off from their chair. We got no apologies.\n3. Time of taking our order after we complained about the high chair. 10 minutes.\n4. Time of getting our orders. More than 15 minutes. \n5. Minutes waited for spoon and fork after our meal was delivered. 5 mins and it was only spoons. I guess when they say one moment, it meant 5 minutes of wasted expectations.\n6. Minutes waited for the forks. 5 more minutes (seriously where are they getting it???) Did I say we were starving?\n7. Did someone asked us how we were doing? No... Not until minutes before the bill arrived ( however they were checking in with the other tables who came later than us). Seriously I felt like we were being ignored if not \"just\" tolerated.\n 8. Food - I am being nice when I say that their food was mediocre. The miso soup was way salty. The bento box we ordered were comparable with cheap food court stalls. The karaage chicken has a very sour special sauce and the meal was just- ehhh... Tho my brother said that the beef teriyaki was good while my friend's calamari was sub par.\n9. My daughter who decided to eat in a different table shouted to our side that she can't finish her food grilled salmon because it's making her dizzy and with the  blunt innocence every honest kid has , she said, \"I didn't like the food! \"... I seriously don't know how to react...yet somehow am proud of her braveness of telling it as it is - down right loud and clear....ahhh youth... Is a bliss!\n10. My daughter's order of California roll never came.\n11. When we got our bill it included a 18% tip. Which was appalling for the service we receive. My friend gave them a piece  of her mind and met into agreement in the end. They still got a tip but not by their terms. \n\nIf you have to eat Japanese food, try somewhere else.", "author": "Joy U."}

The bento box included two options of thins we wanted in the bento box. We chose Chicken teriyaki and shrimp tempura. In addition, there was salad, rice and California rolls. \n\nI thought the rice was overly wet, so it kind of ruined the California rolls, the rice alone and the beef don. The salad was a little unJapanese like. The sauce wasn't the normal chopped carrot sauce that many Japanese restaurants make themselves, it was normal Caesar Salad Dressing. The shrimp didn't taste very fresh, nor was it fried very well. The chicken was pretty average. One of the good parts about this meal was the egg and the beef in the don buri.

We were really hungry in the moment so we just decided to do a Yelp search and go to the nearest decently rated place. (YAY FOR YELP!!!)\n\nAnyways, our assumptions were true because the food we ate was mediocre at best. The miso soup you could see msg and salt particles or whatever powder they used for there miso soup. It really turned me off because I could feel the particles of the miso soup, usually it's suppose to be more dissolved than that.\n\n For the main course, we got the chicken teriyaki and shrimp tempura bento box that came with salad, rice and california rolls and we got the donburi, which is like rice with beef, onions, egg, and some sauce to give it some flavour, most likely fat from the beef. The beef was alright but not as great quality as I've had at other really good donburi places (This place literally called Donburi in Richmond Hill, ON, Canada) where the beef would literally melt in your mouth and would be super tasty. And yes the sauce felt like it was just fat / oil secreted from the beef.

However, since my friends back then would inexplicably insist on eating next door at Mifune (the food wasn't even that good!), I never got the chance.  Fast forward to a few years ago and, despite finally making my way here, the urge to come here started growing all over again.  Cravings?  Hardly.  No, it's all just because I never finished this review.  Ugh.\n\nSince my last trip here, both the menu's look and its array of offerings have been updated.  There seems to be more rolls now, but the menu still tilts towards hot dishes (bento boxes, dinner combos, entrees, ramen, soba, udon, donbouri, etc.).  It was cool to see the San Francisco Fire still on the menu, but the relatively unique bento box combos were what caught my eye this time.  Of the half dozen or so varieties, I opted for the TSURU BENTO, which included a Mini Chiraishi, Mixed Tempura, 3 pcs of Kappa Maki, 3 pcs of Nigiri, and Miso Soup.  \n\nAlthough it looked okay, the whole thing was pretty underwhelming.  Of the bunch, the Tempura was the only part that was fine.  I figured the Kappa Maki (Cucumber Roll) would be pretty generic, but the cuts of Hamachi, Tuna, and Salmon weren't very good.  The Chiraishi was even more disappointing though - a piece of shrimp, slices of fake crab, and some tamago aren't what come to mind when I think of \"chiraishi\".\n\nOddly enough, despite my experience, I feel like Kushi Tsuru could still be a decent option if only because of the size and variety of the menu (it can't all be bad, right?).

It was cramped and small but not too shabby. Got a table right away and it was a full-house for dinner time as well. Our orders took a while though - bf got the rice curry and I got Nabeyaki Udon & Calpico. Waitress came back saying they ran out of Calpico! WHATTTT??? What is Udon without Calpico??? Sigh* 7-Up it was.\n\nI'm sorry but if ur restaurant is in the middle of J-town then ur not allowed to run out of Calpico! Not to mention on the front cover of the menu it states \"best Japanese Restaurant in Japan Town\". Nahhh bro you ain't the best if you don't have Calpico!\n\nAnyways enough about that lol we waited for like 20 mins for our entrees and the food was a big disappointment. Too much curry  with the rice so it made the rice super mushy (almost like porridge consistency). Udon was lacking flavors but I managed to finish it since I didn't wanna waste food but was still sad that we had to pay for this. My bf didn't even finish his curry!!! I mean that is saying something Cuz he ALWAYS finishes his food!!!! I repeat...ALLLLLWAYS!!!!\n\nThe only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is cuz the staff were nice and it looked like they were trying to accommodate everyone, and it looked like they were short-staffed as well. But yea...definitely not the \"best japanese restaurant in J-town\".", "author": "Rose C."}

And as per usual, you get what you pay for. I got some chicken katsu which was sliced super thin and flavorless, even with their katsu sauce. The best part of my bento was the California roll and that's so impossible to screw up that it won't win them any points. \n\nService seemed very confused about their situation. As in they were a little slow with everything, including bringing us our check. We had someone refill our waters while we were clearly done with our meal, and 15 minutes later still no check.

(Although I've learned by past experiences to never have high hopes, I wasn't expecting too much.) Being on a budget, I choose a moderate priced item (the beef teriyaki lunch special priced around $9 but was supposed to come with miso soup so I figured it was alright) the portions were small, my friend's smaller and more expensive despite being the chicken version of my plate, and my first bite was my least favorite part of the meat, the fat. Overlooking that little detail that I assure myself is just like life and sometimes you gotta deal with the fat, I went on to the rest of the meal, asking my friends about how the miso soup is usually supposed to come first. I then witnessed our neighboring tables being served soup after their meals and assumed that ours would come soon after. \n\nAfter waiting for my friend's soda, thank god I got water or I would have been edgy and I'm not pretty when I'm edgy, we asked one of the ladies who were cleaning our table if we had miso soup coming and she explained that she just got there and didn't know. She asked if we still wanted it and we replied yes if we are still getting charged for it. The soda comes with an extremely apologetic lady who asks if we still want it and then tried to walk away with it... After we said we wanted it......... So more waiting in that super hot coup and no soup. She brings a check and tells us to take our time, assuming she was still bringing us our soup. \n\nWe check the check in case they happened to not charge is for our soup that came with the lunch special... All of the items had an (L) for lunch special. It had been nearly 2 hours and I was really not about to stay. We get up to leave and tell the man that we didn't receive our soup and gave me the most rudest \"tough shit\" expression and said he can still give it to us but he couldn't subtract it. I told him we couldn't stay, implying at least a take out. He just said he'd take it out of the tip. \n\nWhat. The.

Walking around and exploring Japantown can sure work up an appetite, so we decided to try this restaurant out since it had the shortest wait time and they weren't as expensive as Benihana. We waited about 10 minutes after we put our name down on the list to wait for a table. Despite being a fairly small restaurant, they had a rather extensive menu. Shortly after we were seated, our waiter greeted us and took our drink and meal orders. She was very friendly and attentive to our needs (we didn't have to ask her for refills on our drinks at all because she would notice on her own BEFORE our glasses were empty). We didn't have to wait long for our food to be brought out to us, despite the restaurant being very busy. Although it came out quickly, the food was very delicious and well prepared, which is one of the reasons why I keep stopping by to dine here whenever I'm in the area.\nAll of the hosts and waiters that I've encountered each time I've came here are very friendly, helpful, and attentive (even when the restaurant is very busy). The food is great (not as amazing as some of the food I had in Japan, obviously), but it's a little more on the pricey side, which is to be expected since it is in Japantown (aka tourist spot).", "author": "Paulamertha A."}

Why \"okay\" I say? It's because the seaweed salad made up for my meal it was the seaweed salad with spicy tuna it was really good for $4.00! So what I ate was chicken with egg and rice. So imagine eating water down rice with really chewy chicken and bland eggs. The chicken tasted old like a fishy taste, the rice was soft and mushy not my cup of tea. Now the eggs, eggs are dedicate foods because they burn easy. (My opinion) I had good Japanese food and having high expectation for quality food coming from japantown it would be good.

I like that their lunch special offerings were varied enough.  You get to choose between a selection of bento, donburi, curries, or udon.  Or you could skip that and try some sushi rolls.  I opted for the Katsu Don and my lunch buddy ordered a hamachi roll.  My donburi arrived piping hot, with the pork cutlet sliced into five pieces and topped with a slightly sweet, creamy sauce.  Below the cutlet was a scrambled egg with onions atop a healthy portion of brown rice.  Everything was seasoned well, but the cutlet lost its crispiness because of the sauce.  Flavor-wise it was okay.  I did enjoy the egg and rice.  I couldn't tell exactly what they added to the onions but it made them taste good.  Perhaps it was mirin?  That's just a guess.  Still, I liked it.\n\nAs for the hamachi roll that my lunch buddy ordered?  He said it was also just okay.\n\nI've read other reviews lamenting the service, but I found ours to be acceptable.  The waitresses seemed busy, although three of them found their way to our table to make sure our glasses were topped off with water and our plates cleared when we were finished with our meals.  We didn't have to ask for the check.  They handed it to us right after they cleared our table.\n\nAll in all, I would rate this about the same as the restaurant next door, which I've dined in three times and found it equally average.  I would go back and maybe try their udon.  The choices are more the traditional style and I'm curious how their Nabeyaki Udon would compare to one I had at a different restaurant.", "author": "Eileen P."}

Stopped in here for lunch today with my boyfriend. When we walked in, we noticed the place was very small and dirty, but figured sometimes the best restaurants don't necessarily look like it. This was not one of those restaurants. It took about five minutes before someone came to acknowledge we were there, and another couple of minutes to seat us (despite numerous tables being open). Once we were sat it took another ten minutes before someone came to take our order. We both ordered bento boxes, mine with Shashimi and Chicken Teriyaki. Bento Boxes come with two pieces of a California roll, miso soup, salad, and rice. We never got our miso soup and had to ask for it. The chicken was chewy and dry (like eating really bad jerky), and the Shashimi were the smallest cuts of fish I've ever seen from a sushi restaurant. The price (10.50) wasn't bad compared to other restaurants in the Japan Town mall, but honestly, I would've rather payed more somewhere else.

It's supposed to come covered with a variety of sashimi but instead, appeared to be just tuna. Next came our Chirashi bowls which ironically took longer than the cooked entree our friend ordered. The bowl was noticeably larger with the pieces of fish cut wrong and VERY large in size. I'm all for huge portions but you know the quality is usually going to suffer. Sure enough, it was fishy and tasted like it had just been quick defrosted.\n\nAs we left, we noticed a large yellow sign notifying the public of a change in ownership. It's been taken over by a new owner and the changes clearly show in the food.

My group of 11 will never be back. My first ever negative experience. Details below.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not one of those people that bashes restaurants or one of those criminal types that treat places and staff poorly and then write them a bad review after. I straight up just enjoy good food and appreciate good people trying to do right by others. This post is long and charged because people I care about weren't treated honestly.\n\nAnyone can check my other reviews. This is my first truly non-positive and longest review ever. I'm definitely none one that gives fewer bad atmosphere, loud patrons, broken tables, or even service time usually because I know that servers are so often overworked. I go strictly by quality and value of the food and the service rendered by restaurant staff. I could be sitting on a splintered wooden box next to a busy street and as long as the food is good and I don't get treated like an a**hole, I'll leave a generous tip, tell my friends, and bring them when I go back. But we just weren't treated with honesty and respect. If it had just been me, I might've let it slide. But it affected all of my friends and I just can't have that. I can't say that this wasn't just a unique experience to us since others have had okay experiences, but we said our thank yous after every single moment we were helped and demanded nothing extra and got this for it.\n\nA large group of hungry friends and I stopped by Japantown for a meal before heading back inland after a long day. We always had fantastic experiences at the many restaurants here and thought it would be appropriate to treat our exhausted, bloody, bruised selves. They were the only place at the moment that could seat my group of 11 and acted very happy to be filling up their empty tables. They brought out some decent miso and water for us and even replaced my dropped chopsticks literally seconds after I dropped them and without being nearby. To this point, we felt pretty good about this place.\n\nThen, not so much. We had split into two tables and while my other table had their orders taken promptly, I had to flag down a server after a cool and easy 10-15 minutes after they had passed us by multiple times, including to visit our other table that was further behind us. I didn't think it was on purpose, but poor service nonetheless. After that, we received our food which was mostly oyako dons, curries, and udon/soba soups which were actually spot on in taste and portion size. I had ordered a cherry blossom which had crunchy rice and fresh that clearly wasn't fresh but a friend's seaweed maki was decent. However the real kicker came afterwards, first one of my group had ordered a roll but was never served it and all of us had known it but thought nothing of it. When paying for his meal, however, he was still charged for it and despite mentioning it had never been served, the cashier insisted the restaurant was definitely correct and demanded payment. They argued back and forth and it wasn't until a few other friends were shaking their heads in disgust and talking about it that they relented. Then it came to my table, we had just been a part of this and hadn't been treated entirely well earlier either and were surprised to find that our group of 5 had been charged a gratuity that we felt was not appropriate. To my knowledge, gratuity is only applied for groups of 6, sometimes 8 or above and I can't recall seeing a sign for it in the front either. I asked them about it and they made no mention of their policy or anything but simply stated it was part of the bill and non-negotiable. I had wanted to make things right for my group, but we were all weary and wanting to return home and so we paid and ended up leaving with a bad taste in our mouths.", "author": "Charles M."}

Ironically, all restaurants in this area (Benihana, Osakaya, Mifune, and Kushi Tsuru) serve below average Japanese food.  \n\nWhile Kushi Tsuru is not a place to go for gourmet cuisine, I could see why people, especially tourists, would want to eat here.

I was quite confused when i came here last night. \n\nService was good, we got seated in about 5 mins and our waitress came right away, maybe a little too quickly. As my boyfriend and i finally figured out what to get, we got back her attention. He ordered the cold soba noodles and i ordered ramen, extra spicy. I decided to add a spicy shrimp roll with avocado, she looked reallllyyy, and i mean really confused. She kept asking if i wanted tempura shrimp and i said no, i explained it a few more times... and she finally said yes, nodded her head and said she has to ask the chef if he can make it.  She returned after a few minutes only to tell me that it as going to cost me 10$!!! That was pretty surprising. I saw on the menu, a spicy tuna roll was only 6$, meaning that a plain, non battered spicy shrimp roll should only cost about the same if anything less.\n\nI ended up not getting it, but both our dishes came out great. I was super bummed because i was really in the mood for avocado. :( The bowl of ramen was pretty big and had a lot of noodles, it wasn't as spicy as i had hoped but it was delicious. The broth and the noodles were so perfectly made that i couldn't help but to drink the broth in addition to eating all my noodles. I've never had soba noodle as my own dish before, but after taste testing the boyfriends, i might just reconsider it. It's weird eating noodles cold but the broth has a lot of flavors. \n\nIf you decide to eat here, only get whats on the menu.  Food is tasty, good quality and at a relatively good price (for whats on the menu).", "author": "Lisa H."}

It was about two and half inches in diameter (at its widest), about a millimeter and a half thick and all of it fat, even. \n\nAnd that sad little slice of Babe was supposed to justify spending $1 more than regular ramen?\n\nSome have compared the ramen itself to packaged, instant noodles. I'd argue that it's just slightly better than that, although you're certainly not getting freshly made ones. The broth was about as salty as instant noodles, though.  \n\nService was barely existent. I don't like to be bothered throughout a meal, but if someone asks for water or the check, please bring it. One of our party asked for water when the tea was brought and didn't get it 'til he was finished with his curry. \n\nSince we were on a time constraint (which wouldn't have been an issue had things arrived when we estimated - food took forever to come out and service was slow), my friend flagged down the server/owner(?) for the check.

We were going to get the Shabu Shabu but the waitress suggested the Sukiyaki instead because it has more flavor and we were happy to accept the suggestion.\n\nThe 49er roll came out first and while it had the standard serving of ginger that accompanies sushi, it was strangely missing the wasabi. We had to request for the wasabi and it was like the waitress was surprised that we wanted it. This happened to another table next to us too, so we weren't sure if they just wanted to emphasize the taste of their sushi or whatever. The roll was OK and they mixed things up by adding a bit of lemon to the roll.\n\nThe Sukiyaki was good and the beef was full of flavor in a broth that also had some veggies. The Kushi Bento was a good deal at $10 but everything was pretty average. Overall the food was OK but as a visitor in SF I'd look elsewhere for Japanese food. Bonus star for the waitress' honesty though.", "author": "Tim Y."}

They offer sushi, combination and Bento traditional meals.\n\nI ordered the Soba special ($11.00) which consisted of cold buckwheat noodles, tempura, keppa maki, 3 pcs of Nigiri and miso soup. I was in the mood for the Soba noodles and they were pleasant tasting. The tempura was not greasy, fried nice and crispy. The nigiri was not of super quality but I figured this was an add on to everything else. The lunch specials ranged from $9.50 to $18.00.\n\nGood service and very nice atmosphere in Japantown.", "author": "Jim D."}

But it's satisfying.\n\nWhat I love about this restaurant--love love love love love--is their \"green menu.\" Every restaurant should have a green menu. I think it's supposed to be a \"healthier\" menu, but for me it's a \"heavenlier\" menu. Now, the meals that are served as soup (udon, soba) have the option of being made with kombu / seaweed broth. They always tell me there is no fish in that broth whatsoever (bonito, etc), so I'm really taking their word for it, but if it's the case, most of the items on their Green Menu ought to be vegan / vegetarian (with the possible exclusion of some sauces that come on the sushi or other items--always check!--and miso soup, which is almost never vegetarian because of the use of bonito/fish). So props to kushi tsuru for being one of the very few Japanese places where people with diets like mine are able to eat happily and heartily ^.^.. \n\nThe service is always supremely friendly. I don't live in sf, but this is my Japanese restaurant of choice whenever I'm in the vicinity of Japantown. I've come here twice, months apart, and the Green Menu was there both times.

My sister went inside and asked how long the wait would be. She told her it would be about 15 minutes, we agreed to the wait and stood outside, since their waiting area only held two (or three chairs). The walkway between Kushi Tsuru and Benihana is pretty narrow, so we had to make sure we were completely out of the way. \n\nAfter about ten minutes, my sister's name was called. The hostess either didn't look or wanted to wait, but she was quick to cross my sister's name off and get ready to call the next party up. We had to cross the sea of people just to get to the entrance of the restaurant. Fortunately, my sister caught her in time and told her that we were there. We were seated and given our menus. Every minute or so, the waitress came by to see if we were ready. I had never eat there before and wasn't sure if I wanted the udon, ramen or rolls. After the third time she visited our table, we were ready. I order california rolls (I wanted to order something \"light\" since I had already eaten an hour before) and my sister ordered the chicken katsu. \n\nThe rolls were good, not amazing. I definitely wish I ordered udon or ramen. The chicken katsu was moist and delicious! Service was OK, it just seemed a little too fast-paced for my liking.

Nothing impressive. The beef udon wasn't as good as I had thought either. The soup flavoring was there but the meat wasn't seasoned. The tempura udon was a little disappointing. I think it makes more sense to put the tempura on the side rather than in the soup. By the time it got to our table the flour was soggy and falling off the shrimp.

Egad!...freaks me out every time.\n\nKushi Tsuru is the quiet eatery in the darkened hallway of Kintetsu Mall. No floating sushi here. No screaming, cleaver-wielding meat servers either. It's probably half the size of Mifune next door, and it certainly doesn't have the scope of plastic food replicas that Mifune has. I always thought it would be good for me to buy some of the plastic replicas, then bring them to a restaurant, display it on the table, and inform the waitress, \"OK, have the chef make this.\" But somehow, I don't think it would go over well at Lucky Penny.\n\nIf you don't know, deep-fried food is their specialty. Gotta love that...though the sushi is very good here. No complaints at all. But I seem to order the $10 salmon teriyaki a lot since it is a pretty hefty portion for a Japanese restaurant. Sometimes I have a weakness for the beef and chicken kushiage, which is about $2 a skewer. It adds up if you don't watch out.\n\nThe service is always nice...though they aren't the quickest in J-Town. That's ok since it's usually pretty low-key here, and you may want to just hang. So if the speedy daggers of Benihana have you in a dither or the sight of raw fish on a toy-boat makes you seasick at Isobune, then you should give Kushi Tsuru a try.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...deep-fried...mmmm.. Homer Simpson would be happy here.\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...a bit lacking but the low-key vibe is nice.\nSERVICE - 4 stars...really nice, a tad slow when the going gets tough\nTOTAL - 4 stars...a fine Japanese eatery even if you're not a mouthy tourist who thinks you're in Chinatown.", "author": "Ed U."}

I almost dragged my husband out of the place before we were seated, as I watched the host literally toss two menus onto a table where people had been sitting for 5 minutes, because no one had brought them menus. This is not done at a Japanese restaurant of any merit.  He was yelling into the kitchen that they needed to clear tables, and made staff actually watch and wait for the table to get up and leave, so they could clean the table for someone. \n\nThere was a table open, but they were understaffed, I hope.  Anyway, the waitress apologized, and seated us about 15 minutes after we put our names in at the desk. I should have realized that it wouldn't be good when I saw him toss the menus. I should have realized it wouldn't be good when I saw no line, when every other place in J-Town had a line.  I didn't follow my instincts fast enough.\n\nMy husband got the soba bento. His stomach had been acting wonky, and soba seemed safe.  The dipping sauce was fine, and the kappa maki was passable, but the soba was overcooked and soggy.  The nigiri sushi fish was poorly cut, and tasted like it had been defrosted in water. Just mushy and flavorless.  To their credit, he did not get food poisoning from their food.\n\nI love karei karaage (fried flounder), so I got the Chirashi Gozen Bento.  The fish was WAY overcooked to the point that I only could find one or two bites that I could break off of the mass of fish.  The skewers were drowning in teriyaki sauce.  The mini chirashi had again, the soggy, fish. Maybe it was precut or something, but it was just poor quality.  The assorted sashimi was sitting on sushi rice.  UM... I'm pretty sure that if sashimi is sitting on sushi rice, it's called chirashi.  There were two bowl of chirashi on the same plate, one with awful vegetables in the rice, and one without.  If you have something on the menu, and you are trying to be authentic, bother to learn what you should be serving.  It was bad. I think one of the bowls of rice was SUPPOSED to be just plain rice, but no, it was sushi rice in both bowls.\n\nBy this point, I was so disgusted, not sure if I should bother trying to fix it at that moment because the wait staff didn't see anything weird about serving two large sections of rice in a bento box that I figured, it wasn't worth it.

Although I found the decor and atmosphere to be very pretty with its dark woods and goldenrod walls, I felt it was really stuffy inside.  Didn't help that they placed us in the back room too.\n\nI'm not really quite sure what to say about the service.  They tried hard, but just not hard enough.  I had to ask twice for another napkin and chopstick set, but I'm glad they left the tea pot.  And also, the entrees didn't come out at the same time.  Most of the time, the staff was busy helping out other tables in the area even though we got seated first...don't know what's up with that.  \n\nWhen our server finally came to take the order (after doing the other tables first, like I said before), I ordered some sort of chirashi combo which came with some skewers and a fried flounder.  The chirashi was so, so disappointing.  They had the nerve to serve me fake crab, and the sashimi selection wasn't even that great!  Just 4 measly slices or something, and NO salmon.  What. the. eff.\n\nMy friend's ten-zaru soba (tempura and soba combo) came some time later (of course I waited for his food to arrive!) and he had no complaints about the food, obviously.\n\nDessert was anmitsu and some red-bean with green tea ice cream.  All in all, it's just....fine.  Not too thrilled about the service.  I'm eager to try the other restaurants in J-town.", "author": "Ivana Y."}

I should have just stuck with my guns and waited out the line at Suzu. \n\nMy sister and I arrived around 6:40 and waited for 15 minutes to order. I got the tonkotsu ramen and my sister got the \"California bento.\" The bento came with 2 pieces of California roll, chicken teriyaki, fried fish, tuna sashimi, salad, miso soup, and rice. Sounds like a lot of food, right? And a pretty good deal at $9.50, too? Not so. Everything other than the soup and rice came on a single plate, all piled up together on top of a large portion of boring salad, instead of in a traditional bento box. I think this was a ploy for them to serve less food. Forget bang for buck at this place. The \"fried fish\" was literally a single, tiny piece of fried fish with a bit of tartar sauce on top. There were three mediocre pieces of tuna. They were mushy and had texture reminiscent of having been frozen and then defrosted. Most of the chicken teriyaki was fat or skin or bone. The salad actually tasted okay, drenched as it was in teriyaki sauce. My sister said the California rolls were pretty good too, too bad there were only two pieces. The miso soup and rice were okay, but God forbid they mess those up at a Japanese restaurant. Definitely not a good deal though.\n\nMy tonkotsu ramen was ridiculously BAD. The soup was the right milky color, but the taste was extremely salty and without depth of flavor. The broth was SO salty that I could not drink it at all. The toppings were practically nonexistent. I got a tiny one-inch square piece of sliced pork that was an end piece and mostly consisted of fat. It was nasty. There was one measly piece of nori, a tiny sprinkling of green onions, one tiny slice of fish cake, and maybe three pieces of pickled bamboo. Oh yeah, there was also some stubs of bean sprouts with a funny flavor. And don't get me started on the noodles. I've never had such nasty, limp ramen noodles. They were relatively thin, but had no bite in them at all. I would say that even 10 cent Top Ramen tastes better than the noodles they used. I will NEVER come back here. Even the basic ramen at Sapporo-Ya which featured boring soup and only spinach and green onions was better than this dreck.\n\nThis place is awful. Next time, I will make sure to pay attention to the lines. There's a reason why there is always a line outside Suzu and Mifune. Avoid this place.", "author": "Leslie H."}

I'm not a sushi/sashimi/japanese food expert by any means, but I could definitely tell that the sashimi from this place wasn't the best. I ordered the 9 piece sashimi moriawase, which was 3 pcs. of three types of fish (salmon, tuna, and mackerel, I believe). The food itself was...mehhhh. The fish didn't taste the freshest; the color of the fish was very telling. I'd say I'd give the food a 3-3.5/5 stars. \n\nThe price wasn't great though, at least not for the sashimi. It was $15 dollars for the sashimi moriawase, which didn't come with any rice, miso soup, or salad, as I've seen other restaurants do. Maybe I would have forgiven the absence of rice/miso/salad if the fish were fresher and more delicious, but alas, that was definitely not the case. What's weird is my mother ordered the California bento (2 pc. california roll, 3 pc. tuna sashimi, teriyaki, rice, and salad) which was $10, and my grandmother ordered the Tori udon, which was $8.00. They both seemed to get a significant amount of food for much less than what I paid for my sashimi. This would *seem* to suggest that the fish would be extremely fresh and aamzing -- definitely not the case. \n\nOverall, I'd say this place didn't meet my expectations. I paid a pretty penny for pretty average fish. The udon was apparently pretty good, so I'd recommend that over the sashimi. Ultimately, restaurant row is fullllllll of sooooo many choices for good Japanese eats. Look elsewhere (try Mifune).", "author": "Weian W."}

The food itself was tasty and made well enough, although it came out somewhat slow considering how little business there was when I went. Really, when I think about it, there isn't much on the menu to differentiate Kushi Tsuru from any other place in Japantown, and it certainly wasn't good enough to make me a regular when compared to Mifune's excellent dishes.\n\nService was nice and polite, though somewhat pervasive at times (probably because it was slow), though it wasn't a huge deal.

It's a bit of a wait before my food arrives, and I notice right away that the portions are small.  One flattened grilled chicken thigh with skin intact charred on one end, but nicely grilled on the other served on a lettuce leaf and drowned in teriyaki sauce.  Except for the charred parts it tasted pretty good.  The California roll was tasty too, but it was difficult to figure out whether I was eating imitation crab or real crab since the filling was minced finely accompanied only by a chunk of slightly-browning avocado.  The ginger that was served to the side of the California roll had an unpleasant, kept-too-long-in-the-jar-type of taste to it.  Neither waitress stopped to ask if everything was okay during any point of the meal.  My rating shows three stars, but maybe two and three quarters should be sufficient.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

It had a better name but I can't remember. But essentially it is a salad with deep fried spicy tuna rolls, with a generous toss of wakame - or seaweed. It was a nice take on a salad, but tasted just ok.\n\nTried the specialty roll - Otoko yama - which was a California roll topped with salmon and tuna and black and green roe. Very pretty presentation, 8 big sizeable pieces - all for $12. This I liked a lot. Great tastes and condiment pairings.\n\nHere's where we ordered too much - also had the Nabeyaki noodles $11. It was a cold evening so I wanted something warm. It comes in a big clay pot filled with tofu, salmon, shrimp and various seafood, noodles and veggies. The fish was overcooked but the broth was good.\n\nThis is a simple place to have dinner. I would go back and try other specialty rolls.", "author": "Cindy W."}

The hostess and waitresses wore these beautiful Kimono's and had their hair up in Chopsticks. Very formal looking actually. I especially loved how they remembered who my mother and I were and would greet us with smiles and warmth. We'd always sit in a booth and I would drink my sprite and my mom would get her tea or iced cold coke with a straw. My mom loved to dress up so she would be in her endless Macy's designer Jeans or an expensive skirt suit. \n\nMy mother would order sashimi and she would always get me the shrimp tempura. \n\nFood then was better. The taste and quality were impeccable. The tempura had large tiger prawns, huge vegetables, good rice and excellent friendly service.\n\nAs a child I placed Tempura as my favorite food then macaroni and cheese and mcdonalds burgers would fall in after this place.\n\nI remember after leaving this place, my mom and I would go to the Hello Kitty store and I'd get one toy or a bunch of stickers for being \"good\" and then we'd go to a cake shop called Marie Antoinette.\nThink Andersen's bakery dessers but alot better quality than Andersens. My mom would buy me a cream puff, and a box of chocolate dream cakes, strawberry short cakes, fruit flans, and cheesecakes to take home for the family.

Maybe its that we had a late lunch, shopped for hours, or plainly had smelled something good, but we decided to try Kushi Tsuru.\n\nThe place is very small, luckily we went at 4 pm, so no lunch/dinner crowd.  I was glad they were still open as most Japanese restaurants close to prepare for dinner patrons.  \n\nI got the Kastudon ($7.25) and my girlfriend ordered  a something-don (I will edit when I find out).  The Katsudon (fried egg and pork cutlet over rice) was very fresh tasting.  Grilled green and white onions complimented the pork and rice with more flavor. I fell in love at first bite and didn't stop until I had cleaned out the bowl. \n\nMy first impression of price was that it was a little expensive, but upon finishing, I thought it was about right for what you got.  Service was very attentive but we were also 1 of the 2 patrons in there. Oh I forgot, we also got miso soup and this stale looking coleslaw that I didn't touch, anyone know what the coleslaw is for?

This place has some great combo platters.  As with most Japanese restaurants, the wine is drinkable, but not much more. The clientele was well-behaved and there I didn't see any cell phonies or yuppie mommys and daddies in the place. There were mostly Japanese diners and some tourists, and not many locals.  That suits me just fine.  We were treated like guests in the old style Japanese way.  \n\nI want to thank all of the reviewers who found this place to be bad or mediocre.

We were quickly seated in the back and we checked on a few times by a nice young waitress to see whether we were ready to order. We had a party of eight, so it did take us awhile to get our orders ready-to-go. When we were finally ready to order, it was no longer the nice young waitress...but an older Chinese lady. We sat at a long table but there was enough room for her to stand at both ends, YET she stays at one end of the table where she first stood and shouted out \"NEXT\" without even making ANY eye contact after EACH of us kindly gave her our order. After the second \"next\" from her, I was already irritated outta my mind! SHE WAS PLAIN RUDE!!! My friends and I couldn't believed how rude she was!! When our orders came, she stood at the same spot that was at earlier and had us distribute each plate of our food to each other! WTF?!?! Where's our service?!?!? Was this a self-serve restaurant??!?! We were hesitant ask her for anything! She did not looked happy to deal with us and just seem unapproachable. We ate our food quickly because we wanted to leave this hell-hole ASAP. The behavior from this lady was really uncalled for, we have done nothing to deserve this kind of service.

The lunch started well enough, with the miso soup having a nice fermented tang to it, and the edamame fresh and hot and salty.  But it went a little downhill for there.  My other half's sushi (rainbow rolls, eel rolls and spicy tuna rolls) weren't very good.  Not bad or expired, just something a little off.  My sukiyaki bowl was ok, but rather bland.

Mainly because of the delicious sauce filled clams that we were craving. \n\nUnfortunately, the plastic food from the display window looked and probably tasted better than the food we were served. \nThe clams ($9) were boiled in tap water and has no sauce in site (10 pieces). \n\nThe chicken katsu was especially bland and smaller than I ever seen (6 MINI pieces).\n\nThe curry was directly from the on-sale-already expired-one minute mix curry powder from safeway select. It didn't only look OLD, but tasted like shoe with huge halves of potatoes because the chef was too lazy to chop them. \n\nOur server was angry with us, the world and her job apparently. She treated us like we owed her family money for YEARSSSS! She was not only rude to us, but she also seemed to HATE the couple next to us. (Possibly owed her family lots of money as well). She forced them to accept the food that she had mis-ordered for them and insisted that the price was the same anyway, so who cares?! The customer unwillingly gave in, only to receive a look of frustration from the server and to eat the food that they didn't order!

I suggested to T that we try Suzu in Japantown, so we headed out that way.  Upon arriving, we saw that it was closed Tuesdays.  It was already about 9p, so we decided to see what was still open.  We walked upstairs and came upon Kushi Tsuru.  In the past, I've been suckered into going to Mifune next door and I know a lot of tourists like to frequent this 'strip'.  But looking at the menu, it didn't seem bad.  Besides, my stomach began to growl...or was that T's?\n\nWe went in and were quickly seated.  T opted for the Chicken Udon, and I decided, since we were gonna share the soup, on a dinner combo of chicken karaage and salmon sashimi.   A nice large Sapporo also quenched our thirst.  The food came out quickly.  While I'm used to seeing a dinner combo in a bento box, no box came with this meal, which was fine with me.  It's usually hard to eat from the box, so I preferred the bowl of rice and separate plates.  The sashimi was good, not the best, but satisfying, as was the karaage. T's bowl of udon was huge.  The udon was tender and chewey, but not overcooked.  And the broth was very good.  I think I should've stuck to my original plan and ordered the udon, but I suppose I can do that the next time.  Prices were very reasonable, being that it's in the Mall.  And the staff were also very friendly and quick.  Will definitely go back if I need an udon fix or a quick meal.", "author": "JeFF T."}

I will also just stop here if I'm on my way home on the 38 Geary. (Get out at the Webster stop and head up the Japantown staircase. It's so easy and convenient.) \n\nThis place is so reliable. Everything is fresh, fairly cheap and what I consider to be good Japanese family style food. My daughter and her friends always love to eat with me here, too. \n\nI recommend the tataki salad ~ a staple for me ~ a nice crunchy green salad with lots of seared tuna ~ a delicious and light meal which I usually fill out by adding a couple of Kushi (fried items with batter on a bamboo skewer & dipping sauce) the garlic, potato, tuna and salmon ones are particulary good. In fact I like the tuna ones the best, but I don't even know if they're still on the menu. They changed this menu somewhat recently -- I've been coming for years, so I go ahead and order the tuna anyway. The kushi is what the restaurant is named for so you have to try at least 1 or 2.\n\nTheir sushi is not a highlight, but I appreciate that they almost always have fresh uni. This makes a nice side to my meal, too. My daugher and her friends always order one of the Udon specials--seaweed, tempura, or tofu. \n\nThe grilled eggplant with sweet miso sauce is also nice (but sweet!) Nice to pair it with something more savory.\n\nfast, reliable, centrally located, and very dependable for a good homey meal...follow up with a creme brulee at the Anderson Bakery right across the hall ~ absolutely perfect creme brulee.\n\nupdate: menu's overhauled--no tataki salad--but seared albacore is on the sashimi menu. no individual kushi (this is very sad!) but you can still get a kushiage dinner (lots of kushi). their fish and sushi are so very fresh though.", "author": "Liza B."}

It was just a few pieces of meat and a few pieces of tofu . The meat was decent . The tofu was nice and firm . I didn't like the fact that almost the whole bowl was filled with lettuce . I rather just go shabu shabu for the price they charged for it . They had two dipping sauces .. ponzu and some other sauce . Ponzu is of course good but the other dipping sauce lacked flavor !! I ordered a sushi roll .. I forgot what it was called .. I believe it started with the letter K . Anywho , it wasn't superb but decent . Same goes with the spicy tuna . It wasn't really spicy and I've had fresher spicy tuna rolls . Overall , interesting and decent  place to dine for people who like to switch it up once in a while but overpriced . Don't let the display fool ya !!", "author": "Eileen L."}

For $11.50 I got a \"combo\" dinner that consisted of a thin slice of salmon teriyaki, a 6-piece California roll, a bunch of rice, and a little bit of miso soup that doesn't taste that great.  And I have to oder some nigiri in addition to the combo, or else I will still be hungry.", "author": "Kandi K."}

Kushi Tsuru knows that it'll have customers regardless, because the other better restaurants fill up and spill into this one. It's over priced and the service is pretty horrendous - or maybe it was just our waitress- but she was hostile and forgot to take my order. When I said, \"Miss, you forgot to take me order.\" she glared at me and started to rattle off the orders she did take. She read five items. There were six of us. I'd seriously never go back.

Once we were seated it took 20 mins for someone to even come over and recognize our table. The waitress just kept passing by us ,not even looking our way. After forever they finally took our order, she got my order of rolls wrong,but I just ignored it and ate them, I didn't want to argue. I figured it wouldn't help. The food was ok,nothing special. After we were done ,we asked for the bill. I was so use to seeing the tip added on the bill at every other restaurant ,that when I received the bill I just looked at the total ,assuming the gratuity was included ,and just split the total between us and the other couple. Once we left ,the waitress chased our friends down and started hassling them about not leaving a tip. My friends were really confused,because they also assumed it was included. They came to look for us to mention it to us and when we turn around to face them ,there was the waitress. I couldn't believe she followed us all the way across the in door plaza. She then stood there with a dirty look at started to almost yell at us in an ugly tone about how we HAD to pay her a tip of $12!! I was really thrown off,but then got upset, . I mean ,last time I checked it was an OPTION to tip someone if you liked the costumer service,and I didn't like their service. If it was mandatory,they should have included it in the bill! I told her she was extremely rude to have done this , and that this had never happen to us before. She just rolled her eyes. At this point,I didn't feel she deserved anything! My boyfriend felt bad and gave her $5 to leave us alone, she then shoved  her hand in front of us to give her more !!! I mean,we had already paid over $80 bucks for shitty service  and food ,we are in a recession!!! Never again will I back here!!! SUper RUDE and CRUDE PEOPLE!!!", "author": "christy l."}

Though, my oyakodon was pretty worth it. I forget, but I think it was around $8 or so? I have to admit, it was really good. The chicken was tender and the onions were tasty (i'm usually not fond of onions). My friends ordered some sushi special or something like that, and I found that pricey. One major thing that I must complain is that the sashimi was so not fresh. When my friend picked it up, it started to break and stretch out like an accordion...okay, i'm not really good at describing things, but all i can say is that their raw fish are not fresh. A plus on the other side is that their service is nice. Theres always some one checking up on you constantly. Extra point for that!", "author": "Vivian C."}

Their food is not spectacular, and the venue is not particularly attractive. We've tried the other places in the mall but we always come back to this one. We always either go for the tempura udon on a cold SF day, or the CB special bento (teriyaki chicken with rice, miso soup, salad, and sushi rolls) on a warm day. I guess that's really the reason why. It's comfort food. Plus, it reminds us of those little restaurants we used to squeeze into in Shinjuku. Now if they would only give us those nice little wet naps before each meal, I would give them another star. Itadakimasu.", "author": "Rey L."}

Now seriously that couldve been decades ago! But  to the point kushi tsuru was not great it was alrite, i got the donburi and it was small and very average tasting.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-12-20", "description": "This one star is for the food. The only thing holding them up from a -8 is the quality of food. The service here was awful. I have never been treated so badly in San Francisco. My friends and I are in high school, and are used to general discrimination. However, tonight was ridiculous. They handed us a stack of menus at the front and they told us to go to the back. Then they took 25 minutes to take our order. The server was very rude to one of my friends because she didn't pronounce what she was ordering correctly. Then we had to actually ASK for tea and water. Then we waited...and waited....and people in the neighboring booth who had come after us (getting much more courteous service) received their food before us. The food was pretty good, I have come here many times before (with a decent level of service) with my family. My friend ordered a $12.50 tonkatsu and tempura combo, and the portion was half of my friends $8.00 donburi. Wtf is with that? And then our tea and water were never refilled. We waited for our check for a long time, after asking the waiter and waitress several times and being brushed off. The host, the one with the glasses, nitpicked with us for 6 cents. SIX FRIGGIN CENTS. *sighs* I dislike this age-profiling shiz. Don't go here if you are younger than 20 or expect any level of service.", "author": "Shizuka L."}
