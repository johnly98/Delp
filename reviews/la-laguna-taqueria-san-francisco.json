It is good to have a taqueria in the neighborhood. This is because for anyone craving for burritos, nachos, quesadillas or tacos, La Laguna Taqueria got you covered.\n\nI have been meaning to order a burrito from here. So I finally did. I came in for a burrito and ordered one with shredded chicken, rice, beans and cheese. The portion size of the burrito is quite generous. A large tortilla means more room for any extra ingredients I choose. This is something I really like. This meal portion sizing is good enough to satisfy my large lunch craving. I will have to come in, order and try other items from the menu.\n\nSpacious facility, good food and good service.\n\nWork nearby? This is it. It's one of the eateries to eat at.\n\nI am impressed with how friendly the guy was. Service was relatively quick, I didn't have to wait very long either.

With the rainy elements, many people like to stay home. Not me. \n\nFor lunch, I had the grilled steak Super burrito for $8.75. The meat was cut into cubes and not too burnt. And you get a huge chunk fit into that large flour tortilla, along with the other fresh key ingredients. I also ordered a $5.00 bottle of Speakeasy \"Big Daddy\" IPA. This is the first taqueria that sells the San Francisco micro-brew.

I myself have my own little family now and we checked out La Laguna about a month ago and were really happy with the taste of the food. \nOur first time here we originally wanted to dine in but we were pressed for time. It was a Saturday and getting close to noon and the place was pretty empty. We asked the lady of we could just take it to go and she was super friendly and packed it up for us. \nWe ordered 4 burritos and all were very tasteful and had a good amount of meat inside!!!! The the carne asada was seasoned well and not too salty, we also liked that there wasn't too much fat on the meat! I've been to places where there was hardly any meat but huge chunks of fat!! This place definitely didn't do that. \nThe second time, I ordered for pickup and we got the same thing and again it was quality food....\nWe again ordered for pick up and food was always ready in the amount of time given!! \nNow......\nToday(being our 4th time) I asked Jessica (the super nice cashier) if they offered a \"super super burrito\"..... She looked at me with a little grin and said No but she can ask the cook..... She goes and asked Antonio (the guy cook that's only there early in the day) if he could do it.... She came back and told me that he was willing to try!!!!!\nSo here's how it went down,\nI ordered a \"super super steak and prawn burrito\" meaning they used two tortillas lengthwise and of course made two super burritos into one. \nANTONIO nailed it!!!! My husband was beyond happy with his gigantic burrito!!!! Again, the flavor was there, the portion of meat and prawns were good and the green salsa is to die for!!! It is our favorite salsa from any taqueria... They also have a red salsa that is pretty tasty too!! \nTo wrap this up, this is probably now our favorite taqueria in the Bayview! They also have online ordering and are available on eat 24 which is pretty cool if you need your food delivered!!! \nThank you Jessica for always having outstanding customer service and of course Antonio for creating this monster burrito for my Hubby!!! \nI'm sure we will return soon and will probably try something new off the menu!!!", "author": "Siai M."}

Sounds \"fishy\".  \n\nI'm gonna be completely forthcoming.  I've only had their quesadillas, and they've only been at places outside of the business.  They were REALLY REALLY good!  Not just stuffed with queso, but also surprisingly stuffed with Carne.  Lots and lots of pollo.  And both times I had them, they were super super delicioso.  They are pretty close to mi casa, and they are on my normal bike route, so I'm going to have to stop and eat there sometime soon.  Maybe I'll never have anything else on the menu.  But that wouldn't be very Yelp-adventurous of me, now would it?  Needless to say, if those quesadillas were the only thing I ever had from The Lagoon, I'd be satisfied with them forever.
