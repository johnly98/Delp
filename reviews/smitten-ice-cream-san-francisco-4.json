Unlike other ice cream shops, this one is not good for sampling. Some flavors that I wanted to try like watermelon cream were not available because no one ordered them so they were melted. That doesn't sound good. It makes me wonder if they reuse the melted stuff. \n\nI enjoyed the exceptionally smooth texture minus a tiny ice chip of the small Matcha Verbena I had but the flavor was mediocre. I would've liked a stronger matcha flavor. I could taste the verbena only slightly. And the ice cream left an odd sickly sweet aftertaste when finished. The only redeeming feature about this place is the bathroom. If you're in the mood for ice cream and don't need to use the toilet, you can skip this stop and get bigger portions at Salt & Straw up the street.", "author": "Lauren H."}

Sure, the process of making their ice cream flash frozen in liquid nitrogen is pretty cool to watch and experience. It's similar to a magician using a puff of smoke to create an illusion.  \n\nHowever, the flavors in their ice cream is lacking compared to what I'm used to. We recently came here during National Ice Cream Day, which was last month on July 15th. We decided to get the coffee flavor with toasted almonds. Even though the sauce was free that day, we opted not to get it since I wanted to taste the flavor. I got the Mountanos Family Organic Coffee flavor and I couldn't get much coffee taste. Actually, the flavor was pretty mild and not too sweet, which I liked, but there was only a hint of coffee flavor. When you advertise coffee, you better deliver. \n\nAgain, we've had other flavors before and they were fine, but my taste buds hasn't developed quite the affinity for it. I also give props to Ruben Sue Fisher for starting her ice cream empire, which has now 4 locations in the city. She literally built this from the ground up. \n\nI'm not quite smitten over Smitten yet, but if I'm in the area and want an ice cream, I'd probably stop by and try their flavor of the day. \n\nI'd rate it a decent 3 1/2 stars.", "author": "John G."}

But why is there a surcharge for the 3 flavors that rotate? I found that very odd. I've never been to an ice cream shop where some flavors cost more. Having said that I appreciate the matcha Verbana flavor... Though it didn't taste like matcha, but the verbana was something I had never tried in an ice cream and I liked it. They only have small (2 scoops) , regular (3 scoops} and large (??? scoops) listed. But apparently you can order a kid sized one that only has one scoop.. this isn't listed on their menu.

I also liked that they seemed to have a rotation of 8 flavours because I get overwhelmed when provided with lots of choices... hence my phobia of menus at Chinese restaurants. \n\nI picked the Mountanos Family Organic Coffee ice cream because I like pretending to be a coffee snob and I was really surprised to hear my name being called literally 30 seconds after I paid (although that sorta makes sense because they probably just had to scoop it into a cup for me...)\n\nI spent a good minute taking the perfect picture and when I finally took my first bite... w o w what a difference from all the other ice cream I've eaten. Not too sweet, super super creamy, but not too heavy. The ice cream was miles above all the other liquid nitrogen places I've tried before (and I tried a lot because my ex insisted on trying all of them).

So we watched as they mixed and froze and mixed our ice cream. There is a glass window, so we could see the entire process and it was pretty interesting. The ice cream was creamy and delicious. It was not hard serve or anything, so it kind of oozed as it melted, but we enjoyed every bite, and the fresh waffle cone.

One of the differences I noticed was smoother and softer ice cream. Smitten makes 6 flavors a day but they rotate every now and then. You can't mix flavors or have more than one in each order whether it's a small medium or large. That's one downside of nitrogen ice cream. Courtesy of the thanx app I got an offer for a free small. I went with bee sting which really should be called bee kick! The little peppers smack you in the mouth after each bite. The earl grey could be stronger, the flavor was actually subtle for me.

(minus 29 you would never order)\", or \"Good, but nothing you haven't seen before (Looking at you, B&J - did you die?)\"; but let's face it, on a warm summer day these are all you need....or are they....\n\n4. Enter Stage Right - Smitten Baristas scoop balls of milky goodness  the size of baby peaches from spinning tongs ensconced in a flowing ice fog (stay with me, this isn't imbued hyperbole)... then carefully, as if cradling baby chicks, they move the nitrogen cooled ice cream nuggets  into your bowl or waffle cone; sauces are then squeezed over the top according to order... and from that moment you are \"Smitten\": or \"Smittened\"; or is it Smittereened?\"\n\n4. Taste - my taste buds said this abt Tcho 60.5% Chocolate - .\"OMG!\", \"That's amazing!\", \"Fo Shizzle my Nizzle!\" - in other words it's crazy good; the Cookie Dough with Pretzel and Chocolate Chips and the Classic Vanilla? Ditto C.G.  I took a pint of the Chocolate home (if I had an ice chest in my wine cellar I'd keep it there, if I had a wine cellar.)\n\nYour turn to enjoy the theatrical and patented nitrogen cooled development process and then be amazed at the organic goodness of Smitten's product  - a contrast as dramatic as \"Techies in the Tenderloin\"", "author": "Jason J."}

The machines in the shop have an old vibe to them.  A little cramp as there is not much space to sit and chill with your fresh creation. \n\nFood\n  Treat - I went with a small and it just the right amount of a treat.  The price point is little on the high side.  The reason is that they make it right now.  Batches are going using frozen nitrogen to create the ice cream.  Gotta love science, it is like a science lab going on with all the nitrogen fog going on.  Yeah I am a nerd.  I think I enjoyed watching the process more than the ice cream.  The ice cream was great but nerd in me wanted to watch more and more.  A part time job perhaps, dang it, I live to far away. \n\nService - Great.  They get your name when you pay for your treats with a credit card.  They need to call your name with a last initial.  Yeah I have a very common name, which I know.  But there were two other Paul's in the short line wait for their treats as well.\n\nFuture - Yes and perhaps one of their another location to see if they have more space.", "author": "Paul S."}

I'm not a huge fan of holiday flavors (don't love cinnamon and candy canes) and \"Chrismukkah\" is what's available at this time of the year. There was another seasonal flavor that was also too Christmasy for me. I wish they would only do one seasonal flavor at a time, even during the holidays.

Get your mind out of the gutter!  ;-)\n\nWhat is it about ice cream that no matter how cold it is outside, you'll still indulge in a scoop or two?  I mean, this doesn't apply to frappes or boba, but ice cream is just so special.\n\nWe were approaching Smitten and I saw a parking spot after 9PM last Tuesday.  I've heard great things about Smitten and tried a shop in Burlingame that has the same concept, but never tried Smitten.  It was a hard decision between mint chocolate chip and salted caramel, but I asked hubby, and the cashier and she highly recommended the mint if we like mint, since they use real mint loves when making it.  So we went with the mint, and then, I saw the cookie dough and pretzel one..'doh..next time!  Cool that the cashier mentioned the Smitten guarantee, in which they'll make another ice cream for you if you're not happy with your purchase.  \n\nA small is $5 and looks like on scoop, a regular is $6 but three scoops so we opted for the regular.  We were waiting awhile for our ice cream to be made, but that's the whole deal with the made to order liquid nitrogen ice cream shops.  It wasn't green, so you know for sure they use all natural ingredients.  It was white and super smooth with the chocolate chips in there.  First bites, very minty but refreshing.  After a little bit my tongue started feeling the tingles.  The ice cream held up very well, as we were able to finish it without much melting.  \n\nI still love Bi-Rite the most, but Smitten is a nice but kind of pricey treat every once in awhile.

There's a large bench by the window, and then one/two seaters inside (repurposed wagon), and a two-top table and 4-seater bar stool table in the back, by the ginormous liquid nitrogen tank.\n\nPrices = moderate. $5.00 for a small.  Seems pricey. But it's pretty damn delicious. Two small scoops in a cup. Or pay for the waffle cone or bowl. ($6.00 for regular, and $11.00 for a pint.)\n\nIf you're in a rush, this is not your place.  So if you're planning to go here...plan to wait for the ice cream is made to order.  Worth the wait.", "author": "Fannie S."}

She didn't know what that was, so I explained to her the process of how Smitten makes ice cream: ingredients quickly frozen with liquid nitrogen.  It's visually appealing while you wait for it.\n\nShe was intrigued and turned the corner to find a parking spot.  The line wasn't as long when we got there, as turnaround is pretty quick.  I ordered the strawberry white balsamic with TCHO crunchies.\n\nIt's a very interesting flavor.  The strawberry flavor was very light.  I didn't get much of the white balsamic flavor.  The TCHO crunchies were good, and I was given an extra cup since I ordered a small and the crunchies would topple over.\n\nI like the texture of this ice cream.  It's very smooth and creamy, but not airy like gelato.  I think if the flavors were allowed to steep overnight, it would have a much stronger taste to it.  It's a little more on the pricey side, but you're also paying for the ambiance, even if you take it to go.", "author": "Vira P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-09", "description": "The first time I came to Smitten, I absolutely fell in love - I wanted to walk up all the crazy Pac Heights hills for Smitten and sacrifice all of my clean eating. I had the Cr\u00e8me Fraiche with Pear Caramel, the seasonal flavor, and it was totally unlike anything I had ever tried before. The ice cream itself had this wonderful, rich, creamy flavor that wasn't too sweet, so it complemented the amazingly decadent pear caramel very well. Definitely worth the extra fifty cents for the seasonal flavor... And I forgot to mention that since I'm an aesthetic eater (i.e. food must look good AND taste good), the ice cream here definitely didn't disappoint on the appearance front.\n\nMy first experience was so good that I dragged a couple of my friends with me a second time even though we were all stuffed from brunch. I told them that Smitten was too good to miss. Since we had three people, we went for the flight of three so that we could try a multitude of options. We chose the Tcho chocolate, seasonal maple brown sugar pumpkin, and cookie dough (with pretzels and chocolate chips) as our three flavors and were super anxious to try them all. Honestly, we were a little let down. My friends were really excited to see the liquid nitrogen ice cream process, but the ice cream itself tasted just like normal ice cream... nothing special. And for the flight, the servings are smaller than a normal scoop, so it didn't look as aesthetically pleasing either. They were all good ice cream flavors, just nothing as extraordinary as the cr\u00e8me fraiche flavor that I had on my first visit there. I was so sad that my friends weren't able to enjoy the same experience that I had my first time!\n\nOverall, I think you're paying for the experience. Smitten is definitely on the higher side of ice cream in SF... even more expensive than Bi-Rite, Mitchell's, or Humphrey's Slocombe. For $5 you can get a small size ($5.50 for the seasonal flavor), and a flight of three, tiny scoops of ice cream is $9. I can get two large pints of ice cream in a supermarket for that price!! I would say, if you haven't had liquid nitrogen ice cream before, it's definitely worth a try. I would also recommend trying the seasonal flavors because they seem to have the highest probability of WOW-ing you. I probably won't frequent Smitten as much as I initially thought I would after this second, not-as-amazing experience. Don't get me wrong - the ice cream was still good, just not worth $5 for a small scoop!", "author": "Sheila D."}

If there's a downside here it's that you can't get samples, but know that's because they literally make your ice cream to order - right there in front of you! Fantastic concept.

A small scoop of ice cream here at Smitten Ice Cream is $7.00. Seven dollars as in, a dollar or so short of a Chipotle burrito, double the price of a standard HALF GALLON of Blue Bell at the grocery store, and enough to get you roughly two and a half million calories at Taco Bell. Plain and simple - it's too much. Yes, I get that this is seriously wonderful ice cream, and I get that it's made in front of you, but $7.00 is simply too much for what you get. No Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nUnf. The consistency is gelato without being gelato, and the flavor is pretty much unlike anything I've had elsewhere with respect to the density and the consistency. My salted caramel tasted as though I was actually eating spoonfuls of caramel, and that's in no way a bad thing. My cousin's mocha was equally good, and everyone else in my party was raving about their flavors. I don't know how they do it, but this is seriously some of the best ice cream you can get. Dual Stars Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nIf I could afford it?

It was a bit after 10 pm on a sat night and there was a short line of about 8 ppl waiting at smitten. The line moved quickly. We ordered two smalls, mint chocolate chip and salted caramel, both in waffle cones. The total was around $13. Portions were pretty big but pricey for 2 mini scoops of ice cream. \n\nBeing able to watch the ice cream ingredients being frozen with liquid nitrogen was pretty neat. \n\nWe got our ice cream in about 5 min. It seems like each flavor is made at a different station and made to order, which seems pretty inefficient once the line gets longer. The mint chocolate chip was light and refreshing but not very flavorful. On the other hand, the salted caramel was very flavorful and a bit too sweet. My fav is still scoop in Palo Alto. The waffle cones here were a bit on the thicker side and did not taste as fresh as the ones at scoop. The overall ambiance was very cute and there was even a smitten alley for additional outdoor space to enjoy your treat.", "author": "Yin H."}

We decided to go back and if it wasn't for this issue, we would have been repeat customers but we will not be going back.  \n\nUpdate: I had actually written this on Wednesday and I had received an email back that day.  He said that he will notify finance.  It's now Friday and still nothing.  At this point, it's just bad business.\n\nWe made an online pickup order last Saturday at the Pac Heights location.  The online system did not email me a receipt, nothing in the spam folder, so luckily I had taken a screenshot of the order info.  When we arrived for the pickup, they did not have any knowledge of our order so they brought over their district manager.  From the conversation they were having, we were not the first with this issue.  The district manager told us that they can't give us the ice cream and we have to pay for it.  I said that my debit card was already charged, not pending.  He said that we don't have your money so I can't just give you the ice cream.  Just pay for it and if the charge is still on your statement in a few days, just call me and I will credit you back.  He gave me his biz card and we did what he asked.\n\nIn case he thought that we made an order to the wrong store, I also mentioned that when you do an online order, pickup is available for the Pac Heights location only.  It's clearly on the website but he said you can make an online pickup order at all locations.  He clearly knows what he's talking about.\n \nOn Monday, I checked my statement and I'm still double charged so I sent him an email with all the info on my online order.  Crickets.... \nTuesday, I left him a voicemail requesting a callback.  Crickets... \nIt's now Wednesday and I just sent him a follow up email.\n \nAll this hassle for $11.  Why not just give us the ice cream in the first place and say that if the charge does not go through, please enjoy and it's on us.

We both had the mojito with strawberry sauce which came out to be $5-6 each (extra $1 for the additional sauce). The mojito with strawberry sauce was delicious. Their ice cream is made with liquid nitrogen right in front of you. It's kind of interesting to see how their ice cream is made.

They also use really good ingredients to make some really good ice cream with some different flavor combinations (though not Humphry Sloecome different). This location is also really nicely decorated and has a nice outdoor, dog friendly (it's not very large, so probably small dog friendly) patio. It's fun to read about the design of the ice cream machine, ingredients, and the history of Smitten. The original machine was carried on a wagon and the wagon theme is shown throughout the location. The ice cream is really super smooth and tasty. You're paying for the uniqueness, so it's not cheap. $5 for two small scoops or $6 for three is a bit pricey, but given its uniqueness and quality it's worth it. I'll go every once in a while and I'll probably take people from out of town here to see it. I'll also probably take them to Humphry Sloecome to try their really unique flavors.", "author": "Scott L."}

I couldn't just let that one go by, I don't care how many other people may have used that as their opening tag line in their Yelp review. It was a bit much ($5 for some small scoops) however the ice cream itself was delicious. I ordered the cookie dough and it was so good with little pieces of malt heaven. I also had a taste of the creamy vanilla and I will definitely be coming back for that. I LOVED the freezing with liquid nitrogen and how each ice cream scoop is made with love and made fresh.

I had it in a waffle cone. The ice cream was unbelievably smooth, and awesomely filled with coffee flavor. Plus. the waffle cone actually added to the flavor of the ice cream... gave it a crunchy, caramel-ly dimension. Definitely recommend eating it in a cone.\n\nI did have a spoonful of my friend's TCHO chocolate, and I liked it. You could taste that it was TCHO (*if you're familiar with TCHO, that is) and like my ice cream, it was very smooth. I'd say that one would be best in a sundae, with other toppings to complement it. \n\nThey had a few other flavors I wanted to try, but (again) due to the small (i.e. individual) batch method of making ice cream, I wasn't really able to do so. That's the one drawback -- you want to try more than one flavor, and you either can't because you can't taste it/can't wait for multiple flavors to be made for you, or you have to wait for each item in a \"tasting flight\" to come out.\n\nIt *is* a fun experience, though. And, all the staff were very friendly. Shop is clean and bright. And, given its proximity to Pizzeria Delfina and Sift, it's like you have a little birthday party on one block. A pricy, sophisticated adult birthday party.", "author": "Tami S."}

The best part is that you can actually watch the liquid nitrogen work its magic while you wait. It's an interesting little tidbit that really adds another dimension of fun to this shop.\nI got the cookie dough with pretzels and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a bit too sweet and didn't have as much of the pretzels as I thought it would, but it was a great option. My boyfriend got the chocolate in a waffle bowl and he said it was great. I think Smitten's chocolate ice cream definitely took the cake.

Unfortunately, the way they have the register set up makes it super congested even if only a few people are in the store.

They change the flavors regularly, based on what is in season, so I think I'll be back very, very soon as all of the choices tonight sounded amazing. Great job, Smitten - you have a new loyal customer!", "author": "J K."}

They did run out of the cookie dough which was a bummer, but it was still good. The best part is that it's organic! Will definitely be back!", "author": "Oksana E."}

You can tell it is made with fresh ingredients. And the cones are fantastic. It's not cheap, but in comparison to other places in SF, it's not overpriced either.\n\nSmitten also has  fun vibe going on and is very clean. The one in Pacific Heights has a nice little outdoor area, as well.\n\nToday when I went, they were definitely having some service issues and they ended up messing up my order a few times. You could tell they were sincerely sorry and I appreciated how the staff went out of their way to correct everything. However, when my friends and I walked into the little outdoor patio area to eat our ice cream, a woman was painting a side of it and rudely told us that she \"needed to work...\" and that we needed to get out of the way. After waiting 30 minutes for ice cream, I was a little mad about being shooed out.", "author": "Lynn A."}

Sadly, thanks to shockingly bad customer service I just walked out a frustrated customer.  At five dollars for a small serving you think they would try to show some \"appreciation\" for their customers.  It probably took 10 min. for my ice cream - and not because they were making it or there was anyone in front of me.  Two of the \"baristas \", as they call them, were happily chatting with each other.  The guy at the counter was spending more time chatting up a girl he found attractive than taking people's orders.  A couple of us stood there for 5 min. - with not one bit of activity relating to making our ice cream, no nitrogen being injected into the mixers, no mixers spinning, no one pouring anything in the mixers.  They were all too busy not doing their jobs to make some ice cream.  Bring on the robot ice cream makers!!", "author": "David M."}

Ice cream is made right in front of you with ingredients that you can pronounce. It's the craft beer of ice cream! So delicious and creamy and not too sweet. Check it out!", "author": "Robin C."}

They don't \"make\" your actual ice cream while you are waiting.  Second, you can't have toppings on a cone.  Why?  You wait at least 10 minutes for the inefficient staff to scoop your ice cream.  Our server was trying to use a flimsy plastic cup to hold a waffle cone while he tried to add a second scoop.  Ever heard of cone holders?  Smitten people, try checking out a Baskin Robbins.  The ice cream... OK but not worth the wait or the price.", "author": "Bill S."}

Only downside is that they change their flavors constantly and came here the other day craving it and they weren't serving this flavor. Also, for the people complaining about the price - yes it's expensive for an ice cream cone but you're paying for a fresh batch of literally made to order ice cream. If you're looking for a deal then go buy a cheapo pint across the street at Mollie Stones. This place lives up to the hype.", "author": "Alexis T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-19", "description": "Ridiculously overpriced, takes a really long time, and you don't get much for your money. The chocolate and salted caramel are good. The strawberry white balsamic tastes like tangy frozen yogurt and I did not like it. The mint chip tastes like water that has a fresh mint leaf in it and has some how been made into ice cream - very watered down mint flavor and can't really taste the chocolate chips either. The waffle cones are good. Except for the chocolate and salted caramel, I wouldn't really call the texture creamy. More like airy. Overall, not my favorite ice cream but it's the only ice cream in this hood.", "author": "Holly M."}
