I was worried the condensed milk was accidentally excluded, but it was added inside and tasted great. \n\nThough the meat in Alex's pad gra prow wasn't prepared the way he hoped (he thought it would be minced and didn't check the description in the menu lol), he quickly devoured his dish.

A bit of spaz, I parked at my favorite spot on 7th Ave, and T is waiting. Says to me, \"Hello?!\" A bit hesitant, I've been gone for a bit. I unload my stuff, and say back, \"I need food.\" 8 PM Monday Inner Richmond is a ghost town, even quieter than Tokyo on a weekend day. Put on my new bright orange boots, and in my ever so vibrant wrap dress and sky blue lace stockings, I look like a colored rainbow bunny hopping on the street. T does not mind. \"Want ramen?\" T asks. I say, \"No way in hell. I'm Japanese-food out, just returned from Tokyo, remember?. How about southeastern Asian food?\"\n\nWe start to walk towards Clement on 7th until T stops me midway. \"I think Thai Time is closed.\" T knows that's my favorite Thai place by Clement as of late. At that moment, I was indeed thinking about that restaurant. A bit disappointed, but still I continue walking. T makes a left on Geary, and there it it, another Thai place and it's actually open.  Brightly lit, with yellow walls and kid's drawing as wall art. \n\nI learn quickly that the restaurant is named after their son, a cute boy prominently displayed on the front page of the menu, with the parents / owners. I figure those art work, might be his. \n\nA hard working couple, likely immigrants, finally opened a family business for their child, and named the restaurant after him, the menu comes with a story. So adorable. Gotta love that.\n\nI order spicy and sour noodle soup. I have been having a hankering for something way southern Asia than the northern Asia, which I had been at until a day ago. The noodle hit the spot. It took me instantly back to three years ago: it was a perfect summer night in Phuket, I was eating a bowl of Thai noodle soup by the beach, feet in the sand, alone, in a straw hat and bathing suit, I took my time sipping coconut juice out of a fresh coconut while pondered where life would take me next. \n\nBut T interrupts my thoughts by asking me what else I want to eat. I have no idea. So T orders the curry vegetable with tofu, which is not what I have chosen but it is perhaps one of the better ones I've ever had. It's not too dense - even though it is made of coconut cream vs. milk. It's fragrant and filled with nice veggies which is a much better option than its curry meat cousins at 8 O'Clock in the evening. T knows what I like to eat and we like to eat similar things. Good dining partners are hard to find, you know?\n\nThere is only one other table filled with three young men, who have their photos taken by the restaurant staff, presumably the mother of Tawan. They look happy and are delighted with their dishes.\n\nWe sit side by side, eat, and look out to Geary. It's a bit of dead. It's dark. It's not a happening neighborhood, but the same could be said about the entire city of San Francisco on a Monday evening. No one goes out. It's part of the charm, one may say.\n\nWe finish the food quietly. I feel more like myself after the meal. It's exactly what the doctor ordered.\n\n\"Welcome home.

Since my favorite Thai place only delivers for dinner, the roommate and I decided to try Tawan's. We ordered via GrubHub and got the following:\n\nPad thai (no peanuts) $9.95 - Very bland. And the noodles were kinda mushy and overcooked. \n\nSom tum salad (no peanuts) $8.95 - Another bland dish. It had some kick since we ordered it spicy, but it didn't have much of any other notes to balance it out.\n\nTom yum gung soup ($10.95) - Was spicy but not much else. I wanted that mixture of sour, sweet, savory and spicy, but this was another dish that was just bland.\n\nGaeng ga-ree gai curry ($8.95) - This dish was okay. The curry was a little runny, but at least it had some flavor.\n\nPumpkin curry ($8.95) - The best dish! I normally never order pumpkin curry since I don't like pumpkin, but this had all the flavors a good curry should have. A little lighter in consistency, but great flavor.\n\nSteamed brown rice ($2) and Steamed jasmine rice ($1.50) - I ordered the brown rice for my curry.

Two items, a fish dish and mango sticky rice. My estimated time for pick up with roughly 20 minutes. So far so good. I arrive at the restaurant about 25 minutes later and I walk in asking for pick up. The lady at the counter is scrambling around and finally finds my order. She told me that they are out of the mango sticky rice (thanks for the heads up). \n\nSo I said fine, I'll have some steamed rice. Then she tries to push appetizers, desserts, drinks, and more rice on to me. I politely refused. A couple minutes later she comes back and says are you sure? Why not some roti? Some Thai iced tea? Again, I said no thanks. One minute later, she asks AGAIN, and I said look, can I just get the difference between the mango sticky rice and the regular steamed rice? She said no. It's not possible. I have to contact Grubhub. So I told her fine, I'll call when I get home, I'm sure it's an easy fix. \n\nAbout 5 minutes passes by, she comes over and ask me if I had called Grubhub? I told her I will call her when I get home. It's a little loud in here. Another 10 minutes goes by, I ask her where is my food? She told me the kitchen had JUST started cooking it. She told me that her \"system\" was not working and the order \"just came in.\" Even though I had been waiting at the restaurant waiting for nearly 20 minutes. \n\nFinally, after 10 more minutes, the food was ready. The whole ordeal took over an hour. But hey, at least I have my food now and I can enjoy some delicious Thai food that Yelp is raving about. I get home, open my food, and there are hair follicles CRUSTED on my fish. \n\nThis restaurant was not equipped to handle the amount of traffic on a Monday evening. There were dirty dishes on tables waiting to be cleared off. The kitchen could not output the food in a timely manner (although one hour for something that takes less than 10 minutes to cook is ridiculous). The cooks handling the food did not wear proper sanitary equipment. \n\nOverall, this was a complete and utter waste of 1.5 hours for me. Do yourself a favor, skip this one.

I got home, opened the crab cakes, went to grab one and *squish*. So oily it ran off the crab cake when I touched it. Gross! Ok, NBD, mistakes happen, so I took it right back. They refused to give me my money back. I've been going to this joint for seven years! I've never sent food back. I've never been anything but a gracious, well tipping neighbor. But they didn't care.

Pad Thai at other Thai restaurants were better. The tofu satay with peanut sauce was bland so we asked for some chili sauce, which they carried. What really disappointed us most of all was this behavior of the waitress upon receiving our payment.

It appears to be a family run establishment.  The waitress who was preparing green beans in a back table stopped, greeted me and offered me a seat and a menu.  I picked out a noodle dish right away, but I pondered among the appetizers menu until one caught my eye and shouted back at me.  It had BACON and shrimp and it was deep fried!  \n\nI loved the embroidered table cloth which had a design featuring the seven legged \"Squidy\", but the food arrived too quickly for me to take a photo of it.  Goong Gra-Borg is a rather simple appetizer pairing a tail-on shrimp and a piece of fatty bacon side by side, wrapping both together in an egg roll wrapper and deep frying it to golden perfection.  Served with some shaved carrots and a sweet and sour sauce that was neither too sweet nor too sour this appetizer is meant to be eaten hot from the fryer while the flavors of shrimp and the bacon are still sizzling.  \n\nMy noodle dish arrived almost simultaneously with the appetizer, but I'm so glad I chose to eat the fried dish first.  The amount of gravy was a bit overwhelming on the Chicken Lard-Nar noodle dish, but I liked the vibrant green of the two types of broccoli and it appeared that all of the chicken meat was skinless chicken breasts.  The clump of pan-fried rice noodles sat in the center of the dish buried beneath the chicken and the broccoli.  Some of the noodles were a bit charred, but the dish was nicely seasoned and the gravy wasn't as sweet as I had feared.\n\nIt was a filling lunch, and I'm sure I'll be back one day to tried some more items on their menu.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

I decided on the spring rolls as my add-on, which was pretty good but nothing to rave about. The sauce it came with unfortunately was not a traditional peanut sauce that I was expecting, rather it was quite tangy.\n\nOnto the pad thai... Well, I've honestly tasted nothing like it before, and that's not necessarily a good thing. It was kind of sweet, and had a hint of coconut which usually does not belong in the pad thai flavor group.

At first she thinks I'm saying \"satay\" not saut\u00e9ed, so we go around for awhile until she understands my order and asks if I want rice with my veggies (I decline but point is she gets what i'm trying to order).  After quite some time I get a call saying it's taking longer than expected but the food is on its way.  Food arrives, driver leaves, and I quickly discover I got soup and tofu satays (huh..?)  I call and after much back and forth am told there is nothing they can do since they are closed.  They offer to credit me but I say I would prefer the driver to come back and refund me the cash I paid him.  NOW they offer to re-make the correct dish and send it to me. Ok fine I say.\n\nFast forward 20 minutes... at this point I've given the tofu sticks (which were dry and awful) to my roomies awaiting my veggies and the doorbell rings.  The driver hands me my food and demands the other dish back.  Um... I gave them to my roommates I explain, and he tells me that he'll have to charge me for the new dish in that case.  Are you kidding me???  I refuse and tell him if the restaurant has an issue to call me.  He gives me a hard time for another few minutes and finally leaves.  \n\nI finally have my food now.  We've established the tofu satays were pretty gross. Veggies are fairly tasty but an extremely small portion.  Soup is bad.  REAL BAD.

I couldn't believe it!  \n\nAfter I angrily walked out of the door, I had realized they had packed my noodles + soup in the same container!  WHO DOES THAT??? It takes 20-25 minutes to get home, and they couldn't pack them separately?  Did they think I was stupid to not realized the noodles were going to expand and leave me with no soup.  I was frustrated, but I was starved.  Hence, I did not mind eating in my car.  BUT they didn't pack me utensils!  What's this????  \n\nI am unsure if I want to support this type of business again.

Originally we were going to cook but he got off work late so we decided to eat out. Avoiding the popular v-day digs, we opted for a neighborhood joint hoping there would be no lines. Luckily when we arrived, there were two empty tables. I love eating Thai food from time to time and I'm not picky, but this place blew me away! Up to this point, Thai food I've had in SF is decent, but not great. I thought nothing could beat the $5 menu at King of Thai in North Beach-- until I came here.\n\nWe ordered the pumpkin curry with pork, and decided to be adventurous with two other dishes that we've never tried before: thung thong and larb-nar with beef. The curry was mild enough but had a good kick to it, without being too spicy. The spiciness also didn't mask the flavors of the ingredients and the coconut milk- very well balanced. Larb-nar is a great dish similar to pad see ew but in a light-colored gravy broth with plenty of greens. It seemed healthier than eating pad see ew, which is usually pan friend with LOTS of oil.\n\nMy favorite dish was the thung thong- a deep fried large wonton-ish thing filled with ground chicken and curried potatoes and carrots. I don't know why I never discovered this appetizer at other Thai restaurants! Even the leftover was scrumptious the next day after my boyfriend popped it in the toaster oven.\n\nEverything we ordered was delicious and I am looking forward to coming back here to try other items on their menu. Besides the amazing food, another thing that makes this places stand out is the cute homey atmosphere. The good prices combined with the quality of the food, along with great service, earns this place a solid 5 stars in my book!", "author": "Melody C."}

Maybe I didn't order the right stuff. \n\nWe had the Tom yum soup, beef satay, chicken satay, Thai fried rice, and combo sour noodle soup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZX5XUU9z1nmoUyiuPtjSLg?select=Wn5fzqUQ7pZaUxJ8g28L-w The soup was quite enjoyable and not over-sweetened but I think it could use more lemongrass, galangal, and tamarind. Both satays were kind of tough. The beef one had really good flavor but was a pain to chew. The chicken was kind of on the dry side and didn't have much flavor besides the curry powder covering the outside. Fried rice was pretty good...flavors were well-balanced and the rice was soft but not mushy. The least enjoyable (actually I thought it was disgusting...) was the noodle soup. The broth was just...I don't know. It was like chicken broth mixed with a ladle of ketchup. The flavor and consistency was very unpalatable. The combination of ingredients were okay though the noodle does expand very quickly and it's difficult to try to eat it before it becomes a goopie goop.\n\nService was minimal (not rude) but fast.

Customer service is a huge part of my reviews so I had to knock it down to a 2.\n\n+: The food was gooood! I loved everything. The pad thai is one of the best that I have ever had. The fried rice was yummmy! The pumpkin curry was goood! \n\n-: Portions are smaller than other Thai restaurants. So the pad thai came, then the curry came, and we were sitting there for like 10 minutes just looking at the curry and wondering \"where the fuck is the fried rice at?\". Then the waitress came out and said some shit that I do not remember and I asked her \"where is the rice? did you forget to write it down?\". She didn't even apologize, she kept on blaming me. She forgot to write down the seafood fried rice when I repeated it like 3 times and I pointed at it on the menu and saying \"I want this\", this bitch told me that I didn't say anything.

If you are looking for high end cuisine, go elsewhere.  What Tawan's offers, however, is very tasty and reasonably priced Thai style food.  I have tried a number of different dishes from here, and I have not let been down yet.  This is a place I like to go at least twice per month, though I usually pick it up to go.\n\nAtmosphere: The restaurant is very small, bright, and full of fun drawings from the owner's son.  It has a 'cute' atmosphere for lack of a better word.\n\nService: Always friendly servers, usually one person working in the front.  They have been very accommodating to my needs. It is usually not too busy, as most orders seem to be delivery or pickup.\n\nFood: As I said before, it is very consistently tasty.  There seems to be some variation on dishes based on who is cooking (my guess).  Some times ingredients may change slightly, but I have never minded.\n\nRecommendations: Try the Pad See Ew w/ Beef.  I get it virtually every time I go.  They make it better than any other Richmond district restaurant I have tried, which is many.  The Pumpkin Curry is also another favorite, but it seems to vary less restaurant to restaurant.  All of the appetizers are quite good, and the eggrolls are large and seem fresh.  If you want to try something different get the Thai Beef Jerky.  It is unlike any other appetizer I have had. Note: Their Pad Thai is a bit different than other places- it is more wet and saucy.  It is still quite tasty, but be ready for a different variation than you may be used to.\n\nDelivery is prompt, and the driver(s) are always extremely nice.

There are Thai restaurants EVERYWHERE. The Richmond is no exception, with Thai places dotting both the residential and commercial streets. I have a few choices within my radius, but I probably come here the most often because I ride the Geary bus and it's just easiest.\n\nI will now insert the \"I want to like this place more\" cliche, and here's why. I do like it for its cute background story--if you've skimmed any of its other reviews, you'll find details on the origin of the restaurant's name and hand-drawn logos in the founders' son. The tiny space also has a nice touch of whimsy with its yellow paint and miscellaneous magnets and accessories hanging around for sale.\n\nThat being said, the food here is juuuust a scoach pricier than other Thai restaurants of comparable size and quality. I guess I don't mind it too much, since clearly it's a family-run biz and it's a tough economy out there. However, if Tawan's wants to stay in line with its competition (Thai Time, King of Thai, Thai Noodle Jump hahaha), they might not want to depend on the fact that all of its customers are lazy like me and return primarily due to convenience. Or maybe they can rely on that. I dunno.\n\nFinally, a word about their Som Tum salad. It had a great flavor until I realized that it was laced with those little frozen shrimps... you know, the kind that come in your Cup 'o Noodle? It was kind of gross, to be honest, and dissatisfying for the price. Other than that, though, their curries are decent.", "author": "Kate V."}

I wasn't aware that the Inner Richmond was the spot for some good Asian flavors. This is how we stumbled upon Tawan's. In the prior reviews the references to the children's book style menu is what really peaked our interest so we stopped by.\n\nIt's a small place but comfortable and it definitely centers on the idea of promoting Thai children's art. There are some fun works displayed on the walls and the menu is like fun art in it as well. My one beef with the place is that the menu is probably too large. There are TONS of options.\n\nAnywho, to the food, well we ordered #35 Pumpkin Curry and #55 Salmon Red Curry. This is my first time having pumpkin curry and it was nice. A more velvety curry with some nice sweet notes. I don't think it will replace normal curry in my books but I was glad I tried it. I will definitely have it again near Halloween for shits and gigs..\n\nThe curry sauce for the Salmon was outstanding. Probably one of my more favorite Red Curries right now and that curry alone makes Tawan's my favorite Thai place in SF thus far. Ohh yea, and the Salmon was nice to, more on the fishier end of flavor, but I like it.\n\nThe waitress was great also. Overall I will definitely come back!", "author": "Nik B."}

Tawan is a very small Thai restaurant located on Geary in the Inner Richmond. Seating is limited, but there was only one other table seated so it wasn't a problem. They do offer \"free\" delivery for those who don't want to leave the confines of their couches like myself sometimes. \n\nWhat stroke the most about Tawan Thai was the decor. Within the menu and on the walls they had little illustrations of random things. It didn't matter that the pictures looked like they were drawn by a 5 year old, because it was still neat and interesting to look at. They even sold little trinkets nearby the cash register. Anyways, that was all that really stood out about the restaurant. Well, something did stand out about the food... and it was the blandness. Everything just had a smidgen of flavor, literally. The stuffed wings were crisp and plump, but the lack of flavor killed it for me. When it came down to the salad, it seemed like everything was just thrown in a pan or boiled, plated, and then sprinkled with some lemon on top. The Pad Thai barely had any peanut flavor or sweetness to it. Perhaps it was late in the day and they just ran out of every seasoning? The most promising dish was one of the specials. The last dish we tried was silver noodles with snow peas, mushrooms, something else, with a green curry mixed throughout. This dish definitely had some flavor and a little heat to it. \n\nWould I go back? probably not... time to move on and discover something else that tantalizes my taste buds. Perhaps I already exhausted my options as far as new places. Maybe I should just stick to my tried and true.", "author": "Steven T."}

Both were really good (particularly the eggplant that almost had a roasted taste to it - very good), but I think the salad was the highlight. \n\nThe only drawback to the evening was the wait. Sure we waited to get in, that's fine -- but after we were seated there was a veery long wait for the appetizer, and even longer wait between the appetizer and the main meal.

Years later and literally every single dish I've ordered has impressed, although we have fallen into a pretty set menu when we order: the Yum Sarm Sa Hai, Chicken Panang Curry, Guay Tiaw Gai Gra Praow (except when I can convince the bf that it just feels like more of a Pork Pad Kee Mao night--yum!), two Thai Iced Teas, white rice for four, and--on nights when we're feeling expecially crazy--the FBI.\n\nAll of this is ordered in delivery form only, for as much as I love this place, it's not the most conducive to dining in.  Although they do let you BYOAB (that's \"bring your own alcoholic beverage\") to enjoy with your dinner, and Tawan's cute artwork from years ago hangs on the walls--there's only a handful and tables and they're usually full, if not overflowing, around dinner time.\n\nOnly two complaints--they aren't open on Sundays (an especially good day for Thai) and the whole restaurant shuts down for a month or two every summer for a trip to the homeland.  This second one is not so much a complaint in and of itself--but those months usually perfectly coincide with when I want me some Tawan's the most...like right now...", "author": "Jasmine L."}

It's kind of easy to miss because it's so small and in a random location, but it's worth the circle around the block.\n\nI've always gotten some good dishes, but my friend ordered some sort of curry that looked like a big bowl of soup with bamboo, peppers and some measly slices of beef.  The bowl of rice that he ordered paled in comparison to the huge bowl of \"soup,\" so if you want to finish the soup/curry, you'll probably need two bowls of rice.\n\nTheir rice and noodle dishes (aka pad thai, pad see-ew, etc.) are all really good.  They ask you how spicy you want your food, and if you say \"spicy,\" you'll probably end up with a good dose of peppers.  If you're not used to spicy food, I recommend sticking with the mild or medium.\n\nOverall, A+ compared to Marnee Thai.  Less yuppie, more yummy.", "author": "Tori S."}

Technically, every place was a new place to eat, but my brother had already lived here for a few years, and I wanted to really impress him by finding a great restaurant that he hadn't tried yet.\n\nSomehow, I came across Tawan's.  I don't remember what I was doing, but there was a parking spot open right in front of it, and when I returned from whatever errand I was running, I saw the place, added more money to the meter, and ate lunch here.\n\nI knew my brother would appreciate the funny menus.  Actually, I didn't know he would appreciate them, but I figured he would like them if only because they were cheesy and/or dated and/or poorly constructed and/or poorly conceived and/or poorly executed.\n\nMy food came quickly, and it was really good.  All of this was adding up to a four-star experience.  (It was years before Yelp existed, but I *did* rate restaurants stars-wise long before Yelp existed, although I usually did so on a scale of 0 to 10 or 0 to 7 for some reason.)  Then it happened:  Tawan came in.\n\nAt the time, Tawan was an annoying middle schooler who went to school at the Catholic school across Geary from the restaurant.  As soon as this loud, demanding kid entered, the whole place changed.  The woman who had brought me my food made a big fuss about Tawan's appearance.  He took his seat at a prime table and spread out books and toys across its four-person surface.  (Mind you, the restaurant only has a few tables.)  He began making demands of the older woman and other workers, and they brought him food and drink.\n\nI assumed the older woman was his grandmother, but maybe it is his mother.  In any case, Tawan played the part of the pygmy dictator very well.  His middle-school presence also bumped this place up to five stars.\n\nI bet he's a teenager by now.  If so, he's probably actually doing work at his namesake.  Maybe he's even a lowly delivery boy.  I hope not.

We taste food at a variety of restaurants and then write them checks for over $600 a week worth of food if we are happy with the fare. When we sat down, we made it very clear that we only want small tasting of about 7 items to see which are best for our customers. \n\nWe waited an incredibly long time to be served, despite the three people at the table next to us making the net sum of the  patrons 5 people. \n\nThe food was decent, but not amazing. Certainly good enough to use for our catering job though, considering the price point.\n\nAt the end We thanked them and as we were walking out, they waved a check for over $50 to us! Thats tough to do for 2 people when the average price of a dish is around $7! FYI: no booze or other extras purchased to jack up the tab.\n\nWhen I approached the young man serving me about this, he told me that he had to charge me and that the owners were not there. I agreed to pay, if it would be a deposit for the big delivery. He said yes. As I walked through the kitchen to the bathroom, I noticed that the woman in the kitchen cooking was also the woman in the picture of their cute menu. The picture of the owners.\n\nThey charged us full price for dishes that were sample portions, and reneged on their offer to have us in for a complimentary tasting. \n\nOf course, they didn't respond to me and never called back to set up the food delivery. I can't say I am sorry to have spent my $600+ at another restaurant for my clients this week: Teriyaki house of Brisbane. Very nice, and not crooks!", "author": "Jud Y."}

The last time I was there a woman came in by herself, sat down, and looked like she was going to burst into tears before she even ordered. In fact she literally ran out of the restaurant before the waitress could get to her. A half an hour later she came back to see if she'd left her book at her table and when she couldn't find it I thought she was going to fall over and die right there in the middle of the place.\n\nMy friends and I all agreed that if you're having a shitty day, you should just get takeout from Tawan's and not sit there by yourself unless you want the rest of the restaurant to speculate on why you're so depressed.

They get it all so right, it actually tastes like food in Thailand.  Love their papaya salad, soups, curries, everything is yummmy.  This is a family business that cares about serving you quality food.  They even deliver in the area.  Most of the people giving this place poor review don't have a clue what they are talking about.  For example, Pad Thai is not supposed to come out spicy; instead, Thai people add their preferred spice level on top with chili flakes and such.

Judging from the outside you wouldn't think this place will serve quality Thai food, but the food (and prices) were excellent!  The menu offered plenty of curry, seafood, and noodle dishes, but I don't think you can go wrong with any of them.  \n\nWe started off with the egg roll appetizer-- freshly fried and very hot; the Gaeng Khiaw-warn-- chicken in green curry and coconut milk with bamboo shoot, bell pepper and fresh basil-- which wasn't too soupy because there was so much substance to it;  the Pad Makheur Yao--  sauteed calamari with eggplant, chili, onion, bell pepper and basil-- I loved the eggplant and the calamari pieces were huge; and the Lard-nar--  pan-fried noodle with gravy sauce, broccoli and sliced chicken.  This was plenty for 3 people, and we even had leftovers for to-go.  \n\nI sat facing the kitchen and it seems like the cook carefully and freshly prepare the dishes as the order is taken.  Being the observant person that I am, I noticed that they received many delivery calls.  So along with taking care of the dine-in customers, they also have to prepare the delivery orders.  Which probably explained why it took awhile for the waiter to bring us the check.  It didn't help that there was only one waiter.  Nonetheless, the affordable, succulent dishes made up for it.  \n\nOnly down side: it's a tiny place, so it's not recommended for big groups.", "author": "Lisa C."}

The food at Marnee might be a little bit better (barely) but the ambiance at Tawan's is better so they equal out.\n\nThe decor is so damn cute, I can't get over. Quite hip I have to say. The yellow walls with Tawan's drawings framed provides a very happy feeling. Even better because it's not some hipsters trying to look cool but drawings from a real kid.  Plus the place is small, only 6 tables. \n\nThe waitress is always unfailingly nice; water and tea are constantly filled. The food is pretty awesome, flavors are great. The fried catfish in red curry with lightly fried basil, wow. Their curry is pretty heavy on the coconut cream, just how I like it. One of my companions loved the fact that they service fresh coconut juice, in a coconut! \n\nAnd they deliver! It's only 4 blocks from my house but on game nights, delivery can be crucial.

My roommate recommended it to me and her approval of the restaurant didn't fail me when I tried their food. \n\nTawan's is a cute little restaurant where their menus are covered with drawings made by a child and their tables are sewn with similar pictures from the menus. Looking at the menu I thought, \"damn, I was never that artistic when I was child\". Nonetheless, it was small and fitting for a cozy, at home, type of meal. The food is light and doesn't overload you with grease. The best part is that you don't have to chug multiple glasses of water from the large amounts of MSG that most Asian restaurants put in your food. Another good thing is that it's reasonable priced. Want to expand your horizon and try something other than the over-glorified King of Thai? Go for Tawan's and be inspired to open your own restaurant when you have kids and they decide to doodle during dinner.", "author": "Jensine R."}

I thought it was a wonderful concept to have the kid's drawings put into the menu, framed on the wall and even put as part of the table cloth.  It really did feel like a mom & pop restaurant, but one of the highest quality.\n\nPlus when the actual Tawan (now almost a decade older than when he originally drew the pictures) came in, my wife and I huddled together, began whispering and made furtive glances over like he was some kind of celebrity.  Brilliant!\n\nAnyway, we were not in anyway disappointed in our food.  My wife stuck the the basics:  pad thai.  I picked a dish with eggplant and chicken that was amazing.

Unfortunately, this was the only impressive thing about my experience. The Pad See Ew I ordered had a good sauce to noodle ratio, but the pork was super dry and stringy and the noodles had been burnt so the whole meal sort of fell apart.

Even during the worst of the recent/current recession, this place was/is packed every night. My favorites: salmon curry with a pinch of spicy + fried rice w/vegetables (Total: $24.75 + tip). Sometimes I add a side of something green (broccoli sp?) w/garlic + scoop(s) of coconut ice cream. (If you can't eat spicy food, make sure you repeat that until the, mostly, Thai waiters understand. No spice or spice is about your choices.)  Kind, smart people who create a cozy atmosphere. No flat screens on the wall here! Parking's easy along Geary w/o too much effort. It's first-come, first served. Mostly busy by 7:30 p.m., but not much wait. Take out and delivery (if close by) too. After dinner, enjoy a 1-block walk across Geary to Clement St., turn right a few blocks for Green Apple Books or a stroll or turn left at Clement for Walgreens and sports bars with those big flat screens (if there's a game you just gotta see).

My friends have been asking me why I haven't reviewed it seeing as how this is the first place I always suggest when they want to go out for dinner or take some friends to a good Thai restaurant.   Of course there are many good Thai restaurants in the city, but this one is above all the absolute best.  \n\nFirst, the restaurant is named after Tawan, the owners' son.  When I first started eating here, he was a little guy whose drawings covered the walls and menu.  Now you can buy his art, framed or on a t-shirt, and he is nowhere near as little as he once was.  He goes on the deliveries now.  \n\nSecond, the service at Tawan's is awesome.  They are so friendly and helpful that it hurts.   When you come in, they immediately say hello with a genuine smile and sit you right away (if you are so lucky to show up when they are not full).  Because they do not sell any beer wine or liquor, you can easily walk the 10 steps back to the corner store for some beer or wine and bring it back in.  I've brought 40's in and it's been totally cool.  \n\nThird,  the food is delicious.  I can't even being to go into deta- okay fine.  When I order for delivery or pick up (sadly I can only pick up now because I live in the sunset) I have the old standby order of Pad Sub Nok with beef, which is ground beef sauteed with julienned green beans and all kinds of good spice, the panaeng curry with chicken, and usually the Thung Thong as an appetizer.  That has all kinds of good spices and textures to it.  \n\nThey offer different levels of spice.  If you like spicy food, go medium spicy.  The spicy is really spicy.  it's manageable to those who like spicy food, however, if you think you like spicy food but have never been truly tested, be careful.", "author": "Charley B."}

They did not seem to have a delivery minimum, but the woman on the phone told me I had to order \"more than 2 items.\" It seemed expensive - $25 for 3 vegetarian dishes - but maybe my brain is just too lazy to do the math.\n\nFOOD: I ordered three different dishes (why so much? because I had to, see above!), all vegetarian: Pad See-Ew, Gaing Ga-ree (yellow curry) and Pad Prik Khing.\n\nPROS: The Pad See-Ew was good. It wasn't too greasy (rare for SF Thai take-out) and the flavor was yummy. This is my favorite dish so this is the most important one to get an edible version of. The Pad Prik Khing was okay - I liked the baby corn in it!\n\nCONS: The yellow curry was disgusting. Usually it's a sweet, silky, coconut flavor with turmeric and coriander, wrapped around chunks of potato and carrot. This one tasted predominantly of the rank curry powder they sell pre-mixed in the spice section of the supermarket and was gritty, to boot! I wonder if someone knocked over the spice jar into my order? I almost didn't want to eat this, but by morning I was hungry enough to just wolf it down. The Pad Prik King was greasy (although I've never had this dish not floating in red grease) and not flavorful enough to counteract the grease.\n\nSUMMARY: I would maybe order from here again, if I knew I wanted a non-greasy Pad See-ew, and I had no desire for curry.

When I called it was clear they were busy because I was on hold for a long time. Even after they took me off hold and started to take my order they kept interrupting me and asking me to hold on. At one point I said, \"Are you too busy? Should I call a different restaurant?\" They assured me they were not. I placed my order and they said it would arrive in 45 min. About 70 min later I called them and they said, \"It's almost ready. It'll be there in about 40 min.\" When I expressed shock they said, \"Sorry, we're really busy.\" They offered no remedy or compensation at all so I cancelled my order. If they had simply told me at the beginning that the order would take close to two hours, or if they had made any gestures to compensate me for the delay, I would not be writing this review.", "author": "Helena E."}

We went at 8:30 there was a party of eight at another table and our party of three. Not a lot of people. The server made us wait twenty minutes to order. She had a rude attitude when she spoke to us. She made no apologizes that our food took 40 minutes to get to our table. The food was amazing of course but the service was horrible. We paid the bill and proceeded to leave when the server runs out the door askin for more tip. Upon telling her how bad the service was I gave her more tip out of pity to the chefs and cooks in the kitchen because the horrible service we experienced was not their fault. Don't expect great tip if you didn't provide great service. Probably won't go back there until they get a new server.", "author": "Marc a."}

There is only one waiter and she happens to be the sweetest waiter who always remembers the regulars that come in and welcomes all in such a friendly, warm manner. The main dish I always get is the Thai Fried Rice (beef). The seasoning they put is to die for. Definitely beats King of Thai's because it leaves my mouth fully satisfied with its authentic taste and savoring flavor. The red curry and green curry is also good as well.", "author": "mae e."}

They first weren't going to delivery it because the ave i was on i need to spend atleast 10more dollars.They said the min for 25ave and up is around 30bucks.WTF that pretty high to have since my house is a 3min drive.Anyways they said they would let me slide with 20dollars this time.\nSo they told me 45mins max before my food would get here.Took an hour and 10mins.But my food was still warm and my dessert was still cold and the hard rain outside i let it slide.\nThe food is medicore and the portions are not big.I hate 2 dinners to feel full and no I'm not a fast ass I'm a 145lbs and 5'11 close to a stick.The pad Thai was alright Ive had better.The dessert sucked Ive ordered fried banana with honey from other Thai restaurants and its great there, but it was nasty i think they forgot the honey.The ice cream was good.But overall this place is overpriced and their min for delivery suck.Yes i know they need to have them because of gas.But the Thai place up one block told me 15buck min to bring it out to me.\nOverall i will not be ordering from here.I would go to my normal Thai place but its all the way in the sunset.\n+for decent food\n+ice cream that I've been craving", "author": "Jonathan M."}

I used to love King of Thai (on Clement) and Thai Noodle Jump (on 6th and Balboa), until I tried Tawan's delicious menu. Tawan's is the best, hands down. Get the Pumpkin Curry/Red Curry extra spicy style, and try some Tom-Yum Noodle Soup also extra spicy. Tawan's does not disappoint. Try their roti (Thai pancake) too, it is sweet and perfect for dunking in the curry. Also if you go here, try something new that you wouldn't normally try; stretch your wings because Tawan's cooks with love. Also, if you are new to this place try being friendly and not stuck-up, then you are bound to receive excellent service like me and my lady did! We got free Roti on the house!

I wanted to take her to something other than OSHA or other popular places around here. I had called earlier to make reservations but they said it wasn't busy. We arrived and were seated immediately! I wanted to try something different than what I am used to so I ordered an appetizer, Thep Sa-Wei which is a crispy crepe filled w/ ground shrimp, ground chicken, grated coconut meat, ground peanut tofu and scallions. The rest of the dishes were excellent although the Hot n' Sour soup we ordered was a little too spicy even for medium.

As others have mentioned, the owners' son, Tawan, contributed the endearing drawings on the wall and menu; our favorite was \"Squidy\" the Squid.  (Tawan is now probably in his 20s, judging by a review posted on the wall of the restaurant.)  I've dined in the restaurant once and had food delivered once.  Both times, the food was good but not great.  They seem to have a somewhat spicier take on \"medium spicy\" than most Thai places I've been to around here, so next time I'll swallow my pride and order \"mild-to-medium.\"  The pad see ew is tasty and the cucumber salad is refreshing.

The food is pretty authentic and very tasty, and the setting is intimate. It's some of the best Thai food I've had in SF - on a par with Thep Prahnom and Marnee Thai.

The only problem is that they close for 1 month of the year because the family goes back to Thailand. Kind of annoying, but it also gives it more character.
