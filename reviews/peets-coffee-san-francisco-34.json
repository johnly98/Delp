She seemed to be half-listening, so I repeated the order after she charged my credit card. \n\nInstead of mixing the two 1/2-half pounds evenly in one one bag, I noticed she ground the decaf first, put it in the bag, then ground the Sumatra, and put it in the upper half of the bag, without mixing them together evenly. When she handed me the bag, I said, \"you know, they're not mixed evenly\", and she acknowledged that, but did nothing to fix the uneven mix; she just kinda shrugged her shoulders and said half-heartedly \"it'll be all right\". I wasn't gonna make a big deal over it, so took the 1-lb of coffee, and left the store, figuring I could mix them at home later. But when I got home later and looked at the labels she put on the bag, I saw that the Major Dickason's label did not state \"Decaf\", so now have a pound of coffee with twice the caffeine I requested (I consider it a wasted $16.50) ...geez, I'm so damn pissed at her. \n\nThis particular Peet's (which I've been going to for years) has had some good folks on their staff; unfortunately, the barista who took my order tonight wasn't one of them.", "author": "Ed D."}

Since then, I've been checking out every other Peet's to see if they have marble bread ... and they usually don't.\n\nSince the FDA requires chains to list nutritional info, I checked it out on the website. It's not that bad, but I was happily ignorant not knowing the calories and macronutrient content.\n\nThe staff is always friendly, enthusiastic, and efficient.

Peet's is one of those small (and perfectly formed) high quality chains we just don't experience, and right from the moment I entered and saw the huge hunks of cake, the hip young baristas with friendly smiles, the locals publicly writing on their laptops (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12JTDp6xm18), I knew this was my kind of place.\n\nI only ordered a peppermint tea but my two compadres hit the caffeine and were muchly impressed. As for my herbal infusion, it was lush. One of the nicest I'd ever had, and they even gave me a spare teabag to either make mine stronger or fashion my own at home. Oh, the loveliness. Peet's. you're one of the many things making me reverse-homesick. And you were part of the swinging sixties movement too. Sheesh. Can you DO no wrong?", "author": "Emma Louise M."}

No.  Did I vow to never go back to that Peet's in fear of my being recognized as the girl who shattered the honey jar?  Yes.\n\nBut today, I accidentally wandered in, panic set in, and NO ONE recognized me!  So, I think ill be back.

I say that because i love Peet's coffee and at every other location I've been to, I've had an amazing experience.   Today, however, seemed like a day where EVERYONE in the store was new.  \n\nFirst, i got in there and it didn't seem too busy.   There was a line of people waiting for their \"special\" drinks, be it the mocha or the frappa or the cappa...whatever, thats common.  Those drinks take time, i understand.   I ordered a some what basic medium coffee with an add shot.  I was thinking it would take a minute / two minutes max.   I'm not a Blue Bottle, they're not doing the individual drip, it's pre-made, just throw in the espresso.  \n\n6 minutes later the espresso shows up sans house coffee....another minute later the coffee shows up.   I think the reason this is baffling to me is that there were 8 people working this morning in a fairly high trafficked area and none of them seemed to have had a clue.   \n\nAlso, i'm dinging this Peet's for how they handled a spill.   Apparently, someone had dropped their Foam drink and it spilled everywhere.  Rather than grabbing a mop and mopping it up quickly.   One of the Marvelous 8 attempted to clean it up with a rag, stopped, had to go get another rag, continue cleaning, stop, fetch another rag.   I would say this took a good 8-10 minutes.  I'm basing that on him already cleaning when i came in and finished just before i left.

I will even plan my evening commute around going to this location! I love coffee and since I don't drink soda, alcohol, tea or juice (except for OJ), coffee and water are really all that's left for me to drink. Now you know how you have your favorite barista and your favorite coffee shop, well here they're ALL great! My drink is a pain in the a@# to make and normally when I order it everyone behind the counter (and some behind me) rounds their eyes, their eyes bug out in shock or there's some sort of combination of those with a side of judgment, but not here! I can proudly ask (well I don't have to ask anymore b/c they know my favorites and now they just ask if i want hot or cold) for my large, iced, 13 pump vanilla, and breve (half & half creamer) latte or my med coffee in a large cup add 12 pumps of vanilla and lots of room coffee without shame. The drink is always made right and great! They are always super friendly and b/c they know i work around the corner and i only have a 10 min break they start making my drink as I walk in!! Is that not the best service you've ever heard of!? And at a chain?! Normally at places like Starbucks they may remember your name but the friendliness is so transparent and insincere they might as well not and act like I'm just anything face in the crowd b/c that other stuff is kinda creepy!", "author": "Shannon E."}

I mean, this is the second newbie in the FiDi within a month's time, plus there is a shiny new one poised to open on Van Ness at Bush on my way home. Don't get me wrong -- I'm not faulting them. As a chai-loving coffee-hater, Peet's is my favorite local tea vendor, but it does leave me scratching my noggin. As for this latest one, it is right next door to Stacey's Books AND has the cutest little courtyard ever, so I'm totally into it. Grand opening special ends tomorrow, betches, so git it!", "author": "Gregor G."}

At Sbucks, they scald the milk because they are rushing to get everything ready, and they overroast the coffee to cover up the less appealing flavours.
