Its 65 bux a person for a pre fixe menu. You get a starter, entree, and dessert, which all in all is pretty fairly priced in my opinion. The portions are def solid and you arent leaving hungry.\n\nStarters:\nCaviar and blinis- Really good. Its an extra 14 bux added to your $65, but its worth it.\n\nCelery ravioli- Decent, but i wouldnt get again.\n\nCrispy pork belly in corn chowder- One of my favorites. The pork belly is so tender. If you come in a group, have someone get this.\n\nEntrees:\nFlatiron Steak- Skip this. Meat is chewy, which i should have expected. This isnt a steak house.\n\nSturgeon Schnitzel- In case ur wondering, sturgeon is a fix. Dish was well made and id recommend.\n\nPork Rib Chop- Very solid pork chop. Not dry at all. Compared to other things on the menu tho, I dont feel this shined as much.\n\nFor dessert instead of choosing just 1, you can choose the dessert sampler for a lil extra. Id recommend doing that so that you can get a lil of everything. The one thing you cant get is the semifreddo.\n\nDULCE DE LECHE SEMIFREDDO: The semifreddo itself was delicious. The pineapple sorbet didnt taste much like pineapple. It was also a lil too tart/sour for my liking, but still good.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience and would def recommend the restaurant if youre stopping by. It also does really well with large parties.", "author": "Frank L."}

Eventhough the drink is more to the pricey side, the prix fixe menu at The Dining Room is very reasonable ($65++ per person), portion wise is quite big, very beautifully plated and taste excellent.\n\nThere are 3 courses to choose from, and all of them didn't disappoint.\nFor the first course we had Grilled Spanish Octopus, it is very tender, very beautifully plated decorated with edible flowers, served with crispy octopus chips, very impressive.\nThe Crispy Pork Belly taste superb, it warmed up my belly, served in a decent size.\nFor the second course we had Sturgeon Schnitzel & Skim Net Gulf Prawns. Both of them taste spectacular, served in a big portion especially the Sturgeon, it is crispy on the outside and tender inside, the butter smells amazing.\nThe Dulce De Leche Semifreddo & Ginger Panna Cotta desserts taste very delicious, very beautifully presented.\n\nThe lower level of the restaurant is The Social, it also has nice ambiance and it has lounge area to relax with a glass of cocktail.\nService was attentive, overall it was a great experience.\nI would love to come back to check out the Rooftop 25 next time.", "author": "Irene X."}

This place deserves 3.5 stars, as the space is gorgeous, the drinks are good, the food was good, but you have to serve yourself silverware. \n\nThe rooftop is beautiful! I loved the space and the drinks were yummy. We got the John Daly, which was a chilled Arnold Palmer with liquor. We also got a raspberry mojito, which was yummy and sweet. \n\nWe got a cheese plate, which I enjoyed, and the bread it came with was soft. We split a chicken sandwich which came with Brie and bacon, and it didn't blow me away, but it hit the spot. \n\nIt can be hard to get a seat here. It was packed around 5:30 when we got there, and for some reason, you have to get your own silverware.

The restaurant is a two story brick building that is obscurely tucked away at the end of Tusk St. off Townsend. As you enter, the hostess asks which restaurant you are dining at. Yes, the restaurant houses three different style eateries, each with its own unique atmoshphere. \n\nOn the lower level is The Social, which is modern lounge with an18 seat bar with couches and bar tables with a menu that offers small bites to full entrees. The Dining Room level is the main dining area, which offers a seasonal menu. Their Rooftop 25 recently opened with casual outdoor seating with a bar and casual dining menu items such as  burgers, pizzas and tacos. Nice roof top casual dining with music and views of the surrounding area.\n\nWe were planning to dine in The Social, but it was booked for a private party, so we were seated in The Dining Room at one of the booth by the bar. After checking out the menu, we ordered our drinks and food.\n\nFirst, we were served an amuse bouche of Truffled Mushroom Cheesecake.  Nope, not a dessert, but a tasty savory treat. We told our server that we enjoyed it and he brought us another serving. \n\nYellowtail Ceviche - The yellowtail were dressed in a tamari, jalapeno escabeche, yuzu and mint. Enjoy the delicious yellowtail with the rice crisps.\n\nSturgeon Schnitzel - a large piece of sturgeon topped with Austrian cucumbers resting English peas and Parmesan spaetzle with lemon butter. Enjoy this dish. Nicely plated. The spaetzle was the starch component of this dish, but wished there was more for a balance. \n \nBershire pork rib chop - perfectly cooked pink. It was moist and was complemented with the cauliflower, crispy fava leaves, pressed strawberry with a dark strawberry sauce. \n\nSampling of small desserts consisting of a lemon tart, raspberry chocolate mousse, and ginger panna cotta. It was a nice getting to taste three of the four desserts on the menu. \n\nOur server and support staff were friendly and answered our questions. We found out the building was formerly a smoke house and the small dining rooms in the side were rooms were they smoked/cured meats. With the tasty food and nice atmosphere, it was a nice dining experience. Will like to come back to check out the Rooftop.", "author": "Al L."}

I'd go back for drinks at the lounge, but not for dinner .\n\nI loved the modern decor, cozy booth, and very attentive service at Twenty Five Lusk. Overall I wasn't blown away by the food. It was rather pricey, and I feel that I could have had more unique dishes for the same price elsewhere. \n\nCocktails: Dining room cocktails were fine but on the sweeter side and not really special. \n\nAppetizer: We ordered the BBQ oyster ($4 each) and charred spanish octopus (one tentacle for $18). While we definitely tasted the smokiness from the octopus, there was really not much to eat. The four of us shared one tentacle, basically one bite each...\n\nDinner: I had the SKILLET ROASTED LOCAL BLACK COD (w/escarole, shishitos, runner beans, saffron mussel broth) for $33. My friends ordered the braised rabbit  ($32), pork chop ($35), and flat iron steak ($40). The presentation was usual for a fine dining new-american restaurant, but the dishes were generally just salty. My shishitos pepper were overly salty and I didn't appreciate that. \n\nThe highlight was the lobster mac and cheese ($16). \n\nDessert: We shared the peanut butter flan ($11) and sampling of small desserts ($11).

I saw on Instagram that people were checking into a new rooftop (yes there's quite a limited amount) and was surprised to see that Twenty Five Lusk had opened up a rooftop! Hooray, cool summer vibes! \n\nI checked it out with my friend and we were not so enthused to see that the rooftop was actually very casual, with picnic table setups and order at the counter logistics. The drink menu had (3) options, so I opted for the Gin cocktail with fresh fruit. Overall, the rooftop is cool for summer days but definitely not the \"luxe\" aspect I thought it would be. \n\nWe ended up moving downstairs inside to the restaurant and sat at the bar, ordering the Prix Fix menu ($60) for 3 courses, great deal. I got the salmon, green ravioli (so good) and asparagus soup. Cocktails were great and fresh, and the conversation with the bartenders were fun. \n\nDefinitely recommend to go with girlfriends, dates etc if you want a trendy place to dress up at!

Had a fantastic dining experience here, but it's not one of those places that leaves a strong impression and I probably won't be back any time soon. Good option for date night or girl's night.\n\nTwenty Five Lusk has a lot of strong appetizer contenders so order several to share with the table and don't miss out. Bacon cornbread and ahi tuna tartare were bomb. My friend raved about the french fries, but I thought they were very mediocre to be honest. Also ate:\n\nSkillet Roasted Ling Cod: Pass on this. It's okay but a little too salty and a little too underwhelming. Nothing special, even though the server raved about it.\n\nRoasted Chicken: I don't usually go for chicken dishes like this at restaurants due to the simplicity of it, but the roasted chicken here is unbelievably good. It's hearty and incredibly flavorful, and well complemented by the sunchokes, brussels sprouts, etc. and the truffle sauce. Highly recommend.\n\nDark Chocolate Marquise: Very very decadent. It was yummy but not particularly memorable. It did successfully satisfy my sweets cravings, but wouldn't necessarily order this again.\n\nHilariously, my favorite part of the meal was the free brownie square that our server so graciously gave us at the end of the meal! So sweet of him to do so, and it was delicious. Fluffy and perfectly sweet. Wished that I'd had a full serving of this instead.\n\nNet net: come here for a delicious dining experience.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-15", "description": "Gorgeous place to wine and dine, with an upstairs exclusively for dining and a spacious downstairs bar/lounge area. I brought my best friend here for her birthday dinner in hopes to chill at the bar before our reservation, but due to traffic and difficulty finding parking, we barely made it in by our reservation time. So just a heads up, it's a busy part of the city and parking is scarce; they do offer valet though. \n\nNow if I were only rating this establishment on the ambiance and decor, 5 stars! The food though, was just alright. For starters, we ordered the scotch quail eggs, pork belly confit, uni mousse, and the bacon cornbread. Our server recommended that we cut the quail egg in half before eating because the yolk was runny but to our disappointment, the yolk was actually cooked. The uni mousse was also a disappointment, there was little to no uni flavor and the fish eggs and potato chip taste was overpowering. The better appetizers that we ordered was the bacon cornbread (muffins) and the pork belly confit. The cornbread had real bits of corn and bacon which was great paired with the salted butter. Pork belly portion was super small but crispy and pretty good. \n\nFor our mains, we decided on the sweet corn risotto and skillet roasted ling cod. I didn't like either one of these dishes, the risotto was way too salty and overpriced for what it was. We were told that the cod was a new item on the menu, and it definitely needs some work. There was barely any flavor and pretty much tasted like straight fish. It wasn't as soft as other cods that I've had. Unfortunately, the food at Twenty Five Lusk was just not up to par. \n\nOn the other hand, the service was great. We were constantly being checked up on and our server was very attentive and friendly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-19", "description": "Came here for dinner. \n\nHad the following to eat: \n1. Squash Soup - this was a complimentary amuse-bouche.  I thought it was delicious.  It comes in these large spoons which you can see in my photos.  It's pretty sour which I liked.  It was good that they served it in small amounts because I can't see someone enjoying a whole bowl of something that sour. \n\n2. Wedge Cut Fries - these were okay. They felt lightly fried. It didn't have that thick crunchy outside that fried potatoes usually have which isn't necessarily a bad thing in my opinion. The basil aioli was really good. But I don't think I wouldn't have enjoyed McDonald's fries with ketchup more. I love fries with ketchup and I don't think there's much one can do to make it better.\n\n3. Bacon Cornbread - these were absolutely delicious! Probably the best of the snacks/small plates that we got.  The cornbread was delicious and the persimmon & date butter was amazing.  I would definitely order this again. \n\n4. Ahi Tuna Tartare - these was also really good. I don't usually like raw fish but I found this a lot more palatable than other raw fish I've had. So I would imagine that for people who love raw fish to start off with, this is probably amazing.  The avocado mousse was interesting. Never had it before but it was good. \n\n5. Charred Spanish Octopus - this was also absolutely delicious!  The octopus was soft and not chewy with a nice charred flavor.  The golden beets on the plate were so incredibly sweet.  I was shocked.  The brussel sprouts and hazelnuts were also good. \n\n6. Grilled Skim Net Gulf Prawns - also absolute delicious.  The prawns were a good size. The grits were nice and buttery. \n\n7. Flat iron steak - this was delicious for flat iron steak. I thought the flavor of the meat was delicious. But, it was a little chewy but manageable with thinner slices against the grain of the meat. My only issue at the time was that it was flank steak and that they could have used a better cut of lean meat.  However, now that I'm looking at the only menu, I noticed that flat iron steak isn't on the menu. Instead, its the same dish but with filet mignon at a higher price. This probably would have been better. The eggplant in the dish was a okay.  \n\n8. Salted Caramel Brownie - also an amuse-bouche.  This was absolutely delicious. I love salted caramel and this was so good. I wish I could have had more than a small bite.  \n\nHad the following drinks:\n1. Dark and Stormy - basically tasted like a sweet diluted rum.  I thought the drink was pretty weak.  I can typically feel weak drinks like beer, but I barely felt this.  \n\n2. SF Yacht Club - it is a nice refreshing drink. The strongest flavor is cucumber.  I'm not a huge fan of cucumber so I would've preferred the lemon, lime and mint flavors to be the strongest.  Then maybe it would've tasted more like a mojito. The drink also wasn't that strong. \n\nThe restaurant is in a small gringy alleyway, but the moment you step through the doors, you feel completely transported into another place. The ambiance is amazing.  It feels modern and almost futuristic. It's dimly light and great for a night out. I wouldn't bring kids here.  The service was good and as expected. My only issue is that the two people tables were placed a little too close.  The place isn't very loud so I could hear the entire conversation going on next to us.  They were also loud speakers. It almost felt like they wanted to announce everything they were saying.  \n\nTL/DR: Bacon corn bread was SO GOOD and I would recommend everyone try it. The ahi tuna tartare and grilled octopus were also delicious.  I would recommend passing on the wedge cut fries. The grilled prawns were really good. The flat iron steak I would suggest waiting until the filet mignon comes back (if it ever will) unless you know you want that cut. The drinks weren't impressive and felt pretty weak over all. The ambiance was great and the service was as expected. The two seater tables are placed a little too close. I would definitely recommend this place for a night out.", "author": "Jon P."}

I've been wanting to come here for awhile now, and I'm fortunate to have moved just a few blocks away. I finished up a rough weekend shift at work, so my boyfriend and I decided to go out for an impromptu date night while the roommates watched the puppy. Thank goodness for them! This was a fantastic, memorable dining experience. \n\nWe called ahead to make sure there would be a table at the time we were planning to do, though it turns out that this place is quite big so I shouldn't have been concerned. I did feel under dressed in this upscale-feeling restaurant, but the host and our waiter were very welcoming. There was a soft, sultry nature about this place, and next time I'm definitely going to get a little more dressed up for it. We got comfortable at our table upstairs and perused the menu. We started with the grilled octopus, which contained artichoke vinaigrette, basil, asparagus, pickled shallot, a poached egg. Perfectly prepared with all the different textures and flavors. Would highly recommend.\n\nFor my main dish, I had the risotto with watercress, prosciutto, crispy onions, eggplant, and smoked olives. Oh my goodness. I over-dramatically died and went to heaven over that dish. One of the best risotto dishes I've ever had. Again, the textures and flavors were amazing. I was a very happy diner. We didn't get to try the dessert, so perhaps we'll have to start with that next time. Fortunately we'll definitely have that opportunity since I ended up getting a gift certificate for 25 Lusk for my birthday! Classy place for intimate dates or fancier group business dinners. Would highly recommend, and I look forward to coming here again!", "author": "Stefanie C."}

I had a reservation and the host and hostess were a bit curt with me and put me at the bar, which I thought was a bit weird, even though I *was* dining alone. The main course also took a really long time to come out even though the restaurants was emptying out (it was getting toward closing time) -- the bartender serving me even apologized about the wait (twice!).\n\nThat being said, the bartender (Chris) was super friendly and helpful and cool and his service was awesome. Then the food and drink were all really good. I got the SF Restaurant Week menu with the half glass pairings and chose:\n\n-Steak tartare which was a big serving and really flavorful, with a kind of fancy creamy guacamole with it. It was paired with a bubble rose that was a bit sweet but nice.\n\n-Grilled prawns (four big ones that were perfectly lightly grilled) on a bed of green beans, succotash, and a slightly spicy cream sauce that was incredibly flavorful. This was paired with a riesling, which I was very skeptical of because I usually think of that as a dessert wine, and it was indeed pretty sweet and a little syrupy. However, the sweet paired incredibly well with the spiciness and savoriness of the prawns and sauce.\n\n-A just incredible brownie with a little scoop of ice cream, so dang good! It was paired with a very grapey port and while I usually like a nice port with chocolate, this was a bit too overpowering.\n\nAll in all it was a great meal and a pretty good deal during SF Restaurant Week!", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

When you first arrive, the signage outside that spells out its name is so nicely designed, not gaudy or in your face at all. When you walk in, there's brick walls, it's dimly lit, and has tall ceilings. There was some sort of company party going on downstairs so I did not check it out..sooo, we didn't get to see the fireplace. \n\nOk, so the ambience is A+, and how about the food? We came during restaurant week, and I personally got some caviar blinis, prawns, and the brownie. I also got a vodka drink..I forgot what it was called, but it's one of their specials. The food was a solid A or A-. As in, it was delicious, but not mind blowingly so that it makes me want to cry. Not like the interior. I was definitely STUFFED by the end of it, so portions are not small. The only thing that I didn't really care for was the brownie cuz it was kinda dense. My boyfriend likes dense brownies, so that might be a personal thing. \n\nI was sooo mesmerized by the interior that I looked their restaurant on their website. They host weddings!!

The only thing you could taste was sesame oil. The texture was also super off. It was really slimy and I doubt the fish was fresh.\n- Local caviar & blinis (+$10 supplement)\n4/5: this might be the only dish I actually enjoyed.\n\nSecond Course:\n- Mushroom risotto\n2/5: the lemon and parmesan taste was so overpowering that my dinner date & I wasn't even able to eat it.\n- Filet mignon\n3/5: this was actually decent and cooked well. Still, it was nothing special. (+$16 supplement)\n\nThird Course:\n- Lime posset\n2/5: this dish definitely had potential but it was sooo tangy that we couldn't eat much of it\n- Caramel brownie\n1/5: the brownie was hard af. We also didn't bother eating this\n\nExtras:\n- Foie gras pot\n1/5: I think it may have been the worst foie gras that I've had. Partially due to the fact that it was served so cold that we could barely scoop it and partially because the orange jam on top was way too over powering. \n- Lobster mac n cheese\n4/5: this was actually really good! Not too cheesy and a good bit of lobster chunk in it", "author": "Annie N."}

Prior to the wedding, we had a restaurant booked to have the reception, but it cancelled on us 2 months before our wedding date! As if things weren't stressful enough, we started the search for a new restaurant. Luckily, we came across 25 Lusk. For starters, the place is absolutely stunning aesthetically. The design is so unbelievably modern and, most importantly, unique. It was actually better than some of the full-build event spaces we looked at, which were probably at least double the price. As for the staff, they were so unbelievably helpful and pleasant to work with from the start. Their entire team was absolutely incredible! Before moving to the Bay area for our current careers, my wife and I spent many years in Las Vegas in the food and beverage industry. Needless to say we hold some pretty high expectations when it comes to service standards. The entire execution of our full restaurant buyout was flawless. The events team helped coordinate many specific details and requests without any hesitation. The restaurant managers were extremely personable and helpful every step of the way. The waitstaff and bar staff were always eager to help and truly went out of their way to make sure the event ran smoothly and efficiently. Lastly, Chef Matthew and his kitchen staff cooked up one of the best meals any of us have ever had. And given that they did so for 4 fairly intricate courses (including 30 minutes of a variety of hors d' oeuvres) for 85 guests, was even more impressive. To this day, our friends and family are still raving about the food quality (and I still day dream about that tender/ flavorful/ delicious short rib entree!). We can't thank the staff enough for making our wedding day so perfect and for exceeding every high expectation we initially had.

My friend and I had a fantastic time - we snacked on the rabbit tacos (excellent) and maybe pretzels with a dipping sauce? I may be remembering this totally wrong as our visit was back in March - and we didn't end up having to pay for our tab because one of the well-spoken bar patrons graciously picked it up.

I like the play of texture in each dish and the pop of something unexpected. \n\nAmuse bouche - Mushroom cheesecake - Wonderful and velvety with a beautiful umami flavor.\n\nAhi tuna tartare - Very refreshing. Loved the freshness of the ahi tuna with the crisp and avocado mousse.\n\nArtichoke and Parmesan risotto: Rich and creamy with a lemon notes. Two of my friends mentioned that it was too lemony but I disagree. I personally am a huge fan of lemon and did not find it overpowering. I thought it was quite well-balanced. Additionally, the shallots that they used has this wonderful smoky quality to it that was reminiscent of bacon.\n\nLemon mousse: They ran out of the lime posset so I was able to order a dessert off the regular menu. I feel extremely lucky for having been able to do so because this dessert was simply divine. The meyer lemon mousse was refreshing and sweet without being bitter (or too tart) and the play on texture with the peanut brittle was brilliant. It was a playground of flavors in my mouth.  \n\nOverall, well-done on a balanced Restaurant Week menu. It was able to accommodate my vegetarian, pescatarian and meat-lover friends. The only thing I would discount is that the dishes tend to be on the saltier side.

Today, 10/20/18 I was invited to this restaurant to celebrate my good friends birthday. Upon my arrival I was warmly greeted and was directed to the bar while I awaited my party. The bartender was very enthusiastic and versed with the drinks he was preparing. Once the birthday girl arrived we were escorted to our seats which was in a nice private seating area. I must add that not one time during this experience were myself or other guest informed of the restaurant being out of dishes presented on the menu. As we sat down; viewed the menu and prepared to order we got set on every option presented on the menu. After 15 minutes of viewing our waitress Danielle (Danni) came and ask if we were ready to order; we reluctantly replied yes. As our guest started to order we were then informed that one of the lobster options wasn't available, after setting our hearts set out for it, we had to search on the menu for other options. Which in my view was a high disappointment! We ordered our food and was approached 7 minutes after our food was ordered that yet another dish wasn't available. This was a conundrum for us because the option that was ordered was also not available; which lead our new waiter to ask if we wanted to have three flat iron steaks to equate one \"cow\" steak, that was 26 ounces vs 6 ounces of the flat iron. However the guest opted for one flat iron steak by default and was still disappointed. Moving forward, everyone receive their meals. When I ordered a medium well steak, I received a completely well done dry steak. That had to be sent back! Although the \"new\" steak that arrived was medium, I stomached it instead of sending it back, especially since I was super hungry. I was throughly disappointed with the services provided. I forgot to note that Mateo didn't know the chefs special that was presented for me, however he assisted us and was very warm with being versed with the main menu options. Will I recommend this restaurant to my friends I highly doubt it, I just wished for future guest, that they don't experience this same service, as well as not running out of items and informing guest of items that aren't available at the beginning before the restaurant experience. The waitress Danni had a standoffish demeanor, and couldn't present our receipt; the bartender did!

Recent reviews were no bueno with complaints ranging from mediocre food to painfully slow service. My expectations were in the gutter.\n\nImagine my surprise when the experience was completely opposite. A very pleasant surprise, indeed.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nDRINKS:\nGrapefruit Gilmet (sans simple syrup)\nLusk New Fashioned\n\nFOOD:\nAppetizers -- Grilled Octopus and Ahi Tuna Tartare\nEntree -- Pork Tenderloin\nSide -- Sweet Potato Fries\n\nThe Tuna Tartare and Pork stole the show. The pork tenderloin was perfectly cooked, and the egg was a brilliant touch. Absolutely delicious. The house focaccia...I would eat a basket of. Thank GOD they only give you one cube.\n\nThe Grapefruit Gimlet was also brilliant. I'm simple with my booze (red wine or a Bloody), but 25 Lusk's menu begs venturing into the unknown. When I asked about the sweetness of another drink, the waitress immediately jumped to the gimlet as a good tart option and recommended withholding the simple syrup. As someone who is generally not a fan of sweet things and finds most cocktails to be horrifically sweet, I was very impressed that she took it two steps beyond my initial question and made ordering a drink - and ordering one I really, really liked - easy. Sigh of relief.\n\nTwice within our meal, a little gift \"from the chef\" arrived. The first was prior to our appetizers - two little mushroom and cheese cakes (it was an interesting mushroom-cheese mousse shaped in a cube) and two cubes of a sea salt caramel brownie with dessert wine at the very end. I found those to be a really nice touch.\n\nThere was also care taken while we were ordering; our waitress helped us arrange the pairings of our dishes and someone from the kitchen came out to describe both courses (the appetizers and mains) in great detail.\n\nService was efficient. I thought all the dishes arrived at the perfect time - not too fast, and not too slow. We only hit the two hour mark some other reviewers whined about because we were enjoying ourselves and stayed after we finished eating. (The food coma may be partly to blame, too.)\n\nTL;DR the million dollar (no pun intended) question -- Would I come here, if I was paying?

The four of us did a personal rating at the table after we finished our meal.  I gave it 6 out of 10 and the others gave it a 7 out of 10.\n\n We arrived to a mostly empty restaurant at 6:25pm for a 6:45pm reservation.  We were asked to wait downstairs and have a cocktail and were told, \"I'll come to find you when your table is ready\". We were dismissed to the beautiful lounge space downstairs. He showed up at 7pm to tell us our table was ready and we were already two cocktails in at that point.\n\nThe waiter brought out four full menus and a cocktail/wine menu for all of us to peruse.  He also brought only one SF Restaurant Week menu and told us that if one of us at the table wants to order from this fixed price ($40) SF Restaurant menu, then he would prefer that all of us order from it as well because it will affect the timing of the dishes being brought out.  Not one of us had ever heard of this before and it felt like asking for the fixed price menu was not a \"cool\" thing to be doing.\nAt that point, I asked him to bring additional fixed price menus so that everyone could see what was being offered instead of having to share just one at the table.  He came back to the table with just one extra menu.  I asked again and he came back with just one more.  Our fourth diner still was not given this fixed price separate menu.\nWhy?  I do not know why.\n\nThe food was delivered warm.  I started with the wild mushroom ravioli and others had the ahi tuna tartar.   Both were just ok.  The tuna was heavily seasoned with soy sauce and the ravioli, being luke warm, were not that appealing.  Very bland as well.\n\nMy second course added $16 to the fixed price menu because I ordered the Wagyu beef. It was not a very big steak and it was served over a small amount of roasted cauliflower.  The cauliflower was rubbery.  The steak itself should have melted in one's mouth--it did not.\n\nDessert were chocolate brownies with sea salt and a splash of caramel sauce.  They were small, dry and uninspired.\n\nI bought into the hype and allure of 25 Lusk after reading that President Obama dined here in June.\nI don't think I'll eat here again--maybe just go for drinks and bar menu munchies.  They have a pretty decent Happy Hour menu although the bartender was stiff and uptight too.\n\nThe crowd was mostly very young techies who probably feel that that they have succeeded in life by hanging out here and dining on what they think is excellent fare.\nThe neighborhood is a stones throw from sketchiness.  They do have valet parking for $18 as well as street parking. ( We parked in front of District.)  There is also the Safeway parking garage a block away.\n\nWe all ordered from the fixed price menu but our bill was still $290.  The drinks did it.....", "author": "Thomas D."}

The ambiance, decor, and architecture left us awestruck as we walked in. It was so classy, clean, and chic. The establishment is very spacious with two entire floors. The bf and I were already very impressed and at a disbelief as to how this was our first time here.\n\nFor restaurant week, Twenty Five Lusk offered a $40 3-course menu with optional wine pairings for $20 (half pour) and $35 (full pour).\n\nThe bf decided to go with the $20 half pour wine pairing (a rose, a white wine, and a moscato). I initially wanted their seasonal cocktail with pineapple (forgot the name), but they ran out of the pineapple puree. *sigh*. So I decided to go with the SF Yacht Club, which was a bit strong to me, but the bf really liked it.\n\nWe were offered a slice of focaccia bread (delish!) and a cheese puff amuse bouche as a compliment from the chef.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the ahi tuna tartar and the mushroom ravioli. The ravioli was a bit heavy for an appetizer but very tasty. I was already pretty full after eating it. The ahi tuna tartare was a bit disappointing. It had good chunks of tuna, but was very saucy and slimy. It also didn't have any structure to it. It was just a pile of scooped tuna vs the circular towers we're used it. We've definitely had better elsewhere.\n\nFor entrees, we had the artic char, which replaced the prawns since they ran out, and the raclette risotto. The artic char was cooked perfectly with the skin crisp and the fish wasn't overcooked and flaked beautifully. The risotto was also cooked perfectly. I usually don't like olives, but I ate the ones in the risotto, they had a very slight olive taste almost indistinct and instead was very smoky in flavor which added balance to the rich and creamy risotto.\n\nFor dessert, we had the lime posset and salted caramel swirled brownie. Yummm. Both desserts were delicious. The lime posset was very tart in the beginning which was then balanced with the cream. They definitely gave a generous portion. The brownie was definitely the favorite of the desserts.\n\nFor $40, our meal was definitely worth it, as each entree is normally priced at $30+. Service was perfect as well. We were check on frequently and waters were refilled often.\n\nOverall, we thought the food was slightly above average, there wasn't a dish to die for that we would have to come back just to have again. But we were very happy with our dining experience in which we will definitely return. Maybe to try out happy hour if it isn't too crazy.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

I ordered the carnival en oaxaca because I absolutely love mezcal and spicy flavors. BF ordered the dark and stormy because he knew I wanted to try it was well =) both drinks were delish! \n\nWe decided to get one of each thing from the Restaurant Week menu and added a side of potatoes. \n\nWe were given focaccia to start with. It tasted good, I just wish it was served warm! But taste wise was fine. \n\nFor the amuse bouche we were given a chilled watermelon gazpacho with fennel and ginger. Ehh, neither of us were crazy about it. \n\nFor appetizers, we had the ahi tuna and the ravioli. We both enjoyed the ahi tuna more. The ravioli was more on the sweet side, but still decent. \n\nFor the mains, we had the prawns and risotto. The prawns were the star hands down! Juicy and cooked perfectly! The risotto was disappointing. The portion was small and taste wise it was very one note. I was expecting a super cheese raclette flavor, but didn't taste any in the risotto. \n\nThe side of potatoes was just...potatoes. Just boiled potatoes tossed with onions. Big portion, but I'd pass on this. \n\nFor dessert we had the chocolate brownie and the lime posset. The lime posset doesn't look impressive, but oh my!!! This was AMAZING!

From the scotch quail egg, the blinis and caviar (not traditional beluga), octopus, duck, and oysters, everything had a unique spin and was prepared and presented with utmost attention to detail. We spent about $300 including tip on 4 people and had an additional serving of rabbit left over.\n\nConclusions:  Twenty Five Lusk is an expensive, exceptionally well run restaurant whose only fault was cooking dry rabbit.", "author": "Andrew H."}

Made reservations for brunch on a Sunday, but the place wasn't too busy despite there being a Giants game happening next door. \n\nBeautiful restaurant setting with a up-scale, classy, and modern feel. They're on the expensive side, but their portions are big here depending on what you order. Came here with a Gilt City voucher for 1 appetizer, 1 side, and 2 entrees, which was a good deal due to the quality and quantity.\n\nComplimentary Pastries and Smoothie Shooter: Loved that they give these at the beginning for free to start your breakfast. They had tiny croissants and chocolate croissants that were so cute, and a tasty coffee cake. It was nice of the kitchen to give a strawberry honeydew smoothie shot which was really good and refreshing.\n\nYellowtail Tartare: Great presentation! The rice cracker made a nice accent to the tartare... fish was a little bland without the avocado sauce they had on the side, but it was a a good starter dish, very light. Also not fishy in smell or taste at all.\n\nLobsters Benedict: Originally I was going for the steak and eggs benedict, but the server let me order the lobster benedict even though it wasn't on the menu... score! Lobster meat is a little small but still tasty, and there was bacon on top to act as another meat. Poached egg was cooked well and the portion was just right. The breakfast potatoes on the side were very good as well. \n\nMy only complaint is that there wasn't enough hollondaise sauce... like seriously, there was so little of it! I love the acidity of hollondaise sauce... you could probably ask for more on the side, but I didn't want to trouble our server.\n\nLingcod Tartine: Now as we talk about portions... THIS WAS HUGE. Like seriously, not only is there a thick slap of lingcod on top of a bed of heriloom tomatoes and spinach... there's a thick slab of bread and a side of fries. Lingcod was well seasoned and cooked - I was surprise how much fish it came with. The fries were crispy. I'm not sure why there's such a large serving of veggies and bread though, it seemed out of place. The heriloom tomatoes were really good - they had this sour sweetness to it. Overall it was delicious, just a lot for my sister and I had a hard time helping her finish it.\n\nSide of Bacon: They're bacon is thick yet crispy. I prefer my bacon really crunchy, so this might be a turn off for some folks. I'm sure you could ask the kitchen to adjust it, but yeah... they're bacon is very crispy.\n\nHats off to our server - he was very attentive and went out of the way to ask the kitchen if they could offer the lobster benedict. Even the seating hostess filled our water glass when she noticed our glasses were going low. I had trouble printing the Gilt City voucher the night before, but they were accommodating and simply took my voucher number on my phone screen instead of requiring the actual voucher (per the instructions from Gilt City).\n\nIt's a really short walk from the K/N Trolley or the Caltrain station, otherwise street parking only. There's also a nearby paid garage and I think they offer valet parking as well. Nice brunch spot in the city!", "author": "Alyanna C."}

Not only is there impeccable service, yet also, incredible food-a difficult combination to reach. \n\nWe came with a plan to share small plates rather than splurge on the entrees since we enjoy tapas style family dinners. However, the knowledgeable and friendly staff convinced us to also try the whole cooked fish. We agreed after enjoying the delicious small plates also recommended by our server, David.\n\nOur Order:\n*Snacks*\n1) Bacon Cornbread\nGood starter, the honey and herb butter are nice as well.\n2) Togarashi Popcorn\nNice to snack on while waiting, however, it was too big of a portion for the 4 of us to consume.\n\n*Small plates*\n1) Yellowtail Sashimi\nBeautiful presentation and very tasty with the greens acting as a refreshing element.\n2) Foraged Mushroom Ravioli\nAbsolutely delicious; a combination of complementing flavors.\n3) Sungold Tomato Gazpacho\nThe lobster is a delicious addition to this classic dish.\n4) Grilled Octopus\nIt is very difficult to do octopus right, but this is an example of how it should be done. We were blown away by the balance of flavors and textures that blended beautifully. It is nicely charred and crispy on the outside with a delicious and soft interior. \n5) (off menu) Fig and Melon Salad with Prosciutto\nGreat, simple dish with beautiful flavors.\n\n*For the table*\n1) Whole Fish From The Boat\nThis dish is definitely a showstopper with its taco-bar-like style including plenty of homemade tortillas, toppings, and flavor. We knew this dish was a must order after seeing that the executive chef had recently written an acclaimed cookbook about cooking with fish and the staff's recommendations of it. This is a must have dish. While it may seem pricey, it is perfectly filling for 4 people.\n\n*Desserts*\n1) Sampling of Small Desserts\nThe Raspberry Chocolate Mousse Cake is delicious and packed with a burst of vibrant flavors. The Almond Cake is delicate with a nice crunch. The Summer Melon Terraine is bright and light, a very refreshing dish. The complementing ice creams/sorbets are also very nice. \n2) Vanilla Waffle with Sweet Corn Ice Cream\nThis dish left us smiling with a good crunch and a great mix of textures. It is simple and sweet, a crowd-pleasing dish.\n\n*Complements of the chef*\n1) Popovers\nA simple, nice snack.\n2) A Taste of Sweetness on a Spoon\nA great last look at the wonderful evening and dinner we shared. It is the right amount of sweetness and completed the meal.\n\nWe had 2 top-level cocktails: a solid old-fashioned and a drink which bartender Daniel, per our request, created for us based on a cocktail from our hometown, high quality bar.\n\nThe decor and ambience are sophisticated and modern with a warmness coming from the exposed wooden beams and beautiful wood tables. The service was as sophisticated and warm as the ambience. It was spot on with constant, appropriate attention. We look forward to returning to this wonderful restaurant and experience when we are in town again.", "author": "Sarah S."}

I do not understand why this place is so popular. Inside it is dark and uncomfortable. And most importantly - they, you could say, stole my thing. I accidentally left the Louis Vuitton scarf, which costs $ 700, on the couch at the table where we ate. After we left the table, we were in the restaurant for another 15 minutes, but no one   return the thing. An hour later I started calling the restaurant asking to pick it up, but the manager said that they did not find anything and at my request to see the cameras, he replied that there was nothing to see in the video. Perhaps the waitress in this way avenged me for bringing all the food back to the kitchen. But excuse me, there is a sour pumpkin soup similar to shit and oysters, also sour and poorly peeled, so I almost broke my own tooth - I did not want eat it.

The dish came out cold and crumbly once cut. Not much cheesiness to it either. 3/10\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the tenderloin and duck breast. I would give the duck breast a 4/10 considering it was one of the pricier dishes on the menu but the meat was a little tough. I don't think it was a cooking issue though since it was cooked to a perfect rare-medium rare. The sauce that came with it was also a little overwhelming for the plate - too sour for my taste. The tenderloin, on the other hand, was great. I would give it a 8/10. Meat was very tender and juicy. The sauce in this dish complimented the meat more so than in the duck plate.\n\nWe ordered the blueberry milk chocolate mousse with snickerdoodles for dessert and that was delicious. We also received two small bites of caramel swirl brownies with sea salt, which were on the house. They were a lot better than the dessert we actually ordered imo.

Scheduled plenty of time so the four of us could enjoy a few cocktails, eat and walk over leisurely.   The restaurant has three levels and seemed to be very busy. After being seated it took 15 minutes for the waitress to take our drink orders.  We mentioned upfront we had a concert and she assured us we would be out on time. We waited another 20 minutes for drinks to arrive and from then on the service continued to decline.  The waitress was not attentive and only checked in after being flagged down. The dinner was a pre fix meal and we were there for an hour by the time the first course arrived.   2 out of the 4 Entree's were cold and due to the time limitations we were not able to have the last course.

What intrigues me most is a room that is well thought out, comfortable and unique, incorporating as much natural structure and integrity as possible. \n\nThen of course, we have the all important food and beverage. My favorite restaurants do not try to be everything to everyone. Therefore I am not looking for a menu that is 10 pages long. I want a restaurant to do what they do best. Have a passion for their food and keep it succinct and in line with their theme, hopefully with a high consideration to local sourcing and seasonality.\n\n25 Lusk hit every mark for me! The space was amazing incorporating the brick and timber history and creating a beautifully modern yet comfortable look. The acoustics allowed us to converse without an over abundance of background noise, which is most often a source of discomfort in restaurants. The service we got from our server, Michael, was impeccable with each detail attended to without being overbearing. Our food was exceptional. Creative, impressive and delicious.", "author": "Kathleen S."}

The bottom floor is a dedicated bar section separated from the restaurant with lots of space to accommodate a crowd. If you're coming here with a big group, definitely try and snag the couches on the bottom floor. \n\nDrinks here were good, and the bartenders definitely know what they're doing. I noticed the specialty cocktails tended to have some savory aspect or twist to them--rosemary or jalape\u00f1o syrup, things like that--but a friend who had them said neither were overwhelming.", "author": "Annie M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-07", "description": "3/4/16: Normally it's just me and my gf enjoying the night, but this time we had a double date.  We haven't seen my gf's friend much since she moved here from Ohio a month or so ago, and only met the new bf very briefly, so we were super looking forward to hanging out together.  The bf picked the place since he lived in SF, and man, we were sure glad he did!--this place was amazing!!!\n\nThe decor's beautifully modern, and the service was fantastic, as you would expect.  Even the door-lady was very friendly and had a great smile.  If it were just me and my gf, I think it would have been quite romantic too.\n\nBut..... we had company.... so, I have to admit, my typically laser-sighted attention to food was far more relaxed this night, enjoying the new company.  And thus, I don't recall many finer details of the food.  So, this review will be far less detailed than typical for me... but for good reason--because of new friends, because of my beautiful gf next to me, because of great conversation and stories, and because our little table became a little enchanting world of beautiful edibles...\n\n1. The General's Break $12 \"apple jack, calisaya, dry sherry, bitters\":  Tasted like it was whiskey based, like a citrus Manhattan, but unfortunately was not as complex as I had hoped it would be.  6/10.\n\n2. Fried Burrata $17 \"pickled green tomato salsa, basil, grilled ciabatta\":  I LOVE burrata.  In fact, I think as I write this I just made a promise to myself--must get more burrata next time I go to Whole Foods (that might be a while though.)  FRIED burrata!?!?  Now that sounds like heaven.  I loved the gooey melty parts on the outside.  And they fried it to the perfect doneness where the very middle still retained that watery-stringy texture of fresh burrata.  I didn't like the coating that much though, which was lacking a bit in seasoning.  7.5/10\n\n3. Yukon Gold Gnocchi $15 \"braised rabbit, smoked olive butter, black garlic, quail egg\":  Sorry, this would be one of the ones I didn't remember too much of.  But I would say it wasn't as impressive tasting.  I do remember the pulled rabbit underneath the egg was a bit stringy and dry for me. Plate looked beautiful though.  5/10\n\n4. Grilled Octopus $17 \"asaparagus, bok choy rabe, almonds, basil, spiced coconut broth\":  I guess octopus is kinda the trendy thing right now among the fancy schmancy restaurants.  I think almost all the $$$-$$$$ restaurants I've been to in recent memory have had some form of octopus on their menu.  Hmm.  Anyway, this one was great too.  The octopus was cooked perfectly and was very soft, melting in my mouth.  Great char flavor.  Simple and beautiful tasting.  8.5/10\n\n5. Caviar and Blinis $23 \"red onion, dill, creme fraiche\": So I'm not a caviar connoisseur, mostly cause the stuff is way too expensive.  But 23 bucks ain't bad, so why not.  The waiter also said this was some stuff that just came in fresh.  Well, the caviar was.... caviar ha ha.  Was good, but probably not all that special.  But the blinis were different, unfortunately not in a good way.  I think normally they're more like crepes, but this time they were far thicker and stuffed with something.  Didn't look too pretty either.  Not very sophisticated tasting.  4/10\n\n6. Moulard Duck Breast $32 \"seared foie gras, blueberries, maroon carrots, ginger\":  MMMMMmmmmm.... one of the best duck breasts I've ever had!  So perfectly medium rare and tender.  And they did not skimp on the foie gras!--far bigger piece than most places, perfectly seared.  You'd figure duck foie gras with duck meat would be obvious, but I've never had that pairing!  And it's awesome.  Love the berries too.  Must have.  10/10\n\n7. Lamb Sirloin $36 \"chestnut and pumpkin seed risotto, foraged mushroom, celeriac\":  My gf loves lamb, coming for Northern China.  She gets lamb everywhere.  Saw this on the menu, and I knew it would be in front of her soon.  This version was plated very well, and looked elegant on top of the pretty vegetables.  Cooked great too.  I can't remember too much about it beyond that it was good though.  8/10\n\n8. Del Maguey \"Crema de Mezcal\" $9:  I rarely drink mezcal, but I figured I'd try something new this night.  This one is really unique--it's REALLY sweet.  I really doubt this is pure mezcal--must be a mixture of standard mezcal with some cream-soda liqueur put in post-fermentation?  I think might be too sweet for most tequila or mezcal drinkers, but certainly was interesting.  Worth a try.  6/10\n\n9. Raspberry Tarte Chaos $11 \"pastry cream, white chocolate, kumquat sorbet\":  My gf and I have had some very nice dessert \"messes\" in Canada.  I think that's the thing up there.  But compared to those, this one falls a bit short I think.  6/10\n\n10. Huckleberry Chocolate Mousse $11 \"snickerdoodle, meringue, passion fruit sorbet\":  Only had a bite of this.  Great mousse, but felt a bit lacking overall I think.  7/10\n\nSo I hope these notes help you pick the better dishes.  Yummy!\n\n4/5\n\n#americanfusion", "author": "Dean C."}

My partner has dined here several times before and felt that the food was sub-par and expensive; therefore we never dined here. However, I managed to lure him out to dine here during RW and like a good sport he agreed.\n\nStarters: Ahi tuna tar tar and Mushroom ravioli. I was VERY pleasantly surprised that my ravioli arrived with shaved truffles on top. Score!! I liked the ahi as well but I was so occupied by my earthy dish that I only remembered to get one bite of it.\n\nMain: Jumbo prawns. Wow, these are pretty big. The filet mignon was prepared quite nicely. \n\nDessert: The lime posset is where it is at!!

Many of the restaurants gave you an optional preset menu to enjoy at a reasonable price. My friend booked us for Twenty Five Lusk and I was excited to try a new joint! \n\nThe restaurant is nice. Located in an alley, once you enter, you'll notice a very romantic setting. Two floors of dining and bar options, lots of low lit lighting and ample seating. The service was on point as well. Our server, although I can't remember his name was super awesome. Always checked into our table and always made himself available which I really appreciated. \n\nFor the menu, they offered a 3 course meal for $40. For the first course, I decided to get the ahi tuna tartare: tuna with cucumbers, red onions and served with an avocado mousse and a rice crisp. This was a great starter! The crisp helped to scoop the tuna up and add the mousse for a creamy topping. My second or main course, I chose the Grilled Wagyu New York Strip, for an up sell of an addition $16. Served with a sweet potato mousse, pickled potato syrah reduction and a steak cooked to perfection, I was in heaven. It was also served with a popover roll to help mop up the sauce and juices. Great! My last course, I got the salted caramel swirled brownie, served with a mint chocolate chip ice cream. I love how they took such simple classics and spruced it up a bit with technique and presentation. Great job!\n\nOverall, the food was excellent, the service was fantastic so I need to give this place a 5 star!

Unassuming from the outside, the interior reads a different story. I was amazed by the beautiful decor. The upstairs floor has table seating while downstairs has low level tables and comfy seats where it's more ideal for groups that come to talk and unwind over drinks. \n\nFrom the prix-fixe menu ($40 dinner), I chose the Ahi Tuna Tartare, Fried Chicken Terrini, and the Salted Caramel Swirled Brownie. My BF also started with the Ahi Tuna Tartare, steak (I forgot the name of the dish), and Lime Posset. We also went with the half pour wine pairing ($20). Each of these dishes were amazing. You cannot go wrong with any of the options on the menu. The tartare was flavorful, while the fried chicken was tender and juicy. Both desserts were delicious.

The plates were fine starting with a mushroom cheesecake compliments of the chef topped with sriracha sauce. We then ordered Taro chips and octopus appetizers. Chips were a bit salty and octopus bland and charred. My risotto was overpowered with lemon flavors but my husband's flat iron steak was tender for the cut albeit under seasoned. Desserts were the 3 sampler with a cucumber sorbet which we didn't care for, brownie and pineapple sorbet which was fine and pears with another sorbet which was tough and runny. Altogether I gave it four stars for the service, ease of reservation, ambiance  and effort.", "author": "Nina P."}

Fortunately, our brunch experience this time around was much more eventful than our first encounter. \n\nTucked away on 25 Lusk Street, I dig the intimate and cozy ambiance and I cannot help but continually take pleasure in its seductive, industrial-chic design. \n\nThis time around we had the opportunity to try: \n\n+ Grilled Organic Banana: Tasty, subtly sweet small plate with fresh berries and refreshing raspberry sorbet. Light pre-brunch appetizer. \n\n+ Maine Lobster Benedict: Due to my recent dietary restrictions, I had to request for my eggs over-medium and the kitchen happily obliged. Though one of my husband's eggs was overcooked, the other egg on his plate was perfectly poached. There was a generous piece of tender lobster and the slightly crispy and salty prosciutto was a lovely contrast. The hollandaise sauce was silky and flavorful. I really liked how crispy and fluffy the bread was! \n\n+ Hobbs Breakfast Sausage:  There was a spice in here I could not pin point, its aroma was quite distinctive, in a good way. \n\nOur server, Jessie, was exceptional throughout the experience. Always smiling and he made sure to periodically check-in on us. I was impressed that he remembered to accomodate my request regarding my breakfast plate. I also applaud the professional Assistant General Manager, Josh, for visiting each of the tables to graciously acknowledge each patron.

Located off the main street, it's neatly tucked away at 25 Lusk Street (get it?).  \n\nPretty much got to sample everything on the restaurant week menu from my friends.  The tuna tartare was great, lots of subtle flavoring with a nice rice crisp.  Texture was a little bit on the soft slimy side, but I still found it to be very tasty.  The mushroom ravioli was also full of flavor.  Nice dish, but between the appetizers, the tuna tartare was my pick.  \n\nFor my entree, I had the shrimp and grits.  I really enjoyed these because I really love grits.  The shrimp had an excellent charred taste that went great with the grits.  Really wish I had gotten the fried chicken though, that was the real winner among the entrees in my opinion.\n\nFor dessert I had the lime posset, which is basically like a custard-like dessert.  It was a dish I had never gotten to try, but I loved it!  The champagne ice made this dessert a really unique experience.  It was funny because I initially thought the dessert was just ice and fruit, but the custard covered the entire surface of the plate.\n\nThe whole dining experience was great here.

This feeling is still achieved even though they seem pretty lenient on the dress code because I had no issue with a pair of dark jeans and a polo shirt.\n\nThe moderately lit lounge is very classy with clean furniture, a clean polished/brushed metal fireplace and a bunch of small lounge tables to rest your drinks/bites on.  This is definitely \"upscale chill\".  I'm a huge fan of the clean and modern layout.  After checking it out, I decided to take a seat at the bar.\n\nUnfortunately I just missed the Saturday 5-7 Happy Hour which included a couple discounted beers (which I was really looking forward to) and I think some bar bites and a discounted cocktail.  However, they still had some decent pricing on beers as well as a pretty unique cocktail list.  \n\nAfter poring over some of the cocktail options, I asked for some advice from my friendly and informative bartender.  Since I'm more of a beer drinker, I don't like overly sweet, watered down, sugary drinks.  So when I was trying to choose between a few options, by taking my tastes and preferences into consideration, she recommended the Mulberry Street. \n\nThe Mulberry Street($12) consists of Bulleit Rye, campari, vermouth, orange bitters, burnt orange.  This was the perfect recommendation. Despite its less than masculine appearance, the drink was strong, very \"spirity\", had a nice touch of citrus bitterness and they ignite part of the orange peel with flint and a spark. A stiff alcoholic beverage combined with playing with fire?  That's my kind of cocktail!\n\nOverall, I wish I could have spent more time here and I easily would have if I had adhered to my original projected schedule and hit this place up for HH. Unfortunately I was running behind and had a lot on the agenda for the evening my stay was limited.  However, based on my short time here I'd definitely recommended it for afternoon drinking and great service from the bartenders.  \n\nSimply put, I'm a fan!", "author": "Jeff S."}

The lighting is slightly dimmed more than usual to add a layer of privacy for the customers, and the noise level was moderate to loud. Great staff; and the service was attentive. great vibe for a dinner meeting, date, or celebration.\n\nWe decided on several dishes:\n\n- For appetizers: we started with Brussel Sprouts, Grilled Octopus, and Grilled Scallop\n- Main course I ordered their Wagyu Beef fillet, Duck Breast, with rosemary scallop potatoes, and seared tuna salad\n\n- I was not a fan of the Brussel Sprouts. They were dry and unmemorable with too much seasoning; definitely not my favorite dish.\n\n- The scallop was the right size; for what we paid, I would have liked there to be two or three more scallops included. But it was cooked just so (succulent and wonderful). I'm not a cauliflower lover in general, but the cauliflower was paired perfectly with the scallop. Excellent dish. \n\n- Octopus is usually never cooked right; either it's too mushy or overcooked, or it's not cooked enough. Lusk got it right, no complaints from me.\n\n- Wagyu is usually something I often view as overrated; I love Wagyu beef overseas, but I usually don't order it state-side. This fillet was good, but not the best Wagyu I've ever had. What shocked me was what it was paired with was just as enjoyable as the fillet. The beef was cooked with (fried pomegranate seeds?) and cooked grapes. The succinct flavor of those two items with the fillet worked so well; I would've never thought to pair those two items together. \n\n- The duck breast was exceptional. No other word appropriately describes it. Almost nothing else needs to be said. The seared foie gras was a great pairing. After speaking to the wait staff, the duck is their signature dish, also one of the most ordered items on the menu.\n\n- The seared tuna salad was good, and neither the lettuce or tuna overpowered the dish. Not bad, but the dish was too small for the price.\n\nDefinitely a place I plan on returning to. Great restaurant.", "author": "Brandon O."}

Megan was our server, and although friendly, it was clear she was overworked/not getting support from her team (this was our observation, NOTHING she said). \n\nAnyway, I ordered the caviar and my fianc\u00e9 ordered the tuna tartare. The caviar and blinis were to die for. Seriously. The tuna on the other hand tasted like it had lived in a bowl of sesame oil it's entire life. It made us sad, as the quality of tuna was incredible, but it couldn't be tasted. \n\nFor the main courses, she had the risotto, I had the prawns. Her risotto was good, not great. It had far far far too much lemon and wasn't anything memorable. As for the prawns, my first fish was cold which I sent back. The second try was much better, and I'll say, it was an excellent dish as well as an interesting take on shrimp and grits. \n\nFor dessert, she ordered the brownie and ice cream, I ordered the lime posset. Anyway, the brownie tasted store bought with some salt thrown on top. Nothing special and certainly not worth the calories. I'd never had a lime posset, and I did enjoy it. \n\nThe bill came to $150 (with a bottle of wine). Nothing was comped, even though I did watch my partner eat all but two bites of her dish before I got mine. Once brought to our servers attention, the manager did take off our bottle of wine. That said, I should not have had to say anything considering the circumstances. When I did say something, I was told that the manager said \"we brought him new prawns\". Ummmmm!!?\n\nOverall, Twenty Five Lusk was okay. I enjoyed my courses, but the service (no fault of our servers) and my fianc\u00e9's food left much to be desired. The entrees on the normal menu average $35 each, and there is not a snowball chance in....well, you know, that I'd ever pay that to eat here again. \n\nIt's never a good feeling to walk past Taco Bell on 3rd and say, we should've eaten there and saved $100+", "author": "Andrew B."}

However, I've also dined here once, and never again would I order any food from the menu - unless it's a dish you can't mess up, for example fries. \n\nI ordered the cod, and it couldn't get any more tasteless than that. I'm not a great cook, but even I can make yummier cod! I felt fooled because the dish looked appetizing and aesthetically pleasing for a $$$ restaurant, but was too dry for me to enjoy.\n\nA few weeks ago, I tried giving it another chance because it was the closest bar to Omakase with a nice ambiance. I ordered the Salami/Cheese dish with bread (I forgot the exact name). The Salami and bread were terrific, but the 3 cheeses they offered were absolutely terrible. \n\n1. They didn't specify on the menu which cheeses were in the dish.\n2. We found out it was Blue Cheese, Goat Cheese, and something else I forget. But really? Blue cheese and Goat Cheese have got to be two of the most common types of cheeses that people actually DISLIKE, including me.\n3. We asked if they had Parmesan in the kitchen and if we could use that as a substitute, but they told us that option was not available for us.\n4.

I noticed he did not ask us to taste the wine, just poured, and did not show the label or even state the wine.  Too bad, as we often do big events and many of our folks are invested in restaurants - real ones, like SBP and Single Thread.\n\nFood - 1/5.  Octopus was good but the sauce was gummy and odd.

Once for Restaurant Week and once for my husband's holiday party when they rented out the entire space.  Both times, the service was absolutely excellent and the food was great too.  Service is efficient, friendly, and considerate.  Love their complimentary bread too--it's a savory and herby focaccia!  The space is gorgeous as well with both an upper and lower level.  The lower level is more suitable for a lounge.\n\nAt the holiday party, they had both passed appetizers and a buffet dinner.  All of the food was fantastic.  Of the passed hors d'oeuvres, my favorites were the delicious king crab wraps, savory cheesecake topped with truffles, and fried squash bites served with cheese mousse.  I was impressed by the service and how many servers they had passing hors d'oeuvres...it's common to have to hunt down servers for food but they were excellent at making sure that everyone was served and that the food was plentiful!  During the buffet dinner, the highlight was the mushroom ravioli--simply delicious!  They also served some delicious salmon that was perfectly cooked (not overdone which is amazing for large-scale buffet-style food).  Everyone was stuffed by the end of dinner!\n\nThe drinks served were also great, although they did vary a bit in quality depending on which bartender you had.  I quickly learned to stick with the bartenders that I liked and trusted: David and Brian.  My husband had ordered an Old-Fashioned from both David and a different bartender, and David's was by far better.  I like to experiment with my cocktail drinks, rather than going with standard recipes--mostly because I forget the names of drinks and I'm not too much of a fan of any of the \"classics\", and so after communicating to David my preferences...something fruity but not too sweet/acidic, I was pleasantly surprised by all of the cocktails that I drank that night.  My favorites were the Grapefruit Gimlet (so fragrant, not too sour surprisingly, and well-balanced) and the seasonal Absinthe & Juniper (which David created for the menu!).  I was awed by the way Brian ran the grapefruit rind around the glass which left a fragrant mark whenever I drank a sip.  It was simply art!  The Absinthe & Juniper was surprisingly addictive...the creamy foam on top balanced so well with the acidity, the juniper gin, and elderflower.  I found out later that the creamy foam was due to egg white--fancy!  I would definitely return for happy hour in the lounge!", "author": "Jess Y."}

The waitress was very friendly and answered questions we had on the menu and made great recommendations.\n\nI skipped the appetizers because it was mainly seafood and let them enjoy theirs. We had champagne and I ordered a cocktail. It was the SF yacht club which I wish I ordered up because I never finish my drink when it's on the rocks. It's refreshing but I dislike ice. The wait for dinner was really really long. Service is great but slow. I was thinking it had to do with how fancy they make the plates look and the artistic time they put into it. When our food finally came out the presentation definitely was beautiful.\n\nI had the pork tenderloin which originally came over dumplings but I substituted it for the potato fingerlings. My dish was really tasty. From the pork to the small additions to it like the pear it was very different from any pork dish I have ever tasted. My man had the New York steak over bone marrow and with duchess potato. I had a bite of his steak and it was pretty good! Of course we have had better and although he loves steak he preferred the taste of my dish. Our friend had the ahi tuna which he seemed to enjoy.\n\nWe decided to have dessert which also was a pretty long wait. I think it worked out because they were talking business but if you want a quick dinner this is definitely not the place. It's great for long dates and when you need to converse with someone and don't want to feel rushed! \n\nThe dessert was worth the wait and was sweet, light and perfect to end dinner with. We got the trio of sorbets which I highly recommend. It came with passion fruit, raspberry and kumquat. All delicious but the passion fruit is amazing! A delightful treat! We also shared the passion fruit sorbet and chocolate mousse which was also amazing.\n\nAll in all I had a fun experience, minus the wait time, and would definitely come back if we have the time to have a long intimate dinner.

So interesting that I wasn't sure how to eat it.  The blinis (Russian pancakes) look like mini pancakes, except much more savory--when spread with the caviar, ikura, creme fraiche, feathery sprig of dill, and finely chopped onions, it was a unique combination of flavors and textures.  A flavor explosion, along with literal mini-explosions of the ikura like popping boba (oh wait, I guess this review for such a classy place may not cater to the undergrad population familiar with Tpumps popping boba...)\n\nGrilled octopus - radish, avocado, marigold, kumquat, mint, basil: The highlight was the octopus cooked precisely such that each segment had a different taste, ranging from succulent at one end to crispy at the tip.  The various assorted vegetables were alright; in my opinion more for garnishes to make the octopus prettier.  The kumquat was very much sweetened like marmalade, the avocado was kind of random and didn't seem to match the flavor profile, and I'm not sure whether or not the marigold flower was supposed to be eaten.\n\nStorm Hill ribeye - fondant potato, winter vegetable, bone marrow apple compote: Although I generally prefer filet mignon and flank, I thought the ribeye was very tender and tasty, though medium rare was quite raw and some parts of it looked like sashimi.  Overall it had a nice balance of sweet, tart, savory, and smokey with the apple bone marrow compote.  I also appreciate how it was a reasonable portion and not an abstract few bites.  And on a side note, their steak knives are awkward... it's heavy and round so it slides right into your plate.  Just a heads-up so you don't ruin the classy ambiance by making clumsy noises with your steak knife.\n\nChef selection of artisan cheese: I don't know much about cheese, but I'll say that my wine-and-cheese-savvy friends were happy.  There was just not quite enough bread for such a strong chunk of cheese,especially considering that the bread was the type with large holes in it.  It also came with a smear of unspecified jam, a fig, a dried cherry, and a flower which I was again hesitant to eat.\n\nMilk chocolate mousse - hazelnut ice cream, espresso anglaise: The hazelnut ice cream was delicious, and the chocolately powder on the side was like an oreo ice cream topping from your blissful childhood memories.  The mousse had a nice fluffliness and was impressively cut into a perfect triangle, but in my opinion it was way too sweet and I couldn't really taste anything else.\n\nThe food was good and you have an appreciation for how much thought was put into it, but what bumped up the overall dining experience to the fancypants price tag were the very aesthetic presentation and exceptional service.  \n\n[THE SERVICE]\n\n- You feel so pampered being individually served bread, and the servers will not judge you if you ask for one of each for all three choices \n- They did double check everyone's food allergies for the prix fixe when dinner started, but I wish they also asked us for steak preferences instead of serving it medium rare for everyone and then asking after the fact whether that was alright (no one wants to be THAT person...)\n- Nothing fancier than having multiple water options o.O\n- They served each course with a flair of fanfare: the group of servers come with a plate in each hand and synchronize in setting the food down \n\n[THE VIBE]\n\nThe location a bit random in an alleyway behind a Safeway parking lot and tough-looking valet that I mistook for bouncers.  You almost get a speakeasy vibe with the nondescript brick facade and the address-turned-restaurant name.  The interior retains an industrial warehouse feel reminiscent of the Alchemist, with exposed wooden beans, metal accents, and high ceiling, but it does not fall short of being extravagant and loungey.  25 Lusk = good for 25-year-olds with a Lust for fancy food and a swanky ambiance.\n\n[THE VERDICT]\n\nWell-rounded and worth a try.  Disclaimer that I am a n00b at fine dining though, so my review may be more entertaining than it is useful.", "author": "Edna C."}

The food is other worldly and an experience unto itself which I will get to in a minute. \nMy friend made a reservation for 6:45PM for my Birthday Dinner. To me that was amazing, just being able to find a beautiful space to have a little dinner party and anyone that knows me understands that food to me is love. This is love on high. Clearly Chef Dolan and his partner in crime Bourdon know what they are doing! I love their philosophy and passion for creating an overall experience with food that shows off phenomenal flavors and unexpected surprises. This is not for the faint of heart, if you're bringing a Burger King budget; you are not really ready for this experience. IF you want a forever imprint on your life, this is the place; at least for me. \nWe sat at the 'Clark' table, in the dining room; upstairs by the window. Perfection! Then we met David, our wonderful, sarcastically funny server. He was playful but knew when to pullback and provided a tour of words through the history of the restaurant without sounding 'canned' and although he had another large party next to us; most would never know that. The service was spot on, slow enough to enjoy and we never had a lull where we felt forgotten; our water (sparking) was always full, wine (Rose, our own, Pinot Noir, Muscato) was topped off, drinks (Canival en Oaxa, Camomile Tea, Espresso), were flowing, food was placed perfectly all in-front  of us at the same time (nice touch)! BUT THE FOOD!!! THE FOOD Was incredible!\nStarting off with taro chips with garlic dip and some yummy Togarshi popcorn which was delightful with that amazing Japanese shichimi spice and some nori on top!\nThen we decided on a bunch of apps to share. We tried the baby lettuce and endive with crispy sunchokes, fennel and an amazing blood orange vinaigrette that I could have had by the cupful. A black trumpet mushroom ravioli with English peas, chipolini onion, Thai basil and truffles that was dynamite and not 'heavy' feeling. The tuna tartare with pineapple, cilantro, avo, mint and cilantro was to die for and again not 'heavy' feeling. Light and so fresh! Pork Belly what was crispy and juicy underneath. Foie Gras that was served with raspberry jam and crispy toast was one of my favorite things to eat overall. It was divine! Then there was the grilled octopus which I never would have ordered but on the recommendation of David; nice surprise, perfectly cooked and the lobster navarin (French Ragout w/Potatoes) accompaniment was a nice paring! That was my favorite dish of the evening. For our mains we had the Arctic Char with green onion marmalade (so good), black rice and hearts of palm. I really liked the bite I had of it, well prepared and the jam made the rice so delicious I could see eating the whole thing. The Sakura pork tenderloin was nothing short of a party in the mouth. The pork, bacon vinaigrette and egg bite was definitely a suare that you want to participate in over and over again! My friend ordered the fried chicken and I didn't try it, but she didn't complain and cleared her plate so it must have been excellent :). I had the roasted duck breast with pickled pumpkin, roasted shallot, endive and dark apple ginger glaze. It was so yummy, probably the best entree of duck I have ever had. I also ordered green beans with hoisin sauce and pancetta  for the table, super surprisingly great for green beans. That sauce should be bottled and sold because it was a hit! \nThere was also dessert. Deconstructed red velvet cake, a pear parfait and a sampling of deserts. While it's not my 'thing' to eat dessert anymore, I did try everything and if you like that sort of thing I highly recommend the parfait, everything else is okay but a waste of carbs!\nOverall, 25 Lusk exceeded expectations. I'm told they are opening a rooftop deck which will make this a destination restaurant for Giants games, locals looking to celebrate life and people from everywhere that want to experience what makes San Francisco so great!", "author": "Sherie R."}

I've never felt so forgotten about at a restaurant in my life. Forget about servers waiting tables... it was guests waiting on service. The worst part is that there were several empty tables within the restaurant. The food was decent however I didn't quite understand the menu. It was just a lot of fusion and not everything made sense or went together. It was difficult to pick an appropriate cocktail or wine for the food options. The radish salad was nice and the octopus was cooked perfectly but I feel the sausage could've been cut smaller, cooked crispier, and the popcorn maybe left off the dish all together. The accompaniments just didn't make sense - Spanish with Japanese could be done well but just a lot of salt. I loved my ravioli and my fianc\u00e9's dish, the pork rib chop, was delicious. Maybe we went on an off night but it was as if they only cared about the guests they already knew... also I find it funny their vision for French and Italian influences are not found on their menu full of Asian and Hispanic influence.

The lighting was warm and relaxing, the seating was nice for comfort and communication, and the general vibe was just very enjoyable. \n\nThe food was amazing. My meal, from start to finish:\n1. Complementary fennel pudding with blackberry on top. Very small and surprisingly delicious. I was skeptical because I don't like fennel, but I was actually sad that I finished it because I wanted more.\n2. Complementary bread, seemed like focaccia. Normally I wouldn't point out the bread but it deserves some praise.\n3. I ordered the ravioli, which had black mushrooms, truffle butter, parmesan reggiano, and some other things. AMAZING.\n4. Wagyu. This was outstanding. Came with some cauliflower, leeks, bone marrow hollandaise. I ordered medium rare and it came much more rare than expected, but no complaints on my end because it was so very good.\n5. Salted caramel swirled brownie with mint chocolate chip ice cream and coffee syrup. The brownie was good, but a little dry and dense. I wish it came warm and was a little less dry. The coffee syrup was so good, so that plus the ice cream really helped the brownie out.\n\nI tried a bit of my friend's risotto after hearing her exclaim how amazing it was for the entire meal.

I have to say, the reviews do not lie. I absolutely loved it.\n\n25 Lusk is an upmarket, classy restaurant/bar with romantic, dim lighting and a modern interior. I really liked the feel of the place and all the waiters were very professional. The bar also makes drinks from scratch, so if you're waiting for your table, it's a lot of fun to see the bartenders skillfully put together drinks; all of which are DELICIOUS although they do go pretty light on the alcohol. \n\nFood: Gorgeous and appetizing! Yum! We thoroughly enjoyed every single course, there was not one bad dish thrown in there.\n\nAmuse Bouche: Tomato chutney and Mozzarella. The mozzarella was fresh and creamy and perfectly complemented the tomato, tasted like a bite of satisfying pasta.\n\nAppetizer: \n1. Caviar - This dish was delicious, the bread/pancake was fried light and crispy and AMAZING and paired perfectly with the creme fraiche and caviar. SO GOOD. \n2. Ravioli - I really don't like ravioli because I find it to be too doughy most of the time, but the ravioli was really good. It tasted like little dumplings in the most DELECTABLE mushroom sauce ever. \n\nEntree:\n1. Grilled Tiger Prawns - succulent and perfectly seasoned! It's so easy to over do prawns, but this dish was just perfectly balanced and amazing. I loved it.\n2. Duck Breast - tender, flavorful and delicious. Meat can always be tricky, but I thought this was cooked perfectly, I really can't find anything bad to say about any of the food here.\n\nDessert\n1. Kiwi Lime Foam(?) - I really liked this dish - it was interesting and had a nice citrus punch to it to end off the meal - there were also bits of kiwi in it which made for nice texture. A very refreshing and interesting dessert.\n2. Caramel Brownie - I enjoyed the brownie bites - perfect if you want to end the meal with something decadent.

After being a guest of the house last night, I have plans to return on my own very soon. Yes, it was just that good!\n\nThe mood? \nDark and industrial, yet I never felt cold or unwelcome. Booths are spacious and comfy. Our server was attentive and offered tons of helpful suggestions, everything from his favorite menu items to wine pairings. FOH manager came by to check on us as well as Chef Matthew Dolan and their sommelier.  \n\nStarters: \n1) Slow Roasted Pork Belly with maple mole, runner beans and lime crema. The lime crema made the dish! Normally I don't *love* pork belly, but the slow cooked version was more like a fancy pulled pork (which, technically, I guess it was!) It fell apart with the gentle nudge of a spoon and fork, fantastic! \n\nPaired with a German Riesling\n\n2) California Caviar and Blinis with dill and creme fraiche. Decadent! I could eat this dish all by itself as a meal. This is when Chef Dolan came out to explain his special recipe for the buckwheat Blinis, which comes from a stint in Russia. Perfectly cooked, no complaints. Give me more now!\n\nPaired with French Champagne\n\nMains:\n1) Grilled Gulf Prawns with togarashi grits, watercress, carrot culis, horseradish vinaigrette.

Sourced from a part of the Indian Ocean left untouched for 40 years due to the Sri Lankan civil war (thus a comparatively pristine environment), this yellow fin tuna is line caught in deep water (protects dolphins and sea turtles) using a large hook (only mature fish harvested, the population remains robust) and immediately air-shipped (water to table in 24 hours) on ice (never frozen) in a temperature controlled environment. The demand for this product is such that, until now, all the available fish has been sent to the renowned Tsukiji market in Japan because of the high price that it commands.\"\n\nNeedless to say, I've never had anything like it! \n\nDessert:\nQuince cake with an espresso cocktail. At this point, we were just being gluttonous, but of course finished the entire thing. \n\nPretty much every dish was destroyed within minutes, could have licked the plate clean at the end of each course.

The brownie was also my least favourite course - it was far too sweet, sticky, and dense, to the point that it was difficult to remove bite-sized portions with my fork. I enjoyed the accompanying mint chocolate ice cream though. I also enjoyed the glass of chardonnay I got to go with the prawns.\n\nService was fine, attentive without being overbearing but a tad colder than expected. \nWater replenishing was more frequent than average though. Although I did enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant as well as the meal, I felt that although there wasn't really anything wrong with my dining experience, it was just slightly lacking. I was not exactly wowed by any of my courses, and while there's nothing wrong with being just good - maybe it was that ginger emulsion, maybe it was that overly sticky brownie, or maybe just because it was Restaurant week - I have to admit that in the end I was hoping for something a little more, hence the 3-star rating.", "author": "Oliver L."}

I've been here before for drinks and the finger food had been excellent, albeit pricey, but still quite worth it in the opinion. I distinctly remember that the pretzel was especially delicious and the cocktails were all outstanding. \n\nI came back during restaurant week to try the food and I remain very impressed. Although the appetizer we wanted, the ahi tuna tartare, had ran out, the mushroom ravioli was very well made. For entree, I had the fried chicken terrine and it was terrific. The skin was crispy and the meat was soft, while the arugula salad went great with the sauce. My friend's grilled shrimp was also quite fresh, although there was not enough sauce for her dish and it was a bit plain. For dessert, we had the caramel brownie, which was quite good, although I did find that the caramel taste overpowered by the chocolate. \n\nStill, with the great environment and ambiance (note: it's a tad bit dark in there), as well as the high quality food and drinks, I highly recommend this restaurant bar.", "author": "Michelle Y."}

The service was really slow and it took forever to get our drinks.\n\nOnce we got seated, upstairs, the food was good, but not exceptional.  We were served focaccia bread and some goat cheese squares.  Pretty good.  There were items on the menu they had run out of, which was disappointing.  I ordered the pork chops which was ok.  They brought out the dishes for the people I was with, but forgot about my dish.  Once I got the dish, they forgot to bring out cutting utensils.  This was pretty annoying, considering this is a high end restaurant.

Fantastic.  The first time I had dinner here, I ordered the foie gras.  I was hooked from the gate.  Clearly, that is no longer on the menu, but it conveys the tone of Lusk's concept; rich & indulgent, yet attainable.

The lounge downstairs is also beautiful, but it can get rowdy in that bridge & tunnel kind of way.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-02-09", "description": "All dressed up and no place to go. No, not me, I'm talking about the still sleek Twenty Five Lusk with its cool industrial decor and expansive downstairs lounge. If you want modern architectural chic (photo: http://bit.ly/NqlzrZ), there are few places in the city that compete with it. I was there for a business dinner over the holidays, and having attended a few neighborhood association cocktail parties in the lounge area over the years, I finally graduated to the mezzanine and experienced a complete meal there. However, despite the posh veneer and the culinary conviction of our British waiter, the food was all over the map when it came to execution and flavor. I guess some places are satisfied with looking good.\n\nWe were first served a modest amuse bouche of a Cornichon swimming in a spoonful of a Saffron Mussel Bisque (photo: http://bit.ly/1f7OFlP). Appetizers were rather on the predictable side for a restaurant of this genre. First came the $18 Tempura Octopus with Blue Lake Beans and Ginger in a Calamondin Sesame Vinaigrette and then the $19 Nantucket Bay Scallops diced with Alba Truffles, Pea Shoots and Lemon Butter (photo: http://bit.ly/1lSaHlH). Neither did anything to transcend my palate, but there was one standout, the $4 ramekin of Mini-Cauliflower Creme Brulee in White Truffle Oil with Baby Pickled Vegetables (photo: http://bit.ly/LNrxBp), which managed to meld the sweet and savory into a pre-dessert treat.\n\nIt went well with the generous slice of Cornbread that a second waiter plucked with a pair of tongs from the mobile bread plate (photo: http://bit.ly/1eLCIFW). Entrees came next, and again predictability was the keyword. The indulgent $36 Grilled Aged New York Steak was a tad overcooked even with lubricants as stylish as Fondant Potato and Lobster Maitre d'Hotel Butter (photo: http://bit.ly/1eH5gC9). Slices of the $30 Llano Seco Pork were laid on top of a Potato Rosti covered liberally with a Garlic Sauce and accompanied by sweetened sides like Carrot Ginger Coulis and Cranberries (photo: http://bit.ly/MD5H4b). Plane food. Business class but still plane food. \n\nThe $33 medallions of Seared Ahi Tuna came with Quail Eggs prepared sunny-side up with Haricots Verts and Smoked Potato, all of is in a Golden Beet Coulis (photo: http://bit.ly/1llyQNK). The tuna was fresh, but the combination was rather bland. My entree was marginally the best, the 38 North Duck with Scarlet Turnip Green, Royal Trumpets, Hazelnut Glaze and Kaffir Sauce ($32) (photo: http://bit.ly/1h1G37l). The duck itself was succulent and the portion quite generous, but the accompanying flavors were fussy and distracting. The $11 desserts came just in time. The Toasted Carrot Cake was appropriate for the holiday season, and the canela of Orange Cumin Ice Cream and Ginger Emulsion provided a nice contrast (photo: http://bit.ly/1bhmHsE).\n\nThe Valrhona Milk Chocolate Mousse was the expected chocolate option with a canela of Mandarin Sorbet and a Pomegranate Coulis (photo: http://bit.ly/1lSbov9). Different focal point, same treatment. Sometimes the simpler, the better, and in this case, it proved to be true. The best was the Passionfruit Posset, just a trio of sorbets - Kiwi, Mint and Champagne Granita - and nothing else (photo: http://bit.ly/LNrQvZ). At the end of the meal, the memory of it was already dissipating, but there is no doubt the place looks like a place that should be serving great cuisine. The imbalance of the risk-averse flavors, no matter how decoratively presented they are, appears to be the impasse that chef Matthew Dolan hasn't quite conquered.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...uneven execution makes the food less than memorable here\nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...the architecture and decor are the real stars\nSERVICE - 3 stars...masters of the oversell\nTOTAL - 3 stars...sometimes it's better to look good than to taste good...it's the Fernando Lamas of SF restaurants", "author": "Ed U."}

Leading up to the wedding I was getting worried because from the start communication on their end was lacking, but I had a gut feeling that the wedding day would run smoothly because every time I would visit for dinner or to run through the area I would constantly see the cooks prepping for the day and the servers meeting with the manager before service started. Each time I went for a meal the staff were so professional and made sure each dish was perfectly presented and we had no questions.\n\nThe wedding was on a weekend afternoon and the ceremony was downstairs with lunch being served in the main dining room upstairs. Looking at the pictures the lighting was perfect throughout the entire restaurant and the space was perfect for a group of about 80 people; although, you could probably fit 100 comfortably. \n\nWe really wanted our wedding to have good food because I hate when the food is so drab or overcooked at weddings so we went for tastings and gave our suggestions to the chef who was so open to ideas or changes. The chef is such a kind and humble individual. He assured us he would be there for our wedding working in the kitchen and sure enough when we looked over he was working right with everyone else plating.\n\nChristina worked with us the day of and made sure everything from the restaurant ran smoothly. She kept us on track with our billing behind the scenes and organized the seating for the ceremony so that there was space for an aisle and also so that everyone could see. She was such a delight to work with and definitely works hard.\n\nAt the end of the day our guests kept telling us how nice it was to be in a warm environment with friends and family without having to worry about moving from the ceremony to a reception hall at a separate location. Those who had the short ribs could not stop raving about them and I have to say the portions were actually huge! Many of our guests mentioned they had seen 25 lusk and wanted to try the food, but never made it out here and also that they wanted to come back to try more of the menu.

With the entrance hidden in a not too sketchy alleyway, you wouldn't know from first sight at the front just how beautiful it really is inside.\n\nThere's a chill lounge area downstairs, with metal fireplaces and cozy couches for you and your party to sit around and order small appetizers to go along with your drinks. The really cool part of the downstairs lounge area is that there are these cozy, more private and intimate areas for your party behind bar - you wouldn't even notice it unless you were guided to it or you went looking for it - but it's private rooms in a swanky restaurant.\n\nUpstairs, there's also a bar as well with some private dining sections for you and a larger party if you plan on staying here for dinner. \n\nWhile I'm discussing the interior of the restaurant, I have to admit, I think the prices are excessively high for the food - $3/oyster for some special oysters they said were seasoned off with [i forgot what it was but something], didn't really taste like anything, much less oysters. $15 for a hamachi sushi plate of 3 excessively thin and tiny pieces of fish felt a little ridiculous, and the bar upstairs serves neither strong nor unique cocktails.\n\nOverall this place deserves the hype for their intimate and private setup, but I wouldn't come here for the food. I'd bring a small party of mature 20 somethings here for a nice glass of wine or a few spirits to stay in the downstairs lounge area to have an intimate evening out in the city, but I wouldn't bother grabbing snacks here.", "author": "Zoe H."}

The squid ink vinaigrette was interesting because it was something I've never had. Definitely a unique dish.\n\nI had the Ahi Tuna for my main dish. It came with a fava leaf pesto, giner glazed baby carrots, avocado, uni and black garlic. The Ahi Tuna itself was cooked to a perfect rare temperature. It didn't have a lot of flavor to it, so it depended a lot on the fava leaf pesto and other pairings on the plate to dress it up for flavor.\n\nMy boyfriend had the Sear Muscovy Duck with asparagus, torpedo onion rings, nasturtium, and rhubarb reduction.

I'll rate dishes individually because they really varied: \n- Brioche apple donuts: get them!! 4 stars. They're soft sugar donuts stuffed with an cinnamon-y apple pie filling. You dip them in this chocolate sauce... And the dish comes with coffee. Coffee & donuts were made for each other \n- Octupus Benedict: 3 stars. biscuits were buttery, poached eggs were nicely gooey, generous hollandaise sauce. However, they give you only one large octopus tentacle and I wasn't a huge fan of how they cooked the octopus - it tasted a bit dry and a little burnt \n- the \"Breakfast\" dish: 2-3 stars. don't get this. The eggs are meh. The linguica sausage was good because you can't really go wrong with sausage. If you want to try the linguica just get it as a side. \n- Cost: they are about 1.5x more expensive than your average brunch place, and for that reason I give it an overall 3 because I don't think it's worth the markup.\n- Service is decent, though judging from other yelp reviews it varies. \n- A plus: unlike many other brunch places in SF, there was no wait on a Saturday at 12pm - and the restaurant was half empty.

Everything from the ambiance to the lighting to the crowd, I dug Twenty Five Lusk from the moment I stepped inside.\n\nAt an establishment like this, you might expect a snobbier staff but service was extremely friendly and our server was very attentive. I accidentally knocked over my glass of vino and she immediately replaced it with another full glass and hailed 2 other waitstaff members to help clean it up. She was so incredibly sweet about it, trying to make me feel better by joking about her own reputation about being clumsy amongst her friends.\n\nAs for the food, I thought that our grilled squid appetizer was very good (and worth ordering again), the side of greens was passable, and our individual portions of ahi tuna, while tasty, were much smaller than I anticipated.\n\nSo, would I come back here just to dine? Probably not. (Or at least show up only slightly hungry.) Would I come back here for drinks and some noshes? Abso-friggin-lutely.\n\nSide note: they tack on 18% gratuity, so watch for that.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-03", "description": "Lusk at first sight? Almost. \n\nLusk has the fortune of being able to make a play on its address name and spin the design around homonymnic connotations. Luxurious. Lush. Sleek. Sexy. The actual street doesn't inspire any of those things, being an easily overlooked alleyway. And it's a good thing for them that in reality, most of us probably don't know that \"lusk\" actually means lazy and slothful. \n\nThe doorman and valet are well-choreographed, sweeping open the door before you've even greeted them. (There's really no other reason you'd be on Lusk St.) I was disoriented at first by the sultry lighting and stairs leading both up and down. I learned later that the stairs down lead to the chill lounge area (with the iconic metal fireplaces), and the short trip up leads to the host. Part of the intimate vibe is kept by the fact that seating seems to be coordinated so that the tables were never all full - it feels hip without being too busy. Luckily we had a reservation since later parties had to wait while empty tables were slowly set up. But feel free to take advantage of the lounge, upstairs and downstairs bars, or chef-watching through the glass-walled kitchen. Even though I mentioned \"intimate\" earlier, it's really what you make of it - Lusk is a great place to come with a close friend or some colleagues after work, maybe even your mother-in-law. Overall, the clientele is fairly young.\n\nThe booths are so comfortable. As are the couches down below. And that's about all the knowledge my buttocks has on the seating options. On the menu - exteeeensiiive options for alcoholic drinks. Wines, whiskeys, tequilas, eaux de vie, custom cocktails... From the food menu, Lusk delves into both American and many international cuisines depending on what strikes the head chef's fancy. \n\nBefore and in between our courses, a waiter made the rounds to each table offering a small platter of even smaller breads. There were three bite-sized options: a muffin-shaped celery bread, a block of foccacia, and a round slice of wheat. All were surprisingly buttery-soft and went well with the provided butter and coarse salt. There was enough down-time for the server to make three visits to our table. Same waiter refilled our water frequently and wiped our table between courses. We also got two small cubes of what seemed to be a garlic goat cheese. Runners were all very amicable.\n\nTwo is the magic number for SF Restaurant Week (although our waiter kept referring to it by the old moniker Dine About Town) because you and your partner in crime/dine can try everything. Appetizers: 1) Local Caviar, presented in a delicate little mound next to the chopped onions and creme fraiche. I'm not much of a fan of the fishy taste (my bias), and found the blini a little to oily-tasting. 2) Wild Mushroom Ravioli, soaking deliciously in a sherry shallot butter, was creamy and soft while the pasta retained a lovely chewy texture. Even the bf thought it was \"good for a vegetarian dish\". Main Courses: small portions. 1) Roasted Duck, cooked once as a confit and once lightly pan-seared. The duck was a juicy medium rare and full of flavor. 2) Grilled Prawns, over a bed of saffron fregola and topped with a foamy ginger emulsion. A nice smoky flavor, but not blown away. The ginger didn't really seem to fit in. The creamy fregola grains ended up being my favorite part, and the tart saffron taste shines. Desserts: 1) Lime Posset, a runny, yogurt-like dish topped with layers of champagne ice (not to fret if you didn't order alcohol, because you'll taste it here). Kind of fun to eat as you tilt the plate to scoop up the last precious drops. I picked out the mint leaves, but the citrus and kiwi are a refreshing end note. 2) Salted Caramel Swirled Brownie, two small pieces with a scoop of mint chocolate chip ice cream, one raspberry and one blackberry. The brownies were good, not amazing, but the interesting part was found in the pop rock-like crumble under the ice cream. It crackles pleasantly in your mouth and contrasts with the creaminess of the ice cream. \n\nIf you made it this far into my essay, you must be one of those dedicated people who wants to know about the bathrooms. :) Head down any staircase to the lower floor, locate an alcove under the kitchen with a potted plant in the center. The ladies' room continues the chic, black theme with two stalls and another full-sized door that leads to a handicapped stall. As far as I could tell from the dim lighting, it was clean, but unfortunately didn't have an air freshener. And only three toilets at a happening lounge/restaurant? All the ladies will know how quickly a line can build up. \n\nIn my opinion, we got a fair deal for the dinner during Restaurant Week. I enjoyed the food, but will probably come back for the good vibes in the lounge in the future.", "author": "Helen S."}

The space is gorgeous and perfectly captures the urban/rustic mix we love so much about San Francisco itself.  We reserved the bottom floor, with a mix of banquet seating and lounge seating, which encouraged our guests to mix and mingle and made our wedding a fantastic party.  The secret tunnel of rooms behind the bar became our favorite feature of the night, too:  my (now) husband and I were able to hide back there during the dinner portion and enjoy our dinners in peace while peeking through the small window at our guests enjoying themselves in the main area, and later in the night groups of friends circulated back there, enjoying the secrecy of it all.    \n\nAnd while we chose Twenty Five Lusk because of the gorgeous space (and as noted above, it well exceeded our greatest hopes), the food and drinks were AMAZING ended up stealing the show.  Our guests STILL rave about how good the food and drinks were! \n\nAnd the service at Twenty Five Lusk was absolutely fantastic.  Planning a wedding is stressful, especially where you're doing all of the planning yourself (as we were), and Twenty Five Lusk went way above and beyond, even arranging for us the rental of cocktail-height tables and linens to match with our aesthetic.  And all of this--gorgeous space, divine food, fantastic service--at a fraction of what we would have paid for ANY other reception option in San Francisco (we know, because we did extensive research).  \n\nLike our decision to get married, choosing Twenty Five Lusk for our reception is one of the best decisions we've ever made.  We can't recommend them enough!", "author": "J B."}

It is really beautiful inside. We were upstairs for dinner but I would love to come back and check out the downstairs bar area for happy hour sometime. Definitely the perfect ambiance for a nice date night. \nIt was a little strange because it seemed really empty for a Friday night. There was only one more table in our section and by the time we finished eating we were the last ones in there. \n\nParking is tough around here, but they do have a valet if you choose to do that and make your life a little easier. It was $18 (credit/debit only) but definitely worth it for not having to circle around and look for parking. \nWe tried a few of their seasonal cocktails and really enjoyed them. The Basil and Mango was great! \n\nWe got a few starters that were outstanding. The blini and caviar were to die for. We seriously could have eaten those all night! Our server told us the blinis are made with yeast starter from Russia that is over 200 years old which is pretty cool. The lobster and mussels were also amazing. They brought out some complimentary focaccia and pretzel bites (so good) as well as a couple very small plates that the chef sent out for us to taste.\n\nWe ordered the fried chicken and the cod as our main courses, but both of them were a little lacking compared to all of the starters. I think if we would have stuck with a few more small plates to share instead we would have had a really amazing meal.  \n\nWe did the sampler for dessert and everything was good, but the Lime Posset really stood out! It's a nice light and refreshing dessert to finish off the meal with. \nOur total bill was almost $200 for 2 people, so dinner here is definitely going to cost you a bit.

I also hard some fried chicken type dish (sorry, dont recall the name) that was very good, as well as some sort of mushroom ravioli that was good as well. We sat at the bar and what was really nice was how great the service was. The bartender explained each wine during the wine pairing and provided just the right amount of communication/entertainment. This was the first time we were offered an amuse bouche and the whole idea of it blew us away. While this may seem standard to some high end foodies, this was such a pleasant surprise for us novices!

I had the grapefruit gimlet and the dark and stormy.  Highly recommend both, especially the dark and stormy!  bf had an old fashioned rye which he said was well made.  \n\nThey ran a little late on our reservation, but we were in no rush, we just stayed longer at the bar.  The food from the restaurant week menu was different from their regular menu.  We had the mushroom ravioli (not my favorite) and local caviar (very tiny portions) for our appetizers.  I wasn't too impressed with the appetizers, but the entree is what made up for it.  The duck breast with gooseberry reduction was delicious!  The gooseberries definitely went with the perfectly cooked duck breast. :)  Our waitress told us that even though that item isn't on their normal menu,  they had a very similar duck entree on their menu that she thought was just as good.  For dessert, we tried the salted caramel brownie (yummy, but nothing special), and the lime posset.  The lime posset was interesting.   It was like....melted lime sortbet.  Interesting texture, but good flavor, glad we got to try it.  \n\nOverall, I loved the service and ambiance.  The entrees and drinks were excellent!  I would come back just for that.

I had this fantastic smoked tequila drink with habanero. It kicked me in the back of the throat and then frenched me. So dang good. I had two. Woulda had three if it weren't a business dinner.\n\nWe each chose our own appetizers. I had the pork belly. Sweet baby Jeebus it was so good. Tender. Flavorful. Delish.\n\nFor dinner, I had an amazing bavette plate with a side of Brussels sprouts. I've never wanted thirds and fourths of Brussels sprouts so badly.\n\nFor dessert, I had the strawberry sliders. Now, there was a whole process to this dish that was supposed to give the sensation of a root beer float. I don't think I paid enough attention because I didn't get that. But it was yummy anyway. \n\nHighly, highly recommend!", "author": "Stephanie I."}

We'll just call it happy hour because it was right after work (early enough) despite the fact that Twenty Five Lusk doesn't have happy hour specials.  We were in the downstairs part of the restaurant which is the lounge.  It was a good size with a decent amount of seating.  We eventually took over the tucked away \"cave like\" area since we had a large group and it was more private.  I got a Stella ($6), he had an Allegash White ($8), and my friend had an SF Yacht Club ($11) cocktail, which was a vodka based cocktail that was perfectly balanced with just the right amount of sweet and sourness.  The three of us shared the Parmesan fries ($6)  served with an avocado puree dipping sauce, and the other which tasted like a slight truffled mustard sauce. \n\nFries were cooked well though i didnt taste much parmesan.  We enjoyed the dipping sauces.  He & I were starving so we decided to share the pork loin ($31).  The greens it was served with had a slight garlicky sweetness, and the meat was moist, but could have used some seasoning to help out the apple reduction.  It wasn't the best pork loin I've had but it was in the top 5.  One of my collagues' friends was telling us that she wasn't very impressed when she dined in the restaurant.  She was saying that the food isn't bad, but with SF having so many amazing restaurants competition is fierce and I totally agree.  With that being said Twenty Five Lusk may need to step it up a teeny bit.  \n\nDespite the prices being a little up there and there being no actual happy hour, Twenty Five Lusk is a nice low key lounge to have some drinks after work or after hours.  I wouldn't mind coming back to sit back and have a drink and soak up the atmosphere.", "author": "Cat C."}

On my visit, the service was friendly and informative without being obtrusive.

We made reservations for 4 but had to change our number to 5 people last minute and they accommodated us accordingly.  This place is great for drinks and nibbles in their lounge area which is so chic and transporting as Jessica T. mentioned.  \nHowever for dinner,  I think this place can use some help.   The portions are small and there was nothing memorable about the taste of any of our dishes.  To add to this the  prices are high.  I don't mind paying $$$ for good food but this place was a bit overpriced for the low quality of their dishes. \n\nI'm giving them 3.5 stars but rounding up to 4 because of the ambiance and service.  The service was wonderful and they definitely exceeded my expectations.  We told them that we were in a hurry so we can make the beginning of the show and although they still took awhile to come out with our dishes they communicated with us throughout our dining experience.  The Manager personally spoke to us and apologized that our dishes took so long but that they are working as fast as possible to get our food out as quickly as possible.   They were able to get our food out to us as quickly as possible and we made it to the concert just in time.  \n\nI might return for drinks and apps but not for dinner unless they change up their menu.  \nValet and street parking is available.

We married early at City Hall on Christmas Eve and couldn't have chosen a better location for private dining. Christine, the Director of Private Events, is probably the most professional events coordinator ever and made the whole process easy as pie! \n\nSo what was good? Since this is a restaurant, I'll start with the food. Our first course was an an arugula salad with pancetta and persimmons. Really an incredible pairing. The second course was a choice of king salmon with french beans and syrah braised short ribs with spaetzle. I, of course, tried and enjoyed both entrees while everyone at the table oohed and aahed and said it was the best [salmon/short ribs] they ever consumed. To top it all off for dessert was a salted caramel brownie with mint chocolate ice cream - I might dream about this dessert for weeks to come. The beverage options were also perfect - I really enjoyed the sparkling ros\u00e9 that was recommended and our guests appreciated the other wine, beer, and non-alcoholic beverages. Shout out to the back of the house for all of your hard work! \n\nLast, but definitely not least, the service at the front of the house was exceptional. I believe it was Rachael and Jesse who doted on us for the entire afternoon. It's not easy dealing with a large party of 23 people (three young children and an elderly grandmother included), but they pulled it off gracefully! \n\nThanks to everyone involved.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-23", "description": "NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE LOUNGE BAR EXPERIENCE DOWNSTAIRS.  \nSo word has it that a fellow DJ by the artist name of Xipil has been mixing a different kind of music in the form of cocktail alchemy.  You know, a good dj is a master of mixology so when you infuse the thought processes of mixing, sense of aesthetics, knowledge of materials, and the art of flow to cocktail mixing, things usually pan out well.  And in this case it turned out to be a mind blowing experience!  The trippiest part of it all is that this super-nice, unassuming, and amazing underground wizard by the name of Alex works right here at Twenty Five Lusk, an elegant, fine dining establishment that caters to what seemed to be mostly a stiffy, tech-money-infused crowd -- but beautiful nevertheless.  \n\nThankfully I caught him right before a surge of crowd that appeared out of nowhere (I attribute that to the combination of Alex and my own rock star resonance... hahaha the Law of Attraction you see) -- and caught him just in time to witness his wizardry work before my eyes. Of course he recognized me from the scene and when he prompted me for my request, I winked and responded, \"I thought DJs don't take requests..  mix up something that I'll never forget.\" From which he responded, \"Well then, it's not on the menu.. but hold on I'll make something that'll blow you away.\"  And indeed he did.  \n\nI was introduced with what he called \"Xipil's Inferno.\"  Now I'm not eloquent enough of a writer or verse enough in cocktail mixology to describe all the subtleties in taste, amount of kick, body, and the smoothness of this beautiful concoction but what I can tell you is that not only was it delicious but it was truly an experience to behold.  It equaled, if not surpassing the well known hubs I'm more accustomed to like Bourbon & Branch, Baretta, and Alchemist.  Just the process of creation was a show worthy of bringing a date for the thrill. As a matter of fact, it prompted me to call a girl friend (who I've been trying to get lucky with forever) to come check out my DJ bro work a different kind of a mix.  Without having to say she had a blast.. we all did!  (and I got lucky hahaha!!!)  But as the crowd surged even more, we figure it was time to leave the man alone so he can focus on the crowd at hand and I can focus on the girl at hand.  :)   \n\nThe verdict is clear:  I will return here to try the food but for sure revisit the bar when Alex takes the bridge.  He did mention that this was just the tip of the iceberg.  Wow!!  Unbeknownst to SF,  one of the best kept underground secret is hidden in an ultra-posh dining establishment.  Lol.  How cool and \"SF weird\" is that.  Oh he did say this when I told him that I'm going to spread this across the scenes:  He can only make custom drinks when things aren't busy - understandably so.  So catch Alex before the usual dining hours commence.  Twenty Five Lusk is lucky to have one of our underground best driving their lounge bar!!!", "author": "Zul A."}

However, the food at 25 Lusk was such a disappointment. I thought it was the worst meal I have ever had in San Francisco. \n\nThe food lacks taste and is not aesthetically pleasing at all. The plating seems like it was done by some line cooks fresh out of cooking school. \n\nWe had 3 things from the first course: 1) Hamachi sashimi- ok, the fish didn't taste fresh and the sauce didn't really go with the dish 2) Pork belly- the plating was horrible, they put this yellow pile of stuff on the side and the color and texture are flat out disgusting. The fish roe on the side tasted cheap and fishy. 3) Clam chowder- I could not taste the clam. It just tasted like melted cheese... which doesn't even make sense? Who puts cheese in the clam chowder?\n\nThe main course couldn't be more mediocre. I could not finish my ahi tuna because the fish tasted old and fishy. It was disgusting. Not too say the plating for all the dishes we got seem messy and amateur.\n\nIn conclusion, I wish I had gone elsewhere for the amount of money we spent.", "author": "Chris G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-30", "description": "I was very ambivalent about 25 Lusk.  My company was having a dinner and decided to come here as it was very highly recommended.  Except that they couldn't figure out how to accommodate 16 people when their table only seated 15.  So they said they would seat four people out in the main dining area away from the group.  Why can't you fit one more person at the table?  So then we tried to get them to move us out of the Ogden room and just seat us all in the tables close together.  They weren't willing to give up the smaller tables since they wouldn't be able to seat smaller parties in the special room.  Eventually they agreed to add the extra chair to the big table so we could all be together.  As a side note, none of the smaller tables were ever seated while we were there.\n\nBeyond the seating issue everything else went very well.  Wine glasses were never left to empty and plates were cleared efficiently.  Some of the things we ordered: Rocky Point Oysters with lemon sorbet.  I would never have though to put sorbet on oysters but these were so delicious we ordered several additional plates.  Yukon Gold Gnocchi with Summer Squash. Roasted Fingerling Potatoes with bacon and fondue.  I liked the fingerlings but I think the fondue made them a little too rich.  These did not get finished. \n\nI ordered the Seared Tuna with smoked Eggplant.  I really enjoyed the flavors of the radish gazpacho, eggplant and Fresh tuna in one bite.  The Grilled Wagyu Flap Steak and the Pork Shank went over very well.  I had a bite of the Wagyu with peach sauce and it was tender and juicy perfectly cooked.  I think there were many desserts ordered including the Milk Chocolate Mousse and Passion fruit Posset.  One thing to note, the Mousse has hazelnut ice cream and one of our guests daughter joined at the last minute who is allergic to nuts.  They took the plate back and brought one without the ice cream for her which I thought was very nice. \n\nFinally, I misplaced my phone, again at a company event, but had it returned to me by one of the servers.  Overall the evening was a great success with high marks for service, ambiance, and food and they have classy staff who don't seize the opportunity to keep something that doesn't belong to them.  I'd love to return for some more of those Oysters!", "author": "Sandyann G."}

The service was excellent, but the food left more to be desired. While it was well plated and served with care, the food didn't blow me away. Especially for the price, I expected more.\n\nStarting, we got an amuse bouche of what seemed to be just multicolored couscous. Nothing special and almost tasteless. We were also served some bread with nicely softened butter and salt. For our appetizers, I got the ahi tuna tartare and my bf ordered the wild mushroom ravioli. My tartare was average. It was served with one single large wonton chip that I had to awkwardly break into pieces. My bf was rather fond of the ravioli, but I thought it was just okay. As my entree, I ordered the fried chicken terrine and my bf ordered the grilled prawns. The chicken seemed to be deboned chicken thighs shaped into a square, breaded, fried, and then cut in half diagonally. It was served with mushroom pancakes and arugula. The chicken was pretty good (but then again, when is fried chicken not good?) and the mushroom pancakes were surprisingly sweet! It's like their version of chicken 'n waffles. I wasn't blown away by the dish, but I was amused at the chef's creativity on making a sweet mushroom pancake -- almost like it was dipped in syrup before cooking. My bf's grilled prawns were also pretty good. For dessert, I ordered the lime posset and my bf ordered the salted caramel swirled brownie. The lime posset was actually quite tasty and refreshing. The brownies were just mediocre... I could have probably made a better brownie.\n\nFor the price ($40 + $20 half glass wine pairing per person), I don't think it was worth it. I've had much better meals for the same price.\n\nWhile I still think the ambiance is romantic and the decor is gorgeous, stick to just after dinner drinks if you come here.", "author": "Leana L."}

The hype about this restaurant featureing New American Cuisine definitely lives up to my expectation. \nThe outside of the restaurant is very low key, unassuming. It offers valet for 14 bucks, which I think is very reasonable for this area. Once you enter the restaurant, you are in a relaxed dining environment. We came earlier and sat at the bar for a round of drinks. I had the dark and stormy, very delicious cocktail, the balanced flavor between ginger and rum sets the cocktail apart. \nMoving on to the dinner, my appetizer is the tuna tartar.  Tuna tartar is one of my favorite dishes all the time and I really like their take on this dish. It is fresh with strong ginger and garlic flavor, with touch of sesame oil. The green sauce, made from mashed avocado, is tart and flavorful, adding another layer of complexity to the dish. \nMy main dish is the grilled prawn. The prawn is a little bit overdone but still tasty. I like it when it is seasoned with lots of black pepper, again, personal preference. I chose the peppermint ice cream with brownies as my dessert. It is a fudgy brownies, very rich and creamy. It completes my meal, right on point. \nThe service is attentive but not overly aggressive. The decor of the dining area is modern rustic.

We walked down an alley and down stairs into a beautiful bar/ lounge area.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this spot was the architecture. Wood, Brick and sleek metal, loved the feel. The lounge seating is really fantastic. Rounded, low couches surround a fire pit suspended from the ceiling and floating just far enough off the floor to make it interesting to look at.  \n\nArriving early enough to enjoy the lounge I had a delightful and refreshing cocktail, the SF Yacht Club beautiful presentation, light flavor of mint and cucumber.\n\nWe also had a bar appetizer, tuna tartar. Contemporary presentation, what really made this dish was the avocado mouse. (next we plan to try those Prawn Corn Dogs, it just sounds so interest..!)\n\nUp stairs to the main dining room we were seated right away. My coat was taken to coat check and I was given a number. Our table was in the back near the wall.\n\nVery polite waiter took our order and brought our the amuse bouche of split pea soup with creme fraiche, this had a very clean flavor, a wonderful slightly salty taste to wake up the taste buds.\n\nOur started was the Yellow Tail Sashimi. Very pretty and simple dish, another contemporary presentation. For me the kiwi really added the perfect note of acidity to the light yellow tail fish. I thought the ginger puree was lovely in small doses, but could easily overpower the fish.\n\nMy S.O ordered the Chicken Fried Quail with mushroom pancakes and a cherry reduction. I must say the quail was PERFECT and I LOVED the reduction sauce with the bird. The mushroom pancake took me by surprise. I was expecting a very savory pancake but it was actually rather sweet.\n\nI had the veal with a pretzel pain perdu. My veal was cooked perfectly, the warm fatty meat with the bacon vinaigrette was a pair made in heaven. The sauce was very tangy and smokey which added the kick to my veal that completely made the dish for me. I also enjoyed the sweet bright green peas. The pretzel pain perdu was interesting, I associate a pain perdu with breakfast, french toast, but this was salty and slightly creamy in texture. \n\nThe portions here are rather large and we were too full to even consider dessert.\n\nOn our way out at round 8:20, the lounge had become packet. If you like a quiet lounge, I recommend coming early.\n\nOver all we really enjoyed this place, we will probably stop in again.", "author": "Meghan L."}

The atmosphere of the restaurant is reminiscent of an upper east side loft or downtown warehouse apartment in NYC.  It depends where you are sitting.  It's so cool.  The vibe is just so chic.  Very classy, lots of breathing room.  The place is multi level and sexy.  If you are looking to impress someone on date night, this is definitely the place to take them to.  This really isn't a sneakers and jeans type of place, though plenty of people were dressed super casually.  Totally wrong for the vibe here.  \n\nWe had reservations for 9 pm on a Saturday night and were seated fairly quickly.  There is valet parking available (sundays, mondays and fridays) should you choose it, but there is also plenty of street parking in the area.  Don't be put off by the neighborhood (SOMA district).  It is a bit dark and scary over there, but the restaurant is well lit, despite looking like it is located in an alleyway.  \n\nWe were in the upstairs area so it was very quiet and the music and lighting added to the sexy ambiance.  \n\nOur party of four started with some appetizers.  We ordered the pork bellies which can only be described as \"meat candy\".  It was so fantastic.  ($15)  We also ordered a few oysters ($4 each) which were sumptuous.  A really smoky flavor without the \"fishiness\" that can sometimes taint an oyster.  My husband had the ribeye ($40) and I had the sturgeon schnitzel ($32)  There are vegetarian selections as well, with fresh veggies in various sauces.  They also send to the table a delicious bread which tastes more like sweet cake.  \n\nThe menu constantly changes so what is available one day may not be available another day, though it seems that certain items are staples, like the pork bellies and the hamachi sashimi appetizer.  \n\nThere was a dessert served here, I want to say it was like a key lime pie, but it wasn't a pie.  It was in champagne ice shavings and it was so insanely good that most of the people at my table kept diving into my dessert.  It was so delicious.  I wish I could remember exactly what it was called.\n\nFor the four of us, including a few libations, the bill was over $300 but the food was so delicious, it was worth the splurge.  I would definitely recommend trying this restaurant if you are looking to impress a date or just have a sexy evening with good friends.", "author": "Cher T."}

It feels a little bit like a loft, but they fully embraced the \"pinterest\" model of styling...mason jar lights....dimmed candles...all of it. \n\nThe service was great - our waiters were both very kind and explained the menu to us with as much detail as they could give.  They cracked a few jokes and were very happy despite how busy it was that day.  \n\nThe food was very good, however it wasn't the greatest most original thing I've ever had.  It might be because we went during restaurant week and they were mass producing a lot of the same food for everyone.  I thought that the shrimp was way overpowered with whatever sauce they put on.   The duck was cooked well but it wasn't very original.  And the caviar...eh I've had better. My favorite was the lime dessert \"soup\".  It was a weird and new concept which I appreciated...and it was delicious! Tasted like eating key lime pie pudding. \n\nI'll come back again just to sit in that beautiful place and try their regular menu.", "author": "Kristin C."}

Therefore, I can only comment on the lounge cocktails and service. This previous time, I had the raw oysters with champagne ice on top though.  They were every bit fresh and tasty.  I have no doubt if I came here for dinner, the food would not disappoint either.\n\nThe first drink I ordered was their SF Yacht Club cocktail.  It looked too refreshing to pass up.  In fact, when I was handed the cocktail menu, I looked no further.  It consists of vodka, fresh grapefruit juice, cucumber, lemon, lime, mint and garnished in a tall glass with lemon and lime twists.  -quite an attractive looking drink too!  The bartenders, servers and staff are all friendly and noticeable attentive.  Empty glasses don't linger around on surfaces, and someone will always make sure your glass is full.\n\nTwenty Five Lusk is absolutely gorgeous.  It's a multilevel modern and chic place with sexy, upscale ambiance.  There are a few stainless steel fireplaces suspended from the ceiling as a center piece in several areas of the lounge for patrons to gather around.  It is only a small portion of the rest of the incredible lighting scheme in this place.  There is up lighting in some areas, dimly lit pendant lighting over the bar, lighting underneath the white bar top and candles distributed on the lounge tables.  The walls are of an urban feel with red brick walls.  There are large, rustic wooden beams throughout establishment with black flooring, white seating and lots of glass partitioning.  There are private rooms and smaller private areas in the lounge area too.\n\nThis is one of the coolest, swankiest drinking spots in the city.  I most definitely intend to return at some point to try some dinner in the future.", "author": "Elizabeth S."}

It's served cold and is a little too sweet, both of which prevent it from being enjoyable.\n\n- Salmon, fennel, artichoke, black trumpet mushrooms, black garlic butter: this dish was intended to be made with Halibut but they ran out, so they did mine with salmon instead.

As soon as we walked in my boyfriend said \"I think we've just found our new favorite place\". We have had a hard time finding the perfect date spot that is trendy yet romantic. Most restaurants in SF, even the most popular ones, are just trendy. Through the old brick (it used to be an old smokehouse according to our server), the amazing architecture/design, etc. - the restaurant has a very 'cool' & 'sexy' vibe to it.\n\nAfter dinner we went downstairs to the lounge area and had a drink around one of the fireplaces. There were a mix of people down there, from couples to singles. I would be willing to come here simply for a drink on a night out even - as the place is pretty expensive to do dinner at often. Even with SF Restaurant Week, for the two of us (with 2 drinks each) cost $178 + tip. Then another $24 for two drinks in the lounge.

The bar bites are reasonably priced and quite delicious.  The octopus skewers were exceptional--they were the most tender morsels of octopus I have ever eaten.  At a mere $5 per glass for some generous pours of excellent Sonoma County wines, we naturally ended up having quite a few. \n\nAlready feeling a little full from happy hour in the lounge we decided to forgo any appetizers during dinner and ordered the entrees of duck and cod, both with sides of the mini cauliflower creme brulee.  \n\nThe duck dish with sweetbreads was quite satisfying--better than the cod dish--and I was quite happy about the fact that I ordered the duck and she ordered the cod because she had been on a streak as of late, ordering the better entrees at restaurants (but this time I won!).  I was also glad that we ordered our own separate cauliflower creme brulee.  It was definitely something that I really did not want to share--it was perfect!

I chose to not venture out and order the Black Angus Burger (with egg). I was delightfully surprised by the taste of the burger. I don't know if it was seasoned well or if it was because there was so many other \"toppings\" to the burger that made it taste good. Aside from the egg, there was bacon, some sort of green leaf (not arugula), some type of sauce (it was green and savory. Sorry for my lack of description), with a healthy portion of cheese (can't remember the type?). Anyway, that was good. Not bad and if I returned, I'd likely order that plate. \n\nThe birthday girl got a prawn omelette that she was overall pleased with despite the VERY small quantity. \n\nSome other folks got the steak and eggs plate that was accompanied with duck fat fries.

I also ordered a rib-eye steak and not only was it over-cooked, but it wasn't rib-eye! I have had my share of steaks and know my cuts well.  Given their price tags, I would opt for many other dinner spots in the city.\n\n1 star off: fake food\n1 star off: fake decor\n1 star off: fake boobs", "author": "Ally W."}

And not necessarily in the best of ways.\n\nAs soon as I walked in though, it immediately struck me how what I had imagined was nothing like reality.  Since the bar/lounge sits a level below, I can't comment on how it looked upstairs.  However, the downstairs area looked gorgeous - very modern, very sleek, and very nice.  Hipster, this is not.\n\nThe bar itself is moderately sized and looked more like a kitchen of sorts.  Still, the drinks they put out were all quite tasty - helloooo Dark and Stormy!  A little past the bar is the lounge area, where they have couches/benches lined up around a couple of \"floating\" fireplaces.  Again, very chic and very cool.  Too bad I don't have a picture of them to post!\n\nWhile it was a lot of fun relaxing with friends over drinks (bonus points for how diverse the crowd was), I rounded down from FOUR AND A HALF STARS because of the bar service.  The bartenders were friendly and crated terrific drinks, but despite the half dozen of them back there, it was really slow going at times when it came to ordering.  And since the bar is right where you walk in, it was a bit tough to work your way through the mass of people.\n\nStill, I definitely want to come back at some point to try out their dinner menu.", "author": "Mike L."}

I didn't know what to expect with the cronuts but they were fluffy and crispy, not too oily.  The lobster benedict was crazy good and the steak and eggs had a fancy twist to not only the taste but the presentation (loved the mushrooms in it).  The chef sent out two complimentary amuse bouches, who doesn't love free bites of food??\n\nService was great, decor was beautiful and trendy.

They don't know how to treat their customers. It's the type of place where you dress up, and things are pricey. It's an atmosphere place. There's a sommelier, not that I'm cultured enough to be able to take advantage of such a thing, but you get the point. \n\nLast time I was here, I had a drink spilled straight down my back. It happens. That was my attitude when it happened, and I don't know if it's because I was so chill about it, but what did they offer me for now having to wear a stained shirt the rest of the night? They would be glad to take care of my dry cleaning for the shirt (actual value to me: $2). No thanks. Sounds like more trouble than it's worth. This is the type of place you pay for the atmosphere, and it deserved some sort of check reduction. But no. I spent ~$150 for 2 people here, got a cold beverage poured down my back, a stained shirt, and an offer to clean the shirt for $2. I won't be back.", "author": "Daniel T."}

Twenty Five Lusk totally captured the mood I was chasing via their cool downstairs lounge & trendy upstairs eating space. \n\nLocated at the end of a SOMA alleyway, you can either pay $12 for valet or circle the area for a not-too-hard-to-find spot. \n\nAmuse bouche of mango smoothie & trio of pastries were lacking in pizazz. \n\nBloody Mary ($12) made with their well vodka, smirnoff, was one of the tastiest brunch drinks I've had to date. Ultra peppery, not too spicy, complex in taste from aged balsamic & Thai chili paste. Five stars! A unique take on a drink that could easily fall flat. \n\n3 course prix fixe menu ($35):\n-- roasted bananas, kiwi, berries, raspberry sorbet: it was a sweet, simple start to my meal. Totally preps the palate for heartier things to come. \n-- asparagus frittata: goat cheese, leeks, olives, fava leaves (very interesting ingredient), sauce mousseline: ingredients were so in harmony except for the sauce, (similar to a hollandaise); it felt over-the-top rich & unnecessary; a light, fresh tomato-based sauce might've been better. Frittata was a good consistency...not too dense. So delicious! \n-- caramel sea salt brownies w/ mint ice cream: could not distinctly pick out a caramel flavor.

Well-staffed valets quickly parked the car (we could have found parking, but we're lazy), and a not blaring music greeted us.  The bar setup is very nice, and large, with stools and lounge chairs both available so you could be comfortable while you wait for your table.  Most of the snacks were good, and the wine pours were healthy enough.\n\nWe had reservations at 8:30, and we were seated promptly.  Maybe it was just the luck of the draw, but we had one of the best waiters I've had in a long time.  Attentive without being intrusive, friendly without being too familiar, and all of the little things were taken care of expeditiously.  That they have both still and sparkling water in pitchers was a bonus, I much prefer sparkling and it was nice to have them fill it as opposed to buy a bottle.\n\nThe Wife and I split a pork confit appetizer that was excellent, and our vegetarian friends split a gnocchi that was also well-received.  My entree was the steak, and it was cooked appropriately rare with nice sides.  The Wife had a pasta dish that didn't have a sauce she expected, but she liked it.  Portions are what they should be (i.e. some people would regard them as small), but we were satiated after the main course. \n\nDesserts were quite tasty, and we never had the feeling of being rushed or overcrowded.

While the concept of the menu was fun, the meal didn't quite do it for me. Not that it was bad, but it wasn't great.\n\nI felt that both food and service wasn't quite at the level where the restaurant wants to be at. Yes, the space itself looks great but everything else seems to fall short of that. For one, the flavors and presentation of the dishes just wasn't up to par. Other restaurants charging $60+ for a tasting menu (ie, Commonwealth) clearly does better with flavor and presentation.\n\nAs for service, there were a couple times where we felt abandoned by our server and the service overall was a bit on the casual side. Not that there is anything wrong with casual service, but at this price point, I expected it to be a bit more professional.\n\nHowever they did redeem themselves when we made a substitution request. The Lady doesn't eat red meat so they told us that she can pick any dish off the regular menu in place of the steak course. Most restaurants don't respond well to substitutions especially when it's a tasting menu and in rare cases where they are willing to make the substitution, we often don't get a fair trade (ie, we got cheese pasta when we didn't want foie gras at Quince).  However at 25 Lusk, not only were they extremely accommodating, we didn't feel short changed.\n\n3 stars for food. +1 star for being super nice about substitutions.", "author": "Andy W."}

However, after my friend had dinner there and told me about her experience, I had second thoughts. Although TFL is stunning, she said the food was all lacking in flavor. But, she said that it would be a great place for Happy Hour so I suggested this to my HS friends for our little get together. \n\nOn Friday, December 3rd at 6ish pm, I met with five of my friends for HH. TFL is tucked away in an alley directly across from the back of  Safeway in The Beacon complex between 3rd and 4th Streets. \n\nStreet parking is relatively easy to find before 6 PM, however, after that time or worse, during a game...good luck! Valet parking is available for $10 or you can park FREE at the Safeway parking lot for a max of 90 minutes but to receive a validation stamp, you need to make a $5 purchase at Safeway. \n\nStepping into TFL is like walking into an upscale and trendy Restaurant Bar & Lounge in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The multi-level space is sophisticated, sleek and sexy, yet oddly maintains a warm homey feel to it. The lounge area with rustic exposed brick walls and timber, stainless steel fire orbs and slick leather furnishings creates a trendy yet inviting ambiance that makes it the PERFECT setting for HH and a place to \"See and Be Seen\". \n\nThe stunning ambiance aside, the service and the appetizers left me little desire to return for dinner... \n\nMy review is divided by Happy Hour and Drinks/Appetizers:\n\nHH  P R O S:\n*ARCHITECTURALLY STUNNING space and d\u00e9cor--kudos to the Architect and Designer!\n\nHH  C O N S:\n*DIFFICULT TO GET SEATING (think Palomino's during HH) and this lounge is not tiny by any means. You literally have to hover around tables and let your vulture instincts kick in if you want a table or even one seat. After \"hovering\" for 10 minutes, we were fortunate to snatch a table 2 feet from where we were standing.\n\n*LONG WAIT/IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A DRINK.  It took our waitress 20-25 minutes to get our drinks EACH time. Some of my friends who came later tried going to the bar and they said they waited for over 20 minutes and still NEVER managed to get a drink. \n\nWhen it came time for the bill, it took another 20 minutes to hunt down our MIA waitress. With all the waiting involved, we spent 2.5 hours there for 2 drinks and apps; longer than a multi-course dinner at Gary Danko or any fine dining establishment I've been to for that matter.\n\n*CROWD. I enjoy a mature and classy crowd BUT what I do NOT enjoy is a crowd of homogeneous pretentious and self-entitled elites. Excuse my bluntness, but it was like a meat market for over-the-hill power trippers and those suffering from a lethal overdose of botox. \n\nD R I N K S / A P P E T I Z E R S:\n*HENDRICK'S TONIC ($9): WEAK. Normally, I'm buzzing off 2 Hendrick's Tonics, but after 2, I barely felt a thing. Since it took over 20 minutes to get each drink, I suspect  my drink was diluted from the melting ice after having been sitting at the bar for a while.\n\n*CAULIFLOWER CREME BRULEE ($13): YUM! The \"cr\u00e8me\" was velvety smooth and rich, but tasted more like a cheese flan topped with perfectly caramelized crust. I love sweet and savory sweet foods, but the crust was a bit thick so it was on the sweeter side. It was something that I had to take several bites before it started growing on me.  \n\n*CREATE YOUR OWN APP PLATE (3 items - $14, 4 items - $19, 5 items - $23)\n\n1) RABBIT w/ (Missing) Foie Gras Slider (+$3): BLAH! The bed was not toasted and the rabbit was dry, stringy and completely tasteless. And the foie gras...did someone kidnap the foie gras?!?!? Because there was not even a remote hint or taste of it. \n\n2) LAMB MEATBALLS w/ Tahini Sauce: EECK! The balls were cold, bland and had a very overpowering gaminess. The accompanying tahini sauce was watered down and there was a lack of a nutty flavor from the sesame seeds. \n\n3) FRIES w/ Aioli Sauce: NO BUENO! There's nothing worse than room temperature fries on the verge of staleness and this is how the fries tasted like. The ends were still crisp but the rest of the fry somehow managed to be hard on some parts and soggy on others.\n\n4) FRIED ARTICHOKE: I didn't try them because they look overly battered and cakey. \n\nAt nearly $5 for each scant app item, it was very disappointing to get food that was served cold/room temperature and worse of all, COMPLETELY BLAND (this is coming from someone who has an aversion to salt and MSG).

We thought they would seat us at the bar but they sat us right away.  Immediately, the gentleman offered to take my coat - classy.  \n\nOur cocktail and wine were served promptly (try the Sparkling Normand - tasty!).  We were served a Shrimp Bisque with Lemon Oil amuse bouche (not sure if this was customary or because it was our anniversary, but hey, why ask why?).  It was amazing!  We were also served a Filet with Foie Gras Brown Butter amuse bouche - compliments of the chef.  This was truly even more amazing than the shrimp bisque!\n\nMy husband had the Pork Rib Chop - so juicy and succulent.  My Black Trumpet Mushroom Risotto was hearty.  We ordered the Medjool Date Cake and Lemon Possett for dessert.  While waiting for our dessert, we were given complimentary Sparkling Lemon & Licorice Soup (again, not sure if customary) and it was so refreshing!\n\nOf course our desserts kept up with the standard of our entrees.  One of the dessert plates had \"Happy 8th Anniversary\" written in chocolate.  The date cake was so rich in flavor and I wanted to lick off the remnants of the lemon possett.\n\nShannon, our server, was really friendly and attentive and offered great meal suggestions.\n\nAfter dinner, we walked around the lounge area - really sexy and modern.

They cooked it perfectly, and got a really good char on the tentacles so you got to enjoy that smoky taste and a bit of contrast in textures.  One of the better octopus dishes I have had outside of a Spanish restaurant in a while.\n\nFor dinner, I had the sturgeon schnitzel.  Yes, it is exactly what it sounds like ... a breaded and fried cutlet of sturgeon.  I have never heard of fish schnitzel, and I have never had sturgeon, but it is outstanding!  The fish is just incredibly meaty and rich, and the breading was nicely done and not at all greasy.  And it comes with a size of parmesan spaetzle (you can't have schnitzel without spaetzle, right?), which was equally tasty.  Fabulous dish!  I would order it again in a minute.\n\nThe restaurant itself is a tad dark, but I was there with a bunch of buddies, so I didn't care as I didn't want to look at them anyway ... seriously, though, it's a nice atmosphere and would be a good place for a romantic dinner too.\n\nCertainly would consider going back on future trips to the Bay.", "author": "Frank W."}

As I walked in around 6:30 PM for my reservation, my first thought was, \"Wow, I'm severely underdressed!\" Everyone in the restaurant was dressed to the nines, hostess included. We were promptly lead to our table and I felt like all eyes were on me as I trudged through the restaurant in my sneakers, jeans, chunky sweater, and backpack. (I had come straight from work, okay?) \n\nAs soon as we were seated, the waiter came over, went through the specials, and casually mentioned that there was an option to have a side of foie gras served alongside any of the restaurant week entrees for an additional $18. SOLD. I had been deprived for too long. \n\nI placed an order for the mushroom ravioli, duck with lingonberries, a side of foie gras, and the brownies for dessert. It hurts me to say that the highlight of the meal was the brownie dessert and even that was only marginally better than Little Debbie's Cosmic Brownies. None of the dishes stood out. The duck entree portion was so small, it could have been served as a starter on the lunch menu. 4 thin slices of duck atop a spoonful of lingonberries and other fancy schmancy garnishes that offered no substance. I have a relatively small appetite and even I could have eaten a Big Mac and super-sized fries after that meal. The best way to describe this dining experience is to compare it to a dinner in the formal dining room of a cruise ship. They try really hard to sell you with great service and over-the-top decor, but fall flat with mediocre bland food. \n\nThe bill came out to be just over $100. Given the quality of food, I definitely wouldn't have considered the meal to be a \"good value\" for restaurant week standards much less when they're not running a restaurant week promotion. \n\nI probably won't be back unless it's for drinks and hors d'oeuvres on the company's dime.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-10-22", "description": "25 Lusk totally reminds me of a hip downtown joint in the Meatpacking district of NYC.  Brick and timber interior with a gorgeous glowing staircase separating the bi-level venue that used to serve as a smokehouse facility.  I love it when old buildings preserve an industrial grunge aesthetic but updated to reflect modern-day times.  Like a Jetsons-meets-Flintstones kinda feel with exposed brick walls, slate flooring, timber beams, glass and chrome fittings, and even a floating stainless steel fireplace in the middle of a space-age lounge.  You step into a restaurant like this and can almost expect the cuisine to follow suit.  \n\nHere's what HIT:\nChicken fried quail with maitake mushroom pancakes and bing cherry reduction:  I'm so over the upscale chicken-and-waffles thing...every new hip eatery in SoCal's done some version of it or another.  Chicken fried quail is relatively new to me, but totally on par with what's trending in haute cuisine today.  Even though the sauce overpowered the plate and left cherry residue all over the super soaked pancakes, I quite enjoyed the crispity crunchity skin of the perfectly cooked quail when dipped in the reduction.  Although my one gripe would be that it lacked some spice.  Like majorly.  Nothing a little sriracha can't fix but who asks for hot sauce in a venue like this, right? \n\nParmesan fries with brown butter bernaise.  French fries and alcohol.  'Nuff said.\n\nGrilled octopus salad with olives, red onion, mizuna, and verbena garlic vinaigrette:  Once you've had Michael Voltaggio's Ink (in West Hollywood), there is simply no comparable comparison.  Although this single tentacle could have satiated a party of 2, there's no splitting this baby amongst 10+.  Some get the body, others get the tail, but what we all got was the salted, smoky char left of the ridges of the octopus.  A solid A for effort.\n\nAnd here's what MISSED:\nStorm Hill Filet Carpaccio with celeriac and apple choucroute, coriander, and huckleberries.  The texture of the carpaccio was TOTALLY off.  Where I expect my meat tender but not totally beaten, the lanky slices of raw filet tasted like a pile of soy mush rather than a refined sliver of expensive steak.  I like my carpaccio paper-thin, translucent, and topped with some zest of citrus.  This plate failed on so many levels I didn't even finish my piece.\n\nSeared Diver Scallop with prosciutto di parma, snow peas, quail egg, and lemon butter.  Green eggs and ham for the hoity-toity bunch.  This dish was DYING for some texture since it was a mish-mash of sodden layers.  An unusual hierarchy of chewy egg plus rubbery prosciutto and hidden scallop atop wilted greens.  I'm sorry Chef, I just don't get it.  Or I get it completely and I just don't like it.\n\nDon't get me wrong guys; my experience at 25 Lusk was saved by the stellar interior.  The perfect place south of market to meet your gals for a night of drinking, dining, and dishing.  Seems the prettiest peeps in SF share the same sentiment since just about every single patron looks like they stepped out of a Dos Equis commercial.  And really, have you ever spotted someone eating in those things??  Didn't think so.  Come for the vibe, leave with a buzz.  Seriously the PERFECT spot for singles ready to mingle, you can quote me on that!\n\nBon App\u00e9tit my beauties!", "author": "Julie K."}

The downstairs bar however is beautiful as I'm sure the rest of the space is. The use of retro/futuristic elements; think view of the future form the 70's, like the floating polished metal firepits, lots of glass and reflective surfaces. They do leave in the open ceiling and wooden beams of the former meat packing/processing/smokehouse building that it was before. Chairs are very low, I'm talking squatting low, and small white tables that dot the floor. It was a lot less crowded than I thought it would be for opening night on a Saturday but I appreciated that it was mellow. Most patrons were very decked out to be seen.\n\nI think our group tried the majority of the house special beverages:\n\n-Red Monkey\n-SF Yacht Club\n-Blueberry Bee\n-Little Ava\n-International Orange (not sure of this one as I didn't have it)\n\nDrinks run $11/per and our waitress was very nice and attentive.

Every dish we ordered (appetizers, main courses, and desserts) were delicious.\n\nThe only hiccup came with the wait to be seated.  The restaurant looked about half empty, but it took over 45 minutes for our party of 4 to be seated.  To be fair, we did not have a reservation.  Still, it seemed excessive.  Especially given the fact that we were eventually seated at a table that was empty the ENTIRE time we were waiting at the bar.

Ok the blini starter came from Russia but still - \nweird. dinners were lovely and substantial. Drinks were average SF prices - $10 plus for a glass of wine - $12 plus for cocktails - dessert sounded better than it was - we had the sampler - samples were too small.

They actually ran a sale on Gilt City earlier this week, so I took advantage of that. I emailed them beforehand to get some clarifications (they actually encouraged the use of multiple vouchers per table), and Reid was very friendly and helpful!\n\nEverything was so easy - no issues with the check or ordering at all. Everyone was on the same page and knew we were doing the Gilt City promotion. I felt like they treated us very generously; no nickel and diming at all. We actually had 11 people and only enough vouchers to cover 10, and they were proactive enough to make sure to only charge us for the cheapest entree out of pocket.\n\nWe had 4 servers bringing entrees to our table simutaneously, to minimize waiting!! Impressive for brunch service!\n\nFood:\nI came for the lobster eggs benedict, after seeing them listed in 7x7's \"10 Best Eggs Benedicts in San Francisco.\" Did not disappoint! Even the prosciutto, which I am normally not a fan of, was so thinly sliced and executed very well. The lobster was perfect - not chewy, not fishy. Eggs were perfectly gooey. \n\nSeveral people had the steak and eggs and they looked good - though I'm still ordering the lobster eggs benedict next time I go!\n\nTheir pancakes are also so decadent! More like french toast in that they were thick and moist.\n\nI think we were already too full to fully appreciate the final course of coffee and doughnuts. Coffee was good though!

It is not meant to be shared and the waitress didn't tell us that.  If you order the lobster roll, you literally get 1/2 or 1/3 a lobster roll.  While, it is delicious, it's something for one person and they should tell you that up front\n*  The tables are TINY.  No biggie if you are having just drinks, but if you order an appetizer (one for each person), there is no room for anything.  The plates they serve the apps on are way bigger than needed be - most of the plate is empty. \n*  Most of the seating is sofa-like and in the shape of a big U, making it difficult for large groups to talk.\n\nSummary - this could be a place to bring someone from out of town who wants the \"Big City\" experience, but I didn't think for the $$ it was worth it for me.  It seems like a place where you would go to see and be seen rather than somewhere for conversation with friends.  Nothing wrong with that, it's just not my particular scene. \n\nP.S.

I love the ambiance created with the dim lighting, dual level floors that seem translucent between the exposed brick walls, and the delicate white accents created with the furniture and white orchids.  It would be an awesome living space or a great place to have just a big huge party.\n\nWe came here for the lounge and it was spacious compared to most bars/lounges in SF.  The bar was a bit crowded and could be bigger, but the bigger \"lounge\" space is appreciated.  We came here after HH at Palomino's and a detour on Polk Street.  We saw some of the same Asians at Palomino's here so I guess we were not too creative.\n\nThe bouncers and staff are excellent.  Our bartender on the ground floor was meticulous.  We were watching him over the shoulders of the patrons dining at the bar on the ground floor while waiting for our drinks.  The French 25 was pretty good and I had my standard glass of Cava.

I had the pleasure of meeting him and he enthusiastically described all the dishes, how they're prepared, recommendations, etc. It was such a blast just hearing about the food! Unfortunately he wasn't working the night I went but shout out to Brandon Roberts! =D \n\nMy date's flight got delayed so we couldn't make it to our reservation and we had to make it for the next day. The only times they had were at 6 and 10 or something so we settled for 6. It filled up quick though once we were there! Make sure to make reservations WAYYYY in advance if you want to dine there at a normal time. My date lives in LA so the restaurant totally looked like the norm for him but I was amazed at the decor! Its so rare one can make modern decor be cozy too! Its exactly how I want my future home to look like! \n\nWe ordered the Lobster Crepe to share and I think we both agreed on it being the best thing we had all night. It looked small but the crepe was PACKED with Lobster and topped with Crab. Mmmm. It tasted so fresh and we were basically fighting over the last piece. \n\nI got the Oregon Steelhead as per Brandon's recommendations. I probably wouldn't have ordered it otherwise but it was sooo good. It almost looked overcooked but it wasn't. It was perfect! It came on a bed of fennel that I would usually ask them to remove but I'm glad I didn't. I guess I'm a fan of fennel now. It also came with little Lobster Beignets that were really boring and did nothing for the dish but add a little texture. \n\nMy date ordered the Roasted Porchetta which was HUGE. He couldn't even finish it which made me feel like a fatass for finishing my entree haha. \n\nHe was too full for dessert and I was too but I couldn't leave without ordering dessert!!! I got the Pineapple Bread Pudding which was too much pudding not enough bread. Definitely not worth the $10. The ginger ice cream was good though. \n\nHe ordered the larger sized coffee for himself and our waiter gave him a weird look but didn't say anything. Next thing we know we get a huge pot of coffee on our table! Hahahha. It was so funny. He explained to the waiter how he thought it was in ml and not oz or whatever and the waiter was nice enough to let him drink as much as he wanted from the large pot and still charge him for a small. \n\nService was really good except our waiter was really serious and kind of scary. The bus boy was so cute! He kept saying \"my pleasure\" every time I thanked him for clearing something off our table. Teehee. \n\nThey have valet parking for $10 where they just park your car in the lot 15 feet away from the front door. I'm assuming you're not allowed to park in the lot otherwise? I have no idea how these things work. They also have coat check if you need it! It came out to be a total of $100 with the valet parking. I thought it was steep but my date said it was pretty cheap mostly because we didn't order any drinks. I'm sure that would've doubled our bill hahahha. \n\nNothing here was bad but for a restaurant in its category I would say it was pretty average.

That's really all there is to it.\n\nThe drinks are simple and strong and the staff is attentive, in part to make up for the service being kinda slow.  There is nothing surprising or confusing about the menu, for better or for worse.  The entire thing is characterized by a heavy pour which works well early in the evening, less well as the night goes on.\n\nThe decor looks like it was precisely calculated to represent what was in style 5-10 years ago.  The same honestly could be said for the food. There's minimalism, to be sure, but it's not clear whether it benefits anybody.  It is \"technically elegant\", in a very dry and predictable way, not in a way that makes you feel like you're experiencing anything new or interesting.\n\nThe greatest sin is not so much any mistake, but that they don't commit to any direction.  It's not very hip, it's not very sexy, and it's not very modern.  It needs a lot more character or a lot more refinement or both.  Mostly it needs to take bigger risks.  The moment you walk in, you know exactly what you're getting, because you've seen it all before -- in a Sears catalogue from 2007.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with this place, but there's nothing really right about it either.

I finally returned a couple weeks ago, and was very glad I did.\n\nSure enough as promised, they had made their happy hour tempura octopus bites more affordable - 2 bite-sized pieces for $3 instead of the original $6.  I also tried the pretzel rounds with gruyere which was very tasty.\n\nBut the star of the show was the Carnival en Oaxaca cocktail!!!  I've been obsessed with mezcal lately and had it in numerous cocktails all around SF and the Carnival en Oaxaca is one of two top contenders for best mezcal cocktail (my other favorite is the recently retired Aries from Trick Dog).  Yes, I am comparing a cocktail from 25 Lusk to one at the insanely popular Trick Dog.  The Carnival en Oaxaca is made with habanero-infused mezcal, cachaca, lime, mole & hellfire bitters, and is a play on a margarita but smoky and boldly spicy.  The black salt on the rim added another dimension of flavor that other bars in the city seem to have missed.  Note that I did not get any hint of cocoa from the mole but I did not care - the drink was perfect regardless and well worth the $12 price tag.  I really hope they keep this drink on the menu for a while.  I also had the Mulberry St, with rye, campari, vermouth, orange bitters, and flamed orange peel, which was a solid stiff drink, but similar to drinks you can order elsewhere.\n\nLast but not least, our bartender Timothy was great.

Of course i found it because of Yelp. \nMy friend and I made reservations for 8 but showed up early and were seated right away. I ordered a drink that I cannot remember the name of, but a mixer in it was sparkling water, which is a huge reason I got it. My friend got the SF yacht club. Pretty good. \nWe were given these little \"cheese cakes\" to start. It was savory, almost reminded me of a quiche. Really good. We got a salad to start and the ahi tuna tar tar. I loveeeee ahi tuna. It didn't disappoint. \nFor main course, I got the lobster eggs Benedict. OMG. So stinking delicious. And I can't remember for the life of me what my friend got, I just know it was delicious. \nWe finished with coffee.....ahhh I love a good restaurant's cup of coffee. Our server said that they get the beans locally & he served it to us in a French press. That was the perfect top-off to this restaurant. Loved it, will be back whenever I come back to the city, and recommend it to visitors or locals.", "author": "McKenna F."}

He had caught me on the way out to see some girlfriends, and I almost didn't come! But after a bit of convincing (I always take convincing when it comes to dinner dates), I agreed to accompany him here.\n\nI usually head to 25 Lusk to drink at the bar downstairs with colleagues, so I was surprised to find an entire restaurant upstairs. It's very posh, and the dim lighting is pretty romantic (if you don't mind talking over the drunken chatter from down below). Noise aside, it's actually quite easy to hear one another, and despite the casual-to-upscale setting, it can be a very low key and mellow experience.\n\nAfter helping me out of his two-door BMW, my date handed off his keys to the valet, gently ushered me upstairs to the restaurant where we were promptly seated, then proceeded to order.\n\nThings you should try:\n* Duck liver mousse (spread it over the complimentary focaccia bread -- so yum)\n* Heirloom cucumber and melon salad (those melon pieces are sweet and delicious -- really refreshing)\n* Seared Ahi Tuna (great taste with the arugula)\n\nWe also ordered the swordfish, but it wasn't my favorite. But if you like interesting tastes, it's definitely something to try (it's sprinkled with little marigold flowers that add a nice twist to the dish).\n\nI ordered a glass of the arneis roero pace 2011 piedmont italy (a white with a similar body to Pinot Gris), and he ordered a glass of the pinot noir ventana estate 2012 arroyo seco California (their fruitier Pinot noir). We're not wine connoisseurs by any means -- we just both wanted something light bodied and easy to drink, and asked for recommendations based on our general preferences. Our waitress was happy to accommodate us.\n\nBefore our meal came, the various waiters brought us little samples of whatever new dish they were concocting in the kitchen. We tried this sort of sweet ceviche with pop rocks, and it was so tasty! I'm not sure if I could handle more than just the little bite they gave us (and I doubt we're meant to), but it was a nice and unexpected touch that started off our experience for the night on a good note.\n\nAnd c'mon.\nWho doesn't like free things?\n\nThe service was fantastic. The hostess was polite and friendly, our waitress taking our order knew the menu and wine list incredibly well and was able to take our orders efficiently and with ease, the server delivering our food to the table was -- although a bit nervous as he described the various pieces of our dishes -- gracious and friendly, and our busser was also smiling and polite. And I'm not 100% positive, but I'm pretty sure that was the owner who came out in a nice sport coat to serve us an extra portion of the focaccia himself.\n\nFor being one of the last tables of the night, the servers really put on a good face for us. And having worked in the food service industry myself, I really appreciated the smiles despite how exhausted I'm sure they all were.\n\nOverall, it was a very pleasant experience! I typically hate going on dates (who wants to sit through a meal and conversation for over an hour with someone they may not even like?), but the combination of good service, good food, and surprisingly delightful company really made this a stand-out night for me.\n\nPS. We didn't try the desserts. I was in a rush to meet some friends and needed to get out of there quickly, but the home made ice cream sounded amazing. They left us with two nibs of chocolate brittle(?) regardless, and we nibbled on those quickly before we left -- yum!\n\nWould return again.", "author": "Sherilynn M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-29", "description": "Restaurant Week 2015 Review!\n\n25 Lusk was pretty much the only good deal of Restaurant Week, and I'm glad for this motivation, because I probably wouldn't have discovered it otherwise. The inside is surprisingly trendy, combining wood and chrome textures. The setup is very spacious and there's a large bar area downstairs. The open kitchen setup is accessible, yet not imposing. The food is just creative enough to tingle your palate, but not so much to turn off regular diners. 25 Lusk is definitely a pleasantly surprising treat.\n\n- California Caviar and Blinis: I've never had blinis (apparently they're a type of pancake), so these were a pleasant surprise. They act more as a savory complement than a \"dessert\" (or American Breakfast) pancake. The plating is the kind of thing that people make fun of fine dining for (very little food, very much plate). The caviar is a very small lump, but is very flavorful and fresh.\n\n- Grilled Gulf Prawns: The pasta pieces under the prawns were the showstopper. Tossed in the vinaigrette, they were little gems to behold. The prawns were cooked just right (not over/under cooked). This actually filled me up pretty well.\n\n- Salted Caramel Brownie: (I believe this contains nuts.) Salted caramel and brownies can never fail me. The ice cream was a satisfying touch. Probably wouldn't get this off of Restaurant Week because there are fancier desserts to be had, like...\n\n- Lime Posset: We didn't know what to expect with this, but it comes in a shallow dish with a layer of lime posset and topped with kiwis and champagne ice. The ice is very strong on the champagne flavor, and works amazingly with the zesty, creamy lime layer. This was such a unique experience and I would definitely recommend trying this if you have the chance.\n\n- We also got cocktails ($12). They have a lot of interesting combinations, with a set menu and a rotating menu. I got a drink off the rotating menu that had gin, red peppers, lemon, and black pepper. I know that sounds disgusting/bordering on Bloody Mary territory, but it was really good and who knew red peppers could work so well in a cocktail?\n\n25 Lusk food and ambience are great, but what really set me off was our 15 minute wait for our table, when half the tables were empty. The hostesses stood around and ignored us for the entirety of those 15 minutes, with no explanation why we were waiting.

A small-ish wedding of 48 guests, we had our ceremony elsewhere in San Francisco, and arrived at Lusk at 5:00pm for drinks, dinner, and dancing until 1:00am.\n\nWhile Lusk doesn't seem to do weddings regularly (if at all before ours), I knew that with a nice establishment who does private parties (probably mostly corporate?) they'd know how to dot their I's at cross their T's. We felt we were in good hands when we signed on with their then event manager Angela, about 6 months before our event. I wasn't interested in choosing cutlery, table settings etc, but rather leaving such details to those who do elegant/trendy dining already well. We weren't disappointed. The fire ambiance, the food (amazing at our pre-tasting and at the event), the dance-floor installation (something they don't normally do), the lounge, drinks, all of it was as classy as you can get; certainly the vibe we were going for. It was a great party.\n\nThe only complaint I'd have is to say that once Angela left, there were some natural complications that arose as our event was handed off to the new event coordinator. Instead of having 1 consistent point of contact, we suddenly had 4 people to work with on different details and despite a LOT of effort on both sides, some initially requested/granted details fell through the cracks. I do not, however, attribute this to lack of talent/capability on Lusk's side, merely the growing pains that come with any transition, coupled with the fact that weddings tend to play out a little differently than other events. Once we discussed these hiccups with the manager Chad, he very  reasonably met us 1/2 way with our requests, really proving how classy is this establishment and their staff. (Hence my review stands at 5 stars)\n\nI would highly recommend doing any elegant event here, and I look forward to going back again and again for years to come.", "author": "Sarah S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-06-20", "description": "A family friend brought my sister and me here to celebrate my sister's graduation from law school. Determined to completely ignore our cheapness, she insisted on ordering 6 appetizers, 2 main courses, and 2 desserts for the three of us. As for me, I refused to look at the menu so I wouldn't be blown away by the prices. Keep in mind, this review focuses mainly on the food and does not take the bar/wine into consideration.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n\n1.5/2 Stars for Taste:\n\n We ordered the Marin Miyagi Oysters, Yukon Gold Gnocchi, Rosemary Steamed Halibut, Arugula Salad, Pork Belly Confit, and Yellowtail Sashimi appetizers. For the main course, we shared a Seared Ahi Tuna and a rack of lamb. We also split a Cauliflower Creme Brulee. Dessert was Strawberry Lasagna and Salted Caramel Brownies with mint chocolate ice cream. Everything was good but nothing was memorable. I think my favorite dish of the night was the rack of lamb which was juicy and rare, just the way I like it. Our family friend cleaned up the cauliflower creme brulee. The desserts ($10 each) were \"meh\", and we ended up not even finishing them. The meal also comes with a complimentary amuse-bouche and after-meal coconut brittle. I personally did not enjoy the combination of peach and prosciutto or the bitterness of the brittle. \n\n0.5/1 Stars for Value:\nI understand that at a restaurant of this caliber, you are mainly paying for the atmosphere, the service, and the presentation but I would like to think that paying that \"tiny\" bit extra also implies that the food will be phenomenal. The appetizers averaged about $15 each while the main courses were about $30. The waitress explained that the serving sizes were designed so that one appetizer and one main course is enough to satisfy one person and for the most part I would say that's true. However, while every dish was beautiful and of the finest quality, nothing really seized hold of my taste buds and made me want to throw myself on the floor and exclaim, \"Take me, take me now!\" \n\n1/1 Star for Customer Service:\nThough the food was lackluster, I cannot deny that the service was impeccable. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, she gave us great recommendations. Our water was always filled and the free bread just kept on coming. I was impressed that the waiter didn't even bat an eye when we asked for another serving of butter with our sixth helping of bread. (No shame!) Between each course, the waiters clear the dirty dishes and bring new plates and silverware. As each course is brought to the table, the server tells you what each dish is and what is in it. \n\nIf you have the cash to blow and you are more interested in having an elegant  meal in a sophisticated setting than seeking the base pleasure of a food coma, then this is the place for you. As none of those things describe me, I probably wouldn't come back so no bonus star. Still, glad to have had this experience. I think this is the first meal where I've sat down and ate at a leisurely pace for THREE hours. Worth trying once!", "author": "Abby W."}

Also, a plate of four different mini-pastries served with some jam and butter.\n\nWe then ordered the following: \n* brunch sandwich - two fried eggs over easy with heirloom tomatoes, watercress, cheese and bacon in a Kaiser roll (it was like a poppyseed bagel without the hole)\n* forest mushroom scramble - tomatoes, thyme, roasted garlic, arugula and a spoon push of avocado mousse\n* cinnamon donuts \nAnd I had the Elysian Fields Forever... a strawberry/grapefruit cocktail which had me feeling pretty good throughout the meal.\n\nI spied a salted caramel brownie with mint chocolate chip ice cream in their dessert section but decided against it.

We were referred to this spot by our waiter at Alexander's because we were looking for a place to hang out after finishing dinner. It was only a brief walk down an alleyway from the restaurant. Not a scary alleyway at all, it was well lit and there were no loiterers. \n\nNo cover for this spot! We all personally enjoyed the decor of the place because it was modern but also  comforting and inviting. There are 3 different seating areas with sleek couches and some of the areas even have modern fireplaces in the center. Also, located downstairs is a private room that can seat 18 people around a large rectangle table. Once we seen the setup of the place our minds were already thinking about what party we can plan at this location next! \n\nThe music that they were playing switched from different genres of music. When we first walked in they were playing Ultra type music, then it switched to a little reggae, and some R&B but definitely not hyphy music. The mood of the room was more chill and not super crazy. People kept to themselves and their groups that they came with. \n\nAnother thing to expect from this spot is that their bar doesn't have the mainstream type alcohols. For example, no Hennessy, no Patron, they do not even have flavored vodkas, they'd rather muddle in fruit to flavor a vodka. At first, I wasn't sure because my drink of choice is Patron but our waitress was very knowledgeable about the different types of alcohol that they had at the bar, and suggested an alternative tequila. I am glad she did because it was very smooth and we liked it so much we enjoyed a few rounds of shots! The shots were also a large size pour! More bang for our buck for sure!\n\nIt was great that they had service at the tables and couches. No need to wait at the bar for a drink!\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our night here and plan on coming back soon!\n\nRestrooms: Separate restrooms for men and women. Smaller bathrooms.

As such our menu options were limited, so I did not get to try perhaps exactly what I'd like, or exactly what the restaurant does best.  It's telling that some of the items we were offered aren't actually on the regular menu, but more on that later.\n\nThe opening round of bar food was generally good: everyone liked the potato croquettes, and the tempura shrimp were, if not especially exotic, perfectly prepared. A vegetable spring roll was a surprise; perhaps its many appearances were a function of economy but it kind of grew on you after one or two. Or three drinks.\n\nDrinks started with a glass of the happy hour nebbiolo, which was decent red, then I switched to a slightly less interesting old fashioned.  With dinner I changed again to greyhounds, as 25L does use fresh juices from their bar.\n\nAs I mentioned the dinner was a three-course affair.  Everyone received a forgettable mixed-greens salad with some vague dressing that was so bloodless I can't recall what the menu described it as.  The regular menu provided on the restaurant's website does not seem to mention anything similar.\n\nFor mains I selected the interesting-sounding gnocchi, as this seemed the sort of restaurant that could execute on the deceptively tricky dish.  The quality of the yukon gold gnocchi was regrettably average, tending toward a putty-like consistency and the \"smoked tomato broth\" seemingly reduced to a tablespoon.  However, despite the technical flaws, the shocking part was the portion: the gnocchi were about a saucer's worth in the bottom of an enormous bowl.  I could only look with sad envy at the full-sized steaks and fish my fellow diners received.  Later, I saw on the web menu that the gnocchi are meant as an appetizer. Should it have been scaled up as a main? Hmmm...  \n\nDessert helped prop up a disappointing meal.  The brownies were my ideal sort: very fresh and chewy, with a bit of mousse-like consistency. These, I would recommend.\n\nWith seemingly the entire place usurped by our large crowd, the service staff was pushed well past its limits; during cocktail hour the logistics of where and whom one could order from were limited and confusing, if not outright baffling. Small bites would arrive in bursts and then recede for long intervals.  The spottiness settled down once we were seated for dinner.   Our table's main server, Sarah, was nothing short of heroic in regularly fetching additional hydration for the table.  Thanks in large part to her, a potentially dreary evening was averted and we were jealously regarded as the \"fun\" table in our section.", "author": "Josh M."}

While I love the place for it's hip, romantic and modern chic theme, the food didn't seem to hit the spot for me. Don't get me wrong, there were a few great dishes but that's only three that we ordered and one that was complimentary from the chef. \n\nI really wanted to try their famous cauliflower creme brulee that everyone raved about, but sadly, it was not on the menu. \n\nFor starters: \n-Chilled asparagus soup \n-Seared scallop \n-Torchon foie gras (complimentary) \n\nMy favorite out of the three was the complimentary starter. Loved the foie gras, very concentrated in flavor but not overpowering. The black cherry sauce and the biscuit that it was served on added taste and texture, which completed the dish perfectly. My second favorite was the seared scallop, and although I don't like to eat scallop I really enjoyed the creamy sauce, the lumps of crab meat that it was cooked with. The scallop was seared nicely, cooked just right on the surface and gently raw at the center. The asparagus soup was good but I was only able to take a couple of spoonfuls, I found too rich for my taste. \n\nFor entrees: \n-Pork rib chop \n-Grilled steelhead \n\nOur favorite was definitely the pork rib chop, the flavors are very flattering to the taste buds. The dark thyme sauce was very good! The pork chop, however, wasn't cooked consistently, it had its dry parts and it had its juicy and tender parts. The juicy and tender part of the chop was very delicious and as for the dry parts, it's forgivable as long as you run the meat in the sauce. The grilled steelhead was mediocre nothing special but all typical, lightly salted & peppered, olive oil and grilled. I found myself loving the bed of fennel salad it was nicely placed on more than the main dish itself. \n\nFor dessert: \n-Dulce de Leche cheesecake w/ raspberry sorbet\n\nAt first I thought the cheesecake was way too small, then I took a bite and was glad it wasn't any more bigger. It was overly rich and creamy, and one bite was more than enough for me. I then tried the raspberry sorbet to refresh my appetite and though it was too tart. I felt bad because our waiter had recommended the dessert and I didn't want to offend the him by having him see that a bite was all I ate so I had Jimmy finish the plate off. \n\nOverall, it was a pleasant experience. I would love to come back next time to check out the lounge.", "author": "Jenny K."}

We actually got here about 2 hrs early.  We decided to just let the hostess know we were here in case any tables became avail earlier.  With no pagers in hand, we headed downstairs to enjoy drinks.\n\nThe lounge downstairs filled quickly on a Friday night.  It had a nice ambiance with the stainless fireplace centered around white swanky benches.  Was kinda awkward trying to find a spot that didn't seem intrusive to others while we tried to nab our private spot.  The music is at a level which didn't require screaming into each other's ear so that was nice.

Too bad it was situated next to the table so close to another couple.  We asked for a booth and within minutes, they found one for us!\n\nDinner wasn't anything to write home about.  As a matter of fact, the pork was incredibly dry.  It's pretty hard to dry out pork since it's such a fatty animal.  They did and it was disappointing.  Dinner wasn't cheap either and quite frankly not worth it one bit.  \n\nSomehow, purely by coincidence I ended up here again the next night with a group of other friends.  Was disappointed to find out they don't carry any energy drinks to make Goose and Red Bull.  When I asked for Crown and Coke, they disappointed again bc they didn't carry Crown.  \n\nParking is very limited, but that's SF.  The lounge dead ends into an alley so if you pulled in trying to find a spot, but prepared to flip it around or back out cuz you ain't gonna find anything on the weekend.  \n\nCrowd is hugely diverse.

We were seated promptly, and opted for cocktails, which were excellent--I recommend the Grapefruit Gimlet.\n\nThe first appetizer was raw tuna with caviar and lemon emulsion.  The contrast between the raw tuna and lemon was too sharp.  I'm a big raw fish fan, so I ate it, but my friend couldn't finish it--a bad sign for someone who will eat fish, but only if it's done really well.  And come to think about it, the fish tasted like it could have come from a sushi restaurant, nothing special about it.\n\nThe second course was pork and scallop with pineapple.  The pork was perfectly done.  No complaints.  This was the best dish of the night.\n\nThe third course was thinly cut filet mignon with bacon and huckleberry.  It was a good combination of tastes, but the meat portion wasn't that generous and didn't seem to be that tender or well marinated.\n\nThe dessert course was likewise lackluster--the flan was good, but not melt-in-your-mouth good that you would expect with such a presentation.\n\nThe busing service was exemplary, but the wait service left much to be desired throughout the evening.  After we paid, no one said goodnight to us on the way out, which was odd considering we were one of the few tables left and it was Christmas Eve.\n\nSo, in all, the food was good, not great, service was not up to snuff, and definitely not worth the price.

So three years ago when it was opening I remember crossing my fingers really hard hoping that they would be good because there literally cannot be a more convenient location for me to get dinner (until I can afford a personal chef who comes to my kitchen to cook, that is).  I was *thrilled* my first few visits there - so much so that I brought all my friends from near and far as often as I could.\n\nEven though I travel a lot, I eat here at least a couple of times a month - I would go more often but I'm seldom around for dinner during the week (they recently started serving lunch but I'm not around during the day either!)\n\nI've never tried their steaks/meat (I'm a pescaterian) but I've had fish, pasta and all of their seafood dishes (their menu changes almost daily) and I can't recall ever getting anything I didn't think was at least good and most things are excellent.\n\nMy particular favorite is the gnocchi which is usually an appetizer with changing accompaniments - it's supposed to be the chef's specialty and it's amazing - wonderful texture, soft on the inside and lightly fried on the outside.\n\nTheir fish selection is always great - there are usually three different fish entree choices on the menu any particular night, they always have a vegetarian entree (usually pasta) and a vegan entree (usually *not* pasta).  It's hard to have room for dessert but they have had some outstanding items and the menu has a dessert \"sampler\" which is three smaller versions of three of the desserts on the menu - if there are two, three or four of you, it's a good way to sample the desserts without getting too much food.\n\nThe staff has always been outstanding - sometimes they get extremely busy but they've always handled it extremely well - acknowledging the longer than normal wait and sometimes sending us a small in-between course so we don't have to wait with nothing to eat :)\n\nA lot of reviews claim that the food isn't all that - I strongly disagree.  I'm a foodie and I travel all around the world - I have eaten at dozens of top restaurants and I'm always happy to have dinner at 25 Lusk.  Every single one of my friends I've taken here has loved it as well.\n\nReservations strongly recommended, but you can get the full menu at the bar if you get there early enough to get a good seat at the bar counter or at the large communal table downstairs.  I wouldn't try having a real meal at the couches downstairs as the side tables are really only large enough for drinks and small plates.\n\nPlease don't drive here though.  Even though valet parking out front is available, you'll just piss me off by blocking my street and probably break our planter as you awkwardly try to make a U-turn in front of our garage.  Just take Muni or take a cab and have them drop you off at the corner of Townsend and Lusk.", "author": "Asya K."}

Lots and lots of pretty young things sipping cocktails and lots of places to move off to if you don't see someone of your liking.  \n\n3 stars for the restaurant though.  Either uber-restaurant-designer Cass Calder Smith forgot that sound travels upward or someone failed to tell him that they were trying to make that upstairs place a fine-dining establishment.  Whatever the reason, fine dining in a place where you have to yell to your dining companion is an oxymoron.  Also, it's a little awkward to stuff all of your parties of two into designated areas while the entire center of the restaurant sits barren.  \n\nAs a result, my guess is that this restaurant will have morphed into something else within 5 years.  The hopping bar just doesn't match the up-market food and the noise level helps nothing.  \n\nIf you can get past the schizophrenic combination of bar and restaurant though, the food here is good.  Big portions (the porchettta entree was HUGE) with big prices to match.  They served up unexpected amuse-bouche both pre-dinner and pre-dessert which was a nice touch.

A place you'd more likely find in NYC than SF, it's the perfect spot to hit if hip and sexy is what you're in the mood for. The exposed beams and brick walls of this massive former meatpacking space are complimented by the futuristic floating metal firepits and sleek lounge chairs downstairs, which makes it one of the most seductive spots in SoMa. Bring a date here for cocktails in the lounge and canoodling with ensue. \n\nWhile I've done both dinner and just drinks here, I'd recommend just hitting this place for some late night libations. Let's just say, the food is pretty to look at but not much substance behind it. I appreciate the innovative dishes, but nothing wowed me. And perhaps it had to do with the tiny portions with high price tags which left me unsatisfied. However, I did enjoy the oxtail raviolis, and the tempura bacon from the bar menu is absolutely genius. \n\nThe specialty drinks are nicely concocted - I'm a fan of the Autumn Rose.

There's a bunch of freestanding ottomans in an open surrounding their retro futuristic fireplace for larger groups, littler quieter rooms behind the bar for more intimate conversation, and a communal drinking table for those after-work happy hours. \n\nSince it was happy hour we chose to sit at the bar where we ordered a couple of cocktails ($11)  that were painfully crafted in front of us. It requires a lot of strength in order to properly muddle some herbs! I liked their 4 autumns which had vodka, muddled herbs, and a mix of bitters. Their sweet potato fries came were perfectly crisp and came with a smooth avocado puree. \n\nTheir Wed night happy hour crowd was all over the place; the after work crowd, male cougars, tourists, azn's, there were even some hipsters!

The restaurant area is on the 2nd floor with a glass-encased kitchen to admire.  Nice!  Classy!\n\nFriends and I came here for dinner last night, and it was solid good.  I ordered a Hendrick's margarita (refreshing!), local corn ravioli (lovely taste, loved the corn, yummm), whole roasted dorade (they brought the whole fish around first and it was lovely and dramatic, then they brought it back split in half ready to eat, tasty dorade with roasted vegetables on the side, loooooved it, would've finished it but I filled up on the tasty fresh bread and soft butter), brownie and mint ice cream (the 4 of us shared this and it was gone gone gone is seconds), moscato (nice, clean and light, great accompaniment to our lovely dessert).  \n\nThe service was a-ok.  The main waiter was a little aggressive when he came by to ask for our order and if we had any questions.  We were heavy into conversation and wait staff need to be sensitive to this as catching up over dinner is the norm, and when heavy topics are on the table, somewhat barging interruptions on a regular basis are noticed.  I can understand that dinner must be served and timing is of the essence, but I did notice this happened more than once, which was a little annoying - it's forgivable but annoying.  The other wait staff came around nicely though to fill our water glasses and to take our dishes away on par.  \n\nAll in all, we had a solid dining experience.  I am not in this area too often, but if I am, I will certainly be back.  It'd also be a great meeting place to catch up with friends over drinks.", "author": "Maile N."}

I ordered the South Beach cocktail, a ginger foam-topped concoction that immediately became one of my favorite drinks in the city. \n\nOn my second visit I had brunch on the spacious, rustic-industrial chic second floor. With its exposed brick and wood complemented by streamlined furniture, the room was a very pleasant place for a Sunday morning. \n\nWe came with a Gilt City certificate good for a set meal of coffee/doughnuts, choice of entree and two cocktails. The chef also sent out a nice amuse bouche to each table, featuring a pomegranate/banana drink and mini biscuits and scones. They weren't amazing, but I appreciated the gesture. \n\nThe doughnuts were also somewhat disappointing (shaped like tater tots and more crispy than tender), but the sauces they came with were quite good. \n\nFinally, my pancake dish was incredible.

Although I truly enjoyed the atmosphere, and most of the food, the service left much to be desired. \n\nFirst off, the space itself is very nice, some might even call it sexy. No complaints about this aspect at all, I would even come back here for drinks for this alone.\n\nWhere the issues arose was with the service. First off, during our drink orders, I asked about an ingredient I was unfamiliar with. The server told me it was a high-end bitters, when in reality, it was a sweet vermouth. Big difference, as I love bitters, and hate sweet vermouth.\n\nThe biggest issue arose from the fact that they had a pork dish and a boar dish on the menu. I ordered the BOAR, and was given the PORK. Now, I'm not one to make a fuss, so I patiently waited the 15-20 minutes for them to bring out the correct dish. However, the other 3 people in my party now felt they had to wait for me. \n\nThe food, once it arrived was good. I actually do highly recommend the boar dish, however nothing was done on their part to make up for the obvious mistake. Don't get me wrong, when I go out for a nice dinner, I'm not looking for freebies, but a gesture of taking the dish off, or a complimentary desert to make up for the mistake is pretty standard. None of those things were done, and it wasn't 'until we received our check and spoke up that they offered to remove the item. \n\nFor a place as nice as this, that I'm sure wants to attract people, this was unacceptable.", "author": "BigArm K."}

It was a serious miss for me though. I basically look to 3 areas for my restaurant reviews: The food, the service and the ambiance.\n\nThe ambiance was excellent. Sleek, modern and warm at the same time. Interesting architecture, easy valet, nicely lit, fantastic gathering spaces. The architect gets a 10.\n\nThe dining experience was another story. I'm not sure if I just ordered poorly, or the kitchen was having a bad night.\n\n- Cosmo was good, but REALLY petite for $12.00. No grey goose vodka. \n\n- Started off with a free amuse bouche from the kitchen. That's really cool, but the waiter didn't tell us what it was. Nada. Dropped & left. Looked & tasted like a quiche square. It was good, but what a miss on the service.\n\n- App: Mixed greens salad with heirloom tomatoes, sunburst squash, almond citrus vinaigrette. I know what I was expecting, but what I got was mixed greens, coated in an opaque white dressing with no tomatoes. The delivery guy told me they were mixed in... i poked around no tomatoes. Nada. He offered to get me a side of tomatoes, and was pretty snotty about it. He never returned, but the waiter brought some (we were all done with our apps they it came)\n\n- Dinner: Brentwood Corn Pappardelle gypsy peppers, foraged mushrooms, parmesan. COMPLETE miss. The pasta was no longer ribbons or even flat. It came in huge clumped layers, and tasted like it had been sitting in the strainer for 30 min. I didn't eat it, and the waiter didn't ask about it. Everyone at the table agreed it was disgusting. There wasn't enough corn or sauce to even just eat that.\n\n- Dessert - Passionfruit Posset - this is like a custard with shaved ice. It was really yummy. The Strawberry tart was beautiful but only OK.\n\n- The dessert gift from the chef (again, dropped with no description) was the hero. Dark chocolate balls with peanuts - at least I think that's what it was. It was tasty.\n\n- My friends each ordered the Burrata and the Filet. Both were happy with their choices. Both agreed that my dinner was a disaster, and the service lacking. My girlfriend apologized over and over - which was of course silly & not her fault. The restaurant didn't offer anything past the side of cherry tomatoes.\n\n- 2 stars for the ambiance and the parking. Although the dudes leaning on our car & smoking was a turn off when we came out.", "author": "Maureen B."}

Now go get my order.\n\nAnd the kicker was a 20$ mushroom appetizer that was 2 fried mushrooms and a semi-artistic smear of pur\u00e9ed egg yolk on a weirdly large platter.

So I suggested 25 Lusk since it's such a new hot spot.\n\n               I came in early to meet up with another old friend that I haven't seen over a year. He & I were at the bar downstairs, beautifully lay out, warm & cozy setting, with fire places, modern, but inviting. Behind the bar, there're some small room with couches, pillows, that you can lounge at with more privacy! Definitely a cool place for date nights!\n\n               Later, my GF arrive, we went upstairs for dinner. The second floor with open kitchen, spacious, could hold up 100 plus people!\n\n               Nice cocktails, Vodka, Gin, Rum drinks menu at the bar & lounge area.

The zinfandel  sauce was too rich for my taste! Although I did request more on the rare, but it was med rare, the meat was juicy, nice & warm. \n\nDESSERT: complimentary chocolate truffles, it was nice.\n\n             The food was a hit & miss dishes for us, mediocre, although it's still a beautiful place to dine at.

I believe it was $4-$5 per each beer we ordered!  They have a pretty good selection, so I ordered Anchor Steam.\n\n- You can sit on the couch around the fireplace, and someone will come to take your drink order.

Not even 10-15 minutes leeway to allow us to enjoy a drink at the beautiful lounge! What's up with that?!  And then when the hostess directed us  to a lousy table jammed among bunch of other tables and next to kitchen walkway she flat out said no to our request for a different table. \nBut our waiter was awesome and the food was delicious and really enjoyed the experience despite the poor beginning. \nWould love to go back if the management promises we won't get abused by the hostess staff!!", "author": "r t."}

Downstairs, the spacious lounge is broken up into multiple, smaller seating areas, each with its own fireplace.  Furnished with modern semi-circular sectionals and ottomans, the spaces offer areas for intimate conversation and interesting people watching.  The downstairs bar is sizable enough to accommodate the after work rush.  Upstairs, exposed beams and red brick walls frame the main dining room and another bar.  Seating can be a bit cramped, especially at the two-tops along the banquette near the bar, and the noise level sometimes makes it hard to have an earnest conversation.\n\nCarpaccio of beef with caper relish, grain mustard, duck egg yolk, cr\u00e8me fraiche ($15) was a tasty way to start the meal.  Served with braised short ribs, grilled asparagus, and shaved manchego, the potato gnocchi ($14) was delicious.  Ordered and served rare (a \"rarity\" in The City), the grilled rib eye with mushroom vol au vent, mustard greens, and Meyer lemon sauce ($29) was tender and juicy. Roasted vegetables ($8) in cider brown butter were an excellent accompaniment.\n\nService is efficient and professional.  Water glasses never went unfilled; drinks were delivered promptly; and dishes were removed in a timely manner.  Not overpriced, the wine list is well-conceived with a sufficient number of offerings by the glass and by the bottle.\n\nAs there is little else to draw people to the location, Twenty Five Lusk is a destination unto itself.  With excellent service, good drinks, and solid food, it is worth the special trip.", "author": "CJ G."}

Finally a place that has it all - a restaurant, two bars, and a LOUNGE that's not just a bar but actually serves food late night. Wow! what a concept. New York has been doing this for decades and San Francisco is finally catching up. \n\nThe owners of 25 Lusk know how to throw a party, and have transcended that into their new venture on a previously unknown alley in SOMA. That is all about to change when this 10,000 square foot multi-level, ultra sleek venue opens this Saturday. I was one of the lucky guests at the opening party last night, and I could not be more impressed. The design is like nothing this city has seen - including double height fire orbs, white laminated bars, mirrors, chrome and secret drinking coves behind the downstairs bar.

The ox tail was nicely flavored and presented but it wasn't a terrine in any sense of the word.  The cod was nice but a bit fishy for my taste and the veal was nice but not overly tender like you would expect, it was also a bit overdone.  The food also took quite a while and the waitress never came by to say sorry it's taking a while or anything of the sort.  While there was a lot of wait staff, somehow they weren't always there when you needed them.  My second glass of wine took a while, even though three different people asked me about it.  \n\nI would definitely come back here for drinks and brunch which is amazing and maybe a group dinner to share the whole fish or lamb, but there are plenty of other spots for dinner that I think have better food and service.", "author": "Inga W."}

The experience was better than that, primarily because\n\n1)  The interior is very impressive, and features a relatively large bar area given that the place is primarily a restaurant\n2)  The drink pours were generous, and the prices reasonable ($11 for a top-shelf martini).  Given #1, and the general prettiness of the boys and girls there, I'd expect to pay more.\n\nThe killer for the evening was the wait time on drinks.  My group of four guys waited ~20 minutes for our first round, ~10 minutes on the second, and ~25 minutes to get the bartender's attention for the check.  For perspective, I was there on a Friday night (the bar was full, standing room only).  The wait times were absolutely absurd.

Drinks were standard; appetizers were good (cheese/bread/olive plate), and service was OK, but not great.\n\nWent upstairs for dinner, and wasn't too much of a fan upstairs with the space as I was downstairs for the lounge. I could tell that they had tried to go with a more intimate feel here, because the space here is actually small, and low-lit.\n\nHowever, it seemed to be on some sort of mezzanine level from the lounge, and kind of crammed with smaller tables, larger tables for groups, and booths/banquettes.\n\nQuite frankly, the noise wafting downstairs from the lounge up through the dining mezzanine doesn't work for me if you want your dining space to be intimate. Not to mention the seating areas for different size groups mixed together makes for a crowded noisy dining area.\n\nThey also have another bar downstairs from the lounge that was more intimate than this, which really should have been the dining room. As a result, this place to me is a \"bar FIRST; restaurant, SECOND\".\n\nDining service was spot-on, and impeccable for the price point, though perhaps, this could also have been because they knew my buddy.\n\nI can't remember exactly to a tee what our dishes were (cuz the menu changes every day, I can't look it up on the web)., but if I recall correctly, to the best of my ability - \n\nFor an appetizer, I had some sort of grilled artichoke (described as such on the menu), but I was underwhelmed as it turned out to be JUST the artichoke heart, and not the rest of the artichoke! HUGE difference, if you're just not saying it's the heart-only on the menu.\n\nI ordered some sort of duck breast, and it was tender, and cooked to perfection, however, they served it with a sauce that was too sweet for my liking, so I scraped it off.\n\nFor dessert, I had some sort of strawberry shortcake, and it was to die for. It was well-balanced, creamy, and the strawberries were succulent.\n\nFor the price point, I thought that the service in the dining room was impeccable.

The croquets and the sirloin skewers were my favorites.\n\nFor dinner, we started with an arugula salad. It was a massive plate of arugula covered some cucumber dices and cannelloni beans. It wasn't over dressed and pretty good. For the entrees, we split the halibut and the short ribs. The short ribs was, by far, the superior choice. The meat was tender and the sauce (I think it was made of port) just wonderful. The potato gratin on the side was also great, not mushing and with a bit of texture, just the way I like it. The fish was good, not overcooked, but rather nondescript. I was glad that I had the fish first and then the ribs instead of the other way around because the strong flavors of the beef would completely wash out the more subtle fish.\n\nFor dessert, there were several choices served buffet style. There was a brownie, a sour lemon-ish \"soup\", a no-flour chocolate cake, a cream-puff and a little caramel/cardamon-y cake.

The beef carpaccio was okay. The raw spearfish sashimi was okay but I didn't like the texture and the flavor didn't really stand out. I had the prawns wtih grits for my entree which I thought was alright. My bf really liked his duck confit entree. \n\nOverall, our meal was pretty decent. Almost all the tables there seemed like they were on a date. If you don't have one, the lounge downstairs is the place for you.", "author": "Angelica P."}

The customer service is outstanding, and the food!.... heaven on earth. Chef Michael Dolan has a way with seafood- his octopus was so tender and flavorful.  We also had the sturgeon and the steak - both stunning, rich in flavor and perfectly cooked.  I'd be remiss if i didn't say that the garnish alone (on my magnificent cocktail) showed the kind of effort and attention to detail that was exemplified throughout the meal.  Hands down one of my best dining experiences in SF!

Initially we liked the ambience and vibes but then things went quickly downhill. This place is a bar/lounge masquerading as a restaurant. Our cocktails arrived way after we ordered (okay, it's a Saturday night so we'll cut some slack on that one). But then the wine we ordered never showed until repeated inquiries. Finally the \"wine director\"--whatever that means--showed apologetically with our wine. By the way, the wines were priced so that only a Paul Ballmer or a Donald Trump could afford most of them. This clearly is geared to the corporate set, not the neighborhood diner.\n\nBut then the dinner never showed. We finally were able to flag down our original waitress who diligently whisked herself to the kitchen (I think). She came back saying the dinners were being \"plated.\" Well the \"platers\" must have been on something that night because it was another 15 minutes before the wine director showed again and apologized with some lame saccharine diversionary statement. I said please just shoot straight on this and tell us that your kitchen couldn't handle the demand that evening. He finally agreed that this might be the best policy after all.\n\nWhen the food finally arrived it was lukewarm. My pork chop was reasonable tasty but the bad taste I had from the whole experience was dominant. Maybe it was an off night, maybe they were understaffed, but my takeaway is that it is pretentious and undeserving of its reputation.", "author": "Jackson F."}

Firstly, I did not give the staff an opportunity to correct the problem at the time. I was a guest of friends and I didn't want to seem ungrateful. Secondly, except for those two errors the food and the service was excellent. It did not deserve my original rating. Thirdly, I received such an amazing response from the owner explaining how this would be addressed to prevent it from happening again. I guess there were lessons learned on both sides! **\n\nI went to Twenty Five Lusk for the first time tonight. It was an aesthetically beautiful experience and had a generally lovely time. However, i had some serious misses with the food. I must state that I had an amazing amuse bouche and the appetizers we ordered where insanely good. My pork tenderloin came and the taste was amazing, but there was a large piece that was clearly undercooked - even for a carnivore like me. Because I was a guest of someone else, I did not make a fuss but left a large portion of uncooked meat on my plate hoping that someone would ask me about my satisfaction. i was fine with the fact that my meal so far, had been tasty, that I did not bring it up. I then ordered the brownie which came and was so doughy that I could not eat it. Again, when my dish was taken away with food uneaten, I was not asked about my enjoyment of the meal, so I did not raise the issue.\n\nOverall, I had a wonderful experience, but I have to say that there were some serious missteps with the meal that I had hoped would be addressed by my some-what subtle messages to the kitchen.

I was pretty stoked to finally make a reservation and head over to this spot on a Friday night. I walk into the restaurant and the levels of the restaurant are pretty cool. Definitely a hip joint and as I walked up to the restaurant, I was able to peer over the edge into the bar which looked sophisticated with mini fireplaces set up as well. \n\nI reach the top of the stairs and we are greeted to the hostess who promptly seats us. The d\u00e9cor of this joint is definitely cool and will definitely impress a date if you bring one. We start to peruse the vino list along with the food menu. Now this vino list is super extensive with lots of choices. I order this bangerang pinot noir which was the Etude 2010 Carneros. Seriously recommend this vino. Moving onto the menu, we start perusing the menu and decide to go with the Yukon Gold Potato Gnocchi, Veal Rib Chop, Martin Emigh's Lamb, truffle home fries, and the Grilled upside down pineapple cake.... Alright maybe we went overboard with the food but why hold back when everything looks so good. They bring out a complimentary amuse - bouche which was good along with a few pieces of bread. The Gnocchi comes out and it's pretty solid however the sauce did seem a bit salty and I am not sure I would have been able to finish all of it so I am glad there was someone else to split this appetizer with. After finishing up the appetizer the two entrees come out. Now the Veal Rib Chop was pretty solid although it was cooked a bit more than I had wanted. It was also on the fattier side which is not a huge issue but by the end of it, I was getting sick of cutting off the fat on the side. I felt the veggies (artichoke, basil, etc) paired really well with the veal so overall not bad. The lamb came out and after cutting the meat it seemed really red on the inside which was a bit strange to see. The lamb was actually tasty despite the redness of the meat so I enjoyed it. The downside of this dish was that the side ingredients including the bacon was a poor pairing. It just felt like a bunch of ingredients were poured on top of the lamb so slightly odd combination. The truffle fries were alright but definitely pass on these if you are thinking about ordering them. You are not missing out on much. After finishing up the entrees, we receive the pineapple cake and this is actually probably the highlight of the meal. The lychee sorbet was solid as well. Definitely would not mind having some more of this dessert. \n\nNow as much as I hate to evaluate food based on price I am going to have to do just that. Now I know we ordered quite a bit of food but $250+ price tag on this seemed a bit extravagant. Yes the food was fine but honestly not anything I would want to crave or come back for especially for the price tag that is associated with it. All in all, a solid joint as far as ambiance so definitely recommend bringing a date here for drinks but if you are looking for great food, I would definitely recommend other joints in the city.", "author": "Dan M."}

So I went to Yelp in search of something hip and cool. I made a reservation and told my friend that we should check out the bar/lounge area first to see if we wanted to dine there instead. He said that the menu was lacking and that we should just eat upstairs. The d\u00e9cor is beautiful and I agree with most yelpers when they say that it is totally like \"New York\". For drinks I chose my favorite drink of all time, the Dark and Stormy. The drink came out in a fat goblet and was AMAZING. \n\nFor dinner I chose the hanger steak while my friend had the duck. Both were excellent but my steak was amazing. It came in 3 strips and sat on a bed of bok choy. It also came with escargot butter. Weird eh? I ate the entire thing, something that is rare. So I'm not sure if the portions were just right or lacking. But in any case, it was amazingly delicious. For dessert we shared the bread pudding which was tasty. It didn't pack a punch but ended the meal nicely. \n\nFast forward to Tuesday, happy hour. My gf and I chose to meet up for happy hour since she works right next door. I arrived first and scoped out the seating situation. The area is large and spacious. A lot of the couches by the fire place were taken so I opted for the communal table by the bar. I ordered my usual, Dark and Stormy, and chatted it up with a few nice gentlemen throughout the night. I have to admit that this is a hip spot to meet singles. I was told that on Fridays it is a madhouse. Thank you Twenty Five Lusk for making my dating life even more interesting.", "author": "Katie Anne N."}

The lobster roll is more like a lobster bite and costs $14.

I found it quite pleasing to the tongue. \n\nThe pea ravioli and the gnocchi were both wonderful appetizer dishes: rich without being overpowering. For the main course, I ordered the salmon. The dish was wonderful, but afterward I had wished I had ordered something a bit hardier - just a matter of personal preference and not a reflection of the outstanding dish. \n\nI finished with the salted caramel brownie with mint ice cream. The flavor of the mint was rich and earthy - not the result of flavoring or syrup. Overall, the food was absolutely wonderful. Portions are on the smaller side, which is nice when you want to eat a bit of everything without feeling stuffed, but it's not the best match if you are looking for the super full feeling after dinner.

You can expect to pay somewhere between $30 - $50 per person depending on what you order and this doesn't include drinks. The portions are also pretty small. The food quality is good though. I particularly liked their quail and rib eye.\n\nWith that said, I mainly come here for the drinks, the crowd, and ambiance. The downstairs area has a really nice bar and lounge which is a great place to hang out.

It's very modern as well and we were able to see into the kitchen as they prepared food.\n\nThey had some interesting and different cocktails on the menu and a relatively good beer selection.  We ordered a variety of different dishes but I had the Carpaccio of Beef which was tasty.  For the main course I had the grilled prawns which were good but not extraordinary.  Everything was good but not the best food I've ever had.

Wow...really impressive!  \n\n2 floors; top floor is the restaurant, bottom floor is the lounge. Very upscale bar - spacious, modern, swanky - but dark?  Love the couches around the \"genie in the bottle\" gas fireplace. Kinda reminded me of  the Peppermill days. =) You could barely hear the music playing in the background and it sounded muffled.  Looked around; checked out the scene and let it all soak in - all I saw were corporate heads. After awhile, it started to feel a bit more pretentious - maybe cuz it was on a weekday and all the business people, including myself, were floating around.  Who knows what the vibe is on a Friday/Saturday night. Service was slow - i don't know where she was at most of the time. I asked for a sprite and she said they only serve \"coke in a bottle.\" Ummh, ok???  \n\nIt's a cool spot if you like that bouchie kinda feel - and I do every now and then.  4 stars for the look and feel; 3 stars for the crowd.", "author": "Diana M."}

I still love my escort filled Redwood Room but this place gives off that certain Butter NYC circa 2002  vibe.  Perfect for a first date since you can have drinks and then dinner.\n\nIf I had to go to one more synthetic fibre or \"vintage\" = goodwill filled \"authentic\" people place in San Francisco, I would throw up.   So why do I care so much about what people wear?  Well first off, I'm shallow and judgmental.  I like to look at pretty things.  AND if some stupid guy or gal is wearing plastic shoes and a cheap outfit, (s)he's not going to care about wobbling about and spilling his/her drink on one's self or my god damn special order Hermes Kelly Pouchette.  AND I CARE IF (S)HE DOES.  \n\nFear not, imports from LA, NY or somewhere, anywhere else were people have a semblance of fashion sense not found at Urban outfitters or Forever 21, 25 Lusk has lots of Louboutins, YSL Tributes and general vampy attire abound.  There's no dance floor or super drunk idiots to ruin your Alaias either.\n\nIt's a great place to perch, sip of snazzy drinks and generally just have an excuse to put on that ridiculous but you really really needed it cocktail dress.  It is annoying to park but there is valet but I know those who have exotics never valet so...your best bet is to blackhawk it at the Safeway garage across the way...don't worry, the curb & speedbump's low enough for your nose if you go in at an angle. \n\nThere is no door policy so it can get a bit \"mixed\" but generally a great vibe.  It's no Boom Boom, but hey it's as close as SF gets.\n\nAnother notable thing is that the food is FANTASTIC.  To everyone whining about tiny portions, eat less fatties.  You haven't seen elf food til you go to the Ramsey's Maze in NYC.  Best Brunch in SF since there's no wait and excellent service.

Took me long enough...\n\nHidden away on a small alley street is a venue that I'm really enjoying called 25 Lusk. Named after its address, this gorgeous brick & timber venue, that opened in 2011, has an upscale feel and sexiness not often found in San Francisco. But don't think that limits the kind of people who come here. You will find all sorts of folks in this place.\n\nWhen you enter you have a choice of heading downstairs to the bar or upstairs to their loft dining room. The lower level has very cozy seating surrounding some interesting hanging fireplaces. If you feel like chatting with the bartenders or mingling then take a seat at the bar. Another option on the lower level is a hideaway back room/walkway which is better suited for couples or smaller groups. There is a private dining room that can be used for special events on the lower level too. Upstairs in the dining area you'll find softly lit tables and a service bar that holds about 8 -10 stools for escaping the crowds downstairs.\n\nThey have a great selection of mid-level to high-end spirits here and that is something I appreciate. Beware that the prices may be a little higher here for some of your favorites but considering the sexy vibe and people you may not even care.", "author": "Gabriel R."}

We were seated promptly in the middle of the dining room with a view of the kitchen near the hostess stand.   Our drink order took awhile to be served, but it was not a big delay as others have experienced.  \n\nI started with an appetizer of a seared scallop.  Yup, that's one scallop for $14.  Was it good?  Yes.  Was it worth the amount charged?  No  It was an average sized scallop.  Although I can appreciate the work that went into preparing the dish, I thought that the portion should have been bigger.  For my entree, I ordered a roasted fish, a sea bass, I believe.  The fish was delicious and perfectly cooked.  I really enjoyed this dish and though the portion size was reasonable.  For dessert we split the sampler, which were miniature versions of some of the desserts offered that night.  I cannot remember what they were exactly, but I do remember we thought they were really good and licked the plate clean.  I would highly recommend the desserts here.  We were offered 3 amuse bouches, one of which was a gazpacho.  I loved it so much I asked for the recipe and they gave it to me!  I hope to be able to make that next summer when the fruit and vegetables for this dish are at its peak of ripeness.\n\nOur waiters were top notch.  The service is some of the best in SF and aside from the cocktails, was pretty efficient.  Perhaps it helped that one waiter recognized the birthday girl from a previous job in the FiDi.  Regardless, we were really happy with our experienced there.  Was it loud?  It was no different that many of the other restaurants in SF.  We weren't shouting, nor was I straining to hear others speak.\n\nAfter dinner we went downstairs to hang out in the bar.   Imagine a modern mashup of the Jetsons and the Peppermill, add a spoonful of hip and trendy, a dash of premium cocktails and you have the 25 Lusk bar.  Definitely a SOMA crowd with a sprinkling of the Marina thrown in here and there.  Women seemed to all be wearing 6 inch platform heels and the men were pretty dressed up themselves.  Some of the seating areas have these spaceship-like fireplaces.  Pretty cool.  They don't carry a liqueur that is the main ingredient in my drink of choice but their suggested alternative was really good!    Was it loud?  Yes.  A good place to hang out with a large group in an upscale setting.", "author": "Melissa L."}

And I'm usually at this place at least once a month. \n\n+I made reservations for 2 on a Saturday evening, which I later called back for 3. They accommodated us easily. Checked my coat in and we were seated in seconds. \n\n+The ameuse bouche is always interesting. I didn't want a first course, but my date got a very interesting soup. There was savory, a little sweet, a little spice, a little tart in that soup. I can't say I liked it, but I didn't dislike it either. It was just so curious. Probably the most interesting soup I've ever sampled.\n\n+My date ordered the steak. It was medium rare and tasted like a steak should taste: ridiculously delicious. I sampled a bite or two and was a bit jealous I didn't get it. \n\n+My date's business partner got the pork loin. She gave me a taste. My mouth went OMG! I can't begin to describe it. It was just... OMG. Next time... OMG. \n\n-I got the quail. Now, a few months ago I got the quail as well and it was grilled with figs and such. This time it was Fried Chicken Quail. I LOVE quail. But this thing was the blandest, more boring thing I have tasted in such a refined establishment. What a let down! There was ZERO flavor to it. No salt, no seasoning, nada. I sent it back. \n\n++I ordered another dish - the swordfish. And it came very, very speedy. In fact, the waitress confessed she stole it from another diner who was taking their time over the first course. Whoa! She also brought me another glass of wine that went much better (I had red wine for the quail, and she brought me a white for the fish). \n\nOverall, I have always loved this place and this experience reinforced it for me - they are professional, polite, and very, very good at their jobs. The snafu over the quail was so well taken care of with amazing aplomb. I expected to wait at least 20 minutes for them to make another dish for me, but these guys are on top of their game.", "author": "Evie D."}

In addition, we used a bloomspot, and after hearing horror stories of how other places treated people with bloomspots, we were apprehensive. Boy, were we wrong on all counts! 25 Lusk proved to be one of the best dining experiences we've had in ages. \n\nFirst off, the restaurant is sleekly gorgeous -- a perfect blend of leaving some of the old elements (did it used to be a warehouse?) and balancing them out with modern ones. Lighting is moody and subdued. \n\nThe service was impeccable -- from the friendly greeting of the woman who manned the reception desk, to our wait person (thanks, Shannon -- a true pro!), to the support staff -- all made our experience seamless and special. Everything was timed beautifully, and we never felt we were waiting for courses, nor did we feel rushed. \n\nNow for the food! We had four courses, plus a complimentary amuse bouche, cheese course, and a palate cleanser. Every bite was artistically presented, innovatively prepared and perfectly balanced. We were swooning over every morsel. Seriously, there is some magic going on in that kitchen. And those who said the portions were small must be smokin' somethin', because we found them to be HUGE!!

And boy did we, though it came at a bit higher price.  There are tons of reviews already, so let me just add my notes:\n\n- Kitchen really open til 11pm on weekends... yes!  \n- We had a few things including some superincredible beef dish... it was called \"ribeye\" on the check, but the photo looks like a marbled meat baseball - medium rare.\n- And our server recommended a few others... pork belly (though you know you're gonna get that anyway), quail, pork loin, and gnocchi.  We only failed to get something awesome when we guessed ourselves, and we only guessed once, I think on the veggies.\n- The smoking jacket: \"bloom gin, smoked bacon salt, vermouth, olive juice, smoked olives\" which I'd just call the best dirty martini I've ever had - because it had the best olives I've ever had - they smoke them themselves... amazing.  Every martini I've had since then feels like it needs more smoke.  And bacon salt.\n- The whole experience was, as my friends like to say, very \"designy\" - super cool layout with different levels, incredible attention to detail on everything from napkins to menus to chairs to bathrooms... which brings me to:\n- A somewhat humorously high level of security: two very large doormen, plus a very large bathroom attendant?

There's plenty of seating and space to stand to enjoy your drink.  The happy hour menu was surprisingly amazing.  I enjoyed the bar bites more than the food we had at the restaurant upstairs.  We ordered the lobster roll and octopus skewers.  The lobster, tucked into the toasty and buttery roll, was creamy and flavorful.  The octopus was ridiculously tender.  The server also set down an order of the Bavarian soft pretzels on accident and let us have it no charge, which I though was very nice.  Those little balls of soft pretzels with the truffly, cheesy dipping sauce were so good!  The wine available at HH was amazing as well.  I got the Malbec and he got the Sauvignon Blanc, which I preferred more and promptly traded my wine for his without any protest from him.  He's such a gentleman :)  For the bar/lounge, I give a solid 4 stars.\n\nSince we had the hh food, we skipped straight to the main dishes for dinner.  I ordered the cod while the mister ordered the duck dish.  The cod was okay.  The pickled veggies were a little overwhelming paired with the lightness of the cod.  The duck dish was actually quite good.  The sweetbreads in the dish was better than my previous experience with sweetbreads.  We also each ordered the mini cauliflower creme brulee, which was delicious!  I never would've thought to make a savory creme brulee, but it works.  For desert, we ordered the Valrhona chocolate mousse; I loved the crunchy crust under the mousse and the creamy hazelnut ice cream paired very well with the decadent chocolate.

Return visits to restaurants are very rare for me but its architecture and design are noteworthy, and the service, food and drink measure up as well as anywhere.\n\nYou can see/read about their great bar and if my friends hadn't landed that afternoon from the east coast, we'd have had a drink down there first. Instead we started with cocktails at the table. Having enjoyed the Yacht Club and Mulberry St on other visits, I chose the Dark and Stormy this time and thought tropical thoughts.\n\nFor my previous visit I'd chosen the tasting menu offered at the time. Every course was quite good.\n\nOn this recent visit three of us split the half dungeness crab and kampachi crudo, based on our server's recommendations. He steered us the right way, especially with the kampachi, which practically melted in my mouth. And BTW, the crab shell was pre-cracked for us, such that I could do the rest with my bare hands and tiny fork. What a surprise! The cracks weren't apparent at all, making the presentation that much better. \n\nMy entree was a grilled quail w fingerlings, watercress and kumquat sauce. I loved it and wanted to chew off the meat missed by my knife and fork from those tiny little bones. The meat itself was tender, the skin was flavorful, and the serving itself was large for quail. \n\nI was able to convince them to pass on sweet desserts and instead get three cheeses for $15. Can you believe we got a great deal at this restaurant? Yes, two French and a Basque, Livarot, Comte Forte, and Tomette Brebis, were served in large portions with about 10 bread slices plus very good fruit accoutrements.

Twenty Five Lusk did just that and I'm kicking myself for not trying this place sooner.  Ah well, we did finally go - and it was worth every penny.\n\nWe started off with the sweet potato and apple soup, and the potato gnocchi.  First of all, the soup - beautifully smooth with cinnamon and fresh basil on top.  When the bowl is set on the table, you just smell that wonderful cinnamon.  Delicious.  \n\nThe potato gnocchi was amazing.  Soft pillows of potato with grilled artichokes, Parmesan, olives and a touch of truffle oil.  As my husband declared, he could have eaten a platter full of these.\n\nFor entrees, hubby had the Blue Nose bass.  Wonderfully prepared fish with a veggie medley that had carrots, beans, leeks, and a fantastic sauce.  \n\nFor me, the flat iron steak.  OMG... I'm usually all about the Bearnaise sauce, but this not only had that, but came with two other sauces on the plate.  One was a dark syrah sauce, the other a cranberry sauce.  The three together was an explosion of flavor in your mouth that just tasted better and better with each bite.\n\nA must try is the Cauliflower creme brulee.  Seriously, it's a creme brulee with cauliflower puree in it.  Carmelized sugar on top and everything.  To balance the slight sweet, they put arugula and pickled fennel on top.  Yes, and there's truffle in this dish too.  Crazy rich, but oh so worth it.  Better to share.  \n\nSince every thing was so over the top fantastic, we had to try some dessert, even though we were stuffed.  We ordered the dessert sampler, which came with mini (and I mean MINI) portions of vanilla lime posset, salted caramel swirl brownie, and the passionfruit brulee.  Of course, each main dessert item came with it's own little accompaniments - which included kiwi bits, mint chocolate chip ice cream, and pina colada sorbet.\n\nI can't rave enough about this place.  All that food for $120 (no tip yet).  No alcohol.  \nReally not too bad.  Not an everyday dinner place, but certainly worth it for a romantic night out with the hubby.", "author": "Denise M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-28", "description": "I had a 24-person dinner at 25 Lusk's private dining room the evening of January 21, 2012, in honor of my wife's birthday. As a newcomer to the SF bay area, I sought far and wide for such a venue to host this party, and numerous personal recommendations pointed me to the restaurant/lounge.\n\nCoordinating the logistics for this private dining event was tough. Nikki Boucard, 25 Lusk's Private Dining Manager, was affable, however, she poorly communicated details via e-mail about menu options. Instead of calling me to coordinate the details, I had to call her to ensure we were on the same page. Aside from eventually agreeing to pay a nonsensical $3/person charge for \"cake cutting,\" (mind you, we brought our own cupcakes, and the staff simply placed the boxes in the room!), we eventually came to terms on the menu and price. [25 Lusk eventually refunded this to me.]\n\nThis left me feeling that 25 Lusk did not care I was bringing committed revenue to them. This was felt in their minimal flexibility on price and menu, for example. Yes, I understand it is a super-hot location, and that there may be reasons preventing greater flexibility. However, I'm in the software industry, and if I EVER had a customer that \"came to me,\" saying, \"I'd like to give you money (partly in advance!) for a product,\" servicing this customer would be the first thing on my mind. That did not seem to be the case with 25 Lusk.\n\nThe venue is beautiful, the food (and wine) was delicious (particularly the Yukon Gold Potato Gnocchi and the Grilled Ribeye Steak), and the wait staff was attentive and courteous. General feedback from my party was that mostly everything went great.\n\nMy plans to keep the group together after dinner by moving to the lounge area was thwarted, however, due to an apparent water main break (said Nathan Sheeran, 25 Lusk's Assistant General Manager) that flooded the lounge/private dining level's bar area, and caused an eventual early shut-down of the entire venue. Since the women's' bathrooms were shut down, my guests - including my wife- waited in line for 30 minutes (during her own party) to use the mens' bathroom. Afterwards, my wife said she complained - while on line - to a seemingly unsympathetic Sheeran about this, who said there was nothing he could do, and that there were no other bathrooms in the venue. Again, the lack of customer service from 25 Lusk's management to my wife or her party during this moment is in-line with my previous statement about the restaurant's management not caring about committed revenue.\n\nA few days after the event, I spoke with Chad Bourdon, 25 Lusk's General Manager, about my experience. He was respectful, courteous, and thankful for the feedback I provided directly to him and his staff. He said the water main leak made things difficult at the restaurant, but that it didn't excuse his staff's behavior. He has offered to bring my wife and I back to the restaurant to dine again...on his dime. A classy move on his part, and something I hope the rest of the staff learns from.", "author": "Sunil J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-10-02", "description": "My husband and I decided to visit Twenty Five Lusk on a Monday night to celebrate a special occasion. We had heard so much about the chic interior, master mixologist and semi-celebrity chef, but was surprised to secure a reservation fairly easily with little notice.\n\nThe interior is indeed beautiful and I liked the fact that the architect designed the restaurant with a modern, romantic feel, but maintained the brick and wood beams. The firepit is an elegant touch (dare I say \"sexy?\").\n\nThe host was friendly and promptly showed us to a quiet corner table. Save for a large group that appeared to be dining together for a business function, the restaurant had many open tables. \n\nOur server greeted us and was polite, but not warm. It did take approximately 10 minutes for the drinks to arrive, but we were enjoying the warm bread (I only had a few bites to save room for dinner), room-temperature butter and specialty salt. So far, things were going well.\n\nWhen the server came back to take our order, I asked for her feedback on a handful of options, as I am a vegetarian. I was surprised that she offered a salad, a couple of appetizers doubled up for a main course or a plate of grilled vegetables that apparently the chef will sometimes prepare for people with similar requests. Surprised by the salad or grilled vegetable recommendations, largely because I could have easily prepared something similar at home and neither option sounded very inventive, I ordered the parsnip soup as my appetizer (it could be made vegetarian) and a doubled-up lemon ravioli order (separate from the drinks and any desserts, my meal would have been a reasonably-priced $40ish dollars at this point). My husband eats everything and decided to be more adventurous with the multi-course tasting menu.\n\nThe server came back several minutes later to explain to me that the chef prefers when both diners have the same number of courses, so one diner does not eat alone during the meal. If were to go this route, there were not a large number of options for vegetarians. She recommended I leave these decisions to the capable chef, but did make the suggestion that he prepare something green along the way (since the soup and ravioli I had originally ordered were neither and was seeking some balance). I decided to trust her judgment.\n\nThe first course arrived quickly. My soup was fairly good, but I am sure it would have been enhanced with the addition of seafood or fish. I believe that was listed on the original menu. My husband also enjoyed his first course, which was a fresh sweetwater oyster. \n\nFollowing this course, the wait between courses became excruciating at times, averaging 20-30 minutes (yes, sometimes more!) after our plates were cleared. My husband had an empty wine glass for some time and it was the astute sommelier who eventually approached us and asked if my husband wanted another glass. My cocktail was empty for more than 25 minutes before I flagged the server to bring me another one (different kind, this time). She then asked AFTER I ordered the new cocktail, \"Oh, are you finished with that one?\" To her surprise, I had finished so long ago that the ice had melted and it looked like water sitting in the base of the glass!\n\nThe second course consisted of ONE lemon ravioli, which was by far my best course. It was so good, that I longed for the double order I had originally ordered, which would have consisted of four raviolis. My husband liked his seared branzino.\n\nGnocchi arrived as my third course. I did like the sear on the gnocchi and you could tell it was clearly housemade, but the dish did not have nearly as much flavor as the ravioli. Additionally, I was surprised that the chef decided to give me another pasta/carb dish immediately following the ravioli. On the other hand, my husband did enjoy the duck breast and liked the cassoulet preparation.\n\nAgain, another half hour later, my fourth course arrived and was...you guessed it...another carby dish. The chef had prepared risotto with mushrooms. I was so carbed up from the ravioli and gnocchi that I may have experienced a visceral reaction when the dish was presented to me. I ate 2/3 of the risotto, but it was not mind-blowing and I was full. Again, my husband enjoyed his dish - elk.\n\nMy final dishes were four gingered cubes of watermelon - much needed, at this point - and a deconstructed tiramasu, which was was very difficult to eat and lacked the creaminess that one typically appreciates about good tiramasu. The teeny ladyfingers were too dense to absorb the dessert wine that supposedly substituted for rum.\n\nI never did receive greens (or anything to balance all of the carbs) and was charged the exact same price as my husband's full tasting menu. I had planned to spend some money because we were celebrating, but would have appreciated the head's up. Needless to say, I was surprised.\n\nWe're wondering if we should bother with another visit - maybe we'll try the lively bar scene.", "author": "Rachel P."}

I ate here a few years ago and thought it was pretty good - would have given it a 3 star.

Only one dish was fairly good - the wagyu beef main dish.  Everything else was pretty bad, including the pork (fatty), octopus (gummy) and scallops (way, way over seasoned).   Even the desserts were mediocre.\n\nWe like the decor, and the service is OK (they try hard).

The flavors are all masterfully combined, and I have never had a single bite that I felt was lacking in any way.\n\n- Be sure to arrive early and enjoy the lounge downstairs [with two tableside fireplaces!] before your reservation time. The cocktails are delicious and refreshing.\n\n- Best ambiance of any restaurant I've been to. It's designed by a foreign architect, and it's awe-inspiring. The colors are dark, and there is a very expensive and polished, yet slightly industrial feel to the place. It's fantastic. You can see through glass into the entire kitchen when you're upstairs-- a quality that commands constant excellence from the chefs.\n\n- Good service. The server was fun, and didn't mind explaining what a dish was to me, when I questioned a bit of terminology on the menu. Also, the first time I went with my boyfriend, we got the chef's tasting menu with wine parings, and the staff treated us royally every single time they came over with another glass or course.\n\n- 25 Lusk may be upscale and expensive, but the atmosphere is very comfortable. Feel free dress anywhere from 'smart casual' to moderately formal. Usually I wear a casual dress and heels. My boyfriend wore a suitcoat, button up, and jeans, and our roomate wore a full suit.\n\n- Although the food is very upscale, they do not skimp on the portions. This is a fancy restaurant that serves appropriate portions!

The food was excellent - we started with tasty burrata salad with seasonal fruit- ripe pomegranate and persimmons which was absolutely delish and brown rice bacon soup. The broth was salty (just the way I like it) and balanced nicely with the brown rice. My husband had the fried chicken that had zero fat, skin or bone - because they had pulled off the meat, deep fried it with buttermilk and put it back together- it was extremely tender and juicy, best I've ever had when it comes to fried chicken. I had the pork chop with spatzel and bacon and the chop was juicy, bone in, meat lover's paradise served with bacon spatzel that my husband couldn't refrain from stealing from my plate. Our waiter was amazing, really attentive and you could really see the teamwork between the staff as they had impeccable manners, checked in on is often and cleared out plates as needed. The service was one of the best- probably top 5 I remember. The ambiance and setting was really to my liking as well- they had a great selection of music playing at a comfortable volume, the cedar beams gave the room that urban feel mixed in with rustic and modern metallic structures.

They have great priced bottles of wines and their Pretzels with Truffle oil/sauce is to die for!  \n\nBut my main review is for their upstairs dinner service.  We recently checked out their restaurant since we bought a Bloomspot deal.  The evening started off great with our warm and friendly waitress Elizabeth.  There were two of us but only one of us had the Bloomspot deal.  So we ended up ordering other dishes so we could have a taste of different things.  Well, two courses into our dinner the most unthinkable thing that could happen at a restaurant happens (I'd rather not say exactly and spare everyone the details).  At no real fault of the restaurants, it caused for an un enjoyable situation.  \n\nWe brought the situation to Elizabeth's attention and she squashed it immediately.  The manager, Nathan, came right over and apologized for the occurrence.  He was geniunely embarrased and wanted to make it up to us.  He went above and beyond to make it up to us.  Check out their service to us:\n\n1) They began bringing us two servings of the Bloomspot deal eventhough we only bought one,\n2) They brought us a second serving of our favorite Pretzel with Truffle sauce (oh, btw, the dish didn't come with the truffle sauce so our fantastic waitress brought us a side of it!)\n3) We were given two glasses of Champagne (the real stuff!) and a tasting of their port just because my friend wanted to taste it, \n4) They gave us an extra dessert, \n5) Nathan gave us back our Bloomspot coupon so we could use it another time,\n6) And to top it all off the entire bill was comp'd!\n\nAnd to put it way over the top, we asked the restuarant to call us a cab.  We were leaving around the same time the Giants game was letting out so we knew it would be hard to get one.  Low and behold our fantastic waitress Elizabeth rushes out and hails one down for us.  That's what I call service!\n\nNathan and Elizabeth provided us with top notch service that made it a memorable evening.  The food was not only amazing, they know how to treat their customers.

Hats off to Cass Calder Smith for his impeccable design of the mutilevel space though. I was loving the exposed brick walls, floating metallic firepits, and private booths tucked away behind the bar area. \n\nThat being said, the bar area is one of my gripes. While the suspended shelves brimming with glowing bottles of liquor are aesthetically pleasing, it's the only bar servicing the whole lounge, which makes ordering drinks quite a difficult task. Just short of shoving people aside and then shouting and flapping your arms to get a bartender's attention, getting a drink is not a leisurely matter. The only section of the bar where people don't seem to congregate is the far right end of it (near the stairs). So, I suggest placing drink orders here. \n\nAs for the drink menu, quite a large variety of libations are offered. And since I'm a sucker for girly mixed drinks, I opted for two of their cocktails: The Blooming Riviera, featuring crisim organic hibiscus liqueur,  elderflower syrup, lime, and prosecco and The Grapefruit Gimlet, featuring broker's gin, dry vermouth, grapefruit, lime, simple syrup, and angostura bitters. Both cocktails were to my liking, and for $11 a pop, they were pretty reasonably priced too. \n\nDespite the appealing atmosphere and delicious drinks, Twenty Five Lusk fell a little short because I didn't care for its pretentious vibe.

I am officially adding this place to my Boycott for Life list (along with Osha Thai on Second St. and Yellow Cab Taxi).\n\nI've been here on multiple occasions, since we live so close by and friends somehow want to keep having their parties here. \n\nIt's overpriced, the service is bad, and did I mention the service is bad?\n\nThe first time we went, we were a group of about 50 gathered for a going-away party. In the middle of each of these \"cubbyholes\" that they have, they've fixed a structure in the middle that is completely useless except for decorative purposes. However, its flat surface is pretty convenient to set drinks down on, since the place desperately lacks enough tables and seating.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had set our drinks down on this nice, shiny, flat surface while chatting to a friend. A server comes along, makes us pick up our drinks again, and yells at us, telling us that no drinks were to be placed on this surface.\n\nAfter my first time, I knew better than to wear heels to this place - the lack of sufficient seats make it torture for a girl.\n\nThe second time, I noticed many many many many people setting their drinks down on the shiny fixture ... and no one yelled at them. When I asked a passing server, she said \"Of course, that's what it's there for.\" WTF? Why did that other person yell at me then?\n\nI was a little confused but let it go. Halfway through my drink, I set it down (confidently) on the world's tiniest side table while talking with a friend of mine. \n\nRepeat, the drink was still half full.\n\nA server decided to come by and whisk it away without even asking if I was done or not. What's worse, she was dumping the remnants of other drinks into my drink (putting the liquids into one cup) so she could stack the glasses. \n\nWhen I said \"Wait, I wasn't done with that,\" there was no apology.\n\nInstead, she said \"Sorry. Maybe you should drink faster.\"\n\nThe last and final time was for a friend's birthday party. We were a huge group accounting for half the people in the space. I had brought a small cake in a bakery box for her birthday, and asked a server to bring us some plates and forks.\n\nThis cake serves maybe 6 to 8 people. It was a small cake.\n\nAfter I had cut and served to my friend, the manager comes by and says: \n\n\"Oh by the way there's a cake cutting fee of 5 dollars for each person that's eating cake.\"\n\nAll of us put our plates down, and we said \"Oh, we're so sorry we didn't know. Never mind then, we'll put the cake away.\" \n\nHe said \"I'm still going to have to charge you, since the plates have been dirtied (I had put one cake piece on a plate.)\"\n\nWhy they couldn't tell us about the cutting fee as we were asking for the plates and forks is beyond me.\n\nThe manager's argument was that it costs money to wash dishes and forks (labor cost), and since we were bringing in outside dessert instead of ordering from their restaurant, it was only fair to charge a cake cutting fee. According to him, \"all the places in SF do it.\"\n\nNow here's my argument.\n1) You say all the places in SF do this? District Wine Bar, which is right around the corner, does not. In fact, when I threw the boyfriend's birthday party there, they brought us 30 dishes and kept them coming. They were smart enough to realize we filled half the venue.\n\n2) We were in the downstairs lounge area, not the restaurant. So you can't even order their restaurant's dessert anyway. So how are we robbing you of your dessert sales?\n\n3) Why didn't the doorman tell me no outside food allowed? Or even better, why didn't the server tell me about cake cutting fees?\n\nThe cake cost 12 dollars, but the cake cutting fee set me back another 20 bucks. We argued and negotiated this cost down, from the initial $60 they were going to charge (I had cut into 8 pieces but apparently he counted 12 people about to eat cake.)\n\nThis is stupid. So I am boycotting 25 Lusk for life.", "author": "Mary M."}

I like how they incorporated the brick walls of the original structure into the restaurant. It adds that SF Soul that so many restaurants are lacking. My boyfriend and I had dinner with one of our favorite couples and we all agreed that it was a great restaurant. \n\nI highly recommend 25 Lusk for Valentine's day, or any other special night out with your honey. The food was incredible.  For our first courses we had bone marrow (to die for), fresh Dungeness crab legs, and a nice bisque.  The bone marrow was served with a nicely poached egg and fresh greens. The crab legs were fresh and the bisque was tasty. For my main course I had the pork loin chop with grilled cornbread. The pork chop was perfectly cooked and the grilled cornbread added a nice balance. We all shared the cauliflower creme brulee and it was delicious. Their bar is fully stocked with the best spirits and their specialty cocktails are tasty and inspired. Our server was knowledgeable, professional,  and very nice. Overall 25 Lusk is awesome and we'll definitely be back.", "author": "Othilia F."}

I've been here before for dinner and often for after work drinks. Those experiences were neither amazing nor awful. They have good drinks and food, but the company on all those occasions eclipsed everything else.\n\nThe meal started out fine. I was happy to see that they had a printed menu for the prix fix option and we had brought our own wine to enjoy.  The waitress was friendly and made some jokes about bringing straws for the wine. Everything was going well until the warm bread they brought cooled down.\n\nIt took a bit of time for the first course to come out. That being said it was worth the wait - the prawns were delicious! Thank goodness too because it was about another 30 minutes before the next course came out. We attempted to hint that it had been quite some time, but there was nothing said to admit the inconvenience. During that wait, one of the staff members clearing another table swiped the dish too quickly causing the leftover soup to spill all over our table, and the chair with our jacket and bag. Very sloppy for an upscale restaurant and on top of that there was no apology! After waiting for some acknowledgment of the incident from our waitress, we finally had to bring it up ourselves. She hadn't been informed and said she was sorry. \n\nShe called the manager who came by to apologize and gave us his business card to bring the dry cleaning bill. Honestly, it felt awkward for the burden to be put on the customer. I can't imagine having to bring a dry cleaning bill to a restaurant asking them to pay for the $15-20 fee. They could have easily done something more immediate like most restaurants seem to do like waive the corkage fee (which would be of NO cost to them really).\n\nWe finished the meal and asked for the check. They had surprisingly already calculated an 18% tip on our two person meal! Despite our using the bloodspot coupon, the meal ended up costing over $80 each. More than anything it was upsetting that the string of elementary mistakes occurred at an upscale restaurant that didn't act promptly to remedy the situation.  \n\nOverall, despite the good food, the subpar experience left a bad taste in our mouths. This place still needs a lot of improvement before it can compete with SF's top spots.", "author": "Heesun L."}

As the menu has changed since then, I can't offer specifics about current dishes.\n\nTwenty-Five Lusk would be a good choice if you're looking for a place in SOMA that's both upscale and hip. It's not an inexpensive meal, but that isn't exactly a distinction which it needs to bear alone as part of the San Francisco restaurant scene.\n\nThe restaurant is in a part of town that we don't find ourselves in very often, where dinner is concerned. It's just a few blocks from the ballpark, and might be an option for a bite to eat or a drink before or after a Giants game. The clientele had a look to them which I wasn't accustomed to; I imagined that it was simply a SOMA crowd.\n\nWe loved the restaurant's interior. The space has a very polished, modern look and yet has a warmth to it that's inviting. You want to be there. Their take on the restaurant / lounge idea is one of the best that I've seen. The two are at once a part of the same space and separate from each other, with part of the lower-level lounge sharing a ceiling with the upper-level eatery.\n\nWe went on a Saturday evening, and at some point during the meal, I noticed that the noise level downstairs had gone up considerably. When we finished our dinner, we left via the lounge, and found it packed to the gills. It had the vibe of an upscale club, which was a very different feel from the more refined evirons above. The scene was a bit of a meat market. Note that the only bathrooms are on this level.\n\nThey had one item on the menu which was over two-hundred dollars (an apparently large piece of very high-quality beef), which the waiter suggested was good for three people to share. Well, there were only two of us, and I wasn't about to inflict that kind of pain on my wallet. So, I opted for another beef dish, a succulent and juicy concoction, delicious and presented on a bed of roasted vegetables. My wife had a risotto dish which she liked very much. We also got a side of the Japanese Pepper Grits. I thought the idea was imaginative; the dish itself was fine, though ultimately forgettable.\n\nWe had two cocktails (a Dark and Stormy and a Grapefruit Gimlet). Both were well done.\n\nThe wait staff was personable, polished and helpful. They had the right amount of attentiveness, which is one of those things that's part conscious effort and part a negotiation of the environment. With diners, other wait staff, drink and food orders all taking up their time, the staff still managed to provide the right amount of attention to us. It's a skill which the staffs of many restaurants lack; it's something that I appreciate when I see it, and long for when it's not present.\n\nI can see us paying another visit here, as it's a nice counterpoint to the more typical destinations for us elsewhere in the City.\n\nRecommended. :-)", "author": "Steve R."}

We made reservations for a large group for brunch here, and found the place to be SO swanky and fun. Huge multi level restaurant offers so many seating styles and arrangements from bar seating to private curtain pulled booths, to large open areas. Fireplaces, brick walls, industrial feel, plush black leather chairs, and good music...very very into the ambiance. We were seated in a private upstairs back room that comfortably held our group of 10. The rest of the restaurant was surprisingly kinda empty. \n\nThe service was good, nothing exceptional, nothing bad. The brunch menu is limited but offers something for everyone such that nothing is really missing from the menu - that's fine with me. The brunch drinks come with steep prices, especially for the quantity of alcohol in some of them, but the bloody mary was good, with unique additions like thai chili etc. The dishes themselves were not especially well executed and I've certainly had far better food elsewhere. I did appreciate the complimentary pastries that came out for the table because the food took quite a long time. That, and the fact that we were with a large group made the wait time not nearly as noticeable as it otherwise would've been. The entree prices are also a little steep but again you're paying for the atmosphere. I ordered the tuna tartare plate and poached eggs. The tuna was good, but nothing amazing, the eggs came out boiled instead of poached and it took them a long time to bring me poached eggs back. Husband had crab benedict which was good, but again, nothing memorable. \n\nI probably won't return for brunch, but would love to come back for happy hour or dinner and try the other food. I think they only recently started serving brunch but unless the food gets better, there's no reason for anyone to choose this places over SO MANY other amazing brunch spots in SF. \n\nOh, and parking is easy in the area, which is always a plus.", "author": "Piyali F."}

I've even had busboys start friendly conversations with me when it was appropriate to do so.  When I made one of the reservations I asked that they not bring a wine or cocktail menu to the table when they seated us.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-12-09", "description": "If I were just noting the sprawling, bi-level industrial-chic space and the warm hospitality of every server and bartender at Twenty Five Lusk, I'd easily give them five stars. But unfortunately, that's only half of the experience.\n\nI've now been to Twenty Five Lusk two times, and both times were completely different from the other. The inaugural visit was with a group of chums looking for a few quality cocktails in the confines of the lower bar level. The space is very warm and cozy despite the trendy exposed brick/iron beam aesthetic that shows no signs of losing popularity among restaurant designers anytime soon. It's the type of place where you can really kick your feet up and hang for a while, but that's only possible if the elegance is backed up by an equally superb product. That's where Twenty Five Lusk loses me a bit. In this instance, the specialty cocktails didn't wow me in the least. So little so that I don't even remember what I ordered, and it was only about two weeks ago when I first sipped one of their hand crafted libations. In a city that really appreciates a finely crafted drink, I feel like they don't compete with some of the middle or heavyweights in the cocktail octagon. They do have a pretty impressive wine and beer list, though, so that's what I stuck to for the remainder of the stay, but I was really looking forward to a fine elixir.\n\nSecond visit was all about the food. Let me start this off by saying I don't consider myself a raging foodie, but I'm not necessarily a complete imbecile either (hold your jokes, people). There's no way you'd find me in a contentious debate over superior cuisine in Rome or Milan, but I can tell you whether or not I buy into a menu concept -- and in this case, I just don't get it. Their menu and presentation, to me, is the equivalent of a high society debutante toting around a miniature canine in a Gucci bag. I suppose it looks kind of cool if that's what tickles your fancy, but it's clearly just a fashion statement. That's not to say the grilled quail and top lamb sirloin looked or tasted like a three pound dwarf poodle, but why would I spend $40+ on an itty bitty canap\u00e9 and one main entree when I could hit a place like Chapeau and get an exceptional 3-course French dinner for $38? It just doesn't make sense to me or my wallet. And don't get me wrong -- I'm not a big eater at all and I fully invest in the idea of eating small, but delicious plates of food, but it's nearly impossible to do so at such a high price point. Unless, of course, you're Barry Zito and you've made $3,731 since beginning to read this review four minutes ago. \n\nDon't let the three star deter you (the quip associated is A-OK, after all), as it's a space to be reckoned with. But if you're a bit of a cocktail snob who's critical on gourmet sustenance, it might not blow your socks off.", "author": "Ruggy J."}

Everything in the restaurant- from the architecture, decor, food and pleasant staff- just blew me away.  Twenty Five Lusk could possibly be my dream loft- I felt like I was lounging at home and had invited everyone else over for a party.\n\nThe cocktails set the stage for a fabulous evening. My boyfriend ordered the Red Monkey (twice): buffalo trace bourbon, gran classico bitter, dolin sweet vermouth, mint, angostura bitters.   I adored my SF Yacht Club: blue ice potato vodka, cucumber, lemon, lime mint. \n\nFor the first course we had the asparagus terrine and the potato gnocchi with shortrib.  I'm Italian and my mom makes gnocchis from scratch, so I am a harsh critic when it comes to these lovely potato pillows.  The chef nailed it- not only did they melt on your tongue, but were slightly grilled on one side which added a completely different texture and taste experience. The shortrib was huge and separated into tender pieces with barely a touch of the knife. \n\nFor the main course my boyfriend had the Oregon Steelhead with citrus marinated fennel, dungeness crab, lobster beignet and black garlic.  I chose the Alaskan true cod, smoked paprika fregola, baby chard and wild arugula coulis.  The presentation was gorgeous and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The Steelhead blew us both away- it is destined to become their signature dish. \n\nDessert brought some surprises as well. We ordered a  panna cotta with fresh pineapple, and honey- lemon sauce.  The texture was divine, and the sauce was almost watery, not creamy.  It was light, fresh and summery, spiked with hints of cinnamon. After dinner we descended into the lounge for coffee, grappa and people-watching next to a suspended fireplace.  \n\nI am in love with this place.", "author": "Lisa R."}

And like when out in Manhattan, expect to spend $$$.

(Hawaii - Scottsdale, AZ - SF- Tokyo - Phuket in 3 weeks no joke)  Needless to say she has the most refined palate, as she is an international events director for a technology company with endless budgets.  I needed to impress.\n\n25 Lusk DID impress.  Let's start with the service- they were the kindest accommodating staff.  Even the GM came out to check on us and explain the course pace.  Great job there!  We were a party of 8, and they originally noted that with large parties they require a $750 minimum.  Yikes to some of the guests, however they were fine with waving that... the bill ended up being somewhere close to $1000.  Oh well on that!\n\nMy philosophy is to get what the restaurant is known for if it is your first time, so I went with the tasting menu for $78.  OMG!  Not only did everything melt in your mouth in unique combinations that grew my own culinary palate...  I now like Elk!  Honestly it was so much food!  Well worth your money.  The menu changes weekly.  Add the wine pairings for an extra $40 dollars & it's a great deal. The folks who got that really enjoyed it.\n\nSeriously order your own bowl of their Japanese grits.  What you say?!  Yes do it... I think I'm going back just for that.\n\nOur waitress suggested an amazing Pinot Noir from Santa Barbara that is now one of my favorite wines ever!  Thanks for that!\n\nLastly, when I checked into Foursquare at 25 Lusk it mentioned that they have WiFi & invite co-working there!

Had you not been almost as expensive as a night out at Gary Danko, I'd have considered five. Like a 25-year old Marina girl in Manhattan, you are nice to look at and delicious to taste but not nearly as sophisticated as you think.\n\nOh, Lusk, it's fun watching the Ferraris, Lamborghinis, and Bentleys pull up with great and boisterous fanfare. Your tequila sours are incredible. The combination of banana-ketchup with sweet potato fries was nothing less than inspired and the tempura bacon will bring me back against my better financial judgement; if only just for the appetizers.\n\nThe crowd was friendly enough to anyone wearing the right uniform and providing the mid-society postures as if to say without speaking \"I belong here, I'm one of you, and I'll be making twice as much as I do now in three more years\" but my blue-collar buddies always peel off one drink into the evening. Of course they go to bars where the graffiti says things like \"Please flush twice, it's a long way to the Marina\" - so it's an unfair thing for me to bring up.\n\nLusk, the comparisons to the Tipsy Pig & Americana seem unfair. The entire experience you provide is head, shoulders, and an Olympic pole-vault above what would be found at the Marina pub some compare you to. Why then does this happen?\n\nBecause, Lusk, you are the Tipsy Pig with stock options and a startup.\n\nStill, you know how to host quite the cocktail party.", "author": "Ian A."}

We all got to sample each others food and were very satisfied with all the choices.

I read up on the place (via Yelp reviews) before heading there so I was forewarned about the bartenders and their less than positive and friendly attitude towards patrons. At first I thought the reviewers were wrong but unfortunately, but the end of the night, I realized they were right.  They think they're way too cool. \n\nMy friend asked the bartender to make her a drink and said \"I like Vodka drinks, but nothing too sweet\".  He followed up with \"do yo like Ginger and lime?\" and she immediately said yes because we started the night at my house with Moscow Mules (vodka, lime and ginger beer).  He started making her a drink and we saw him pour a dark brown alcohol.  Since when is vodka dark brown?  It's not.  He was puring rum and made her a dark and strormy.  It was good, if you like rum, lots of spices, and a really sweet drink.  Basically is was the exact opposite of what she asked for.  She didn't drink it and pauned it off on some guy she met at the bar.\n\nThis same bartender also insisted on making me one of their speciality drinks.  I forget the name but its basically a margarita made with gin.  I told him I did not like Gin and he said \"trust me\".  I did... and you know what? I still do not like Gin but drank it anyway so as to not offend him.\n\nThe bartender also made it seem like these two drinks were going to be on the house.  Mine especially since he insisted on making it for me.  Had we known he was going to charge us for 2 drinks that we did not want, we would have sent them back.\n\nThe venue is really cool, the music is ok, and the drinks are expensive.  The best drink on their list is the SF Yacht Club.  It's delicious.  It's a good spot for one or two before headling elsewhere for more fun.  I doubt I'll be suggesting this as a place to go back to.", "author": "Sabrina S."}

Basically, my thoughts about it are all over the place and so I think the best way to handle this is by categories. \n\nVenue \n- This is one of the most visually striking restaurants in the city that I can recall in recent memory. Built in a loft space, it's a huge restaurant that is somewhat made more intimate by its layout (dark panelling, very dim lighting, luxurious touches). The downstairs area hosts a bar and lounge area where there is seating around fireplace futuristic fireplaces that are hung from the ceiling and lends a creative/trendy vibe. There are also very intimate alcoves in the back where you have even less lighting. Upstairs, there is seating in the open area as well as private rooms off the side for larger parties. This is definitely the type of place I would think of taking out-of-town friends from NY or LA. \n\nDrinks \n- The drink menu is quite extensive and consists of cocktails, beers, wine and liquor. For the most part, the drinks look and taste great ... as long as you keep it simple (e.g. Manhattan, single-malt scotch). On the other hand, cocktails like the Mulberry Street (whiskey, vermouth, campari, angostura and orange bitters, burnt orange) were disappointing as the drink was way too bitter and ruined what could have been an interesting combination. \n\nFood \n- For all its glamour and hype, the food was overall, quite average. The menu reads very interesting with terrines and salmon pastrami and duck prosciutto but the execution of the dishes fell flat. \n\nThe foie gras torchon served with mini dried figs was good but not spectacular. The accompanying brioche toast could have used more crunch and the torchon itself was somewhat bland. \n\nThe pork chop entree had good quality meat that wasn't too fatty ... but the richness of the dark thyme sauce overpowered the entire dish. \n\nDining companions also noted that their dishes (grilled prawns, chicken) were too salty. \n\nConcluding thoughts \n- I definitely can see myself coming back to 25 Lusk ... for drinks. The vibe of the place is great (although it is a bit of a downer to see such a large space feel so empty by the lack of other patrons). Think I'd pass on dinner ... except maybe to have a few of the piping hot dinner rolls.", "author": "F. P."}

The Oysters were the best I've ever tasted and I mean ever.  My favorite wine with this meal was a Pinot Noir from Peay.  It had a smokey, BBQ taste to it that literally had me edging for more.

The amount of effort (and I'm guessing $$) that went into every last detail is clear.\n\nWe had a lovely sit down dinner for three with drinks, apps, dinner and dessert.  We tried a little bit of everything to see if the hype is all it's cut out to be and I think my overall assessment is that yes, it definitely is.  There are a lot of interesting things on the menu that play with texture and ideas- mushroom cheesecake, parsley sorbet, horseradish gel\u00e9e, champagne granite, chocolate ravioli, creme brulee with lemongrass... everything we had was delicious.  I had the hanger steak for my main course, and the red wine reduction was a very simple classic dish but was incredibly well done and the meat melted in my mouth.\n\nMy only complaint is similar to some of the other reviews here, and is about portion size.  We ordered the dessert sampler and we were warned by our server that the portions were small, and there was indeed only a single bite's worth of food per dish.  They did throughout the course of the night bring out several samples of dishes for the table to try, which was a great way to get a taste of some of the other fun things on the menu and distracted us from the small portion sizes.  At the end of the night, our bill seemed pretty reasonable for the amount of food we had ordered with drinks and all.  I actually thought we'd end up spending a lot more.\n\nWe had a wonderful experience and I'm looking forward to going back.  I think next time we might take a stab at the bar downstairs and order off the bar menu since the dinner menu upstairs is completely separate and they don't allow any cross over.", "author": "Laura S."}

I think it is because it is one of the few lounges in SF that reminds me of NY. The fact that it has issues and is mildly pretentious is why i like it. I haven't had dinner here, only appetizers once, had the ravioli, it's really creamy but very good. Drinks and food can be expensive depending on what you get, more things that remind me of NY (not in a good way). Think it is a great spot for fri or sat night drinks with friends or after work with co-workers. Service is slow but how much can you expect from a packed bar. \n\nSF is not a dress up in heels and deck yourself out scene. It's more tech startup millionaire who wears a tshirt and jeans. However this place attracts a crowd of people that makes an effort to dress up (sometimes), if you don't care for this, you probably won't like this place. It's trendy, low-lighting, lots of couches and high bars stools and tables and an upstairs dining area. I've done a lot of socializing here, feel like i meet finance + startup + fb / google.

Bar is hip, drinks are expensive, cool atmosphere.  Basically, a normal of scene for this kind of bar, no bad surprises.  So far so good...\n\n2) Saturday was first time for dinner.  For starters the food was very disappointing.  It's priced high though....  Even the plating was really lame.  But here's the real kicker: when the average entree price is between $25-35, and the waiter mentions the \"Wagu Beef Special\" that's not on the menu, you might expect that the special would be priced a little higher than the other entrees.  Maybe $40, 50, even $60???   You might also expect the waiter to tell you how much the special cost.  If you expected that, you would be wrong.\n\nOne of my friends ordered the special, did not ask how much it was, and the waiter did not tell him the price.  More specifically, the waiter did not tell him the price was....$212.\n\nWTF???  Either the waiter was dishonest/deceptive, or he was a raging idiot.  How can you not tell someone that the price of an entree is $212????  I've eaten at Masa's, Gary Danko, etc.  Those places are expensive.  And the food/service is awesome.  But even their entrees don't cost $212.  And our food was bo-ring.  I would have gotten more joy out of a Big Mack and Fries.

On a Tuesday night, the place was dead.   \n\nFirst off - don't ask the waiter for a recommendation.  It's normally my go-to action to decide between two plates, and that gets completely whacked when the only thing he will suggest is the most expensive stuff.   \n\nThis is one of those up-scale restaurants, so we got an amuse - in this case, it was a small bite of chive omelette, and was possibly the tastiest bite we had all night.\n\nWe followed that up with a pair of appetizers - one was a seared diver scallop (small - enough for one person only) and the other was the steak tartare, which had a lovely quail egg fried perfectly on the top.  Presentation, as you might expect, was top-notch here, and the tartare was delicious.\n\nI opted for the Hawaiian Ono for my main course.  It was seared rare, the sliced into small medallions and topped with lobster pieces among a citrus vinaigrette.  On the side was a small ring of tomato infused cauliflower (at least that is what it tasted like) topped with thinly shaved fennel.

Beautiful place, simple but classy. \nThis time after long day at work I wanted to treat myself. \nDidn't want to look awkward and eat by myself at a dinner table, sat at the bar. Thursday night, relatively empty bar. \n\nMy phone buttery died (no pictures) I asked bartender to charge my phone, he said that there is no charger, but he has a place to charge and it's an opportunity for me to make friends. Really? If I am eating alone, it means I am not in a mood for interaction, not lonely.\nMenu didn't look impressive, decided to order  Wagyu flap steak, bartender said it's going to take at least 30 minutes, and suggested to order appetizer.  I was very surprised and noted that steak shouldn't take that long, okay I will order fried squid with black garlic sauce. \nAfter 3, 5 minutes tops I got undercooked steak, seemed like someone canceled the order, it was incredibly fast. Half way to finishing my steak, I got fried squid. Are you kidding me?! \nMedium rare Wagyu flap steak with creamed corn truffle powder, eggplant beignet. $37 steak came out raw, cold, didn't like wine sauce, but creamed corn softened heavy sauce taste. Truffle powder wasn't \"trufflie\" at all.\nCrispy squid with black garlic sauce and fried lemon $11 squid was light and perfectly cooked, but the sauce was very strong and heavy for light squid, at least needed acidity and salt. \nOverall was very disappointed.\nNot going back.", "author": "Natasha S."}

If you like the savory/sweet combination and egg custard, this is the dish for you to try!  It's an ultra-smooth cauliflower soup prepared into a custard, lightly sprinkled with sugar, and then bruleed for that perfect crispy texture on top.  It also comes topped with sunchoke escabeche and truffled wild arugula.   Perfect.\n\nWe also had the seared ivory salmon that comes with a poached quail egg, smoked Potato, and a Nicoise olive vinaigrette.  Mmm...\n\nFor my entree, I had the seared scallops that were so sweet and tender and came with cauliflower puree, roasted matsutake mushrooms, and lobster cream.  Husband had the grilled lamb sirloin with baby carrots and an apple-spearmint demi-glace.  We were both very pleased with our dishes and had a little room for dessert.\n\nWe shared the praline mousse that was made into a light \"cookie\", and came with cinnamon ice cream.  If that wasn't enough, we went home with two spiced chocolate truffles.  \n\nOh and did I mention that we were also presented with an amuse bouche before the apps AND a dessert amuse bouche too?!  Cool.\n\nWe had a great meal and will definitely be back for more.  By the way, the decor is SO classy and I can't wait to return for some of their specialty cocktails.

The cauliflower brulee could've been a little on the warmer side but our server told us to mention to the chef the next time we have it again, that we would like it on the warmer side instead of it being so cold.

Twenty Five Lusk does exactly that.\n\nThe hype surrounding the opening was unbelievable. But this place lives up to it. And exceeds it. The design is nothing short of spectacular. From the moment you walk in, you can tell immediately that this isn't your typical square layout. The stairs lead you to the main dining level, with the kitchen exposed to the diners behind a wall of glass. There's a smaller bar area to the right and more stairs that lead to the expansive lower lounge level that sits just below street level. From the metal fireplace in the lounge area that drops down from the sky, to the perfect mix of modern glass, in harmony with the exposed brick and wooden beams, there are many things to like about this place.\n\nMy Tequila Sour (camarena tequila, lime, pineapple, cane syrup, egg white, bitters) from the upstairs bar was okay, probably the least impressive part of the night. It was creamy and looked nice, but overall a bit bland and unmemorable. Perhaps I picked the wrong cocktail to try. The food on the other hand, was really good. The prawns with risotto came with four ridiculously large prawns, grilled to perfection, and paired nicely with the bed of risotto. My only qualm is that the risotto could've use just a tad bit more cooking, but I'm splitting hairs here. The radish and beet salad was fresh and nice to look at, almost like a work of art.\n\nThe menu seems to be changing often and the space has tremendous potential.

Tucked away in an alley, this place will draw much walk-in traffic! They serve \"sophisticated, contemporary, approachable fine dining specializing in neoclassical-influenced cuisine\", which probably means locally inspired California cuisine.\n\nFamed Architect Cass Calder Smith designed the space to bridge modern and industrial elements.\n\nCuisine - French-inspired contemporary American\nChef - Matthew Dolan (Caf\u00e9 des Artistes, New York, Emeril's, New Orleans, Garibaldi's, San Francisco)\nLocation - Soma, South Beach, 2 Blocks from AT&T Park\n\nDecor, Vibe - Twenty Five Lusk is located in a historic 1917 building that once housed the Ogden Packing and Provision smokehouse and meat processing facility and features massive windows, exposed brick, slate tiles, smoked mirrors, mirrored incandescent bulbs, suspended fireplaces, tropical wood veneers, glassed in kitchen, and a chefs table. The bar is located in the basement and fills up with the local happy hour crowd. Upstairs it was mainly the forty-something well-dressed crowd along with some hipsters. Mayor Brown was hanging out downstairs.\n\nTwenty Five Lusk Menu is very limited with seven first course options and only eight entr\u00e9es. Vegetarians have an option or two.\n\nPicks:\nMojito ($7) was dark, balanced, and strong. Clearly they have some mixologists with experience.\n\nWarm Acme bread roll was soft and delicious.\n\nComplimentary amuse Bouche of creamy lobster with sprouts was a bit on the salty side but didn't possess some solid lobster flavor.\n\nCauliflower cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e ($12) sunchoke escabeche, truffled wild arugula is a play on a sweet savory dish like salted caramel ice cream. If you like these combinations go for this dish and its thin crusted cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with a light cauliflower flavor.\n\nLobster ravioli ($14) saffron lobster gauge, shaved Thai basil, seaweed had one big ravioli cooked al dente, full of real lobster swimming in a very good broth. Be sure to use the roles to sop all this up.\n\nGrilled quail ($14) Ginger carrot pur\u00e9e, caramelized onion, watercress, black pepper quail Demi Glace was recommended by our server and proved to be a great choice. The quail was juicy, cooked just right and not to boney.\n\nSeared diver scallops ($27) cauliflower pur\u00e9e, roasted lobster mushrooms, lobster cream had three huge, tender scallops with beautiful caramelized tops, brushed with a tangy lobster cream sauce.\n\nGrilled pork rib chop ($26) brussels sprouts, bacon, parsley root pur\u00e9e, dark thyme sauce was a standout dish of the evening. We haven't had a pork chop this good in a long while. The pinkish bone in pork was cooked perfectly and was extremely juicy. The bacon made eating the brussels sprouts, even for kids. Make sure you order this dish. \n\nVerbena steamed halibut ($27) see beans, tomato, eggplant, lemon-lobster vinaigrette was a healthy looking fish entr\u00e9e. This dish was also excellent. The big slice of top-notch fish was cooked perfectly and not overwhelmed by the light vinaigrette. Another must order dish.\n\nGrilled top lamb sirloin ($26) roasted garlic potato rosti, Apple-spearmint Demi Glace was a very needy dish with lamb pre-cut into chunks and cooked to a medium rare. The lamb was a little on the lukewarm side but was high-quality and not gamey. A solid dish for those that like lamb.\n\nComplimentary pre-dessert of honey trio with lemon cream. Refreshing but a bit creamy.\n\nDaily sampling of small desserts ($10) included spicy chocolate truffle cake with cr\u00e8me anglaise and raspberry sorbet, Dulce di Leche cheesecake with fig preserve, pecan toffee, and cider citrus sauce, and a bit of pineapple Savarin with bitter chocolate sauce, and passion fruit sorbet. This is clearly a great way to test out their desserts and possibly order more of your favorites. The cheesecake is a solid modern interpretation of classics, with no custard were crust. The decadent chocolate cake was clearly the best of the three.\n\nComplimentary pumpkin chocolate truffles were decadent and perfect for Halloween.\n\nOK:\nLime Posset ($10) kiwi mint salad, champagne granite had a very thin layer of extremely tart and sweet lime custard made with pectin.\n\nTwenty Five Lusk had very good service with a friendly waiter who had no problems accommodating us and ample water refills and swift request fulfillment. 25 Lusk is brand-new but clearly is run by seasoned professionals.\n\nTwenty Five Lusk certainly qualifies as a hotspot with its beautiful decor and beautiful people. We were presently surprised to find that the food quality was extremely high, capable of matching the cutting-edge decor.\nIf you're on a budget, the bar for cocktails and bar snacks like the Short rib Slider.\nExtensive and expensive wine list with 220 entries, glasses from eight dollars, bottles of wine from $25. Extensive cocktail list.\n18% service charge for parties six or more. 3.5% San Francisco health surcharge.", "author": "Ellen H."}

Since we were already at Lusk, we decided to eat there. One of the servers in the lounge area was rude to a couple of my friends. So my friend spoke to some one else and put her name down for a table of 8. At 9:00pm, she was told that it would be a 45 minute wait. We were not going to move the party elsewhere, so decided to wait thinking that at 9:45/9:50, we should be seated. There was too much confusion and chaos between the staff and as a result of that we were not seated until 10:30ish! \n\nI was famished! We were already upset with the way things were going at Lusk. Out of 8, two of us are vegetarians. Shannon told us of another vegetarian item that was off the menu and we both opted for that as we were not in mood for cheese crepes! \n\nHowever, they managed to mess up our order and brought out the cheese crepes. It was past 11, we decided to just eat what was served. unfortunately, the cheese tasted a bit too sour. I was told that it was fromage fresh.... but it didn't quite taste fresh! So we sent it back. Shannon was nice enough to bring a side of some grilled veggies. \n\nMy friends ordered fish and steak. They said their food was good.\n\nAnyway, the manager Chad felt bad about the chaos and lack of service and provided complimentary desserts and a round of Moscato D'Asti.

He seemed a little timid whenever he presented our food, and his voice wavered from time to time.   I wanted to give him a hug and tell him he was doing great and to not worry about serving us because we're just people.   I wanted to say, \"Look, it's just us!  We like to watch Sick Animation.

No one who knows me would ever dispute that.  I, however, am not one to love sweet dishes that are meant to be savory, so imagine my surprise when I found myself really enjoying the Cauliflower Creme Brulee.  It had a truly unique flavor that was both savory and mildly sweet, comforting yet sophisticated, and bold but subtle.  Perhaps I wasn't expecting it to be great, but it simply was.  My boyfriend, however, lives on chocolate, and I tell him that he's like a girl constantly on her period jonesing for the stuff.  I totally thought that he would dig the Cauliflower Creme Brulee but turns out that he liked it but not as much as the Rabbit Ravioli, which is what they had that night instead of the Lobster Ravioli.  Who knew that it would be opposite day.\n\nFor our main course, I had a really difficult time choosing since the menu looked sooo good.  I ultimately chose the Duck Confit because, as I had previously stated, I love salt and fat.  What can I say about it?  Thumbs up salt.  Thumbs up fat.  The duck skin was perfectly crisp, and I was a happy camper.  Boyfriend's steak was also really tasty and tender paired with a red wine sauce and potatoes.  From the barren plate that he left behind, I would venture to guess that he too enjoyed his dinner.\n\nThe other highlight for me was my drink: I believe it was called the SF Yacht Club.  It was light and delicious, and had it not been for the fact that I was catching an early flight the next day, I would've ended up becoming a member of the Twenty Five Lush club.\n\nSpeaking of which, this restaurant has an interesting bar scene on the first floor.  Now, when I say \"interesting,\" I mean Asian yuppies.  As an Asian myself living in the Bay Area, you'd think that I wouldn't be caught off guard, but truly, it was a high density of very well-dressed, fashionably coiffed young Asian men and women.  If I were younger and inclined to mingle, I could definitely see how this would be a great place to do so; there are nice chairs, fire places, and room to wander about.\n\nFinal analysis:  Great place to be single and mingle but REALLY great place to be attached and ok with your mildly overweight body.", "author": "Elaine L."}

This friend is super into food, and really loves excellent restaurants.  Even though 25L isn't in the upper echelon of restaurants in San Francisco, we had been there twice previously over the past two years and really enjoyed it each time.  The space is both cool and inviting, and we'd found the food to be delicious and interesting, and the service to be pretty good.\n\nOverall - We were disappointed in the service/food, embarrassed that we'd chosen this place for our friend from (ahem) New York, and will not return (for the dining room at least - we'll always go to the bar here).  \n\nSpecifics:\n - The server was the pushiest server I've had in recent memory in terms of nudging up our bill.  On a Wednesday night, she put the hard sell on us to get the $82 tasting menu with $45 wine pairings.  On a Wednesday?  Maybe she thought we were out on someone's expense account .... but we were not .... and that pricing is ridiculous for a place that's best known for its bar.  I found it humorous that she made a point of mentioning that the wine pairing worked out to two glasses of wine.  OK .... At $45, I could just order three really great wines by the glass off the list.  Am I missing something here?  Are they opening Latours for each course?  Unclear.  \n\n - I ordered the Diver Scallop as an appetizer, and another app - the Pork Belly Confit - as my main.  The server reminded us (she'd already mentioned it) that the serving were \"individually portioned\", and she \"strongly encouraged\" me that the app would not be enough for my main course and I should definitely order a main (which all range from $28 to $37 and up).  I'm a new mom trying to watch my weight, and knew the food would be rich enough that (right now, anyway) it would be more than enough.  By questioning my decision she drew attention to me and made me reiterate again what I wanted.  That's embarrassing to me as a diner and is unpleasant for the others at the table.  NOT COOL.\n\n - Our friend ordered the Grilled Swordfish and hated it.\n\nAll that said, the wine was fabulous.  My dishes were absolutely delicious - I would have the same meal again in a heartbeat.  And the guys split a dessert of the Salted Caramel Swirl Brownie and loved it.  But at these prices, we have many choices of restaurants in the Bay Area.  MANY CHOICES.

I felt like I was at a hip NY restaurant.\n\nI would give the drinks 6 stars and hats off to the mixologists. If you go there, you MUST try the dark and stormy. I can't remember the last time I had a mixed drink that good.\n\nI had the lobster ravioli which was, tasty, but not as good as I expected. That's where the 4.5 and not 5 stars comes from.\n\nHowever, the pork chop more than made up for it. OMG...it was so good I wanted another one even though there was clearly no room left in my stomach. The brussel sprouts and bacon just put me over the top!\n\nI too saw \"Big\" Willie Brown there so I'm thinking this may be one of his current haunts. That will not keep me from going back however. \n\nI would definitely recommend it even if you just go for drinks. If you want dinner, make a reservation.

That's not a knock...we like GSFFRs!  Went with another couple and enjoyed a long, indulgent dinner.\n\nHigh points:\n* In an alley which makes it - and by inference, us - seem cool and edgy.\n* Physical space is dramatic and very attractive - stark and modern but also open and welcoming.  Really liked it.\n* Service was smart and friendly (snooty, indifferent service is always a risk at GSFFRs)\n* Very interesting cocktail list.  I'm not usually a pre-meal cocktail guy but got curious.  Grapefruit Gimlet was kinda cool.\n* Long, interesting wine list covering a wide range of price points + excellent sommelier (great advice, fun chatter, decanted without us asking) \n* Generally delic food (we enjoyed the Gnocchi appetizer and Steelhead Trout entree especially)   \n    \nLow points: \n* Chocolate ravioli dessert was comically small.  We got it to share which wound up being sort of silly.\n\nAll in all, we liked it!  Check it out.", "author": "David K."}

I was a bit hesitant as I have been to 25 Lusk at night as a lounge and typically lounges don't do brunch right. We arrived and seated upstairs right away. They provided the Gilt City menu right away so we knew exactly what to order. We started with a yacht club and a bloody mary to drink. The yacht club was pretty but really didnt taste like anything which was fine for him but beware if you are expecting something that tastes like alcohol. I loved the bloody mary, very peppery and flavorful. \nFor entrees we had the Lobster benedict and the Ribeye and eggs. both were delish but I was partial to my lobster benedict.\nThey also provided some bread to start as well which were very yummy.\nTo end the meal they brought a mini coffee press and sugary donuts with chocolate dipping sauce. We were pretty full at this point but the coffee was welcomed after the meal and the donuts looked yummy. They were a bit doughey so I didnt love them, especially already being full. I would recommend working on that dough recipe to of make them a bit lighter and airy. \nOverall great ambiance for brunch, beautiful decor, attentive staff, and awesome food. Boyfriend usually isnt a big fan of brunch but he said he would come back here for something special. The prices without the deal seemed a bit high for brunch  but maybe if they could work out something were you get a drink and a meal and you get some mini discount it would entice more customers.", "author": "Nicole S."}

I tried the Dark and Stormy which came in a huge goblet and the Dancing Riviera (?)  which was on the sweeter side.  \n\n- They have a $12 valet parking in front so parking is taken care of.\n\n- The place closes around 1:30 AM.\n\nCons\n- The drinks are on the expensive side.

I felt a little under-dressed when I went in, but realized that it was a Brunch crowd and hopefully no one would judge me on my attire.  (They didn't). \n\nMy friend and I got two different dishes- she got the steak and eggs, and I got the Egg Sandwich.  Her steak was seasoned very well- and cooked well.  I highly recommend her dish, as I am a steak snob (from Texas, so I know beef).  \n\nThe Egg Sandwich is good, a little confusing at first on how to eat it, as the egg kind of runs out- so you're not sure how to eat it without getting messy.   It was good, but needed a little more seasoning to the egg and the bun seemed like it was a little burnt on one side.  \n\nWe also split the donuts, and they were good as well.   I can't say that any of the food here was bad.  It was overall a really good experience. \n\nI am looking forward to going back to try dinner or even a happy hour at the bar.", "author": "J B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-04-11", "description": "This review is intended for the lounge. In averaging my two experiences, I would have given it a 4.5 star my first time, and 1 star for this past Saturday night. \n\nThe interior is very industrial chic and spacious and elegant. I love their back seating areas. It is very comfortable and makes for good atmosphere. I would suggest arriving at an earlier hour if you want to enjoy the venue, because the hordes (very young) come through around the 10:30pm hour and it changes from a refined, trendy posh lounge, to a nightmarish crowded almost nightclub full of the amateur crowd (sans the dance floor).\n\nIn regards to the food, they use quality ingredients - truffle oil on their fries, great artisan cheeses, delicious lamb meatballs, the best pretzels ever, organic offerings for their vegetables, delectable sliders... the list goes on - however, they are on the pricey side. We came here in a bigger group, and everything is very good family-style. The only thing we were not a fan of was the yellowtail, as it was a bit on the fishy side.\n\nMy first experience here was a positive one, and was cause for return - probably because we sat at the bar, and had a very attentive mixologist who crafted amazing cocktails for us, and really gave us insight into the selection of ingredients she personally observed, and how the bar maintained their ingredient offerings. We had a large group, but no one was ever without a drink.\n\nLast Saturday however, (maybe due to the lateness of the hour, or possible staff training issues, or a server having a bad day) the service was AWFUL and I am sure we were overcharged. The server couldn't even name the cheeses that were offered on the cheese plate, nor did she seek further information. She just said \"I don't know.\" She rarely checked up on us - and we probably received more attention from the poor bartenders and bussers than her, which we flagged down ourselves. It was as if we did not have a server. And, when several gentlemen (who were NOT members of our party) invaded our area, and ordered their own beverages, somehow they ended up on our tab, and it was clearly her error.\n\nI am one to give anything several tries due to the aforementioned extenuating factors, but there were truly so many misses that it really tainted my perspective this go-around. I am really big on the customer experience, and although the food quality is top-notch, poor service really made for an upsetting experience.

The first thing that struck me was the decor: has a dark and modern feel which I can't help feel a bit contrived...just couldn't quite feel comfortable, but I'm also a sucker for rustic charm, so potayto-potahto. I can why others would like it on a classier date.\n\nThe food was decent but expensive. A little JV nouvelle cuisine-y to me without the substance: foams here, sublimated champagne there, terrific presentations, but I can't remember any dish being particularly memorable. \n\nThe service was excellent, but I thought it was a little weird when they insisted on using a ten-strong server crew to lay down our entrees at the same time like they'd do at a two-star Michelin joint.\n\nAll said, it's worth checking out, but not a place to proactively show the out-of-towners how much you love this city. I cannot speak to the bar which I do hear has superb drinks.", "author": "Jim L."}

The food situation in London isn't nearly as dire as many think it is, but it so doesn't compare to SF.

In addition to being right across the street from my SF abode (big plus!), I'm a fan of the ambience, the service (waiter was attentive without being overly so), and the extra little touches - a little amuse bouche of butternut squash soup to start off the meal, then a refreshing meyer lemon palate cleanser after the main course, and a lavendar dark chocolate candy amuse bouche after dessert!  \n\nAll in all, though, four stars from me!", "author": "Chi-Chi L."}

The decor was very San Francisco (exposed brick and wood beams) and the bar scene below the restaurant was loud and energetic.\n\nGoing out for dinner is not just about the food, it is also about the ambiance and the service.  The hostesses who greeted us were warm and friendly, the servers who refilled our complimentary sparkling water and brought bread to the table were extremely nice and attentive, and the man who brought us our dishes was also great.  \n\nThe only customer service blemish was our waiter.  Slim man with dirty blond curly hair and facial hair.  He was not overly warm to begin with, but when we said that we would not be having alcohol with our meal, he decided to write us off.  I was planning on having dessert, but after the tossed the dessert menus on the table without saying a word and walking off, I decided it was time to leave.  It was unnecessarily rude and inappropriate for him to conduct himself in that manner.  \n\nFortunately for me, the food was overly salty so I would not have wanted to return anyway.  I would have felt conflicted if I loved the food, but didn't want to deal with the poor service.  We still tipped 20% because we did not want the other servers to be penalized for the waiter's poor attitude.  If I could have tipped each person separately, I would have done so.\n\nI would not recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a good meal.  If you want to go somewhere for a scene or a lively evening out, this will suffice, however District is just a block away and has higher ceilings and better overall service.\n\nFood:  3 stars\nService:  1 star for our waiter, 5 stars for the supporting staff\nAmbiance: 4 stars for decor and energy", "author": "K D."}

Good luck not valeting when there's a ball game going on.  The atmosphere is nice and classy, very clean I might add which is a surprise for this city, service was very upscale; they cleared bread crumbs from the table between courses.  Only thing they missed was setting my napkin on my lap and folding it, which I can live without anyway.  \n\nOnto the food!  The bread was good for about 15 seconds after opening up the bun the steam escapes and it dries out with a quickness! Then it's like day old bread.  We had the wagyu ribeye for 2 which was pretty good.  I thought wagyu was above USDA prime, but this was not that impressive.  It was smothered in a thick deep red truffle sauce which was kind of salty.  I think it should have been on the side as an option so it wouldn't waste the natural taste of this $88 steak.  I think a $50 ribeye would have been just as good from prime cattle.\n\nThe martini here was like drinking isopropyl alcohol.  It gave me a fast strong buzz, but it burned my nostrils and throat doing down.  Not sure it was worth the $11.  The downstairs lounge and bar is packed at night, people are dressed like they just got out of college class on a Friday afternoon.

Both very good, although the duck egg w/the bone marrow was cold -- don't think that's intentional.\n\nFor entrees we had the skirt steak and the steelhead. Again, both were very good.

I'm not one for the swank NYC lounge scene, but I can still appreciate the thought and design that went into this place.  It is visually appealing.  Despite its industrial shell and futuristic elements, it didn't have a cold or sterile feel to it.  This is mostly due to the pod-like firepits encircled with stools that made the pre-dinner drinks with my party feel like a homey campfire chat.\n\nThe food and service, unfortunately, could not match the decor.  The food was solid, not great, especially for the prices.  The steak was a well-thought out dish with a flavorful sauce and foie gras butter, but the quality of the cut was not up to par with the rest of the dish as it lacked structure and had a rubbery, tasteless, outer shell to the medium rare interior.  The yellow tail app was tasty, but tiny.  The desserts were very good.\n\nThe service was the most lacking part of the meal.  Drinks orders took 20 minutes to arrive and then the waitress disappeared for another 15 minutes before coming back to take our order.  The dessert course also took about 15 minutes to arrive.

The service isn't the quickest but it gets busy and the bartenders make the drinks properly, not rushed. So waiting a bit longer is expected.  Its a lounge a hangout. It gets loud and crowded. The music is good, the bar food is excellent the drinks are spot on creative and fresh. It's also great for people watching both the sexy and the silly. \nWhen I want a chill relaxing meal I go upstairs. I have had both huge group parties in the private room and small intimate dinners with just 2 of us. I enjoy sitting at the bar upstairs for a meal for two. The bartenders know their shit. I like being in the action.\nThe tables are a but close together in the dining area but I have never had a problem with anyone next to me. If anything it's fun to listen to them and make fun.

This is not a \"cheap date\" kinda place, and since its Cougar bar, what do you expect?  I guess when I turn 50, I can really appreciate a joint like this. Happy (cougar) hunting!", "author": "M P."}

This review is for the restaurant, although I've visited the lounge a couple of times. \n\nI have mixed feelings about this place. It's nice and the food is pretty good, but the experience just wasn't pleasant for me.\n \nFood: The portions (for the price) are terrible.  Three pieces of sashimi for $15? The cauliflower brulee is popular but was yukky to me. The bone marrow was overcooked. The roast pork I had was good - cooked well, seasoned nicely, but I could have eaten two entrees (easily).  We ordered sides of brussel sprouts that never arrived. We asked the server three times, and we had all finished our plates before they even brought them to the table (again, the portions were small).  \n\nService was okay - the server was frazzled. To his defense, I think we were a tough crowd.\n\nThe overall look and feel of the restaurant is nice - it's that hip, restored,  industrial feel . Everyone is dressed up and the lounge was quite popular.\n\nBe prepared to spend $50+ per person without drinks.", "author": "Cindy Y."}

We shared a few dishes like the pretzels, sweet potato fries, crab roll, and bone marrow.  The bone marrow and (2) crab roll were skimpy - so a little disappointing.

The noise level is low to moderate, making conversation very easy.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at just how splendid and inventive the food and the menu is!\n\nWe started with the Pork belly and the smoked Duck appetizers; both were excellent, but the Pork belly was sublime; so tender, so much flavor, succulent, REALLY quite amazing.\n\nMy Wife had the Lobster fettucine and I had the Wild Boar; again, both excellent, but the Wild Boar was astounding; lean and slightly rare, yet full of flavor; the skin was cripy, buttery and delicious, just oozing taste.  The truffle risotto was dense with aromas and flavor.  We also had the Cauliflower brulee and it wasn't what I was expecting, but turned out even better than I had hoped.  The green beans with poached egg and lemon were also fabulous.\n\nThe lobster was sweet, tender and moist; the pairing with the fettucine was just spot-on.\n\nDessert was just as wonderful; the caramel brownies were moist and warm; the home-made chocolate chip mint ice cream was subtle and the pairing just flat-out worked.  I had the banana rum mousse; again very good, but the ginger ice cream was the star; tart and sweet with a bit of zing from the ginger.\n\nTheir cocktails were brilliant! I had a dark and stormy with home made ginger ale... hit the spot.\n\nOverall, what I found so eye-opening was the combination of opposing flavors that seemed magically paired!

The service was superb; we were greeted immediately by smiling, friendly servers and host. The upstairs restaurant space is beautiful - raw exposed beams with sleek tables and modern features. Two lovely glasses of wine came quickly and upon good recommendation from our server. We started with a super duper yummy, perfectly grilled and seasoned octopus. It was served with sesame fava beans, which were a great complement to the tasty tentacles. I went with the creole fried chicken for my main - DANG IT WAS GOOD! The sous chef is from New Orleans and they knew what they were doing when they made the thick, dark, creole sauce covering the chicken, blue new potatoes, sausage and greens, which included cucumber - a tasty surprise! It was a huge portion, so I gladly shared with my friend who chose the burrata with TEMPORA BACON for her main. That bacon was crazy good!

Like always, there is something on there that I prefer not to eat so I asked the waiter if I could substitute the steak for something else. Besides the dining room at the Ritz, most other places either give you an attitude or short change you with the substitution or both. For example, on my last trip to Quince I asked them to substitute the foie gras and they ended up giving me 2 cheese raviolis instead and slapping me with a $20 substitution fee...not kidding. Another example if jardiniere where they substituted the rabbit for plain meatless pasta and the waitress had a ton of attitude about it. Anyway, back to the story, so our waiter said he would go ask the chef and when he came back he told me to pick whatever I wanted from the menu. I picked one of their fish entrees and not only did they not hassle me about the substitution and gave me options but they actually gave me a full size entree. Wow! Was I impressed! Now that is what I call customer service. \n\nOn the downside though I did feel a bit neglected by our server. A lot of things took forever....maybe he was super busy?

They have some unusual flavor combinations and exotic dishes.  It sounds great on paper, but not so much when eating.\n\nService:  First experience was...awkward.

Everything was well timed and all staff were very attentive.\n\nBar/lounge:  Very specious (oddly even more so than the dining area), but it can get pretty crowded on Friday and Saturday nights.  The drink menu is decent, although a bit on the pricier side--but consistent with what you would expect from this kind of place.\n\nDecor: Very modern and cool--reminiscent of NYC's Meatpacking District.

When we checked in, we mentioned this and were pretty much seated right away...here are the 2-star deserving details. 1. You'd think as a sales person trying to close a deal, the coordinator would have stopped by the table to introduce herself (we had only spoken on the phone by that point) and see how were liking it and offer a tour and some info about the food options. 2. The food took forever. I mean forever. We eat out often and many times at swanky places, we appreciate that good food takes time. This was not the case here. I believe it was over an hour before we saw our food. To add to the disappointment, on two occasions (once waitress, once from manager?) We were given bull excuses such as \"we held the food because 50% of your party wasn't at the table.\" - you're right for about 5 minutes of the hour wait for food, my fiances folks used the restroom; what about the other 45 minutes? Then the managers, \"oh you know, we like for you to relax and enjoy and have fun with your family.\" - yes thank you, that's why we were here in the first place, but that's hard to do when you're stomach is growling and the quickest service comes from the bar. 3.

Pork chops and a hangar steak. \n\nI wouldn't say this is a great place for a date because all the conversations happening bring the volume up and no meaningful words can be exchanged.

We started with cocktails in the downstairs lounge which is again, quite the looker,  love the fireplaces.  Service could have been faster, but when they came, the drinks weren't bad at all.  Ordered a girly drink for a change, the Grapefruit Gimlet and it was just right, refreshing.  \n\nBack upstairs at dinner, things soured a bit.  The food is really just ok, especially for the prices.   We started with the mushroom agnolotti and the spring green salad with beets to share.  The agnolotti wasn't bad, not amazing, but passable.  The salad vinagrette was very, very salty, yikes!  Second course, my friend and I split the chicken fried quail and a side of cauliflower creme brulee.  The first bite of each was eye brow raising, like, hmm, this is pretty interesting, I think I like it!  The next bite made you realize that there was too much going on and while it wasn't really bad, it wasn't really good either.  I think the quail was supposed to be a high-brow take on the 'ol fried chicken and waffles, or at least that was what it tasted like.  The mushroom pancakes under the quails were pretty sweet and a little mapley tasting.  The creme brulee was a neat idea, but the sweet/savory combo, which I usually rather like, skewed toward the sweet side, so the flavor contrast didn't really take off.  Most of the dishes were like this, what seemed like good ideas that weren't too successfully executed.\n\nThe service, was, well, uncomfortable.  Very, VERY attentive, too much so in fact.  There was some member of the serving staff at our table on average every 10 minutes of our two hour meal, and not just to pass by and perhaps make sure we didn't need anything, but rather intrusive.  Now, I feel like a jerk saying that, I mean how could attentive service be bad, right?  Well it can when everytime someone at the table starts to say something or tell a story, the waiter is leaning in to tidy the table - not even really clearing things away, but almost making excuses to serve.  And the bread dude - I appreciate a serving of bread, but man, we really don't need to be served bread from your bottomless basket of baked goods three times in one meal.  I don't know about this hand-serving of bread, maybe someone can enlighten me as to it's necessity? \n\nI'd be willing to give  Twenty Five Lusk another try, it really is a lovely space, but I'd probably just sample a couple of the bar snacks downstairs with one of those zingy gimlets.

We had a great dining experience and everything we ordered was delicious. I would definitely return here again. I love that they give complimentary food and dessert. I think it's a great place to take someone out on a date.\n\nNote: They didn't carry Patron or Hennessy at the bar so don't expect those drinks there.", "author": "LM D."}

They still needed to work out some kinks in the kitchen before becoming a well-oiled machine.  \n\nThe space has an exposed brick-and timber interior typical of the stylish conversion lofts in Soma.  After waiting almost an hour at the bar, we finally got seated.  The menu is inventive and interesting, except we had to wait another vexing hour before tasting any of it!  The manager however, offered us more wine & dessert as douceur so that kept us docile for awhile.  When we finally got the food, it...was...deelicious.  Was it worth the wait? No.  There are plenty of great restaurants in SF, that they need to step it up, not to lose their clientele.\n\nWent to the lounge downstairs another time.  It's a cool, lively place to get drinks after work with friends, except they have a poor bar menu.  For decent conversation and good food, I recommend reservations at the dining room.", "author": "Gertrude V."}

I lost track of all the things I tried, but of course as everyone else has already said, the cauliflower creme brulee was delicious.  I ordered the risotto, but to me it seemed a bit too salty.

When we first saw this place, which is right behind where we live, I thought it might be some sort of seedy club. Then I found it on Yelp and started learning more about it, then I couldn't try it fast enough. \n\nWe were able to get reservations last minute on a Saturday. When the dinner began, we got exceptional service. I was ready for that level to drop a little as the place filled up, but it never did. Now for the food;\nProsciutto and basil soup - excellent, just a little tang from the lemon oil drizzled on top. The prosciutto by adding it to the stock, so lots of flavor but no chunks. \nSweet corn ravioli - just as good as all the other Yelpers say it is. \nPekin Duck - great seasoning and very moist meat\nSquab - the only dish that somewhat disappointed. It came with great presentation. The squab was deconstructed with the small pieces sort of in the shape of the bird. As great as this looked, it made the pieces lose their heat too quickly and also pieces that small with bones are just a pain. Tasted great, but the presentation got in the way of the enjoyment. \nChocolate Fondant cake -  dense and smooth texture, very chocolaty. Real and fresh cherry sauce, great tart sorbet to finish\nGoat cheese and Mango composition - I'm a sucker for goat cheese, and this didn't let me down. It came with olive oil ice cream that was a little too dense. \n\nAs this is within spitting distance of our front door, I plan to become a regular here (if I can afford it!).", "author": "Scott C."}

Exposed brick, huge wooden beams, white table clothes, fresh flowers. dimly lit, quiet background music...really can't ask for a better vibe. Classy and trendy all at the same time, which is hard to pull off. The waiter, James, was uber helpful in his suggestions, recommendations and all around service. He was on top of his game. We started with a bottle of champagne, which they chilled on ice for us before serving.We had a few starters, YUKON GOLD GNOCCHI with cipollini onions, foraged mushrooms, wild arugula butter and SEARED MANGALITSA PORK SHOULDER with truffled cannellini bean ragout, basil. Both were incredible. The bread and butter too (as simple as it sounds) was unusually tasty). As a main course, I had the BRAISED PORK SHANK which was served with artichoke risotto, and preserved lemon. It was divine. Braised pork shank the way it should be. Incredible.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-09-03", "description": "If I were to own a restaurant, it would be something like Twenty Five Lusk.  Situated in an alley way near AT&T Park (bonus, after or before game meals) 25 Lusk is a cool, hip, chic restaurant, something you find in the LA and Vegas scene.  Upon entering you have a choice of going upstairs to the main dining room which has an intimate feel with dim lighting, wooden tables and a view of the beautiful kitchen or going downstairs to the bar scene.  The main dining room offers a comfortable setting and as I mentioned a view of the glassed covered kitchen area.  When you look into the kitchen it feels a bit like looking into a laboratory where they are studying how to do things similar to Ferran Adria (of course this is not molecular gastronomy).  An added bonus, there was a whole suckling pig on display as a special by the window which not only had diners interested but their own staff as well.  It's not every day you see that in a non Chinese restaurant.\n\nWe had the BBE Strawberries and Champagne menu where they created six courses with the use of Strawberry and Champagne.  Yes it's a bit like Iron Chef isn't it?  \n\nFirst course: oysters with strawberry sauce and caviar.  I'm not usually an oyster fan but the sweet strawberry sauce offset the flavor of the oyster and caviar.  Very delicious.\n\nSecond course: scallop and foie gras torchon.  I'm a suck for foie gras if you've read my previous posts and this was done perfectly, I even had some left over for some bread.  The strawberry sauce with a bit of sweetness mixed with the warm scallop and cold foie gras worked out really well.  An excellent dish.\n\nThird course: duck breast with veggies.  A bit rare for me but that's how duck is supposed to be.  I didn't taste much strawberry in the sauce (not sure if there was supposed to be any) but if I was judging this as an Iron Chef judge, I would say \"duck was very well made, cooked perfectly with the veggies as a good complement.  However I'm not sure I get enough or any strawberry flavoring here and strawberries should really be the main flavor and in this dish it lacks it.\"  \n\nFourth course: filet mignon.  Excellent, tender piece of meat.  Very well made but the strawberry demi glace didn't compliment the meat too well.  However still a delicious piece of meat and dish.\n\nFifth course: cheese, dehydrated strawberry and crouton (?)  Reason I put a question mark next to it is because they said it is crouton but it was really a piece of dehydrated wonder bread.  I'm not a big cheese fan and the bread didn't help it at all.  This was a disappointment.\n\nSix course: strawberry mousse with chocolate sorbet.  Terrific dessert.  There was a champagne sauce on the plate that I didn't see till my gf pointed it out to me and when eaten together, man it is good.\n\nWe had a couple of cocktails where were both rather good.  Service was decent, bussers and managers were attentive, waiter was good but thought was a bit too casual for the restaurant.  He even knew the restaurant was low on mint so at least he was knowledgeable.  However, how can they be low on mint on Saturday night on a long weekend?

They clearly attempt for a higher brow dining experience... but when the first course plates came out... we had one of the most awesome dirty plates I have ever seen... it had a dried, caked on formerly leafy green semi-glued to the white plate.  It was clearly noticeable... in fact, our table of 5 all saw it as it went down on the table... add to this moment that when I asked for a different plate... the server seemed almost annoyed and responded as if I was asking for a new plate for no real reason... let's just chalk that interaction up to not being attentive and paying attention...\n\nSee and that's where it goes one step further towards bad... if you are presenting yourself as an upscale restaurant... well things need to be impeccable... and 25 Lusk was anything but.\n\nGo elsewhere.

It was only 4 weeks old when we made a reservation a few days later.\n\nFirst off the space is amazing. I read somewhere it took about a year for it to open. They did an awesome job with the beams and exposed brick. There appears to be a semi-private dining area as well. The night I was there it appeared it wasn't being used for a private party but rather as regular table seating. But enough of that what about the food right.\n\nI started with the Pork Cheeks which were very good. The wife started with the Wild Arugula salad and was very satisfied as the dressing was tasty and not too saturated.\n\nFor the main I had the Yellowtail. There was nothing special about this one. The fish was cooked very well but nothing that grabbed me in the dish. The wife had the scallops which were very good though. She's been very big on scallops and these were at the top of her list.\n\nWe finished off by sharing the Spicy Truffle Cake. We were told the spicy is due to putting a bit of chipotle in there. We didn't taste any spice but it was very good.\n\nThe waitress was good until the end. We were looking to close out our bill and she was either on her break or completely forgot about us. We were waitress-less for about 15-20 min after finishing our dessert. We didn't even see her working other tables during this time.\n\nWe'll be going back again to try other dishes and try out the bar scene which was busy.

Not great...but good.   onto the entree... we ordered the New York steak with grilled Foie Gras on top  and a Pork Chop... both my wife and I would gladly pass on these two dishes.  The steak was dry and bland (my wife ordered medium rare).  My Pork chop on the other hand was all fat and barely have any meat on it. I'm no chef but I can cook at meaner pork chop than this.

The grilled octopus appetizer was also really tasty - a great blend of ingredients. For mains - I tried the grilled ahi tuna - and it is among the best grilled ahi I have had. My husband had the grass fed lamb sirloin, and he said it was excellent. While we were clearly satisfied and sated after this great dinner, we opted for dessert anyway.

You enter onto a mezzanine between the main dining room and the subterranean lounge.  It's totally different but in a way that makes you think \"cool.\"  \n\nWhile the lounge appeared to have a good, happy hour energy, my friend and i had a reservation for the dining room.  i was kind of uneasy about this at first.  I checked out both menus beforehand, and the bar menu had so much good stuff on it that i just had to try some of it.  And at some places, they are uptight about mingling bar food with \"real\" (more expensive) food.  Anyway, I asked the server if we could order from the bar menu as well . He kind of hesitated at first and said no, but a few minutes later, he came back and said it would be no problem.  Good thing too.   We ordered the house made pretzels with gruyere sauce and prawn corn dogs.  Both were delectable.  I never had a prawn corn dog before.  It was pretty much just a battered, deep fried prawn on a stick, but call it what you want, it was amazing and came with a great mustard aioli.  The pretzels were amazing.  Bite sized, fluffy, with just enough salt.  And the gruyere sauce they came with was, to be trite, amazing.  \n\nMy friend and I split an entree: chicken fried quail with mushroom pancakes.  YOu don't know what a chicken fried quail is?  you don't need to know what it is.  I found this dish generally delicious... really liked the wild mushroom pancakes.  Think latkes but with mushrooms.  They were sort of sweet and savory at the same time.  The dish was actually of a decent portion size.  My only complaint is that the kumquat sauce was a little too sweet.... I just avoided eating it -- it was more or less on the bottom of the dish rather than smothering the food.  \n\nThen for dessert, I really wanted some cheese.  It appeared that the smallest serving they had consisted of three cheeses.  I was only in the mood for one.  So I asked the server if we could just get one cheese.  He said they could probably do that and he would ask the chef.  So he comes back out with a beautiful triple cream (my favorite type of cheese) and tells us it's on the house.  What?  I don't remember doing anything to deserve cheese on the house, but thank you.  The cheese was absolutely incredible.  \n\nThis place just about has it all.  Wonderful food, chic but comfortable ambience, stellar service.  The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars is because of the kumquat sauce, and their \"SF Yacht Club\" cocktail was pretty blah.

The interior is sleek, industrial and perfectly lit (light enough to see but low enough to make everyone look good).  There are plenty of spaces to create your own little alcove, as well as to mingle with others and enjoy some communal libations.  I had two different classic cocktails and both were well made with an added little twist that made them charming.  Lounge service was ok.\n\nThe restaurant on the other hand was a mess.  We were seated and presented with menus, and then left alone for about 10 minutes.  No one came to take a drink order or offer water.  When our waiter finally showed up and introduced himself he seemed charming and nice.  He took our cocktail orders and disappeared for another 10 minutes.  This is when things started going downhill.  When he came back to deliver the drinks he once again disappeared (now 20 minutes with closed menus on the table).  Server with bread arrived and drops a roll on each plate without conversation (menus still on the table).  The waiter appears again and wants our wine order.  A little odd considering we hadn't yet ordered food, but ok...after some discussion a wine is chosen.  Then he walks off....again (menus still on table, approaching 30 mins).  We are barely halfway thru our cocktails when he returns with the wine and starts serving it...while menus are still on the table!  It was totally bizarre.  After pouring the wine he at last takes our food orders.  When the food arrived it was beautifully presented, but unfortunately the beauty was only skin deep.  Each of the four of us had a different dish and every person commented that their dish was salty.  Other reviewers have commented about the salty issue so apparently they don't read their own reviews because the problem persists.  My crepe was so salty that it was borderline inedible.  I picked around and ate what I could but finally gave up.  By this point I wasn't even hungry anymore so didn't bother to send it back for something else (in retrospect I probably should have...).  Our waiter never came by to check on things and we only saw him once more to take our dessert orders.

The dining room was quieter and the perfect setting for a romantic dinner.  Our waiter (who looked like a thinner Adam Richman lol) gave superb recommendations for drinks and food.  I still crave the \"Big Trouble in Little Mexico\" cocktail which had tequila, thai basil syrup, habanero preserve, lemon; a perfect balance of flavors and sweetness, with a heat that slowly develops in your mouth after each sip.  We opted for the tasting menu, where each course was better than the preceding!  Everything was interesting, unique, and expertly prepared.  While quite expensive, I would recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for a special way to enjoy a special occasion.", "author": "Travis N."}

I noticed they even have a private room that seats about 24, fully equipped with a projector.  Nice for business meetings.\n\nFood was ok - I had the scallop to start; and it was just one scallop to start.  Followed by the Dorade which was served whole.  It was much larger than the waitress described, but was disappointing in the taste.  I've always enjoyed having a whole fish versus filet, but other restaurants always remove the fish innards.  I guess the chef here wanted us to taste the full wholeness of the fish.  It unfortunately detracted from the initial \"wow\" of the presentation and the flavor of the dish.\n\nWe had their trio of sorbet for dessert - unimaginative with blackberry, raspberry and mint chocolate.\n\nService was poor.  Our waitress kept us waiting 20-30 minutes between service, especially after we finished our main courses.  The sommelier was semi-attentive; after selling us our bottle of wine, our glasses were left thirsty too many times.", "author": "Liz T."}

I have never seen a bar charge separately for mixers in a well drink, especially when the drink is $12 to begin. And because it's a restaurant, we were taxed like a sit down dinner.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-11-25", "description": "My husband Franck & I went here for dinner last night and had *THE* single best dining experience we have had in ages! When we first walked in, we did a loop to check out the *stunning* 10,000 square foot space. We were in awe of the aesthetics ...and the atmosphere & vibe are awesome. The interior design was thoughtful & the original brick & timber components of the space (coupled with the modern finishes, decor & furnishings) are super sexy & so San Francisco. \n\nI am proud to say that we *FINALLY* have found a place within walking distance of our condo that is delicious, fun & just makes you feel good to be in and to walk out of. It felt like something you might find in New York or LA. Yet the vibe had a more friendly San Francisco tone. Although the reviews below say that the restaurant is \"dressy\", I would argue that it is \"dressy\" in it's own San Francisco way. Given the location on Lusk (off Townsend between 3rd/4th), I think it will attract locals & will be a place that is mostly discovered by word of mouth. \n\nThe owners, Chad & Matthew, are super smart with their approach. They are shaking hands with people & taking good care of their customers. If you go in, be sure to meet Chad! He is so friendly & personable. It is apparent that a whole lot of thought, love & TLC went into this project of starting 25 Lusk with Matthew. I just read an article saying that it took them 10 years to get this going. I am not surprised--it is obvious that each & every little detail of this place was well thought out. Because we were able to meet the owners & hear their story, we now wholeheartedly appreciate this brain child of theirs...and we plan to return as regular customers for our weekly date night. Rumor has it that they will also be opening for Sunday brunches soon. This will be a GREAT addition to the neighborhood. I can also see this place being fantastic for brunch before a Sunday Giants day game and also great for drinks/apps or an early dinner before a 7pm game. For you business people like me out there--take your clients here to celebrate or to show them a good time.... it will make them feel special! Men - take your lady here--it will make her feel sexy & will make her look at you as being even sexier! ;-) \n\nWe ordered the sunchoke bisque, baby green salad with persimmons, the char (fish that is a combo of trout & salmon), and the pork ribs. We also got a few generous tastes of the quail & a palette cleansing dessert bite that was to die for. For dessert my hubby ordered the truffle chocolate cake & I had the dessert sampler. Super yum! The dulce de leche cheese cake was delicious & the lime posset with kiwi-mint salad was incredibly tasty and refreshing--they were all good, but those were my faves. \n\nOur server Heather is clearly enjoying what she is up to--she was personable, fun & the way she explained the food painted a nice picture of what to expect & totally made my mouth water. She used to be our server at Fog City Diner & it is fun to see her now working in a more upscale culinary delight. She made great wine recs & she was totally on top of it with water refills, excellent customer service, etc. It was apparent to me that the owners Chad & Matthew chose people to work at their restaurant who care about creating a positive dining experience for their clientele. \n\nSo, that all said, go in to 25 Lusk. Introduce yourself to Chad the co-owner who is acting as GM. And also meet Matthew the co-owner/head chef. . It is worth every single penny. We are extremely impressed & look forward to telling all of our friends, colleagues and clients about it. \n\nBon appetite! :o)", "author": "Sara W."}

Maybe it's all about see and be seen, which I was not in the mood for at the time.\n\nSome of the dishes that came out were a home run, most notably the cauliflower creme brulee appetizer (to share) and the petite dulce de leche cheesecake with fig puree and chocolate-and-pecan crumble.  But those were two out of the six that the four of us ordered, which is not a very impressive hit rate to say the least.

We were a little late for the reservation (made the mistake of booking in SoMa during the Pride Parade!) but got seated right away. Our server was able to get the bar to make a specialty cocktail we had seen online - the Mimosa Borealis, with alembic brandy & elderflower - but it slowed the drink delivery time substantially. The Bloody Marys were good but I like a little more heat in mine. Thankfully there was prosciutto salt on the rim (!), a salty hunk of a cheddar-like cheese speared with a pickled radish, and a briny little caperberry to bring some flavor.\nWe then received a little smoothie \"amuse\" which was described as a banana-key lime smoothie - verdict: unremarkable. Then came an incredible (complimentary!) platter of baked goods: a couple cheddar-chive shortbread triangles, a mini huckleberry muffin, and some cinnamon-coffee cake. The muffin was small but studded with fresh huckleberries, and the coffee cake was remarkably moist. We probably could have lived off several more of those platters, but had also ordered the coffee & doughnuts starter. Inexplicably, this comes served with a Lagunitas Pale Ale. I would have really loved to see an oatmeal or chocolate stout as the pairing here! The doughnuts were amazing though - crisp outside and super fluffy inside. Kudos to the pastry chef - can you come live in my house? I noticed only later that you can order just a side of the doughnuts, no ale necessary - damn.\nFor entrees, we ordered the asparagus scramble and the Dungeness crab frittata. I tasted the scramble, which was good - melty Brie was all over the top, the asparagus I got was crisp-tender, and there was an artful shmear of avocado mousse on the plate. He also got a side of applewood-smoked bacon which was deliciously crispy and smoky. I didn't try the frittata, but my friend said she couldn't really taste any crab and that they should have called it an olive frittata - boo. I was super bummed that no one wanted the steak & eggs (then again I can make that at home) so fortunately we ended up with two lobster Benedicts :-) This was my absolute favorite breakfast dish I've had this year, possibly ever. They even complied with my request for fried eggs over hard rather than poached - the eggs were perfectly cooked and just slightly runny in the middle. They were perched on a toasted English muffin and drizzled with Hollandaise sauce. We've all read Bourdain's brunch confessions but this Hollandaise was really light, almost frothy and the most beautiful butter-yellow color - I swabbed up every last bit of it. Tender chunks of lobster meat were scattered throughout, and crispy prosciutto chips were the crowning glory. God, what a great dish. I would award it ten stars if I could. \nI wandered into the downstairs lounge area afterwards and I really want to come here for drinks. Everything just looks so sleek & swanky - retro-looking fireplaces, darkened \"make-out\" rooms, etc - super cool. It is definitely on the spendier side, especially for brunch (had we not had our vouchers, the bill would have been almost 150 bucks) but 25 Lusk is a nice treat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-28", "description": "Yes! Time to unbookmark! I've been here a couple of times for their weekend lounge affair.. The lounge is only downstairs, but you have to go upstairs to the main dining area to walk back down, though you can see the downstairs when you walk in.. uh.. that sounded all sorts of confusing.. but you will be marveled when you check it out..  Anyhow, while waiting in line to get in for the lounge, we got the chance to look at the menu posted outside! OOH!! Duck Confit! my fave? I had to make a point to come back for dinner.\n\nFinally had the chance to come back last night to celebrate a friend's day of birth. We were seated in the semi-private room. semi being the room entrances had no doors so you were in your space but reminded you are in a restaurant with the view to the rest of the folks. Which is ok for me. \n\nThe menu wasn't extensive, but who needs that? You really only need a few dishes to concentrate on to make it great. I think they change their menu occasionally because a couple of the dishes we had are not listed on their online menu.\n\nSo they started us off with bite-sized mushroom cheesecake (that's what they called it).. mmmm!! Buttery crust, mushroomy top! I wish the only served a bigger piece!\n\nAppetizers: \nOur side of the table started with the Smoked Trout served with toasted baguettes. If you like smoked salmon, you'll love this. something about smoked fish that you can't get the taste anywhere else.. mm... smoky fish goodness. I believe this was $13\nWe also had the foie gras. I'm not a big fan of liver/guts or anything of that nature.. it makes me gag just thinking of it.. but everyone else who had it were MMMM-ing a lot so i'm guessing it was good. This was about $16 (O_O) for a small cube.\nThe Steamboat Oysters were topped with caviar.. again, not a big fan of seafood, but everyone around me were saying how sweet it tasted. They're not fat adult oysters, which from the couple of times i've conjured up the nerves to have raw oysters, the smaller it is the sweeter and tastier..  this was $13 for about 6 pieces?\n\nMain Course:\nI thought I would for sure order the Duck Confit, but after reevaluating the menu, I was lured away by the Roasted Porchetta..mmm pork loin? with cheese? I am all up on that mutha. I am soooooo glad I went this route.. My buddha this dish was spectacular! A big hunk of pork marinated and roasted, with a slice of Aged Provolone melted on top. The pork had a layer of fat.. and that just enhanced the awesomeness. I gave a piece to pretty much everyone around me and still had more than enough to fill my stomach to spill over my jeans. And yumm!! Asparagus!! Stinky pee to ensue, but for those few moments, they were excellently grilled.. $25 for a fat slab of pork! It's well worth it..\nZe bf had the duck confit.. I think after having my porchetta, nothing else measured up.. he liked the duck confit, but went back for 4ths for my loin.. *wink wink*... and compared to the porchetta, the duck confit just could not compare in size. but it's just unfair to compare everything to that now... my friend to my left had the quail. i didn't get to try it, but being Chinese, we get quails quite often in any celebratory dinner banquets we attend. But he liked it... he cleaned the bones dry. i don't know what everyone else got, because i was pretty damn zoned in on my dish, but i think everyone enjoyed their food as when i finally came up for air, their plates were empty. Always a good sign.\n\nTo clean our palate, we were presented with a spoon of \"eggless custard\".. it tasted like a lemony panna cotta... OMG!! Another one which i wished they just made a bigger portion of and had on the menu! mm...\n\nDessert:\nWe ordered 2 Dulce de Leche cheesecake with i think pomegranate sorbet.. The cheesecakes were about a 2 in. oval shaped piece.. small, but so dreamy... only 2 pieces because we had more dessert coming our way..\nBecause cake fee is $5 per person, the organizer of the dinner opted to have cake from them instead since it was more cost effective. Which is pretty awesome, because i don't know of many restaurants that have actual birthday cakes in hand. Although it wasn't any cake to completely rave about, i think overall the birthday girl had a wonderful time. \n\nService:\nOur server (and staff) never hovered, but checked up on us enough that we never felt neglected or had an empty water/cocktail glass. So yay them! \n\nWith everything we ordered, including cocktails/wine, tax, sf health fee (stupid), gratuity, it was $73 per person.. not too shabby! everyone walked away full and happy!\n\nLoves this place all around! I hope to come back soon for another special occasion!", "author": "My C."}

Just some of what was at the table.  \n\n*Started in the cocktail lounge area downstairs\n*Cocktail server - A little stuck up.  Don't think she liked the asking for water request.\n* Manhattan on the Rocks with Bulleit Rye - This was pretty solid.\n* Hostess was nice.\n* Server...not terrible or anything, but didn't want to be there that night, from what I could tell.\n* Steak Tartare - fried quail egg, grilled radicchio, dijon, cornichon, grilled baguette  -  Nothing memorable.\n* Raw Tuna - ginger, cucumber, mushroom escabeche, soy lime vinaigrette, rice cracker - This was delicious. But again nothing out of this world.\n* Artichoke Risotto - fromage blanc, grilled asparagus, lemon, white truffle oil - I've had way better risotto.\n* New York Strip - morel mushroom flan, potatoes, braised oxtail, port reduction - Biggest downfall. Was more rare than the requested medium rare.  Overall, absolutely nothing memorable flavor wise.  Big disappointment.  Especially since it was one of the recommended dishes. \n* Manager - Walked up to ask how everything was and interrupted our convo mid sentence.  My advice is, don't be a clueless manager, just to put a check mark on your list that you checked in with every table.  It's pointless.\n* Dessert Wine - Saracco Moscato D'Asti 2010 Piedmont Italy - This was delicious.  So some more point back for a solid recommendation.\n* French press coffee - This was delicious as well.  So a few more points on the chart. \n\nSo does this deserve two stars?  Maybe two and half.

We started with some interesting cocktails. Mine was a gin with smoked olives and sea salt that kept me sipping it as new flavors came up. We started with the Parmesan fries and some pretty decent bread. After spending 2 weeks back home in Spain, good fresh bread is something I miss in the US, but this came close enough. Then we jumped straight to our entrees. The wifey had some bass with creamy sauce that was pretty yummy at first, then way too salty to eat without concerns for our coronary health. On the other hand, my duck breast was amazing. Crusty outside, tender inside and so tasty. Probably a bit undercooked for my taste but since it was relatively dark I could concentrate on the flavor and texture. The downside was the confitted leg, which was dry and a bit dull.\n\nIt all came down to about $50 per head plus tip, which is the reason for the 3 stars (small mistakes are more noticeable at those prices).

Loved the gin margarita.\n\nMy duck entree is best described as a tasty salt bomb. I'm not going to say it wasn't tasty, but it was almost a cliche in its preparation - banyuls reduction was salty and the squab confit just added to that.\n\nThough I didn't try it, my friend didn't finish her flatiron steak for the same reason- a salty mess.\n\nI think most disappointingly, our server started off great, but was a serious \"upseller\" and \"other seller\" i.e. after we ordered cocktails he actually talked my friend out of her choice: \"are you sure you'd also like to have the gin margarita? Wouldn't you like to try something else like, the SF Yacht Club, since you'll probably want to taste some of hers?\" Um, no, thanks, I'd like the cocktail I ordered! My friend ended up not really enjoying the SF Yacht Club, and felt muscled into it. \n\nHe also tried to talk us into ordering the cauliflower creme brulee, simply because it was a \"signature dish\" - we said \"no thanks\" simply because we (again) felt strong-armed into ordering it! \n\nAnother kitchen note: instead of having to order the cauliflower side, my friend asked for a side of brussels sprouts (not on the side dish menu). The server asked the Chef, who denied us. He said \"they didn't have enough.\" Really, Chef Dolan? You can't spare 10 brussels sprouts?? Lame.\n\nLastly on the service: it seemed to be a busy convention night. Fair enough. But once we'd put our entree orders in, the server virtually disappeared. Aside from two food runners, we saw no one for almost a half hour - including to take our next drink order. We felt forgotten for the 8 o'clock rush that arrived after we sat.\n\nAll in all, it's a sexy spot and good for conversation too, but just too inconsistent on this night. It was a a Tuesday- I'd think the service might have been more inconsistent on a busy weekend.\n\nSince I live in Marin, I'm not sure I'll come back for a while, if ever.

If I were rating for food only, it would be 4 stars but I had to dock half a star because the food was overpriced and one star for the service.  It all started when they took our drink orders and only 2 people ordered wine.  That was because the other three people were pregnant or breastfeeding.  It seemed to scare the waitress into thinking that she wasn't going to get a large order (and therefore tip) because before we ordered, she told us that the appetizers were \"tiny\" and that the entrees were \"moderate\" so she would recommend that we each get our own appetizers and entrees.  I thought that was weird because I hadn't heard that from my friends that recommended the place.  Then when a late friend showed up 10 minutes later, she repeated the same thing to them as soon as they sat down instead of making sure that they had any questions or even taking their drink order.  \n\nRegardless, we took her advice and each ordered an appetizer and entree.  Okay, so I'm a big eater to begin with but these were far from \"tiny\" or \"moderate\".  I left feeling stuffed from my porchetta (delish) and pasta appetizer (very rich but well worth it) and I didn't even clean off my plate.  Then again, I did eat 3 of the amuse buches.  I just got the feeling that the waitress had an ulterior motive because after we finished ordering, it took an act of god to flag her down for anything else (until the dessert order that is).  FYI, you should order the dessert sampler. Great way to try everything without packing on the pounds. \n\nFinally, my husband dropped by to say hello to the birthday gal and he pulled up a chair from the next table.  The waitress came by and told us that moving chairs was not allowed so she made him stand.  Please keep in mind that this was a 6pm Friday reservation and we were one of 3 parties at that time so the place was rather deserted.  Then the manager came to see what the fuss was about and after much discussion, had them put the chair back at the next table and then brought out an identical chair 10 minutes later for my husband to sit on.  Okay.... he left in 5 minutes because he can't stand snobby places like that.\n\nBottom line, convenient location if you live nearby, amazing ambiance, above average food, high prices and spotty (or snotty? haha) service.  Definitely worth trying but not rushing to come back.", "author": "Susan L."}

The drinks were slightly overpriced, but the ambiance was swank, trendy, and hip.  They pull a young SOMA crowd (read 25-35, single, and fairly affluent).\nThe brunch service was $100 out the door for 4 people.  While the food was really good, the portion sizes were small and the main dishes did not come with any sides (potatoes, salad, bread, etc.).  For that price, I would have expected at least a muffin basket at the table.  Overall, I'd definitely go back for drinks, but I'd need a discount coupon to get me back for food.", "author": "chris h."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-05-01", "description": "I went to 25 Lusk last night for dinner with friends and I've got to say I left feeling pretty ripped off. The atmosphere was fantastic, large and spacious but then again large and spacious in San Francisco definitely equals high prices. Anyway, we had a reservation but decided to have a cocktail in the lounge prior to getting seated. The hostesses at the front desk were very pretty and sweet as was the cocktail waitress that got our drinks and transferred them to our table. Once seated we wanted to get some appetizers ordered for the table, we also brought a couple bottles of wine that we wanted to get opened. Our waiter made us aware that there was a $30 corkage fee PER BOTTLE... Wait what? A.Y.F.K.M.??!!! I've brought wine to places where they charge one corkage fee but charging per bottle is just a total money grab and is an insult to guests with common sense. Umm ok, so we opened one of the bottles and enjoyed the wine together, we also ordered the duck confit and the Sashimi appetizers. When the apps arrived I was completely puzzled,  is this portion meant for an Ethiopian super model or something? the portions were less then tiny, they were MICRO.  Now I can appreciate that the presentation was fantastic and well executed but the serving sizes were too damn small for the $17+ per plate app prices. Taste wise the dishes were good, not spectacular but good. So the entrees arrived, my partner and I shared the Boar and our guest had the Sonoma Chicken. I was totally disappointed with the Boar.. it was just so so for me, sorta bland actually. The chicken our guest had looked fantastic but I can make Sonoma Chicken at home so... Waiter came around with the dessert menus and at that point I was like, \"F this, let's go somewhere we can enjoy the rest of our wine without paying another $30 just to open it!\" All in all it was just ok, service was good but sorta ho-hum, our waiter didn't have much personality... I would go back but ONLY for drinks with friends because I feel like the cost to value and satisfaction ratio is just not there.  I'm writing this a day later and honestly I still feel buyers remorse.. We spent $200 + for dinner for 3 people and I didn't feel likeit was worth it.  There's nothing worse than feeling ripped off after going out for a night of enjoyment.", "author": "Jason J."}

We arrived 40 minutes early, and were happy to wait at the bar - except that the restaurant was half full (Monday night).  The seating hostess told us that it'd be less than 40 minutes, and she'd check in with us - it wasnt, and she never did despite the light crowd.  Once seated, the food was good, as expected.  After paying, we asked if they could call a cab for us.  The hostess said that a \"big party\" just took 10 cabs and the best bet is to walk to the train station.  Seriously?  I didn't expect a ride home, but I did expect an effort to help.  For an expensive night out, there are plenty of great places in SF.

As a native New Yorker, I was incredibly impressed with what's for dinner in the Bay Area.\n\nThe cocktails are delicious and refreshing. I loved the \"Buck 25\"... spicy and imaginative house drink. The short ribs are incredible. Tender, juicy, and rich in flavor. On my way out, I nearly put in another order \"to go\". And try as many desserts on the menu as you can. Each one is more creative and elegant as the next. My Spicy Chocolate Truffle Cake looked too good to eat... I nearly framed it and sent it to the De Young Museum. Incredibly unique menu - over-order and share it all.\n\nThe ambiance, food, service, and overall experience at 25 Lusk is phenomenal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-10-15", "description": "This is our second visit for dinner at 25 Lusk. \nFirst off the the drink menu is original and refreshing. We've tried a number of their original drinks and haven't really found one that we don't like. My favorite drink is \"Dark and Stormy\". With just the right amount of ginger and citrus this drink is refreshing and gets you on your way to a very nice evening. \nAppetizers are limited to less than 10, and of the ones we tried all have have a great taste and the presentation is pleasing to the eye. For example last night we had the duck confit salad. It came and we had a nice amount of tasty duck with mache lettuce and pears. Very tasty and perfect size for an appetizer. \nThe main course selections are varied and descriptive enough. I've had the Pork Chop and the Flat Iron Steak, Daniel has had the Risotto now the Suckling Pig. The food is very flavorful and the plating is enjoyable. It's done perfectly every time. \nThe service has been spotty both times we were dining. Long waits between courses, to the point you wonder if your order was missed. I do enjoy the fact that all the servers take care of you. Different people water and bread your table, serve your food, and I watch them do the same to the other tables. The person who takes your order may not be the person delivering it. Regardless of who brings it to you, they know the food, give you a good description of what you ordered and what you're getting. They need to speed up the food delivery time. \nThe ambiance of the building is very pleasing. The wood beams, the support bars, the metal supports all add to the gravitas of the interior. \nThe smaller two person tables are a little close together as exampled by the fact we were verbally accosted by a hooker and her \"date\" the first time we dined, because she like my partner's cologne and then started telling us about her life. A little distance may have helped. the distance between tables was so little that you were practically dining as foursomes and not as a couple. \nThe area inside albeit gorgeous with warm wood and indirect lighting, has a degree of echo and the conversations in the lounge downstairs tend to force you to talk louder and deafens you to what your dining mate has to say. \nAll in all we would recommend this place for a great meal & good time. Ask for a booth if you want a little face to face time. The cost to service ratio is worth it. Good food, pleasant servers, tasty drinks, and an inviting ambiance.", "author": "Jim H."}

Had my birthday celebration here and everyone had a great time and absolutely loved the place. Some of my friends commented that you didn't have to really scream out loud to have a conversation with someone like other places. The drinks run around $11-$12 but you do get a pretty stiff cocktail. Our cocktail waitress was very nice but you do have to flag them down once the crowd builds. I always say, if you're nice to your server, they're nice to you back. \nTip: Since the place is chic, modern and cool, do dress up as most people are. \nSunday brunch was very pleasant and relaxing. I came with a bunch of friends last June and the service was excellent, the food good - our table had duck confit salad with strawberries, steak and eggs, and lobster Benedict and overall, the dishes were good. They also give you complimentary freshly baked muffins and breads and they were YUMMY. The chef also gave us a complementary shot of a huckleberry smoothie after we ordered and that was refreshing and a nice surprise. \nThe upstairs restaurants space is beautiful. Nice space, good food, great service and great company = a perfect Sunday. \nI do think that their Sunday business has not yet picked up since they just started brunch fairly recently - this meant a less hectic dining room and more attention from our waitress.

Be prepared as anything with alcohol starts in the double digits, paying for the build-out, I get it. \n     The 8:30 reservation secured with a credit card to charge a person for no-shows turned into a 9:20 seating and near boxing match with another 5 top hoping for the one cleared large table. The manager came by to apologize and promised to take care of us. The server let us know the first round of drinks were on the house. When we explained we were not drinking just hungry, she did not know where to go from there, so the entire thing went downhill. It was almost amusing as she asked us a second time if we were sure we didn't want to a free drink. We were hungry and tired at this point and she informed us she would not take our first course order until we decided on our second course. Way to read your table! \n     Once we finally ordered, we waited anxoiusly through a bread roll for the $14-$15 first courses. Crab- doused in a mousse that killed the delicate crab flavor; raw tuna again drowning in some odd white liquid- was it supposed to cover the fishy smell coming off the tuna? The crispy gnocchi \"we are known for our crispy gnocchi\" should have been called a short rib starter. This was the highlight of the meal even if the gnocchi were soggy, the short rib was the best seasoned and flavored protein of the evening. We went on the four entrees, all have been done, or are currently being done in several restaurants across the city. The proteins were each underseasoned and oversauced. At $25-$28 per course the server was correct when she said \"we are not known for our portions.\" \n    The funniest line of the evening was when our server made the third pitch for a free drink \"you look like you should have drinks, remember, they will be on the house\". I wanted so badly to pull out an AA coin and toss it on the table, but she followed with \"we have some non-alcoholic sodas and you can get all you want of those on the house too.\" Classic ending to a really bad dining experience. \n     The bar scene downstairs is worth the time and money. (I am actually a drinker and can appreciate a good bar.) Skip dinner, if you want a good meal for this amount of money hit Prospect, or any number of other places. \n     25 Lusk reminds me of the restaurants that got away with medicore food and service at really high prices during the dot.com boom of the late 90's.

The ambiance is very loungy and trendy downstairs, and that's my favorite part.\n We had dinner for a friend's birthday and noone was really blown away by the food, but it wasn't bad either. I would recommend the carpaccio, but definitely not the asparagus in gelatin thing- it was quite awful. \nI'll be coming back here for cocktails and appetizers, but probably not for dinner.", "author": "Jeanna L."}

First off, the location is awesome. Not only is it just right down the street from my house but the cool, hidden in the alleyway thing it has going on really works for it. Once you step in, you completely forget you are even in the city. It sets itself apart from all the hip, trendy spots without even trying. You feel ultra chic and know you are in for a treat the moment you are walked to your table. The ambiance is simply spectacular.\n\nHaving worked in the restaurant industry for a few years, I tend to look for certain things that definitely make or break my visit and make other restaurants stand out from the others. Twenty Five Lusk knows what they are doing and you can see it by watching the well orchestrated staff flow around the dining room floor. It is always the little things that count. Even when I got up from my seat to go to the ladies room, the floor manager noticed from across the room and made sure to stand by the stairs to guide me in the right path. \n\nOn that note...the bathrooms! It is a HUGE sign as to whether or not the staff is dedicated to making their customer's dining experience more memorable. It was CLEAN each visit I made and the hand towels were nicely folded cloths instead of your normal paper towels. When I got back to the table I actually told my guests to go visit the bathrooms when they had a chance. \n\nNow the main reason I am writing this, the food. To die for. I cannot speak high enough praises about the presentation, the portions, the flavors, everything! The standouts were the Cauliflower Creme Brulee, the Ribeye and well...every desert was exquisite. As a foodie, you crave adventure and the chefs at Twenty Five Lusk delivered above and beyond my expectations. Each course was a pleasant surprise and left us singing praises about how all of our dishes had something unique that we would never forget. \n\nThe staff, the location, the ambiance, the food...5+ stars in my book. And coming from a self-proclaimed foodie that has worked in the food biz here in SF for awhile now, thats a pretty big deal. We will absolutely be coming back and I have already recommended it to all my coworkers to go and try this amazing new restaurant where anything you order will blow your mind.", "author": "Morgan G."}

I knew that Matt Dolan was a talented chef but come on!  the dinner that my girlfriend and I were treated to last night was insane.  It goes a something like this: as we walked in we were immediately greeted by Asst. G.M. Nathan who was both gracious and accommodating.  We both ordered house specialty cocktails that were top flight concoctions that only aided in pushing our hunger from eager anticipation to straight up ravenous.  Chef soothed us with an amuse of the most amazing tuna crudo with tomato, cucumber and a house made spiced cracker. small bite, Big flavor!!  we were suggested an amazing Rhone style wine by sommelier Cesar.  we started down a dizzying journey of flavor and texture with a Tuna Ceviche that screamed its flavors across my palate.  next we had the Day Boat Scallop which was both briny and buttery at the same time and of course cooked to perfection. we then continued into a meat-centric round of app's spearheaded by the venerable pork belly that was prepared so perfectly it needed nothing else on the plate, it literally melted in my mouth with the top crispy skin side acting like a toffee slowly giving way to the rich flavorful layers of fat and meat underneath.  Ouch!!! that one is still haunting my dreams.  next was the Terrine of Ox Tail which in a word was Mesmerizing.  On Nathan's recommendation we decided to take on the Wagyu Cowboy Ribeye.  WTF!!! - this thing should be illegal for the amount of pleasure we were able to derive from it. 24 oz of the best steak I've ever had from Texas.  this isn't that hybrid Kobe from Idaho, Chef sourced this product from a small producer in Texas that specializes in pure Wagyu strain cattle and damn did that gamble pay off.  Topped only with some amazing Chantrelles, a little Purslane and a Demi that revels my own (I'm really trying to be modest, honest!), this gorgeous piece of modern art was absolutely the vegetarian heart of darkness (sorry Tony)this is what you need to order here.  Matt is also known for his whole roasted salmon but the meat is unforgettable.  A delightful little sampling of sweetness was sent to us compliments of the house and we were DONE!!  The staff was exceptional and never missed a beat.  the food and wine?  It was everything I wanted it to be and more.  Great job gang!!", "author": "Eric M."}

Appetizers were great, main course arrived about 45 minutes after we had finished first course.  Never had any good explanation of why, and they did a good job of saying sorry with a full free desert course, (everything they make, and it was great) but three hours later I was left wanting.

Typically I like to visit a restaurant a few times before forming a solid opinion about it so as to avoid catching it on a particularly \"good\" or \"bad\" night. I've now given 25 Lusk four chances to disappoint me, reveal the slightest flaw, but it has managed to blow me away entirely each time. The food, which I'll address in a moment, is beyond exceptional. The wait staff is superb. The ambiance is striking with its San Francisco meets New York vibe, and its modern meets old world architecture. Truly, Chef Matthew Dolan has created a masterpiece in his Soma restaurant. \n\nI've noticed that most of these reviews have weighed heavily on the downstairs bar. This is a pity. Not because the bar isn't exquisite, it most certainly is. But because I fear the incredible restaurant itself, just a floor above the hip bar scene,  is being overlooked. \n\nAnd the food? From the creamy butter on the table to the last spoonful of any of the desserts (yes, I've sampled most of them), every bite is sublime. One lovely surprise is the portion size of the entrees. I confess that there have been many times I've been to a top restaurant, and left with both empty wallet, and empty stomach. 25 Lusk drops the pretentiousness of dime sized plates that leave you frustrated and disappointed. More importantly, though, the satisfying portion size is hardly even a match for the care and expertise that goes into each plate. The gnocchi is pillowy and delightful, the chicken fried quail sinfully and surprisingly light, the ribeye a piece of buttery, flavorful tenderness, the intense burst of flavor in the grilled prawns is decadent. And I must say that on one of my visits, I overheard a man  at the next table stop his server and gush that he'd never had grits as incredible as those served with the grilled prawns - and he was from Alabama!  \n\nIn my opinion, 25 Lusk is the absolute top restaurant in San Francisco.", "author": "Lindsay P."}

First, let me shout out our server, Shannon. She was full of knowledge about what was about to hit the table. Out of 4 of us, 2 decided to try the tasting menu & the other 2 wanted to pick from the menu. If you want to be adventurous, this is a great restaurant to do it.  We began with a creamy gazpacho amuse bouche.(wonderful)  The tasting menu(http://www.25lusk.com/menus.html) was imaginative & curious but exceptional. Giant thumbs up to the kangaroo tenderloin! I would like to thank, Chef Matthew for coming out personally & explaining that particular dish. The sun choke & corn bisque was so delectable, I could have drank a cup of it. If you love foie gras, one of my dining companions ordered it from the first course menu & didn't leave a spot of it on her plate. I guess that means it was respectable. I had the whole roasted fish(which you can fillet yourself or let the kitchen do the work if you have a problem with fish eyes). I decided to fillet it myself since I am stickler for not destroying kitchen presentation. Be warned, you will have to safely pick through fine bones & it's worth every single precaution.

My review is based from my experience there at the bar and not the restaurant.  I give 1 star for the scene/ambiance.  It's nice, semi-swanky.  I subtract 1 star for the long wait to order a drink at the bar.  Bartenders there have no sense of urgency -- you can expect to wait 15 minutes before a bartender gets to you on a Saturday night.  I subtract another star for pompous bartenders.  My friend was ordering me a Hennessy & Coke and the response from the bartender was, \"We don't carry 'gangster' drinks here\".  If he is trying to refer to a certain ethnicity, I'll have you know Hennessy is not only preferred by \"gangters\" but it's widely drank in Asia and by Asians.  If you go to an Asian banquet what's on the lazy-susan?  A bottle of Henn.  Please educate yourself, bartender, and stop making yourself look like a naive.  The bartender is the one with a burnette/ginger beard.  As a substitute, he uses bourbon.  Way off buddy.  Hennessy is a cognac and tastes no where near a bourbon.  Another star subtracted for a poor selection of alcohol.  As you know by now there was no Henn and there was also no Remy and no Crown.  LASTLY AND THE MOST IMPORTANT, subtract another star because my husband left his debit card there and they still have yet to get back to him.  He called to notify them on Sunday and they said someone will get back to him.  No one got back to him and today is Tuesday.  My husband called again today and they gave the same answer, \"someone will get back to you\".

The Swordfish steak was a generous portion, we all were impressed with our dinner.  I would describe the place as swanky modern decor interior, as others have said, and older style brick building on the exterior. People dress up in smart casual, not just tank tops and jeans.  At the upstairs dinner area, I noticed  a good number of staff, awaiting to attend to the customers. There was no shortage of waiters and busing of the tables and keeping our water glass and other drinks filled up to the top, never had to wait to get attention, they were  always there.

Located in the SOMA, 25 Lusk is great place to hang out with friends, meet new people, and have a few cocktails. It's a place where you will almost always run into someone you know (if you go out in SF a lot). The decor of the place is modern with a large bar area downstairs (more like a lounge area) and the restaurant is upstairs. I have yet to try out the restaurant (although I have heard mixed reviews about the food and the price). The lounge area can get very crowded during Happy Hour (although there are no happy hour prices on drinks or food). The bar food menu is pretty good - the lamb meatballs and the fries are usually what I get. I've also used 25 Lusk for going away parties, large happy hours and get together with friends and coworkers. Overall, a good place to hang out with friends, have some light snacks/bar food, and a lot of drinks.", "author": "Vinson L."}

The restaurant is on a side street so you sort of have to know where you're going to get there. There is valet parking if you can't find any parking on the street. When you go in, it's a split level. There is a bar downstairs with open flame stoves and a bit of seating. Upstairs is the dining area and it's pretty spacious. The menu sounds good, but when comparing the first course the second course, I was wishing that the first courses were the second courses and vice versa. There is also a tasting menu option for $78. In my opinion, not a good choice. Go for the items you like on the regular menu. I had the pork belly confit for my first course. It was a single block of goodness. For the second course, I had the lamb. Also, pretty good. It did not have the normal level of gaminess. That was pleasant. We also had the creme brulee and string beans. They were covered in truffle. Anyway, they have a lot of wine to choose from so definitely ask the sommelier what's good.", "author": "Andrew Y."}

From the moment I first spoke with Nikki and the rest of her team I knew we were in the best of hands. It may not be the least expensive place in town to hold a private event, but if you want to do something properly and 25 Lusk fits your budget (and the atmosphere you're looking for: classy, upscale, lounge-y), I'd recommend it in a heart beat. I've organized a number of events in my day and never has it been so easy or so relaxing as working with Nikki. I told her what we wanted and she delivered above and beyond. She and her team were incredibly welcoming, accommodating, and all around helpful. They did everything in their power to make sure the night was a huge success - and it was. They even created custom drinks and signs for us, helped us coordinate decorations such as balloons, t-shirts, and mugs, etc., etc. Bottom line: the place is gorgeous and the team rocks.

The place doesn't look like much from the outside, inside is a different story, I really like the way they have engineered the post industrial space inside the building, mostly with a lot of wood, brick and glass making it classy and cozy at the same time. You can sit upstairs at the table and peek down at the lounge area. You can also see everyone who's coming in. The element that definitely draws everyone's attention are their brushed metal \"chimneys\" which look like from a design-cosmic movie or like huge drops of steel hung there to dry. So the interior is what counts here. Both times I was happy with the food, but what is more, I must say that they probably have the best service ever. The waiters know every item in the menu and all their specials too and are extremely helpful and friendly (not in an artificial way). The food is good, but didn't blow me away. They have a great HH prices and menu: $5/$6 for snacks wine and well drinks is very reasonable.

It might very well be the most interesting and beautiful restaurant in SF. That alone deserves 5+ stars. The service and the staff were very friendly. Our server was very attentive without hovering (always a GREAT thing). However, to explain the three stars, the food was at best: average. Would have given it one star if everything else wasn't great. There were four of us and we all got different things. I ordered the Cod and it was bland. We also got the Trout, the Chicken Fried Quail, which may have been the best dish, and my boyfriend got the Ribeye which was substituded with a Filet Mignon. We were all incredibly disappointed with the food. Every dish was tasteless, bland and far from worth the price. In all honesty I knew going in the food wouldn't be impressive. The buzz around the restaurant isn't the food it's the ambience and the drinks. The drinks were stellar so all was not lost on the food. After a few good drinks the average food gets us by for the night. The prices on the menu are for the experience not the food. But if they got a top chef in there (sorry I don't know who is in there now haven't read up on it) and/or completely changed the food. WOW! 25 Lusk would be amazing on all counts.

Yes, it's chrome-y tastic and \"modern\" enough to make me feel like I'm sitting inside of some avant garde painter's loft, but it's also populated with probate lawyers looking to throw their money around by buying some $15 drinks in the hopes of going home with someone too drunk to notice a quickly receding hairline.  So if you're looking for free booze and shallow junior partners, this is the place for you.

We went around 8 PM Friday night and it was packed!  I felt like I had just walked into a swanky New York bar/lounge.  The lounge was nice with modern fireplaces as well as comfortable couches (that's if you're lucky enough to land one).  However, other than the fact that the venue was nice everything else was downhill.  First off, we couldn't for the life of us get someone to take our order.  I mean we didn't get any service until we harrassed them twice as they were entering orders into their system.  To drink, I ordered the SF Yacht Club the first cocktail on their specialty list.  Disappointment!  It tasted like water with cucumbers in it.  The next disappointment was the food.  We ordered the 3 items on the menu: Lobster Roll +$3, Hamachi, and Truffle Oil Fries.  If you are hungry, you may want to swing by McDonalds first.  First off, I was a little thrown off that the lobster roll was extremely cold and it just tasted very average like lobster in a little bun.  Second, the hamachi plate was literally 3 pieces the size of a quarter.  It tasted disgusting as the hamachi wasn't very fresh.  The winner of the night sadly were the fries.  Honestly, just tasted like fries, you can barely taste the truffle oil.

OK, this is the OLDEST trick in the book, go buy drinks and wait for your table = please spend $$$ on drinks you probably don't want while we BS you about your table and reservation.  Why accept reservations, play this game and then give us a table that has been ready since we arrived.\n\nBad start, but we order wine, apps and entrees.

It's fine, but there are many better brunches.  The restaurants space is nice though and services just fine.  We had the donuts, asparagus scramble, and the banana pancakes.  The bloody mary was terrific.  The lounge and bar look great.", "author": "R N."}

Very average - well except for the prices, those were exceptionally high.", "author": "treven c."}

I had a gift certificate and even though I knew we would have to open our wallets to pay for the difference, I thought :why not going? So, here we were at trendy 25 Lusk. We were seated on time (my friend arrived first and didn't have to wait for us) which was nice. I ordered the radish salad and the steak. It was ok. The presentation is nice and fits in well with the vibe of the place. I didn't find the food to be amazing though. One my friends had the gnocchi appetizer dish which was delicious. I should have gotten that instead of the salad. \nThe restaurant itself is spacious and trendy. If you go all the way downstairs, there's a lounge and the bathroom with all the girls redoing their make-up so it gets super crowded when you are waiting in line with women who seem to be pretty drunk pushing you to look prettier so that they can get more free drinks and be super wasted. Anyway, overall, great space; I loved the decoration of the place. The people are a little too trendy for my small town mentality. The food is ok. You definitely pay the vibe of the place and the service. I wouldn't go back there for the food maybe drinks (if I can deal with the lounge superficiality).", "author": "Purple P."}

I ate here two nights in a  row and had spectacular food both times.  Chef  applies his abundant knowledge to sourcing better than average components, and then makes every plate  a work of art  drizzles of sauces that expand the whole taste experience. I have seen  these accent items make the difference between great and spectacular but here, avocado with toasted sesame in a puree, on the side of the salad made the second half even better that the first.  Big well-designed cocktail menu, and desserts that are fun to anticipate -- Chocolate chaos!\"  -- kept smiles on even my diverse group of work colleagues all evening.  Great for romantic dinner, after work (there's a basement lounge), or groups (corners provide private nooks), plus it got nice soundproofing  so you can actually hear everyone as well.  Well done!", "author": "DJ S."}

The decor and ambiance are great, modern, interesting, even rromantic. The food was excellent and the menu offered creative choices that were well executed. The wine list is global & extensive. The prices are high, but not outrageous. Our table's biggest complaint was that the portions were so small as to be ridiculous. The risotto could not have been more than 1/2 cup worth of food. The scallops were delicious, but there were only three small of them, along with a tablespoon of veggies. That's $9 per scallop. The dessert sampler was a complete joke. The chocolate cake measured 1.5\" x 0.5\". The sorbet was less than 1 tablespoon. The cheesecake was about 1.5\" in diameter.", "author": "Steve G."}

We decided to eat at the bar, even before we got there the bar menu sounded better than the restaurant. We had Manhattans, 3 each, they were good, we ordered the 3 small plates $19, pork rillette, jumbo prawn and the \"pizza slice\" that's exactly what they were small...very small. So small in fact that after we left we went to JAck in the Box, we were starving. So if you go for drinks only, great place, if you are hungry and want dinner...good luck! You will leave hungry.", "author": "joy e."}

We had been to 25 Lusk once before with another couple and had a great meal.  When we were there the first time it wasn't very busy and was a great experience.  The decor is amazing (contemporary modern open space).  So when our friends were planning a trip to SF from the east coast we made arrangements for the chefs table.  Upon arriving for our 9:30pm res the place was packed (both the lounge and the restaurant).  Needless to say it was quite loud.  We were seated and ordered from a pared down menu without a hitch, that's when it went downhill.  The requirement for sitting at the chefs table is dropping a min. of $750, perfectly understandable.  The amuse was basically a piece of salted butter with a sliver of radish (very uninspired).  The apps and entrees were good nothing awe-inspiring.  The problem was the wait.  Huge lag times between courses.  The waiter was very apologetic and promised that he would \"take care of us,\" that never happened either.  You'd also think that maybe the manager would come to the chef's table at some point to greet the patrons dropping some cash at your restaurant, nope.  Did the chef come out??  Nope.  We didn't see the manager until the end of the night when we were outside waiting for our cabs that never came.  We had asked the waiter to arrange cabs for us with no avail.  My wife finally went back in and complained to the manager that cabs weren't even coming down to the restaurant but were being taking by other people at the end of the block.  So for our guests that night we enjoyed great atmosphere, marginal food, marginal service all for nearly $1000!  There are so many other fantastic restaurants in the city where you can spend that amount of money and get everything you'd expect then to waste your time here.  Another trendy SF restaurant that won't stand the test of time.", "author": "Tony W."}

It's a nice space...but what a let-down!  Dinner was expensive and did not live up to expectations.  If you are a foodie...choose somewhere else to eat.   We shared several appetizers, including the cauliflower creme brulee and the dungeness crab salad.  The cauliflower was a bust for me, the crab ok.   Among the group we ordered mushroom risotto (small portion very rich), cod (too smokey), steelhead (tasty!),hanger steak, and roasted shrimp with lemon risotto.  Our empty plates sat on the table for a good 20 minutes before anyone cleared them.  The host came over to wish our guest a birthday wish, but got her name wrong.  My expectations were for a great meal...and it definitely didn't live up.  We went down to the bar for a drink after dinner and waited a good 20 minutes for the bartender to take our order.  Seriously?  Definitely leaves lots to be desired.", "author": "Laura D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-01-10", "description": "We had high hopes for Twenty Five Lusk but they were quickly dashed.  First the good points:  they make a decent soup.  The amuse bouche (carrot and citrus) and the parsnip soup on the menu were both fine.  Not great but good enough.   We were also happy with the wine list.  That's it.  The rest of the meal was really weak.  People rave about the cauliflower cr\u00e8me brulee?  I don't get it.  Maybe if you like Cap'n Crunch for dinner.  It was so sweet.  No balance at all in the flavors.  I couldn't taste anything over the cloying sweetness.  The grilled steelhead dish had way too many elements competing against each other and this dish also had an underlying sweetness that I found completely out of place.  It hurts to think we paid $27 for that plate of food.  The roasted vegetables were soft and cold.  The other dishes on the table were mediocre.  The scene was so 1999.  That may work for some people but I say leave the past in the past.", "author": "Betsy B."}
