It's like a way more delicious version of carpooling. My cousins go to Mayes fairly frequently, and were pleasantly surprised at how they were able to turn a crowded bar/club into a nice brunch spot. We easily made a reservation on their website and were seated within a few minutes. My cousin and her two year old are both vegan, and definitely appreciated that they had a vegan scramble on their menu. They gave little man some french fries on the house, which made his whole day! They didn't have the mimosa bar on the day that we visited, nor did they have a themed brunch, which was a little disappointing. I got a little excited reading other reviews because I LOVE Game of Thrones and Harry Potter, so I was looking forward to seeing what they had in store. The food more than made up for it though! I had the La Triveta benedict, which came with huge thick pieces of bacon and crawfish (I'm obviously not vegan). The eggs were perfectly poached, and the hollandaise was on point. The cocktail list also looked interesting, though we opted to go for the bottle of bubbly for mimosas! Four entrees and a bottle of champagne ran just under $100, which is pretty decent for San Francisco! I'll definitely check this out again next time I'm in the city.", "author": "Justine L."}

I didn't even peek at the menu because at that point what was more appealing was they were accepting reservations and the next one was only a 15 min wait!  Sold!\n\nI think a lot of people had the same idea that we did because all of a sudden a crowd of brunchers armed with yelp descended onto this restaurant - what I was impressed with was the army of help the suddenly appeared to talk to the crowd, exit the tables that were ready to leave and get everyone seated in a pretty timely manner.  The menu was a \"game of thrones\" themed menu but right under that menu I could see a crab Benedict hidden away ....why oh why wasn't there a \"Greyjoy\" special that featured crab from the depths of the cold ocean (if you add this onto the menu please let me know - I'll make the drive up from Tracy just for this).\n\nWe ended up ordering a few dishes and two speciality cocktails - my Benedict was good and that beet flavored hollandaise was just amazing.  I ordered also a prickly pear jalape\u00f1o mimosa because they were out of the mango which I really wanted.  We were a party of 4 so one of our friends ordered what I did, another had a veggie scramble and finally a steak and bacon Benedict.  We finished our meals and cleaned up our plates.  The food was good to end up with 4 empty plates within 20 mins.  The service was good - take your order, drop off orders, check up on you - take a picture of the group and kept the h2o flowing.  \n\nThe restroom was clean for the most part - you could tell that the customers weren't very good at cleaning up after themselves, the space itself well furnished with both indoor and outdoor seating and all in all it was a fun experience and worth a repeat.", "author": "JOE M."}

Got the special on the first day, and a regular menu item on the second (although I regretted that immediately after I saw the special that my friend received!). Both times the food was tasty, and the service was good. This place has started to get very busy. I had about a 10ish minute wait for a table, which I thought was reasonable as I was still waiting for my friend anyways. But after we were seated, I noticed quite a large line forming at around 12.\n\nDifferent tasty mimosas, where you can order up to a half pitcher (good for those casual brunch days). Also having paper table clothes + crayons is a fun way to kill time waiting for food. Last time I was there, my potatoes felt a little colder than the previous time so I'll chalk that one up to a mishap. Will be back for another themed adventure in the future.

I was organizing brunch for a dozen people and I was nervous about my options.\n\nFriends with Benedicts got my attention; what a creative name!

When we arrived at 12:30, they were ready for us.\n\nThe server did a great job managing our drink and food requests.

I had read from the reviews that there wasn't a wait. We showed up around 11am for brunch thinking we would have plenty of time to make our 2pm show. But there was a line! Ok, our bad. It took 45 minutes to be seated - it's San Fransisco - we should have expected us. Once we were seated we ordered pretty quickly, but then our food kept not coming, and we realized that we really weren't going to be able to finish before our show started! So we asked to cancel our order. Fortunately they were super nice about it. They said they were so sorry and were way busier than they had ever been and to come back and next time it was on them...\n\nSo we did! This time success! To start, we were smarter.  We got there around 9:30/9:45 on a Sunday and did not have to wait for a table.\n\nOur waiter was prompt in taking our order, and the food actually ended up coming out really quickly (almost too quickly), so clearly in the last couple of weeks they have done some reorganization to accommodate for more people.\n\nI got the Salazar Benedict. The eggs were perfectly poached. The hollandaise was different.  I'm having a hard time explaining how - it almost tasted like it had nutritional yeast in it? (this is not a bad thing). It was not very lemony.  It was different.  The flank steak was delicious and the mushroom, tomato and bacon went awesome with it.  The English muffin was unimpressive. Not flavorful and got soggy. Suspecting it was previously frozen. Hash browns were standard.\n\nMy husband got the special Jambalaya with Eggs over rice. It was pretty good. Not too spicy.  I like the Benedict better, but it seemed solid. They do themed breakfasts along with their normal menu and it was from the theme.  \n\n$5 - a great deal for a mimosa! With either orange or cranberry.  They serve it in a water glass which is a little funny, but it was plenty strong, so not complaining there.  They also have other cocktails.\n\nI tried to order a decaf coffee and they said they didn't have decaf.  Which is kinda funny, because the first time I went they did.  It wasn't very good that time, so I guess I didn't really miss out on anything.  \n\nI'm giving them 4 stars because I'm rooting for them to work out their kinks because I like their style.", "author": "Sarah C."}

A cheeky name and poached eggs...seemed right up my alley!\n\nCame on a Sunday afternoon and was seated immediately which was shocking. Brunch on a Sunday at 12PM with no wait?! We gave credit to it being super bowl Sunday. My sister ordered the Salmon Benedict, her fiance the Salazar Benedict (steak), and I the Trivet Benedict (bacon & crawfish). To wash it all down we ordered the Bellini mimosa. \n\nWhen the benedicts first came to our table, there were a few mistakes. First, they brought a Florentine instead of the Salmon. This actually wasn't a huge deal, and they brought out the correct one shortly after. \n\nSecond, they put beet hollandaise sauce on my Trivet Benedict when it was supposed to be just regular holldandaise. To an extent, I understood the mixup because accidents happen and every table was full so the kitchen was busy. However, what threw me off was when the server told me \"there's the beet hollandaise in there but it tastes the same\" while putting the plate in front of me. Unfortunately beets make me sick (and doesn't sound appetizing on bacon/crawfish, but that's just me), and I guess I would've just appreciated her asking if it was okay rather than just stating that it tastes the same because it left me feeling awkward when having to tell her that I couldn't have it. \n\nAs for the actual Benedicts once they arrived correctly, I immediately admired the beautifully poached eggs. Unfortunately, the taste for all of them were just all right. Good, but not the best benedict I've ever had. \n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my time at Friends With Benedict. Although their benedict wasn't drop-dead amazing, I still liked the environment and unique menu they serve which makes it worth checking out if you're into pop-ups.

We put in our orders as soon as we saw a huge party come thru the doors- but this is where they fell short.

The eggs benedicts all turned out quite fine but my side of potatoes - a rather simple side- was really undercooked.\n\nThe mimosas are a bargain but tasted ok - $13 for a half liter of a traditional mimosa (or $6/glass) or $18 for a half liter of the bellini (or $7-8/glass).\n\nAll in all - I would gladly return here because the concept is so fun and they have a lot of potential- I just think having been 1 month open - they still need to up their game a bit on executing.

They did have butcher paper and crayons which was nice and amused us for the first 30 minutes. \n\nMy sister ordered a breakfast sandwich off the special themed menu and it was delicious. The rest of us ordered scrambles and they were okay. Highlight was the perfectly crispy hash browns it came with. Overall, good but definitely not worth an almost two hour wait. \n\nThe one bright spot was the server who was extremely friendly. He was horrified when he found out how long we waited, explained they were short a server and a cook and gave us a discount on the bill. They also closed the restaurant early when they realized how backed up they were so appreciate them trying to do the right thing but probably won't go back.", "author": "Sarina Y."}

It's a little weird to see so much Greek decor around but it's also sort of neat since it's a pop-up.\n\nClassic Eggs Benedict with hash brown: Love the hollandaise sauce and the flavor was great with a little fresh chives on top.  The poached eggs were way overcooked which was ok for me because I don't like yolk anyway, but if you like your eggs poached perfectly so the yolk is golden and runny, then you won't like this.  The yolk was solid, like you could cut with a knife.  The hash brown was sort of just ok. It tasted like frozen hash brown heated up. But for me, the benedict was defined by the hollandaise, and I just like mine classic (no lemon, no orange, no funkiness in it) and they just do a nice creamy one.\n\nJambalaya: it's an interesting dish.  It tasted like some bites had no flavor and some bites just tasted like hot sauce.  Overall, it needed a little more flavor and the base was mushy. I'm not sure what they use as their base but it was super mushy. I wanted to like it more but the mushy texture was a real bummer.  I hope it was just cuz we were on the later end of breakfast but just be warned that it could be a real bowl of mush if you order it.\n\nPancakes: fluffy and light.  Tasty, but it definitely needs butter or syrup because the pancake itself doesn't have a ton of flavor.  One pancake was also burned on the bottom.  Kind of a bummer cuz you can just taste a lot of \"burn\" flavor.\n\nService: super friendly and helpful.  Great environment.  Unfortunately the food is just really slow to come out. They should really warn you that it's going to be a really slow meal but if you're in a rush this is not for you because it's really really slow.\n\nI think if they weren't so friendly I'd give them fewer stars but the environment is a great casual breakfast pop up.  I'll probably try a few other breakfast spots before returning but I think it was still worth a try.\n\nOpens until 2:30pm or until they run out of food.\n\nTakes credit cards (via square swiped at your table)\n\nSingle sex single bathroom in the back.", "author": "Traci H."}

Our server apologized profusely and deducted 10% off our meal. \n\nI thought I'd give it a second try, since I liked their benedicts options and wanted that bacon. But they took it off the list! Other items might've been removed too because the selection looked more ordinary. Waited forever for a server to take our order (I had to flag someone down). I tried to be creative by going with hot chocolate pancakes with marshmallows. The pancakes tasted good but no marshmallows. Also no utensils until we asked for them. Other things came up where I felt like I focused more on waiting for service than enjoying my time there. The mimosa bar looked great though, with a tantalizing selection of fruit options.

Had a slow start to Sunday morning and checked yelp for a breakfast spot and found this spot. The owner Derek and staff were super friendly. The dishes felt very thought out. They were in a game of thrones theme when we attended which was very creative. I had the 2 eggs and toast item with a chorizo hash which was excellent. Highly recommend the chorizo hash. Whole party really enjoyed their meals and experience. Fun addition was the paper table cloths and crayons.", "author": "Alex A."}

The silverware is stained and the tables and chairs are worn down with overuse. Servers are completely clueless. We stood in a line to get it for 12 mins. No not because it was full but because no one was there to greet or seat us. After getting seated the bumbling waiter finally took our order and forgot multiple times, coming back to confirm what we wanted twice. The food took forever to cone out. With a half empty restaurant, they were somehow backed up. \n\nFood was in a word GREASY. I got a scramble and hash browns all I could taste was cheap canola oil. So unappetizing. Companion got the salmon Benedict which he liked so that's where the two stars come in\n\nWe also got the bourbon French toast to share. This was super disappointing, it seems like they used cheap white bread that was doughy and disgusting. Everything was overpriced on top of it, My scramble was $14 and I got a tiny portion of eggs and those disgustingly greasy hashbrowns. \n\nI'd recommend this place go from pop up to pop out and get outta town.

I made a reservation through Yelp as well as emailing the restaurant, as I was planning on coming with a large group (10). While they were very friendly leading up to it, I don't think they were ready to handle such a large group. I overheard the hostess making comments to another patron about not wanting the large group to show up as I approached her to check the group in. \n\nOnce we got seated, we waited about 15 minutes to place a drink order, then another 5 before we got water (and another 10 before coffee). They acknowledged they were busy, but smaller groups were getting in and out without us making any progress. The food was decent, but most options seemed like something I could make at home. \n\nI like the idea of the themed brunches and changing menus. Maybe it would be a better experience with a smaller group.", "author": "Emily M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-04-16", "description": "Was really excited to try out a place dedicated to Benedicts  (at least in name), as they are my all time favorite brunch food.  Boy did I get my hopes up. First if all, after being seated and served coffee, we didn't see our waiter again for about 15 minutes.  When he does come back he asks us if we planning on ordering actual food.  Uhh.  You think I came here for coffee? \n\nSo we finally put in our order. I got the Trivet, boyfriend got the special, Mike Tysons punch out Benedict (steak grilled tomato spinach).  We also got pancakes to split since they're 5 bux.   Why not.  \n\nWell the restaurant wasn't really that busy for Easter Sunday brunch, but food still waited about 30 minutes for our food.  Got the eggs and they were basically hard boiled.  Not even remotely runny. For both of our benedicts. The English muffin was basically a piece of cardboard and I bent my utensils before giving up entirely. Bacon on my dish was chewy and undercooked. Pancakes were alright.  The best thing I had was the flank steak.from the special benedict.  That was well cooked.  I handed off my plate with most of the English muffins and an entire egg still on the plate, in all its hard yolked glory for the waiter to see when they picked it up.. not a peep.  Took it and trashed it and then another 30 minutes later, came back with the bill for $43.  \n\nThis place won't be getting my business again.  So disappointed. \n\nIn their defense, and the reason for more than 1 star, is that I saw other tables with perfect poaches.  I don't believe in sending back food.  I hate to waste and my mom always made me finish my food, but I couldn't with this.  You get one chance to impress me.  And they didn't.  \n\nYe be warned", "author": "Adam S."}

All the staff is very nice and the presentation is super-charming. Overall, the food is relatively standard but solidly executed and decent portions. The drink prices are a bit high. Of course this is where places make their margins but they seem exorbitant - $18 for a carafe of passion fruit mimosa. I like the crayons and paper table cloth vibe as well. Only thing preventing a higher rating - the food isn't spectacular flavor wise, more like standard diner fare, and the glasses/plates/silverware are all in bad shape, nothing to cause health concerns but definitely not \"squeaky clean.\" I appreciate they are doing something unique and genuinely welcome for that specific strip of Polk.

Since I avoid almost all vegetables I asked for no onions or mushrooms.  When it came, there were no onions or mushrooms, but for some reason they put a lot of tomatoes in there.  I sent it back and explained that the menu said nothing about tomatoes or I would have said that as well.  The brought me a new one but this time there was no steak.  Only bacon and sausage.  In the first one I did notice there was a lot of steak in there.  I should have, but I didn't complain about this one since my friend was already almost finished with his meal.

I live nearby and am always glad for new options. I'm afraid I probably won't be back to this pop-up.\n* 11:05am Saturday. Bit of a wait which is standard for Polk Street and vicinity; not much you can do about that but FYI (does not factor into my rating)\n* Server guy just did not seem into helping our party of 5. We ordered 4 coffees. There was 1 single-serve container of cream available on table. Asked for more creamers. He only brought 2. Had to ask again for more cream, he seemed inconvenienced then came back and just kind of tossed a handful of the creamers at the corner of the table and walked away. He seemed to be inconvenienced by serving the table in general\n* Waited 55 minutes to receive food from time we placed order; when food arrived all of it was generally cold - super bummer :(\n* We could not eat our cold food because we had no silverware (maybe after 55 minutes of sitting without silverware and multiple trips to our table server guy might have noticed? Or noticed no silverware when brining the meals?). After several minutes of being unable to eat our meals, nor get his attention, I got up and went to the front to collect napkins (didn't have any of those either) and silverware for our party of 5\n* I had the smoked salmon benedict which was fine, although cold as mentioned. Could be a bit more generous on the hollandaise in my opinion/for my tastes. (Why do restaurants seem to skimp on the hollandaise? It's the main attraction of the eggs benny. If they're trying to conserve, maybe they could just make more to being with?)\n* I very much enjoy the hash browns instead of home fries! Long live hash browns!\n* Total bill (without tip) for 5 entrees, 2 half-liters of mimosa and 4 coffees was approx. $75 which was obviously a great price. Perhaps they took something off the bill? The guy that runs this pop-up noticed I was grabbing my own silverware so perhaps that's the case and if so, the gesture is appreciated.\n\nBTW he is the same guy that does New Village across the street. Very, very nice dude and creative with the themes and the ingredients - - but unfortunately runs two slow-service businesses. I was a bit apprehensive to dine here when I noticed him running the show upon arrival. Was hoping that with different cooks than at across the street it might be a more  efficient operation. Definitely plan on a long wait for food so don't arrive starving to death. Love to see them pick up the pace and give a bit more attention to the basics. They deserve to succeed and can - the brunch business on Polk is a goldmine! But a captive audience is no excuse for mediocre service.", "author": "Jen V."}

Would strongly urge you to consider another - any other - option for breakfast/brunch. For context, I ordered a scramble and a cup of coffee - the scramble was runny, the component meats undercooked and the cold cheese added as a garnish on top barely melted and only served to chill down the plate. The side \"salad\" (for which I paid extra) was a handful of unseasoned spinach served with huge chunks of raw red onion and a half-ramekin of goopy factory bought dressing. The lingering acridity of their house coffee haunts me even as I write this - if I had to take a wild guess, I'd say \"day old partially evaporated coffee, reheated the next day and cut with equal parts hot water and quaternary ammonia\".
