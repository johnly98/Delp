Meat selection is a bit limited, but the carne asada is always a solid choice. \n\nFor about 6 bucks, you get a big bag of home-fried tortilla chips and guacamole. Great for a last-minute watch party for any sporting event that won't break the bank. \n\nAmbiance:\nDon't expect much dine-in options here.

Zero flavor, zero taste, too much beans and simply disappointing.\nSo if this is because I had high expections and they were not met, then it is what it is.\nSadly, it was a waste of calories\nOdly, the people who brought me the burrito enjoyed theirs and said that it was just fine and that I am over reacting, I can be but man it had no flavor, perhaps its the method of preparing the food.

The cashier and the person taking order should really try to listen. I'm not about toe at chips without salsa. The burrito itself tasted ok. Nothing special here.

As I'm mission district faithful when it comes to taquerias.

They have virtually every kind of burrito you could ever want, plentiful options for the meat-eating, seafood loving, or vegetarian. Of course they have other standard Mexican fare aside from burritos, but really how can you not get one here? I struggled to choose just one, but opted for the Terrapin which had soyrizo along with black beans, avocado, veggies, etc. It was large, juicy, and delicious! The kitchen is open and you can see that they are constantly cooking up ingredients fresh. House made chips come with your order and you can request red or green salsa.

My boyfriend is Mexican and he says this is the closest to authentic Mexican food he's had around the area. And trust me, he is very critical of Mexican food. \n\nThe food here is very affordable for the amount of food you get (and you get huge portions). Most standard tacos, burritos are under $10. Every order includes free chips because they make a lot of them everyday. It's quite a small place, so it does get really busy, and food is cooked to order, so there is quite a bit of wait. Make sure to avoid coming during lunch time, and from 6pm until they close at 9pm. There's also regular french fries, as well as sweet potato fries on the menu. As for drinks, they have traditional Mexican drinks, such as horchata and Mexican bottled sodas. Did I mention they have vegetarian/vegan options? You can order veggie fajitas, or a soyrizo burrito (vegan chorizo).\n\nThe service here is non-existent. They're usually too busy handling a lot orders, and making awesome food, so they're not going to wait on you hand and foot. They basically take your order, they cook it, and prepare it. And there's nothing wrong with that! It's all about the food! People need to lighten up! This isn't exactly Bobby Flay's restaurant. It's a small joint for your Mexican cravings. Stop acting bougie!\n\nTIP: Ask for more chips and they'll give it to you for free! They make tons of fresh batches everyday, and they need to get rid of it somehow!", "author": "Oliver B."}

Lots of melty cheese, guac and pico. I wanted more sauce though as it was kind of dry. The hard shell taco managed to stay crunchy given the trip to outer richmond. But the beef/chrizo didn't have much flavor. I had a bite of the roommate's burrito. I don't like beans, so I didn't care for the sauce as it tasted a little beany. They also gave us two small bags of chips and a salsa. I liked the salsa as it had a good spice. Wish they gave us two sides of salsa as it was really only enough for one bag of chips.\n\nA couple years ago, the roommate and I went to their other location on Divisadero.

About two months ago I went back and ordered the carnitas burrito since my first experience there was great, but to my surprise, there was hardly any meat. I wanted to give them another try, so I just went the other day, and ordered a carne asada super burrito; all I had in my burrito was a couple scraps of meat and 99% rice and beans.

The expresso with red enchilada sauce, cheese, and sour cream on top is soooo good. The Nor Cal is my favorite because it has fries in it. Tortillas nicely grilled for maximum flavor and ideal texture. Many options for vegetarians. The shrimps were overcooked in the Cancun, but the rest of the burrito was delicious. The ladies work their ass off so they are not always in a good mood but if you speak Spanish they'll warm up to you.  The green salsa is yummy but they only give you one so if you want more I think they'll charge you unless they're in a good mood and they hook one up if you ask nicely.", "author": "Athena K."}

I've been here a few times, live in the neighborhood for over 5. \n\nMy main reason for this review is to advise customers of the sneaky overcharging! It's totally up to the customer to pay attention to what you are getting and what you are paying. \n\nHowever, to build into your business model to overcharge customers in attempts of stealing those small amounts, bit by bit to increase your revenue is disgusting, intolerable and I refuse to support your employees and the institution. \n\nI love food! To pay for it and to Eat it. Yum. Happy belly!\n\nCharge more, get better ingredients, upgrade your facade and interior; whatever. Just don't CHEAT me, I will cut you like cake!\n\nI ordered the same thing a couple weeks ago and walked away thinking, \"hmm, I think she overcharged me\". But seeing as how I noticed after paying and just leaving, I didn't want to go back in and fuss.\n\nBut today I made sure to pay attention. It's my hard earned money and I love to spend it but not have it taken. So I ordered the same burrito as I did last time with the same add's.....And I caught it! \n\nI also wasn't asked if I wanted a bag or not and was already charged the bag fee. So in total being overcharged $1. Plus I tipped, $1.25 so if I had gone to Taco Bell instead I would up $8. \n\nLike I said, charge more on your menu, upgrade the quality so I can give you my money. Don't steal it like a thief. \n\nTruth is, there is no good Mexican on this side of the hill. So if you are craving Mexican and not the just add H20 food I often buy from Taco Bell then go here!\n\nIf you are not limited by transportation then @ least go over the hill and buy legit, real Mexican goodness! \n\nYou'll be soooooo much glad-ER you did!!", "author": "Jessica M."}

I love your Espresso Burrito with pinto beans and shredded chicken. I have never strayed away from this item. I am unhappy that I have to pay tax on my free burrito that I earned by using the \"buy 9 and get 10th one free\". Through the years I have earned 3 free burritos and each time stated by the same employee who knows that I am a long time customer that I have to pay tax. So far, I have declined paying tax and as recent as December 2017, I stated to that same employee that it is not right to charge me tax. She stated that it's the owners policy. I stated to her that this policy is not on the card and that whenever I receive a free meal due to my birthday or a rewards card, I am NEVER CHARGED TAX. Additionally, she stated that I had to order a different burrito. Again, I stated that I have always received my free favorite burrito. I am giving 3 stars for enjoying my burrito. 5 stars will be given when I am stopped being asked to pay tax on my free burrito. I think it's an insult and tacky! I never pay tax for gifts. I would like to continue patronizing your establishment and earning my free burritos which I consider to be a gift and a treat.", "author": "Jenny S."}

But circling for OVER AN HOUR and still no space?  That's just mean.  And as if watching my gas tank slowly empty wasn't enough, smelling the food from the taquerias I was passing by was just excruciating.  Parking karma, how could you forsake me?!\n\nAfter giving up and leaving for the Sunset, the only thing on my mind was getting a burrito.  Although I wanted something from Gordo's, I drove out to Burrito Express since I knew parking would be easy (what's a little more gas burned?).  While I normally get their regular burrito and go on my way, I decided to try the El Expresso Burrito (with carnitas) since I saw it was listed as \"best in house\".  \n\nAlthough I know a lot of people that really like Burrito Express, I still think their food is just okay.  My burritos from them in the past have been neither great not bad, and this one was more of the same.  I liked their special expresso sauce that they poured on top, but I thought the carnitas needed a little help.  The flavor was decent, but the meat felt somewhat overcooked.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, Burrito Express sits in the middle of the pack of taquerias for me.  Given the Sunset's slim pickings and the relatively easy parking though, Burrito Express is pretty solid choice for something convenient.

I substituted rice for beans as well.  They also include complimentary chips.  The carnitas could have been a teeny bit moister, and it tasted a little tea like or like chinese wushu (red pork) pork in the claypot..it was odd, but not horrible.  Next time I'll go for another type of meat.  His California Burrito, though it can't compare to Iguana's in SJ or any place in San Diego, was not bad for SF.  He wished the fries would have been crispy though.  They filled his up to the brim with lots of steak and fries and avocado.  \n\nThe chips were satisfying and love their salsa verde.

While waiting for it, we added up the bill and it was off by $0.75. I informed the cashier that the bill doesn't add up when I picked up the burritos. The cashier looked at it, denied that there is anything wrong with the total. I insisted that the bill does not add up right and she called another lady to help her. The other lady looked at the receipt and said \"it's off by $0.75 because one of the burrito order with chorizo needs additional $0.75 for the meat, the cashier didn't charge you for it but now she will\". The cashier then took my receipt and went to the cash register and said she will add another $0.75 charge to it. I looked at the menu - and the meat (chorizo) we ordered is not listed for additional charge on the menu board so I left and didn't want to reason with the cashier anymore. \n\nThe food was just okay and more expensive than normal burrito in the city.

This place is great for vegans! They explicitly state on the menu that the brown rice and three types of beans are all vegan, which saves you from wondering. You're not stuck with boring ol' beans, because they have a tofu option and a soyrizo option. \n\nOn my first visit I tried the tofu burrito, which was good but not amazing, probably 4 stars. The tofu cubes were moist (nothing worse than chewy, dry tofu) without having that \"wet, plain tofu\" flavor that sometimes happens. Would have benefitted from more seasoning or maybe a sauce on the tofu, especially since the brown rice is unseasoned (the Mexican rice option is not vegan)\n\nTonight's visit - soyrizo burrito (El Terrapin). I went with tofu on the first visit because I was worried that the soyrizo would be too greasy, but let me assure you that the oil in this soyrizo is your friend. The spicy soyrizo grease (bear with me) coats the brown rice and gives the burrito the sort of richness that cheese would otherwise provide. It's not like the gross greasiness of bad Chinese food; it melds, it harmonizes, it feels... indulgent. The spiciness is enough to make you feel warm inside without overpowering the other flavors. The whole thing comes together just so well, and has a heartiness that is hard to find in other vegan burritos. Best of all, the El Terrapin is vegan as is, so you don't have to feel like a pain asking for things to be omitted. They did (unexpectedly) ask which of the veggie mixes I wanted and I went with (and recommend) the \"vegetarian special\" which is a nice traditional bell pepper/onion/tomato/lettuce mix.\n\nWait time is not great, but you can call ahead or seemingly order online.", "author": "Dee R."}

Fresh thick crispy (not hard) chips. Loads of cheese covering the chips. Juicy carne asada on top of the cheese. Bean paste instead of whole beans. then its topped off with 1/3 guacamole, 1/3 pico de gallo and 1/3 sour cream.  You can barely see the chips by the time they top off with all the toppings. Why i like it, its not soggy, the cheese melted on top provides protection form the other wet ingredients. You know the nachos is a winner when theres more toppings than chips! Man i love this gooey, cheesy, meaty and crispy mess! for some reason its not greasy either, dunno why, but  I like.\n\nThe service here is fairly quick compared to their other location.

Expect a wait, it's a very small place with just a counter that you can eat on, definitely more for take out. I'm from socal and so far I haven't been able to find mexican food in SF that can compare, yes I've been to el farolito and even la tacqueria Cancun. \n\nFor the food:\nEl Burrito ($5), which is just a classic burrito, pick your own meat. Comes with rice, beans and cheese. I got carne asada (extra $0.75). It was just okay for me, I would give it 3 stars. Maybe because its on the cheaper side, they didn't give too much meat. You have the option to choose extra meat for another $2.00. The carne asada was good in itself, I think the rest of the ingredients were lacking flavor and that's why the burrito wasn't great overall.\n\nCarne asada fries: I would give it 4 stars. The flavor was great, I would've given it 4.5 stars if the portion was bigger. It comes in a medium size paper plate, most places in socal fill up an reg size to go box. They ran out of guacamole,  which they told me when I ordered, they gave me sliced avacado instead, I didn't mind that so much.\n\nThe food comes with free chips and salsa! You get a small sandwhich size bag of chips (I got 2 with my order) and two small things of salsa, one red and one green. I prefered the green salsa. I liked the chips, they look and taste like the authentic ones, not store bought. \n\nOverall, I would've given 3 1/2 stars if I could. I think for the price the food is pretty good. I would definitely come back for the carne asada fries. \n\nTips:\n1. Phone in your order so you dont have to wait so long.  \n2. Get it for take out\n3.

There is a single entry and exit point in the restaurant and it's on a 2-foot long, 25 degree slope. These two factors are no big deal unless you're disabled, but the counter is laid out so the only way to place an order, pay, or receive an order is to stand sideways in the doorway with one leg up like a pirate. A few years ago this place revamped their menu, website, and marketing strategy. Even offered delivery. Delivery stopped shortly thereafter for some reason. \nThis is literally the only burrito place in the immediate area. Most taquerias in SF have at least one competitor within a few blocks. I think it's time to put some of that monopoly money into a remodel. 2 stars only because the folks that actually make the food are awesome and the burritos are decent. One other thing: They nickel and dime you for any and all extras, but the prices for entrees are possibly the lowest outside the Mission. It's kind of unbelievable.

On the top of the lineup is poor burstage abatement, rupturing the burrito half-way through. This may have been caused by the next fool in the batting order, well-sauced, although tough and salty Chile Verde pork, which was inconsistently spread throughout. Veggies were under-represented as well, with avocado showing up for its role late in the game. Its attendance though was better then spice, because my requests for \"extra-spicy with Jalapenos\" were apparently ignored. \n\nWhat does this leave us with? The 2006 Giants: carried by a couple of strong players (am I the only one who remembers Jason Schmidt?), but otherwise strictly mediocre, and riding on a legacy of unrealized greatness.

I've heard a couple of good things about this place so why not?  My rule is that I only give burrito places one chance to impress me.  The verdict here: Won't be stopping in unless I'm totally desperate for burritos and I have no way to transport myself to another part of town.\n\nOrdered the Expresso Burrito with grilled steak.  Looked appealing in its to-go box but noticed it was poorly wrapped as I started cutting into it.  They say there is guacamole.  Was it that green gloopy liquid (that tasted like nothing) I saw hidden underneath the sauce?   Must've been it.  Some pieces of the steak were too chewy for my taste and I would appreciate if they ask what beans I would like.  The burrito isn't as packed to the brim with filling/ingredients as the burritos I've had elsewhere.  The rice, beans, meat, and the whole shebang just kind of sprinkled out whereas it would be pouring out like a mad flood of deliciousness at other places.  Overall, the burrito just did not hit the spot.  Sad to say.\n\nService has much to be desired for.  I know this isn't even a restaurant but the lady taking orders could have refrained from resting her head on her hands while she was taking orders like she was really annoyed.  (Or maybe she was just having a rough day or something.  I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.)  But seriously, the wait for the food took a while.

I only live down the street but I am in the middle of studying for a big test coming up and don't want to leave my house (yes laziness at its finest).  The guy answered the phone and was hesitant about even taking the delivery order, but continued to ask me what I wanted so I told him the cabo taco and a torta, they were out of tortas so I had to choose something else. SO I mentioned that  I want a burrito and start to say what I want in it.... So I say spanish rice (there is a long pause between us because I was waiting for confirmation that he got that I wanted that type of ice, as it is loud over on his end of the phone line) and then he goes which burrito (with attitude) and I respond with well I am trying to tell you what I want in it, he continues with \"you know what can you just call me back when you know what you want\". I reply with well I told you what I wanted and you don't have what I want so now I have to order something else, he sighs and then I just respond with you know what if you are going to act like that then I won't order.\n\nUnfortunately I hung up on him, but I can't stand when people act like they hate their job over the phone, his voice dragged on and was very hesitant to take my order when I asked for delivery. If you are busy and understaffed and can't deliver just say that, don't give customers attitude over the phone. You just lost customers El burrito express.

We had actually planned on redeeming one from last time, so now when we come back next time, we can use this free offer.\n\nYou go up to the counter to order and when your order is ready, they will call out your number. There is a flat screen T.V for enjoyment while waiting on your food. The wait wasn't too long and with a purchase, there is chips and salsa. I enjoyed the Chili Colorado, but it was a bit spicy.

Need to ask for condiments like napkins and hot sauce. There's only room for 5-7 people inside.\n\nThe Bad: The burro's are messy and made with too thin tortillas.\n\nI've eaten at a lot of Burro places, I've eaten in worse places, this place is alright, it wasn't the best I've eaten.\n\nI think a 3.5 Stars is right in line with this place.

El Burrito Express is currently my burrito place of choice when I'm in the mood for a burrito in the Sunset.  This little hole in the wall is by far not close to being the best I've had, but its good.  It gives a fresh taste to the area, since the Sunset district in San Francisco is dominated by many Asian restaurants.  I can say with confidence it's one of the best burritos you can get in this neighborhood.\n\nThe location isn't a sit down experience rather an order and go type of place.  There is a row of stationary stools for you to sit if you do decide to eat there.  Along the row of stools there's one flat screen television.  Watch your first step when you enter because there's a little slope and if you're clumsy and run into things a lot like me.   \n\nI usually get the carne asada super burrito.  On occasions, I'll get their wet burrito, \"expresso\", or a taco salad.  I have tried the nachos once.  They offer a nice variety of choices as well as having a couple vegetarian burritos as well.  A must if you're going to operate a restaurant in San Francisco.  The Cancun (shrimp) and Veracruz (fish) burritos look appetizing, but I haven't gotten myself to try it yet.  Something I don't see much that they have on the menu is chili relleno and chili colorado as an option in your burrito.  Whatever burrito you get I'm sure you'll be satisfied.  \n\nAt $5.75 for a super burrito, I think that's a really good deal.  Just think you'll be basically paying the same thing at Chipotle. I like Chipotle, but if given a choice.  I'd definitely take this instead.  Not to mention, they are a really good size.  For the budget watchers out there, I'd stick with the burritos, because they're the best deal.  Their nachos are good also, but I'd rather spend that $8.00 for another meal.

I'm writing this review to draw attention to the sad fact that this place is horribly, comically mis-branded.  There is nothing \"express\" about it.  When I come here in the evenings I just sit quietly and wait for my burrito like everyone else.  I realize that when there's a line one has to wait, and the wait is worth it.  However, this morning I called ahead to order a breakfast burrito.  I told the person on the phone what I wanted, and she said \"ok it will be ready in 25-35 minutes.\" \"I'm sorry?  Did you just say its going to take half an hour to make a burrito?\" \"Yes, we just opened and we haven't done anything yet.\"  This was at 10:10am, 10 minutes after they opened.  Here's a novel idea: kitchen prep!  In most restaurants the kitchen staff arrives early and gets the kitchen ready to do amazing things like serving food to people when the restaurant opens.  I know you might be thinking \"Oh, this was probably a one time occurrence.\"  Guess what, the only other time I've ordered a breakfast burrito here, it took them about 20-25 minutes to actually produce the thing.

This is my burrito place in the SF area.\n\nMy only gripe is their stinginess on salsa. This is a problem only if you like pouring lots of salsa in your burrito as I do. They only have \"red\" and \"green\" salsa pre-packaged in those little black plastic cups with clear lids all Mexican joints have seemed to agreed to use, and they give you a dirty look when you ask for more than the allotted quota (2 per burrito). On one occasion, one of the ladies working there said I couldn't have 3 green and 2 red and when I offered to pay for them, she sighed, pursed her lips, and scrunched her eyebrows as the put requested amount of salsa in bag. Straight up mean. It must cost pennies per cup for them to make this salsa and there really isn't a reason to go all Oliver Twist on me in the first place.\n\nAside from their salsa Nazism, the burritos are great and don't let my complaint stop you from eating here.

My Better Half is a SF native and loves burritos ( I'm more of a taco girl myself),  so though he bemoans the loss of tacos just as loudly as I do, he has something to calm his hungry belly since SF is burrito territory. Well,  thank heavens for El Burrito Express 1!!! Not only are they tasty, but in my neighborhood!!!\n\nOk, now it has to be said UP FRONT: this is not LA quality tacos. There are taco trucks in LA that will make you WEEP with joy. BUT El Burrito Express has some killer steak. I'd almost venture to say better than some taco trucks in LA. Their lack of Al Pastor is disturbing, but I forgive in the face of high quality steak. The Taquitos (2 corn tortillas, meat, cilantro, lime) are the same size and idea as the LA taco truck taco which means I can wolf down about 4 of them, suck down a Mexican Coke and call it a day. Added bonus is they give you chips and salsa (I'm a light weight, green all the way, baby!). The big downer is CASH ONLY. \n\nBurritos look tasty, but I'm hooked on their taquitos and they will hold me until I get my Al Pastor fix in LA. Did I mention that they deliver? Oh sweet, sweet laziness! I dig it.", "author": "Meghan R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-11-07", "description": "I've definitely had El Burrito Express over thirty times (probably even more than that) in my life and I have such mixed reviews that a three is probably the most fair rating I can give it. \n\nLiving in the Sunset, your food choices (especially Mexican food) are limited. Sure if you want to eat any type of Asian food every day for the rest of your life you're set, but my family orders from here often enough that I've had some huge hit or miss dinners. I'll try to break it down into the good and the bad:\n\nThe Good:\n- The burritos here are huge. If you eat one of their burritos and tortilla chips (I'll comment on these later) you'll be absolutely stuffed. And if you're not, then I'm guessing you can't see the scale below your belly...\n- The selection of chicken/rice/beans is pretty solid. \n- The food is reasonably priced. When I get dinner for my family of four the total is usually hovering around $25.00-$28.00\n\nThe Bad:\n- Parking and the waits in line can be the biggest pain in the ass. If it isn't enough that MUNI runs along Taravel and there's never any parking, the neighbors here are assholes. I literally double parked (not blocking a driveway or anything) to pick up something for FIVE MINUTES and a lady was getting ready to write a note on my car. Too bad she's one of those all-talk bitchy old women that cower when confronted.\n- When they mess up your order, they really mess it up. There's a huge taste difference between the grilled chicken (tastes HORRIBLE here) and regular shredded chicken. \n- The free tortilla chips are sometimes stale as hell. They literally sit near the counter and I'm sure some are past their expiration date. But when they're fresh they taste fine.\n\nSo all and all, this place is pretty good. Just make sure you order ahead and if you're picking up make sure you're quick. I can understand as a neighbor it would be annoying to have cars double parked but obviously they didn't think ahead when they moved there. \n\nIf you're going in by foot there can sometimes be long waits. It's crowded inside too (very little space) so sometimes you might be a little too close for comfort with the people around you. However, the food is good enough to keep coming back. I would give this place a shot if you're in the area.", "author": "Sean B."}

But not in this case. Oh my god. I'm still reeling from the horrifying burrito I had last night.\n\nWe went in there right before they closed and they were awesome to serve us. Typically, this is a bad call too, to order right before a restaurant is closing, which is why I'm stating it up front. Always a little nervous that employees want to go the hell home and you are getting the scraps leftover they are about to toss or that have been sitting around. But this place is crazy busy in the evening so I doubt that things sit around.\n\nI ordered a Super Carnitas Burrito. Pretty standard. But oh so gross. It was flimsy, not wrapped tight and wet. This was not a wet burrito I ordered, people. The meat was wet. Not moist like oh-so-good moist/ wet. Just wet. It was really gross. And I ate it. Cuz I was hungry. And now I feel gross.\n\nThe chips were great! And thank you for serving us when you were about to close. And the Celtics were on which we wanted to watch but couldn't stick around but that's cool. And we got our food VERY fast, which is also good. But man, a woman needs her sustenance and this was not yummy at all.....except for the chips which technically are coming with the burrito so all that adds up to about one star.

Mind you, there is not much competition in this district but I don't cut slack just because this isn't the Latino part of town. These prices can't be found in the more trendy districts ($5-6 here versus $8-9) and these ladies know how to cook!\n\nI prefer the El Macho burrito. It's $9.50, comes with two meat choices, and is almost 2 feet long. Mind you, I cut it in half because it's essentially the size of two of their $5.50 burritos and it's a better value that way too.\n\nMeats: Great chile verde, the pork was tender and it tasted authentic; the grilled chicken was also a standout favorite for me. I would only caution those who prefer carne asada, as depending when you go there you might end up getting some shoveled on from their hot prep area and I've had it slightly dry.\n\nIn terms of authenticity, the flavors shine through. Although they only have a red and green salsa, both are well spiced but make sure to ask for them as they don't have a big enough storefront to have a salsa bar.\n\nI speak from experience when I say, avoid the Judah and 45th(ish) Mexican spot. I know it's bigger, but it is not worth sacrificing flavor for ambiance. Make the trip to Taraval.", "author": "Name R."}

The food here has always been affordable compared to most Mexican places. Of course prices have gone up over the years but they are still affordable in comparison.  I like the fact that they fry their own chips and hard taco shells which is a big plus not like other places with the pre-bought ones! They cook their items fresh daily. I have tried some other places where the meat just have an odd taste ( not sure if the oil being reused) but the food taste fresh here and you see them cook it. They include chips with every order and you can ask for red or green hot sauce or both. They do not have a salsa bar but I feel it is not needed.  They are fast, and I have no problems with their customer service and find them very friendly and accommodating.

So, I usually call ahead.  But I'm done with this place.  I called the other night on my way home and was immediately put on hold.  Which just meant she put the phone down on the counter.  I waited as I watched the counter on my phone.  Finally, after listening to her take a couple of orders and then laughing and having good time, I started yelling into the phone hoping someone would hear me.  After 10 minutes, the phone was hung up.  Since I was close, I stopped in and asked what had happened.  I showed her my phone which showed I had been on the phone for 10 minutes, and did I get an apology, no.  She looked at me and said they must have been busy and then looked for the phone.  It was gone!  So I asked to speak to the manager and she took my name number and said he would call me the next day.  No call.  Nada.  Service is not a priority here.  If you have 20-30 minutes to waste, then by all means, go ahead and stop in.  Otherwise, find some place that values more than just your $!", "author": "Dan D."}

Shimmery like the side of a glistening fish in the afternoon light, with beautiful pink and green hues, both times (yes I went back for more, I believe in 2nd chances) the meat was not fresh.\n\nEverything else I've had has been good, the chips are fried on the spot, really bad for you, which means they taste great.

They have a wide variety of burritos to choose from, ranging from the typical flour tortilla filled with rice, beans, meat, cheese, guacamole, and fresh pico de gallo, to various vegetarian and seafood combinations.  They also have specialty burritos such as a breakfast burrito, one filled with homemade chile relleno, and another which they call El Macho Burrito which has two giant flour tortillas stuffed with two meats, rice, beans, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, tomato, and onion AND measures over a foot long!\n\nMy favorite is the Shredded Chicken El Expresso Burrito, which is served the wet style.  This is just not one of those burritos that is consumed by holding in your hand and slowly peeling away the foil as you chomp away.  No siree!  This huge, delicious work of art needs to be enjoyed on a plate or right out of the food container with a fork and knife!  This burrito is wrapped in a giant flour tortilla and filled with generous amounts of rice, beans, cheese, and your choice of meat.  Topped with guacamole, onions, tomatoes, and cheese, and finally covered with their special expresso sauce that provides just enough kick, this is really a gift from heaven!  I did without the dollop of sour cream to be a little more heart healthy . . . but at this point does it really matter!  This is one plump, tasty burrito that literally measures 10\" X 4\" and is good for 2-3 meals.  For a little less than $7, what a great bargain!!!\n\nTheir chips are also delicious!  Very fresh and crisp, not too salty, and just the right thickness.  You know they're really fresh when you don't have that greasy aftertaste after munching on them.  You can really taste the true corn flavor.\n\nThe place is rather small and does not have tables, only a few stools at the counter by the window, so it's best for take out.

Perfectly cooked chicken, the beans perfect, nice warm tortillas, and the guacamole is amazing.\n\nBeen eating at this spot since high school and the ownership has to be some of the nicest folks I've come across.

The burritos come with complimentary chips too.  The chips are horrible.\n\nI ordered the regular chicken burrito.  Like Susan Y., I thought the chicken would be grilled.  Instead, it's shredded and stewed in a red sauce.  I prefer grilled chicken because it has that charred taste.  Stewed chicken tends to be too dry (like this one) and makes your burrito too soupy inside.  \n\nStill, it tasted good though it was soupier than I like.  They put some guacamole (not much, but guac is usually an extra at most taquerias) in the regular burrito, which is a nice touch.  It also comes with rice and beans.  \n\nThere isn't much seating (no tables, there are some chairs though) and there isn't much room to stand in line (explaining why there is usually a line out the door).  You order at the register.\n\nThe other major downside is that they do not have a fresh salsa bar.  You have to ask for containers of salsa.  Their salsas were okay...not much choice there.\n\nThey don't have that many choices when it comes to the meat for your regular burrito (stewed chicken, carnitas, steak and maybe something else).  I don't mind that but if you don't offer many choices, you'd better make the ones you have count - it better be the best chicken I've ever had.

Most burritos come with real guacamole, sour cream, cheese (all the good stuff). And they're big enough for two meals (if you try it in one, you'll be in food coma for at least 4 hours...) .I'm not a fan of the chopped pork, chicken or steak, it can get dry. The chips are good, salty and crunchy. The salsas they offer are kind of weak too, but they'll give you whatever you ask for. Salsas are a thin red one or a thin salsa verde. They'll switch out the types of beans (black, pot, etc.) for no extra charge. From what I can tell they only use white flour tortillas for burritos.\n\nIt's awkward ordering and picking up your order because there's a two foot counter space right by the door where it all goes down. And the floor is significantly slanted (down towards the counter). The only seating is some torn, patched with tape, leopard-print barstools along a cracked counter facing outside. The trash receptacle inside is just an open bin. The place does amazing burritos, and does them very well, but lacks ambience or any sense of security while eating.

El Burrito is a Sunset establishment that has been around for at least two decades. A recent visit showed little had changed since my days as a regular back in the early 90s. Its hard to go wrong with its menu of time-tested items--regular Burritos, super Burritos, Bronco Burritos and Expresso Burritos.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the burritos are less than six dollars. My personal favorite is the chicken Expresso Burrito. A well proportioned burrito made out of a giant tortilla topped with sauce and cheese and stuffed with chicken, rice, beens, guacamole, tomatoes, onions and possibly a few other things that I'm forgetting. The Expresso Burrito must be eaten with a knife and fork off a plate and cannot be held in the hand. But whether you have the expresso or just a regular burrito you won't be disappointed.

Yeah, the foodies will tell you about the same old places \"hidden\" in the Mission, like Tacqueria Cancun for instance, but I think I'm being generous when I describe the average SF greasy burrito as \"satisfactory\".  \n\nI have yet to find anything in SF that even approaches the twin terrors of Humberto's (fish burrito) and La Campana (shrimp) on opposite corners of 25th and Broadway in San Diego.  El Burrito Express on Taraval is probably the closest I've come.  Like any true burrito dive, unneccessary amenities, like tables, \"silver\"ware and restrooms have been dispensed with.  So much the better for efficient delivery of the maximum tortilla-to-grease ratio possible.  The cash register sits tightly sandwiched between the entrance and the burrito construction station.  They will usually give you a small bag of chips with your order.  You can buy some sodas by the can or perhaps an aguas fresca to wash it all down.

The Expresso, Bronco, and Super Bronco sizes scare me -- they're ginormous but very popular to those that can handle it.

All for about $4 with chips. Ok, the chips are a little tough and yes, you do have to ask for hot sauce... but you come here for the burritos. Oh, and the regular size keeps well overnight in the fridge and reheats nicely in the microwave the next day (not soggy).

At first I thought... Ok, it's another burrito place. I was so wrong, and I see why it's so popular. Bf also said that each time he's went in, it was packed with people. So I'll be honest...I haven't actually been inside EBX. Bf has always gotten food to go since we're just a short walking distance away. Omg, in less than a month, we've probably gotten take out from them at least four times! Crazy right? Their food is so addictingly (I know it's not a real word) good! I absolutely Love their guacamole. It's rich, chunky with flavor, and it has a great combination of tomatoes and seasonings. I've never loved guacamole since Maya closed down on 2nd Street, but EBX has come very close to match them with their guacamole. I've tried tostadas (once with shrimp and another with carne asada) and unlike other taquerias, EBX provides two plate fulls of food. The tostada itself comes in one plate, and the beans, rice and slaw in another. I feast on such a small order. On one occasion, bf ordered the chile relleno on top of his enchilada order. We were so shocked to see how huge the chile relleno was. It was a meal in itself. I've also gotten their super burrito, which is a yummy, wet goodness wrapped in a large tortilla, covered in red sauce and topped with melted cheese. Talk about instant food coma! Another thing to note is how large their portions are for the price. It's such a steal.

Big Burrito, juicy, lots of filling, great quality of meat. Well, I stop coming to this place for sometime now and El Faro in South San Francisco took it's place. I will tell you why.\n\nFirst of all, I use to come here often cause it's cheap, great burrito, GIGANTIC FILLING, and close to where I work ( convenience ). I always pick-up the same stuff after work 4 Steak Burrito Express w/black-eyed beans with everything:  extra cheese, guacamole, and sour cream,That's the routine. I use to come here like at least once a week or once every two weeks  (everytime the cravings starts \"kicking in\" ). That's Our Dinner.  My family used to LOVE their Burrrito - ( the first time ) but after a while of coming here, Things have changed in a bad way.\n\n- First, there's more Tortilla your eating rather than the meat,rice, beans, guacamole, cheese, or sour cream. If You LOVE eating PLAIN TORTILLA  then, this Burrito is for you. \n- Second, The Steak in the Burrito are very tough and chewy and it seems like I wasn't given the best Quality meat - given that it's called \"Grilled Steak Meat.\"\n- Third, I always Gladly \"PAY EXTRA\" for guacomole, beans, cheese, and sour cream. BUT the thing is it  doesn't even show and taste like I PAID EXTRA for this. I might as well not pay extra cause it doesn't show and doesn't taste like I did.\n- Fourth, is I noticed ( this happened like 4 X or even more around 4:45 pm)  that everytime I ordered my 4 Burritos,and when they finished making the Burritos. The  Two Ladies that would be making it would sit down right away - scoop some of the food that they are selling like rice, beans or meat etc. etc. in their own plate then sit down in the corner and eat away???? Now, these makes me think, Is these the reason they are giving me less FILLING in my Burrito??? Saving The Best Part of Meat and my Extra Cheese, Gucamole, Rice, Beans, and Best Kind of Meat in their \"OWN PLATE\" \n\nEvery-one has the right to take a Break and Eat. And I am sure  those Ladies deserve them. But it just makes me think about these all the time. After I get home and we started eating and my Family is so Disappointed in the Quality of food like the Meat - dry, chewy and tough, Less: Rice, Beans, Guacamole, Cheese and Sour Cream   (while I even \"PAID EXTRA FOR THIS\" ). It got so bad that my family \"MADE ME PROMISED\" not to come there anymore cause it's not worth it. Which I never did anymore. I gave this place so many chances cause I thought of the very first time I tasted their Burrito would come back and not just be a memory of THAT WAS THEN AND THIS IS \"NOW\" Kind of Thing.\n\nI don't know what happen, maybe I was ordering too much like 4 Burritos with everything,  at once??? The employees  are trying to save some FILLINGS for the other Customers - so it will last the whole day???? I don't know what happen??

I only found out about the free burrito card when I asked for their business card.\n\nThe chips are fried on site -- I've seen them make them in the fryer so I don't know why one commenter said they were expired. \n\nBad thing is that they're closed at 9 pm and only take cash.

Anyways, i'ts so good I chose it as the last meal I'd want to eat if I had a last meal.  Only problem with the super cheese is that it doesn't come with guacamole.

Hey, if I want express, I am heading to a real Taco Bell, not  the  KFC & Taco Bell combo. The real Taco Bell tends to be clean, clean, clean, with the employees washing (in clear view) their hands frequently. Where if one is working with money, they are not touching the food. Yep, I am proud to be a cleanaphobe. OOOPs, I am in the midst of writing about El Burrito and not  Taco Bell...After several years, one of my kids told me that they had tostadas. Who knew?! That said, I had to see if they came close to being real.  They are real and they are damned good. For under $2.00 I get the avocado tostada with extra sauce. Yummy :) \n\nThis place lacks a few things, aside from the fact that there is absolutely no parking. First, it could use a real good cleaning. I try not to look around. Fear is that I might see something. In fact, I haven't even checked their health dept. score card.  Think that in this case, it may be better if I didn't know. Next, if this were my business,  I would hire someone who actually likes people. Someone who may even remember you after seeing you for more than a handful of times. I can usually get a smile out of anyone, with the goal being a bit of laugher, but a smile if all else fails. Not here. Being pleasant doesn't count. Big tips cause no emotion. I don't require a chirpy, upbeat soul, but a smile or a greeting just feels right. Maybe the two women who work the register just need to leave. One in particular can be extremely rude and difficult. \n\nCome for the tostadas. Head over to La Playa Tacqueria if you want a better dish. There you can enjoy a mango or chipotle salsa. They have no problem customizing your order. Do not try to customize here. Not unless you want an even longer scowl than the one she is already wearing. Plus, La Playa is just 2 blocks from the beach.\n\nThe owner is very nice, but I think that she has just let it go.

You can get a huge burrito and some chips for about  6-7 dollars, thats the super burrito and thats one of the bigger ones, you can always go smaller and what not and it'll cost you round 4-5 dollars...The meats at this place is really good, the vegies as fresh as it gets and as they prepare it in front of you nothing can go wrong!

As I wasn't eating meat at the time, the \"super cheese with hot sauce\" was basically what I would order every time. For a place to deliver a veggie burrito with so much flavor that you don't miss the meat is pretty amazing. They also didn't throw anything excessive in there...beans, rice, (tons of) cheese, hot sauce and maybe some cilantro if I was in the mood, all on a grilled tortilla. I really miss having easy access to this place now that I live in the East Bay. Don't get me wrong, I've eaten at tons of burrito places in both SF and the East Bay, but El Burrito Expess is hands down the best burrito I've had flavor wise. Now that I'm eating meat again I'll have to go back and try some of their meats, but knowing me I'll probably just order my old favorite. I love this place!", "author": "Jeff G."}

Growing up in the Mission, it took me a while to warm up to this place... I knew it was very popular but I summed it up to location (not much competition in this neck of the woods) and clientele (mostly gringo and asian) Honestly, after my first few tries, I just wasn't reeled in. But, as I worked my way through the menu, I began to love the place!  Some offers are wonderful and others just okay to me ( palate is kinda relative). Well, once I found what I liked, I was in taqueria heaven!  Sadly, I have found that since introducing the option of delivery, the wait time has increased by quite a bit but more importantly the end product can be very inconsistent.  Sometimes orders are missing key ingredients or have the wrong ingredients...  I do want to finish on a high note because I still find that this taqueria exceeds most others in S.F...  I really admire their efforts in trying new ideas and offering a very unique menu while showing consideration to the Vegan & Vegetarian community!  At other taquerias, if you want a veggie burrito, you simply get a meat burrito sans meet with maybe some extra lettuce (weak!).  Where as \"El Burrito Express\" has many options including sauteed veggies, cabbage, avocado soft tacos and more!  \"Viva El Burrito Express!...\"  keeping it real in the Sunset for Mucho anos and I hope for Mucho Mas...  excuse the Spanglish...", "author": "Joseph A."}

I don't remember exactly how I felt about the burritos but I know they must have been pretty mediocre because I never went back again until recently. My bf had the same feelings about this place for years until he recently heard they were way better now so he went one day to end his skepticism. He came back telling me that his burrito was indeed very good. I was kinda upset that he did not save me a bite but soon I was able to try it for myself. We both went there at about dinner time so there was a line already. It was about a 5 min wait which is nothing to complain about. For under $5 each we each got a pork burrito and they were decently sized. They even give free chips! I saw they have a frequent stamp card so I asked for one knowing we'd probably be back. They were also advertising their horchata which I'm curious to try perhaps next time. We waited until we got home to eat our burritos. I was disappointed at first  thinking maybe I should have gotten steak or chicken instead because upon first bite my pork was too hard like it had been cooked for too long. The pork of the top portion of my burrito was like that (the bf's too) but when I got deeper into the burrito the pork was so tender and juicy and amazingly good. It's one of the best burritos I've ever had gooood. I'm willing to go back again with hope that the pork will be perfect next time! They've certainly either changed owners or just improved their food. Either way I'm glad we now have a good burrito place we can go to nearby.", "author": "Helen L."}

Apparently, the wrong ingredients were put on the tortilla so the preparer, who was not wearing gloves, used his fingers to scrape off the ingredients back into the receptacles.  Not very sanitary.\nDespite a sign hanging over the cashier that wheat tortillas were included in the price, I was charged an additional amount for the wheat.  When I brought this to the cashier's attention, after paying, she stated she was told to charge extra despite the sign and would not give a refund.  She stated I should contact management  to complain via a link on the website but, of course, there is no link.  While the amount was only 30 cents per burrito, there is the principle of being honest with your customers.  Additionally, the receipt shows the 30 cents listed as \"trigo\".\nNot speaking Spanish, I had no idea what this meant and had to ask.  What is the purpose, other than trying to fool people, of a S.F. business printing a purchase in Spanish?\nOne more thing....they are not fast in getting out food so expect a wait.", "author": "Steve K."}

The burritos are pretty good, but not the greatest things youve ever tasted. The quesadillas are also good but I wouldnt veer too far off of those items as the quality in tacos and taquitos drops off significantly. All in all, El Burrito is quick, easy, and filling and in the end, relatively satisfying. 3.5 stars", "author": "Kerry C."}

It's really a toss up between el burrito and taqueria cancun.

So between running errands in the Inner Richmond and West Portal last night, I trekked way out here just to grab a the shrimp and veggie burrito my roommate told me about. As I stopped at every darn four-way intersection on the 20-block detour to my next errand I cursed to myself that it better be worth it. It was. These are burritos I'd drive across a bridge for, forget just across town. They have some unusual options on the specials board, which is where I found the shrimp one full of fresh avocado, mixed veggies (zucchini, onions, peppers, potatoes, etc.), rice, beans, spicy salsa and cheese. The shrimp were high-quality and in a very flavorful sauce. Can't wait to try the other options too... they had a snapper and black bean burrito that sounded really good and on the healthy side (nice to have options other than greasy meat with cheese and sour cream).", "author": "Shoshana D."}

After 3 hours of basketball and the expenditure of glycogen levels with your body starving for carbohydrates, your body yearns for a fattie burrito.  This place screams value.  You get your nutrients replenished with a median price of 5 bucks.  This place, however, does warrant a drive thru.  Master double parkers are good at blocking cars out front to run inside to grab a burrito, but beware of sneaky meter maids.  The meter maids in the Taraval area are perhaps the most clever swindlers in the city (with exception to the sneaky ones down in the financial district).   The key is to bring a burrito accomplice to monitor the car while one is inside ordering the \"Bronco\" Burrito.  I don't know how they derived this term, but even a \"Raider\" fan like myself can like a \"Bronco\" every now and then.  It's the only \"Bronco\" I've ever liked.", "author": "Rex J."}
