Love that it's free (although please donate!) and there's ample free parking in their lot.\n\nThe train exhibit and the earthquake exhibit with Legos were my son's favorites. The petting zoo was a little limited. We were there during the animals' nap time, so no petting was allowed. The raccoon was also napping (presumably despite living in a museum, he/she'd still be nocturnal). But my son still loved seeing the animals, even if he couldn't touch them.\n\nThis place is great for younger kids.

I was disappointed at this time. \nI bought tickets, and my kids played paid games.  \nWe made magic won from stick at the art studio.\nIt was two tickets for 1 stick, which worth $1 each. \nAs it was att studio kids need to do art by themselves. So this studio had 3-4 employees or volunteers, and they were giving art supplies by only one for each child, and it was so uncomfortable. Because kids  were need to go each time to those people. Even those supplies were so chip materials and employees didn't want to give art supplies to kids. \nEventually my second child found from ground sparkle tiny ball, and one of the workers were so unhappy that my child had 2 balls. He start asking again and again where my son got that. But he kept asking, I felt so bad, to be honest I never saw this kind of environment before. I paid, and I felt so bad. I never will go again to this museum, because of their employees or volunteers.

I lamented my little boy missing the museum's sweet spot appealing to toddler/preschool and early elementary school children.\n\nThe good news is the wait was entirely worth it: The Randall Museum is not only beautiful and airy but much more inclusive of children of all ages and there are plans for offerings for older teens, too.\n\nReopening just a few weeks ago on February 11, you won't believe your eyes when you walk in. It's a completely different space and it's beautiful.\n\nUnbelievably, they didn't add an additional building or wing; they just opened up the interior that apparently had a lot of under/unused areas and lots of cluttered storage. \n\nNow when you walk in, you're treated to a light-filled, airy lobby off which is a huge, glass-walled and natural wood-framed space housing California wildlife. Most of these creatures will live happily here at Randall since they were injured in the wild or raised as pets and unable to fend for themselves out of captivity. \n\nThere are informative placards that give you more detail on native wildlife and docents and staff carefully showing visitors a close-up look at the animals and answering questions.\n\nSeveral glass-walled classrooms on the first and lower floors house Parks & Rec classes ranging from ceramics and painting to coding and building robotics. There's a beautiful, architecturally award-winning theatre and a sweet playroom for toddlers and young children to age 4.\n\nDownstairs there are more exhibits of ocean wildlife and interactive displays detailing earthquake faultlines, a computer station for children and a Lego play area.\n\nOutside there are spectacular views of the city from every angle carefully fenced from the steep hillside below. Wood benches all around the old growth shade trees and lush lawn beckon you to stretch out or read a book. \n\nHiking paths including a moderate summit to adjacent Corona Heights Park encompass this lovely spot in the heart of the city, nestled between the Haight/Buena Vista and Corona Heights/Upper Market.\n\nFree museum entry and a moderately sized parking lot make it convenient and accessible to everyone.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-02", "description": "Randall Museum is a nature museum and activity center located next to Corona Heights Park   The museum was named after Josephine Randall, who was San Francisco's first Superintendent of Recreation.  The museum opened in 1951.  For finding the location, perhaps the route that is easiest location to remember, is to drive southwards along Market Street until you reach this street's bend in the Castro District, and then at the bend, make a sharp turn to the west and drive up 17th Street.   17th Street in this location takes the form of a very steep hill, and within a minute one encounters a small sign reading \"Randall Museum,\" and you turn at this small sign.\n\nATTRACTIONS.  The parking area has a park-like environment, and it provides a bird's eye view of the landscape to the east.  Once inside, one is drawn to a room containing housings for ravens, crows, chickens, quails, snakes, and rabbits.  During my visit, the door to the crow and raven cage was left open for a spell, and one of the crows decided to fly about the room.  Eventually, when closing time for the museum was drawing near, one of the museum workers went after the crow with a butterfly net.  The net was not intended for catching the raven, but instead for persuading the raven to go back to its cage.  The crow willingly went back into its cage, and rejoined its buddies.   Also, I spent 10 minutes watching the quails. I noticed two types of quails, one type with a beautiful large black plume on top of its head and with a white semicircle going from eye-to-eye.  The other type had a very tiny plume, shaped like a little black stick, where this type of quail did not have any white semicircle on its face.  I was captivated by the activities of the various animals in this room and any adult or child spending an hour in the animal room will be left with enough pleasant memories to write a few pages in their diary.\n\nCROWS AND RAVENS.  My own neighborhood on Alameda Island has many crows.  It is impressive how these birds assemble on telephone wires or in trees, and then swoop over nearby homes and re-assemble elsewhere nearby. These observations inspired me to spend 15 minutes in Randall Museum watching a raven (the size of a rabbit) and a few crows.  A sign teaches that ravens are CORVUX CORAX and crows are CORVUS BRACHYRHYNCHOS.  I was unable to see any differences, except that the raven was much larger than the crows, but the sign states that crows go, \"Caw, caw, caw\" while ravens make different sounds and sometimes imitate sounds that they hear.  I noticed that the upper part of the beaks of ravens and crows are curved like an upside-down canoe with a sort of hump at the half-way point, while the lower part of the beaks are curved like an upside-down canoe but without any hump.  I noticed that, for one of the crows, the tips of the upper and lower part of the beaks were not aligned with each other, where the tip of the top parts were offset.\n\nSCIENCE FAIR.  My mission was to serve as one of the 15 judges for the 2018 Science Fair, where judging was on Feb. 27, 2018 and on March 1, 2018.  For the first night, we judged the exhibits and for the second night, we interviewed the students.  The exhibits included a project involving crossing fruit flies that were normal with fruit flies with genetic mutations, and detecting which mutations were inherited by the baby fruit flies (after hatching from the larvae).  During my interview with the student, I was impressed by her ability to describe her experiment.  She mentioned that her dad was grossed out by the larvae. This comment indicated something important about the student, namely that she independently did the work herself, and that the father did not do the work.  For one of the other projects, I was impressed that the student was as articulate as a tenured college professor. Her project was storing seeds at room temp. versus at below freezing. I was stunned and awestruck by this student's genius-level ability to answer my science questions. Another student who was skilled at answering questions on science methodology, had a project on removing germs by sanitizer (no rinse) versus soap (+ water rinse).  We discussed the variable of a dog licking his mom's hand, before taking a swab to get a sample from the mom's hand, and we discussed the concept of a data \"outlier.\" The most creative and detailed of the science fair projects involved exposing human subjects to various kinds of food, or mixtures of foods blended together, where the human subject was required to identify the flavors with the nose blocked (with nose plug, thus preventing smelling) or with the nose unplugged and able to detect the odor of the food.  Another project, which stimulated a discussion of a follow-up project, involved monitoring wanderings of two different packs of wolves in Minnesota. We discussed the concept of monitoring wanderings of the animals that these wolves hunt (in other words, do the wolves follow their food supply?).", "author": "Tom B."}

It's so peaceful just to sit up there and stare at the city! \n\nThe museum itself is a true undiscovered gem, and just writing this review makes me cringe--I don't want too many people to take away the specialness of the site, but more people should definitely know about it! \n\nWhen it came time to plan our wedding, we debated between the Museum, the Film Center in the Presidio, and a space up in Marin, but the Museum won our hearts. We love living here in the city and felt that the Museum expressed all that we love in a nutshell. \n\nOur entire wedding was outdoors on a lovely Sunday afternoon. The ceremony faced south, and I felt so relaxed as my fiance (now husband) and I stood below the giant, billowing trees. We had cocktails, passed apps, and lunch on the southern part of the lawn, and we also opened up the animal room for our guests. \n\nYour fee to the Museum is mainly for the space. You pay extra for any exhibits you want open (We had the animal room open, and everyone loved it. In fact, the first thing I did after proceeding out of the ceremony was pet a bunny!), and you (or your wedding planner) coordinate everything from caterer to rentals to musicians. I used a caterer who had worked several RM weddings (jenniferlunch), and she really helped manage the day-of tasks, which was incredibly helpful. \n\nIf you decide to rent the Randall Museum, you'll have a lovely event. Really. Just be prepared for some quirks like a potentially dusty prep space (I brought clean sheets to cover anything that I didn't want to get dirty during the prep phase!). And I rented a standing mirror (about $26) to do my makeup and get ready. There was also a rehearsal in the theater, but this didn't affect us.

The museum houses various species of California-native animals (mostly birds and reptiles) that have been permanently injured and can no longer survive in its native habitat, or they have been domesticated having been raised by people and can longer mix with their own species.  \n\nFour such animals housed high above the room in an open space with their feet tethered to keep them from flying away are an adorable Saw-Whet Owl (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N9bEFoatbzaXjPHfbbUH4w?select=nBnDDETrne4vq8MZtpRuYg) about the size of an adult fist that is unable to grow flight feathers on its right wing.

Yup, we were done in an hour. A lot of the exhibits were either not working, had missing species in them (5 yr old asked to see the carnivorous plants but I was embarrassed to show her that they were dried up) or closed to visitors due to a summer camp. \"Kid, come back when you're six!\"\n\nSo maybe I am a bit bitter that my kids aren't old enough yet to attend this summer camp nor other parent-child workshops. But, we are visitors who have come to see what this museum has to offer.\n\nRestless Earth? Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley, for me, had a better seismology exhibit. But that replica of a Refugee Shack was pretty neat! We did role-playing to demonstrate to our kids how life must have been like living like that- one squeaky bed, a heat-source that doubles as your cooking appliance, a portable wash-tub and potty, dim lanterns, a wooden trunk as your walk-in closet and an antique sewing machine (because everybody back then probably knew how to make their own clothes!)\n\nToddler Treehouse? Looks like Tarzan has abandoned it to be with Jane.  There were more things toddlers wanted to touch and see outside than here.  It was just really a sad space.\n\nRiding the Rails?  They got us fooled. First-off, the exhibit was pitch-black when we got there until another mom found the light switch.\nThen, we thought, that was it? A wooden replica of a caboose? And you could enjoy guiding model trains around railroad tracks IF you rent them first.  What a tease!  Next time, can I bring Thomas and Friends along?\n\nAnimal Exhibit?  Lindsay Wildlife Museum in Walnut Creek was more educational. But here, it's okay.  Up to three people can enter the hen pen to attempt to pet any of the chickens, rabbits, ducks or guinea pigs before they call it \"safe\" inside their safe house.  \n\nLook up to see the barn owl, horned owl and hawk. They will occasionally flap their wings but worry not because they are tied up to their spot.  Poor things. Their bio-clocks must be pretty screwed up. They have to work during visiting hours!\n\nThey have a beehive colony on display; a grey squirrel with ADHD;  and a cage of corvids- ravens, crows and magpies.

Except that day the election volunteer bastards didn't let me in because I was maybe thirty seconds late, at the most. Jerks.\n\nThe views from these free and democratic --yet subtly authoritarian-heights are spectacular. There's an interpretive sign which shows what the same panorama may have looked like in the 1700s, before Yelpers arrived on the scene and filled the city with those pointy red balloons which cast permanent shadows on the surrounding blocks. \n\nI don't know what the hell the museum is meant to be about, though. It's got something to do with things kids are supposed to like, but the parents are always wandering around with baffled expressions. \n\nI do know, however, that geocachers simply love the place. So if you see a bunch of kooks with GPS devices sticking their hands in raingutters, don't be a Muggle--leave them be.\n\nSad that the Bufano sculptures are gone...Does anyone know where they went?", "author": "Sean K."}

I brought my 8 and 9 year old nephew and niece up there to check it out once and am sad to report that the Randall Museum was not the super fun learning experience I thought it would be for them.\n\nOkay, how old are the model trains they've got there?  They're quickly deteriorating into train-shaped dust.  The best part is that while we were wandering around looking for the model train section, we passed hallways full of abandoned pieces of old museum exhibits.  I thought maybe we'd wandered into storage, but no, it was the hallway.\n\nThe animals in their petting zoo kept running away and hiding.  These little creatures do not want to be pet.  It should be called a no petting zoo.  Or a no thanks petting zoo.  As in, \"hey ducky, wanna be pet?\"  \"No thanks.\" \n\nThis museum is broken.  I really think it is.  Like, the whole place.  We would check out different parts of the museum and my niece and nephew would be like, \"Yay!  Check this out... huh?\"  A fatty piece of whatever they were looking at or touching would be missing or broken.  Their first instinct, being kids, was that they didn't want to be blamed for the broked-up thing, so they would just run off nervously.  \n\nRandall Museum gets 3 stars instead of 2 because it's free.  If you've got kids with you, they don't exactly appreciate the view, but props for the sweet location anyway.  Some rich people should donate loads of money to renovating the museum; they could do a lot more with it.\n\nOh, you have to pay for the crafts classes.  The lady that ran our $5 craft class was not friendly.  Actually, she was mean and barked impatiently at everyone.  No more crafts classes at the Randall for us.  Boo again.", "author": "Diana Y."}

That was New Years 2004, one month after I moved to San Francisco. This place has always seemed like a good place to take a date when you are feeling a bit frisky and want to show your special friend the amazing view. It is indeed a delicious panorama - it's one of the few 360 degree views in SF. From Twin Peaks, to downtown SF, to Oakland on the other side of the bay, to Bernal Heights, this is indeed one sexy place to stand and spin around. \n\nThe unfortunate thing is that it is usually so damn windy and cold that even with your hands grasping for warmth in someone else pants it inspires a non-extended stay. Maybe that's part of it's charm.  In the pursuit of memorable romantic experience, there's something that I've always found endearing and beautifully vivid about having a blustery wind whipping against my face, mussing my hair, turning my hands to ice, while my lips and hands are guaging their ability to find purchase. I must confess that I've kinda subsonsciously used this place as a litmus test to guage the adventurous-index of women that I've dated over the past few years.

I've never actually visited the museum during the day, but wandering through the darkened halls after closing time to get to and from my class makes me kind of wish I knew some small child I could bring there during the daytime to check out all the interesting exhibits (especially the live ones!). So anyway, I can only speak for my art class experience: fantastic. \n\nThe classes are not crowded, so rather than fight for the attention of the instructor (as I've had to do in adult ed classes elsewhere), it's really relaxed. Everyone seems to get as much personalized attention as they need- and the instruction is so straight forward and simple to understand that no one really seems to need a lot of help (also unlike other ceramics classes I've taken, where they instill the fear of a wrathful clay god in you before you even touch the stuff). I've never seen so many people have so little frustration while working on a pottery wheel for the first time. I'm taking a class with Andy, and I'm sure the other instructors are just as knowledgeable and easy to work with too.\n\nI'm shocked that this place didn't come up in my searches for \"ceramics classes San Francisco\" on google. But I'm glad that a friend turned me onto the Randall Museum- it seems to be a great San Francisco secret, and their class prices are comparable to other public ceramics studios. They offer other classes as well- I know there's a wood working class and some sort of adult orchestra class (we can hear them honking away on the tuba while we throw pots!).

But apparently no one knows that it is also the best wedding venue in San Francisco.  I know: I was married there, and we were the first.\n\nFor the price of a few hours of crappy venue space elsewhere, here's what you get at the Randall:\n\n- A huge outdoor space with a spectacular view of all of SF (room for over 200 guests outdoors, far more if you spread them out)\n- Access to the full museum complex, which includes several big rooms and -- get this -- a huge theater.  The theater was our backup plan in case of bad weather.\n- A full kitchen and big set-up room for your caterer\n- Craft rooms, kids play rooms and other small spaces for resting brides or hysterical future mothers-in-law\n- An outdoor terrace for dancing and live music\n- A parking lot for nearly 100 cars -- all yours\n- Access to the Museum's list of oddball SF nature specialists who usually show up at children's birthday parties -- but really, who wouldn't want live boa constrictors, weird insects and furry animals at their wedding?\n- And, all of the above for a FULL 24 HOURS.  Set up leasurely in the morning, have your guests arrive in the afternoon, let them dine and dance into the evening, then clean up at night.  \n- Did I mention the spectacular view of the whole city?\n\nSome drawbacks: \n\n- The Randall doesn't really know what a gem they've got, and so they're not really set up to handle weddings.  You'll need to take care of all the planning yourself.  \n- They're only available to rent on Sundays.\n- The building itself looks like a 1950s elementary school.  This is not the fussy white Victorian castle of your princess wedding dreams. Treat the building as a blank slate and focus on the amazing views. \n- While it's only a 10-minute walk from Castro St Station, it's a steep uphill walk.\n- It's fairly sheltered from the wind, but like any outdoor space in SF, it can get foggy and windy here.

I've never missed his show. It is great program, acting, singing and dancing. I always have so much fun, great time watching all kids great performance. The music directors, light tech and kids, they work so hard for the show. I think all kids are learning great deal working together as a team and having fun at the same time. \nI still remember his 1st show, I was so nervous before the show starts maybe more than my son, but when I saw him on the stage, I almost crap my pants, I couldn't believe that's him, he looked great.\nI really like any \"on stage\" shows, on or off broadway shows. Sometimes better than movies, I like small theatre too because stage is right there, very close, right on your face. I feel like I am a part of the show. \nBut, why many broadway shows, the stories are.......a bit.....\"Gay\"?\nWhy is it? Even though the writer was a straight man.\nFor example, the show \"Bat Boy\", I went there twice already, Holy Shit this show was so gay!\nAlso I have been wondering about Alfred Hitchcock's movie \"Rope\". The 2 men who killed their friend with the rope. The characters, I think they are so gay every time when I watch the movie.\nAnd \" Strangers on the train\". Oh my God they are so gay.\nBut that doesn't make Alfred Hitchcock gay.\nDon't get me wrong, I do not worry about anything of my son's sexuality. that's his business and I love him no matter what.\nI am just talking about the gayness in the story in the broadway shows and some of Hitchcock movies. Well, I think all men have \"gayness\" in ourselves. Maybe any human creativity somehow involve with \"gayness\". I believe all straight men have the \"gayness\" when we create something.\nSo, creative mind= gayness!\nI think \"being gay\" means 2 things.\n1, Homosexual.\n2, a person who is creative.\nSo, you don't need to be a gay man to being gay.\nI think I maybe gay because I notice woman's shoes a lot, or I am just a foot fetish, or I just like female shoes, so maybe I am a transvestite! I don't know, I don't care.\nBut, I don't understand why the baptist people protest the funeral for who killed in Iraq war.

It is a plain ol playroom with a carpeted stairwell with a fake tree in the middle.  I thought the toys were totally dumpy and for a \"toddler\" room, there were a lot of older children making it very difficult for a REAL toddler to mill about and explore.  Imagine your little one crawling up the stairs with 5,6,7 year olds barreling up and down.\n\nWhat I found really strange were the other mothers who were there during our visit.  There were a couple of caregivers who communicated amongst themselves, but at least they smiled when we got there.  The other English speaking moms were in their own little worlds within the tiny one we were already in.  I have never been to a children's play area where the moms don't communicate w/other moms, especially when the children are almost the same age.  We all chased around our kids in this cramped crowded room and ignored each other.  I don't know, is this the typical clientele at free venues?  NOT impressed.\n\nWe didn't visit any other 'exhibits' like this zoo I'm reading about, but I think I will give it one more shot.    \nIt's hard to find your way around once you're inside cuz it just looks like a teeny school with doors.  \n\nIt also sounds like a better place for older children. \n\nI STRONGLY recommend they put age limits for the Toddler Treehouse.

It is a remarkable feeling to be able to create something to take home every Wednesday evening.  The wide variety of crafts I've learned has given me the knowledge I was seeking and the reality that you do not have to have experience to create a work of art. \n     My friend, Michelle, and her sister, Mary, have been taking the class with me. Some of what they've learned in class has been used to create sellable items for their craft booth at the Embarcadero and through their website (www.mmsisters.com ). \n     Although I'm unemployed, I truly believe my weekly $20.00 is worth every penny (all materials needed are supplied including endless cups of tea). I am now creating art and crafts to be used to generate an income and holiday gifts made from the heart. But, one of the best things I receive from this class is a night of therapy, therapy with visual results at the end of the evening. \n     I recommend this class for anyone looking for an artistic release and a chance to explore where your artistic passion lies.  Expect an entertaining evening with good company. We all have fun in this class.", "author": "Karin O."}

With it being such a small museum, I was slightly worried that there would not be enough to fill a few hours but I was so wrong.  The staff and volunteers did an amazing job utilizing the space to create activities that were engaging for children and adults.  The kids could touch everything!  They haven't stopped talking about \"the museum on the hill\" and can't wait to return.", "author": "Meghan C."}
