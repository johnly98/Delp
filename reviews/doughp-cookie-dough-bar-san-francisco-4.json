This stuff is decadent and indulgent in every way possible. After a few bites I was ready to throw in the towel.

BUT, I happened to be in the area and was looking for a vegan bite to have.  DOUGHP was listed first, as it was closest to my location.  I went in, extremely excited, to try this vegan dough the reviews raved about.  I got there at around 6pm, and they were out.  This was totally understandable to me, once they showed me that they only make a small batch of the vegan dough.  I decided, maybe next time I'm here I will get to try it.\n\nFast forward to \"next time,\" I'm here a lot earlier, about 1pm.  I ask for the vegan dough and this time they have it.  I almost just went ahead and ordered a scoop out of excitement but I decided to get a sample.  I... couldn't even finish the small sample.  The vegan dough, which I believe was also gluten free (don't quote me on that,) was the weirdest, grainiest texture I had ever had.  The taste was also EXTREMELY underwhelming, it was just regular chocolate chip cookie dough despite the fact I came to this cool spot assuming the vegan options would be just as fun and unique as the omni options.\n\nHad this place been in a different location, I probably could understand a bit more.  But we are in the Bay Area, a prime location for vegan options.  I guess I just had my expectations set too high, but again this was not a good, flavorful experience for me.  I agree with another reviewer, save your time and just go to Cinnaholic for their cookie dough.  They have a basic vegan chocolate chip flavor, but over 20 topping options (which are all also vegan.)  Unfortunately, even store-bought vegan cookie dough was better than this stuff :-(\n\nMy rating is specifically for the lack of options and flavor for us veggies.  The staff, on the other hand, are all really nice and welcoming!  The place does have great hospitality.  I would love to see more options implemented for vegans and maybe I'd be willing to try this place again-- I really wanted to love it!!", "author": "Jessica E."}

I've been hearing a lot about edible cookie dough and I more or less had an idea of what to expect. I'm a huge fan of raw cookie dough but the edible cookie dough I've tried never lives up to the raw stuff so gotta keep my expectations in check. I ended up getting the nutella oreo w/ whipped cream & oreo bits in a choco-hazelnut cone.\n\nPositives of this place:\n-No line: Ok I know this is far from everyone's experience but there was absolutely no wait on a Tuesday night in the spring.\n-Great service. Had a nice conversation about music w/ one of the employees and she was nice about the toppings. She also knew we wanted a nice photo & she put in extra effort to make it look nice.\n-Neon Sign: If you're getting edible cookie dough, you're most likely a little basic deep down which means you need a photo w/ a neon sign. Well DOUGHP has you covered.\n-Location: Write by the water/hovering over the pier. You can sit on a little balcony and people watch as you gorge yourself on cookie dough\n-Cookie dough isn't too sweet\n-Employees let you sample\n-Variety of flavors: There's a ton of options beyond plain or chocolate chip. Not all of them were great but it's nice to have the option\n\nNeutral/Negatives:\n-A bit pricy. $6 for a basic scoop and all the add-ons really pile on the cost though it seems like they also work with a non-profit so price isn't as big of a deal\n-Cone is alright. Seems to be made by the same people who make Milkbomb's cones which I didn't really enjoy (at least not the red velvet flavor). The choco-hazelnut was a bit better though still a bit tough.\n-Texture: It's cool to try to make the cookie dough look like ice cream but in the end it's just a bit too gritty and dry. But honestly it's to be expected.\n-Flavors: Some of the flavors just didn't work too well for me like the matcha w/ white chocolate\n\nOverall, this isn't the place to go to if you want to elevate your dessert palate but it's a fun sweet treat to try at least once.", "author": "Vivian C."}

I don't think a single word was exchanged with me in this whole interaction, just a few looks and grunts in response to my questions.\n\nAfter I decided on my order, I asked her for a scoop of the Eminem and started pointing towards cones and asking my friends about the flavors, CLEARLY showing that I wanted a cone-- but she hastily scraped together the scoop and dumped it into a cup without even asking. When I went to politely correct her, she just frowned and gave me this exasperated look. Didn't apologize or anything. Slapped my cup on the counter and returned to cleaning up for the night. I figured to just let it go, a flavored cone is a whole $1.50 more anyways.\n\nWe sat at their balcony overlooking the stores below. While DOUGHP's interior is adorable and themed like an ice cream parlour, their outdoor tables were filthy, covered in dough crumbs, renegade toppings, and bird poop. It's such a strange contrast to the otherwise cute decor. Maybe they forget to clean out here. \n\nEMINEM scoop: It's warm. I thought maybe they'd cool the tubs to prevent the dough from going bad, but it's not. And I expected it to be pretty sweet, but there's a tangy, \"artificial sugar\" aftertaste. The texture is gritty, like they didn't cream the sugar & butter enough. I'm surprised because other reviews are over the moon about their cookie dough!! Inconsistency issue? Idk.\n\nFor $6/scoop without a cone, you'd think it would be a generous af serving... Nope, it's just a tiny scoop that's barely the size of a golf ball.

They explained nothing to us about size, cup/cone or add-ins, and I just feel like that would be necessary at such a tourist location. \n\nI got the Nutella Oreo with m&ms I added on because it was either that or a plain dough colored orange and black. \nThe dough was very rich, but just tasted like regular cookie dough.

Decided to try Doughp on Saturday, September 16th around 5pm.\n\nWe decided to Fully Commit: 3 scoop ($15). I believe the flavors we wanted were The OG, Eminem, and Amber Rose. They were out of Eminem, so we decided to get Lemon Chili instead. Since we were fully committing anyways, we decided to Dough It Up ($1.50), which meant we get three toppings. I believe we got: Butterfinger, Heath Bar, and Cookie Crisps. The cookie dough was good, but I don't think this was up my alley. A tiny bit of cookie dough here and there is fine. Or mixed with ice cream. But to eat three scoops of it? It was too much. I needed something to provide relief from the texture as it was just dry and doughy. The toppings didn't really help as they were dry as well.\n\nCute concept. Great for people who adore cookie dough. But for me?

I may be biased because I've never been a fan of cookie dough, so I wasn't completely sure what to expect from this place. For $5 I got a huge scoop of cookie dough in a waffle cone. I opted for the regular flavor, and after 4 bites, I already knew I couldn't take anymore and really considered seeing my dentist. \n\nPerhaps if the dough was cold, it may have been better, but it just tasted like chewy sugar? If you want to come and see what the hype is about, I wouldn't advise you against it, but I'd definitely recommend sharing just one with another friend instead of buying your own and potentially wasting your money.

We had been there a few days before but hadn't seen it (it's kind of tucked away upstairs near Crab House). I was with 2 cookie dough fanatics so when we got there at opening time (10am) and the doors were locked, we we're a little disappointed. The guy behind the register made no effort to open up or get things in order quicker. So after looking in the windows we decided to walk around to give him more time. We came back around 10:20 and the doors were finally open. He didn't greet us, ask if we had any questions, or apologize for being closed earlier. We ordered and went out back to eat our goods. Now, let me say, the dough is delicious. However, at this price point ($6 for a single scoop, add on toppings/flavored cones/sauce) it's about $8.50. Ouch. Although it was good, we couldn't finish it. I mean let's be real...when you eat cookie dough from a batch you're baking you really only need a couple bites. Also, they don't sell milk, only coffee. Kinda baffling as we all know cookie dough loves milk. I really think this idea would be better suited in ice cream. Like all the different doughs in vanilla ice cream would be much easier to eat.

On the other, I just wasn't expecting what actually transpired (which is, me not really feeling the \"cookie dough\" movement. Let me explain.\n\nAll my life (or as far back as I could remember), I've been all about that cookie dough life. I rocked hard with the cookie dough, not because I was a risk taker (you know, that salmonella risk), but I just loved the taste. Always told myself I could eat cookie dough for days! And I always order cookie dough ice cream. I just found it delish!\n\nAnd thus, the time finally came for me to taste what I had been craving for years! So I loaded the twins up in the car, and we drove on down to this spot, all in anticipation (well, anticipation on my end...the twins could care less). Anyways, I was finally ready to have my world rocked by this dope dough (see what I did there).\n\nThankfully there was no line and the sales associate was sweet as can be. I wasn't really impressed with the flavors that day, so I asked to taste a couple. I ended up with the vegan oatmeal one. I also selected the Cookie Monster, because why not!?! I could barely maintain my excitement in the deliciousness! And finally (FINALLY!!), I get to take my first bite.\n\nAnd then...nothing. I mean, I just felt something was off. Maybe it was because what I was eating was room temperature and I'm used to eating things in containers and/or that \"appear\" like dessert with ice cream, so my mind had a hard time comprehending their not being any ice cream (just dough). It was just weird and very anti-climatic from  my end...and a bit disappointing.\n\nSo I write all this to say, that this place isn't bad, it's just important to keep your expectations in line. That, and I can't handle that much cookie dough. Like maybe if it was broken up by some ice cream, then yea. But the straight cookie dough on a cone/in a bowl was a bit much even for me and my sweet tooth. But the flavor is good, customer service rocks, and hopefully there's ice cream to be added in the near future to blast this concept thru the roof (and if not, at least it's pretty good cookie dough).", "author": "Tracy T."}

I didn't think of that at all when I went. I was there for one reason: to eat cookie dough!\n\nYou either get it or you don't when it comes to dough. As a kid I liked the dough more than the cookie. As a teen I once made myself sick from \"sampling\" too much dough. I gave it up after that, and now someone has opened a fantasy paradise for cookie dough-lovers that doesn't use eggs (no more fear of salmonella, yay!). \n\nThe place is cute, and in a great location at Pier 39. I knew I just wanted to try the original. If I went again maybe I'd try some of the other flavors, but original was great. I really like this dough! I think some people are expecting cookie dough ice cream, especially because they see you can get it in a cone. It is NOT ice cream, and it's not cold. It is just like cookie dough. So that is why I say: know if you like cookie dough before you get one. If you never cared for it, you won't like this. I personally had no desire to try it in a cone, or with toppings. But to each his own! \n\nService was good. It was friendly but a tad slow. I wasn't there at a time where there was a really big line though, so it didn't take too long.\n\nLike almost everything in San Francisco, it is expensive. I imagine it must cost them an absolute fortune to rent that place in such a busy tourist area.  I won't dwell too much on price. Why? Because since moving to CA I have been just flabbergasted at almost all the prices on virtually everything. I mean everything. I literally take pictures of prices at the grocery store. The gas station, etc. Doughp is no different, it's no worse, and I'm actually getting used to the prices anyway. Everything is almost double what I'd pay where I came from in the midwest, like it or hate it. It won't change so I might as well not complain.\n\nThe small serving for me personally was perfect. Cookie dough is thick and rich and sweet. Everyone is different but I couldn't handle more than a small most likely. I had just had lunch so I will take that into account, but after the small I  felt almost a little disgusting. \n\nI'd say if you like cookie dough, go for it!", "author": "Erika B."}

Still gritty and leaving tire marks on your tongue -- but good.\n\nThe employee noted that most people opt for the original chocolate chip cook flavor. The also had Oreo and s'mores flavors, yet I found the straight up unadulterated buttery flavor of the original to be most enjoyable (this is coming from an Oreo fiend). I wished that the scoop was slightly more chilled rather than room temperature but this might not matter to most.

They should offer more with the cookie dough.  For example; cookie dough chocolate covered truffles, fresh cookie dough I can bake at home for a party, cookie dough ice cream sandwich.

I now take the time to thank Kelsey W. for the latest food creation of the future, one that never melts like frozen yogurt or ice cream!  My scoop of the first visit is amber rose cookie dough on a creamsicle cone.  I only taste the sweetness of the cookie dough, but I couldn't feel the flavor of the rose water.  Still, I like the raw cookie dough that is eggless, which is vegan.  Going to the Myriad and into DOUGHP is better than going to any bakery shop for some baked cookies.

It was a fun time and worth waiting for.\n\nThere are 3 sizing options: one scoop, two scoops, and three scoops. The scoops are generously sized; I can eat with the best of them and two scoops was definitely more than enough for me. The prices are $6, $10, and $15 respectively, which I gotta say made me say, \"Whoa. That's steep.\"\n\nI got a scoop of \"Eminem\" (M&M cookie dough) and \"The OG\" (chocolate chip) in a Birthday Cake cone. Both doughs were really good, though not as sweet as I expected (which was probably for the best). \"Eminem\" was a little skimpy on the M&Ms. I didn't like my cone - it tasted like coconut or artificial fruit flavoring or something, not at all like cake (it occurs to me the scooper may have given me the Fruit Loops cone by mistake, considering how fruity it tasted). \n\nRuby got \"Eminem\" in a Red Velvet cone, with sprinkles. She loved every bite, and I also liked the piece of cone she gave me. One scoop was bountiful for the child. If I can make a suggestion: a kids size scoop would be a great idea. \n\nIn addition to what we tried were cones of several other flavors as well as a good selection of toppings and drizzles (I almost got a caramel drizzle but restrained myself).\n\nThere were several flavors but we decided to go with the basics. I was curious to try a couple of the other flavors but they weren't giving samples at the opening. Not sure if they will regularly, though I recommend it (feel free to limit to 2 per person, if you do, DOUGHP). A couple of the flavors I could not bring myself to order without trying because the descriptions were questionable. One was chili lemon which...I couldn't imagine how that would taste good as cookie dough but it must be good to someone! Another was \"Amber Rose\" which I heard described as rose and elderberry, I believe. I've had both flavors in ice cream but in my mind that would be hella floral/perfume tasting in cookie dough. \n\nLooking forward to going back and seeing what new flavors they have in the future.

I tried three of the cookie doughs (there was only five flavors, and no unique ones such as snickerdoodle or s'mores or any actual fun flavors) and all three I tried basically tasted the same. I was disappointed, but I ordered a cup anyways and got sprinkles and chocolate sauce to help add some flavor to the very bland cookie dough I had tried in the sample. Unfortunately the toppings did not help. I probably had 4 small bites of the dough (small size) before I decided it wasn't worth the calories. I was really rooting for this place but honestly the lack of selection and the boring tasting cookie dough was just not good. It's a total tourist trap, as it trapped me, but I will definitely not spend money here again sadly.

The dough is absolutely delicious, but so rich after a few bites. Thankful the scoop is small, sad it cost $5.\nYes, the dough is soooooo good. I would want it in my fridge any time for sure!!! I was super impressed. But in the end, I don't think the product justifies the price. \nNow, if we are ever in the Streatfood park again and Doughp is there, I would order a scoop of their lavender for sure, as the flavor sounds delicious. But I would probably get it to do and put it in my fridge to sneak bites out of. \n4 stars for the product, minus 1 star for the price and the small selection that is actually available at one time.", "author": "Kat R."}

But you rapidly fill up and just feel kinda \"I'm done.\"  Even my GF, who loves raw food and whatnot, couldn't finish her scoop.\nAt $5 a scoop (+50 cents per topping) there's no way I would go back, or recommend this to any of my friends.

If you are going to scoop and serve cookie dough like ice cream and price it higher than even fancy ice cream per scoop, you should give nice round generous scoops. \n\nThe cookie doughs I got were the White Girl and This Smore is Hella Lit. Both good, a bit too sweet for an adult palette. I also can see the sweet and dense dough tasting lighter if the dough were refrigerated, or maybe with some air beaten in. After all, lots of people have memories eating premade cookie dough out of the fridge, which is what this is. \n\nOverall this is a great concept but don't forget it's cookie dough, not macarons or ice cream.

During one sitting, I spooned out some dough and found a green string like thing. It definitely wasn't edible and should not have been in the dough. I contacted Doughp via Instagram DM and the owner told me to stop by and she'll take care of me. I went the next day and the shop was actually closed so she didn't have any cookie dough to switch out for me. She took a look at the green thing in the dough and said it was a piece of sponge and said they would be more careful in the future. I had to return a second time to switch out my dough and didn't even receive any free dough for the inconvenience. The owner was nice and responded quickly but I was hoping for more, especially since I was a super fan customer and always purchased multiple containers of dough.\n\nAnyways, I put the first incident behind and continued to be a loyal customer. I had a container of OG doughp that I was eating over the course of a few days. My very last bite, there was a light brown hair stuck in the dough. I had to pull the piece of hair out of my mouth and almost threw up, I was so disgusted. I was especially grossed out because the hair was sitting in the dough the whole time I had it in the fridge, which was a few days and who knows how much longer at their shop. I didn't bother to contact the shop owner because of the previous experience. I didn't have the time or energy to waste driving back down to their store just for them to exchange it.

It consist of marshmallow, graham, chocolate chips and cookie dough. I was surprised that the cookie dough wasn't hard as rock nor soft as jelly. It was the perfect texture.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-12", "description": "THE BEST DESSERT IN SAN FRANCISCO, PERIOD!!! Before I begin to comment on the cookie dough, I would like to focus my attention on the actual establishment. First and foremost it is impeccably clean. A seasoned foodie, I occasionally am willing to forego modern sanitation in the quest for good eats from any number of dives. I am glad I don't have to make that choice at DOUGHP. No dust, no crumbs and no fingerprints on the glass. Second but equally important, organization. From the cookie dough and toppings to the serving utensils and signage, it is clear that careful planning went into presentation. When you approach the bar, there is no confusion as to where you place an order or pay for that order. Finally, what makes this place really special is the people. They're not preoccupied in the background on their phones or engaged in meaningless chit chat. When you walk in, immediately their attention is focused on you, the customer. Eye contact and warm smiles are followed by a warm greeting. Owner Kelsey is passionate about her product and is happy to introduce you to the world of all things cookie dough. Her and the team members at DOUGHP are down to earth, genuine and leave no doubt in your mind that your business is appreciated. These qualities are huge for those versed in the art of eating, especially when you're drawn 700 miles away from home to experience what San Francisco does best, FOOD! \n\nOf course there is the cookie dough. I never imagined such flavors and variety were possible. It looks good, smells great and tastes even better. Samples are as plentiful as the patience of the staff here which lends to the fun atmosphere.Then there is the value. No conservative serving sizes that leave you less than satisfied here. Although my little ones had no problem polishing off their cookie dough cones, I was impressed that I was hard pressed to finish my bowl. Comfortable seating, no crowds, and dedicated restrooms seal the deal. Try saying that about Fisherman's Wharf or the Mission. For you tourist parents such as myself, yes this is a completely safe, family friendly location with easy access and plenty of parking. When you need a break from all the tourist spots and pricey dining in the city, keep DOUGHP'S address close by. You'll find a wide array of pinball machines with chill music in the background to relax to. I would highly recommend visiting DOUGHP before this hidden gem finds its way to Travel Channel and Food Network notoriety. Thanks to Kelsey and the staff at DOUGHP for adding a little magic to our vacation.", "author": "Ed M."}

Order on Postmates for the full glutinous experience (and no circling for parking spots!). I love dessert a little too much, so I rarely have trouble finishing a medium portion of ice cream or similar dessert. That being said, one scoop is DEFINITELY enough cookie dough for one person.

At $5 a scoop (with no toppings or cone) it is more expensive than any ice cream in the city yet I imagine that it is incredibly cheaper and easier to make. And also trivial to make by 6 year old. I had the Smores cookie dough and it wasn't bad, but not good either. There was nothing really special about it, and I've definitely made better cookie dough myself (when I bake cookies, of course :P)  And like other reviewers said, after eating like half a scoop you get over it and it just becomes unappetizing.

M&M, Oreo, nutella, just to name a few; I tried a sample of the oreo & nutella & decided on the nutella.  Like the Oreo, it was sublimly smooth & full of flavor.  This place is a bit expensive as three scoops were $19.00, but it is Pier 39 after all & regardless, well worth it.  You can eat inside or out on their little padio.

I called what I thought was a shop only to have Kelsey ( the owner) answer and let me know they have a cart they serve out of and that they would have a brick and mortar location hopefully very soon. Anyways, I called and she let me know that they were close to closing and wrapping up for the night so I probably missed it because of that. We were bummed, but took it on the chin and proceeded to start our way back home when Kelsey called me back and told me that she just called her employee and that if we wanted he would wait for us to come back and hold off on closing so we could get our cookie dough; She also told us where to look for the cart ( we walked right past it the first time!) We were shocked and stoked all at the same time so we rushed back to were she said it was and sure enough there it was, haha. The employee was all smiles and super nice.
