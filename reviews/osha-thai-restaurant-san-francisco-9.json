I ordered a salad, it said mild and I confirmed with a waitress to make sure its not too spicy, she said its little spicy but not too bad. I could barely eat the salad yet along taste the flavor. It was SUPER spicy. I ended up eating the whole thing because I didn't want to waste it, but I def learned my lesson by not fully trusting waitresses in Thai restaurants about spices.

From the moment we walked in the door, we were greeted with nothing other than the biggest grins and kindness from the host and servers. Its almost creepy how seriously nice they all were! lol. \n\nWe were hungry travelers and we ordered a panang curry, spicy eggplant w chicken, and pad knee mao with egg noodle (per our server's suggestion). My dude is really sensitive to spice bc of really bad heartburn, and he was assured that the pad khee mao has no chile/spice. When we were served, his first bite of the noodles (which he said were delicious) was quite spicy. I tried them myself and they had a slight kick. To my beau's sensitive heartburn, that really didn't fare well. We really reluctantly asked our server if there was anything we could exchange it for. He apologized for the dish and right away brought out a pad see ew since it is really without chile. The manager was so kind and apologetic and was periodically checking up on us. I had a coughing fit while i was eating my own dish (I was sick with a cold) and they nearly came rushing to ask me if my dish was too spicy. I can handle my spice and it was really my sickness that threw me into the coughing fit. We were really taken aback by how kind they were and how attentive they were to our sensitivities. Oh and I nearly forgot to mention that the plates are HUGE!!! Im used to paying a much lower price for thai food in Orange County, but bc the plates were so huge here it was really not a big deal.

I used to frequent this place after fun druken nights at the bar and club. There are several different locations in the city, but I've only come to this location because it's open until 3 am on Friday and Saturday nights (and until midnight on other nights)! Naturally the parking sucks around these parts, but it's nothing that a Bart train and a short Uber or Lyft ride can't fix.\n\nMy go to dish here is the crab fried rice and the mango and sticky rice for dessert (mmm!). Pair that with some sweet Thai iced tea and you're sure to die from a happy sugar overload! But really, it's just too good. The service is pretty standard and quick here despite it being one of the busier locations. Since there aren't too many food options available in the wee hours of the morning (other than fast food), this place can get packed. Be prepared to wait if you decide to come during the \"after the club munchies\" peak hours.\n\nAs far as price points go, I would say that this place is pretty reasonable for the city. The rice plates can run you about anywhere from $11-$15 and dessert about $5. I usually always end up taking leftovers home because eyes are always bigger than my stomach. They provide decent portion sizes for the price.

So, we headed in. \n\nI think I got something like pad kee mao. I don't think that's what they called it on the menu, but I knew that was what it was. It was pretty tasty, came out quickly AND the veggies still had a bit of a crunch to them. Yum. Everyone else seemed to like their food, too. Was it the best Thai food I'd ever had? No, but it was darn tasty! \n\nAnd, believe it or not, we were done and walking back to the office in just the right amount of time. The staff really went above and beyond to make sure we were happy and served quickly. That kind of customer service makes me want to come back again and again--when I'm in town, that is.

It's much less ornate and definitely doesn't exude the same trendiness factor that its sister restaurants do. With hesitation, I dined here and was pleasantly surprised to find that the food quality and flavor is consistent and just as amazing as always.\n\nDespite the food being memorable, the location is definitely a bit borderline in the shady area of SF, so just beware. Don't get stuck in the secondary dining room (like we did), because you will be forgotten (we were). We had to flag down the server to place an order, for water refills, and for the check. Kind of annoying. In addition, Heat didn't seem to exist in that secondary dining room - we were freezing dining here at around 10pm. Good thing we had bowls of soup and hot food on the table.\n\nThree stars for location, service, and ambiance.\nFour starts for the food.", "author": "Mansi A."}

The quality of the food was spot on: as you'd expect from Osha. Pad see-ew was notably a high point, and the spicy green beans are good enough to be a staple for every order. \n\nThe delivery was the issue here. Cramming food containers into a bike messenger bag is a disaster. One of the containers broke and leaked sauce everywhere. Probably worse for the messenger than for me, but this should not continue. Innovation is required. Maybe someone at Yelp can \"hack\" a solution to the stop-gap of delivering food in a backpack.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-11", "description": "A salute to an SF institution, a true essential, a purveyor of Thai food so renowned it's famous for being famous--and almost equally famous for being unjustifiably famous. Among new arrivals to our fair city it's almost Pavlovian: Mention Thai food, and the recently self-styled expert will immediately bring up Osha Thai. Where else? It's almost the perfect tell for identifying people who don't know one one bit about what they're talking about, but very fervently want you to believe that they do. I would sooner go to Lers Ros, or iThai, or Lalita, or House of Thai, or King of Thai Noodle, or even roll the dice on that newish Tycoon place around the corner. And yet I wind up here often enough.\n\nA few memories have accumulated themselves over the years, but perhaps my favorite comes from an ill-fated first date with a well-established professional perhaps ten years my senior who invited me here for an evening repast, then opened her laptop on the dinner table--after a suitable interrogation to establish needful details about the date and circumstances of my birth--to facilitate the reading of my star chart followed by stern advice on my impending future, all in advance of an invitation to chauffeur said professional and various friends from restaurant to party to home to cafe all over the city. (I hadn't offered.) A true gem of a moment that will stay with me through the ages...\n\nOh yes, the food. It is a restaurant, after all. Mediocre at worst, and at best. I really can't say enough about how simultaneously inoffensive and uninspired it is. It is truly the pinnacle of averageness, the height of moderate success, the Michael Jordan of mediocrity. I wouldn't take anyone here that I wanted to impress, or to offend. In fairness when it arrives at the table the food is generally very pretty, or at least above average, which is mostly true of the interior design, and of the other youngish patrons. Not bad to look at, and pleasant enough.\n\nBut it's still just not very good. One could call it the Dave Matthews Band of exotic San Francisco cuisine. On my last visit I ordered the pad thai with prawns, a standard $2 upgrade. Technically there were five or six prawns, on the smaller side of medium, piled atop the mound of peanut butter-tasting noodles. At first I thought the crushed peanuts made it taste like crunchy peanut butter, but after sampling the side without any crushed peanuts, the dish revealed itself as peanut butter all the way through. I didn't prefer the creamy to the crunchy, or the crunchy to the creamy, and the peanut butter didn't entirely dominate, except that when the sticky sweet peanut flavor finally dissipated it didn't taste like much at all. I torched the rest with red pepper sauce and mostly enjoyed not particularly enjoying my meal. It's hard to complain, and yet you're left wondering, why? It's like the Neil Diamond of Thai restaurant experiences--and that pad thai is its Sweet Caroline.\n\nI should hasten to add that the people who work here are always very attentive, very cheerful, and extremely polite. And they're open mad late and have booze in a boozy neighborhood, so I can see a good part of the appeal. By all means go, have a great time, and then you can tell the next wave of new San Franciscans all about the Thai restaurant that they just have to try!", "author": "James D."}

We placed our order through Caviar a couple minutes after 7pm. It arrived within the predicted time window, a little before 8:45pm. Prices below are what I paid using Caviar. All dishes were priced about 5% higher with the sides of rice being 6.67% - 7.5% higher.\n\n*Tom yum: spicy and sour soup, lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaf, mushroom and tomatoes ($13.65 bowl), Prawn (+$2.10)\n*Pad thai: wok-fried medium rice noodle, tofu, egg, bean sprout, chives, no crushed peanuts, Chicken ($12.55)\n*Som-Tum Poo: shredded green papaya, long green bean, Thai eggplant, salty crab, fresh garlic, Thai chili, tomatoes with spicy lime dressing, original Thai style ($10.50)\n*Thai fried rice: egg, tomatoes, garlic, onions and green onions ($12.55), Duck (+$3.15)\n*Pumpkin curry: kabocha squash, bell peppers, bamboo shoots and sweet basil in red curry, Chicken ($14.65 a la carte)\n*Steamed white rice ($2.15)\n*Brown rice ($3.20)\n\nI loved the papaya salad, but it was a little too fishy for the roommate. I think they added fermented fish water? I love my papaya salad super spicy and fishy, so I thought it was great! The pad thai was also delish! The noodles were cooked perfectly. The pumpkin curry had great flavor, but it was a little too runny for me. I love thick curries. The soup was super sour so it brought out a sweetness in it I didn't really like. I wish it were spicier. I wanted to like the fried rice, but unfortunately it was rather mushy.

We got in before the after-hour rush of clobbers came in so we were promptly seated at a nice table with a view by the window.  I ordered the Pad Thai bc any legitimate Thai restaurant should be able to cook their staple dish right?  \n\nMy dish came out almost immediately.  My first impression was depression.  They say you can taste with your eyes.  Well my eyes said \"where's the flavor\"?  The few pieces of chicken was unseasoned and white.  The noodles had absolutely no tamarind flavor nor spice.  Are these people related to the owners of Siam Taste in Sunnyvale?  I had to sprinkle the chili powder onto it to give it some flavor to make it barely tolerable.  As I continued to eat, I kept pulling out hard pieces of uncooked rice noodle out of my mouth.  \n\nMrs Slumdog, aka \"Miss 1/3 Asian\" convinced me to just have them take it back, which I reluctantly did because the last thing I want is to taste some Thai Phlegm in my next dish.  We flagged a guy down to tell him of my dissatisfaction with this and asked for a menu to replace this disgusting heap of grass.  He disappears and minutes later I had to flag him down again.  Did he think I was kidding?  \n\nAfter I finally flagged him down to drop off the menu, the pad prick never came back.

Like whaaaa? We didn't know that door wasn't meant to be used , it wasn't clearly marked or anything but okay not a big deal just a weird way to handle things . Your first reaction shouldn't be to scream at a customer but this isn't going to be the last time he screamed at us this night . After eating for a while , I had to use to restroom .

I told him I just had to use the restroom and I'm sorry and he starts waving me like I'm some sort of idiot like really ? I know it's 4/20 but you seem more out of it than me .

After a long night of partying we ended up coming back to our hotel quite late - we were drunk and hungry, so off we go trudging the butt busting hilly streets of San Francisco, as to be expected many of the soup houses we want to go to have already closed their doors for the night (morning to be exact) but like a glimmering light and a buzzing busy crowd Osha was still bustling and buzzing like a fresh bushels of flowers mobbed by hungry bees! I was surprised how quickly we got seated, the place is quite chic, clean with efficient servers, we glanced at the menu and no less than a few minutes we knew what we wanted to order. I had the Osha Tom Yum spicy noodle soup and my buddy got the Beef Noodle soup. Not sure if we were that drunk and hungry or maybe the food was just irresistibly yummy but we devoured the humongous bowl of noodle soup rather quick! My Tom Yum was nice and tasty! An intermittent huff and cough follows from time to time as this soup has a really nice spicy kick! My friend devoured his noodles and the nice hunk of beef like a hungry beast and like a drunk sailor picked up his bowl and simply chug down the soup hahaha kidding aside - I was so happy to have stumbled upon this place! Awesome soups to refresh the otherwise inebriated half conscious drunk minds! The perfect way to end a night of partying and drinking!", "author": "Neil G."}

To reiterate, the fatty part that was directly under the brown, roasted top layer was still there, but said top layer was gone.  Soooo...you can even argue that they were trying to be health concious by removing the skin cuz the fat was still included.  Did they use the skin for the curry in someone else's order?  Did they accidentally burn the top part and decide to only include the part that wasn't spoiled?  I don't know.

Based on my late night visits, I would've given them 3-4 stars, but after visiting sober, I've downgraded them to 2 stars.\n\nMy friend and I shared the Papaya Salad, Tom Yum soup with shrimp, and Pad Kee Mao with Duck.  Papaya Salad was just okay.  Tom Yum soup was too sweet (yup, too sweet, weird, right?).  The rice noodles with duck were just alright.  But, the red hot sauce that was on the condiments caddy was not hot; it was pretty bland as far as alleged hot sauces go!\n\nNext time I'm in that 'hood, I'll head back to Thai House Express for some Thai goodness.", "author": "Christina L."}

I have never been here before but people I was with have been here before and kept talking about going here all night, and what's really good about this place is that it is open until 3 am. We ended up coming in at about 1:30-2 ish am maybe. And the place was packed! \n\nI remember thinking to myself that any place that is this packed at this hour MUST be good! We put our names down on the waiting list and before you know we got a table fairly quickly.\n\nAfter everyone had ordered, the food came out pretty fast and our table had been taken over by Pad Thai...Beef Pad Thai, Pork Pad Thai, etc... \nI have never had Pad Thai before but now I can say that I am a true fan! It was so good and now I know what the rave was all about for this place.\n\nWe also ordered a side of Wontons and they were pretty good, I just wish they would give you more of the dipping sauce. They give you a bunch of wontons and not a lot of sauce. But they were still good with no sauce on them.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have which to me isn't the worst thing is that they only have 1 bathroom! And if you are there late people who are intoxicated and have to go to the bathroom could be in there a while and if they are in front of you could be bad..and having only 1 restroom, both guys and girls have to share it. And the line could get pretty long too.\n\nOverall, I had a good experience trying a new place with new friends and I am a fan and would be going back!!", "author": "Jason D."}

I'd ordered from this place a decade ago and seem to recall having issues, but I wanted Thai food and everything else was closed, so I hoped something had changed in ten years.\n\nI ordered pad Thai but specified no onions. They got the pad Thai right, but it was bland. There was little flavor, and it wasn't that great even as is. I gave it to my friend because I couldn't stomach the lack of flavor, neither could he, but he planned on dousing it with sweet and sour sauce to make it edible when he got home. \n\nAs for the pineapple fried rice, this was my mistake. I missed there were onions in it, but this is where the difference between a great restaurant and one that never gets visited again occurs. See, I put no onions on the pad Thai, and in my experience as a restaurant manager, this conflict in ordering requires a follow up call to the customer. A customer who gets a call to clarify that the ingredients was missed gets an order they're happy with. The customer who gets an order where the chef just followed a bunch of items on a piece of paper is the one that delivers a customer the order they'll throw away. \n\nAt the other end of that order is a person, and when restaurants forget this, orders suck. I know I would never allow my staff to make this mistake or even consider it acceptable that no contact was made with the customer to clarify the order. Needless to say, I will not be frequenting them again as a result of this and the fact that even onions aside that the rice was also disgusting as my friend agreed who liked onions. \n\nSo, I guess this is a reminder to the restaurant that the customers who walk away and never come back are the ones who've likely had similar experiences where the service was meh and not worth going to again.", "author": "dAvid s."}

Let's face the cold hard truth - when you find yourself at a place like this at midnight, it's usually because you're not caring about anything much, you just need food, and quick. But Osha delivers the goods well above and beyond what would normally be expected from a place that exists solely to help one soak up alcohol.....space cookies....both? Within stumbling distance of where I was staying (albeit stumbling up some pretty steep hills), how could I resist? I also couldn't resist making Occupational Safety & Health Administration jokes (hey, you tend to remember *some* things from business school).....\n\nAnyway, this is some smokin' gourmet Asian Fusion stoner food. Temptation Rolls were certainly tempting, with coconut curry mousse and sea bass. Japanese meets Thai in a torrid embrace. Then there was a mango curry with prawns and calamari, which kinda reminded me upon first glance of something that might be found back home with our ubiquitous mangoes - but instead of taking the Caribbean/Creole tack, it went with coconut and jasmine rice. One foot in Thailand, the other somewhere else. An interesting dish.....but dessert was even more interesting, a colorful coconut jelly with tapioca. It was oddly colored....looked like no dessert I'd ever had. A little gooey, but I was expecting that - and the pieces of corn \"baked\" in throughout gave it some textural pop. \n\nI almost feel that this place deserves better than its apparent reputation as a late-night hangout.

It was a close walk and I trusted her opinion, so I figured, why not?\n\n   The interior was a more modern take on Asian, nothing particularly noteworthy.  I did however love the wide wraparound windows, to people-watch while we ate.  Since we were there a little later in the evening, we had absolutely no problem grabbing a table.  Although they do have your more typical Thai choices, like pad thai, we opted for their more unique offerings.  We quickly put in an order for temptation rolls, a mixture of Chilean sea bass, coconut curry mousse, and fragrant herbs, rolled up in seaweed.  I don't remember too much about this other than to say we gobbled it down nearly as soon as it was placed in front of us.  Next up we chose one of the monthly specialties, a Golden Mango Curry with prawns, calamari, coconut yellow curry, fresh mango, carrots, onions, and bell peppers served with jasmine rice.  It was unlike any traditional thai curry I'd had before, but it was really flavorful and quite tasty.  For dessert we went with the rainbow coconut, which was described as rainbow-layer thai coconut jelly served with tapioca.  I don't know quite what I expected but what we received was so stunning and whimsical it reminded me of something out of Puff the Magic Dragon.  The \"jelly\" was almost custard-like, smooth and rich.  I really enjoyed the textural contrast of the tapioca.  Plus, they added pieces of corn, yes corn.  It was completely unexpected but added a phenomenal burst of flavor that really worked with the silky coconut.

But I didn't.\n\nI went with my sister, my girlfriend, and my best friend. We loved this place unanimously. Here's what we got:\n\nDrinks: Kiss Me Please, Osha Volcanic Mojito.\nThe Osha Volcanic Mojito is good to have when you go on dates with a shy asian girl who doesn't like to drink. It'll get them hooked right away, and you'll thank the social lubricant. It's REALLY tasty because of the sweetness. You can barely taste the alcohol, it's like drinking an exotic fruit punch.\n\nThe Kiss Me Please is for the more intense person. It's a little spicy! If you like a special exotic taste that's not very sweet definitely get this. For the entire time, this drink had bubbles sizzling through the drink. Very artistic, and very tasty.\n\nDishes:\nPad Kee Mao: This tasted like every other Pad Kee Maos... I don't understand why everybody loves it. I will go eat more of these and maybe I'll understand it better...\n\nMango Curry: OH MAH GAWD! The taste went into my mouth and then the smell went up my nostrils and everything combined and exploded in my head. I simply love the taste. There is shrimp in there and other seafood meat, which was beyond my expectations. I thought I was just getting mango in my curry!\n\nCrap Fried Rice: Hmmm.... I really liked the crab meat. The first 2 bites weren't that great, but after awhile I started lovin it. It's an acquired taste I guess... I'm glad I started liking it. As we were eating, we saw  TWO crab pinchers! Not one, but TWO! \n\nThis restaurant was great, the total for everything was $60.60\n\nFrom my one experience at this place, I got the impression that it's the kind of place that goes beyond expectations.\n\nAND THE PLACE is pretty nice! Sharp contrast with the Janky neighborhood. If you come here on a date, take a cab here. \n\nWhen you leave, call (415)333-3333 and order a cab right when you get the tab.", "author": "Song Z."}

Something fairly uncomplicated, reservations not really necessary, and could seat a medium sized group. \n\nThey easily accommodated 7 of us at a table...quickly informed us it was $5 cocktail night (Thursday), we all ordered a diabetic-coma-inducing cocktail (seriously, nothing smooth or subtle about any of these!) and then got to work ordering things to share. I had the \"I love lychee\" and after about half couldn't finish. Stick to Rye for the cocktail magic. \n\nOrders of Tom Kha rice noodles (yum!), pepper lamb, garlic chicken, beef wasabi rolls, spring rolls, mango salad all arrived in succession, hot and tasty. We were all able to split easily, and there was surely plenty of food for all of us. Actually the lamb sticks were my favorite. \n\nFor $138 with drinks/tax (roughly $20/pp), this was a steal in SF. The food is fairly average Thai, but certainly not disappointing, the drinks are super sugary....the service AOK. It's open late and next to Rye, so right there you've got a win.", "author": "Colleen C."}

The Osha in the Mission was the first restaurant I patronized when I moved back to San Francisco.  I was obsessed. Every day I would venture over and indulge in a massive serving of pad-thai and pumpkin curry.  It's no big surprise that the Thai food here in San Francisco far exceeds all Thai food experiences in Boston (where I lived for a couple of months).\n\nThe Geary location is the original Osha location and you can feel it. The place just feels lived in and I can only imagine the debauchery that has stumbled in here since 1996. Situated right across from The Clift Hotel and right next door to Rye, it's prime real estate for those looking for some affordable quality grub before or after a late evening of cocktails.\n\nI always love coming to this particular Osha for their spicy string beans and for a side of brown rice. They don't mess around when it comes to their beans. The portions are seriously what's up and they always bring the spice. Their brown rice is great too. Fluffy and full of substance.\n\nIf you have yet to go to this Osha - try to fix that as soon as possible. It's a testament of how good food and hard working business owners can flourish in this city. The countless other Oshas which have opened up across the city -all stemmed from this one. And though the newer locations have added an air of modernity and chicness to them - this Geary location is historical and just go with the flow. And with a closing hour of 3:00am on the weekends and free delivery till 11:00am it exceeds what's upness in the restaurant landscape in San Francisco.\n\nTrust.", "author": "Jessica T."}

I'm giving it one, and that's being generous.  Come on Yelpers?  Are you kidding?  A four star restaurant has the service, ambiance and presentation it deserves.  This is a quick serve restaurant with a courteous staff. I had dinner here on 12/20/15. I ordered hot tea (Jasmine) on this cold, rainy night, but they were out!!  So green tea was delivered and it was not worth mentioning.  Next I ordered Tom Yum soup - a bowl. It was good.  Not great, but acceptable.  It was pricy at $16. Ouch, but it had 5 shrimp.  I also ordered Pineapple fried rice.  Gummy and totally without any flavor.  I found only two small shrimp for $14.  They are really stingy with the contents.  So overall, I would not recommend this restaurant.  There is another Thai restaurant about a block south that was packed.  Even on a rainy night they had a line out the door.

We did not leave a tip due to the waitress not doing anything special, she didn't fill up my friends glass of water, she didn't check up on us and she snatched the menus from our hands after ordering. \n\n     She came over and circled the tip guide and told us that the price that we payed didn't add up to what it should have been. she then said that the manager would get upset with them because they didn't get a tip and it reflected their performance. I explained to here that we are students and quit frankly don't have tips to spare for the night, we need to take the bus home and we need the cash. \n      \n      She then told us that it was traditional to give a tip and i told her i understood but that the manager needed to realize that not everyone eating there would have a tip to just hand out and that in reality we are not obligated to give you a tip). It was just so tacky and mediocre to get in our faces and circle the tip guide as if we were blind and didn't realize that it was even on the bill.

After that, my husband could not eat it.\n\nThen I tough shit, really this sucks, but keep a PMA, the green papaya with crab, that I was going to split with my friend, is coming. \n\nWhen the server was dropping the salad, he said to my friend \"wow, you sure eat allot\"???? \"Did he just say that?\" I asked, thinking I might have miss heard him. My friends we flabbergasted and said \"yeah he did\" WTF??\nMy friend was embarrassed, but I said to him \"let's just eat it and forget about the jerk server\". \nThe salad was so spicy I could even pass my first bite.

Review is for service at this particular location. \n\nWhen we ordered we asked for our order to be made a certain way. The server said it will be an extra charge of $2 for our request which I readily agreed. When the food came to our table it was prepared the standard way as it's generally served. When i questioned, the server claimed food was customized as we had requested but clearly it was not. There were no apologies rather there was an attitude of \"eat it and leave\". I let it slide and didnt make a big fuss of it although i was going to get charged extra couple bucks for the customized order.\n\nThe big surprise was when our bill came. A gratuity of 20% was already added to bill and ours was party of 3. I asked another sever (since our server was not in sight for over 10 minutes) for an explanation from whoever prepared the bill and automatically tacked on a gratuity whatever they feel they deserved. They finally fixed it but there was no explanation given on why the error occurred in the first place.\n\nPlease note another reviewer below had the exact same thing happen to him not too long ago.

The duck noodle soup and the Thai Boat noodles were consistently amazing. This noodle cafe was my go to place to bring people to when I ran out of ideas to go, but now I don't know if going here is worth a trek through the Tenderloin. \n\nI came here on a Friday night around 9. Me and my friend ordered a Volcanic Beef, Papaya Salad and Thai Boat noodles. We had dinner around 6 and weren't super hungry, but who could resist a second dinner? All the food disappointed me. Everything lacked flavor. The Papaya salad didn't have the tartness that it usually has, it felt like it was watered down. The rice with the Volcanic Beef was limp and soggy and the beef lacked flavor. The sauce was the only thing that saved the dish. It didn't just stack up to the Volcanic Beef that I had at the Osha Thai Embarcadaro.\n\nMy go to noodle dish, Thai Boat Noodles, was depressingly bland. The soup looked dark and thick, but the taste just wasn't there.\n\nYou've impressed me so many times in the past, but last week's performance was very disappointing.

When my friend asked for her entree to be made spicy, Gipzy rolled her eyes and said that my friend did NOT want her entree spicy. My friend insisted that she liked spicy Thai food, and after some negotiating Gipzy finally agreed. Gipzy then told us that if we didn't like our food, the restaurant would NOT be making us any other food. \n\nWe thought that she had to be joking but she was dead serious.

I know seeing over a thousand reviews for a restaurant, I usually feel like...eh, my comment isn't really going to help anyone. \n\nBUT....NOT THIS TIME!!! OH HELLLLLL NO!\n\nI live couple of blocks away from this Osha. It's one of the few sit down places open around here. I'm not a regular, but I feel like I've been here enough times to know the place pretty well. I don't know the staff by name, but I do recognize if the servers are new or if they changed up their menu...\n\nBasically, this review is a 2 for 1. \n\nTONIGHT...my party of four was seated and immediately my friend and I was wondering if our server was having a bad day. Dinner proceeded and she NEVER came by our table. Another server came by and cleared some of our empty plates and offered to pack up our left overs. Then, POOF! Our server appeared with our check. Wow, she must be having one of those days...\n\nThen I looked at our check....a gratuity was added. I immediately called her over and had the following conversation:\n\nME: \"I see a gratuity has been added, when did you start adding gratuity to parties of four?\" \n\nSERVER:  \"it's new, we add gratuity to parties of four or more.\" \n\nME: \"Okay, when did you start doing that? And where does it say that in the restaurant or the menu? So even THAT table over there will be charged a gratuity? \n\nSERVER: \"Okay, I will fix that for you\" \n\nUM....why are you treating me like I just ordered one appetizer and four waters for four people? I didn't know I was being a horrible customer ordering two drinks and four entrees. Did I offend you for coming into a restaurant to eat dinner? Or did our loving relationship just end when I put my fork down, therefore you and I will never see each other again???? \n\nThis is some shady behavior ladies and gentlemen! And when I asked for the manager, another server (because she disappeared again) told me, that it was the manager's day off. \n\nBecause this place is close to my house, I really really really don't want to hate the place. Another time, when I went about forty five minutes before closing time, they asked me if I could order everything at once so they can start closing the kitchen, I said sure! They want to go home as soon as the closing time, yes I understand they want to start closing the kitchen early. My roommate and I ordered couple of dishes and  fried bananas with ice cream. THE DESSERT CAME BEFORE ANY OTHER FOOD. \n\nOf course what I say here is solely my own opinion and blah blah blah...but honestly, Osha expanded the crap out of themselves and it seems there's NO SOLID MANAGEMENT. These servers do whatever they want, like start closing the kitchen early and adding gratuity to tables they \"don't like\".\n\nServers, customers, restaurant owners....we are all the same. You eat somewhere and the service is horrible, it puts you in a horrible mood. I don't go into restaurants thinking of ways to piss my server off. I'm not being overdramatic when I say that the server ruined our party's evening. What could have ended with a 15-20 percent tip with a, she must be having a bad night, comment amongst ourselves...it ended with an uncomfortable discussion with the staff.", "author": "Hanna K."}

So one day, me and my girlfriend after hanging out across the street at the Ambassador decided to have some dinner at this location\n\nWe were seated quickly upon entering and seeing how lucky we were to get the last table before it got more busy.

Luckily, eventually i found something I liked.\n\nI ordered the fried chicken with rice plate and my girlfriend ordered a peppered chicken over steamed rice and we were both happy with our selections.

It was pretty busy and we thought that the prices were reasonable (for SF) so we decided to have dinner.   \n\nOsha is nicely decorated in black and white; modern and chic dining furniture and wavy patterns on white walls seem to be a trend with Thai Restaurants that we've been hitting lately.  Osha seems to have a thing for chandeliers, too.  The environment is cool and minimalistic, but not uppity, as the servers are humble and direct.\n\nAs usual, I ordered the Pad Kee Mao (my favorite noodley plate!).  I asked for a few modifications because I thought that there were too many vegetables and I wanted a simpler taste.  They accommodated my request without hesitation and it was pretty damn good :)  The beau had the spicy basil leaf chicken, which was also good, but quite a simple dish that I don't think you could really mess it up.  Then again, what am I saying because people seemingly can manage to mess up anything.  Bottom line: Good chicken!\n\nOsha's decor gives it an air of an upscale restaurant, but the food is humble (fried rice, noodles, regular Thai food) and our service was great, so it's just a lovely combination of all those things together.

Due to odd winds and weird weather however his plane was delayed by quite a bit. So when he arrived to meet me at Rye it was fairly late and he was fairly hungry. We stepped outside to find food to remedy his sitch and shining bright right next door was Osha Thai Noodle Caf\u00e9. After a quick check on the Yelp app we went in and secured a table for 2.\n\nFrom what I can tell Osha Thai is sort of a late night haven for revelers looking for a bite to eat. It sort of has a diner-ish feel, but maybe a higher-class diner. Nick and I decided to share a couple of appetizers and a main course and so we ordered fried wontons (pork and shrimp wrapped with wonton), beef wasabi rolls (carrots, celery and mint wrapped with sliced grilled steak served with watercress and an awesome wasabi sauce), and Thai fried rice. While everything was fairly good the beef rolls were our favorite part. They were just the right amount of each ingredient and the spice was perfect for our tastes.\n\nThe service was good and even with our 3 shared foods and 2 drinks (wine and beer) our tab just barely crested $40, which I find quite reasonable for a \"dinner\" meal anywhere, but especially in this city.", "author": "Tiffany N."}

Back then Osha was a fantastic Thai restaurant with unpretentious ambiance, delicious authentic Thai dishes and great prices. Over the years I saw the food get progressively bland and the flavors watered-down, while the prices kept going up. Lately it seems, they paired it down to just one generic sauce blend that they pour over everything. The same sauce which I believe they now bottle and sell. Two days ago, I ordered the spicy eggplant with chicken, which used to be one of their delightful signature dishes, and sadly,that was mylast dish there as there was nothing but salty pieces of chicken over some rice.

Well, this is the BEST place near the Polk bars to get some quality carb-filled food to soak up the effects of your soon-to-be-hangover. (It's not like you're picky at this point, but hey, at least the sober ones are happy too.) \n\nHere are my recommendations. First, evaluate yourseld on a zero to ten drunk scale: \n\nIf you're at a 0 through 5 (meaning if you can distinguish between who you can touch and who and where you certainly cannot touch), GO FOR THEIR FRIED RICE! Chances are, you are sober enough to appreciate its savory goodness. The rice is never over-cooked and sticky. You'll get nice firm grains every time! :P\n\nIf you are at a 6 or 7, please, get the soups! They've got a large selection of soups that will keep you hydrated, but I'm not recommending them because they really suck. The best one they have is the Tom Yum, but trust me, the sour and spiciness will NOT sit well in your stomach... especially not in your state.\n\nIf you're at an 8, 9, or 10, don't bother coming.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-07-26", "description": "I guess there has got to be some sort of a reason why Thai restaurants in general are so expensive. \n\nI've been here only once for lunch. I ordered the crab fried rice, thinking that ill get some fried rice with some crab meat in it. It was fairly expensive for fried rice at around $15. My logic was very simple. If there are hundreds if not thousands of japanese and chinese restaurants around where you can get something like shrimp fried rice for $6-$10 that actually contains shrimp, you are bound to get some crab in a $15 rice plate. Rice costs nothing right?\n\nThe dish came with rice... that was fried, traces of egg, and two teeny tiny miniature baby midget crab claws. I think they were there just for the decoration but i still tried eating them. There was enough meat to get stuck between your teeth, but not enough to actually bite into it and taste it. \n\nThe fried egg and rice tasted just like fried egg and rice usually do. Contrasting the crab in this crab fried rice, the rice was plentiful. I would prefer some sort of a balance, like, enough of each ingredient to actually make an impact on the dish. \n\nInstead of getting a crab fried rice dish with no crab and lots of rice, i'd prefer either of these two scenarios:\n\n- A fried rice dish with lots of fried rice\n- A crab fried rice dish with lots of fried rice... and crab.\n\n\nI guess they would charge $50 for something like that. Each time i eat in an overpriced TL restaurant, i try to remember what i pay for. \n\nHordes of the filthiest homeless people asking you for anything and everything. Give me a quarter, give me a dollar, buy me lunch, give me a cigarette, give me a lighter, give me a hug...\n\nIt's a true San Francisco experience this is. Like, there is no better feeling than spending a ton of money on rice (that cheap white thing that billions of people in the 3rd world eat all the time) while observing the lowest point of human decay and misery through the glass. \n\nOh, i love that green metal box thing outside, you are guaranteed to see at least one person urinating or defecating there while you eat. MMMM yummy.\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom line:\n\nDon't get me wrong, i do understand what supply and demand is. San Francisco is full of smug snobs who won't eat anything unless its like $50 a bite or something. \n\n(Thats why i dream of opening an Italian restaurant here. Cook some pasta in some water, make a little bit of sauce pour it over, sell it for $$$$ and make gazillions of dollars. Might do a thai place now instead, need to see which ones cheaper, rice or pasta.)\n\nBut there are also the less fortunate who live here. Not the lazy tit sucking crack smoking bums of the TL, but us last suckers on the bus. Hard working young people who were unfortunate enough to have to move here during this new dot com craze. \n\nWhen i was looking for an apartment the best deal i could find was an \"efficiency\" studio. It's basically a tiny converted hotel room, so you have a bathroom but no kitchen. No kitchen means that you have to eat out all the time. When paying a $1000 for a sardine can like this, you can't really afford $50 a bite, or $15 for two tiny crab claws.  So if you weren't fortunate enough to land cheap rent control and have to live in the TL and eat out all the time, or if you don't work for google, i'd avoid this place.

No excuse. \n\nSecond, less serious: We ordered a spicy noodle dish and they asked us how spicy we wanted. We said medium. Now, I know medium means different things to different people, but it set my mouth on fire. We also ordered the string beans with beef, and she didn't even ask us how she wanted it, and that set our mouths on fire even more.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-01-08", "description": "I was a bit skeptical when my friend told me he wanted to come to Osha, because I worked right around the corner from the one in Union Square, where it was pre-prepared food. I mean, that place wasn't bad, but... hey this review isn't for the one in Union Square!\n\nAnyway, so when we walk in, the first thing I notice is the layout of the restaurant. The tables seemed oddly placed and cramped. So when the host, who was sitting down at a table, offered us a table, we asked to sit elsewhere and he kindly accepted. So we chose our own table.\n\nLooking at the menu, the selection was vast and not only that but the dishes were unique. The one thing about a restaurant that always catches my eye is whether their dishes are unique or not, because if they're just like any other restaurant, why bother coming to this specific one? So anyway, my friend and I picked out two appetizers and two mains, and we were going to dine family style. Sadly, they were out of the short ribs that we wanted, so we decided to just get some chicken wings.\n\nThe chicken wings came first, before the other appetizer, which was a tuna tartar. I was expecting just some plain old fried chicken, but these ones weren't just ordinary. They were lightly fried to perfection, nice and crispy, and were accompanied with a savory sweet and sour sauce. Personally, I would have never come up with this combination, but the balance of flavors was absolutely perfect.\n\nSecond, the tuna tartar was presented in a tall martini glass. It was an elegant display. Lightly spicy tuna tartar with mango and cilantro on shrimp crackers. Again, this mix of flavors isn't something I would ever think of, but it was another perfect balance.\n\nThen our entrees came, one by one. Volcanic beef and Spicy Laht Nah. Volcanic beef was another artful dish, prepared with a flower in an onion ring \"vase\", with white rice on the side. Mildly spicy beef steak, grilled to perfection. Chewy like it's meant to be, but not the tough kind of chewy. Then, the Laht Nah: the menu said that it was pan fried, but it was more like a stew because of the \"gravy\". There was a nice little design made with Sriracha on the rim of the plate, which gave it another artsy element to the dish. Add the peanuts on yourself; they're on the platter of condiments.\n\nI was absolutely impressed by the artistic nature of the dishes here. And for a great value at that. More than the average person would spend if they would dine alone, but certainly a great option if you're out with friends or in a party. A couple notes that I have to point out though: the timing of the dishes. Meant to be a two-course meal, because the dishes arrived at different times, it turned out to be like a four-course tasting menu. Second, even with appetizers, we weren't given share plates without asking. A minor detail but it should be mentioned nonetheless.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-04-07", "description": "It's not their fault that this was the first Thai food I had since going to perhaps the best Thai restaurant in the country (Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas).  I wasn't expecting this to be near that level.  I saw the yelp reviews here and knew what I was getting into a 3.5 star Thai place.  However, Osha Thai Noodle was right by my hotel and I needed some quick takeout, so I gave it a chance.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing but the food was pretty flavorless.\n\nI had the Chicken Stay Appetizer.  It was 4 tiny pieces of chicken no bigger than 3 inches long.  The marinade didn't do anything for the chicken and even the dipping sauces of peanut and cucumber seemed bland.  Main dish was Chicken and Shrimp Silver Noodle, also sometimes called Pad Woon Sen.  This is a noodle dish done in a walk with veggies.  The onions were under wok-ed, fairly crunchy and strong tasting.  It was served on a whole bed of rice that took up most of the to go container.  Now this is a noodle dish, so while I still like some rice with it, it's the noodles that should be the main event here rather than just a topping.  There were 3 overcooked tiny shrimp curled up in the fetal position to the size of a penny and a couple pieces of chicken.  It's a good thing I wasn't that hungry.\n\nOrdering over the phone was almost a screw up.  I felt that I didn't have the person's attention on the phone while they were taking my chicken satay, silver noodle order, with long pauses of silence, that made me think they were talking to someone else and I was interrupting their conversation.  Turns out, they weren't paying attention because they quickly read back Chicken Pad Thai and Silver Noodle.  \"Did you just say Pad Thai or Satay,\" I asked?  Again muffled conversation followed by \"Huh?\"  So I asked again - and was told Pad Thai, you ordered Pad Thai right?  So I corrected the order and the guy on the phone thanked me for catching that and hung up before telling me how long until the order was ready.  Now sometimes these things are lost in translation, but he had no accent and as soon as I walked in Osha, I knew this wasn't Mom and Pop in the back of the kitchen.  Everyone working there was very young and more interested in talking to one another while doing their job than making eye contact with their customers.  I'm guessing a lot of mistakes get made here,  but I won't be back to find out.  Bad food and not friendly service is a losing combination every time.", "author": "Dave G."}

Not like most places where you have to add additional hot oil/chile flakes/sri racha to boost the flavor. \n\nI ordered the spicy string beans with chicken. They asked if I wanted it spicy. Of course! Everyone else at our table was ordering spicy, I love spicy food, and no restaurant ever really makes it too spicy to eat. Plus I was beyond hungry at this point...this was after drinking at the bar down the street from 5-10pm & me finally getting my wish of going out to eat. I was happily eating my delicious string beans with chicken, when about halfway through I realized how goddam spicy it really was. I kept trying to eat more but my mouth was in flames. This is some crazy creep-up-and-bite-you-in-the-ass spice! But it was flavorful too and the chicken was cooked just right. I had to stop at some point & take the rest home cuz I just couldn't handle it anymore.  \n\nOsha Thai saved me that night. The spicy food satisfied my appetite & all the water I drank helped keep me hydrated after all those drinks earlier in the evening. Great place to have a late night dinner.", "author": "Erin S."}

We got the lunch special and it was that gave you a little spring roll and soup appetizer, followed by your choice of main dish. This was all pretty well priced for the amount of food you got and for its location in the marina. I had the spring rolls, which were light and flakey, and the eggplant dish, which was pretty good but yet seemed to be lacking a real kick. I am not going to rave about the flavor, because to be honest, it was solid but nothing really grabbed me and made me want to just sit back in my chair in a bout of flavor overload. The flavor was more restrained, timid almost, and it was closer to standard fair then amazing production. Don't get me wrong, its above average food, but not amazingly so.  The best analogy I can put is, once I was listening to a song by Melody Gardot (AMAZING SINGER), and through the whole song she kept this beautiful yet quiet and restrained low tone with hints of the brilliant high notes she could bring. It drove me mad, I just wanted her to belt it out as high as she could, yet in that song she never did. That is Osha, its good and you can see hints of brilliant and you want them to run with that and hit you with something amazing, but you find yourself waiting for the flavor knock out punch that never comes, instead you just get jabbed by pretty good flavors.\n \n \nOn another note, the d\u00e9cor....LOVED IT! Very well decorated and loved the little flowers that came on every dish. A very welcoming and nice feel.", "author": "Tom O."}

You need to know this!)\n\nI've been boycotting this location for several years now. Lucky me, the Bang San (now closed) on Jones Street opened up around the same time I decided to boycott this place. It's the first Osha location and one of the first Thai spots to open up in the area. Many other Osha locations have opened up since then and for good reason, the food is bomb!\n\nI remember when they first opened. I remember when this location was half the size, before they rented out their neighboring space, remodeled, and expanded. My money has assisted them in their renovations! Seriously, I used to go there all the time! If I have to credit any one location who introduced me to Thai cuisine and helped me appreciate it, I would point this place out.\n\nAlright, here's the big BUT...\nThe service is shitty. Well, it was at the time. I was going there for years, YEARS, and the service was ALWAYS shitty. I can understand being super busy and being all over the place, but do you have to be such bitches? Yes, bitches! I dealt with the attitudes...for YEARS! The food was worth it to me. \n\nHere's where they tried to play me...\nHere's where they lost me...\nIt's called \"gratuity.\" I give gratuity when the servers are gracious. I am a good tipper! Again, I can kinda understand if the service is bad because the location is busy and servers are stretched thin. I wouldn't take that personally, BUT when you have such horrible attitudes (almost all of them) and you act my simple requests are a burden, then you don't deserve a good tip. They should be happy I tip them at all. I give them shitty tips because that's what they deserve. So what do they do? LOL...they take it upon themselves to change the tip amounts. Most of us may not save our receipts to compare to our credit card statements, but I do! And I know how much I tip! Doubling and tripling my tip? You didn't think I'd notice?! This happened not once, not twice, but three times! Three strikes! I took the receipts back with my statements to let them know I know what they do, but that obviously didn't make them feel bad enough to stop this SHADY and illegal practice. They refunded the tips in cash, but still. It's fucking shady! They tried to make copies of my statements...are you kidding me? Fuck that!!! As shady as you are, you think I'ma give you more personal info on me? Can you imagine how much they've skimmed off their customers? A dollar or two or three...added on to several customer receipts, several times a day, several days a week...that shit adds up. \n\n*** SHADY!!! SHADY!!! SHADY!!! ***", "author": "Helen L."}

We ordered the following:\n\nPapaya Salad--I thought the papaya was too crunchy and did not have time to absorb the dressing.\n\nSpicy Basil Chicken--This dish was bland, had to spice it up with the generic hot sauce on the table.  The rice on the side was hard and tasted like it was reheated.\n\nOsha Spaghetti--Noodles were tossed with basil, bamboo shoots, tomatoes, and onions.  It was topped with the most anemic, tasteless chicken I have ever eaten.  The noodles were good but not worth the $12.95 price tag.\n\nThe food seemed watered down to appeal to a wide audience.

The differences between the noodles were that this was softer and it looked like green ramen.\n\nWhat is moroheiya? I googled it later and found out that it's a vegetable grown in thailand that has more minerals, vitamins, and dietary fiber than the common veggies. One serving has 32% of your daily dietary fiber, 20% vitamin A, and dot dot dot.

The portions were bigger, and the food IMO tasted better. \n\nThe last time we went to Osha before last nights visit, is probably about a year ago. Since then the signature dish we ordered was the spicy string beans with beef. Usually we order 2 of the same dish because we both enjoyed it THAT much. We would also occasionally order the squid balls. \nLast night the beef was so tough, it was like chewing on beef jerky. The string beans had a nice consistency. I ordered, and was charged extra for tofu. Of course I wanted fresh tofu, and in my order I got fried tofu. Really? Oh wells, we took it to-go so I couldn't send it back to the kitchen. \nThe squid balls were funky.

I'm polite, so I had my food boxed up to go rather than leaving 3/4 of it on my plate like some people, but I definitely will not be ordering that in the future. \n\nTo be fair, my friends' dishes - pad thai and this noodle dish that looked and tasted like pad thai except with different noodles - were pretty good.

I had the veggie tom kha soup which would have been great if they did not add scallions to it. Then I had some spring rolls which were supposed to be appetizers for everyone but there were only three of them and they were tiny. But hey they were good. Then we had some yellow curry chicken with jasmine rice which was pretty delicious. We topped dinner off with fried bananas and coconut ice cream which brought these guys back up to four stars for me.

Place seemed clean and lots of good light with giant windows and a corner location. Certain amount of homeless activity outside though, as this place is on the edge of the Tenderloin.\n\nThe soup broth was creamy and super-rich. Unbelievably delicious. However there were several slices of tough/inedible lemon grass inside, and the chicken, even though soaking in the liquid, was kind of tough. Should have been cooked differently before being added to the soup.\n\nThe spring rolls were odd. I am a fresh spring roll aficionado and have tried them at probably a hundred restaurants. This was the first time I'd had them wrapped with something other than rice paper. The wrappers were an opaque thick egg-noodle type sheet. It wasn't unpleasant... just unexpected... and a little odd. The ingredients inside were fresh, the presentation nice, and the peanut dipping sauce was good too.\n\nI was served by two different people -- neither who made any effort to connect with me... to smile or be extra-nice. But they were efficient enough, and I can't really complain about the service. I just like waitstaff who seem to want me to be happy...\n\nSo overall... I'm not sure if I'd go back. I didn't really have a bad experience, but nothing was so compelling to urge me to go back.  Reviews say they're open very late. Maybe that would be a better time to come by when my standards were a little lower -- than for a workday lunch.", "author": "Zoe H."}

The dark wash on the benches, the large windows, the friendly and attentive staff, that all appealed to me. I even enjoyed the chicken wing appetizer we ordered as the chicken was crispy and succulent, and the sweet and sour sauce offered at delectable accompaniment. I'd say it was good, but not great. The problem for me was the entree. I ordered a pad thai-like dish that was supposed to contain soft shell crab, but there really wasn't any to be found. Given the price, I was rather disappointed.

It's funny, a lot has changed since then, and we're now in a city that is nearly thai'd up with too many Osha outposts. And while there is something to be said for the sleek and modern aesthetic in their newer spots, this Geary one is a classic and reminds you of why Osha is so successful in the first place: pretty darn thai-riffic Thai food. \n\nI can pass judgment on a Thai establishment based on how they prepare their pad thai and pad see ew dishes, and Osha has it down pat. My group also dove into their Angel Wings, a nice and crispy rendition of chicken wings with a tangy, sweet sauce all over them. \n\nSo while I have yet to be at this location during daylight hours, I can tell you this with some authority: If you're looking to thai one on after a night of revelry, the original Osha will satiate and satisfy even the most thai-tanic of appethaites. \n\nAnd by the by: If you don't care for my puns, that's just too bad 'cause it's my party and I'll thai if I want to.", "author": "Nish N."}

This is one of the earliest locations, you know, before it became a big deal to serve everything on soup spoons and in delicate little piles atop rectangular plates. Before the razzle dazzle decor of the Marina and Embarcadero locations. \n\nConveniently parked between the border of Tenderloin and Nob Hill, down the street from Ambassador and Rye, this grubby place manages to stay fairly packed from open to close. During the daytime there are many a family that dine here with their children, and as nightfall comes and goes, the crowd gets quickly replaced by drunk people looking for some quick grub. \n\nThey've raised the prices over the years and the rice dishes remain inconsistently hotter than the noodle plates, but there's still a certain satisfying quality to eating here with your fellow wasted friends. Big steaming bowls of soup, plates mounded full of rice noodles, and coconut-rich creamy curries. Who cares if you look like you were run over by a bus with too long a night out on the town and one too many rounds at the bar? Everyone else is just as weary-eyed, loud-mouthed, and sloshed as you. Service is always fast and to the point. The long, thick, dark wooden tables easily fit small and large parties of people. \n\nThe downside is there is only one bathroom and it's unisex. I still remember the night when one poor drunk was swaying, his hand over his mouth, his head bowed. His friend was holding him up by his arm, both of them desperately waiting for the bathroom to empty so he could clear his stomach. But the person inside took a long time, and the guy couldn't hold it any longer. Out everything spewed against the door and floor. Finally, when he was done retching his guts out, the door finally opened and the surprised bathroom patron had the ugly task of trying to step back into the dining area without stepping on the goo. \n\nTo the staff's credit, they cleared the mess away pretty quickly. \n\nJust another rowdy night at Osha.", "author": "ChiYan T."}

It's location near the TL isn't that appealing, nor is the ambience/decor, but the food does it justice.\n\nEverything on the menu is between $9-15 (avg of $11) so don't be fooled into thinking it's a cheap/pricey Thai spot. It's right in between.\n\nIt was a freezing July day in SF so I had to get some jasmine tea. To my dismay, they came out with it in a tea packet that I had to open and make myself with the hot unfiltered water. I was not happy to see that. At least make it for me, it's a restaurant. But the brand they used was really tasty at least.\n\n* Tom Kha Noodles - Spicy coconut soup lemongrass, galangal and bean sprouts. It was way too sweet. The ingredients were high quality, but at least make it coconutty/sour and not like eating a jolly rancher. 2 star.\n\n* Osha Spicy Dice - Salmon, red chili paste, coconut milk, string bean and crispy basil. The coconut milk and chili paste made it perfect. The fish was cooked perfectly and was extremely tender. Even the veggies were perfect in this sauce mix.

This location differs a little bit since it is segregated into different rooms (seating/bar/private room) unlike the 2nd street location where it's one big room, so the noise level is much better.

Service is always friendly and quick, even though we had a large party.\n\nWe made reservations for new year's eve and got the private room since we had 16 people. The room is beautiful from the amazing chandeliers to the large wooden table that can easily seat 20+ people with plenty of eating space. Excellent place to have a large party. The only downside is the restroom is on the other side of the whole restaurant by the bar so its a bit of a walk.\n\n- Crab Wontons: too creamy, but lots of crab meat, crispy\n- Grilled Sea Bass: delicious! soft, good portion, sauce is a bit salty and tangy, bok choy good, and comes with coconut rice", "author": "Linda C."}

My girlfriend takes one and takes a bite- I hear a crunching sound like she's chewing on rocks. \nI look up at her as she's pulling little pieces of glass out of her mouth and hands them to me. she was bleeding from the gums and complained that something was stuck in her throat. \nOne of the waiters accidentally walked by just as she pulled the glass pieces out of her mouth and he saw the whole thing and was very apologetic and asked if we wanted new spring rolls to which of course I said no thanks... \nAt this point we should have probably left but I've never had a bad OSHA expiernce before so we decided to stay for the rest of the dishes. \n\nNext came the Tom Kah soup which was as good as ever, we shared that and then came the spicy dice.\nWe took one bite of the salmon only to realize that it was obviously old and rotten. Salmon is the one fish that's not supposed to taste fishy. And it was really really fishy. Gross. \n\nWe finished up the soup told them about the rotten fish and asked for the check. \nThey brought out the check on which they had taken off the spring rolls  and given us a 10% discount on the spicy dice + soup.\nSeriously?? 10% discount for glass in your food? \nWe paid and left. \n\nNext day I wrote an email to the general osha management explaining the situation to which I never got a reply..\n\nFor the next week my girlfriend was experiencing pain in her throat - undoubtedly because she had been cut by a piece of glass from the spring rolls.\n\nThat's my review.\nBon appetite.", "author": "Adam O."}

The service was ok - they were attentive if you waved them down as they are a busy joint.\n\nI'd definitely come back, especially since it's so close to my home.  \n\nOne tip:  If you're going to order a spicy dish, \"medium\" spicy had me sweating and my boyfriend was sweating too (his tolerance is higher than mine) - so make sure you know what your spicy tolerance is.

The service, food, everything was normal, but when I tried to pay the server came back and explained that the other server charged my table with another guests card and I would be paying for the other table....but they would fix it for me. It was a little confusing but I decided to just leave it alone and then when the receipt came I just decided not to tip. There's no RULE anywhere that you HAVE to tip. I get up to leave and all of a sudden when I'm halfway up the block I hear someone yelling \"sir!! Excuse me sir!!\" It was the server....and he said to me \"you forgot to leave us a tip!

It is hard to beat, as they use duck, a favorite of mine, and balance the flavors beautifully.  If I am at another Thai restaurant I will seek it out and try it to compare, and Osha's is hands down the best.  If I were on the food network show \"the best thing I ever ate\" and Thai, or noodle dishes were the theme, This dish would be it!  \n\nThat being said, I have not had a bad food experience here in numerous visits.  Everything I have eaten has been delicious.  Service, quick, and friendly, and they are open late.

When I come here, I always have to get at least the pineapple fried rice and a Thai iced tea.

I really liked the interior, but after about 10 minutes I didn't. The wooden seats were uncomfortable and the music was terrible.  I prefer Asian lounge music with my Thai food, not booty poppin' rap beats. \n\nService was much slower at this location. I don't think dining parties who arrive after yours should get their food before you and your buddies.  All three people in another dining party who arrived after us got their food first - not fair!  Ten minutes later, soup comes out for one person in my dining party. Within the next 5 minutes, 3 pad Thais come out one by one for the rest of my party. It would be nice if all our food came out together like that other table. I know I keep talking about that \"other\" table. Okay, you caught me; maybe I'm a little jealous. I just wish I had the 3.5 star experience it looked like they had. \n\nFor now, I'll probably continue to frequent the Glenn Park location instead.  Their service is lightning speed, food portions appear larger, and free parking is much more accessible.  The pad Thai portion at the Geary Street location looked much smaller; there were more sprouts and less noodles here than at the Glenn Park location.  This makes me sad.

Osha is open much later than the majority of Thai restaurants in SF. \n\n2) Food. The prawns are huge, deveined and very delicious! The Thai food served here uses finely chopped garlic and other aromatic ingredients such as basil, cilantro and fish sauce just to name a few, the flavors in the food are authentic so don't let the abundance of sweet sauce deter you from trying this location's great food prepared by these skillful chefs and cooks. While this particular Osha location does have a tendency to prepare some of their dishes overly sweet e.g., Angel Wings and the Salmon dish too, however this is not a reason to not come to this location because the food they serve actually is really, really good--so keep in mind that there is a workaround in case you prefer your Thai food less sweet--you can just order the dish's sauce on the side and dip your food into the sauce that way you can choose your own personal level of how much of the restaurant's special Osha sweet and sour sauce you prefer to have with your meal, otherwise the baseline seems to be a substantial amount of extremely sweet special sauce. Also, if you love eggplant be sure to ask for extra eggplant in your dish ($2 extra) because some of their dishes that have eggplant as a component don't add too many pieces so it's worth requesting extra eggplant in your dish so that you will be sure to have at least 10 pieces and be fully satisfied because Osha's eggplant is very delicious as well. \n\n3) Customer service. The Osha employees are kind and really great even the dishwasher is all smiles and friendly too! If you interact with these hard working employees giving them the utmost respect that they all deserve, they will treat you even more respectfully. They genuinely care about cultivating customer loyalty and ensuring that their customers (new ones too!) are enjoying their meal before/during/after your dining experience at Osha. Even when it gets really busy in the restaurant, I am so impressed by how professional, warm and friendly the staff all is even in the most hectic busy times, you can't help but leave the restaurant a little bit happier due to the kind demeanor of the great staff and relaxed atmosphere of this restaurant. \n\nAfter eating at Osha, you'll come to see for yourself this restaurant's recipe of success still going strong by going above and beyond for almost two decades now of providing great food and service to us all here in SF.", "author": "C K."}

Osha Thai is a dependable yet unimpressive chain of restaurants (6 in SF) to get your Thai grub.\n\nThis Osha Thai is a two room restaurant. One room feel like a casual lunch are while the other room is a dining hall that affords larger group seating. It has its trademark designy dish ware yet this location has its own eclectic interior design touches such as the big red flower painting.\n\nThe food, like I said, isn't the star player here. Despite the fashionable atmosphere it's mostly the convenience factor that will pull you in. Dishes range from $9-18. I had the chicken Tom Yum Noodle Soup (Hot & Sour soup, chili paste, lemon grass, lime juice, bean sprouts). You get to choose the level of spiciness and type of noodle. I went with a medium level of spice with rice noodles.\n\nWhen it came out it was decently sized dish for one person. I have to remind myself that most Thai restaurants usually serve dry precooked chicken. My dish was good but man was it hot! After each bite I chugged three big gulps of water. I couldn't believe how hot it was. If this was medium then what was hot? I took whatever was leftover home. I was mostly full off of drinking so much water. I don't blame Osha Thai, but if you're afraid of spice I'd encourage you to stick away from it in this restaurant.\n\nMy friends' dishes looked good. They didn't complain of any blazing flames shooting from their tongues. I felt like a wimp! Haha. Next time I'll stick away from the volcanoes.\n\nWhen I got home I tried eating my lukewarm leftovers since I was still hungry. Sometimes spicy food tastes a like hotter when its temperature is warm or hot. This was still magma on my tongue! Somehow I finished it with the help of orange juice. I can't really talk about how it tastes since it's so hot. Hot and sour? YES.\n\n_____\n\nDependable, fair, and comfortable. Service is good too. Just don't expect much else.", "author": "Michael H."}

The duck meat and bits of fat just bind it all together. Tom yum could use more spice and acidity, but the fish cakes are like potato chips that I uncontrollably pop into my mouth. Spicy eggplant, is indeed spicy, while the eggplant absorbs all the flavor of the dish has to offer. The squid salad is not shy- there are delightful pieces of squid in every chopstick or fork-full.

My boyfriend and I chose to visit the Geary location instead of the Embarcadero location because we were going to shop at Union Square after lunch. The Geary location is closer to Union Square so we thought it would be best to dine here. BIG MISTAKE! Although we found parking on the street, we had to pay $2.00 just to park for an hour. Not only was it a bit expensive but it was an inconvenience for us because it meant that we only had an hour to enjoy our meal. \n\nWe finally entered the restaurant and to my surprise it did not look like it did on the website. The restaurant was filthy and not aesthetically pleasing. We were not greeted with a friendly welcome by the waitress who was working. She seated us near the back, next to the smelly bathroom and I was not happy. I kindly asked if we may seat somewhere else and she rolled her eyes like it was such a big inconvenience for her.\n\nSo I ordered the spicy eggplant w/ duck dish and my boyfriend ordered the fried prawns dish.

It was relatively empty apart from the handful of drunken costumed patrons. Ordered pork with sticky rice (tasty), raw prawns (also tasty) and something else I don't remember. Maybe noodles. Clearly unremarkable. Asked for an order of rice and 2 rice bowls. Food comes, no rice/bowls (the bf is super Chinese and refuses to eat Asian food without rice. In a bowl). Flag down our waiter to ask for rice again. He's all like, whatever whatever ok. Waiting. Waiting. Flag him again. Ok, ok. (Again, there's maybe 3 other parties in the whole restaurant). Waiting. Try to flag him for the 3rd time and he's gone AWOL. Boyfriend goes up to the counter to inquire about the whereabouts of the rice and bowls (Fact: it has to be within a 20 foot radius). The woman at the register yells at him and demands he return to our table (W.T.F). A few minutes later, rice is unceremoniously tossed on our table. On a plate. Most likely to spite us.   \n\nAs I said, food is ok but is on the pricey side. Osha is simply, dirty Tenderloin Thai food with awful service.

Lots of restaurants you ask them to make it spicy and you have to end up dousing it in hot sauce. With Osha, this is not the case. And even if you do like yours to be spicier, the hot chili oil is there on the table for your convenience.\n\nAlso, Tom Kha soup is amazzzing! Great light consistency and rich flavor.

My hint for ordering: anything with the name Osha Thai in the name. The Osha Thai Tom Yum was probably my favorite, Spicy and sour, the tom yum will definitely stand out as a distinct Osha Thai dish. The garlic lamb chops were infused with a lemongrass dressing so it was a great Thai fusion dish. I also really liked the crab fried rice, chunks of crab claws were tossed in that dish, definitely worth the price!\n\nOne word of warning though, this location is on the seedier side when compared to other Osha's as it's really close to the TL. The seats are uncomfortable and the bathroom is rather scarily graffiti'ed. The service is great though, I think this is the only spot I've seen Thai people congregate at in SF...hmmm......", "author": "Annie B."}

This joint is opened untill 3am and so many people come here after the club. I tasted 3  dishes, the fried chicken with fried rice, the red curry salmon with green beans and basil and the shrimp pad thai.\n\nI really enjoyed the red curry salmon. The salmon was not overcooked and tasted like it was saturated in the red curry sauce.  They used fresh basil leaves which was very fragrant  in the dish. The salmon was cut into bite size peices which  added  a different  appearance to  most salmon dishes that I have tasted. \nThe fried chicken needed salt! I do not like salt in my dishes because of sodium issues, but the chicken tasted like it was batter, chicken and oil. There was no taste to it. The fried rice seemed like it was cooked hours ago and they just warmed it up before it was served to me at the table.\nMy girls ordered the shrimp pad thai, which had a generous portion of  shrimp.I was really impressed. The bean sprouts looked like it had  a little air exposure, they were not as fresh looking or crunchy for what I am familiar with. The pad thai tasted like it  was missing an ingredient or two . It was a little bland. Maybe a little more fish sauce or dried chili pepper would have made  it more tasty.\nThe Service SUCKS at OSHA!!  They forgot my girl's thai ice tea and  they made me wait 7 minutes after they brought out everyone's dish at my table beside mine. I was on the verge of cancelling my order!\n\nIf you  are looking for a last resort  for asian food after a night of partying and drunkeness at 2am, then go to the Osha Thai Noodle cafe, otherwise I would rather have  ate   a terriyaki bowl at Jack N the Box!", "author": "Nyla J."}

The plus about this place as opposed to others in the neighborhood is that it's open until 3am. \n\nTheir green papaya salad is very salty, and it has a viscous quality to it which makes it seem less fresh. They give you a lot of big fat peanuts and toasted garlic, but there were no noticeable fresh herbs involved. \n\nThe barbequed chicken actually made me mad. It's PLAIN GRILLED skinless sour-tasting dry chicken served with a sweet, insipid dipping sauce over two tons of  white rice. The barbequed chicken I've had at other Thai restaurants is always marinated and char-grilled with skin on. The sauce is not required to produce bbq flavor. I seriously thought about sending this back because based on my experience with Thai bbq chicken it was bad.\n\nI'm not sure if I didn't just order wrong, but the pedestrian quality of the bbq chicken was a disappointment. I have enjoyed their curries here before and wished I hadn't changed my mind and ordered the bbq chicken. \n\nThey're fairly nice here, but for $20 I'll head to Chai-Yo where the food is far fresher and better seasoned, in my opinion.", "author": "Roxmarie M."}

We promptly asked to be moved.  \n\nWe couldn't make up our minds between two entrees we were both eyeing, so I asked about getting half orders of each.  \"Uh uh, not possible\", said our server.

My friend likes his food spicy, really spicy.  But the waiter didn't ask our preferences and scuttled away before we could let him know.\n\nI swear it was less than 5 minutes and our food arrived - ALL of the food, including our \"spicy\" mango starter salad which didn't have a shred of mango anywhere.  The noodles in both dishes had that sad wilty look like they'd been sitting around for a while, and they tasted as such as well.\n\nI can't say that anything was good.

Its more simple and modern in decor (no random buddha items/mom and pop decor) \n\nMost important was the food which was very good. My group got the crab fried rice I heard so much about as well as the pad se ew, chicken satay, and duck curry.  To drink we got a thai tea, a singha and sapporo served in pilsner glasses which I appreciate more than a mug...makes it \"classier\", i suppose. \n\nThe crab fried rice was make with real crab meat complete with claws. No imitation meat here. It was a bit greasier than I would've liked but had a right amount of spice and an abundance of meat. So Im sold. \n\nDuck curry was excellent. Nice curry: it was creamy with a hint of spice. The gaminess of the duck did well with the curry but I found myself more enamored with the curry on its own. However, the thing I didnt like was the pineapple. Maybe Im just not as big a pineapple fan as I thought, but I dont think it melded well with the curry. I ate around it. \n\nThe chicken satay was a bit drier than I liked. The pad se ew was ok, but not a favorite and not really that memorable for that matter. \n\nSo I do recommend this place as a cozy little nook to get a good bite to eat late.

I had actually been here before many years ago with a friend who lived in the city. We only got drinks and some apps so I didn't get a full spectrum on the meal itself until now.\n\nI had to pick up a friend from the airport who's husband couldn't manage to miss one baseball game to come and get her (lame) anyway, my husband offered to take me to dinner and go with me. Wonderful! He suggested a few places but I kept hearing him rave about a Thai place by his work so I suggested it, so glad I did!\n\nWe went and it wasn't too busy but busy enough so you could tell it was good. The decor was simple but I loved the tables for the large groups and the pillows. Many people came and ate alone which was comforting to know that people feel confident to do that! We didn't get an appetizer but ordered the basil beef, green curry with chicken, and spicy pad thai with pork. The food came with Jasmine rice which was cooked so perfect it melted in your mouth. The noodle dish was one the best I have ever had and the beef and curry dishes had such amazing flavor! \n\nThe food did come quickly just like other reviews have said however this is the reason I did not give the place 5 stars. My husband and I literally sat and spoke maybe 10 words after order before the food came out. I tend to like to chat a bit before delving into a meal and if that's your preference as well then make sure you don't go here when you're wanting that. It was prompt, the service was good and everything tasted very good. The dishes could have been spicier. We did order the Spicy noodle dish and I couldn't even tell it was spicy at all.

The dishes here will fill any cravings!\n\nI came here after clubbing with my friend based on the following simple yet sometimes difficult parameters- it had to be delicious and open after 2am! Osha-our first thought. Usually there's a line around that time because everyone's trying to cooldown off their buzz, but we got there a bit earlier and beat the line and got seated right away. The staff seem to be really well trained in dealing with a crowd so they can turn tables faster, which explained how we got our waters from another waiter immediately as the first one seated us and we were given suggestions for that evening. \n\nWe ordered the Angel Wings, pineapple fried rice and the Osha Tom Yum noodles (medium). The wings claim to be crispy, but after being served in the house sauce they soften up a bit; that's the only gripe I have, otherwise these wings are great- large portions and the house sauce that resembles a tamarind glaze makes this dish an amazing starter! Even the crispy basil garnish is delicious! The pineapple fried rice and tom yum noodles are both dishes you have to at least one of when you come here. The cooks seem to always have a really loose hand when it comes to adding in the chicken, shrimp and veggies and the subtle pineapple essence really pulls the whole dish together; always with a welcoming slight sweet taste. The osha  tom yum noodle dish is a combination of sour and spice, something you don't get often, but is an incredible combination. I would normally get simply the broth, but for just a few more dollars you can get the noodles complete with a large portion of meat, fish balls and veggies, which in the soup really absorb the all the tom yum flavor.\n\nThis place has yet to disappoint, if you're looking for really good Thai food, check this place out; if you're not sure what to eat go to Osha's on Geary!!!\nSome of the most delicious and unforgettable Thai dishes I've ever had have been from this restaurant.", "author": "Jon K."}

When we finally found it, it turned out to look more like a diner than a thai place. Once inside the decor was a bit odd to me as well. Strange white, plastic, art decor looking chairs filled the mainly black dining area. The environment was not too inviting. \n\nAnyways, this place is not bad as far as the food goes.  Out of all the dishes we got in our group, the Spicy Dice was definitely the best. The salmon was perfectly cooked and was well complemented by the curry type sauce. The dish I ordered for myself was the Duck Noodle Soup. I felt that both the duck and the broth were a bit plain. This of course was saved by the fact that the serving size was huge. \n\nThis place seems like a great spot for some quick thai food if you're from the area. I definitely would not go out of my way to go here as there are far better and cheaper places for thai.", "author": "Jeff C."}

After a long day of wine tasting in Napa we went back to the hotel and sobered up and then she was like well what's for dinner and I knew I wanted to go try Osha.  I had a few friends tell me it was fun, good drinks and great Thai so we walked about 4 blocks and into Osha we went.\n\nIt was a Saturday night about 9pm and we were surprised to be seated right away - there were tons of large parties and we were seated right by the bar.  The restaurant is very nightclubby.  Young waiters with hip hair cuts carrying trendy looking drinks and all to techno music.  It was a fun vibe.\n\nThe food was very good.  We decided to get Spring Rolls, beef rolls and then for our main dishes Scallops and Pad Thai of course.  Because we both drank a bit too much in the afternoon we stuck with something with a kick - Thai Ice Teas.  The flavors of our food were authentic and spiced just right.

Although the decor or location is not to par with the others - namely 2nd fav Embarcadero location, this one is the one my friends and I have been going to for about 10yrs.  My then friend (now husband), introduced my friends and I to this restaurant way back in the day.  We came here after the club, on Sunday afternoons, and just because we were starving for Thai food.\n\nWe always start off with the papaya salad (which in my culture is slightly different from the Thai version - ours have a shrimp paste).   Then we have the usual - and this NEVER changes - beef phad see yu, fried chicken over fried rice, osha sea curry, and green chicken curry (you can never have enough curry) - with sticky rice (gotta have sticky rice!).  And like clockwork, everything comes out within 10 minutes or less.  All dishes are hot, fresh off the stove, and delicious, full of flavor.  We always ask for \"spicy\" and when we do, it means Thai spicy, not taco bell spicy (hey, we're southeast asians - gotta represent).  Of course, the staff always looks at us like we're crazy.  Just because we're not Thai, doesn't mean we don't know spicy.\n\nParking is always crazy but if you circle around a few times within the two block radius, you're sure to find someone leaving or a vacant spot.  Pricing here is better than the other locations.  Food is served faster.  Last time we were there, there still wasn't any cocktails on the menu but at least there is beer now.  The staff has been the same forever - they are like robots sometimes.  They seat you, take your order, bring out the food, etc... that's about as friendly as they get.  I really don't recommend this place for a fancy nite on the town or a large group.

But, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThere was funky odor emanating from god-knows-where when I entered, which I feared was a bad omen.  I had intended to hit Bang San on O'Farrell, but it closed early, and Osha Thai is open until a comfortable 1a during the week and a whopping 3a on Friday and Saturday.  Because it labels itself as a \"noodle house,\" I opted for the Pad Kee Mao.\n\nNow, I take my Pad Kee Mao slightly different than the average Joe.  First, it has to be vegetarian, with no oyster sauces or shrimp pastes.  As always, I like my PKM spicy (which so few places are able to manage).  I also prefer the thin rice noodles over the fat ones typically used for PKM and Pad See Ew.  I'm amazed to say this, but this was among the best PKM's I've had anywhere.  It was perfectly spiced, with just enough bite to elicit some pain, but not so much that I couldn't taste the rainbow dancing on my tongue.  Despite its description, there were many vegetables gracing the dish, and it was not greasy at all.  As much as it pains me to say it, Osha did a better job on my PKM than Modern Thai has in the past.  I liked that PKM so much, I wanted to take her home and spend the night with her.\n\nIt's definitely affection at first bite.  I hope the second date will prove as promising.\n\nThe staff was pleasant, if not reserved.   I had to stake out the waitress to tell her what a magnificent job she did with all of my tweaks..

I never tried papaya salad before, and I always thought that it was like the sweet papaya, but it was actually really refreshing. The texture is like turnip, but it soaks in a lot of taste from the salad dressing. I order a Barbecue chicken dish, which is nothing like the chicken that you drench in sweet and sour BBQ sauce. It turns out to be grilled chicken with BBQ sauce on the side. My friends like it though, as we cleaned up the plates.\n\nOne thing that I notice is that there are no pictures of the Thai King in the restaurant. That's actually a funny observation that my friend Ivan proclaimed, all Thai restaurants have a picture of the Thai leader put up.

I wlil say that the Chicken Satay was DEEELLLLIICCIOUS! Of course thanks to the dipping sauce it's served with. The Pineapple Fried Rice was good but a bit on the heavy on the oil side. The Pad See Ew Beef was the only complaint. Though the food came out quickly which was great.....the beef was undercooked, making it still slimy and chewy. Eew...won't be ordering THAT again.  However, the waiter took it off the bill and we had some dessert. I had to have the mango sticky rice and we got a side of Coconut Ice Cream.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-03-12", "description": "Osha's wonderful location makes it great for a late eat or just a casual lunch with friends. While I'm not always up for eating spicy Thai after a hard night of drinking (it's open till 3 on the weekends), I like having my options open. Located right on Geary street between two bar areas, (union square and Polk street) they serve practically priced Thai food that is worth every penny. \n\nAt Osha, it really doesn't matter what you like, you will find something on the menu to make your pallet happy. While I'm not a big fan of vegetarian or seafood dishes, I find myself ordering them, trying to find a dish that I dislike. It might just be impossible. I think the best part about the food is that take out does not effect the quality. It is very hard to find any restaurant where the take out is as good as when you sit in, but Osha is definitely one of them. Since I work graveyard shift at a hostel 6 days a week, it's great to be able to get late night take out that isn't going to leave me feeling gross or on the toilet for 45 minutes after I get off my shift.\n\nIf you really only care about how good the food is at a restaurant, you should probably stop reading the review and pretend I gave Osha 4 stars. Get some Osha take out and love it. The food is amazing for the price and it is prepared at lightning speed, but almost everything else about this small restaurant is far from perfect. The inside is cramped, unappealing to the eye and uncomfortable. If there is a line, sitting near the door is beyond annoying. The wooden booths and the plastic cafeteria chairs need to go. The late night waiters are quick, but unfriendly. I guess it does make sense when you have a line out the door of 15 drunk people, 50 minutes before you close and at every table you goto keeps you answering the same question over and over again:\n\n\"Can I get a Sierra Nevada?\"\n\"No, it's past 2 am so we can no longer sell alcohol.\"\n\"Common, please? Just one? I'll give you a nice tip. No make it two. my friend John probably wants one too... He's taking a piss right now. He'll be back and I know he'll want one if he sees me with one.\"\n\"no, I'm sorry we cannot sell alcohol this late.\"\n\nTo keep on topic, the drunk people. Yeah I get it. Who goes to a Thai place late after the bars have closed and expects there not to be drunk people, huge lines at the bathroom and to be able to have a calm conversation with your friend. I get it. But It's annoying when the girl in the booth next to you pukes. You kind of loose your apatite (you also kinda laugh. Bet that hot Thai puke feels great up your nose. Owned.) If you think you can handle the atmosphere, it is still the best late night bite. \n\nTo clarify, Great food, small place. I'd advise going for lunch. Same great food, a lot more relaxed, and an unrushed waitstaff. Take out is always perfect. Can't go wrong with their curry.", "author": "Zane C."}

One place we never get tired of is Osha.  Sure, it's in the middle of the Tenderloin, and sure, my cousin got mugged right in front of restaurant while we were waiting for a table, but it's a really great place to eat.\n\nFor an appetizer, I recommend the Dressed Prawns or the Duck Rolls.  They are full of flavor and a great starter.  For an entree, there are so many to choose from.  The Volcano Beef is great if you like meat, the Pad See Ewe (chicken) is delicious, the Pad Thai is comforting, and the various curries are all pretty damn good.

With some friends, wanted a fairly fast, inexpensive dinner so we had food in our stomachs in preparation for a night of boozing. Walked in, saw plenty of empty tables, yet we had to wait for 20 minutes. Hmmm. Plus, and this may sound weird, but the floors were super slippery as if they had been recently waxed, and I swear to God we thought we were gonna break our necks when as we navigated towards the table.\n\nBut, all turned rosy from this point on. The menu's great, with so much good stuff to choose from. Service is attentive and fast, and the chicken and shrimp with silver noodle dish I got was top-notch. My friends thoroughly enjoyed their meals too, and it really is high quality Thai for not much moola. Osha did us right that night; it was exactly what we were looking for, and I would definitely go back in a heartbeat. Wearing rock climbing shoes.", "author": "Drew S."}

I felt like i was invisible to the waitstaff for most of the dining experience.  At one point i had to hold myself back from actually throwing a scrap of food at one of the waitresses just to get her to look at me.  I know, i know, i totally shouldnt be allowed out of the house. \n\nSo we order our food and it literally comes out 3 minutes later almost like it had been sitting there all day and they were all back there going \"I sure hope someone orders the curry puffs today - should we just hold onto these and wait and see?  Hey!  Bob - those 2 drunks out there just ordered them!  Hell yeah, send them out!\"\n\nBut i cant complain about the food, it was pretty fucking bomb and it tasted better and better the more beer that i drank.  I also started feeling sexier.  If the food had been sitting there all day i couldnt tell, but as you all know by now, mine surely isnt the most sophisticated palate.\n\nMy lovely date almost knocked the entire table over on me right before we left which really capped the night off well, in my opinion.\n\nI would totally come back here again - its a great spot to come late at night with the love of your life , some person you're just hoping to stick it to once or twice and everyone in between.", "author": "Kirsten S."}

I'm not too concerned with \"authenticity\" since no matter where you are in the world, there are always good restaurants and bad ones.\n\nWIth that caveat, Osha would fall into the \"good\" category for me. As far as ingredients and taste, it reminds me of the foods I grew up with in Bangkok. Of course, portions in the US always seem double or triple of what you'd get in Bangkok. Osha serves a good range of what I'd call an \"everyday menu': pad thai, pad see ew, fried rice, noodle soup, fish cakes - all things readily found from street vendors and sidewalk eateries in Bangkok. For me, the marks of a good pad see ew are moist noodles and the use of chinese brocolli (pak kana) instead of American brocolli florets. And I appreciate that their Thai ice teas and ice coffees are rich and flavorful. \n\nNote: the menus at each of the Oshas around town are not quite the same. All the other branches seem to me to be more non-traditional (and more pricey) \"gourmet California Thai,\" which is fine if you're open to that and looking for those flavors.\n\nCan't beat the quick service; seems like they get the dishes to you in under 10 minutes after giving the order.

The food came out extremely quickly, and I was suprised to find that when they said the papaya salad was spicy, they actually meant it - most places kinda nod and roll their eyes and bring out the mild dish anyway. This, on the other hand, had my eyes running with tears of painful joy. The crab portion seemed to be an entire small crab (these suckers aren't big) and I had a fun interactive moment sucking, biting, and ripping out every single part of seafood flavored protein from its tiny body. I apologize to everyone else in the dining room. My only complaint: the portion size was pretty small, though I suspect this was meant to be an appetizer instead of a main dish. Thankfully, I'm not exactly a huge eater. \n\nThe day I went there, the place contained an alternating crowd of Thai diners and vaguely out of place cops, all ordering noodles and talking loudly. The wall are mirrored, which is somewhat awkward for me - how repulsive is it to watch yourself feed like some sort of giant carnivore anyway? The place is decently designed but it seems like little care is being taken to maintaining it. I was really suprised to find on Yelp that Osha has some sort of \"hip\" reputation, because that sure as hell wasn't my first reaction. I thought, \"Oh, look, a cheap dive with dodgy hygiene!\" (My standards for ambience are very low.) \n\nOh, and do visit the bathroom here: it's dirty and under-maintained but has a truly exciting degree of graffiti.

The cooks are super consistent: the food has always been good every time I've gone.  A good variety of the usual Thai dishes, plus a few more to keep things a little more interesting.

They also have a tv going on in the main room that's kind of entertaining.  Their background music is very 92.7FM, which makes the place seem a little triendier.  This is still the original spot of Osha that led to all the others, and I believe it is still cheapest out of all the Osha's, and still the best of all the others.  One other best thing about here: they're open late!  Definitely a great place to go when you feel hungry, even late!\n\nService: service is lukewarm (don't expect a conversation), but the staff are very quick with their work and efficiently get all of the orders fast.  They get you in and out of the restaurant pretty quickly, so not usually much waiting or lines.\n\nLocation: on a busy spot of Geary with lots of traffic.

A spoon to eat noodles with?... great. When I finally got the waitresses attention again and asked for a fork, it took her another 5 minutes just to bring my fork while my greasy noodles got cold.

Contemporary black boxy furniture (what you'll see from Ikea) is what will seat you and your party.The ambiance isn't the typical, after-clubbing grease joint. You'll find yourself surrounded by semi-well-dressed groups and couples. Occasionally, you'll be seated next to the obnoxious younger drunks. But, for the most part, the crowd is behaved. \n\nThe food is decent, but a little on the extra-greasy side (or so I've heard from the Osha in the Financial District). Expect to pay about $15/person for a decent sized dish and beverage. My favorite dish is the Fried Chicken served with sweet and sour sauce, on top of fried rice. My choice of beverage is the Thai Iced Tea (imagine Cold Tea mixed with condensed milk) (eh-hem: can you say diabetes?). Pad Thai is rather tasty, though, a little on the sweet side.\n\nOverall I give Osha a 4/5 because 5 is reserved for top-notch restaurants.

We'll start with the Geary location.  I order the Taro Rolls and the Tom Yum Soup.  The rolls were pretty good, a little greasy but that is to be expected for a fried item.  For their Tom Yum Noodle Soup I give them 1 star.  It was probably the worst I've had.  The broth was ok (though not very spicy), but the only thing they added to it was a couple of pieces of steamed chicken and some noodles and sprouts.  Blah.  I guess I just ordered the wrong thing.\n\nAt the SOMA location I had the Spicy Dice.  It was delicious almost 5 star worthy.  I had requested it spicy and still had to ask for extra chili because their idea of spicy and my idea of spicy weren't quite the same so it looses a star for that.  \n\nI will go back to Osha for the Spicy Dice (and order it super spicy) but it definitely won't be my thai restaurant of choice.

I wasn't so sure about the place because of the name. So I was a bit skeptical at first. Also, the place was not as clean as I wanted it to be and the host just shoved 8 of us in this small booth. So I'm thinking this place is just a regular restaurant that doesn't care too much about their food and service. After I got the food, I was AMAZED!!! Wow, it was delicious!!! I was so shocked at how wrong I was just from my first opinion about the place. Really tells you not to judge a bood by it's cover. \n\nI loved every dish we got. I really don't think you can go wrong with anything your order there. Every dish was ooh so Delicious! I was so FULL after my meal there. \n\nI would have given them 5 stars if the place was a bit cleaner,  have nicer bathrooms, and better service. \n\nIt is cheaper here than the other Osha Thai restaurants. But if you want the great food they serve in a nicer ambiance, you should try the Osha on 2033 Union St or the one on 149 2nd street.

So when I left SWIG last night and headed over to the one on Geary, I was disappointed in the sub-par service and quality of food.\n\nI was with a group of four others and we got seated immediately which is a plus but from there on out we had to flag down a waiter to order drinks, get more water, order our food, pay our bill and get our cards back.  This is surprising because this place is roughly a third of the size of the other location.  I got the same pad thai I had at SOMA and, forget the lack of presentation, it was just blah.  The only word that comes to mind is \"blah.\"  The other dishes chosen by the meat eaters didn't seem that appetizing as they looked greasy/soupy.  \n\nThe Osha in SOMA is so much cleaner, more spacious and has top-of-the-line service.

Anyway, we had a party of 11 so I was surprised to find out that we would get seated in 30-45 minutes.  WAIT...I take that back.  Thai places down here seat you pretty quickly since their food is literally fast food!  \n\nThe place looked a little decent for a 'hole in the wall' & they dishes were very contemporary for (again) a 'hole in the wall'.  I shared a BBQ chicken fried rice dish & a won ton soup with the BF & I have to say....it's pretty tasty!  Very similar to Banana Bay/Coconut bay down in the SGV (why am i abbreviating?  who knows) .  The portions were perfect for sharing (if you're sharing more than 1 dish) and the prices were very reasonable.  The Thai Iced Tea was superb & the staff was forgettable.  \n\nThe one thing that was very 'hole in the wall'-esque was the bathroom.  There's only 1, it smells like urine (but better urine than feces, right?!), there's barely any soap, and there's this closet door that's partially open but it's too dark to see what's inside.

The wings were tasty, but I found them a little sweet...  it didn't stop me from having 2 pieces, though.   \n\nThe papaya salad was very tasty.  I liked a lot, though I had to forgo the spicy crab it came with as I can't eat raw stuff right now.  Though it would have been hard to get at the meat I'd imagine.  The Tom Kha soup was very good with the combination seafood.  Broth was not at all oily like some places.  The seafood was abundant and the calamari was tender.  Very good.\n\nI really liked the green curry fried rice.   It had a good kick and oh so tasty with the bamboo shoots, green beans, and the prawns.   \n\nThe eggplant with beef had good flavor, though I thought the beef was overcooked.    The pad thai was okay.   I thought it was a little too sweet.  \n\nThe thai iced tea was excellent.

Seriously, the food here is fantastic and maybe because of its \"prime\" location, it's always cheaper than its off shoots (e.g. Embardero, Marina, Mission). As everyone else attests, great for after clubbing eating.\n\n- Beef Pad See Ew: they ran out of the fat rice noodles this time and subbed w/ the thinner linguine looking ones. Just as good.\n- Spicy Eggplant w/ Seafood: always a favorite dish, though this time I think we had way more seafood and not enough eggplant. The sauce from this dish is simply mouth watering on top of rice.\n- Fried Garlic & Pepper Pork: new dish, and maybe cuz I'm not a huge pork fan, this one didn't do it for me. But objectively, the pork was very tender and the fried garlic delivered a lot of flavor.\n\nI'm eager to go back for any of the fried rice dishes (e.g. Green Curry Fried Rice), Basil Leaf Chicken, and the Sticky Rice w/ Mango.

So me and my friends finally sat down and got a table after waiting for 15 minutes. So me and my GF had to use the bathroom and the waiter apparently told our guy friends that they have to order ASAP and fuck waiting for us since we are probably fucking each other in the bathroom or \"We're women who cares what we want to eat.. Just order anything for them\" So I guess this guy that I just met has no idea what a vegetarian or vegan is and decides to order every possible kind of meat on the menu.. LOL That's fine I get back and I told him he is still getting the tab. So I asked the waiter if there are anything vegetarian on the menu and he rolls his eyes and says\"NO.\" Okay you idiot that's fine. My friend then goes to another waitress and asks If there are anything vegetarian on the menu and she says yes everything can be made vegetarian. That is when everything went dark and black. I almost lost it. If it wasn't for the guys I was with I would have seriously grabbed all the plates on the table and slammed it to the ground. I asked to speak with the manager and they said he wasn't there when It's obvious that it's the little short old dude with the glasses just standing by the register watching everyone work.

Noodles, fried rice, and a variety of curries all taste the way they're supposed to.  Based on my visit, this is thankfully not Americanized Thai food -- it's flavorful and devilishly spicy if you ask for it (as I did).\n\nGreen curry fried rice with beef was a big winner.  I've had this dish before made in Thailand with condensed milk, and this used coconut milk instead to much better results.  The beef may have been a little tougher than I prefer, but it didn't detract my completely enjoying the dish.  Green curry taste, lots of basil, and since I asked for it Thai hot, lots of shredded Thai chillis.  Make sure you have a cold drink and a towel to wipe the sweat from your brow, but you'll enjoy every bite.\n\nFor dessert, we cooled down with fried banana and coconut ice cream which was perfect.  The fried banana was crunchy (as it should be), not soggy and the coconut ice cream was the perfect meal-ending fire extinguisher.\n\nThey're open 'til 1AM weeknights and 3AM on weekends, take credit cards, and dish up delicious food with friendly service.

Is it because they're drunk when they go here?\n\nThe food isn't bad, but the service leaves a lot to be desired.  \n\nFOR EXAMPLE:\n\nOne time a customer on her way out took a couple candies from the jar and in this really friendly voice said: \"Hey!  Thanks a lot!  Have a good night!\"  But what did the girl behind the counter do as soon as the customer's back was turned?  She started bitching about how much candy she took!  She was actually mimicking her by scooping up two giant handfulls of candy and going on and on about it (which was a huge exaggeration by the way.  The woman took like 3 candies.)  \n\nAnyway, it was such a turn off that I would have gone somewhere else if I hadn't ordered already.  (FYI:  Bitching about your customers in front of your other customers is something you should pretty much never do.  All it does is leave us thinking, \"Hmm...  I wonder what they'll say about me when I leave?\")\n\nIf this was an isolated incident, then that would be one thing, but attitude seems to be a trend here...\n\nAnother time I asked if they could leave the chicken off my Pad Thai and give me some extra prawns or something instead, and the guy got all snotty with me and said, \"Well, we have to charge you an extra dollar for that.\"  \n\nI was immediately sorry I'd gone there again, but hey!  How did I expect them to act, right?  Plus, prawns do cost a little more so the price difference seemed normal at first.......\n\nHere's the thing though:  Guess how many extra prawns I got?  \n\nLIKE ONE!!!!  \n\nI've ordered that dish there many times before, so I knew what to expect, and I pretty much quit going there after that.  I only really go there if they're the only thing open.

There are several Osha's located around the city, but this location is extremely convenient due to the fact that it is a mere block from my apartment. The Osha in the Embarcadero is my absolute favorite, the vibe is a tad bit classier, having an extensive specialty cocktail menu and a posh lounge in which patrons can relax at the end of an exhausting work day. However, the convenience of the Osha neighboring my home is familiar and has catered to my hunger needs more than any of their other locations.  The Beer is always cold, glasses are always chilled, food is consistently great, and service is always quick and friendly. \n\nI have had many of various dishes on Osha's menu but I have a few favorites that I consistently seem to run back to. For appetizers I love the fried pork and vegetable wontons with a sweet and sour dipping sauce or the vegetarian Crispy rolls stuffed with silver noodles, black mushrooms, cabbage and carrots with a plum dipping sauce. For my main course my favorite dish would have to be the Osha spicy pan fry, a simple yet delicious egg noodle dish adorned with mushrooms, tomatoes, basil, garlic, bamboo, Chinese broccoli, bell pepper, onion, and string beans. I order this dish medium spicy along side a nice frosty Asahi; guaranteed to please your taste buds and clear out your sinuses fabulousness! My second go-to dish is the spicy basil leaf which comes with any meat assortment of your choice (prawns, seafood, duck, stir fried chicken, pork or beef) mixed with fresh chili's, garlic and basil leafs all atop a bed of white rice. I order this dish with beef, medium spicy with a sprinkle of soy sauce, so scrumptious! If I have room for desert I absolutely have to have the fried bananas with coconut ice cream, the ice cream actually has chunks of coconut throughout, mmmmm!!!\n\nIf you order from the dishes I listed above you can't go wrong, in my opinion these are some of the best on the menu. The only thing I should warn patrons of is the variations of spicy that the chef dishes out; medium spicy can either be mild or tongue numbing hot! I suggest ordering less spice than you think you can handle and then adding more if needed from the condiment trays located on each table to insure the proper heat. I usually order food from this location for pick-up; no matter how busy the venue, my food is always ready within fifteen minutes.

They really should upgrade the restroom.\n\nSomething that's really irritating and deceitful about this establishment.... Ok they charge you (15 or 18%) tip if you have 6 or more people in your party.  Totally understandable.  However, if you pay with your credit card...when you get the credit card bill there's a line for adding tip and since they dont give you the original bill with the credit card slip you could end up paying for tip twice if you don't pay attention.  It's robbery!  I feel bad for all the people who've been duped and the many more who will be!  So pay attention people!\n\nFood's good here, but they need to do something about that billing issue.

The waitstaff was neither a plus or a minus, they really made no impression on me, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\nMy favorite out of the dishes we tried was the tom yum soup with egg noodles.  The green beans were also pretty good.  There was not really a bad thing that we tried. \n\nThe only reason I give it three stars instead of four is that it was not the cleanest place I've ever eaten.  We got there right as it opened one day and the floor hadn't been swept from the previous day.

Third dude. . .smooth as silk as he got to second base right in front of us!  Can anyone say petrie dish?  Then there was the couple who came out of Rye.  The dude lays on the ground (someone should have told him that the particular part of Geary Street he was laying on is sometimes known as \"A River Runs Through It\" . .. as in a river of urine) and his girl or hook up or whatever starts cracking up and then she straddles him and they go all Kevin and Britney on the beach back in the day.   And what's up with all the smokers hanging in second doorway at Osha?  They've got a cage in Rye for y'all nicotine addicts . . stay in the cage, dammit, your cigarette smoke is coming into the restaurant and it's nasty.

Panang curry with beef is also a hit. \n\nService is good given all the customers they have to tend to. Expect to drive at 20-30 minutes to find parking.

But over last couple months, Ive been to Osha-Tenderloin with a good friend and our service has been TERRIBLE, food quality not consistent, but yesterday afternoon just took the cake. We walked in and were seated by a seemingly pleasant waitress. We were immediately asked to place our orders with only seconds to review the menu. My friend and I like variety and are grazers so we started with 3 appetizers. One of the appetizers were the Angel Wings. The wings came out terribly overcooked with big gashes in the side of them as if the cook stabbed them while frying to make sure they were well cooked. Well they were more than well-cooked....they tasted freezer burned, dry, and barely edible. While waiting for our apps, the waitress took our dinner orders. My friends asked for a minor alteration to the fried rice that was coming as a part of his entree and the waitress abruptly said, \"No! You can't do that. We dont make changes like that.\" We immediately were taken aback by her aggressive tone, and he decided to just order the entree as it was listed on the menu. After we cleared the table of our inedible angel wings and other plates, we were sitting waiting for our dinner, and all of a sudden another waitress brought our check as if we were done! At no time did anyone ask any question about how our experience was going. She just flung the check carrier down on the table and nonchalantly walked away. Just about that time, our dinner showed up. The rice dish that my friend order was not right. He asked me to taste it, and it was horrible. It was suppose to be thai fried rice, but looked and tasted like old overcooked plain rice with no taste. He hesistated to send it back since we had already had run in with our waitress, and when she finally approached the table, she asked in a rather condescending tone, \"whats the matter?\" He explained that the rice was bad, and she wasnt even paying attention. She just asked, \" What do you want now?\" He ordered another dish, and her response was that the dish was 4 dollars more than the previous. The reordered dish came out quickly, and it seemed that we were being rushed with various wait staff now hovering around. Just horrible.  As many times as we've been to this restaurant we'd never expereince this type of  attitude and lack of customer service or lack of attention to detail. Unfortunately this was our LAST time going to Osha, and we will resume going to other Thai restaurants in the area. I hope the staff and management at Osha see these reviews about their declining food quality and service and decide to do something about it before they lose more customers.", "author": "Bryan H."}

Very few Thai restaurants can make me forego my usual hot and sour coconut milk seafood soup with a side of rice but OSHA did it!  My partner in crime, Nez, and I started off with the fried wontons which were excellent and a real bargain at 12 for $5.50.  She had the beef with pepper and garlic over rice and I had the OSHA Sea curry over rice.  (A few moments of silence for Jill and Nez as they stuff their faces) SOOOOOO goood!  I took home half of my meal because it was so filling and let me tell ya' it was STILL excellent this morning when I finally made it home.  After a quick conference we decided that we had sufficient room in our \"dessert compartments\" to go for the fried banana with coconut ice cream.  A wise choice.  Washed everything down with the ubiqitous Thai iced teas and we were done and out of there minus $40 and less than 45 minutes.  Plenty of time to run out the door and conveniently catch the 38 Geary.  \nMost importantly OSHA leaves you with a solid drinking base for the rest of the night's requisite debauchery!", "author": "Jill D."}

Pad thai was alright - nothing special.  Chicken friend rice was also okay.  I had more success at the Osha thai on 2nd St, but that could've just been my ordering wrong dishes.

If you're in no hurry and don't care about service I doubt you'll find any issue with this restaurant. We were seated right away....and then we waited. After waiting for about 15 minutes server #1 brought us glasses of water. He did this without introducing himself or otherwise making us feel welcome. \n\nAnother 15 minutes of waiting and server #2 finally came around to take our orders. She seemed angry, but we didn't mind because we were relieved to finally be ordering after so long.\n\nSome time after this we started to receive our plates. The food was excellent. They mixed up who wanted HOT and who wanted MILD. By this time we have dealt with three or four different servers. In fact I'm still not sure who our real server was.\n\nAfter this, things only got worse. So bad, in fact, that it was almost like a nightmare. At one point, one of the waiters needed some place to put her tray, and she saw an empty spot on our table, so she just put it there, and left, without saying anything to us as if the table was completely empty. \n\nThese are just a few examples of the horrible service at Osha, and I wouldn't recommend the place to anyone. But perhaps things would have been better if we went at a less busy time.", "author": "oskar v."}

She forgot to put in the order. and blamed that she was a hostess so she forgot to put it in. NO APOLOGY at all. HORRIBLE. then when we got out good, the fresh spring rolls were horrible. The wrap was too thick and soggy and I could make better rolls. the Chicken fried rice was too salty for me and the beef pho noodle didn't have enough flavor. I wish we went somewhere else.

It gives a false sense of being cultured to those who frequent  SUSHI GROOVE or PF CHANGs (do you guys not notice the walnut prawn sauce at PF and the sweet salmon roll sauce at SG are the same??..so funny) to think they're really going \"ethnic\" w/their food tastes.    Yea right.  It's like getting taco bell and thinking you're getting mexican food. \n\nAnyhow..if you steer past the sweet/sourey stuff....there's some really good dishes at Osha.\n\nThey have a seafood dish called \"Osha sea\".  It's packed full of really good fish, shrimp etc.  It tastes very full flavored w/spices and not so sweet/sourey.  It's pretty authentic.\n\nNext and OUR MOST FAVORITE dish on the menu at Osha is a noodle dish called \"PHAT SEE YOU\"  (pronounced Fat see you!)\nIt's flat noodles w/egg/chinese broccoli and chicken or shrimp.  \nThat's the DISH to go for at Osha.  Add a hint of hot sauce, and you have sweet/salty/spicey and hearty meat..in one dish.  You GOTTA try it.  THIS DISH ALONE gives the place 5 stars.\n\nAMBIENCE/CULTURE/PATRONS\nIt seems to be the hangout spot for all the NIck and Adams who are looking to oogle at exotic thai waitresses and get their drunk fetish on(see posts below..and I've seen firsthand).\n\nSound like a funny observation?  Sometimes it can be to the extreme.\nYou know the story that guys/girls can't always just be platonic friends?  Well here is the REAL LIFE cautionary tale of WHAT CAN HAPPEN..and at OSHA!\n\nAfter catching a cab after our stint at Mr. Smiths...my crew went in to get our 1a.m.  Osha fix.\n\nAcross from us was a table of 3 guys (who looked like they were in the band fatboy slim, or a bad gap commercial.) and one asian girl w/her head buried in her arms on the table.  \n\nOne of the guys APPROACHES us..and comes over and says \"Hey..Bro..we got this chick...she's all wasted Bro...we're going to take her back to my place man......You guys want in?\"\n\nTHIS REALLY HAPPENED...\n\nI politely declined...and my entire group looked over at that table in horror.    The scarey part is..one guy from my crew..actually went up and to that table!   I went over and got him and dragged him away from there.  Crazy, boy...\n\nSorry for the novel..I'll sum it up.\n\nGood Food..Try the dishes above..prices are cheap(table for 5 w/food to spare came out to 45 bucks..unreal)\n\nCrowd tries to act azn cultured and can be overly fetished out..so be prepared.\n\nThe fetish crowd tends to run off after 1:30am.

They pretty much led the revolution of the 'modern' Thai restaurants in the city. My husband and I have been going there for many years (from my memory for 13 years) when we were still dating (and we've been married for 9 years now). Osha wasn't named Osha yet and we used to refer to it as Thai Noodle. We still do if we refer to the Geary location. This place was the original location of the Osha franchise. And we loved this place because it had a hole in the wall feel to it (meaning it wasn't pretentious), packed with a good young crowd, cheap and delicious food with good portions, and fast service. We used to joke that they were a fast food Thai place (compared to other Thai restaurants at the time that had a traditional upscale ambiance). We still love their food until now, although we don't go there as often as we used to since we moved further south.\n\nFunny how they changed. They renovated this place to have a cleaner, bistro-like ambiance (yes, it is more pretentious, such is the case in Embarcadero and 2nd St) and they expanded the Geary location (which was good since it was always packed. They added more dishes (I appreciated the addition of the fried ice cream which I could only find at a Thai restaurant on Noriega before) and they also jacked up the prices (boo).

Of course, we arrived and I was surprised to find myself at another Osha restaurant. We ordered the green curry, the yellow sea curry, and the crab fried rice. I loved the spice of the green curry and the flavor of the seafood yellow sea. The fried rice was a hit and basically we walked out feeling like we're headed for a food coma, but now have the calories to burn on a long bike ride. I definitely like the food more at this location than the one Downtown.", "author": "Faye P."}

Here's how to get your Thai fix: start off with something creamy, move onto spicy and finish it off with something sweet and sticky.   Mmmmm.... For appetizers go with  shrimpt toasts and tom ka gai (enough cholesterol from the coconut milk to clog your arteries for years), crab fried rice (not spicy, buttery rich), pad see ew (mild), any curry (get it thai spicy if you dare), and of course the Dessert Diva can leave a meal without coconut icecream on sticky rice (special order not on the menu).  Avoid anything that you can find on a typical chinese menu, that's not Thai food and it's not what they do best.  Thai resturants put that stuff on the menu to please the timid.

EXCELLENT!\nwell i ordered the papaya salad with the salty crab.  NO.  dont get that ever.  at least dont get the one with the salty crab..more like old and moldy crab.  it was nasty.  big no no.  the boytoy ordered his usual..shrimp fried rice.  always delicious.  ask them to level-up the spiciness...they'll look at you and smirk.  they know you wont be able to handle it.  and you probably wont..\n\nlet me break it down for you:\nLEVELS of SPICINESS (USA VERSION)==\nmild\nmedium\nspicy\nnow, since we're in california, we think different.  we're not used to those tiny chili peppers they use, so you'd think that mild would be no spice, medium would be tolerable, and spicy would just be spicy..but noooo.\n\nLEVELS OF SPICE (THAI VERSION):\nmild=spicy\nmedium=give me 2 glasses of ice water\nspicy=call 911, my head just exploded.\n\nme?  im still a novice.  i go for medium.\nso now you know, and knowing if half the battle... \npeace.", "author": "Summer R."}

Osha was recommended by a colleague.  I arrived an hour early and sat in the lounge and ordered a Bangkok by Night drink - rum and strawberry liquer - wonderful!  The lounge was comfortable enough for me to read while I enjoyed my drink.  The best news was I got to enjoy during happy hour - the happy hour is from 3:00 p.m. until 8:00 p.m.  Monday through Friday.\nWhen my daughter and her friend arrived they ordered the Lychee martini - omg!  I am getting that next time.  We then went to the restaurant - a little strange because you exit the bar area and enter another door for the restaurant.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere - as does the lounge.  We ordered appetizers -Thai somosas and the hit was the crab with cilantro deep fried (anything fried is good!).   We ordered the country chicken, Osha spicy pan fried noodles and prawns pineapple.  The place was very busy and I felt slightly rushed by the servers but  I would return.  The restaurant is a little pricey but the atmosphere is nice and the food overall is very good.

I didn't find the plastic bubble seats too appealing. When I started looking at what people inside had on their table, I began to look forward to my meal. Upon reading the menu, I found the prices to be a tad on the high side for Thai food consisting of a few veggies and one meat. $9 for an appetizer with 6 skinny prawns. The prawns were delicious though. We decided on the Pad Kee Mao?, Spicy Green Beans and the Pinapple Fried Rice as our main course. The food arrived quickly and was very good. The green beans were not what we expected due to them being short cut beans with a bit of sauce and not much spice. We are used to whole green beans with some flavor and heat being served when they are referred to as \"SPICY\" The rest of the food was delicious. Some of the best Thai noodles I have tried yet. Pinapple fried rice was really full of big chunks of pineapple, which I appreciate, due to other places serving Pina Rice with paltry Pina and mucho rice. It would have been at least a four star if prices were a tad more reasonable for portions of food served. Then again, it is the city and almost everything is priced high out here. For the money they are making per table on simple ingredient foods, maybe they should invest some of it back into better seating.

This polished pebble amongst sand dirtied by pollution is OSHA Thai. The dark wood booths sacrifice total comfort for aesthetic which is often the case in the battle for visual appeal. Any sense of displeasure is eradicated as promptly as the service, both in waiter presence and food preparation. Through semi-broken English, an indication of significant authenticity, the waiter took our order and, like a successfully dieted Thai Santa Clause, double checked it. The food was delivered, minutely staggered, on white plates with artistic intent: a surprisingly pleasant presentation. The taste and quality of my Volcano Beef and her Spicy String Beans with Chicken matched the intriguing appearance. The meats were prepared with skill and were tender and tasty. Added to these were Aztec temples of rice that were sadly moldered over the course of the meal. A fair price of around $35 for two entrees, tea, a deceptively classy looking Sapporo, and leftovers.

(but darn I had to put atleast one for the review to post--someone needs to change that!!) This USED to be my all time Favorite Thai place (great food, great prices all around good and FAST service but...)...until the last time I set foot in there. I'd been coming in for about 7- 8 years and the last time I was in there I was treated like a criminal!!! It was the strangest thing to have my waiter lurk around while I ate...literally stand around and watch me!! Like I was going to do a \"dine & dash\" or something. It was the most unpleasant feeling ever. Also it was cold that afternoon and in the second section (they expanded a few years ago) there is an exit that always stays locked but it has a small window above the door (i forget the name for them) and I had asked that it be shut because there was a terrible draft coming in right to where I was sitting. They begrudeonly shut it, but half way through my spicy string beans and chicken dish they opened it up again. How rude!! it wasn't even hot and it wasn't busy either (sometimes the place is packed) and I can appreciate it--if it's stuffy or hot but it was neither. I ordered dessert, the Mango with sticky rice and I never tasted anything so gross! They apparently used the same knife for onions as they did for the mango and it tasted as so--YUCK!!! I left it uneatten. I think the waiter caught on to my dissatisfaction and offered a lame comment like \"sorry we are changing shifts\" or something to that effect...I guess his whole reason for lurking was to get me to move along...it worked... I moved along alright, right out the door never to return again. Don't say I didn't warn you!!", "author": "Mira L."}

I always brought my parents there when they came to visit us from out of town.  My Dad loved it!  Now I live in Seattle and I arranged to come to San Francisco again with my parents for leisure and we all looked forward to going back to Osha today for lunch.  I went around the block many times and had a hard time looking for a parking.  Finally, I found a spot and went inside Osha and asked the staff to give me some change for the parking meter.  They exchanged 4 quarters but it was only good for 40 mins.  We waited a looooooooong time for them to take our order.  They were not busy but the staff were cleaning tables instead of taking our order.  Since our parking meter was running our of time and we haven't order yet, I asked the staff if they could exchange me more quarters since we don't want to rush our lunch.  The staff said that they have no more quarters and told me to go across the street to the cigarette place to get change.  I believed the guy but it was impossible and not safe for me to go to the cigarette place with my 6yr old and my 1 yr old daughters, so we decided that we have to eat our lunch very fast.  We were looking forward for dessert but didn't have time.  They NEVER served us water and never came to asked if we need anything.  When I went to pay the bill, I noticed that their cash register was FULL of quarters and the bottom of their fish bowl dish where they put their tips also had a lot of quarters.  If they don't provide parking to their customers, they should at least help that their customers park their cars safe.  They had no consideration and they were basically LYING because they didn't want to exchange me some quarters.  I was patronizing their restaurant and they should at least ensure that we have time to enjoy our meal.  That should also be part of the service.  The food was not better than other places I tried since I left The Bay Area and the washroom was disgusting!

But I guess that doesn't really matter cuz the food is worth it. The interior is indicative of a TL restaurant as well- no frills or atmosphere to speak of- hard, wooden booth or flimsy plastic chair- your choice. But again, the food is good, so who really cares. We saw this fat lady eat it on her way into the bathroom. There was gnar-gnar water all over the floor (from the previous flusher, i'm guessing). Gross. But so what, the food is good. At the table next to us, this girl had passed out mid-meal and had her head in her BFs lap while he ate and conversed loudly with his annoying friends as if nothing was out of the ordinary.

We got seated & started looking at the menu . From a previous review I read here, there's gratuity charge for 6 people or more . ( We had 5 ) We waited for SO LONG for the damn waiter to come & take our order . Holy crap, that was the longest 20 minutes of my life . After we ordered, my food came first . I ordered the Green Curry with Chicken over Rice . First thought that came to my mind was, \"Wow, pretty f*cking small . Cheap asses !\" The taste was aright . It wasn't the best curry I've had in my life . Their Osha Spaghetti, however, was pretty good . My boyfriend had the Pad Thai & the noodles weren't really done yet . Anyway, then the bill came & there was a gratuity charge . In no way did they deserve 18% tips . -___-\" Also, their bathroom is horrible . YUCK !

The restaurant started pushing drinks and appetizers before we got our jackets off and continued throughout our meal.  I ordered a dish with spaghetti and duck, which would have been OK except for one thing - the duck.  The very small amount of meat was freezer-burned.  There was lots of tough, soggy skin and fat - one piece as big as a cell phone.  They started clearing dishes before we'd finished eating.

The Geary location seems to be the only one that matters in my life.  It's the one I frequently visit to dine in or just get take out when I'm headed cross town.  I have spent many an evening enjoying the atmosphere and taste of Osha with some of my theater friends while studying  and living in the area.  My favs are the Pineapple Fried Rice and Pad Thai see eew ( I know I spelled it wrong).   I've sampled many other dishes as well and I have to say that I have never tasted anything that did not have a knock out flavor to it.  The vibe in this place is also important to the dining experience.  It seems to always be teaming the young artful energy of the Tenderloin and Theater District.  House Music or Electronica playing just loud enough and CNN on mute on the big screen behind the register.

This time we check out Osha on 2nd.  It's contempoary, it's dark, it has young crowd.  It certainly gave me the \"in the city\" feel.  The food is Thai fusion.  Our goal is to make sure we didn't order anything that taste aweful, we are not looking for traditional or authentic Thai taste.   And we weren't disappointed and let's just leave it at that.  Papaya salad (Som Dum) were not really taste like the real som dum, nevertheless it remain quite refreshing.  Tung Yum Gon was far from spicy or has enough kick to it but it was still a decent spicy sour soup.  The fish cake probably taste closest to the fish cake you do get in Bangkok.   Then there are lamb and sea bass while taste good but nothing Thai about it.   Their late hours on the weekend I am sure gets interesting after 11pm but I would never know.

All three folks in my party had heard good things about this place, so I was excited as we made our way there after a show. Not too often you hear of a thai place being open until three o'clock in the morning, but this place was pretty hopping. First impressions were that the staff seemed cranky at best, the benches were terribly uncomfortable and that they we'd be subjected to some horrible run of the mill dance-y pop music for our meal. The menu was varied and of a good size, but there was little decision as I ordered my standard tom ka gai and panang curry with thai iced tea. The tom ka gai was well put together, nice mushrooms and the chicken was still tender. A little annoying here that I had to order a nine dollar pot for the table and couldn't get an individual appetizer-style order, but I rolled with it. My table-mates felt the soup was too spicy, but I thought it wasn't overpowering. I like spicy food, and so when they'd inquired as to the appropriate heat for my curry dish I went with \"hot\" as my reply. I regret that now, because the chile flavor was so overpowering that the dish was essentially ruined- and the same fate befell my friend's green curried rice plate. As someone who cooks for other people on the regular I feel like that's a pretty big boo boo. We packed them to go after accepting that they were simply too hot, hopeful that once refrigerated we'd be able to handle them better. I just polished my leftovers and found it still wasn't entirely enjoyable because the heat overwhelmed the other flavors I'm looking for in a curry. So ten dollars for a dish that could essentially be replicated by dumping too much hot sauce on white rice. In spite of this and the uncomfortable seating I'd still put this place on some sort of list for latenight post-concert eating- beats jack in the box. I'd have to go back and have another quasi-crappy experience to fully rule this place out, at least. But the quest for a fantastic thai meal continues....", "author": "Greycella L."}
