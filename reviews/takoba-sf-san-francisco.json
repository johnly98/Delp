My friend told me about this place a loooooooong time ago but I never really had a chance to be in the area during dinner time to try this spot out.\n\nNew fave spot for rolls in the city. The quality is there, the flavors, the price, you can pretty much say that this place is the trifecta for sushi. I'm surprising myself because I used to think that Elephant Sushi was my fave sushi joint, but Takoba has me saying, \"Elephant who?!\" \n\nMy bf thoroughly enjoyed this place as well which definitely is a plus. I think our favorite roll is the John Collins roll, which comes in 6 pieces compared to the other rolls (8 pieces). I think I can probably eat 2.5 orders by myself. Gotta carb-load before getting ratchet downstairs, right?! \n\nBtw--also newly discovered from a friend whose man had connects with peeps downstairs at the bar. There's a spicy margarita (I think it's infused w/ habenero peppers--super delicious, if you're into spicy things like me. The spicy marg literally burns your throat. I think you can order that during your dinner (once the upstairs got too packed, patrons were able to sit at the bar downstairs to drink and grub), if not, it's worth the trek to order from the bartenders downstairs!", "author": "Denise L."}

Originally we could not find the restaurant because it wasn't very obvious. When you walk in, there is a coffee shop in front and a bar in the back. After looking confused for a bit, I was instructed that the restaurant was actually upstairs. \n\nThe restaurant is actually pretty small; it could maybe seat 15-18 people. However, we were still seated fairly quickly. The servers were overall attentive. Both my coworker and I ordered the Chef's Choice Chirashi bowl (for $22 each). The fish was fresh and in decent size.\n\nOverall, I would recommend as the food and service was pretty good, but would not recommend during the lunch rush due to the size of the location and can be relatively hot due to being on the second floor.", "author": "Wilbur C."}

Was a little hard to find since I had no idea it's tucked away inside of a bar that's downstairs (which adds to its charm) but once we found it, we felt extra accomplished.\n\nTakoba is a little sushi spot that kinda feels like a speakeasy. It's a loft-type setup so the sushi bar overlooks John Colins? below-- super cool. It's small and cozy with only a few tables and very limited seating, so we were surprised that a table was clearing just as we walked upstairs. \n\nWe ordered a bottle of sake and let the waitress suggest a few rolls. Each one was DELICIOUS! I'm usually pretty picky with sushi and it was strange to blindly trust someone but I'm glad I did. The sashimi was good, but this will have to be my go-to spot for specialty rolls. They aren't cheap ($15 per) but they are so satisfying. \n\nExpensive dinner but worth it.  It was a Friday night so the music downstairs was very much clubby and the bathrooms are shared with the bar so they are pretty gross, hence the docked star.

It's on a side street so it's kind-of hard to find to start with, but then it's also on the second floor of a bar which is the start of a few problems with Takoba. \n\nAnother concern was that Asian people don't work at Takoba! That should've been a red flag. \n\nThe bar is loud, impersonal, and overwhelming. You have to show ID to get in the door even if all you want is Takoba. It's confusing because Takoba will tell you you can wait in the tiny area upstairs, outside, or at the bar. So even though we put ourselves on the waitlist via Yelp app and they gave us a time to be there by, we still had to wait. So what did we do? We waited at the bar, as they suggested. \n\nOne confusing aspect is that you can order sushi at the bar. So after a bad tech meetup where this recent dropout pitched me his crypto startup idea (and debated the ethics of ethereum and blockchain) we did what any hungry person would do: we ordered sushi at the bar to speed things up. Then we got a text message saying our table was ready. Score! The barman said we could go up, so we went up. \n\nTakoba wait staff seated us at our table (which was a communal table, fine, it's as intimate as the bar but quieter! Still a step up from where we were, literally and figuratively!)\n\nTakoba staff gave us menus, and gave us waters. I was quenched! The bar didn't have water. I gulped it down. We told them to take our menus, we'd already ordered. Aaaand then they told us to leave and go back to the bar because they couldn't give us our food that we'd ordered FROM THEM down there even though we were told we could order down there and then told by someone else at the bar that we could eat it at our table UPSTAIRS where it was crowded but not noisy. Hey, we wanted to chat like friends.\n\nAlas, Takoba waitresses and servers rudely and loudly made us leave (I was so embarrassed) and we went back to the bar where we ate our Takoba, Midori, and Minna rolls in silence because we didn't feel like yelling to be heard. \n\nThey were good rolls but not worth the price and definitely not worth the service. Until Takoba learns how to treat customers (hey, the customer is always right, ESPECIALLY when multiple people say the same thing and we--the customers--do it.) \n\nSave your money (those were pricey rolls, even for SF), save your breath, and save the stress and embarrassment (also secondhand embarrassment, because other customers asked why we couldn't stay at our table either) and go to Pabu or Akiko's (both also in FiDi) or venture to Ebisu in Inner Sunset.", "author": "Lizzie S."}

You have to walk into John Colins then go to your left to head up the stairs. The place is very very small. It's also a little stuffy up there even with the windows open. Nonetheless, the food was great!\n\nOrdered 3 rolls to share among 2 people and it was the perfect amount. I like salmon so of course all the rolls we ordered had salmon in it! Salmon avocado was a good decent roll. My favorite would have to be the Midori! Salmon on top with some avocado and cucumbers inside. A very basic roll but it tasted so good! The Takoba was a nice little kick of spicy tuna on the inside. The wasabi aioli on top wasn't too noticeable but the spicy tuna was definitely noticeable. \n\nAll in all, I will be back to try more rolls or just order the same ones!!

After 25 minutes waiting for one item (remember there are only 20 seats) and at least two guys behind the counter at all times, it got a bit frustrating.\n\nPrices for the size of the roll are definitely on the steep side.\n\nThe not so highlight is sitting and looking at the homeless guy with his toes hanging out his shoe across the street which is typical for many an alley location in SF and this was no different.\n\nThe fish was fresh but the amount of fish on a roll is 50% less than elsewhere for hefty $15.00 tag.

Even though it was a tempura roll, that didn't mean that this whole roll was overly fried. The fried shrimp was just a part of this roll. And the California roll was perhaps the best C roll that I've ever had. \n\nBonus: You can get on the waitlist via the Yelp app, so even though this restaurant is teeny, you can get a table when you need it.

There is no storefront that you can see from the street. Walk into John Collins (the bar) and go up the stairway on the left. There should be a banner directing you to the stairway. Takoba SF is a small balcony area above the bar. You can imagine then that seating is tight. There aren't too many seats, and there isn't much space for you to wait either. It might be a cute place to bring a date, but pick somewhere else if you're planning on celebrating with a large group of friends. \n\nThis place gets 5 stars because it has good food and is generally a good value for San Francisco. The price to quality ratio hit the spot for me. Of the three things we ordered. my favorite was the Minna Roll. The Minna Roll had a lot going on in terms in flavors and textures that kept it interesting. It had spicy crab and cucumber topped with hamachi, unagi, and tobiko. We also got the Midori roll because I love salmon. The Midori was good, but paled in comparison to the Minna for me. The chirashi bowl was beautiful. The fish was of good quality, but a bit pricey.

The people who own and work at this restaurant have no concept of how to do so. \nBrief Recap:  I go in and people stare at me blankly as if they are confused as to why I'm there. I have to ask to confirm if I'm in the right place. I'm told to sit anywhere and a waitress will come by. 15 minutes later, I go ask if there actually is a waitress. I am reassured that one will appear soon. She finally does and I order everything at once. Instead of going to place my order, she goes to another table and takes an order for a table of six. Surely, she will enter my two little sushi rolls first right? Nope! \n\nI watch as the party is served an abundance of food and I am just sitting there patiently. Apparently, they had poor service as well because they had to repeatedly request plates, soy sauce, etc to eat the food they were served.  Finally, I ask them to check on my food and box it to go. Then she realizes she gave it away to someone else... After another 15 minutes, I finally get food, wait ten minutes to pay and thankfully escape.  They gave me $5 off for being patient enough to stay. I tipped 10% for the first time in my life and went back to eat at the hotel.  Finally for the food- it was really freaking good!

I was in SF for another work trip and wanted to some tasty sushi grub near my office in Soma. My coworkers recommended trying out Takoba and luckily I did, because Takoba did not disappoint! I'm not much of a sushi snob, but haven't had much luck finding stellar sushi while in SF.\n\nFor starters, it's a small restaurant located in the loft of a bar called John Collins. Because I was riding solo, I was seated immediately at the bar around 5:30pm. I started off with a Moscow mule, which was served in a glass mug but still delicious. I then ordered the California roll, the Spicy Tuna roll, and the Oban roll. Would recommend all 3, though the Oban was a specialty roll. Basic rolls were $8/$9, while the Oban was $15.\n\nService was prompt and friendly, though there was a healthy amount of people coming and going, likely for their happy hour from 5-7pm. If you're done with your meal and want to stick around, you're conveniently located in a bar so it's kind of convenient. \n\nOne of the better sushi spots I've been to in the city, would highly recommend trying out Takoba, though beware of the steeper prices.

Depending on the day this place can be completely packed or semi empty. You can also order sushi downstairs in the bar area and get it brought down or you can try your luck at sneaking a seat upstairs. On a Thursday night the bar was packed and the upstairs wait was over an hour. Ended up coming on a Saturday around 5:15pm and the place was empty though people slowly tricked in over the next half hour. You can also add your name on a virtual waitlist through Yelp though the list doesn't open right at 5pm.\n\nFood for the most part was alright. A lot of the rolls sounded amazing but flavorwise were just average. My friend and I split 2 rolls (John Colin's and Oban) and I got a Minna Roll on the side.\n\nNone of the rolls were all that distinguishable. Not saying they didn't taste different versus all the flavors were fairly muddled and nothing really stood out about any of the rolls. Rice had ok texture but lacked flavor.\n\nOban: I adore walu and that was the main thing this roll had going for it. Otherwise it tasted fairly generic. Basically a shrimp tempura roll with various fish on top. I enjoyed it but it wasn't all that different from a more typical sushi joint (3.5/5)\n\nJohn Colin's: I did enjoy the tequila cured salmon on the John Colin's but it's a subtle taste that completely gets washed out by everything else. I only tasted it when I ate the salmon separately. I think I would have preferred this without the teriyaki which overpowered some of the other flavors (3.5/5)\n\nMinna Roll: Probably my least favorite of the rolls because the sauce they used on the eel was overpoweringly sweet. Eel was also a bit dry. Close to a good roll if the eel was less sweet (3/5)\n\nOverall Takoba was a bit disappointing considering all the reviews.

When I saw Takoba, I was so pleasantly surprised - 4.5 stars and it's literally 900 feet away from the Yelp's front door? Amazing! I didn't even need to continue my search because I'd found *the one.*\n\nAnd fortunately, those reviews did not let me down. I enjoyed both the Special Xtra and the Tuna Poke very much. It had been a while since I'd last had sushi and Takoba was a great way to re-acclimate myself to the raw fish world. As soon as each bite hit my lips, I was overwhelmed with freshness and an abundance of flavor. I'm just going to go ahead and assume that all of their rolls are great because it was pain-staking to choose which ones to go with, and now they've officially won me over for life after experiencing those two delights. My dining mate ordered one of the bowls, and while I enjoyed it, the sushi rolls are what really left an impression.\n\nTakoba is absolutely tiny. It's actually inside of another business - walk inside John Collins, head to the left, up the staircase, and you'll find yourself inside of a sushi restaurant with about 20 community-style seats.

Food is on the pricier side (maybe I'm a cheapo but wow $8 for a hand roll) so I'd save this place for a business lunch or a more special occasion.  \n\nI tried the Midori, tuna poke, chef's selection sashimi, unagi hand roll, and tekka.  Absolutely all of them were delicious.  The Midori and tuna poke were probably my favorites.  Loved the texture of the fish- basically like butter melting in my mouth.  I also tried the Macau ice tea.  It was alright, but I'd definitely pass on that next time.\n\nTakoba is located inside of John Colins.  The sushi is made upstairs where there's a small seating area, but you can also sit downstairs and get the same food.

Be aware.\n+/- Oddly the roll I wasn't too fond of was the Special Xtra Roll - we got it mostly to try out the Blue Bottle Sauce which was super subtle. Not bad but probably wouldn't get it again. \n\n-A little sad that they didn't have more sashimi options (at least the night I went) like uni and the toro - seems to be dictated by the amount of customers for their seasonal sushi choices. :(", "author": "John W."}

The fish was fresh and doesn't taste terrible (not frozen or thawed for too long). The biggest angst behind the dish was the thickness of the fish and quantity of the food. Even for SF standards, I think the portions were much smaller than they really should be. There wasn't even a decent potion of of vinegared rice in the chirashi. For $20, the chirashi wasn't really worth it. I would much rather order $20 worth of nigiri had I known. The midori roll was pretty small too. My friend doesn't each much, but even she thought it was smaller than a roll should be. \n\nThe nigiri were fine. I liked the unagi nigiri, the char-grilled was done pretty well and the sauce wasn't the regular eel sauce isn't purely a sweet teriyaki sauce. The yellow tail's nigiri piece was actually thicker than the chiarashi's piece. Which I think that's unfortunate. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't necessarily come back for their chirashi. Perhaps a drink and nigiri instead. This place is definitely quality over quantity, but if I'm paying that much, I would expect the quantity to be decent as well.", "author": "Alex W."}

The John Collin roll fell apart completely as I attempted to pick it up (just to be clear, I'm 100% confident in my chopstick skills). To me rolling a roll properly is the basics of a sushi restaurant, so it was disappointing to see such amateur mistake. \n\nLastly, some tips:\n1) After you enter from the main door, you will see a hostess podium with a sign saying \"Takoba\" and an arrow pointing left and up. Follow the sign, walk up the stairs (see pictures), and you will be greeted by someone at the top of the stairs\n2) Put your name on the waitlist on Yelp before you go, and be there by the time Yelp says to grab your seats", "author": "Maggie L."}

Since they take your number, we went downstairs and ordered a few drinks at the bar while we waited and were pleasantly surprised to have our table ready 15 minutes later. \n\nMenu is limited to nigiri, sashimi, hand rolls, and special rolls. Salmon sashimi was like butter and they use less rice in their rolls, which highlights the flavor of the fish more. Our favorite rolls were The Minna Roll, which had seared hamachi and unagi on top of crab and cucumber, and the John Colins, which featured spicy tuna and tequila cured salmon. \n\nJust a heads up...it's loud in here. Really loud. The sushi space is basically a loft that overlooks the bar and you will definitely be shouting across the table to hold a conversation with your dining companions. The dining area fits about 20 people and it's all bar stool seating. There's one communal table that seats 8 people and we managed to squish 3 parties in. Ideal for parties of 2-3 people...4 is pushing it.They do not take reservations and are not good for groups.\n\nDespite the cramped space and loud atmosphere, Takoba is a great find!

Takoba is located in a loft-like space above John Colins, which is a bar. To get to Takoba, you enter John Colins and walk up a flight of stairs to your left just before you get to the bar itself. The restaurant is cozy, and probably only seats 20 people at most, so expect to wait for space come dinner (I was quoted 30-45 minutes the first time I called). It was quiet when we arrived for lunch, though this may have been due to the rain. It is worth noting that reservations are accepted for lunch. \n\nThe lady who works the front-of-house here is fantastic. She also took our orders and delivered our food, though perhaps they have more staff at night.\n\nThe food at Takoba is fusion sushi, with good quality fresh fish. The menu is short, but sufficient to fill your belly on. There is no \"omakase\" option aside from the chef's choice mixed sushi. We ordered a Minna chirashi, 2 John Colin rolls, 1 Cento Bento roll and 1 Takoba roll. The flavors were interesting for fusion sushi and I would order the rolls again (examples of flavors to expect include tequila cured salmon and a coffee sauce forming ingredients in the rolls we ordered). The Minna chirashi consisted of 3 slices of unagi, walu (escolar) and a sort of crab tartare with what tasted like fried shallots bits (very tasty). My only comment is that the shari (sushi rice) for the rolls and the chirashi was either very lightly seasoned, or was only seasoned by the gari (pickled ginger) dripping on it.

NO LONGER! \n\nI was craving sushi something bad and there's no shortage of spots to visit around the area, but Takoba stood out. It's located on the second floor of a bar called John Collins. You enter the bar (which was hoppin' during Friday happy hour) and almost immediately you'll find the staircase to sushi heaven on the left.\n\nIt's a tight spot, fitting no more than 20, so I was happy to be dining alone. I immediately grabbed a seat along the hightop bar facing the window. Drinks come from John Collins, so I decided to try the South Padre, Tito's vodka, elderflower liqueur, grapefruit, agave, lemon and ginger beer. It was tart and refreshing, with a special zing from the ginger beer. It paired quite nicely with my sushi. \n\nTo eat, I ordered a miso soup, Takoba roll and hamachi nigiri. The soup came flying out of the kitchen. It was a nice size and chockfull of mushrooms and tofu. I slurped it all down. Next was the hamachi nigiri, two generous pieces of fresh hamachi. Excellent! The Takoba roll combined so many of my favorite foods: spicy tuna and cucumber roll topped with maguro, salmon and jalape\u00f1o cilantro aioli. There was also something crunchy sprinkled on top which added an interesting texture to the otherwise soft roll. Seriously though, this was some of the best sushi I've had in awhile and didn't break the bank too much.\n\nI would say get here early or be prepared for a wait if coming after 7:00 pm. Thankfully, there's a large bar you can hang out at while you drink and if you don't mind eating down there, you can order sushi too. I loved the atmosphere of the upstairs though.

Huge plus on creativity and flavor. It is now one of my top 3 sushi restaurants in SF. :)\n\nPast Review:\nYum the food here is delicious!! Fresh fish and perfect presentation. Definitely get the sushi rolls. They were the perfect size as well.\n\nThough, I was disappointed with the service on the first floor. We had the option of seating on the first floor (another bar area) or upstairs where the actual restaurant is. They gave this option because the restaurant is tiny, but rather cozy. My friend and I were starving, so we decided to skip the 30 minute wait. Turns out the waitresses on the first floor were not the fastest workers.. took forever on our orders and forgot our water.

Ok, maybe not deceptively, but not really what I was expecting. It's basically the upstairs loft area of a bar, that's in an alley way. Not really the vibe I'm going for for a sushi bar. \n\nParking is really difficult, and once I got there, I was really confused by the bar vibe, ie really dark. Asking around, I learned Takoba is upstairs. Given the very limited seating, the wait is really long. The fiance and I had a movie to catch, so we ended up ordering take out, but even that took about 30min to make given the back order. It's an open kitchen in the 'loft' area, and it serves food to both people who are seated at the 'restaurant', and people who ordered from a limited menu at the bar downstairs.

Because I read that it was a really small place, and a line tends to form relatively quickly, I made sure we arrived right as they opened. It turned out that even though we arrived a few minutes early, there were already 6 other people in line waiting to go in.\n\nTakoba and John Colins share an entrance. In order to find Takoba, you will need to climb a narrow flight of stairs. Be warned, on a slightly warmer SF day, you will find it pretty warm in Takoba, even with the window opened. The menu is relatively small, and features mostly rolls, so that is what we ordered. \n\nWe got:\n1. Giants\n2. Midori\n3. Takoba\n4. Oban\n\nThey all tasted really good. All the different ingredients really came together well. The reason why I only rated Takoba 3 stars was because the service was very meh, and at one point, we waited 20 minutes for 1 roll. I think that is completely unacceptable given the amount of people in the restaurant. The 4 rolls also cost about $54 (give or take) and we both left wanting more food. I also didn't like how closely we sat with other people.\n\nI might come back if I'm in the area and want sushi rolls that I know will taste good for dinner, but chances are, I would travel away from FiDi to get better sushi elsewhere.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

However, I've been told this is rarely the case, as the restaurant only has about 20 seats (most of them counter-- there's only 1 main table). If you do have to wait though, it's easy to simply grab a drink from the bar below!\n\nOnce you get seated, I would recommend ordering one item at a time until you're full. Otherwise, if you order everything at once, you'll demolish it and not get to truly appreciate the fish. In terms of what to order, I would suggest whatever you like! Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong.\n\nI ordered one special roll (John Collins), unagi nigiri, and salmon sashimi. All were absolutely delicious. The fish is fresh and the cuts are beautiful.

We had quite an adventure finding this place - didn't know it was on the second floor of a bar.\n\nAt 5pm (opening hours), we didn't have to wait, and we were greeted by the very friendly staff and escorted to our seats. We decided to split a few rolls between us.\n\nThe Minna roll (unagi and hamachi) was by far my favorite - the unagi is cooked to perfection and combines very well with the fresh hamachi and savory crab salad in the middle.\n\nThe John Collins roll is also superb. The fresh salmon on the outside meshed really well the spicy kick from the tuna and the aioli sauce.\n\nWe had the Special Xtra roll which was very unique -- never had blue bottle sauce on a california roll, and topped with seared tuna! \n\nTry to go during non-peak hours, as there is very limited seating (about 20 seats?)\n\nOverall, a phenomenal experience.

They have a classic dollar-off happy hour selection. Since Takoba doesn't seat you until your entire party arrives nor do they take reservations, you can have yourself a discounted (well, discounted for SF) Moscow Mule in an adorable Mason jar from their friendly (and efficient!) cocktail bartenders and sit on the corner of a hip wooden bench as a perky cloud of SF millennials form around you.\n\nI had their John Collins, Spicy Hamachi, and Midori rolls. The rolls were delicious. The fish was fresh, like they were literally just caught in the ocean moments ago, and the sauces on the rolls were fantastic. Really great flavors, combined with the fish just melting into your mouth, makes a great dinner.\n\nAnd, the best part is, the rolls are well-priced for what you get. A sushi dinner usually comes out to be around $50-60, but I was surprised to see my check clocking in under $45, which is a DEAL in SF.\n\nThe one downside is that there is really limited seating. I feel like smaller parties of 2-3 probably have better luck getting seating in here. However, this downside equates excellent service--our food came out quickly and our water glasses got a lot of attention. \n\nTakoba is fantastic.

There isn't a whole lot of space so definitely not great for large parties. I ordered the 8 piece Sashimi, John Colins, the Minna and Midori roll and a bottle of sake.They were all super fresh and the fish really does melt in your mouth. My only gripe is between two grown adults, this is barely enough food. If I spent over a hundred dollars between two people I would expect my hunger to be satisfied afterwards. My friend and I had to go to the chipotle around the corner afterwards. Overall this is a great place, but don't come here super hungry, you probably won't leave full.", "author": "Davy L."}

It is located on the SECOND FLOOR of John Collins (a bar). There is a small staircase leading to the restaurant on the left when you walk inside John Collins.\n\nWe came here at around 8:30pm on a Friday and there was about a 30-45 minute wait. They gave us an option to sit downstairs at John Collins if we didn't want to wait. Since the wait was a bit too long for us, we decided to sit downstairs at John Collins to eat. Thus, I cannot write on the experience of dining at Takoba so I will strictly be reviewing the food only. Also, I personally do not recommend sitting at the bar unless you are really in a rush and/or are looking to eat fast.\n\nWe got a spicy tuna roll ($10), a salmon avocado roll ($10), and a spicy tuna hand roll ($8). All 3 rolls were fresh and tasted great. However, for some reason, the rolls didn't fill me up at all. It felt as if I ate air. I have a very small stomach so eating something small fills me up fast, but these rolls didn't fill me up even the slightest bit.\n\nTaking a star off for spending $10 on a roll and not getting full.

It was quite loud because of the bar, but we sat closely around the edge of the middle table and enjoyed each others company.The waitress was very attentive and asked us numerous times if we were ready to order or if we needed anything else from the sushi bar. \n\nWe ordered three rolls and sashimi: John Colin's, Minna, Midori and tuna sashimi all which I felt were unique in their own way. The Minna was my favorite for the flavored unagi on top. We also ordered (2) Kirins each that was delivered to us from the bar.

Everything looked good on the menu, but we ordered the Takoba and the John Collins rolls since those are two of the most popular rolls according to one of the waitresses.\n\nThe Takoba was nice--the spicy tuna along with the regular salmon and tuna on top with the jalapeno cilantro aioli made for a nice cohesive bite.\n\nI didn't get to try the John Collins despite our initial plans to share, so I'm just going off of one roll here.

I felt nauseous and clammy shortly after eating 3 rolls (Minna, Oban, Spicy Hamachi).  This time, we sat downstairs in the dark room with the large TV screen and weren't able to see what we were eating.  I guess it was never a good idea to eat sushi in the dark-- maybe we could've seen the sushi not looking so fresh and sent them back.  Anyway, I hope this won't evolve into full blown food poisoning or parasitic infection-- basically my worst fear after eating sushi!", "author": "Apple M."}

Decided to finally give it a visit after a happy hour in downtown SF. Firstly, yeah I admit, it's cool that this sushi bar is on top of a bar. Like sure, they have that going for them... But overall, I didn't like it and I won't be coming back.\n\nFood:\nThey don't have cooked sushi. So if you don't like to eat raw sushi, nor like it, this is not the place for you. I repeat, they do not offer cooked sushi. I was so disappointed because that's all I eat. That's not the only reason as to why I'm giving this place 2 stars. It's also crazy expensive for the quality/amount of sushi you receive. \n\nService:\nSloooow. This place seems like it's always packed, so don't expect to get seated right away. We had to wait about half an hour, at this point we decided we'd get more drinks and my hunger had faded away.  They also didn't fill up our glasses of water, even though it was burning hot. Again, not the sushi bar's fault, but just a heads up for you people with drunken hunger. \n\nAtmosphere:\nIt's sooo hot up here. It's packed, hot, and a small enclosed space. I was literally brushing elbow to elbow with the person next to me. Not a great place to enjoy dinner if you're a claustrophobic like I am! It was also incredibly loud so you can't really hold a conversation without guessing what the person next to you just said. Sadly, I was dissapointed by Takoba.", "author": "Stefany Z."}

In fact, that part of me (let's call him Snarlin' V) made his views known when I checked in last week and saw no reviews for Takoba. He spoke to me in a harsh, actually-louder-than-normal-speech whisper, because that is how he communicates:\n\nSV: Don't you DARE write a review for this place.\n\nV: Really? I think I should. People--\n\nSV: Forget PEOPLE! There are BARELY twenty seats in this tiny-mezzanine-level sushi spot hidden above John Colins. Do you KNOW what will happen if you spill the sashimi on this place? You'll NEVER get a table again. Do I have to remind you about the ahi poke tossed in sesame oil, CRISPY shallots and furikake, and served atop four maki rolls?\n\nV: Why are you talking like this? This seems a little forced-\n\nSV: Don't do THIS Vivek.\n\nYes, there are only a handful of seats; four at the bar, a few at the window, and a table that we can dub 'communal' since it takes up most of this bunker-sized space. With the din of the bar below wafting up to the balcony -- and the dim lighting -- Takoba is a perfect date spot. It's a little spendy but not crazy. Don't bring a group -- in fact don't go at all. I want this spot all to myself.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: Make every day TAKO Tuesday.\n\nMenu Readability: Simple narrow card in web fonts. Specials are named after hyperlocal place-lies like Special Xtra and The Minna.\n\nNeed to mention: Look up! An impressive octopus mural demands your attention.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: And people say I'm selfish. Only my conscience is.", "author": "Vivek S."}

Unbelievable.  \n\nTried to go back during the duration of my trip, but twice wasn't open due to private events.  Strongly recommend to anybody who likes really good sushi.

I also like that they let you call in and put your name on the list, very uncommon for sushi bars. 3 stars because they have very little selection. When I am traveling, like I am now, I want a good sushi bar with a lot of selection, especially traditional selections, and options for me to order some custom things. This was not an option here, they did not want to hear about anything custom. They only have a half a dozen fish options on the menu. And no uni. That is the most traditional and best sushi option for any true sushi eater.", "author": "Jeff H."}

This restaurant is part of the bar John Collins which to me is quite the hidden gem.  The cocktail servers will take care of your drink orders while the sushi servers will take your food orders.  The sushi is delicious and fresh.  There is a hidden upstairs where the actual sushi bar is, but venture up because the seating area upstairs is shiek and intimate.  Try the John Collins roll the salmon is delish.  The only downside to me- which I hope is something the management will change sooner rather than later, is that the food and drinks are not linked so drinks have to be ordered at the bar or with a different server.

It's cool and interesting. The fish was of a pretty high quality and the chef we spoke to was very knowledgable and seemed passionate about her craft.\n\nOn the down side, it seems like they're still \"figuring stuff out\" as far as service goes - the seating was a little tight and the servers were nice but seemed a little green. Also, it may be the way the acoustics/walls are in there, but the party at the communal table behind us sounded REALLY obnoxiously loud.

Their sushi rolls are creative; not things you'd typically find elsewhere, and enjoyable.

If I lived here, I might eat here all the time and never tell anyone about it.\n\nService and food were excellent - we had some hamachi sashimi and about half of the maki menu, of which the Mina was the standout.  The quality of the fish was excellent, and it was never upstaged by a sauce.  I like the small menu, it seems like it represents the ethos of doing a few things well, rather than many things mediocre.  \n\nMy only criticisms are the size of the restaurant - it was a little cramped.  Not really negative, but the miso soup was exactly like every other bowl of miso soup I have ever had.  While we are on the subject, why does miso soup not taste like miso?  Not as exceptional as the rest of the meal is about as critical as I can get about it.  Go for the sushi, not for the soup.  Unless you want standard miso soup.  \n\nIn a fair world, their talent would be shared with the sushi-loving world, and they would reap the success they deserve - this is the reason for my review.

We each ordered a cocktail (moscow mule and dirty martini) and 3 rolls (2 makis, 1 Giants). The server was very quick to bring us water and take our order but after delivering the moscow mule without my martini, she was mia. 15 minutes later another girl comes over and asks if i had a martini. i told her i was still waiting. several minutes after that, the server comes back and it'll be a moment. i'm understanding still...i was in service for a decade, but this was pushing it. minutes after that, my martini shows up and she apologized saying they needed to go in teh back to get more of the gin. well, clever bartender, Venus is $9 and low and behold, so is Tanqueray. substitute! or, typically bartenders up it one especially if they make the guest wait a while. the wait for the food was a bit too much, especially considering the menu is very simply (a handle of makis, only a few nigiri selections and a few basic rolls). Seemed like fresh fish thankfully. The server shied away from us after all the wait though, which isn't always a good thing. She cleared the plate very quickly when we were done (though points for bringing me extra ginger!) and then we were awkwardly waiting for another 15 min with only a sip of a drink left for the bill.

I had to wait a few extra minutes for part of my order, which I was totally fine with since I had no place to be. But they were extra accommodating, and even provided me a few pieces of nigiri on the house. totally unexpected and unnecessary - but great service nonetheless. The food - spot on. I ordered the miso soup, the John Colin's and the Special Xtra and then the salmon nigiri. The John Colin's was spicy but AWESOME. The piece just melts in your mouth.
