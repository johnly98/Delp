I go to the better ones, where recipes have been handed down from generation to generation, & are made with a little TLC. Those are the places that I would take my friends that visit Lima with me, & that's exactly what I found today at El Porte\u00f1o!\n\nSo today I finally made the trek to give El Porte\u00f1o a world. I ordered three of my favorite chifa dishes. \n\nFirst up, Camlu Wonton... food came out in about 10 mins, nice and hot. We went in for the first bite wontons were not over saturated with sauce, and crunchy. Veggies, although in sauce, still had some crunch to them which is how I like it. The pork perfect, the chicken also just right, and the shrimp on point. 9/10 (only because I'm used to bigger slices of pork, and chicken). \nNext up Pork arroz chaufa, not greasy and full of flavor. Wasn't overwhelmed with soy sauce, but one of those times where something just happens to be exactly as it should be. 10/10. \nLast but definitely not least the Chijaukay. Just enough soy sauce, sesame oil, scallions and crunch on the chicken. Once again 10/10. \n\nWhat's left? DESERT!!\nWe said well we are 3 for 3 tonight, if they mess this up, I'm ok since the main course was damn near perfect!\n\nPicarones!! We were advised it would take a little longer, since they cook it apart from main course dishes in order to maintain that distinct flavor Picarones have. Maybe 14 mins later, which gave us some time to digest our dinner, they came out pippin hot with authentic miel. Not too thick where the center doesn't cook and is still doughy, and not too thin where they get overcooked quickly, damnit they were perfect! \n\nI am happy to say that we have found our new Peruvian spot that's worth the 45min drive. And maybe not just for Chifa, maybe for everything. Can't wait to visit again. \n\nCompliments to the chef, & Kimberly for her attention to detail when it comes to customer service. Thank you for a wonderful dinner experience. \n\nYes, parking is a pain to find, but when you do, the wait will be worth it! Can't blame the business for that. I rate the food and the service, not the color of the building across the street or the double parked car on the corner.", "author": "Jae B."}

Their food is so delicious, it is reasonably priced, and the servers are very friendly. \n\nThe appetizer we ordered were the anticuchos. They give you about 3-4 pieces of beef heart on a skewer with some deliciously crispy and soft potatoes and a sauce that has a little kick to it. It is my favorite appetizer at any Peruvian restaurant and they make it so well here. The beef heart is not too chewy or tough at all. \n\nWhenever I come here, I always order the Tallarin Saltado with beef or chicken. It's just a noodle version of Lomo Saltado and let me tell you, the sauce just makes it that much better. \n\nWe also order food to go, which is when I order the Lomo Saltado.

My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Thursday night I think and we lucky to have found parking at the next block over. And since it was after 6pm, we didn't have to feed the meter.\n\nThe inside of this place doesn't look like much, but trust me- it's good. The lady working that night was super friendly and patient with us as we took our time with the menu and even switched out our empty water jugs when it ran out. That's service. And she was the only one working that night servicing (from what I could see) so props to her for working so quick. Their menu actually has a good amount of options if you're not sure what you're craving exactly. They even have fried rice on the menu which is insane and I'll probably go for it next time I'm here just to try it out. What I did end up ordering from here was their seafood pesto pasta and holy shit, it was bomb. Their pesto sauce is definitely homemade and fresh. Like you can just taste it in each bite. What a difference from my usual pesto sauce from Costco, lol.\n\nPrices are somewhat high, but I get that it's the area you're in and I'm down to come back and splurge a little again when I can.", "author": "Venus L."}

Ultimately I had trouble decided between the arroz con mariscos (paella) and the lomo saltado.

But the real winner for me was the Causa de Pollo. Cold chicken salad inside a mashed potato \"puck.\" Ceviche pescado was perfectly spiced as well.", "author": "Stan K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-09", "description": "The only thing that comes to mind when I think of Chinese and Peruvian is how hot that combo is. And I ain't talking about the food; Hello Russell Wong and Christian Meier! Too bad, they can't make babies together. And too bad, I don't know anyone of that joint ethic makeup so I'll have to revert to talking about food. Boring I know...\n\nEl Porteno | Chifa Peruano is home to the only Chinese-Peruvian restaurant in SF (that I know of). It's basically the successors of Chifa Peruano (http://www.yelp.com/biz/chifa-peruano-san-francisco-2) with new owners and a more expensive menu. The prices aren't yipster expensive but at about 20-30% more than their old menu, it's a bit pricey for this more sketchy area of the city.\n\nOne side of the menu features your typical Americanized Chinese food while the other side features Peruvian items. Other than the ceviche, expect a carb heavy menu with lots of fried items and meat. Not a place I could eat at frequently because the food is heavy. For those who are sensitive to msg, El Porteno uses it even in their Peruvian items. Most of the sauces are premade beforehand with msg but you can ask that they chef prepare you something without it.\n\nWe started with the Causa de camarones ($8.95) which is basically a shrimp salad stacked between a mash potato mixture and topped with an aioli sauce: http://bit.ly/1m6kpim. Very creamy and delicious but I could detect some msg in the sauce as it numbed my tongue and made me thirsty. \n\nIf you like fried food, El Porteno is the place for you. The Chicharron de pollo ($7.98) is a solid choice is you like chicken karaage: http://bit.ly/1hCkV2p. It was crunchy and moist. A dab of the citrus sauce helped cut through some of the richness. I'm not sure what possessed us to order another fried dish but we did. The Jalea ($14.98) is a must order if you're a fried calamari (or fried seafood) fan: http://bit.ly/Rv98wK. The combo of the fresh seafood and light, uber crunchy (not greasy) batter made this a winner. Loved the accompanying fried corn and pickled red onions. Too bad, I was fried out from out former dish to eat more of this dish.  \n\nInitially, I wanted a stewed chicken dish for my entr\u00e9e but the chef/owner told me the sauce they use is already made using msg. I was bummed but she offered to whip up a plate of her Lomo Saltado without msg and promised it would be good. I'm not a fan of Lomo Saltado, this is usually Mr. NSS' go-to dish but the chef/owner delivered on her promise. This was by far the best Lomo Saltado ($12.95) I've tried and was even better than La Mar's, Mi Lindo Peru's, and Limon's version: http://bit.ly/1m6kUZE. The strips of beef were incredibly tender and flavorful while the fries still maintained a slight crispness to them. That rice doe, perfectly al-dente with a subtle richness from the broth (?) it was cooked in. I gave my leftovers to Mr. NSS and he made it a point to text me at work at how good it was. \n\nThey do serve pisco sour but it's premade from a bottle. Being responsible adults now, my childhood bff and I chugged chicha moradas (Peruvian purple corn drink) instead. Such a far cry from waking up and wondering how we got home. We're all grown up now!\n\nService from the chef/owner was very sweet and timely. I really appreciated that she was forthcoming about the use of msg (so many restaurants claim to not use it and I later find out the hard way that they do) and did her best to make sure our dishes were free from it. My only minor gripe is they charge $1-$1.50 for to-go boxes. What the heezy?!\n\nIf you're ever in this neck of the woods and Popeye's across the street is too hood for you, give El Porteno a shot. Not literally of course. Happy Friday!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I have been to many Peruvian restaurants in the city and by far El Porteno is my favorite place. For the past three years El Porteno has been my go to Peruvian restaurant. \n\nWhat I love: \nCausa de Pollo\nCausa de Camarones*\nCebiche Mixto*\nAnticuhos de Corazon\nTallarin Verde* \nPescado a lo Macho*\nLucuma \nAlfajores*\n\n*MUST GET/FAVORITES: \nCause de Camarones is by far one of the best causes I have ever had. I like that it has enough shrimp. They top it off with a quarter of a boil egg and huancaina sauce (amazing)! Their Cebiche Mixto is one of the cubits that its actually worth the price, since many restaurants have a small portion of it. Tallarin Verde is my boyfriends personal favorite one. Their meat size is a good size, most Peruvian restaurants tend to give you a small size, which is ridiculous considering Peruvian cuisine is known for their huge portion sizes. The tellurian verde is amazing! Its super creamy! Now, my personal favorite one, I ALWAYS HAVE TO get this dish. This dish comes with a side of white rice, tilapia fish topped with scallops, mussels, calamari, shrimp, etc and covered with their yummy orange sauce. My boyfriend decides that we should share this dish all the time, since its his favorite as well. ( and I never want to share it, I need all od ) This is by far the best Peruvian dish even though people prefer Lomo Saltado, which I still don't understand and never will. The Alfajores are also one of the best ones that I have ever had. \n\nHighly recommend everyone tries this restaurant. The food is great, great prices, and  staff is nice.", "author": "Alondra J."}

The ambiance is simple and homey, and the waiter was the cook's son, who took the time to explain each dish to our party, since we had a few people in our group who were noobs to the cuisine of Peru.\n      \nStarting with the appetizers, we ordered and shared: Ceviche de Pescado, Causa Rellena with chicken, and Chicharron de Pollo.  The seafood in the ceviche was fresh, and the dish very light and delicious.  The Causa Rellena was a great, cool appetizer -- though deceptively filling. Don't bother with the Chicharron de Pollo.  It is just fried chicken on the bone (chicken leg?). The chicken was chopped up, so you end up getting chicken bone shrapnel in your mouth -- very unappealing.\n\nFor the main courses, we ordered from the Peruvian side of the menu (will try the Peruvian Chinese next time): The Arroz Con Mariscos -- chock full of seafood -- was absolutely delicious; The Lomo Saltado with any of the proteins available (but beef and prawns are preferred). This dish is great in both quality and quantity. Now pay attention Yelpers: I know the last thing on your mind is to order the pesto pasta (Tallarin Verde) -- but DO IT!!! Yes, just do it. You'll thank me later. Get it with the grilled beef or chicken. Get it by itself. Just do it.\n\nFinally, for dessert...a little coffee, and...a little Alfajor: 2 humble cookies, dusted with powdered sugar, sandwiching the most decadent, smooth, luscious, caramel.

Every time we would go theres always a annoyed tone in the server or anyone there actually. \n\nOne day I want to say it was a Friday not sure, my family and i go to the restaurant and we noticed the gate is closed but saw customers inside still so we assumed it was due to the construction outside. We open the gate to go inside, literally seconds walking in we hear the lady yell out \"WE ARE CLOSED!! COME BACK AT 4:30 WHEN WE OPEN AGAIN\" we got there at 2, no way im going to wait that much time when the meter is running. So loud, rude and overall humiliating since everyone in the restaurant starred at my family and I. Without a word we turn around and go home. \n\nIf you're going to close the restaurant between the hours of operations wouldn't it be a good idea to have a sign of the hours when you will close and re open.

Came here for take out because of the great yelp reviews but sadly the moment I walked in the placed smelled like must. \n\nOrdered the lomo Saltado, pollo Saltado, yuca fries and some alfajores cookies. Everything was goss except for the French fries in the dish. The chicken tasted so weird and the yuca fries were hard as a rock. \n\nAs for the Alfajore cookies, they looked amazing but were a real disappointment and a waste of $5 on 2 cookies. For the same price you can get real delicious alfajores from Sabores Del Sur which is sold at  whole foods bakery and alemany farmers market.\n\nFood made my friend & I completely sick.

For those of you who like Lim\u00f3n in the mission, do yourself a favor and come here instead. It may not feel as fancy, but the food is much better. A little out of the way if you don't live in the excelsior but worth the journey! Hop on the 14 bus if you don't drive or use ride share apps. Personally I don't like to hand 5 star reviews out, but this is better than 4 stars. Couldn't do 4.5 so I had to round up.

She said that out of all the Peruvian restaurants in the city, this place is the most legit. I've tried Mi Lindo Peru, Limon, Fresca, and a Peruvian Food Truck from Off the Grid and this is by far THE BEST! Fresca at this point looks like Mcdonalds Gringo ceviche compared to El Porteno. The location is at one of the busier intersections in the city so it's kind of difficult to find parking. The space itself is dated with 70's wooden panel walls and Peruvian decor....I kind of dig it though lol. \nThe ceviche doesnt come with chips like at other places but rather white beans and pine nuts to balance out the extremity of the ceviche. It's definitely delicious and it's definitely A MUST TO ORDER.\n\nThe Lomo Saltado was perfectly marinated the the yuca fries had a nice crispy bite to them without getting too soggy from the sauce. It's a good safe dish to order, but I'm going to venture to something different when i come back!\n\nWe were the only customers inside so service was prompt.

Delicious! \n\nThe prices are good considering the quality of the dishes. In a neighborhood of Popeyes Chicken and Dominos Pizza, El Porteno is a real find.  Chef Sylvia knows what she is doing!

I thought it was gone for good, but fortunately they just remodeled and become El Porte\u00f1o, with a snazzy new menu, pisco sours, a better atmosphere... and (sigh) higher prices. Fortunately, this place knows it's still in the ass-end of the city so the prices have simply gone from \"rock bottom\" to \"reasonable.\" If you do come here, it's helpful to speak enough Spanish to be able to hold a simple conversation and order your food as some of the wait staff are monolingual, but it's not necessary; they'll just wave over someone bilingual for you if they have to. \n\nLomo saltado was amazing: flavorful with nice sauteed beef and wonderfully fluffy rice. The pisco I got was a little sweet, but since it was three or four bucks cheaper than most peruvian restaurants, I'm not going to complain too much. If you're in the area and have a hankering for something you won't get anywhere else, you should give El Porte\u00f1o a try!

She made a big deal out of us asking for ice in our water, when we were literally the only people there.\n\nWe stayed anyways and got food that was just under being \"okay.\"\nThe chicken was strange where it didn't have the texture as it should or the taste.  My girlfriend decided to not even eat any of it.  The rest was just basic.  In my Lomo Saltado, the only thing with flavor were the tomatoes.

Their food is edible if you are hungry and haven't ate for days but it is definitely not the best Peruvian food you will find at other locations within SF. I actually stumbled into this Peruvian restaurant and being Peruvian myself, I always open to tasting new Peruvian restaurants.    When filling out a review I want to equally consider the service I received here to give you a clear picture why I had to give them a low score. I walked in and they had very nice traditional Peruvian decor on the walls. Good first impression if you like a rustic feel.  I had just picked up my dad from the airport so he was pretty hungry.  He ordered seafood paella, tallarin saltado de carne, arroz chafe, and of course a Cuzquena beer.  I wasn't as hungry so I ordered 1/4 of their pollo la brasa.  I had a choice of doing the half chicken or 1/4 but again because I wasn't very hungry I figured 1/4 would do.  Being the good Peruvian daughter than I am I texted my mom asking her if she wanted me to bring her some Peruvian food to go. Coincidentally, she asked for 1/4 of pollo la brasa.  After taking my order the waitress never came back to my table so I got out of chair and walked up to the kitchen area and told the waitress I wanted to change my order and actually get half a chicken.  She proceeded to tell me she could NOT sell me the 1/2 chicken and could only do two orders of the 1/4 of chicken. I was incredibly confused. Rather than selling me half a chicken at the half chicken price, she wanted to upcharge me and get an extra few bucks off of me by charging me the premium price of 2 1/4 portions of chicken.  Sounds confusing? Sounds stupid? Well it is. It's actually very dumb and very insulting especially for a new customer. Mind you, my food hasn't even been served yet. My food hadn't even been cooked yet and she looked at me straight in the eye and attempted to swindle me right in me face.  That speaks volumes. I was very turned off by her lack of service that I would not recommend this place to any of my friends or family.", "author": "Joanna G."}
