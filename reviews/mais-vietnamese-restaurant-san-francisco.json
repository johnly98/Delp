With a solid 4 star Yelp review I was thinking this place can't be that bad. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nThere were four of us: one ordered a bowl of pho, two ordered grilled pork over vermicelli (bun cha) and another ordered grilled pork with steam rice.  Nothing super complicated, nor out of the ordinary.\n\nWe placed our order at 6:55 pm, as there was only one waitress serving several tables.  We didn't get our food until 7:20 pm...this was by far the longest time we've ever waited for Vietnamese food anywhere, but I digress.  Mind you, the table two seats away from us ordered well after us and got the food shortly after us, also pho noodle soup and grilled dish.  With all this waiting we just hoped that the food make up for it and everything would taste great.\n\nWhen the food finally did arrive and we tasted our dishes, it was just meh.  The soup of the beef pho was a bit bland. The grilled pork over vermicelli was nothing to write home about. The imperial roll tasted refried as it was bit dry and darker than normal. The grilled pork with rice was perhaps the most disappointing item since the white rice was hard and had bits of flaky rice paper...what do I mean you ask?  It is as if someone was scraping the bottom of the rice cooker to get the last bit of rice that has been sitting there for a while.  \n\nYou think I exaggerate, but it wasn't until we over heard another table try to order crab fried rice. This was about 7:15 pm, the waitress tells the customer she will have to double check but they might be out of white rice already and won't be able to make the fried rice.  We weren't really so much eavesdropping as the fact that the 80's decor and quiet atmosphere made for normal conversation audible from across the room.\n\nSure enough, the waitress comes back and they don't have white rice anymore. Not sure what else she ended up getting.\n\nTwo \"walk in\" patrons came by to order food to go around 7:20 pm, only to be told, \"Sorry, no more white rice. We close at 7:30 p.m.\"  Needless to say, both of them ended up walking out and didn't feel welcome to place an order to go.\n\nWell, if that's the case, the owners should change the sign on the window that says they close at 8:00 p.m.\n\nAtmosphere - 80's panel, a bit dated. Very quiet.\n\nService - Waitress came and took our order. Delivered the food when it was ready, and gave us the bill at the end.  Seemed like they were short staffed, and she had 4 other tables to take care of. \n\nI was keeping an eye out for the infamous 15% charge that another Yelper had mentioned, but we didn't see that on our bill.\n\nFood - uninspiring. We've definitely had better Vietnamese food before. Not sure how this place got a 4 star average rating on Yelp. You Yelpers...*tsk tsk.*\n\nMaybe we came at an off time, but given the food and service we received, we will likely not be returning.\n\nAnd of course as you walk out you see the line of folks outside Burma Superstar still jostling around the doorway.", "author": "Drea L."}

Always wanted to write a review but then I realize there's a reason why this review hasn't been done till now. The Food and customer service is very inconsistent. I guess when you think about it I was hoping this restaurant would make some changes so therefore I could give him a positive review and more than just three stars in the beginning. The last two times I've came in here speaking fluent vietnamese to them and she still got my order wrong. What's more upsetting to me than anything is the fact that she doesn't acknowledge that she got the order wrong and she doesn't even say sorry let alone telling you to just go ahead and eat it. In that aspect I understand it's first world problems is what I'm complaining up and then again it's also customer service and it's happened multiple times. And a few things that happen today that bothered me a lot was the fact that I would've multiple items and my suitcase out in a large bowl, but very very small serving. Giving a portion that I got I should have been charge for a small bowl versus large bowl. Also a customer asked if he could have a small bowl of broth and noodles on the side for his kid, her answer was simply it's still going to be $9.50 and she walked away. Just seeing that myself was very sad to me absolutely not how I would've handled it. Your mama and papa shop that just trying to survive in this ever-growing city. These customers that work around your restaurant that comes in is your key survival personally I think you could have taking care of them better.

I ordered the classic pho with beef and meat balls along with an appetizer of Imperial rolls. Both dishes were very good with the ingredients being very fresh. When judging pho, I always look at the broth in the bowl after I have eaten everything else and if there is a coating of oil, then for me that is a bad sign.

Large, caramelized, crispy cylinders of perfection, wrapped in lettuce, with a few rice noodles tucked in, dipped in the world's best nuoc cham and dabbed with a bit of hot sauce. The crab/shrimp fried rice is also delish. \n\nI also love the made-to-order vegetarian rice paper rolls, which are filled with a toothful, chewy mixture of cabbage, tofu, tree ear mushrooms and shiitakes, served with a peanut sauce.

I was kinda surprised to find the restaurant legit empty, there was only one other pair seated and eating. THAT should have been the first warning sign and I should have heeded it.\n\nService was slow and I actually felt my party was rather ignored...need I remind you there was only ONE another pair at a table? A third pair of folks who came in AFTER us got served and got their food before we even ordered...that should have been the second warning sign.\n\nThird warning sign....was that the waitress/waiter didn't seem to know what I was talking about at first when I asked for the chili paste condiment (because it packs more of a punch than plain ole Sriracha, duh), despite my naming it in multiple languages.\n\nLast warning sign... they gave me lemon wedges as part of my pho garnishes. LEMON. Now I know lemon CAN be served as garnishes for pho too but it offers a completely diff profile from lime, which I'm more familiar with. I asked if they had lime instead, and got a condescending, dismissive answer, as if I didn't have experience eating pho at all. B*tch please.\n\nThe pho was disappointing in all aspects -- pathetically small bowl, noodles that didn't feel properly cooked, salty as fck broth that lacked the trademark aromas, and sad, nonexistent portions of beef (I ordered steak and brisket). If I wasn't so cold, soaked, and mad starving, I wouldn't have eaten as much of it and I would have said some choice words to my server.\n\nThe only saving grace of Mai's that day, were the stuffed fried tofu we got as appetizers. I'm glad we didn't order any of the fresh rolls, that probably would have been another disappointment. I didn't think it was possible to feel so disappointed eating at a Vietnamese restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-11-04", "description": "Going from window to window of restaurants along Clement Street I was bit intrigued by the fact that Mai's offered several choices of complete dinners.  For $12.95 these dinners included a soup, an appetizer and a dinner entr\u00e9e with rice.  After checking out the health score and noticing the bright red Yelp sticker on the window I decided to check it out.\n\nThe restaurant was empty, but it was a pretty early hour for me too especially for dinner.  Most of my meals come late.  My normal lunch hour is 2:30 PM.  My normal dinner hour is 11:30 PM.  Here it was at 5:30 PM, and I'm here for dinner?  The waitress lady greeted me with a friendly smile.  It's basically a sit where you want to type of restaurant as most of the tables seat four.  The restaurant is fairly clean and very well kept.\n\nAfter looking over the big menu a second time I ordered the complete dinner number 2 which included a crab and corn soup, an imperial roll, sauteed chicken with vegetables and steamed rice.  I asked the waitress whether I could substitute the steamed rice for brown rice at an additional cost.  She said it was okay to do so.  There are a number of Vietnamese beverages on the menu but I just opted for canned soda.\n\nService was very friendly and once the food was ready the items came out of the kitchen in rapid succession.  The Crab and Corn Soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ogif-GNQYoVNsc9mqI378w?select=ldTK4Uyotjn4kZYLb5KPoQ) looked like a thickened gravy but was actually quite light with shredded crab meat and lots of kernels of corn.  The seasoning was just right too.\n\nThe Imperial Roll (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ogif-GNQYoVNsc9mqI378w?select=7R-kRb-onGZZViOVeMOZVQ) was served with soft and chewy white rice vermicelli, red leaf lettuce, a sprig of fresh mint and a clear, golden dipping sauce accented by thin strips of red chili peppers.  The tightly packed filling consisted of lean pork, glass noodles, mushrooms and carrots.  Although quite tasty I found that the imperial roll was rather dry.  I don't usually use the dipping sauces that come with these rolls but I liked Mai's version which in addition to being sweet and sour had a very nice spicy kick to it.  It definitely helped this dish.\n\nThe Sauteed Chicken with Vegetables (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ogif-GNQYoVNsc9mqI378w?select=E53VktK7piZZRYCOkzy6kQ) was a nice mix of all white meat chicken, shiitake mushrooms, straw mushrooms, celery pieces, carrot stars, broccoli, zucchini, shredded bamboo shoots and white onion in a light brown gravy with just a hint of ginger.  The onion was undercooked and actually tasted raw and a few of the chicken pieces were overcooked and dry.  The serving size was probably enough for two people.  The serving of brown rice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ogif-GNQYoVNsc9mqI378w?select=mQ5trdIeNkdwia3faDMb1w) which came in a covered plastic bowl was probably enough to feed three.\n\nGiven the large portion of food I tried to avoid taking home any leftovers but I finally threw down the napkin and ended up taking home most of the Imperial Roll.  The server lady packaged it so carefully too with the rice and rolls in a take out box, the fresh vegetables in a sandwich bag and the sauce in its own tightly lidded cup.  \n\nBy the time I finished my dinner most of the restaurant had filled up.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

My mom had been going there for years and proceeded to bring me there as soon as I got out of the hospital.\n\nTo reviewers below who were not fond of Mai's, I'd suggest you order some dishes outside the realm of typical pho (noodle soup) you could find at any common pho place.  Try something new!\n\nMust order:\n- Imperial Rolls - These are, hands down, the best rolls you will find anywhere. They are large, made with special rice paper (rather than egg paper), and stuffed with vermacelli, meat, and other veggie goodness. They are particularly crunchy and have a distinctive flavor that will leave you wanting more. Comes with noodles and lettuce which can be used for wrapping the rolls.\n- BBQ Beef with Vermicelli Noodles - The beef is tender and charcoal broiled, which means it is completely delicious! I am pretty picky when it comes to meat, and do not appreciate fatty beef. There is no fat in sight on this beef, and it is very thinly sliced and wonderful. The noodles are served cold, which may be odd to people, but is delicious with the warm beef.\n\nOther items of interest:\n- Catfish in a Claypot - Very good and mildly spiced. Yum!\n- Crab Meat Fried Rice - Bits of crab meat mixed in with a not-so-typical fried rice. Not greasy at all.\n- 'Bun Thang' (Rice noodle soup with slices of chicken, Vietnamese sausage, egg) - One of my favorite soups ever.\n- Chicken Rice Porridge - Perfect when trying to get over a cold.\n- Chicken Pho - Their regular beef pho is great, but the chicken pho is a healthier alternative which is still delicious.\n\nIf you go to Mai's, follow some of my suggestions & must orders.

It's a mix of ground pork and chicken ... think it's the chicken that makes them so large.  It's wrapped in rice paper which makes it authentic; (The imperial rolls wrapped in flour wraps are not, really flour wraps, guys? Aren't those called wontons? Can we really call that Vietnamese?

The beef is not the traditional round eye slice of beef.

The broth is on the saltier side, which I like, but if you prefer a milder broth, be warned!  You can always add hot water I guess.\n\nYou can also tell this place has been around a long time.  They still refer to Pho on the menu as \"hot noodle soup.\"  And vermicelli bowls as \"cold noodles.\"  I think this is a holdover from the days when people had to be eased into what Vietnamese food was, so they made it sound as innocuous as possible.  I think it's funny.\n\nOh, and for those yelp reviews that claim it's not authentic Vietnamese because it's not run by Vietnamese people?  Plain wrong.  1) It is authentic. (Since when does it have to be run by native people to be considered authentic?  Thomas Keller is American, do people say his food isn't French b/c he isn't?

It had a paste-like consistency and tasted nothing like peanut. \n*Chicken Coconut Curry: UmMmMm...I didn't know curry was made with celery and black button mushrooms--weird!?!?!

Just to clarify, lemongrass is an extremely fibrous and \"woody\" plant and typically used as a delicious flavoring (kind of like a bay leaf)... not ground up in a dish! When I approached the waitress with my issue, she confirmed that they had ground up the lemongrass and mixed it in. She said that's the way they do it, gave me attitude and would not take back my dish even when I showed her the tiny, sharp pieces. \n\nI'm not sure how or why that's their recipe for this dish?

I have been eating at Mai's for the last 4 years, during two of those years I lived a block away (216 3rd Ave in case you think I'm exaggerating the proximity). \n\nI'm not the most adventurous of eaters so when I find a favorite dish, I don't deviate often. My meals at Mai's are limited to the following almost exclusively: \n\nBBQ beef/pork over Vermicelli noodles with Imperial Rolls - The fish sauce combined with the crispy, yet succulent, Imperial Rolls are great. I like the sauce without the carrots and I typically find about half of saucer is enough to flavor the Vermicelli since the noodles themselves are flavorless. \n\nPho Tai Nam - Not much warms the stomach on a chilly San Francisco day like a bowl of Pho. I like the Pho here in that it doesn't have the ginger-flavor that many other Pho restaurants brew into their broth, as I'm no connoisseur this is merely a personal preference rather than a metric on what defines good Pho. While I'd like to call myself a purist, I don't add any of the accoutrement (mint leaves, sprouts, etc.) simply because I don't like vegetables. \n\nEither dish is always enjoyed in tandem with a cold glass of Vietnamese Ice Coffee. I've never left anything short of satisfied. You won't be bowled over, I can tell you that now, but you'll likely still have enough green leftover to stop by Ghenki on the way out and grab a crepe. \n\nThe food I would say is only slightly above average, but with nary a wait and reasonable prices supplemented by an alacritous wait staff I can't help but my find myself fording the river of disorganized Clement st traffic to visit Mai's. Both of the waiters recognize me and know me by first name and I value that as part of my dining experience; I'm sure California will soon find a way to tax that experience, at which point I will resume cooking my \"Top Pho-men\" at home. Until then, don't bother crowding my SF treasure with over-expectation as I fear the day I have to wait for a seat at Mai's. \n\nSide note - I've read other reviews and I can't speak to the MSG question, as I don't seem to get headaches from it and generally don't mind MSG in less than gratuitous amounts I don't give it much thought when I eat.", "author": "Alex T."}

Lemonade is a constant source of frustration for me. Restaurants have recently decided it is perfectly reasonable to charge upwards of $4 for a glass of something if it does not come previously frozen.

Case in point here at Mai's.  The menu was so extensive, it was difficult to choose.   It would have helped if there was a separate list of house specialties or chef's recommendations.   I settled on their fresh shrimp roll and the chicken clay pot.   My friend had the beef pho.  The pho was ghastly (say that with Gordon's british accent:  Ghaaaahhhhhst-ly!) and my clay pot was only so-so.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-07-23", "description": "I'm looking at everyone's raving reviews of this place, and I really don't get it. \n\nOur experience here last night was TERRIBLE. \n\nLet me start at the beginning:\n\nWe were originally planning on going to Tu Lan for dinner. I like the #17 (cold noodle dish with imperial rolls and bbq pork). It's big, tasty, and really cheap. \n\nWe get to Tu Lan and find them closed (!?!?!?! It was only 8pm on a Sunday!) so we keep moving. Thought about heading to the lower tenderloin for Vietnamese, but then decided to try Clement Street. \n\nLooked at the menus at a pricier *but tasty looking* place a friend suggested, but decided to keep walking and find something a little cheaper. We came across Mai's and it had what I was looking for (the #61 on their menu). \n\nWe placed our order (#1, #31, and #61: Asparagas Crab soup, cold spring rolls (with pork) and the cold noodle dish with imperial rolls and bbq pork). The server told us that they were out of the asparagas soup, and suggested the corn. We hestitated, but figured it was worth a try.\n\nAs we sat and waited for our food, I noticed a hand written sign on the wall that read: \n\n\"Closed for Vacation July 23-August xx\"\n\nI thought about it for a second, and then realized.. \"oh crap. TOMORROW is the 23rd!!\" I was hoping they weren't just unloading everything that was left (spoiled, or about to spoil) on the unsuspecting customers... but looked around at all of the other (seemingly) happy customers who seemed to be really into their food, and dismissed the thought. \n\nCourse #1 - Corn and crab soup. \n\nAdmittedly, I hadn't entirely dismissed the \"unloading the contents of the kitchen\" idea, and when the (really fishy smelling) soup came out, I gagged a little. I tried it anyway, and wasn't into it. No big deal. I ordered something I had never tried before (at the insistance of the waitress) and didn't really like it.  We put it aside, and waited for the 2nd course. \n\nCourse #2 - Cold spring rolls. \n\nThese spring rolls cost $5.95. There were 3 of them cut up to equal 6. \n\nI tried to take a bite out of one, and couldn't get through it. \nThe rice paper was so rubbery and tough, a fork wouldn't pierce it. \n(The center part was actually hard.) I tried to take a bite out of a second one (just to see if it was just one that was off), and that one was even worse. \n\nMy S/O tried to do the same, and had the same result. \n\nI LOVE cold spring rolls... but these were disgusting (and old??)\nThese were the most rubbery (and partially hard) spring rolls I have ever had.  Even worse than the pre-made ones I got at Saigon Express. If the outside was that rubbery and hard, who knows how old the fillings were?!\n\nI'd like to note right here:\n\nI worked in restaurants for over 8 years. I'm EXTREMELY patient with waitstaff and restaurants. I am a really good tipper (20-35%) and \nI have NEVER sent back food.. until last night. \n\nThis was definitely a special case. \n\nWe tried to tell her (politely and discreetly) that the rolls were chewy and hard.  I told her we did not want them, but she insisted on taking them to the kitchen to \"make them soft\". \n\nShe brought them back out (the same ones we had taken bites out of).  They were still rubbery and hard, but now they were damp and warm as well. (Did she dunk them into a pot of water? Run them through the dishwasher?). \n\nTo be polite, I kind of poked mine (and maybe tried to bite it)\nGross. Again, we sent them back and told her we did not want replacments. She looked pissed. \n\nNote: there were 6 of these. 2 were completely intact, and 4 had small bites (where we had each tried to eat them). Essentially there were still 4 of them left. \n\nBecuase of her really assy reaction and the food quality we had experienced so far, we were considering getting up and walking out of the place... but figured they'd chase us down the sidewalk and call the cops, so we stayed put and hoped that the night would not end with both of us vomiting. \n\nCourse #3 - Cold noodle dish with bbq pork and imperial rolls.\n\nThis was ok. Not as good as others I have had (not as big either). \nWe ate the entire thing. \n\nRather than waiting for the check, I went up to the counter to pay. \n\nI watched her add up our check, and noticed that she had no taken the spring rolls off of our bill. \n\n(me:) \"Um. Why are the spring rolls still on the bill? We sent them back twice. They were not edible. \n\n(the waitress), \"No, You ate 2. Only 1 left\"\n\n(me), \"No. We TRIED to take bites of of them. They were old, hard and chewy. We sent them back TWICE\"\n\nshe tries to argue with me about it, but I turn to the man working and say, \"I will not pay for these\" Finally they come off the bill. \n\nI paid with credit card... was initially considering a chargeback. \nEh. It's too much work. \n\nWe ended up going to Nazario's for a slice, to fill the hole in our meal. \n\nTu Lan, I blame you for this.", "author": "I M."}

Don't eat a a Vietnamese place that serves pho unless it's got PHO in the name. (Exception being Turtle Tower, but they are Northern).\n\nFood here is good. My parents were eating here before I was a twinkle in their eye, and really - my dad was picky. Like, Really Picky. We wouldn't still be eating here if the food sucked. \n\nI have also taken my fobby as all get-go friend to this place, and she loved it. Loved the food, loved the service, loved the paintings on the walls (she said it all reminded her of home). \n\nEat anything that comes with rice, and the Imperial Rolls. I've never been a HUGE fan of anything that comes in a broth here, but I can say that everything else on the menu is beyond stellar. The price is right as well, and the owners/servers are polite and friendly. It seems like they REALLY do care that you have a nice time and enjoy yourself. \n\nThis restaurant is oddly always quiet, I agree, but I have never let it bother me. Case in point - I have never ever been to Balboa Sushi House (which is very highly reviewed on Yelp), and it's been busy. Give this place a shot guys - just don't order PHO.", "author": "Jessica S."}

Oh man i've been to alot of vietnamese places in the city that serve spring/imperial rolls and these are by far my favorite of the bunch.  If you knew me, you would know my diet consists of meat and carbs, thats mostly it, but at Mai's, my favorite menu item is the vegetable Imperial rolls.  They come with a great sauce and are perfectly made with the crispyness on the outside and the tender flavorful vegetables on the inside.\n\n2) The Service! I have to say that of all the mom/pop type establishes that i have been to in this city (and there are alot of them) i had by far the best service when i went to Mai's.  The owner was so helpful and patient and friendly that her demeanor alone is probably enough for me to want to come back here and support their business.\n\nThere are a few other things that make this place worth visiting.  Including the dinner combination's menu (if your not a picky eater) and the rest of their food dishes w/ rice are mostly very solid. the food was served very quickly and their prices are more than reasonable for the food portions.\n\nDefinitely recommend if your in the clement area and want to try Vietnamese food that isn't Pho.", "author": "Mark R."}

We looked at the menu and decided to order the shrimp rolls and vermicelli noodles with grilled shrimp.   My dining partner noticed that his fork was a bit dirty so he asked the waitress for new utensils.  The waitress was irritated (showed in her non-verbal expression) and quickly brought us new utensils.  After this incident the service went downhill as she didn't give us the same service as she did to the other guests in the restaurant.   Strike one!\n\nUpon receiving the shrimp rolls we noticed a darker hot red sauce in it so we requested more of this from the waitress.  Again she was not pleased with this special request and it showed in her non-verbal expression.  I only assumed that she was irritated because she sent someone else to deliver it to the table.  In addition, one of the rolls was also slightly dried and the shrimp had a slightly fishy smell which usually means it's old.  Strike two!\n\nThe lunch entree was okay and nothing to write home about.  The sauce that you pour over the noodles was not that tasty.   \n\nI wouldn't go back here again due to the service more than the food though the less than tasty food only adds fuel to the fire that sealed my decision to not return.  \n\nI don't enjoy writing this type of review but I feel everyone and the owners should hear from their guests.

Beef had a smoky barbecued flavor, sliced in thin pieces. Halfway through the meal, both of us became pretty full but couldn't resist having a couple more bites here and there until our leftover dinner for two became a small lunch for one.\n\nService was excellent--our waitress was delightful, and our dishes (all 4 of them) arrived in impeccable timing. Made for a very relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere. While there are a lot of restaurants options on Clement--some with a lot of hype, some not--I'd choose Mai's again over a lot of them.", "author": "Kelly R."}

I really love the grilled shrimp bun... and they still recognize me after all this time. Nice... :)\n\n-------------------------------------------\nI'm torn about this place, as it was one of my favorites for many years, even when it was located on Union Street, back in the day.\n\n I still love the huge veggie spring rolls, with cooked veggies and tofu, and although sometimes the bean sauce that comes with these rolls is slightly off-tasting, old habits die hard and I have yet to find any  other place that serves them like this, so I will keep buying them until that I can find them somewhere else.\n\nI've ordered rice noodles with grilled meats of various sorts many, many times here with mixed results: sometimes everything is fresh and wonderful, other times, it's a crap shoot. I ate here a week ago and had bad luck: the veggies were not quite fresh and rather than continue to eat around them, I just ate the marinated chicken and imperial roll on top, both of which were well done.\n\nI've starting to wonder whether getting a bowl of bun without having it ruined by bad produce, fish sauce gone off or spoiled meat is possible in this city. So far, my list of places where this has not been the case is a very short one: Sunflower on 16th/Valencia and the new/old place next to the Balboa theatre.", "author": "Melissa G."}

I have to admit this may not be the best place in the city for pho, especially for those who are use to having a major amount of MSG in their pho since this place does not use MSG anymore. \n\nMy favorite items on the menu are (in no particular order) \n1) Banh Hoi Nem Nuong (BBQ Pork Ball Wrap): This is a delicious wrap at the table. Don't know how the \"wrap thing\" work? No problem, just ask the owner to demostrate how it's done. You will get the hang of it sooner or late.\n2)Jelly Fish Salad: I know this might sound a little weird but trust me it is delicious, if you don't mind a lot of fish sauce. This item is very refreshing and good if you want something really light.\n3) Shrimp Spring Roll: Once again very refreshing. Very good for a small snack.\n4)Crab and Shrimp Fried Rice: Not overly oily like other fried rices out there. \n5)Chicken Clay Pot: If you want something more rich and savory then this dish is a dish you might want to try. However the downfall to this is because of the time it takes for the flavor to come out, it has to be premade. So that means if you don't want something in it you are out of luck, but other than that...good dish to try.", "author": "Van H."}

Tofu was crispy on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside.  Please note...do not eat right away unless you like the roof of your mouth seared off.  For your sake, wait 5 minutes for it to cool first; it is worth the wait.  $6.50\n\nPho (rice noodles in a beef broth) #12 (with beef and beef tendons) - the broth is deceptively dark.  The flavor of the broth is very light bordering on weak.  When we added the basil leaves, the flavor of the basil masked whatever flavor the broth had.  The beef was tender and quite flavorful.   $6.95 for Regular Size\n\n5 Spice Chicken - nice presentation with a generous amount of chicken.  Flavor was awesome and the pieces were really tender and moist.  I am surprised that the grilling only dried the outside of the chicken locking in the moisture.  This is a must order.  The rice that came with it was bit on the dry side though, but with a little bit of the lime/fish/chili sauce, it was fine.  $7.50\n\nThe bathroom - there was only a single co-ed restroom with an external wash area.  The other room was spacious and contained only a single corner sink and a long shelf under a long mirror.  The sink reminds me of an elementary school corner whitish porcelain sink.

I seem to go for lunch on Sundays, and that much pork in the middle of the day means a hard-core food coma, but so what if I'm beached on the sofa for the next two hours? It's so damn good!\n\nThe spring rolls are a little unusual in that the filling is packed really tightly, so it's more like a fried sausage (AW YEAH) than the usual in that you can't really make out the individual ingredients. But this is not a bad thing, and they're fried to golden, crispy perfection and served with the traditional very fresh lettuce, mint, and fish sauce.\n\nThe #70 pork plate just rules. Charred pork. Rice. Fish sauce. Awesome! What else do you need? Nothing! But they give you two sliced of see-better-days cucumbers anyway, which I leave because see-better-days cucumbers aren't actually that awesome after all. (Everything else seems super-fresh, so I'm not sure what's going on there.) This is a little different, but IMO better than the equivalent dish at Pho Clement, but you do have to order the spring rolls and pork separately here.\n\nThe service is ALMOST perfect (see below), the waitress is really friendly and sweet, and will make recommendations and happily bring extra sauce if you want it. Oddly, she's right on the ball until it's time to get the check, which can take some time. Once you ASK for it, it comes quickly, but finding and getting her attention in the first place can be tough, so ask when your food comes if you don't want to sit for 10-15 minutes after you're done.\n\nThis place deserves a lot more attention than it gets: the food is really good and relatively cheap, and the waitress is awesome.

So seriously... before you start complaining about this restaurant... give the authentic vietnamese dishes a try... other than thinking you are at a pho house just to order soup.", "author": "Anthony V."}

I had imperial rolls (not bad) and the hot and sour soup... or was it sweet and sour soup? The fish tasted like dirt which can sometimes happen with catfish but the broth was syrupy sweet... ick all that was in the soup was catfish, celery, tomatoes and beansprouts...oh and I almost forgot canned pineapple chunks.  Is this really an authentic vietnamese soup? Does celery even grow in vietnam?  I just can't see it.  4stars for the service- 1 star for food.", "author": "Paula Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-01-17", "description": "Mai's is fabulous. However, the disappointed people on here are probably telling the truth of their experiences, more or less.\n\n1.  There isn't really any \"staff\" that you will see here.  Becky and her husband are virtually always here working their tails off.  Last visit I saw him washing dishes; I don't know if they were short staff or what but that was interesting.  Anyway, they have pride in their place and their food so if you irritate them or insult them (and I think snobs telling them how to cook probably does that) they will let you know.  There's no supercilious manager to listen to your \"gripes\", and they don't mind losing your \"business\" at all.  This also means you will have to ask for your check when you are finished; they did not read the hipster restaurant management guide that requires a server to appear 10 seconds after the last morsel is eaten with a check in one hand and a smarmy \"anything else for you today?\" on their lips.\n\nHowever, if you come frequently and treat them decently they will definitely remember.  I don't think the quality of the food changes at all but they will welcome you every time.  Note you may not like this if you are not especially chatty.  But usually the drool in your mouth thinking of beef bowls wins out.\n\n2.  Not everything is great.  The pho is fine but a little small and a little pricier than other places like PPQ.  The goi cuon is good; get the shrimp version (or the tofu is fine I'm sure). I've never eaten a rice dish or any of the chinese-sounding entrees.  Couldn't tell you about the clay pot.\n\nBut the BBQ beef is the best I've ever had.  Haven't found any better in SF, and believe me I've looked.  The shrimp and crab imperial rolls are excellent.  Both of those come as wraps; you get a huge plate of lettuce, bean sprouts, noodles, carrots, cukes, and dipping sauce.  They bring you rice paper with the beef and hot water to dip the paper in (this is where the wrapping for your goi cuon comes from, if you've never done that yourself).  One order of the beef, shrimp, etc. wraps is enough for two people, ditto for the imperial rolls.\n\nThey make an excellent cabbage salad; we usually get it with tofu but I've had the squid salad too and that's good.  They have more than one dressing for this; they usually bring the fish sauce version which I think is better.  Note that this and most dressings is not particularly spicy; get out the chili sauce if that's a problem for you, or ask them for some chili paste if you must.  They get a lot of neighborhood folks who don't have asbestos lining in their mouths, and they seem to realize that chili is not the only flavor necessary in cooking.\n\nHowever, the \"hot and sour\" soup is very spicy, and very very very good.  Pineapple, tomato, bean sprout, and tofu (or shrimp or whatever) in an outstanding lemon grass broth.  I don't know why we didn't try it until a couple of weeks ago, but it's a new favorite and has led us to adopt  a new strategy: go for lunch and order additional items as takeout to have for dinner later.  \n\n3.  This is not a hipster hangout.  It's often fairly empty.  The walls are authentic 70's wood paneling.  The furnishings are standard-issue pho joint items.  They probably haven't changed the decorations since it opened, so it looks much like the Vietnamese places in Oakland (if any of those are even still open). It's not even as fancy as Yummy Yummy (which seems fancy for a pho joint).  It's often cold, particularly in the window seats, especially on a foggy day.  If any of this is a problem for you, head across the street to Burma Superstar where you will be surrounded with the convivial atmosphere only your own kind can provide, and in a large crowd that will reassure you that you are indeed cool.  Mai's is a neighborhood joint that serves good food to losers like me.", "author": "Spaulding A."}

The rice was also hard and dry.\nWe also had chicken pho and the meat was nasty. Albeit, I dislike the kinds of noodles used, but the noodles, meat and broth just didn't entice my taste buds; there was just something off with the broth like if it was a day old. Can definitely taste the MSG in the soup too. YUCK!\n\nI'm still gonna stick with Turtle Tower as the best Vietnamese restaurant for chicken pho!\n\nPS. I forgot to mention, did anyone else notice their utensils didn't match and they used McDonald's napkins? How cheap can they be!
