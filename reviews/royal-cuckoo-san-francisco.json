No cover charge, but they asked for tips with a reasonable recommendation of $5. \n\nA lot of the customers talked loudly even when Lavay Smith and band were playing. I found that distracting and rude.  Oh well. \n\nRoyal Cuckoo does not serve food but customers are welcome to bring food. I like that option!

That's straight up rude. I've worked in the service industry for years and would NEVER not give a customer their change back. Also the other bartender literally got in a screaming fight with my friend because he felt $5 wasn't a big enough of a tip for 2 drinks because he felt they were \"specialty\".

I visited on the evening of my birthday to share a drink with my partner after midnight, and we settled into one of the booths by the door and sat for a while.\n\nAfter making our drinks, the tender left the bar to sit on a chair somewhat close to us. He was making conversation with a man sitting near him, and after a while, he began almost shouting. I didn't have to eavesdrop to listen to what he was saying. \n\nHe started going on about how he believes that Caitlyn Jenner is \"a man who is pretending to be a woman for the money.\" He began to go in detail describing how the genitalia of trans women work (apparently he's an expert), and told the man how \"disgusting\" it all is. The way he was speaking made me think that he had been drinking way too much. Opinions about Caitlyn Jenner's character aside, I was extremely disturbed by this, got up, and asked him to keep his what he was saying to himself. He responded by saying \"Oh, don't give me that micro aggression bullsh*t\". We promptly left, and haven't come back since.\n\nI have brought several of my trans and fellow queer friends to this bar, thinking it was a place that we could feel safe and comfortable enjoying a few drinks.

It was a non busy night!. Finally my friends patience wore thin and she spoke up (personally i turned it into a game to see how long this could possibly go on) when new people entered and stood next to the bar and were served before us. \n\nWe had to speak to the male bartender who finally came back from whatever he was doing.

However, the service is completely rude and disrespectful. Tonight I tried to enter the bar to meet my two friends. There were two men engaged in conversation at the side of the door. Apparently one of them had the job of asking for IDs but didn't because he was chattin up his friend. So i walked in and then one guy asked for my ID. I apologized and said I didn't realize he was checking IDs and for the next 15 minutes I was lectured by this guy about how disrespectful I was for not respecting his position. I immediately presented him with my ID and he continued to lecture me, barring me from entering.The manager went outside to smoke and I asked him to intervene, since I was getting nowhere and just wanted to meet my friends. He shrugged the whole thing off and so then this guy lectured me for not respecting him enough by asking for another dude to intervene. Finally, I asked my friends to leave the bar and they soon informed me they entered the bar without their iDs even being checked. Apparently if you're a single woman, you're game for men unleashing their anger at the door. I've been going to this bar for a decade but I'm warning my friends off it from now on. Also, the guy threatened me after I returned to initiate a conversation with the manager.  I'd welcome a conversation from the door man.

I was also at Royal Cuckoo last night and her review is absolutely ridiculous. The bartender working was beyond nice and my drink was delicious. Megan and her group were RUDE and obnoxious and their behavior was not only appalling as grown ass humans, but as someone who claims to be in the industry, absolutely uncalled for. While the bartender was trying to get them change, one of the girls threw the contents of her drink over the bar and when the bartender told them to finish their drinks and leave (rightfully so they were acting like idiots) they started yelling and causing a scene. Megan, it was YOUR boyfriend trying to start a fight and telling the bartender they could take things outside. Yes, the bartender did say you guys should go back to the Marina, which is where I also thought you guys lived because it's mind blowing that you guys would act so ridiculous in any neighborhood, but especially a neighborhood that was yours.

I came in tonight with a few friends, all bartenders, including myself, and had the absolute worst possible service from the bar tender to the point where her cussed at us and screamed at us and asked to fight my boyfriend. All because we were nicely asking to replace a disgusting drink that clearly wasn't made correctly. The bar tender got so offended for saying the drink was no good (after 4, very well seasoned bartenders tried it and could not even swallow) and yelled at us \"Go back to the marina!\"  When we are clearly from and employed in  bernal heights! Unfortunately this bar is one my boyfriend has visited often throughout the past 5 years and was excited to show the 8 of us. After our extremely negative experience we asked for a receipt since clearly the amount of money the bartender was asking for was clearly far off from the amount ordered. After asking nicely for a receipt the bar tender said he couldn't give us one and asked jokingly if we wanted him to hand write one. Aside from his rude demeanour this is absolutely ILLEGAL to not provide a receipt! This bar tender is CLEARLY  making up his own prices and refusing to provide proof of price in order to increase his own personal intake!!  This experience was so foul I not only will never revisit, but I will spend every moment telling all of my  own regulars where to NEVER go! Absolutely appalled that someone like this bartender is even employed! I used to really value going around to neighborhood bars and talking \"liquor\" with fellow bar tenders, but clearly whoever hired this person was not in their right mind. For whoever this person is, I want to let you know I know plenty of sweet, good looking bar tenders who would happily take his spot and make you so much more money, you are so much better off without this rude, aggressive individual.", "author": "Megan K."}

The Royal Cuckoo has a cozy neighborhood-bar feel, with a funky twist.  Several couches and a few tables and a decent-sized bar that seats about 15 people or so.  The music is supplied by a house organ player.  Most importantly, they have an excellent selection of house cocktails -- the Manhattan is particularly delicious, and the Bitter Cup is a good call if you like Campari (I don't, but my wife loves it).", "author": "Andrew E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-09-24", "description": "Slow and solid cocktails with great beers.  The bar staff doesn't smile but I'm not paying for a dim lit  bar's keeper to keep A smile.  Make the trip for a drink, tip em well if you like the drink- they are way fast for making artisian cocktails- and when you tip well, you tend to get better spot in the order, $11 drinks to $5 beer, but I can easily say, the drinks are worth every last drop.  Great place for conversation, vinyl records, and a little cabaret that goes in once a while make for a good time.  A little love in a glass, a lot of good music, and making one of my favorite cocktails in this city makes this 5 stars for me.", "author": "Devin D."}

I wish more bars in SF would get into the detail that Royal Cuckoo has pulled off. There is plenty of interesting things to look at in the bar, which is something I really like.  \n\nI'm not sure it's worth coming here from far away, but as someone who lives a few blocks away, I welcome them into our neighborhood.  And I like it more than Bourbon and Branch, which is a little slick and gimmicky for me.\n\nPros: Great cocktails. Bartenders are nice and responsive. Amazing level of detail on the decor.  It's not too loud and they have a real interesting selection of music they play (all from LPs).  (I look forward to hearing the organ played one of these nights).\n\nCons: Not a lot of seating, and it's small.  The music is played on a vintage record player, over very bad vintage speakers.  I wish they would at least have some higher-quality vintage speakers; as it is it's a lot of midrange and no treble. (There was no bass in the old days for the most part).  Drinks are about $1-2 more than you would normally expect to pay. \n\nPetty Complaint: the women's restroom door is right next to one of the seating areas, and the door doesn't close itself. So after someone leaves the bathroom the door tends to swing open, letting the smell of bar bathroom waft over your cocktails.  They just need to install one of those spring things that closes the door after someone leaves it open.\n\nSo check it out! You won't be disappointed. It's a great addition to the mid-Mission area (which I refuse to call \"La Lengua\", heh)\n\n(4 stars instead of 5 because of the price of drinks and the bad sound. But really it should be 4.5 stars)", "author": "Rusty H."}

It was my friend's birthday who was visiting from Spain. She took her drink outside when she went to smoke a cigarette, she didn't know that wasn't allowed. The bouncer didn't say anything but when she tried to come back in he got really agitated. He told her she couldn't come back in. She asked if she could get her jacket and he told her no, get the fuck out. So I went to get her jacket and when I came back I told him he could have been polite, seeing being rude doesn't do much to help his bar. That's when he got super angry and told me to get the fuck out. I threatened him with a 2 star review on yelp (the drinks weren't terrible), mostly because I knew it would piss him off more. He called me a fucking tourist and said that for every 1 of me 10 more would come. So fuck off, etc. At that point I informed him it would be a 1 star review. He came outside at that point and looked like he wanted to get violent, so I left and he told me \"Don't come back.\" \n\nThe bartender was really rude as well, which was noticed separately by the 10-15 people I had brought to the bar with me. I think we are all banned now.", "author": "John N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-06-26", "description": "I was excited to stumble on this bar after a delicious dinner at Blue Plate - I am always looking for and trying new spots in SF.  The name was interesting, the atmosphere seemed inviting and it looked to be the perfect place to enjoy an after-dinner drink.  We ordered two seemingly interesting cocktails from the menu - I do love the different ingredients and flavors that bartenders create drinks with and I do have an adventurious palate.  Both drinks, however,  were undrinkable - overpowering and unbalanced flavors, not at all enjoyable (even after giving the drink a couple of sips).  I rarely ask for a replacement when at restaurants/bars, but when I do (as all customers should if they are unsatisfied), I do expect to be accomodated.  Not only was my request denied, I was told that we were the only ones that had ever disliked their drinks and that the drinks were too expensive to replace (really?).  The woman and her cohort behind the bar were both rude and I sat down for a couple more minutes and left pretty annoyed.  I vowed to write this review and let others know that if you were looking for any sort of enjoyable experience, don't visit this bar - it'll ruin your night.  I found it interesting that I am not alone in having had a negative experience.  Good luck, Royal Cuckoo - you might want to reconsider how your 'mixology' and how you treat your guests if you want to make it in this city.  Word travels fast...", "author": "Sarah P."}

Can't possibly sit face to face even though that could have been an option in their furnishing/design.  Watered down drinks not worth the very hefty price.  VERY long wait time for said watered down drinks.  Drink orders taken out of turn.  Then the Hammond organ.  That's fine, but don't come asking me for a tip because you \"don't charge cover.\"  That is plain desperation.  This place is in my neighborhood.  Believe me, I would LOVE to like this place.
