I love my City; won't hear any slander about it. \n\nBut. \n\nIf I'm being honest, 5 years in Philadelphia did spoil me when it comes to deli sandwiches. Felt like nearly every block had a very respectable sandwich deli who could turn out an 8/10 italian hoagie in 5 minutes flat. \n\nWe're sadly lacking when it comes to a proper concentration of that civic virtue -- and no, Togo's DOESN'T count. \n\nEnter Two Sons' Sandwiches. \n\nNow, I'm no sandwich cheapskate, so I'm not gonna argue with y'all about price. These folks have it down where it counts: \n\n* REAL SAN FRANCISCO SOURDOUGH -- crunchy, but soft enough to contain a sandwich\n* THIN SLICED DELI MEAT -- idk what the rest of y'all are doing with these 1/8th inch thick slices of turkey, but THAT'S NOT HOW YOU MAKE A SANDWICH. Two Sons' has this DOWN\n* PROPER SANDWICH SIZE -- hipster places need to GTFOH with these cutesy sandwiches with truly un-cute prices; if it's a two-digit sandwich, I should have to eat it with two hands\n* SPEED -- in, order and out in under 15 minutes, how it's supposed to be\n\nI'ma be here a lot, but at least now i won't be here for any further San Francisco Sandwich Slander.", "author": "Working M."}

This place has subpar sandwiches.\n\nI ordered their special - the smokin' joe and it was a pretty lackluster experience. There was way too much aioli (more of a watery mayo) and they didn't double check to see what I wanted in the sandwich. Put way too many pickles and stacked too much in the center. The sandwich was supposed to be toasted but the cheese didnt even have the chance to melt. In a city full of such good food, you could probably make a much better sandwich at the same price, ~$12.\n\nSmall nits about the sanitation: there was a tray filled with water with a few knives used to cut avocado, and the water was nasty: some white flakes floating around inside.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-11", "description": "With the way Yelp has helped connect people to previously unknown gems, it's pretty rare to find amazing places that still manage to fly under the radar.  And yet, there are places out there like Two Sons'.  Seriously, how the HELL does this place only have 166 reviews?!  Not that I really mind them not being \"a thing\" - I love being able to walk right in and order!  Talk about the perfect neighborhood gem...\n\nWhile there are several spots in the area that can offer up some tasty sandwiches, none of them can compete with Two Sons'.  Not only are their sandwiches amazingly delicious, but there are so many to choose from - over 30 varieties, as well as the option to create your own (starting at $8.49, with over 30 meats and cheeses to pick from!).  Add in their breakfast items and daily specials and it would take forever and a day to try everything they have to offer!\n\n-- THE SMOKIN' JOE - Smoked Turkey, Smoked Ham, Smoked Gouda, and Bacon topped with Chipotle Aioli and Jalapeno Potato Chips (toasted)...$11.29\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/two-sons-sandwiches-san-francisco?select=hT-2hP0Cm786sDjq0g7CYA)\nBetween the smoked meats and cheeses, this had a nice smokiness to it. The aioli and chips gave it a slight kick as well, which was offset by the veggies.  Though it bordered on being a little too smokey, this was still both solid and unique.\n\n-- WHATCHA TALKIN' ABOUT WILBUR - Ham, Bacon, and Prosciutto topped with Smoked Gouda on a Roll, toasted...10.99 \n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/two-sons-sandwiches-san-francisco?select=MEyhwUG7yOg_kUR9aqFqTw)\nIt's close, but of all of the sandwiches I've tried, this one is my favorite!  Talk about a pork lover's dream - love how well the ham, bacon, and prosciutto complemented each other.  Their Dutch Crunch is amazing, too!\n\n-- CALLING COBB - Roasted Turkey, Ham, Bacon, and Avocado, topped with Bleu Cheese on a Roll (toasted)...$10.49\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/two-sons-sandwiches-san-francisco?select=K1IcVCSYZxCMUcuI_TzCkw)\nQuite simply, this tasted like a Cobb Salad...but better!  The bleu cheese isn't overwhelmingly strong (in case you were worried), but there's still just enough.  I especially liked the avocado and bacon though, because, you know...avocado and bacon.\n\n-- DIRTY BIRD - Peppered Turkey, Salami, and Swiss Cheese with Spicy Mayo...$9.49\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/two-sons-sandwiches-san-francisco?select=fAipvBpB3oXXZTUl4ZrnSQ)\nOther than its peppery flavor, the turkey got kind of buried in this.  Not a big deal though, as their salami was terrific.  Still, the spicy mayo was the real star - so flavorful!  If this is what a \"dirty bird\" tastes like, I don't ever want it to be clean!\n\n-- MY GOUDA'S GREEN - Roasted Turkey & Hot Coppa topped with Smoked Gouda on a Roll (toasted)...$9.29\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/two-sons-sandwiches-san-francisco?select=h4uW3ayIzMdOA48gTaFYwg)\nI'd never though of turkey and coppa going together, but this showed me otherwise!  Admittedly, while the turkey and gouda were fine, the coppa is what made this shine.  It may not have had a ton of heat, but it still had just enough to perk up my taste buds.\n\n-- CLUCK FOR A BUCK - Grilled Chicken, Bacon, and American Cheese on a Roll (toasted)...$9.49\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/two-sons-sandwiches-san-francisco?select=RiUuqMSsitKVa9sDzdSP9g)\nFor whatever reason, I usually shy away from getting chicken in my sandwiches (there are so many more interesting meats), but this was great!  Especially the chicken, which was surprisingly moist.  Despite how the mix of ingredients is kind of basic, this isn't too shabby!\n\nGiven how extensive their selection of sandwiches is, it's still crazy to me how the six I've tried still make up less than a fifth of their menu.  Which means I have at least 24 reasons to come back!  Toss in their friendly and quick service, along with their budget friendly portions and prices (their sandwiches are huge), and Two Sons' has quickly become my favorite sandwich shop in SF!  I just hope they don't ever become TOO popular...", "author": "Mike L."}

First time was on a Sunday when they were closed.  This is a little odd in this day and age, but ok - it's their business and the hours are posted, my bad.  Lesson learned - or would have been learned for a person with a better memory.  Because I am daft, I had to return another Sunday after the gym to try it out before the fact that they are closed Sunday finally sank in.  \n\nFollowing that misadventure, I tried again when I experienced car engine trouble nearby.  What better way to wait for roadside assistance, I thought, than to finally sample these mythical sandwiches with a 4.5-star Yelp review?  I walk over to their storefront to find the doors wide open and the lights on.  It was a little before four on a Saturday - close to closing time, but not yet past.  I go in, ready to order - 'sorry, we're closed!' says the man, apparently ignorant as to what wide-open doors and bright lights during business hours signify to would-be customers.  I left, not too pleased.\n\nFinally, today, I decided to try one last time.  After again leaving my gym nearby, I double-checked their hours to ensure they were open, and made my way over at 3.  I get there again to find the doors open.  Looks like my curse with this place will be lifted at last!  I walk in, and open my mouth to order - 'sorry, we're out of bread.'  Out of bread.  Out. Of. Bread. A sandwich place.  Ok.\n\nThat was strike three for me. I'm glad people have had a good experience with this place, but for me, clearly it wasn't meant to be.  I'll go to sandwich shops with accurate business hours and a supply chain that can keep them from running out of exotic ingredients like 'bread.'", "author": "Jeff W."}

It means they stand by quality for the two most important components of a sammy. The glorious combination of quality meat and bread. Respect.\n\nTheir prices are very reasonable and they'll make the sammy just the way you want it. Nothing is too crazy or extreme for these guys. I usually get the hot coppa and italian dry salami on sourdough with pepperjack. But lately have been getting their tuna salad. It's not too heavy on mayo and it's not too mushy. Tuna done right, folks!\n\nI do recommend their garlic butter, spicy mayo, and pesto sauce for the spread instead of mayo and mustard. They also carry Deep River potato chips which I enjoy much more than the Kettle or Dirty Chips brand. Not oily and they have great crunch.

They also have a good selection of coffees. Very friendly service, but maybe don't go if you're in a rush, making good sandwiches takes some time.", "author": "Alicia C."}

Finally two sons sandwiches opened up in my neighborhood and i couldn't be happier with their sandwiches. The first time i went, i had the owner Joe make me any kind of sandwich he felt like. i only limited it to: No tomatoes and pack on the peppers! within a few minutes he hands me over a sandwich and said it was called Mongolian Monster. Boy was it amazing. They will be seeing me in there more often!  oh yeah, how could I forget the best part, they offer breakfast!! No more going to Noah's bagels where i have to wait 20 mins to order a bagel! yay!", "author": "Annie T."}

It's cozy to stay in or quick to dine out. I built my own sandwich with roast beef and it was incredible, piled high (but not TOO high). Next time I gotta get that horseradish cheese!", "author": "C S."}

He is always there with a smile at 6:30 in the morning so the people a UPS(across the street) can get their coffee(better than Starbucks). The sandwiches and the salads are great. They are very good at making sandwiches on the spur of the moment-any way you want them.  You'll be doing ONE thing right when you visit TWO Sons Deli!", "author": "Donald C."}
