I used to come here like 3x a week- it was an ugly time for me. \n\nThese are the desserts I've had:\n- Thai tea mill crepe. This dessert came with a little container full of Thai tea sauce that you can pour all over the mille crepe that's already oozing with Thai tea sauce. \n- Sticky rice and mango bingsu. What I love about their bingsus is that they have different shaved ice flavors. This one was plain milk (I think) and it came with generous slices of mango. On the side, they give you small dishes with mango puree, condensed milk, nuts, and sticky rice that has a beautiful coconut flavor to it. \n- Strawberry cheesecake kakigori. This shaved ice dessert came with yogurt flavored ice, topped with strawberry sauce and cheesecake cream. It was crazy good and the flavors went well together. It also comes with a side of strawberry sauce and condensed milk.\n- Melon bingsu. This one came in a melon that was carved into a makeshift bowl. It was filled with milk flavored ice and accompanied by spherical melon pieces and topped with a melon dome. It came with a side of nuts and condensed milk.\n- Thai tea lava toast. I'm a sucker for honey toast- if done right and this was definitely done right. The pieces were toasted enough to be a bit toasty and crunchy on the outside, but it was soooo soft and pillowy inside. It's topped with lots of whipped cream and a scoop of Thai tea ice-cream. The real surprise is cutting open the toast box. A lava of Thai tea sauce spills out for you to absorb with your pieces of honey toast.\n\nService here has always been great and they're always patient when I can't decide if I want one dessert or if I want to pig-out and get 5 desserts. It's a bit pricy but what can you expect in San Francisco. Quality of the food and service makes me come back for more. In fact, I might convince my boyfriend right now to go here after lunch!", "author": "Alex D."}

The crepe drizzle on top was a bit bitter due to the matcha but balanced well with the rest of the cake. There was a light spread of red bean paste across the dish and added to the aesthetics and sweetness balance of the cake. I was eating so quickly bc it was so good and wanted to ensure I ate the bigger portion. ;) a bit loud inside and felt slightly annoyed by the insta snobs taking endless photos within my peripheral, but I forgave them bc I'm actually one of them. \n\nI'd love to try the honey bread next time!", "author": "Juliana P."}

Unfortunately, all I got from today's visit was stress.\n\nI came with a friend in the afternoon for what we intended to be a short break. From my first visit, I knew that U:Dessert Story's shaved ice and drinks were quality despite its higher price range, so I was pretty excited to be back. We order a strawberry kakigoori, igloo kakigoori, and two cheese teas. The teas and strawberry kakigoori arrive, all seems well. 30 minutes later, my friend's done with his dessert and no sign of mine. We try to flag down two waiters to cancel who say they'll get back to us. 10 minutes later, another waiter comes with what I assume to be news of the igloo kakigoori selling out when we say we want to cancel. No \"sorry's\" mentioned. \n\nI try to replace the kakigoori with another cheese tea for takeout b/c I'm haven't had anything but a drink at this point. Okay, they said, and two minutes later they hand me the bill. No sign of the tea. Another 15 minutes pass, and we finally ask about it again. Finally 5 minutes after that, my tea finally comes and we can leave. I don't think I've ever been so relieved to leave a restaurant.\n\nGiven that I waited over an hour for just two drinks and a dessert that never came, it was a big waste of time on a Saturday. A 5 or 10 minute notice about selling out would have been totally fine, but 30-40 mins? It doesn't seem like a lot of efficient communication was happening between the kitchen and servers, and all the staff seem strung thin due to understaffing.

The Thai tea cream is so good and has a strong taste. I do think that Lady M's crepe cake is better made but this was still good.\n\nMango sticky rice honey toast: I was really confused how this would be served. It was a deconstructed mango sticky rice, where mangos, condensed milk, mango pur\u00e9e, nuts, and sticky rice were provided on the side. Oddly, my favorite part was the sticky rice...IT WAS SO GOOD! The toast is good too, and I like that they are cut into cubes so that they are easier to eat. I definitely liked this more than the crepe cake...it's a lot more unique and better for sharing!\n\nI was a little upset with the service. We waited a long time for our honey toast, thinking it was taking a long time to make. But then a waitress suddenly hands us a bill when we haven't asked for it.

Thai Tea Crepe Cake! Mango Sticky Rice Bing-su! In terms of selection, presentation, and taste, I was incredibly impressed with this dessert cafe. Somewhat pricey for dessert, but I thought it was worth.\n\nI've heard that the wait can be pretty crazy for this place a few blocks from Mission Dolores, so I easily made a Yelp reservation for my Friday afternoon a couple hours prior to coming. Easy-peesy. Though I would probably have had to do it much earlier for a night or weekend time slot. \n\nEverything on their dessert menu sounds good, but looking through the yelp pictures makes you want to try everything even more! My three friends and I made sure to get two of the most popular things on the menu though there were so many beautiful and delicious sounding desserts! We got the Thai Crepe Cake and Mango Sticky Rice Bing-su. Both were delicious and aesthetic af. \n\nThe Thai Crepe Cake ($12) slice had so many light layers! Loved the presentation with even some flower petals sprinkled of the side. All my friends know I love whipped cream and this was so next level, especially with the thai tea sauce that definitely tasted like the traditional drink. \n\nThe Mango Sticky Rice Bing-su ($13) was a great modern take on the traditional dessert. I loved that the bingsu ice was so light and airy. Some places have an uneven distribution of poured on the condensed milk/flavor on the ice but not this one. The fresh mango and mango puree was a nice touch on the side in case you want to keep adding extra flavor as you dig in. The rice on the side was so yummy I wished there was more! And the candied pistachio/almond mixture was non-traditional but added a nice sweet crunch to top it off. \n\nOverall: Was it pricey for dessert? Yes. \nWas it worth it? Hell yes. I think that places that add extra time to make delicious and distinct desserts with great presentation are definitely worth it. It's not like I'm going to go out of my way and take the time to make a beautiful cream crepe cake with a 20-something layers at home. It'd probably end up a sad one-layer mess of a pancake. \n\nDefinitely make a reservation try it.

I may have higher than average standards for shaved ice because my husband and I have really had some fantastic versions on trips to Taiwan and Japan. I was unimpressed with the versions at this place. \n\nFirst, most of the thought went into presentation and not the actual taste. Both the bingsoo and the kakigori just had a very basic fruit pur\u00e9e and condensed milk on the side. Second, these just tasted very basic to me and weren't anything special which was a huge let down for the steep $13.50 and $14 price tag. The strawberry one looked awesome and was topped with yogurt cream but flavor punch was just not there. Perhaps there should have been a squeeze of lemon added to the strawberry pur\u00e9e to kick it up a notch or even basil to elevate the dish beyond just average. So many possibilities to be more creative here. I didn't know that I couldn't top off the dessert once it came to our table and poured all the pur\u00e9e and condensed milk on top. Then when we finished the top layer, I had nothing but bland shaved ice in the middle. Maybe they should have said to hold off on using the sides for the middle because it has nothing in the middle. The cheesecake chunks on the bottom were really gummy and strange. Definitely off putting texture which was reminiscent of cheesecake but not good at all. The mango bingsoo was only better because of the side of coconut sticky rice which was fantastic. Rest of the dessert was very uninspired like the strawberry one. It came with a granola which is typical of a bingsoo and was a nice change up of textures but again the flavor punch was just not there. The mango pur\u00e9e was nothing special and neither was the condensed milk. Interesting concept and very creative to pair it with sticky rice but it all looked way better than it tasted. Third, the more I tasted the shaved ice, the more off putting it was like there was artificial flavoring in it. I asked our server if it was plain ice or flavored and she said it was milk flavored but it didn't taste like milk to me. If anything, it tasted like soda flavor that you'd find in Japanese candy. Weirdly fruity and unnatural. Not my thing at all. \n\nOverall vibe of this place is cute and I absolutely love the concept but I'm not big on places only for the photo to post on IG. I want my food to taste awesome and this place just didn't measure up based on the shaved ice desserts we ordered. Maybe the other menu items are way better and I might consider coming back to try the other desserts but I would not come back for the mango bingsoo or strawberry kakigori.", "author": "Betty R."}

Like mango sticky rice by itself, the mango is on top of the rice and combined the rice blends the sweet and sticky rice together where it all melts in your mouth... here it's room temp in a bowl on the side and you can't pull it apart to save your life. Two of us legit had to strategize and throw in arm workouts and teamwork to separate it.\n\nMoving on... we also ordered two drinks - the matcha latte (can't remember what my friend ordered) was good but too sweet. Same with the Blue Lychee - Wayyyyyyyyy too sweet. I wish you could tell them what level of sweetness you want like you can at boba places. \n\nOther than that, I love the interior, love the vibe, and staff were friendly.\n\nAs for you, Mr Lava Cake, I will be back.", "author": "Mandi W."}

Ordered the mango sticky rice bingsoo (!!!), Thai tea crepe cake, and blue lychee drink. It was my first time having bingsoo and definitely not the last! Korean snow ice is SO much better than any other shaved ice dessert I've had. I like how they have toppings on the side so you can add as much or as little as you want. Only downside is that it melts pretty quickly so you have to eat fast. \n\nBut omg, it was also my first time having a crepe cake and I FELL IN LOVE. I'm not usually one to fawn over cakes or pastries but the crepe cake was SO good. The second time I went that weekend I got the earl grey crepe cake, but I definitely prefer the Thai tea. It's light and not too sweet, and tastes just like Thai tea. Also comes with additional sauce on the side. \n\nThe Blue Lychee drink was okay, a little overpriced at $7 for a blue drink that tastes like canned lychee juice with lychee popping boba. Wouldn't order it again, but it was pretty. \n\nPrices are a little high, but that's expected, since the presentation of the food is absolutely beautiful. I can gladly say that the desserts taste just as good as they look. Can't wait to come back again!", "author": "Cecille W."}

The Matcha Lava Cake was yummy, the lava tasted mostly like chocolate and I couldn't taste the matcha as much since the chocolate flavor was overwhelming but in general it was soooo good just wished it was more matcha-y.

I would not recommend this dessert.\n\nMatcha Molten Lava Cake\n- The cake was baked almost perfectly, except the top was too thin such that the cake starts to collapse once you break into it. It tasted more like a chocolate lava cake and less so green tea flavor. It was also a bit too sweet. The worst part about this dessert is the ice cream. You can tell that they prescooped the ice cream and then stored it back in the freezer for easy retrieval. That caused ice crystals to form on the ice cream itself.

A friend had been telling her that she needed to try this place.  If you follow me on Yelp, you know I have a sweet tooth and my wife and I are big on dessert.  There was a line of about 10 people when we arrived at 9PM on a Wednesday night.  It was obvious that they were used to having lines because of they way they handled the situation by handing out menus to the first 5 people in line.  There was a little pressure to have one's order ready once one reaches the front of the line, but it was understandable, given it's a small place and was completely packed with more people than places to sit.  Our party of 5 ended up sharing a long table with another party of 4.  We ordered our desserts and then we were directing into the back room to sit.\n\nThe portion sizes for what we ordered are large, so these are desserts meant to be shared.

On the side you have sticky rice, some condensed milk, and granola/nut bowls that you can add to your like.\n\n\nChocolate Lava Cake with Matcha Green Tea:\nHonestly, probably my favorite thing there! Rich, moist chocolate cake with a warm, mild matcha goo oozing out. The green tea ice creek compliments the cake \nMy friend and I both made a note that the cake actually tasted like chocolate and wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. \n\nEarl Grey Cheese Tea:\nA very unique drink that combines the classic flavors of earl grey with a lightly salty twist from the cheese foam.

We got there around 7:30 pm on a Sunday and barely had to wait in line, but when we left around 9 pm, the line for tables was already to the door. People can stay and eat dessert for a while... so come early if you don't want to wait too long.\n\nWe ordered the mango sticky rice bingsu and the chocolate matcha lava cake. They both came within 10 minutes or so. I've never had bingsu before so I fell in LOVE with this. The shaved snow was sooo soft and powdery, and it completely melted in my mouth! I loved how you could add more condensed milk, mango puree, and granola topping. The \"sticky rice\" is almost nonexistent, and it's actually a bit salty (see the green rice in the pic), but it's a good contrast to the sweet snow.\n\nThe chocolate matcha lava cake was also really good. I'm not the biggest fan of chocolate, so I wouldn't order this again unless someone else wanted it. I wish it was a matcha cake with matcha lava!\n\nSafe to say, we couldn't finish either dessert...

We got the thai tea crepe cake, mango sticky rice bingsu, honey brick toast, and chocolate matcha lava with matcha ice cream. Here's a ranking of my most favorite to least favorite:\n\n1) Mango Sticky Rice Bingsu - This was my fave because it was the least sweet of all four. The sticky rice was warm and it was so yummy! I like that they gave both mango sauce and condensed milk on the side for us to pour over the bingsu. This way we can actually put the amount we want ourselves. If I had only gotten the Mango Sticky Rice Bingsu, I would've given this place at least a 4 star rating.\n\n2) Honey Brick Toast - This was my 2nd fave because the toast was very soft and the fruits complemented the toast very well along with the ice cream. It wasn't too sweet either. \n\n3) Thai tea crepe cake - This was okay. The only thing I liked about it was the thai tea syrup.\n\n4) Chocolate Matcha Lava with Matcha Ice Cream - I liked the matcha ice cream but the chocolate matcha lava cake was a bit too sweet for my liking. \n\nMaybe I'm just not into super sweet desserts so if you LOVE sweets, I think this place is a good choice. \n\nOverall, this is a cute little dessert place that is worth trying out.

Here's a breakdown of each item:\n\nSoft Bread w/ Triple Flavor Fondue - beautiful tray of soft bread chunks you can dip in vibrant hues of purple (sweet purple potato), green (pandan), and tan (Thai tea).  \n\nThai Tea Crepe Cake - fluffy layers of cake with a nice, well-developed Thai tea flavor\n\nDirty Matcha - great combo of coffee with matcha (unsweetened)\n\nEarl Grey Crumble - Earl Grey tea topped with a creamy cheese foam and toffee bits.

Instead of making a run for it, we decided to stay and ordered.We ordered the matcha lava cake and mango bingsu. Third thought, the presentation looked great but does it taste good? After the first bite of the matcha lava cake...damn this ish tastes good. Go head and take my money, just give me moreeeee. The lava cake itself had a rich chocolate favor and it was soft and moist. The matcha lava was warm and the green tea tasted really good. Matcha can be a hit or miss, the reason why is - it can be too bitter or too sweet but not at this place.The matcha was well blended, sweetness with a hint of bitter and in every bite, you can taste the exquiste green tea flavor. \n\nThe mango bingsu was definitely another hit item. The ice was shaved very well and fine. Mix that with some delicious sweet mango then it hits the spot. On the side there are nuts, condense milk, mango puree, and sticky rice. My tip is drizzle a little condense milk on top, add some mango puree and nuts then go in for a bite. YUMM decliousness. \n\nOverall, this place is expensive but it is quality dessert.

And since it is a sit down place with service, you'll have to pay for tip as well so the bill can quickly add up, but so far everything I've tried here has been amazing!!\n\nI've been twice, once on a Monday night and once on a Saturday, and let's just say I would recommend coming here during the weekday if possible. My friend and I were able to get seated immediately on Monday, but my group of 5 ended up waiting 30 minutes on Saturday night.\n\nThe restaurant decor is incredibly cute. For example, they have plants hanging in the ceiling. And it is larger than it initially appears, as there's a whole back area with tables/benches meant for larger groups. However, watch out as it can get very hot and stuffy inside. Both times I felt like I was burning up and quickly started shedding layers.\n\nThey offer a variety of Asian style desserts such as honey toast, bingsu (or snow ice), crepe cakes, etc. in addition to a good variety of teas and coffees. Most of the \"main\" desserts are in the $12-14 range, and expect to pay $4-7 for drinks.\n\nThis place was designed for Instagram, and they know it. Every single dessert I've seen here is perfectly plated in such a way to maximize its visual appeal, even regular drinks are served on a log tray with some flower petals. Fancy.\n\nSo far I have tried:\n\nMango sticky rice bingsu ($13): served with mango sauce, condensed milk, sticky rice, and crushed pistachios on the side. SO GOOD. My friend and I devoured this. The mango pieces they use are fresh and ripe (i.e. sweet and yummy). As a mango lover, I strongly recommend this dessert!\n\nChocolate matcha lava cake with matcha ice cream ($12): this was not available the first time I came, but they had it the second time round. It's very chocolate-y, though I think I tasted some coffee (unless it's just really strong chocolate) in my first couple bites? The matcha \"lava\" inside was delicious though, and had a nice but not too sweet matcha flavor to it.\n\nRainbow crepe cake with strawberry sauce ($12.75): this was a limited edition crepe cake offered only during pride week. The crepe cake was wasn't very sweet, as you're supposed to dip it in the sauce, but man, THAT. SAUCE. I was obsessed. If you ever get the chance to try the strawberry sauce here, do it!!! You won't regret it :D\n\nCoconut crepe cake ($12.75): if you like coconuts, then you're going to love this!

We arrived shortly before the after-dinner rush and only waited about 10 minutes. The line was out the door by the time we left. \n\nThis is one of the newest, trendy dessert places to open up in the city so expect a long line. Oh, and the desserts and drinks are Instagram-worthy? That means even longer lines. \n\nThe menu is a fusion of Thai, Korean, and Japanese which is pretty cool. We each ordered a cheese tea and opted to share the mango sticky rice bingsu - glad we shared because the portion is perfect for 2. I highly recommend trying the bingsu! We enjoyed all the toppings and it was a nice treat for the rare, warm-ish SF night. We can't wait to come back and try their other offerings!", "author": "Olivia V."}

I think I was even more disappointed because I've had such an amazing experience at Kitchen Story. \n\nI had this place bookmarked, so when I came up to SF for a visit, it was the #1 spot I had to go to. Four of us shared two dishes - Thai Tea Crepe Cake and Matcha with Red Bean Kakigori, which was a perfect amount after dinner. \n\nThe disappointment was primarily the Thai Tea Crepe Cake. For a $12 slice of cake, I expect it to be the best slice of cake ever, especially because the more well-known Lady M crepe cakes are around $9/slice. Unfortunately, this not only could not compete in flavor, the layers itself tasted rather soggy and unappetizing. 100% would skip this dessert since it's definitely not worth the taste and price.\n\nThe Matcha with Red Bean Kakigori was a lot better than the crepe cake, but the matcha sauce came out rather clunky and unevenly in comparison to the condensed milk. It was rather hard to pour onto the kakigori, so I can see why it was placed on the side. The red bean tasted super authentic, and was definitely a highlight of this dessert. \n\nIn my opinion, skip this place and just dine at their other restaurant, Kitchen Story, next door. The desserts are beautiful here, but the taste is subpar.\n\nAlso, on a last note to management, being seated next to the bathroom was very unappetizing for our party. I'm not sure how to counteract this, but the strong wafts of bathroom odor weren't very pleasant while eating. It made my party eat rather quickly to just get out of the smell. Service was also very rushed - I understand that it was busy, but after seating us, a waiter came over twice within 5 minutes asking if we were ready to order.", "author": "Bradford L."}

I don't usually drink coffee but if I were to crave an iced coffee ever in life, this would definitely be the one to set the standard.

The bingsoo looks pretty big so I would save that for a time where I didn't want to try the cakes or had more people with me.\n\nThe presentation was super cute and we used Yelp to make a \"reservation\" but I was able to check in earlier than the Yelp time and snag a table within 15 mins of waiting.

U Dessert Story really reminds of me of NYC's Spot Dessert Bar, but a lot better in terms of aesthetics.  The desserts aren't top notch in terms of taste (and I expected that going in), but they do look pretty.\n\nSo I came here on a Saturday evening, I would definitely recommend having an early dinner if you're looking to come here for dessert as the lines are still crazy busy.  I came here about 7:30pm and the line wasn't too bad, we got in fairly quickly.  However, when we left, the line had more than doubled in size.  \n\nThe inside of this place is really warm, they only have some fans running, but they don't help a whole lot.  Also, they kept tripping their circuit breaker, I lost count of the number of times this happened (often times happening multiple times within minutes of each other).  Hopefully, this gets fixed in the future.  The service here is great though, our table was checked upon constantly for water and just how our meal was going, it was above average for such a busy place.\n\nChocolate Matcha Lava Cake:\nAt $12 this was probably this one seemed questionable for the price.  It was on the small side.  It had a nice oozing matcha filling and was quite rich in matcha and chocolate flavor.  If you're really into either of these, then this dessert is for you.  Probably one of the richer items on their menu.\n\nMango Sticky Rice Bingsu:\nA little lacking in sticky rice.  Overall good, but the actual mango chucks could have been better.  Back to the sticky rice though, it only came as a side topping with no sticky rice inside the shaved ice initially.  The sticky rice was good but didn't taste fresh as it was only room temperature.  The shaved ice had a lighter taste.  Out of the 3 desserts I tried, the consensus was that this one was the least enjoyed.\n\nStrawberry Yogurt Cheesecake Kakigori:\nProbably the best of the 3.  I haven't seen Kakigori in the Bay Area yet, most of what we have here is Taiwanese style shaved ice.  It was great to have some Kakigori.  Overall, it was very delightful, especially if you like yogurt.  The only bad part about this was the unexpected chunks of cheesecake bites at the bottom of the shaved ice.  This would have been better off as a side topping like the sticky rice.  The problem here was by the time you reach the cheesecake, you're already full. And given that cheesecake is the densest part about this dessert, you'll likely have no desire for it, not to mention that it also tastes rather cheap like the cheesecake bites you see at froyo stores.\n\nU Dessert Story brings some nice trends to the table with great aesthetics.  If you do any research on this place, you'll likely know what you're getting into.  It's still a great place to grab a dessert, though it is pricey.  Just know what you're getting yourself into.", "author": "Bryson L."}

The pandan one was a favorite. \n\nMango Sticky Rice Bingsoo ($13.50) - this was the definite hands-down favorite! while all the desserts were good, this was so refreshing light and tasty.

The cake was very good, but rich.\n\nYoung Coconut and Pandan Crepe Cake ($12.75) - light and refreshing cake, comes with additional coconut sauce. \n\nService was great, everyone is very friendly and accommodating.

Interesting take on the standard chocolate lava cake. Sweeter than the other desserts, but still spot on\n\n- Mango toast with dipping sauces: Holy crap this one takes the cake. Love what they did to the standard brick toast with cubes of toast inside. There are three things to dip your bread in, plenty of mango to go around, and not too much stomach space left after eating this dessert.

It was a quiet weekend afternoon and the space provided much tranquility especially with the green plants strewn across the ceiling.

I think that's why some reviews say the cafe is small while others call it spacious.\n\nI came with 4 girlfriends and shared the Thai tea crepe cake. The presentation as you can see in the photo, was whimsical and fairy-like, much to my friends' liking. The texture of the cake was soft and spongy with the various layers congealed together as one. I couldn't really differentiate the layers, although that may have been the plan all along. It was sweet but not too much so, and the dipping sauce strengthened the thai tea flavor.

There's nothing to criticize here.\n\nThe Service: This is very nicely a sit-down restaurant where your food is brought to you.

This is mango pieces atop of sweet shaved ice with a caramel sauce drizzled on top. In addition there is condensed milk, nuts, additional caramel sauce, and sticky rice served on the side. It's presented beautifully (see photos below) and would like be enough calories to replace a meal for two people.\n\nTriple Flavor Fondue: 3.5 stars.

Thai Tea Crepe has like 20+ layers lol pretty cool how it was put together. Matcha Lava Cake seems to be pretty popular as we looked at our neighboring tables (most people ordered it), so we called this last minute. It came out with matcha filling all over the chocolate cake itself, so we asked our server if it was supposed to come out that way since yelp pictures showed that you're suppose to break the cake for it to flow out.. like lava. The server said yes then walked away. So we called the gentleman who appears to look like the manager there to ask about it, he said no then grabbed it away to get us a new one. We just wanted to be the one breaking it - afterall, that's what it's for? lol \nSeatings are are very tight since they have a narrow space and many people are waiting.

This is definitely a new Instagram dessert spot as all their desserts are presented so beautifully and colorfully. \n\nWhen we arrived, there was fortunately no line at around 7 PM. When we left though, the line had stretched to the outside of the store. I'm not sure how it usually is inside the store but it was really hot and humid with no AC. They did have some fans set out to keep the place cool but it felt like I was walking into a sauna. Granted, it was hot outside and it usually is never hot in SF. But the heat probably melted our bingsoo a lot faster.\n\nI was so excited for their mango bingsoo since I ate a lot back in Korea and I think the trend is just finally starting to catch on in SF with a few dessert places now opening up in the past few years that serves bingsoo. I have to say that U: Dessert Story is the closest in matching up for my expectations of bingsoo. Fresh mango fruit, fluffy ice, condensed milk on the side to drizzle on top, mango sauce among other toppings such as granola and sticky rice. \n\nWe also tried one of their mille crepe cakes. Unfortunately, they were out of the Thai crepe cake so we got one of their limited edition Rainbow crepe cake with strawberry sauce on the side. There's something really satisfying in cutting down a crepe cake with your fork. The cake was gone in a few bites since it was so light and not too sweet to eat.\n\nBoth desserts were around $12-14 dollars so it's not cheap. I would say the bingsoo is more worth it since you can easily share it with friends.", "author": "Diana C."}

Waited roughly about 15 minutes for a table of 3. The place is very small and hot. No AC. Just a couple of fans blowing in every direction. While waiting in line, I come to realize that if you get seated right by the restrooms which is in the middle of the restaurant, you can literally smell the restroom every time that door is open. I prayed while I was waiting in line that I do not get seated there because the smell was that bad. Anyway..\n\nI end up getting seated at the far back room. Hubby and I ordered the chocolate lava cake and matcha Frap. They were both sooo delicious! The cake was $12.95 and the Frap was $6.95. Quite expensive considering the cake was only the size of a small ramekin, but it was worth the try. There aren't a lot of places that sell this kind of cake so I was willing to pay this price to give it a try. The matcha Frap was rich and creamy, nothing like I tasted before. \n\nOverall, very unique place; yummy desserts were all served on natural wood slices which made it even more appealing and picture worthy.

And, you can reverse being stressed by eating desserts. \n\nWell, that's the theory...\n\nThis week, I had one of those: \"FTS, I'm Out!\" moments and ended up at U: Dessert Story. \n\nFor \"moral support\", I dragged my coworker out with me because she looked stressed too. \n\nGotta test that theory right? \n\nU: Dessert Story is a new dessert cafe spin off from Kitchen Story, a popular brunch eatery around the corner. They sell Asian inspired desserts: Bingsu (Korean shaved ice), Crepe Cakes, Honey Toasts, and Freakshakes which I'm assuming are ginormous dessert shakes. For drinks, they sell coffee, tea, and cheese teas. \n\nInitially, while perusing the menu, I was taken aback by the pricing: https://bit.ly/2wQOel9 BUT the craftsmanship, presentation, and taste is what you will find at a nice, sit down restaurant so it's totally worth it. \n\nOrder at the counter, seat yourself, and your order will be brought to you. There's complimentary fruit infused water. \n\nTo start, we ordered the Chocolate Matcha Lava Cake w/ matcha ice cream ($12): https://bit.ly/2IN90Hm.\n\nLoved the whimsical presentation. Slicing into the matcha dusted cake, we were met with a rich, goooey, molten chocolate center. The lava cake was satisfyingly decadent and not overly sweet. The matcha ice cream was the perfect complement providing a nice, cold temperature contrast to the warm cake. There was also toffee crumbles for texture.\n\nRoy's used to have the best chocolate lava cake but they've gone way downhill so this is my current favorite. \n\nWe also ordered their Signature Bingsu. One of the owners (?) said, their mangoes were really ripe today so we went with the Mango Sticky Rice Bingsu ($13): https://bit.ly/2IMuDHQ.\n\nWhen the Bingsu arrived, our eyes lit up. The bowl was piled high with finely milled milk snow surrounded by incredibly ripen sweet mangoes. The coconut sticky rice was served warm on the side along with mango pur\u00e9e, condensed milk, and housemade granola for some crunch. \n\nSo many delicious textures and subtle flavors. And, the milk bingsu itself was incredibly soft and light. It's a refreshingly cool dessert you can feel good about eating. \n\nI've also bought their Thai Tea and Young Coconut Pandan Crepe Cakes to try at home ($12/slice): https://bit.ly/2KzMiQf. The 20+ mille crepe layer cakes are good but not as their excellent lava cake and bingsu. I think the whipped cream filling needs to be tweaked a bit. I found it to have a waxy mouthfeel.\n\nThe two ladies (owners?) who run this dessert cafe are the epitome of true Thai hospitality: genuinely warm and gracious. They make you feel like you're guests in their home. Both checked in with us and neighboring tables several times to make sure we were enjoying our desserts and to refill our water cup. I would recommend providing a larger cup though for efficiency sake.\n\nFor a dessert cafe, there was good amount of seating: ~20 seats in the front and two large group area in the back that can seat another ~20 people. No outdoor seating, maybe in the future, they'll consider adding a table or two out front for furparents in the area (their sister restaurant is dog-friendly). \n\nOk, back to that theory - does eating desserts really reverse stress?\n\nMost definitely.\n\nI returned to work with a silly happy ending smile.\n\nChocolate = Endorphins\nMatcha = L-Theanine controls stress hormones  \n\nIt's proven so go out and write your own dessert story! ;)\n\n\n\n\n\n.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I'm sure it's because this place is still fairly new, but there was a backdrop with balloons at the entrance. \n\nWe kept it simple and only ordered two things: \n1. Matcha Float ($6.75) Are you a matcha lover?? This is perfect if you are!! This was sooo good and much better than I expected. It's not too sweet even with the matcha ice cream on top. Must get!! \n\n2. Chocolate Matcha Lava ($12) Soo good as well. This wasn't exactly what I expected, as I thought the \"lava\" chocolate interior would be spilling out as soon as I cut into it (also fine with me because then it would have been too messy). And it's actually smaller than I anticipated, but it was just the right amount for two. Since it's on the sweeter side, I'm glad I split this with another person because it might have been too heavy for me to finish on my own. Would highly recommend this item as well. Don't forget to eat this with the nuts scattered on the side! I didn't notice it until halfway finishing the dish. \n\nThere can be a bit of a wait (but we did go on a holiday). Luckily there was no wait for the bar facing the street, so we sat immediately). \n\nOverall, the presentation is excellent, and the ambiance/decor is all \"ig worthy.\" Not only is it served beautifully, it tastes just as good.

My party of three got a table without reservations with no problem early in the evening, although the line and wait time increased later on. I was full from dinner so ordered the \"ceremonial\" matcha and nibbled on my friends' shaved ice platters. The ceremonial matcha is just a small cup of plain matcha and at $7 seems way overpriced, despite being plated beautifully on a tree stump plate with a smattering of rose petal pieces. The similarly artistic shaved ice entrees are a much better deal. I enjoyed the soft syrupy pieces of mango on the mango shaved ice. The strawberry cheesecake one was a showstopper, rising tall out of its bowl, with actual cheesecake squares at the bottom. The white shaved ice looks like it would be plain vanilla but they are able to inject a lot more flavor into it; the strawberry cheesecake shaved ice clearly matched the description on the menu involving yogurt.

Lately I've been desperately searching to see new and interesting places on yelp.  So when I go to \"activity\" and scroll down, I stumbled upon the grand opening of Urban Ritual.  While on the business page, I scrolled down further to see more of the new businesses.  And there, I found what was now a very new and interesting dessert place!  One of its photos posted happened to be Bingsu (Korean shaved ice).  So I bookmarked it until I get there a week later.\n\nWhen I arrived at U :Dessert Story, I'm willing to get my sweet tooth on.  As I looked around the atmosphere, everything seemed super sweet.  Their menu was sweet as well (there are some of the unique selections to choose from).  I been so eager, but there are many patrons who have their order first.  It took me minutes to choose any dessert, and I had to ask questions.  Without a second to spare, I ultimately chose the Melon Bingsu (so much for my first chance this afternoon without a freakshake).\n\nAfter minutes pass by, my Melon Bingsu was as good as gold.  I was surprised my lovely waitress have carved out a cantaloupe dome to reveal chunks of cantaloupe balls and a coconut shaved ice inside.  Everything on the wooden board was great as it see it, pieces of almond, condensed milk, and a honeydew creamsicle.  Again, I had to ask questions before I finished the entire dessert.\n\nIt's nice being in a dessert place surrounded by many Asian patrons.  And a couple of sweet ladies working here, service with a smile.  I feel I'll come back if I ever needed to reverse being \"stressed\". ;-)", "author": "Jimmy C."}

I'd give this place 3.5 stars. \n- 1 star for the price cause this place is pretty pricey. We spent around $30 for two desserts, including tip. \n- 0.5 stars for the service. Service was meh, but it was busy so I get it. Our server tried to check up on us once or twice.\n\nAside from the service and price, I enjoyed the desserts! My friends and I came here on a Wednesday night around 8pm, and it was crowded. Luckily, we got seated right away.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Thai Tea Crepe Cake ($12)\n- Mango Sticky Rice Bingsoo ($13)\n\nBoth were delicious!

I'm not usually a brick toast guy but this one is good. For my next visits I'll probably venture out and try some other stuff but so far the bingsoo and brick toast is pretty good.

When I used the restroom I saw that it was the biggest one room public restroom I've been in before. I feel like in the layout of the store, it would have been better to cut out the space of the restroom so the store could accommodate more space for customers since they're pretty busy and crowded most of the time. \n\nBUT ANYWAY onto the dessert - honestly, this was the best and I'm not sure exaggerating, it was THE BEST dessert I've ever had in my entire life. I got the matcha lava cake and a slice of the Thai tea crepe cake. The matcha lava cake was everything I love in a chocolate lava cake - moist chocolate cake, and a delicious flowing center of matcha. As for the Thai tea crepe cake... my goodness... it was as if I laid my head on the softest pillow I've ever felt but that feeling was in my mouth  \n\nI am definitely coming here again!", "author": "Alyssa G."}

Flat out the dessert here are expensive so it's a good thing they are big! A slice of mille cr\u00eapes g\u00e2teau was more than enough for two of us. The korean snow ice is big enough for 4.

It just makes me happy. Not to sweet on it's own but can be sweet with the sauce.

I heard the lines for this place can get crazy, so we got really lucky! The whole store is extremely cute and the employees were attentive and friendly.\n\nAfter reviewing the menu, we settled on the matcha lava cake and the young coconut pandan layered cake. Yes, the prices for these desserts are crazy expensive (think $10-$15 for each dessert) but they come out instagram worthy and look like they're created by $$$$ dessert chefs. Also, they are pretty damn good! I don't really like chocolate, but the chocolate cake wasn't super sweet and tasted great a la mode. I loved the crepe cake the most because it was airy, light, and the flavors weren't overpowering. A plus is that if you're craving Lady M, the crepe cakes here won't taste like freezer burn!\n\nI would love to come back again, but maybe I'll share a dessert next time!

The interior and decor is so cute. The plants on the ceiling, down to the dishes they serve desserts on match the style, I thought that was a super cute touch. \n\nI'd definitely recommend going with a friend or small group so you can try multiple things, because I honestly don't know how'd you'd choose just one, and most of them are pretty big portions (especially the bingsus).\n\n*Coconut pandan crepe- great texture, not too sweet. I probably wouldn't get again as there are too many other things too choose from, and i actually prefer sweeter desserts.\n\n*Mango sticky rice bingsu- this hit the spot. The mango was perfectly ripe, and all the the ingredients to go on top were amazing. Just when you think it doesn't get any better, you get to the condensed milk at the bottom *drool*. I do wish there was more sticky rice, but that's just because I'm fat hehe.\n\n*\u00a0Earl grey cheese tea- The tea itself is actually amazing.

Although they don't have ube or black sesame, they do matcha and thai tea very well. This spot has taste to match their aesthetics! The only down fall? Their price. Expect to pay $12+ a dessert. \nFOOD: \nThey have most Asian desserts any dessert lover would want - brick toast, mille crepe, lava cake, bingsu, drinks, etc. Unfortunately, they ran out of matcha lava cakes when we were there, but we shared 3 plates among the 4 of us: \n+ Matcha Bingsu: Loved it! Unlike most bingsu, where they just add powder to the ice, this place actually mixes in the matcha with the ice so the taste is more thorough. They also give you plenty of extra matcha and milk sauce if you want extra flavor. It also comes with red bean and mochi.\n+ Mango Sticky Rice Brick Toast: I usually don't like fruity desserts, but this one wasn't bad. They had real mango pieces - not canned - which is huge plus. The stick rice is on the side rather than on the toast and was saltier than we would have liked. They also gave us mixed nuts and mango sauce. We found pipping bag pieces in our toast, which was quite unpleasant - but they were nice enough to reimburse us. \n+ Thai Tea Mille Crepe: The thai tea flavor could be a tad stronger. Even with the extra sauce, I feel like the thai tea flavor was diluted with the creaminess of the sauce. Overall, the texture was super! \nSERVICE: \nWe came on a Sunday night and there was no wait. The staff is welcoming and the dishes did take some time to come out, but expected.   \n\nAMBIANCE: \nThis shop took over where Ike's sandwiches use to be and is located right next to Kitchen Story.

Instead we ordered the chocolate matcha lava cake. It came with a small whip cream and a kid size scoop of green tea ice cream. The cake itself is dark chocolate, and in the inside, there's the matcha. Initially I didn't taste the matcha because the chocolate was over powering. However, if you taste the sauce by itself, you can taste the matcha. The ice cream was on top of caramel bits and there were two slices of strawberries on the whip cream. Unlike the shaved ice, this dish was small. There was less of an visual impact, but it taste really good. I don't think I can eat the whole thing by myself because the cake started to get heavy near the end (too much chocolate for me).\nI would like to come here again, but I would imagine there will be a long line.

There can be a bit of a wait due to large crowds, depending on the time you come (with weekends being the busiest). Nevertheless, this place is worth the wait! The interior design of the place is modern and chic, with glass domed lighting fixtures hanging from the ceiling and cool artwork gracing the walls.  \n\nI came with a party of six other people, and was seated in roughly thirty minutes on a Saturday afternoon. Though the options on the menu are a bit pricey, the presentation of the food and their taste made up for the higher expense. My group opted to get matcha floats (which come with a scoop of matcha ice cream), mango sticky rice bingsoo, matcha lava chocolate cake, and thai lava toast (with the thai ice team flavored ice cream swapped out for vanilla ice cream). \n\nThe aestheticism of the food, and their respective themes, was mind blowing to me. The matcha lava chocolate cake came on what seemed to be a tree ring type of plate, with the words 'U :Dessert Story' engraved on. Going along with this earthy theme was the bits of sprinkled matcha powder adding a green, natural touch to the earthen plate. The mango bingsoo came on a platter sprinkled with flower bits, which made for a cute touch. \n\nI myself tried the thai lava toast, which came with a bread-brick enclosure containing thai ice tea flavored sauce, little cubes of toasted bread, topped off with whipped cream, sprinkled almonds, and vanilla ice cream. Condensed milk came in a container on the side of the platter, along with assorted fruits such as strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, and bananas with hazelnut chocolate bits interspersed. I absolutely loved this dish, with the crunchy bread bits (along with the sauce), tasting like little pieces of heaven with each bite. The combination of flavors exploding in my mouth made this one of the best brick toast desserts I have ever tried. The cold ice cream made for a cool combination with the still warm bread cubes. My only complaint is that the thai tea flavored sauce was all concentrated on the bottom, drenching the bread cubes at the bottom, making them soggy and way too sweet. Other than that, this dish was perfect. \n\nAll in all, I will definitely come back to this establishment.

I stopped in after dinner, at ~8:30pm on a Tuesday, and didn't have to wait in line, which I was worried about. The server that greeted and sat me was extremely nice and adorable. I ordered the mango sticky rice bingsu and waited maybe 10 minutes before it arrived. For starters, it is a beautiful looking dessert. The tray and measuring style cups were made of the same wood and it made the dessert seem extra special and expensive. Everything tasted great!! Eating it deconstructed or all together.\n\nThe large bowl is the mango chunks over thinly shaved ice - which was a new way for me to experience the dessert. It has a little of the mango sauce and other toppings on top, but plenty of extra and other new toppings on the side. It was nice to be able to add your wanted toppings over and over when you hit a new level of the shaved ice rather than have the restaurant add it all for you at the beginning. Don't get me wrong, I loved this dessert, but all I've ever known is mango chunks over warm sticky rice. Although there is a small cup of sticky rice on the side, I wanted more rice!!

Not a complaint per se, just an observation in case anyone loves the sticky rice like I do. I ate this entire dessert by myself (which was totally doable) and I would have been bummed if I'd had to share the small rice portion with someone else lol.\n\nI thought their check drop was cute having been paper clipped to a book!

This place is located in the Castro's so it's a bit difficult to find parking in that neighborhood. Its on the same block as Kitchen Story FYI. (I'm not sure if the owner is same or different from Kitchen Story). Anyways, my boyfriend and I came here on a Tuesday night and we got there around 8:50pm. We got seated right away and was given the menus. The place is a small so you'll feel extra cozy with the neighbors next to ya. They gave us flavored water which tasted delicious btw lol. \n\nSince it was night time, we decided to go for caffeine free teas. I ordered the herbal chamomile fusion tea and my bf went with the ginger lemon tea. The herbal chamomile fusion tea had lots of flavors in it and was super tasty. The ginger lemon was just a simple taste and literally just ginger and lemon. For our desserts, we shared the mango sticky rice bingsu which is the shave ice with toppings on the side. It was super yum!! I wanted to try the matcha with red beans but by the looks of everyone's dessert, I knew it was going to be big so we decided to just get one. :( Anyways, the mango sticky rice bingsu was amazing! The shave ice was like huge! It had cut up mangos, mango sauce, and some granola looking things. They also give it to you on the side if you need to pour more! Overall, service was great and the desserts were amazing! The only downside it is kind of on the expensive end but it's worth the try! I'd definitely love to try other things on the menu next time I'm in the area! :)", "author": "Monica W."}

I ordered Thai tea crepe cake, matcha lava cake and the mango sticky rice Snow Ice. I was surprised that the rating today went down since I'm gonna go there again tonight to try out the other stuff on their menu. To my surprise, they have some recent bad reviews. This place deserves a 5 star for their hard work of making people who loves dessert happy. For the people who wrote bad reviews below me, you guys should open your own restaurant and let's see how you feel when you guys get 1 star yelp review after working 16 hours a day and spending so much money on expenses. Some people just feel so entitled when they are not entrepreneurs themselves. What happened to humanity?\n\nAnyways, ditch the bad vibes and come to this place happy and ready to spend. If you can't afford it, then go to somewhere else you can. Don't come negative and hide your face behind the social media. If there's something wrong, talk to the manager. I love love love this place and I am definitely coming back tonight", "author": "Sherry C."}

We got the Thai tea crepe cake ($13) and the mango sticky rice toast ($13). As a side note, this place does not sell crepes, just crepe cake.\n\nThai tea crepe cake: Thin layers of crepes and whipped cream served with a Thai tea sauce (black tea + condensed milk), a blob of whipped cream, and half a strawberry. It was not too sweet. It's very rich and mostly tastes like whipped cream.\n\nMango sticky rice toast: I really liked this. It's a hunk of toast carved into a bowl. Inside the bowl are toast cubes topped with whipped cream (a huge amount), mango sorbet, and fresh mango. On the side you have sticky rice, granola, mango sauce, and condensed milk. I really liked how many textures and flavors there were, and it was an awful lot of food, so I'd say it's more worth the price than the cake.", "author": "Elaine L."}

Interior is nice, clean, and refreshing. \nWhen ordering, staff was really helpful in picking out items. They have some stuff for people who love fruity type desserts and others who tend to go for more chocolatey things. \nAll the desserts are plated on a sliver of tree trunk with scattered petals along it. Great plating and visually pleasing to the eyes (aka Instagram worthy ). \nHaven't had a dessert I wasn't satisfied with. My favorite is the Matcha Lava cake; an explosion of flavor! I like that their bingsu dishes come with additional side bowl ingredients so you can kind of customize and add according to your preferences. \nI definitely recommend this place.

After much consideration (and clarification from the friendly waiter about the difference between Japanese and Korean shaved ice), we settled on the mango sticky rice bingsoo. Honestly my mind was blown - it completely eclipsed my previous mango bingsoo experience from a dessert place in LA called Meetfresh that was severely disappointing (but that's a Yelp review for another time) - the presentation was absolutely gorgeous. Separate tiny bowls held extra pistachios/nuts, mango puree (?), condensed milk, and actual sticky rice (which in itself was again garnished with cream and nuts!!)..then, the actual bingsoo was a beautifully fluffy and huge mountain of condensed milk snow (the shavings were so light that they instantly melted on your tongue, leaving a wisp of sweet milk taste), surrounded by glossy mango pieces, topped with swirls of mango sauce and a mint leaf. It was so incredibly thoughtful how they layered all the toppings within the ice as well so it was still equally flavorful inside, and even moreso to have the extra toppings on the side for you to add yourself. And after everything else there were crushed flower petals dusting the whole thing. This dessert went above and beyond both in taste and aesthetics!", "author": "Shelley P."}

On the other hand, the cake slice was much smaller than we expected it to be, the Thai tea frosting tasted a bit off, and the cake itself wasn't as soft/moist as I'd hoped--if you've had Lady M crepe cakes before, you'll be disappointed by these (especially for the $10 price). Neither of the desserts wowed me in taste, but the toast is still worth a try!\n\nWould come back again to try some of their other offerings!

So my score is around a 3.5 stars.\n\nLets start with the desserts:\nSo we ordered the pandan crepe cake, thai toast, and strawberry cheesecake yogurt bingsu.\n\nThe pandan crepe cake was 3/5. Was pretty good flavor, but texture was weird with the creme. The creme was thick and chunky; something silkier would be better for the crepe cake and finer texture. \n\nThe strawberry bingsu: this was pretty bomb bingsu. The snow ice is PERFECTT. I cant wait to try the mango sticky rice one.\n\nTHE TOAST: My favorite thing. The crunch, the flavor. Perfect bite of taiwanese toast. I really love thai tea so the flavor was on point.\n\nService is super attentive and nice and pleasant.\n\nNow onto the cons:\n\nThe drinks. Definitely a thumbs down. They made me a hot instead of a cold matcha latte, but quickly corrected. But the latte itself was overall on the heavy side, matcha then a heavy layer of whipped cream makes it overbearing and too heavy to drink. The additional matcha powder on top really added to the heaviness as well. This was one of those \"it looks hella Instagramable but was a let down.\" \n\nButterfly pea latte- the milk was burnt. Pretty straightforward on this one. Also butterfly pea latte? It's pretty floral and aromatic tea and a delicate ingredient. It's really being overwhelmed by coffee and milk. I was genuinely intrigued by\nIt; but also a bit of a disappointment and I couldn't tell if it was because of the pairing or because of the burnt milk. \n\n\nThe setting- So if you haven't seen already, a lot of the display setting is set on a wood plating;  however upon my visit and receiving my order there was a pretty bad odor coming off those boards. The smell was from the board setting and having that smelly sweat smell from not being dried right after being washed and retaining the odor. Im glad that it came with my drink and I hadnt ordered with the cake. I had them send back the boards back after getting the drinks but having them sit there for a few minutes was kind of off putting with all the amazing desserts sitting in front.\n\n\nOverall desserts yes definitely come; I will be back to try some other desserts for sure myself. I will probably avoid drinks for now.", "author": "Tay N."}

The moment we got out of the car and started crossing the street towards dessert story, I noticed it was next to Kitchen Story, one of my favorite brunch spots that I hate waiting 2 hours to eat at . \n\nThankfully, this dessert place didn't have a huge line out the door. (In fact, we got seated immediately!) I suppose it's because it was a Tuesday night at around 9pm. They're opened till midnight so it's a perfect place to chillax and catchup with some friends, tea, and desserts.\n\nAs I walk through the door into Dessert Story, I instantly felt like I stepped into a k-town/LA Korean cafe. The atmosphere and decor inside are SUPER cute! By cute, I mean a mix between chic and hipster (wall of succulents, cute and fresh flowers, a wall of polaroids on a string, cute chairs that are made of metal buckets, etc.) it's the kind of place where you would make your significant other take a million IG photos of you in... I mean, that's what I did (although the SO has a track record of taking bad pictures )\n\nI looked through the menu and chose two items that appealed to me the most: Mango Sticky Rice Bingsoo ($13?) and the Thai Iced Tea Mille Crepe Cake ($12). To go with those, I also got a cup of Hojicha tea ($5). The total was kind of of ridiculous for just desserts but when you eat that mango sticky rice bingsoo... it's suddenly worth it. I will come back again and again for that bingsoo! \n\nThe Mille crepe cake was not amazing to me but it did have great texture. I have a bit of a sweet tooth and the Thai tea crepe cake was not sweet enough for me (despite drizzling the sauce it came with and left over condensed milk over the cake). It does have good tea flavor though so not complaining!\n\nOverall, the photogenic desserts were not only pretty, but they were delicious as well!

As we waited in the cute cafe atmosphere we were served basil and strawberry infused water.\n\nMy friend got the crepe cake and I got the Thai Tea Lava toast cuz I just had a papaya salad and it's chilly out...\n\nIt's pride so this week they only serve the rainbow cr\u00e8me cr\u00eape and they offered a choice of strawberry sauce or earl grey infused chocolate sauce.\n\nI almost got a cheese tea as well but I'm glad I didn't cuz when the lava cake arrived it was a lot bigger than I thought. I don't think most people can eat the whole thing by themselves. I personally ate perhaps exactly half of it and my friend ate almost half of the rest and we had leftovers.\n\nThe crepe cake slice is as small as shown in the pictures. We think $12.75 for a slice is pretty steep even for SF... does Tartine even charge that much for a slice of cake? The earl grey infused chocolate sauce was very tasty, however. I would have been interested in trying the coconut crepe cake too.\n\nDessert here was more expensive than our dinners... but all in all it's your usual $$ SF food. The lava cake really knocked us out. \n\nI'm docking a star because the food is definitely not good value (tbh I've never eaten anything good value in SF except for when I cook it myself ).", "author": "Mei Mei C."}

This will be my go to spot from now on for refreshing,\ncreative desserts, not to mention a cute ambience. We arrived at around 8 and didn't have to wait in line before being seated. Our group of three ordered a total of four items: the matcha latte, chocolate tea, mango sticky rice shaved ice, and the thai tea crepe cake. I can't speak for the chocolate tea, but the other three items were delicious! Matcha latte was standard, nothing special other than a dollop of matcha ice cream on top, but that doesn't mean it wasn't great. Thai tea crepe cake was really interesting and yummy, but probably a one-time thing for us. My personal favorite was the shaved ice - the shaved ice itself was a lovely texture, the mangoes were perfectly ripe and sweet, and the side toppings it came with (condensed milk, savory sticky rice, mango pur\u00e9e, and sweetened nuts) were all fantastic and really complemented the shaved ice well.

I did wish that the melon bingsoo had a little more going on, it was cantaloupe, snow, condensed milk, shaved almonds, and melon ice cream.  A lot of ingredients, but similar tastes.

I liked the hanging greenery, wooden table and decor, and white contrast against the wood. It wasn't over the top but very thought out. \n\nDessert: we chose to share the matcha bingsu between the 3 of us because it seemed reasonable. It was a matcha flavored shaved ice with purple dusted mochi pieces on a stick, redbean on top and on the side, condensed milk on the side, and a sweet milky matcha syrup-like condiment on the side. I really enjoyed the matcha bingsu because it felt light and refreshing and seemed like the perfect dessert after a big heavy meal. The shaved ice hardly seemed sweet which was fine because the sweet side condiments allowed you to control the sweetness level and I appreciated that! The purple mochi was delightfully chewy but the purple dust overdid it for me because it tasted floral - maybe like a rose flavor and I didn't like that too much. Overall the dessert was 5/5 still! \n\nService: this is where it goes downhill for me. My two friends and I got seated fairly quickly and when the waitress came to take our order, we said we'd all share the matcha bingsu and she said \"That's it?!\" To which we replied \"yeah, that's all we'll start with for now!\" After about 15 minutes, she quickly walked over to us and asked \"You want anything else?\" To which we replied \"no, that's all we'll have.\" She just made it seem like it was wrong for us to come and sit down for just one dessert, but the dessert, we thought was quite a large portion size. When we got our dessert, the person who set our dessert down did it so quickly and haphazardly that our stick of mochi completely fell as soon as it was set on the table messing up the shaved ice. The pretty dessert no longer looked as pretty :( lastly, as we were finishing our dessert, our waitress came by and asked \"Are you done?\" And feeling rushed we said yes. She quickly came by again with our check. It was pretty busy and so I get that they would probably want to get us out as soon as possible for others to be seated and served but it felt rude to us to be treated so carelessly. Perhaps, it was just an off day for our waitress or maybe she didn't know she came off rudely, but my other two friends also felt like we were not treated well as customers. 2/5 for customer service. \n\nAll in all, I am willing to come again to try other items because the dessert was so tasty, but I wasn't too happy about service. However, it may have just been an off day for them, so we'll see! Hopefully I'll have a positive update once I go a couple more times.", "author": "Christina C."}

I came here with my friend on a Sunday at around 3pm, and the place was crowded, with a line out the door. There is seating in the front, as well as a little more in the back. Since it was just me and my friend, we were seated immediately since there was a small empty table that was available. We quickly ordered, since we knew what we wanted. While we were waiting for our dish, people who were seated after us got their dishes before us, making us wonder about our order. We waited half an hour before we mentioned anything to the servers, and once we did, we got our dish within 5 min. making us think there was a miscommunication. Because the servers don't have set particular roles (they all rotate amongst seating customers, taking orders, serving customers so not one person does a single role), there was definitely room for miscommunication and errors. The servers were great, but the service model is not up to par. We got the strawberry cheesecake shaved ice was amazing, and the portions were big for 2 people. There's condensed milk and strawberry syrup on the side that you can pour in as you chip away the shaved ice.

It made my dessert craving go away real quick.\n\nFood-wise, we got the strawberry yogurt bingsoo that tasted weirdly like ramune, which was an unpleasantly tarte flavor combo.\n\nWe also got the matcha latte, which I would actually give a 4/5 (ignoring the fact that the dirty sock smell overpowered most of my taste buds).\n\nThe matcha latte and the cute aesthetic of the place bumps the place to 2/5 stars but I would strongly recommend wearing a face mask or perhaps putting on an overwhelmingly powerful perfume before coming here.", "author": "Jess L."}

We went twice in a row, and the first night, we went in just to check them out after dinner cause we wanted a coffee, but their machines were broken, so we settled for tea.  We didn't get food, but the waitress we had was so bubbly, and sweet and awesome.  So we told her the we'd come back the next night and try their dessert.\n\nWhich we did...we had their coconut pandan crepe cake.  The best dessert we've had to date!  Pandan is a very popular south east asian dessert/ingredient, and I've never had it in a crepe like cake.  $13.25 or $12 for a slice.  It comes with awesome coconut sauce with coconut slices in it.  A bit pricy definitely for the cake, because it was a regular size crepe cake, but I would come back again.\n\nWe also ordered their mango bingsu, which is shaved ice.  The shaved ice is pretty fluffy, and you get sides of extra crunchy nuts, mango sauce, and condense milk.  It was very yummy and it was actually light in sweetness.\n\nNow lets get to the waitress that helped us.  She took our order, and repeated the order back to us.  When we got the dessert we got 1 correct item and 1 incorrect item.  Then they come back and asked us what we ordered, and we told them.  Then we get our correct order.  But when it came to our bill, they charged us for more than what we ordered.  So this is the 3rd time we've said something about our order.  We were super disappointed.  \n\nAll in all, we'd come back again, and hope their customer service is better.", "author": "Amy A."}

We were quickly seated and the waiter was very accommodating when we wanted to change seats to be near a certain area with cute decor. The decor is amazing throughout with plants and balloons everywhere, so definitely a spot to take some cute pics. It was pretty slow when we first got there but was much busier by the time we left around 2. \n\nThe food was amazing, both with presentation and taste. We ordered the matcha red bean bingsu, strawberry cheesecake bingsu and Thai tea cake. The bingsu was very light and I loved that they came with not only milk like usual but also matcha and strawberry sauce, as well as extra red bean for the matcha. The strawberry bingsu was a bit tart but if you're a fan of something not too sweet it's a great option! The Thai tea cake is hard to describe but it was also not too sweet which I really liked! \n\nThe only downside is the price. For three desserts split between three people we paid $17 each, which is what I would normally want to pay for dinner, not dessert.

The pandan coconut, had a hint of pandan. I'm love pandan so I was disappointed at the lack of the pandan flavor. The coconut cream sauce was delicious.

If you give me a line of matcha I will snort the shit out of that. But anyways back the main topic. The dessert here is amazing and I do love the vibes it has as well. They got these cool little wooden plates that they serve the dessert with and I'm not gonna lie I was about to steal it but the thought of being banned from this place scared me. The chocolate matcha lava cake gave me what all the foodies call a foodgasm. That shit was straight crack cocaine. It literally took me 10 minutes to get a picture for Christ sakes. Just looking at it made me cry. Usually when I eat matcha dessert the matcha has a really subtle taste but with the lava cake it was like taking it to a whole new level.

Littered with small plants and cute wooden furniture, I could definitely see myself just spending the afternoon here with friends, enjoying the desserts they have to offer! And that's exactly what I did.\n\nGoing off suggestions from friends, I ordered the Mango Sticky Rice Bingsu (~$15) and my friend got the Molten Lava Matcha Cake with Matcha Ice Cream (~12). There were only about 5 tables besides the little counter/bar area so we got our food pretty fast.\n\nFirst off, let me say that I was blown away by the presentation! The earthy feel from the wooden utensils really matched the interior and the little details (such as the rose petals on the matcha lava cake) really made the dessert 10 times better.\n\nNow, THE FOOD. Wow is an understatement! \nMango Sticky Rice Bingsu ~ After drizzling my mango sauce and condensed milk on my mango bingsu, I took the first bite and was instantly transported to dessert HEAVEN. I would like to throw in that I am not at all a fan of sweet foods, however I would come back here every day if it didn't ruin the special takeaway I got from this place! Just the right amount of sweet, melty, and just PERFECTION. I couldn't stop going back for another bite! A nice touch was the warm green sticky rice I was given on the side; A little more savory so it balanced the sweetness of my bingsu!\nMolten Lava Matcha Cake ~ The richest lava cake I have ever had! Filled with warm, sweet matcha sauce, this dessert is good for those who love their sweets or anyone with a massive sweet tooth! I could only stomach a bite or two before I returned to my bingsu, but my sweets-loving friend ate the entire thing and licked the plate clean! It's THAT good!\n\nService was very kind and all the workers were responsive. They were constantly filling up our water, checking up on us, and asking us how the food was! 10/10.\n\nOverall, I love this place.

Bathrooms are fairly big and clean. Space is okay for SF (typical size in SF, not big but not crazy small). Now, food and service! We waited probably 15-20 minutes. What irked my friend and I though was that we basically had to do the job for the waitress. There were two seats by the window that we saw open for like 10 min. so we finally decided to inquire about it. After we inquired about it, we got seated! It was like she completely had no idea those seats were open, but I'll let it go since they're new and it still seemed a bit disorganized. After we got seated though, service was great! Size of the desserts are big and they were all delish! The mango bingsoo had warm sweet rice as a side which was really nice.

After seeing all the IG-worthy pictures of U :Dessert Story's desserts, I knew I had to make a trip. Parking wasn't too difficult on a random weekday afternoon but I can imagine that it'll be disastrous during peak brunch times. \n\nI did a bit of research (aka looking through everyone else's pictures on Yelp) and concluded that it might be in my best interest to not eat a meal before indulging in the sweets that U :Dessert Story has to offer.  The desserts are huge! (perfect to share but you can hog one all to yourself). I've tried the mango bingsoo, melon bingsoo, matcha kakigori and matcha lava cake. The pairings with the various snow ice can differ. For instance, for the melon bingsoo, I've gotten a scoop of an ice cream vs. an ice cream bar. However, all of the snow ice comes with a helping of condensed milk. The presentation of everything (food + decor) is so very aesthetically pleasing. \n\nMy favorite out of all of the things I've tried would have to be the mango bingsoo. The snow has a delicate texture and is full of milky flavor. When paired with the ripe pieces of mango, it is perfection. \n\nThe melon bingsoo comes in a close second. It comes with half a cantaloupe that you can slice yourself (the waitress helps you cut the first slice). Inside this fruit dome, there's balls of cantaloupe and snow ice. I received a side of ice cream and it complements the snow.\n\nThere is a slight hint of matcha flavor in the kakigori but it was not as strong as I would like. The matcha lava cake had a rich, chocolately flavor...like a really fudgey delicious brownie and the matcha flavored lava was ok. \n\nPricing was a bit higher than what you would usually expect at a dessert place, but it is warranted.

Initially ordered the earl grey and lavender crepe cake but it was not available. Bingsoo come with sides of condensed milk, more flakes, mango syrup, and a bowl of sticky rice. I've never tried sticky rice with mango shaved ice so I wondered what it would taste like but it was a good combination. It tastes like mango sticky rice with a bit of sweetness and creamy taste added to it. Very good and unique. Young coconut crepe was delicious too- not too sweet but visually very pleasing with layers of crepes with flower decorations on it. I loved the look and the taste of it both. If you order one bingsoo and a cake for a party of two it's a good portion- it's pretty filling I skipped dinner. Interior design is very cute with succulents here and there. I love this place!

Not to mention the jam/jelly on the ice tasted salty. Never tasted anything like that before....Maybe bec it's artsy or it's a new cafe.. if it wasn't for my boyfriend who wanted to take me out for our anniversary, I wouldn't have checked out this place. \n\nIf you are considering this cafe, but are also care about your health, I wouldnt recommend bec the amount of sugar on their shaved ices is ridiculous.. We came out so thirsty and literally wheezing for air bec of the amount of sugar we consumed from the shaved ice we shared. Whatever buzz we had from dinner before going to this cafe was definitely killed instantly from the sugar lol \n\nDon't think I need to spend $15 for bingsoo where I can go spend $10 for something that tastes way better. pretty sure they don't use some organic ingredients either lol so confused why just shaved ice with cream on the top needs to cost $15\nI noticed a previous review had the same complaint, but a dessert place being new doesn't give it any excuse to overprice a shaved ICE", "author": "Lauren K."}

Overall service needs some improvement but dessert was good overall. \n\nMy favorite is the chocolate matcha lava cake.  The chocolate wasn't too sweet and the matcha lava did not overpower the taste.  The cake itself wasn't hot so the chocolate tasted more like fudge but had it been hot, it would've tasted amazing.\n\nMy second favorite is the coconut pandan crepe. It had the perfect amount of sweetness and texture was good.\n\nThe least favorite would be the mango sticky rice bingsoo.  For me i felt it lacked some flavor.

We had an early dinner on Friday and arrived at this place around 7pm - no wait but the place was about 60% full at the time. I'd imagine that there would be quite a wait later in the evening. Parking could be a bit tricky in the area. The space is a bit cramp - you can easily overheard other people's conversation. But the desserts make up everything. We got the chocolate matcha lava cake with matcha ice cream and we were so impressed by the quality of this dessert. I'm never a big fan of chocolate but in this dessert, the perfect balance of the sweetness from chocolate cake and the bitterness from the matcha \"lava\" made me finish the entire dessert in no time. Also, the different temperature of warm lava cake and matcha ice cream perfectly complements each other. Since we were a bit full already, we ordered the thai tea mille crepe to go. It did not disappoint - not overly sweet but still creamy. Pricing wise, I'd say it's reasonable in the city. It's definitely not cheap since all dessert items average around $10 (or above). But the quality makes the pricing justifiable (well it's the same pricing as having a dessert in a higher end restaurant). It's a perfect spot for whoever loves dessert in the afternoon or after dinner.", "author": "Phoebe T."}

The line wasn't as bad as I thought it was and I waited about 45 minutes for my seat. We ordered the coconut crepe cake and \"melon\" bingsoo. \n\nCoconut crepe cake ($12.75):\nThis was honestly a dissapointment. First, you pay for a slice of cake not for like a small cake that cost $12.75. IMO I don't think a slice of cake should cost that much UNLESS it completely changes my perspective on the food. This cake is not one of those. I have never tried Lady M or other crepe cakes but I think that this cake was bland and honestly nothing special. What really astonishes me is that for an extra dollar, you can get bingsoo or kakigori (more on this later). I probably didn't get the best crepe cake as the highlighted one didn't seem as appealing to me or my girlfriend. I would not recommend coming here for just the crepe cake. Go to a nicer bakery if you want a slice of cake.\n\n\"Melon\" bingsoo ($13.00):\nYou might have noticed that I put \"\" around the word melon. That is because it should have been called a canteloupe bingsoo. Our bingsoo (Korean shaved ice) came in a small canteloupe and with some ice cream. This was WAY better than the crepe cake was but with the name such as \"melon\" bingsoo I was expecting variety of different melons. The bingsoo was tasty and for $13.00 it is definitely something that should be shared as it is A LOT of dessert. I am curious to try their other bingsoo and kakigori as they seemed interesting but I don't want to wait in those lines again.\n\nAtmosphere: \nBeing set in the former original location of Ike's Sandwiches, it is pretty small. There appears to be more seating after first glance but it still is small. It was pretty dark and if you like taking photos, you might struggle a bit. The noise level wasn't that bad but I would not come with a group larger than 4.\n\nOverall my experience was okay at best. I felt the wait wasn't worth the food and the prices were more lucridous that I would have hoped. The atmosphere is nice but there aren't many reasons for me to recommend this for you unless you happen to be in the area. This would not make a good date spot unless you like waiting for 30 minutes and it's not very good for groups.", "author": "Brian H."}

The presentation was sooo cute. This restaurant is so on top of their aesthetics. The snow was so fluffy it felt like I was sticking my tongue out in nature and catching fresh snow. The mango was perfectly sweet and silky - not overly tart so it overpowered the other flavor components and the sticky rice and the nuts were such great textures to contrast the shaved ice with. I loved how the experience was very interactive with the toppings in separate containers so you could choose how much condensed milk to put on it and that there were an ample selection of toppings. One complaint I frequently have with shaved snow is that there aren't enough toppings, so there's not enough going on, but this was not a problem at all. When I first saw that the mango bingsu was $14 I was quite flabbergasted b/c I'm not used to paying so much for dessert and I just thought there was no way it would be worth it, but I was proven wrong. I don't know if I would regularly shell out this much for dessert, but it's definitely enough for sharing and it makes you realize the limit of how delicious bingsu can be is even higher than you previously thought!! The service was good, but when you first enter the place, it's not very clear where to wait and if anyone is going to help you, so that was a bit confusing.", "author": "Naomi J."}

That doesn't change or assess the fact that the cost is a bit higher than most venues for dessert. **\n\nHonestly the coconut pandan cake was splendid and  is a must order. However the melon bingsu was flavorless (melon under ripe) and the condiments kind of clashed with the flavors. If I went back I'd try the mango sticky rice flavor. The menu is nice and the concept is so cute; however I have a few qualms:\n\n1) Price is just honestly excessive. I respect that this is an expensive city and I would hope most everything is made in house, but the price is competing with venues for a full meal. Most food items were around $12-$15 and drinks $5-$7.\n\n2) Service was sooooo slow and inefficient. It was not overly busy but the servers were not working to keep the cafe moving smoothly leaving tables unbussed. There were three servers when I went and it took ten minutes to get the check, another ten for it to actually be charged - 20 minutes total to get out of there. There was a line forming so we wanted to be considerate and free up the table but in general the service was slow and inattentive. Customer service was not their strong suit, the waiters were very cold and barely communicated at all.\n\nThey just opened so if I really want the crepe cake again I may try it in a few months, but it isn't worth going out of the way for. It's a great concept, the menu seems lovely, and the location is cute. But I want to understand why they have chosen to charge so much and why the service is so lackluster.

I got suckered in by the wooden aesthetic place and the minimalistic decor.\n\nThe dessert was expensive yet average and lacking in quality. I got the Thai Tea Cakes and the Strawberry Cheesecake Kakigori. Not really worth the price--all hype for the gram. The Thai Tea Cakes didn't really taste like tea and was way too sweet for my own liking. The Strawberry Cheesecake Kakigori was mediocre and tasted like yakult. \n\nThe service is what bothered me the most. Our total was around $33 and we paid $35--leaving us with around $1 in change. As we were still seated, the waitress comes up to our table and tells us that we shouldn't tip a dollar because San Francisco's minimum wage is $15. I was taken aback because I just wanted change for my larger bills and did not expect to be flagged down for not tipping. I told her that the amount was not including tip and she left our table alone to go get the change. \n\nI have never experienced this kind of service at any San Francisco restaurant. As a fellow San Francisco native and employee, I am very aware of minimum wage in the city. It was definitely awkward and appalling to be chased for tipping.

It's a *huge* bowl of green tea shaved ice, with a little red bean and two small pieces of Mochi. I think the dish would be better with more toppings. The red bean, while fresh and homemade, was made with kidney beans instead of adzuki beans. The dish was also very expensive.

The scent of baking and sugar and fruit just entices all that pass through that door. It was delightful to be able to see the workers in the back actually construct your dessert.\n\nWe got three things, which totaled to $45:\n- Mango Sticky Rice Bingsoo (Korean shaved ice): was kind of expecting more sticky rice but the other toppings provided were really nice! Gorgeous plating and the snow ice was super fine!\n- Thai Tea Lava Honey Toast: when they said laval, they mean lava -- it was quite the show!! Definitely recommend for first timers. Honey toast is a classic and the little twist they added to it made it more desirable. My boyfriend had never tried honey toast before and he said afterwards that he could not find a dessert to compare to it.\n- Plain Honey Toast (togo): the basics, served with condensed milk. Good even after we had taken it home!\n\n\nReason for four stars instead of five:\n-- Unfortunately, the store is very small and slightly cramped but they make the best of the space. \n-- Getting seated was a pain. There's no instructions on where / how you are to line up, so I walked up to a waiter inquiring about seating for a group of three (we had no reservation) and they told us to wait outside until we were called in to be seated. Understandable. However, another group of three that came in after us did the same and were seated immediately even though they had no reservation. Huh?? I had to ask another waiter to make sure that we were seated next.\n-- Service is also very abrupt; I understand that there are many customers and things are always coming out of the kitchen but when you are taking orders, please don't pounce on your customers words. We changed our minds twice as we were ordering and it seemed our waiter was counting down to a timer, just waiting to jump away. Not a very welcoming / calm ambiance.\n-- Also, server to kitchen communication is poor: we asked for our last order to be in a togo box on THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS to THREE DIFFERENT WAITERS (just to make sure!) and it still arrived plated. We had to pack it ourselves.", "author": "Angelica N."}

If not, they must have done a good job searching for good supplier), Mango Sticky Rice Shaved Ice (this reminds what I had in Bangkok, excellent job). I saw one other reviewer said this place is overpriced. But I think this place is very reasonable priced for the presentation , atmosphere, and quality of food.

It's a great place to hang with friends, but I'd recommend bringing a small to medium-sized group as U :Dessert Story is a cozier place with less space to walk.  My family and I ordered the Cheese Oolong Tea, apricot peach tea, a glass of hot water, a chocolate matcha lave cake, and a mango sticky rice bingsu (bing su is a Korean finely shaved ice dessert).  As far as beverages go, the teas were unique & good, but, personal opinion, we're not fans.  The apricot peach tea we found too sweet; it was supposed to be hot, but came out \"cool\"/room temp.  I ordered a simple glass of hot water, but it came in a mason jar with a handle; water stayed hot, but I would suggest the water be in a different container other than a mason jar so diners would have an easier time handling hot liquids.  The cheese tea was different, but my mom preferred otherwise (nothing personal toward the restaurant).\n\nAs for the desserts itself, we all loved the chocolate matcha lava cake (which includes matcha green tea ice cream) & the mango sticky rice bingsu.  Just the right amount of sweetness, and both definitely IG-worthy!  Picture the viscous, green, matcha lava flowing from the smooth chocolate cake...mmm... Our personal favorite was the bingsu; finely shaved ice with sweet mango cubes, and you are given a variety of toppings: cluster of almond (I think?), coconut sticky rice, mango sauce, and condensed milk.  Newly opened by the owners of Kitchen Story, and it's 4 stars in our books (3 hand clap emojis)!  Do I recommend?  Yes!  Would I give it a return trip?  Yes!", "author": "Jessica S."}

One of my friends doesn't really like coconut but she actually enjoyed it! The lava cake was dense and you can really taste the matcha flavor!

Didn't really have to wait too long for the food. I really recommend the Mango Sticky Rice Bingsu and the Mango Sticky Rice Toast as they were my favorite out of all the desserts I've tried (They were also the most worth for the price) The matcha Lava Cake was also good, but I think that people looking for something not too sweet will like it. Strawberry Cheesecake Yogurt Kakigori was also good, but the mango one is hands down my fav. The Thai Tea Lava Toast was the least favorite as it had an unfamiliar Thai Tea flavor. I'm giving a 5/5 because I enjoyed everything, but a 4/5 for the overprice for the smaller portioned desserts (Matcha Lava Cake/ Crepe Cakes).

First and foremost, if you're looking for inexpensive desserts..this most definitely is not the place. I knew this beforehand that the pricing wasn't in the normal range. Display of the desserts were cute and high end looking so I'm taking it as that's the reason why the price is in the higher range.  \n\nOnto the actual desserts. I ordered the mango bingsu and coconut pandan crepe. Yes, again the display is nice. But that pretty much is it for me. I'm a big fan of desserts and have had my fair share in SF. WOW factor is not there for me and rather just impassive to be quite honest. The overall taste was not bad, it's just not there for me. I feel they can do a lot better especially for the price range.\n\nAnother thing I would like to point out is how the shop is run. Being as they are super busy, they really need to have someone up front taking down names to reserve a spot. I saw a worker walking around with a clipboard and calling out the next group so I thought the waiter would come and take down names of the new faces that walked in. In this case that wasn't the ordeal. A lot of people stood, waited and were kept confused on what they were supposed to be doing and I was one of them. I feel they really need to be on top of those who come in and have no clue if they have to wait for someone to acknowledge them or what.", "author": "Ann S."}

We ordered the mango bingsoo, the thai tea crepe cake, and coconut pandan crepe cake. We waited about 45 minutes to get our food. The people who were seated right before us were finished and leaving while we still waited for our food. The server even came by 3 times and kept asking if we got our food - and all 3 times, we said \"no, still waiting\". All we got was a glass of tea which cost $5. We thought at least the tea would be good, but no. It's was just regular. Finally we gave up. We asked for the crepe cakes to go and cancelled the mango shaved ice. Total bill was $36. 2 cakes and a glass of tea. No one even said sorry about the wait or messing up the order. No comps or anything for the inconvenience. It was a huge waste of our time.\n\nWe got home and tasted the crepe cakes - both were terrible. I can't even describe it. It was bland, no real consistency, the thai tea sauce was ok, but not that tasty. The coconut crepe cake was also bland and gross. What an utter disappointment!  We went to Paris Baguette to get our cake fix instead. Then headed to k-town couple days later for the REAL bingsoo. k-town bingsoo seriously cannot be beat.

The drinks were REALLY expensive, I think the cheapest thing was regular tea (tea bag) for $5.50....u can get a large boba from boba guys for that price!  My friend and I over-ordered and waitress didn't tell us.  We ordered the coconut pandan cake, the mango snow ice, and the Thai tea toast.  The coconut pandan cake is pre-made and was decent, but nothing special and I wouldn't order again.  The mango snow ice was huge, but not amazing in terms of flavor.  The Thai tea toast was wonderful, but they put the Thai tea ice cream inside the toast so it was already pretty melted when it arrived and within 5 mins the sauce was soggy mess.  But it was really good. The table next to us ordered before we even sat down and the servers brought our food first and they were pissed and freaking out bc they ordered some of the same things...and angrily stared at us while we ate.  Server forgot to put their order in, so a little disorganized and you have to flag staff down to order.  I'd go back for the Thai tea toast in a couple of months to give them time to improve service and flow.", "author": "Kevin M."}
