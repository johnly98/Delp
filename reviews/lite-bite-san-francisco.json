I like how they have nutritional information for their dishes. I also like how they have compostable plates and utensils. However, the execution is really seriously lacking. \n\nI stopped by for dinner, and I got spinach lasagna with a side of broccoli. The broccoli was almost inedible. They had gone way, way overboard with the lemon zest, and the whole preparation made the broccoli extremely bitter. As for the lasagna, you would be better off buying a frozen lasagna and reheating that yourself- this was cold in the middle, the cheese had solidified, and it just did not taste good. \n\nTo be fair, it seems like this is more of a lunch spot, so maybe the food is fresher if you come during lunch hours. And, I got a smaller meal for about $8 which isn't too bad in San Francisco. Still, I will not be returning, and if I do, I definitely won't be having the broccoli.", "author": "Ayushi A."}

Every time I've been there, I always got nothing but good service from them, and I feel like they deserve the exposure. They definitely have a very respectable mission, as they provide nothing but low-calorie, low-sodium healthy meals. \n\nNow, I wouldn't exactly say I'm an advcate for healthy meals. I do try my best to be healthy (working out, cutting out sugar drinks, etc.) but usually you would not see me in a place like this for lunch. Ever since I got my current job next door, things changed for the better. I find that there are days that I don't have time to have a proper lunch or bring my own, so Lite Bite has become my go-to. Not only can you you have a filling meal, but they offer so many options (lasaunga, chicken, eggplant, broccoli, rice, salad, pasta) that all have been prepared organically. It's basically like grabbing a fast food meal, except it's incredibly good for you. I ordered the pesto pasta with grilled veggies (see the pictures) and it was very delcious. While I can't exactly say it's the best pasta I've ever had, what I can say is that you always know you're getting top notch ingrediants here and supporting a local business.\n\nBesides the wide array of healthy to-go meals they have, service here is top notch. Every person working behind the counter has always been incredibly kind to me. They always make sure to be attentive and never are short of suggestions when you aren't too sure what you want. \n\nThe big negative is the pricepoint. You can expect to spend about $15 bucks at least. While they do have options for less than that, like salads for $10 or ordering in smaller amounts, it's no doubt a place where you pay premium for high quality ingrediants. I've said this in the past and I'll say it again. If you want the best, you have to pay like it's the best.\n\nFinal verdict: Lite Bite is a unique version of what you would typically think is a grocery store or a deli. It's a place that acts like a fast food joint, yet the only thing that truly resembles a fast food joint is just how fast you get the food. It's truly one of the best healthy options in the Marina if not the city.", "author": "Alex B."}

I count my macros-- making eating out a little more difficult, but they go ahead and do it for you! Simple input. The food is full of flavor, usually a surprise for \"healthy food.\" I like that they don't make healthy food boring, because it shouldn't be. \n\nHowever, they only received 2 stars because of customer service. The girls measuring out the food are amazing-- but the owner/cashier (slightly older male) has the worst \"bedside manner\" ever. He was extremely patronizing when I offered to pay before my food was ready (I forgot they ran the price by the weight). Okay, my fault-- I took that sassy response. Then he told me, \"to go and wait while he served paying customers.\" Still a paying customer-- but okay. His tone was really starting to get me at this point. Then as I stood to the side and used a pen to write down some of the nutrient information (to come back and get it), he told me to let the PAYING CUSTOMER use \"my pen,\" and then self corrected, \"well it's mine, so yeah-- we need it.\" \n\nI was over it at this point.

Two Fridays ago, I fell in the bathroom at John Colins and badly sprained my ankle.

Everything on the menu has the calorie listed per a serving size including the Weight Watcher point value. Chicken Enchilada, Turkey Meatloaf, Atlantic Salmon, Prosciutto, Bleu Cheese & Fig Sandwich, and etc., take your pick, everything is under 350 calories except two salads.\n\nThe Whole Wheat Lasagna (350 Calories-$6.25) w/ Ground Turkey, Low Fat Ricotta & Low Fat Mozzarella was deliciously filling. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3hInKoS_u0FPJMIpbITsHw?select=MwJFaYUNJyy9SIhTlQ2k9Q The noodles were al-dente, the ground turkey tender, and the chunky tomato sauce was vibrantly tangy with a touch of herbaceousness from the basil. The duo of low fat cheeses gave it a creamy richness reminiscent of the high caloric original.\n\nIf you're looking for a lighter meal, the Chicken Enchilada (230 Calories-$4.75) is a great option. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3hInKoS_u0FPJMIpbITsHw?select=dX6lyy1ny9fQn8I4x0TT9w Lower in carbs but packed with protein from the bountiful tender shreds of seasoned chicken, the enchilada gets a nice kick from the accompanying red chili sauce.\n\nI know I'm very clumsy but this time, it was ALL Mr. Jack Daniels' fault.

The food is extremely healthy, made from the freshest ingredients and actually delicious. Notice how I didn't say it's delicious for a healthy restaurant. That's what I love about Lite Bite the most - the food is tasty in comparison to other lunch spots, both the healthy and the unhealthy ones. \n\nMy personal favorites are the Asian Tofu Salad, the Rainbow Quinoa and the cauliflower garbanzo beans. They are oozing with flavor, very healthy and completely fresh.

And they don't sacrifice too much flavor while they are doing it. \n\nAfter a gym session, I tried the sesame chicken breast with a side of mashed cauliflower and grilled broccoli. My boyfriend went with the chicken salad and the filet kebab. My whole meal was around 350 calories, and I was so full after eating it. I was glad to try mashed cauliflower. I've been hearing it's almost as good as mashed potatoes, but a lot healthier. It tasted really creamy but it wasn't too filling. It was so delicious that I'm actually thinking about making these for thanksgiving sides instead of the potatoes! The broccoli was also really good, and the chicken salad tasted fresh without the mayo drench.\n\nThe only gripe I have about this place is that the food is reheated, not made fresh. Therefore, when they heat it up, the meat might not get warmed up enough. However, it's something I'm willing to overlook since good healthy food is so real to come by when eating out.

Rich and cheesy, with lots of tomato flavor and turkey. It did not taste remotely low in calories. And so I have to say that I'm very dubious about their calorie claims. I just don't see how it's possible that the large serving I just ate was under 400 calories. I microwaved it at home and there was plenty of fat visible in the yummy goo, and the container has plenty of grease stains. \nSo... If healthy ingredients and taste are your priorities, by all means get their lasagna. But if you're a serious calorie counter, I'd suggest you be very wary of their numbers.

Everything is delicious and low calorie and high in nutritional value. There's a case of different foods you choose from and they charge by weight so you can customize your plate.

They also have a side case with their foods pre-packaged so you can take them home. My only critique is that it gets kind of long when they weigh each item separately, they should do more of a standardized portion method like Lemonade in LA. I've never been here when it was very busy but if it were, then this would be a definite time bottleneck. \n\nThe ambiance is lovely.

First off the food they make is really good and healthy, which is awesome.  But it takes incredibly long to get your food and there are some really annoying quirks about how this place is run.  A few quick tweaks and the customer experience would be a million times better.\n\nridiculous issue #1 - weighing and pricing every piece of food on your plate separately.  All the prices are within two dollars, why not just make it all the same price and just weigh each plate at the end?  The way they do it now takes soooooo long it is absurd.  If there is anyone in the store I won't go in because I know it will take forever.\n\n#2 - they have one microwave.  please go to costco and get one more microwave.  Same deal as with #1, if there is anyone else in line then everything just takes so much longer because there is a line to reheat your plate.  This one is ridiculously easy.\n\n#3 - why do they hide the forks and knives? No one is going to start hoarding these things if you put them next to the napkins on the counter so you don't have to grab someone behind the counter and ask them to get you utensils.  I get that they don't want to create extra waste, but who's going to take more then one fork? \n\nAgain, the food is really tasty and healthy (and they put the nutritional info on the labels which is nice).

The concept: upscale-ish healthy but delicious food presented in sort of a deli-like selection. AKA you can select a protein (salmon, chicken, beef skewers, turkey meatballs, and more) and then various salads (roasted yams, cauliflower & chickpeas, polenta & chicken salad, more and more) and get it all on a plate that is weighed. I had all of the above salads with salmon (came with a delectable dollop of pea puree on top) and fully enjoyed it. It's the perfect place to pop in, get a quick healthy and delicious lunch. I also had a cookie, not sure what it was, but it was delish as well. \n\nOnly reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's no unique culinary masterpiece of a place -- just straight up good healthy food.

Having arrived a few minutes early for my wax appointment at Bare, I decided to pick up a quick lunch at Lite Bite.\n\nIt's sort of like sensory (at least visual) overload, because it's sort of like the deli section of a grocery store.  Salmon, turkey meatloaf, various sides, etc.  There's also a refrigerated section for pre-packaged salads, sandwiches (I saw these mini bagel sandwiches with salmon), and drinks.\n\nNot wanting to take up too much time to just select food, I opted for some quinoa with corn and jalapenos, and their herb-roasted potatoes, and from the fridge I grabbed an aloe drink.  It came out to be a sub-$10 meal; you pay per oz. so you can get as much or as little of something as you want (the different items are differently priced, so it's not like Lee's Deli or anything where everything goes into one tray).\n\nThe amount of food I had was a perfect light lunch; I wasn't too big a fan of the herb-roasted potatoes cold, but I loved the quinoa.  The corn and jalapenos gave it a nice texture and flavor, and it's something I'll definitely be ordering again.  After seeing all the reviews for the turkey meatloaf, it's next on my to-try list.

Both were flavorful but for a 1/2 pint of each it cost me $10.

The niche here is they make it a point to provide detailed nutritional information on every item. They concentrate on sourcing quality ingredients to derive the great flavors. Fresh herbs, spices, and healthy oils are used to season and cook as to not add on extra calories. What does that get you? Here's an example of a favorite meal of mine...\n\n6oz. Salmon - 271 cal - Atlantic Salmon with simply kosher salt and black pepper. Tasty as is (as it should be), but great the included pea puree.\n\n5oz. Quinoa w/ Corn & Jalapeno - 180 cal - Tasty quinoa kicked up with jalapeno balanced with the sweetness of corn.\n\n4oz. Broccoli Rabe - 50 cal - Broccoli rabe sauteed in e.v.o.o., garlic, red pepper flakes, and lemon zest.\n\nTotal count: 501 cal for 15oz. of tasty food. \n\nSo I'm not that much of a calorie counter even though it seems like it in this post. But that's just the deal with Lite Bite. They do it for you. They're pretty meticulous about it. I saw an employee measure out salt on a digital food scale to add in prepping the roasted carrots (and removed pinch). The only minus is that the food is served chilled, but they can warm it up for you. As for me, always eat the food as is chilled and it's delicious.\n\nAnd again, I must say 501 calories for nearly a pound of tasty, healthy, fresh food. Can you beat that?!?", "author": "Al L."}

The grilled vegetables are amazing and include options, portobello mushrooms are my favorite, they also have eggplant, zucchini, onions, etc.  You can choose how much of everything you want, and you can take it to go our eat it there.\n\nThere is also a pre-made food section if you're in a hurry, these sandwiches and salads are also wonderful, and also list all ingredients and caloric information.\n\nThe lasagna features whole wheat pasta and low-fat mozzarella, the chicken enchiladas have organic chicken, low fat cheese, etc.  Everything is to die for!!  This is how I cook these at home, and to have someone else doing the work for you, but without the guilt that you usually experience when eating out (full-fat cheeses, white breads and pastas, heavy cream and butter)  -- winning combination!!!\n\nThis place is such a gem, it is the most reasonably-priced restaurant in the area, and by far the healthiest and most informative!", "author": "Katie A."}

I have come away both very pleased, and very disappointed.  Pleased with absolutely everything about my experience, and disappointed in myself for having walked by so many times without going in :(\n\nFirst off, the food.  I ordered the grilled moroccan chicken and the green beans with shallots and red pepper flakes.  While boxing up my chicken, the very nice gentleman behind the counter also threw in a piece of yam, telling me that it was an excellent accompaniment to the chicken. Now, I have never been a fan of yam, so I didn't really have high hopes for that one.  Let me say though, Nice Man Behind the Counter, you have made a believer out of me!  The chicken was perfectly seasoned with a bit of a kick that was perfectly matched with the sweetness of the yam.  Both the chicken and the yam were well cooked as well, the chicken still being moist and tender and the yam soft without being too mushy.  The green beans were amazing as well!  I love the spiciness of the red pepper flakes with the clean crunch of the green beans (which were also cooked to perfection!)\n\nThe service was also a solid 5 at Lite Bite.  The gentleman helping me was very friendly and knowledgeable about the different foods both what went well together (the yam!!) and how they were each prepared.  Also, even when it got busy behind me, I didn't feel like he got frantic or rushed, but was still very pleasant to myself and the people waiting.\n\nNow, there are a lot of places in the city that have both great food and excellent service, but to eat at a lot of those places you'd be looking at weeks of top ramen afterwards just to be able to continue paying your rent.  Not Lite Bite though!  For my healthy and low-cal plate of filling deliciousness, I was set back a mere $4.  Four Dollars!!  I don't even think I could cook it for that cheap....\n\ntl;dr Food is tasty, healthy, and filling, service is excellent, and your wallet will love you.", "author": "Nicole N."}

My biggest complaint is that they are quite pricey for what it is.  I like the focus on healthy foods, and I'm certainly impressed by their attempt to educate the consumer on the benefits of things like brown rice.  The things I've had have all been fairly good, considering they were sitting out for a while and then microwaved.

It is the perfect addition to the already wonderful array of restaurants here in Cow Hollow.  I go there several times a week and love the food.  In general, their dishes are super tasty and relatively affordable.  They have some very nice pre-prepared salads that they will even toss for you on the spot--a very nice touch.\n\nHere's the downside. The manager is extremely friendly to his customers.  He smiles and treats you well, and then he'll turn to his staff and treat them rudely right in front of you.   I honestly hope he reads this, as it is bad enough that I feel a little guilty even patronizing the place. Dude, we see how you treat you employees.  Clean up your act.  It doesn't really take that much to add a courtesy word (\"Please\" toss this gentleman's salad) or to make a command polite with a request (\"Would you\" mind tossing this gentleman's salad?)  He needs to learn that the how he treats is staff in public is at least as  important as how he treats his customers.  If they can fix this, Lite Bite will be awesome--and I bet you'll be able to take the Help Wanted sign down from the window.\n\nI really hope they succeed.", "author": "Dave B."}

Being able to get a decent sized hunk of lasagna that also has a decent price is also a huge plus for me. However, I have to take a few stars away for presentation and execution. Mostly, the microwaves. Why oh why do you use microwaves!? Am I wrong to think that some of your items could be better heated in a turbo chef, while some could be kept in a chafing dish or something of the sort. Not only is it just weird for me to see someone microwaving my food, everything I have gotten has been unevenly heated. Piping hot in one section and cold in others. Another small gripe would be the amount of nutmeg I always seem to taste in their white lasagne.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-06", "description": "If you're looking for a quick, healthy meal on Union Street, this is your place! Lite Bite offers nutritional information on all of their menu items, but it's all healthy and tastes homemade. You can select from pre-packaged fresh meals if you're really in a hurry, or you can order at the counter, sort of like how you would if you were at a deli. I believe it is owned and managed by a couple - he manages the business and works at the counter, while she is the chef and prepares all of the meals. Everything is always very clean, and we've never had a problem getting a seat.", "author": "J K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-10-27", "description": "I stopped in Lite Bite for the first time this week, and quickly realized that it fills a much needed void in Cow Hollow.  The model is simple - they bake, and prepare fresh salads/ simple dishes onsite, and also run a grill five blocks away - providing freshly made dishes ready to go.  Think of it as the \"to go\" area at Whole Foods, but even fresher .... and with seating.  It's a great place to stop in for a quick bite, OR grab a healthy $8-$10 meal to go.  I love grilled chicken, meatloaf, mash potatoes, green beans, bbq pork chops, tossed salads, etc, but I simply don't have time to shop,prep, and cook these dishes.  Lite Bite is dialed in for the niche it serves. The owner is very service-centric, and knowledgeable.  I highly recommend. I'm actually going in today for my 3rd meal there this week!", "author": "Ryan D."}

Quinoa was light and fresh tasting with a tiny and very welcome 'kick' from jalapenos.  Cauliflower mash was also very tasty and fresh tasting.  Bought some of the kale to go and enjoyed it heated up at home - garlicky, with just enough oil to moisten it.  The eggplant parmigiana looked wonderful and I plan to go back to try it.  Looking forward to seeing the new items they will add to the menu once they are fully up and running.", "author": "Ash A."}

The idea behind this place is great - quality ingredients, transparency with ingredients and nutrition, served in relatively quick time.\n\nHowever, their marketing is SO NEGATIVE. They have posters in their windows touting \"eat guilt free!\" and \"50% off calories!\" which is the dirtiest type of marketing. Why are they suggesting someone should feel guilt when they eat in the first place? Or encouraging obsessive calorie counting? Seems to me that they are trying to prey on people's eating/weight insecurities to get you in the door... which tells me they aren't confident in their product. If they were, their signs would say  \"all quality ingredients!\" and \"complete transparency - we do the thinking for you by making this super healthy, super nutritious, and super fast!\" which I'm sure is their intention - it just needs to be executed a little differently. \n\nI know so many women who \"secretly\" obsess about the food they eat on a daily basis - whether they are overweight, normal weight, or underweight - and if they eat something they actually enjoy that might be outside of their strict diets they feel immense guilt and beat themselves up for it. While lite bite certainly isn't responsible for that, nor can they control it, if they can play a role in decreasing it and promoting positive self-image, wouldn't they want to? Let's do people a favor and not market to them by feeding in to the negativity then offering a \"guilt-free\" solution to their \"problem\". Rather, let's try a positive message and suggest that more important than calorie counting or the endless emotions you feel toward food, is eating high quality food and knowing exactly what's going in to it and that it's healthy for you. Lite bite is taking the first step in a positive direction by offering high quality variety with transparent ingredients and nutrition in a short amount of time - now if they could just let go of their shameful marketing ploys it might actually be an idea that's revolutionary. \n\nSide note - one person commented on how poorly the guy treats his staff and when I was speaking with him and another member of the staff, she tried to pipe in and he told her not to speak... she literally couldn't add a single word to the convo. It was rude to say the least and gives me the impression this is something he still needs to work on. \n\n*Lite bite! Give me a reason to change this review into 5 stars and return as a customer by stepping up your positive marketing - I am more than happy to as you've got a great concept. One small change and you'll be the best spot on Union St. *", "author": "Quinn N."}

The people here are very nice and helpful. I think the owner Angelo is there most of the time and he is great at recommending different things to try that you will like - and offering samples.  I just wish they would offer some more options like Boulange down the street - maybe more variety of sandwiches?  Maybe some bread?   I like healthy food - but I think they need to include some heartier options, too.", "author": "Emma L."}

Excellent take-out spot!  I try to eat healthy so this place was right up my alley...and reasonably priced!  I got the salmon with pea puree which was delicious!  The salmon was fresh and tender- perfectly cooked with the addition of the pea puree on top!  My boyfriend got the whole wheat lasagna and said it was amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-10-24", "description": "I like this little deli/restaurant in Cow Hollow  very much.    I have been going there regularly for the last 6 months.  It  has helped me to lose 9 pounds over the summer  (and keep it off).   How can you beat that?\n   The food is healthy but also delicious.  The selections are varied and interesting with a mix of cuisines--Italian and Mediterranean included.     I love the fact that you know exactly how many calories each item has because each one is labeled.   If you are counting calories there is no guesswork  and no worry. \n     I usually get the turkey meatballs with sauce and the wonderful polenta.  Also sometimes  their salads  or  roasted beets.   They used to have good mini sandwiches  (ex  prosciutto/fig jam/low /fat blue cheese on  a small ciabbata roll).  But the sandwiches weren't selling so they were discontinued.  Too bad.  They were a perfect bite when on the go.. or just a perfect little snack anytime.  \n   We need more eateries like Lite Bite which label the calorie content of their menu.    I wish they were located in various parts of the city.  Lite Bite proves that you can eat healthy  but still have very tasty and interesting meals.", "author": "Patricia D."}

The owners are really nice and genuinely seem to care about your opinions. The chicken cesar salad is good, but the low calorie count makes it even better. All of the breakfast sandwiches are tasty even the smoked salmon bagel (I'm usually very particular about my smoked salmon, but Lite Bite's is not too smoky or fishy.) The salmon bagel has a slice of apple in it with a cream cheese spread. If you're looking for a healthy, refreshing meal, (not to mention guilt-free) this is the place to go.
