I can't wait to go back again soon. It's difficult to make a reservation to, but totally worth it to book 6 weeks in advance and worth the $. \n\nFirst off, the food was high quality, beautifully made and tasted amazing. The progression of the sushi was also perfectly compiled only making me want more bite after bite. If you prefer traditional edomae sushi, this is one step towards the more westernized/fusion influenced type of sushi restaurant. But not as far as Robin. I personally prefer this type of sushi that is not fully traditional edomae but still doesn't cover the quality and natural taste of the fish with other overpowering sauces & ingredients.\n\nSecondly, service was impeccable. Very attentive. Each chef only serves 4 people so you're not waiting too long and can still chat with the chef. We had chef Jason and he is super knowledgable and easygoing. Highly recommend requesting for him when making a reservation. :) \n\nLastly, the atmosphere is bright, simple, and comfortable. You won't feel crowded or too far from the chef. I like the decor and all the pottery that they display and use for teacups/plates. \n\nThinking about it just makes me want to go back now. Highly recommend!", "author": "Rohenne L."}

Light wood brightens and opens up the rather small space, which only seats 12 per session.\n\nThere are 3 chefs who tend to 4 patrons each. So you really get a personalized, interactive experience with the chefs. They tell you the type of fish, where it's from, how it's been prepared, and what you can expect from each perfect bite. They truly care about and take pride in their craft and want you to experience sushi in the highest form. \n\nAll of the fish are extremely fresh, so you can taste all of the nuances of each piece. Each piece is prepared right in front of you and preparation varies by the fish's natural flavor and texture.

This is probably the best sushi I've ever had (especially when it comes to omakase) and my mouth waters just from typing this review. My neighbor told me about j\u016b-ni, and it happened to be on Nina Y.'s list of bookmarks too, so we made reservations.\n\nBecause our reservation was so late in the evening, we had a few drinks nearby beforehand. This supplemented our 2 bottles of sake when we arrived at j\u016b-ni. Our chef was Patrick, and I can't remember the name of our waiter, but they were both so sweet and hospitable. Phenomenal customer service experience.\n\nYou can see my Yelp photos for a full list of what we ate, but everything was delicious. The chef tells a story about each of the omakase items, and we were drawn into a 2 hour culinary adventure that I would love to repeat again. We did a few add-on items to our omakase, and it was worth it, but we were so full by the end.\n\nDefinitely a pricey treat, but it's a great restaurant for an anniversary or birthday celebration. Parties of 1 or 2 are preferred since everyone is sitting around the chefs in the middle of the room. Just make sure to reserve spots months in advance. j\u016b-ni isn't for the spontaneous!

Each nigiri is made to perfection and they just melted into my mouth. I never had so many combinations of flavors from one nigiri and it was pretty mind blowing. I had to chew slowly to savor each bite and experience each individual oralgasm. There wasn't one piece that I didn't thoroughly enjoyed. \n\nThe pacing of the meal was consistent throughout the whole meal. By the time I had finished a nigiri, the chef was already finishing up the next. Each chef has four seating so everyone gets a front row seat to witness the blessing in the making. Our chef Jeff, was very detailed. From making sure each nigiri was consistent for each individual, to making sure our plates were wiped dry for the presentation. Even the other staff were attentive in making sure our glass was refilled and any droppings on the tables were wiped clean.  \n\nThe base price of the omakase is $155 and at the end they provide an a la carte menu. I got the extended omakase for an additional $35 which included the uni and tuna handroll. My only complaint was the tuna was a bit cold. My teeth are generally sensitive when it comes to cold food so I had endure a bit of discomfort, but it was worth it. Overall, I will definitely come here again!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-18", "description": "I absolutely adore Ju-Ni! The fish quality was out of this world and perfectly seasoned. Many of the dishes had a semi modern twist which really highlighted the fish rather than over power the fish. In other words, it did not feel like it was so dependent on marinades or gimmicks (truffle everything) for flavor but sought to merely complement the natural flavor of the superbly fresh fish. In fact everything from the texture to the flavor profile was so well balanced, I was dreaming about it for days after.\n\nI have been to quite a few omakase restaurants and would put this more along the lines of the best of the best (to me that is wako and ijji.) Ju-Ni was initially known to be one of the more affordable omakase places but its prices have recently increased. I will have to say that you do not get a lot of food for what you pay for... even know every bite was a little bit of heaven.

And since all 12 seats are counter seats, you can impress your date or your family and friends with an intimate, sushi counter experience. \n\nHowever, my problem was how about half of the pieces were torched. I'd be fine with a few aburi style, but when every single piece was drenched in soy sauce/lemon zest or torched, I just couldn't enjoy the fish.

Also, I was not full by the end of the meal (which rarely ever happens to me at omakase restaurants). \n\nI'm new to the Bay Area and it seems like many people (at least on Yelp) think ju-ni is the best sushi in the area.

It's hard to get the right balance of lemon acidity so that the O-toro doesn't have a strange taste while being charred, but this place definitely aced it! \n\nAll the fishes were super fatty(guess it is the right season of fishes for me) and just really delicious.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-28", "description": "I'm in desperate need of a sushi fund. A fund that is specifically used for dining experiences like this. I'm talking Omakase, the whole shabang, the placing buttery, succulent and shiny fish in front of me, THAT kind of experience. I just had j\u016b-ni last night and I could hardly wait to share my experience! Can Jason, the sushi chef, adopt me? I'll clean dishes if that meant I could dine here everyday. I don't think I can ever get tired of this.\n\nI haven't had many omakase experiences, maybe one or two. My favorite spot was a small little place in Alameda called Yume that recently closed for good. The style there was more traditional omakase, meaning mostly fish and very little toppings. It wasn't as fancy as j\u016b-ni was, although Yume's style really allowed the fish to shine on its own. Since coming back from Japan, I was looking forward to the next omakase dining experience and the opportunity to eat delicious fish once again. My friend is known in our group for trying new omakase restaurants every month, so I asked her to bring me to one of her favorite spots. She recommended j\u016b-ni and said that it was the best omakase in the city and she was right, I was not disappointed at all. The experience was impeccable, the servers were friendly and the atmosphere was perfect. It's great to be able to witness the chef prepare each slice of fish, slicing it gently, and adding the toppings ever so delicately, it's really a craft. My friends and I were excited to see Jason, our chef, work and because we were so hungry, it made it more difficult to watch him prepare slices of fish, only to put it away for later. \n\nj\u016b-ni is not known for their traditional style of preparing omakase. If anything, this place is one step further away from traditional omakase. They have garnishes and sauces that are added to complement the fish.  Everything I had was delicious, there wasn't any piece of fish where I was like, \"Hmm, I didn't like that.\" Everything was absolutely delicious. Of course all the great things are served at the end of your meal because they're usually more flavorful or fatty, like Uni or Toro. Each piece was better than the one before. Now, let's talk about the best pieces of the night, shall we?\n\nHotate - Hokkaido Scallop, it's sweet and buttery. Hokkaido probably has the best scallops anyways.\n\nHotaru Ika - Baby Firefly Squid, this was the most interesting piece of the night because I've never had anything like it. Squid or Ika usually is white and shiny, quite rubbery, you would never expect it to be this succulent.\n\nHirame - Olive Flounder, I love this fish. The entire bite was perfection and so soft, I really wanted to eat more. \n\nIkura with Ankimo - Salmon Roe with Monkfish Pate. I've never seen it prepared this way. Ikura is one of my favorite things because it's naturally salty so no extra seasoning is required. The way they froze the ankimo and shaved it on top was impeccable. I was expecting it to be crunchy like panko crumbs, but instead, if was fluffy and airy, and so, so creamy. \n\nChu Toro - Medium Fatty Tuna, how can you not enjoy this piece? It's melt in your mouth delicioussssssness. \n\nZuke Toro with Caviar - Soy Cured Toro, probably the best piece of the night. The caviar wasn't overpowering and complemented the buttery torched fish very well. \n\nShirayaki - Fresh Unagi with Gold Flakes, fancy fancy and super flavorful. The unagi was crispy and smothered in sweet unagi sauce. And guuuurl, Jason painted that gold on y'all!! PAINTED. \n\nExtended omakase for $32\nHokkaido Uni, Sea Urchin. I'm telling you, Hokkaido knows what they're doing. Their scallops, their sea urchin, they can GIT IT. If you're not fond of Sea Urchin, it's because you haven't been eating it at the right place. This will surely make you fall in loveeee. All you need is loooove. \n\nTuna Handroll with Pickled Takuan - I love that the chef doesn't chop up the tuna even more, which usually makes it very mushy. It's cut into small cubes initially and he adds the pickled radish and sauce, then carefully folds it repeatedly until everything is mixed in. It's then rolled into a beautiful hand roll. Do not attempt to eat this one in one bite!\n\nReservations are made online at Resy and they provide reminders prior to your meal. They hold your reservation for 15 minutes after, but do try and come on time. There are a total of 12 seats in the house and 3 sushi chefs. Showing up early means you get to chat with the chef and he explains to your group of 4 where the fish comes from. Also, don't be afraid to eat with your hands. Nigiri is prepared as finger food and you should always eat it in one full bite. Flip the nigiri over so the fish touches your tongue first if you can!\n\nj\u016b-ni has a Michelin star and it is well deserved. The price is around $155, without the extended omakase, tax or tip. Come prepared to pay the hefty price, but I think if you're looking for an incredible dining experience, then the price is worth! Can't wait to come back!", "author": "Nancy L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-09", "description": "So Ju-ni has been high on my list for \"must try\" in SF for a while now and it had actually been on my constant reservation search list for a few weeks. Was able to book a few months in advance and patiently waited to make my appearance at this new Michelin star awarded restaurant. I have had the opportunity to eat at Kusakabe and Kenzo in the bay area so this would be my third joint and I was walking in with high hopes. The joint itself houses 12 seats which is why the name of the joint is the way it is. I will lay out the warning that this place is REALLY pricey. It is very much in line with Kenzo and it seems to be the trend in SF lately for sushi meals to cost north of $150 per person which personally seems a bit high. Kusakabe is priced a bit more reasonably I think with options to range you under $300 but at Ju-ni or Kenzo it is essentially a requirement to be north of $350 especially if you have any adult beverages. With this said, I will say that this restaurant kills the essentials and is beautiful presentation and delivery of high quality fresh fish. I will say this is probably the best sushi joint in the bay area without a doubt and I loved how it was purely focused on nigiri (perfect for nigiri lovers) rather than doing some mixed dishes like Kenzo or Kusakabe.\n\nLet me focus back on the experience. The restaurant itself has minimal interior d\u00e9cor but it is beautifully done with elegant color schemes and table spots in front of each sushi chef. Each sushi chef has 4 seats in front of you and there are 3 sushi chefs. They have some good sake options again ranging to pretty pricey but I figured yolo at this point and went all in for the experience. The menu itself is straightforward where you get an omakase for $155 per person and then they had the option to add in a two extra nigiri for an extra surcharge of roughly $35. This joint's recipe for success is that they have 90% of their fish come from the famous Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo and the quality is on point. They started the omakase with a cauliflower salad dish that was made perfectly and really unique flavor combinations. After this opening, it was all nigiri and like I said earlier, these guys just crush it. The fish proportion is fantastic to rice, the rice made really well and tasting great with the fresh fish, and great pace to their serving. Each nigiri was made perfectly with an awesome use of garnishes on top such as salt or foie shavings, etc. The start of the show for me was honestly the ikura with monkfish liver shavings on top which was just phenomenal. These chefs clearly know what they are doing and every nigiri piece seemed like a perfect piece made in synched execution. The fishes which required light searing such as the unagi was still perfect and with added touches of gold shavings. The uni was on point and absolutely delicious (although I might give a slight edge to kusakabe's packed Uni). \n\nAll in all, this is THE spot for nigiri if you are a nigiri lover. This place just purely focuses on the nigiri execution and they do it so well. If you can afford the price point, this is definitely the spot to check out but hopefully they lower prices in the future  I know I know.. me just dreaming. Like I said, a great spot that is worth checking out and certainly deserves its michelin star in the SF foodie scene", "author": "Dan M."}

I made reservations through their website about 1.5 months in advance! They're often booked on the weekends, so plan accordingly! We found street parking pretty easily and this restaurant was a little difficult to find because there was no sign on the outside; just look for #101 above the door. \n\nWe ordered the omakase ($125) and added the extended omakase ($46) at the end. This restaurant stands out because of the freshness and uniquess of their food. They don't have typical nigiris here- if you like to try a large variety, this is perfect for you. They also prepare it in ways that are different than other restaurants - like the nigiri with the shaved monkfish liver. It was pretty messy to eat and not exactly my favorite, but it's definitely an experience to try everything here!\n\nThey are super professional here, to the point where I felt a little awkward at times. They always have someone watching in the back incase you need something, and I felt like they were just watching me eat... They will also change your plate if you get something on it, every single time. Even a one little grain of rice. It's nice, but not really necessary to me. \n\nI thorougly enjoyed this experience, but for the price, I thought I would enjoy the food more. There are many omakase restaurants in San Francisco, and in my opinion, this was good, but not the best. For example, their A5 wagyu was not as buttery and soft as I've had it at other places. I recommend this restaurant if you want a large variety of nigiris - not just the classic ones, but the ones you've never tried before!", "author": "Letty H."}

My complaint are more of the overall experience specifically the bill. The restaurant sent me a text DAY OF to order the extended menu for an additional $25 for 3 extra pieces. My sis and I decided to go for it, only to be given 2 additional pieces. The owner said the text \"was old.\" OK but why not honor it?   Second the bill came, and we were overcharged $8 more than the quoted $25 price. We were even charged more, than if we would have ordered the 2 pieces separate! A straight overcharge! It was weird. We had to tell the waitress, which she adjusted.  Overall the bill was almost $500 because we had drinks so it seems irresponsible on the restaurants part to not have current pricing and attempt to overcharge, even if it was $8. If you are paying a minimum of $150 per person I expect it all!\n\nAlso at one point the owner corrected our cooks position of the fish as he was cutting it.

A bunch of the fishes were flown in the morning of from Japan or Australia. I was impressed with the garnishes of quite a few of the dishes. Things you wouldn't think of to add to  raw fish such as lime or large pieces of salt. Then there were the pieces which were served with gold flecks. WAGYU IS A MUST. You can order a la cart at the end of your meal or have it be part of your extended menu. It was ridiculously delicious and melted like pure butter. So worth (think it costs ~$17). I kinda wish that they were a bit more \"purist\" when it came to serving the o-toro instead of searing it a little. I also applaud the attention to detail and the evident amount of thought put into carefully crafting the menu. \n\nThree chefs serve 12 people per seating. They're all young but don't let that deceive you. Their skill and technique is pro.

This is seriously my favorite sushi place in SF - and my boyfriend agrees. I will say that this probably isn't what you would call a super traditional omakase place...meaning that the rice and dishes have a bit of a modern take to this. SO if you're looking for a traditional, no frills omakase place - this probably isn't it. BUT I can't recommend this place enough. \n\nThe fish was amazingly fresh and the ratio of fish to rice was perfect. Now, let's talk about that rice. As you'll read from other reviews - it's different but it was superb. The rice isn't actually brown rice, but you'll notice the color is brown. This is because of what they mix the sushi rice with - I believe a soy sauce/vinegar/brown sugar mix. And it is delicious. Again, this isn't traditional but that doesn't mean it isn't fantastic.\n\nThey do have the option for an extended omakase as well as certain dishes offered a la carte. One thing to note here is that not every fish is available a la carte unlike other omakase places/experiences. So keep that in mind!\n\nIt's a small restaurant, quiet and intimate.

I also ordered an extra uni and wagyu piece at the end; however, I wished I had also added on the handroll too. The 18 courses do fill you up pretty well. What I really liked about this Omakase compared to others that I've had is definitely the simplicity behind each piece of nigiri, but the skill behind letting the flavors of the fish resonate without too much wasabi or soy sauce overkill. The technique definitely highlights the skills of the sushi chefs here. Honestly, if they sold tubs of the genmaicha ice cream they give you at the end, my fridge would be full and I would be unable to pay rent.\n\n[Sake] \nJu-ni has an extensive sake menu.

Certainly wouldn't have doubts that the place is hygenic and the fish is well preserved.  Grey-white walls with wood counters, this place only has 14 counter seats.  Was a nice touch to add some SF sports team caps as decor in one small area of the space.\n\nService: waitstaff are pretty attentive when it comes to drinks and clearing plates, most likely due to the limited number of customers in the restaurant at a time.  They fill waters quickly and I only had to wave down a waiter one time (they were giving me time to choose a drink and I guess I made my choice quicker than expected).  There are three sushi chefs- 2 of them handled 4 customers, one was working with 6.  They encourage you to ask questions about the sushi, explain each piece as they are serving, and ask that you eat your piece quickly (instead of waiting for others to get their piece).  They also encourage you to take photos.\n\nFood: I must say that I was very impressed with the sushi, and I've been to a lot of places in Japan and NYC that were pretty good!  I enjoyed how the nigiri were clean-tasting in general with few sauces and condiments and letting the fish shine.  One of few places where they encourage you to use your fingers to eat too (they give you a finger towel just for this)!  They only serve omakaze, so those who are picky with their sushi / want to choose their pieces might not enjoy the experience as much.  After the traditional omakaze, they do offer a few more pieces a la carte for an additional cost, though my date and I were pretty satisfied after 18 courses (a salad, 14 nigiri, consume, and dessert).  Surprisingly didn't feel too stuffed afterwards- thought I would have food coma after 18 courses but overall the meal was lighter than expected.  18 courses comes out to $145 per person and they give you a card with a short description of the nigiri eaten at the end of the meal.  We had the following during our meal:\n\n- Cucumber salad\n- Umi Masu (ocean trout)\n- Ikura with Ankimo (Salmon Roe / Monkfish Liver Pate) - most interesting one of the night with the frozen pate shaved over the Ikura\n- Buri (Japanese Wild Yellowtail)\n- Hotate (Hokkaido Scallop)\n- Chu Toro\n- Isaki (Line Grunt)\n- Sawara (King Spanish Mackerel)\n- Zuke Sake (white soy cured King Salmon)\n- Ishidai (Knife Jaw Fish) - one of my favorites\n- Kasugodai (Japanese Baby Snapper)\n- Kindai Tuna (sustainable Blue Fin Tuna)\n- Hirame (Olive Flounder) - another favorite\n- Tsuri Aji (Wild Horse Mackerel)\n- Zuke Toro with Caviar (soy cured Toro with Caviar)\n- Tamago\n- Fish bone and mushroom consume- hands down favorite for my date and me; very clean tasting yet with strong flavors\n- Genmaicha Ice Cream- surprisingly strong tea flavor but delicious!\n\nFor the price, my date and I were very happy with our meal- we both felt the quality matched the price.  It is a bit on the expensive side, but that's the price to pay for great sushi, I guess.  Put it this way- my dad is super picky and traditional when it comes to sushi and I'd be happy to bring him here.", "author": "Audrey H."}

It's been a while since I've tried an omakase set that really impressed me, but Ju-Ni definitely managed to do just that.\n\nAll the pieces used high-quality ingredients that provided their own unique, well-complemented flavor. A lot of the less traditional places tend to add items just for the \"fancy\" factor or as mostly pointless garnishes, but Ju-Ni really makes sure each ingredient contributes positively to the flavor and the texture.\n\nAnother plus is the vibe here. I find that a lot of omakase-style places tend to be a bit stifling, but Ju-Ni feels like a much more open environment where it's easier to make conversation with each other and the chef.\n\nFor the price point (relatively low for this level of quality in San Francisco, imo), it's hard to beat.", "author": "Jess L."}

We went to some notable ones in SF like Kusakabe, Omakase, Wako, Ijji but we like Ju-ni the best. The food/dining experience is really well-done, consistent taste, atmosphere of the restaurant is also modern clean and nice. Most of their fishes are flown straight from Japan. Also, chefs might share  more interesting story like how some fishes are caught by line only, no net, etc. This is modern style sushi omakase (vs edomae) meaning they will use different kinds of secret sauces to enhance the flavors!\n\nYou will get essential fishes like Tuna (different parts), Trout, Scallops, Horse Mackerel, to more unusual ones like Anago/Unagi depending on the season, and Shaved Ankimo (their signature). You can also Opt for the special supplements(after Omakase) like Uni, and melt-in-your-mouth Wagyu sushi, that will send you to sushi heaven momentarily... unless you can afford to order more and more...\n\nFood: 5/5 \nDrinks: there seems to be a good selection of wines and sakes but I'd rather drink hot tea and not mess around with the taste of fishes.\n---\nParking: Street parking no valet, so prepare to drive around looking for spots during busy nights.\n---\nNow, Reservation is absohorritably(absolutely horrible) tough, since this is one-starred michelin and seatings are not a lot, we just happen to get a cancelation notification from Resy, and you have to jump right that second at this very rare chance to have one of the most amazing sushi experience in your life!!", "author": "Reno V."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-07", "description": "This place is really delicious.  I have been to two of the one Michelin star omakase restaurants in the Bay Area (ju-ni being a recent recipient) - ju-ni and Omakase.  The two restaurants are a little different but both do a really great omakase.  I would have a hard time telling you which one to pick, but I can provide a brief comparison between the two: \n\nJu-ni currently offers a $118 omakase, which includes an appetizer, a 14 course nigiri, owan, and dessert.  This is different than their previous offering: a $90, 12 course nigiri.  Additional supplements are recommended to this meal on their menu, currently including a trio of nigiri favorites for $37 (zuke chu toro with caviar, shirayaki, and the santa barbara uni), as well as a toro handroll for $16.  Omakase offers a $200 omakase, which includes two appetizers, two sashimi, one yakimono, a 12 course nigiri, and one owan.  Beverages are not included in either of these prices.  \n\nPersonally, I enjoyed my experience at Omakase slightly more, and also felt fuller from the food there but both places are amazing.  Ju-ni ran us about $240 per person (including tax, tip, supplemental sushi and one glass of alcohol each), whereas Omakase ran us about $260 per person - so there is a price difference. I think I liked Omakase more because it felt more traditional, the sushi chefs were all older Japanese men on the night we went who were trained in Japan.  Also, we went for a birthday (a special occasion) and they made it very special for us.\n\nHowever, the difference between the food to me at both places is negligible - both places do a super delicious omakase and will ruin you for other sushi places forever.  Every piece of the 14 course nigiri here is delicious and you see the chef making each piece right in front of you. Our chef also explained what each piece was, and what types of processes went into making each different type of fish - so that made the experience even more enjoyable.  A sample of what's included in the 14 course nigiri: red snapper topped with finger lime, scottish ocean trout with japanese mint, albacore white tuna, house aged halibut with miso, japanese barracuda, baby red snapper with truffle essence, monkfish pate (this was insanely good), bluefin tuna, spanish mackerel.  \n\nWith respect to the supplemental nigiri, I was full when we finished the 14 course, but my boyfriend wasn't.  To me, the sushi was so good that even on a full stomach, I'd gladly pay for more.  I went with the recommended three nigiri supplement, and he got the wagyu sushi and the top-shelf uni (the supplement trio includes the locally sourced uni from Santa Barbara - if you're really into uni).  Out of the supplement and what he got, the two standouts were the shirayaki (which is a type of eel), which was topped with gold flakes - delicious and beautiful!  Also, the wagyu was the most decadent sushi I've ever had - topped with a very generous amount of shaved black truffle. \n\nDefinitely come check ju-ni out. The food is outstanding!", "author": "Lin Z."}

I think a lot of people forget that the whole point of omakase is to build that relationship with your chef so that he can provide you the best experience possible.

However, if you are looking for a modern spin on nigiri and can appreciate the creativity these chefs display, you will have a great time. We particularly enjoyed the layers upon layers of flavors and grating and freezing certain components of a dish that are typically served whole. \n\nOmakase is required at this establishment. A menu with the Supplement (add-ons) awaits you when you are seated. Towards the end of the 12-course nigiri, your chef will hand you the A la Carte menu. Chef Dan assured us there was no pressure to order the Supplements or the a la carte items, which was appreciated. However, we decided the offerings were too good to pass up even though we were starting to get full; my girlfriend opted for the Supplement (Chu Toro, Shirayaki (unagi), and uni) and I decided to get the O-Toro (the fattiest part of the underbelly of the tuna - absolutely delicious and melts in your mouth instantaneously) and the wagyu, which is the highest grade of wagyu offered. \n\nI won't go into detail about what we ate since the omakase menu varies depending on what is available that day; our chef told us most of their fish is flown in directly from Japan (from the famous Tsukiji Market in Tokyo!) and they receive new shipments twice a week. Chef Dan was the perfect combination of informative and funny, as he somehow managed to crack jokes in between telling us about each fish and the cooking techniques used. He also prepared for us a complimentary dish of tamago and lit a candle on it since he knew it was my girlfriend's birthday - a nice touch!\n\nThe service was also excellent - I don't think my tea cup ever dipped below the halfway point. I also noticed that when a fellow diner left her seat to use the restroom, the hostess immediately walked over to her seat and refolded her cloth napkin. \n\nThe only blemish in our meal for me was that I wish the dessert was something other than the pear served three ways. It tasted good and I did not dislike it, but I would have preferred something like a house made ice cream infused with a savory Japanese flavor, or mochi. \n\nTips:\n-To avoid being late for your reservation, get to the area early so you have ample time to find parking!\n- Order the Supplement and a la carte items! I can't quite lay a finger on it, but there is a little something extra offered in those items.", "author": "Olivia V."}

I was very excited to try this place as I am a huge fan of Sushi Ran and am generally an all around uppity sushi snob. Ju-ni has a very sleek ambiance and chic space, although parking can be tricky in this neighborhood. Omakase now costs $90 for 9 pieces + appetizer and dessert, but this does not account for the $30 supplement which includes uni, wagyu and toro. IMO, you can't do the omakase without the supplement, but $120 is not bad at all considering the pricing of other omakases in SF. \n\nEvery piece was unusual, delicate and surprising. Generally I feel an omakase will consist of a few amazing pieces, mostly good pieces, and sometimes unfortunately a few average or even bad pieces. But every piece here was wonderful and thoughtfully crafted. Take, for example, the cherry smoked mackerel. Or ikura topped with frozen ankimo shavings. I thought Sushi Ran served an outstanding omakase but this was even better! They do serve a smaller shari proportion but I appreciated the giant slabs of fish I was given and left quite full. Our chef, Steve, was kind and hilarious and very indulgent of my social media addiction. \"When you're ready, I'm ready\" -Steve\n\nI believe reservations are booked solid for weekends three months out but there are still a few weekday spots left.

The knowledge you get about where the fish comes from, type of fish, and the little details about the food is something to be appreciated. The food is as fresh as can be, many (or all) shipped directly from Japan on the daily! \n\nYou know when you've taken a bite and got goosebumps because you just ate one of the best things you've ever had? You'll get at least a couple of these bites here. I got the supplement because the wagyu with black truffle just sounded too good to pass up. Let me tell you, just get it. You have to try this. The fat content is crazy with the strategic use of black truffle. \n\nI've learned that japanese sea salt is amazing on many types of fish. Also, ponzu is a miracle sauce that enhances the flavors of each bite. The care that goes into each bite is amazing and you basically eat here to eat pieces of art. They've got a great beer and sake selection. The beer on the menu will all be from Japan, not the Canada-made Japanese beers you may be used to. \n\nYou can order ala-carte after your omakase meal or just add the supplement. Or do both! I added the shirayaki (fresh unagi) will forever ruin other unagi for me! I also added the O-toro (fatty Kindai tuna) which is the king of all kings. It's like butter!

The omakase set includes an appetizer, 12 pieces of nigiri, a soup and dessert. You can add a toro hand roll for $12 (which is mind blowing) and supplements of 3 nigiri favorites for an additional $35 (which you must do) and an a la carte menu is presented at the end of the meal. \n\nThe appetizer consisted of vegetables and a light sauce. Delicate and refreshing, just getting the taste buds warmed up for the meal ahead. \n\nThe first piece of sushi we got was horsehair crab with melted miso butter on top. OH MY LORD. This was a punch straight in the tastebuds. A wonderful start! \n\nA favorite of the night was the house cured ikura with frozen ankimo shaved on top. SO INSANELY AMAZING I wanted to stop chewing so the piece would last longer =(\n\nI won't go into detail with each piece of sushi, but holy moly. Every single bite was skillfully crafted to enhance the flavors in the best way possible and made the perfect bite. As other yelpers have stated, the pieces are on the smaller side, but still delicious. \n\nAfter the omakase, we ordered both the supplement and hand roll. Since I don't eat red meat, I ordered the fresh unagi in place of the wagyu. \n\nWOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW. The toro hand roll had great textures and flavors throughout it. The kaisui uni tasted like I was eating a piece of the ocean. The toro just melted in your mouth. AND THE UNAGI. Best unagi I've ever had!!! \n\nThe fish consomm\u00e9 at the end was a nice broth.

However, this place is very westernized (serving style, waiters' manner, chefs, interior design, etc), so if you expect to dine a traditional Japanese sushi with authentic Japanese atmosphere, this is not the restaurant to go. As we went in, we asked the waiter to get us hot tea (as you would in Japan), but the waiter insisted that we choose between sparkling and regular cold water. And when the tea finally arrived, it was too hot to grab the cup. Clearly, this restaurant does not know much about tea. And the waiter keep pouring tea to our cup (I guess that's a good manner in a French restaurant) keeping the tea hot and undrinkable. You can't serve like a French in a Japanese restaurant!

This restaurant had been on my 'to eat' list since it opened up last year. I didn't have a chance to try it until my birthday this past January when my BF booked us a reservation. \n\nIf you come in a bit before your reservation time there is a small window area to sit by the check-in desk. The host will take your name and offer you a drink list consisting of wines, beers, champagne, and sake. We came in a little early while the first seating was still there, however we didn't wait long and were seated promptly at our seating time. Everyone on staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We were also luck enough to have the head chef for the night!\n\nThe meal starts off with a salad as an appetizer, a 14 piece omakase, ice cream dessert, and then finally tomagoyaki! If theres still room in your belly for more at the end, they off an a la carte menu before dessert. Each course is planned out by the team ahead of time and they prep each cut right before your meal begins. As each piece is served, the Chef describes the fish, its origin, how its prepared, and so many other details. Their menu ranges from very simple to complex flavors, each one as amazing as the last. My favorite piece of the night is hard to pick, but I must say the ikura nigiri with house made frozen ankimo shavings is hard to deny. The sweet and salty flavors all explode at the same time. There are so many flavors and textures going on you can't focus on one - it's sooo good. Everything was good and I had no complaints. \n\nI also really love the decor and set up on the restaurant. A 12 party seater for intimate dining and conversation. In this day and age social media drives everything and I couldn't help be 'that girl' who is taking a picture of her food. Luckily, the Chefs encourage it! He was describing how their design is meant for that specific purpose. They also wipe down the stone plate between each serving, so everything is aesthetic AF. \n\nThe meal was definitely on the pricey side, but worth every penny. j\u016b-ni offers a real dining experience and I would recommend it to everyone looking.", "author": "Jen V."}

As it's only been open for a short amount of time, reservations weren't ridiculously difficult, but I still had to wait a couple weeks.\n\nI was slightly disappointed there wasn't a complimentary pour of something sparkling to kickstart the meal. I've kind of come to expect it after dining at some other similar venues like Omakase. Instead, the first course was a salad of rainbow carrots, beets and asparagus. It was tasty... but this is a $100+ meal, it could've had a little something extra in my opinion.\n\nFor the actual omakase portion of the meal, here's what was served:\n\n1. Miso Butter Kegani (Horsehair Crab) - YUM. You get to watch the chef make it right in front of you and with every second that passes, it looks tastier and tastier. This spoonful of tastiness is what should've kick started the meal.\n\n2. Red Snapper\n\n3. Hokkaido Scallop - Pretty generous in size.\n\n4. Bluefin Tuna\n\n5. Ocean Trout\n\n6. Skipjack Tuna\n\n7. Albacore\n\n8. Knifejaw - Interesting texture as it was a bit firmer.\n\n9. Baby Firefly Squid - I didn't expect to like this one as much as I did.\n\n10. Salmon Roe with Frozen Ankimo (Monkfish Liver) - So savory and so delicious. In my opinion, this piece should've been the capstone to the regular omakase menu.\n\n11. Baby Red Snapper\n\n12. Cherry Trout - It was good but kind of an odd one to end on if you don't get the supplement.\n\nSpeaking of which, I highly recommend getting the supplements for an additional $34 as they're obviously the best pieces. Also, the portions here are traditionally small, so you're going to be hungry for more. \n\n13. Seared Toro with Santa Barbara Uni - Very good but doesn't compare to the next two.\n\n14. Kaisui Uni - This made a believer out of me. I've always been pretty OK about uni. I had it at Tsukiji fish market in Japan and liked it and have never been that impressed with it anywhere else. This spoonful of uni brought me back. \n\n15. Wagyu (with optional Black Truffle for $6) - Perfect delicate and savory piece to end the meal.\n\nAll in all, it was a great dining experience though a bit pricey once you add in the supplements. I wouldn't have thought the basic omakase sans supplements was worth $90 plus tax and tip. Adding in the extra pieces, although for more $$$, made it a bit more value-worthy in price.", "author": "Charles L."}

Honestly, I would go back again and again if getting a reservation wasn't so darn hard. This place only seats 12 people at a time, hence the name \"ju-ni\" (twelve in Japanese). I haven't tried to make a reservation lately but last time I checked, I had to stalk their website for quite a while before a random spot opened up on a Friday night. Omakase used to be $98 per person but since they got their Michelin star, they've raised prices to $125 and now as of 9/5/17, it is $145 per person. WHY, WHY, WHY? Why must they continue to raise prices and make even larger dents in our wallets? Not sure if that $20 spike makes much of a difference given how much I enjoyed my omakase experience when I went. Their menu includes 18 courses which consists of appetizers, nigiris (I think 15 pcs) and dessert. I would try and rate what my favorites were but honestly everything tasted good and the fish just melts in your mouth. As some have commented, ju-ni actually does not use brown rice. I've asked the chef myself and he confirmed that it is white rice mixed with some soy sauce/vinegar mixture which gives the rice its brown color. They also use fish exclusively from Japan which is probably why they charge a premium. Highly recommend and would go back :)", "author": "June Y."}

I found rice and fish were fighting each other in my mouth.  My regular place in Tokyo prepares rice based on what the chef serves on that day.  He frequently prepares two kinds or rice and chooses it accordingly.  Perhaps asking to the level of precision would be too much to ask.\n\nFish:  overuse of salt and citrus, which overwhelmed the flavor of fish.  Also I'd like to see fish is sliced right before it is served.  Seeing all the fish pre-sliced and sitting on the board during the course of the meal was somewhat underwhelming.\n\nFish broth:  tasted too fishy and I could not finish it.\n\nPlacement of chopsticks:  there is a certain rule of how to place chopsticks in front of the customer.

The service is well good, too. You can still keep some privacy at the sushi bar. It's a good place for date and business.", "author": "Momo W."}

Dining in Ju-ni is a journey where you could connect your soul and your body through every piece of nigiri, where you could gain Japanese culinary knowledge through the mouth and the skill of the chef. As you go through the journey, you could sense how the texture and the mixing of every ingredient create a kick on your tongue, and your body literally shakes and float as a respond to them. What makes this place even more trendy is that the price is affordable as a one-starred Michelin restaurant. Make sure you keep an eye on their website because spots are taken very very quickly!!", "author": "Annabelle L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-07-04", "description": "Ju-Ni is a modern open-kitchen concept personal sushi experience. The interior is clean and simple, resembling a model Ikea kitchen. The chefs meticulously keep their workstations spotless and carefully arranged. Conversation is encouraged between both chef and other patrons as dishes are made at a slower pace. We had a young chef who was very friendly and passionate about his craft. Each section feels like you're at the chef's personal table.\n\nThe food usually had some twist to it, like shaved monk fish liver over ikura, aged yellowtail with lime zest, or miso buttered crab were all interesting. Although, I don't prefer room temperature rice and fish or heavily blow-torched fish. The butane taste overpowers the entire piece of sushi for me.\n\nI thought the non-sushi dishes were just ok. The hummus with salad had a good flavor but seemed out of place. Both the finishing soup and pear dessert dishes did not have as much flavor as I  was expecting. Portions were small and we left just barely not hungry. I was disappointed there wasn't any beer on draft but they had some imported Japanese bottled beer.\n\nWe were really impressed with Kusakabe from a couple weeks before, which made for a tough comparison for Ju-Ni. Although, I'm sure it will still do well and gain a following of foodies.", "author": "Kevin B."}

Heck yeah. \n\nj\u016b-ni is an intimate place with three chefs per night and seating for 12. There are two seatings a night at 6:00 and 8:30, so it's understandable that I had to make a reservation two months in advance for a Friday night. Lightweight annoyed (okay, really annoyed) at the people who were before us because we were seated close to 9pm. Hey, I forgive you guys though, cause I'd probably want to stay as long as I can at j\u016b-ni too. \n\nOmakase consists of an appetizer, 12 course nigiri, owan and dessert for $90. Then you have your a la carte menu or supplements (three nigiri favorites) to add-on at the end. \n\nWe opted for the supplements so that's 15 beautiful nigiris total. Highlights/stand-outs/mouth-gasms of the night include:\n\n- Ikura with frozen shaved ankimo: SIMPLY AMAZING. The frozen ankimo melted (literally) in your mouth and was definitely a unique one. My #1 of the night. \n\n- Hotate: flown in from Japan the night before, need I say more?\n\n- Hotaru Ika: First time having squid, so it was 1000x better than I expected. Super soft and tender.\n\n- Kindai Bluefin Tuna: Sustainable bluefin farmed in Japan! Melt in yo mouth delicious\n\n- Kaisui Uni (supplement): I have a confession to make, I really don't like uni. BUT the one here was DELICIOUS. Really light on the usual \"uni\" flavor, but that's probably why I like it so much. \n\n- Shirayaki (supplement): Damn you, j\u016b-ni for ruining unagi for me forever. Deliciously soft, yet crisp and topped with GOLD FLAKES.\n\nOf course, everything else was amazing as well. (With the exception of the dessert, I needed a real sweet fix afterwards lol)\n\nWe sat with Chef Gavin and really enjoyed watching him prepare our nigiri and learning more about all of the fish. I hope we didn't ask too many questions!\n\nI'm giving j\u016b-ni 5 stars because the experience was great overall. However..\n- yeah, like other Yelpers mention, the nigiri is on the smaller side\n- priciest omakase I've ever had.. ~$350 for two with supplements, a beer and tip \n\nBeing my third $$$$ omakase experience, I certainly am no expert when it comes to what to look for. What I can say, though, is that my stomach was happy and my wallet had no regrets. I won't be back anytime soon, because I'd be living in a cardboard box if I did LOL but I'd love to come back again one day. :)", "author": "Laverne N."}

The environment is nice, well renovated by the candy bar owners. The head chef is well seasoned, having have held tenures at akikos and worked with chef kusakabe, which makes me really want to like the place since both are on my favorite SF places for sushi list. However, I just think my friends and I weren't impressed by the omakase with add ons and I can't put my finger on it why. \nWe didn't think our meal was worth the hefty price tag of ~$180 each (1 beer each). You could spend the same amount at Akikos and have the most amazing 15-20 piece omakase there.\n\nThe nigiri pieces are very photogenic at ju-ni and our chef was great, but how do you differentiate good sushi from the best sushi?

By far, my fave modern omakase place in SF. \n\nReservations were relatively easy if you book in advance. Street parking (we took Bart/Lyft). I loved the concept, environment and setting inside. There are 3 chefs for a group of 4 ppl so it's a little more intimate and personal. The staff was very attentive. \n\nThe food was amazing. It was so diff since they do diff things in terms of prep and combo of ingredients that bring out various flavors without being too overpowering. Delish. I had the regular omakase + extended menu + a la carte. That's how much I enjoyed it. Plus I got to have unprocessed uni for the first time. If you haven't tried it, you should.. it was so yummy.

They were still in the renovation stage, but it looked nice, modern and bright, so I was curious as to what was going to take over Candybar's old spot. Fast forward a month, my friend sends me an article talking about ju-ni's anticipated opening and how reservations were already booked 2 months out! For weeks I tried to get reservations, but none were ever available. Fast forward to about 3 weeks ago, I was randomly looking up reservations and BAM one for 8:30 Saturday night! NOTE: They only do 2 services a night, one at 6 p.m. and one at 8:30 p.m.\n\nWe walked into the restaurant, and I immediately felt under-dressed in my denim jacket, crochet tank and leggings...But our chef, Patrick, said there is no dress code (though Yelp says dressy, and most people dressed well. Guys in jeans or nicer pants and button-ups, ladies in a dress or black pants and a nice top). The interior is VERY nice and appeals to a clean, modern aesthetic. All the chefs are dressed in chambray/light blue button-ups, which I thought was cute. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, our chef was Patrick and he was really great the entire night with answering our questions and just general chit chat. They really encourage an interactive, engaged dining experience vs. the more traditional omakase where the chef is a bit more stern/stiff and you don't really talk. I think this makes ju-ni a great spot for newcomers to the omakase world since the chefs are very informative. The rest of the staff was also very nice and attentive when it came to clearing dishes and filling up our glasses with water. \n\nNow, for the star(s) of the show: the omakase! A majority of their fish is sourced from Tsukiji, which is amazing! If it's not from Tsukiji, then it's locally sourced. As I mentioned earlier, Patrick explained every piece that he made for us and the servers who brought other courses explained those as well. \n\n- Heirloom tomato salad with edamame hummus and corn: Very interesting, but I didn't get much edamame flavor from the hummus. \n- Namahotate - Very smooth, has a nice bite and isn't too mushy.\n- Horsehair crab with miso butter - MELT-IN-YOUR-MOUTH deliciousness. The crab is super creamy and the butter pairs perfectly with how rich it is. \n- Kanpachi\n- Umimasu: Also very delicious~ I'm also very partial to the shiso leaf :P\n- Bincho Zuke: This was one of my favorites, I think this was also the one where they dipped the rice in sesame seeds. Added a nice texture + flavor.\n- Kisu: Another favorite! I liked the more chewy texture of the fish, and the sesame oil was a really nice touch.\n- Cucumber sunomono: Very interesting, I don't normally like bonito flakes but I thought it went well with this dish\n- Shima (?) aji: Not fishy for those who are concerned about mackerel being fishy\n- Halibut (I think, I forget) with it's own intestines as a garnish: Very rich due to the intestines~\n- Ikura with shaved ankimono: OH SUSHI GODS, THANK YOU FOR THIS. This is not traditional nigiri by any means, according to the chef, but SO DARN DELICIOUS. I'm not a fan of ikura as it tends to be too salty and fishy for my tastes, but ju-ni cures their own ikura with soy sauce, I think miso, and then honey. When you put this in your mouth, the frozen ankimono shavings start to melt and it's an amazing sensation of cold to warm.\n- Akami\n- New Zealand salmon (I may be wrong since I don't remember exactly, but it was definitely from New Zealand) topped with finger lime pulp: This was a very \"fun\" piece since the pulp would pop as you chew (well, duh).\n- Katsuo: I always love me some bonito! The texture was firm, but not too firm\n- Fish consumme: I thought this was very light in flavor\n- Genmaicha ice cream + cocoa and matcha crumble: MANY DELICIOUS. It was the dessert's debut, and all I can is YES.\n- Zuke chu toro (supplement): This was seared, though I think it would've been nice to have left it alone\n- Shirayaki (supplement): Freshwater eel with gold flakes (bling bling!). I don't normally like eel, but this was SO good! The top of the eel is broiled, so it's nice and crispy -- something I doubt you see in any type of unagi nigiri. The only bad thing was I bit into a bone, but not a huge deal. \n- A5 wagyu (supplement): We passed on the truffle since we're not huge fans of it (GASP??). The wagyu was rich and buttery in texture, but my piece was a bit chewy.\n- Toro handroll (supplement): I don't really care for toro nigiri (ANOTHER GASP??), but this was good. The pickled radish gave it a nice sour kick.\n\nMy only \"complaint\" is that I felt the fish:rice ratio was a bit off, i.e. not enough rice. \n\nThe bf and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and experience offered by ju-ni. As of now, it is our favorite omakase spot until we can venture out to more. But we aren't opposed to coming back ;D", "author": "Doris K."}

We learned a lot about the various types of fish and he kept us (and the couple at our station) engaged and entertained all night. It's as if we were all hanging out with good friends!\n\nNow let's talk about the food. We did the tasting and I have to say every single piece of fish we had was fresh and melted in our mouths. Every single one! I have done the omakase at both Kusakabe and Omakase, and of all three, this was the one place where I loved every single thing that I ate. \n\nMy favorites from the tasting were:\n1) Akami (bluefin tuna loin) - Very very simple but still such a standout! This was supposed to be from the lean part of the fish but you would think you were eating the fattiest part - it absolutely melts in your mouth and the flavor is rich!\n2) Roe with frozen shaved Ankimo - never had anything like this and the (generously shaved) frozen Ankimo melted like ice cream - delicious!\n3) Hotate - large piece and melts in your mouth\n4) Bonito - very flavorful fish topped with thinly sliced garlic\n\nI'll admit the tasting alone is not enough so we got 4 additional items, and our favorites were:\n1) A5 Wagyu BMS 12 (highest marbling score) - unlike any other wagyu nigiri I've had, this literally was like pure butter. \n2) Akamutsu (black throat fish) - like a white rock fish topped with its very creamy liver\n\nIn the end this (including a la carte order) was still significantly cheaper than Omakase (almost $100 cheaper per person without alcohol). In terms of the overall experience with our chef, this was by far my favorite over Kusakabe and Omakase. I would say the one thing Omakase had over Ju-Ni was the more fine-dining service and complimentary champagne.

That being said, I do think there is room for improvement. \n\nThe 12 piece omakase cost $90 but in reality, you will have to spend an additional $35 for the supplements (uni, wagyu, and toro). This concept of \"supplementing\" with arguably the three most delicious nigiri is a smart way of denying you the three most expensive nigiri in the base set. While I found each piece to be fresh and well-seasoned, the portion sizes are VERY small. I was hungry even with the supplements. \n\nMany of the other reviews rave about the house cured ikura with frozen ankimo but it was actually one of my least favorite pieces. The frozen ankimo is relatively flavorless and just leaves a lot to be desired. It's texturally interesting since it feels like snow melting in your mouth but I prefer normal ankimo any day. It's a bit gimmicky. \n\nOverall, I recommend trying this place but maybe pre (or post) game with a burrito.", "author": "Xinxin W."}

It's reservations only and weekend reservations are booked solid for the next 2 months.

There's a supplement and a la carte menu available. Beer, sake, and shochu only.

Geoff started with lighter fish and moved on to fatter ones. No soy or wasabi is provided, instead each nigiri is artfully adorned with unique accoutrements that best highlight the fish that's flown in from Tsukiji Market. I eat sushi regularly, and it was my first time having miso made from whole wheat, sakura leaf (cherry blossom flavor), and honey in nigiri but it worked beautifully because it was subtle.\n\nThe highlight was the Ikura nigiri topped with frozen ankimo shavings. The honey tempered the pungent saltiness of the ikura and the shavings were like heavenly snowflakes that effortlessly melt in your mouth. My only gripe was the shari.

Ever since Wako, Kusakabe & Yoshizumi earned a Michelin star, I feel like high-quality sushi restaurants have been popping up nonstop in San Francisco within the past 12 months!\n\n\nJu-ni is fantastic for a special occasion experience. Personally, it's too expensive to make this a frequent Go-To sushi spot for me. The prices have already increased again. It is now $90 for the Omakase, but you pretty much feel obligated to get the $34 supplement, otherwise you don't get Uni at all in the normal Omakase.So with that, you're already looking at $130 per person pre-tip, alcohol, tax. We bought a bottle of delicious, crisp and light sake and our meal for two was around $360 out the door.\n\nEach diner gets personalized attention as many have already noted- 1 chef per 4 individuals. I was happy that we came here and they accommodated seating us next to my friend Suany - was fun having the Chef to our group of 4! The fish was of course excellent. Each piece of nigiri was carefully crafted into a bite of amazing-ness.The shari was also delicious but in my opinion, I felt the rice to sushi proportions weren't great. There wasn't enough rice and I felt that each nigiri ended up being super tiny! Ju-ni does offer a slightly more \"fusion\" presentation than An or Yoshizumi. It reminds me a lot of Akiko's- They like to fancy up their nigiri -edible gold flakes and black truffle shavings are part of the $34 supplement. My favorite nigiri was the Ikura with frozen Ankimo shavings - very unique and delicious. The frozen ankimo shavings made for a refreshing bite!\n\nUnfortunately even with the supplement I was pretty hungry later and ordered pizza two hours after. If only the shari proportion was better in each nigiri...\n\nOverall, this is an amazing place for a special occasion - delicious sushi in an elegant sushi bar environment.

It's just not top spot in SF for sushi as Kukasabe and Wako are much better and more reasonably priced.\n\nIssues-\n1.  The rice was slightly over cooked.  But the biggest problem is the rice was too wet.  It also could use a little more vinegar.  Keeping the rice inside rice cooker is probably the dumbest thing you can do.  \n\n2.  Over use of lime on some of the dishes.\n\nI will provide in-depth review on each dish.\n\n1.  Hairy Crab- The hairy crab starter was burnt from being over torched.  Not much flavor except burnt.\n\n2.  Kampanchi- The fish itself was quiet good and flavorful.  But it was over dressed with lime.  \n\n3.  Hotate (scallop)-  The hokkaido scallop was very sweet.  Its a good dish except, there is no flavor from rice.  Would be good sashimi.\n\n4.  Red Snapper- the fish was perfectly torched to bring out the fat sweet flavor, addition of finger lime on top further improved the overall flavor.  This would have been exceptional if the rice flavor can come through at the end.  It just left me want to have a finish and not getting it.  \n\n5.  Aji- too much ginger but passable.\n\n6. Marinade Albacore with sesame- excellent marinade, quiet flavorful with a hint of sesame.  But with rice being soft and soggy, i really wished it has more structure.\n\n7. Salmon with sea salt-  this was disaster.  The fish wasn't cut in right direction and was starting to fall apart.  Its just way too salty.\n\n8. Barracuda with ginger and scallion- the fish itself was not as good as those of Yoshizumi hence after searing, it was not as flavorful.  It would have been saved if the rice is more sour and more flavorful.\n\n9. Ikura with super frozen monk liver shaving- this was excellent dish.  Ikura was not overly salty, addition of monk liver shaving added necessary sweet and bitterness to the dish.  Wonderful.\n\n10.  Madai (sea bream) with peppercorn miso-  the miso was too spicy and strong- ruined perfectly fine sea bream.\n\n11.  Bonito- very disappointed- complete lack for flavor.  \n\n12. Marinade Toro- marinade was excellent (not too salty), searing was good.  But again the rice did not round up the dish.\n\n13.  Uni- decent but not special\n\n14.  Unagi-  the style is same as kusakabe.  But the sauce is too watery and overly sweet.  Killed the Unagi.\n\n15.  Negi-Toro hand roll-  this was another disaster.  Yoshizumi would pre-mix the wasabi, ginger, and scallion before serving.  That way the flavor will be consistent from beginning to the end.  Ju-ni did not do that.  So 3 out of the 4 bite, it was just overwhelming toro fat.  The last bite were the Wasabi was finally present, it was excellent.  Really pissed me off.\n\nOverall- I give this place a 3.5 star (since Yelp don't allow 3.5- it was round down to 3).  This place is very creative with its seasoning.  But couple dishes was over seasoned.  Rice is a big problem here.   There are better places in SF (Kusakabe, Wako).  For what I get, its over priced.\n\nRanking so far- Yoshizumi, Kusakabe, Wako remain top three in the bay area.  Ju-ni is okay, more creative than Ijji.  I will rank Ju-Ni just slightly better than Ijji.", "author": "Jerry W."}

From the artwork on the walls from a local street artist down to the Japanese imported beer list-- everything is intentional. \n4.

It recently took over Candybar and is absolutely gorgeous in its decor - white minimalist walls, Heath ceramics, and beautiful wood counters. \n\nThey're still in their \"soft opening\" phase so there are only 2 seatings: 6 PM & 8:30 PM for 12 seats. There's a chef per every 4 people at the sushi counter so the experience is very personalized. Only one of the chefs actually cut the fish, while the other 2 chefs craft the actual nigiri.\n\nThe omakase menu is $82 for 12 pieces of nigiri, appetizer, owan, and a small dessert with the option to add on a la carte or additions such as chu-toro and wagyu after your meal. The price point is not bad, especially if you compare it to Kusakabe, Omakase, or other high-end sushi restaurants in SF.\n\nThe fish are flown in twice weekly from Japan, so expect the omakase to change on a regular basis. The other interesting thing is that they don't showcase the fish in cases like most sushi places in the States. The counter is immaculately clean as the chefs prepare the sushi in different exacting ways. \n\nI thought the meal at ju-ni, while good, innovative, and fresh, didn't quite hit home for me as much as Wako or Kusakabe. While our sushi chef was fun, interesting, and clearly trained, I thought the seasonings for some of the nigiri were a tad off, and the fish could have been sliced better. I'm giving them some leeway as I was there during their first week and there is always room for improvement as they perfect their service.", "author": "Kate M."}

In the last year, I've been to four of them: Kusakabe, Sushi Yoshizumi, Maruya, now Ju-ni. One by one they've earned their michelin stars (well... maruya lost its star last year), and I think Ju-ni is on track for one pretty soon. They all set a new standard of omakase restaurant. Frankly, $100+ for a sushi dinner sounds expensive, but it will cost roughly the same for similar type of restaurant in Japan!\nI heard about this restaurant at first from EaterSF, I was excited another omakase restaurant shows up in the SF food scene. I wanted my colleague to try it so I made a reservation for 6 people before the restaurant was open. I doubt you can make a reservation for such a large party anymore. I saw a lot of great reviews about this place after the restaurant was opened, so i believed I made a good bet.\nMy reservation was for 830pm. Upon arrival, the previous seating was wrapping up. We were quickly seated after they bused the tables. With great luck we were seated with Chef Jeff, who was the main chef for the restaurant. He's extremely friendly and answered of our questions. One of the thing I appreciate is the chef's knives collection, Jeff was kind enough to show them to me and share his thoughts. The setting of this restaurant is between contemporary, modern, with a hint of traditional. Lots of custom wood work that represent a traditional japanese restaurant, yet the modern touch with cambria counter top. I really like it, i think my kitchen will look like that one day haha.\nWe did the regular menu, plus the toro handroll, and a few other off the a-la-carte menu. I like the run-down of sushi that Jeff orchestrated. Sushi, especially nigiri, is an art, and it was enjoyable to observe and listen to Jeff when he made them. His take on nigiri is a twist of the traditional edomae sushi, not fusion, just a twist. He adds his ideas into what sushi can be, with more modern techniques and combination of traditional ingredients.\nMost of the yelpers uploaded fantastic pictures of the nigiri, I uploaded a lot too. People exclaimed about the shaved ankimo over salmon roe, it really was fascinating, and I will forever remember it. Overall I do enjoy the dinner, especially they mainly stick with nigiri. I do urge people to try this place before it becomes impossible to make reservations.", "author": "Gary C."}

Boy did it not disappoint!  Here's a quick breakdown of all the parts that helped make it a great meal from start to finish:\n\nDrinks:\nOscar was very friendly and knowledgeable about the sake list and even offered unlimited samples of anything we wanted to try (we tried about 3-4 different ones before settling on one we liked).\n\nAmbiance/Service:\nThe service is very on point as they are quick (some might say too quick?) to swap out dishes and silverware and also refill your water (and adult beverages if you so chose).  Daniel, our sushi chef for the night, was the real highlight here though as he is very friendly and was constantly engaged with us throughout the meal.  He also knew everything about each plate inside and out and seemed to take a great deal of pride in it.  \n\nFood:\nOn to the good stuff - I won't get into a list of every single plate that came out as your only options are either the omakase or omakase + extended menu (so the dishes will vary depending on what they've gotten in) but I will say that you should absolutely get the extended add-on 10/10 times =D (this particular night the extended included A5 Wagyu, Zuke Toro topped with caviar and Hokkaido Uni).   There is a small a la carte menu that they give you after the standard omakase with about 8 items (that include the 3 items that are in the extended menu) and of the items not in the extended it seemed like the Toro handroll was a really popular choice (and looked amazing as the person next to me got it and it had huge hunks of Toro topped off with a nice dollop of uni).\n\nAll in all a great meal encompassed within a great experience led by an awesome guide!  I just may have found my new favorite SF sushi joint.", "author": "Aaron K."}

They only have 2 serving sessions per night, so reserve seats while you can.  Don't be discouraged if the reservation system tells you there is a 1-2 month wait.  Call in and see if they have available spots.  I was able to get reservations the next day.\n\nThis place brought back memories of Japan's finest sushi spots and did omakase right.  Fish flown straight from tsukiji market, i could easily categorize Ju-ni equivalent to a 1.5 star Michelin level restaurant.  \n\nWe were served by Chef Steve whom had amazing service!  At one point, the customers next to us went to the restroom.  Chef Steve waited til he came back before he seared his sushi.  We ordered the wagyu a5 which was the last cut left and the customers next to us ordered it a few minutes after us.  Our chef discarded the our last batch of wagyu, opened up a brand new package, and served us all from the same batch!  Talk about sparing no expenses for top notch service.  His attention to detail was on another level. And they wipe your serving plate after each serving.  They also tell you exactly what you're eating and where its from.  \n\nWe had started with the 12 course omakase and finished it off with a la carte.  You need to finish the omakase first, before you unlock the a la carte menu.  I highly encourage you to try the best of what they have on the a la carte menu, because thats where the prime nigiri is at.\n\nJu Ni's Executive chef is from Kusakabe and Akkiko, and sommeliers from Gary Danko, their sake was amazing too! The chefs look young, but they definitely know what they are doing.\n\nIf you want to be traditional, they encourage you to eat the nigiri with your fingers and have a small cleaning tray to wipe them between each session.  The one tiny little feedback id give them, is I wish they gave out hand towels to wipe your hands before you start.  (Just something they do often in Japan).  But its no biggie to just go to the restroom.  \n\nAs for the food, well the pictures don't do justice, you have to try it for yourself.  \n\nThe wagyu a5 is a bms 12.  The highest grade wagyu beef with the highest fat content.  Basically its the best of the best at a reasonable price.  It was seared on one side, and slightly flamed on the other.  I added the spring truffle, which doesn't taste like a normal black truffle that everyone is accustomed to.  I probably wont order the truffle next time.  \n\nThe wagyu, otoro, and uni was like BUTTER and melts in your mouth.  The sushi rice was amazing!  Oysters with caviar was amazing! Im sad because every sushi restaurant i go to now will taste like crap.  Ive been spoiled...\n\nSpoil yourself and see what a real omakase experience is supposed to be like.", "author": "Brian J."}

Kind of fish, where it's from, how long has the fish been aged, etc.)\n\nThis restaurant is omakase only where it's a set menu and you have the choice to add supplement items as well as some ala carte if you're still hungry. They have a selective list of beer, wine and sake. Staff and chef are friendly and talkative which made the experience above and beyond.

The sushi chef said it wasn't a problem. After the other pieces we were served the chef tells us that they ran out of the chu toro. When we look to the left, the other couple were being served the only two pieces they had. That was a slap to the face. We even hear the other sushi chef say that its his favorite piece. F#@%ing great, just want we wanted to hear when we can't have it!\n\nWith this being the first seating at 6pm and with only 12 people total in the restaurant, it was a huge disappointment that there were only two pieces of it left. That's bad preparation. On the menu, it even called out that its a Nigiri favorite, so why wouldn't this restaurant prepare more?!? \n\nAdding insult to injury, this restaurant texts us an hour before our reservation with a \"pro tip\".\n\n\"Take advantage of the supplemental menu, its a perfect ending to your experience. Enjoy!\"\n\nThis actually made us more excited only to be let down in the end. \n\nThe cost of the dinner was to be expected. High end sushi joints like this for two people always range from $400 to $500. But for that price, you better not run out of one of the so-called \"nigiri favorites\".  \n\nWith all the high end sushi restaurants I've been to, I've never been to one that ran out of chu toro or o-toro. I've considered it the best and richest piece and so have many others. At Maruya, I ordered 2 pieces of it after the omakase because Chef Hide prepared it so well. At Sushi Ran, its always my last piece ordered. In Tokyo, I make it clear to every sushi chef that that's the last piece I want to end the meal with. \n\nShout out to our chef, Steve. He was kind and comped us a different piece since they did not have the chu toro. None of the fault was his even though he apologized many times for it. The fault lies with the restaurant's preparation for the night. \n\nI would have considered coming back here but not anymore. I don't want to risk coming back and not getting what I want.

This time around, I had Geoffrey as my chef.  As the owner, he's the most experienced, and he's also very personable.\n\nThey have sake, beer, and wine. We were able to have small tastes of some of the sakes before choosing, and we went with a bottle of the Black Dragon, which I liked - not too dry, not too sweet, no melon flavor.\n\nThe price has gone up slightly since I was last there - now $118 for the omakase. \n\nAPPETIZER:\nRomanesco, beets, dressed in yuzu dressing, served over a dashi cauliflower puree.

The quality of food definitely showed in flavor, I love when sushi isn't fishy. Just about everything was imported which was great and the plating was phenomenal. You can't come in with a faint heart for your wallet, but that's to be expected way before you even make the reservation in advance. I definitely recommend coming at least once in your life if you really enjoy sushi and/or want to impress someone. They definitely take you through a journey of many small dishes. The supplements are also worth doing.\n\nMy only small gripe was when our neighboring couple had a glass of wine spilled on them by the chef, of course on accident. The mood quickly changed and we definitely felt it. The couple was basically finishing at that point and this sounds a little selfish but we still had extra orders of food coming. The chef quickly became uber apologetic to the couple and although he sort of tried to entertain us we were left in the dust so to speak. They couldn't stop apologizing to them and talking to them and offering them things, which yes they should do, but we were just kind of there and it felt a bit awkward. I hate to say it but it kind of ruined how I felt about the place when we were getting ready to leave.

I think this is one of the first really good sushi restaurants in SF. 90% of their fish is imported from Tsukiji fish market in Japan, and others were either domestic or from other places internationally. My favorites were the Scottish ocean trout (so soft and fatty), chu-toro (tasty and fatty but not too much fat), shiro ebi from Hokkaido (so smooth!), the Ankimo monkfish liver with ikura (I usually hate monkfish liver, but it mellowed out the saltiness of the ikura). All were well executed! For the 17-piece omakase menu, it was $125 which wasn't bad for the quality IMO. We did add on a few extra pieces, like a chu-toro temaki (so good - great crispiness to the seaweed) which I thought was worth it. Can't remember the corkage. Our total bill with two omakase's, maybe 2-3 extra pieces of sushi, wine, and gratuity came out to ~$500. I honestly thought it was well spent!\n\nAmbiance:\nBeautiful, modern, sleek and simple decor. I liked the way the had us sit down. Most people come in with a party of 2-4, and so we were seated with another random couple. We both shared the same sushi chef and had all of our servings together. \n\nService:\nFantastic. My bf and I felt that we could make a connection with our sushi chef and also the sommelier. It was funny that they were all millennials...just kinda strange but cool at the same time. They have profiles for each of the sushi chefs on the website, and we had Roger, who used to work at Sushi Ran! We had a great time joking with him the whole night. I forget the Somm's name, but he recognized our wine, and we had a really cool conversation. Can't really remember much from the conversation since I was drunk AF, but I remember having a great time.\n\nI'd definitely return. Loved the experience overall. I think it'd be fun to come here with a reservation for 4 people and just go crazy with the sushi! You'll be in good hands and good company (with your friends and also the employees here).", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

I get what this style of food is all about. I'm a foodie and love new and interesting flavors. I only eat out at restaurants that will give me a great food experience that I can't recreate at home.\n\nFor the price, I expected better flavors. Not only was the food totally bland, but after my main tasting, I was still quite hungry. The tasting menu was $90 per person and the add-ons varied from $17-$34. We ordered quite a few additional items due to being hungry. With drinks and tip, the bill for 4 people came in at almost $1000. \n\nThere are quite a few other reviews here that list out the dishes, so I am not going to go into that. Our tasting was pretty close to those shown here.\n\nThe service was decent; the waitstaff was attentive, tho it's hard not to be attentive when you only have 12 people to serve. \n\nThis is 2.5hrs of my life and 500 of my hard-earned dollars I will never get back.

He handles every piece of fish so delicately, the fish and him are one. \n\nJu-Ni is a newer restaurant that has popped up. It took 2-months to get RSVP so plan way ahead. There is very limited seating. The restaurant itself is beautiful and well designed. I would actually say in terms of design and aesthetic appeal, Ju-Ni wins the race; food, not so much. \n\nThere is 1 tasting menu. $90 per person. Very reasonable. But when you add in all the extra supplements, it brings the tasting to $146 per person pre tax and tip. Don't forget about the champagne and beer either. It can easily come out to $500 for 2 (which is how much our bill was.)\n\nAt that price, I expect experienced chefs with precise handing to each fish. Unfortunately that is not what I experienced.\n\nThe fishes were thrown into the box and handled in a \"whatever\" way. I would expect it to be handled delicately. \n\nI agree with some of the other reviewers when they said lemon was over used. It was on many slices of fish (squeezed, not brushed).\n\nI would have also preferred my rice to have more of a vinegar taste. And lastly, the pick up was not always clean on each piece of fish. Sometimes there was rice left over on the counter or the rice would crumble in my hand. \n\nOverall, the taste just wasn't there. It was not creative enough, nor special. \n\nI will say the highlights of the meal were:\n\n-A5 waygu with truffles- incredible! You have to get this.\n- Some seared white fish- a really good mixture of chewy and soft texture.\n\nSadly, I was over charged for 6 glasses of champagne. Now I know I was drinking but I was't that drunk to the point where I couldn't count. Lol. I had 3 glasses. I brought this to the attention of the waitress, she changed it. I was then charged $27/$26 a glass when the menu said $22. Once again I had to bring this to her attention. \n\nThe owner was nice enough to apologize and offered a small gift card amount as a \"sorry for the mix up\". \n\nSo there you have it, Ju-Ni in a summary from my 1st experience.", "author": "Carrie Y."}

Ju-ni is a bit different - chef Geoffrey is extremely friendly, and we enjoyed conversing with him about our meal and with random other topics. The sushi is also a bit different - it's not just a well-prepared piece of fish with the perfect rice with a little bit of vinegar or soy sauce. Some come topped with caviar, others with gold flakes, and some others with shavings of liquid nitrogen-frozen ankimo.

Only problem is that it comes with a huge price tag and it's really difficult to make a reservation, but I like that they are on Resy so you can set notifications for when something opens up. For other points of reference, I've eaten sushi at many places in San Francisco (Kusakabe, Sushi Hon, Tsubasa Sushi, Saru Sushi), in Japan, NYC, etc. This place was really delicious, but for 2 people (including one drink each), set us back about $350 after tip and tax. It is not easy on the pocketbook. I think if you're coming for a special occasion to celebrate a birthday or anniversary, or if you have money burning a hole in your pocket, it's fine. I still think Tsubasa Sushi in Hayes Valley is my top pick for great sushi & nigiri at reasonable prices.\n\nIf you're coming to this place, a party of just 2 (maybe 3) is best because everyone is seated around the sushi bar. There are very limited seats in here, and reservations are only at 6 pm and 8:30 pm. Don't try driving and parking in NoPa because it's difficult and frustrating - just take Uber/Lyft. The decor is very minimalistic and modern, wood counters, and ceramic plates. \n\nThe food was all fantastic and all the fish was really fresh. The nigiri was all delicious and each piece of fish was prepared differently, some with lime zested on top, finger lime on top, and some of the fish was seared with a blow torch. It was fun to see the sushi chef make everything and explain it all. They had one with roe and shaved frozen monkfish liver on top which was really unique. They also had an appetizer and a dessert (ice cream)\n\nOverall, an excellent meal -- more nigiri than at Kusakabe, but if I'm paying ~$150 per person, I wanted a little more more variety. Kusakabe was just a notch above for me (at very similar price points) because the plating and variety of dishes were a little more interesting. I really loved the fish at Ju-ni, but I felt like I could get similar nigiri with less of an experience & less service, but at cheaper price points at Tsubasa Sushi.\n\nWorth a try for a special occasion if you love nigiri.", "author": "Christina L."}

Finally, my boyfriend returned from school and we were able to try during his spring break! We arrived early and was seated near the hostess to wait for the next seating to be set-up. Immediately a server came up to us and offered their drinks menu, so +1 for attentiveness & customer service. There are 3 chefs per 4 customers, which allows them to focus on perfecting everything they make for each person. We had chef Patrick, who was friendly and even joked with us. The couple next to us were gluten-free, and Patrick was very accommodating and had sauce and fish prepared for them separately from ours (+1 for being so accommodating and friendly). Our menu was even personalized with \"Happy Anniversary\" since we told them it was what we were celebrating for dinner - super nice of them. My boyfriend and I had an alcoholic drink (Riesling & Hitachino Nest beer [very yummy, would order again]) along with genmaicha tea ($4 each) to pair with our meals. We started off the Chef's Choice Omakase with a small salad with red beets - yum! We started off with a spoonful of charred horsehair crab meat from Hokkaido topped with scallions. With our omakase we had: Shimaji, scallops, bluefin tuna, flying fish, golden eye snapper, soy-cured albacore, bioluminescent firefly squid, flounder, salmon roe & frozen grated ankimo (signature dish), cherry salmon, red snapper with truffle dust on top, Spanish mackerel, and cooked fresh water eel with gold flakes on top. My favorite of those would have to be their signature dish - it was a melt-in-your-mouth experience that I wish I could have ordered again in their ala carte menu. We opted in for the extended menu because an omakase isn't one without the uni, toro and wagyu! The wagyu was charred to its perfection  and also a melt-in-your-mouth experience. They had the A5 Wagyu with a BMS of 12 - oh man was it yum, especially when he threw on some truffle dust for me! Uni was also fresh because it wasn't fishy (since I'm normally not an uni fan due to the fishy taste), and the toro was so fatty - it was like liquid once it hit my mouth. I would have totally ordered all three of those again if I weren't so full at the end of it. In bewteen the meal we had a palette cleanser of cucumber in this amazing sauce with sesame seed - the crunch to the cucumber was super satisfying. The meal ended with a tasty tamago, enoki soup, and their genmaicha ice cream with green tea crunchy bits on top! I'm a huge green tea ice cream fan and this one was so good.. it kept me wanting more too! Overall, I'm very satisfied with this spot - it has definitely made it to my top list of omakase spots in San Francisco next to Kusakabe. The meal ended up being $409 pre-tip, which was pretty pricey - but the experience cannot be driven by the price. Would love to return one day :)", "author": "Amanda C."}

He was very polite and served four patrons during this seating. To his left was Geoffrey, which we recognized from his Akiko days. Why am I mentioning this? Well, I could hardly hear Steve if he spoke the same time as Geoffrey and when we were at different courses, this became a distraction for the customers, particularly when Steve was ahead of Geoffrey or vice versa.\n\nNow to the food. The omakase has a few palate cleansers, veggies, 12 pieces of nigiri and dessert. At the end, you can order a la carte nigiri - all of which was not previously served in the omakase. There were a few standout items - the kampachi (amber jack), hotate from Hokkaido (scallop) and ikura with shaved ankimo (roe with monkfish liver). From the a la carte menu, we ordered a5 wagyu and kaisui uni. I took photos of everything except for the hotate since I didn't know we would have to pick up the nigiri from Steve's hand. It was a bit awkward but delicious. \n\nI'm a bit torn between 3.5 stars to 4 stars for this review. While we enjoyed our experience and the fish was fresh, what we were served was not something I would say was amazing or creative and would warrant an immediate return. The one thing that really stood out was the rice the fish was served on - it kept crumbling and breaking apart. It was almost as if the rice was over cooked. They also liked to serve quite a few pieces of nigiri with a squeeze of lemon, which I thought was odd. For the price point, I would expect more from Ju-ni.

Every piece I had was nothing short of amazing. Most omakase places I've been to has at least one piece where I'm not the biggest fan. Typically, it's due to things such as imbalance of taste (e.g. shiso flavor overpowers fish or torching left piece too burnt) or the fish just tastes a little off. But during my meal here, none of that was applicable. It wasn't the most beautiful presentation I've ever seen, but it was one of the few times I felt every single piece was perfectly balanced and delicious. Our chef was also really approachable and friendly.

And the counter was the same height as our dining counter. Because there's no cold case, each of the sushi chefs had to travel back and forth to the other to get stuff. Didn't help the experience at all. Which wasn't as disconcerting as the overhead lights that casts a shadow over the sushi chef as he's bent over the fish. So he's cutting in the shadow - not an ideal work station. Music way too loud.

In coming here with my husband for their second seating at 8:30pm, I wasn't really sure what to expect.  Having checked off a number of sushi spots in and around SF, I am inherently skeptical of anything that pops up that represents high-end sushi.  That being said, it would be a lie if I didn't say I was interested when I read about j\u016b-ni on Eater, so when we got a reservation, I was excited.  In being seated, we were put with Geoff with two other people and proceeded to go through our 12 course omakase.  I would expand on what we had, but truthfully, the menu will likely change since the fish is flown in from Tokyo on a regular basis and is subject to availability.  So, what can I say? j\u016b-ni may just be my favorite sushi place in SF.  Yeah, I just said that.  It trumps our experience at Omakase, ICHI, and even Kusakabe.  I know it's a bold statement, but everything we had here was absolutely outstanding. My favorite was the Kisu nigiri; the experience took me back to sushi at Jiro in Tokyo.  My husband's favorite was the shark skin flounder nigiri.  Both of us agreed that almost all the pieces we had were fish that we had limited experience with, and enjoyed trying something new rather than the \"traditional\" edomae experience.  If there was any critique that we'd give, it would be that our dinner took a little longer than what a typical sushi dinner runs.  The amount of work that Geoff-san puts into some of his pieces is supremely laborious, and while everything comes out incredible, it does mean that your meal will run a little long.  In any case, I've already booked another reservation for here in May and am really looking forward to being back!", "author": "Lisa I."}

We snagged at Sunday reservation (likely due to a cancellation) about 2 weeks out for the 6pm seating. The restaurant is incredibly mellow and zen when you arrive. With only 12 seats, you're front row for your own show with your dedicated chef for the night. Our chef was really great- answered questions, shared interesting facts about the origins of the fish and was just generally really nice. The tasting was outstanding! The fish was all so expertly prepared and \"melt in your mouth\" delicious. We also opted for the tuna hand roll supplement after our tasting menu. It's definitely a pricey experience but well worth it if you're looking for an amazing omakase style tasting.", "author": "Nikki S."}

That and so much more information about the fish, design and other aspects of the restaurant are freely shared by the chef as he prepares your food. This place is omakase ONLY. In other words, patrons have the option to add on select pieces of fish but only after you've had their standard omakase as the base. It's not just a young restaurant in the sense that it opened merely three months ago. It's also young in the approach to the fish, the decor style and the chefs themselves. Does not seem the chefs are classically trained (although they each have experience working in kitchens of competitors) and there is an element of fusion that some may appreciate more than others, such as their starter dish salad of corn and tomatoes. They also seem to be adventurous, incorporating less traditional techniques such as brown sugar rather than white sugar in their rice. Not sure how they got four $s as the standard omakase is less than $100. Perhaps it's because their sake selection is a bit pricey, and there are few less expensive options. As for their beer, you get more than the standard Sapporo. The white ale they have is quite good. If you can't enjoy any of the pre-chosen omakase selection because of allergies or other, they don't seem to give you a replacement/alternative dish. Rather, you just misses out on that particular dish altogether. Hope their creativity and ambition helps them improve with age. For now, it's decent and absolutely worth the price they charge but probably not the high end quality sushi available (but again, probably in part because it's also less expensive) at Akiko's or Kusakabe.", "author": "Kimberly H."}

While the sushi is of high quality I don't think its deserving of a michelin star, but I would recommend it for those looking for more modern tasting sushi. \n\nUnline Kusakabe and Wako which hosts 2-3 sushi chefs behind the counters, Ju-ni is intimate in that there is one chef per 4 customers. This is great for more inquisitive types who want to learn more about fish, seasonings, technique, etc. However, there appears to be deviance in the character, skill, and pedigree of each chef. This results in varying experiences for each customer. \n\nSushi wise the fish was of great quality, however the rice is noticeably different; they use brown sugar in their rice and its noticeably more clumpy and firm than others and the temperature is slightly colder. Another gripe is some fish were overly and repetitively seasoned with the same dressings; soy sauce, sea salt, and lemon.  Their signature of shaved ankimo is definitely delicious, but overall the whole place is very modern in their approach and untraditional.\n\nIn the end, I'd come back and I'd recommend it, but I'm nowhere dying to see its nuance in seasonality as I would other places.", "author": "Chad S."}

I'm drawn to sushi places that can offer me a taste experience that is hard to get or that you can't get anywhere else. For me, that's choice cuts of chef-seasoned, premium, rare and seasonal fish. Not to say I'm going to turn my nose up at a rainbow or spicy salmon roll (I will however turn my nose up at any \"sushi\" with cream cheese in it), but I do prefer to spend my sushi allowance on omakase-based sushi restaurants. \n\nSo when I read an article about ju-ni, I had to take my boo-thang of the moment over for a little splurge. When I went, the omakase was $85 plus a $35 supplement. Maybe they've raised their prices to $90 since then (based on other reviews) but I would gladly go back and pay that extra $5 - which in the world of omakase isn't bad at all. Word hadn't gotten out quite yet and there were only 6 other people in the restaurant for the first seating so we actually got our sushi chef all to ourselves for a pretty intimate dining experience. \n\nWhile all of the fish was spectacular, the standout to me was the uni. It's fresh-packed from Hokkaido in some juicy junk - not in the box like you see elsewhere - and it was by far the most delicious uni I have ever had in my mouf! Another standout was a white fish that had shaved frozen monkfish liver on top. I despise monkfish liver but I loooooooved this preparation! \n\nThe sake that was recommended was on point - Black Dragon if I'm not mistaken - and the service was exceptional.

It is reservation only with 2 seating times: 6:00PM or 8:30PM. As to the fish, 90% is sourced from Tsukiji Market in Tokyo. Only street parking available which is fairly hard to find, so be sure to give yourself ample time as they have a strict reservation policy. There isn't a noticeable sign so do look at photos to find the place.\n\nI had been anxiously waiting for this place to open and only just been able to dine here on 6/23/2016. I was saving this restaurant (and my milestone review) for our anniversary dinner. Reservations are booked very quickly (they are currently booked 2 months out). I was in contact with one of the partners, Tan Truong, in booking my reservation. Unfortunately, there were a few snafus as my reservation got lost, and we ended up having to come in another day after Tan \"moved some things around\" in order to accommodate my only other day available that week since we had travel plans.\n\nChef Stephen was our sushi chef for the evening. He's fairly young (early 20s) and came to the US from KR to become a sushi chef. Chef Stephen is more on the quiet side compared to Chef Geoff (chef owner) who was adjacent to us (we could hear Chef Geoff's more in-depth details about each dish which was very informative). Absolutely loved watching the chefs put each dish together. Two things of note that weren't my favorite about the meal was the rice and the seasoning of the nigiri. Chef Stephen explained that the short grain rice (from Sacramento) is seasoned with red wine vinegar for more flavor. This is not the typical way of seasoning of sushi rice but Chef Geoff's twist which is a bit too much for the delicate fish for me (same with all the sauces to season the nigiri). Maybe the chef was a little heavy-handed (or my taste buds too sensitive) but the sauces were too overpowering and didn't allow me to appreciate the freshness of all the variety of fish. My favorites were probably the supplements so I highly recommend.\n\nService was on point. Napkins folded when someone went to the restroom. Plates quickly cleared when dishes were finished. Great date night place but not a must-return place for me. I'd prefer a more traditional style.", "author": "Kitty K."}

To begin with, making a reservation for a weekend evening was no mean feat- usually none is available, and you have to be on a waiting list through Resy, and then you get an email stating there may be slots available on certain other days. Eventually we were able to make a reservation for a night we could make, guaranteed with a credit card.  So wife and I arrive at 6 PM as they open, and are seated promptly at one corner of an L-shaped sushi counter that had 14 seats- curious because Ju-Ni in Japanese means 12.  The menu has one choice - a 14 course omakase at $145, with optional \"extension\" of wagyu beef or Uni for $35.  There is a two-page beverage list, sake occupying one page and a rather limited selection of beer (only 3 choices) and wine on the other.  Behind the sushi counter were three sushi chefs.  We were on the short arm of the L with four seats.  Behind the long arm of the L were 2 Asian chefs, behind our short arm was a younger Caucasian chef, who was rather chatty and giggly.  We were first served a small salad of some greens and couscous, which was tasty but not particularly notable.  This was followed, at a very leisurely pace, with some 14 servings of sushi.  The sushi was almost all with fish topping, and while some were excellent (e.g., the Unagi freshly cooked), most were merely good and tended to lack the kind of creativity and surprise that one might expect in truly great omakase restaurants such as Kusakabe.  Our chef was busy cutting various fish while we were being served the first course salad, and all the sushi he made was with the pre-cut fish, which he made into the sushi morsels rather painstakingly, but lacking the kind of expertise of hand movement expected of great sushi chefs.  He also made all four sushi morsels and served them to each guest in front of him, rather than making two at a time and serving them fresh, as one would have expected in other outstanding omakase counters.  This may sound rather trivial, but attention to such detail distinguishes truly great establishments from the ordinary.  At the end, there were a couple of desserts including a sweet omelet and an ice cream, which were good.  The service was attentive, though the two waitresses often seemed to be engrossed in conversation with each other.   With only 14 seats, the ambiance was quite noisy, perhaps because of the lack of any noise-absorbing surface.  Overall, the food was good but rather boring. I wished, at about half way, that the course would be over- which almost never happened before. There are quite a few omakase restaurants in San Francisco, regardless of price, that are much more creative and exciting than Ju-Ni.", "author": "Hoyle L."}

I think that there is much better Omakase to be had in SF.\n\nThe space/restaurant itself is lovely, very modern and clean, and set up so that there are only 2-6 diners per sushi chef. This set up should encourage a personalized experience between diners and sushi chef. Unfortunately that was not the case for myself, or the couple sitting near us. I mean, our sushi chef was fine, he was polite. But he was not personable or friendly, he wasn't able to answer questions about the food and ingredients that diners had, and did not describe each of the nigiri dishes at all. I learned what we were eating from overhearing one of the other sushi chefs, who was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.\n\nThe Omakase was a salad + 12 pieces of nigiri + a palate cleanser + soup + granita. I thought that for the price, the quantity and preparation of dishes, an experience overall was not enough.

Sushi rice was made well. I'd say on total par with my favorite, kusakabe, but kusakabe beats them hands down in the hot foods items-- you can tell why they have a michelin star. Ju ni's highlights were cuts of fish paired by more contemporary toppings whether it be ginger, lime, miso or what have you on certain cuts of fish. The $90 omakase is good enough although I was worried at first we were going to be hungry based on the reviews- the nigiri is medium to smaller size. We got the supplement which gave us the chu toro, shiryaki unagi with gold flakes, and hokkaido uni. The chef was engaging, although quite young, in speaking to him and listening to the others over the course of the 2.5 hour dinner, they all trained at sushi ran and came over here. I'd say they are all about in their early 30s.\n\nOverall I think kusakabe's $90 omakase still gives the best value in terms of presentation, artistry, flavors, hot foods, --we didnt need to supplement there, but Ju-ni is more contemporary and noveau.

The first time I was getting over a cold and my tastebuds hadn't come back all the way (so annoying!) but I knew it was good enough to go back. So glad I did because with the tastebuds intact the place was amazing. So much so that I made several more reservations for future visits and when I couldn't make one they were super flexible in cancelling despite it was within their cancellation policy which i really appreciated and which will keep me coming back. Can't wait til the next visit!", "author": "Kay R."}

First time, I felt this place is good, but a bit expensive because the fish was cut very thin, I still felt a bit hungry after 12 pieces and had to order 4-5 orders more (one of them is a handroll). I left the restaurant with some room in my stomach. Second time, I went there and had Geoffrey as my chef. Things got better. Fish was cut in good amount. He explained the technique applied to each fish. This time I felt almost full at the end of 12 pieces, but I ordered more to try more special fishes (no roll this time). Everything was perfect. I left the restaurant with two reservations in next two months :)", "author": "Aniwat A."}

The first few courses started off in a good direction and then it all went down hill. Half of the courses were just brushed with ponzu and/or soy and lemon, leaving a one note taste in my mouth for the majority of the meal. The salmon roe with ankimo and the oyster were both really tasty, but not enough to make up for the other 10 courses. We even added the supplement (in which the chef said was a better deal then getting a la carte) which in reality is only a 50 cent difference. I did not feel like it was an open forum with the chef to ask questions and discuss the dishes, he didn't really speak much to us and was rather chatting with the industry people he know who were also sitting at our table. He had also mentioned that with a lot of their dishes, they're trying to make things palatable to the average american...IMHO, the average american isn't going to come here and I'm coming with an open palate and expecting to have an experience unlike anything else. Sure, I usually despise salmon roe and yes, by curing it you make it more palatable for my tastebuds...but rather than saying you're making it approachable to white people, it should be more about enhancing the flavor and celebrating the ingredient to it's fullest. It's a shame because being a chef as well I had a lot of feedback but didn't feel welcome to give it. Aside from the food and our overall experience, the decor really had me bugging. If I'm paying a $300 tab, I expect the bathrooms to be pristine and cohesive with the rest of the space, rather than having a thrift store dresser with framed warriors hats and an homage to ikea with the mirror situation. The framed art on the walls does not go with the rest of the interior, as well as the pinterest project air plants that literally look hot glued to the walls. Am I being nit picky? Yes. But under the circumstances my standards were/are pretty high. Overall, ju-ni is not worth the wait, the hype, or the price tag. We expected to drop a couple hundred bucks, yes, but hoping it would be worth it. In this case, it was not. Shout out the hostess though who literally has the more boring job there. Also, a granita for dessert is a total cop out.", "author": "Shane M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-06-15", "description": "Overpriced. Tiny small pieces. Brushed with ponzu sauce on every piece which causes nearly half the pieces to taste the same, erasing the flavor and character of the fish.  One would imagine at the end of a 12 course tasting meal you would receive a piece of Uni.  Of course not here. Instead a la carte menu is given and 1 tiny piece of Uni is priced at $12 additional dollars. That's after a $90 tasting menu which is the only option!  Two people, $250 for maybe 4 ounces of fish per person.", "author": "Jamie K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-06", "description": "Food absolutely fresh, creative and delicious. Some of the best I've had in San Francisco. BUT, for an $800 bill (4 people), I expect the chef to pay attention as we leave the restaurant, to thank us heartily, to welcome us back, to treat us with dignity and respect.... Instead, he was busy looking at the schedule for the next day, checking his invoices, whatever else he was doing I don't know, but he barely looked up as we departed. Not OK, and I will not go back. Food was great, but for the prices paid, I'll definitely go elsewhere where I can also get great food and better, more appreciative customer service. Really too bad.", "author": "Ginger K."}

This is one of those places that you save for special occasions, it requires far in advance reservations and is definitely pricey.  But the sushi was incredible.  This restaurant is strictly for sushi lovers, not people who just like Japanese food aka rolls, ramen, etc.  This is just nigiri.  The omakase menu varies by the day but we had amazing salmon, salmon roe with shaved monkfish liver (I loved this surprisingly), lovely mackerel, crab, etc.  The chef explains each piece of sushi and guides you on how to eat it.  The service was impeccable, very attentive and friendly.  Even before we were served any food the sushi chef noticed I was left handed, so when he placed the crab dish in a spoon, he placed it for me so it was facing left, not right.  A nice touch!  I would definitely go back here with one of my sushi loving friends for impeccably fresh fish.  I found that I was fairly full by the end of the 12 course, so we only ordered 1 other item from the supplement.  But you can easily go crazy here and order extras after you finish the omakase.  I agree with another Yelper that the pear dessert was lacking, I'd rather have something chocolate based or more substantial.  But that is my only complaint.  Parking here does suck, so plan ahead or take public transportation if you can.", "author": "Julie P."}

Ok so I'll start out with our chef, Steve San, who was unbelievably awesome. He was friendly and literally explained the sushi every time we asked him a question about it. His delicate touch on the fish shows how much he cares about his craft. The two lady's sitting next to us were chatting so he kinda let them do their thing and then focused more on us (but those ladies still left with an amazing experience). The concept is also really well thought out. JU-ni means 12 in Japanese, so it was a 12 course menu with 3 chefs handling 4 people at a time. It made it more intimate to have a dedicated chef, the relationship with the sushi was powerful yet amazing. I don't wanna go on for too long but it was an amazing experience, EVERYONE should have a taste of their amazing selection. OH ALSO, the fish is brought over night from Japan, and the UNI IS AMAZING. Thank you chef Steve for one the best meals ever!!", "author": "Billy H."}

Our sushi chef, Patrick, was friendly, knowledgeable, and expertly skilled; his attention to detail on every piece of nigiri was exceptional. As someone who has tried nearly every sushi restaurant in the Bay Area--and been disappointed by the quality of fish (and service) at many, including some of the most highly rated establishments--we were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of fish, service, and dining at Ju-Ni. Every piece on our omakase menu was carefully prepared, curated, and presented; and the taste unique, fresh, and bursting with flavor. The restaurant certainly deserved its Michelin Star and, in my opinion, was well worth the relatively hefty price. Highly, highly recommended if you're a true sushi aficionado (who seeks the highest quality, Japanese-imported fish) like myself.", "author": "Justin L."}
