She was very clearly unhappy with us. They only let you order 6 at a time. \n\nWe ended up ordering more food anyway but the service throughout the night was mediocre. I had to ask for water multiple times. We were rushed to leave at the end. I thought she had asked us if we wanted more water but instead she said \"we need the table. But take your time\" and never brought any water. I hate this server! She did not deserve any tip but of course we still tipped the full amount on an already overpriced meal. \n\nFood wise, it's very mediocre for high prices, presented very instagrammable but tastes average. I won't be back and won't recommend it to others.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-10-08", "description": "True rating: 4.5\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. This is a semi-fancy restaurant. The pictures on Yelp didn't make it seem like that but once you walk in and look at the prices, it's not your everyday restaurant.\n\n2. It was very lively when I went for a late Friday dinner at 8:15pm. The place was basically packed. There were a few birthday dinners, a few rowdy people in dress shirts, a few family, but mostly young professionals. It's a fun environment if you don't mind the noise.\n\n3. It's really loud in here. I wouldn't recommend it for a first date because you have to shout for the other person on the other side of the table to hear you. And they ring this loud bell when it's someone's birthday. It's probably not that bad but I was sitting right underneath it so I heard it loud and clear. \n\n4. The service is a little odd. It's mostly waitress with sleeve-less shirts and statement earrings. You kind of get a Las Vegas vibe from the waitresses. They were kind and smily but it didn't feel personal. They seemed to just want to get the job done. I asked for recommendation and they basically pointed at the most expensive dishes on the menu. I'm not sure if that's because those were their specialties or not, but it felt like it was a routine the waitresses did from the customer perspective.  \n\n5. There is Yelp reservations! Use it because you probably need a reservation on a busy weekend.\n\n6. The interior is nice. It has dim lights to match the dark colors. I personally was a fan of the decorations and environment. \n\n7. The prices are on the pricy side. I got the Ka-Pow Lamb that was recommend for $26, the 'fresh coconut' drink for $8 and the Mark Mango (mango sticky rice) for $13. Prices are around $18 - $25 per dish\n\n8. The food is good. The fresh coconut drink was nice and would recommend it if you don't mind spending the money for it. It comes in the coconut with a flower. The lamb was a bit too salty for my taste but it comes with white rice with some toned rice on top which helped balance it out. I'm not sure if I would get that again though. The mango ice with sticky rice was meh. I love shaved ice and have tried many shaved ice desserts and this was below average. But my friend really enjoyed the sticky rice.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this to a friend if they are looking for a nice Thai restaurant. It's fancier than a regular restaurant so maybe save it for a special occasion and not be like me who was feeling Thai food and went to the closest Thai place near my place in jeans and a t-shirt. The food is pretty good, service is alright, and the atmosphere is fun.", "author": "Shin L."}

On the side note, all the food is on a big, tall platter. I was barely able to see my friends face! \n\nService was mediocre. Thai tea was bomb. Would I come back?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-06", "description": "I have been here twice, so I will be reviewing both times I went. The first was with a couple of friends (Friday at 8:45pm) and the second was with my mom (Friday at 6pm). Both times, I had created reservations the day of. The restaurant is sleek and classy, but seating is definitely close together and the lighting is pretty dark inside. \n\nThe first time with my friends, we started off ordering several drinks. I ordered the Lao Soda ($13)- with lime vodka and watermelon. This was super good, it wasn't too sweet and was balanced nicely with the lime flavor. My friend ordered the Lao beer ($7) and the other ordered a Mai-Thai ($13)- which was really good, sweeter than mine but still not overly sweet.\n\nFor food we split the Lamb Zeen Beef Lettuce Wrap ($17.95) -made not spicy with minced beef flank steak lettuce wrap, toasted rice powder, and basil/mint. It was good portion, but the flavors did not seem all there for me (maybe it's because we said no spice). \n\nWe also got the Khaw Kai noodles ($16.95) which came with thick rice noodles (so soft and good), chicken, peanuts, and a soy sauce with lettuce. The noodles were very flavorful, but I did not think there was enough of them and I wish there was more veggies in this dish. It is a small portion for what the price was. \n\nLastly, we got the Lao Fried Rice ($18.95) which came with a fried egg and chicken wings which was a pretty good sized portion. It was a bit spicy and kind of plain other than the toppings listed above. Not the most favorited dish. \n\n\n\nOn my second occasion, the food we got the Wrapping Vegetable Crispy Rolls ($13.95) that came with lettuce, basil/mint, and glass noodles on the side along with spring rolls with shiitake mushroom. It also came with a sauce that was supposed to be sweet/sour but was spicy. These were really good and crispy. I liked how they gave big pieces of lettuce and noodles to eat them with. \n\nWe also got the Fresh Spring Rolls in the vegetarian version- which is with tofu instead of pork sausage ($13.95). A waitress was coming around with a cart of dishes that were $6 each and were 1/2 the portion of the the normal size, so we actually had got the fresh spring rolls in the regular meat version as well. My mom and I preferred the tofu version.\nWe both really enjoyed the peanut sauce, but thought that the rice paper wrap was way too thick for the rolls.\n\nWe ordered the mini lao fried rice with a chicken wing from the waitress going around with the cart ($6), and it was nothing special and a bit spicy (though probably not spicy for people who like spicy food, I just can't handle it personally). \n\nWe also got the calamari from the happy hour menu and it was perfectly crisp and tender on the inside. To drink we split a Thai iced tea ($7) that came in this really pretty large round cup- it was very refreshing, but maybe a bit too much ice.\n\nFor dessert we got the Cha Yen Thai Tea Jumbo Icy ($19), which reminded me of halo halo. There was jackfruit, blackberries, grass jelly, strawberries, and some other toppings over Thai ice tea that they pour on top of the ice in front of you. It was really good, my issue was that some of the ice was so frozen so you couldn't scoop it easily as you would with shaved ice. \n\nOverall, both experiences were good, but a bit overpriced for the portion sizes.", "author": "April L."}

Service = what service?\n\nOur work group of 4 came here for lunch, with a reservations. I was really giddy looking over the menu, because everything sounded so fantastic. I tried to choose things that I thought would help me stay awake and alert (or at least appear to be functioning) for the rest of the workday, so I paired the grilled calamari appetizer with a side of papaya salad. The papaya salad was still a large serving for a side, enough to share with the table for sure. It was crisp and a little salty and sweet, but it could have used some more heat. The grilled calamari was stunning - the whole squid was beautifully presented on a board with live flowers. It could have been more tender but I really enjoyed it with the dipping sauce. \n\nBut yeah, it took a while to order, and we sat around with empty water glasses for a while. One of our entrees never arrived, and our server never came back to check on us. When we finally flagged her down, she didn't really give a damn about the missing entree.

On my second day in the city we had reservations at Lao Table for lunch and I heard such amazing things, I was pumped. There were four of us and it was a great opportunity to enjoy some new grub while getting to know new coworkers/friends. When we arrived we were seated right away and handed menus to look over. They must have thought their menu was a novel because it was a while before someone came and took our order. Knowing that they have a lunch rush throughout the week, I assumed they would be adequately staffed. Woof! \n\nDespite the wait, I was pleased that they had some vegetarian options and I ended up ordering the basil rice bowl, vegetarian version of course. This meant that it came with tofu instead of chicken. As everyone's food started to come out, my stomach started rumbling. My dish ended up being the missing one from the table so I must have pulled the short stick. We asked our server (and even other servers) where my food was at several times. I was pretty bummed that there was no sense of urgency or even an apology from the staff. It was obvious that I was forgotten about and a simple \"I'm sorry\" would have left me feeling better about the situation. After being there almost an hour, I requested my food to be made to go so I could enjoy it later in the office. It had already been paid for or else I would have said forget about it. \n\nThank goodness I was able to munch on the crispy vegetable rolls that we shared at the table. These were really tasty and everyone at the table enjoyed them. Later on when I was able to eat my lunch, I was happy with the amount of flavor in the basil rice.

I'd like to think that my experience was an outlier and that this doesn't happen too often. Pro Tip - Make reservations for lunch outside of the 12-1PM time slot so they aren't as swamped.

It was a Friday night, after all. \nOur table wasn't ready when checked in, so we grabbed a couple of drinks at the bar.  My husband had bourbon and I tried the Millionaire's Pineapple drink.  Both drinks were good and before we knew it, our table was ready. \n\nWe ordered the tuna tartare, crab curry and basil chicken.  The tuna tartare had a spicy kick to it and it was perfect!  I usually get basil chicken if I see it on the menu and their basil chicken is comparable to Osha Thai's.  For dessert, we had the shaved ice with fruit.  The food was good and the presentation was beautiful.  Pricing was a bit steep so that's the only thing that's stopping me from returning.

On top of that, there was some major construction going on right outside blocking a few lanes of traffic. \n\nFood quality is good and on par with other Thai places in the city. They have a pretty extensive menu. The presentation of the food here is definitely a plus here and what probably makes them stand out. Some of our dishes, including my friend's Duck Pho, came out on its own presentation tray and was very \"instagram worthy\". I would definitely come back to eat here but a few stars knocked off due to the price in ratio to quantity (although it IS downtown and SF) and the customer service.

Yes, you'll be charged a ton (like holy moly $7 for a thai iced tea), but when you see the way it is served to you on the fancy platters, you'll kind of understand why.  \n\nFor appetizers, I liked the chicken satay with peanut sauce.  The spring rolls were alright.  For lunch, I had the Khaw Khai noodles, which was tasty.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but I wish there were more noodles and less chicken though.  Also shared the Khao Nar Ped (duck rice), which I would recommend as well.  Thai iced tea was presented in such an elaborate and memorable way that it made me almost forgive the $7 charge.  From a taste perspective, it was a bit too sweet for my liking.\n\nService wasn't horrible, but it definitely could be improved upon.  Also highly suggest getting a reservation.  We were a big group (about 15) with a reservation and even then we had to wait a little for our table.  Also, it looked like more than half the restaurant had a reservation sign on the tables anyway.  I guess another room for improvement is that they really should've kept track of who ordered what rather than bringing the food and forcing everyone to sort out who has what.  I think it's fair to have that expectation when the food is this expensive.  \n\nOverall, I wouldn't have an issue with coming back here if it was for a special occasion.

Since we had a reservation and were able to walk right in and get a table, we assumed it'd be a smooth process. Nope. These servers are terrible. Like so terrible it has to be on purpose. Like aggressively terrible. They took forever to take our order. They didn't seem to understand that the glasses on the table were meant to contain water.

I definitely won't be coming back.\n\nBut hey! The food was so good, and the presentation is gorgeous! We split the Wrapping Vegetable Crispy Rolls (otherwise known as egg rolls?) and they were a perfect start to the meal. For an entree I had the Totally Prawns curry. OMG delicious, a red coconut curry with pineapple and lychee to add some sweet. Just a hint of spice. I loved it! My dining partner got the calamari, which was prepared an presented in a way I'd never before seen! A whole squid split and chargrilled, it was something I'd definitely want to order again. If I were to ever come back. Which I won't.\n\nPS - their pride campaign is really disappointing. Simply a photo of one of their servers shirtless, with \"$1 oysters\" typed over it.

Everything was delicious and we were definitely full after sharing these 3 dishes. We decided to peek at the dessert menu and couldn't resist the coconut sticky rice option. It was a coconut filled with coconut ice cream (with chunks of coconut) and 2 chunks of sticky rice wrapped and steamed in banana leaf. \n\nOverall, this was definitely one of the best more memorable meals we've had in a while. $100+ for 2 people with drinks.

It's amongst my top 3 favorite Lao restaurants in the world outside of Laos (Lao Cafe in London and Khe-yo in NYC are my other two favorites).\n\nAll the dishes have unique, distinct flavors. My favorite item on the menu was the fish garden. It comes with a deep fried fish, cucumber salad with all the yummy fishy sauce, the absolute BEST beef jerky ever, chicken skewers, sticky rice wrapped in banana leaves, noodles and an herb salad. Although it was $70 for this dish, we shared it amongst a group of 6 people -- definitely meant to be shared.\n\nFor smaller dishes/smaller parties, I'd high recommend the Crispy Sticky Rice Salad (traditionally called Nam Kao). The crispy fried rice is prepared with fermented pork. There is abundance of greens/herbs so make it into a lettuce wrap and eat with your hands.\n\nThe Zeen Ping (hanger steak) is also highly recommended. It was tender and cooked to perfection. It comes with a chili lime dipping sauce which is very authentic -- although I'd like it to be spicier.\n\nThe service is also impeccable.

They do have Happy Hour specials so take advantage of those if you want.\n\nI was super hungry so I started off with the garlic chicken wings off the Happy Hour menu (this menu is not up on their website). I love my garlic so fried garlic on top of crispy wings that are hot and fresh was delish! I gobbled these up in no time.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Suae Hong Hai (Crying Tiger Steak). This comes with a side of sticky rice and dipping sauce called Jaow. The meat was so tender and so buttery and so worth the $34.95 for the dish. The sticky rice was a bit mushy for my taste but still good. I ordered a side of Papaya Salad with medium spice to go with it and it reminded me of my MIL's for sure. The right amount of sour and sweet and it was hard to stop eating.\n\nI didn't stop there, like I said, I was super hungry!  I ordered the mango shaved ice with a thai tea. It was a great sweet ending to the meal. Good thing I walked because I needed the 10 minute walk back to my hotel to help me digest!\n\nWhen I left about an hour later, the restaurant was packed and for good reason. Good drinks and food make this place a legit Lao style restaurant. A definite must stop if you want to try a new kind of place. I recommend asking about the authentic Lao dishes to try. There are some regular dishes like the fried rice that I'd probably stay away from and stick with the authentic dishes because you will for sure be in for a happy surprise.", "author": "Aimee N."}

I mean, how could a salad take so much longer to make? (I wonder if they had simply forgotten it. It took about 5 minutes after we flagged down a server.)\n\nI could forgive this had the food been fantastic... but it was only decent.

The Miang Pla blew us both away, it was so simple, yet so impressive at the same time. I cannot stress how much, that if you do visit you need to do the Miang Pla. \n\nI've never been a huge fan of ordering lettuce wraps at a restaurant, they seem so boring and overpriced for what they are.

It wasn't the Americanized lettuce wraps you get at chains that are over sauced, but rather these rely on fresh herbs and textures with a little sauce. \n\nI could eat Miang Pla all day long!

I'm not one to speak for how traditionally prepared the food is but it did satisfy my Asian taste buds.\n\nThis place is decorated nicely like a nice romantic dinner spot. It's really spacious, theres sky high ceilings and plenty of tables for walk in. They have reservations on Yelp if you want to book a table though.\n\nThe server greeted us with lemongrass towels that are water activated, which was a nice touch. They were really attentive, so that was great considering a lot of Thai restaurants I go to are really slow. Food came out lightning fast and I wonder how they pulled that off.\n\nIf you're willing to foot a $20-25+ for a Laotian/Thai entree, want nice ambiance and want to treat yourself to something nice this is a good spot. There's salads, soups, wok dishes, noodles, rice dishes, curries and grilled/steamed options to choose from. They have vegetarian options! The grilled/steamed section is $30+ so I avoided that section. It was fairly easy to stick to something under $25.\n\nPortions are generous and they come in big family style bowls. The noodles can easily be shared between two people from the looks of it. \n\nMixed Vegetables - Wok fried farmer market vegetable + tofu + mushroom w/oyster sauce. For such a simple dish, they really did a good job with this! The sauce was light and had great flavor. The veggies were fresh and crunchy! There was a lot to go around. It comes with jasmine rice which comes in a small bowl which is the perfect size for me. The ratio of veggies and tofu to rice was ideal. I get this dish at many Thai places and this one particularly stood out to me which is a good sign. It ran for $14 on the menu so this is one of the more affordable and healthier options.\n\nI tried some of the Totally Prawns curry and was very pleased with how it tasted! The curry is rich in flavor and the prawns looked very large and juicy.\n\nFor Asian food, this is generally an expensive spot to go to and not a place I would frequent.

First off, the interior design is beautiful! We were greeted promptly at the host station, but after that - it was down hill from there. \n\nAfter we were asked how many people were in our lunch group, we were seated shortly afterwards, but NO ONE came to check on us. My friend asked twice if we had a server and when another employee asked our server to come see us, he rolled his eyes at them. Our server barely greeted us or asked us if we had any questions or anything. This was our first time at a Laos restaurant, and having a server informing us about the menu would have been nice.\n\nWhen our food came out, it was brought to us by someone else besides our server, and not once did anyone come to check on us. Luckily, the food was good, but in my opinion - extremely overpriced.\n\nThe bill was about $75 for one entree, a beer, and two appetizers. Also, I ordered the cup of Tom yum soup but their server put in the bowl (cup is $8 and bowl is $19). I didn't realize what I got was the bowl until after I saw the bill. I didn't realize what I received was the bowl because it seemed pretty small. But I didn't complain since we finished it all. \n\nNeedless to say, I don't think I'd ever come here again nor would I recommend this place. Yes, the food is good, but not worth the price. Any mediocre Thai restaurant would suffice for a fraction of the price.\n\nThis was also a disappointing experience considering this was the very first place we visited during our San Francisco trip. :(\n\nI'm giving this place a two star for the horrible service and pricey food.

The location is very accessible from Montgomery BART station - about five minutes walk. Decor is nice and is fairly crowded but not to the extent that you would give up waiting right away. If you come in a larger group, better reserve with Yelp first. \n\nThe food is beautifully presented and delicious. I am not sure how much percent is really authentic Laotian food but the food definitely stands out from other mediocre Thai restaurants. The calamari is tender and flavorful. Pork neck salad is spiceful and pork neck is super tender, full of umami and juicy. The duck rice is decent - though the portion is a little bit small and it doesn't come with many pieces of duck meat. The highlight is definitely the dessert - coconut ice cream in a young coconut with banana leaf wrapped sweet sticky rice. The hot sweet sticky rice blends so well with the cold and refreshing coconut ice cream - perfect combination. The portion HUGE with the entire coconut stuffed with rich ice cream. Don't forget to scrap the wall of the young coconut to get the tender coconut meat. The light but refreshing taste of it balances perfectly with the sweet sticky rice and the ice cream. The dessert itself definitely bumped the overall rating fr 3.5 to 4.\n\nThe service is also decent and responsive and servers are all very nice and considerate. Definitely will come back for another meal if I'm in the area!", "author": "Shen Q."}

Perhaps it was because there are so many amazing Thai restaurants in SF. Or because there are so many amazing eateries just in the SoMa district alone. Or maybe it was just an off day for me. Whatever the case, it was a good meal and one I enjoyed, but not the best when I consider all that stiff competition. \n\nI'll second many a previous reviewer by saying the place is beautiful inside. If there is one thing they have going better than any other Thai place I've been to, it's a sense of classy ambiance. When it came to the food, however, I was left wanting more. The calamari was literally a whole squid chopped up. While that may be exactly how it is supposed to be served (as opposed to the Americanized, deep-fried beyond recognition version) it didn't do much for me in the flavor department. I also couldn't help but long for many a previous Pho experience while eating their version. It lacked most of the fresh veggie sides I've grown accustomed to elsewhere and was served a little less hot than I would have liked. \n\nAgain, nothing was bad here and I'm sure I'll return for another meal. It's a nice atmosphere for food or drinks.", "author": "Alex L."}

I've never had Laotian food before so I don't have a base line to compare it to. \n\nI dined here with my friend who was vegetarian, so we were limited as to what we could order to share, however I was pleasantly surprised by the menu that specified dishes that had a 'vegetarian option' available. This was helpful for us to easily identify what we could order without having to read through the ingredients in each item. \n\nWe ordered the spring rolls (vegetarian style) to share and it came with tofu as the substitute.The outside layer of the spring roll was a bit thicker than your average spring roll wrapper - it tasted more like a rice noodle wrapper. Still good, but a bit thick if you're trying to cut back on carbs like me. \n\nI also ordered the papaya salad. I love the freshness of ripe papaya salad, however it was so incredibly spicy, I could not even eat my dish. The small salad came on a large plate with a side of noodles, lettuce wraps, 1 spring roll and fried roll cut in halves. Its hard to rate this dish since I could barely eat the actual papaya salad, but it did look fresh. If you do order this dish, ask for them to hold the spice unless you can handle the heat. \n\nOverall the service was good, and the ambiance is nice.

I wish I took more photos of the dishes at my table... but trust, it all looked colorful, fresh, and too good to eat.\n+ Excellent, friendly, fast service.\n+ The interior has a modern, chill vibe.\n+ The most beautiful bathrooms I've ever seen. That's a weird thing to say about a bathroom, right? With sleek fixtures and awesome floor-to-ceiling Thai (?) murals, you are a little surprised when you enter. It was confusing but pretty great.\n+ Thai Iced Tea! Hooray. It was delicious. Shoutout to my colleagues/friends for encouraging me to try this.\n\nI loved me some Lao and my tummy left feeling very happy with my pho. The broth was flavorful, the portion was super generous, and the meat was juicy and tender. You know your pho is good when you are full but just want to keep sipping the broth uncontrollably.

A couple minutes later a huge party of 7 and then a party of 6 came strolling in, and I could tell the hostess was feeling stressed about seating space. A minute or so later, a woman walked in asking how long the wait would be for a party of 2 and the hostess said that unless she had a reservation, Lao Table will not be taking any more walk-ins for the day (...can she do that?). I started to worry if I was even allowed to eat here at this point, because (like the woman) I was also a party of 2 and had no reservation - the only difference was that I walked in 5 minutes earlier than she did.\n\nMy friend arrived shortly after and I tapped the hostess that we're ready. I could tell she was hesitant about seating us (really lady? With the reservation crap?), but she begrudgingly led us to the bar with two open stools.

While the food wasn't bad, it wasn't at all worth the exorbitant prices, and I wouldn't be in a rush to return.\n\nThe crispy sticky rice salad was definitely the best dish I tried--the rice had an amazing crispy texture and was accompanied by a slightly sour fermented pork sausage. It was also served with plenty of veggies and herbs on the side, which really balanced out the dish! The om chicken curry was served in a clear curry broth and had a ton of herbal flavor, delicious veggies, and a spicy kick. However, the white meat chicken in the curry was quite boring, and the dish was missing finesse and a balance of flavors. The \"pad mee\" prawn stir-fried noodles came in a generous portion and was served with bean sprouts, peanuts, and ground chilies on the side. However, the noodles were a little on the sweet side (similar flavors to an Americanized Pad Thai) and quite boring overall. Not at all worth the almost $20 price tag.\n\nWhile the space here is nicely decorated and the service good, the food could use some improvement, especially given the high price points.

We couldn't tell who was a busser or server. Just really disorganized and quite possibly a lack of team communication on their end. \n\nWe ordered everything I know, and I know about how it should taste. I would say it's pretty authentic. \n\nNam khao- coconut rice ball fried, then broken into fried rice mixture with scallions, cured pork sausage and pork skin. Extra spicy and delicious! \n\nBamboo salad- 9$ not as finely shaved as my grandma did hers, but the flavor was spot on and of course spicy as all hell. \n\nPapaya salad- 20$ yummy, fermented goodness, I was just thrown off by all the actual crab shells they left in the papaya because I kept almost cutting myself with those sharp shells. \n\nKhaw khai- 21$ chow fun (wide flat rice noodles) saut\u00e9ed with egg and chicken, similar to pad Thai. Pretty good. \n\nOur server didn't want to offer us dessert so we had to just ask for it when she presented the bill. \n\nOur bill ended up being 135$ after everything, which is steep for 3rd world country food.

Clearly, this is run by a corporate/restaurant group so I'm just surprised to see such spotty service.

The place looks a lot like the Osha Thai it was before with its dark clubby lighting and crowded-together tables. That's because co-owners Lalita Souksamlane and Wassana Korkhieola smartly stick with a successful marketing formula since Osha Thai is the Thai restaurant chain its competitors try to mimic often with lackluster results. Souksamlane takes charge here as she was raised in a Thai town that bordered Laos, and the cuisine crosses that border with relative ease.\n\nWhere the restaurant went south was the often ridiculously slow service that dragged out our meal there unnecessarily. We were seated between two incessantly verbal parties of four, so Jamie and I were being constantly tortured by their vacuous comments. In the midst of this stereophonic symphony of inanity, we managed to order the $22.95 Khao Nar Ped which provided slices of honey-roasted duck, a hard-boiled egg, and cucumber with a honey soy sauce, all over jasmine rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2qeRu18). A bit pricey for a relatively simple dish, but duck is duck so who's complaining?\n\nOur next dish was the $16.95 \"Khaw Kai\" Noodles, which was a hearty bowl of thick rice noodles mixed with chicken pieces, chopped peanuts, scallions, bean sprouts, and caramel soy sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2qJIh4o). It was good journeyman eats that makes up in flavor what it lacks in creativity. It was probably about five minutes between the first two dishes, but the third dish came over half an hour later. The seemingly straightforward $14 Mixed Vegetables were mixed in a wok with deep-fried tofu and mushroom in an oyster sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2q5yQxC), but its journey from the kitchen to our table was an interminable one.\n\nIt was like watching Shelley Winters in \"The Poseidon Adventure\" as you keep waiting for her to die because somehow you know the fat lady can't survive all that breathless swimming to save Gene Hackman from certain death. We were also waiting for the fat lady to die by the time the vegetables arrived along with a bowl of rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2qbYc92). You would think we'd be ready to leave, but I really wanted us to share the $18 Mark Som & Mark Wan, an elaborate bowl of exotic Southeast Asian fruit on ice topped by macarons, a fruity sorbet and gelatin (photo: http://bit.ly/2rbMqzH). I saw it go by to another table, and I felt we deserved one, a lovely end note to a somewhat erratic evening.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...mostly more than decent Laotian dishes with the topper being that fruit bowl\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...I loathe the table set-up which pushes tables together as if we were unwilling participants in a communal meal\nSERVICE - 2 stars...nice enough when the servers came, but their visits to our table were few and far between\nTOTAL - 3 stars...snail's-pace service and crowded tables torpedoed a promising evening", "author": "Ed U."}

I'd that there was a connection between Lao Table and Osha but that did not make any sense since Osha serves Thai food and Lao advertises as a Laotian option. Then I did what any information junkie would do and googled it. Here is the scoop. Executive Chef and owner Lalita Souksamlane who grew up on the border of Thailand and Laos decided to introduce the food that she grew up eating in this venue.\n\nGranted that in my first and only visit I did not try more than an appetizer a main dish, still I was very pleased with the pleasant flavors that I got to taste. So while I am not well educated on the distinctions between the two country's cuisines and the borderland cuisine's specifics, \"frankly my dear, I don't give a damn\" because it all tastes so good!\n\nThe servers are very good at what they do and the space is beautiful.

The restaurant interior was clean and spacious, and the service was average in terms of friendliness and speed.\n\nI ordered a Basil Chicken Rice Bowl for $16.95 (!!!), which consisted of wok-fried chicken, chili garlic, holy (?!) basil, and jasmine rice with a fried egg on top. The bowl tasted really good, and although the chicken was a bit too spicy for me, it was flavorful and tasty. The quantity was good for lunch, but both the quality and quantity combined was not worth the expensive price.\n\nWe asked them if we could split the bill 6 ways for our group, and they told us at first that they couldn't, then changed their minds and agreed to do it. I appreciated this; however, it took them a good 15 minutes to bring the 6 bills to us. They also charged us automatic gratuity for our group of 7, which I did not appreciate and believe has never earned a restaurant a higher rating.\n\nNOTE: At least I learned that holy basil is a real thing while writing this review.", "author": "George L."}

The guests sitting at the next table seemed like they were on one. The wait staff was super friendly too.\n\nI decided to start with the Pad Mee Prawns. I particularly liked the presentation, with garnishes on the side and a flower with the bean sprouts. The dish was savory and flavorful, reminiscent of pad thai. The second dish that I ordered was the Kha Moo German, which is a crispy skin pork knuckle. I didn't like this dish as much as I thought that the amount of protein that you get was limited. It was mostly bone and fat. The crispiness on the skin was tasty, though. For the price, it was not worth it.

We were slightly nervous when we saw that the place was only half-full. It was a Friday night and just about everywhere else was PACKED. Still, the yelp reviews were good and we had a reservation (super easy to make through yelp- we made ours 10 min before walking there), so in we went.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the atmosphere- it was classy without being stuffy, and had mood-setting lighting without getting too dark.\n\nThe staff were super attentive, walking around to refill water often, and ask if we needed anything. \n\nBut the food. The food was the real star. First of all, everything was plated BEAUTIFULLY! Almost every dish had an orchid adorning its plate. The industrial engineer in me started crunching numbers to estimate how many orchids they must go through in a week. Even the drinks were gorgeous! I didn't order any of these for myself, but looking around at the other tables, i know i'll have to come back and try something!\n\nWe ordered the fresh spring rolls, tamarind beef, kha kai noodles, and mixed vegetables. \n\nThe spring rolls were SO FRESH. They put mint in them and it was the most amazing thing to start our meal. They wrap the vegetables with three layers of noodle, which I thought was going to be too thick, but it ended up being really delicious :) \n\nThe tamarind beef was served with eggplant and the sauce was SO GOOD!

It was on the sweeter side with some coconut milk mixed in.

While everything held together well, there was barely any taste of the pork sausage or anything else inside. I had to use the peanut dip (which was too syrupy sweet) to add some flavor. Not at all worth the $11 in my opinion \n\n-Kaw Khai noodles: Delicious but not mind-blowing. The two things they did right was 1. boingy noodles 2. ratios of sweetness, spiciness, and saltiness. Everything else seemed pretty standard--the chicken was a little dry. Flavors were good but portion-size was weird: a bit small for two people to share but too much for one person to eat alone. \n\nI don't think I'd come back here to try the other foods since I've had same quality and cheaper noodles elsewhere.

They serve delicious, inventive, and widely varied dishes that are beautifully presented and cooked with fantastic flavors. Book a table on Yelp because they can get packed.\n\nI'm a big fan of the Lao fried rice and khaw kai noodles; the portions are large enough that you'll have something to take away (or you're going to need a nap afterward). If you're into the chicken-and-rice trend that's hit SF lately, order the khao mun gai and don't skimp on the sauce. Atkins dieters will find a handful of protein-and-vegetable dishes at the pricier end of the menu. I've heard good things about the pho but I've never ordered it, since there are plenty of other places to get that in the City. \n\nThe one lunch challenge at Lao Table is speed of service. It's not uncommon for some dishes to come out several minutes before others, so practice your politely frustrated \"please get started without me\" speech. When they're slammed it can also be hard to get someone to bring the check, so if you've got to head back for an after-lunch meeting, ask to pay as soon as the food arrives.", "author": "Alex L."}

In addition to utilizing Yelp Res, they have a ton of business-uploaded photos and even offer pickup through Yelp Eat24! \n\nWhile scanning the menu, I changed my mind a few times on what I was ultimately going to order. I initially wanted to eat light and was eye-balling the salads, but none of them were hitting the spot in my mind, so I opted for the Pad Mee, which I don't think I've ever had before, so I didn't know what to expect.\n\nThe result? I'm officially addicted to Pad Mee after one experience, and will definitely be seeking it out in the future. The noodles were razor thin, but packed so much flavor.

First thing you'll notice when walking in is how colorful and vibrant the interior is set up. The colors and decorative pieces throughout are just beautiful. I only wished the thoughtfulness behind the interior would translate to their menu offerings. If you're just here for the HH $1 oysters, I would specifically request a bar area seat as this offer is valid only in this section. This is not a cool thing to enforce and not make obvious in their signage. We primarily stuck to the HH menu and ordered quite a few small dishes to share. \n\nThe standouts for me were the french fries(seasoned with a spicy kick), and beef jerky. The wings were decent but not a good value. I tried their Lao-jito(Mojito clone) which was pedestrian. I also tried their Old Fashioned off the regular drink menu and it was solid. The primary reason we ventured out here before the Giants game was to chow down on $1 HH oysters and these too were a disappointment. They were of the larger variety and not the best quality. Definitely not Kumamoto oysters(far from it).\n\nAgain I did not try their dinner menu so my rating truly only applies to my take on the HH experience here, and for that, I would not return again.

I'm a fan\" and \"I can't wait to come back.\"\n\nI came here for lunch the other day with co-workers. It was pouring rain outside, but thankfully, Lao Table was walking distance from our office. The restaurant interior is a beauty. It had a cozy, modern-Asian decor, and judging by the diners, it looked like a hot spot for FiDi/Techie types. \n\nUnfortunately, looks can be deceiving, as we would soon find out. There are some serious service issues here. After being seated, it took almost ten minutes to get our menu or a glass of water. The hostess finally noticed that our table was being neglected and came back with our menus. I mean, that stuff happens. It's a new restaurant. They're still working out their kinks. No biggie. Our server took our order five minutes later. Not exactly the warmest waiter I've ever encountered. He didn't really provide too much insight into the menu or offer any recommendations. When a few of my co-workers asked if they could substitute chicken for prawns or another protein, our server simply replied, \"No, that'll cost you another $5.\" It felt more like a penalty as opposed to a surcharge. It just left us all feeling a bit cold and confused. \n\nI will say this... the menu boasts an eclectic array of Laoatian dishes. There are a number of things I was interested in trying. Our table wound up splitting a few apps, including the Vegeterian Spring Rolls (with a garlic dipping sauce), and the spicy Lao Sausage. Both were quite delicious, and great to share with a group of 4 or 5 people.\n\nFor my entree, I chose the Basil Chicken (wok fried chicken, chili, garlic, basil, fried egg, over rice). The dish was fine, though not entirely memorable. I found some of the chicken pieces to be especially tough and hard to chew. And you really had to dig down to the bottom of the bowl with your fork to pick up the sauce. Even though they give you a generous serving, $17 still seemed a bit pricey (especially when you can get this kind of dish at most Thai restaurants for $12).\n\nLao Table offers a variety of beers, wines by the glass, and cocktails... but I decided to just stick with water since it was a work-day. \n\nLong story short... I would def give this place another shot. I think they're still new and working things out in the kitchen and on the floor. Given the high prices, I might just consider Lao Table for a SOMA happy hour (order a few apps to share and some cocktails).", "author": "Kevin B."}

The food tasted great but was definitely on the pricier side for what it was. But let me tell you, their drinks are AMAZING. I would definitely come here for the drinks which really sounds weird but I think the drinks were executed really well. I came here for a work lunch and the entire restaurant filled up which was so unexpected. However, they had only 2 servers and seemed short staffed. Also, the kitchen messed up our vegan/vegetarian option which was not really okay...a little more TLC from the restaurant would be nice since IMHO, an establishment should try to accommodate for all their patrons' special dietary needs. Thankfully it wasn't something deadly like a peanut allergy. I ordered the duck larb for my main entree and it was ON FIRE. That was so spicy and ya girl can handle her spices. It took us over 20 minutes to get the bill which was a bit stressful since we all had to head back to work afterwards.", "author": "Denise L."}

Portion sizes are more than generous and unless you want to be rolled out of the restaurant, best to box some for home. \n\nNot the cheapest southeast Asian food you can get at ~$35 pp after T&T (no booze).

I would say the dishes had a little more flavor and spiciness  than the traditional Thai without  specified spiciness level.  The fried roll was crunch and very flavorful. \nBeef with a pepper corn dish with light sauce was excellent. I would reduce the amount of pineapple and add some scallions and mushrooms.  Their equal to Pad Thai with shrimp  was very good.  The noodle was fresh, not sticky or over cooked.  We finished our lunch with a chocolate shuffle with slices of mango, strawberry, liche and Thai ice tea ice cream.  The shuffle was sub par. It tasted more like a prematurely cooked softer  Browny.

(Would you really pay $44/pp for a drink and some lunch?) Luckily for me, I fell into this category as my boss treated us to lunch here. I therefore enjoyed this business lunch very much! \n\nWe ordered the fried rice, which had a spicy kick to it, noodles (which were very, very similar to Osha Thai's Phad Thai), mixed veggies, and the Mark Mango! \n\nComing from a guy who tells everyone he's obsessed with mango, the bright yellow dessert was really delicious and fun to eat. It's a tower of shaved ice served with a pitcher of mango juice, another of condensed milk, all to be mixed in with fresh mango and sticky rice. YOM. \n\nWould I come back here on my own dime?

But given you're paying an arm and a leg for just spring rolls alone, I wouldn't come here unless it was with a group of people or company-sponsored (for which it was).\n\nYes, I understand the location is what's driving the cost of $12 spring rolls, but I was utterly disappointed at them. Maybe it's because I still have $1 (amazing) spring rolls from Southeast Asia anchored to my mind, but there was nothing fancy about these spring rolls (given I used to be somewhat of an amateur spring roll maker myself).\n\nEnough about the spring rolls. We also tried the Spicy Steak Lao ($30) and Kurobuta Pork Belly ($26), which were both mouthwatering and left an impression. Highly recommend those two dishes if you're looking at entree options.\n\nThis isn't your typical hole-in-the-wall but consider it fine dining for Laotian food.

My boyfriend and I went in the other night around 9 PM. What I noticed immediately was the brightness of the space. It was well-lit (something we joked as a rarity nowadays) and the decor added to its vibrancy. At the center of the restaurant are these gorgeous red-magenta chandeliers. It's very festive and colorful throughout. \n\nFor food, we ordered Lao Sausage which is served with chunks of fresh ginger, peanuts, and sliced garlic. The sausage really packed a punch. It was a bit spicy and had lots of robust flavors. You eat the slices of sausage with fresh romaine. I thought this was delicious. Similarly, the \"Larb Zeen\" beef lettuce wrap was spicy and quite fresh. It reminded me of a traditional Thai larb. Our favorite dishes of the night were the Garlic Pepper Pork Bowl and \"Khaw Kai\" Noodles. First, about the bowl: the pork was succulent and sat on a bed of rice. It was accompanied with a fried egg. When you break the yolk, it seeped into the rice making it extra silky and smooth. There were pieces of cucumber as well on the side. The intense flavors of the garlic coupled with the egg-rich rice reminded me of a traditional Filipino breakfast (e.g. tocilog, longsilog) except replace the cucumber with tomato. In other words, this garlic pepper pork bowl is great! The noodles were also tasty with an abundance of greens and lean chicken. We also ordered cocktails which were both a bit too sweet for our liking. Luckily our satisfaction with the food trumped our disappointments with the cocktails. Also, somewhat of a digression, but their plates and bowls are beautiful and uniquely-shaped. I want them! I looked underneath to find out where they got them; the lovely bowls are from Thailand.\n\nIn terms of value, I thought it was alright. The portions were generous but the prices were steeper than we expected. We suspect this had to do with its downtown location. We noticed a lot of the diners look like they were tech workers having a late dinner after work -- folks who generally have lots of disposable income. I also suspect this is popular with the business crowd during the workweek hence Lao Table's ability to price their dishes beyond expectation. Nevertheless, the food quality coupled with the ambiance is a 4-star experience. I'm no authority of Laotian cuisine so I don't know if they served up the most \"authentic\" food, but for what it's worth, this was a great introduction.", "author": "James Z."}

Made a reservation through Yelp and it went smoothly. I arrived 10 mins early and they sat us down. They have happy hour from 5-7 at the bar only. You can't take away from the bar which is just annoying. $1 oysters is what people went for.\n\nService was ok. The waiter came to ask if I was ready to order but I said we were waiting for one more. Once I was ready, I told one of the waiters. He said ok, looked at me for a second, then walked away and never came back. Started serving other tables and even took the order of the table behind us. Like hello? After that, service (of another waiter) was much better. Waters were refilled and needs were met.\n\nHere's the thoughts on food:\n~Duck Wings - I felt it was a bit tough. There was 4 on the dish. There was some sauce at the bottom which made the wing taste better. Otherwise it's just fried wings. Couldn't really taste duck.\n~Chicken Satay - 6 skewers in 1 order. Chicken was a bit dry but the peanut sauce made it all better.\n~Grilled Calamari - this was something new. I liked the grilled part of the calamari. It's also soft not chewy which is how I like it. The sauce is pretty spicy tho just FYI.\n++Totally Prawns - MY FAAAAAAVORRRRITEEEEE. Sweet pineapple red curry yum yum yum. This is exactly how I remember the Prawns Pineapple at Osha Thai. It's so good. It's a mild spicy too. The prawns are also huge on this dish. I felt like this place made it better than Osha themselves.\n++Garlic Pepper Pork - Another favorite of mine. The pork was marinated well and tasted delicious. I would order this again.\n+Pineapple Fried Rice - Not much to expect from a pineapple fried rice. Pretty standard stuff. I usually order it cuz pineapples.\n+Lao Fried Rice - I love the fact that this dish comes with 3 chicken wings. It is VERY MILD spicy. Not too big of a fan of the chopped up green beans but meh. It's a good deal tho.\n-Mok Seabass - This dish was weird. Like the herbs on top was spicy and I wasn't sure what I was eating. Seabass was a dry too. I didn't really like it and I would not recommend it.\n-Pad mee Prawns - wasn't a memorable dish and I had it just last night. If I remember correctly, it was a bit bland.", "author": "Benita M."}

For $18 I'd expect it to be better. \n \nI went for lunch on a weekday and they use the same menu and pricing that the do for dinner. That makes lunch too pricey and too much food.

Great grilled flavor and cooked perfectly without being over done. The brown rice was a step above regular. I'm not a big fan of brown rice but I've been on a huge work out kick lately and REALLY wanted that Thai Tea, so I picked brown rice over white. It was very, very good - just as good as white in terms of both texture AND flavor.\n\nThe Thai Tea was lovely - not too sweet and slightly bitter. Highly recommend.\n\nUnfortunately the only drawback was they forgot to pack utensils and since I'm staying at a hotel, I had to wait 30 mins for room service to bring me utensils.

Service is very friendly and accommodating but it sometimes gets understandably busy so we have to flag them down at times. \n\nGo for the tum mak hoong/papaya salad - it'll be what you see at most Thai places. Super mild with great flavors and a great intro for most. If you want to veer off the norm or if you like things super spicy, then ask for the Lao style salad. We warned you about the spiciness though (you can also ask for less spicy)! We also ask for less sugar and they're extremely accommodating. Thumbs up for being so gracious about our particular order - it can be a pain sometimes so it's much appreciated.\n\nSup nor mai was not as flavorful and was much more sour than expected. Don't order unless you really like bamboo and fish notes obviously. \n\nKhao poon was okay but not enough curry soup like traditionally prepared (maybe should've ordered me ka ti instead?) so it was more like a mee lard nah (drunken noodles with gravy) instead of khao poon. \n\nMok seabass is something you should definitely try. It's a delicious banana leaf wrapped fish with herbs and they do it well here. It's light and aromatic; similar to how many other cultures wrap stuff in banana leaves and the French prepare poisson en papillote. \n\nGet the crispy sticky rice salad. Just get it. It's good stuff and a usual crowd pleaser.\n\nGai yaang ka min is perfectly spiced and typically good.

For the quality and price of food they serve, I would imagine they would be well staffed and funded. They were under staffed on a Friday night during prime dinner rush. The host didn't even know where the reservation tablet was, and there were several people booked for reservations at the same time when there weren't any tables available. It's more of an issue with management, the servers were rude and very discombobulated as a result of the disorganization. \n\nAdjust your reservation system!

The interior is really luxurious and the waiter staff are all very professional. The service was pretty good and friendly.\n\nI got the khao nar ped (duck rice bowl) because I was craving duck. It came in a large bowl with lightly seasoned rice, a few slices of cucumber, and a breast of duck laid on top. The duck was rather dry and lacked the deep umami flavor that duck often has. Also, as it was just rice and duck breast and a few pieces of cucumber, there was no variety in texture and each bite felt dry. So I doused it in the sweet and sour sauce that came with the dish, but it did not improve much. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't good. It was very okay, but it came with a price tag of $23 and tax/tip/surcharge put the bill at $30. \n\nI also feel that thai food tends to be pretty big in portion size but not here so much.\n\nWould have been better with a cheap take out $10 pad Thai :/", "author": "Grace P."}

Anyway I came here and tried the new menu which was so similar to Osha, but cooked in a different style. It was lackluster to be perfectly honest.

First off, make your reservations on Yelp. I made reservation for 8:30pm, but called to change to 8:45 and we were still a little late. They were so welcoming and accommodating of my party of 5. Since it was a Wednesday night and my party and I were dining so late, it wasn't overly crowded. The table ordered chicken satay, spring rolls, grilled calamari, pineapple fried rice and a couple ordered pho bowls. Presentations were beautiful arriving to our table on small wooden planks and very abundant amounts. I am a huge fan of calamari, so I was so excited to order the grilled calamari. Actually, I was sold by a photo taken on Yelp of the grilled calamari. It was absolutely delicious. Perfectly cooked, seasoned wonderfully and plentiful for an appetizer (to share) or to have as your entree. Chicken satay is a pretty boring dish for me, but for that protein you may need, it's great! The pineapple fried rice was a hit and definitely stuck out with it's huge chunks of pineapple and chicken. Customer service here was the best. They paid careful attention to keeping our table clean, the waiter was very attentive and they made my daughter feel special by singing happy birthday (accompanied with dimming of the lights and a bell gong). This restaurant is in the heart of the Financial District - on 2nd Street between Howard and Market. Make reservations on Yelp and you're good to go. I have had Thai food plenty of times and many may compare it to that, but there are definitely differences in flavors and seasonings. I'd love to be back, when I am in San Francisco again. I am always so excited to go to ethnic restaurants because I don't get too many places like that in the current state I live in, sadly enough. If you have a big group, check out this restaurant, too; they can accommodate.", "author": "Rebecca W."}

I rarely leave negative reviews, but I hope they see this so changes can be made. I made a reservation here for my birthday over the phone one week in advance. I called the day of the reservation to add one person to my table. I show up Saturday night for my 7pm reservation and they said they believed I had called and canceled it. I said this wasn't true and they argued with me saying I called TWICE that day to cancel. Again, not true. My only conclusion is that there were two Emma's who made a reservation for that night? Me thinks they need to work on their reservation system - especially since another party who had a 7pm reservation said their table was also given away and that the restaurant had \"lost\" their reservation as well. All in all, we were finally seated at 7:45pm once I put a bit of pressure on them. Yes they were super packed on a Saturday night, but that's the reason I made a reservation well in advance. \n\nOnce we were seated, nobody gave us menus or asked if we liked anything to drink. I think it took about 20 minutes for a waiter to see us, and that was after we asked. \n\nThe good news: attractive decor and location and tasty food. I especially enjoyed the curry and eggplant we had. Portions are smaller than most Thai/Lao places so I'd lean on ordering more than less. \n\nLao Table - I hope you fix your service and reservations so no one else has to wait over an hour for service on a special occasion.", "author": "Emma W."}

This time, we chose Lao Table. \nIt was quite a bit of walking to 2nd street, instead of the restaurants across the street at Yerba Buena. But it was well worth the trek. \nUpon entering, we were greeting by a nice gentleman with a Buddhist bow, with his hands clasped together. \nThe restaurant is very nicely appointed. Orchids everywhere, a gold statue of Buddha, bells, lampshades... the blue plates on the table are exotic. \nMy husband ordered a whisky drink that came with an elephant keychain. My son had Thai iced tea. \nFor appetizer we had the Lao sausage, and the crispy chicken wings. The chicken wings were delicate, different from the thickly breaded Korean wings. Nicely flavored, with lots of fried garlic. The Lao sausage was excellent too, served with lettuce to wrap the slices, with peanuts and fresh herbs, onions and garlic slices... somehow it seemed to miss a dipping sauce. The sausage was perfectly seasoned, but it is just me, I would have liked a dipping sauce. \nThe entrees were magnificently displayed on wooden boards, each with a sauce and a small covered bowl of rice. \nThe Kobe beef was served sliced, a side of vegetables crudit\u00e9s and apple slices, and a tamarind chili sauce, and sweet rice. Yum! \nThe kurobota pork belly came with a glistening cameralized glaze, on a bed of picked vegetables, and a dipping sauce. \nThe totally prawns ( name of dish ) red curry had a beautiful explosion of colors: red curry, pink jumbo prawns, white lychees, red and yellow peppers and green herbs, with the rice in a white and blue covered bowl. \nThey were all delicious!! \nTime was pressing for the movie, but we also ordered the sweet rice and coconut ice cream. The sweet rice came in two tiny bundles of leaves, sweet rice with red beans and banana. The coconut ice cream ( 2 scoops ) was served inside a whole young coconut. We ate as fast as we could, and I took the coconut with me, ice cream still left inside. And the young coconut meat was another delicious treat after the ice cream was gone. \nService was friendly and the entrees came swiftly after we finished the appetizers. \nAs we hurriedly left the restaurant to go to the Metreon, we already were thinking about coming back to try the other dishes.

I was excited to try this trendy modern looking restaurant, but the food was not up to par with even some of the other cheaper sketchier restaurants in the city, and definitely did not meet expectation to the flavors I've found at some fancier Thai restaurants in the past. \n\nKhan Kai noodles 2.5/5: this was the closest to pad seew that they offered, but were unable to substitute the chicken for beef. There were also peanuts on top which was more reminiscent of what I would prefer in pad Thai. The sauce was also lackluster in moisture and flavor. I like more soy sauce in my noodles. A good portion size for the price, easily enough to split with a friend. \n\nPineapple fried rice 4/5: the highlight of the meal. This was a very traditional Thai pineapple fried rice, solid, but nothing I haven't seen before. It was good mainly because it outshined the others, as a standalone plate compared to other restaurants, it was still lacking. Great portion size for the price. \n\nThai iced tea 2/5: huge glass mainly to hold the exuberant amount of crushed ice. A bit overwhelming with the milky flavor with an infusion of tea \n\nBamboo salad 3/5: ornate presentation in a hanging basket, otherwise underwhelming in complexity (all the ingredients were just piled next to one another), and lacking in any complex flavors, mainly comprised of a few raw ingredients and little dressing. \n\nTLDR: This was a meet in the middle experience - nice ambiance like some of the more expensive Thai places I've been, but mediocre food that seemed non-traditional, but didn't have enough of an oomph to satisfy me with a unique crossover or fusion cuisine. Would have opted for a more traditional experience.", "author": "Kathy T."}

Firstly, it took 20 minutes to take a drinks order - on the long side but excusable as a one off, the restaurant was very busy. The first bit of food to arrive came at the 45 minute mark, and it was a papaya salad which we'd ordered to come with the main course. The salad was fresh and spicy, excellent in fact, but seemed completely of place. After prompting the waiter another 10 minutes later some appetisers arrived. The wings and pork belly, both excellent but stone cold (no exaggeration, they weren't even warm). All we could put this down to was the waiting staff. How can food be both slow and cold? It's sitting around somewhere too long.\n\nThe theme continued to the main courses - which tasted excellent but were cold. I almost sent it back but by the time we were asked about the food I had lost my appetite. Overall, I won't be going back.

They have a full bar and a wonderful dining room atmosphere beneath hundreds of brass bells, three large temple bells and lantern like fixtures all hanging overhead.\n\nAt $13.95 their daily lunch special is a great value for one in this part of town. I'd recommend coming with a group and enjoying several unfamiliar dishes relaxed, family style. \n \nAt $12.95 the Lao Sausage appetizer with ginger, onion and nicely toasted peanuts was surprisingly juicy and zesty while the $14.95 Zeen Ping/Grilled Steak cubes marinated in lemongrass with a chili-lime dipping sauce were tender and refreshingly different.\n\nAt $17.95 the Red Curry Chicken in coconut milk with its perfectly prepared apple eggplants and basil had a taste and quality to match its price. And, at $19.00 the Tom Laab Lao/Braised Pork Rib Laotian sour soup was a delicious and obvious relative of Tom Yum. \n\nThe favorite of our table was the $31.95 Kha Moo German/Pork knuckle on a bed of saut\u00e9ed cabbage.

We made a reservation since we were a group of 8, but it didn't seem too busy when we got there so it might have been fine if we went without one. We got sat at a large table right by the door, but for some reason didn't all get menus which was fine since we were about 2-3 less people than our original reservation.\n\nOne waiter took our orders but, I'm not sure if it was that he didn't really understand English or if he just wasn't paying attention, there ended up being some weird mix up in orders. My coworker and I both ordered pho which came out later than all the other orders, and someone brought out a fried rice dish that no one at the table had ordered. When we said no one had ordered that and we were just waiting for our pho, she kept circling the table as though she didn't believe us and knew the dish was someone's...so weird!\n\nOverall, the food was fine (not too different from Osha Thai), but I was really surprised by the plating of the pho and how big it was! They brought out a giant bowl on top of a bamboo tray with a small bowl of basil, bean sprouts, lime, and jalapenos, and it was definitely a lot of food for one person. I was pretty hungry but I wasn't able to finish it! The short rib broth tasted pretty good and the short rib itself was tender and delicious. I would come back again if I was with a big group and wanted a quick meal.\n\nMy only pet peeve was that they had 3 TVs above the bar directly in front of me playing the same channel...but each one was about 5 seconds off from the other so it was really distracting and made my OCD go crazy x_x", "author": "Grace C."}

Comes with an over easy egg and a good amount of rice. The rice was cooked perfectly, which I appreciated!\n-Cha-yen: Thai tea shaved snow with a scoop of thai tea ice cream and Laotian toppings (aka grass jelly, lychee, jackfruit, rambutan). As an avid exotic fruit eater, my bf enjoyed the different fruits, and I enjoyed the shaved snow...great way to end the meal!\n\nThe service was a lot better than last time - food came out a ton quicker and servers were much more friendly and inviting.

First off, I made reservations on Yelp (which was very easy), so our table was waiting.  The ambiance was conducive to conversation (i.e., not too loud), and overall the space felt clean and comfortable.  The food was quite good (I had a vegetarian wok meal).\n\nMy only complaint is that the service was slow.  It took a while for our server to take our order, then deliver our Diet Cokes, then bring lunch.  Since it was a work day, it caused us to rush eating.  The restaurant was quite busy, so I assume that is why things were slow.\n\nOverall, I liked my meal.  I plan to go back.", "author": "Brian O."}

After reading about it after my meal, I realized it is opened by Osha Thai. It was then that everything made sense. Dinner came out to $90 including 15% tip for both of us. We had 1 appetizer, 1 entree each that included jasmine rice (I added $2 for brown rice), and shared a mark mango shaved ice with sticky rice dessert ($13). My favorite part of the meal was the dessert. Both the entrees were decent in terms of portion, but nothing over the top wow. I felt the same way about the appetizer. We probably would have saved $30 if we went to Osha Thai for similar food and ambiance. Since April was the owner's birthday, the restaurant was giving a \"surprise\" gift to anyone who celebrated their birthday with the restaurant. The owner had every worker wear a funny t shirt with the caption \"Kings are born in April\", a reference to the owner being born in April.\n\nPros:\n+Easy to get a reservation on open table. Even for a Saturday night, they had peak time availability. \n+Ample space. Great ambiance. Comfortable seats.\n+Great service. Water was always filled.\n+Takes credit card.\n+Decent selection on menu covering vegetarians, pescatarians, and carnivores.\n+Very accessible to public transit. Closest to Montgomery Station.\n+Nice plating.\n\nCons:\n-Difficult to find parking.\n-Overpriced. I think fair value would be $60 for a meal of 2 at this place.\n-Nothing too amazing. It wasn't terrible, just not \"wow\".\n-Can be a bit noisy. There were kids running around and sugar high from the mango dessert next to us.", "author": "Tina C."}

We put in reservations for a Monday night and were seated promptly.\n\nFirst observation is that perhaps this is not a place to take children to. Not that they were giving off vibe of being not child-friendly. Quite the opposite, everyone was super accommodating and super nice. But there is a nice bar, with happy hours on weekdays. So I would say this is most definitely for adults to go to after work in the Financial District/SOMA. Just happens to be very child-friendly as well, if your children are 6+ like ours\u00a0;)\n\nAs for the restaurant itself... well we all forgot about our worry of child-friendly places to dine at. The food here is amazing! First time trying Laotian food and it reminded us of Thai and Vietnamese food. Which makes sense since they are all in the same neighborhood.\n\nThe tuna tartare was delicious. Chicken satay and fried spring rolls too mmm. The kids both got the Pho Beef with all the veggies removed haha. I got the Pho Beef too and man, I'd have to say the best one I've had. The beef just melted in your mouth, so tender. Also shared the Tom Yum soup.. yaaasss soooo good!! We all enjoyed the taste of everything. You can tell everything was top quality. Of course you pay for that quality! The Pho Beef was $17.

Surprisingly this one pop up on my yelp  . Read some reviews , some good some bad . Decided to come anyways because I am Laotian and was craving Lao food and wanted to see what they had in store . Knowing deep down I might not be happy with the food because I don't know if it will taste authentic or not ! \n\nInside is very nice , tables are close to each other like some had said on the reviews . It was just me and my Bf . He ordered the beef larb , Thai tea and sticky rice . So I took a taste of it , beef larb was good but not good enough for the price . It was just a basic larb, flavor was there but not really . To me it was kind of dried . I had better . I mean most of the stuff here is pricey, so if you're not trying to pay extra money I'll say just go to a Thai restaurant that do serve this that is a little less money out of your pocket . Thai tea was ok , we had to ask for sugar kus it wasn't sweet enough . Sticky rice was ok, I don't think it was that fresh because around the sticky rice it was getting hard . Like you just threw the sticky rice in the microwave to warm it up . & if you don't eat it fast enough it'll get hard . So I was disappointed . \n\nI ordered the Lao crispy rice salad I believe that's what it's called . So I'm thinking Naam khao . Grew up eating this dish at Laotian parties and stuff . So I'm like ok I'll give this a try . My dish came out , you can tell rice was crispy and all that . I ordered mines Spicy but I don't know if they add pepper flakes in this or they just gave me extra fried peppers . I was surprise their fried peppers were spicy . Anyways I had my first bite , it had a strong kick to it . Like a strong fish sauce kick . I'm like woo. The more you eat the more you don't taste it anymore . To be honest this dish was plain to me . I'm surprise it didn't have any lime or lemon on this dish kus this dish should have that little sour kick to it . But it didn't , so I asked for some . If you order this dish I suggest you to ask for some lime . It'll make it taste way better than before ! \n\nNext time I visit the bay I don't think I'll be here again .", "author": "Cindy A."}

I decided to have my birthday dinner at Lao Table, just with my mother and father. Right off the bat, we were seated near the bar area and the lady-bartender was quite unpleasant from the get-go, seeming to not even want to be there or be of service. By the end of the meal (which was decent), they hadn't even asked if we wanted dessert!! Tony (server mentioned in last review) wasn't our main server but apologized for our actual server(s) not checking on us by the end of our meal. We left a little bummed but still wanting to give this place another chance. We then returned for my mother's birthday and experienced even worse service than before!! Still nobody asked if we wanted dessert, nobody checked on us throughout our meal, and worst of all, the bartender-lady took away our plates and dishes before we were finished - without asking !!! So rude! We had to tell her \"I'm sorry, we're not done yet...\" to which there was no apology, just the plate set back down and her walking away without a word.

Right off the bat, I just loved the lively atmosphere and it looked like everyone was enjoying their dinners.\n\nSo we ordered the koi tuna,the spicy eggplant (wok), and the tom en keow (soup). I thought the koi tuna was just okay- it was a small portion appetizer that came with crouton chips and lettuce. Good, but was not eagerly digging up for more. The spicy eggplant was great- the tofu, eggplant, and sauce were perfectly cooked and had just the right amount of spice. The tom en keow was my favorite part. It had bits of tender beef short ribs and pineapple pieces. The soup was just so tangy, creamy and delicious, and it tasted so right with a side of rice.\n\nIt's a bit on the pricier side, but I'd really love to go back to try out the rest of the menu!", "author": "Sarah L."}

I took off 2 stars for those purposes however the food was actually very tasty. We started off with garlic chicken wings, juicy, decent garlic flavor. Lao fried rice and stir lao pad thai was tasty as well but just tasted like regular pad thai  The crying Tiger steak, didnt have a very pleasing display but it was actually pretty Fantastic. Our Favorite dish.. We ended with the mango sticky rice and icy dessert. I would skip this as well. Its large and meant to share but a few things we didn't like was that it was basically just a fluff of ice with artificial mango flavoring, sticky rice seemed very hard..

It's a nice setting for interesting asian food, but not in a dumpy little hole-in-the-wall.  Oh, with cocktails too.   \n\nService was well-intentioned, but slow and not well trained yet.  The food has interesting spices and ingredients (like a small round eggplant and something that looked like a branch of peppercorns), and generally quite well prepared.  I did not love the calamari, but that's because it was ONE giant calamari (grilled and cut up) and it's so hard to get that cooked just-right, between the unappetizing flabby texture when undercooked and nasty rubber-band texture when overcooked.  the grilled celery goes really nicely with it and there's great grill flavor and smokiness and a nice sauce.\n\nwhat I did not like:  the menu should've been more informative about how Laotian cuisine is both similar to and different from Thai.  And how does Pho fit in?  I thought that was Vietnam? SO i'd like the menu to be a little more focused on Laos.  I'd also have a 'set plate' for lunch, that would be less expensive, and also served faster (for people who would want to grab a quick lunch there, rather than sitting & mingling, with cocktails).  I think the 'lunch set menu' now is intended for takeout?     \n\nI saw another comment here that it's priced for people on an expense account and I don't disagree.  In fact, at one point while we were there, an older couple, casually dressed, came in for lunch, sat down, had a look at the menu for awhile, and then got up and left.  Might've been the $22 Pho but I can't be certain.   I don't usually pay much attention to the prices but I'm going to guess this menu pricing will be downright shocking to some out of town visitors.", "author": "Jaina S."}

We started with a dozen oysters and the calamari then moved on to the duck lettuce wraps. The oysters were fresh and the dipping sauce was spicy but the calamari was over fried, tough and chewy. The duck was ground meat that tasted like ground turkey. Was hoping for something of higher caliber like sliced duck breast. We had a couple rounds of the Get Lao'd, one of their signature cocktails, but it was mostly ice and a stuffed toy elephant. For our entrees we had the sea bass and spicy eggplant with prawns added. Again, surprisingly underwhelming given these high reviews. The sea bass was over steamed and dry. We did not finish it. The eggplant and prawn dish was average and only had 4 small sized prawns.

For those who are only interested in how good the food was - tldr; it was decent but definitely not worth the wait. \n\nI wouldn't say the food at Lao Table is unique or is anything better or different from what it used to be (Osha Thai). I'm definitely no expert in Thai/Laotian food, but I can certainly say I've had better tasting tom yum soup. \n\nNow, back to my original point - came here with a party of 14. Yes, a large party, but we had a reservation, and it's nothing out of the norm for financial district. All I ordered was a cup of tom yum soup, and a sticky rice salad. Of every single person at the table, i was the last person to get my food, by a loooong shot. How is a cup of soup and salad the slowest dish to come out??? I was definitely beyond hangry at that point.

We walked in and was not greeted by anyone, which is fine since it was Friday and they are probably packed for happy hours. A few minutes we were seated and realized how loud the music was. The waitresses were dressed in dark, skimpy dresses and had their boobs hanging out. OK, there were mens next to us and they were both drooling over these waitresses which instead they should have drooled over their foods. All restaurants have different tactics in targeting their customers and this is Lao's- have women dressed in provocative dresses to show off their big boobies and big booties. Since the music was blasting in front of our ears, my co-worker and I decided that we should just grab some appetizers and call it a day. We had quite a challenge trying to talk to each other. I literally had to repeat myself a few times, which made the conversation between us quite awkward. To make matters worst, two random girls came next to us to wait for our seats because they wanted to sit next to their friends whom already started to eat without them. The waitress(es) did nothing and allowed the two random girls to stand next to us while we paid for the bill. The waitress even came over to tell the two random girls \" you can have their seats when they leave \" Um, excuse me? Talk about rude! For such a high quality restaurant, Lao's Table does not know what courtesy means. We were not done eating or paying and felt completely rushed to LEAVE. So what if we just ordered appetizers and drinks??? This is a restaurant and we're allowed to order whatever we wanted even if it meant without a main course. We felt completely discriminated upon.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-16", "description": "OK food but overpriced.\n\nThe food was 3 stars. We ordered the pork belly appetizer, a salad (we were initially interested in the bamboo salad but eventually went with the server's recommendation of spicy duck lettuce wrap as she said we might not like the sour taste of the bamboo salad) and the \"pad mee\" prawns. I'm a big fan of pork belly and have had it in a lot of places including my native Malaysia (also part of SE Asia like Laos), Hong Kong and some other restaurants in New York and SF. This appetizer was mediocre - I find the pork belly too hard and chewy; the dipping sauce was good though. The duck lettuce wrap salad was probably my favorite dish of the three, but at $21.95 it was definitely overpriced. The \"pad mee\" prawns was similar to pad thai (or fried kuey teow in Malaysia), but with thinner noodles. I liked that it was not overly greasy, but other than that it didn't really stand out. \n\nService was 4 stars: In line for this price range. \n\nOverall, you're definitely paying for the ambiance and location at this place.", "author": "Mel L."}

The variety and combinations are brilliant. The presentation is visually stunning and appetizing. Many of the dishes are quite spicy, but they can accommodate milder palates, as well. If your INTO spicy, however, prepare yourself for an explosion of bliss. We ordered garlic pepper pork, Ph\u014d Beef, chicken fried rice, Ka-Pow lamb lollipops, and a dish that looks like shrimp Pad Thai. All were deeply satisfying and vibrant with color.

My guests come from London and Bangkok, and we were all very pleased.\nFOOD:  Great!  Our table started with 4 appetizers. I loved the Sai Oua (northern Thai sausage), reminiscent of my favorite snack when I to Chiang Mai, and hands down the best in SF.  Nicely fragrant, and good balance of lean pork meat and fat.  The wings, hanger steak ,and the tuna tartare-like a raw tuna larb,  where all tasty and beautifully presented.\nOur mains were equally as tasty.  OMG the pork knuckle! I wanted it all to myself.  Slow braised in a dark rich five-spice sauce with condiments.  The Mok Seabass also surprised me.  A nice play on Ho Mok, very big and balanced fish custard. \nAlthough we were very full we did order some light desserts.  The mango ice and rice and then the Thai tea ice-cream and ice. Both light, slightly sweet and refreshing.\nSERVICE: Great! Immediately greeted at the door and taken to our table.  I don't think we ever lacked for attention and service during our whole stay.  It seemed that we were serviced by many staff, and if anyone saw that we looked quizzical, or needed something the closest staff helped us.\nATMOSPHERE:  The restaurant is very well decorated, comfortable, modern, and spacy.  What I really appreciated was the bathrooms. Living in SF I have become accustom to having one old bathroom to accommodate the entire restaurant, however at Lao, it seems that the management invested all accommodations for customers in their remodel.  Never did I have to wait for the bathroom with a full restaurant.  There were three, maybe for bathrooms, all nicely appointed and clean. I did appreciate the different soaps and lotions.", "author": "OneOfTwo F."}

I loved the garlicy, sweet and tart chicken wings.  We had the fried rice salad and the Bamboo salad - both are lettuce wraps.  They asked what degree of spice, and my husband said medium.  Remember Thai medium is like Mexican hot.  I liked both salads, but the heat of the bamboo salad caught up with me.  We shared shrimp red curry, flat noodles, hanger steak with eggplant.  All were delicious.  The hanger steak and eggplant was especially sweet, but I like it that way.  To end we did the Mango ice with sticky rice/mangos.  4\nPeople shared it and there were left overs.  Very refreshing, think mango snow one with syrup to the bottom.  With 3 glasses of wine and a Thai ice tea it was about $170.   So I'd say it's more of a $$$ instead of $$.  It's beautifully decorated and the service was good.  The salad came out at the same time as the main dishes, and I wish there was a little more time between dishes.

It's very very similar to the old OSHA. It's also ridiculously overpriced. Twenty something dollars for bland pho chicken? Some dishes like the pork belly and sausage rolls are delicious, but it's not worth to come back and pay top $$$$ for food that Lers Ros and Saap Ver can give more for this kind of prices.", "author": "Hoang T."}

We got there a little early and there is NO space to wait anywhere. Sadly if you get a drink at the bar there is no where to go to drink it since they seat people at the bar (they will make you leave). Buuuut the food and service when you get a table was pretty great. The Tom Yum soup was amazing. Their medium is pretty spicy for the soup so be warned. Their yellow curry was pretty good too.", "author": "Jonathan S."}

The servers were quick and very friendly. I forgot to take pictures of the plates we had but one was a simple noodle dish with some pork or pork shoulder and our other plate was a pork belly in a tamarind sauce that resembled curry. For dessert we had the snow mike? I think. It was shaved ice with mango pur\u00e9e and on the side was sticky rice with mango. My only knock is that I wish we had more of the sticky rice and mango because that's my gf and I favorite but beggars can't be choosers. Overall I was surprised by this place because we just yelped it before going over to kaskade. Don't hesitate to try, compared to other places the food felt really authentic.", "author": "Joseph N."}

I've noticed the place is not as jammed pack as in the Osha days, when the pushy wait staff would aggressively encourage table turnover.  Well I soon figured out why it is no longer full at lunch. Was ushered to a crammed in table promptly at 1150. Ordered. Waited 15 minutes and no food.  20 mins. No food. 30 minutes no food.  People next to us also waiting 35 minutes. After 35 minutes, could not find staff to enquire about food ETA.  After 40 minutes got up and left.   I am never patronizing an Osha again and I look forward to their early demise.  Too much coasting on their laurels.  My new favorite Thai place in SF is Thai Farmers Market in the Multimedia gulch of inner mission.  Vastly superior food, service and price.", "author": "Dean P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-02", "description": "I went here for a dinner during my birthday week with a former colleague and his girlfriend. I gauge every Thai or Lao restaurant based on the authenticity of its papaya salad (\"tum mak hoong\"). Lao Table does not disappoint - the salad was deliciously spicy and the portion was impressive. My only issue was that my entree (I ordered the Tiger Steak) arrived well after everyone received their orders. My friends were even finished eating when I was only a few bites into my steak. I've worked in the restaurant industry before, so I notice how busy a server is and other tables around me. I give passes for things that would easily piss other people off and 20% is my standard tip unless I see you actually spit in my food. I'm pretty sure my server forgot to place the order and she told me that they had to \"remake the steak because it was overcooked when it was about it come out\" (I ordered it medium rare). It was my birthday but I wasn't born yesterday. Anyway, an apology and the truth would have been sufficient, but it seems that \"gullible\" is stamped on my forehead. Thankfully, I had the yummy papaya salad to pick at while my friends ate their meals. Would I book a dinner party here? Probably not. Would I return for the food with lower expectations of the service? Sure. Also, it was really cute that the American host nops and greeted us with \"sabai dee\" - it made me smile.", "author": "Vasana S."}
