It is by a corner on Geary and it is so easy to skip this place because of other cafe and food choices nearby. \n\nHonestly speaking, this is such a decent cafe where I will take a second experience right after my first! Their menu is simple but quality also comes along! Their price is more than just!  The setting of this place is also study/working-friendly, and I have spent a good afternoon working on my computer here without feeling uneasy.  It is also a good place if you need extra stimulus from looking out the window, you will see lots of interesting things happen in this neighborhood.", "author": "Shuyi L."}

There is nice seating with tables that I could see would be great for meeting with a friend or studying.\n\nFood: disappointing. I ordered the breakfast sandwich on an everything bagel. The bagel itself was fine and was toasted. However, the cheese was American cheese and the egg was microwaved. I should have just gone to McDonald's for this kind of quality (to be honest, I'd prefer an Egg McMuffin to this). It didn't taste good. \n\nService: Terrible. I'm not expecting formal dining room service, but a smile, friendly tone, or even a thank you goes a long way. I know it was 6:15 am, but I'm a patron and the negative attitude coupled with the microwave egg sandwich will not bring me back. Any time the man taking my order asked me a question (which bagel, salt and pepper?) he had his back to me so I couldn't understand him. When I asked him to repeat himself, he seemed extremely annoyed.

My priority is:\n\n1. wi-fi\n2. spacious with lots of tables/chairs/outlets\n3. near a bus stop\n\nall in that order.  I go there to surf the web and relax while listening to my laptop music for a few hours after I do my shopping on Geary.  If it has great food, great but it's not a priority with me.  The same goes for the people behind the counter - as long as they're not doing things that are totally taboo like giving you rotten food, then it's fine since \"small talk\" chitchat is not a priority with me either.  I've gone many times to Royal Cafe and the experience has been very good to great.  It's spacious enough that you don't feel squished/claustrophobic next to everyone else.   It isn't very scenic and you won't think it's very clean because they can't afford to just easily finance a million dollar cafe makeover like Starbucks, but the cafe is fine with me. \n\nThe people behind the counter aren't the most sociable but they aren't mean either - it's just how most Asians are.  Most Asians are introverts and cautious.  If they sound bossy, especially Asian females, it's just confidence (and the fact their family owns the cafe and/or the main workers in the cafe) and a need to get their tasks done quickly and should not be an assumption of arrogance.  I have never had a problem talking to them about my order, getting good service, asking about the wi-fi, asking to use the restroom,etc.  When you're in line to make your order, get your order ready asap and don't waste their time while other customers in the rest of the line are waiting to be serviced too.  Asians usually chitchat with friends they already know, not total strangers.\n\nThe coffee's not the best but they have smoothies, teas, italian sodas, regular store beverages, dessert cakes/pies, sandwiches, bagels, omelets, gyros, etc.  They have sofas as well as tables/chairs.  Right in front of it is the 38 bus stop which is a plus with me.  \n\nThe noise level can be medium-high in the afternoons but level off in the late afternoon to night times.  They do accept CC but I think there's a $5 or $10 minimum.  They're one of the few cafes on Geary that stay up as late as 10pm and there's no \"2 hour maximum\" (for wi-fi time before you get kicked off to force you to buy more stuff) which is common in some cafes.......cough...

I haven't gotten coffee here yet, but I can vouch that the Thai Iced Tea and White Hot Chocolate are some pretty quality tasting drinks. The bagel with cream cheese, capers, and lox is good too. But then again, an establishment has to be pretty lousy to mess up on something as simple as that. \n\nThe place has a slightly dumpy look to it, namely due to the couches with green sheets thrown haphazardly over them. However, I like it that way. Makes the place feel more cozy and homey. I like the sunny, yellow walls and murals of European villages too. And the multitude of windows overlooking the bustle of Geary provide good visual stimulation for those times when I find myself zoning out. \n\nAll in all, I really like this place.

It isn't antiseptically clean the way a chain might be, and yeah, you might find couches draped with sheets and newspapers strewn about, but that's half the charm! This cafe has a worn-in, homey feel and a sweet mural of a generic Italian town. You sort of just sink into the couches. I half expect a cat to wander by and sample my drink. The food is probably all from Costco, but the latte was good, and most importantly, it is a comfortable, warmly lit place to just sip away and chat with friends.\n\nImportant note: I visited once in the afternoon on a weekday and there appeared to be a table full of mafia (Russian?

I've been here several times, it's my neighborhood cafe. At first, I really liked the place -- and with good reason: good ambiance, good coffee. As a student, what you need to do gets done.\n\nHowever, over time, and with more and more negative experiences, I have been subjected to hours and hours of awful 90s songs (trust me, not a music snob here), dirty tables and unappetizing pastries bought at costco and resold for more expensive, and the snarky attitude of the owner. So tired of being approached at 9:55 and being told \"we're closing.\" Yeah, I figured. And thanks for reminding me rudely as if I was going to keep you.\n\nIt's hard to describe exactly how rude the owner is. I'm an easygoing person and generally let a lot of things slide. But I'm also in law school and remember coming here especially at 7am because i needed to get work done. The internet wasn't working, and I told the owner. She shrugged. 15 minutes later, I went up to her again, and she told me that sometimes it takes a while to turn on. She was absolutely rude and didn't seem to understand that I came to use the internet to finish a paper, not to sit around and enjoy the 7am silence. First time in my life I've ever left a place in anger, vowed never to come back, and since haven't.\n\nGiven that it is not an every day occurrence, two stars, Royal Grounds.", "author": "Asaf K."}

I am a fan of Royal Grounds Coffee since moving to San Francisco- my intention is not to bash the franchise. It's this particular location I'm very concerned about. \n\nAs we walked in, a woman greeted us rudely and did not look pleased to see us or to to be there. I ordered 2 salads which were 5.50 each, a raspberry bar and a vegan cookie. My friend decided she did not want the vegan cookie, but astonishingly she refused to give her change for the cookie. She simply shook her head and said she could not because she was \"too short\" in her register. Looking around at the 20+ people in the cafe I can assure you that at least one of them paid in cash and she had bills less than the 20 I gave her. I got involved in the conversation but she kept saying that my friend had the option of buying something else on the list, so to avoid conflict my friend replaced the cookie with a green tea of the same price. As I sat down a bit flustered, I felt overcharged  because it was 19.50 and I had not received a receipt- nor offered one. The line was long so I shrugged it off. \n\nA few minutes later as we were waiting for salads a man came in about in his late 20s attempting to pay for something in cash as well, and she told him the same thing that there was no change left in the register after he had received the item. He was fine at first then quickly became furious and grabbed his correct change out of the tip jar. He stormed out of the cafe and she followed him shortly after. Returned without any luck of catching up with him and looked like she just saw a ghost. A girl about 18, was next in line. She paid for a coffee with bigger bills and something crazy happened. I guess she decided she liked this person, or knew her personally and opened the register and gave her correct change in many different bills!!!! I could not believe my eyes. When the salad came ten minutes later it was bland as hell. But I had already lost my appetite.\n\nThe woman who worked here was clearly stealing from people, and trying to con them into not minding when she didn't give proper change and using her language barrier as an excuse to why she couldn't explain why the register wouldn't open. I confronted her at the end for being dishonest and she turned stone cold and kept repeating the register is short the register is short. \n\nI write this because I believe in good, honest and effective customer service. It doesn't matter what type of business you are running or how much money you make per day. For something as simple as a coffee shop, the owner or manager or barista or whatever she was should cares about the care and happiness of her customers over everything. \n\nBad people do not deserve your business.

The tables aren't wiped down regularly and while I felt somewhat comfortable, I also felt a bit uneasy, as one feels in a dirty restaurant while waiting for the food. \n\nLikewise, I was also a bit peeved about the soy milk. Because I don't drink milk, I always ask for a tiny amount of soy milk to use as creamer. Every coffee shop I've ever been to has always obliged at no extra charge. Royal Ground? No. The counter person obstinately told me that it would cost 65 cents (more than fifty cents) for the extra soy. I wanted to tell her that I was merely asking for soy as creamer (especially since soy is comparable in price to half and half) and NOT for a large amount like in a latte or mocha. But no. I was very disappointed.

The frequent buyer system doesn't seem to work but the person behind the counter can't be bothered to fix it or help.

Service is not unfriendly but it is clear the folks behind the counter want to do the least amount possible to complete your order. (I run a business and I hate to say it, if I had an employee with that attitude, I would have to let them go).\n\nI also am not a fan of the food. I've had a sandwich and thought I put together a better one (too many onions, mustard, and pickles usually so certainly ask for going 'light' on those items to get the right ratio if you get a sandwich here.) The baked goods are actually quite bad and should be avoided. The chocolate biscotti I had tasted like it was lemon biscotti dunked in generic chocolate. The Mexican Mocha cookie I had tasted old (like the saran wrap it was in) and the chocolate chips in it were barely edible. \n\nThe place itself can also use a good scrub. I cringe to put my bag on the floor and try to find a chair on which to place it. Everything is sort of dull and faded - but hey - certainly a change of scenery from the ultra modern coffee bars, I guess.\n\nTo wrap up, \nIf you are looking for excellent coffee with good food in the neighborhood, go to Velo Rouge (Blue Bottle), 50/50 (Ritual), or the Russian Bakery on Balboa (Ritual) but seating is iffy at all three and prices are reflective of the coffee/ food.\n\nIf you are looking for a cheap place to grab a cup of coffee and sit for a while, this is the place.\n\n(And if you want a bite to eat, what the hell are you doing here - walk down the street and get some awesome Asian food in the Richmond!)", "author": "Parag G."}

Today, however, I snuck out of the office to run an errand, and I found myself in the outer Richmond.  It was 2 hours past my First Cup of Coffee O'Clock, and I was getting cranky.

That's where I got my very first car loan for my 1996 Saturn SL2.  Boy, what a piece of crap that car was!  Finally, when I tutored MBA hopefuls, I brought my GMAT books and held my teaching sessions right here.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nIt's a small coffee house that wants to make you feel special.  It's a perfect coffee house for those who love to hate Starbucks.  It even feels cozy and hip, although it really isn't hip at all.  It reminds me of small, independent coffee houses on the East Coast.\n\nThey have a few small wooden tables with painted tabletops.  They also have two couches with duvet covers featuring jazzy floral prints.  Add a nice plastic cover, and you could be at your grandma's house.  The wooden floorboards are creaky, creating an interesting ambiance.  The indoor electric water fountain is a new addition.  Talk about class!\n\nWhat I love about this place is the huge windows and free wi-fi.  The crowd waiting for the 38 bus provides all the entertainment you need, should you forget your laptop.  They also have 3 desktops set up, and I think they are actually free.  Maybe not though.\n\nAs for the drinks and the food, it's just your regular traditional coffee house fare.  Their house coffee is pretty good; that's what I usually get.  The pastries are passable, at least Starbucks quality or better.  The biscotti is pretty good.  Again, I wouldn't come here for the food, I'd come here to enjoy the ambiance, the free wi-fi and a good conversation.\n\nThe staff here changes all the time, but they're consistently polite without being overly chatty or chummy.  They won't engage you in a conversation, but they won't yell at you, either.  If you're looking for the barista to be your BFF, I'd say go elsewhere.\n\nRoyal Ground is an A-OK place that would get 3 enthusiastic stars, if it hadn't been for my sappy stories.  So . . . Four stars it is!", "author": "Yan G."}

But I'm a hypocrite when it comes to my neighborhood Royal Ground. I hit this place up at least three times a week. For a chain establishment, it's got character --- it's casual and cozy, with big fluffy couches perfect for those who want to hunker down and compute with a warm beverage. The wall murals are a bit cheesy, but the light is soft, and the corner storefront windows are enormous and ideal for people watching on a foggy Richmond evening. The staff is cheerful, they let you linger even past closing, and they make a darn good soy chai (my drink of choice). \n\nIt doesn't feel like a chainy place, I guess is what I'm saying... The best part? They've got free wireless. And I only recently realized what a rarity that is. \n\nMy first home in San Francisco was in Upper Haight, and I had the luxury of several great coffee houses on my strip with free wireless --- Rockin' Java and Coffee 2 the People being my favorites. But I've since grown wiser for the wear; free wireless is hard to come by in this town. Recently I was in a sterile, tile-floored Starbuck's in the Castro where I was absolutely appalled that they wanted to charge me for wireless, on top of the exorbitant price of my soy chai. Even otherwise top-notch (in my opinion) joints like Blue Danube on Clement haven't learned to share the WiFi love...\n\nSo a few weeks ago they opened a Peet's on Geary and 16th, one block from my Royal Ground. The joint that occupies the circle of chain coffee house hell just above Starbuck's. In comparison, Royal Ground only looks better. Viva la free wireless!", "author": "Lisa T."}

That being said, I decided that I really was not a huge fan of Royal Ground since the basics, like not falling into the foundation of a building, making tasty coffee, service with a smile (okay, fine, I'm not picky....at least without a scowl) were not a big concern of this chain.\n\nImagine my surprise when I walked into the Geary location and they had a floor...yes, you heard me right, they actually had a fully intact floor!

A lot of people come out here to study together so I always bring my ipod in case some people are studying algebra together two feet away.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-04-05", "description": "The Royal Ground on Geary has a pleasant aura that combines abundant natural lighting, sprinklings of green plants,  and a touch of nostalgia.  It's overall layout and decorative schema are what one might call \"busy\";  Just about every bit of available wall space is either windowpane, wall mural, artwork, or a backdrop for leafy green plants.\n\nThe crowd is sizable, solitary,  and remarkably free of posers.  One lone soul perused the pages of a paperback, while the rest of the clientele stared rapt into the glowing LCD's of laptop computers.  Strangely enough, nobody in the place was packing an Ipod...and unlike the Mission coffee shops I've been to, everyone had a PC while nary a soul had a Powerbook.  Light chitchat was taking place at small tables to the West end of the place, but the silence in couch area was extreme.  I've been to solitude-centric coffee shops that host lonely souls yearning for idle chat.  Others house solitary patrons that willingly eschew conversation, rarely gazing up from their task at hand.  But here at Royal Ground, it felt like there was an unwritten but universally accepted code of silence...one I felt I'd be breaking if I dared to chat up the fairly attractive woman that I bumped elbows with as I sat next to her on one of the love-seats.\n\nWindows that form most of the north and east walls combine with sizable green plants and a row of atrium-style windows towards the ceiling, giving a very airy, almost greenhouse-like ambiance to the whole arrangement.  A bank of four overhead ceiling fans add to it's outdoorsy vibe.  Large wall murals reminiscent of an early-Monet take up most of the wall space in the corners.  Alcove-like tables separated by load-bearing beams and smaller plants create zones of isolation for more reclusive customers, while a duo of opposed love-seats creates a pit that tries....and fails...to encourage interaction between strangers.  Two rent-a-PC's sit along side a small library towards the Northwest corner, while a dark hardwood floor is populated with tables and chairs that are broken in but not broken down.\n\nThe staff is friendly and helpful.  Pastries are standard issue, and the coffee is somewhat below par.  The music is soft, not too loud, and a pleasant mix of somewhat-hip and slightly-behind-the-times.\n\nNice place. Great decor. Run-of-the-mill coffee, and third-party supplied snacks.  Beautiful people won't talk to you, but blathering idiots won't mess with you either.  It's a spot to read rather than rabble, and to chill rather that to chat. It's a good place to waste time, but a mediocre place to stimulate the olfactory senses.  And while some may like the vibe, it's a little quiet for my tastes....", "author": "Mike W."}

Being a solid believer in supporting privately owned coffeeshops, even when I am not hungry or thirsty, I took a few minutes trying to decide what I would like to eat while looking through some files on my computer. 10 minutes later, I was rudely interrupted by one of the workers who loudly asked, \"Are you going to buy anything?\" Shocked and taken off guard I said, \"Uuuh, yes, can I wait a few minutes?\" She responded by saying, \"Yeah, but your using our internet, so...\" and walked away. Considering even your oldest PC (I'm a Mac gal) doesn't need internet for Word, all I could do was give her my \"are you for real?!!\" look.\n\nThough I should have left, I tried to ignore the rude woman and order tea and carrot cake. after being a snot and taking a minute to serve me, I received my mediocre \"treats,\" only to discover there was mold on the cake.
