OK, 'stumbling' is not the right word because I'm always seeking out menudo. My tripe obsession needs to stop, but I continue on my quest in the wilds of the Tenderloin. OK, it's not that wild on this stretch of Larkin, just a little gamey if you know what I mean. Funny thing is I've discovered all sorts of meals in the vicinity - Little Henry's Italian Food, Aria Korean American Snack Bar, Yemeni's - not all great but interesting culinary adventures.\n\nAnyway, I came here with the hope of menudo, but alas, it was not meant to be as I was there on a Monday evening, and they weren't willing to gather some bone scraps for me. Instead, I went for the large $8.99 bowl of Caldo de Res, beef soup to all you monolingual peons, and while not quite as chewy as a satisfying bowl of menudo, it came close with big chunks of tender beef and vegetables (including chayote) treading in a hearty broth (photo: http://bit.ly/17wJ3j5).

I came here for lunch while walking on Larkin Street and was craving for pupusas. Fortunately, the service for ordering food and getting a table to sit at was quick. This is my second time trying out pupusas in SF, and so far I'm still a fan. \nI ended up ordering 2 pupusas (~ $5.99) and horchata (~ $ 2-3). The horchata is house made and tasted refreshing with the right amount of sweetness. The server gave me free chips & salsa, too, which is nice. Overall, the meal was pretty tasty. \nIf you're close by on Larkin or NobHill area, check this place out for an inexpensive and delicious quick meal. I might try out their fish tacos and burrito next time.", "author": "Vivian L."}

We (a group of 4) waited about 35-40 minutes for our 8 to-go pupusas, so it's best to call ahead! The pupusa with chicharron y queso is my favorite - it definitely had more cheese than chicharron in it but was still delicious. We were too far from the Mission to get pupusas there, but this was a good alternative since we were really craving them. Yes, the customer service could use some help; however, the one woman helping everyone had wayyy too much on her plate. She was taking orders on the phone, hostessing, serving food to everyone at the restaurant, busing and helping prepare all the to-go orders. We kindly asked for cups of water and the woman rolled her eyes at us and told us it would be extra charge which is fine, but they should consider having a jug of water and an area for people to pick out their utensils and napkins for the to go orders. The place seemed a bit stingy, so I'm not sure if they'd consider doing that. Overall, the pupusas get the 4/5 stars in this review.

She didn't even acknowledge us. After we seated ourselves, she walked over and her attitude completely changed. She was now smiling and being very polite. I can understand why she was rude in the beginning since she was the only waitress working and the restaurant was packed. We ordered the carne asada fries and soft shell fish tacos. The portion of fries was huge! They were topped with guacamole, ooey gooey cheese, jalapenos, onions, sour cream, and of course, carne asada! Only downside: the fries were pretty greasy. I'm guessing they are freshly made on site. The fish tacos weren't bad. I believe they used tilapia and sauteed it with onions and red bell peppers. They each come with huge slices of avocado, too! \n\nOverall, the food was decent and the employees are really nice. The waitress was really bogged down so the chef ended up bringing my tacos out and he was really nice too. We waited a pretty long time for our orders to be taken and again for our food to come out, but it was lunch time so it was understandable. The waitress apologized multiple times for the wait, which I really appreciated. 3.5 stars! If I do come back in the future, I'd love to try the pupusas since Yelpers have raved about them.\n\nBtw, cash only. We only noticed after we sat down, and by then it would have been rude to leave. Luckily, I had some cash on me!!", "author": "Audrey T."}

Been putting it off but here it goes - I have been coming since this place opened. Was super excited to have some Pupusas in the neighborhood. I'm glad Olivo's seems to be doing well, I imagine the family has busted much butt, and I am really glad they've remained open and running in the pit hole block they are on. Really, no one does well in this location, you have to stand out.\n\nI'm there less frequently lately (well the past year) for a reason. The quality is going downhill. Upon the their grand opening, it would take a little while to get Pupusas out but I honestly think it was because it was done with a lot more care - I assume high standards for the food were set. I won't speculate why, but it just seems like that has changed. The food is still good, they need to stay around.\n\nThis location has seen way too many small eateries fail. Olivo's has held strong and has gained loyalty, They dont need to be perfect - but I wish they'd show a little more welcome to customers and make the food super awesome again.

Lo' an behold, my friends told me they had gotten some of these forsaken fries in the City so the first thing on my checklist was to try them out.  Verdict?  WHATEVERS.\n\nMaybe I'm used to socal's pound of fries slathered in thick guacamole, cheddar cheese, spicy salsa, cut-up onions, refried beans, creamy sour cream... but seriously? Seriously?  You call that carne asada fries?  It's an insult to one of CA's best Mex-American foods!  It's like the super small, classier (andy by classier I mean, less portions cuz you know how those fancy restaurants do it), won't fill you up version that you possibly might want to eat with a date (no date I'm gonna go on mind you).  I was craving those HUGE, heavy, eat til you drop until all that's left are mushed up ingredients that probably look very similar to what's already in your stomach.  For $6.99, I could very well get quadruple of what I got down there down in socal.  \n\nMy friend and I got the pupusas as well because they were a completely different color (light blue) from the rest of the Christmas color coded menu.  If there's something on the menu that is a different color from the rest, obviously it's highlighted for a reason, amirite?  Don't be fooled.  I ordered the cheese and pork pupusa and the bean and cheese pupusa.  My friend ordered the loroco (vegetable) and cheese.  If you've never had pupusas, they come with a little salad/radish mixture to top off the pupusas.  The pupusas were good on their own but they were nothing like the ones in the hood of eastbay where the owner didn't speak a lick of English, which means you know it's good.  The salad was missing that vinegary kick so we ended up dousing our pupusas in tapatio to get it down our throats.  \n\nAll in all, I say save your money and go somewhere else for your carne asada fries and pupusas.", "author": "Tori Q."}

I have to admit I haven't had the nerve/appetite to order the carne asada fries yet but they look fabulous, and judging from the near-orgasmic sounds coming from the next table where two friends were sharing them, they taste even better!\n\nNow a word for those mean people complaining about the \"service\":  this place is open 12 hours a day, six days a week, and I have a suspicion that some of the family members work the entire time.  The older woman behind the counter both times I went has a \"Grumpy Cat\" type of face, probably from a hard, tiring life and having to deal with the riff-raff in the neighborhood stumbling in and giving her a hard time (she has to put the tip jar behind the counter as there have been so many \"grab and go\" thefts from it).

Heck, say \"hello\", or \"thank you\", or anything!!)\n\nLet me remind you -- you work in the service industry.  Your job is to serve customers.  Get over it.  Or get a new job.\n\nHer mom (I'm assuming) is actually a *bit* more friendly, but this attitude appears to run in the family...\n\nAnyway, yes, I'll be back for more burritos.  And yes, I will continue to try to get you to lighten the f up and smile, (but I realize I will likely continue to fail miserably at that task...)\n\nAnd Kathleen M, it's nice you are are so forgiving of the clear lack of general friendliness (that only helps one run a more successful business).  I, however, do not have much love or respect for people that seem to hate their job, act like they hate their customers, and those who begrudgingly take your money as if they are \"entitled\" to it.

Totally worth it.\n\nShrimp Tacos - Also served in twos. Large amount of shrimp chopped into big chunks. Onions, cilantro, cheese, and a couple slices of avocado.\n\nBeef Soup - I get the half soup & pupusas meal. If you don't know, you put lime or lemon into this kind of soup, which Olivio's includes. They are very careful to give you a nice big piece of meat and a piece or two of each vegetable- corn, zucchini, carrots, cabbage, and either potato or yucca.\n\nCamarones Rancheros - Olivio's cannot be making money on this dish. 6 large, butterflied prawns in on of the tastiest \"Ranchero\" (tomatoes, onions, and bell peppers) sauces I've ever had. I spooned the excess sauce over the rice and pinto beans (also my favorite ever), then tilted the container to spoon up the last drops. Boyfriend also loves the shrimp dishes, and has their Camarones al mojo de ajo at least once a week.\n\nSteak - Big ass steak with onions, rice and beans. Or with fries. Or with plantains and beans. Or chopped with peppers, onions, and tomatoes, rice and beans. Or breaded and fried with rice and beans. Or shredded with eggs. Or shredded with peppers, plantains, and beans. Or with yucca and cabbage salad. Or with a cheese enchilada! ALL FOR $9.50-$10!!!!!!!\n\nChicken - I thought they gave me a ton of chicken. Then I realized there was yet a second layer beneath it. I think their fries are okay, but I prefer to have the pinto beans and their rice, which is super tasty. Or I have it with their yucca, which is kinda like gigantic french fries. The chicken is also available in many of the same preparations as the steak.\n\nAs if that weren't enough, Olivio's also offers several pork dishes, sole, tilapia, calamari, and crab enchiladas.

No complaints, just serious kudos for consistency and very reasonable prices.\n\nBreakdown...\n- 2 papusas made fresh for about $5.\n- 2 item combo w/ beans, rice and choices of buritto, enchilada, tostada, tacos & other choices for $7.50...I had carnitas buritto and a chicken taco\n- fiancee had a milenesa w/ fries for $8.50\n\nRice was perfectly cooked for spanish type of rice...pretty hard to do. Chicken was cooked on flat top similar to carnitas too make it a little crunchy; unique and good w/ a pile of guac on top.  Now we know milenesas well cause the GFs family is from S.

Bf and I were so hyped up to finally get our hands on carne asada fries in the city that it ended up in a big disappointment. I've never had a chance to experience it down south (SD), but from how my friend's have raved about how good it is there, I hope it's nothing like this. \n\n- Carne asada fries: piping hot soggy fries with an OD of cheese, fresh onions (yuck), jalapenos, sour cream, guac, and pieces of steak. I was only able to handle a few bites before I felt a little queasy from the overly cheesy mess (Artery clogging, fo sho!). Luckily, a can of Pepsi came to my rescue and washed it all down nicely. \n\n- Chicken Super Burrito: nothing to rave about. It came out really simple, but it was flavored mediocre at most. Rice, chicken, fresh onions (ugh!), guac, sour cream. I needed to use the spicy salsa that came with our chips to accompany it to make it more flavorful. \n\nThis restaurant looks like it only consists of a small hallway upon walking in, but they have additional seating in a room to the left.

The burritos are enormous and flavorful.  I must admit that they are heavy on the rice and beans, but all the better!  It's large enough where you still get an adequate amount of meat and other goodies.  My boyfriend and I usually just cut them in half--well, those few occasions where we managed to restrain ourselves--and save the rest for the next day.  Like many latin places, they serve chips and salsa with all their meals, including their to-go orders.  The only difference is that their salsa is yummy, flavorful, and made with love.

Not the cheapest of all Mexican food places, but definitely not going to cause major damage to your wallet. I got the carne asada fries con queso, sin guacamole, onions, jalapenos, etc., etc., etc. It just seemed like too much! So just meat, fries, and cheese.

(Don't forget, I'm a 4'11\", very petite Asian girl...and I came by myself.) It was pretty yummy, although my body can probably only handle it once or twice a year. Can you say \"heart attack on a plate\"? I finished almost half of it. The lady at the front asked me if I didn't like it. I told her I loved it, but it was just too big.

His family was El Salvadorian and I ate there almost every night.

The least I can say is I have a good idea. Their son Frank asked me if I've ever had Carne Asada Fries (which were on my plate), and of course I said I've never even heard of them, but they were off the hook. I was taking about 1/3 home and he said they are fresh cut and cooked and may not reheat very well. I gave it a shot with a touch of canola oil and they fried up med-brown and incredible). We had a split of 2 papusas, side of black beans and those Carne Asada Fries, and these pounds will not shed without a good, long session of something. \n\nBeverages are well priced (Sodas $1, 12oz Beers $2-3, 32oz beer $5). Meals are all around $10. Breakfast $6, Burrito's $6.\n\nA guy came in and ordered a burrito (obvioulsy a student) and he asked $5 (even though they are $5.95+)? And jose says... um yes $5. Nice. \n\nSo... I will be back.... and I will be back for the Carnitas!\n\nBy the way... I hate to say it but... Jose and Antonia's Papusas were better than anything i had in my youth.

Wrapped inside a tortilla is actually one of the few places I prefer meat to vegetables, and the carnitas at Olivo's makes my taste buds happy every time. It manages to have crispy edges while maintaining a deliciously tender, chewable texture, and partnering excellently with the smooth flour, flavorful rice, better-than-usual-quality cheese, fresh salsa, and delectable beans that make up the remainder of said burrito. Aside from the famous carne asada fries and signature pupusas, the nachos are solid alternative, with the same tempting components piled high on chips that actually have some body - so that you can taste more than a hint of corn -  instead of simply being a wafer-thin vehicle for condiments.\n\nThe staff are all incredibly friendly people, more than willing to accommodate a special request or recommend something to fill your stomach. The very first time I came here it was near closing time, and having failed to notice the prominent \"Cash Only\" signs, was only packing plastic. The lovely woman working the counter was nice enough to let me take my dinner away sans payment, and with only the promise of returning tomorrow with the eight bucks I owed. As a last note, while the transvestites that flock to the corner of Post and Larkin can be rather intimidating, I find that carrying an extra cigarette or two to hand out will turn them friendly in a hurry, although that has a tendency to make them think I want to proposition them - do I really look all that much like someone who would engage their services?", "author": "Alex B."}

That annoyed the heck out of me, so one day, as soon as I got off work - my buttocks drove out to Olivo's just so that i can sample the NorCal version of carne asada fries.\n\nIt's not on the menu - it's like one of those secret orders kinda things - so you have to ask for it. It took awhile to make it, and i have to say that i'm impressed. It will definitely satisfy my cravings for carne asada fries if ever i have a moment of weakness, and want it.\n\nThe only thing that was different was the amount of condiments on it. Guacomole could be more, and the fries could be a little bit bigger. But hey, you can't be picky about something that isn't as readily available as it is in SoCal, so I say, \"yay! i'm a fan of Olivo's carne asada fries!\" =)\n\nanyone wanna go?", "author": "J D."}

It definitely nothing like San Diego's but it's better than nothing. The fries are softer and there aren't as many toppings. What helps make carne asada great is the marinade which wasn't that impressive here. Meat was a bit more lean to my liking. This was my first time having pupusas so I didn't know what to expect. They weren't bad but they were not great either. I have to say my favorite dish was the California burrito. These were actually pretty flavorful and tasted great (though still not close to SD). One big plus is that Olivo's offers Mexican cola, which comes with real sugarcanes rather than syrup!\n\nOverall, this place is okay.

I love pupusas and feel the tenderloin is a trove full of tiny gems of restaurants - tiny gems which think they are rhinestones, specifically.\nWe split a dish of pupusas (pork & cheese and bean & cheese) and plaintains with beans.  -- You can probably tell, I'm a bean fan. \n\nThis was a family run restaurant and it felt like it.  The greetings were warm and friendly.  Questions were answered politely and there was a nice vibe.  While waiting for everything to arrive, we scoped out everyone else's food - there was a wonderful looking fried fish that I nearly snatched off an elderly woman's plate.  I will have to try it if I can ever bring myself to step away from the pupusas. \n\nThe food was hearty, very reasonably priced and tasty. It's not chez panise, but if you want some home style stick to your ribs food for under a fiver, you've got your spot.

Scrumptious Salvadorian food hand-made by a really sweet family.

They're not on the menu yet- but we asked for them and they delivered. They were fantastic- very lightly floured fresh chunks of very flavorful fish.

Though there was no crotch grabbing or anything that exciting.\nMy girlfriend and I are big fans of Salvadorian food, there are a few restaurants in Phoenix we go to. And Olivo's held up to the best of them.\nWe got the pupusas, pinto beans and rice. They were amazing, we had both the cheese and the bean and cheese. I had a couple of the Salvadorian beer Suprema, which was really good, too, light and almost sweet, like the other Salvadorian beers I have had. The chips and salsa were not bad, either, the salsa was hot and tasted fresh.\nAs we waited for our dinner, we could see the woman in the back making the pupusas by hand. It doesn't get any better than that. The family runs the restaurant, mother, father and daughter, which was obvious as soon as we walked in.\nWe had a choice of black, pinto or refried beans, so I assume there are vegan/vegetarian options.\nTo top it all of, our dinner, two meals, three beers was all less than $25.\nAnd to make a long story short, the food, service and prices are all phenomenal.

However, El Santaneca is in the middle of Egypt so unless my camel is handy, I'm not heading that direction regularly.\nOlivo's, conversely, is in my neighborhood a scant 3 blocks away.  Salivating eagerly and being in a sleep deprived state, I decide pupusas are absolutely necessary today.  I rolled into Olivo's knowing pretty much what I wanted: platanos con frijoles y crema (refried bean with plantains and sour cream) and a couple of pupusas.  I place my order after the waitress behind the counter sort of ignores me for a couple of minutes.  Umm, okay...(quick look around) not crowded.  So I start waiting.  And waiting. And waiting.  I notice that the waitress is pleasant to those customers that speak Spanish but kinda has an attitude with those of us speaking in English.  Now, I'm NOT racist and I'm completely respectful of other cultures but I don't feel like my inability to speak Spanish should disqualify me from better service.  My food finally arrives and I pay just under $10 for my platanos con frijoles y crema, pork and cheese pupusa and plain cheese pupusa. Side of salsa and some cabbage salad included.  \nI enjoyed the food but the pupusas at El Santaneca are more varied and the food a little better too.  However, I'll be back because it's a LOT better than most places in this 'hood for Latin cuisine.
