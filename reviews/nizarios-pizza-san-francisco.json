So to be fair, my review is slightly skewed because I was slightly intoxicated haha BUT I really do think the pizza is good. They have a lot of topping options available for their by the slice pizza, and they warm everything up for you after you order/purchase. The pizza itself has dough on the thicker side so don't expect a New York slice, but I honestly love a thicker dough so I didn't mind at all. And if you've been drinking like me, you'll want the extra dough!! The amount of toppings on the supreme was...a lot. Pepperoni, sausage and tons of peppers and onions. I was impressed. There were so many toppings that they kept falling off. 1 slice was very filling.\n\nIt's a small place so don't expect to find a seat to eat during busy times, but there are a few spots if you can snag em. The line went quickly and the staff were nice.", "author": "Bri T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-10-26", "description": "I liked the crust quite a bit. It was thick and chewy. Slices are reheated from full sized pies. I think that is why the toppings might be a bit bland. The green peppers came through nicely but everything else was kind of tasteless.  That includes the sausage. \nUnfortunately, I got heartburn before I even finished the slice. It lasted for hours. \nThe place is tiny. Service from the only employee was great. \nProbably best for late night quick bites.", "author": "Thomas D."}

Mealy cheese that was probably frozen, mediocre ingredients, overly salty olives, just a really bad pizza. And just barely warm at that. Toppings falling off all over the place...just really terrible.\n\nCan't believe living in SF I'd say this but you'd be better off with any chain delivery pizza (Pizza Hut, domino's, etc.) than this place.

It was a friend's 30th birthday, so the bf and I flew in to celebrate for the weekend. First stop after we dropped off our bags at the airbnb was Nizario's.\n\nA friend brought us here to get something in our bellies before a night of celebrating. It was our first time and we panicked as a line started to form behind us, so we just went with a classic. Pepperoni pizzas!\n\nNo pics to show since we had to eat fast to catch up with friends and also, the place is really small. You literally just grab, grub and go. There's a menu, but if you like to eat with your eyes, they have the pizzas ready to heat behind the glass. It takes less than 5 minutes to run through the oven and then you're set.\n\nThe slices are massive with plenty of cheese. The bf complained that it was greasy and didn't have enough pepperoni, but I didn't care. I just needed some carbs in preparation lol. For the price and its size, one slice was just enough to hold me through a night of drinking.", "author": "Jamie N."}

They breathe life into those stumbling out of the clubs and bars, many of whom know to leave at 1:45 just so they can snag a slice before closing time at 2am. \n\nNizario's is not just for drunchy attacks though. They're also a fun late night date spot where you can grab a giant slice of pizza and hunker down in the car with a great view and that special someone. Over the years, my pizza slices have made their way to Twin Peaks, the Golden Gate Bridge, and Turtle Hill. Sometimes they don't make it that far though :) \n\nMy go-to pizza is the California Special, which is a delicious combination of chicken, spinach, pesto, mozzarella, and feta cheese. The crust is on the thicker side with a nice chewy bite, but still has a slight crisp on the edge when it's fresh out of the oven. I'm not typically a crust eater, but I tend to polish off my slices here!\n\nNizario's is a small shop with very limited seating, so it's best to get your pizza to-go.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-14", "description": "I had the fortune of trying this little hole-in-the-wall this past weekend. Located right in the heart of the Castro, you can find a line here on many weekends and few parking options. Many patrons, I'm sure, will find other options along with busy corridor of San Francisco, but Nizario's is at least worth one's curiosity. \n\nHere, you have limited options for both meat and veggie lovers. For meat lovers you have your Hawaiian, pepperoni, and a few others. For veggie lovers, you have a cheese, mushroom, all-out veggie, and a pesto as well. The pizza's here are warmed up as you order, and ready-make from hours of prep to meet their peak periods. Please note their pizzas are pan-style, and not thin crust, or deep dish like your Dos Minos folks may push onto you. Here, you get what they have, and that's really it. What they have, however, is quite delicious and simple. \n\nI tried the pesto pizza, which was cooked to perfection. The crust was buttery enough, and the cheese wasn't melting off my plate. I was able to bite in with ease, and taste the subtle flavors of pesto as cheese oozed between my bite and the remaining slice. It was so satisfying, somehow, that I went back for another slice. \n\nIf you're in the area, consider all the great options, but also consider Nizario's for their basic and cheap after hour eats.", "author": "Mohib Q."}

And every time I come, I have to wade through the sea other other drunkards only to stumble up to the counter and have the dilemma of my life in choosing what type of pizza I want. What I think is great about this place is that no matter what, they will always heat your pizza for you. This is in stark contrast to Pizza Orgasmica, where you have wait in an endless line in a super hot entry way only to be served a thin, cold slice of pizza where the cheese oils have created a congealed layer of disgustingness. (Side note I don't understand why every one raves about that place; the pizza is pretty crappy, particularly if you've had to endure the throngs of drunk, obnoxious Marina-ites in their infinite line). Nizario's is fast, their dough is good (doughy in the middle, slightly crisp on the bottom) and their prices are quite average, which is fine. \n\nNow, I thought that this was simply a drunken revelation; warm, gooey pizza is always delicious when wasted. However, last night, I was shown that this place is pretty damn good sober. Maybe it was because I was starving and had had a really shitty day, but nevertheless, it was yum. And, for the first time in my experience, it was empty. I guess all the drunks were waiting until later to invade(although, it was already near 10). Try the Castro special: spinach, feta, chicken, and pesto. mmmmm. Or the super combo, which basically has everything on it. I'm not saying this is the best pizza in the world, but it hits the spot when you need it. Major plus: the people working there are super friendly, even when you're near belligerent.", "author": "Veronica W."}

When I paid he counted, handed me back my 50 cents and yelled \"NEXT!\"  It was only me and only one other person standing behind me.  Never said anything to me or made any attempt to show he appreciated my business.\n\nThe pizza was the worst.   Reheated yet still not fully cooked.  Raw and gooey dough just under the sauce and slightly bitter overall.  I might have overlooked the nasty pizza as a fluke but combined with the attitude, it told me that these people don't really care about customers or their product.\n\nAvoid this place like the plague.

I used to love the \"San Francisco\" but over time i'm getting less cheese, spongy  half cooked dough and the slices are as limp as banana peels. ALSO - PRICES ON THE WEBSITE ARE DEAD WRONG. It's pretty shady when they refuse to spend a nickel to update the website. The small reads $12.90 but you will be charged $13.90 upon delivery. I questioned the discrepancy and the main guy confirmed the website has yet to be updated. On a more positive note - they are by far the fastest to delivery in the Mission/Castro area. It takes 15-30 minutes on average. I will gladly order from them again but they need to bring back quality and update the website.", "author": "Shady B."}

I use normal pepperoni as my yard stick for pizza places and this one is right on target. Always perfectly sauced, the sauce isn't too sweet either. But other than that the castro special is what you come here for. Creative flavors perfectly executed...yes it is possible to make better pizza but it would be like trying to tell the difference between a 60 dollar and 300 dollar bottle of wine, 99% of the world just cant do it.", "author": "Gavin M."}
