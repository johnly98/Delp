There were 19 courses, and due to the events of the day I did not arrive hungry, unfortunately. I still got through all of the courses, but I am sure I would've enjoyed them more if my stomach was a bit more empty. Still, everything was quite enjoyable.\n\nThe most delicious stands out for me were the yuca taco with uni, the soup with saffron and gooseberry, the barbacoa with wagyu beef cheek, and the plantain bread. The uni was very creamy, and the soup was warming and bursting with comforting flavors. I could eat the plantain bread all day.", "author": "James K."}

The other seating is a lot darker whereas the chef's table is well lit and you get to see all the action!\n\nAnother recommendation is that if you plan on drinking, just go for the drink pairing which will cost an additional $120pp but is well worth it since I got two drinks and the tab already ran me $60 more dollars.\n\nFun experience and would recommend!!", "author": "Linda X."}

Not to mention, the out-of-this-world flawless service.\n\nCalifornios has perfected the art of timing, presentation, unique flavor combinations that is becoming harder and harder to find in most Michelin-star restaurants. Comparing to other experiences over the years with others that have made the list, you can almost always find the service lacking or under-compensating in some form. By that I mean friendly, humble people who pay attention to detail. \n\nThere was barely a moment that passed once a dish was finished or a glass was drained that the next form of cutlery or wine pairing was out to dazzle. From wiping the wine label clean for a better visual of the wine specifics to allowing us to \"pick our weapon\" for the lamb course, the staff made it feel like I was part of an exceptional experience.\n\nModern looks and music, no pretenses or fuss with stuffy decor. You'll go the first 7-8 courses without silverware, if you can believe it! It's precisely the way you should want every Michelin-star to behave.\n\nMoving onto the culinary excursions and the wine itself; the pairings were unusually delightful. A sour beer served alongside a rich broth? More please. Grilled asparagus to mate with a difficult Gr\u00fcner Veltliner? Who knew there was such a match in heaven! (P.s. the bright green notes together tasted like Sweet Tarts or Gummie Bears and highly recommend you try this combo at home with dinner guests!). The famous tres frijoles is as stellar as they say and I still can't stop talking about my first sourdough tortilla with pigeon and mole. You stole my heart with a Rioja Tempranillo to go with the most exceptionally rare lamb chop and now all I want to do is go back to Spain.\n\nMy only advice, make sure you go wash your hands after the smoked hen-of-the-woods mushroom taco. It was a bit too smoky for my tastes and it will overpower the next few dishes that you'll eat with your hands.\n\nFull disclosure: I had a non-seafood adjustment and they were wonderfully accommodating. All you have to do is call advance after you book your reservation online if you have any allergies.", "author": "Alita M."}

The 3 hour meal consisted of about 16 courses, each meticulously created and wonderfully delicious. And that is no small feat. Often at upscale restaurants, I find that there are a couple of courses that just don't taste good even if they look great and a couple of courses where the plating is pretty but insanely impractical for eating. Every single course here was fantastic.\n\nSince there are so many plates, expect the bites at the beginning to be very small. It does take a while before you start to feel full so I recommend making an early dinner reservation like we did. \n\nMy favorite of the night was one of the first - a mushroom taco on a handmade blue corn tortilla. The earthiness from the mushroom medley was beautiful and quite \"meaty.\" This was one of three taco presentations during the meal. Halfway through, we were served a delicate hard-shelled uni taco. Yum! And toward the end, we had a make-you-own-squab-taco course.\n\nCalifornios celebrates Mexican heritage and interprets it in its own way. One of the desserts was essentially a churro with Mexican hot chocolate but this is no ordinary churro, it is a decadent foie gras churro. Heaven!", "author": "Yi Z."}

This amazing restaurant earned both of its Michelin stars and will truly impress you and your guests with one of the best experiences I have ever had in a restaurant. The restaurant is on 22nd near Mission with little exterior signage near several dive bars and colorful characters. BART is close and a fun walk.\n\nYou need to reserve and pay online well in advance for dinner here. I was able to snag an early reservation and was somewhat surprised by the low cost of the meal, although the beverage pairing was nearly as much as the food. At 5:30, I opened the heavy door and entered an upscale speakeasy with an open kitchen. After a greet and check in, I was escorted to the chef's counter to begin my journey.\n\nIt is hard to describe the next two hours since the menu changes all the time. The dinner had 19 servings of various small plates, amuses, and cleansers designed to really push the envelope of Mexican inspired cuisine with a gourmet California theme. The beverage pairings included wine, beer, and several surprises which worked very well with the items. Pairing wine with spicy food is a real art.\n\nThe food was just spectacular. The scallop chicharron, torched mandarin, mushroom mole taco, and winter vegetable aquachile were very unique and delicious. The fried fish, wagyu carne asada, and smoked squab were true gourmet quality. The macadamia nut sorbet with fresh pear and dulce de leche was both real and spectacular!\n\nIt is no understatement to say that the best parts of the meal were the tamale, beans, and churro. Of course the tamale used specially grown corn masa ground for hours into a near fudge consistency stuffed with perfect beans and cheese. The bean dish is beyond words with cooked whole beans topped with pur\u00e9ed and whipped beans and caviar bringing the concept to another level. The churro is made with foie gras in the batter and in the icing and served with a small Mexican chocolate and coffee liqueur cocktail making this signature dish crazy delicious.\n\nOf course, the staff and chefs here are near perfection. Service was warm and personal with great attention to detail. Sitting at the chef's counter allowed me to see the care and skill of the young, fun, and inked chefs having fun watching me savor their creations. Everything was paid online in advance, so there was no bill or any fuss after the meal.\n\nCalifornios is a fancy gourmet Mexican restaurant that should be on everyone's bucket list. This is an excellent date night place or perfect place to take the parents or guests. It is intimate and fun with a unique and eclectic menu that really forces you to reevaluate your definition of Mexican food. These guys are really cooking up something special in the Mission.", "author": "Kristian D."}

One of the personal goals I set for myself this year was to eat at all of the 33 Michelin-starred restaurants within the San Francisco city limits and Californios was number 30 out of 33. At this point in my culinary journey, I've become really, really picky but I'm glad to report that this restaurant is definitely in my top 3 so far (the other two are Quince and Atelier Crenn).  \n\nWhat I really love about this menu is that it was incredibly balanced and there was a great respect for ingredients and rhythm to the meal (similar to Japanese kaiseki) while also providing great desserts (to me, the weakest part of Japanese kaiseki meals are the desserts at the end).  Not everything was perfect but the combination of dishes and flavors just work. \n\n(1).  Canap\u00e9s included scallop ceviche, crab tostada, black barley chicharron with smoked\ngoat cheese - served with a refreshing cucumber agua fresca (5/5) - damn good start to the meal.\n(2). Taco ensemble including uni (Santa Barbara), A5 wagyu, smoked mushrooms and squab (5/5) - amazingly, the mushrooms easily beat the others. \n(3).  Palate cleanser included guava sorbet with pineapple juice and bee pollen (5/5). \n(4).  The next three courses included kiwi, kampachi ceviche and asparagus with trout roe (3/5) - good dishes but not stand-outs relative to similar dishes at other restaurants in the city. \n(5.). Smoked chicken broth (5/5) - I really appreciate that they had a consomm\u00e9 in the middle of the meal to prepare you for the coming richer courses. This broth was just perfect. \n(6).  Next came their signature dish - tres frijoles with caviar (3.5/5) - the beans were great with the caviar but this is not the most memorable thing on the menu (other restaurants have signature dishes that are memorable like the ridged pasta with foie, black truffle and Marsala at Acquerello or the Kir Breton at Atelier Crenn).  \n(7).  White sturgeon grilled robata style with grilled cabbage (5/5) - the glaze on the sturgeon was unexpectedly perfect.\n(8).  Lamb with morels (3/5) - acceptable lamb dish but most of the Michelin-starred restaurants in the city serve amazing lamb dishes (the best one I've had was at Lazy Bear) and this was middle of the pack. \n(9).  I ordered the marshmallow tea with chamomile before the sweet courses (4/5) - this was nice and complemented the desserts well. \n(10).  The desserts included churro, strawberries and pecans (5/5) - these were inventive and great and not too heavy.  I would have loved to have gotten some mignardises but I was perfectly content with these three things. \n(11).  The meal started with proseco (great meals start with some bubbly) and ended with some agave (unique and nice touch).  \n\nThe outstanding dishes for me were the smoked mushroom taco, the smoked chicken broth and the glaze on the sturgeon.  \n\nService was impeccable and I am very grateful to have been seated at the bar.  It's like dinner and a show - it was a real treat to see the chefs meticulously prepare each course and chef Will was also very engaging (a treat for solo diners).  The place is immaculate and I really love the upscale but not stuffy vibe of this place.  It's also a tremendous value compared to some of the other restaurants at this caliber (Atelier Crenn, Quince, Benu, Coi, Saison).

There are no other Mexican restaurants with two michelin stars in the county, so it's the best you will get in the USA.   This past xmas, I ate at Quintonil and Pujol in Mexico City, and this is on par with those places.   I would still rank Quintonil as the gold standard, but Californios is better than Pujol imho.\n\nI like the space.   Kind of small, but intimate without feeling too enclosed or claustrophobic.   We sat at the chef's counter which is highly recommended if you are flying solo or a party of two.   I love watching all of the chefs prepare my food.   It's like tv!\n\nThe menu was roughly 18 courses, so I will not describe every single dish, so I will hit on some highlights, but all of it was great.\n\nThe openers they serve you are a great way to start a meal.   Scallop tostada, some crab and blood orange thing, agua fresca, and some weird chicharron made from barley and some other vegetative material.  All were fantastic.\n\nNext were the tacos.   Once was uni, one was mushroom and one was squab.   It's hard to pick a favorite, but the squab was served with this AMAZING mole dipping sauce that I am still dreaming about.\n\nThere was also this kampachi ceviche that was cured in smoked nopales.   There were pieces of the nopales folded into the kampachi, which was thinly sliced and wrapped into a butterfly shape.   The best part honestly was the juice/sauce which had hints of the nopales, citrus and celery.\n\nAsparagus in poblano sauce with roe.   Enough said.\n\nTres frijoles - This seems to be a dish that never leaves the menu.   Three layers of bean preparations and topped with caviar.   Really great (although cannot top the beans they served at Quintonil, of course)\n\nCarne Asada - wow!   Perfectly cooked piece of wagyu, topped with truffle \"mole\" and served with a confit aged potato all with shaved black truffle on top.   Really rich and luxurious.\n\nChurro with plantain - Great!\n\nPear dessert - one of the best desserts I have ever had.   Pear ice cream with dulce de leche served on top of macadamia nut butter.   Divine!\n\n\nService, of course, was on point (as you would expect) and the overall experience was impeccable.   The sommelier didn't exactly knock into the stratosphere, but the pairing was very nice and recommended (sorry to keep bringing up Quintonil, but their somm is a GOD, and i can't help but compare every pairing to that these days). \n Recommended if haute Mexican is your jam and you can't make it to Mexico City!", "author": "Christian C."}

Erick T. and I came here in July 2017 to celebrate our 3 year anniversary and were pleasantly surprised with our delectable meal. The tasting menu consisted of 19 courses and additional palette cleansers, lasting for a total of 3 hrs of your night.\n\nMy highlights: pretty much everything. I was really impressed with the innovation and creativity Chef Cantu puts into his dishes. He takes the flavors and ideas of the traditional Mexican cuisine and interprets it in his own way to maximize the purity of flavor and choice of ingredients. For example, a handmade blue corn tortilla taco, ceviche with coconut pur\u00e9e, even crickets!! You know my mouth was still watering for more at the end of the meal.\n\nHowever, many people question the price point for traditional Mexican food, including me and Erick T. We initially left the restaurant telling ourselves this, but I've come to realize Californios is probably the only Michelin I crave to come back to. I'm a picky reviewer and more often than not, I find myself disliking a few plates of tasting menus. My satisfaction with the total number of dishes is part of my scorecard, and I'm happy to say there wasn't a single dish I didn't like at Californios unlike other Michelins.

The wine pairing was $95 extra per person but neither one of us wanted to drink that much so we split one.  There was a slight split wine pairing fee but it was much better as we both got to taste the carefully crafted pairings which truly made the whole experience better without overdoing it. \n\nWe ended up having 14 courses but there was no way we could keep track of the number as the pace was perfect that we never seemed to waiting too long but also had enough time to savor each dish.\n\nThe food was Mexican inspired but the dishes were elegant that I often forgot that while I was enjoying the food. \n\nMy highlights:\n- Lobster taco, delicately sweet and topped with chili butter sauce.\n- Coconut pur\u00e9e with texture that was unbelievably smooth, matched perfectly with a Smaragd Riesling (Austria).  \n- Well seasoned crispy fried black cod, moist inside with a great verde sauce.\n- A5 wagyu beef from Japan combined with even more flavorful grilled mushrooms.  \n- Smoky squab with a duck like flavor but not as chewy texture.  Pure delight.  This was one of my favorites.\n\nThe 3 wait staff that circulated and introduced us to each dish were all so knowledgeable about the wines and the pairings were the best I've had in recent memory.

There were four different types of masa served, all with a regional story and individualized nuances.  The vanilla ice cream was just created by the pastry chef days ago, super smooth and intense, best ever to pass these lips.\n\nReservations are through the Tock ticketing system, it was just under $600 for two including wine pairings.

I felt like I just walked into my playlist, so that was pretty cool. \n\nThe menu is prefix, so the only thing to choose is the wine. The meal started with a lot of small bites/finger foods, so many that I thought I'd never see a utensil. Each one of the dishes were elegantly presented and featured a Mexican or South American ingredient. I also liked that they treated the veggies with as much care as the proteins, I thought the veggies were the bigger highlight in some dishes. \n\nThe service was relaxed, but definitely professional. The people bringing the food to the table were generally good about providing information about the source of the ingredients and some even provided tidbits about the people who produce the ingredients which was interesting. Only one of our waiters was a bit lacking in that department, only stating either the type of wine or the name of the winery, which we could have read ourself on the bottle. \n\nThe only awkward part was that a 20% service charge is automatically included (we were a party of 2). Only reason this was awkward was that he receipt still has a tip line, so it feels awkward putting $0 tip if you feel that 20% is already appropriate.", "author": "Angelito R."}

The experience here was better than the French Laundry in service, food and value. I stopped counting courses because just as you thought it was over - there was more! I had so many favorites it is hard to choose - the wagyu beef with the fermented Peruvian purple potato and Perigord truffle dish was superb - savory, slightly sour, earthy umami - just ridiculous; the wine pairing of old Riesling with the smoked wild mushroom taco - heavenly goodness; the mole with the meat taco was also outstanding. There was certainly nothing remotely bad - everything was at least good - at best unforgettable. What are the experience even more pleasant was the overall friendly vibe from every single staff person - presided over by the amazing chef Cantu. This is an evening to remember, savor and reminisce about for years to come. My dining partner and I had a love affair with the entire kitchen crew.", "author": "Ludy V."}

I went and there was a collaboration dinner on the menu with a chef from Oaxaca (apparently costed more than what I paid for so I thought it would blow my mind). Frankly, for $230 and 2 Michelin stars, it was very disappointing. I did a 6:30pm seating, and didn't end up leaving until 11:20pm, which was way too dragged out to the point where I was falling asleep at the table. \n\nThe service for our table was pretty bad, as I watched the table next to us that arrived 1.5 hours later finish before us.

We had a reservation for a table at 9 (two people). We arrived at 9 and were asked to sit in their waiting area. Three minutes later we were told we could have a seat at the chef's counter...and that our table would be ready soon. So we went to the chef's counter/bar (PS the space is small- these areas are steps from one another aka, we should've just stayed put in their waiting area). Already situated at the chef's counter/bar, when our table was ready- like 5 minutes later, we asked if we could just stay there. The hostess said yes. How do I know the timing so well? Time stamp on food photos, duh. First photo was taken at 9:09. \n\nAs the courses were arriving we were asked if we wanted to move to a table. We said no. Midway through our meal we were asked to move our stools over to the middle of the bar \"for our comfort.\" Weird. Shortly after, we were asked if we wanted to move to a table again. I found all of that really off putting. Do you want us to move to a table? Were we being loud/obnoxious/distracting/too close to the food (did my hair fall into a sauce??)/having too good a time? :( \n\nAll of that said, the experience was most definitely EXCELENTE. Food was *awesome* everything was incredible and Chef Cantu (Food & Wine's 2017 Best New Chef aka Badass) was gracious in indulging our absurd questions. He also very kindly took photos with other patrons. Really cool vibe overall- front of the house was super friendly and attentive. My only advice, don't eat at the chef's counter/bar. :)", "author": "Maria F."}

Sorry, Lazy Bear, Wako, ju-ni, and Liholiho Yacht Club. Compared to other famous Michelin-starred restaurants in San Francisco, Californios sort of flies under the radar so I hadn't heard much about them and did not know what to expect.\n\nIf you manage to snag a reservation when they open up a month in advance, that's half the battle. Our Uber driver dropped us off right in front, and had I not seen pictures of the exterior on Yelp, I would have never guessed the unassuming, dark building with covered windows was the restaurant.\n\nThe staff took our coats, warmly wished us a happy anniversary, and sat us at the chef's counter as my girlfriend requested when she made the reservation. From our seats, we watched in awe as each chef prepared the different courses in perfect unison. We watch enough Top Chef to understand the challenges of working in a small kitchen area and needing to prep multiple dishes at a time with pinpoint precision. You truly get the sense that the chefs are giving each dish their all. When a dish arrives in front of you, you get an explanation of its inspiration, where they source the ingredients, and the techniques with which it was prepared.\n\nWhat sets Californios apart from the pack for me is how they are doing their take on Mexican dishes - infusing traditionally Mexican tastes with fine dining. You just can't experience this cuisine anywhere else in the city. Each dish was a revelation, and I cannot remember another meal I have had where every dish was memorable and left me wanting more.", "author": "Olivia V."}

It's easily in my top 3 restaurants I've been to. \n\nI'll start with the ambience. The interior was small but roomy. There are no more than 5-8 tables inside, as well as a bar area where you can sit in front of the chefs.  The walls have colorful Mexican art adorning them, and in the background upbeat hip hop, rap, and pop are playing. \n\nThe result is a really unique feel - it's casual, fun, and lively, yet still has the professional polish of a typical Michelin restaurant. \n\nThe food was insanely good. They don't give you the menu until the very end, and as a result the entire dinner is a surprise, which I really liked. \n\nI can honestly say I loved every single item on the menu. Standouts were a wagyu steak cooked in a truffle mole, a crab and herb tostada, a squab soup, a foie gras churro, a make your own squab taco dish, and an after dessert \"cherry coke\" aperitif. \n\nBut, to be honest, everything was amazing. It is the most consistently good Michelin restaurant I've ever been to - at others I've often had one or two dishes which were \"meh\". \n\nThe food is also very unique. It can best be described as upscale Mexican, but in a way I've never really had before. This made the meal exceedingly interesting and delightful. \n\nFinally, the service was great. The staff were attentive, explained things well, and were very friendly. \n\nThe fact that you get all this at a price less than most Michelin restaurants in the city makes this a no brainer. I can't recommend this restaurant enough.", "author": "Davis T."}

Phenomenal!!! Even their so-called palate cleanser was amazing. The food, from standards including asparagus or carne asada, to more inventive dishes, were mind-blowing. Loved their creative combination of flavors and textures, which always came back to the main theme. Ingredients were fresh and thoughtfully chosen. The desserts were also fantastic. And of course, presentation was great as well. We received copies of the menu in nice envelopes with our names on them -- something I wish more places would do!\n\nAmbiance: Cozy and hip without being stuffy as some fancier establishments can tend to be. Bonus: there was enough light to see without affecting the ambiance -- what?!?!\n\nService: Service from start to finish was phenomenal. Everybody working here was genuinely friendly, without the air of pretentiousness that, again, is prevalent in some of the higher end establishments. Most importantly, the entire team was extremely attentive without hovering or being intrusive. If we needed a refill, or had any questions or requests, staff would magically appear without us even needing to ask. Their timing is so impeccable, it was almost like wizardry.  \n\nPrice to quality ratio: I'm a cheapskate who loves food, so I'm especially picky regarding quality of the food as the prices go up.

So it's not just me. It may have just hit me 1000x harder since I'm pregnant.

Our menu consisted of:\n\nBotanas, Hielo, A-Chile, Papas, Caldo, Huevo, Halibu, Pato, Horchata, Pi\u00f1a, Dulces\n\n-Botanas/Snacks (Round 1: Oyster w/Nasturtium, Green Tomato Water & Chips and Dip: Yucca Chips, Smoky Goat Cheese, Trout Roe, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=NL234_IAVqkRBK99-kd8ZA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): They oyster was super fresh, and the yucca chip combination was very tasty.\n-Botanas/Snacks (Round 2: Purple Haze Asparagus & Corn Puff, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=vlej4TXY1bQ9OnTgQ65ssA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The asparagus had a great char and was seasoned well, and the corn puff was crunchy and interesting. \n-Botanas/Snacks (Round 3: Granita, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=JCkuKsTTiwR2zFf6sy3ICg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): I'm not a huge fan of granitas, but this version was pretty good, and very refreshing.\n-Hamachi Ceviche w/Serranos, Cilantro Blossoms (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=a4UihLsRVjG5KLo-UmrKVQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Delicious- the hamachi was super fresh. \n-Poached Potato (w/Dill Pomme Puree, Chipotle Adobo (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rEie8YLbAp_RKKR5DcjFdA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=vC3pjUa9qQYXIUn7S7PKng&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- the puree was very smooth and creamy, and the flavors went really well together.\n-Bread (Buckwheat Sourdough w/Flax Seeds, House Cultured Butter, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=kV7MGTIA52BHZk661F9NUg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Solid bread and butter combination, and I liked that they toasted the bread.\n-Smoked Egg Yolk (w/Peas, Jalapeno Grits, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=o9q-okzeG4COyrNVTJJAHw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The smoked egg yolk added a great richness, and the peas were perfectly cooked.\n-Soup (Chicken, Turnips, Herbs, Chicken Stock, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=gWwm1EWM9NHiCIJN4lBylQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Since this soup took 5 days to make, it's flavor was super concentrated. I'm not a big soup fan, so this was just ok for me.\n-Poached Alaskan Halibut (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=sDxgDvXH5I8-OPZ-Cx_UgA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The fish was cooked very well, and the flavors worked well together.\n-Grilled Gerard Farms Duck (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tl-aYfXuU0MKUVsiiD8vdA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Flavorful, but it was definitely served on the rare side, even for me.\n-Horchata Rice Ice Cream (w/Strawberry Sorbet, Strawberries, Mochi, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cphnm2-Ja6l5H5I0qaTz2g&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Not my favorite since I don't like the cinnamon flavor in horchata or sorbet.\n-Dessert Part 2 (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cRHzxw1RrL1LkM4ZvwRIrg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): I can't remember exactly what this was anymore, but remember the top part was frozen. I didn't think it was anything special.\n-Mignardises (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=03NDPY67qobpc1UdBLHlIg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): I LOVE when restaurants end a prix fixe with mignardises (unless its pate de fruit), and I enjoyed the caramels and cookies, but not the pate de fruit.\n\nService was great, and we thought it was a great meal overall. They raised their prices right after we went (it was an amazing deal when they first opened) but it's still reasonable for the quality and quantity of food. Highly recommended for a special occasion or fancy dinner with friends. Parking can be tough to find in this area, but there are spots on the street available.", "author": "Amy D."}

I initially booked an 8PM spot at the Chef's table, but I emailed the business to move the reservation up. \n\nWe were greeted with champagne and shared a wine pairing along with the September tasting menu which included a lot of beans & fresh fish. The A5 wagyu and salmon were my favorite dishes - however, they are hyper-local and hyper-seasonal, so definitely catch those two items this month! \n\nWe chatted with the chefs during the dinner (highly encourage chef's table) and took a picture with the head chef at the end of dinner.

I asked my gf to take me here for my birthday dinner and it couldn't have been more perfect.\n\nI've sent many people here when they ask where to go for an anniversary, birthday or parent dinner.\n\nThis is a fancy restaurant with refined food but they hold the pretension, just how I like it!\n\nTheir service is 100. Charlotte and Carolyn (they run this ship) have created and maintained an amazing atmosphere. The decor is fucking TIGHT. So cool and chic and hip. The curation of every single detail is superb. Even the bathroom is chic.\n\nCharlotte is the beverage director and boy, as diners we are lucky for that because I had the most perfectly paired meal of my entire life. When I took a bite of each dish i thought \"this is the best bite ever,\" but then when I sipped whatever drink was paired with it it made it even better! Not only that but Charlotte explained each drink in layman's terms for me and it just made me feel so comfortable and not like I was out of place in such a nice restaurant.\n\nChef Val is a fucking genius. Or an alien. His ability to elevate and refine Latin cuisine is something I've never ever seen on Earth. Every single dish was from another planet, in the best way. I can still remember the familiar feel every dish evoked. Each bite had that eye-closing mMmMing taste. \n\nHighlight: birthday bubbly on the house. Made me feel SO SPECIAL! Also, the foie gras ice cream dessert was basically booshy cookies and cream. Best dessert. Best dinner. Best birthday ever.\n\nI'll be back for our next special occasion for sure.", "author": "Taylor S."}

It was definitely different than your usual tasting menu given it's goal of elevating Mexican food to Michelin-level. \n\nThe three beans with caviar completely changed what I thought of beans. It can be used in haute cuisine.\n\nThe salmon preparation was also completely innovative which is impressive how often you probably have salmon. \n\nThe nectarine with a Japanese snapper fish was also very fresh and innovative.\n\nIt definitely is a very expensive tasting menu but if you're looking for something fresh and different this would qualify.

I can't believe that this place isn't more well-known! \n\nThere is a single menu that costs a reasonable $125 per person. I'd been meaning to come here for the longest time and finally convinced a friend to come with me yesterday. We were seated at the chef's counter and got to watch the magic happen. Is it embarrassing that I kept fawning over their teeny tiny pots and pans? I swear, the stuff that these chefs produced from that small kitchen is nothing short of magical.\n\nThe service was very friendly, polite, and attentive. They described each dish in detail as they brought them out - sadly, I didn't bother to take notes because I was told that we would receive a menu at the end of the meal. (spoiler: it's not helpful AT ALL :c )\n\nOur dishes, as recalled by my awful memory:\n- Pea Sprout Tostadas\n- Agua Fresca with a Shiso Coin\n- Fried Pork with Pickled Cucumber Taco\n- Fried Fish (?) Taco\n- Ceviche with Fish Roe and Avocado\n- White Strawberry Helado with Olive Oil\n- Yerba Buena (grilled seasonal vegetables)\n- Beans 3-Ways\n- Broth with Lime\n- Sous Vide Egg with Salsa and Caviar\n- Monterey Abalone with Tomatillo Broth\n- Trout with Tamarind Sauce and Peas\n- Sourdough Tortillas\n- Lamb with Charred Ramps\n- Mt. Tam Cheese Empanada\n- Wild Strawberry and Vanilla Flan\n- Yerba Buena Mint Ice Cream with Mexican Chocolate Sauce\n- Flautas with Dehydrated Apples, Foie Gras, and Crushed Peanuts\n\nEvery single dish was outstanding, but my favorites were the pork taco, beans (whipped beans!), trout, strawberry flan, and flautas. Trust me, the beans were transcendent.\n\nThis was my first exposure to Mexican fine dining and I'm hooked - I'll definitely be back for another meal!", "author": "Kelly L."}

You feel like you're part of a well-kept secret. We had a fantastic dinner here; almost every course (11 total) was a total hit, but there were a couple misses. Boy was it pricey too--you really have to justify spending like this! Worth it for a special occasion but I wouldn't make this a regular go-to spot.\n\nOnce inside, Californios feels like your distant rich uncle's Upper East Side living room, complete with bookshelves and real books. It's dark and it's plush. A little sparse, but they are new and still seem to be finalizing the look (I commented on a gold skull they had at the entrance and they'd just gotten it the day before). \n\nTHE WAIT: None at 8:00pm on a Thursday for four. They don't crowd the tables and give you plenty of room, so even with the large space, there were relatively few tables compared to some restaurants that barely give you elbow room between tables.\n\nTHE SERVICE: Great! The staff were friendly, knowledgable, and made the vibe more casual and comfortable (the price tag and the decor would otherwise have pointed to a more pretentious place). \n\nTHE COST: Pricey! $100 for the tasting, $45 for the drink pairing, all before tax/tip.\n\nTHE FOOD: There's no pressure of looking at a menu and deciding. The tasting menu is set every night, and they save each course as a surprise (though they will ask about dietary restrictions, allergies, etc). Once your party is settled, the courses start coming out and gradually work their way up into richer, more filling small plates. It's meant to be an 8 course, but you have your amuse-bouche and extra desserts at the end, so the 11 courses works out to a perfect amount of food in my mind.\n\nTHE BEST: Huevo (sashimi), Pollo (in farro broth), Sable (swordfish in garlic sauce), Pato (steak), Foie (ice cream).\n\nTHE WORST: Papas (custard), Dulces (cookies).\n\nCourse 1: Botana (nachos and salsa) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/californios-san-francisco?select=gFZ3g3UY7Yy3xUQBZDUApA#OH-TTEC7t0MHFYsVUZ8AwA\nA bit oily on the nachos, but thick with a subtle crunch, comes unique flavors on top.\n\nCourse 2: Hielo (oysters) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/californios-san-francisco?select=gFZ3g3UY7Yy3xUQBZDUApA#aCy5hb6Cq6e6TgLrVbg4GA\nFresh & tasty!\n\nCourse 3: A-chile (celery pudding) - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/californios-san-francisco?select=gFZ3g3UY7Yy3xUQBZDUApA#CtlnT2CR7ZBo9YGS5zGHag\nI usually hate celery but liked this!

Also, had I not know that this was a Mexican restaurant, I wouldn't have been able to tell considering a number of the dishes were heavily Asian-inspired.\n\n$75 tasting menu, $45 6 wine pairings, mandatory 18% tip. \n\n-Tortilla chip w/ roe - too salty\n-Oyster - fresh\n-Asparagus w/ yogurt - i wish there was more of this\n-Celery granita with pop rocks - refreshes your palette and definitely gets you excited for the following course\n-Smoked hamachi - haven't had this before. twas delicious!\n-Potatoes - potato puree, baked potato, potato chip. what a versatile ingredient\n-Tortilla - think pupusa with no filling. meh\n-Duck + Fennel Salad - duck was cooked to perfection.\n-Dessert - easily my favorite part of the meal. 3 courses!\n               Goats milk ice cream and citrus - light and smooth. acidity of the citrus cut through the creaminess of the goats milk well.\n               Foie Gras Ice Cream - you can't taste the foie gras but it definitely enhanced the creaminess of the ice cream. \n               A plate of bite-sized sweets: cookies, guava gelee, caramel. The portions were so tiny I didn't even feel guilty after\n\nWhen it was originally $57, it was absolutely a steal. At the current price of $75, it's definitely pricey.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-26", "description": "I discovered Californios via the Eater Map and was mildly curious to see what they had going on there...particularly that foie gras vanilla ice cream everyone takes photos of.  When the opportunity presented itself, my husband and I wandered out to the Mission to give it a shot.\n\nAs you may already know, Californios has a set menu of 12 dishes that range from sweet to savory to heavy in protein, but sourced with all local and organic ingredients for $75 per person (the price just recently went to $75 from $65).  The menu seems to change quite frequently in terms of what's in season, so to make this a little bit more meaningful, I'll just highlight some of things we had that night.\n\nFavorite dishes:\n- Celery root apple granita with kiwi\n- In-house made sliced bread with flaxseed served with a house made chicken stock soup aged 5 days with parsnip and turnip\n- Sourdough tortillas with house made butter\n- Sonoma duck served with a shiso reduction and pico de gallo\n- Foie gras vanilla ice cream served with peanut brittle and banana\n\nAll five dishes completely nailed it.  My husband was a big fan of the granita and duck, and I was seriously drooling over the bread and tortillas.  The duck was served Japanese robata style and had a delicious smoky flavor to it.  And let's talk about the foie gras ice cream.  Absolutely no over-the-top foie gras taste, you get a SUPER rich and buttery vanilla ice cream taste instead.  It's pure genius.\n\nDishes that we were \"meh\" on:\n- Yellowtail with serrano chili oil\n- Oyster with jicama\n- Chawanmushi with caviar and blue corn tortilla chips\n\nThe yellowtail wasn't cut evenly and in fairly large pieces, so it was a little bit more than a mouthful when trying to eat it.  The oyster and chawanmushi weren't over the top, and the caviar on the chawanmushi seemed to overdo the umami taste I think it was going for.\n\nService wise, Californios did an amazing job with spacing out our dishes in a even way, and the person in charge of the wine program (my husband had the wine pairing with his meal) did an amazing job explaining each glass that was being poured with the upcoming dishes. Sitting at the bar was also a good experience and we got to see how hard the guys in the kitchen were working to put together some beautifully plated dishes.\n\nAt $75, Californios is definitely on the pricey side (more when you add in the drink program), and it's definitely not going to be the type of experience where you'll feel like you need to be rolled out of the restaurant from eating too much.  The plate sizing is delicate and meant to give you a solid few bites which focuses on quality and not quantity.  I definitely enjoyed my time at Californios, especially how much creativity and hard work they pour into each dish!", "author": "Lisa I."}

Californios calls themselves \"Mexican fine dining\" but I found the food to be more Californian with Mexican influences. There's two tasting menus (meat or vegetarian) for $57 pp and wine pairings are an additional $35 (I received 4 pours). There's an 18% service charge that's shared among the entire staff. \n\nSimilar to omakase, the chef (formerly Sons & Daughters) and his sous chefs prepare a series of gorgeous dishes using the best seasonal ingredients available. The portions are small but it's not any different than the portions I've had at Saison, Manresa, and Atelier Crenn; and their tasting menus are $185-$298+. Did I contemplate on stopping by Escape from New York Pizza down the block afterwards? You betcha my fatass did but we didn't. But for $57, this is a super reasonably cost tasting menu which I doubt they're making much profit from.\n\n~ * ~ T A S T I N G  M E N U ~ * ~ \nSince we didn't get to see the menu until the end of dinner which has a vague one word descriptor, my descriptions may be a little off or incomplete: http://bit.ly/14pFcc6.\n\n(1) Chips & Salsa w/ trout roe: http://bit.ly/14ds3SB\n(2) Huckleberry Granita w/ \"pop rocks\": http://bit.ly/1Faspul\n(3) Foraged Salad: http://bit.ly/1rXBpgs\n(4) a.

Of course there were a few missteps (the granitas) but they're still testing things out so that's to be expected. \n\nThe fancy play on \"chips & salsa\" with a burst of saltiness from the trout roe was lovely start to the tasting menu. Loved the deliciously smoky and meaty mackerel, and the kampachi crudo was amazingly fresh. Loved the plate it was presented on which gave it illusion that the crudo was smoking. \n\nThe chicken soup was the best damn chicken soup I've had. The broth had some serious depth of flavor going on with a pop of sweet tartness from the pomegranate. The sous-vide chicken breast? Incredibly silky and tender. \n\nMr. NSS and I are lengua whores. The lengua mole was deliciously satisfying and oh so tender. Don't knock it until you've tried it because lengua is one of most underrated cuts. \n\nThe only thing I didn't care for were the intermezzo granitas.

Wife and I decided to see swan lake in sf at 8pm and dine at Californios before. I called about the timing and the hostess assured me we will enjoy our dinner and in time for the show afterward. \n\nWe arrived at 5:30pm and amuse bouche was served timely with wine recommendations. All 16 courses came perfectly timed and prepared. Superb dining experience with amazing preparation and presentation. Friendly and knowledgeable staff made the whole experience memorable and most enjoyable. Compliments to the chefs with creativity and flavors.  Needless to say we finished the 18 courses in one hour 45 min and made good time at the ballet. \n\nOne of my favorite restaurant in the city now and we will be back soon.

It's a small dimly lit place that plays really close attention to its diners. There is no menu, and you go in blind, hoping for the best. It's kind of nice not having to worry about it actually. They do ask you for any dietary restrictions and accommodate. The palate cleanser was actually the biggest surprise as it had pop rocks in it. Each dish was unique and delicious in its own way.\n\nSo why not the 5 stars? I noticed that the table next to us got 2 extra dishes- when all you can do is a set menu. Upon talking to the host, its basically upto the chef, who gets what, and when. So if you're a regular, you may get more...but for the first time, you get less. That was kinda off putting, but I will be back I suppose. Also, the hardcore rap that sometimes plays with their mix is so out of place. I have nothing against the music, in fact I was shazzaming it to get it later, I just thought it was out of place for such a upscale joint.", "author": "Bevi K."}

Like, over the top fancy / frou frou.  Don't get me wrong, it was all delicious, the restaurant has very cool d\u00e9cor, and the service was top notch....but it's a laughably over-the-top dining experience.\n\nFor our meal, we had a whopping 12 courses....it used to be fewer, and honestly, we were all STUFFED by the end.  We literally couldn't finish the whole meal.  Not even the 200+ pound former football player at our table.\n\nThe menu is ridiculously vague - botanas, campechana, nopales, ybfc (???), frijoles, langosta, tamal, Caesar, asada, queso, pina+pina, foie, and calabaza.  That's more than twelve....and there was also an amuse-bouche and (sort of gross) little takeaway candies with the check.  I honestly can't remember the details of every course, but the notable items:\n\n(1) Frijoles - To my excitement, they use Rancho Gordo beans for this, which I buy at the Ferry Building for my red beans and rice and other dishes.  This was RIDICULOUSLY good.  Basically the best mashed potatoes and gravy you've ever had, except all made from various beans and bean broths.  I can't do this dish justice with words.\n\n(2) Langosta - This lobster soup was excellently spicy and contained big, luscious chunks of lobster.  Really liked this...\n\n(3) Caesar - Best Caesar salad of my life.  Plus, I learned the origin of the name!\n\n(4) Foie - Ok, so I'm not sure if this course was actually Foie...but we had squab.  I never thought pigeon could be so tasty.  Although some people at the table were really freaked out, eating pigeon...\n\nAs I said before, the service is excellent.  Perhaps a little too pretentious but certainly very refined.  The way they serve the food is also beautiful but totally over the top.  We had different types of dishes and utensils with every course.  Golden spoons, tiny wooden spoons, two-pronged forks, vintage marble chargers, tiny tea plates with gilded skulls. It's not BAD, it's just so silly!  We were all giggling over the ridiculously specific utensils.  I don't know if all that is necessary - it takes the focus off of the food in a sort of unwelcomed way.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful and funky.  The main dining room has an open kitchen and is decorated sort of in a fancy, masculine 80's throw back sort of way.  The bathroom is totally trippy with changing color neon lights.  If Patrick Bateman from American Psycho was going to eat somewhere, it would be here.\n\nNow that I've dined here, and it was one of the most expensive meals of my life, I don't think I need to come back....but I'm glad I tried it!  I fear that may be the downfall for this place.  It's an experiential meal, not a place you make reservations just to have a nice dinner on a Friday night.\n\nP.S. Not entirely sure why reservations are impossible to get.  We were one of TWO tables and our reservation was at 8:30pm on a Saturday night.  By the end, we were literally the only ones there.", "author": "Tay H."}

Each and every dish was exploding in flavor and was made ever-so-delicately. The cuisine resembled Mexican food with a fusion twist and was all beautifully presented.Favorites included their version of the \"Caesar Salad\" and \"Tripe\" - super flavorful and unique.\n\nI was a bit saddened I didn't get to taste any Uni dish like my gf Suany W. nor Foie like Cherylynn N. I was very much looking forward to either of those! In addition, I have a huge sweet tooth and can't even recall what I had for dessert anymore. I remember dessert being ok and not overly impressive.\n\nStill - the service was impeccable, the dining room was quaint/dark and romantic, and the food was refreshing and tasty.\n\nWe did have some sticker shock when the bill arrived and it totaled to just under $1K for about 4 people (4 tasting menus with wine pairings + their added service charge). I'd like to return here for date night and opt out of the wine pairing (and opt for a bottle or a few glasses instead) and see what their menu has in store next time!", "author": "Veronica S."}

I had the pleasure of dining here on Halloween night. As soon as we arrived, our table was ready and we were immediately seated.\n\nWithin 5 minutes of sitting down, they came over to pour us a glass of champagne to celebrate my birthday which was such a nice touch. I was at Al's the night before and the fact that we were celebrating my birthday was completely ignored. They didn't even verbally wish me a happy birthday.\n\nThen they came out to check if we had any dietary restrictions. This was even AFTER they went over the menu with us on the phone to make sure that we were ok with all of the ingredients. Did I mention that we had a 9 pm reservation and since someone canceled their 8 pm reservation, that they actually called us to ask us if we wanted to eat earlier!?! of course!!!!\n\nAlso, they were very considerate when they designed the restaurant. The tables for 2 are about a third wider than your average 2 top and there is actually space between tables. He could easily fit another table and have us all sitting on top of each other but he didn't. Don't you hate it when you're practically sitting on the person next to you and you can hear their conversation better than your own? Well, you won't have that problem here.\n\nThrough out the meal, it was truly nothing short of professional, friendly, informative and patient. With every dish came a change in table settings and with a complete explanation of where the ingredients were sourced and if there was some story behind it. For example, did you know that the Caesar salad was invented in Mexico? I sure didn't. There were also a lot of nice thought out touches. For example, I ordered coffee at the end and the cream that came out with it was actually heated up to prevent it from cooling your coffee down. \n\nThere was also not one bad dish. Everything was super delicious including their version of frijoles (beans) and I absolutely hate beans. I almost didn't eat it but everything had been so darn good that I just had to try it and I'm glad I did.  \n\nOverall, the entire experience was absolutely amazing. It's rare where the food AND service are just as good. They just got a Michelin star and trust me when I tell you that they are one of the places to watch. They WILL be getting a second star the next round. It's a must try. You will not regret it. I can't wait to go back!", "author": "Diane M."}

I've dined at many fine dining restaurants and while service is attentive and on point, it usually feels fake and stuffy. Not at Californios. They were extremely professional but at the same time laid back and genuinely friendly. Their attentiveness even started before we were at the restaurant. 3 days before our dinner reservation they called to confirm and offered an earlier time for us since the only time we were able to get was 9:30. They asked if we would like to dine at 8pm instead since a spot opened up. On the same phone call they went over the menu with me to make sure it worked with our dietary restrictions. \n\nWhen we got there, they knew exactly who we are and remembered our dietary restrictions AND started us off with a complementary glass of champagne for the birthday we were celebrating. What a nice touch! \n\nSpace is small but it didn't feel small. Unlike most restaurants in SF, there is space between tables. You won't feel like you are sitting on top of the person next to you nor you will run out of space to fit all the dishes and glasses on your table. Their attention to detail goes as far as having wider tables for their guest to have a better overall experience.\n\nI am truly impressed.", "author": "Andy W."}

I've been patiently waiting for this day since hearing about his goal to open his own restaurant. There had been some pop up meals here and there but I have not been lucky with timing and missed out on those events so I made sure I jumped on reservations ASAP when I caught wind of the soft opening.\n\nVal and his team put together a very fun and creative menu with delicious flavor profiles. The dishes were described to me as modern Mexican cuisine although I thought only a few of the items subtly reflected that. Yet, I was very happy with the taste of everything that was put before me and found the wines to pair extremely well with my courses. I think I just about died and went to heaven over the perfectly grilled beef tongue alongside an Argentinian Merlot. Drooooool! Another favorite of mine from dinner was a very rich soup broth (I think it was duck?!?

My eyebrow game was not strong that day\n\nService: 3 stars\nThe staff was excellent - very nice and attentive-but they have a number of service flaws to fix.\nWe were asked multiple times about our drink selection from 3 different staff members. 3 times by 3 different people to take our initial drink order, about 4 more times from 2-3 different people for refill orders and this was usually one person asking and then 2minutes later another coming to ask and then 2 minutes later another coming to ask, and 2 more times taking our drink orders for dessert. I think you need to stick to one person per table... being asked for drinks that many times feels very interruptive.\n\nWhen we got up to leave there was a guy at the front holding out a coat to us...it was really awkward walking past him because the coat did not belong to my husband. The restaurant seats maybe 20? When we left there were only about 4 patrons left aside from us...very weird since we were the only ones walking out to be held a coat at the door that wasn't ours...\n\nAtmosphere: 5 stars. \nBeautiful decor. Dark navy walls and romantic lighting. Very cozy and chic feeling. Cool artwork on the wall. Amazing musical playlist = A+ (almost as good as the music at Saison).\n\nFood: 4 stars\nThe food here is pretty good but not phenomenal. It fluctuates between too light and too heavy of a hand. The flavors are clean and tasty. One of the dishes being the quail with the three sauces. The quail was good on it's own coated in the mole (?) but the three additional sauces were overkill. I want to know what is on my plate is good and not have too much choice. We had wagyu too (I think it was A5?) and while we heard other's raving about how it was the best steak they have ever had I can't say the same (the best I've had is A5 from 5A5 in the city. It's interesting when a roast quail from Atelier Crenn (to be fair their A5 Wagyu isn't great either) and a leg of Lamb from Lazy Bear have double the flavor of A5 beef. Amazing tacos though! I also love their desserts- very refreshing and interesting.\n\nThis place has very rich WASP feeling. Down to the undiverse wait staff. Sure a lot of the male serving staff looked like your typical white male abercrombie models but...it still feels weird at a place that is boasting california/mexican inspired flavors. It isn't welcoming or comforting. It feels formal which is a little weird for San Francisco. It's beautiful but a little cloying...more so from some feeling in the air that you need to be uppity to eat here.", "author": "Jennifer A."}

A friend and I came in for dinner around 7pm on a Thursday night. Place is pretty small but also was pretty packed especially given that this is their first week being open! The place definitely gives off an interesting vibe. It's got a dark/romantic/intimate atmosphere with interesting RNB/rap songs playing in the background. I love it. So Mission. It's also very much in line with this new affordable fine dining SF scene (i.e. this place reminded me of The Palace--great food, small place, though this place is definitely more aesthetically pleasing)\n\nIt's fine dining in the sense that the food is so top notch, but service sometimes feels a little awkward and not super natural yet--I'm sure it'll get better as the waitresses get more comfortable. My friend and I didn't order any alcohol and our waitress expressed some very noticeable disapproval/sadness which was a little awkward lol.\n\nI'll let my photos speak for themselves, but here's a brief rundown of the dishes we had:\n\nChips--yummy crisp sweet tangy tortilla chips that went super well with the fish roe on top! truly a burst of citrusy goodness\n\nHielo--huckleberry & lemon lime ice with pop rocks!! such a fun dish\n\nCrudo--basically tasted like Japanese sashimi but better. the jalapeno added a nice pop of flavor, the base of the dish was also tangy and citrusy. I enjoyed it! Super fresh fish\n\nGrano--my friend's favorite and I loved as well .whole grain chicken soup! chicken was a little dry and flavorless but the soup was yum yum with pomegranate seeds!\n\nBistec--YES. My favorite. my god it was amazing . The lengua mole was so soft and tender. Came with a caramelized onion that went really well with a citrusy avocado thick sauce\n\nChoc--blood orange ice cream with chocolate and coffee flavored stuff; pretty good\n\nFoie--foie gras ice cream with apple pieces and crumble--felt like a deconstructed apple pie. The ice cream was really good but honestly if you lied and told me it was caramel ice cream I would have believed it\n\nDulce--Mexican wedding cookie was super soft and yummy & the mango gummy was an excellent end!\n\nAt $57/person, I think this place is a huge bargain. They do automatically tack in the 18% service tax into your bill so be aware of that when you're paying. I'm not typically a fan of Mexican food, but this didn't even feel like Mexican food. Honestly such a phenomenal experience. Each dish was beautifully created and so, so creative. It's been a long time since I've had such an exciting, interesting meal. I left feeling full enough, though I could see how someone might still be hungry since the only entree is the beef tongue. \n\ntldr; super cheap tasting menu why wouldn't you go? get in before they get big! service could be better but food at the price is amazing.", "author": "Jasmine X."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-25", "description": "If you ask foodies what the best fine dining restaurant is in the San Francisco area they'll likely respond with the usual places: The French Laundry, Benu, Saison, Lazy Bear, Quince, etc. All of these will provide you with truly exceptional meals but personally I think the new champ is Californios because it combines fine dining techniques with Mexican/Californian cuisine in a truly unique fashion that is prefect for the city and neighborhood in which it is based; fine new American and French cooking is a well-traveled road but I can't name another Michelin-rated restaurant that is even remotely like Californios.\n\nWhile I love the interior of the place it won't immediately suggest anything about what your experience is about to be like. It almost feels like a throwback to more traditional fine dining spaces but the classy understated primary colors, table settings and service are balanced with secondary modernist art, design touches, and music selections that give away the true spirit of this establishment: this isn't Gary Danko - this is a very modern, very San Francisco creative collective ready to run wild on your palate.\n\nThe food and wine at Californios is outstanding. As you've probably read, every dish comes from a tradition of Mexican cooking and those flavors are absolutely present in big, bold ways in the dishes. Some dishes are eclectic takes on more traditional comfort food classics like Queso Fundido and tacos, but each is exploding with flavor that will make you rethink what great Mexican preparation is. Wagyu steak here is always cooked to perfection and served with the most delicious accompaniments, my favorite of which was a grilled tomato that had such a perfect smoked, slight charred preparation. The most eclectic of the dishes is always the frijoles with caviar - I know you think you're getting some traditional pinto beans here but instead they are whipped into a very soft, almost potato-like texture the likes of which I've never enjoyed before. Every time I've been one of the desserts has been a banana ice cream complimented with dulce de leche that is just otherworldly.\n\nYou will also not leave here hungry - the tasting menu is extensive and, at the moment, still very reasonably priced around $150-$160.\n\nGo here NOW before it becomes even more popular because there's no way Californios stays a local secret for too much longer.", "author": "Matt M."}

Cool!\n\nDinner here is more about the experience than the food. We got a 5:30 reservation, and walked into a lovely, cozy, dark, masculine room. There was only one other table seated.Throughout the whole experience, our wait staff was friendly and attentive. You don't get just one server, as it was explained to me, whoever is available brings and explains your food. They started off by asking if there was anything we didn't eat. I actually don't eat cheese, and as it happened, the restaurant's cheese supplier was there when I said this. Apparently, he's a doctor that just makes cheese randomly as a side job. He berated me a bit for missing out, but it was all in good fun.\n\nShockingly, the wine list had some very affordable wines. My friend and I split a $40 Riesling that was actually one of the best Riesling's I've had. \n\nThen comes the food. 12 (very) small plates. Overall, it's enough to leave you satisfied, but not totally stuffed. All the food was good, but only a handful were excellent, which is I why I say that the experience here is more about the service. Dinner lasted almost three hours, and it was relaxing and fun to see plate after plate arrive. It was very much worth the $150/person after tax/tip (fyi, an 18% tip is automatically added to the bill). \n\nThe food standouts on the evening I went were the bean soup, Californio's take on a ceasar salad, and the lavendar honey ice cream.", "author": "Jenna L."}

The service was superb, and to top it off, the chef was at Sons & Daughter in a former life. \n\nThe 11 dishes + small bites were all so tasty and well thought out.

I highly recommend this place! Celebrate something! They serve champagne to you when you arrive. All the wines are well priced, and dish after dish was impressive and the perfect proportions. \n\nOh, one last thing. I love love love the bread. It was cilantro with green onion sourdough bread that they pan sear a little and made in house. It was delicious and comes in between one of the middle courses. I highly recommend this place and we all think they will get a Michelin star soon. It looks like they have raised the prices quite a bit, but with this quality, I would still say it's great value. $97 a person for the tasting menu, 2 bottles of wine, 18% tip between 5 people was around $160 a person just to give you a price point because it's not really clear on the website when we booked.", "author": "Joanna S."}

The attentive staff seated us at our table and the fine service continued until the end of the meal. Instead of having one waitperson, the restaurant employed a team approach. Different people were bringing us different dishes. At one point the chef brought out the plates himself presumably to ensure optimal serving temperature. \n\nThe menu was a $125 prix fixe and an optional $75 wine pairing was available. They didn't even publish a sample menu so I was completely in the dark when I showed up. I'd call the food seasonal with Mexican influence. The ingredients spoke loudly of spring and the flavors were fresh. All dishes were thoughtfully composed. It kind of reminded me of Meadowood in terms of their seriousness of the ingredient selections. While not every course was memorable, they were all interesting in its own way.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-11", "description": "Just stumbled on the printout of our menu from Cinco de Mayo. Oh, memories. \n\nMuch to our excitement, my friend was kind enough to treat us to dinner here, after reading excellent reviews and hearing friends rave about it. \n\nI'm not one to write a review below 4 stars: I don't bother because I would rather praise local businesses versus dwell on less satisfying experiences. However, over a month later, I am still thinking how surprised we were by our meal and that as area residents who love and follow food, we have a responsibility to share the good and bad, especially when a meal costs $150 per person not including drinks or gratuity.\n\nWe arrived on time and were greeted by friendly staff. They offered to take our coats and seated us right away. Our primary waiter was quite effusive, clearly enthusiastic about what was about to unfold. He asked perhaps a few too many questions about us and why we were there, how we knew each other, where we were from originally, etc. but we politely answered anyway. \nThen he explained the set menu and pairing options. \n\nWe began with spicy margaritas and we were off. \n1) an agua fresca to awaken the palate\n2) an uni tostada with delicate greens and edible flowers balanced beautifully on a blue corn vehicle to deliciousness. \n3) The lechon or pork belly that followed was one of the most memorable dishes of the night. Perfectly seasoned with a cucumber-creme fraiche up top, the morsels of meat were savory and satisfying. As in, don't talk to me while I am enjoying this.\n4) Ceviche was a generous cup of fresh ikura with avocado crema. Those pearls of salmon roe were extraordinary and burst in the mouth with incredible flavor. \n5) Hielo was a refreshing, iced berry palate cleanser. Not too sweet, and still icy, kind of like a nice granita.\n6) Fruit Cup of assorted fresh local vegetables hand selected by the chef. It was fantastic -- some raw, some lightly grilled or blanched and bright. \n7) Frijoles, presented as a type of chawan mushi, and rather salty. The problem with a savory custard like that is you expect real treasures in there, and get less excited by beans.\n8) Lima, the lime-infused broth was one we all said we wanted to recreate. \n\nSounds glorious, right? Unfortunately, here is when the salt really set in.\n9) Huevos featured a delicately crafted egg coddled \"like the chef's grandmother used to make\". However, the dish was so salty we could barely taste the other ingredients, let alone the caviar on top. \n10) Abulon or abalone was a good recovery, balanced in a nice broth with simple veggies. \n11) Tamarindo was a wonderful surprise because it was all about the sauce yet accompanied by a slice of fresh trout, the skin crispy and flesh medium rare -- altogether perfectly prepared, with sugar snap peas. \n12) Quesadilla was a let down, a salty, grilled stomach-filler of carbs and mushrooms. I didn't even finish it.\n13) Cordero - lamb - was the biggest letdown of all. It arrived looking fabulous, a short cylinder of meat prepared as if for a culinary magazine of the first order. A dollop of mole sauce beckoned, as did an mound of freshly grilled green onion that had a slight char. But the lamb, alas -- what was to be the highlight of the meal -- was salty verging on inedible. 3 of the 4 of us returned this dish without taking more than one or two bites when it was meant to be the \"piece de resistance\" according to our chatty waiter. The green onions were delicious, but it is bad when the best part of a dish is the side. \n\nThe rest of the courses were desserts -- \n14) Berry flan, tight and not too sweet.\n15) Platano was a flavorful banana ice cream, and fresh caramel sauce added to your liking, my favorite of the three closers. \n16) Pastel, a white birthday cake with frosting and sprinkles seemed like a novel way to finish for novelty's sake. \n\nOverall...\nWas it a good meal? Sure, pretty good. Would I go back? Probably not. I found at least 3 of the dishes too salty, 1 unnecessary.\n\nWhen 3 of us didn't eat our lamb and the chef or senior staff didn't come ask why not was surprising. This isn't a large restaurant, we could see the chef a few feet away.\n\nPerhaps we were there on an off night. It is clear the team is dedicated to providing a refined meal  and unique experience here in our vibrant neighborhood. I wish them luck.", "author": "T L."}

We had an excellent meal.  It's a relatively small restaurant, with some seating at the bar and then about 8 tables (we were able to sit by the front window in the corner which was nice). \n\nThe food was delicious throughout.  We also enjoyed the wine that we ordered - Lost and Found's Russian River Pinot Noir.  They accommodated my lactose intolerance beautifully.  There were a ton of courses, including two dessert courses, but most of them were tiny.  We were a bit nervous we wouldn't end up full but we were fine by the very end.  \n\n- agua fresca\n- chip - tacos with red peppers and a grain that tasted like cereal.\n- lingua - wagyu beef tongue braised for 16 hours with masa (really tender)\n- hielo - raspberry ice with sorel sauce\n- ceviche - dungeness crab with smoked trout roe and pepper (refreshing)\n- abulon - agua chile which was made as a gel with Monterey abalone and seaweed and cherry tomato\n- Yerba Buena fruit cup, which was a combo of pickled green beans, carrots and spring greens, goat cheese mousse, sunflower seeds, beets, cabbage, and interestingly no discernible fruit. (We learned something new here - turns out Yerba Buena used to be the name for San Francisco!)\n- frijoles - a bean soup \n- caldo - lamb broth with fresh mint and raspberry (very solid flavor)\n- arroz - beef with pea tendrils, sushi grade rice, salsa, preserved tomatoes and roma tomato broth\n- ciruela - lightly seared king salmon with stone fruit fennel and habanero \n- quesadilla - like a mini panini with green tomato salsa with porcini mushroom and queso oaxaca \n- cordero - single lamb chop with cherries -  perfectly cooked \n- platano- a meringue like dessert on a soft taco \n- pastel - frogs hollow apricot with cow's milk cheese on a pastry \n\nAnd then they sent out an extra bite of cake with a candle at the end...\nOverall, a really excellent meal and wonderful birthday dinner.", "author": "Vivian W."}

I am *totally* fine with service included -- but I hate, hate, hate that moment of indecision:  I'm spending loads of money, almost $100 for the tax & tip, and still I feel like a stingy cheapskate because I didn't tip any EXTRA on top of that 18%.

With minimal information available about the menu other than it being upscale Mexican food, my curiosity was piqued.\n\nUpon arrival, we were given the option to sit at a table or the bar -- we opted for the bar to sit closer to the action. Service was slightly awkward at first (3 different people greeted us, no offering of drinks right away though water was given immediately, delayed explanation of the menu and courses), but extremely friendly and certainly warmed up. We were told that there was a choice between two 4 course meals (meat or vegetable) sort of omakase style, with the option of a wine pairing. We chose the meat course and selected a bottle of the sparkling cab franc. For food:\n\nChips and salsa - reminiscent of a fried corn puff with fish roe and fermented chili sauce\n\nLime granita with homemade pop rocks (which I spilled all over)\n\nSmoked kampachi with fish sauce, chopped cilantro stalks, radish and chili \n\nChicken soup of reduced chicken broth mixed with faro starch water mixed with more chicken broth; tender piece of chicken cooked sous vide, pomegranate, pickled turnip/radish with chilis\n\nGrilled beef tongue (lengua) in mole sauce, avocado pur\u00e9e and grilled onion\n\nMeringue, chocolate creme de pot, and blood orange sorbet\n\nFoie gras salted ice cream, crumbled tortillas \n\nMexican wedding cookies \n\nThe chicken soup, grilled lengua, and foie gras ice cream were my favorite.

Service-wise, the staff and chefs were really nice and very knowledgeable. They even pronounced all the spanish names of the dishes authentically. Also interesting references to harvests and seasonal crops, with an emphasis on sourcing ingredients from a farm near sonoma. The a5 wagyu steak was really good - one of the best steaks(perfect medium rare) I have had in the US.

It was a very very good meal, and the service was great too. However, I continued to be stumped by what we were eating. Each of the different chefs or servers who brought our food talked so fast, and when I asked if I could get some sort of menu at the end so I knew about all the cool stuff I was eating, I was informed I would. Then, as you may have seen in other posts, you get an highly stylized \"menu\" with one-word descriptions of each course. That is NOT what I wanted. I wanted to know WHAT was in the fish course and the sauce for the duck, etc. That left me pretty disappointed.\n\nThat being said, I'll try to piece together the courses from my memory and others' posts:\n\nCourse 1: tortilla chips with fish eggs and maybe some spicy sauce (a little dot on the edge of the chip)?\nCourse 2: oysters in a half shell\nCourse 3: Celery granita with kiwi pudding (palate cleanser) and pop rocks!\nCourse 4: some type of fish crudo with chili oil (excellent - one of my favorites)\nCourse 5: chicken soup with pomegranate. The chicken had an interesting, almost steak-y texture. Perhaps sous vide? I loved the rich broth.\nCourse 6: three potatoes - something pureed, something in a chip form and one other variant. \nCourse 7: Duck breast with shiso sauce, fennel and served with \"sour\" tortillas and some type of butter/spread. Very good.\nCourse 8: I'm a little hazy on this, but some type of ice cream I believe, with a goat cheese/goat milk? foam. Delicious.\nCourse 9: Foie gras ice cream with hazelnut crumble and caramelized banana. Yum!!\n\nThey finished off the meal with three small candies/treats: a pate de fruit, a cookie and a caramel.\n\nAll in all, a great tasting menu for a very reasonable price.", "author": "David B."}

I'm usually not a huge fan of Mexican food as I can't handle a lot of heat. But to my surprise, while some of the dishes have some heat, I thought the heat added to the taste of the dishes and made them even more delicious (and not too spicy that I can't handle them). They start taking reservation 14 days in advance, and I grabbed the last 4-people table on a Saturday night. My friends and I came for what I described as \"haute Mexican-Californian cuisine\". The food definitely did not disappoint. On top of serving many dishes that I traditionally would not like (such as mole) but turned out to be stellar, the dishes also provide many flavors that you typically would not find in French/Italian/New American restaurants. The overall portion size was great, and my boyfriend has noted it as now one of his favorite restaurants in the city. I would recommend anyone who love trying out new food to give this place a visit as I'm sure it's only going to become even more popular!", "author": "Sharon L."}

After another spectacular meal, we will be coming back again next month. \n\nDecor- sleek and elegant, reminds me a bit of a NYC speakeasy or lounge. \n\nFood- consistently delicious...mind numbingly delicious. Very innovative with creative use of unique ingredients. The oysters starters have been some of the best small bites I've ever had. The smoked fish dish (fish changes frequently) was delectable. Red meat dishes (we've had duck and lamb) were cooked perfectly. The potato dish is perfect for the starch lovers, packed of potato and butter flavor. I mean, how can you not love that?! I love their bread and butter. I don't think I need to explain why. Oh I also love one of their palate cleanser, the one with jasmine essence and Pop Rocks...so much fun! Oh their desserts are pretty spectacular also! \n\nDrinks- I have to say this though...as much as I enjoyed the food, the alcohol pairing is what and will keep me coming back. Their sommelier...she's just a genius. She finds very unique wine/champagne/beer/sake that I usually have never come across and have opened my eyes to the vast array of options out there.

On the one hand, it's one of my favorite places to eat in San Francisco. On the other, the more popular it gets, the harder reservations will be to come by. I'll try not to be too selfish and share the wealth.\n\nThis was my second visit to Californios, and it was even better than the first (which was tremendous). The menu was much more substantial - whereas the first time I left satisfied but not stuffed, this time I couldn't even finish every course. All for the same price!\n\nDinner was also much longer, over 3 hours. And each course had a little surprise in it. Flavors that don't normally get matched up (like blueberries and chicken broth), textures that delight (crunch, crunch, creamy), and Mexican influences that are a little more pronounced than in the past.\n\nIt's really a wonderful meal and a relatively good value ($113/person including tax, gratuity, and a drink or two). I still predict this place will get their first Michelin star as soon as they are eligible.\n\nPROS\n- Best dessert I've ever hard.\n- Service is top notch\n\nCONS\n- Only beer and wine, which they try to address by getting creative with cocktails. I'd stick to just beer or wine (or try the pairings).\n\nTIPS\nSave room for dessert, because it just might be the best dessert in the city.", "author": "Drew P."}

It's located on 22nd St in the heart of the Mission, don't let that scare you away - look for the black wall with the door in it and walk-in (with reservations, of course). We had the 17 course chef's choice ($185 pp incl tip) paired with 8 champagnes, wines, and beer ($115). The pairing was perfect and so much more interesting than pairings that I've had at other top restaurants. To the sommelier - excellent finds! Another point of interest is that they do not give you the menu until the very end of the meal, as each course is served the waiter tells you what you will be eating or drinking. On one hand, that's great because I could never remember the menu and you don't really want to pick it up and read it with each course; on the other hand, if you are trying to have an intimate conversation, this might not be the perfect place. That said, each course was a little treat with a wonderful swirl of flavors. Mexican food in theory, but really haute cuisine with a nod to our South of the Border neighbors. The chef intermixed the heavier meat and cream dishes with fruit sorbets, or vegetables. Thank you chef, this is the way that I like to eat.

I'm not a fan of cold soup so the gazpacho while flavorful just wasn't my cup of tea, or soup in this case.  The fruit dish was okay but what killed it for me was the goat cheese. Just kinda ruined the whole flavor of the dish.  There is only one bathroom but the wait staff will actual tell you when the bathroom is free so you don't have to just stand around and wait.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-04", "description": "It is *extremely* difficult to pull off cuisine that is both conceptual and delicious. Daniel Patterson pulls it off at Coi, and Josh Skenes at Saison, James Syhabout at Commis also come to mind. Conversely, there are others that fall a bit short too -- Central Kitchen, Commonwealth, and Sons & Daughters just don't do it for me personally (even though I understand the chef here had worked at the latter). Flavor can take a backseat to the concept or, the point of view can get lost among too many forced techniques. Regardless of which ones we prefer, we're lucky to live in a part of the world with so many of these kinds of restaurants to experience and choose from.\n\nCalifornios does beautiful, personal, heady cuisine -- most importantly, that is also delicious -- that also prioritizes challenging those who dine there (down to the sign outside, down to the imagery on social media, etc). I can understand that might not appeal to some people, but I think it's important to have restaurants that can push boundaries in a real way without sacrificing flavor. What is Mexican food exactly? What can it be? Why do we put so many confines on it? If it becomes something unfamiliar, does that not make it Mexican food?\n\nI love that Val Cantu calls it Mexican food by the way, and I think it's fucking bold that he opened it in the Mission too. Is it Mexican food though? It's certainly fine dining with an eye on a Michelin star, but I would certainly say it's Mexican food. One slurp of the chicken soup broth will take you back to your abuela's house, but then you bite into the pickled turnips in that same bowl and you're transported somewhere else entirely. As for the beef tongue -- obviously it's not your late night lengua taco, but if they didn't tell you it was tongue, I guarantee you would never notice because it's that delicate -- and *that* good. The plating and presentation is all gorgeous, almost deliciously geometric on some dishes (never thought I would say that).\n\nAs I mentioned before, you get the feeling that the food is personal too. It's a cozy small space (love the black interior, btw), so the sense is that you're one of only a few others making similar discoveries. That's the perfect backdrop for what is going on here.\n\nI went on one of the first nights and apparently they will have an expanded tasting menu soon, and I can't wait to get back.", "author": "George C."}

Chef may have been trying too hard in trying to establish dominant flavors into single bite size courses.\n\nIn addition, there were two waitresses that would rotate and ask me the same question every 15 minutes. Probably due to a lack of communication and being a new restaurant.\n\nSuggested improvements: Your value proposition is very unique in that you are probably one of the very few Mexican tastings in the area. Would really work on finding the correct portion size and/or expand your course offering. Would recommend even just having your staff try your tasting course and have them give their anonymous honest feedback.\n\nI like the concept, but a lot of work to be done.", "author": "Alan L."}

We walked in expecting a couple of bumps along the road (seeing how it had 'just' opened) but we ended up receiving a whole lot more. You can consider this kind of eating \"elevated\" Mexican-influenced California food.

And the flavors/ingredients are masterfully put together to give you something to think about.\n\nOur table immediately noticed the effect of food contrast throughout the meal. It started off light, colorful and zingy. Then turned darker, earthier and rich. Our pairing of a Barcelonian Beer maintained it's versatility and relevance throughout most of the courses; it was so tasty we ordered a second bottle.\n\nIn addition to great ambience, music, service...I found the menu to be surprisingly delightful. No, really. The actual menu you get to take home to brag (I mean, share) with your friends is quite the treat. Like I said, folks. Put on your best foodie-cap. This place is worth several visits. :)\n\nOf particular interest for our pre-fixe was the chicken soup and \"os\". The chicken soup is not simple and requires a bit of navigation with the spoon. Reckless slurping of this dish will result in missing out on some of the wonderful hidden gems within (eg. the pomegranates, citrus \"caviar\" and umami-rich broth). Please, take your time with this dish. \n\nThe last dish I want to commend is the \"os\". I have no idea what this is actually, or what it means or even the impetus behind it. Avocados! California! Right?!. Imagine a grilled avocado, topped with farro, which is topped with pan-roasted mushrooms (oyster & morel) and garnished with very crispy, slightly charred rice puffs.

And, at fifty seven dollars per person for 8 tastes, this is a phenomenal value. \n\nThe ambiance was perfect: dark, romantic, white table cloths, tufted leather banquettes, interesting art hanging on the walls, juxtaposed with fun/upbeat rap and 80's music playing in the background.  Love that.\n\nWe had a fantastic evening and are excited to return again. Thanks Californios!", "author": "Brooke S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-06", "description": "Let me just preface my review of Californios with the face that I haven't written a Yelp review in over 7+ years, but I definitely use it (and Foursquare and SF Eater) to reference any restaurant that I'm down to try. So writing this review for Californios actually means a lot to me, and here's why:\n\nThe head chef Val and sous chef Joseph have been long time pals, working together in their days at Sons & Daughter, which I coincidentally had tried for the first time two weeks ago. Let me just say, Sons & Daughter has nothing on Californios. Nothing. Californios had a soft opening back in Dec '14, and was officially opened earlier this year in January. I can't fit my entire review here due to character limitations, but if anything, you MUST come here.\n\nThe place seats about 10 folks at the Chef's counter (I ALWAYS recommend folks to sit at the counter if at all possible. It gives you the full experience of seeing how your food is prepped and gives you a chance to chat with the chefs behind it all), and a few tables that seat maybe a little over 20. From the outside, Californios is unassuming and would probably easily walk past its frosted filmed windows on 22nd, and it's unique restaurant sign out front. \n\nWhen you walk into the restaurant, the look and feel of the place has lots of black and white tones with glassware stored in a bookshelf to the left, right by the Chef's counter.\n\nThe dining experience is through a pre-fixe menu and I highly recommend that you do this with their wine & beer pairing (trust me, you'll thanks me for it when you get to the potato dish in your meal). It's pretty much a seasonal menu of items that the chefs find during their forage or of things that interest them and, honestly, I feel like Val's passion for food could not come in a more playful and eclectic way than through this tasting menu. Oh, and FYI, I had dinner here last night, and I'm still daydreaming about the experience.\n\nSo for starters, I tried the Sangria and Margarita drinks with a friend I was with. The sangria was something new that Chef Val said they were trying and it was spankin' delicious. With it being strawberry season, the sangria definitely was infused with strawberries and apples and oranges and some pineapples I think. The taste was delicious and definitely one of the sweeter red sangrias I've had, but the smell! Oh, it was so fragrant and fresh -- it was like eating strawberries but through your nose. Haha, I don't know how else to describe that in a more eloquent way. \n\nFirst dishes were 4 small bites: oysters with green tomato sauce and a small little radish on top, yuca(?) taquito stuffed with goat cheese and topped with trout roe, then a corn puff with creme fraiche and pureed black beans and something else I believe, topped with a bit of caviar and a purple flower for garnish, and then a plate of two slices of Buri sashimi (young yellowtail - this one happened to be a 3 year old yellowtail) that was garnished with EVOO and two thinly sliced serranos; it tasted something like a combo of fish sauce and tamarind (these were not the ingredients in them, but it was a really good mix of flavors). \n\nThoughts on oysters: Totally thought they'd be regular oysters at first bite, and then the more you savor it, the more it just melts in your mouth and tastes like butter. It's definitely meatier than any other oysters I've had and it pairs so perfectly with the 2014 Scholium Project Blowout sparkling wine. \nThoughts on taquito: I told the chef this and the girls who were sitting next to me at the chef's counter and I'll tell you all: I wish I had a big, gigantic plate of these. These were so, so, so good. Like curl my toes, I-wish-my-mom-made-this-for-me, good. \nThoughts on corn puff: Tasty and delicious. Creme Fraiche goes a long way.\nThoughts on Buri: So, disclaimer, I love yellowtail. It's one of my favorite types of fish, especially since my go-to at most sushi places is Hamachi. And Chef Val does wonders to this dish. The dish takes on this aromatic serrano smell, but without the heat when eaten. It's magical!\n\nThen there was an ice dish. Think of it as like your childhood shaved ice dessert, but this is more of a tart, palate-cleansing type. The ice on top is of a strawberry & rubharb ice, and then there's a kiwi hielo at the bottom, all topped with a bit of minced basil and, what they don't tell you: pop rocks. It's such a surprise for your palate and brings you right back to childhood memories. I don't think I've had so much fun eating and enjoying what I was eating until last night. \n\nAfter the 4 small bites, there was potato dish where it was basically potato done in three ways: pureed, boild and fried. So basically imagine it like a bowl with a creamier, smoother version of really good mashed potatoes, with a small fingerling potato in the middle, topped with a housemade potato chip on top, and around the outside ring of that mashed potato there's some amazing chipotle sauce.", "author": "Tiffany H."}

The first time we were pretty blown away by the creativity and quality of the food along with the super reasonable price. Though the price has gone up, it's still totally worth it ($98 for 12 courses + lots of extras). \n\nBonus: if you buy a bottle, they'll waive corkage on one bottle.  They're still beer and wine only.  They started us with a sparkling wine that wasn't quite a sparkling rose, and it was nice to start. \n\nFood:\n1. Agua Fresca with basil, jicama, cucumber, celery, fennel. Light and refreshing, not particularly sweet \n2. Squid ink tostada: one of the memorable dishes from last time.  With saut\u00e9ed Monterey squid, serranos, and house made guacamole\n3. Sope: a black bean and chickpea fritter topped with smoked cotija, trout roe, and watermelon radish \n4. Sterling white sturgeon caviar on super sweet scallop crudo (marinated in a chile citrus broth)\n5. Sorbet: refreshing and citrusy. It was made of mandarin orange and jicama, topped with chia seeds, pea sprouts, and jicama slices \n6. Yerba buena fruit cup: a traditional chili pepper-lime juice-lemon juice marinade over local greens, fruits, and vegetables \n7. Frijoles: three types of beans including cranberry beans and white beans. The textures and flavors were so rich and hearty you can't believe it's vegetarian. I don't even like beans, but this was my favorite dish \n8. Green onion and cilantro sourdough: house made, with Strauss butter \n9. Lobster soup: caldo with lobster, Chinese celery (a thinner, more flavorful type), and Mexican cucumber \n10. Menudo: Amazing! Hen of the wood mushrooms and piccini mushrooms, goat cheese, and *drumroll...\" fried tripe. This makes tripe so much more appealing\n11. Grilled sword fish: seared on one side, served with a ginger habanero sauce, fried leeks, acorn squash, and habaneros\n12. Squab broth: with chipotle pepper and huckleberries - super fragrant. It's a tease for the next course\n13. Roasted squab: grilled and smoked, with persimmon mole and goose berries \n14. Fermented sourdough biscuits: flaky, not dry, very flavorful\n15. Masa tamale: with Hudson valley foie and cherries\n16. Arroz con leche: with poached apple, candied almond, and horchata - way more interesting than regular rice pudding \n17. Goats milk sorbet with cocoa and caramel: surprisingly light, a bit tangy, really good \n18. Calabasa pine nut and ginger crisp: lots of textures, a great way to end\n19. Final bite: a thin mini crust with a white chocolate bonbon\n\nService was friendly but not intrusive.  Again, each course was impressive and kept us excited for the next.  I can't wait to come back.", "author": "Marilyn T."}

The bright flavors from the fennel was a balance to the richness of the meat.\n-\"Bread and Butter\" - this was a \"sour tortilla\", which was almost like a griddle cake with good flavor from the char...the house-made butter was very good.\n-Dessert - we had three courses of desserts:\n                First course:  Hazelnut Flan with Goats Milk Foam and Seasonal Citrus - I really liked this since it was almost like a palate cleanser with its smoothness and subtle flavors along with fresh touches from the fruit.\n                Second course: Foie Gras Ice Cream - wow!  So amazing - this was rich and decadent with perfect texture...it was perfectly sweet and the bit of chocolate sauce added a hint of additional richness and earthiness to the flavor...a caramelized banana piece also completed the dish.\n                Third course:  A plate of Dulce: 2 Coconut Cookies, 2 Mango Gelee, 2 White Chocolate Caramels - everything was very good and well done.\n\nI really appreciated the thought that went into each plate, whether I liked it or not.  There was a course of oysters, which I'm not a fan of (but I assume if you love oysters, you may love it) and there was a course of chicken soup with pomegranate that I really didn't like...the texture was a bit tough and seemed as if it were raw.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience here and would visit again.  Considering the tasting menu was a bargain compared to most others, it was another reason to enjoy this place.\n\nThe customer service was excellent!", "author": "Ken G."}

I'm just not a fan of duck. The wine pairing was OK, too much white (only 1 red pinot at the end). Was expecting a little more balance between white/red. Maybe luck of the draw again, since another night might have seen more meaty dishes that would have seen one more red?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-04", "description": "Love the concept of this venue; cozy, dark interior but nice decor, very comfortable, not too noisy and great vibe. I recommend requesting the counter seats on the other side of the open kitchen; definitely enhances the experience watching the chefs preparing the cuisine in front of you (and the chefs as well as the front-of-the-house staff were quite personable). \n\nThe food however appeared to be a bit of a work in progress - not bad by any means, we enjoyed all but a couple courses, just not much that wowed us compared to other Michelin starred venues in this approximate price range. Dinner consists of a tasting menu and runs just under $100 per/person before tax/gratuity; elevated, creative, interesting modern Mexican cuisine with a farm-to-table emphasis. With some notice the restaurant will accommodate reasonable allergies and even aversions. The best dish was the final savory - a delicious smokey tasting squab; truly showed the Chef's style of cuisine and his skill. The meal consisted of approximately a dozen courses and was a bit heavier than we expected with several of the courses being large for an extended tasting menu. Despite being a vegetable-centric menu, some of the courses were quite rich (especially the fish course where butter overwhelmed all other flavors). A couple courses are paired with some delicious homemade bread (different style of bread for each of these courses). You definitely receive a lot of bang for your buck and I recommend arriving hungry! \n\nDesserts were the weakest with the main dessert being cloyingly sweet and the components better when eaten separate than together. I opted for the wine pairing here (only $65); really generous pours (left quite a bit of wine which is unusual for me) but unfortunately I was not impressed by the wines. Most were decent, but none tasted great on their own and the only pairing that worked excellent when consumed with the course interestingly was a beer pairing; a wonderful Saison paired with a spicy soup and really enhanced one another. All but one wine was a white and the sole red wine a Pinot - I tend to prefer reds (and especially big, bold reds) so that was a bit disappointing, but more a personal preference than necessarily a ding on the restaurant. \n\nService is relaxed, warm and friendly; Chef Cantu, his wife, and sister-in-law all own the restaurant and Chef's wife and sister run the front-of-the-house and the beverage program while he leads the kitchen. We were warmly greeted when we arrived and well cared for throughout. Instead of a primary server, expect to interact with the entire staff at some point during the course of the evening - even the chefs serve and present some of the courses. The only pitfall of this style of service is sometimes there can be miscommunication (i.e. I have an aversion to dessert wine that I expressed while ordering the wine pairing and arranged for an alternative beverage, however this was not relayed to the staff member who brought my pairing for dessert - though it was quickly remedied). Pacing was perfect; just enough time between courses to relax and sip some wine before the next course arrives - amazing how efficient they are with a tiny kitchen and small staff factoring in the complexity of the food and number of courses!\n\nCalifornios has a fantastic concept, wonderful people and features interesting (mostly good) cuisine - while I feel it has a bit of work left in order to ascend to an upper echelon restaurant there is tons of potential. A meal here is not just a dinner out, but a true dining experience.", "author": "Erick N."}

Is it because I'm Asian? Whatever it is, you should probably stop doing it. Also, your pea tendrils dish was so salty none of us could finish it, and I know that your medium rare lamb shouldn't be served hot, but it certainly shouldn't be served cold.

We have heard such wonderful things about the pop ups we wanted to give it a try! First.... We were under the impression that this concept was going to be Mexican food. Sadly it's not, it's better described as moderne California cuisine. \n\nIn San Francisco it's common practice for most of the restaurants to cross over to other cultures to complete a dish and/or to give the dish a modern twist by adding in an ingredient such as a chile or fish sauce, however the essence of each of these dishes at Californios had more modern technique as the center peice than the flavors and soul of Mexican cuisine. We are both from Latin America and one of us is from Mexico. Yes, there are some chile peppers on the kampachi and lengua as the place of beef, three black bean dots,  mexican wedding cookies at the end of the meal (which were delicious! and the only thing with the heart and soul of Mexico)...but we were hoping for a breath of fresh air with a homage to Mexican cuisine..but instead I think we got a lower version of Commis in the mission district. \n\nThe food plating is impeccable and the flavors are great but the Second let down of the meal was the portion size. I love the chef's tasting menu concept:  to try what the chef believes is important to eat at a given moment durning a particular season ...but the literal meaning of tasting is ridiculous. We've just eaten at 11 Madison park and there too ordered the tasting menu.....huge difference! Look at the pictures posted previously and you can see the lengua & dessert off set on a plate. The plate is not oversized but about average. \n\nI would recommend this place for a light modern meal with great wines and beautiful atosmphere.

The ambience is nice.  The staff is truly friendly.  The sommelier was the best of the lot - very informative, professional, and made some interesting pairings.  We really enjoyed the wines and her service.  Our main waitress was very nice, though felt somewhat unprofessional and too casual for this place.  The dishes were mostly described by the kitchen staff who brought them out, and it was always clear for us what the dishes were, unlike some comments here.\n\nThe food was very good and beautifully plated, and while I enjoyed it, there wasn't really one dish that made me feel that I must have it again... the soup likely came closest. The tongue was interesting and I love mole so liked the seasoning of it, but still not likely something I'd feel the need to come back for (neither does it make me want to come back to see what the chef will do next). The dishes were exactly as described by others and pictured so I won't describe each in detail, but unlike some here, I just wasn't wowed. In addition, though I rarely rate a place on quantity as I think restaurant portions are absurdly huge, because this was a 6 course tasting menu, I had eaten light that day, as I do whenever I do a tasting menu because I want to make sure I do not get too full and miss the opportunity to enjoy the full \"x\"-course meal.  This is the only time I have left a tasting menu not feeling completely full.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, as I stated, I don't like feeling stuffed or wasting my money paying for too-large portion sizes. However, I just wasn't fully satisfied after this meal.  I think that was probably a combination of the portions and partly just not feeling really satisfied palate-wise.  Maybe my expectations were just too high after the media build-up.\n\nRe cost: It is a good price for a tasting menu in the city - $57 + another $35 for the wine pairings, gratuity is added on automatically at 18%.", "author": "Kathryn E."}

But it fell a bit short in terms of creativity. With a Michelin star restaurant I want to be wowed at every tasting. In comparison, I can still remember every dish I had at Coi and that was 6 years ago, this was really a memorable dining experience.\n\nService: very good, not too pretentious.\nAtmosphere: Ok, good decoration/design but I was cold and I'm not sure about hip hop music in this context.\nQuality of ingredients: top notch, each of them was tasty\nPlating: very nice\nWine pairing: I didn't drink but my husband really enjoyed it.\nMeals: underwhelming: \n       Appetizers: I can have a tortilla with Oaxaca cheese and chanterelles at home, that was not a very good start\n       I think there is more to Mexican food than cilantro, beans and lime. I was expecting way more \"risky\" and truly Mexican flavors in each dish. Again each dish was very good, but at $600 total bill I want to \"feel\" things I haven't felt before, while being brought down to memory lane (I used to live in Mexico)\n    The beef itself was an amazing piece of beef, probably the best I have ever tasted, but why ruining it by putting too much salt on it?\n   The poached salmon on its was great, but the dish overall was underwhelming especially in terms of texture, I was expecting some crunchiness somewhere to counteract the smoothness and tenderness of the salmon\n   The fruit salad was very underwhelming too, ok \"17 ingredients in it\" (quoting the waitress), but this is not a contest. I can have berries and cantaloupe every day with chile flakes on it.\n    The bean dish with caviar was probably the best for me, a bit more creative and \"fireworks\" in your mouth sorta dish.\n\nIn summary, enjoyable meal overall, but not worth the price/hype/Michelin star in my opinion. \nI really like the concept but there is work to be done. Some up scale restaurants in Mexico City do a much better job at finding very interesting combinations of \"only in Mexico\" ingredients.", "author": "Alice Y."}

First off the food is beautiful, elegant, and tastes amazing. the ambiance is romantic and sweet. I love the lighting, it just makes me feel cozy and comfortable. The food tastes amazing and is something I've never tasted before. The wine paired with each dish was honestly to die for. the girl who explains the wine is amazing at explaining the taste and history of the wine its just so good! the host is sweet, she will help you take your coat off and help you put it back on. shes always checking up on you and making sure everything is okay. I love the idea that they give you a menu at the end of dinner rather then before. the chefs behind the bar seemed to work really well together and it really shows on the food they serve.  The restaurant is definitely not Mexican food BUT Mexican food inspired. In my opinion i think they are doing a great job at getting the Mexican flavors in and i cant wait to go back again.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

I thought the poached salmon dish was the  of the best salmon dishes I've ever had. \nI get that they are trying something new with the no menu, no ordering thing but we would have preferred a little flexibility. 11 courses was just a bit too much for us. After 7 or 8 courses we just sort of wanted it to be over, even though we were enjoying the food.  \nService was ok. No major flaws but was a little more casual than we were expecting. \nSpace was really cool but the restaurant was empty when we were there-- so the vibe was a little weird. First time I have eaten in an empty restaurant in while and it just felt kind of odd, especially when you're there for 3 hours or so. \nOverall the food was great but at over $400 for two people for food + wine we don't have a desire to return.

Originally I had booked at one of the classic top dining destinations in the city but as the day drew closer I thought it might be fun to try a new place. In the end this was a good instinct as he (and I) were extremely pleased about almost every aspect of our experience at Californios. \n\nTo be honest the evening did not get off to an auspicious start. We arrived by car on a Saturday night at 8pm and finding a parking spot was time-consuming and stressful. We called the restaurant and they gave us a few suggestions but we definitely wished we'd taken an Uber. Once inside, seated on the gorgeous caramel-colored leather banquette we ordered the tasting menu with wine pairing and the evening was smooth sailing from there on out.\n\nThe space is intimate but warm and sophisticated at the same time. The service is personal yet not intrusive. The place is run by a husband and wife chef/front of house team along with the wife's sister who has chosen the exquisite wine list. The food was a parade of small plates with a Mexican theme but very contemporary and Californian. It changes according to what's in the market so I won't go into detail about each course. Suffice it to say it was all delicious and very fairly priced. I think they are barely breaking even on the wine pairing.\n\nMy final word: eat here soon. The prices are bound to increase and it's anyone's guess if they can maintain these high standards. We had a wonderful evening and recommend the restaurant very highly.", "author": "S. W."}

The room is elegant, lounge, and hip.  The seating very comfortable and offers room to breathe, relax and take your surroundings.  The surprisingly calm open kitchen, the Wes Anderson Book, the conceptual modern art all of these remind you to pause, reflect and open your senses.  The whole experience challenges you to move away from the rush and engage in the moment.  It is akin to a rabbit hole that invites you to partake in a Mexican meal that is highly conceptual and very delicious.  \n\nOur meal began with a reimagined nacho.  You might be saying to yourself that \"nachos aren't really Mexican\", and you would be 100% correct.  By placing the nachos up front in his tasting menu chef Cantu is letting you know that he's thinking about the flavors of Mexican cuisine.  He is not confining himself to the expected.  He raises your hopes that he will engage your senses, emotions *and* intellect.\n\nThere is always a risk that the intellect will overtake the emotional and sensual.  On the night we were there, watching as the balancing act played out from course to course was exhilarating and almost entirely successful.\n\nChef Cantu is a man to watch and his Californios is a Mexican restaurant unlike any other in the Bay Area.\n\nThis is a must go.

There's not a single dish that I wouldn't have again in a heartbeat. The meal was roughly 2 hours but well-paced and if anything a bit faster than I would have wanted.\n\nIt's hard to pick favourites but a few things really stood out: charcoal roasted asparagus with celery root pudding, chicken soup with blueberries (!!), halibut with green radish, pico de gallo, avocado puree and the fermented tortilla with house butter.\n\nATMOSPHERE\nWe ended up sitting at the chef's counter which was a lot of fun. The chefs were very personable and engaged with us throughout the night. They even indulged me in questions about how they prepared their halibut!\n\nSERVICE\nThe service was very good overall, especially for a new restaurant, although the host was a bit awkward and our waiter seemed disappointed that we only decided to have one glass of wine and not take the pairing.\n\nWhile it may be a bit pricey at $75 for the tasting menu it's a huge bargain for the level at which this restaurant is operating.

A beautiful piece of Muscovy duck that trumps most steaks you have had.  A delicious foie gras ice cream that most people would love if they did not know that foie gras was in the preparation.

The jarring note was actually the main course:  a browned whole tongue that was tough and unpleasantly chewy.  It was an arrogant choice for a restaurant that gives you none of your own.  Many people, including me, just can't abide the texture of an entire piece of tongue and it looks disgusting sitting plopped there on your plate.  This one dish made the otherwise delightful evening one from which nightmares are born.

The food has been described as \"Modern Mexican,\" which should give anyone pause for possible deconstructed culinary douche-dom (especially when you only have the choice of a tasting menu), but what I had here was evocative of true Mexican flavors, even if the form was something else. Take for example the wagyu dish, which is their take on fajitas, which was lusciously grilled steak, caramelized onions, and the amazing \"tortillas,\" which were fluffy and biscuit-like, owed to the innovation of adding yeast to masa. Also great was the \"Posole\" which was made with a concentrated double chicken stock, rather than the typical version you see in many \"traditional\" restaurants that usually start from some commercially made chicken base - a revelation! However, I thought the best part of the meal was the wine/beer pairing, which was adventurous, thoughtful, and on point, both taking into account matching flavors as well as serving at the proper temperatures.
