The meat tasted very fresh and was perfectly cooked as the texture was nice and soft - not chewy. The noodles were decent as well though not quite the quality of the broth and meat. I also ordered the chicken karaage which tasted pretty good though I would have preferred a more unique sauce than the barbeque sauce that was served. The service was nothing to complain about nor anything to admire. The restaurant was pretty packed when we arrived and though it took a little for them to get to our table, everything else went smoothly. \n\nOverall, if you are looking for a simple yet tasty bowl of ramen, I highly recommend this place. \n\nOne thing to note however is that I am a fan of spicy ramen and though this restaurant did not take any special orders of that, I had to use chili powder instead; this worked quite nicely.", "author": "Abhisek D."}

I was wandering around Japan Center West by myself, I couldn't decide where to have to lunch and I picked Nande-Ya because of the old-style shrine-esque look with the lanterns. Seems peaceful enough from outside for a nice afternoon meal. Inside was bustling with servers running around, family overcrowding tables and I happened to be seated right in between everything because of the tight seating arrangement. I'm a committer, once I'm in, I have to bear through it to see what it's all about. \n\nUmeboshi Ochazuke- I just wanted something very light. This is a bowl of green tea over rice topped with pickled plum, nori seaweed, and Japanese rice cracker. Simple, quick and easy to eat if it wasn't for the scent of dirty rags they used to wipe down the table. \n\nOverall Service: Rushed from beginning to end even though they seem nice. I get it, table turnover must be great here, so they are trying to move people in and out but this place wasn't for me.", "author": "Rosie Q."}

With Isobune, Benihana, the taiyaki stand around the corner... there was an abundance of choices.  Now, the last man standing is Benihana while the rest are boarded up, closed, or under new management/ownership.   \n\nFast forward thirty years, it's a shadow of what longtime locals remember.  This used to be my lunch buddy's and my udon spot in J-town where there was a line out the door and a sign up sheet determined how soon you'd be filling your stomach.  With another lunch spot not being open and learning the plaza's sushi institution closed for business, we decided to grab a quick lunch here.  After a short wait, we were seated in the center of the dining room just off the window.  After studying the menu which has a variety of choices, my friend ordered a bento box (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=8ac3Xp2nKdv4Xpmib5mR5A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) while I tried their \"ramen special\" for $13.95, selecting pork belly udon soup (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=CAaSfmRU4ssLO0QHz2HOmA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  In the '60's or '70's, our meals may have passed as acceptable Japanese cuisine; given the globalization of the world especially when it comes to food, this was extremely disappointing and could be likened to fast food.  There was nothing particularly wrong with my noodles or the pork belly; it just screamed okay.  My friend generously gave me most of her chicken which was just okay, a home ramen supplemental protein.  Given how the bar has risen (along with the prices for food these days), the standards here are not as high as they should be.\n\nService for our table was fine, but most customers around us had issues especially a mother with two children; apparently, they had a time constraint which the restaurant could not meet and, in serving the food, the mother asked the server to pack the food to go due to her schedule.  There was quite a bit of back and forth before the customers were able to leave.  This also made for an uncomfortable dining room since other diners like ourselves witnessed the whole experience.  Given the situation, it would have been nice if someone from management came to resolve the situation.  Food rates 2.5 stars with a minus half star for the atmosphere.", "author": "Mike C."}

The ramen was pretty decent, definitely better than typical Japanese food court ramen like Miyabe-tei. A simple bowl of tonkotsu broth with chewy ramen noodles, wakame, charshu, green onion and ginger. The curry was simple and expected, a comfort dish served with a side of pickled plum.\n\nSuper packed spot, close quarters.

Didn't matter, we still decided to give it a try and walked into Nande-ya which used to be home to Mifune. Upon checking into Yelp, I was none too pleased to find it at just 2 stars but we had already sat down.\n\nLooking over the menu, there really wasn't much that caught my eye but eventually I decided on the Lunch Special menu which actually does apply every day of the week! I thought it was definitely a good deal and went with it.\n\nI had the Tonkatsu Ramen with Ikura (Roe over rice) on the side. It came out on a tray together and piping hot too! I started with the ramen first. The ramen contained ample noodles and had a good amount of garnishes as well: scallions, pickled ginger, wood ear mushrooms and bamboo shoots. I only had 1 slice of char-siu in the bowl though, but it was a pretty hearty slice. The broth was decent, not too salty but definitely missing some of the rich pork bone flavor. Overall, it was an \"okay\" ramen experience. I actually thought my side of Ikura was much better. The rice was definitely Japanese rice and they gave a pretty generous amount of roe topped with seaweed. Each bite definitely provided that richness in flavor, marked by a certain combination of butteriness, saltiness, and sweetness. Umami overload. \n\nOverall a 3 star experience.\n\nWhy 2 stars then?\n\nThough my experience was very average, everyone else at the table commented on the saltiness of their shoryu ramen. Now, listening to my parents complain about saltiness is nothing new, but when you can get my brother to comment as well, you've definitely gone off the deep end for salt. Additionally, the sushi we ordered had rice that was hard and falling apart. Fish was also flavorless, perhaps frozen? And this was more of an annoyance, but the soy sauce dispenser was also assembled improperly at our table, spilling soy sauce everywhere when you tried to dispense into the dipping dishes. A bit of quality control on even these small nuances can definitely go a long way in my opinion.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

I ordered the lunch special $13.95+tax with tempura and curry on rice. While I would have preferred to eat ramen and tempura, the waitress said they were not combinable for the special (which allows you to pick one item from each section). Also, I ordered their hot sake which was ok but strongly tasted of alcohol. The tempura was crispy with 3 shrimp and 4 veggies, but could use more sauce on the side. However, I was disappointed by the size of the curry, as well as bits of ground beef instead of stewed beef. There were also potatoes but no carrots. This seemed pricey for cheaply made curry that was mostly soaked by rice. \n\nMy friend ordered the lunch special with miso  ramen and sushi. His ramen could use more toppings.

Some are better than others, but nothing is amazing - many places just provide comfort, average food for not too much $, which is totally fine.  I was OK to have simple mediocre dinner as long as I didn't have to wait that evening, and the reason I ended up going here instead of next door was that I saw Japanese food menus hanging around, which gave me a little hope.  Wrong.  I ordered soba salad, and my husband ordered a simple entr\u00e9e (can't remember) and also Shumai to start with.  They don't bring our shumai until we are halfway through with our main dishes.  But wait.  Then when they do, they don't give us soy sauce dishes for the shumai.  So, I ask for them.  And wait.  Shumai dish doesn't come with Japanese yellow mustard, either.  So I ask.  The waitress looked confused and said, \"....let me check if we have any.\"  No \u304b\u3089\u3057in a Japanese restaurant?\u3000No \u304b\u3089\u3057 yellow mustard for shumai is like no ketchup for fries.  Sure enough, she comes back with American mustard.  Unbelievable.  \n\nWe shake our heads and finish our food so that we can pay and get out.  And btw all the food is merely OK - substandard for certain, but thankfully it wasn't as awful as everything else.  The same waitress grabs the tray my soba salad plate is on, which had some sauce left, and tilts it so much that the sauce spills on to my lap.  \n\nI couldn't believe I fell for the Japanese menu signs.  \u4f55\u5e74\u3082\u7d4c\u9a13\u3057\u305f\u4e8b\u304c\u306a\u3044\u7a0b\u306e\u3001\u6700\u4f4e\u306e\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\u6700\u60aa", "author": "Harue J."}

I opted for the tonkotsu ramen and potstickers.  Sounds yummy doesn't it?  Boy was I disappointed!  I'm a big fan of potstickers, but I can't for the life of me eat tempura.  And these potstickers were covered in tempura.  I asked the waitress if I could exchange the potstickers for something else.  She said \"ok.\"  A few minutes later she said an exchange was not possible because there were pictures of what I ordered on the menu.  That of course would have been a perfectly acceptable explanation but-for the fact that the menu misrepresented the potstickers.  To boot, my ramen was extraordinarily salty and it took our waitress a good 10 minutes to bring us a glass of water even though people seated after us got their drinks before us.  So in short:\n\nTempura potstickers + Salty ramen + Poor customer service = A few less customers\n\nOn a happier note, since I didn't eat much, I visited Belly Good Caf\u00e9 & Crepes and indulged in one of their crepes which instantly made me much happier!", "author": "R Q."}

Friend was craving a late lunch of ramen, and this happened to be the first place we passed by. I wanted to try the tonkotsu ramen, but when I asked the waitress if it contained any dairy (because I have allergies) her response was that she didn't know, and I should get the mis- no the shoyu ramen instead. Uh. \u306a\u3093\u3067\u3084\u306d\u3093\uff1f\uff01\uff1f\uff01  I'm no waitress, but I thought standard response to queries like that was \"i'm not sure, but let me check with the chef.\" After a brief internal debate of whether to ask her to check with the kitchen, order nothing, order something else entirely or suck it up and order the shoyu ramen, I decided to order the shoyu one.  It wasn't what I wanted, was mediocre at best, and I have no plans to come back.  \n\nThere are lots of little hand-drawn advertisements for appetizers/ side dishes at the booths, but I have no idea what any of them costs because of course they didn't add the prices.  I might've tried something to ease my disappointment over the ramen if I'd known how much they cost.\n\nService was prompt, but we also walked in after 3:00 and the lunch rush.\n\nNandeyanen Nande-Ya.", "author": "Kelsey W."}

Japan Town is always pleasant to visit for that nostalgic feeling when I lived in Japan. I admit Nande-ya is not the best Japanese food. Heck, I would say that most Japanese restaurants in US would not compare to the genuine thing you would find in Japan. However, Nande-ya is convenient and easily accessible to SF dwellers. It is one of the bigger restaurants in the Japan Town, which means less wait time. They also have almost everything you would order in a Japanese restaurant: different types of don, nabe, tempura, sushi, soba, udon etc. This makes it very easy to satisfy all types of cuisine seekers and the different taste of your friends. Price is also quite reasonable at ~$16 per dish. I would recommend Nan-de ya for a quick and fairly decent Japanese meal when you visit Japan Town. Curry with or without tonkatsu is especially my favorite.", "author": "Sam K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-01-14", "description": "I'm writing this review from the perspective of someone who owned (including actually cooking) a Japanese restaurant for 15 years.\n\nI really wanted to like this place. It is in the same spot as a place we used to eat whenever we were in Japantown. When I saw that it had only 19 reviews I assumed ownership was new. Most of the reviews focused on the lack of speedy service. I was willing to give it a try because it was only 5:30pm on a Saturday and they weren't too busy yet (they were completely filled by the time we were left.)\n\nMy wife ordered the Tenzaru Soba, I had the Teriyaki Chicken dinner, and my son ordered the adult size Tempura Udon. We also split the Mt. Fuji sushi roll. All of their dishes leave something to be desired with plating. The tempura for both dishes was just strewn about the plates.\n\nThe soba noodles were spread out across the tray rather than neatly piled into a mound. My wife said the food was good, but I think thats just because I asked in front of our son. I thought the tempura was doughy rather than crispy. I also found the sauce bland and watery.\n\nThe teriyaki chicken was grilled dark meat chicken. It was a pile of random bits and pieces rather than nice thigh filets that I'm used too. They grilled the chicken bits then drizzled sauce over it (you could actually tell the bits were grilled vs. grilled thigh filets that were cut afterwards). The sauce was bland and it had no flavor. It was too watery and didn't stick to the chicken. The miso soup served with the soup was too salty. The salad was simply iceberg lettuce, a couple sliced cucumbers, and a slice of tomato with a miso like dressing. The dressing was good. For $16.50 I expected a lot more wow. Even in the city, this was steep in my opinion.\n\nThe tempura udon for my son was barely enough for him to leave full. There could have been more noodles for the price, and, I don't believe they were cooked fresh. The soup was also bland and lack any flavor. It was a plain udon with two slices of kamaboko and sliced green onions in it. It would have had more flavor and it would have been more filling if it had some vegetables and garnishes in it. Again, the tempura dipping sauce was bland. It also had too much daikon in it to enable any dipping.\n\nThe Mt. Fuji roll was the only thing I enjoyed. I couldn't place the flavor of the sauces on top. The price was right for the ingredients. The plating was actually fine compared to another picture posted of the same roll.\n\nThis restaurant needs some recipe work.\n\nOh, and the service indeed was lacking. We were seated almost immediately; however it took about 10 minutes before a waiter came over to take our order. They provided a carafe of room temperature water. Obviously, this was so they didn't have to check back often. After delivering our food (only took about 15 minutes), we never saw them again until we were 3/4 finished and we needed some more tempura sauce. It took 5 minutes just to flag them down to ask for the sauce because they never looked in our direction. They were too focused on wherever they were headed. They only had 3 waiters working. They needed 5 probably for good service.", "author": "Michael W."}

I've been going to Japantown for years and I usually go to Mifune Don (East Mall) all the time because Im a regular there but it was closed for an hour or so but me and my girlfriend was hungry so we decided to go to a different restaurant. Literally, when I tell you that I had the worst time there ever. I HAD THE ABSOLUTE WORST TIME. Outside the restaurant there were specials displayed like ramen and Cali rolls which is my general combo that I would pay separately but this restaurant had a combo so I thought I'd give it a try. When we sat down, the waitresses were mean and had a straight face the whole time. They asked if we wanted anything yet and as soon as we were going to speak they would say \"oh I'll come back later.\" Finally when we ordered, I asked if the bowl of ramen has the option of spicy or if it had fish cakes in there (which was on the display outside) and they said \"no, put your own spice\". And I said, \"okay, I guess\". So we tried our ramen. The pork was hard, the shrimp were tough and the California rolls look like they've been sitting there for a while. The broth was disgusting! We took two bites and was over the food so we asked if we could pay for the things we did eat and how we didn't like the other. The waitress literally said \"oh sorry, here's your bill\" didn't offer us another option, nothing. They called the manager over and she was just as rude. Making rude comments like \"I bet you do this all the time\" \"you're just trying to dine and dash\" but we literally was willing to pay just not for what was gross. I almost threw up but they did not care whatsoever. Then some other guy came and got in our face saying yelling at us about how that's how restaurants are. I was completely done. But wait. That's not even all. They called security and made a big seen and claimed that we were trying to dine and dash but we never even left. It went all the way to sfpd just for them to give us just a discount. \n\nI wasted time and money there and didn't even get to eat. \n\nAbsolutely terrible. LIKE NEVER EVER GO THERE. WORST RESTAURANT IN JAPANTOWN.", "author": "Rei K."}

Japantown has a lot of good food and I've been here before but now that's it's under new management, it's not that good.  The food was too salty and the servers were rude and clueless.   We ordered from the menu both verbally (told them what we wanted) and visually (pointed at the menu) and we still had to repeat it three times.   We waited about 30 minutes for the first plate to arrive and the others came in 10 minute increments.  We waited about an hr and 6 out of 8 plates that we ordered arrived.   We asked about the other two plates and apparently it was not placed.  The food isn't good, price is high, wait is too long, and service is horrible.  Definitely do yourself a favor and avoid this place.", "author": "Kevin L."}

I've been to this restaurant before (a few months ago), and I have to say that the food was not as bad as it seemed to be (per the cheap-looking menu), which is why I decided to come back again last night. It's not the greatest Japanese food, but for the price, it's decent and pretty good. I recommend their sukiyaki and their beef yakiniku. Hope their large serving of sukiyaki keeps up. You just can't get it to-go though. Service is good but the problem I am writing about is in how they forgot to hand me a part of the tempura dinner set I ordered. It came with a side of California rolls, but that was not included. I called the number listed on their receipt: \"Tel: 415-922-0337\" but was led to a voicemail message which was of a lady speaking in French! I don't know what place that was, but that certainly doesn't sound like it's this Japanese restaurant at all. The number \"(628) 444-3580\" listed on Google, doesn't work either, and only leads you to a voicemail box. I decided to just course the problem through my credit card company to compensate me for the missing order. Other than that, the restaurant is tiny, so, if you're not too uncomfortable about the thought of having the people seated at the tables next to you hear your chatter, then the seating arrangements should not bother you. If it does, either don't talk at all or just eat here by yourself (or, get your food to-go).", "author": "Samantha A."}

I was seated immediately but it took at least ten minutes for a server to make it to my table. I ordered the lunch special of niku-udon and gyoza.  After a long wait, the food came. The gyoza was accompanied by a very small and shallow dish with a bit of dipping sauce, but not enough for six dumplings. I like my gyoza with hot oil and rice vinegar but just try to get a server to come back to your table.  The niku was tasteless. They didn't bother to brown the beef before they put it in the soup.  Meh.  When the bill came they charged me for ala carte instead of the special. It took another long time for them to figure out how to fix that.  In the end I paid the bill and for perhaps the first time in my life, I did not tip. At all. I won't be back.", "author": "Dirk B."}

I was so disappointed the last time I came to Japantown and saw that MIFUNE is no longer! I have been coming to Mifune for 26 years! They still have a location in Japantown downstairs but it's not the same. I'm curious to know why such an established restaurant would up and leave?\n Today I was in Japantown and decided to try the restaurant that is now in their location Nande-Ya. It\u00b4s the same lay out, I always liked the little booths for one towards the back. The menu was one sheet of paper, I did a quick look and was happy to see they kept my favorite meal Tanin Soba (thin buckwheat noodles with egg and beef) also ordered 1 shrimp tempura and croquettes. The meal looked familiar but the broth in the soup wasn't quite the same as I remember at Mifune but my taste has been off for a few days (winter allergies). It was good. Prices are reasonable, I will come back.", "author": "David P."}

The price is moderate, but they have great portions. Avg dish price is about $10-$15. For my party of 5, our total was about $70 before tax.

Mifune was there for decades and I really wish it was still there. Nande-Ya did a little sprucing up of the space. And I do mean a little. It looks like the painters left the job site without finishing. One half of the room was dark and blocked off which was strange. This place is operating on a shoe string. The room is decorated, if you want to call it that, with signs in Japanese advertising food and drink items. Since I don't read Japanese I guess I am not their target market. The menus are printed on office paper and are badly wrinkled and stained, not a good sign. I kept wondering how many hands had touched them. I had udon which was WAY too salty and lacked any depth of flavor. They didn't have avocado so they couldn't make California Roll for me. No avocado???!!!  Service was slow and disorganized. I don't think this place is going to make it. I won't be going back.", "author": "Lee D."}
