We went here the other day after having it on our to-do list for a long time, and it we definitely should have visited sooner. Everything was fantastic. The kitchen is front and center when you walk in, giving you a great look into the work being done to prepare all the meals. It strongly reminded me of wandering into shops for a bit to eat in downtown Ho Chi Minh City. We got seated upstairs and quickly ordered Pho, Bun bo Hue, and Bun Rieu. It came out in 10-15 minutes, a totally reasonable time. \n\nEach of our dishes came with the appropriate greens to add in on separate plates per meal, like Asian basil, mint, bean sprouts, limes, and a couple other greens. The table was also super stocked with all the other toppings like fish sauce, Sriracha, chili paste, soy sauce, and more. Once everyone had dressed up their meal to their personal taste, it was go time! The bowls were all huge, even the Bun bo Hue that only came in one size. I had a ton of leftovers, so I ended up filling a big take-out cup with my leftovers and eating it later.\n\nWhile Pho 2000 was cash only, it was an entirely reasonable amount of cash (unlike Swan Oyster Depot) and was definitely one of the cheapest restaurants we've eaten in.  Each of our meals was between $8.50 and $9.50, so even after tip the three of us ate for about 12 dollars a person. Amazing!\n\nI'll definitely be coming back here for an authentic Vietnamese soup, and I hope to explore other portions of the menu too. \n\nThanks Pho 2000!", "author": "John B."}

These two vietnamese restaurants are very different and I personally prefer Pho 2000. Not only is it cheaper, but also has more options (different options) and is a more wholesome experience (generous size, delicious broth). \n\nMost of the noodle soup comes in two sizes, and the larger size is only $1 more - why would you NOT get the larger size.

Luckily, I usually get the same, which is the #1 pho dac biet, combo, so I didn't mind them not giving us time to decide. However, when they came back with our orders, it looks like they've really started to get stingy. The amount of meat is a lot less than before. I mean, the previous time I came here for lunch it looked like they didn't give us much meat, but this time, it's very noticeable. The meat also looks like it's not as good quality as before as well. I posted a picture where you can clearly see a lot of fat on a slice of meat.\n\nThis place used to be my favorite pho place because they would give good quality of meat and the quantity was pretty good as well.

The thing that surprised me was the extra soup they provided with the entree! I only see this usually in places in the Midwest but definitely is unheard of in SF.

The beef brisket here is incredible--tender and flavorful. The rare beef is the run of the mill what you'd expect. So I'd suggest getting beef brisket and wide noodles.

Though all the tables were occupied on the ground floor, we were told to walk up stairs where there were open tables. It was also about 10-15 degrees hotter upstairs, and everybody who had worn a jacket outside, slowly took them off, the longer they sat upstairs.\n\nWe ordered:\n1. Pork and shrimp (fresh) rolls\n2. Imperial rolls\n3. Small meatball and rare steak pho\n4. Small rare steak and tripe pho\n\nThe pork and shrimp fresh rolls were the first things to come out. They came out rather quickly. You could tell they were just made, which was nice. There was plenty of dipping sauce.\n\nThe imperial rolls took some time. They probably arrived about 10-15 minutes after our fresh rolls came out. They were nice and crispy and served with some lettuce, pickled carrots, cucumber slices, vermicelli noodles, and plenty of fish sauce. We didn't end up finishing them, but they came out so hot and crispy. \n\nMy pho was the rare steak and tripe pho (#9 on the menu). The noodles were a bit undercooked. There was plenty of rare steak, but not really any tripe. The pho broth was also underdeveloped. The depth of flavor wasn't there. It felt like it could have been cooked for a few more hours. It was pretty one dimensional, compared to other pho broths at other pho places. \n\nLe bf who ordered the meatball and rare steak also agrees with the pho broth being underdeveloped. He said that there was a ton of rare steak, compared to other pho places, but the broth was disappointing. \n\nSitting upstairs meant that the service wasn't as good. If you wanted something, like a refill of water, you would either need to go downstairs to flag somebody down, or you would need to wait until somebody came upstairs (to deliver food to a table or to seat a party). I thought that was a bit annoying. I also noticed that food didn't come out in the same order in which orders were placed. For example, we ordered before another table, but because we ordered appetizers in addition to pho, our pho came well after the other table got their pho. We got our pho when they had finished their bowls of pho. There were many awkwardly long pauses between receiving the items we ordered. \n\nThough it was good to try need pho places in the city, I don't think that this place makes it onto our go-to pho places list.

It's like a brewery tour, where you see all the hardware before you get the sampling. Except there is no friendly guide, or pleasantries exchanged.\n\nAnytime you see bowls the size of bath tub's, thats the sign for foodies to GTH out!

The included several different styles of meat has decent seasoning. Except the meatball, it's in between a thawed factory made filler, to a mushy bouncy Goodyear elasticity.

I've tried a lot of pho places and been to Vietnam twice. Nothing is nearly as good here. Some places get close, but IMHO, this is the best. When you walk in, turn left and note the massive cauldron pot simmering with the day's broth. This broth takes HOURS to make and you can really tell. When your soup arrives, take a smell of the fragrant ingredients. You may smell a bit of star anise or the slightest hint of pepper. I love adding in the basil, sprouts, lime, etc into the broth, but at the same time, I always feel the slightest remorse because I am altering such a masterpiece broth. I almost always take the #1, small. It's enough for me, though I would finish a large too. The meat inside is way tender; the brisket almost falls apart before it enters my mouth. The tendon is super tender and the beef balls have the best peppery taste. If I could change one thing, it would be to get the citrus they serve up in Vietnam, you know, those little green things that are bright orange on the inside? They just don't survive the trip over to the States, so we'll have to suffice with lime. If you are dining with friend, compliment with the imperial rolls--never a bad time for those. If you are solo, they will sell you one for $3, sans the lettuce. Can't wait to return.", "author": "Brian J."}

We got an order of imperial rolls and a large bun rieu. My goodness, their portions here are HUGE! And service was great! I have to say, their imperial rolls are the best I've had so far and definitely beat the other Vietnamese places I've been to. They come with a little side of rice noodles, cucumber, carrot, lettuce, cilantro and mint. These rolls are fat and come in 8 pieces (two huge rolls cut into fours). Then we got our large sized bun rieu to share and it was the perfect amount for us. LOTS of crab meat (more than I've ever seen before in a dish) , LOTS of noodles, and a good amount of tomato & the Vietnamese style pork sausage. And the bill turned out to be about $16 total!

Occasionally I run into minor quality issues with meat, but it's not something that keeps me from making this a go-to.  The pluses way outweigh the minuses.  \n\nI love the big $7.45 bowls of Soup.  I REALLY love the Bun Rieu - Crab and Shrimp Flavors, Ground and Fancy Pork with a Tomato Broth and Noodles.  I'd go straight Pho Tai if you want to go in that direction.  They provide ample ways to season your Pho.  I also dig the Pork and Imperial Roll Noodles.  I grew up on these!  (Side note, I grew up in Minneapolis and my Mom introduced me to Bun Salads and Southeast Asian food, in general.  (Particularly Vietnamese food))  I also love the good and super-fast service too.  It is open by 8:30am a lot of days, and, this stuff is good at that hour.  What I do not like is the Tuesday closing, because I almost always find myself wanting it on Tuesday.  Much like Turtle Tower, this wrinkle is definitely a bummer.\n\nOne of my favorite things about living here is being nine blocks up the hill in SF from all this great Vietnamese food.  This is one of the cornerstones.  And, super-unSFlike, actually a terrific value.", "author": "Adam S."}

I hope those of you reading this know that Pho is a cure all for everything. Just saying. Walking home from my office, I checked Yelp and found Pho 2000 in a seedy part of the Tenderloin. Most of the best Pho in SF is in this neighborhood or the Inner Richmond, so it's tough to go wrong. \n\nFor me, it's hard to distinguish good pho from great pho as most in SF fall in either of those two categories. I suppose it usually comes down to the quality of broth and meat/protein thats sitting in your massive bowl. Pho 2000's broth was light and clean. Just the way I like it. Sometimes you find Pho broth can be to \"fatty\" and tough to consume, but I was impressed with how refined this one was.

It's near the more popular Turtle Tower, but Pho 2000 offers something that Turtle Tower does not and that is BASIL. Turtle Tower serves Ha Noi style Vietnamese cuisine where basil is painfully absent. \n\nPho 2000 offers the pho I am familiar with  including the well known accouterments of basil, bean sprouts, lime, and jalapenos. My go to order is the Rice noodle soup with rare steak and beef balls and Thai tea. The Thai tea is a must whenever I order pho. It has become an inseparable combo for me. I am not a big fan of the tendon that is used here so I opt out of it. The beef balls and rare steak are under seasoned and can sometimes be a little chewy but the broth makes up for it. I am a fan of the clove/nutmeg nutty and sweet flavor and these ingredient(s) seem to be more pronounced at the Pho 2000 broth. I'm not actually sure if they use those ingredients but I like the sweeter broth. I refrain from adding the chili oil, hoisin sauce, or Sriracha in fear of hiding the aromatics of the soup. It's a solid pho joint in Little Saigon. It's CASH ONLY so make sure you have a $20 on you.", "author": "David M."}

I enjoy coming here when I want pho because the bowls are big, cheap, and oftentimes delicious. Pho isn't an exact science though, so sometimes when I come it's too greasy, or too bland, or too meh. I'd say 7.5 times out of 10, pho 2000 does it right. \n\nDon't get the big noodles though. BEWARE of the big noodles, they are not like the ones you eat at your grandma's house. The big noodles here are mushy and unappetizing. Stick with tiny noodles and you'll be satisfied with your decision. \n\nI had the imperial rolls once and they were yummy.

Wrong. I keep forgetting that I don't eat like the typical small asian girl, so I definitely could have benefited from a large. HOWEVER, one gold star to pho 2000 for having different noodle types: thin and thick! I am a noodle savant and I absolutely appreciate that choice, and obviously I always go thin with my pho. Not only was portion size underwhelming, the seafood used was all \"faux\" from imitation crab to weird rubbery squid and fish cake. At least have some real fish slices or crab balls and what not.\n\nService is super efficient and awesome, shoutout to the two guys serving on an early Thursday evening. Another gold star for the complimentary hot tea upon being seated! I think the pho itself wasn't tremendously tasty, nor was it the best bowl I've had (SJ holds that title down for me).\n\nIt could be that my taste buds are spoiled by the delicious pho spots in South Bay, but I think that it's a whole combination of the small portion, lack of seafood in the actual seafood pho, scary-dirty health standards, lack of employee cleanliness courtesy (saw the pho lady cough into the kitchen...gross), and all-around lackluster pho just didn't fill me up.

Luckily, Pho 2000 is just  a few short blocks from my apartment and after reading the reviews of the veggie and beef broth being some of the best in town I knew this was just the spot to cure my cravings.  A small hole in the wall restaurant located in the \"little Saigon\" area of the Tenderloin, Pho 2000 is situated amongst a ton of other Pho and Vietnamese spots with constant lines out the door of hungry soup seekers.  We walked into Pho 2000 around 1PM on a rainy Saturday and waited about 1 minute before being sat at a table.  FYI, they double seat people, so if there are just two of you it is likely that they will sit  a solo diner at your table so they really get the most of their space. \n \nBeing vegan, it is always tough to find a spot with a decent (or any) option for non-meat broth.  Pho 2000 offers one vegetarian Pho option in either small or large, thin or thick noodles.  I went for the small with thin noodles as I feel like sometimes the large just means larger amount of broth and not necessarily a good ratio with the veggies/noodles.  My fianc\u00e9 went for the beef Pho with tripe and rare steak (large). One of the best things about eating Pho is the affordable price tag and quick service.  At Pho 2000 you are immediately greeted with a steaming pot of tea and once the server takes your order the food is up in less than 10 minutes.  For me, the small was a perfect size.  Add in the jalapenos, fresh basil, bean sprouts, and of course a little Sriracha and I was in heaven.  The pho included tofu, broccoli, zucchini, bok choy and of course the delicious thin noodles.  After letting the broth take in all the added extras for a few minutes I was left with a perfectly spicy and flavorful, but light, veggie broth that I just wanted to take my bowl and begin the drink it. Mmm.  The large size was just as expected, LARGE. My fianc\u00e9 is the type of guy who can put down food like no one's business and he couldn't even finish this thing but said it was tough to put it down because the broth was so good. \n\nCash only.

You could tell the meat cuts were good ones, not just flimsy fatty ones you get from other places. Their ratio of meat to noodles is also perfect.

I ordered the small #12 (rare beef + brisket) and asked for their flat noodles. I'm SO glad I did, you can tell the noodles are hand pulled making it more delicious.

Couldn't they think ahead and rename it 2020, or go balls-to-the-wall and call it Pho 3000? Pho 2000 makes it seem, well, so Y2K, doesn't it? Like they forgot to switch the clocks back on. Or maybe they just realize a lot of their business is simply spillover from the more impatient diners who were hoping to eat at Turtle Tower next door. To be brutally honest, that was the reason I came here. I was in the mood for pho but not for a queue, especially since I was a solitary diner on a Sunday evening in Little Saigon.\n\nSure enough, there was a sea of formica at Pho 2000 ready for me to take a table for four all by myself here. Hoping naively for a small appetizer, I ordered the $6.99 B\u00e1nh X\u00e8o, which was a huge, greasy Vietnamese crepe that looked more like a deep-fried omelette (see photo). It contained bits of shrimp and pork plus bean sprouts, but it was so greasy that I just scraped the meat and the sprouts off the crepe and left the sad carcass of the crepe in a pool of oil on the plate. I tried to make a salad out of the romaine lettuce leaves that were meant to scoop the crepe but to no avail.\n\nJust in the nick of time, the $6.25 small bowl of Pho Tai Chin arrived. It was satisfying with a hearty broth that wasn't too oily and enough slices of rare steak and brisket to satisfy me (see photo). It's not Turtle Tower when it comes to flavor, but it's a decent enough back-up if you're hankering for pho but not willing to wait for it next door. I may come back for the Bun Rieu (Crab & Tomato Vermicelli Soup) since it's not that common, and I can compare it to the stellar one they serve at Soup Junkies on Market. Or maybe the Pho Chay (Vegetarian Rice Noodle Soup). But not that crepe.

She had her hopes up for Pho, so we settled for Pho 2000. \n\nI haven't always been a picky pho-eater: back in the day, you could give me a big bowl of noodles, spicy broth, any kind of meat, and a ton of jalepenos, and I'd be good to go. I have to admit I've become more specific about my pho since I've had some of the best *cough, Turtle Tower*. But my madre was just happy to be out of the house and in a restaurant, away from the screaming little brothers of mine. She said the only pho she had ever eaten was from Fresh Choice, some six years ago, so it was a no-brainer on where to take her for dinner.\n\nShe doesn't eat meat but doesn't mind if it's been used in the broth she sips, so she ordered the Rare Steak, and I ordered the Rare Steak with Brisket and she gave me all of the meat from her soup, which proved to be entirely too much meat. Also, the noodles were thin rice noodles, rather than the *superior* large flat noodles. My bad for not asking for a substitute. The broth was rich, savory, and comforting, but no doubt swimming with MSG.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty dirty, and the restroom had no paper towels and a hand dryer that was not in a hurry.\n\nI did appreciate that they had both Fish Sauce and Hoisen, which is not always the case. My mom was very happy with her soup, but she is a perma-optimist; I was full by the time we were shuffling out the door to the symphony, but I wasn't too thrilled with my dish. Cash only, and very inexpensive. Our bill was $15. If I do go back, I'll just make better choices for ultimate enjoyment. Or I'll just go to Turtle Tower.", "author": "Crystal C."}

I was able to taste test each of their soups since that is what I am most pickiest about.. and the pho dac biet tasted pretty good, but something was off... I can't pin point it but it wasn't as beefy as I usually have. The bun bo hue also was a bit off... it wasn't spicy like other places that I've tasted but the flavoring was pretty tasty.\n\nI had a bowl of bun rieu. This is by far my favorite noodle soup so I had to try it here at pho 2000 and I wasn't disappointed.

The place is a decent size and I really like that they have an upstairs area although it's quite small, I didn't feel cramped at all. \n\nI ordered a small #13, which was the pho ga (chicken) noodle soup and the bf ordered the veggie pho because they didn't have the beef one that he gets everywhere else. He also ordered the BBQ pork rice plate that came with an imperial roll. \n\nOur food came out pretty fast. So, I was happy about that. This was the first time I tasted the actual broth before I added the hoisin and sriracha and I must say that the broth alone was really flavorful. It wasn't salty or anything. The chicken was predominantly white meat with about 2-3 dark pieces. The noodles were cooked nicely. \n\nThe bf had to add about 4 lemons into his veggie pho because he said the broth was bland and I thought the same thing when he asked me to try it. There wasn't much flavor in it at all. But, besides that, he did like his rice plate. He said the pork wasn't overcooked, the rice was good, and the imperial roll was perfectly fried.  \n\nService was good. Great portions! I also liked how there's complimentary hot tea. The only thing that I found odd was that our waiter didn't ask if we wanted anything else to drink. He was good about bringing us extra lemons for the bf's soup though.

Consensus? It'll do for the usual pho tai but it's nothing to write home about.\n\nBroth was kind of light, not bland, yet neither packed with flavor. Having had murky yet flavorful pho being the standard in San Jose or in Westminster, this place was the definition of okay. It's somewhat light on the msg, perhaps that's why I wasn't slurping water down like a dog or impressed with it's flavor. The beef was notably tender, soup came hot, and the large portion was bigger than the status quo.

The place is small and have another section on second floor.  \n\nUpon entering in you see chef lady carefully cooking up orders and you can smell the rich flavor of the Pho broth cooking.  They use some humongous pots to boil the soups.  The server / waiter escorted me to my table and handed me a menu.\n\nI was ready, i just skimmed through the menu and in my mind I already knew i wanted Pho so i got the Pho Dac Biet , Combination rice noodle soup.  It comes with thin raw steak, meatballs, brisket, and tripe.  You will also get a side of raw bean sprouts, Thai basil, jalapenos, and either lemon or lime.  On the table their is Hoisin Sauce and Sirachai sauce to eat along with your noodle soup.  Don't worry about the raw steak, once they add the soup it will literally cook it   It will also be garnish with chopped onions, cilantro and thinly sliced onions on top of the soup.\n\nThe soup is blazing hot and delicious.  It is not too salty nor oily it is just perfect.  A sip of this soup and you are addicted.  I like how this place gives you a option to use in house chopsticks or disposable wooden ones.\n\nOverall this is the spot, One of my favorites place that i go to for Pho and only Pho.  Cash only and if you plan to come back ask for a stamp card so you can collect stamps and receive a free bowl of pho or appetizer.  \n\nCash only\n\nParking is only street and meter.

With its clean and humble ambiance, there is an open kitchen upon entering where Southeast Asian spices and humongous pots of simmering broths can be seen on display. The upper floor is hardly used and the interior is eye-pleasing with a soft yellow and dark brown d\u00e9cor nicely strung together. At times they would put sports on TV but otherwise the background Vietnamese music is filled with love tales that can get pretty nostalgic regardless one speaks the language or not. \n\nI came on two occasions to try their noodle soup. My order of bun bo hue (6.75) came with a huge bowl of thick vermicelli with plenty of beef, beef briskets, steam pork, pig's blood, and a side dish of fresh cabbage, bean sprouts and other types of veggies. I thought the meat combination was decent with pig's blood nicely cubed to ignite an element of street authenticity. The soup however was bland and needed an identity for it to impress. My follow up visit further confirmed this perception as my huge bowl of pho ga ($6.25) had a generous set of rice noodles that had great texture with decent amount of hand pulled chicken. This time the soup was nicely flavored by spices and fish sauce but the deep essences of a good chicken broth was missing from the equation. My side dish of basil and bean sprouts was not super fresh but still manageable. \n\nBoth visits have rendered similar experiences as their large portions, decent prices and Southern authenticity were noticeable but these contributions were also overshadowed by a doubtful broth--or what I would call it a \"noodles in need of a soul\" experience. Service is never chatty but efficient. This place is not going to be my top choices in the Tenderloin but it was still good to know what I can expect from them. 3 stars for the two legit but decent experiences with the surrounding competition still much preferred.", "author": "Daniel L."}

Meanwhile eat the rare steak or similar portion of meat that seems to have been boiled... which after seeing turned me off to the meat here... Not much of a fan of boiled meat. The broth was oily and lacked flavour so you really have to add sauces and get as much flavour out of the veg side but..................\n\nThe basil and bean sprouts are also not very fresh, & certainly not plentiful, dare ask for a bit more.

Not just the Pho, but 85% of the menu.\n\nTurtle Tower is great and all, but fuck waiting in line when Pho 2000 is literally two doors down.  \n\nHere in The CIty, there are so many Vietnamese Restaurants that specialize in Pho.  In the restaurant industry, you can't survive with that much competition in such a small radius unless your shit is legit.  As a result, you end up with two quality Vietnamese restaurants that are literally 30 feet apart from each other in the TENDERLOIN, and both establishments have managed to stay in business (and expand) for more than I can recall.  \n\nUnfortunately, because of the side by side competition they endure, Pho 2000 has been hit by the \"Tapioca\" effect.  For those who aren't familiar, the \"Tapioca\" effect is a phenomenon where the target demographic (e.g.12-25 year olds for Tapioca) for the cuisine or product in question is presented with 8 different business's that all offer the same items on their menu.  For some reason, despite all 8 places have more or less the same quality of food, a social trend will suddenly infiltrate the entire customer base, and you end up with hundreds of people lining up and waiting for hours to get a menu item that is available from 7 other places and is overall identical to what they'll get at the popular joint.

It's around the corner from my school and for some reason it's our go-to spot for pho, but not because the pho here is extraordinary.  A small bowl is $6.25 and a large is $6.99.  The portions are pretty generous. Sometimes I'll split a large with a friend and not feel hungry when we're through.  \n\nI've had a chance to try a few different soups and appetizers. I really didn't like my seafood noodle soup today. Not enough seafood and it cost more than regular beef pho. I definitely wouldn't order it again. I also didn't like the soup with the tomatoes and ground pork. (Sorry, I'm not familiar with the names) My friend always gets the vermicelli bowl with egg roll and pork and I've never heard her complain about it. The standard pho options are never a bad choice and the spring rolls are fine.  \n\nThe servers are adequate. They never give us a hard time for staying well after we get our check or asking for extra bowls. \n\nThere is definitely better pho in the neighborhood, but Jones St. is more sketchy than Larkin, so we choose safety over flavor 9 times out of 10.\n\nThis joint is cash only, but at least the hot tea is free.

The bean sprouts, basil, and jalapenos were very fresh, definitely making a difference in the quality of the pho. They used mostly white meat which I like and it was not over cooked, very shreddy.

Of course, pho is the number choice (soba or ramen are the runner-ups.)   In our 11 years of friendship,  we bonded over  countless bowls of noodle soup.  And over pho, we solved guy issues, mended broken-hearts, created our life's Plan B's.....\n\nAnd at Pho2000 we made history again. My gf had her usual BEEF PHO and she liked it. (I\"ve had this many times before and it's 3.5-4 Stars  in my book.)\n\n I ordered the GRILLED PORK AND SHRIMP OVER RICE which came with lettuce, tomato salad and  fishsauce for dipping. The meat was tender and flavorfu but fried not grilled. Still delicious!

The open kitchen is widely visible as soon as you enter so you can watch your food being prepared. The staff are very friendly.\n\nAnd the  portions are humongous!

There's a richness here that is hard to describe. My guess is that it's the bones that go into the broth that add a depth and an almost milky quality that I don't normally get from pho' restaurants.

Chairman Bao's line had to be at least 6-7 deep.  Add to that the waiting time after you placed your order.  Other problems included lack of a suitable picnic area, the extremely gusty winds, and the crowds and noise created by the sheer number of people there.\n\nWell- how about Plan B?\n\nWe hiked further up from the festival along Larkin - I knew there was a smallish Vietnamese town just a block or two away.  We ducked into a tiny Pho place and sat down.   Pho 2000 is really small - there had to only be 6-7 tables.  There was an upstairs area, but I'm not sure just how big it was up there.  The menu had all the usual suspects - various noodle dishes, rice plates, egg rolls (both fried and fresh).  The last page had an extensive beverage menu - including Thai iced tea, which was of the very best that I've had outside of Thailand.\n\nMy lunch partners both ordered Pho noodle soup.  They assured me that it was delicious, and very authentic tasting.  It looked and smelled great!  I'll have to give it a try the next time I visit.  I did notice that the fresh condiments for the pho was large, and brimming with lots of fresh basil and bean sprouts.  I also saw that they offered the less spicy anaheim chili pepper slices instead of the traditional (to USA pho places) jalapeno peppers.  Not a deal breaker for me - but die hard heat seekers may want to ask if they have jalapeno slices available.\n\nI ordered the vermicelli Bun dish.  It seemed like a HUGE portion once it arrived at the table.  Heaped ontop of the lettuce and perfectly cooked rice noodles were generous amounts of tender, succulent pork.  I also had them add a few large chunks of deep fried egg roll on the sides.  Once I poured the small bowl of sauce onto it and gave it a quick mix, I was treated to that familiar taste of a truly GREAT dish.\n\nBottom line?  Pho 2000 knows their stuff.  If you want a quick pho fix, this is your place.  I can vouch for the authentic flavors and great tasting food.  Do yourself a favor - pop into the tiny GEM that Pho 2000 and check it out.  You will not leave unsatisfied nor hungry!\n\na very solid 4 outta 5 stars from me - maybe 4.5 if there was such an option.   Thank you Pho 2000-  You rock!", "author": "Gibson T."}

Let it turn the appropriate pink color.  And then shyly dunk in the vat of red hot sauce and fish sauce.  Then place atop your spoonful of noodle.  Slurp.  Wipe red spatter off of nose.

The noodle making kitchen is to the left as you enter with large pots brewing the broth.  We sat down near the back and scanned through the menu although we both knew what we wanted.\n\nHubby had the #1 - combo large ($6.95?) and I had the bun bo hue ($6.95?) along with the imperial rolls ($5.50) and an iced coffee ($2.99).  \n\nThe imperial rolls - there were two in each cut into 4 pieces served with leaves of lettuce, rice noodle, cilantro, mint leaves, bowl of sweetened fish sauce and a few pieces of pickled carrot and cucumber.  The rolls were crispy but the filling wasn't very flavorful so the dipping sauce was needed.  \n\nThe combo large was quite generous with lots of noodles and fixings.  The broth was light and flavorful.  It's served with the standard bean sprouts, slices of jalapeno peppers and basil.  \n\nThe bun bo hue was ok, even though I asked for extra spicy.  Luckily, they have some chili oil that I can add.  There were quite a bit of meat, which I don't care for and only 3 small cubes of the pork blood cake, which was good and a few thin slices of the pork loaf.  The soup was ok, not rich like it should.  This was served with thinly sliced cabbage, bean sprouts, slices of jalapeno pepper and a kind of leave that's long and narrow with a nice scent/taste.\n\nThe iced coffee was good.  They brought out the dripping coffee and a glass of ice - while we were eating the pho, the ice melted.

The banh xeo here is probably one of the best ones I have had at a restaurant - super crisp on the outside, slightly chewy on the inside, and very generous with the pork and shrimp fillings. Most places tend to skimp on the fillings, but not Pho 2000. \n\nThe bun bo hue had a really flavorful broth, and again, lots of beef - no skimping here! I didn't try too much of the pho, but the broth was really rich. The nuoc mam/fish sauce here is also pretty tasty - perfect for dipping my banh xeo.\n\nI like the loft setup of the place - we sat on the second floor and watched them cook at the front of the restaurant, an open kitchen setup. Service is really friendly and fast. Ambiance is very modern and casual. Lots of people were eating here (Vietnamese people speaking Vietnamese!), so you can rest assured that this place is not catering towards those who do not know their Vietnamese food.\n\nNot a huge fan of the name of the place, but who cares when the food is good and the service is friendly and efficient?", "author": "Yvonne W."}

Funny that other reviewers also have an issue with the name of the business. \"Pho 2000\" evokes to me a pretty cheesy name, some sort of technological or modern reference that has no bearing in the pho/restaurant business. If anything, Pho 1850 (or some turn of the century date) would have been more appropriate in evoking a long standing business, with old, mysterious ways of cooking pho broth. Maybe we'll revisit this place in 30 years and it might make more sense. \n\nIn any case, on to the food - I was having a sore throat, so I had some shivers and lack of appetite. We were supposed to go to the pho place literally around the corner, but being that it was already closed, we went to this one instead. As pointed out above, the name made me raise an eyebrow as to question the quality of the food within, but luckily for them, they had a 'Yelp loves us' sticker, which reassured me that this wasn't just any hole in the wall place, and on we went.\n\nI ordered the pho ga (raw beef) and, despite the fact that I couldn't eat much of the vermicelli noodles, the soup itself was pretty tasty and it had a fair amount of meat there. The place was clean and well lit as well, so I can see myself keeping it as an option for vietnamese should I be around the area.", "author": "Rogerio F."}

I'm a bun (vermicelli) junkie, so I order the standby bbq pork & imperial roll over vermicelli at every Vietnamese restaurant I go to. It's my barometer for tastiness. Pho 2000 does not disappoint.

All this atop a plentiful pile of vermicelli (which, by the way, was not stuck together- as is the case in some Vietnamese restaurants). There was a little saucer of Magi sauce and not the typical fish sauce that they expect you to douse on your food. The imperial rolls were pho-bulous. Thick wrapper enveloping stuffing of ground pork, silver noodles, mushrooms and carrots. \n\nI'm a selfish b*tch so I didn't offer any of the rolls to my friends (hey- I only get ONE with my order). Apparently, they looked so damn good that my friend ordered an appetizer dish for himself. His rolls came out in this ginormous plate with two huge pieces of imperial rolls, vermicelli noodles, pickled carrots and cucumbers and a stack of lettuce, basil, cilantro and mint.

I was fine for a good 30 mins after, i did feel crazy full for a few minutes, and after that came utter sickness. I turned my bathroom into a private vomitorium that was most unpleasant. Did i eat too much? Maybe...? Was the food bunk?  I don't know...now maybe you can understand why i don't know how to score my experience? Is Yelp strictly for pre or post vomit? Is there a secret 30 minute rule?? Are 'roman rules' in effect on Yelp?\nRegardless...sorry P2K, not gonna risk another tossing of my beloved cookies to risk it again.", "author": "Karl H."}

We walk in...\n\nI am enveloped by the amazing smell and sounds of sizzling beef. We look around and see all the tables on the lower lever were filled by asians (YES!). We're seated by friendly waiters dressed in bright yellow and red outfits and the beautiful sight of Hoisin Sauce (cha-ching).

Both were very tasty. The Bun Rieu was spot on and to my surprise the crabmeat cakes were plentiful. Already satisfied with the soup the noodles i ordered came, and they smelled delicious. This was a simple dish consisting of egg noodles and chicken, but you could taste the \"wok hay.\" I haven't had vietnamese this good since I lived in San Jose.

Breaking it down to components, I cater to customers who favor \"taste,\" \"service,\" \"price\" and/or \"decor.\" Sometimes you are just a poor dude who just wants the best bang for his buck (like me). Or you want to be treated like royalty. Maybe you want to pretend in your glamourless life that you are sitting in a fancy restaurant. Perhaps like most people, you mainly look for taste on top of these things. As a result of having to add up separate sub-ratings on a 4-star scale (with 1 star reserved for special bonuses), my ratings tend to counter the inflated bimodal averages you see all over Yelp. But heed my reviews, and having lowered expectations will probably enhance your eating experience. I would recommend any place I rate 2 stars or greater. Also, all my ratings are rounded down, so read and look at my actual overall score.\n\nConclusion: 2.75/5\nThat said, Pho 2000 is a pretty good place in terms of the food. I see myself returning here for years to come!\n\nDecor: 0.5\nThis place has two stories! That's something reserved for fancy Chinese places. Or places that barely have any room on the first floor. Still, we always sit at the big table dangerously overlooking the table below because we come in a gaggle of several first-year law students. It's a nice view.\n\nFood: 0.75\nIt's good. It tastes like your standard issue pho. But then pho is good. So it tastes good. I tried an egg roll, and that was good, too.\n\nService: 0.25\nWell, at least they seem to speak some English. Not sure if they understand it besides the names on the menu, except one guy who seems like the manager. I've asked for something (like water, napkins) and not gotten it multiple times, until I ask the manager. Though I suppose bringing bowls of hot soup upstairs is no baby feat.\n\nPrice: 1\nFair for the amount of pho, unlike Hai Ky Mi Gia.

There's so much meat that you will run out of noodles before meat, as you reach the bottom of the bowl. The restaurant itself is very clean and they have a mezzanine in the back which gives them a good amount of seating. The confidence and pride they have in their product shows, as they put the kitchen in the front window for all to see.\n\nI do agree with Wakako that the broth is a little sweeter than you'd typically find.

It was me and one other customer in the joint waiting for service, and I was sitting almost in front of the kitchen. It had me wondering if 1. my server was too slow, or even worse 2. their broth is not kept piping hot. I'm hoping it was the former, 'cos a lukewarm broth is a crime. So based on taste, I'd give the broth 3 stars, but I hope to come back again and have a better experiece.\n\n2 stars for the WATERED DOWN (read \"weak\") iced coffee that was skimpy on coffee and sweetness. They serve it to you already mixed, which made me wonder if it was instant. Is it?\n\nTo pipe in on some of the previous reviews: yes, it's very clean inside, and the bathroom was spotless; in regards to being served from a tray, I had the opposite experience whereas my server brought over my pho bowl with her hands (which attests to my broth not being hot) -- I thought this was strange, but didn't think anything of it till now.\n\nMy server (the young girl, possibly the owner's daughter) was very sweet, and the taste of the pho broth was good, so I hate giving this place a lower rating.

I dig the fact that the kitchen is open and in the front and that the service is speedy (I usually have tea and a server at my table within 3 to 5 minutes of entering). Not the biggest space but its a cozy and clean place. I tend to alternate between the #8 pho combo (rare beef and cooked flank) and the pho ga (chicken soup). Both are delicious and usually arrive to my table hot hot hot with a large handful of cilantro and green onion on top (The pho ga is usually close to scalding hot; I should know, I've burnt my eager tongue twice). The usual plate of fixins (sprouts, thai basil, lemon) grows with the number of people ordering pho (which I find refreshing because in quite a few places I'll get the same amount whether its just me ordering pho or there are three of us;it's frustrating and I don't like fighting for sprouts :( ).

However, the beef was really fresh as well as the beansprouts/basil.  Portion was average.  Soup was a bit weak for my tastes.  When the check came, it looked a bit high to me.  (Yes, I had asked for the additional noodles for $1 extra but I could not see any discernible difference in quantity between my bowl and my coworkers).  It turned out they had forgotten to incorporate the 20% discount on the meal per their advertisement. (20% during first two weeks).  Overall, not a bad place for pho but not a Must Eat either.  I'd like to see how the place holds up after a few months (will the ingredients stay as fresh and will the sauce bottles stay as clean?)", "author": "Wayne C."}

Tried their rare steak, tripe, and brisket Pho.  The broth is okay, only slightly better than the typical sub-par Pho broth in the city, but still lacking in depth of flavor.  Stay away form their Bun noodle dishes.  They lack flavor and the meat portions are small. Also tried their Bi Cuon (shredded pork roll) and was not impressed.  Overall, I was happy to find a passable Pho place close to home, but I will still drive to Pho Queen in Milpitas for fantastic Pho.

So this Sunday we decided to get some really good Pho in Little Saigon in the TL. We head torwards a place I've been to that I wanted to take her to and pass by this new place. We walk in and see that it's pretty clean since it's so new. We order the crepe lettuce wraps which were a little oily but still really good. Then I ordered my large number 1. Number 1 is always the Beef Pho special. Beef balls, tripe, tendons, you name it. Soooo good. They don't skimp. The broth was super tasty and Vietnamese food is rarely skimp on the portions but this place was extra generous with the portion of meat they put in. Definitely a gem.

This place doesn't look like much from the outside but it's pretty decent on the inside. Service was super friendly and nice. Two of us ordered Pho Tai Nam and Beef Bun. OMG portions were enormous!! We only finished half of the two dishes and took the rest home. The broth was nice and light, I didn't feel overly full or gross after. I think this Pho had the most meat I had ever seen in a bowl of Pho. The bun was pretty good, though slightly light on flavor so I had to add some hoisin.

The flavors are wonderful, the noodles are pretty much perfect, and the meat is perfectly done.  Their Thai tea is also definitely worth checking out.  However, it was the service we received the second time we came here that made it worth two stars.\nThe first time my boyfriend and I came here, more during dinner time, the service was very nice.  Hot tea was promptly served, the waiters were courteous, and even further one of them complemented my tattoo (he had one himself).  The pho was brought out almost as soon as we ordered it and it was a great dinner\n\nAs I was craving it again recently, we decided to go back for lunch.  The restaurant was a bit more full, and there were different waiters this time around.   I have to mention this part, only because it is relative to this review, we were the only non Asian diners in the restaurant.\nOnce we sat down we were promptly given lukewarm tap water.  Everyone else there, including someone who came after us, were given hot tea! When the waiter came to take our order, he didn't even stay long enough to finish - my boyfriend had to ask another waiter for a drink because the first walked off to talk to someone else in the middle of our order.  Once the pho came, it was again, wonderful.  However, right away I was asked if I needed a fork, which was not only offensive but highly presumptuous.  The whole time we ate, I noticed the staff alternating between sorting receipts and watching us eat.  \nThe overall rudeness ruined my appetite and made for a very awkward dining experience, and I definitely wont be coming back here since it seems some of the staff treat some people very differently.", "author": "Sam M."}

Of the handful I've tried in this city, the pho here has a deelicious broth, FRESH veggies, and FRESH chicken. What I love about about it even more is that 98% of the time, the chicken come in very lean pieces (with all respect to those who likes chicken skin, fat, & ligaments). This meal has great overall value in your health and budget. The small bowl more than fills me up. The service is prompt and friendly. The place is pretty clean looking.

And there were plenty of broccoli and bok choy in it too. Sometimes, veggie pho is bland and boring- but this was the good stuff. The downsides were that the tofu were just big  cut up bricks of tofu and I like mine fried in my pho. The sprouts that came on the side were literally brown and I couldn't even think about putting them in my soup without gagging a little. My friend's rainbow drink was just carelessly slopped together. Service was pretty good actually. We arrived RIGHT before it got busy and say upstairs where we could look down at our food being prepared. I will go back for sure. The prices were good for what you get. It wasn't dirty and sketchy as some other Pho places. I suppose I dropped my star because of the location. When we walked out, we were literally harassed by a crackhead the ENTIRE walk to the car.

I was visiting san francisco and decided to walk around \"little saigon\" (the SF version of little saigon is weak!).  I was in the mood for some pho and started looking at restaurants in the street. I almost ate at the turtle place but it was busy so I decided to keep walking and by chance I walked by this place. At first I was hesitant to go in because from the outside it looked like a shaddy hole in the wall restaurant. I walked in and notice that they had an open kitchen near the door which i was extremely impressed about. This showed me that they were clean and was not afraid to let you see how they prepared the food. I ordered the large pho which was like .75 cents more than the small.  Totally worth it!!! . When my pho came out, the bowl was HUGE. It was the first time I had ever been to a Pho restaurant where I couldn't even finish my bowl of Pho. I was full and still had a lot of noodles and meat left over. The soup was hot and  delicious. The eye of round meat was cut thin just the way I like it.  everything was Perfect . Note: I am very picky when it comes to pho and this was literally the Best Pho place I have ever been to. Every time I go to a pho restaurant here in LA I always have a complaint regarding the pho. ie most pho place dont cut the eye of round steak as thin as it should be. most of the time the steak is cut too thick and when the steak is cut too thick it become really chewy and hard to eat whereas if the steak is cut thin then it is soft and easy to eat.  The meat at this place was sliced perfectly thin. Since Ive been to this place, all other pho places here in LA cannot compare.

My biggest gripe might be more of preference than anything else - the broth was a touch too sweet.  I am sure there are people that would have no problem with this, but I tend to like my broth more savory than sweet.  I will say that I can vouch that the broth is made in house as the staff came by several times with huge vats of beef bones for the broth.
