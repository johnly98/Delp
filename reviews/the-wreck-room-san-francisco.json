Stopped by The Wreck Room on Thursday, May 24th around 6pm. Luckily, we beat the crowd as we were able to find two seats at the bar.\n\nWe both ended up doing four rounds of Coors Light (the tall cans) and Jameson neat. Not sure how we each managed to finish 96oz of beer in a little over two hours, but the game wasn't going well, so maybe we were trying to numb the pain? The whiskey pours were good. I'm more of a liquor than beer drinker, so when my gf ordered us the beers, I needed to add the Jameson.\n\nThe atmosphere here was great. Plenty of TVs for viewing the game. The bartenders are also super sweet. Very friendly and attentive. They just kept the rounds coming. It is a little dark and loud in here, but that's part of the charm of being at The Wreck Room.\n\nMy gf loves this bar and I can see why. Great place to grab some drinks while catching a game.", "author": "Elena N."}

Me and my fianc\u00e9 visited this establishment on 01-30-2017\n@12am.

I asked the Bouncer (shorter Mexican man with a brown hat) to check the restroom before I entered. The minute he walked into the women's bathroom this unknown man exited the stall. I promptly walked into the bathroom did my business and exited. As I'm exciting from the restroom to the dart playing area I notice the man ( who was in the women's restroom ) flipping off my fianc\u00e9.

North Carolina hometown buddy and now longtime San Francisco transplant Brian C introduced me to this spot.\n\nThe Wreck Room is like a college bar except it's in the middle of San Francisco. The Saturday night we went, the crowd appeared to be mostly twentysomethings. While the crowd was a little diverse, the atmosphere and vibe were predominantly fratastic. I can see why this place is popular. There are several TVs, great for watching sports. There's an old school CD jukebox. The highlight, though, is probably the assortment of bar games. They include:\n\n- A pool table\n- Basketball \"Super Shot\"\n- Skee ball\n- A boxing arcade machine with an actual punching bag\n- One dart board\n- One shuffleboard\n\nSpacewise, the bar can seat about 20 customers. There are tall tables and bar stools in the front for about 20 more. Finally, there's a nook in the back with two tall tables and seating for another 20. The gaming area has a wide open space in the middle which is nice if you need breathing room. That is unless, of course, a dance party breaks out. The overall condition of the bar and games is alright. This place definitely has some years on it and, again, reminds me of a typical college town bar.\n\nI can't say I enjoyed my time here because it was uncomfortably hot inside. It was an unseasonably warm upper 70s/lower 80s Fahrenheit day. Many older buildings in San Francisco don't have air conditioning. The Wreck Room is on the ground floor of what appears to be an older building, so I can't fault them too much. However, it doesn't change the fact that I wanted to leave solely because the heat was near unbearable (and I'm a warm weather person). It was also pretty busy that night, so the collective body heat, humidity, alcohol, and odor only made matters worse.\n\nI'm sure The Wreck Room is more fun and entertaining on cooler nights.", "author": "Daniel B."}

Seriously, why can't more places offer shuffleboard??\n\nAs the name suggests, The Wreck Room offers plenty of games to entertain drinkers and non-drinkers alike.  In addition to shuffleboard, there's also skeeball, hoop shot, a boxing machine, darts, a pool table, and more.  In a way, they're like the D&B of bars, minus the food, overpriced drinks, and ticket arcade machines.\n\nWhat makes The Wreck Room even better though is that the bartenders/staff are friendly and decently generous with their pours.  I can't say I was unhappy with my Makers Mark neat, nor with my pint of Shocktop.  It's just too bad they don't serve food like Buckshot, though people might never have a reason to leave then.\n\nSince we were here for a meet up on a Wednesday night, I can't say how things are on a normal weekend, but I did see some of the \"bro crowd\" others have mentioned.

The people there were pretty rude/unfriendly/hostile, unless they were trying to hit on girls.\n\nTheir dark and stormy was so awful, and I'm not even a picky drinker.

Hell, even the bartenders say \"brah.\"\n\nThe noise is unbearably loud. Between all of the people, the open space, and the jukebox, it's really loud.

As much as I hate to admit it, those are my people. Unfortunately that was the early days before everyone knew about it. Saturday night was packed, hot, sticky, and the bad/unabashed kind of fratty. Felt like a typical sports bar where you had to scream to make conversation with your friends. Sadddd because this place had so much promise. Let's be real though - I'll probably still go back now and again.", "author": "Joanne S."}

These bars were too preppy/swanky and overcrowded for my style. \n\nI live in the neighborhood and ventured into the Wreck Room and found what I had been hoping to find in SF. A bar with tvs, games, friendly people and music. I met up with some friends, watched  March Madness games and sipped on $3 PBRs. \n\nI will definitely go back here! The music could be turned down a bit when it's still daylight but overall good place. \n\nI'm sold.", "author": "Sarah H."}

It does get packed because it's so great but just get there early and you're good to go.  Obviously if you aren't in to the \"marina crowd\" than you probably won't like it, but I am a Pac Heights honey myself and I am into the Marin/Pac Heights/Russian Hill crowd.  I think this place is a great addition to the Northern SF party scene.", "author": "Daniella S."}

I dig sticky floors, crappy jukeboxes, pool tables stuck in tight spots, and pee party style bathrooms. The Wreck Room succeeds admirably on all accounts! We had an unofficial holiday party last night and other than a real pain-in-the-ass parking situation (certainly not the Wreck Room's fault), it got off to a great start. BUT, later on, when the place filled up, it was difficult to move around the bar and nearly impossible to get a drink. Again, this isn't the fault of the bartenders who are friendly and attentive, but just an issue of logistics and a space that's way overfilled. I'm not sure I liked the crowd that much. There were some douchebag guys who were lacking manners and a few people who were throwing some weird looks, but I'll just tally that up to the instant jerk issue that appears when you add alcohol to some people. I'd come back here again, but only if we managed to rent the place out and we could provide our own music instead of the mediocrity on the jukebox.", "author": "Jason W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-10-15", "description": "Ended up at this Bar last Saturday after a big group bday dinner.  If you're searching for a not too crowded bar with fun games and a young crowd, this may be a good spot.  The only serious downfall (besides fancying myself way older than everybody else - the crowd looked YOUNG) was that the place was seriously, seriously HOT. If I'm sweating in a bar, I want it to be because I'm dancing, not because somebody failed to keep in mind that semi-crowded rooms full of (mostly male) energy tend to get hot. After trying to catch up with friends while sweltering, I finally decided to take off - right around midnight (which, coincidentally, is the ideal time for me to turn in anyways).", "author": "Rachel N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-04-06", "description": "What an awful, terrible, waste of time.  Horrible experience on multiple occasions. The regular cliental are annoying to be around, many fitting the stereotypical \"bro\" archetype. The drinks are incredibly overpriced.  Even the service is terrible.  It took an average of seven minutes to get one drink on a week day, when it wasn't even that crowded.  The service was no help whatsoever.  After a drunken slop tried stealing my overpriced drink, neither the bar staff nor the \"bouncer\" helped me in my efforts to get the drunk thief out of the bar.  The runners of this so-called business do not wish to help the honest, paying patrons in lieu of better serving creeper, drunken criminals.  And their games, which should be their one redeeming factor, are always occupied, most of the time by these irritating archetypes aforementioned.  I would highly suggest drinking at ANY other bar in the Polk area, even \"brother bar\" R Bar, which is at least run half decently in comparison.\n\nWreck room is a total wreck and a complete waste of time and money. I can't wait to see it go out of business.", "author": "Jasper K."}
