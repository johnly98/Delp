We decided to order delivery through DoorDash on Monday, September 3rd at 8:11pm. Our order arrived at 9:16pm. We live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Chicago Dog: Pickle spear, tomato wedges, sport peppers, diced onion, neon green sweet relish, yellow mustard, celery salt on a poppy seed bun ($7.50)\n*Philly Dog: Sirloin cheesesteak, provolone, onion, jalapeno ($9)\n*Spicy Western Dog: Grilled onions, jalapeno, spicy sriracha BBQ sauce, topped with crispy tortilla strips ($8)\n*German Style Brat: House brat, onion, sauerkraut, brown mustard ($7.50)\n*Chili Fries: Topped with shredded cheddar and diced onions ($7.50)\n\nAll dogs ordered were Niman Ranch Beef Dogs. (You can also pick a chicken or veggie dog.) I started with the chicago dog. Simple and tasty. I always get a chicago style dog when I visit IL, so this was reminiscent of that. Next up was the german style bratwurst as I wanted a sausage. This one was okay. The sauerkraut was a little too mushy for me. The roomie got the spicy and philly dogs. The beef on top of the philly one was dry, so I would pass on this one next time. The spicy dog has a good amount of heat, so if you want spice, this is the way to go. I enjoyed the chili fries as there were no beans. (I hate beans so I always wonder if the chili served is beanless.)\n\nGood spot if you're craving a few hot dogs. Though for me, I'd suggest ordering two since one wasn't quite enough.", "author": "Elena N."}

On a recent foodie adventure I wandered into this tiny little shop called Dapper Dog. First thought... cute name! You obviously come in for the hotdog and it generally runs in the $8 - $10 range. Seems pricey, and I'm sure it is, but we want big and tasty, right? And in hotdogs and sausages it what counts most. So let's toss out price on busy Castro street and go with what's important...\n\nDapper Dog comes to the rescue for how a good hot dog should taste like. Great options, maybe a dozen or more to chose from, and all great choices. For me, I went with the Chili Dog with a load of Cheese as a topping! I think it ran me around $8 and with the Italian soda as a drink I paid about a Hamilton. Other choices include the classic which is the only hotdog under $8, the Bahn Mi hotdog for Vietnamese food lovers, Seattle, Chicago, New York, San Francisco hotdogs too. I was told the Salty dog was popular amongst the drunk crowds and why not since Dapper opens til at least 1am. \n\nIn the end, I recommend Dapper Dog to everyone, and heck no, you don't have to be dapper like Leonardo DiCaprio in The Great Gatsby. You can be an average Joe with a juicy hotdog fetish. And nope, this has nothing to do with fly Dachshunds...", "author": "Eric R."}

As I walked into Dapper Dog to order my lunch there was a huge long line outside the Castro Theatre as patrons were lining up to experience festivities for the Jewish Film Festival.\n\nI have been vegan for 19 years now. Dapper Dog is veg-friendly as they will customize vegan any of their dogs in a whopping 15 styles. To customize it vegan they will omit non-veg items on the select styles yet some styles come default vegan if you are ordering a vegan dog. The vegan dog option is a Tofurky Beer Brat.\n\nI asked the gentleman working there what were the most popular dogs at Dapper Dog he said it was a toss up between the NY, Chicago, & the Philly.\n\nThe Chicago Dog looked interesting so that is what I went with as never had a Chicago Dog before. The Chicago Dog comes w/ tomato slices, diced onions, pickle spear, sweet green relish, sport peppers, & celery salt all on a poppy seed bun.\n\nI enjoyed it thoroughly. I'm glad I got to experience a Chicago Dog & awesome that they have vegan options here.\n\nMy family was born in NYC yet I now live in the East Bay & one of my brothers is in Chicago where his wife is from. I will be sure to take him here when he comes to visit.\n\nThe gentleman at Dapper Dog says a lot of Chicago transplants attest that it is the best Chicago Dog in San Francisco as they carry both the sport peppers & authentic green sweet relish that is hard to find.\n\nLook forward to returning to try some other customized vegan dogs!", "author": "Shane S."}

Hence, Dapper Dog is a welcome addition to the hood!  With an array of themed hot dogs, they feel more bougie than bland concession stand.  Good size meat on an over sized bun that is usually too bready unless you choose a dog with a lot of toppings.\n\nLoaded Potato Croquettes: Who needs hot dogs when you have these deep fried balls of deliciousness?  Melty Cheez Whiz at the center of a mashed potato, bacon and chive ball with a crispy outer shell.  These should seriously be standard issue at every bar, bowling alley and fast food joint.  I actually like them better than any of the hot dogs I've tried.\n\nChicago Dog: Had the nice tang of a typical Chicago-style dog.  Maybe a little too heavy on the relish and too light on the celery salt.  But tasty enough for your Chicago fix.\n\nPhilly Dog: A little disappointing.  The \"steak\" was clumped to together like frozen Steak-umms you didn't bother to separate.  There was no Cheez Whiz just provolone; how can you have a Philly Steak without the Whiz?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-08", "description": "There's something highly contrived about this hot dog stand. And since it's the Castro, it's not really a stand but probably a placeholder for some failed leather strap-on shop which blows someone's theory that there can never be enough leather strap-on shops in the Castro. But wait, this is the gentrified Castro, so it was probably going to be a baby yoga studio. Instead, it's a compact spot where you can choose from a dozen specialty dogs, all just a little bit more excessive than at least what I want a hot dog to be. Two guys appear to run the spot. They are attentive to the orders but not very personable beyond that.\n\nNot that I was looking for a little chit-chat but even the battery-operated women at Saigon Sandwich say more than these guys. It was not as challenging to decide on which ones I wanted to try. I immediately discounted the Napa Dog which sounds like a cosmic joke with arugula, crumbled blue cheese, diced dried apricots and a house apricot sauce. Say what? The Philly Dog doesn't even sound like a dog. It's a cheesesteak sandwich shaped like a dog, right? And if I wanted a Classic Dog, I would have gone to Top Dog and eaten it off the top of a garbage can like I did back in my Cal Bear days. That pretty much left my order.\n\nThe first was the $6 Chicago Dog. That was quite an extravaganza with a Niman Ranch beef frank topped with chopped onions, tomatoes, yellow mustard, sport peppers, pickle spear, celery salt and a strange neon-green relish, all on a poppy seed bun (photo: http://bit.ly/1DZpkqE). Quite a glowing mess to eat but decent enough. I just had a weird feeling the florescent relish was making me look like an Austin Powers fem-bot extra. I rather liked the $6 Banh Mi Dog, a paean to the classic Vietnamese sandwich with a frank nestled with sliced cucumber, pickled carrot, jalape\u00f1o, cilantro, chopped peanuts and a splooge of sriracha mayo (photo: http://bit.ly/1x7qNZE).\n\nI liked the crunch of the ingredients although again, I have to say it was kind of a mess to eat. You'd think two topping-heavy dogs would be enough, but I decided to order a $3 side order of French Fries, and there were quite a few (photo: http://bit.ly/1Fwfj6G). The net result was that I ended up getting three little boxes of food with no offer of a bag, but I managed to snag one of the two stand-up sidewalk tables available to gorge. That was my good fortune since the 17th Street Plaza has reverted back to derelict central with the unexplained disappearance of the red chairs and tables. On crowded sing-along nights at the Castro Theater, you may want to carry your own folding stool if you want to have a seat.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...big topping-heavy dogs in the Castro...so what's new?\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...it's a stand\nSERVICE - 3 stars...not much for small talk but gets the orders right\nTOTAL - 3 stars...the distance between Chicago and Saigon is a whole lot shorter with these dogs on parade", "author": "Ed U."}

A yelper saw my bookmark, paid a visit to Dapper Dog, and pre-paid for my Banh Mi Hot Dog (exactly what I would have ordered). Such a rare, random act of kindness. Thank you, Albertino M.!\n\nDapper Dog is a closet sized shop selling creative twists on the classic schlong...hot dogs taken to the next level to be exact. They're open every day until 11 pm and until 2:30 am on weekends. On the menu are 10 hot dogs, from a Classic dog, Chicago dog, to a Philly dog (w/ cheese steak), and even a Breakfast dog (w/ eggs, bacon & cheese). You get a choice of a Niman ranch beef, chicken, or veggie hot dog. Hot dogs are $5-$8 which is reasonable considering Niman ranch beef hotdogs go for over $4 apiece. There's also two sides available; savory side: Loaded Potato Croquettes ($5) and a sweet side: Cinnamon Roll Waffle ($3). CC's accepted.\n\nMy Banh Mi Dog ($6) was incredibly delicious with all the authentic layers of a legit banh mi: salty, sour, spicy, and sweet: http://bit.ly/1Dd8AO0. The toasted sesame bun nicely cradled the beefy schlong (good snap) and all its toppings. Loved the satisfying crunch from the fresh veggies (pickled carrots, cucumber) and the sprinkling of crunchy peanuts. A generous drizzle of sriracha mayo gave it a spicy creamy finish that had me licking all the corners of my mouth.\n\nYou can't have a good schlong without balls. The Loaded Potato Croquettes (4 for $5) were unlike anything I've ever had: http://bit.ly/1uxxzGN. Fried to a golden brown, the hot balls of bacon and chive mash potatoes had a cheesy center that oozed out like lava upon biting into. Even though they have a different filling than Porto's infamous balls, they may have them beat!\n\nMr. NSS also got into the schlong action with the Wake Up Hot Dog w/ bacon, fried egg, and cheese except he held the cheese ($8): http://bit.ly/1uYhD6i. He loved it. I didn't taste it but I could tell it would be bomb with the oozy egg yolk lacquering the schlong like lube.\n\nIt's a two man show and service was very friendly and efficient.\n\nThere's no seating but I think if they moved their condiment bar to the counter top in the kitchen, at least there will be a small standing area to wolf down that schlong.\n\nParking is very difficult but we got lucky. Next time, I would have someone drop me off while I get the schlongs and balls.\n\nAgain, thank you to Albertino M. for the yummy Banh Mi Hot Dog. Since I enjoyed it so much, the right and only thing to do was to pay it forward. I hope the next person enjoyed their free schlong as much I did. And, I'm hoping they paid it forward as well.

Many of them are for hot dog variations that employ bacon, kraut, blue cheese and eggs, to name a few. I can respect that a hot dog is a blank canvas for many diners. \n\nFor me, there is only one hot dog. The Chicago Hot Dog, and it's the unit of measure whenever weighing the merits of a hot dog stand. \n\nI gave Dapper four stars. A very respectable mark. It takes into account the sesame seed buns, electric green relish, celery salt.  What makes a 5 star? \n\nSteamed Vienna hot dogs. Not grilled. Not any other brand. Also consistency regarding the sport peppers.  I've had actual \"sport peppers\" there and I've had substitutes. Both are hot /sweet, but the true sport pepper is about an 1\" to 1.5\" long, skinny and green. Not round-ish and yellow. Admittedly, the true sport pepper is very difficult to find and often \"imported\" from Chicago by those who appreciate the difference. \n\nService is excellent and so is the pricing. \n\nAs someone who has had a hot dog (or sausage) at nearly every vendor listed under hot dogs, I give Dapper the highest mark in town. \n\nps.

I know, you're thinking that's not saying much, because we mostly make stupid decisions after drinking, but trust me Dapper Dog is amazing!  So much better than the alternative pizza places nearby.  My friend was having his birthday at nearby The Lookout...yep Sunday day drinking.  I stayed for a few hours, but then my stomach started to hurt; I knew I should have eaten beforehand!  \n\nSo we knew we were going to hit up Dapper Dog afterwards.  We decided on getting an order of the potato croquettes ($5 for 4), The Wake Me Up ($8)  for me and the Philly Cheesesteak ($8) for him.  I asked for to go since I didn't know if I'd finish my hot dog.  They charge 15 cents per box (his and mine) just an FYI.  I don't think they charged for the box for the croquettes since they best fit in there vs the hot dog dish thingy.  They let you choose from a veggie dog, chicken dog, or a beef dog. After a few minutes are dogs were ready to devour.  My Wake Me Up, looked slightly different than Cherylynn's pic.  Hers was a whole over easy egg, while mine was scrambled egg chopped up, and topped with bacon pieces, and grilled onion, and shredded cheese.  A lot of the cheese hadn't melted all the way though.  Nonetheless it was delicious and totally settled my stomach!  The hot dog though filled with fat filled ingredients actually wasn't that greasy.  His Philly Dog was pretty awesome too, beef hot dog topped with lots of sirloin beef pieces, melted provolone and onions and jalapenos.  A few minutes after we got our dogs our potato croquettes were ready.  These were like fried mash potato balls with diced up bacon and chives and filled with cheese.  They were piping hot and golden brown.  The cheese oozed out when we bit into them.  Overall, a very solid and satisfying affordable meal!

Everything is super fresh and blends perfectly. Jalapenos, peanuts, cucumber, carrots, delicious sriracha aioli. Price of $6 is totally reasonable, especially compared to other nearby Castro haunts.

The Banh Mi Dog was packed with flavor and had a siracha mayo sauce on top.  The Philly Dog was a hot dog with meat and cheese on top.

(Sorry folks, What Up, Dog? does not count as a good hot dog place.  What Up, Dog? is exactly what's wrong with hot dog places in SF: lowest common denominator, no effort put in, no love for the product, and ignorant MFers just keep going back for more.)  \n\nDapper Dogs = Good-tasting hot dogs made with Nieman Ranch beef.  Nice and thick, and we all know girth is more important than length, right? Lots of interesting toppings, including EGG (!!) and bacon, pickle spears, and all the usual suspects (chili, cheese, onion, etc.)  \n\nHere's some tips from your ol' pal, The Food Dude:  tell them to cook the dog well done.  I know, hot dogs are made from cooked meat, there's really no reason why we couldn't eat them at room temp.  But hot dogs taste better the more you cook them.  So, let them know: \"I\"m not in a rush, I want you to cook the wiener til it's crispy!\"  \n\nTip #2: ALWAYS ask for the Brown Mustard.  Yellow Mustard is fine for your kids, but anyone over the age of 16 should be eating brown, \"deli style\" mustard.  Grow a pair, Margaret, and order the brown.  \n\nGood buns, thick franks, and they don't skimp on the toppings.  Honestly, what's not to love?  They're new - they opened for business for less than 3 weeks ago - so give them a little time to get their sea legs and work out the kinks.  But, they serve a good product, reasonably priced for the size and quality.  I can't think of a better dog in SF.", "author": "FoodDudeS F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-02", "description": "A hot dog place in the Castro...I'm surprised no one has actually thought of it before.  It's perfect.  \n\nI found this place after visiting my friend in Noe Valley.  We grabbed a coffee at The Cheesery and stumbled upon Dapper Dog.  I had seen the signs up, but was happy to see it had opened up after seeing \"under construction\" a few weeks before.  I'm always down to try new places and how often do you see a hot dog spot?  The place is quaint.  It is fairly small, but has a warm feel to it.  For the space they are working in, I commend the fact that they can handle all their orders in a prompt manner.\n\nThe menu has 12 varieties of dogs and a few side menu items like fries and croquettes. I like it. It's simple and easy to maneuver and I appreciate the fact that there aren't 30 things to choose from. They use quality Niman Ranch dogs and have other options like veggie or chicken dogs for you heathens out there.  \n\nWhat I have had so far:\n\nBanh Mi Dog:\nI would say this is my favorite one.  I love banh mi's, but wasn't quite sure how it would be on a dog.  The flavors meshed very well and the freshness of the carrots, jalapenos, and cilantro really cuts through the meatiness of the dog.  The sriracha mayo is a great touch and the crushed peanuts were a nice finish to it.  They killed it with this one.  There were a lot of flavors going on, but not overpowering.  Definitely recommended.\n\nChicago Dog:\nI have never had a Chicago dog, but from what people are saying on here this one is pretty legit.  I enjoyed it like all the other dogs on the menu.  It has neon green relish as if Homer Simpson made your hot dog, onions, mustard, celery salt, and a poppy seed bun.  Pretty traditional hot dog items for the most part so you can't go wrong.\n\nReuben Dog:\nI actually liked this more than I thought.  It has sauerkraut, thousand island dressing, and swiss cheese.  I was expecting it to make me feel heavy and full afterwards because of the swiss cheese, but the sauerkraut really helps with that by cutting through with its tanginess.\n\nSalty Dog:\nBACON.  Pickle spear. Mustard.  I don't really need to write anything else.  It tastes as good as it sounds.  They also don't use cheap, crappy bacon.  \n\nCroquettes:\nGet them if they haven't run out.  They make these by hand and run out pretty quick.  It's a delicious, crispy potato ball that has cheese oozing out of it.  \n\n\nThe staff is super-friendly, they've provided a fresh take on hot dogs, and they're open late which is nice too since most places in the city have a tendency to close early.  Check it out and see for yourself.", "author": "Jonathan V."}

Every time we walked through the Castro we would walk by this place anticipating it's opening. Well, today was that day. The first time he walked in they informed him they weren't quite open yet, but to come back in a few hours. We stopped in for dinner tonight and he finally placed his order. While not quite a Chicago Dog, it was the closest thing he's seen since living here. \n\nA little pricey for a hot dog, but not terrible either. I had the Philly dog, which was pretty much a Philly Cheesesteak with a hot dog added in. Slightly bland, but still filling. Their choices are not what you'd expect from a hot dog joint, but I guess that's what makes them 'premium'. The potato croquettes would be amazing if they were filled with real cheese instead of nacho cheese, but the sriracha aioli was definitely it's saving grace.\n\nBest part is this place is open until 1, aka, we never have to suffer from the terrible decision of getting Curry Boyzz when we're drunk again.

Dapper Dog is without question, the best hot dog I have ever had. \n\nI had the Wake Up and the Cubano Dog. Both were easily awarded 10/10 on my rating scale (to be fair, I believe that all hot dogs are 10s, but these would have been 10/10 even if I didn't believe that).  If you removed the hot dog, these would be excellent sandwiches.  The addition of a delicious, perfectly cooked dog makes this something I would kill for.\n\nIt was hard to abstain from the hot dogs in the Mission as I left the bar, but I was rewarded for my patience. These weren't greasy dogs that only make your stomach feel worse when you wake up in the morning. They were absolutely perfect. I might eat one every day for the rest of my life and I'm pretty sure it would just never die because my body wouldn't be able to say goodbye to Dapper Dog.\n\nThe only negative is that they don't open until 11AM, because otherwise I would get one for breakfast every morning before I hopped on Muni.\n\nI love you, Dapper Dog.", "author": "Matthew G."}

The Chicago Dog (topped with pickle spear, tomato, onion, mustard, celery salt), The Wake Up (bacon, egg, cheese), The Banh Mi Dog (pickled veggies, peanuts, mayo), and the Cubano Dog (ham, swiss, pickle, mustard). I've also tried the Reuben Dog.   While the menu is very creative, I have to say that \"hot dog\" doesn't necessarily \"go\" with some of these themes.  I mean, there's a reason why when you order a Banh Mi at a Vietnamese restaurant (or a Cubano at a Cuban place), it never comes with a hot dog option.  Hot dog is a greasier, saltier meat than the meats normally put in these sandwiches.  That said, I order them and I largely like them, but have had a few moments where I've thought \"I'd rather be eating a Banh Mi instead of a Banh Mi hot dog\" if you catch my drift.  But when you're drunk on Castro Street, beggars can't be choosers;  you should try Dapper Dog for yourself.  Be aware that this restaurant is not a sit-down place, there's some very limited outdoor seating on nice days, but inside the restaurant itself has no tables, just two counters in the window you can sort of lean on.  This place is basically grab-and-go, which is just fine for a hot dog place, not unlike a street hot dog cart.", "author": "Dave M."}

If you are craving something new, definitely get the Bahn Mi dog, it's great.  If you want to make it a full meal, get the fries on the side.\n\n--\n\nWent back to try the Chicago Dog, and, to my delight, it now has proper sport peppers!  The poppy seed bun was also a lot fresher and soft this time.  The dog is still enormous and a bit hard to fit in my mouth, but I'm gonna chalk that up to local fare, we like our big wieners in the Castro.\n\nDespite my last review being entirely on the Chicago Dog, now that I can get over that mental hurdle and move on I think it'd only be fair if I review this place as a not just a place to get Chicago Dogs but as a place of many great hot dog offerings.\n\nThe Bahn Mi Dog is really great, despite sounding like a potentially bad idea.  The ingredients are very well balanced, which is super important in a hot dog, and gives a very consistent flavor across all bites.  The beef dog mixes very well with the cilantro and sriracha mayo and the chopped peanuts surprisingly go very well in the mix.  Another great SF fusion of street food and SE asian cuisine, definitely recommend trying it.\n\nThe Reuben Dog was pretty good, very much what you'd expect in terms of taste.  I think for the most part I'll be sticking with pastrami and rye for my Reubens (Rossi's Deli across the street has a pretty good one), though I can see myself having a hankering for this again.\n\nThe french fries are pretty standard fare, nothing fresh cut or anything, but they also hot, crisp, and plentiful so I definitely can't complain.  That they are now able to also offer fries in such a tiny hole in the wall is a plus in my book.

The wait was worth it though. \n\nAtmosphere 1 - Not a problem for me but it's just a hole in the wall, really tight inside & there's some stand up tables outside the shop. Just plan on taking it to go or chowing down outside.", "author": "Raquel L."}

Not at all inviting.\nWalk down the street, and check out, \"Sliders,\" where the burgers are sizzling over the flaming grill.  It makes me want one.  Plus, there's a whole buffet of FREE condiments from which to choose.  Plus, they have places to sit down, while you eat your burger.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-30", "description": "I think the hot dogs have too many bells and whistles.  I got the Wake Up Dog and while the the bacon was nice, the egg was perhaps too much as I couldn't actually take a bite with the egg and the hot dog at the same time.  It also felt dry because no sauce coated the bottom of the bun. I suppose I could have handled that by adding some ketchup or mayo (though it seems that they didn't have any mayo, which I find to be a bit odd and a super quick fix); however, with all the bells on top, it would have been lots of wet bites of egg and cheese and still dry bites of hot dog. I was also disappointed that they were out of the croquettes.", "author": "Jeremy G."}

I find myself thinking about getting a hotdog there on the way home.  In particular I like their Bahn Mi and Chicago Dogs.\n\nThe service is really friendly and the owner (Bazel? Basil?) is very passionate about what he does.  Every time I go back they make things slightly better and fix some broken processes.\n\nWhy not 5 stars?  Two reasons:\n\n1) I'm not a huge fan of the prices (i.e. could be a dollar lower), but it is high quality good food.  However, I shouldn't complain.  It's worth it.\n\n2) What makes me most unhappy is the lack of good sides (fries, salad, cole slaw, beans, etc.).  They have chips there and croquettes but nothing fantastic.\n\nI've heard that they'll be keeping their favorites up on the menu and changing/trying new dogs every so often.  I'm excited to try all their current dogs and the new creations that will be coming soon.", "author": "Tom L."}

We were so excited about the prospect of this place, it seems like such a great fit for the neighborhood and they have a unique product. The first time we went, at about 1PM on a Sunday, there was a sign on the door saying that they had run out of ingredients and that they wouldn't be opening that day. Really? They couldn't make a run to one of the many markets within walking distance to pick up supplies? The second time we tried on the subsequent weekend, this time at noon on Sunday (which is supposed to be the time they open), we waited patiently with other customers outside until about 12:10, when the sole employee unlocked the door, popped his head out and said that he needed another 30 minutes to prep because he was the only person there. This obviously is not the fault of that employee, he was gracious enough under pressure. The fault lies squarely with the management for understaffing and poor planning. \n\nWe will not be planning another attempt, needless to say. I can only imagine how many other potential customers are feeling similarly disenchanted. What a shame.", "author": "James W."}

Undercooked very salty dog with no \"snap\" to the casing. Sauerkraut was the wrong texture, mushy without much taste.  Yellow mustard? Not on a New York.  Ugly presentation, wrapped in foil which covered everything inside with mustard making it hard to eat.  An unappetizing mess, and it took 15 minutes. No Hot Link, Bratwurst, Bockwurst, Italian, Polish, etc., just beef, chicken, or veggie sausages.  Ugly, cramped space. Nice people, (they offered to refund my money) but completely overwhelmed by the Noir City crowds at the Castro theater.  They don't seem to have enough space to cook more than a few dogs at a time. Rosamunde, or Top Dog does a much better job.  But those places are more about the sausages than the toppings. Maybe I'll try a Chicago sometime, since Moishe's Pippic is no more.
