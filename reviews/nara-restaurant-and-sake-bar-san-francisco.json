I guess maybe my standards are too high?\n\nWe came here for my husband's birthday dinner, excited to try the happy hour and the omakase. Happy hour wasn't spectacular. $1 off sake, $1.50 per oyster. $5 hand roll. My husband had the omakase but was not Impressed. It was just standard. He said the rice was hard on the edges of each nigiri piece. The fish did NOT melt in his mouth like other omakase we have tried. Was it because we went there on a Monday? I don't know! But the rice was obviously not cooked perfectly. Maybe it wasn't fresh?\n\nMy chirashi bowl was standard. Nothing extraordinary. Baby girl had chicken karaage because what else do babies eat a Japanese resto? No kids menu. Boo. Yelp says the resto is kids friendly. That means I expect a kids menu. Given, our server did mention that we could order a cucumber roll that wasn't on the menu for baby girl, but my baby only has one tiny tooth, so that wouldn't work. The truffle fish appetizer on the spoon was pretty tasty, though.\n\nFor what we paid, I expected more. The 10 piece nigiri omakase for $40 is not a bad deal but you get what you pay for. \n\nI will not be returning to this restaurant. There are way too many other restos with omakase that satisfy me in the Bay Area.", "author": "Regina B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-08", "description": "I loved Nara so much! As someone who almost damn near never enjoys their sushi experiences most of the time (mostly bc of different fish allergies), for a sushi spot like Nara's to blow me off my feet really made it special to me.\n\nOne thing that definitely caught my eye was the availability of A5 Wagyu Beef, which is usually an uncommon thing most places don't normally offer on the menu. Anyone who LOVES meat has to definitely spring for it, as it's arguably some of the best meat out there alongside Kobe beef. The marbling of the meat really compares to no other, and also has such great mouthfeel to it as well. If you're down to splurge, I'd definitely order any of the menu items involving the A5 Wagyu Beef.\n\nWagyu A5 Sushi Roll ($24) - Highly recommend if you're here. Though pricey for rolls (I mean Wagyu Beef was always a pretty penny to be fair), it was completely worth. The light smoky saltiness of the A5 Wagyu Beef was divine, and I'd totally get this again.\n\nShrimp Pot Pie ($12) Also AMAZING. The flaky pot pie crust complimented the warm toasted center with the marinated shrimp in the broth. I would totally get this again if I came back.\n\nAgedashi Tofu ($5) Lightly fried tofu topped with Bonito flakes and I think dashi sauce? Overall really good, as it was light and airy though flavorful. Definitely wouldn't mind picking this up again.\n\nAs someone who has pretty annoying allergies in terms of seafood (ie raw meats and other types of fish), I also really appreciated the diverse amount of options alongside their sushi, with some vegetarian options, which was also a plus. Normally for me at a lot of other restaurants there usually are a few/next to no options left for vegetarians and people like me who struggle with various fish allergies, so for them to have such an expansive menu was a plus.\n\nAnother bonus I had was not having any annoying allergic reactions after eating here. For me at many sushi restaurants, that's a pretty rare occurance, because I'll always tend to have some sort of cross contamination allergic reaction later on from something going on behind the counter. For one of the first times ever at a sushi restaurant, I didn't have any other problems post eating, which leads me to believe that the workstation behind the counters is also kept really clean!\n\nThe service was incredible. I showed up in the last half an hour before closing and they were extremely amicable, though it was last call. They also let us take our time eating, though we closed the tab early so they could close up shop around us faster. Everyone was extremely cordial and prompt, and I have no complaints on the service.\n\nAlso if you write a review and come back, you can get an order of hot sake on the house, with proof of course. \n\nDefinitely in love with Nara, and I'd give them a 5. As someone who usually has issues going to a sushi restaurants, Nara really swept me off my feet and I loved it here. The quality of the food here, service, and overall ambiance was just great. Definitely coming back here again in the future!", "author": "Allison O."}

Good sushi with great quality and with affordable prices are even harder to come by! If you're looking for the latter, you definitely want to give this place a shot. I came here to celebrate my friend's birthday and we had a table for 13 reserved during prime time dinner time, on a Saturday night. I arrived a lot earlier than my party and gave the hostess the name that the reservation was under. She said that she couldn't seat me until more people in my party arrived. What's the point of the reservation then if you're going to make me wait for a table that is already reserved. Oh well, minor set back into the evening.\n\nFast forward to dinner time. My friend and I split the 10 piece omakase (35 dollars), Special K sushi roll (18 dollars), and the handroll tasting (15 dollars). Yes, I know that's a lot of food but hey we're both swimmers, that competitive swimmer diet never goes away. The 10 piece omakase was good. It was my first omakase experience so I didn't know what to expect. The only thing I wish that they did was label what type of fish we were being served. \n\nI know that it was salmon and tuna. What type of tuna? I have no idea. The special K roll was also tasty. I liked it because they didn't have a lot of rice as most places do. This place was quite the opposite, little rice to lots of \"stuffing\" lol. The handroll was by far my favorite, again not much rice and a lot of fish. If you're new to sushi, this is what you strive for sushi places to have. There are three handrolls to the order (1 tuna, 1 yellowtail, 1 salmon).  They definitely make you feel like you're getting your money's worth. \n\nThe ambiance was also attentive. They came to fill our waters without us asking and constantly checked in with us to see if we needed anything. The food came out very fast as well. I would definitely come back here for sure. Oh! And minus one star because that waitress that took our picture for our friend's birthday said \"okay, now open your eyes!\" Bitch, what?!", "author": "Cynthia T."}

We came in on a Sunday night and there was no wait at 6pm.  Once seated, we were given their happy hour menu (5pm-7pm) and regular menu.  Their happy hour menu was very limited.  However I did order $1.50 oysters off of it, but probably not worth it.  They tasted whatevers and were teeny tiny.  Everything off their regular menu though was amazing.  We got the following:\n\nSpecial \"K\" ($18)- This delicious and amazing roll included yellowtail, avocado, picked jalape\u00f1os, topped with amazing seared butterfish and truffle ponzu sauce.  OMG this is a must get for rolls.  The seared butterfish was generous on top and melted in your mouth.  It is so worth it and beautifully presented.  \n\nLoco Spiderman Roll ($15)- This roll included spicy tuna, mango, deep fried soft shell crab, scallions, and topped with spicy mayo and eel sauce.  The roll had the deep fried crab inside of it but also two soft shell crabs that were deep fried also sat on top of the roll.  The presentation was really nice.  It was also well worth the money and definitely delicious. \n\n10pc Sushi Omakase ($35)- I don't share so this was all for me.  I asked for no tuna and they were nice enough to make sure it was replaced with something else.  The Omakase experience was amazing.  The beautiful presentation came out on a long wooden slate of wood.  I got 10 different pieces of nigiri.  All of my sushi pieces were super fresh in quality and all huge pieces of fish.  I recommend this if you are new to this place.  I was really glad I got it.  \n\nHandroll tasting ($15)- This tasting included tuna belly, albacore belly, and salmon belly.  If you want handrolls then this is great for the value.  They were generous with the fish and all packed.  They were fantastic. \n\nScallop Nigiri ($8/2 pieces)-  These were so good we ended up ordering a whole bunch.  Each scallop piece was huge, sweet, fresh and delicious. \n\nLive Sweet Shrimp Nigiri (MP)- These were also oh so yummy.  It was served with the head fried.  For two shrimps it was quite the presentation.  \n\nWe were all very happy with our orders and left totally satisfied and full.  I thought pricing was cheap for what you get.  All the fish quality was A+.  The customer service was excellent.  They were awesome about substitution or any alterations.  The inside is kinda small but a very cute intimate vibe.  There is also bar seating.  Reservations is recommended.  There was a huge wait when we were leaving.", "author": "Cat N."}

We had to send back the \"Baby Got Back\" and \"Yellowtail Collar\" because both were severely overcooked and dry - even the waitress agreed.

The selections did not seem especially unique or thoughtful. The hotate sashimi dish $11 was probably one of the cuter ways I've seen scallop displayed lately. The oink belly dish $11 was too salty and basic. The uni nigiri was alright. I can't remember much about the rolls, they were okay, but not something we'd order again.\n\nMy brother ordered the spicy chicken karage $8.00 and some rice $2.00. The chicken karage was definitely OFF-tasting. I know. I know. Why chicken at a sushi place? But he eats what he eats. After I noticed he only tried a bite or two and left it alone, I tried it myself. It wasn't like normal karage or normal spicy karage - it had a weird dried pepper flavor. It was almost bitter. The off-tasting chicken (like it was old and not fresh) was overly deep fried or wok fried (which made it extremely dry and hard). The dish was a hot mess.\n\nI was curious to see if the server and/or management would notice that we hated the dish and do something about it. \n\nThe server noticed after a while and asked us what was wrong with the dish and asked if we wanted it taken away.

We were still charged for it although it was inedible. \n\nThe $8.00 chicken karage was a drop in the bucket, so I didn't want to demand it be taken off our bill, but it clearly should have been. \n\nThe inedible spicy chicken karage combined with the so so sushi offerings made me want to venture out to the other (unlimited) sushi places in the city.

From the ambience to the service to, most importantly, THE FOOD, this place hit the nail on the head.\n\nMy friend and I came here on a Saturday night around 7 pm and there was ~a 15-20 minute wait. The server had us put down our name and phone number, and after walking around the neighborhood we got a text letting us know our table was ready. The inside was intimate and dim (great for a date!) but also a bit noisy/lively (also good for people watching!); it was clean, both casual and hip, and they had two bathrooms inside (score). We ordered the hamachi truffle appetizer, Kikumasa Taru sake (super fragrant and sweet cold sake), big boss roll (yums), sake bomb roll, and got a hand roll tasting (toro, bin toro, and sake).\n\nThe hamachi truffle did not disappoint and was delicious and fresh! They came in 5 spoonfuls of secret sauce (ie. truffle oil ponzu), yellowtail, and jalapeno. The kikumasa taru sake was on the sweeter side which I loved, and had just enough for 3 shots per person (I believe it was around $17 so not bad at all). The big boss roll was my favorite because the fish tasted super fresh and tender and had pretty huge meaty pieces; the sake bomb roll was also delicious because of all the sauces and all that but the big boss takes the cake IMHO. My favorite of all the dishes, however, were the hand rolls!!! They serve three different types of fish and omgaaaaaahd the fish was so effing fresh and just melts in your mouth. If you come here you have to try the hand rolls: the unsung heroes of Nara.\n\nI'd recommend this place for a ladies night out or a second/third date with a special someone (it's a bit loud for a first date you might feel like you're yelling the whole time if there are a bunch of large groups haha). This place had a cool vibe, the servers were super nice and gave us helpful suggestions on what to order, and I believe our total for an appetizer, drinks, roll and one hand roll (there were 3 hand rolls but my friend had 2 while I had 1 because I am a model citizen and superb friend thankyouverymuch) came out to be around $40/per person. Not bad for all the food you get! \n\nI will definitely be coming back to Nara again :)", "author": "Joy K."}

That roll, in and of itself, is a four-and-a-half star item. My friend had a veggie roll, which he remarked was certainly among the best he's ever had.\n\nThe Omakase -- a ten-piece Nigiri sampler -- was on the weaker side of things; certainly weaker than comparable samplers at Ozumo or Otoro. It featured mostly the lower-quality and less interesting fish, with only one piece of tuna. I inquired as to the variety of the tuna, but didn't get a straight answer. There was, of course, no Toro on that platter.\n\nI'm a little disappointed to have to give them three stars. I expect that I may give them four on the next visit if I stick to rolls, which seemed stronger in quality. I do note that they do mostly more modern/American-style rolls, with fewer traditional-style rolls on the menu. (For example, I didn't see a Kappa or a Tekka Maki anywhere.)", "author": "John L."}

Within the next 15 minutes, the place filled up. The walls are filled with large sake bottles, and the wooden planks on the walls gives the environment a very modern feel. \n\nService: Right when we were seated, the server brought a glass jug of water and cups. The cups are absolutely adorable. Allowed us several moments to settle down. Check-in with us to see if we have any questions.\n\nWe ordered several dishes: the spicy handroll tasting, sake bomb, chicken karaage, oink belly, and shorty glaze. \n\nMUST TRY THE OINK BELLY. This piece of pork melts in your mouth. I sat with amazement when the pork disappeared. It's kind of like a thick chunk of bacon, BUT BETTER. And the presentation was beautiful. ALSO MUST TRY THE SHORTY GLAZE! The large chunk of meat falls right off the bone. The outside is seared and glazed. If just eating in inside of the meat, there is a bite to it, and not quite hitting the \"melt in your mouth\" standard. The piece that's stuck to the bone, was the most flavorful. \n\nThe spicy handroll had three types of fish (tuna, hamachi, sake). I would recommend trying the regular handrolls. We couldn't taste the freshness of the fish because all we could taste was the spiciness. The sake bomb was mediocre. Can never go wrong with salmon and avocado. I will say the presentation was too much. The pink flakes scattered on top of the sushi in a pile was overwhelming. There wasn't a wow factor to the sushi. The chicken karaage was extremely moist. It wasn't as crispy as I thought it would be, but none the less with a squeeze of lemon and the dipping sauce, it was solid. \n\nWould definitely come back again.

A party of 5 people came in after us, as well as another couple. We're all waiting and our table is called, we get up and another server tells the hostess that the couple that came in after us asked to be seated at that table, so she gave it to them. The hostess told us to sit back down and wait again. Me and boyfriend were pissed, but we waited. Then the group of 5 gets seated and we consider walking out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-05", "description": "I went here with a group of friends on a Sunday night for dinner before catching a show. We started off the night with the both hot and cold sake and the two dozen of the Miyagi oysters. The oysters tasted fresh and were accompanied by lemon, ponzu, and hot sauce. The whole tabled liked them so much, we had to get another round of two dozen.\n\nThe other appetizers we got were the mushroom tempura (enoki mushrooms), Mr. Tako Balls (panko-fried sous vide octopus in white truffle mashed potato balls), Agedashi Tofu, and a couple hand rolls (spicy tuna and salmon skin). The pace the kitchen prepared the food was fast and we had a steady stream of dishes to pass around before we got to our main courses.\n\nEveryone at the table got the 10 piece omakase. As the chefs were making the nigiri we watched in amazement as they prepared seven individual planks of wood holding each person's meal. To be honest, I can't recall exactly what each piece was because I was too busy staring at the beauty in front of me while our server was explaining them all. \n\nEach piece of sushi was very fresh and the rice they used complemented the fish well with vinegar notes and had good texture to it. Everyone had smiles all around as we savored our planks piece by piece - some people eating as slow as humanly possible to make the experience last longer. I distinctly remember \"In The Air Tonight\" by Phil Collins playing in the restaurant while one of my buddies was having an out-of-body experience eating the Hokkaido scallop nigiri (LMAO). The iconic drum break hit right when he took the bite. It was hilarious. We weren't ready for our omakases to come to an end so we also ordered a plank of Main Uni to cap off the night. Usually they come in twos, but they accommodated us by allowing us to get seven - one per person.\n\nOverall, our party's experience at Nara was amazing. Our server Yumi was super attentive, a pleasure to talk to, and made sure we were all taken care of. Everything we ate and drank hit the spot, and we were having such a good time they even gave us another bottle of cold sake on the house! I'm not claiming this is the best sushi I've ever had, but the combination of the quality of the food with the service and atmosphere made for a 5/5 dining experience.

I haven't had a good oyster in a while so we stopped in for a quick pre-dinner snack. It wasn't very busy. Maybe a few other occupied tables but the bar area was full. Luckily we didn't need to sit at the bar to take advantage of HH. I got 3 oysters ($1.50 each) and a kimchi shrimp aco ($2). My bf wasn't too hungry so he got a draft Aasahi beer. Their drafts (only Aasahi and Sapporo) are dollar off during HH. They also have a spicy salmon hand roll and spicy tuna roll for $5 each. Not a big HH menu but decent. The oysters are the miyagi kind, small but salty, briny, sweet and fresh. . Really good. In addition to a lemon and hot sauce, it's served with like a sweet soy sauce, almost like a tempura sauce, I liked it better than the lemon. The taco looked small. But it was actually a lot of bites. The shrimp is deep fried. Also tasted like it was bits of shrimp, not a whole one. And it's covered in like a hoisin and hot sauce. I didn't actually see the kimchi but tasted the spiciness. I could prob eat a few of these. Haha. Poor reception inside so I wasn't able to look on yelp to see what else is good here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-30", "description": "The lowdown: 70-80% of the sushi pieces give you amazing freshness-for-value, while 20-30% other pieces leave you slightly gagging. Their fish supply manager needs to learn better quality control, but otherwise most of their stuff is great.\n\nSince their 10-piece omakase is in the super cheap sushi range ($35), it deserves to be compared to similar shops. I'd say the average seafood freshness here is below that of $45 omakase places like Eiji Sushi, Kazu Sushi, and Daigo Sushi, but it is much fresher than another $35 omakase place (Wild Sushi in Inner Sunset). \n\nI really enjoyed the seared hamachi on a spoon with ponzu truffle, while another dish of yellowtail poke left me sort of queasy. The rock shrimp taco was superb, as were the scallop, escolar, butterfish, hirame, and salmon in my omakase. The other bites varied between strangely chewy or oddly and clumsily cut -- and 2 pieces of sushi were just plain fishy. This is such a pity because 2 bad pieces can really drag down a 5-star experience into a 3-star.\n\nIf Nara can do better quality control so that they eliminate the 20% of the less fresh fish, they would be a super stellar budget sushi bar. I'd say it's even worth raising the price a little to make sure quality control is better.", "author": "Ken H."}

We ordered the tonkotsu ramen ($14), the karrage (boneless fried chicken ($7) and these Korean buns ($7). \n\nKorean buns were great- quite spicy with the chicken but big fan of the presentation and the bun itself was soft and easy to really bite into. \n\nKarrage came with a spicy mayo and was quite good when it was hot - though I've had better karrage! Breading is crispy when hot so don't wait too long bc it doesn't taste as good cold! \n\nTonkatsu ramen was different- probably bc the pork belly has grill marks and a smoky flavor. The broth wasn't as thick and definitely not as spicy as other places. Again, interesting bc of the smoky flavor from the pork. Loved the bok Choy and fresh bamboo shoots that came as toppings.\n\nService was good and fast - would come here again for sure to try some other dishes!

It's nice to be greeted by the chefs when you enter and leave the restaurant :)\n\nShould definitely take advantage of happy hour! 5-7pm. $4 draft beers, $5 Large sakes, $1 raw oysters (not to be mistaken with the other miyagi oysters on the menu Bc the happy hour ones don't come with tamago and scallions). Loved the oysters though! My first time having just lemon juice, tobasco, and ponzu on my oysters. They tasted super clean, and not gritty or dirty. \n\nOther cold and hot plates we tried:\n\n1) Spicy pork buns : good, but was expecting more in taste, pork was a little dry. \n\n2) Hamachi truffle : A MUST TRY! 5 pieces of hamachi served in fantastic presentation. Hint of truffle, cilantro, and jalopenos. Loved it. Probably the best thing I had at Nara's. \n\n3) Hand roll sampler: good choice if you want to try otoro, sake toro, and toro hand rolls for a fairly decent price. Although they were good - I was not impressed in taste or anything. I probably have had too many hand rolls before to think these were amazing or anything. IMO it was lacking the extras like cucumber, scallions or cilantro, and even sauce. A little ponzu wouldn't have hurt. \n\n4) Ray Ray Tako's: meh. It was my least favorite. Basically just cooked octopus with some sweet sauce, some baby tomatoes and radish. Nothing spectacular.\n\n5) also had the edamame which I ordered with spicy butter and garlic butter. It was awesomeeee, wished it was more spicer, but I am a huge lover of garlic, probably the second best thing I had there. \n\nDef a nice sushi restaurant though, I'm glad I dined here!

I came around 6:30 on a weekday and it's definitely not crowded at that time. The restaurant had the daily specials written on the wall which is great. I would highly recommend the bar if your can. You really do see the chefs perfect every dish they make, even Togo boxes dishes. Here is what I got :\n\nMr Tako Balls is a lot more carbs than a typical takoyaki, but then I realize it has truffle mash potato in it. It's not bad, but the carbiness that comes with potatoes can be tasted. \n\nHamachi truffle is the bomb dot com. Have it to start your night with the miyagi oysters and you won't be disappointed. I really like the ponzu they dress over the fish. \n\nThe miyagi oysters are $1 between 5-7 for happy hour  served with lemon and a soy sauce like sauce. Definitely indulge during he happy hours. Surprisingly they are super clean, didn't taste muddy at all. I'm really happy with what they gave me. I will say that the soy sauce does not mix well with the lemon and hot sauce. I would choose one when mixing. \n\nNigiri tasting has 7 fish that the chefs get to choose  I got: hamachi, salmon, golden eye snapper, ocean trout, striped mackerel, yellowtail belly, escolar. Not bad! I can't say that the salmon was super buttery, but you can tell you are getting fresh clean fish. It cost $25 for 7 pieces. Not bad to try if you do not know what fish is good here. \n\nDaily special: live scallop special. Comes with 2 sashimi, 2 nigiri, and 2 tempura pieces. Presentation is on point. It was okay though taste wise, I've had better scallops at other places.\n\nAnkimo nigiri - I had it at Omakase and that's very hard to beat. The ankimo was a little cold and I prefer it warm. Would I pay $8, probably not.\n\nLoco Spider-Man roll was the only roll I got. I see that ppl also get the blazing glory. I would say loco Spider-Man is their take on spider roll. It's different because there is no eel. Rate is a 7/10.  Probably wouldn't get this again. Nothing was special about it. \n\nI give it a 5 for great experience, great food, great pricing, and  happy hour menu. The food is fresh and   I left a happy women. Great for groups. Clean. You must try hamachi truffle and oysters (during hh of course ). Would definitely come back. They definitely catered to me and made me feel special..", "author": "Jackie N."}

I always thought the West Coast had it better for sushi but I am no longer sure that's the case.\n\nThe fish was neither fresh nor well-cut.  Everything was difficult to chew and bite through, and visibly poorly cut.  The only thing I enjoyed was the tuna, and that was despite the odd cut (extremely thick).  It's not even like it's priced well.  $25 for chirashi which comes with about 7 slices of the standard fish (2 salmon, 1 tuna, 2 red snapper, 2 walu that I didn't even eat, a tsp of ikura) over maybe 1/2 a cup of (unseasoned) rice and a bowl of miso.

My boyfriend and I came here for Valentine's day and we ordered salmon sushi, The Special K Roll, Loco Spider-Man Roll, oysters(for my boyfriend) and sake. The food was not great at all. The salmon sushi had the weirdest taste to it; I told my boyfriend to try it and he spit it out. The rolls were just so/so and it was expensive? My boyfriend said the oysters were great and they did beautiful plating with flowers and ice but that and the service was probably the only redeeming quality. Our waiter was super nice and attentive so for that and the oysters they get an extra star. I won't be back.", "author": "Hannah G."}

When I first walked in, I was happily greeted by the hostess with a friendly Japanese \"moshi moshi,\" which made me feel right at home! \n\nI was also pleasantly surprised to learn that there was a happy hour going on while we were there from 5-7pm, which we made sure to take part in. I first ordered a Junmai Ginjo sake called Hakushika, which was affordable and absolutely delicious! So crisp and refreshing. My partner got an Asahi, which was a dollar off ($5 total) during the happy hour. \n\nNext, we tried some of the food on the happy hour menu. I got a few oysters for $1.50 each, which I thoroughly enjoyed, and a kimchi guacamole shrimp taco for $2, which was divine, and a spicy tuna handroll for $5, which also didn't disappoint!\n\nSo all in all, would I come back here and try out more dishes? Ab-so-lutely. I approve! :)", "author": "Brad P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-21", "description": "As much as I love traditional sushi, modern fusion places like Nara can also be a good time. It's especially nice because it offers some \"higher end\" options while also having some good filler menu choices that won't break the bank. The fish quality here doesn't quite match up to the modern accessible-but-high-end vibe this place gives off but the rolls are creative, the service is excellent, and I just can't be too mad about $1 miyagi oysters.\n\nFor food my friend and I got oysters and a roll I can't remember the name of (it had escolar, pickled jalapenos, and a ponzu truffle sauce.) I got the nigiri combo and my friend got the It's Like Butter Baby w/ white rice versus the bacon fried rice.\n\nOyster quality is honestly pretty good for just a buck. Miyagi oysters are about as standard as an oyster can taste and my wallet is ok with that. The nigiri combo was a bit disappointing in terms of quality but for $25, it was almost a cheap basic omakase since it included less run-of-the-mill fish. I got: horse mackerel, Hawaiian amberjack, regular amberjack, salmon, yellowfin tuna, and ocean trout. The quality wasn't the best but for the price I didn't expect much. The taste wasn't clean and the texture was closer to mush. Not sure if I'd get it again.\n\nThe roll on the other hand was delicious. Escolar goes great with pickled items and I would definitely eat this again (if I could remember the name). My friend's Like Butter Baby dish was also good for the most part. The veggies really were drowned in butter laced with something else that's super addictive. The fish was cooked well but not all that fatty and honestly underseasoned. However, I know it's meant to be eaten with bacon fried rice. The white rice just makes the dish a bit too plain.\n\nOverall, I really do love this place. While the traditional stuff may not be great, their more modern items are definitely delicious!", "author": "Vivian C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-04", "description": "Nara is better than ever.  It's easily the best restaurant in the Lower Haight, and one of the premiere sushi spots in the city.  \n\nAs I said in my previous review the food is fantastic, as good as the big dollar spots.  Super high-quality fish, distinctive rolls, and an array of creative and delicious appetizers.  The raw oysters are as fresh and clean as those I've had at Foreign Cinema.\n\nA special shout out to the Hamachi Kama.  Unlike most places that buy the kama separately, Nara uses enough fish to produce kamas of their own.  I'm told they often have only one or two a night, and that people call ahead to try to reserve one, it's that damn good. For me it's an A+, a perfectly prepared piece of grilled fish.\n\nNara also wins because it's a fun place to eat.  Great music, inviting space, cool vibe.  The host George is real personality, and his staff of sweetheart servers always make us feel like VIPs.  The Lower Haight can sometimes be dreary and grungy, but Nara is consistently high class.\n\nWhile I'm at it, their take out is immaculate, as fancy in plastic as it is on the plate.", "author": "Cody V."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-29", "description": "I would describe Nara as a modern Japanese/sushi restaurant for social gatherings. NOTE: they don't serve liquor - only beer, wine and sake. We were able to make a reservation for a group of 5 on a Friday night. The restaurant was fairly empty upon arrival, but started to fill up as the night went on. We started out with the oysters which came with soy sauce as opposed to horse radish. Very refreshing! I then had the \"It's like butter baby\" grilled cod. Presentation was great and the cod was cooked perfectly. Given that it's on the \"heavier side,\" I'd say that it's more like a small plate rather than an appetizer.  Also had the Big boss roll - yellowtail, tuna, salmon, salmon roe, avocado, cucumber and radish sprouts. Great execution with less, but thick pieces. \n\nI was a little disappointed that the sushi options were limited to tastings, specialty rolls, and a la cart nigiri/sashimi. IMO sushi restaurants should offer maki/traditional rolls. They also serve their sushi in unique plates. The chirashi came in a rectangular plate with the rice and fish separated. It was basically a sashimi platter with rice on the side. Makes sense as to why it was priced the same as the sashimi and nigiri tastings. Service was good. They were kind enough to let us stick around and chat after dinner.", "author": "Helen C."}

The hotate was so delicious, as was the salmon and nigiri platter. I got a roll but I think it masked the flavor of the fish.\n\nIf you're into grilled fish and giant sushi rolls drenched in sauce, this place may not be worth the price tag for you.

By its name \"Sake Bar\" it should be expected that this is not any traditional izakaya joint - and once you step inside you would totally feel it. Very loud, very hip, vibrant atmosphere; in fact I think the music could have been turned down a bit because I could barely listen to my friend's chatting during the dinner. But anyway, I was very impressed by the food.\n\nMarinated Fried Eggplant: B+.\nNot bad. The eggplant was marinated very well, it has a deep flavor within it. It was only slightly fried which added a sense of crispiness outside of the eggplant.\n\nHamachi Truffle: A-.\nVery nicely presented. Strong truffle taste. Even though this is kind of a carpaccio dish but I could still taste the hamachi freshness. \n\nNigiri Tasting: A.\nThis was a total surprise. I wouldn't have expected such fresh fish in a sake bar restaurant! There were 7pcs, and although the waitress did present what each of those fish was it was too loud that I could hardly hear. All I know is that it was really fresh. This made me believe that the place was actually created with a traditional + hipster fusion Japanese restaurant theme. Order this. You won't be disappointed.\n\nHeart Attack Roll: A-.\nThe main fish was spicy tuna, with some cucumber and topped with toro and some type of chips. Both kinds of fish tasted very nice, the chips were interesting, overall a very good choice in my opinion.\n\nSo yea, good food, great service. Ordered 4 glasses of beer for my friend and myself, turned out to be ~$57+tips per person. Considered the great quality of food I think this was not a bad price at all.

In my experience, every uni has its own flavor profile.  The uni here has a non-stop creamy flavor and mouthfeel.  It lingers in the best way possible. \n\n- The Otoro was very good.

ALL FOR TWO PEOPLE, it was a ridiculous amount of food, but we obvs ate it all... i would definitely skip the pork belly (texture like karaage, not like cooked for hours yummy pork belly at all) and maki roll next time - not impressed at all.  the fish was pretty good..a few pieces were even melt in your mouth (escolar! yum!). bill came out to be $144 with tax for the two of us - a steal for sf.  plus now we know what to skip next time!", "author": "Christina L."}

We ordered the maguro tar tar appetizer, Big Boss, Sake Bomb, Heart Attack and Garden Nara.\n\nThe appetizer was by far the best. 6 pieces, solid 5 stars. The display was simple and beautiful, and the fatty tuna went really well with the asian pear, radish, and avocado.\n\nThe Heart attack was also really good. I think this one was the one that had fried lotus roots on top. Twas delicious. Big Boss and Sake bomb was pretty good, too - but didn't stand out as much. \n\nI would not recommend the Garden Nara. It was not what I expectedly. Probably pretty healthy since it has no rice around it, but tasted like a mini veggie wrap and the taste/ texture did not go well with anything else. \n\nWe were still a bit hungry after 5 rolls because we are fatsos, so we ordered the seafood pancake which was pretty good. Not amazing though and the portion was kinda small.\n\nOverall, my experience was great and I would totally go here again. One thing that was a bit odd was the music. Just a tad strange to be chewing on some raw fish with Beyonce's 7/11 on - but no complaints. Great pop dance music sushi shop. I'd recommend turning it into a dance club after 10p.", "author": "Juliana P."}

We ordered some a la carte nigiri (sake, hon maguro, unagi, amaebi, hotate, uni, and ika) and two rolls, Haight Me and Sake Bomb.\n\nLet me just tell you, I've NEVER had sushi this SALTY in my life. I don't understand how the seasoning can be this off. I think it could be that they marinate their fish such as sake and ika in salt, but the over-saltiness wasn't just in the fish. The main problem was the seasoning in their rice. It almost tasted like someone accidentally poured a bucket of salt in the rice or something.\n\nThe second problem was that all the ingredients were NOT FRESH. Their uni was probably the worst uni I've put in my mouth, it had such weird flavor and bitter taste. It takes a lot for an uni fanatic like me to leave a piece of uni nigiri on the table. It was that bad! Not to mention all of their other fish were meh. They really didn't taste fresh at all.\n\nThe third problem was that the flavors were quite off in the rolls. It could be the over-seasoning of the rice, stale ingredients, their sauces, or the combination of everything, but I just couldn't eat all of them even though I was at the restaurant with a huge craving of sushi and appetite.\n\nI really wanted to like this place, the Korean staff are nice and the atmosphere is quite nice, too. I think the quality of food is the most important factor in a restaurant, though, and for that reason, this restaurant gets the lowest possible rating I could give and I will never be back here.", "author": "Annie L."}

So we opted for the $16 hand roll sampler (toro, bin toro, and sake). Good, but nothing impressive. Just wanted good food in our bellies before we pregammed ;) \n\nAlso got the Escolar Salsa (seared butter fish, pico de gallo salsa, lotus chip) - 4 stars.  Had great taste but needed a bigger kick to be 5 stars. \n\nHot sake was $6 for about 6-7 shots. \n\nAtmosphere - fun, hipster, played r&b oldies that you can sing along to.

Just make sure to get the right dishes. I would come back with a big group of friends and get all the plates and drinks that sound good. A sampling below. \n\nRanked in order of deliciousness:\n1) Hamachi truffle: seared yellowtail with jalape\u00f1o cilantro and crunch in truffle oil ponzu. It comes in 5 delectable spoons with all the seasonings. You can taste the truffle without it being overpowering. Would get again. \n\n2) (Special on wall) Ray-Ray's Tako - sous vide Spanish octopus with red wine and apple reduction. Cooked just right for chewy texture and a nice sweet-savory glaze. \n\n3) Rice poppers: 4 deep fried sushi rice topped with spicy tuna and white tuna and ranch dressing. It's like a bite-sized Japanese rice ball. Yum. \n\n4) Garlic butter edamame: you just can't go wrong with garlic and butter. Get it. \n\n4) Big boss: yellowtail, tuna, salmon, ikura, avocado, cucumber, radish sprouts. I like it that it's just fish and rice, no fancy toppings needed. The ikura makes this roll.\n\nBelow this - would not get again: \n\n5) Spicy tonkotsu ramen: it's not entirely fair to compare this to ramen-only shops, but this was a real miss. The spiciness overpowered the broth so you couldn't taste the pork flavor. Noodles were stuck together, e.g. what happens when you cook pasta and leave it out to dry w/ no oil. The yolk in the egg seemed al dente but somewhere along the way it fell out of the egg white and was never found again...so can't really comment on that one. \n\n6) Spicy handroll tasting: you get one of each spicy tuna, hamachi and sake. Nothing special. \n\nIf I'm in the area again I'll come back to try  the other dishes.\n\nAtmosphere: it's a fun izakaya / gastropub vibe and it's open late (til 1130p), which is awesome and so rare in SF! \n\nService: super super fast - we were here at 1030p on a Saturday night and the place was about 1/3 full.", "author": "Inga C."}

Came in on a rainy day and as soon as we walk in the staff greets us in unison. Now I didn't understand what they said... But I'm sure it was some form of saying \"Welcome\" but of course in Japanese. We get seated, the ambience is nice. I thought the interior was nice even from the outside. Inside its dark, wooden tables which create a rustic vibe, but the rest of the restaurant looks modern, Very neat and spaced out. Another thing I noticed was the music that was playing. For me, it really set the scene for a great dinner. The playlist was creative and entertaining. Now I'm a fan of hip hop, rnb, edm... And it was a mixture of all, and appropriate of course. It's something different and the choice of music was great because it doesn't always work when you have an employee picking the playlist. \n\nAnyways as for the food, we had a couple rolls and appetizers. The wait wasn't long at all and the waitress was helpful. The rolls we tried were...\n\n*Heart Attack - a lot of finesse on this dish. The tuna looked fresh, no doubting the quality. The garnish was impressive, and the roll was delicious. \n\n*Loco Spider Roll - Huge, I'm always a fan of multiple fish assortments in a roll. Soft shell crab was crispy, almost like getting a appetizer on top of the roll. \n\n*Treasure Roll - Deep fried and cream cheese is always a killer combo. They used real crab meat on which I appreciate instead of imitation. And the fresh tuna packed inside for the perfect size roll. \n\nFood now isn't just all about taste, it's also about presentation. People say you eat with your eyes, and eating here, I wasn't sure if it was my eyes or my stomach that was more satisfied. I feel like the chefs here understand how complex the elements of food. It's an Art, it's takes finesse, but it's also a science and understanding what works well together. It's very hard to paint a picture on a plate and even harder to make it taste good at the same time. It's very easy to mess that up. Complements to the chefs here because they got it done. I was also able to speak to the one  managers and he was very genuine and he appreciated our feedback. As for the whole dinning experience as a whole, it was a perfect night. I still can't get over the music selection. The food was phenomenal, service exceptional, and the prices are fair.

The raw salmon was pretty fresh but not the best I've had. The tempura was great - highly recommend as an appetizer to share. The desserts were 3 stars, nothing very complex to make and not a must have.

And they aren't drowned in spicy mayo or eel sauces - they get their unique flavors from pairing fish that perfectly complement each other together, wrapping them in perfectly made rice and high quality seaweed, and adding shiso leaves, seaweed salad, daikon sprouts, roe, even UNI to the top! \n\nNot to mention, they have $1 Miyagi oysters during happy hour, plus beer and sake specials, They have a great sake menu, including a sparkling option - so good! The service is always friendly, and the chefs are excited to welcome their customers. I think word of mouth has been spreading because as the months have gone on since this place opened a few months ago, it has gotten progressively more and more crowded.", "author": "Jessica C."}

Some of the more memorable dishes we had were Ray Ray's Tako and grilled Pork Belly dish.  Ray Ray's Tako had an amazing sauce that complimented the tako very well.  The grilled pork belly was rich, not overcooked, and came with 3 huge pieces. :D I've  also tried the 7 pc nigiri sampler and the hotate sliders.  The nigiri sampler was good, quality of the fish was good, but not the best I've had.  I would still order the nigiri sampler again. The hotate sliders were really good as well!

This place is not your average sushi place and I feel like you have to be somewhat of a sushi expert to be able to find something that you like here. I am not sushi connoisseur so I did not get much out of this experience as others might have. I am a lover of the California roll, basic, plain and simple and there was nothing even remotely close to this on the menu. There was a flaming sushi roll on the menu that we got and it literally comes to your table, on a plate that is then lit by your server and it flames for a few minutes.

While visibly jealous, the crowd was quickly placated by (presumably) complimentary glasses of sake while they waited. Only bummer was, our table was near the drafty open door. \n\nOur main server told us \"all the servers are your server- just flag someone down if you need anything\" and that was absolutely true, though occasionally confusing. \n\nWe ordered several appetizers and a cold and hot sake to start-- the karaage was the best price:portion ratio ($6 for 15 small pieces) but we were also happy with the agedashi tofu, tuna tar tar, and hotate sliders. Then we ordered 5 rolls: effectively the first five on the menu, minus the veggie roll. \n\nI don't remember which roll was which, but I found all of them tasty. At one point we received a third roll that looked a lot like the first, and by the fourth realized we accidentally got a couple of the next table's rolls... Whoops! This happened 3 times, but it took us eating 2 extra rolls to figure it out. I think if the servers dropping off food were more consistent about announcing what was being delivered, we might've caught it sooner (not that we minded-- we got a lot of free extra food out if it). \n\nTotal came to $35pp with tip for a generous amount of food and sake. The price for a group dinner was very reasonable compared to the beautiful plating, though the flavors and quality of the fish didn't knock my socks off (but to be fair, we didn't try the nigiri). \n\nAll in all, a great new spot.

Yet, their sashimi doesn't quite make the cut. We ordered the following sashimi: salmon, hamachi, saba, horse mackerel, amaebi, and ocean trout. Of all of these, the horse mackerel was pretty good, and the rest tasted like I could have gotten it at any cheap sushi place. \n\nWe also ordered the hamachi kama, which was only ok. Some parts were really juicy, and other parts were charred so bad that I had to spit it out. \n\nThe scallop sampler was nice, at $18, it was basically scallops prepared three ways--which makes the price point definitely worth it, and it was probably the best thing we got.  \n\nOur server was really friendly, she checked back on us just enough to make us not feel forgotten, but not enough that I couldn't have a conversation with my date.

I don't handle spice very well, but maybe I'll muster up the courage to try the spicy dishes one day cuz they look/sound delicious.\n\nWhat gives Nara 5 stars instead of a 4 is the amazing service. Makes me so happy when a new restaurant opens and they have their shit together from day 1 instead of trying to wing it and work out all the kinks as they go. Will definitely return to try out the impeccable sake selection that I keep reading about.", "author": "Mikaela S."}

I am not one of those who gets a bento box when going to a Japanese place although I have nothing against bento boxes. I grew up in Aisa where Japanese food is everywhere, easily better than places in the U.S, and are a lot more affordable so it takes a lot for me to give five stars. \n\nLet's talk about customer service. Every single staff at Nara including the servers and chefs were friendly and welcoming. Also they were very knowledgable about their specials and the menu. I mean what more can I ask?\n\nExcellent food. The quality of the fish Nara serves is not something you find in any Japanese restaurants. They are super fresh and delicious. I really enjoyed their uni, striped horse mackerel, premium Japanese snapper, golden eye snapper, and Hawaiian amberjack. Also these are not typical fish you find anywhere. I highly recommend Nara if you want to try something unique and different. Also I'm not a huge fan of rolls because rolls tend to overshadow the taste of the fish with sauce and other ingredients. However Nara's rolls are amazing and super tasty and don't overshadow the fish. Some of my favorites are Big boss, heartattack, and special K. \n\nDaily specials. Every day from 5-7 they have a happy hour deal where draft beer and hot Sake are $1 off and they have one dollar oysters. If you are an oyster lover like myself, you def should check this place out. \n\nOverall I have amazing time every time i visit Nara.    I highly recommend this place to any sushi lovers like myself", "author": "Sunjoo K."}

I ordered staff which should be around $60 but I ended up with $100 bill. Here is why:  \n\n1) Handroll Processing Fee, beside the Handroll sampler, which is fixed price of $13, all other handroll will be charged $1/handroll extra for \"special order processing service\". This fee is not listed anywhere on the manual, so, be aware of that. \n\n2) Billing discrepancy, the manual states one price and your bill will state another. Watch out for that.\n\n3) Communication issue, I ordered toro and bintoro handroll and I got o-toro and something else per the bill. The o-toro tasted just like toro, so it never occurred to me that what I got was not what I ordered. And I ended up with 3x of the cost. \n\n4) I kept getting the plates that was not ordered by me. And I had to reminded the wait staff what I had order since they easily forgot. \n\nI would give 4 starts for the quality of the ingredients; 3 stars for sushi; 2 stars for the bathroom (very messy); and 1 star for the service (The wait staff were friendly with beautiful smile. These are good people, but not good service provider).\n\nI have to conclude that Nara and I are not meant to be for each other. Once is enough.", "author": "Lydia L."}

The food is excellent and the owner/staff kick so much ass, Nara is always a fun place to be. It's a great place for a meal or a few rounds with good food for accompaniment, and the happy hour is great. \n\nMore detailed review:\n\nFirst things first, the food is excellent. Whether you're in the mood for sushi or something heavier / cooked, Nara's got you covered. The fish is very fresh so it's great as sashimi/nigiri or in their rolls, some of which are incredible. They always have daily specials listed on the board behind the sushi bar that oftentimes sell out.\n\nLast time I was here I had the seven-course omakase, which was an insane amount of food. There were lots of rolls, the kind that come with sauces or are deep fried or have fusion-y ingredients like cream cheese. They were delicious, but I was hoping for some really good simple fresh fish. Just when I thought that wasn't coming, a plate of I think seven types of sashimi was served, followed by seven types of nigiri. There was also salad, a course of cooked fish, miso soup with veggies and seafood, and creme brulee for dessert. I may have missed something else, but my point is it was all top-notch and a lot of food.\n\nFrom the regular menu some favorites include hamachi truffle, garlic butter edamame, chicken karaage (I prefer spicy), \"it's like butter\" (incredible fish dish), hamachi kama, big boss roll, and the ramen. Aside from the soups everything is easy to share, which makes coming here with friends even more fun.\n\nThe atmosphere is awesome here, from the tasteful decor to the friendly and welcoming staff. I've gotten to know some of them, including chefs Kevin and Danny, both a lot of fun and great at what they do. George, one of the servers, is always attentive and friendly. And the owner Sonny, who you'll sometimes see wandering table to table, is an awesome guy who is doing things right with this restaurant.\n\nThere's an izakaya / gastropub vibe here, so even though the food is legit it's also a great place to grab drinks (though no liquor, so don't expect that). They have a few beers on tap and some imported bottles as well as an extensive sake menu. It can be a bit loud but never rowdy, which for me is perfect. They have good playlists to keep the atmosphere upbeat.\n\nIf you live nearby or are looking for a new sushi spot, definitely check this place out!", "author": "Joseph N."}

It's either Ozumo-class ($150/person), or Tokyo \"trip to the toilet\" Express. \n\nNara gives you a higher end experience, with a  more modest price tag.  My party of three ordered enough food for a party of 5, and got out of there for $150 with tip.  That's what's up.  \n \nAmbiance is wonderful inside, and the waitstaff is prompt, and friendly.  \n \nThe only potential downside is that it's in the lower haight, which can be a bit grungy, if you are sensitive to that.

Most places give you the usual stuff in a nigiri sampler: salmon, tuna, yellowtail, shrimp, etc. The nigiri sampler they prepared for me had none of these things. Each piece was carefully crafted and individually seasoned, as it should be. At $28 for the 7-piece sampler, it was also a decent value considering the fish they give you.\n\nI also tried the ginger creme brulee at their suggestion. The presentation was beautiful and the ginger wasn't overpowering - a perfect ending to a really great dinner!\n\nI found the prices to be pretty good - definitely not the most expensive sushi I've ever had, but not the most inexpensive place ever either.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-30", "description": "After just moving to the city recently, I've been on a constant prowl for the best sushi at an affordable price here. Wow did Nara set the bar high, absolutely loved my food and experience here.\n\nI came in for a late dinner after doing some extra reading at a coffee shop nearby after work. Immediately I was taken aback because all the workers there shouted something at me in unison. At first I thought it was closed and they were telling me to leave because I couldn't understand any of it, but I later found out it's their way of welcoming all their customers. I loved the tradition. Pretty dark in the seating foray, very well lit at the bar (which is where I sat). The music playlist was on point, it's like they know exactly what you want to listen to when you're eating sushi. They also had a TV, although it's a tad of an awkward angle to see from the bar.\n\nI ordered what was called the Sake Bomb roll and an order of their Spicy Edamame to have with my roll, not as an appetizer. Right after ordering a waitress brought me a glass and bottle of water. She left the bottle of water to refill it at my own pleasure with me. I drink a lot of water when I go out to restaurants so I was already enjoying my service at this point. My roll was riveting, tasted like that feeling of getting exactly what you want after working more than you needed to in a day. I ate the potato chips on top of it before actually eating the roll so that the salt from the chips wouldn't mask the flavor of the sushi. I was happy about that decision because the roll was flavorful to say the least. The dash of jalapeno in it went really well with the eel sauce drizzled on the plate. If you like a bit of spicy in your sushi, definitely get the Sake Bomb. The Spicy Edamame was a nice addition too: generously portioned, well cooked, buttery, and enough kick in them that you want to grab another after each bite. I should also note that all the chef's at the bar were super personable, willing to strike a conversation at any time, one was even singing along to the music playing my entire time there. Huge appreciation for Kevin who gave me free persimmons after my meal, really nice guy. \n\nThe same way they greet you in unison, they thank you in unison as you're leaving too. I'm happy to live only a few blocks away, will definitely be coming back whenever I work more than I need to again.", "author": "Shayan S."}

The unagi spring roll was great, really fresh and light flavors, as was the roll with cream cheese and salmon. The scallop sliders were great too. The pop rocks California roll was terrible - I like the initiative, but the ultra sweet candy didn't mix with sushi flavors. \n\nThe host brought us free sake, the wait staff was friendly and overall the service was top notch. Presentation of the food was awesome, but they have a few kinks to iron out in the menu before it's a 5 star for me.\n\nOverall, a great night, some new dishes that broke out from the norm, beautiful presentation and great service.

Try it out, I dare you. Blows the rest of the neighborhood's sushi places out of the water.

Was visiting San Francisco and I wanted sushi so I looked on Yelp and found this place close to where we were staying. I tried calling for over an hour to make a reservation, but the line was constantly busy, I'm guessing off the hook, so we just hoped for the best and showed up. We came in around 9pm on a Saturday night and there were plenty of people in the restaurant but we didn't have to wait for a table. Our server was a lot of fun, when we first sat down I wanna say he was doing Sake bombs with the table next to us lol. They have beer and wine (no liquor) which is great although they didn't have a single light beer on the menu, I would suggest adding Kirin Light or even something like Bud Light to the drink menu. Anyway the server was very helpful with deciding what to order, although he sort of guided us to order less than we probably would have because he said it was a lot of food, which it wasn't really, but it ended up being just about enough since we were going out drinking anyway and I was glad to not feel super full all night. First off the Hamachi Truffle appetizer was OUT OF THIS WORLD!! So freaking delicious. Then we had 2 specialty sushi rolls that were good, nothing spectacular that particularly stood out as a must try, but they were certainly yummy. We also had the spicy hand roll sampler and that was good. I really liked the vibe of this place and I would definitely check it out again if I was in the area.", "author": "Amber M."}

Some dishes are too small for even the best of friends to share--maybe two bites.  \n\nThis is a beef of mine about SF in general: there are all these restaurants that mimic the portion size and presentation of fine dining but aren't preparing food at that level-they're serving the same ingredients with the same preparation as everyone else, you just get less of it.  I'm not fooled!  I would much rather have the unpretentious presentation style and portion size of my local izakaya if you're just going to serve me the exact same quality of food. \n\nWe had very little sushi since we came there in an \"izakaya mood\" but the food we had was mostly good.  Service isn't very good.  Our waitress was friendly and reasonably attentive but they just seemed a little overworked. \n\nAnyway, the small menu still had some great picks and there was enough there to keep us happy:\n\nBacon wrapped skewers - seemed like a winner, particularly the cherry tomato ones.\nAgedashi tofu - hard to mess this up; it was decent\nHouse salad - passable\nCalamari - totally bland, tiny portion; top 3 worst calamari dishes i've ever had.\nTako balls - Perfection\nJessica Alba roll - very good; recommended\nLoco Spiderman Roll - a little heavy on the creamy sauce but still very good\nSpicy tuna hand roll - ate this to kill time while waiting for other stuff; decent\nBlack cod - impossibly small portion but served with a tasty mushroom medley\nJalapeno poppers - Very good\nChicken karage - I didnt eat this but others seems to enjoy it\nSake kama - only ordered this because they were out of the hamachi kama; enjoyed it\n\nAbove complaints aside, everything was reasonable and I would eat here again.", "author": "Jay S."}

The hostess takes my number, I receive a text saying I'm on their waiting list, and once my table is ready I'd receive another text. Sounds good, I step outside. \n\nFast forward thirty five minutes. I step inside to ask about my table and am told that everyone on the list had already sat down. I have a puzzled look on my face, as I never received a follow up text about my table being ready. They point at a table and tell us to sit down.. Sure. After ten to fifteen minutes of being ignored at the table, I walk up to a waitress and ask for menus. Another ten minutes go by and our waitress finally comes by, so we order two rolls, nigiri, water, and sake. We probably should have taken off for a new restaurant, but at this point it was passed 10 and our food options were limited.\n\nBy the time our order had been placed, an hour had gone by. We get our food (which actually came out fairly quickly) and dove in. Not the best sushi I've ever had, but not the worst. As I'm eating the sushi, I'm thinking to myself 'there's no way in hell this restaurant deserves the 4.5 stars on Yelp.' So, here I am.\n\nNara was average sushi and nigiri with some of the worst service I've experienced in a restaurant setting. I don't think I'd ever go back.

It's actually quite funny and welcoming.  But you do immediately notice the noise level of the place is quite high.\n\nThe music is an issue by itself.  For one, it's blasted continuously.  Very difficult to have a conversation imo.  Plus, the music choices at times make it seem like you are sitting in a bad karaoke bar. Not to mention, when it's time to celebrate someone's birthday, regular music will stop, and music taken from what seems to be from a japanese game show/variety show/ Kpop is taken up a few decibels and floods the entire place for a good 1-2 minutes, until the staff is done wishing the patron a happy birthday. It's quite jarring.\n\nThe staff is quite nice, welcoming, and attentive for the most part. Definitely a plus.\n\nThey have a nice selection of sake. Their drink menu is nicely done and even has an informative page at the end, describing each type of sake and the tastes you should expect to help make your choice. I'm not one to usually order sake, since I never know what to get, but I found myself ordering a small bottle due to the information they give you.  Nice touch.\n\nThe sushi itself is not very good imo.  I ordered both their nigiri and their sashimi tastings while my girlfriend ordered two of their rolls. The selection of novelty rolls themselves is very small compared to a typical sushi restaurant/bar.  That is perfectly fine, but the sushi you offer should be really good, unfortunately I don't believe it is. The two rolls we ordered were the 'Big Boss' and the Jessica Alba.  Yay for alba, nay for big boss. Shame, I love me some Metal Gear Solid.\n\nThe nigiri wasn't bad, just not great.  None of them seemed to be exceptionally fresh.   The sashimi also suffers from this and the portion size also seemed off.  The cuts were rather large and thick, which may seem like a good thing, but having a larger piece of fish with lower quality taste isn't really that appetizing. I also felt that some of the pieces of both sashimi/nigiri were over seasoned as well.\n\nIt's a decent place.  If you live in a different neighborhood, I don't think its worth the effort to come out, better going off to Ricky Bobby a few blocks down.  As a neighborhood sushi place, that you can easily stroll on in, sure why not.", "author": "Christopher M."}

The sushi I had was delicious, some of the best I've had. The seaweed salad was amazing. The servers were lovely, and the space was well decorated. Overall a great experience. My only complaint is that it was pretty noisy, but sometimes you can't help that.", "author": "Eleanor H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-27", "description": "Let me first just preface this by saying that this is the first time I have ever been compelled to write a review.  I have been to Nara twice in the last two weeks and both times I have left saying that I must write a review asap.  If you can't be bothered to read a longer break down you can stop here...Nara is great; go try for yourself.\n\nJust to quickly highlight - the menu is reasonably priced, the interior is well designed and the playlist on both occasions has been great (Shaggy - Mr. Bombastic comes to mind).  Now for the more standout points that take Nara from good to great.  Both sushi dishes I have tried at Nara have been delicious and well crafted (I had the Desperado and the California Pop Rock one) - they were without a doubt the freshest sushi I have ever tasted.  As for some other items, they have been equally as delicious - the pork ramen is great with a touch of kick (and also without as my girlfriend requested); the calamari, again, extremely fresh and the seafood pancake is great.  I absolutely loved the atmosphere in Nara.  The interior and the playlist are a part of that but as is the service and the welcoming cheer/shouts thrown up by the whole staff whenever a patron walks in that always provokes a smile from me.  Finally the service is absolutely fantastic and makes you feel extremely valued as a customer.  I will admit, being from England where service is generally miserable, I am a sucker for delightful service, however my appreciation in this area is totally warranted.  The servers are extremely friendly and attentive and happy to talk through the menu with you.  On my first visit one of our dishes was delivered to another table meaning we had to wait and extra 7-8 minutes or so (not the biggest problem for me), however I was brought a beer on the house and that item was scratched from the menu too.  I mustn't forget to mention the manager who - even remembered me from my first visit - welcomes every patron with a wonderful smile and there to say goodbye on your way out too.\n\nSo my very first post has been a long one but I hope that tells you how much I have enjoyed my trips to Nara.  My only hope is that as they grow more popular they can keep the great service and quality of dishes!", "author": "Andoni G."}

The sushi is really fresh and reasonably priced. They also have other unique appetizers to enjoy and add a variety to your meal.  The servers are all very friendly and happy, although they seem to share tables which leads to some confusion at times, and the space could use some acoustic dampeners on the ceiling. But these do not affect my five star review.  The place is great!  It's been open for just a short time and my wife and I have been there 4 times and I ordered take out once.", "author": "Adam B."}
