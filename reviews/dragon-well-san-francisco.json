As our main course we shared Mushu Pork, Honey Walnut Prawns and Mongolian Beef.  everything was absolutely delicious.  We enjoyed our meal so much we took what we didn't eat back to our hotel to eat for breakfast (cold chinese for breakfast is the best!).\n\nSo, if you are ever in San Francisco and want chinese food,  this place is a must!

Isn't that what we all want!\n\nYes it's probably more Americanized Chinese. But Gary and Christina, owners extraordinaire... are full-blooded Chinese! They provide a beautiful, intimate restaurant.... I would call of contemporary design on Chestnut Street in the Marina District of San Francisco... one of my most favorite areas. It is truly an area where the locals live, eat, shop, work out, and get their hair and nails done:-). My point is, in order to stay in business, you better provide a great product in this neighborhood. It is not a tourist-only locale.\n\nThe food is fresh fresh fresh! I say this with confidence because I have eaten here so many times. Always different food items and each one never disappointing. I have my favorites for sure but I try and order one new thing each time. The wine list is incredible. There are not too many Chinese restaurants where you can dine AND  have an incredible California wine from which to choose. Or a really good beer to pair with the spicy food. They offer a Navarro Gewurtztraminer wine which pairs the best with Chinese food. My favorite, however, is their Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc. I'm sorry I make no apologies for wanting really good wine with my outstanding Chinese food :). And I love they take reservations. I also want to note the takeout business they do. My goodness... you would think they were giving the food away. Again these are the locals who live in the neighborhood wanting quality food at home. And I see these people in the restaurant with their families and I love it. My last visit I noted two solo diners ,  obviously locals ,  enjoying their food. Their wait staff have all been there for a long time and that is certainly a good sign. The young woman that waited on us this last visit is just so nice and so accommodating and always wants to make your visit an outstanding one.\n\nThe price point for this quality food is incredible. I don't know how they offer the quality ingredients and generous portions at these prices.\n\nThis last visit was as outstanding as ever. I always enjoy seeing Christina at the front taking care of business now that her children are grown.\n\nThank you Christina and Gary for providing such a quality restaurant.\nP.s. did I spell Gewurztraminer right LOL", "author": "Lizz Z."}

They must be finding it difficult to employ good cooks because it has become so unreliable.  Prices keep going way up and portions keep shrinking. Ordered the pork pot stickers (4 for $12.00), I thought they made a mistake and used some kind of tasteless chicken, the texture was completely off and it was mushy.  Never had a pot sticker like that and hope to not have another one.  Another time I ordered the Hong Kong Noodles ($15.00), was a soupy concoction that again was without acceptable flavor.

This was enough for two people's dinner, plus leftovers.\n\nDragon Well Green Tea : Mild and enjoyable.  The menu said it was wok-roasted.  I did not pick up on the roasted flavor, but my boyfriend did.\n\nBeef Chow Fun : Satisfying.\n\nSavory, Sweet, Stir-fried Beef : We both liked the texture of the broccoli, which was cooked, but still a bit crisp.  My boyfriend really enjoyed this dish, though I was not quite in the mood for sweetness.\n\nTea-Smoked Duck : Overall good.  Had a definite smoked aroma, and tasted of tea. It was interesting, but in general, we like the taste of duck on its own, so probably prefer more traditional preparations of peking duck.  The buns, though, were perfectly done - warm, fluffy, and mild in taste.", "author": "Elizabeth C."}

We made reservations beforehand since the place is small. There was a one minute delay getting our table together and the manger gave us an order of chicken lettuce wraps on the house for our trouble. \n\nThe server was very good. He made menu and wine recommendations and didn't come off as pushy or like he was trying to get us to buy the most expensive things on the menu. \n\nMy wife is gluten free, and even though the restaurant had a separate GF menu, the server still pointed out good choices for her.\n\nWe ended up getting six dishes, plus two orders of pot stickers. The potstickers were very large and tasty. The Kung Pao Chicken (GF) was great, as were the Mongolian Beef (GF) and Beef Chow Fun (GF). The Chow Fun, in particular, was nice... Light and with a smoky flavor.\n\nFor non-GF dishes, we got Mu Shu Pork, Walnut Prawns and Savory and Sweet Beef. The mu shu was the weakest, but still good. Walnut prawns had a light batter coating on them, but they still had the tails on underneath. Everyone liked the beef.\n\nSome people have complained about the prices of the meals, but I found them pretty reasonable for downtown San Francisco. The servings were pretty large, and each dish was $15-20, which I think is fair. That's about the price of a decent cheeseburger at a lot of downtown places.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience. My in-laws, who regularly visit San Francisco, said they would be going back.\n\nMy one recommendation is that you make reservations because the place is kind of small.", "author": "Tom D."}

The restaurant is bright and decorated with colorful photos on the wall.  We received a friendly greeting and even though is was Friday at noon, we had our pick of seating.  Come 12:30, the tables were filled.\n\nFor lunch, we ordered family style:  Won Ton Soup, Beef Chow Fun, Salt and Chili Pepper, and Ma Po Tofu with pork.  The calamari came in medium sized pieces on a bed of fried Won Ton strips.  It was a little greasy, but crispy with the an appropriate amount of salt to bring out the flavor.  The Jalapeno jalapeno pepper slices were more of a garnish.  I ate all of the slices, since my Mom and sister left those to me!  The Ma Po Tofu with pork had a nice spicy kick to it.  Enjoy it with rice.  The small cup of soup was crammed with four Won Tons.  I liked the Beef Chow Fun.\n\nThe service was well-paced, with a small break between and appetizers and our main meal.  At the conclusion of our meal, a bowl of fortune cookies was brought to us, regular and chocolate.\n\nI recommend stopping by while you are in the neighborhood, but since this is Chestnut Street, you may have to circle around for parking or walk a bit further if you park in the neighboring streets.

I explained how there was no parking anywhere so I stopped directly in front of the restaurant... so close that I could throw an egg roll and hit the front door with it. They could see me waving at them when they picked up the phone. What REALLY pissed me off in the whole rant was when he angrily said something like \"this is asking for a lot!\" - regarding my request to bring the bags and credit card slip to sign (TO THE SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF THEIR DOOR). I didn't want to get a ticket, which is why I stayed in the car. \n\nIf the owner ever reads this: For me to have requested that you walk out to the sidewalk and hand me two bags and a check to sign is NOT asking a lot... especially for a $150 order. Consider the average bill for this place, and how many times you'd have to walk back and forth from the kitchen to service a table. \n\nAs I'm signing this check, he continues to angrily berate me about how there's a table upstairs, and people on the phone, and how they don't do this... etc etc etc.. AND THIS GUY IS THE OWNER! There was maybe one or two tables seated in the main room, and I could see that because I was right outside. Even if there was a table of eleven somewhere, it wouldn't have made a difference in the very inappropriate manner in which he behaved. Insult on injury- he voluntarily told me (as he walked away) that there were no utensils and that I would have to figure that out myself. \n\nI didn't say much to prompt this type of behavior... I was stunned and shocked that I could barely get words out of my mouth. I can't believe I even followed through on my promise to tip for a to-go order to be brought to me, in front of their door. \n\nThere won't be a next time, and I will refuse to bring food from this place to ANY of the offices I work with. I told my clients this today as well. They won't be patronizing your establishment again either. My clients told me that I should have just left and have him eat the $150 order...

Definitely not worth the $13.\n\n- Tea Smoked Duck - 4 stars, It's very tasty but even for being an appetizer the portion is on the smaller side.\n\nSoups: \n\n- Won Ton Noodle Soup - 2 stars - The broth on this soup is very bland , I always see everyone adding large amounts of soy sauce or chili to it in a failed attempt to make it better. The noodles in this soup seem to just be in one big block and when you actually taste them they just taste like the were covered in flour or left sitting in some starch. The won tons are the only thing in this soup that is quite tasty on it's own.\n\nVeggie Courses:\n\n- Stir Fried Vegetables - 1  star- Once again what could be a great dish is hit with the curse of blandness. This would be great with something as simple as a little more salt and pepper. \n\nVeggie Fried Rice - 4 stars - This dish  was as tasty as it was hearty, If I ever come back this will be my go to.\n\nDinner/Main Courses:\n\n- Chicken Chow Mein - 4 stars The noodles are on the thinner side but overall this was dish was tasty and the pieces of chicken were tender and flavorful\n\n- Kung Pao Prawns - 0 stars -  This was a huge disappointment and a dish I'd advise against ordering if you love Kung Pao Prawns. When I think of Kung Pao Prawns , I think of crispy prawns with enough heat with celery and peanuts. This dish reminded me of buffalo wings :(  The sauce the prawns where tossed was so tart and vinegary that none of the heat that was supposed to be there came through. It came with a mix of broccoli and cauliflower and peanuts which were the best part of the dish.  ** For switching out the chicken for prawns there is a $4-$5 fee which would be fine if the dish was  actually good but it's not :// \n\n- Stir Fry Chicken and Vegetables - 3 stars - The chicken was quite tasty and flavorful while the veggies were lacking.\n\n- Seafood Bird's Nest - 3 stars only b/c the best part of this dish is the actual nest made of potatoes and who can hate on potatoes. The scallops were and prawns were ok in flavor not too great but also not entirely disappointing, the calamari I had to actually stop to make sure it was in there because of the tiny mini pieces you get in the dish. \n\n- Stir Fried Salmon - 4 stars This was the tastiest dish imo , The salmon was tasty and the tofu while I thought the pieces were too big very nicely absorbed the sauce they they were served in, If I'm ever dragged here again I'll make sure to order this dish. \n\n- Crystal Prawns - 0 stars this dish could be great but once again there is no seasoning. It comes covered in a mound of soy beans too many for the size of the dish. \n\n\n\nThe Dragon Well is one of my least favorite places for Chinese food. I've been here about 4 times b/c of family and unless I'm dragged here I won't be back.\n\nSave your time and money & just  find another Chinese spot.", "author": "Glenda A."}

Around dinner time, there are so many 20 and 30-somethings walking around, and the street is alive with restaurants and shops alike. We only waited maybe five minutes on a Saturday night for an open table. I read a review that stated this place is somewhat like a local P.F. Changs. It isn't at all. The flavors were way more original, and it reminded me way more of going to a hole-in-the-wall Chinese place than some Americanized chain.\n\nI was so excited at all the gluten free options on the menu that my dad and I way over ordered.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-05-21", "description": "This place has the BEST potstickers in the entire world. My Chinese Grandmother is turning over in her grave right now for me saying this! \n\nTo put it lightly, I am a potsticker enthusiast. A connoisseur, if you will. I have spent many years in search of the perfect potsticker: not too doughy, not too thin, not filled with bullshit cabbage and skimping on the meat, perfectly crispy and so on. I could wax poetic on this for days. \n\nI have lived in the Marina for 13 years and for the better half of it, I avoided this place like the plague for a number of reasons. Mainly because I left like it was fancy Chinese food and the place is filled with the standard annoying, yoga pant wearing women and bros of the marina. The menu is also lacking in that I think there are something like only 14 entrees offered. And cashew chicken isn't one of them! Major fail. \n\nAnyhow, one hungover afternoon, after having already tried and written off all the potstickers within walking distance, I bravely entered Dragon Well, determined to ignore all the exposed toes on the flip flop and salmon colored shirt adorned bros. I ordered the pork potstickers, well done with a side of hot oil: standard operating procedure. My order was ready before I was able to analyze and think terrible thoughts about all the patrons and moseyed on home with my bag of delight.\n\nI opened the box expecting disappointment and was blow away at the sight and smell: they were the perfect color of brown, beautifully crisped and smelled of absolute heaven. Eagerly, I took my first bite. I was instantly hooked and was transported to a happy place I never knew existed. Complete perfection on every level. \n\nAfter weeks of ordering the same thing, even sometimes getting two orders (4 pieces of this perfection is just not enough sometimes), I had to compliment the host on these delicious little wonders! He told me that there is one lady who is the dedicated potsticker maker. That is her one and only job: to make these fabulous and perfect potstickers! How could this be?!! One lady who's sole purpose of employment was to make these little bundles of joy? I was bewildered and amazed. But it makes absolute sense: these fucking things are so perfect, they found their ace and realized she was worth the specialized role as I don't even know if anyone else on the planet could ever replicate such perfection. \n\nSpeaking of perfection, the hot oil is so delicious I could bathe in it. I also had to ask about this. It turns out it is made with garlic and is pressed to perfection and is void of all those annoying chili flakes that can make an otherwise perfect oil have moments of bitterness. \n\nIf you enjoy life, like to eat, then you MUST have an order (or 3) of their potstickers. If you don't, please go fall down some stairs as the world doesn't need your kind! Now get off your phone, laptop or computer and do yourself and your tummy a favor: go to dragon well and get the MF'n potstickers. \n\nYou can thank me later.", "author": "Lucia V."}

Arriving without a reservation on a Saturday night, we were greeted by a very friendly front desk woman, later learning she is an owner. We scored with the front table that opens on to Chestnut. We skipped ordering an appetizer and went straight to ordering chicken chow mein, savory sweet stir fried beef, crystal prawns, kung pao and streamed rice. I noticed a lighter touch with the dishes, a good thing. The stir fried beef was a bit too sweet for our tastes (this is our error because \"sweet\" is in the title and we should have known better!). The crystal prawns lacked a lot of sauce flavor but the flavor of the prawns themselves came through but was just a little plain. I will admit to always wanting to find Kung Pao chicken that matches my favorite from another restaurant. This Kung Pao was good, just did not match my favorite. But good food overall. What sets this place apart is their service. Our water glasses were refilled constantly and our waitperson was so attentive.

I've actually never had a bad meal here, and considering its location in the Marina, where real Chinese food is practically nonexistent, it's really a pleasant surprise.\n\nIf you are stuck in the Marina and crave Chinese food, Dragon Well is a solid pick.  If you want a more budget-friendly and authentic meal, definitely venture to the Richmond, Sunset, or Chinatown.", "author": "Tori S."}

I always add extra Bok choy to my wonton noodle soup.  Extra implies that there is bok choy already in the soup.  This soup is the main reason why I kept coming back.  Now apparently there shouldn't be any bok choy in the soup, which is news to be since I have been eating here for almost 2 years.\n\nMy main issue is that I, very nicely, called and said that normally when I ask for extra bok choy, you can tell that there EXTRA bok choy - the soup appears greens due to the amount that they kindly add for me.  The woman on the phone very nicely says she is sorry and to come over and she will give me the extra bok choy on the side.  She also asks if I would like some more broth on the side and I say sure and thank you because i think it is very nice.  \n\nI walk all the way back to the restaurant to have an owner blatantly disrespect me verbally.  She very obnoxiously tells me that I am wrong and that she has had the restaurant for 15 years and never has it included bok choy.  I explain that I know what I am accustomed to eating and only recently started asking for EXTRA bok choy.  She continues to contradict me in front of many other patrons in the restaurant.  How embarrassing.  She tells me it is just spinach.  I know the difference between bok choy and spinach.  But thank you for trying to imply my ignorance.\n\nI choose my battles wisely and wouldn't just for the 'sake of it' call and tell them that they didn't include what they normally do.  I wouldn't take time out of my night to walk all the way back to a restaurant for no reason after I already returned home with my fianc\u00e9.  This restaurant is not cheap and yet we continued to go because of their service and there BOK CHOY IN THEIR WONTON NOODLE SOUP!!!!!\n\nThis owner really needs to take a step back and realize that how you treat people will directly affect your business.  This is one of the first times I have dealt with her and my suggestion is for her to stay in the back with the kitchen or stay home.  She absolutely ruined my experience.   I am beyond disappointed in her lack of tact in handling this matter and will be certain not to come back.  I have also gone ahead and told all of my friends who live in the Marina and Pac Heights not to eat there anymore.\n\nOh and I never got the broth either.

We were craving good Chinese take-out recently, and my parents had previously suggested this restaurant, so we gave it a try.  We were very pleasantly surprised with the food and overall experience, and we are sure to try them again, and perhaps eat in their restaurant sometime as well.\n\nWe arrived on a busy night to make our pickup- the restaurant was full and many people were waiting, and since parking is hectic around there- my wife ran in while I double-parked.  Our food was ready on time, and as we discovered when we arrived home- very well packed.  We had their very excellent pork pot-stickers- a great crisp and delicious through and through.  We had the tea-smoked duck with buns- this was my favorite dish and I will make sure to order it every time.  We also had a beef chow-fun, which was a bit bland for my tastes however my wife enjoyed it, and an order of crispy spring rolls.  Last but not least was the walnut prawn dish, which we both enjoyed very much.  The menu was not 'overly ethnic', but still lots of variety and quality ingredients at decent prices.\n\nMy lack of excitement over many other options will surely have me ordering from here again.  I'd rather drive here than have several of my 'regulars' deliver to me, if that means anything.  Worth a try if you are in the area/live nearby- I think you will enjoy.", "author": "Andy S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-04-09", "description": "The Chinese Restaurant conundrum - everyone has a mindset that Chinese food should be CHEAP.  The only way to make Chinese food CHEAP is to use CHEAP ingredients and mask this with MSG and Soy Sauce (Na+)  \nI don't like CHEAP ingredients - I like organic produce (all of it doesn't have to be organic but most should be) I like my meat/chicken to AT LEAST be antibiotic free - organic is even better.  \n\nMSG gives me a headache-cotton mouth-spacey feeling afterwards, copious amounts of soy sauce means I will wake up bloated.  Also long term use of these ingredients dulls the taste buds. \n \nSo when a restaurant DOES use organic ingredients and quality meat without MSG and excessive soy sauce - you can expect complaints about price/portion size and blandness.  \n\nBeing able to taste the underlying ingredients of a Chinese dish does not mean the sauce is bland - MSG and sodium dulled taste buds can be retrained but one has to go through a period of \"withdrawal\" until food taste good again.   \n\nThat being said Dragon Well is one of the few Chinese restaurants in SF that I can enjoy.  I wish some dishes used even pricier ingredients - I'm willing to pay for quality food - but that would garner even more complaints.", "author": "Susan P."}

Located in the Marina, you know this isn't your typical Chinese restaurant serving authentic cuisine but when I took a glimpse of the kitchen I did find a couple of Chinese chefs so there was hope (I thought).\n\nWe ordered spring rolls, tea smoked duck, lettuce cups, black bean chicken, mongolian beef, and barbeque pork fried rice.  Spring rolls were well made but the lettuce cup had tons of chilies or jalapenos which made it too spicy for me.  The tea smoked duck was the surprise of the night; similar to peking duck but a few pieces of duck meat perfectly seasoned put into a bun, this really was a very good dish.  The beef and chicken both had a bit of heat to it which means I couldn't really eat it without sweating so I opted to stay away from it.  The barbeque pork fried rice had diced carrots in there usually a no no for fried rice but the quality of the barbeque pork was very good which made the fried rice a success.  \n\nService was good, prices are average; we spent about $80 before tips which included tea, wine and six dishes.  \n\nWould I come back?  I'm not so sure.  There are a lot of places to eat in that area but if there aren't any tables or I had a hankering for Chinese food I might stop by.", "author": "Pierre L."}

There are some traditional Chinese dishes (Chow-mein, Kung Pao Chicken) and some unique dishes (Hawaiian Butterfish), all of which are good.  \n\nThe only down side is that the menu isn't huge, so if you go there a few times (or many like myself), you start to feel a little limited in options.

It's more of an americanized Chinese style; they serve dishes prepared with organic ingredients and the restaurant is very well kept. \n\nOn cold days, I love to get their hot and sour soup. It really hits the spot. Sometimes, they add a teensy bit more pepper than I'd like though. Their won ton soup is quite delicious as well. The steam hawaiian butterfish was very melty, but the portion was a bit small.\n\nI would suggest getting their lunch specials because they're pretty filling and their brown rice is bomb as well.\n\nNot my go-to Chinese place, but hits the spot when I'm craving it during work.

The only problem is the food is kind of boring in flavor.\"\n\nThis is a good place to take relatives from out of town, especially for lunch while showing them the Marina (believe me, I don't like the Marina, but as a good hostess, you have to do it!).  Because the food is kind of boring, it's hard to affirmatively dislike D.W.  So, it's safe.  Also, the prices are reasonable, especially for the Marina.\n\nMy biggest complaint -- Three times I have come here and ordered veggie dumplings.  The second time, meat dumplings came out and I sent them back and got veggie dumplings.  The third time, 5 veggie and one meat dumpling came out.  I bit in and had pork for the first time in years.  In my opinion, that's a pretty big mistake.  I told the waitress - all I got in response was one veggie dumpling to replace the pork -- 10 minutes later!!  Crazy, right?", "author": "Cara C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-05-28", "description": "I'm giving it 3 stars only.  May I start by saying I love the food and the staff is SO nice...but, two things: \n\n1) Short but sweet - THEY COOK WITH CORN OIL.  THAT IS NOT HEALTHY.  THAT S--- IS NOT HEALTHY.  Which, I believe, probably relates to the fact that they are CHEAP, an issue conveyed in the much more detailed second reason I am not inclined to give this place any more stars.  Oh - and probably because it's CHEAPER to use plastic (which, when containing hot liquid, may be more likely to leach toxins into what you're eating) they now put some to-go items in plastic containers.  \n\n2) The management and ownership of any dining establishment goes a long way with me.  I've recently tapered off my visits (and MONEY, please pay attention, Dragon Well, the MONEY is not going to be coming so fast from me) because of the ownership.  The ownership (the girl who is always there, forget her name, but she's Asian and I know that doesn't help to narrow down anyone's identity) is just short-sighted and cheap as it can be. \n\nI usually don't think to write a review unless I have a really bad experience, whether isolated or overarching, or unless I love a place.  But my experience today just bugged the snot out of me. \n\nBad day.  Actually decent day, til about 1:30.  Suddenly things went wrong.  Decided to grab something to eat from the old DW, to go.  Walked in, paid by credit card, distracted by my bad day. \n\nThen realized, crap! I need a beverage.  I tell the very sweet server I forgot to ask for said beverage and would she mind.  As the very sweet server was filling my beverage (nothing had been said yet about charging me or not, but server knew about my bad day) Manager/ower comes stomping up.  I bring in new people, four tops, get take out a LOT at this place.  She doesn't greet me.  No customer service for this girl, no way.  She sees server filling my beverage and doesn't make eye contact - she just makes a beeline to see my ticket.  She almost stabs her hand on the little metal stand that the paid tickets get stacked on, she can't grab my ticket fast enough.  \n\nShe's checking to see - did I pay the $2.71 for my beverage?  She's gotta catch this shit, quick like, before I can get out the door with my $2.71 in my pocket still.  FAST!  PRONTO.  \n\nI hadn't paid yet.  And I didn't want server to get in trouble, and the situation was innocent and no payment had been discussed for lack of an opportunity.  The server is standing at the beverage counter, I'm ten feet away at the payment counter, and the place is loud.  But I could see how it looked \"bad\" (if it can look \"bad\" to give a long-time customer a free overpriced beverage once in a while). \n\nI made a couple pointed comments - the same comment twice, actually.  \"I saw you immediately grabbed for my ticket to see if I had paid\" (read:  you're a cheap, shortsighted pain in my ass who I can't stand that I am making you any money and if it weren't for your sweet - although sometimes on the slow side - staff, convenient location and edible food, I'd never darken your doors which probably are made of cardboard because you're just that cheap).  Owner/manager happily took my money, totally didn't take my point, and then I got outta there.  Whatever, some of her workers give me free stuff all the time behind her back, and they talk about how cheap she is.  So I'm not all that buzzed up about this incident - just the oppressive mentality and its long-term effect.  \n\nOn the way back to work I thought about it.  I like this place, but I'm too annoyed.  I've said it repeatedly, the staff can be slow but they are all great.  I think I'm going to keep tapering off my visits, paying them nice tips in cash when I do go in, and pray that something happens to the owner/manager that makes her see that while money may be necessary to eat, there are more important things in life.  Like, I don't know, maybe 5 stars on Yelp?  No, seriously, any businessperson can stand to free themselves a bit from the clenches of corporate greed.  \n\nWe're all in a recession, and that will be over, but people won't forget how you made them feel when our wallets were all a little lighter.", "author": "Jennifer M."}

It seems buzzling, but not loud.  \n\nFood:  We ordered the lettuce cup, mongolian beef, walnut prawns, and pot sticker.    Let lettuce cup was very good.  I would say better than the other in SF that I have eaten.  I cleaned out the plate and wish I could have more.   The walnut prawns were retty good as well, tender and flavorful.

It was busy for a Monday night but service was great and the owner (I think?)  was very friendly at the front and she was checking up on us which was nice. We ordered the Mongolian beef and curry mi fun noodles.  The noodles I thought could have used a teeny bit more salt, but with the mongolian beef dish being flavorful it more than made up for it.  Actually the two made a great combination of dishes to get, I though.  Yummy!\n\nPleasantly surprised with the food here.  Typically I'm not a fan of the P.F. Chang type Chinese food, but I liked this place a lot.  First of all, I absolutely loved the decor inside.  High ceilings, cool hanging lights, and there's a nice display of vases in the back, great atmosphere.  \n\nI got the lychee iced tea..it tasted like regular iced tea with just a hint of lychee.  Not quite what I was expecting, I thought it would be a sweet drink but it was still good. We ordered the spring roll appetizer walnut prawns and dragon beef.  You get 3 spring rolls cut in half, served with a sweet and sour sauce and mustard sauce.  Without the sauce, I thought they were a little on the bland side but really really good wtih the sweet and sour sauce.  The walnut prawns were so good, and the walnuts are perfectly crispy and also come with dried garlic slices.  The dragon beef was very good also, but be warned that there were more scallions and chives than slices of beef.  But I like scallions and the flavor was good.  Overall I thought everything was very light tasting and I didn't feel heavy afterwards like with regular Chinese food.

She raved about this place and then went on to say how she likes PF Changs type of chinese food, so I immediately assumed this would be ho hum bland chinese food. Another lesson in life to not assume before you know.  This was some flavorful stuff.\n\nStarted off with a tiger beer, loved the name and haven't seen it before.  Was good but was like an asian Heineken.  \n\nStarted with the salt and pepper calamari.  Which was actually pieces of calamari steak and not the little rings or horrible tentacles! Nice touch.  Perfect spice and flavor and had these good crispy noodles under it.  \n\nNext we had the vegetarian salad which was the only semi-disapointment.  Really good crispy tofu but the dressing was bland and barely there.  And there was so much cilantro that was all I could really taste. \n\nOn to the wok tossed prawns that I was told we would order before we got there.  They did live up to their legacy and more.  We also had the sichuan green beans which were good.\n\nI don't know what kind of rice they use as their steamed rice but it has an amazing flavor. Didn't even need soy sauce!!\n\nService was great we had a cute, sweet blond girl that was always there to check on us or when we needed her.", "author": "L B."}

I've taken my parents & friends here a few times and they've all really liked it.\n\nThe food could be a little better in terms of consistency, as there have been a couple of times when my chow mein was a bit too greasy, but for the most part I've walked away full & satisfied. They have a variety of items that are hits: Lettuce cups, Chicken Vegetable Stir Fry, Walnut Prawns, Chinese Chicken Salad, & of course the Chicken Chow Mein. I don't recommend getting a plate of their vegetables if you're going to order the Chicken Vegetable Stir Fry since it's basically the same exact vegetables sans the meat. The only menu item I haven't been impressed with is their Hot & Sour soup which in a bad way, just didn't seem like the typical Hot & Sour Soup. Two of my co-workers had poor opinions of the soup as well. On the other hand, their wine selection is excellent w/ a full bodied Pinot Noir from Laetitia Winery & a refreshing Chardonnay. \n\nService has been good w/ friendly waiters & a great manager. When I was there for my brother's b-day dinner, the large dinner party next to us was being obnoxiously loud (the sound in there echoes easily given that they have such high ceilings) and when my dad complained to the manager, he quickly took care of the problem.\n\nTheir overall ambiance is just OK- they have a slight modern feel to it w/ dark wood tables & chairs along with a few authentic images of SF's Chinatown natives, but it tends to give off a cold & empty sort of vibe that's a bit worn around the edges. \n\nDragon Well is a good go-to place for lunch breaks since I work just around the corner, but I still think that they could perfect a few more things.", "author": "Tiffany M."}

Hey Dumb Mothers abound - you are not the first or last d-bag to get knocked up, and no one thinks it's cute if you act like a social retard and disregard other diners just to dine out with your little Timmy One Tooth.  Fuck that shit is annoying.

I've since stuck to ordering this as I felt the Tomato, Beef and Tofu plate I got a couple times always left me unsatisfied.\n\nMy bf typically gets a serving of their Steamed Rice with the Stir-Fried Chicken and Vegetables or the Lemongrass Chicken - both are good, but Chicken is probably my least favorite dead animal so it's only fair that I don't go too far into a description.\n\nI'm also down with their Lychee Iced Tea, so overall I can't really complain.

Are we required to only eat the most authentic of foods?\n\nWhen I was in Shanghai, some friends and I had a local graduate student and his girlfriend (Funny story that, he apparently was married but this was his girl on the side) show us around town.   We bought copy goods at the Xiangyang market.  Had some really good noodle soup for lunch.   The student proudly showed us Chairman Mao's statue (I bit my tongue) and shook his fist at Madame Chiang Kai-Shek's house (who died in SF, I didn't bring that up).   In the evening we crossed the river into Pudong, the part of the city that is straight out of Blade Runner.   We ended up trying to find a restaurant in a super-modern mall that looked like it had been constructed last week.   The name of the place we ate?  \"San Francisco\"    No shit.   My friends (from Italy and France) demanded it, and I humored them.   The food was mostly steak and italian, and the prices were well beyond the means of the average Shanghaiiese.   The decor was bits and pieces of SF landmarks, thrown together with no apparent rhyme or reason.   At the end of the meal, which was a bit bland, but ok, my guide asked what I thought.  Was it like San Francisco food?  \n\nIs it my place to tell him no?  Odds are neither he nor most of the other patrons of this restaurant will ever go to San Francisco.

We shared two entrees - Kung Pao Chicken and the Eggplant. The chicken was very good, although a little heavy on the peanuts. The Eggplant was fantastic in a spicy barbeque like sauce, cooked just soft enough, which tends to be tough for a lot of restaurants.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-12-21", "description": "What used to be one of our favorite Chinese restaurants is now our least favorite. IF I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS, I WOULD. And now, the review:\nWe discovered about a year or so ago that the dishes were beginning to just not be as flavorful and good as before and the restaurant was going downhill. Tonight we thought we'd give it another try. \nWe ordered two items: WonTon Noodle soup, to warm us up from the cold weather outside, and beef chow mein with extra bean sprouts. It was early (about 5:30pm) and a slow night as only about 5 tables had customers. We waited about 10-15 minutes. Waitress set  the small soup bowls on the table edge and put two dishes in front of us.  Finally, food is delivered by a different waitress......the chow mein with the extra bean sprouts - fine, BUT, we would of thought the soup would be served first, right? I mentioned this to the waitress and she says \"Oh, you don't want both items brought at the same time?\"I said well at every Chinese restaurant I've eaten at, the soup is usually served and eaten first\" - she said, oh, no problem, I'll take the chow mein back and we'll make you a new batch one later. I said well, okay maybe they can keep it warm sonewhere in the kitchen. The soup was appar;ently not made because \n15 - 20 more minutes go by - and no soup. (which at this point I am thinking they never made it for us in the first place) - and other's who arrive after us get served soup and food.  Finally, the little nice water lady comes and brings the soup. I did say to her in a comical way \"oh, I thought maybe they had to go to Hong Kong to make the soup\" - she said she was sorry it took so long, and I said to her \"well, it's not your fault,  it's okay\".  The soup wasn't put into the small bowls for us, and I thought that kind of unusual for an upscale restaurant. So we serve ourselves. In the middle of eating the soup (which by the way has way too many long noodles in it and not enough other ingredients) the original waitress brings another bowl of chow mein even though we still have of a big bowl of soup to finish - I look at the chowmein and can see it barely has any bean sprouts and I ask her if they put the extra bean sprouts in it....she says\n \"I DOUBT IT\" (weird remark) - I also mentioned that we had a way to go on our soup yet and we thought we would get the chow mein after we finished the soup so it wouldn't get cold before we got to it.. She says, oh, I can have them make another batch for you. I say \"no, just leave the chow mein here, bring me a bowl to cover it to keep it warm and questioned to her what's going on in the kitchen - no answer, no apology  and I am sure  she knew we were justifiably frustrated but she never apologized or acted embarrassed about the weird service we got. The chow mein, by the way, had about two slices of yellow onion in it, and 5 bean sprouts, 5 small pieces of green onion and the beef - and the noodles were very greasy and overloaded with oil.  We wanted to get out of there, and hell if I was going to leave a tip. We got the bill, and I did notice that we were not charged for the chow mein and I brought that to the waitresses attention because if it was an error, I wanted to be honest about it. She says \"oh, it's on the house\". We paid the bill and left thinking we would never go back again. That was it.  No tip was left, but I did leave the fortune from our fortune cookie which appropriately said: \"it would be wise if you make efforts to  broaden your horizon\" - I know this review is very long and probably boring, but I had to document our experience.  I plan on calling and speaking to the owner.\nIt's a shame to see such a decent restaurant have problems with help and perhaps the cooks, and the food served is just not up to par anymore. I wonder if perhaps they have changed owners.", "author": "Girly Foodie F."}

Everytime we eat this food now I think it does a number on our stomachs ... it's gone downhill. But, I will say that the vegeterian salad is well worth your time, crispy tofu and a nice light lemony dressing. The walnut prawns are great too, but no one in the marina would be caught dead eatting them since they are drenched in mayo. And beware of the fortune cookies ... the chocolate ones are usually stale and the plain ones never get you anything worth repeating (in bed).", "author": "Amanda C."}

The food is excellent, service attentive, and prices reasonable.  It has been a little over 12 1/2 years since I last dined here and things have not changed.  Back then, I ordered pot stickers, steamed Hawaiian butter fish, and steamed rice; all excellent.  Fastforward to last night, I ordered pork pot stickers, egg rolls, and dragon beef.  The pot stickers are wonderful; crispy golden and not doughy with a perfect ground pork, cabbage, and ginger filling; I love the soy sauce that comes with it as it has more of a soy and wine taste with scallions.  The egg rolls are crispy and greasless with a medley of vegetables and silver noodles; perfect with the well balanced sweet and sour sauce or hot yet not too hot or overpowering mustard sauce.  The dragon beef is superb with julienned slices of beef, broccoli, five spice tofu, and green and red peppers in a spicy sauce; the chili peppers are As thin that you do eat them as they are Incorporated and don't make your mouth feel like a Hawaiian volcano.  Our waiter gave us both regular and chocolate fortune cookies; both fresh, the chocolate one having just the right amount of flavor and not too sweet.  Round it off with a Tiger Beer and you will not be disappointed.  So, for excellent Chinese cuisine at reasonable prices in a casual atmosphere, Dragon Well cannot be beat.

Lets just say the place wasn't packed. \nAfter about 30 minutes we told her to forget the 2nd dish.  Meanwhile the 1st dish tasted horrible.  When we told her that, she was rude again.

In a moment of hunger and desperation, though, one can't be picky. We popped into Dragon Well after a long urban hike from Nob Hill to the Marina. We ordered chicken lettuce wraps and peking duck for starters - both were tasty. For the entree, I had the beef and tomato dish, which was surprisingly very delicious. It had a perfectly balanced sauce and tender pieces of beef. Nate C. ordered beef chow fun and they made the common mistake that most American Chinese restaurants do - soy sauce soy sauce soy sauce. I don't know why restaurants feel they can skimp out on making a good sauce and just drench the noodles in soy. Gross. Overall, while my dish was amazing, I'm not running to my friends telling them this is a must-try.

This place, however, seems to pull it off, at least for those of us willing to sometimes have a more Californian perspective on Chinese food.  The subtle flavor of the Chinese Chicken Salad (which is one of the few dishes that comes in a large portion) creeps up on you and gets better with every bite.  The hot and sour soup was absolutely perfect for those of us with a taste for lots of white pepper - we first thought there was a mistake and the chef had accidentally added too much (to our delight).  When we came back and tried it again, there was slightly less white pepper, but still enough to make us believe the first time was not a mistake.  Minced Chicken Lettuce Cups is another tasty favorite.", "author": "Alice C."}

The Chinese food I usually get is from little ghetto Chinese places or those quick already made full of MSG places downtown, so it was nice to finally get restaurant style Chinese.

It is not pretentious at all, but rather offers what it states, healthy chinese fare at reasonable prices.

The atmosphere and service are friendly and inviting without being stifling.  For its size, they maximize the space while minimizing the noise.  For starters, we love the veggie potstickers.  The hot-and-sour soup is full of fresh veggies and has a very nice harmony of flavors for your palate, and is big enough for 3-4 people.  The chicken in the chicken chow mein is the way you wish it to be, moist and tender  and plentiful.  Vegetarians will appreciate the offerings, including the Sichuan Green Beans,  braised in a spicy, ginger, garlic, brown bean and chili sauce, and the Garlic Eggplant, stir-fried in a sweet, brown bean, scallion and garlic sauce.
