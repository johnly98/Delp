We were seated right away. While waiting for foor I went to the self serve salad bar to grab some fruits and appetizers. There are sooo many options - but def save room for the actual meats. Their cheesy bread, which is also unlimited, is SO GOOD. It's really chewy but at the same time has the most amazing texture - it's like eating a mochi cheesy bread!! My favorites were the top sirloin and ribeye. I would personally stay away from the wings - pretty mediocre and not worth the price. I love how they cut everything in front of you, and they alternated pretty fast so I never had to wait around for too long for another speciality to be served. Do be strategic - sometimes they pile meat on your plate and you totally forget what you actually like. I think they might charge extra for anything that you don't finish. \n\nPrice & Portions: Unlimited - all you can eat! BUT it is around $65 per person and even more after tax and tip. \n\nService & Ambiance: Really nice place, great for date nights, group gatherings, and other special occasions! The place is very clean and well-kept. The workers are friendly and personable, I would recommend!", "author": "Yixuan L."}

I'm giving them these stars based on their nice decor and good service but the quality of the meat was so bad. The meats were either bland, overcooked, or super salty. \n\nWhat really pissed us off was their sly way of getting expensive a la carte items on your table. They walked around with trays of shrimp cocktails and was very quick to put it down with no mention that it's not included in the dinner. After about four shrimp cocktails in, I stopped the waiter to asked if it was included and he said no. However, he didn't know the cost.  It ended up being 21.00 each!

I did have quite a lot of fun but knowing that the total was more than $100/pp after wine, tip, and tax makes me not want to come back on my own dime.\n\nPROS:\nCHEESY BREAD - Probably my favorite thing about Fogo de Chao. Yes, even more than their steak. I don't care if cheesy bread is a ploy to make you full.. I'll take another basket.\nVARIETY - This is perhaps the main reason to come here and why Fogo is always so much fun. Carbs, veggies, meats of all kinds.\nSOMETHING FOR EVERYONE - Meatlovers rejoice. We came with a vegan who enjoyed the salad bar and sides. \nSERVICE - Service is prompt and good. The owner came by to make sure everything was coming out at a good pace. They definitely care about how they treat their diners. If you're looking for a cut of meat that hasn't come around, just ask and they'll send it over.\nSTRONG DRINKS - Everyone at my table said their cocktails were very strong.\nEASY RESERVATIONS - Man, last minute reservations are so hard to come by in SF unless you want a 10pm dinner slot. Thankfully, Fogo normally has availability.\n\nCONS:\nPRICE - I wouldn't say $65 is worth it if you want the best quality cuts of meat - for that, I'd recommend a traditional steakhouse instead. \nTOO SALTY - The majority of dishes were oversalted. One prime sirloin in particular was the saltiest thing I've ever had at a restaurant. My speculation is that they do this to make us drink more water and get bloated so we stop eating.\nDESSERTS - The flan was overly sweet in a way I couldn't even finish it (and I love flan). The creme brulee was too sweet too but bearable.", "author": "Sally L."}

Because what's the point in paying $65ish a person without tax and tip for some grass (aka veggies)???\n\nCame here on a Saturday night just because sometimes I like fancy date nights with my boo. I remember the last time I went to my first Brazilian steakhouse Espetus, I had done it all wrong! I ate cheese bread, grilled pineapple, and more cheese bread and very little meat.This time, I came armed with a killer strategy.\n\nThe plan was to have a very light breakfast, go running during the day, nap, and then have dinner. Bad idea! I nearly fainted from my run because I hadn't consumed enough sugars to sustain my energy. But it's okay I was alive to make it to my reservation and didn't have to forfeit. \n\nThe trick is to save your plate and stomach real estate for the meat, the flesh, the prize. Don't go marinating along the salad bar or feasting on the appetizers, IT'S A TRAP! DON'T DO IT. DO NOT TOUCH.\n\nBecause you will lose precious real estate by doing so and missing out on the most delicious meat your sharp little fangs have ever sliced.\n\nMy favorites: Top Sirloin, Bottom Sirloin, and BEEF RIB! The whole time I was trying to track down the beef rib guy who went on a break so his apprentice was walking around lost. Beef ribs are so soft and delicious and they just scream cow. \n\nThe only thing I would dock points for is their lack of grilled pineapple. I think the grilled pineapple is very much so a palate cleanser and not to mention the fruit enzymes help break down the meat.\n\nAll in all, it was a solid date night. I don't think I ate so much meat in one sitting in my life but thank goodness I was being extra strategic and wore a skirt. A skirt or fancy stretchy pants are always a good tactic for AYCE.\n\nStick with the sirloins and beef ribs. Avoid the chicken filler, salad bar, and tasty bread and garlic mash potato offerings, it's a TRAP.", "author": "Connie M."}

We were greeted right at the door, we had reservations for a birthday and they sat us right away. Our waiter was Miles and he went over everything. Some people feel the whole experience which is all meat and salad bar is too expensive or just too much for a small appetite. Miles went over everything and even mentioned the August special which was the salad bar and most the meat but not all for about $39. I went for that lol and they gave us pretty much all the meat, the garlic sirloin was to die for. \n\nThe salad bar has everything you can imagine from vegetables, to meats, to fruits and rice and beans. There is no way you won't get full over here and everything is so delicious. Once done John David came over to our table and asked us how everything was.. He mentioned for the dessert to try the Brazilian flan. Let me say this is the best flan I have ever had in my life. It was really thick and the taste was just amazing.

When you flip your card over to green, the servers bombard you with tons of different cuts of meat. The best was the bacon-wrapped filet mignon. The different sirloin cuts, the garlic sirloin, and the ribeye were good too. Didn't try the other meats but they also had bacon wrapped chicken, chicken legs, Parmesan crusted pork, pork chops, and lamb sirloin. I did not see any chicken hearts or ribs. \n- the market table has a pretty decent selection. I liked the smoked salmon and the fresh watermelon and pineapple. It was refilled often and quickly.\n- The cheesy bread is to die for. I could eat that all day.\n\nCons:\n- Pricey, at $62 per person for weekday dinner before tax and tip.\n- The sides were not that good. The fries were cold and hard. \n- Service was terrible after we were finished eating. No one came to clear our plates or check in on us for forever. It took a long time to get the check.\n- No acknowledgement that we were celebrating a birthday (even though I clearly wrote it in the Open Table reservation), no happy birthday wishes, dessert, or anything. I'm pretty disappointed by this since every other high end restaurant does this, and does it well. \n- No validated parking in a busy area, and valet is $20.\n\nVerdict: it's pretty good, but for the price I would rather eat at the Capital Grille, where I feel like the service is better.", "author": "Amy C."}

The price to quantity ratio doesn't work out for those who can't eat that much.

It was easy to make the reservation for a big group. We were provided the wine list in advance and were able to research and select wine for the table. The only thing is that the actual wine list turned out to be about 5-10% more expensive than the version we were given originally.\n\nService was good and the servers took video and photos of our group. As expected, there was tons of meat. The restaurant also comped a few desserts at the end, which was really nice. It was the perfect place for the occasion we were celebrating.

Came here with a large group to celebrate a birthday and when we finally settled down to receive meat, I was SO overwhelmed. We didn't receive a MENU to explain the meats, so we just had multiple people at our table all at once asking us if we want some part of some animal.

I couldn't remember which piece I liked because there was a huge pile of meat on my plate after 5 minutes. \n\nThey need to slow down, or have multiple people come with the SAME meat so everyone can try everything. \n\nRegardless to say, not every piece was good and you just have to try and hope that you remembered which one that was. \n\nOh!! BEWARE!!! They will try to upsell you water. They asked us if we wanted still or sparkling, we asked for still.. they came back with $10 bottles of WATER that we didn't know were $10 each until the bill came. $40 for WATER!!!!!!!!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-05", "description": "This is a really fun place to celebrate a special occasion with a group of friends and we did just that on a Saturday night. The evening starts with a trip to a well stocked market table that includes fruits, vegetables, pork products (they have bacon and prosciutto), smoked salmon, cheeses and a bunch of grains.  \n\nAfter that, servers bring meat dishes (lamb, pork, chicken and beef) on skewers.  You have to order certain items (e.g., the beef ribs or chicken hearts) separately.  The beef ribs are my favorite though all of the meats are really tasty.  The desserts we ordered were also surprisingly good (key lime pie and chocolate mousse cake).  \n\nFor food quality, this restaurant is a solid 4.  The market table has good items (get the bacon and the quinoa, skip the prosciutto).  The cheese popovers were great starters too. The meats were excellent. One other thing is that they make a mean pitcher of Sangria.\n\nAmbiance is also a solid 4 and can't beat the convenient location across from the W hotel.  The one area for improvement is the service (a 3 at best).  This place gets really busy and there are points in the relatively long meal where you will be left looking for a non-skewer bearing server.  Prices are also on the high side (expect to pay about $100 including tax and tip).  Overall, this is a 3.5 rating but I'm rounding up on the strength of the desserts.

Thankfully, my friends and I did not suffer from food poisoning. We had a pleasant experience that left our bellies satisfied.\n\nThe restaurant itself is really elegant. If you want to really impress somebody, bring them here! It was $45 for the ayce, which included the salad bar. One of the meat cutters suggested that we do not fill up on the salad bar and focus on trying all of the different meats. He also told us to not feel obligated to finish any of the meats that we did not like. YESSIR! \n\nMy favorite were all of the sirloins, hands down. The other meats did not stand out to me. Most of the meats I tried were dry and bland (ribeye, lamb, and beef rib); but the linguica was good, and my fianc\u00e9 really liked the garlic steak. One of the other standouts was the cheese bread. It took every ounce in me to not eat hella bread and save my stomach for meat. The salad bar was pretty extensive. There was a variety of cheese, cured meats, fruits, and veggies.  I made sure to be very picky since I wanted to get my money's worth in meat. If I had to do it all over again, I'd only eat sirloin, cheese bread, and a salad. \n\nService was okay.

My boyfriend was like, \"You can always go back... you're missing all the meat!\" So I sat down and then all the chefs started coming to carve meat for us.\n\nI enjoyed the house special sirloin, filet mignon, and parmesan pork. The pork ribs were extremely dry. The chicken was slightly overcooked. And all the other meats were waaay too salty. I was chugging my water from the end of my meal up until bedtime. I'm surprised I didn't wake up in the middle of the night to pee!  \n\nI'm actually not the hugest steak eater/lover, so the sides were what kept me happy. Omg the cheese bread is amazing!!! It had a glutinous feel to it that reminded me of mochi. The garlic mashed potatoes, polenta fries, and plantains were divine! They were so good that I got pretty upset when one of the busboys took our plates away before I got to finish the last few bites. He didn't ask if we were still working on them :( I knew I could've ordered more, but I also knew that my stomach couldn't handle it... but then I also tried their squash soup. I really enjoyed this. The flavor was light, but it was a nice change from all the salty food. \n\nAt the end of our meal, I was in pain, haha. Overall, it was a cool experience. However, I think they should cap reservations at a certain number. I didn't get to bed until 1am on a weeknight!

I have literally driven an hour away sometimes just to go to one.  One that I frequent at least twice a year is Fogo De Chao.  I usually take friends to Fogo as I rant and rave about it.  Tonight Fogo really let me down in every single part of the night.  \n\nFirst let's start with getting seated.  I made a reservation for 7:30 for just a table of 1.  I know I could have ate at the bar, but I sometimes enjoy just siting at a table.  I arrived about 10 minutes early, gave my name and they said they would seat me soon.  I waited over 20 minutes to be seated.  What bothered me is when they walked me to my table was that there were plenty of open 2 seater tables.  I just think they wanted to seat the big groups before just me.  I was not going to let this bother me.\n\nI sit down and the waitress comes over and introduces herself.  She tells me she is in training and pretty new.  I let her know I had been here before and she did not really need to go over everything.  When I went to order a Brazilian lemonade she gave me a blank stare and started to ask if I wanted about 10 other drinks.  \n\nThe salad bar is nice but poorly labeled.  I usually get very little from the salad bar.  But compared to Fogo's in Chicago, Orlando, ATL or other cities it was for sure lacking.  \n\nThe meat selection was strange here.  Usually you are bombarded with meats but here they pace it out.  Sometimes it was about 5 minutes before another came.  One thing they do here is give you large chunks of meat.  The meats were a little cold and not hot like others.  It was really strange.  Also some of the meats only came around once in the hour I was there.  \n\nSo usually I do not complain about drinks but tonight they told me they ran out of lemonade and it would be a few minutes cause they needed to make more.  A few minutes turned into over 10 minutes.  Then they bring it out without a straw.  Also the girl training asks if I want more brea,I said yes, no bread for 15 minutes, it's not till I remind her and she still does not go get she asks someone to do it.  Final thing I asked if I could just get a side of mashed potatoes twice and never once during the meal did I get them... \n\nI usually do not complain this much but it was a really bad experience.  I understand you are training, but whomever is tearing you is doing it wrong.  This is by far the worst Fogo experience I have had and it's pretty sad.", "author": "Matthew L."}

First of all getting here can be a pain. You can take the Bart or you can pay for parking. We found a garage nearby that was relatively cheap ($2/hr?)\n\nThe host at the front was very kind. I had to modify our reservations and apparently when I did that I also switched the dates on accident. We came on a Saturday around 4pm and luckily the place was 80% empty so the host accommodated us. This place has a ton of offerings outside the bbq. There's a feijoada bar, a soup of the day (asparagus & split pea), a sauce bar, and a salad bar that had everything from pickles to smoked salmon to various cheeses. They also provide you with starchy items to fill you up. Now this is where my problem lies. I wanted to save my stomach for meat to get my money's worth but in all honesty the tastiest items were their side dishes.\n\nThe #1 thing at this restaurant was definitely their pao de queijo. It is a gummy, cheesy, buttery piece of heavenly carboliciousness and I probably ate 8 and that's with \"self control\". I've had pao de queijo before and maybe it's cause these are constantly being pumped out so they're warm but I would almost come back just for this.\n\nOther side dishes worth getting were the Spanish chorizo, smoked salmon, and cheeses. None of them were the highest quality but they were tasty enough if you needed a meat break. Their various salads were also good especially the ones dressed in vinegar which really helps cut through the saltiness of the meat. They also brought out some mashed potatoes, fried plantains, and polenta fries. The polenta fries were stale and a hard pass. The fried plantains offered some sweetness which was nice between meats. The mashed potatoes were straightforward but quite creamy and delicious. We tried a bit of the soup which was very flavorful though we passed on the feijoada bar because I knew it would fill me up too much.\n\nAs for the meat, well I'm hoping we just came on a bad day. One of the biggest issues was that since the restaurant was so empty we were constantly getting repeat items and or the first cut of a new stick which meant a lot of our pieces were too salty or too well done (I'm a medium rare/rare kinda girl). Some of the items we tried included the prime sirloin, bottom sirloin, bacon wrapped bottom sirloin, ribeye, leg of lamb, and a second batch of prime sirloin. The plain bottom sirloin was just straight up bad. Chewy, flavorless, and a disrespectful tribute to the cow. The bacon wrapped one on the other hand did help. Personally my favorite was the ribeye and the leg of lamb which was a bit salty but still delicious.\n\nMy group including myself tapped out fairly early before hitting our money's worth. We weren't super full versus the amount of salt from eating the exterior portions of the meat were really getting to us.\n\nOne of the positives of this restaurant that will keep my coming back once I undergo the surgery myself is that they do seem to have a discount for bariatric patients if you bring proof of the surgery which is nice. Overall, I did enjoy my experience here. I don't know if it's quite worth the weekend pricing but it was nice to have the variety. Honestly my favorite thing here was the cheese bread and I will most certainly be back for more of it.\n\n---The Re-return item: Pao de Queijo---", "author": "Vivian C."}

I wanted to save this place for a special occasion, so me and my bf decided to come here for our 3 year anniversary. I was anxious because my boyfriend can't eat pork or beef. While I was being offered lots of red meat, my bf had to wait for chicken or lamb. I thought he wouldn't enjoy it because there was little that he could eat, but he said that he would return again, surprisingly! \n\nI read online that there would be seafood, but I guess it's not the type you expect that would be cooked. I believe they are located at the Market Table. I didn't see them probably because they were camouflaged in with the veggies lol. \n\nThere is unlimited cheese rolls, which is my faveeeee! They bring out a small dish of mashed potatoes, plantains, and polenta. You can always request more if you run out.\n\nThe service was impeccable! We were asked many times if there was anything we needed and how our night was going. When I asked if I could get well done/medium on my meats, they kindly reassured me that they would come back when one was available, which they did! I was surprised they remembered to come back because even I forgot I had requested it. One of the waitresses? offered us a free dessert because it was our anniversary. She was really cool and mentioned that there was a sweepstakes going on. When I got home and entered, I received $100 off of dining experience the next time I come in! \n\nFor the price of $62 a person, unlimited meats and appetizers, I would definitely come back!

I decided to go this time because it was only a couple blocks away from where I had my Swedish massage. \n\nThe meats were delicious. Some tasted better than others. It was hard to keep them all straight but I think the beefs were far better than any of the pork or chicken I had. The best of the beefs, and the best meat I had in general, was the picanha.  It was SOO good. The only problem is that it comes out so slowly.  Each piece is seasoned, roasted on one side and cut thinly.  The weight has 4-5 big pieces of meat on his skewer that each have 2 sides that are seasoned and roasted. The waiter cuts off one thin slice and that is all the waiter can cut from that side before he has to go back into the kitchen to have the entire skewer re-seasoned and roasted.  This means the waiter only has about 8-10 slices each time he comes out.  I spent a lot of time saying no to everything else while waiting from this one waiter to come back over and over again. \n\nThe buffet area was okay.  The array of lettuce and salads could have been chopped more finely.  I had a huge salad made of a couple pieces of kale, lettuce and some arugula. The other items were okay. I wouldn't waste my time over there tbh. \n\nThe complimentary things they give you include cheesy bread which I thought tasted like cheese-its, fried plantains which were okay, these cooked bananas which I enjoyed and mashed potatoes which were also good.  \n\nFor dessert we had the molten chocolate cake which comes with a scoop of ice cream.  It was more like a bundt cake that was light and airy that had some warm chocolate ganache in the center.  It was good but I was hoping for a dense thick chocolate cake like at mulvaney's in Sacramento. \n\nThe service was as expected.  I had reservations but still had to wait like 15 minutes to be seated. That was upsetting. The place is dim. Some people were dressed up. One lady had a black dress with wings on.  I'm not even kidding.  She had black feathery wings on that looked like a super high collar.  \n\nTL/DR: great restaurant. Food is delicious. The picanha is definitely the best.  Some meats I would avoid. I'd definitely come back and recommend this place.", "author": "Jon P."}

I can't remember our servers name but if you're reading this sir, it's your bffs from Modesto.  \n\nWe made reservations for 6:30 on a Thursday, when we arrived it was pretty empty. However, when we were leaving around 8 pm, the line was almost out the door. \n\nThis was my first churrascoria (not sure if I spelt that right) experience and honestly was a bit overwhelmed at first. Two meat guys came out and another server came out with sides and another with drinks, literally all at the same time, I thought I was going to have a mental breakdown. But thankfully they all slowed the pace down a bit. \n\nAgain, first time here and made the mistake of filling up at the market place. Do not do this! Get your moneys worth of meat. Now on to the meat....*wipes drool off phone screen* Absolutely amazing. There were definitely some cuts that I didn't care too much for and some were just amazing. Favorite was the picanha and ribs, which you have to ask for. For the most part, the meat is more on the medium/rare side, but my sister has to have well done. She told one of the meat guys (I'm sorry idk what they're called) that she prefers well done and I'm pretty sure he told the rest of the meat guys that she only eats well done. Because next thing we know, they're coming to her with \"would you like a well done piece?\" and \"you only eat well done right?\" It was a small gesture, but very appreciated and attentive. \n\nTowards the end of our meal, the manager (I'm assuming he was the manager or owner) came out and talked to us and made sure we enjoyed our meal.

This particular one is a good $10 more for dinner than our local Fogo, and they seemed to have less meat options, which was surprising.\n\nWe got here here for dinner around 6:30pm and meat came out very slowly. Apparently, this is their transition time and they're still grilling. Anyway, speed quickly ramped up and soon enough, we were inundated with meat. The salad bar had all the usual suspects, and we loved that they had a separate condiment bar with different sauces. Favorites were the ribeye and the picanha with the crispy ends. So good.\n\nThe downside to our meal was being seated next to a family with a small child who was throwing food EVERYWHERE and screaming. Like, come on. Control your kid or don't go out. It was super unappetizing to say the least. \n\nWe really wanted papaya cream for dessert, but it's still off the menu due to e.coli concerns, so we went with the strawberry cream, which isn't nearly as good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-04-26", "description": "I am ashamed to say that I have never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse before my visit this past Sunday to Fogo de Chao and I cannot believe I have been missing out on this for 24 years. I was hesitant as I really cannot eat THAT much meat but after a 12 mile run, this sounded like a great brunch to refuel. I made a reservation for A and I for 12PM on Sunday and am glad we did. Fogo de Chao's brunch is cheaper ($44.95) than dinner, has a lot of meat coming around and some special brunch dishes like hashes. Plus, it is so much easier to have a huge meal as your first meal of the day and have time to digest than to have it late at night and go to sleep.\n\nWe arrived on time for our reservation and were sat within 5 minutes. The first thing I noticed was how LARGE this restaurant is by San Francisco standards. They clearly are going after businesses/the convention crowd at nearby Moscone. This outpost of Fogo is fairly new (~1 year I think) and it is absolutely beautiful on the inside and feels upscale without being uptight. On the way to our table, the host explained all about Fogo and the \"concept\" with the market table and the gauchos coming around the goods. We took a look at the drink menu, decided to just stick with water and headed to the market table.\n\nNow, A has been to Fogo before in Chicago and gave me a pep talk before we went in on not filling up at the salad bar/on sides because he knows me too well. Before seeing the market table, i just thought it was going to be some sad lettuce and dole fruit but oh my god it was the place of veggie dreams! They have both salad ingredients and composed salads as well as nice fruit (think berries, kiwi, watermelon), cheese, meats and a ton of other things. Really, I would not begrudge ANYONE for doing just the market table option as I think you could make a super nice meal on just this. Anyways, priming myself for the meat fest about to happen, I just took some veggies, some cheese and some of the brunch hash and went back to the table only to find that we suddenly had sides! \n\nThe sides at Fogo during brunch are the Pao de Quejo, fried plantains, yucca fries and mashed potatoes. I literally could not stop eating the plantains. I love plantains and these were phenomenal. The Pao de Quejo were delicious as well and you know I love myself some yucca fries. The mashed potatoes were good but since I had to save stomach real estate, I decided to leave these.\n\nAll of this would have been a feast in and of itself but then they started coming around with the MEAT. Oh my god so much meat. I don't remember everything we tried (they give you small cuts which is good) but some key delicious items: the chicken breast, lamb chops, filet mignon and short ribs. My one complaint is that the variety during the first ~30 minutes we were there was not high and the gauchos kept coming around with the same 5 things. It was only after a bit that we started to see some more variety. I understand this has to do with how the kitchen can prepare the large quantities so I guess it is par for the course. Another minor note is that I found some of the meat, especially the steak, to be a bit salty. I am pretty sensitive to salty foods so I just happened to notice but I assume the average person would not care that much.\n\nA younger version of us would have eaten to excess and felt terrible. Luckily, A and I are out of our gorging phase so we were able to get the check when we were comfortably full. I do think we ate quite a bit of different foods so I feel like the price was worth it. I really enjoyed the experience and had a lot of fun. I would love to come back but would probably need a reason or occasion as its a bit expensive for a random meal.

We asked one of the waiters to take our photo...he reluctantly did so (didn't seem to friendly about it) then we asked if we could order coffee and he turned his back to us and told us to wait. \nWaiting was no issue, but he never got someone to take our coffee order.

There was a good variety of sauces as well for dipping the meats into. The complimentary fried polentas, caramelizad bananas, Brazilian bread (basically cheese puffs), and mashed potatoes were delicious! \n\nThe meats overall were quite good, but some were just way too salty. The top sirloin was especially salty-- I couldn't eat it anymore after taking a bite. The chicken legs were too salty too, unfortunately. The Parmesan pork was so dry that I had to dip it into a bunch fo sauce-- I wouldn't recommend getting that at all. \n\nI have to admit, it was overwhelming when a bunch of servers came with the skewers in the beginning. It slowed down a lot after about 10 minutes, and it became difficult to get any more meat after that. Some of my friends clearly still had their cards on \"green\", and wanted more meat, but nobody came around. They had to explicitly ask for more, but they were able to tell them specifically how they would like them cooked, which was nice (it took a long time for them to receive them though).

The place looked empty initially but seemed to fill up within the next 30min or so. It seemed they were serving meat that has been cooking too long or perhaps meat that was leftover from the day before. The meat initially was near welldone and a bit chewy; even their filet mignon. \n\nOnce the place started filling up, there was almost an immediate change in their food quality. Suddenly, the meats were properly cooked and no longer dry and chewy. Also more variety of meats (e.g. ribs, drumsticks, and even picanha) started to come out vs when we first arrived. \n\nWe were eventually asked about 3 separate times if we had any special request from the kitchen. Each time they asked, we did mention something we'd like from the kitchen but they failed to bring out anything we requested all 3 times. \n\nTowards the end of our meal, we already marked out tables red (no more meat)  and have been waiting about 15min for our check. It took me about 4 times to flag down our server to which on the 4th time, I literally had to say \"Excuse me!\" with my hand waving to catch his attention. I felt rude having to do that but the typical raising my hand while he was in eyesight wasn't working. He eventually blamed it being a holiday (MLK Day) to why he was so busy. I don't think he noticed I saw him chatting with his coworkers. \n\nOverall, I had better experiences at another location (LA) and was hugely disappointed by this specific establishment. To those readers thinking it's not that bad and I probably just came at a wrong time: dining at a place like this shouldn't require to catch them at a \"good time\".

Came in, checked in, and the reception said that tables would be ready soon. We still didn't get updates at around 7:15, so I checked again, and this time, I got a buzzer. We were then seated within 5 minutes, and one of our servers greeted us and the fun started!\n\nThe salad bar had a bunch of options. I really enjoyed the watermelon and candied bacon. I got quite a bit of smoked salmon but found it too salty. \n\nRight after coming back from the salad bar, the meats came nonstop! I think I tried all of the steaks and enjoyed every single one of them, my favorite being the filet mignon. The seasoning was simple, yet just perfectly lightly salted and spiced. One complaint was that they really \"front-loaded\" us with food. Everything came within 10-15 minutes, and since they all looked delicious and I was afraid that that type of meat wouldn't come back again in time, I couldn't say no. Not sure if it just happened to be where we were sitting, but because of that, I was stuffed within 20 minutes. Different meats, such as pork chops and bacon wrapped chicken came around, but I was too full to try that.\n\nI had a bit of room for other appetizers that they brought out and really enjoyed the special bread, caramelized bananas, and polenta.\n\nI was slightly confused about whether or not dessert was provided, since for restaurant week, they advertised $65/person including dessert, but when I asked about it, the server told me that dessert would cost additional. It ended up being $62/person without dessert pre-tax and tip. Very very pricey! I'm not sure if it's worth the price, but if you want a tasty meal in a nice atmosphere and don't mind dropping $70+ on a meal, this is a good option.", "author": "Erica T."}

Lots of meats to choose from...my favs are the picanha (prime top sirloin), alcatra (top sirloin), the lamb chops (not game-y and bonus is they're super flavorful). Even though I typically do enjoy filet mignon, at Brazilian steak places, I think the other meats are better in terms of both flavor and texture. \n\nMy favs out of the salad bar are the mozzarella balls.

Table side they also service warm cheese bread (gluten free chewy biscuits), mashed potatoes, yuca fries. The food is definitely fresh and the place has an upscale feeling, very clean.

We found Fogo de Chao on Yelp and decided to head there. We've eaten at Fogo in Las Vegas and enjoyed that experience and we wanted to see how Fogo in SF would compare to Espetus. \n\nWe were greeted and seated as soon as we walked in. Directly behind the Host/Hostess podium is a wall and behind that is a quad seating arrangement that is four two-tops with padded bench seating. Imagine looking at a plus-sign from above and put seating along each side. \n\nA server came by, took our drink order and explained the dining concept to us. We went and got food and returned to our table. Then another couple was seated opposite of us. When they sat down, our benches popped up as if we were on a teeter-totter. They asked for another table and the Host showed the  Restaurant Manager the instability of the bench. We also mentioned it. She asked if we wanted to move and I said that if no one else would be seated, we were fine. She replied that no one else would be seated at our \"quad\".\n\nUnfortunately, there was no host/hostess working later that evening and with different servers sharing the responsibility, the message was not passed along and the \"quad\" was filled up. Every time someone sat down, everyone else bounced up. \n\nAfter a bit, i got annoyed enough that I lost my desire to eat. I asked for the manager and explained that had I known that others would be seated at our quad, we would have taken her up on her offer to move us earlier on. She was pleasant, apologized and did not make excuses. Her concern was that we give the restaurant another chance. Her professionalism and attitude took this review back up to three stars from one.\n\nThe food was good. The salad bar had an extensive selection of yummies to choose from. The hot bar was not as successful as it only offered three dishes, Feijoada, White Rice and Carrot Ginger Soup. Every other Churrascaria that we've been to has had more to offer in hot dishes such as a Seafood Stew. We only tried 6 different meats that were presented: Bacon Wrapped Filet, Garlic Rib Eye, Beef Tenderloin, Brazilian Sausage, Sirloin, House Marinated Pork Ribs.  \n\nAll in all, not a bad experience and we'll return with the expectation of a better experience somewhere down the road.", "author": "Dexter D."}

Complimentary dessert for birthdays!\n\nMet the manager last year, and she actually remembered us! Great service from all the staff. One of the hosts caught me gawking at the plate of garlic shrimp that he was delivering to another table and actually came back around to our table to introduce their seafood specials. He was very attentive throughout the rest of the night and gave us TWO complimentary desserts because Boyfriend had stepped out when he brought over the first dessert. So when Boyfriend came back, the host popped up with a different dessert with the candle and everything. Needless to say, I LOVED the service.\n\nAlso LOVED their fruity Caipirinha cocktails - the Strawberry Hibiscus and Passionate were my favorites! I like the drinks that sneak up on you and get you tipsy before you realize it. Could barely taste the alcohol behind the strawberry and passionfruit flavors. Super pricey, but not unexpected.\n\nThe salad bar was also nice. Fresh - not tons of options, but you don't really go to a churrascaria for their salad bar. And if you do, you might be doing it wrong...\n\nI would actually give the meat maybe 3 stars though. I take my meat medium-rare. But the meat that came out was often medium to well, so we'd have to wait for the next round of the same meat. But the gauchos don't always serve the same meat on their swords so the next gaucho may not know you were waiting on medium-rare. Sometimes, our medium-rare was actually super rare - like a deep red, almost brown, color.\n\nI REALLY wish they had grilled pineapple though. They do have Caramelized Pineapple as a dessert, but it's not the same. It's only slightly caramelized. And somehow, this last time we got the pineapple, it was an inch thick so it was hard to cut/eat. But the first time we had it, it was much thinner. The Tres Leches Cake is ALWAYS delicious though.

Do not be deceived by their overall 4 stars because I don't even understand how they got those. If I could give this place a 0.5 stars, I WOULD!\n\nI made a reservation for a party of 11. We're familiar with Brazilian Steakhouses, but perhaps this one was slightly different. This is our first time at Fogo, so our waitress explains how things work. Water is given to every  member of my table, but after that is where my night goes downhill. There should never be an excuse for being unable to serve your customers with the same amount of service as other tables. This place is bias and unorganized beyond imagination. It's like everyone has their own agendas and ideas of customer service. Let's see what went wrong tonight during my service: \n\n1. They don't know how to automatically refill your empty water glass. My family sat there feeling like overly dried prunes after eating their overly salty meats and drinking all of our water. Even when the waiters clear your plates, they don't know how to be observant of their surroundings and immediately scurry to the kitchen with the mountain of dirty plates. We had to flag down another waitress (not OUR waitress) for water. At least she immediately returned with water refills. If you want to have salt poisoning, please come here.\n\n2. If your waitress spends more time at the table full of tipsy, sociable males, you know you  are going to be forgotten. This unapologetic, pathetic excuse of a waitress. I see this woman talking to this table more than she provided my table service. Every time they are finished chattering, you would expect to be given some form of customer service. Don't push your luck. This waitress just walks away despite me trying to catch her attention to ask if our chicken hearts are coming soon! Lady, if you want a break, go tell your manager so you can go rest in the back instead of letting your customers watch you \"servicing\" the table full of males and fully ignoring the people that actually need something from you. Inattentive service killed our experience here. \n\n3. I waited for MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR for two special items. They have a \"special menu\" that requires you to order personally from a waiter. I ordered the beef ribs and chicken hearts. My family waited.... and waited... can't wait any longer! We flag down the 1st person and they said 7 minutes. Waiting.... Flag the 2nd person and they said \"Oh those take 15 minutes!\" Ok great we wait... Flag the 3rd person and they say \"Oh it'll be right out and we will have it brought to your table!\" Wonderful this place is so full of empty promises and lies that the next part ruined my entire dinner experience. When my family saw the chicken hearts, we were all excited and thinking \"finally we can finish our meal!\" We watched the chicken hearts go to the table of 10 males that were seated 10 minutes AFTER we were seated. This is ridiculous we ordered these hearts before their whole party even arrived. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN!!! We expressed our frustration to our \"flirting\" waitress and she gives me a BS excuse that they ordered it longggg before we did. Your service is so full of unjustified excuses that you can stick your pride and excuses on one of those skewer because I didn't need your \"I did nothing wrong\" attitude. This place is NEVER WRONG APPARENTLY because they don't know what customer service is. \n\nThe rest of my review is in the pictures since I went over the limit.

We were not introduced to our table until 7:50. So here we are waiting for the waiter, he came over and asked us what we wanted to drink. We ordered 2 glasses of water and a bottle of Pinot Grigio. 20 minutes passed we asked the waiter where our wine bottle was?....his response was  \"we are getting the wine bottle for you\"......So, after about another ten minutes we told him to cancel the order for the wine since it never even made its way to our table. \n\nWhat else is wrong with my experience? \n\nSecondly, the meat here is mediocre compared to Espetus. They only have about 6 meat choices. Not only that!!! The bacon wrapped chicken was hard and dry! The prime rib was pretty good but, the overall experience made me lose my appetite. The waiter also checked in on us once... so pretty much I went thirsty no water left in my cup for about half the time I spent here. \n\nI would think that with the location of this restaurant they would be more up to par.

Salad bar is pretty decent, they have salads, fruits, smoked salmon, soup and other small veggie dishes/salads. However with the amount of all you can eat steak, chicken, rib eye and other meats you get, you won't be visiting the salad bar much. Meats were a hit or miss, some were kind of dry and some were decent, however I bit oversalted. You get a card that is green and red. Green means you want more meat and red means you are OK for now. Service of the meats bringing to our table was TOO fast, literally I felt every second someone was coming up to me asking if I wanted meat, I felt they could of timed it better.

Compared to Espetus Brazllian Steakhouse, the food is on par with their rival, but there are a few choices that fall short. Additionally Fogo de Chao doesn't have the shrimp and warm pineapple on their menu. Unfortunately its not the food that scares me, it is the training of the staff and management that worries me. \n\nI came here for a birthday lunch with my girlfriend and everything went well initially. Food was good and service was attentive. As we were leaving the restaurant after our meal, my girlfriend broke down crying because she had arranged for a birthday dessert with our waiter (while I was in the bathroom mid-meal), and the waitstaff had dropped the ball and forgotten all about her special request. I called the restaurant and talked with management about our incident. The female manager offered to get us back in for a complimentary meal and we scheduled a future date. \n\nA day before our scheduled comp meal, a male manager called me to verify our arrival for our reservation. Night of our reservation, we checked in with the hostess and were shown our table. Everything went well with the food and service. At the end of the meal, we were presented with a bill that included 2 full-price adult meals. I told our waiter that my meal was supposed to be comped but he told me there was no record of this with the staff. I had to name-drop the names of the two managers I had spoken to, and that still took 5-10 minutes to verify and clear up my bill. I thought the whole experience was embarrassing. What was supposed to be a nice romantic dinner turned out to be an ordeal afterwards. Interesting fact was that the same female manager called me two days later to set up another complimentary dinner because she thought I didn't go to my initial comp dinner. Clearly there is no evidence of communication between the managers and the wait staff. \n\nMy third and final visit here: I brought my whole family and a few friends (group of 9) for my brother's birthday dinner. While the food was good, quality service was severely lacking. There weren't too many rounds of meats brought around and we had to ask repeatedly for special requests. Water and drinks weren't refilled often too. As we approached the end of our meal, we waited and waited for our check to arrive. Despite the last round of meat making its round 40 minutes ago, nobody brought our table the bill. Not seeing a single waiter/waitress around, we decided to get up and and settle our bill on our way out. We saw our main waiter folding napkins on our way out and he just wished us a good night. We told him that we hadn't received our bill and boyyyyyy was he shocked. Had we not been honest people, we would have gotten away with a $900 bill. \n\nI like Fogo de Chao and have enjoyed a number of their other locations.

Our waitress came by the first time letting us know how Fogo de Chao works and said she would be back with water.

Another server dropped by with the cheesy bread and plantains and said nothing when he dropped it off so we really had little idea of what it was as well. Once more people were seated servers were asking them how they were doing and showing much more service too. All the others were older than us but then again that should be no reason for the service we were given.\n\nIt took us 15 minutes to flag a server down to get a bill which did not happen and we had to flag another one who came and apologized for being packed which was no excuse.

Our waiter seemed to be preoccupied or just simply clueless.  He approached our group and asked \"have you been here before?\"  We all replied no!

She did her best, but much of the damaged had already been done, thanks to her coworker.\n\nOk so, the meat guys were not on their A-game either.  I watched the same three men come to our table multiple times with the same selections of meat over and over again.  Garlic steak, bacon wrapped chicken breast, and New York strip. The pork rib guy stopped at our table one time and toward the very end of our night, the lamb chop guy showed up!  Btw- everyone's plates had already been cleared from the table.  What happened to all the other meats?\n\nThe staff certainly need to be retrained and the Dining room manager should pay closer attention to what's going on in the dining room.

That meant we were get first dibs at all meat that came out.\n\nLike any Brazilian Steakhouse, there is a dial that you keep at your table. Green = keep it coming, Red = stop. While waiting for the meats to come out, there is cheesy bread, garlic mashed potatoes, and fried polenta at your table. You can also opt to try one of the many options at the salad bar. Try not to load up on too much of that and save room for the beef ribs, the star of the show. \n\nTwo waiters came by to take our drink order (there was some confusion I guess) We did get our drinks promptly and water refilled often. Remember how I said you shouldn't load up at the salad bar? If you had to choose wisely, definitely get some of the cold cuts: prosciutto, salami, salmon, and the cheeses. Stay away from the other stuff unless you want to waste away your appetite. I asked for those beef ribs and they already had one cooking in the kitchen. By the time I came back from the salad bar, it was out and I was ready. I should have asked for seconds as this was quickly depleted and the only thing left were the bones... There's a great selection of meats but the sirloin came around way too often. Definitely get the bacon wrapped fillet (because who turns down bacon?) The ribeye was another big hit.

Food's delicious, but on my third outing, here's something I've come to learn.\n\nThe Brazilian steakhouse experience is pretty fun, but when the novelty wore off, I found it to be a little tiresome. They give you an 'on/off' button to indicate whether you want a server to come to you; leave the button on green, and servers will come serving you a variety of choice meats, turn it off and they don't. Pretty smart and simple.\n\nMy only issue with this is that, like a lot of people, I ordinarily get myself a full plate of food, enjoy it at my own leisure, and then get more food when I finish. With the system at Fogo, I get spammed with servers providing one slice of meat at a time, so I have to keep my button on green until I get enough food to my liking, and throughout this whole process, I can't have a conversation because servers keep coming up to you with whom you have to address. If they just did it in a way that I wouldn't have to refocus my attention on them, then this would not be an issue, but each server has a different meat selection so you must tell them if you want that choice meat or not.\n\nI went as a party of two, I imagine this scenario would be less tiresome with a larger company.

All the meats that came our way was extremely delicious, savory and mouth-watering. \n\nMy issue was more so with our server who just always seemed to miss the mark when it came to my requests. As a result, I had to take out one star because I started to get irritated and flustered asking for anything. I asked for the Limeade (which by the way is delicious! Tangy and not overly sweet). I had to ask 3 times before they finally brought it out. Then I asked for the polenta fries and plantains... they said it was coming out AND it never did. I had to ask someone else who wasn't even our waiter for a plate and he brought it out! When our actual server came back again, I literally said to myself, \"Oh God. Do I even attempt to ask for dessert?\"  Sure enough, I indicated I wanted the Brazilian Flan which he acknowledged but the only desserts that came out was everyone else's but mine. I had to ask another server to bring me it and they did. \n\nSo all-in-all, it was a good place and I do look forward to coming here in the future.

The first time was a 5* experience... servers kept coming around so often that I actually had to flip over the button to red so they wouldn't keep serving all the delicious meat. My friend and I also scoffed at my friend who was \"wasting room\" on the cheesy brazilian bread (I wound up eating 4 pieces of it and we asked for two extra baskets.)\n\nThe second time was a 4* experience. A little less variety of meat, but still pretty attentive and lots of options. My parents who had never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse enjoyed it and spoke well of it.\n\nThe third (and most recent) time, it was a 3* experience. I had family visiting over the holidays and for our table of 13, it felt like we had no service! Our server kept talking to other people and averting his gaze whenever he came near us. It kinda seemed like he was drunk actually. The meat options were the smallest variety I had seen (where's the chicken, and all the different beef options? I know that chicken isn't really what one's going for but their chicken was soooo gooood that I was bummed it wasn't offered). The redeeming qualities were the cheesy  Brazilian bread and a server who wasn't our main server, but someone who was attentive and helpful... taking photos, bringing horseradish, etc. \n\nIt's great for groups (easy to book) and would visit again, but the last visit left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth because it was the largest group and we spent the most money that time... only to have the worst experience. \n\nStill fun, but just not as good as the first two times", "author": "Sam W."}

Nicely decorated and designed restaurant, comfortable and actually decent for conversation without having to yell.  Came with a group of friends and really enjoyed the entire experience.\n\nFirst off, the service is very efficient, friendly, and professional.  You can tell they have been trained well and do whatever necessary to accommodate a request.  With so many 'goucho' meat servers running about it is quite well orchestrated.  If you have your card up to signal 'green' some type of meat will instantaneously appear.  The servers are careful to cater to the diner's particular taste and level of how done the meat is cooked. I had a difficult time following all the varieties but really ventured to try several.  All were delciious and succulent cuts, except for the sausage that I found a bit bland, dry and with a tough hard skin.  Some cuts were a bit fatty at the edges but that was good too.\nIt is quite the show to watch the gouchos running about serving tables.\n\nWhat impressed me was how courteous the servers were when confronted with a patron heading somewhere in their driect path of travel.  They always step aside and let the diner pass, with a gracious attitude about it.  Nice.  Here they are holding a metal plate with an enormous skewer of meat and yet do not get in the way of putting the patron first.\n\nThe 'Market Table' where you start your meal is an adventure in itself.  So many different choices of salads, veggies, cheese, marinated this and that and on and on.  Yes, even quail eggs.  It was fun to just explore and try a variety or things.  There is also a feijoada on a side table where you can scoop rice and the bean and meat stew combo, with some touches on the side (including a firey red sauce).  My impression is that it's good but no where near the quality and taste of what you get in Brazil.  \nAlso as others have commented they do run low or out of dishes that unfortunately sit baren; but still enough variety to satisfy.\n\nThe wine list was good and several Malbecs, as one would expect, and go well with the food.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the experience, and I must say it 's probably best with a group.", "author": "Tom B."}

Fortunately, the sommelier stepped in and helped me choose something, but unfortunately, the wine was terrible and we didn't even finish the first glasses poured for us. The bottle just sat there.\n\nThis is a fine establishment, though. Seeing our bottle sitting idly, a man I believe may have been the maitre d' approached us with an apology and two vouchers for $20 off our next visit.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-05", "description": "My first Brazilian churrasco steakhouse experience was at Fogo de Chao in Washington, DC. about ten years ago and was impressed with the meal and the overall experience. Since then, I've tried several churrascos in the Bay Area but they did not remind me of the Fogo experience.\n\nThen I was excited to hear that Fogo had opened a restaurant in San Francisco at 3rd and Howard in the former Chevy's location.  Fogo has a higher-end ambiance than their counterparts and this location has two dining sections and a bar separating the two. With the Churrasco meal, you get to enjoy their impressive Market Table, which is full of fresh and flavorful ingredients and recipes that are traditional & natural staples of Southern Brazilian cuisine including salads, smoke salmon, charcuterie of cured meats and cheeses, antipasti, fruits and vegetables. There's also Fogo Feijoada, a traditional black bean stew with sausage that you serve over white rice.  But remember the highlight of the meal is the churrasco, so don't overindulge from the Market Table.\n\nThe churrasco features 6 cuts of beef: Prime part of the top sirloin, tenderloin, top sirloin, bottom sirloin, rib eye and beef ribs; a bacon-wrapped steak, leg of lamb, rack of lamb, pork fillets, pork ribs, pork chops, sausage and a bacon-wrapped chicken.  The gauchos come around with a skewer of one of the meat items and will stop at your table if you have your disc on the Green \"Yes, Please\" side. The gaucho will slice a piece of beef cooked to your liking and you will grab it with your tongs. Turn the disc to Red \"No, Thanks\" to pause the visits from the gauchos. My favorites were the rib eye, prime top sirloin and the beef ribs. There are sauces for your meats such as   homemade hot sauce, Chimichurri, Horseradish sauce, and mint jelly.  With your churrasco meal, you also get a basket of Farofa cheese biscuits, polenta, garlic mashed potatoes, and caramelized bananas.  Ask your server for the listing of the meats served for the churrasco as a reference.  If you are waiting for a certain meat and the gaucho hasn't come by, ask the server and they will let the gaucho know and they will make sure they will stop by your table.  They do offer a Mango Chilean Sea Bass entr\u00e9e for those non-meat eaters.  \n\nThe Churrasco dinner is $61.95, but sign up on Fogo's eClub and you will get $25 coupons to apply to the cost of your meal.  A good deal! On your birthday, they offer a complementary dessert of your choice. \n\nFogo is still as good and memorable as my first experience ten years ago.  A delicious churrasco meal in a nice ambiance with friendly service.  Fogo will be my favorite churrasco restaurant.", "author": "Al L."}

That phrase worked better in my head, but seriously, when you're here, you seriously chow down and eat to your heart's pleasure. Yea, theres a lot of Brazilian places such as Espetus or Cleos that offers more meat options and slsad bar choices, but Fogo de Chao is great at offering just the right amount of tasty meat/sides without overbearing you!! \n\nTo start, for about $57+ per person, you really need to make sure you have an appetite (12 options of meat, a hot sides bar, and a salad bar). To be honest, a good amount of the meat is salty, so I highly suggest having a good amount of salad, rice, and an alcoholic drink to help you rinse it all down. The chicken hearts, garlic sirlion, bacon wrapped chicken, and the filet mignon are a must have. Not all meats will be passed around, but feel free to ask your servers for anything particular! Pair em meats with the complimentary mashed potatoes and yuca and you are set! \n\nOverall, the service and overall ambiance of Fogo de Chao makes it the top notch place it is. I wouldn't say it is the most amazing Brazilian Steakhouse, but this is a great place for special occasions or a TREAT YOSELF kind of day.

Then when you are seated, you flip a coaster if you would like some meet. Then, they do rounds when they go around tables checking flipped coasters, after which, they serve you a piece or two.\n\nAnd it keeps going until you decide you are done. I really enjoyed the place, but thing that I'm not giving it 5 stars is because we have made a reservation weeks before, but ended up getting an outside sitting area. Well, not a biggie. But, our first table had a stability issue, so we had to ask to be switched elsewhere. It is their job to check on tables at least. \n\nThen drinks were a little slow.

The cheese bread though, I love that I can't taste the cheese and reminds me of a teeny tiny popover.  The mashed potatoes, plantains, and polenta fries were all tasty, don't make the rookie mistake of filling up on the sides or the beautiful salad bar!\n\nShout out to our servers Alfredo & Amanda; however, the server extraordinaire of the evening was fabulously Southern Stuart, who was upselling shrimp cocktail to Cognac.  I was expecting cigars next...good LAWD!  If you've missed him the first time, he'll be sure to come around.  Don't be tempted, there's no pressure.  Over the years, I've only dined at Espetus (both SF & San Mateo locations).  They don't have an upsell guy/gal coming around, and their desserts are more satisfying.  Fogo's desserts are way too sweet - got milk?  \n\nI wouldn't dine here often, only for special occasions.  I'm definitely coming back for the happy hour.  Sign up for their EClub to receive coupons.  Valet parking is $20, plenty of street parking after 6pm and nearby lots.  There's a coat check and space for luggage; I saw numerous people come in with their rolling suitcases.  Green means go, red means \"no mas\".

Not sure why it took so long for Fogo de Ch\u00e3o to open up a location in San Francisco, but I am glad that they did since now I can get my carne-carnival fix on without having to go to Man Jose.  \n\nSure there are other churrascarias in town, but I have always felt Fogo de Ch\u00e3o was the best, making me forego the chow at their rivals. If you have never been to a churrascaria, it is an AYCE experience where ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9 gauchos literally carry around skewers of barbecued meat around to your table and you have the option of saying yes (sim) or no (n\u00e3o). \n\nIn terms of value, I would recommend coming during their weekday lunch where you get the most bang for your buck at $36.95. This includes the salad bar and pretty much all of their cuts of meat. More importantly, Fogo de Ch\u00e3o serves picanha and rack of lamb for lunch. The sheer amount of lamb ribs that I end up devouring easily covers the cost of lunch. \n\nThe trick to Fogo de Ch\u00e3o and most churrascarias is to not be afraid to say no, even when the occasional annoyed gaucho tries to make you take a cut of meat you don't feel like eating. \n\nJust say no to parmesan pork.\nJust say no to anything chicken. \nAnd just say no when the beef is not cooked to your liking. \n\nSeriously, you are in control here. Tell your gaucho if you want your picanha a little more cooked. Or tell a gaucho if you want a specific cut of meat. If a friendly gaucho that has a perm and kind of looks like Alexandre Pato is working, definitely request meat from him. The ginga is strong with him. \n\nAlso, my additional hacks of Fogo de Ch\u00e3o that will make your experience better is to ask your server for the following complimentary extras:\n\n* Mint jelly to compliment the rack of lamb;\n* Chimichurri sauce to pair with the picanha or sirloin steak and;\n* Lime wedges to just squeeze onto the beef for a party in your mouth. \n\nFor some reason, like In-N-Out's not-so-secret menu, you need to ask for these things. Also, do get some salsa from the salad bar and my favorite side, hearts of palm (literally baby palm trees). By this point I must sound like a baby killer... baby sheep aka lamb and baby palm trees. \n\nMoreover, if you are fortunate enough to be served by Mahelly, your experience will definitely be 5-star. Not only does she look like a Brazilian model, she went above and beyond to make our experience fantastic to the point that I wanted to do some capoeira spinning kicks like Eddy Gordo from Tekken. Sadly, after gorging at Fogo de Ch\u00e3o, my fat ass was barely able to make it out onto Howard Street. \n\nFor the weekday lunch value and the great service, our experience was five stars. \n\n* Don't overload on cheeseyballs. \n\n* I would recommend parking at the Fifth and Mission Garage (https://www.yelp.com/biz/fifth-and-mission-parking-garage-san-francisco-2) and walking over so that you can digest your meal on the walk back.", "author": "Richard K."}

I was expecting the experience to be top notch, but it ended up being very disappointing. Not only was the service on the low side, but the meats were just not what I was expecting. I felt like everything was overly salted, which is an automatic NO for me. I also felt like the different meats were lacking flavor. During the time that they were bringing around the meats, there were about 1-2 batches of meat that tasted somewhat decent. As I was trying the meats, everything ended up going onto another plate that I wasn't planning on eating. This was very upsetting to me because I truly was expecting something more. \n\nI was utterly disappointed with the service. I had ordered two glasses of ice, which took 25 minutes to bring to me. In addition, my brother had ordered an alcoholic beverage from the bar and it took about 30 minutes for them to get that over to him. I had to get the supervisor/ manager to come over to our table before these things were taken care off. \n\nIn terms of the salad bar, this was basically what saved dinner for our table. Most of our group was pleased with the salad bar options and it's what made the experience slightly better. I was definitely not expecting the experience to turn out the way it did. If I had to choose between Espetus Churrascaria and Fogo De Ch\u00e0o, I'd go with the first one.\n\nI'm willing to give this restaurant another try, because it could've been an off day, but at this point, I wouldn't recommend it for a big party like we had.

Servers parade around with various grilled meats, from lamb to filet mignon, and you can have as much or as little as your heart and stomach desire. Be sure to pace yourself - turn your card over to red in between meats. Don't feel like you have to have all the meats at once. There is more than plenty to go around. The meat quality is excellent, and well seasoned. I am fond of the garlic sirloin!\n\nThe Market Bar is fabulous - beautiful selection of fresh veggies, fruit, salads, cheese, charcuterie, soup, smoked salmon, etc. You can easily fill yourself up on the Market Bat alone, so be careful not to overload your plate before you begin indulging in meat. You can always opt to just have the Market Bar if you would rather not splurge on the full experience, or do not want meat.\n\nIf you do opt for the full experience, just be aware that once you start eating meat, they will also bring you family style servings of mashed potatoes, polenta fries, and caramelized plantains. So, again, pace yourself with Market Bar goodies.\n\nIf you are a vegetarian, or would prefer not to have unlimited amounts of meat carved at your table, there are other meal options, including fish. But honestly, I can't imagine why anyone would come here and not participate in the meat experience.

I take this way over Espetus for sure. We went here on New Years and the decor and location was very nice. \n\nAbout the food, a full dinner includes unlimited salad bar and of course delicious cuts of different meats that they cook in their rotisserie style grill. The salad had some of my personal favorite salads, vegetables, and other condiments. From there, everything was fresh as it should be. Onto the more important topic of the night was their selection of meats. Medium-rare is what I liked and their Top Sirloin, Ribeye, and Filet Mignon were among my favorites of the night. The combination of marination and salt was excellent. Although, the Filet with bacon was too salty for my liking and I wish the bacon were more crispy. But food experience was great.

It's an all-you-can-eat meat house granted a high-end one, but there's no getting around the concept of having servers come every three minutes with different skewers of mostly succulent meats. Those eternally carnivorous diners who have already been to Espetus Churrascaria know what they're in for here, and it's a much nicer place than the one portrayed in the bridal shower lunch scene in \"Bridesmaids\" before they, well...you know. Anyway, I made an Open Table reservation for Jamie W. and me, and we were surprised how bustling business was even around 6PM.\n\nOnce we told the server we were here for the $59.95 Full Churrasco Experience, we were handed the circular cards - green on one side, red on the other - which indicates to the men with the meat if they should stop by and start carving. There wasn't much direction beyond that, so we immediately made a beeline to the Market Table (photo: http://bit.ly/1Wg3uwV). It was an expansive buffet-style table full of salads and cold side dishes that reminded me of that scene in \"Fargo\" when Marge and Norm piled up on chicken fricassee. To say that was a meal in itself would be redundant since they offer a Market Table-only dining option for $28.95.\n\nI always forget to graze less at the Market Table (photo: http://bit.ly/1XeQOpK) because it only means I can eat less of the meat to come, at least in theory. It didn't take long after we sat down that the meat started to pass by us. Dare we turn our cards over. Yes, yes we did, and the gluttony didn't stop. We tried at least three of the six steak options: Picanha (the prime part of the Top Sirloin; Filet Mignon; and Costela (Beef Ribs) (photo: http://bit.ly/1rAF6tv). All were succulent and tasty. We were less enamored with the Lombo (Pork Loin) and Frango (Chicken Legs) which we found overcooked (photo: http://bit.ly/1WRKsMz). Meanwhile, the server left us plates of Grilled Polenta and heavily creamed Garlic Mashed Potatoes (photo: http://bit.ly/1WhrAYN).\n\nNeedless to say, we were about to reach capacity when I weakened and ordered dessert, the $10.50 South American Flan, which was decent enough though quite refrigerated in temperature (photo: http://bit.ly/1T4NEC0). The effusive manager came by to see how we were doing, and I have to say that was a nice touch in an otherwise impersonal calorific extravaganza. On the way out, I took a quick look at the series of ovens where the meat was prepared, and it was an impressive operation since they apparently don't serve meat that's been out of the ovens for more than two minutes (photo: http://bit.ly/1Wg3pJB). Leftovers must be amazing for the staff at the end of the night.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...impressive Market Table choices, steak skewers are the best, the rest somewhat skippable\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...quite a sleek operation for such a big space\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...a bit automatic but then again, those skewers look pretty unwieldy\nTOTAL - 4 stars...pricey but if you're a hungry carnivore, it might be worth a splurge", "author": "Ed U."}

He declared with a laugh when the hostess inquired whether it was his first time there: \"Definitely not.\" I had nothing better to do after eating like a fiend for 15 minutes and then bursting at the seams, so I sat and watched him. His only loot from the salad bar was three slices of bacon. After that, nothing but medium rare beef. Smart move! \n\nI'd recommend the top sirloin and ribeye.

From the outside, it looks grand, but when you walk in, you can't help it but to be surprised with a narrow layout, very small bar, and an odd sitting area near the bar. They have an outdoors bar sitting area which seems to be nice but it is closed for now. So during the summer, that might become a nice after work cocktail place. \n\nI was a bit thrown off by the layout of the floor as the main salad bar is on the back of this L shaped restaurant so for those sitting by the front of the restaurant you have quite a walk to get their salad or sides. \n\nSalad Bar - disappointing. Very limited options, very small and not enticing. So vegetarians accompanying meatarians for dinner, eat before coming to dinner here. \n\nService - EXCELLENT! Friendly, attentive, and efficient. I am impressed. Starting at the bar. I had a mango drink which was a tad too sweet. The bartender inquired about it and when I gave him feedback that the drink was sweet, he created a drink with fresh strawberries with the same base and it was delicious! I really appreciated his attitude of trying to make the customer happy. Eder and Thiago were our servers  and they were exceptional. \n\nAPPETIZERS: the sliders were Ah-mazing. Sliders made out of cheese bread.?!! You can not go wrong with that! \n\nThe MEAT - hit and miss. Some were incredibly delicious, some were tasteless. The variety was lacking and the same cuts would come around often. The better cuts were more of a rare occurrence but upon request, it would eventually come around. \n\nSIDE DISHES - if you are a serious meat eater, stick with light salad and eat your meat. The sides will quickly fill you up. Heavenly cheese bread (P\u00e3o de Queijo), fried banana, fried polenta ( I secretly wished they were fried yucca) and mashed potatoes. \n\nThe DESSERT- oh my dear God. I am Brazilian, I go to Brazilian steakhouses often and always have papaya mousse and I can safely say, I have never tasted a better one. It was, oh so good. I shall say it tasted orgasmic! Highly encourage papaya mouse with cassis liquor. \n\nAll in all, it was a pleasant experience especially because of the excellent service and their willingness to make us happy. Thank you Fogo.

Being such fans of Fogo de Chao, we thought it'd be nice to dine at their SF location, since we're always dining at the LA location.  It's safe to say not all locations operate the same.  As soon as we entered and heard the hostess speak, I knew there'd be a problem at this location.  First of all, as a hostess, you should always make eye contact and smile.  Even if you're tired, pretend or, as the expression says, \"fake it 'til you make it\".  This hostess had such a dry attitude and act as if we were bothering her.  Without making any eye contact, she looked down at the computer screen and mumbled, \"name?\".  I started to say, \"Webster\", as in the dictionary, so she could use it to look up the word \"courtesy\".  Anyway, this dining experience was just starting, in all the bad directions.\n\nWe were seated in the middle of the restaurant, in a rather busy area, until we requested to be moved to another table.  This same hostess still hasn't smiled, so we'll just assume she had dental work the previous day and her facial muscles are still sore.  A server came to our table, and appeared to be jovial, but we didn't see him much thereafter.  We made our way to the serving stations but, to our surprise, there wasn't anyone at the meat carving station, and the tri-tip was left unattended for quite some time.  I went to get some of the sweet potato souffl\u00e9 but the container was empty.  So, I asked one of the employees if they'll be bringing out a new container and he replied, \"in about 20 minutes\".  Immediately, I thought, we've never had to wait for any food at the LA location, as every food item is replaced almost immediately.  Anyway, we made our way back to our table to wait for the meat to arrive.  For whatever reason, some of these employees seem to rush to the table with the meat, causing the juice from the meat to spill onto the tablecloth.  Then, there were long gaps of time between receiving meat at our table.  After 20 minutes, I went to check on the sweet potato souffl\u00e9 again, but was informed by the same employee, from 20 minutes prior, that it will be an additional 20 minutes.  At this point, I asked for a Manager and was informed there wasn't a Manager.  What the heck?!  I walked to the front of the restaurant and asked the aloof hostess for the General Manager.  She said she didn't see him but said she'll find him.  I asked for the name of the GM, and requested he, or she, be sent to our table.  Before going back to our table, I decided to stop and get rice but, much to my surprise, the rice container was empty, as well.  To our dismay, it was rather obvious that we'd have to find dinner elsewhere, which would be highly unlikely on a major holiday.  So, when Daniel, the GM, arrived to our table he was very kind and immediately apologized about the sweet potatoes.  Without delay, I informed him that there was much more of a problem than sweet potatoes.  Daniel apologized and ensured us that matters will get better and, unfortunately, they didn't.\n\nAll in all, we decided to leave this restaurant.  The staff did come to our table more after we talked with Daniel, but it was obvious that they were forced.  Daniel came back to the table to apologize again, and stated they've been open for only a year.  I'm sorry, but a year is more than enough time to have a well-trained staff for any given business.  I explained to Daniel how amazing and professional their LA location is, and that we frequent that location regularly.  As a courtesy, Daniel comped our meal and provided a gift card for \"lunch only\" at any of their locations.  That was a nice gesture, but doesn't erase the experience endured at this restaurant.   Hopefully, the GM will take the constructive criticism and apply it accordingly.", "author": "Tony Y. Jr. Y."}

I prepared myself by having a very light lunch of salad...nope, still wasn't prepared enough for Friday's dinner!\n\nFull churrasco dinner (16 cuts of meat, market bar, soup, and condiments) = delicious. We tried 13 out of 16, and we had to flip the card several times and finally conceded to being way too full.  We tried top sirloin, bottom sirloin, NY strip steak, steak with bacon, ribeye, pork ribs, pork tenderloin, pork chop, pork sausage, chicken with bacon, chicken breast (per my request because I was tired of bacon), leg of lamb and lamb chops. All of the meats were perfectly cooked, full of flavor and moist. \n\nThe market bar was excellent in quality and selection, and I absolutely loved the hearts of palm and marinated mushrooms. \n\nSide dishes: I enjoyed the polenta fries, while he enjoyed the mashed potatoes. But we both loved the caramelized bananas.  He $59.95/pp\n\nSince it was his birthday, I ordered the molten lava chocolate cake, and a candle, and it was shockingly complimentary on the check!

Truly a meat lovers paradise... and don't even get me started on their salad bar.\n\nWe had reservations so we were seated fairly quickly. It also got busy later on as I looked at their entrance so I recommend either making a reservation or coming early. They start you off with bread (which is a trap, it's super good but will fill you up, try to eat less of it!) All of their meats here are cooked perfectly and you can even choose what kind of cut you what and how you want it. My favorite has to be to lamb chops which were full of flavor and then the filet mignon and the top sirlion. \n\nWhat I also love about this place is their amazing salad bar. But be careful and don't get too full off the salad bar! You gotta save room for the meats. The salad bar included premium cheeses, smoked salmon, veggies, different types of salad and different types of salami.\n\nDefinitely a place to come for a celebration dinner/lunch or even a a special occasion.

The roommate and I decided to come here for dinner on Monday, February 8th. I made a reservation for 6pm through OpenTable table the week prior.\n\nSince we got there early, we hung out at the bar for a quick drink. They have happy hour in the bar area, Monday through Friday, 4:30pm-6:30pm. I got a glass of wine: Fogo de Chao, \"Gran Reserva\", Malbec - Mendoza, Argentina ($10). It was a generous pour. It's normally $16, so I saved $6 with their HH pricing. We didn't finish our drinks before 6pm, so we took them to our table. The roommate got The Macallan 18 yr ($34).\n\nFinally, the all you can eat meat fest can begin! Dinner is $59.95 per person and also includes their salad bar, bread that resembled mini popovers, garlic mashed potatoes, polenta fries and fried bananas. Their mashed potatoes were pretty good. I only tried a few things from the salad bar: asparagus, mozzarella, mushrooms, roasted garlic and smoked salmon. The roommate got a huge mixed greens salad with some cheese and jalapenos. I also got some fruit for dessert.\n\nMeat wise, I tried everything that came by our table: bacon wrapped chicken, bacon wrapped filet, pork sausage, parmesan chicken, all cuts of beef, lamb, chicken and pork. My favorite was the cut that's the main pic on their yelp profile. I believe it's the picanha (or sirloin)? It was nice and rare with lots of flavor. The outside had a nice crispness to it which I adored. Most of the huge pieces of beef had rare to medium rare spots in it, but most of their meat was too cooked for me. I like my lamb and beef rare, but most of their meat was medium and up. Especially the lamb which was mostly medium well to well done.\n\nI've only gone to the other SF Brazilian steakhouse on Market a couple times and their other restaurant in San Mateo. I have to say, I prefer that restaurant over this one. They have more of a selection. Both in their salad bar area and in meats.\n\nDuring dinner, I also got a Black cherry manhattan: knob creek rye, martini & rossi sweet vermouth, luxardo cheery sangue morlacco, orange bitters, black cherry ($15). It was a good drink, but on the pricey side.\n\nOverall, I did get my meat fix, but I was a little disappointed in their selection. Where were the chicken hearts, grilled pineapple, etc? Plus, after I was done eating, I saw a plate of ribs being carried by one of the servers. Only after reading some of the reviews here, did I realized you have to request them. A real bummer as I would have liked to try that dish.\n\nAfter leaving, I did feel meat wasted. But I couldn't help but think, I would have enjoyed a steak prepared exactly the way I wanted instead of a bunch of random meat that was overcooked (for me). Glad I came by and checked them out, but my experience was just alright.", "author": "Elena N."}

Quality was okay.\nPork Tenderloin - 2/5 flavorless, dry and tough\nPicanha - 4/5 One of my favorites, the rarer cuts were fatty and tender\nBacon Wrapped Filet - 3/5 Filet is lacking in flavor but that's to be expected.

Green syrup drizzled over was particularly offensive and lingered with its artificial made-in-lab aroma.\nChocolate Mousse Cake - 3/5 Mousse layers were okay, cake layers a little bland. The white sauce drizzled on was also terrible and tasted like a vanilla Glade plugin.\n\nAMBIANCE: Had a reservation for 2 and were promptly seated. We were in this weird corner table facing a wall and window but the privacy was nice and servers never forgot about us and came around often. Definitely does not feel like an upscale restaurant. Ambiance is weak, I know it was a former Chevy's but the booth furniture was tacky, the wall I was facing looked unfinished with scratches and leftover hooks still in the wall.\n\nSERVICE: Nice and engaging. The first server poured the soda too quickly and spilled some on the table but was apologetic and it wasn't a big deal. Servers rotated around well, filled my water, and they work as a team. A lot of upselling on other items: drinks, Pellegrino, post dinner Bailey's coffee (you must have a death wish to want to cap it off with even more food and calories at this point).\n\nWith some non-alcoholic beverages, the total came out to be around $80 per person pre-tax and tip. If you're into quantity, then it might be worth it but I'd rather have a really nice, pared down steak dinner or picked up a pack from Costco and grilled them myself. The value for price wasn't there, so I wouldn't come again. Redeeming parts were the nice service and variety of meats, if you asked for it.", "author": "Truc N."}

It's a little upscale and might be a bit expensive especially if you go through 4 bottles of wine like we did on our visit. :-)\n\nI really don't think the restaurant was over-priced compared to the quality of the place, environment, food and service level that they provide. I am including some of my pictures to this review so you can get a sense of what the place looks like. Despite the restaurant being almost to full capacity, the service was excellent, responsive and everyone would come and help you immediately if you needed anything else. \n\nThe restrooms were crispy clean. Needless to say, the rest of the restaurant was also very clean, neatly arranged and ready for more people to enjoy the experience.\n\nThe food was amazing. I tried everything from beef to lamb, chicken and pork. There was nothing I didn't like. The meat was exquisite, soft and juicy. I like my beef medium-rare mostly. Chicken and pork were also really good and cooked to perfection. Unfortunately, I didn't have a chance to try any seafood. I will have to try it on my next visit.\n\nThey have several side dishes that compliment the food and I especially liked the garlic mashed potatoes and the fried bananas. \n\nIn regards to wines, they have an extensive menu of very good wines and brands all across the spectrum. If you're into wine and good food, this is probably a great place to visit. \n\nTo finish my review, I want to thank Mahelly Ferreira, Restaurant Manager of the San Francisco restaurant. She came a few times to our table to ask if everything was well and to see if we needed anything else. She was very friendly and made us feel like we were old-time customers or friends.

I had been to the Fogo in LA and had an enjoyable experience so I was ok with trying this one over House of Prime Rib or Harris. Big mistake. The salad bar was awesome but the meat was a total let down. They came around multiple times with every single different cut of sirloin you can think of. They were good, but I didn't spend $60 pre tax, tip, or whatever else you get to eat the cheapest cut of meat in the restaurant. Their chicken was one of the best items (cognac marinaded) but it was chicken. They only came around with the filet and ribeye after they had stuffed us with the cheaper meets. The service for the most part was good. Only complaint was that my water glass was always empty. Even when the waiter would come to our table I'd have to ask him to refill my water as he walked away. I actually ended up refilling my own water twice. They were also out of chicken hearts, which was the one thing I was really looking forward to. Now onto the bathrooms. It was easily the worst kept bathroom I've ever been in at a formal restaurant. The stalls were filthy to the point I had to go get a paper towel to wipe down the toilet. Both of them were like this. They were also out of toilet paper in both stalls. The trash bin was overfilled with discarded hand towels. It was terrible. I could never imagine this happening at other high end chains like Mastro's, Mortons's, or Ruth's Chris. I can easily say that I will not be coming back here. Any time soon.

I'm not blaming the staff since that's what they're trained to do but I dislike Fogo de Ch\u00e3o's practice of upselling $10 bottled water, $20 shrimp cocktail, and $10 dessert especially at an AYCE place. \n\nC H A R R U S C O\nhttp://bit.ly/1PH19rq\nThere's supposedly about 16 meat options but we only saw only 9-10 options. No grilled pineapple (boo!). I later found out via a food blog that the more premium meats like the beef ribs (I really wanted to try this) are by request only. How are customers suppose to know this when you do not inform them AND do not offer a menu of your meat offerings?! Not being upfront/withholding information is borderline deceptive IMO.\n\n+ Ribeye: Fav of the night! Well-marbled and perfectly seasoned, the ribeye was incredibly rich and tender. \nhttp://bit.ly/1UpA5My\n+ Leg of lamb: Tender and nicely gamey.\n\n- Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignon: Terrible!  Salty, hard, and dry. \n- Pork Sausage: Well-seasoned but on the drier side.\n- Top sirloin: Tough and sinewy.\n- Bottom Sirloin: Tough and chewy.\n- Pork Ribs: Dry and flavorless.\n- Lamb Chops: Chewy.\n\nI felt sorry for the gaucho who had to serve the Parmesan crusted pork. That meat stick got as much love as a microp*nis. \n\nS I D E S\nhttp://bit.ly/1OGBrhr & http://bit.ly/1R9Xioq\n+ Cheese bread: Warm, fluffy, and cheesy (gluten-free).\n+ Polenta fries: Crispy and soft.\n- Garlic Mash: Yucky, pasty texture.\n\nS A U C E S\n+ Chimichurri: Herbaceous but needed more acid.\n- Horseradish: Zero kick.\n\nM A R K E T   T A B L E\nhttp://bit.ly/1OEakn7\n+ Brown Sugar & Pepper Bacon: Crunchy, sweet & spicy porky deliciousness.\n+ Marinated mushrooms: Tender and good amount of acid.\n+ Pickled veggies: Helped cut through the richness of the meats.\n+ Fresh veggies: Crisp.\n+ Oranges, grapefruit: Super juicy.\n\n- Feijoada: Like something out of the Great Depression era--bland, watery, and meatless. \n- Smoked Salmon: Hella salty!\n- Charcuterie: Hella salty!\n\nD E S S E R T (+$10-$11)\n*Carmelized Pineapple w/ vanilla ice cream ($10): Juicy, sweet, and refreshingly tart.

Great for large groups! \n\nP A R K I N G\nNo valet. Yerba buena garage is 2 blocks away on 4th/Mission.\n\nFogo de Ch\u00e3o exceeded my low expectations with the stellar service but with the $100 pp tab (including 1 drink, tax & tip), the meat quality was more of a miss. I prefer spending that $100+ at a fancy steakhouse like Alexander's, Hillstone, or Bobo's where I know all the cuts will be top-notch and cooked perfectly. I know they're still very new but I'm rounding down my rating because of Fogo de Ch\u00e3o's upselling tactics and not offering their full meat selection upfront. I REALLY wanted to try those thick, girthy beef ribs. *Sad pouty lip*", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

My boyfriend and I are not new to Brazilian steakhouses, so we were excited to see what Fogo de Chao has to offer. We arrived promptly to our dinner reservations and were seated immediately. The place is huge and we were seated in the far corner at the end of the restaurant. With our distant seating, I was hoping we wouldn't be excluded for the rounds of meats swarming around the restaurant. Our waitress asked if we wanted anything to drink within just a few seconds of taking our seats. Similar to other reviews, there was a bit of up selling, but not a considerable amount that effected our dining room experience. Please be aware that the prices for drinks are ridiculous and there are no free refills on drinks or soda. \n\nI was surprised to see that even in the far back corner of the restaurant of where we were seated, we received an immense amount of attention. The service was good and each carver was kind of enough to ask if we wanted a second piece - they were definitely not stingy or gave judging stares to my hungry-looking eyes! I was also impressed with the service from our waitress because she made her rounds to our table to make sure everything was ok. I thoroughly enjoyed that she asked if we would like to replace our plates with new ones, which I haven't experienced much at other Brazilian steakhouses. I also didn't have to wave down our waitress on ordering more side dishes because we were immediately asked if we wanted more.  The meats were delicious and I love that they offered a basket full of cheese breads! \n\nUnfortunately, I was a bit disappointed in the market bar. The market bar did not have a great selection of hot plates and mostly served fruits and cold grilled veggies. I only went up to the market bar maybe once or twice, but a lot of the items were not refilled. I get that the big money maker is in the meat, but with the price you're paying, I expect more at the market bar than fruit. I was also sad to find out that they do not serve grilled pineapples!!!! The grilled pineapples served at Brazilian steakhouses are usually the highlight of a perfect meal for me. The restaurant also serves the included sides of mashed potatoes, fried plantains and polenta, but honestly, doesn't have much flavor/season to them. \n\nHonestly, with the amount I paid for dinner, I would much rather venture out to another Brazilian steakhouse for a similar or even lower pricing than here. It was a good experience, though.", "author": "Victoria K."}

Would recommend getting a reservation to skip the line. \n\nIt was my first time there and while it was a little intimidating, the servers were very nice and explained the service to us. The service itself was very attentive and were able to answer all of our questions. I had a promotional gift card for 2 meals that I don't think covered the Market and alcoholic drinks, but when I asked for the bill I found that both were not charged to my bill! That was a very nice surprise and much appreciated--the staff is extremely accommodating and just exceptional. \n\nAs regards to the food, the Market displays were very fresh and a lot of variety. The meats themselves were very delicious and it was lovely to have them freshly carved at the table. It was just a little difficult to keep up with all the different varieties floating around. If you don't eat fast enough the meat will cool, and the blood and fats will coagulate taking away from the higher quality of meat you're supposed to be eating. So I guess my advice would be to not have more than 3 kids of meat on your plate at once so you can enjoy them at peak freshness. The mashed potatoes, fried bananas, and cheese buns were perfection, too!", "author": "Alison M."}

Usually when you go to a place like Fogo, you have to have a plan.  What do you eat?  What do you not eat?  What is in that gray area where you can go either way?  Alcohol or no alcohol?  These are just a few questions on what every diner at Fogo has to answer during their time here.\n\nUnfortunately, I did not have those questions in mind when I came here.  I pretty much sat down, ordered a drink, went to salad bar and avoided all carbs as much as possible, and then waited for the meat to come.  Friendly warning, the salad bar is no joke.  There is a lot of good stuff there and it's very tempting to get one of \"everything\" but that will lead you to disaster and take up precious stomach space for the meat bonanza.  I highly recommend filling only half of your plate.\n\nWhen the meat comes, I usually go for things like filet, ribeye, lamb, and other more elaborate preparations or high quality meat.  Fogo has a thing about doing sirloin and preparing it different ways.  For me, I certainly wasn't going to waste space on sirloin but again, you may feel differently.  When the meat is sitting there on a skewer in front of your face, your first instinct is to just say \"yes\" and ask for a piece.  Then another person comes by and does the same thing and another person...and another person...the endless cycle continues until you flip your circular button to the colored red side.\n\nAlso don't forget about the cheese bread, mashed potatoes, the yuca, and the fried plantains at the table.  They will also refill that for you as well so be mindful of your stomach capacity.\n\nService of course was great although at some point, food coma set in after the first hour or so in combination with the alcohol and large amounts of meat.  I do remember that our server checked in on us many times and the manager even paid a visit to our table.  This place is truly first rate in terms of how proper service functions.  \n\nThis place is definitely a special occasion sort of place.  I almost wish that I had more special occasions just to come here more often.

Our group consisted of 5 adults and three children (1/2 price for children, free for those under 7).\n\nI started with a Mange Refresco, made with vodka, basil and mango puree.  Delicious, refreshing and not too sweet.\n\nA trip to the Market Table led me to a variety of salads, vegetables, candied bacon,fruit,  cheeses and cured meats  While its tempting to fill up, I had to save room for the beef, chicken, pork and lamb.  Each table is also offered cheesy bread rolls, caramelized bananas, polenta fries, mashed potatoes and feijoada, the traditional black bean stew.  One must be selective and strategic in order to enjoy everything.\n\nSome meats are better than others so it's good to be picky.  I found the pork loin, chicken breast and drummettes to be on the dry side but enjoyed the sausage, pork ribs and some cuts of steak (some where juicy and very tender, some where dry and a bit tough).   Don't forget to ask for their sauces.  The Chimichurri is a favorite of mine and helps cut through the richness of the meat. \n\nService was great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-06-09", "description": "This is without a doubt the worst experience I've ever had with a Brazilian steakhouse, and I've been to several different ones of them many times over the years. Across the board, my family and I were disappointed by just about everything. The list below is a direct comparison of the problems we had here compared to other similar restaurants, which don't have these issues.\n\n1. The meat is blandly seasoned. Almost every meat had little flavor, and some actually had bad flavor.\n\n2. The meat is on average served too rare. At every other place we've been to like this, the meat tends to be medium, which satisfies a broader range of people. Many customers don't like meat that's barely cooked.\n\n3. The meat is overly fatty and just plain gross. We wasted a ton of meat. Again, we haven't had this problem with any other Brazilian steakhouse.\n\n4. There's a weak variety of meat. We didn't feel like there was enough different items going around.\n\n5. The meat comes around in a totally uneven way--feast or famine. They really couldn't get the pacing down right, and it was neither overly busy or overly slow during our visit. We either had too much meat coming too fast, or else 5 to 10 minutes was going by with nothing happening.\n\n6. The salad bar area had the worst and weakest selection we've ever experienced. The four people in my family barely picked anything from it to eat, and at other places we fill our plates.\n\n7. The salad bar area kept running out of key items we wanted to have from it (i.e., the few we were actually interested in).\n\n8. Perhaps most bizarrely of all, soda isn't served from a fountain. It's served from expensive, single-serving, non-refillable glass bottles. As if that's bad enough, they're only 8 ounces--not even the size of a 12-ounce can. I don't think I've ever encountered another restaurant in my life like this. It's easy to drop $20 just on soda for four people and still not have enough.\n\n9. A staple of every Brazilian steakhouse is grilled pineapple. All they had here was cold pineapple, which was severely disappointing given that this is usually a highlight of such a trip.\n\n10. Getting our bill was difficult at the end of the meal and took too long. Then there was also a (minor) mistake on it.\n\n11. Last, but not least, this place is way overpriced. We paid about $140 (without tip) for two adults and two kids, which is a joke for the lack of value received.\n\nTo summarize, for the first time ever, everyone in my family left a Brazilian steakhouse still hungry and totally disappointed. And that's a pitiful shame because that just doesn't happen elsewhere. We will never go back to this restaurant again.", "author": "Jackson S."}

That was a bad choice since we both regretted not getting the buffet haha.\n\nWe got a beer ($10) and the beef sliders as well as the beef kebab/on the stick.\n\nThe meat for the sliders was HORRENDOUSLY disgusting- it was full of fat and gristle (the hard tendinous part that nobody can chew, nevertheless swallow)- the meat itself was barely 1/3 of what was in the slider itself. I just ate the buns (they are the Brazilian style cheesy bread and SO good).\n\nThe kebab was really tasty- nothing wrong with it at all. This was $15 for the kebab and the sliders were $10.\n\nHowever, where they redeemed themselves is the bartender/server who came over and when I mentioned this casually, since I was not trying to get comped or anything, just letting him know the quality was definitely mediocre and the meat was not up to Fogo standards as I know it- he went and took the more expensive kebab off our bill! Without any prompt. It was superb customer service and totally appreciated since we literally just ate the buns off the sliders and didn't even touch the meat since you could barely eat it- or just chew it like bubble-gum and spit it out.\n\nSo- will be coming back to give their full on \"buffet\" experience a try out ($65 per person...) and will have to fast for a week before going here to load up on the different meats available.\n\nThanks to that bartender / server / waiter!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-26", "description": "Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse has finally arrived in San Francisco near the Moscone Convention Center in the old Chevys Fresh Mex Restaurant that was in that location on the corner of Howard and 3rd Street and I am so glad I finally got a chance to sample this high-end authentic Brazilian Churrasco where they the meats are cooked over live fire and served on a skewer, while being cut on your plate ready to eat! Fogo de Ch\u00e3o is actually pronounced \"fo-go dee shown\" not \"fo-go dee chow,\" like I know all of you thought it was, and the name refers to the traditional gaucho style of cooking in which large cuts of meat were roasted in a pit in the ground.\n\nThankfully there was no fire pit here, just succulent slices of meat from all of the juiciest parts of the cow, as well as pork, chicken and sausages. I had been wanting to try this place ever since they opened late last year and so did many of my Yelp Elite friends like Hazel, Michael and Christine. Two members of our party were celebrating their birthdays and wisely joined their eClub where they were each given 25 dollar coupons. I joined the eClub and got a 15 dollar coupon just for signing up. It was great way to save money because we knew Fogo was not cheap with dinners being 59.95 a person. We also saved money but bringing our own wine bottle as the corkage fee was a decent 35 dollars a bottle. \n\nThere was plenty to eat at Fogo, starting with the Market Table, which provides a bounty of salads and fresh fruits and vegetables, not to mentions cheeses, charcuteries and smoked salmon. And then there was also the Feijoada bar, which serves the traditional black bean stew from Brazil, along with white rice. But our dining group knew not to get anywhere near those tantalizing treats because they want you to fill up and therefore less of that expensively grilled meat. Once we were sat our server Alfredo knew what we were all about, he uncorked our wine, as we perused the cocktail menu, and then we told him bring on the meat! But first I had smartly done some research before we arrived and it was my fellow Yelpers and not the menu that told me about the complimentary Brazilian side dishes like mashed potatoes, crispy polenta, and plantains. I was also sure we got plenty of meat dipping sauces like the Chimichurri, Horseradish sauce, and mint jelly. Not to mention a basket full of the Pao De Queijo which were warm, soft cheesy bread rolls are served throughout the entire meal. \n\nBut we could eat, were quickly interrupted by Stuart who was there to push, what else? An additional add on this time shrimp served raw cocktail style or cooked. We wisely passed because we knew we were in for a meat extravaganza! To attract meat-laden chefs, diners use a card that is red on one side and green on the other: red means do not approach, while green means bring on the meat sweats. Let's just say there was plenty of green at our table. We ate smartly, we knew we had all night to feast on all 18 varieties of meat that was served at Fogo so we took our time, enjoyed our wine to go with meat and waited for the sweats to arrive.\n\nThe signature dish at Fogo is actually picanha, the prime part of the top sirloin, though filet mignon follows close behind. We also all loved the New York Steak and the rib eye. Everything was cooked just to our liking, medium rare to medium well, everyone had a choice.  There's a helpful list that they place at each table to describe what parts of the cattle you are eating. One caveat is that there is in fact a lot of sodium in their meats so make sure you get plenty of water to drink while you're there. There's also a healthy selection of bacon-wrapped goods for those who are really jonesing for some meat sweats but the only bad part of those meats were that they tend to cook faster with all of the bacon around it and therefore they left the meat drier (more Chimichurri sauce right?). A lot of the pork, lamb, chicken and sausage cuts were also dried out, despite the addition of jelly, so my advice is if you like a steak then stick to it, and ask for it again. They will bring anything to your table if you ask for it. And we did and our other server Amanda made sure we got it!\n\nFogo is a once in a lifetime special occasion meal that the whole family will love. At almost sixty dollars a person the place doesn't come cheap. There's a reason this place is so centrally located in the mid-town area of the city with the convention center and museums literally across the street. The best time is to come for your birthday month, if you join the eClub they will give you plenty of coupons to make sure you come back for more. Plus they were nice enough to give us two complimentary desserts for said birthdays. They tasted super sweet and clearly weren't their signature dishes at Fogo which is fine because we all got plenty of meat to go around and savor until each of us returns again to enjoy this bounty of food with a Brazilian flair.", "author": "Jason F."}

We came here on a Monday having high expectations since we've been to other Brazilian steakhouses. We waited about 15 minutes since we did a walk in with no reservation. The ambience was beautiful. I love dim light dinners! \n\nOur waiter was great he explained to us how Brazilian steak houses work (green keep the meat coming, red I'm either resting or I'm full). There is an appetizer area of the restaurant, I gladly enjoyed prosciutto, salmon loc, mozerella cheese, mushrooms, asparagus. CHEESE BREAD (little balls) are sooooo dangerous but amazing!!! \n\nSeveral meats came out and my favorite had to be the top sirloin steak. Love how the servers would coke around carve the meat in front of you and you would either grab it with your tong or they would place it on your plate for you. Usually I'd have rice with my meat but this time I wanted to just have all meat and enjoy as much as I can!\n\nFor our drinks we always had a glass of water, I had the famous Brazilian cocktail, my bf got me to get their moscato which was really sweet but in a good way!\n\nFor dessert we got the papaya cream. If you've eaten flinestones pushpops growing up... they have similar tastes and it brought me back to my childhood! \n\nOut of the many Brazilian steak houses that I've tried this is too 3 mainly because I love how their meat is cooked and seasoned in comparison to other places. Will definitely be back here! Maybe my birthday dinner will be here!", "author": "Melissa Nicole N."}

It was my first time at a Brazilian steakhouse, so I can't make any comparisons. However, the food was mediocre at best. The meat was bland, the salad/sidedish bar was ok, and the best part of the experience was either the bread balls or the chocolate lava cake. \n\nTo add on to the disappointment, the bill came up differently on my credit card statement. Rather than the number I'd written (which lies between the 18% and 20%), they'd charged me for the full 20%. I have a habit of truncating my numbers for easy end-of-the-month calculations, so this immediately caught my eye. It's not a large difference, but it strikes me as dishonest. I'd like to pay the price I intended, whether or not it aligns with one of the numbers suggested \"for my convenience\". \n\nSo yeah. Food wasn't too bad, but not good enough for me to go there a second time, what with the bill incident.", "author": "Bao Shan L."}

Good service and nice ambience.\n\nTheir chef came by my workplace and offered a neat offer for a meal. Took abit of planning to ensure we are all ready for a carnivorous dinner.\n\nMade a reservation via Opentable which offered an additional 100pts for reserving a table which is awesome.\n\nThe staff promptly sat us down and was immediately attended by a server. The service was really quite awesome and thoughtful, except perhaps if some of the staff followed through what they said they were going to do. Eg They took my plate and said they wanted to replace with a clean one, which is nice except they never did. I had to request for one. They said they were going to get me this particular meat cos I said I really liked it, they never did. Again I had to ask again for the meat. \n\nIt's an interesting experience where they provide a coaster with one side color green and another red. Green signify \"GIVE ME MEAT\" while red means \"let me finish the food on my place first\". It was hilarious and amusing at the same time, the speed of how fast the meat came once we switch it to green, I literally saw a server \"ran\" to served us those awesome meat!\n\nThey have a market table which offer salad, fruits and some light bites. Another table with rice, fruit and soup. Did not try them as I was saving my stomach for the MEAT!\n\nThe food itself was pretty good. My favorite is Picanha! I wouldn't called it's awesome though. $59.95 per pax for dinner is rather pricey. \n\nWe ordered creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert. The portion was huge and tasted pretty good. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this place for meat lovers and people who enjoy unlimited meat!

I recently attended a work meeting/dinner at Fogo de Chao and found myself (happily) overwhelmed by the sheer amount of food and meat! As part of our dinner, we had access to the market table, which boasts various dishes, including: salads, smoked salmon, feijoada, soup (butternut squash), charcuterie (cured meats, aged cheese, and accompaniments), antipasti (artichokes, olives, peppers, mushrooms, mozzarella, roasted garlic, roasted zucchini, sundried tomatoes), roasted beets, hearts of palm, cucumbers, asparagus, green beans, watermelon, pineapple, etc. When we finally settled down at our table, that's when the parade of meat began. You're given a token - one side is green/yes please and the other side is red/no thank you, indicating whether or not you want more meat or not. I'll be honest - my token spent the majority of the evening with green/yes please side up! Meats were brought table side on swords and were hand carved by our waiters. Meats included: steak (picanha, filet mignon, rib eye, sirloin, bacon wrapped steak, beef ribs), chicken, lamb, and pork (pork ribs, pork loin, linguine). We also had various side dishes, including garlic mashed potatoes, cartelized bananas, pay de queijo (warm soft cheesy bread rolls!), and polenta! We also had delicious desserts - don't know how we even had room for dessert - turtle cheesecake, key lime pie, chocolate mousse cake! The food was delicious - definitely wish I had room to eat more!

I wish I could say the same about the rest of the staff. A handful of them had bad attitudes and made snide remarks to us during our dinner. \n\nAt one point I had to excuse myself from the table to take a phone call. I walked outside to take my call and when I came back in I approached the host stand to ask where the bathroom is. My exact words were, \"Could you please show me where the bathroom is?\" Just as one of the hosts was about to answer my question, there other one cut her off to say, \"Yes, we have bathrooms. Isn't that neat?\" That would have been unnecessary to say even if I had asked if they have bathrooms. The fact that I asked where the bathroom was and received this response made it even worse. It made me feel bad to be spoken to like that and took away from what should have been a great experience. \n\nAs for the food, I enjoyed it but many dishes were overly salted.\n\nThis is not my first time eating at Fogo de Chao but it is likely my last.

Being close to the Moscone Center, Metreon, Westfield, and the abundance of SoMa businesses, it is situated in a prime location to draw in hungry workers looking for a hearty meal.\n\nThe atmosphere here has a fancy feel to it yet still comfortable. The lighting is at a nice dim level with a nicely placed Market Table in the center of the restaurant and an open kitchen with a nice view of all the meat being prepared for the feast to come. I came here with a group of 10 on a Wednesday night and was able to be seated promptly. Before moving on to the food, I also want to say that the service is especially friendly and attentive. They only made the whole experience all the more enjoyable.\n\nThere's so much food that they provide you with here that I don't even know where to begin! For dinner, the Market Table is open for the picking whenever someone wants to get some fresh goodies. The items available include your typical salad bar items such as sun dried tomatoes, arugula, mushrooms, artichokes, and peppers as well as some other foods such as salmon with capers, prosciutto, an assortment of cheeses, bacon, and roasted garlic. There's a lot to try there with a taste of freshness and quality. \n\nWith the dinner meal, they provide an unlimited amount of sides to the table. The mashed potatoes are somewhat typical, but other than that the sides are quite special. The polenta fries and fried banana were great to start off with to stimulate one's appetite. The Brazillian cheese bread they provide are very unique in that they don't taste starchy at all. They have a crispy consistency on the outside while having a chewy mochi-like texture on the inside. They can be quite addicting, but nice to take a bite out of between eating pieces of meat.\n\nThe main attraction at Fogo de Ch\u00e3o by far is the meat. Each seat has a token with one side being red and the other side green. Red indicates to the servers that you would like to take a break while green means bring it on! The servers constantly arrive at the table with meat on swords, and with a simple \"yes\", they will slice off a piece of that meat; but you better be prepared to grab it with your tongs while they're being cut. I was not disappointed with any piece of meat and the frequency at which they came by made it so that I always had something on my plate. The steak and lamb servings had to be my favorite, especially at the perfect medium-rare temperature. Amongst the steak and lamb, the cuts that stood out to me the most were the Picanha, Filet Mignon, and the Cordeiro Leg. In the end, the slice of lamb I received topped all else due to it's nice gamey taste.\n\nI would recommend Fogo de Ch\u00e3o to anyone looking for a fun and delicious Brazilian steakhouse experience in the SoMa area.

The servers are attentive and efficient, always coming by and asking if you'd like to try what they have and cutting you a piece (rare, medium rare, medium, well done) that you'd like. Out of all the meats I tried, I liked the lamb, filet mignon, garlic sirloin, ribeye best! They had stuff like sausages, chicken and ribs too even though I passed on most of that. Beware that the cuts of the meat can be really rare so if you're not into that, make sure to ask for more well done pieces. \n\nOn top of all this, they give you cheese rolls, fried bananas and polenta and garlic mashed potatoes. All of the food I had here was delicious and the service was on point. We ended the night with dessert (cheesecake) complete with candle and \"Happy Birthday\" written on the plate. It was really well done. Definitely a great place to take a friend out for their birthday or just for a special celebration!!", "author": "Nancy T."}

My first choice, 6 PM, was not available. Fine, 6:30 PM will work.\n\nWalked through the doors right at 6:29 PM.

The tables sitting on the outskirts of that area had slim pickings. We literally had to flag people down to get some meat. I felt bad for the non-aggressive folks sitting near my table, who ate practically nothing because they kept getting passed over despite their little cardboards being flipped to green.\n\nThis is not my first time at a churrascaria. I've been to many. The way they serve customers seemed very unorganized and inefficient.

If you actually appreciate fine dining do not come here. \n\nAmbience: It is extremely loud and there is little privacy at your table no matter where you are seated. While the waiters are good with coming by and offering you different options, it seemed disorganized and hectic as a whole and they are not knowledgeable about food pairings or wine pairings. \n\nMeal: While the meat was seasoned well, many of the options were overcooked and dry. There is a salad bar in the middle of the restaurant but no waiter could tell us what items went well with the meat we were receiving. The meat was of mediocre quality but the salad bar was sub par and left me unimpressed and somewhat disgusted (it was not well kept and the options were dismal). \n\nDessert: Dessert options were classic American desserts - nothing special besides tres leeches and flan. Honestly reminded me of the Cheesecake Factory and made me wish I had eaten there rather than spent $65 on dinner and an extra $11 on dessert. \n\nOverall this experience was extremely disappointing and did not live up to the reviews. I was not expecting much being as it was a chain but I truly think they should be more aware of the quality of each location and take a bit more care when it comes to customer experience.

The food bar has an assortment of quality food available. The items from the grill were coming out at a good flow. With 16 different items (if i remember correctly) from the grill, we were sure to save stomach and to try everything.

I don't consume red meat on a regular basis, so when I do eat meat I savor each and every bite. This was also my first experience at a Brazilian BBQ buffet, so the anticipation was only building up for 15 years. \n\nThe environment has the feel of an upscale hotel restaurant. Dark walls but nicely lit to feel comfortable for a nice dinner date, or a celebration. The elegant touches of wood, metal, and stone touches makes for a nice ambiance for treatung yourself to a hearty meal with a touch of class.\n\nTo start you're given a basket of cheese rolls/balls (pao de queijo), fried polenta fries, caramelized bananas (not plantains) and garlic mashed potatoes. I can seriously have been happy with the cheese rolls and polenta fries, as long as I don't get stiffed with the $60/head price! The cheese balls have a sharp cheddar flavor, with a soft and chewy texture like mochi bread. So amazingly good, but I'm really paying for the meat and atmosphere so I do my best to not fill up on these sides. My date and I had two baskets. \n\nThe eager and (many) friendly workers give the whole dining experience a very pleasant memory for me. Once we were asked if we wanted a slice of steak, but since our stomachs were reaching capacity we were getting more picky. My girlfriend turned down the offer of steak and commented that we were waiting for the chicken leg. Not too many minutes later, another person came by and said \"you were looking for chicken?\" with a smile. How cool? I love the customer service here.

I've been to the one in Santana Row many times as well as Beverly Hills and Florida location. I know what to expect, but my parents were surely in for a real treat.\n\n   Fogo de Chao San Francisco location took over the former Chevy's spot, conveniently right across from the W hotel and across from the Moscone Center, what's an ideal location for a steakhouse.\n\n   The restaurant showcases a beautiful dining room with seating for about 200 plus guests, the bar area with a TV to watch sport games, several private and semi-private dining areas, and an outdoor seating with heat lamps. The interior of the restaurant reflects a mixture of Northern California and Brazilian modern design.\n\n  My dad went crazy for the Salad Bar as usual. The Heart of Palm, this Brazilian imported delicacy is crisp, organic and sustainable. The artichoke, beet, green beans, corn, and the ready to serve Caesars Salad were all fresh and tasty. The Imported Cheese - fresh mozzarella, aged manchego and two-year aged Parmesan pair nicely with imported cured meats and tangy sun-dried tomatoes.\n\n   My mom loves the FOGO PREMIUM CAIPIRINHA Muddled with Fogo Premium Aged Cacha\u00e7a, fresh limes and cane sugar as well as their new Mango and Basil cocktail. She enjoyed it very much. I opted for the Fogo de Chao Malbec signature they have, quite nice.\n\n  For a carnivore, this is heavenly on earth. My mom loves beef, so she went crazy. She literally tried at least 10 type of meats. A few that my parents and I enjoy very much:\n\n- PICANHA Prime Part of the Top Sirloin - picanha represents the art and science of churrasco cooking. Lightly seasoned with rock salt and sliced thin, it is tender with a robust flavor. \n\n- FILET MIGNON Beef Tenderloin - Our gaucho chefs expertly grill the tenderloin on skewers and skillfully carve the perfect bite every time. Also served wrapped in a tender strip of bacon.\n\n- BEEF ANCHO Rib Eye - Arguably one of the most popular cuts in the world, this was cooked to medium rare as we requested. \n\n- FRALDINHA Bottom Sirloin - Fraldinha is one of the most distinctive and flavorful cuts of meat from Southern Brazil due to its strong marbling characteristics. \n\n- CORDEIRO Lamb - this was 1 of my favorite. \n\n- The Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail - gigantic with the cocktail sauce\n\n  For side dish, the Polenta, Fried Banana, and Mashed Potato were awesome. For desserts: The Papaya Cream - By far our most popular dessert in both Brazil and the United States, fresh papaya is blended with vanilla ice cream and topped with a black currant liqueur. And the Flan as well as the vanilla ice cream, my parents loved them all. I finished with a glass of Porto, check out their  whiskey list too! \n\n  Service was impeccable. The servers who cuts the meat were all smiling to take pictures with my parents. They kept on coming and offered us more meats. All our servers were very attentive, especially manager Mahelley and even the GM Ryan came to wish my mom a Happy Mother's Day, they kept checking up on our table to make sure my parents had a good time.  \n\n  The place was overly packed on a Saturday night, but it's the Saturday Mother's Day weekend, and what do you expect. Above of all, the food was good, plenty to try, the drink was strong, and the service was wonderful. I couldn't ask for a better experience for my parents on their first visit in San Francisco location. \n\n  For $59.98 per person at dinner, it's surely a bargain. Fogo de Chao is a great place to get together, holiday party, business dinner or any occasion. \n\n  I just found a new spot for power lunch and business happy hour in SoMa, this is where I'll hang out during conference at the Moscone center and 2 blocks from my parents' favorite hotel InterContinental.", "author": "Manda Bear B."}

I originally saw that they offer valet but honestly I hate driving to SF. I looked up their address on google and found out that Montgomery BART station is like 5-10 minutes away. So I figured why not save my money and sanity by just catching BART? \n\nMe and my brother got there around 7 o'clock for our reservation and our dad was already waiting for us drinking at the bar. We were escorted to our table and on the way I just walked in awe with how classy and slick the decor was. I watched as other waiters were walking around with large skewers of meat and all the happy faces from the guests as they bit into their food and the hype began to consume me...\n\nThe server was very professional and informative. After seating us she let us know all the kinds of meats that would be served that day and where the salad bar was. I kind of smiled and thought to myself, \"Pfft salad... Give me ALL the meat and TATERS!\" That's what I ate. Just about all the meat they had to offer. The prime rib, the top sirloin, the bottom sirloin, all the sirloin, sausage, lamb and even Chicken heart(It's actually pretty tastey if you can get past the rubbery texture!) No no no. I didn't eat this all in one sitting. Hahaha. It took a couple plates. See Fogo has this system where you have a two sided circular badge next to your plate. Green means keep them coming, while Red means leave me alone, PLZ. So needless to say I had to pace myself, to get the full experience. I honestly wish I could of took more pictures but the meat was sooooo tender and flavorful! I just didn't have enough patience...needed more meat :x lol\n\nMy favorites were the prime rib, top sirloin and the lamb chops. Everything was cooked medium-medium rare for the most part but I believe if you want it well done, they can make special requests. You just have to wait a little longer obviously. My little brother got the molten cake after showing him Erica's picture of it. It was amazingly rich. I might be biased since I am a sucker for chocolate though haha. I will agree with Jon though that some of the service seemed kinda off. Most of the servers were extremely friendly while one or two seemed kinda stuffy. It didn't really bother me too much because I was in meat heaven most of the time though. OH! I can't believe I forgot the taters! The Mashed potatoes were on point. Some of the better mashed potatoes I've had recently. \n\nWhen we got the bill I was a little shocked though. 59.99 a person for the meat and sides? Seems a little excessive. Now don't get me wrong. I understand that it's the city and everything is pricey. The quality of all of the food speaks for itself but can you at least include sodas along with that? I feel like 49.99 and more consistent friendly service would of sold me with the 5 stars. But nevertheless that's just me. I do think it is consistent with House of Prime Rib. HoPR is a tad cheaper and will also make sure you get full. However you have to wait for your food. With Fogo you are paying for trying out all the different kinds of meats and the meat is already ready as you sit down. This place is legit though. Despite my nitpicking, I guarantee I will be back regardless if its here in San Francisco or their other location in San Jose^^", "author": "Anthony W."}

I don't always eat bacon but when I do, I eat my weight in bacon. \n\nFour stars are solely for this magical bacon & Fogo's nice, stiff vodka martini because sides & the buffet items were sorely lacking in flavor. Cheese breads were bland, as was the polenta; mashed potatoes were a bit gummy; and bananas were over cooked & mushy.

We had never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before and had heard great things about this place. We made the 2 hour drive from Sac to SF for their full Churrasco experience, which includes continual service of their fire-roasted meats, along with their market table/salad bar. Once we got to Fogo, we were welcomed in and went to their large salad bar for starters. They had an assortment of salads (pear, endive, apple, chicken, mozzarella caprese), cheeses (fresh mozzarella, manchego), fresh veggies (asparagus, zucchini, baby potatoes), fruits (pineapples, watermelon), and cold smoked salmon and other meats, just to give you an idea. The spread was definitely elaborate and satisfying. We each filled our plates slightly, as to not overstuff ourselves before the main course. The salad bar items themselves were very tasty and exceeded our expectations. \n\nBack at the table, they had a basket of pao de queijo (warm cheesy bread, which is gluten-free!) that was to die for. The bread was soft, warm but still chewy. On a small plate there was fried polenta, garlic mashed potatoes, and carmelized bananas, all which were to die for! For my gluten-free eaters, I must tell you that everything here is gluten-free except for the bread at the salad bar. When you're ready to eat, you turn your cards over to the green side that says \"yes,\" which means the server will continue bringing out cuts of meat for you to try. Once you're stuffed, you turn it over to the red side that says \"no,\" and they know to give you a break while you try to recuperate.\n\nFor the main course, they brought out different cuts of steak, beef ribs, chicken, lamb, and pork. We didn't try the pork but everything else was delectable. They cut thin slices of the meat and you grab them with the tongs they give you to put on your plate. You must ask for their mint jelly on the side if you love the sweet/salty combo like I do. It's to die for and adds a different dimension of flavor to the meats.\n\nAs a complimentary dessert for my birthday, they brought out creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with fruit on the top and Happy Birthday written on the plate. It was delicious.\n\nDinner was $59.95 a person and was well worth it! When it was time to leave, we both agreed that we would definitely come back here in the future and make the 4 hour round trip drive just to experience it, again.\n\nIf you've never tried a Brazilian steakhouse, this is a wonderful place to start out at.

It was fairly empty and the staff didn't feel as confident as their Beverly Hills location- but I guess because they haven't had to pander to hordes of pretentious food snobs (yet ;) ) \n\nThat being said, for a place that is BRAND new, where the staff probably hasn't seen a lot of restaurants like this to base service off of, I think the evening went pretty well. Also, this is SF. And since prices are similar to BH, I think it's a great deal for a nicer, meat-centric dinner in the city.  \n\nThe starters are your typical Fogo sides. Mashed potatoes (these were meh), polenta fries, candied bananas and Brazilian cheese bread. Weirdly enough I LOVED the bananas here (normally don't) and thought the cheese bread was just OKAY here (too airy on the inside and not a lot of soft chewy bread inside). \n\nDefinitely Try:\n+ Picancha- Ah.. the always foisted meat. That being said its reliably tasty and good but don't fill up on this one! It's a cheap cut : ) \n\n+ Bacon wrapped filet and chicken- the filet was just OK but the chicken was YUMMY. Perfectly cooked nom nom.\n\n+ Parmesan Pork- TASTY with the caesar salad omg.\n\n+ Ribeye- my favorite cut of the night. Moist and perfectly done.\n\n+ Lamb- a little gamey but not offensive. I probably liked this the *least*\n\n+ Pork Ribs- also a little gamey but also not offensive. \n\n+ Argentinian Merlot definitely get! Was only $13-$14 a glass and had such lovely, soft tannins.

The passionfruit caipirinha was sooo sweet even though it was less sweet ( I think this is partially because I got passionfruit..haha!)\n\nIf you've never been, I definitely recommend it. \"Flipping\" the red/green card to indicate if you'd like meat or not is surprisingly delightful, AND no wait time for food!

I had made a group reservation for this place and when we got to the restaurant, the host tells us some guy came in before us, claimed to be me, and changed our group reservation to two people. Was there a tech genius hacking into Open Table accounts and stealing reservations? They said they could no longer find the guy even though they gave him a pager. When I asked if they could page him so I could speak with him, they said \"Oh that's a good idea. I'll do that right now.\" The guy came to the host-stand pretty immediately and it was obvious that he was just a walk-in with his girlfriend. Because they thought he had my reservation, they quoted him a reasonable wait but then had to tell him the wait would be 2 hours instead. How the guy's first interaction with the host led to MY reservation being changed is beyond me. The good part is that they worked quickly on setting up our table again and we sat within about 15 minutes.\n\nI don't know if there were so many issues because the restaurant just opened but I know there are many Fogo locations so there should be some experience in running a place of this caliber. The lights kept going out and/or flickering in our part of the restaurant, the salad bar needed to be restocked upon request, the servers dropped quite a few dishes throughout the night, and it was freezing (both from the ventilation and from the hosts leaving the front door open in 40 degree weather). We were also told by one server that they didn't have menus when we had just seen it from another server. \n\nAs for the food, it's not better than Pampas or Espetus. The salad bar is really subpar and does not justify even a portion of the $59.95 all-inclusive price tag. The best things were probably the squash soup and fresh mozzarella balls. There was some meat at a carving station that was included into the salad bar but once it was gone, it never came back. That meat, rice, beans, and soup were the only hot food options. \n\nThe meat selection was smaller and a few of them were over done or lacking seasoning. The chicken drumsticks were overcooked, and messing up dark meat is just unheard of. The beef ribs are by request only (weird). Luckily one of our meat cutters liked our table and brought it over to us. Unfortunately that particular meat was so fatty, it was unenjoyable. \n\nBe careful when ordering extras because some of the cocktails cost up to $17. The servers are on top of giving you soda refills but those aren't free. They comp'ed our wine bottle because of the earlier mistake I THINK. I don't know actually. No employee officially said it to us but it wasn't on the bill. Conclusion? I wouldn't come back.

This place is more expensive than the one in Philly or San Jose. \n\nI've been to the one in Philly multiple times and compared to the one in Philly, I was slightly disappointed at the quality of food.

I've been to Galeto in Oakland and I much prefer their bar (Baked salmon with sauce, deviled eggs, some other things)\n\nAs for the meats itself, I really liked the House Special. It was extremely flavored and not chewy. The top sirloin is generally my favorite cut at the Philly location and the top sirloin at the SF location was meh at best. My piece of bacon wrap filet mignon was overcooked. I was expecting medium rare.  My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed the chicken, I personally did not have any. He said the chicken (both the bacon wrapped and thigh) was flavorful.  The meat fell right off the bone for the thigh. \n\nAs for the service, we had a rotation of different servers coming to our table asking about our experience.  As for the meat service, some of the meat servers did not come around even though we had our green cards up and we had to specifically ask for them because we thought they were coming to us but ended up disappearing. \n\nOverall, it was okay. Fairly overpriced for $60 a head.  I came here because I miss the one in Philly and I wanted Rodizio.

Sure it's another chain but is it actually any good! What the heck does one do at a Brazilian steak house anyway? Would I look like a n00b? \n\nIn anticipation of this dinner I ate very lightly during the day, and I suggest you do the same. Bring on the meat parade! The best way I can describe this to my Bay Area homies is that it's like steak dim sum. Green card means \"offer me your meat,\" and red means \"I need a time out.\"  Servers come around with different cuts of meat and you get to say yay or nay depending on what you're into.There's also a market bar in the middle which hosts all the vegetables and salads, and I reluctantly got some greens to balance out my meat sweats. \n\nSo, without further adieu, here's the list of aaalllll the meats I had, starting with my favorites: garlic steak, NY strip, top sirloin, lamb shank, pork sausage, flank steak, bottom sirloin, filet, parmesan pork, and filet wrapped in bacon. My main strategy was to try a little of everything so you can definitely ask for smaller cuts. We also got mashed potatoes and polenta fries for the table, and both were good, but cold. \n\nService was very attentive, there's plenty of staff swarming around. We were a little wanton for coffee refills after we paid our check, but eventually we got to someone. We didn't have room for dessert but they looked enormous so I'd suggest splitting it with your table.\n\nSo with my glass of wine, the \"full experience,\" and a tip, it came out to $98. Not your every day meal, but definitely satisfying.", "author": "Alyssa J."}

Over the last several years we've ben fortunate to have either lived near or visited near one of their locations. All this changed when we moved to NorCal, not really any close locations until now. \n\nLast week (12/23) we were thrilled to hear that their newest location finally opened in San Francisco, yes! Having been to many of their other locations (Scottsdale, Vegas, Miami) Id have to say that this location is perhaps the most chic, relaxed and inviting. From the sleek tile entry to the walls of slat wood paneling the atmosphere is chic, dark and romantic. We were sat in the small booth and proceeded to enjoy the comfort of the bootie friendly banquettes (seriously, it's so nice that this new restaurant has soft comfortable seating as apposed to the other new places, that insist you sit on a hard \"reclaimed\" wood bench seating and expect you to be comfortable). \n\nIf you're familiar with the Brazilian Steakhouse concept, nothing is different here. Huge slabs of meat salted and wood roasted are carved table side by hunky guys. Beef, pork, lamb, sausages, and chicken arrive in waves all controlled with a paper coaster. The coasted is colored coded, red for stop and green for \"bring me all that thick tasty meat\" errr, Im mean go. There is also a large fresh food bar filled with cheeses, cured meats, and salad makings if you wish to have those with your dinner. But be careful, you don't want to get full on this stuff, save room for their incredible meats. All of this comes at the price of $59.95 plus drinks, tax and tip.\n\nFogo also has a pretty decent wine last which is well priced and accessible. Our server tried steering us towards Argentinian Melbecs but we ended up with a Sonoma Cab. Anyways, trust your gut and go with what you like. I don't think you can pick a bad wine form their list. \n\nService was friendly and attentive but be warned, they will try to up sell a few items form their menu including a plate full of colossal shrimp. We were hungry so we didn't resist her description and went with it. For $19 I'd say the appetizer was well worth it. Plump juicy shrimp, what's not to love. They also have a few specials in their menu including a fish option for those who aren't into AYCE meat, why? \n\nBe warned, there is very little on street parking around Fogo but there are several garages close by. Now get your meat on!", "author": "Alexander C."}

He brings the check, we give him the credit card... we actually did not review the check. He comes back after he had taken the credit card to ask what wine we were drinking (the name of it) I assumed he was asking to bring more wine as a way to apologize for the horrible dinner... so we said we were fine no need for more. He responds that he had forgotten to add the wine to the check so needed to get our credit card back and adjusted.

All the meat was perfect medium rare. They had lamb chops and sizzling crispy pork ribs. The pork loin dusted with a snow of parmesan was juicy and delectable. Melt in your mouth filet mignon was charred on the outside, rare on the inside. One demerit for bottom round cubes seriously as tough as tires, but the other fabulous offerings neutralize the demerit. Odd that they would serve bottom round which I spit out - heimlich maneuver meat. \n\nEvery piece of meat was a perfect medium rare. Not a dry, leathery bit to be seen anywhere. To avoid dry meat, always book a busy night and some time between 6ish/7ish when they are bringing out freshly grilled and sizzling fare for the evening crowds. Busy nights mean more turn over of the meat as they slap more on the grill for the hungry masses. That is the key to always getting the best experience. I have gone weekdays to these establishments and that's when you see them passing around the same tired, forlorn, desiccated roast and fewer variety. When you are paying nearly 60 smackaroos, go when it's busy otherwise don't come crying on Yelp.\n\nI noticed that the meat did not have as much salt. These places marinate the meat in rock salt before grilling, but this place was more light handed with it so I found myself occasionally salting my meat. They provided 3 sauces at the table - chimichurri, horseradish and a hot pepper sauce. They brought a basket-full of fresh crunchy cheese bread muffinettes, creamy mashed potatoes, grilled banana and fried yucca. We were so full we forgot to ask for grilled pineapple, but then I didn't see it being passed around.\n\nThe place is really nice and not as cramped as Espetus - expansive with high ceilings - luxurious. Located in the beautiful Yerba Buena/Moscone Center area with artsy, sculpture like buildings, fountains, classy restaurants, etc.. This adds to the experience of a night out on the town.\n\nPlunked down $175 for two - including tip, tax for the food, Perriere and a soda. Espetus upped their price to just about the same price as Fogo - nearly 60 bucks. If I had a choice, I choose Fogo because of the ambiance of the location and the interior. However, if they indeed don't serve grilled pineapple, I would choose Espetus, Pikana in Richmond and Cleos in San Bruno.\n\nSuper friendly and professional staff.", "author": "Billious H."}

I had only been to one other Brazilian steakhouse before this and had a rather mediocre experience, so I was hoping for some redemption out of this visit.\n\nThe space is huge - definitely easy to host a large group if necessary - and has a very modern, minimalistic feel to it. When you first walk into the dining space, you're greeted by a view of all of the meats being perfectly cooked and kept warm and next, their wide variety of other foods at the salad bar area. \n\nLet me start off by saying that the bread they give you is SO GOOD. They're pretty small rolls but you can always ask for more, and I definitely ate 5 at least... Their salad bar has a wide selection of veggies, pre-mixed salads, other meats, cheese, and fruit (all high quality and definitely much better than I experienced at the other establishment I went to) - would definitely recommend grabbing some things to accompany all the meat.\n\nThe way that the restaurant works is that you have a double-sided card that you flip to indicate whether you'd like more meat (green) or want to take a break (red). When the card is flipped green, the servers will continuously stop by your table with various types of meat and ask whether you would like a piece. Don't be afraid to ask them for a smaller or multiple pieces!! ALSO TIP: you can request a certain type of meat (multiple times.. haha my friends and I asked for the filet mignon like 5 times for sure), and they'll be sure to send them over in a timely manner!\n\nI'd say the only downside to the place is the price, starting at $60 per person for dinner, which can be pretty pricey especially if you don't have the biggest appetite.

The waiter also brings you little sides like fried plantains, mashed potatoes, and polenta fries.  \n\nOnce you're back at your table, just flip your little card over to the green side and the meat servers will start coming! They have some really good cuts of meat here so come hungry if you want to get your money's worth. Skip on the parmesan chicken, but you should definitely get the roasted chicken drumsticks, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, the rib eye steak, and the sirloin. All of the meats were extremely juicy and delicious and basically fell right off the server's knives!\n\nMy only complaint is that they definitely don't come around that often when the crowd is big, and service in general was just a little slow. Since we came here during lunch, and there was a convention happening that week just down the street, it was pretty busy.

I booked the amethyst package where it comes with the full meal, beverage and dessert.\n:)  The variety of salad bar was abundance and had some luxurious selections.  Fine cheeses, deli meats, fancy salads, and all kinds of other fine items to choose from.\n:)  The meat kept coming and they had sea bass for our pesco-vegetarians too.  \n:)  Almost everyone was super happy and grateful after the meal was over \n:)  The decor and ambiance was very upper class sophisticated - it was a beautiful restaurant\n:)  The manager is very sweet and accommodating\n:)  The meat on a stick was eye boggling.  You want to try everything.   \n:) The wait staff was very nice but... see below for the 'but' explanation\n\n...and then the pendulum swings!\n\nNOT GOOD :(\n:( The waitress provided instructions on how churrascaria works - that was cool!  I was right next to her and asked her to take the pesco-veg orders. I'm glad she listened to me because there were more fish orders than I thought!  Then she started announcing beverage selections that were priced outside of the amethyst package, I started freaking out because I had a budget in mind and didn't want to go over it.  BUT it was too late, many orders came through and I couldn't really stop it because I didn't want to embarrass anyone.  I quietly ask the waitress to announce the fountain/coffee/tea and dessert to the group, she said YES, then walked away without announcing it.  OH NO SHE DIDNT!  That burned my bubble and after that, my whole experience and attitude went into SHIT MODE!!  Several other people that sat around me saw what happened and had the same feeling.  I just told everyone not to worry about it and I'll talk to the manager when the bill comes out.\n:(  There was a wedding reception party - blushing bride was beautiful.  The restaurant was practically booked up.  Which made long long long long lines to the salad bar.  The line was supposed to to counter clockwise and some people from the wedding reception started going clockwise and screwed up the whole queue system!  It was way too many people for such a small bar.  They might want to consider a separate bar for big ass parties!  It was definitely uncomfortable and made me mad.  \n:( Since the line was long and the waitress knew that, she said half of our party should get up and go first.  She would come back for the 2nd half when it was clear.  She FAILED to let the 2nd half know when it was clear!  Guess it never cleared up because when I got there, the line was long long long!\n:( Plates were DIRTY!!!!!  I skimmed through 5 plates with leftover food marks on it before I could find 4 clean plates.  I wasn't even sure if I was going to get clean plates since there was only like 12 plates left for all these people to use.  I'm 100% sure some people wandered around trying to figure out where the plates are located because it was behind the salad bar and not logically at the front/back of the salad bar.\n:) This UPSET me the most out of all the UPSETS!  The 4 orders of fish was announced that it would take 15-18 minutes.  It was 30! 30 MINUTES before they got their orders.  I was very sad for them because they were waiting for their protein to come out to eat with salad.  And once it was out, they were filled with veggies already.  I looked at the sea bass and it was beautifully prepared but it was basically a seared sea bass.  Why would that take 30 minutes???  Not cool.  \n\n...and then the pendulum swings again!\n\nNOW THE RESOLUTION :|\nI asked the waiter to please send the bill and manager to me.  I was dissatisfied with the level of service and lack of communication to the amethyst package to our table.  I didn't appreciate the waitress offering drinks outside of the package when they knew we had a set menu.  The manager listened and worked out the bill with me.  Then after we resolved the bill, I manage to keep my company on budget, which was a very big deal to me.  BUT if there was better communication from the waitress, I'm 100% sure I wouldn't had been in shit mode for my company luncheon.\n\nNOTES:  Where are the grilled pineapple?  Some people were wondering where the chicken hearts were.  The meat selection was less than the other popular Brazilian steakhouse in the city.  Most of the meats were lacking salt and mostly dry.  My fav was the sirlon steak and pork ribs.  No seafood on a stick option (shrimp).\n\nCAME BACK AGAIN:  I did manage to come back for a complimentary meal with my +1. The additions were lamb chops, lamb leg, chicken hearts and rib eye - I liked the rib eye steak a lot!  Came out feeling like a over sized marshmallow.  But my stomach woke me up at 3AM and was sick for 30+ min.  They win, I lose.  The End.", "author": "Jenny T."}

Overall this was a great place, and the food was outstanding. The garlic sirloin (if I remember right) was the biggest surprise for me, not really a garlic type of person, but it worked really well for that one. Beyond the steak, all of which was amazing, the Market Table was great too, with a huge variety of stuff to go with the main course. \n\nThe staff was attentive, and helped make it a fun experience. \n\nAdded benefit to this place is easy parking at the Moscone Center garage, which is something most good restaurants in the city don't have. \n\n\nPRO TIP: because they use flat red/green cards here make sure that it is visible near the corner of the table, and not obscured by a plate or cup.", "author": "Chris R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-30", "description": "In a city known for it's fine dining cuisine and healthy lifestyle options, sometimes you just want to eat a lot of meat.  And not terrible, cut-rate, cheap rate buffet style fare, but real high quality meat, but still at an affordable rate.  Brazilian-style steakhouses are the best way to indulge in this, and Fogo de Chao is the best.  I've been to the ones in Las Vegas and San Jose, and not San Francisco. \n\nHere are my tips for Brazilian steakhouse eating:\n\nDon't go for a weekday lunch, unless you plan on skipping out on the rest of your workday from the inevitable food coma.\nIf you don't live or work in walking distance, don't bother driving.  You shouldn't be operating heavy machinery with the meat sweats.  BART is only a few blocks away.  If you insist on driving, they do offer valet parking.\nUnless you are a champion competitive eater, don't eat too much during your previous meal.  Or, you can be like me and don't eat for the entire day before dinner!\nDon't fill up too much on the market table.  Have a few small tastes of some salads, or cured meat (they even have a whole pile of cooked bacon!), maybe even some fruit.  But they will be filler for the real reason people dine here.\nControl yourself when you first turn that button to green.  In the beginning, get a small portion of each type of meat, to experience the full plethora of options.  Once you've tried everything, then you can go hog wild and get seconds (thirds? fourths?) of your favorite meats.\n\nAs far as my favorites go, I love the Picanha (their signature meat), the beef ribs, the lamb chops, the aforementioned bacon and the caramelized bananas.  The meat quality and variety is the best of all the different Brazilian steakhouses I've dined in, as well as the quantity of different dishes on the market table.  Possibly in the future, I will try dessert, but i never seem to have room for it!", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

The restaurant is beautifully designed and appointed creating a serene and comfortable experience.\nThe New York steak was to die for. The Picanha (top sirloin) steak almost as good.\nI would have given them 5 stars if they had had more kinds of meat such as linguica or chicken on the buffet. Some of the things on the buffet were not labeled as well as they could have been. While I do not like Feijoada black beans, I was told that it is great.\nIt is an expensive dinner, so we did not have alcohol which was quite high priced.\nSince it is an \"all you can eat\" restaurant, come here very hungry.", "author": "Andreas M."}

They give you cards to flip over to indicate whether you want them to stop by and offer you meat or not (green = come feed me and red = oh no please stop). I flipped my card to green immediately after hitting the salad bar because I  was eager to get started. However you get bombarded so quickly with meat that your plate starts overflowing and you not only have no room left to get more let alone even cut the pieces you already have. In addition, by the time you get to eat your meat it's already cold  maybe I'm just a noob and I got too greedy about trying all the meats. Whoops. But seriously guys all the beef cuts tasted the same. I'm pretty sure they said top sirloin for every single one. The bacon wrapped chicken was really dry and the bacon literally had not been crisped at all and was super soggy with no fat rendered out. \n\nThe salad bar was pretty decent though ($30 for salad bar alone and no ayce meat). Some good salad options, the corn and edamame slaw was one of my favorites. There were also some charcuterie options with prosciutto, salami, and a variety of cheeses. I didn't get to try the soup since it was empty the whole time we were there, but maybe this just means it was really good. The watermelon was a nice way to end the meal but this was empty for awhile also. \n\nTldr: not much variety, really expensive, and pretty slow service. But great cheesy bread so definitely get that if you decide to go", "author": "Sam L."}

Unfortunately the beef ribs didn't come out until the very end this time around, but hey, sometimes life throws you a curve ball.\n\nLike most places downtown, you can find parking but it's either gonna cost you or take forever to find. It's not too far of a walk if you Bart in, and I believe the 12 drops you off pretty close as well. \n\nIt's overall a pretty nice and elegant establishment, but like most places in SF, jeans, sneakers and a polo will get you in without feeling out of place.", "author": "Andrew E."}

It was pretty disgusting and off putting.  The plates by the salad bar were no better, which led us to believe that it's a problem with whatever dishwashing machine they use.  This was quite disgusting.\n\nServers had to be reminded to bring drinks to the table several times.  Wait staff serving the meat here is a mixed crowd.  Some are happy to provide you with requested meat temperature and others were quite rude about it, with unnecessary comments to customers.  The whole experience was pretty bad.\n\nMeat quality also varied.  There was a high amount chewy meat, lots of gristle.  Sides were poorly executed when it came to mash potatoes, polenta fries, and cheese bread.  \n\nOverall, I will not be coming back to this Fogo in San Francisco due to poor execution of service, quality, and value.", "author": "Jay S."}

Despite there being over a dozen empty tables, they were making parties of 2 wait 15-20 minutes before seating (6 small groups were all waiting to be seated).  Once seated, our waiter quickly disappeared and did not pay attention to our table other than to bring 1 glass of wine sometime later.  Our water glasses were not refilled, our rolls were never refilled,  and we were never brought our sides - finally, when we were almost done I asked about them, and another waitress (not our waiter - he serviced a few other tables but kept ignoring us for some reason) and she apologized and then brought them out - she also confirmed that our waiter was supposed to have brought them out in the beginning.  Long story short, $70 per person,  $18 for one small glass of house red, and really lousy service.  I will not return to this location or tell my friends to visit.  If you're paying $158 (not including tip) for a dinner for 2, the service better be fan-freakin-tastic.  Very disappointed.", "author": "Joe R."}

It's an elegant contemporary room, prompt, friendly service, and excellent food.  My partner is vegetarian and they didn't bat an eye.  The \"market table\" is way more than just a salad bar - many interesting grain salads, pickled vegetables etc.  The meats were uniformly good and offer the full range of doneness from pink/medium rare to well done.  I only tried the various cuts of beef so can't speak to the chicken, pork, or lamb but those meats looked good. \n\nWe were there early on a weekday evening and the crowd was heavily business people (mostly men) who were attending a conference at Moscone.  Since it's a chain, and a steak place, I assume that's always going to be true.  They have several nice looking rooms in the back that can be sectioned off with sliding walls for semi-private dining for groups.  When we mentioned that we live nearby the servers and staff were even more attentive and friendly, which is appreciated.  \n\nOverall on the expensive side for the ambience, setting and food, but understandable when you go to an expense account restaurant.

Upon arrival and throughout the whole night there was no mention of the sort.  Being that's just a small fact I am only taking off a quarter of a star. However, any other place would acknowledge this fact, it's part of being hospitable and making people feel special (which they surely lack in).\n\nWe got seated in a corner by the windows and felt like we were a bit forgotten about throughout the night. The bread, polenta sticks, mashed potatoes and plantains didn't get to us until we were more than half way through our dinner (which took the full 2hrs). The reason we felt forgotten about was because when my boyfriend kept going to get veggies at the salad bar area, he would see guys with meats we hadn't seen come to our table the entire night. It wasn't until Blake came to our table with some meat that he asked if there was anything we hadn't gotten yet that we wanted to try. Now I don't know if he has telepathy or not but the fact that he even bothered asking us was a big bonus and the only real reason I am giving this place even 4 stars (2 ONLY because of him and the other 2 because the meats were tasty). I hope management finds a way to show him our appreciation because without his service to our table last night this review would have been a lot worse. Anyways, Blake sent over some of the guys who hadn't gotten to us yet and we finally got to taste a bit of everything. My favorites were the porkchop (it's like a tequila lime flavor - so juicy!) and the sirloin wrapped in bacon. The bread which is more like a cheese popover was delicious and the plantains and polenta sticks were amazing. \n\nAll this being said, if you want a better variation of meats you probably don't want to get sat at a booth near the windows.", "author": "marisa n."}

Fogo de Chao is an AYCE Brazillian steakhouse, which includes AYCE various types of meat, market table, and a few sides (mashed potatoes, polenta fries, fried plantains, and cheese bread). There are a good amount of servers coming to your table offering all types of meat. There is also a sign indicator on each table indicating whether you want the servers to keep coming to your table to keep serving you the meat. If it's green, the meat will keep coming. If it's red, it means you want to take a break from eating or you just want to stop eating. \n\nThe meats were definitely a miss in my books. Meat quality was not that great. Very chewy and fatty. The sad part is.. all the meats tasted the same. Nothing special at all.  Most of the meat were rare even when we asked for medium rare. FYI - if you're looking for the beef ribs, it's by request only. You're not really missing out though because it was also very fatty.. :(\n\nService was majority a miss. Our waitress rarely checked up on us. Not very attentive. We always had to flag someone down to refill our water or change our plates. I also didn't like the way the meat servers served. I felt like all the servers were in a rush trying to serve the meat. One server was so careless that whenever he finished cutting the meat, he would splash the blood/juice of the meat everywhere on the table. I was quite worried that it would get on my clothes. They need to work on the meat servers' training.\n \nIf you want good quality meat, please go to Espetus Brazillian Steakhouse in San Francisco or San Mateo.

The polenta fries and garlic mashed potatoes were tasty too.\n+ Selection of non-beef items.  I don't eat beef, and I did manage to get some pork chop and pork ribs, though I wasn't interested in the chicken.

The food wasn't good (especially the feijoadas - zero flavor or spice), the selection was tiny, and it was just generally not impressive.\n- Tres leches cake was overly sweet to the point where I couldn't even eat a bite.  And this is typically my favorite dessert at a restaurant.\n\nOverall it's a good dining experience.

I admit it's a gluttonous thought, an obscene one even, but who among us does not find a night of delicious meats, fresh sides, and caipirinhas with your #1 girl a heavenly experience?  \n\nAdd on the hospitality of the gracious staff, and that experience gets exponentially better. We couldn't have gotten luckier to have a southern gentleman as our main server. 5/5 stars to him for complimenting this feast. \n\nMy favorite is always the lamb. Fogo offers leg of lamb and lamb chops, and you can imagine they're dripping with juice and flavor. This meat is slightly smoky, slightly gamey, and encrusted in herbs and spices before it's slow roasted to decadent levels. Absolutely mouthwatering. They have an optional chimichurri that pairs nicely with it too, as well as with all the other meats.  \n\nI originally heard about Fogo from celebrities and the like raving about the other locations across California, Nevada, and New York. But now you're hearing it from me, just a regular guy who's in love with his woman and his churrascaria: go to this place if you have an appetite for a fancy, indulgent meal.

Our group of 3 couples (6) went to visit.\n\nThere are two main areas they seem to struggle with, the quality and type of meats as well as their staff. For this price bracket I expect you to do significantly better at both!\n\nThe staff issue began with the initial phone call to the venue. When calling, the person on the other end of the line simply stayed silent and then said hello. No introduction, highly unmotivated and not really helpful. Calling her out on this the person on the call indicated that they were sorry they weren't paying attention...!\n\nOn arrival we were seated but they seemed to be confused as when or how to guide us to the table. Once we arrived at our table the staff (who were genuinely nice) seemed to have no idea how to introduce themselves or the menu. It was the training that was the issue rather than the staff themselves.\n\nWe were given a super long introduction to the menu which was really fast, fall of pointless details and left everyone incredibly confused at what the server was trying to say. Considering we'd all been to a Brazilian BBQ before we already knew the drill and thankfully did not depend on the waitress. \n\nAs we were preparing to get up to go to the market stand another waitress comes to the table and attempts to provide the exact same introduction. It seems the training was poor as her method seemed to be very similar to the previous waitress. We informed her that we had been given the intro and will be fine. To which started an evening of two waitresses tending to our table, miss communicating and not knowing who has what order (mainly for drinks). One would take a drink order, the other will come back instantly and ask drinks again. \n\nRegarding the food, the market stand had the basic setup of items, but presentation wise it did not really seem to inspire and had nothing complex or adventurous as I have seen in various Brazilian BBQs around the world.\n\nThe meat selection seems to have been done rather poorly and I would question the head chef's skill. The meats did not meet the quality or taste that the price bracket Fogo is trying to perform in. We were also pushed really heavily by the guys that had the chicken and less desirable items. It almost seemed like they did not care for what you wanted by wanted to push on you the lesser valuable items far too heavily for the kind of establishment they seemed to be aiming for.\n\nOn a positive note, the cocktails were fantastic, very well done, they tasted great and we went through quite the selection to which we were pleased with every one.\n\nTo conclude, Fogo de Chao is attempting to play in a price bracket that calls for much better food and much better service. I expect a lot more from them, they have a good venue and a great bar, now they need to really focus on their staff training (hosts, waiting staff and meat servers) as well as the food!\n\nThis is like a boxing fighter clearly attempting to fight above their weight and just got knocked out in the first round, you need to either go back to your weight class or get act together!\n\nWill not return.", "author": "Shadi A."}

Their meat is higher quality. They have more variety both in terms of the market table and the meat dishes. The service at Espetus is better and faster.\n\nIf I were rating this place based only on food quality vs. value, I'd probably give it 3 stars, because it was still solid. However, there are a few other things that I thought were kinda dumb where this place loses more points:\n\n1. The drinks are way over-priced ($15 for a cocktail). - 1/2 star\n2. In a restaurant with a sitting capacity of 320 plus outdoor seating for 80, the men's bathroom only has 2 stalls and 1 urinal... in a restaurant that generally encourages stuffing yourself until you can barely walk. Really? - 1/2 star\n\nSo, yea, in case it wasn't clear, if you want to go to a high-end Brazilian steak house, go to Espetus instead.", "author": "Eugene A."}

As you can see, pretty big fan of the place. \n\nHowever, SF was like going to a different restaurant. I had last gone to fogo Vegas last November and man was it a good time. Their carmelized pineapple old fashion were amazing...so amazing that I had 7 that night (thank you uber!) \n\nFast track to SF fogo. Granted we walked in at 9 and they close at 10, but we still had a party of 9. The filet and ribeye were amazing, I would just wait for those. \n\nBut what made this experience so different?  Well first they told us they made the wrong drinks so the right ones would be coming shortly. 30 min later the drinks came and they weren't even the right ones!  But at this point we'd been waiting so long we didn't want to send them back (at $15/pop!!!). And during that time the waiters while nice and attentive also managed to drop whole pieces of filet on not one, but two of our party.  And another waiter also sliced some beef right off the skewer onto another member. \n\nWe got an apology for both the drinks and the fallen meats, but that was it. For $100/pp and a SF worker surcharge id hope to get the right drink and not to have food dropped on us.", "author": "A C."}

The service was very good. Bruna our waitress was superb and the service in general was very good.\n\nMy wife and I were concerned that the meat was going to be too salty from what we read in some reviews. This point is valid and some of the meats were indeed salty. This is due to the way Brazilians season their meats with coarse sea salt. The trick is to get the second slice of the cut and not the top slice. In general the meat is very tasty. \n\nSpeak up they will listen! If you want a more rare cut tell them. If well done is your thing tell the servers they will listen to you.\n\nMy wife is from Brazil and I lived there with her for 15 years. Not every Rodizio is going to be perfect but I can honestly say we truly enjoyed it and will go back. Maybe next time it won't be the same but for today it was very satisfying and we finally got all of the cuts of meat promised!", "author": "Luis H."}

We had reservations, but they were not prepared & we were left waiting while a larger group that had supposedly tried to change their reservations were all seated. Once seated, our table was decent & in a cozier area of the restaurant, which we liked.  As for our waiter he seemed nice enough, but hovered nearby a LOT, which was a bit uncomfortable.  We also had no idea what he was saying half the time & could barely understand him.  A bit awkward.\n\nThe food - meh. For the price paid for a meal, you'd expect the food to be delicious, or at least memorable. The salad bar area was ok - various cheeses & seasonal type salads/vegetables.  The meats were not great and weren't very flavorful - very chewy.  We've had better at other places, such as Texas de Brazil, which is what we were hoping this would have compared to.

I've been to several Fogos, and I also understand that this is a brand new spot (with new servers, cooks, gauchos, etc)... And because I'm familiar with the high Fogo standards, I was absolutely \"under-whelmed\" with our first experience. \nWe loved the decor and ambience, and appreciated the spacing between tables (different from most restaurants in SF). The hosts and servers were all very friendly and we understand the reasoning for an over-abundance of servers and employees being trained (we're not knocking that). We enjoyed the hospitality & friendliness of servers. \nThe disappointment was the food. The salad bar was missing a variety of items we'd normally find at other Fogos. I was actually shocked with the lack of options. (The chicken salad is always amazing). The greater surprise was the Feijoada and rice. The rice was not good at all, and the feijoada was nothing more than beans with a few extra pork cuts (definitely not our typical Brazilian classic). But other than the beans and rice, there were no other hot plates, other than the meats and mashed potatoes served at the table. \nAs far as meats, most Fogos have a little pamphlet explaining the different types of cuts, with 16-18 different cuts. This Fogo didn't provide the pamphlet and only about 9-10 cuts. We requested the rib eye and lamb chops, but received neither. After requesting the beef ribs, we did receive some and it was delicious!\nThe Parmesan pork was way too dry, and bacon-wrapped-mignon was way way way too salty and it didn't taste like mignon (more like the leftover meats, disguised as \"mignon\"... Lol). The picanha was perfect. Yum! The leg of lamb was disgusting! Yuck!! (And we were craving the lamb chops so bad.. Oh well). The bacon-wrapped chicken was good, but the other chicken didn't taste like the normal beer-marinated chicken we enjoy at Fogo. Overall, we were disappointed with the lack of options and the poor quality of the meats. The cheese breads and polenta were great. We ordered a caipirinha and server said the premium was a dollar more. They actually charged two dollars more ($17 total). Oh well... What's an extra dollar when your bill is already almost $200. \nIn conclusion, we trust the Fogo brand and will definitely come back in the future. Because this store is only a week old, it's understandable that the food quality (and variety) is still not up to par. It definitely was not worth the nearly $200 bill (party of two). As far as value goes, in SF, Espetus is a much better option for the next few weeks/months. But I have faith that Fogo will soon up their game, and I will also increase my Yelp stars!", "author": "JonJon W."}

We're gone to the location in Santana Row a few times, which we enjoyed but being that the drive is long, we decided to see how this location stacked up, in spite of the many lack luster reviews. Upon arriving, we were quickly greeted and seated. Offered the choice of waters (always specify Tap) and decided we were just going to take a break from meat and went with the Market Salad bar for $18 pp. Although, there were some good options at the bar such as the fresh fruits; grapefruit and orange salad, fresh papaya and pineapple slices, I was so disappointed by the chicken salad as it was nothing like the delicious one at the Santana Row location, with shredded moist chicken and apples. The cheese bread was also lukewarm and stale tasting 2/3 times we asked for a fresh batch. It took the third time to finally get it hot and we were already full by then.  I also needed to comment that I noticed this location was serving grilled pineapple after having been told by the other location that they didn't serve that there at all. What a bummer!\n\n-Anyway, food was just 3 stars\n-service was a good 4.5 stars\n-the quality of food for the price about 3.5 stars\n\nI gave 3 stars overall (more like 3.5 if it was an option) due the convenient location and attentive service we were given.

Since we came in a party, there was a prix fix menu for $99 a person (before tax and tip). This included 3 hours at the table, unlimited meat, salad bar, two drinks a person and dessert. \n\nPros:\n1. Salad bar was great. Their candied bacon is honestly some of the best I've ever had.\n2. Their dessert was really delicious. The cheesecake was scrumptious. \n3. Ambiance: very swanky place. Very clean, the staff was super attentive/friendly. Its also a very large establishment. Great for large groups.\n\nCons: \n1. All the cuts of meat, even the higher grade ones, were all on the drier/chewier side. I love a great steak, and I did not have anything at the restaurant that I could not make better myself honestly. I asked for every cut rare, and a lot of them were medium at best. There was a chicken Parmesan cut that was horrendously dry. The only meat I can say that was good were the sausages, and my lamb. (I say mine because I got a great cut of lamb, meanwhile my fiance got a super dry and tough piece). \n\n2. the drinks: we were allowed 2 drinks each. I assumed this meant any cocktail off the menu, but when I asked the waiter, he looked puzzled and kept trying to offer their caipirinhas. So we had two. After two drinks, both my fiance and I felt incredibly hungover, and we are not light drinkers. I feel like the booze used in the drinks was shitty quality. \n\n\nTLDR: basically, for the price, I would much rather go to a great steakhouse, and have a wonderful cut of steak instead. I didn't think this was the price. Yes it is a ton of food, but the quality wasn't anything impeccable.", "author": "Anastasiya V."}

The best cut is probably the rib eye, but even then it was too too salty. \n\nFor a high end place, I found the salad bar very lacking, even if the restaurant is known for AYCE meats.\n\nLastly the price / value ratio is just not there, $180 for two people for dinner, each only had 1 drink (milk + coffee) and a dessert (molten chocolate cake, which was actually the surprising highlight of the meal).

You begin with the market bar buffet that includes cold cut meats, salads, cheese, and more. There also is soup and rice near the bar. Afterwards, when you are ready for meat, you flip your circle placard so it's green and that allows servers to know you would like meat. Once the card is green, servers carrying meat approach and offer you these meats. It's fun because they carve the meat right in front of you if you decide to have some. The experience was really fun and once I flipped my card, I swear I was soon surrounded by servers carrying many delicious meats. Some of my favorites would include the sirloin cap, fillet mignon, and their special steak (I forgot what it's called). When we went, it was my parents' anniversary and they brought out a complimentary dessert- chocolate molten cake with vanilla ice cream- because of this occasion. If you ever come on an occasion, make sure to let the servers know!! The dessert was super good and helped end the night on such a great note.

Sadly, after watching my entire family finish their dinner, I still hadn't seen anything come my way.

A couple of minutes later, he comes with a sea bass plate which was barely warm which I decided not to return because the rest of my family was done.

Kristen our server was great, she explained the best way to experience it for the first time. You get a little coaster to flip over to signal if you want more meats, or if you'll pass. She suggested keeping it red while we have some meat already, and then flipping it green occasionally when we see something good we want to try. We got at least 1 or 2 of everything. There was so much to choose from. Amazing selection. Prime rib, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, crispy chicken drumsticks, pork sausage, chicken hearts (I never had these before & I figured, \"why the hell not, I'll try it now\" and they were pretty interesting. Chewy, but it tastes like chicken), lamb chops, pork ribs, and a bunch more that I cannot even remember. It was an amazing experience to have these guys just walk out every 5-10 mins passing by and bringing us a variety of meats.\nThe price is pretty reasonable. About $60 a person. We went for dinner. Included in that is a salad bar with cold cuts, potato salad, croutons, veggies, cheeses, and other stuff. They also bring out polenta, mashed potatoes, and fried bananas to your table. My fianc\u00e9 and I loved the mashed potatoes & polenta. The bananas were a bit too sweet to be eaten as a side dish with the meats in my opinion, they were better a palate refresher at the end of the meal.\nAll of the servers were friendly. Kristen offered great service &  all the guys who ran out with meats were helpful & would even ask us if we wanted them to bring out a new prime rib that was cooked more to our liking.\nWe know the capirinha is the Brazilian cocktail, so we had to try it. I had the strawberry capirinha &  my fianc\u00e9 tried the classic, premium capirinha. They were delicious, a little refreshing. Although, we were already pretty buzzed, we drank a bit before we got here.\nWe were so stuffed, but we still wanted to try a dessert. We had the turtle cheesecake. It was good. Crust was standard, a little crumbly. Topped with caramel, chocolate & nuts. There could've been more nuts & chocolate. It was mostly a caramel cheesecake.\nWe came to the city to check out the SFMOMA, which is just a couple blocks down. We took BART and got off at Montgomery. It wasn't too far of a walk, definitely beats trying to find parking.\nMy recommendation, make reservations ahead of time, and take it easy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-21", "description": "Fogo de Ch\u00e3o recently opened downtown near SF MoMA and the Convention Center to a meat-filled fanfare.  I will admit that I had never had much interest in the Brazilian Steakhouse \"Churrasco\" experience because it always felt a bit gimicky to me, but I was, ahem, game, to try Fogo de Ch\u00e3o on the eve of their grand opening.  What I didn't realize is that I was entering into an orgiastic meat frenzy that, at times, was overwhelming, but once I figured out that there was a method to the sumptuous madness, I was able to let the experience flow over me.  You will see that it's easy to get overwhelmed here because there is a constant buzz of overtly hospitable servers carrying skewers of sizzling, juicy, dripping grilled meats throughout the restaurant and immediately upon sitting you are tempted by offerings of a bevy of side dishes. I was confused. There was no explanation of the night's specials (because there aren't any), and there was no attitude-laden hipster server trying to sell you over priced wine. Instead, these professional meat handlers ready to push you into the deep end of a pool of grilled delights.   You see, what wasn't clear to me is that the \"Full Churrasco Experience\" includes sides AND the meat entrees AND the Market Table (which is basically the best salad bar you'll ever see). Wow. Where's the diving board?\n\nOK, so here's what you do: order a glass of wine (I suggest a bold Malbec), have a few sips, take a 20151222_181049breath and the hand of your lovely dining partner and then head on over to the Market Table. Circle around it a few times before you put anything on your plate as you will be \"ooohhhing and aaaahhhhing\" the multitude of offerings as you decide what you want.\n\nThen come back to your table to enjoy your plateful of yumminess, but 20151222_184356pay attention to the little table cards you were given because if they are green side up it means it is a GO! for meat and they will keep stopping by your table asking you if want some of this steak or that steak or this pork or that pork wrapped in bacon or this chicken also wrapped in bacon or this lamb chop or, wait, I think there is one more type of steak!\n\nIt's just so hard to say NO to the charming meat-carrying Latin men! Then the eating endorphines kick in, the lips get greasy, the tongue craves a Malbec wash-down, its a furious fervor of meaty craziness to the point where you simply neglect to reach over and turn that damn green coaster over to RED for STOP! STOP THE MEAT! If only for a moment, so I can check my pulse and have four words with my dining companion, whom I have neglected until now because I have been distracted by the beautiful Sirens of meat, calling me, the weary and hungry sailor, to shore, where I crash onto the rocks in a meat-induced coma...\n\nTo that, I would suggest that this type of dining restaurant is actually NOT ideal for a romantic night out - there is just way too much stimuli that makes this experience unique that I don't think it makes for an intimate conversation on Date Night. I DO think it is a wonderful and special experience that is well suited for a dinner party of 4-8 who want to be loud and social and pleasantly distracted. I also think it makes for a great business dinner with an important client you wish to impress, but I don't think its perfectly suited for a family dinner or impressing the new love of your life, who may end up feeling jealous that you love your steak more than her.\n\nOK, so, now fast for two days, make a reservation, and head over to Fogo de Chao, and let the experience overwhelm you in wonderful ways....", "author": "Joel B."}

I live in Chicago and I eat at this restaurant quite frequently and the service is absolutely amazing, the food taste spectacular, and they make sure your plate is always full if your card is flipped green. However, this isn't the great service I experienced in San Francisco. I reserved a table for 9:30 PM, arrived 5 minutes early, didn't get seated until about 9:50PM. Once we got seated we got the regular \"have you been here before...\" chat. There after, I immediately flipped my card green because that's what I always do. I didn't get steak for about 5 minutes. I finally got my first piece and I couldn't wait. It was medium rare, but for some reason this medium rare wasn't as cooked as Chicago's. It was very bloody, and although the steak was hot, it wasn't so tasty. After that piece I didn't see another for around 8 minutes. I got medium and it wasn't bloody at all, but too cooked. Taste was better though. After that, I only saw one more guy, and that was it for steak. Later I was asked if I wanted anything and I said \"yes, STEAK PLEASE, Lamb chops. Where is everything?\" It wasn't till about 20 minutes into the restaurant they brought out the Cheese bread, and fried bananas and so on. And that was only because I reminded them too. Service was sadly and very unfortunately terrible. I must have caught them on their bad night. This restaurant ruined my dinner Saturday night in San Fransisco.", "author": "Billal M."}

Anyone that knows me, know that I love my meat and Fogo de Chao (FdC) does not disappoint.  \n\nIf I had written this review last month, I would've given it 5 stars.  But the last two times service has started to gone down a bit.  \n\nLast Saturday (AUG 6), our server came by and was initially extremely friendly.  But when he asked us what experience we were there for we told him we were there for the \"Taste of Brazil\" which is $39/pp (but you don't get all the cuts of meat: no Beef Ribs, Rib Eye, Filet Mignon, Bacon-Wrapped Filet Mignon, or Lamb Chops - only one we cared about was the Rib Eye, but for ~$15/pp it was ok).  He asked us what we wanted to drink and we asked for a little time to look at the wine menu.  After a couple minutes we were ready to order our wine.  10 minutes later, no server.  Another server came by and asked if we had been helped, since we still had all the menus on the table (w/them closed - what we think is the standard tell tell that you're ready to order), we told her that someone did come by.  She said great and left.  She came by about 7 minutes later and our menus hadn't moved... needless to say the other guy never came back.  She asked if she could get us our drinks, so we ordered with her.  A couple minutes later she comes back to tell us our wine was sold out.  We picked another bottle.  After she had come back, uncorked and poured our wine and we had time to have 2-3 sips... our original waiter finally came back to check on us.  We were soooo thankful for the other server.  She was not only friendly, but also on her game ( and we weren't even her table).\n\nTypically the various meat selections come out on a steady basis.  The last two times it was much slower.  And last Saturday (our non rib eye night), the rib eye only came by one time (in the 1.5 hrs we were there), which I guess is good for us, since we couldn't have any.  We typically are in and out within 45 mins... but with the wait to order our wine and the lack of meat coming out, our visit was prolonged by a full 45 mins!!\n\nAlso, FdC was the only churrasqueiro in the bay area that continually asked us how we liked our meat.  Which we completely appreciated since I like my meat more on the rare side.  We only had one guy asked us how we liked our meat on Saturday night.. almost everything else came out medium.  I even tried to ask for rare from one of the guys, not sure if he didn't hear me, but that piece turned out medium too.  \n\nDespite last Saturday's #fail, I still give FdC 4 stars.  Hopefully that experience was not indicative of how FdC intends on operating moving forward.  Hopefully it was just a bad day for everyone.  I have faith it'll be better in the future.  I look forward to writing an updated review.\n\nHappy eating!", "author": "Tina F."}

I had been looking forward to coming to Fogo de Chao with a big group of co-workers and intentionally had a plain salad for lunch so I could thoroughly enjoy the experience. Having been to Fogo de Chao in LA once before, I knew what I was up against.  Challenge accepted. With a group of 12, we were all eager to get to the meat after sitting down.  A few of us made the conciliatory effort to get some vegetables in before going all out on meat, and I was one of those \"weirdos\" who chose to throw in some sauteed zucchini, green salad, and marinated mushrooms on my plate before turning my coaster from red to green.  In starting with the meat pile, they first brought the Picanha aka Top Sirloin.  Throughout the entire meal, this was definitely my favorite, and I took almost every opportunity to get a few shavings when it came around.  I also tried the Fraldinha which was hit or miss; some pieces that were closer to being medium/medium rare were delicious, while other parts of it were way too overcooked.  I also really enjoyed the Linguica pork sausages and thought they were a great way to shake up the beef pile.  All in all, I wasn't really sure what to expect from Fogo de Chao, but it was actually a lot of fun and an incredibly filling experience.  I'd love to come back with a big group again!", "author": "Lisa I."}

In this case, Fogo de Chao was a huge let down.  My wife, son and myself were visiting San Francisco and staying at the St Regis which was within walking distance to the restaurant.  I have never eaten at Fogo de Chao but have always wanted to, I love Brazilian food and also love good beef.  We started with the salad bar, chose a few items, none of which were anything spectacular or anywhere near being worth the value of the meal but I figured the meats would make up for that.  The meats started making their rounds and it was bad. Chewy, dry and flavorless.  The cuts were no better than even the lowest grade cuts you can find such as round steak or top sirloin. I know good beef and this is not good beef.  Anyone that thinks these guys have good quality beef is not very experienced in choosing great steak.  To top it off, they overcharge for the meal, not just a little either.  A single meal of this quality should max out at $30 a plate and even that would be high.  If you know your steak, stay away and just go buy a good Top loin, top blade or tenderloin somewhere else and for less money too.", "author": "Mister H."}

Maybe one was flavorful (a garlic meat) and I didn't have to chew it 30 times to swallow it. The bacon wrapped filet mignon was the toughest thing I've put in my mouth in a while (that's what she said). It just wasn't good, so I didn't eat much.\n4) The service was strange. Always interruptions and the meat would get cold fast. Drinks (wine and cocktail) were served after we had already been to the buffet and gotten asked if we wanted 4 different meats...a little late. Also mashed potato, polenta fries and banana were served almost at the end of the meal randomly. They were COLD.\n5) Not worth the price AT ALL.

My son requested medium to medium well rib eye and after the chicken thighs, sausage, bottom sirloin, bacon wrapped chicken, garlic sirloin (all rare to medium rare and flavorless) came the extra rare rib eye.  The courteous man with the rib eye came by one time - and was then seen with the lesser cuts of meat. After the family was completely full, the manager came by. To her credit she did check on us - it was totally after the fact.  Even though we got a whopping $85 off our bill - I was not happy with the total bill given the flavorless, lower cuts of meat.

We have even visited the south beach location 2 months ago. \nThe restaurant was pretty and decor was nice.\nThere were many open tables - yet we were given the table by the kitchen ( worst table in the house ) noisy and the wait staff stands there and you feel like you are being watched your whole dining experience ...advice ( do not accept that table).\nSo we go to the unlimited salad bar first after placing our drink order- large plates could not be found ... Had to ask 2 people to find them . The rice on the hot bar was close to empty not a good sign . \nWe go back to our table and 2 napkins were missing not to mention a whole place setting .\nWe turn the card to green as we were ready for the meats. Most of the meat was rare..we asked several people for meat that was medium - very hard to find . My sons Shirley temple was not delivered to the table with the other drinks had to ask and realized the waiter had forgotten to bring it. Since we frequent other locations we realized at that point the incredible rolls plantains and mashed potatoes were missing ... We asked the waiter and he immediately apologized. We received the missing items right away...( note if this had been our first experience we would not have known this was missing ). The sad part was that the rolls were cold and hard ... ( they are supposed to be warm and soft) . We returned them 3x and realized they would not get them right- disappointing .\nThe waiter seemed bothered that we weren't satisfied which made our experience uncomfortable .\nNow on to the meats... Maybe and I am being nice we were offered 4 things: chicken with bacon, filet mignon, spare ribs and Sausage - the portions they sliced were molecular in comparison to other locations ... Chicken and bacon were circulated so much yet the other meats could not be found ... I had 2 waiters ask me if there was a particular cut I was waiting for since my card was still green ... Well yes- where were the lamb chops, the ribeye all the other meats ??\nEvery location I have been to - I have had to physically turn my card over as there is too much meat ... I was actually starving at this location as where was the food-it was ridiculous \nThe manager Ryan was the best thing this restaurant had going for it as he listened to all my complaints apologized and got me some medium cooked lamb chops but at that point I honestly was annoyed and our experience was already ruined. My husband had filled up on all the chicken and sausage as he was starving  and there were really very little meats to choose from- shocking \nThe dessert - ice cream was not high quality and my husband thought their cheesecake was awful.\nBathroom- beautiful but dirty and no toilet paper in my stall so clearly it was not being kept up on.\nI started laughing at this point as I never thought the bathroom would be part of this review.\nThe manager Ryan did comp my meal and my husbands meal and provided us a gift card to use when we get back to LA- we did not know this was there 5th day open although it shouldn't have mattered. I recommend staying away from this location till they get up to speed as this was truly a very disappointing experience .\nI am giving it 2 stars as one for the beautiful decor and the other for Ryan the manager doing the right thing as good customer service is proven only when there is an issue .", "author": "Alyssa B."}

A good Brazilian steak is prepared with coarse salt and, maybe, pepper. Anyway, you can add anything you want afterwards but the idea is to taste the meat, that has to be of excellent quality. The \"salad bar\" has more than salads and you will find the big \"palmitos\"(heart of palm), and other Brazilian delicacies.\nUnfortunately, the \"farofa\" (another tradicional Brazilian dish) is bad: it doesn't taste homemade. They should serve a fresh \"farofa de ovo\" that is the most popular, but only Brazilians would miss this. As for the service, if you are Brazilian, expect to talk to friendly hosts and servers, as we all do (:-).\nTIP1: MAKE A RESERVATION! You can do it on-line. You will not have to wait and you will start eating immediately from the salad bar, that includes a small feijoada and some warm plates.\nTIP2: Tell the waiter what is your favorite meat and they will bring it to you more often.

Just come with an empty stomach and a big appetite and you'll walk out so satisfied that you can't even walk!\n\nDon't spoil yourself with the appetizers and salad bar. I do suggest getting some of your veggies in since you'll be consuming majority meat. \n\nSalmon and cheese wins my heart at the salad bar and the house meats were definitely my favorite. Make sure to let your cutter how you like your meat. You can't go to a steak house without trying rare and medium rare, thats where all the flavor is!\n\nDrinks were great! My recommendations are Premium Caipirinha(very refreshing) and the Old Fashion Pineapple\n\nDessert: Tres Leches Cake!!!!!! I've tried a bit of each cake, key lime, chocolate, cheesecake. I ended up eating 3/4 of the giangantic trea leches cake, but stop myself realizing i'll probably regret it afterwards.", "author": "Michael L."}

The best Brazilian churrascaria I've experienced to date. Top notch service, impressive bar for the sides, and everything was sooooo tasty. My favorites meats were the top sirloin, lamb medallions, and filet mignon. Hubby also really enjoyed the prime rib and lamb lollipops. And the drinks! And the dessert! I kept thinking all evening how they managed to always bring out every meat cooked to perfection. Good thing our evening date continued with a little stroll around another destination after dinner--I was stuffed at the end of it all. The food was definitely plentiful and oh, so delicious. I had been wanting to go here since they opened this location in 2015, and am so happy we finally put it on the calendar. The decor also makes an impact from the moment you walk in and all throughout dinner. All of the servers and gauchos were superb, and the manager also came around to check in with us. Thanks, Stewart/Stuart (sp?), for my husband's birthday dessert on the house, and letting the kitchen know to surprise him with an extra dressed up dessert plate. What a lovely gesture that delighted us. You and all of the staff made our evening so special. We will definitely be back.", "author": "Julie L."}

We decided to bring along the kids even thought they are not meat eaters since the website states on the pricing page that children ages 6 through 12 are half price.  Our kids eat like birds, but for the chance of the experience we were willing to pay $15 per child for them to eat basically nothing.  The waiter told us that the kids were half price.  \n\nThe 3 adults went for the full experience.  The market table vegetables, fruits and cheeses were fresh and healthy.  The picanha was delicious.  I found the other meats to be chewy and salty -- I would skip all the other meats except the picanha.  \n\nWhen the bill arrived we were surprised to see the full-price market table dinners for the kids.  I assumed it was a mistake and told our waiter that we had been charged full price for the kids.  He said \"yes, they are full price if you get the market table.\"  I responded that my daughter ate an apple and slice of pineapple and my son had one plate of vegetables.  The website clearly states on the pricing page that children ages 6-12 are half-price (no caveat listed for market table).  Also, the waiter told us the kids would be half price.  He did not state that they would only be half-price if they ordered the full experience.  I voiced my concerns to the waiter and he just said \"I'm sorry but that is our policy.\"  I was ready to write a negative yelp review, but decided it would be better to talk to the restaurant first -- I don't want to blame the entire restaurant on what could have been the mistake of a new waiter.  I know this is a new location so I figured the waiters may not know all the rules.  \n\nI e-mailed the restaurant and received zero response.  If you decide to go to this restaurant, just leave the kids at home.", "author": "Amanda H."}

One of the cuts my guest had (she requested a medium-well slice) was completely uncooked on one side and just flooded her plate with blood and juices.  The cuts I received tended to be chewy and dry.  The meats at this location are bad, not just in comparison to other Fogo De Chao's, but just in comparison to even a basic steak house.

NO shrimp, bacon wrapped filets, pork, etc. like they served at the Houston Brazilian steakhouses. All in all pretty underwhelming.\n\nGarlic steak was pretty good but most of the rest of the meats tasted the same. Wines and desserts were well overpriced as well so we skipped on them. Service was good and folks brought meat around when you flipped the indicator.\n\nMy guess is they get a good business clientele w/ expense accounts and being near Moscone center so charging too much, providing a limited choice of meats, and overpriced drinks works well enough that you don't mind having too many repeat customers. \n\nWhen I think of some of the amazing meals I've experienced at a similar price-point to this one, it really becomes clear that this place is nothing even remotely special.", "author": "Ross J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-24", "description": "LOCATION - Small, a little cramped.  With the market table buffet you with think they would have wider lanes between tables for people moving to and from the market table.  That being said, if they try to sit you at one of those small tables near the market table either ask for a different table or be aware you will be in a high traffic area with people probably squeezing by you.  Nothing cool about someone's butt brushing the back of your head or something.  Thankfully I was in a booth but felt bad for those couples you could tell were on a date dealing with all that.  Also, the entrance is small and narrow and everyone waiting for a table looked uncomfortable.  I recommend making reservations whenever possible.  Other than being small, I do like the decor.  Views out the windows are of traffic and bums, but unfortunately that's most of San Francisco now.\n\nMARKET TABLE BUFFET - Some of my favorites were the olives, mushrooms, blood oranges with mint, apple salad, caesar salad, salami, and smoked salmon.  Very flavorful.  You can tell quality ingredients were used.  Really recommend the apple salad - fresh, light and crispy.  I did not see any dishes empty or any dishes that looked like they had been sitting for a while.  \n\nTHE MEATS - Again, you can tell the quality of ingredients used.  Tender, juicy and flavorful.  It's hard to be disappointed at a Brazilian steakhouse because there are so many options, but every cut here was perfect.  My wife and I like medium - well temperature.  We asked one of the servers, just once, if he wouldn't mind coming back when he had a piece that was a little more well.  All it took was mentioning that just once and he must have communicated that to the other servers who already knew when they came our way to offer us the more \"done\" ends of meat.  Great service.  \nOur favorites were the bacon wrapped filet, prime sirloin and chicken drummets.  I also like the garlic sirloin and if I had to say I had a least-favorite it would be the parmesan steak.  Just didn't like that particular mix of flavors.  The steaks were cooked to perfection - seared, crispy char on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside.  \n\nThe only reason I can't give a 5-star rating is because I've been to their Atlanta, GA location so I know that as good as this place is, it can be better.  The Atlanta location was perfect beginning to end and this location came up just a little short when compared.  But don't get me wrong, this place is great and a must-try.", "author": "Chino Z."}

Service however leaves a lot to be desired. We made a reservation for 2 and when we arrived our table wasn't ready yet. That's ok- we went to the bar where neither  bartender even acknowledged our presence for the 10 minutes we were sitting there. Our pre-dinner cocktail never happened. Actually was never even ordered! As for our table- we ended up tucked away in a table towards the back that was fairly out of view and dwarfed by a large party next to us. The large table seemed to wait for nothing- a waiter was at their side whenever they seemed to need for anything. For us- not so much. We ordered our cocktails as soon as we sat down. We did not receive our drinks for 35 minutes. That is not an exaggeration. We figured they forgot them and since we barely saw a waiter we figured they forgot and just drank our water. When they finally arrived (as we were nearing the ending of our dinner) we said we weren't so sure we even wanted them. The waiter was able to comp them which was nice but I'd rather pay for the drinks and have them arrive when  I order them. My boyfriend asked no less than 3 waiters who came by to send over the bacon wrapped chicken. At least 15 minutes before we saw him. Only thing they were quick about was the check. I'll say this- \"team\" wait service doesn't work. If everyone is in charge no one is.

We held dinner reservations for 2 and my associate is disabled w MS. Dinner and the service she applied tonight were over the moon. She helped her to her seat with ease and compassion. which she cried but wait that's not all throughout the meal every staff person allowed her to photograph service and took the time to explain the menu and items at the stations. Even the gaucho servers took their time with her. This is first time we have been to dinner. She was extremely nervous about being a bother. Miley at the end of a very well orchestrated dinner service called us a taxi and PICKED her up from her chair i truly mean  UP AND CARRIED HER TO THE TAXI then placed her inside. Like it was nothing oMG i have never been so impressed with the display of compassion for another human being it was beyond the five stars the restored my love on NON FRANCHISED restaurants.

Usually we do not expect much from the staff of a brand new restaurant, but we were impressed with the SF staff. The service was impeccable from the hostess who checked us in to bartenders and our waiter- Carlos. The bartenders are well trained and knows their liquor. Amazing especially when they were just trained about a week ago. Watching the servers who also doubles roasters moving & working in sync is a show in itself. Amazing that they know exactly when to take out the meat with each server/roaster  moving in/out of the 'kitchen' like ants hard at work. The salad bar is fantastic for non-meat eater. There is a brown sugar maple bacon that is to die for!!!! We loved the meat because it is not covered up with all kinds of herb/spice. They season it lightly without taking away the true taste of the meat ..and loved that we did not leave needing to quench our thirst. Save room for the dessert - loved the cheesecake and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e ! Make sure you get the picanha, New York & filet mignon!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-11-25", "description": "I probably would have given this another star to be generous but by the end of our meal the irritation factor had me feeling like they only deserved one star. The decor is nice and the layout is such that the noise level is held to a pleasant level for conversation even though the space feels quite open which usually makes for a louder environment. The salad bar was laid out nicely and it was clean and well stocked. The salad dressings were all bad. They tasted like cheap bottled dressing and even the Caesar dressing was sweet. The salad bar would get 3 stars the dressing 1 star. This place is expensive and their menu leads you to believe that there's a reason they charge what they do, however the reality was sadly lacking. The wait staff service was almost non existent I kept my wine glass because I decided I might splurge on a glass of red once the meal got underway. It was probably 45 minutes before I was able to get the attention of a server (not ours) and request a glass. The meats that were brought around were for the most part cheaper cuts certainly not the filet mignon the menu boasted. Never saw pork roast and leg of lamb didn't come around until we'd been there an hour or more. What did come around 4 or 5 times was the house specialty which was a folded steak that varied between quite tough to pretty ok but didn't have a lot of flavor. The best cut was a bottom round. They had turkey at a side board but it was brined and bordered on lunch meat. At the very end of our meal they came around with a bacon wrapped filet mignon nugget. It was a dry hard lump of gristle that bore no resemblance to filet mignon. No one ever came around to see if I wanted a second glass of wine or anything else for that matter. No dirty plates were cleared as the meal progressed. We sat forever after our meal was done before our original server came around to ask halfheartedly if we wanted dessert. We asked if the dessert was complimentary  (someone on yelp posted their tab that showed complimentary dessert). She said that it was so we figured what the heck. We didn't have much hope that the dessert would be good but since it was included in the price of the meal we decided to give it a try. The desserts were as canned tasting as the salad dressings. 30 minutes later after we flagged someone down to beg for our tab, our waitress brought our bill and we were charged full price for the desserts. After another long wait she finally came back and we questioned the charge since we only ordered because she said it was complimentary. She asked if it was a special occasion and as it turned out we there for a birthday (and it was Thanksgiving). She took the bill away and some time later it was brought back by someone else with one charge removed. We were there for a total of 2 1/2 hours maybe a bit more. A grueling length of time to spend over mediocre food and truly lousy service. I would gladly have skipped the $25 spent on bad dessert and the extra 40 minutes we spent there that we could have spent enjoying ourselves over a really nice cup of coffee somewhere else. By the time I left I was in a really bad mood--not the way you want to feel after dropping $200 on a meal for 2", "author": "Patricia B."}

I had been wanting to try them out for a while now, but just hadn't made it in yet. One of my friends knows the manager there (shout out to Mayley, thank you for making our dining experience fun and memorable!) so we asked for her upon arrival since we wanted to introduce ourselves. She brought us to our table and not only started us off with complimentary round of their delicious signature Caipirinhas but also a tasty sauteed prawn appetizer! Extremely generous gesture and made us feel welcomed immediately. \nThe salad bar is over the top, quite an impressive selection of fresh veggies, cheeses and charcuterie...but I was trying my best to save room for all of the meat. \nWe enjoyed our app and salads and then it was time for the main course. As soon as we flipped over our card to green the Gauchos started approaching at our table with fresh cuts of every type of meat imaginable. From top sirloin to rib rye, tender filet mignon and bacon wrapped chicken, they certainly did not disappoint. I was pacing myself since I, of course, had to taste them all. Mayley also brought out a side of their house-made chimichurri sauce, nothing short of amazing - highly recommend to go with the steak. The bartender even recommended red wines to pair with our entrees, I tried their own label (Fogo de Chao) malbec - super smooth and paired perfectly with the meats. \nAfter a flavorful and enjoyable dining experience, we moved to the bar for dessert and a night cap. Overall, Fogo de Chao succeeds in all the important categories -- from service, to atmosphere and of course the high quality food. I highly recommend adding this to the top of you SF restaurant list, you definitely won't be disappointed.", "author": "Alison W."}

First, they gave us the worst table in the house, literally next to the kitchen entrance. We had reservations and did not walk it. Figured with reservation they would put us at a better location but I guess not. Second, I think their salad bar selection was not as good/large as the Espetus. Third, and most important, their servers did not let us try out all their meats. They kept bringing us the same selections of meats over and over again, while other meats like parmesan pork they never brought by. We finally noticed all these other meats going around and had to ask them to bring it over, but by then we were pretty full already so it wasn't very enjoyable. The whole point is trying out all the meats but their system of bringing the meats over left us only with half the selection.", "author": "Tinou B."}

We received a complementary \"lunch or dinner\" according to the sleeve of the gift card; which I always appreciate.  I am not a big \"coupon\" user, but this restaurant sounded attractive to my husband and I, since he works nearby in SF.  I noticed the card itself, stated \"lunch\".  So I phoned and asked, anticipating that b/c of what the initial writing stated, they'd honor it for dinner as well.  Not so: according to a fairly apathetic employee who I spoke with, mid-afternoon, so I assume it wasn't too busy.  \nNOT a great first impression, for a fairly new restaurant in SF!

It was a Tuesday during noon,  it took 15 minutes to seat a party of 5. I should have saw the warning signs when we got seated. You are literally back to back with other people. There is no personal space. Even if there are other tables, they will seat you in one area for their own convenience. Our server greeted us and asked if what we would like to drink-- we never got them so after 15 minutes we had to ask another server for our drinks. The soda we had was in a tiny glass bottle. The second soda was the standard can. Why am I paying for the little one when I can get the big one? Overall, the service was terrible. I had my green sign on for 20 minutes at one point and no on came to me. Eventually someone noticed and asked what cut I would like, and even so it took another 10 minutes for me to get son meat on the table. So much more expensive than Espetus. Save your money and stress and eat somewhere where they actually care about the customers. One star for a decent wait time and another star for mediocre food.

I went here yesterday with 15 of my colleagues and was promptly seated as we arrived.  Bar one guest, We all ordered the lunch (meats brought to the table) with the other guest ordering fish.  It took 30-40 mins for the fish to arrive, during which time my colleague was offered a bite off my plate to try the meat and to stave her hunger a little.  Immediately, the maitre d' stepped forward and explained that if we continue to share food we would be charged another lunch plate (@ $36.95 plus tax)!  Unbelievable(she took the order so knew we were waiting for her meal) and embarrassing to be admonished in this way in front of colleagues!  I should mention the fish meal was more expensive than the lunch @ $42.95 plus tax, MUCH smaller (like a McDonald fillet!) and not sure if related but the guest was ill later that evening.  The entire bill excluding alcoholic beverages came to $989.54 for 15 people, so you can see we were not trying to get a free meal! As I'm giving a review.... the selection of meats on the menu were not all available or had to be asked for specifically and all were a little oily and fatty. The salad bar was excellent as were the wait staff in general. Deserts took another 30 mins to arrive after ordering and came with a free thick (pubic?) hair. Particular desert was replaced (less the hair) but not comped or coffee on house nothing. \n\nWas it busy? Only what you would expect at a downtown restaurant at lunch time next to the conference center, and the main reason for choosing this higher end restaurant was it was of a size/ rating I thought they could handle that easily. As I said before I work for the 2nd largest employer in the Bay area of which I mentioned to the person I spoke with today when I called to voice my concerns.  While apologetic, again my expectations were not met (at least the cost of the fish and desert to be discounted back to the card) but no offer made except reasons why they were not up to par.  If it's too hot in the kitchen .......!\n\nThe ambiance was nice and food nice but will we recommend to our faculty ... probably, but with notes from our experience and no if the attendees are business guests or people of note.\n\nUPDATE: Just checked the receipt, we actually did get charged an extra lunch at $36.95!

Our first experience was on a Saturday night and I was blown away at how busy they were. The place was humming and everyone seemed to be thoroughly enjoying themselves. Surprisingly we got seated pretty quickly and quickly had a waiter come to ask us had we been there before. The choices are Market Table (salad bar), the full meat with salad bar or fish. Everywhere you see the servers walking from the kitchen around the restaurant with their skewers of fresh sizzling meat. They start you off with the traditional Brazilian light & fluffy cheese breads without you even asking. My wife got the meat with salad bar & I had to try the fish (sea bass). The Market Table was as beautiful as it was tasty with many high quality options. While it was easy to fill up on salad you know that something special is coming so don't get carried away. They were out of our selected merlot half bottle but we were happy with the cabernet substitute. They bring you unlimited cheese bread & sides of mashed potatoes, fried potenta sticks & carmelized bananas (apparently a meal staple in Brazil).Don't come here when you are in a hurry. Take your time to savour the ambiance, the different food courses and and beautiful evening. OK, so it was raining outside, but inside, we felt like we were celebrating something special. I was surprised at the large selection of desserts. Most nice restaurants have 3 or 4. They had 8 or 10. But by that time my wife & I knew that we had to share. The table next to us was not messing around and they all got different things but we enjoyed sharing our dessert selection.

Overall they were delicious, especially the picanha and filet mignon with bacon. And the appetizers are so good as well! I love the pao de queijo and banana. Try their lemonade. it's amazing!!! We had the tres leches for dessert and it was by far the best tres leches cake I've ever had. Yes, the price is expensive, but it is totally worth it. Fogo de chao is not only about the food options, but the whole experience. It's a fiun place to go with a large group or celebrate a special date. On top of delicious food, the service is superb and the ambiance is very comfortable and of great taste. I loved the attention to detail (such as their silverware). Upon leaving, grab a  free piece of chocolate if you can fit in your belly. A+++++++", "author": "V P."}

The cuisine and service are spectacular and in-line or better than past visits at other locations.  The decor and dining room finishes are a step-up as well.  It looks like there is still some work to be done physically on the exterior.  This was previously a Chevy's location and they had a great patio along Third Street and it looks like Fogo has plans for that space as well.  This is a huge upgrade for this intersection and a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  Neighboring hotels include Park Central San Francisco, W San Francisco and the St. Regis and Yelp is HQ'ed around the corner as well!  SFMOMA is about to unveil a half-billion dollar expansion across the street and Moscone Convention Center is undergoing a mammoth transformation as well.  Lots and lots of drivers to help make this new location a hit.  Best of luck Fogo; I love you guys and I hope you knock it out of the park!", "author": "Mike B."}
