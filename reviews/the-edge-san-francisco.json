He's always been very attentive, friendly, and engaging when I've stopped by for a drink...to the point that I only care to go when he's behind the bar. He truly puts care into his work and taking care of his customers. And it's not only his customer service skills, he creates delicious drinks on the spot...outside of your regular vodka-sodas,  gin & tonics, or Jack-n-cokes, after he's gotten to know your tastebuds a bit. He even remembers his customers' default drink ordering habits...a critical part of anticipating your customers' needs. On top of all of the aforementioned, his personality in general is always uplifting and humorous. And if you go on the right night, you might get drinks and a show from him. Haha\nThere are other staff that make the Edge such a welcoming spot to enjoy a cocktail, either with friends or when flying solo, like Kenny, Dom, and Roxy Cotten Candy...but Eugene is the motherf*ckin Starboy.", "author": "U.

The second is a broom closet with a trough that would look at home in a contemporary barn.  \n\nBEVERAGE:\nLemon Drop - I'm usually a beer guy, but was not feeling it on turkey day.

I've been to the edge before and had a good time; but this time, it was different. My friend was waiting at the bar for 5 mins, waiting for the bartender to at least acknowledge her. So, I stepped in and just waited at the bar with her, holding my credit card in my hand, waiting for him. He looks at both of us and says \"that's the worse way to get a bartender's attention\" and serves everyone else around the bar. My friend and I look at each other and think what did we do. I've always thought castro was a judgement-free zone, but tonight I know how it felt to have some prejudice against as he continue to serve everyone else who was not Asian. It wasn't until another bartender who came to us and took our order. That same bartender then went to the bartender who was serving us and gossiped about us.

I know I look like I'm twelve, but he sees me almost every week, and I show him the same ID every single time. I don't understand what it will take to convince him that I'm 21 so that he can stop carding me. Maybe I'll just show him my birth certificate and passport the next time I go there. Better yet, maybe I'll bring my mother to that bar so that she can reassure him that I'm 21. \n\nI just really want to know if he's just being cute, or if he's genuinely unconvinced about my age. \n\nHe's attractive though.", "author": "Mark B."}

Before I knew it I had a guy talking to me, telling me which bars to go to, and just making me laugh. Several other patrons approached me and either complimented me or struck up conversation. Everyone was very friendly. It seems like a great place if you're a single guy into 30+ hairy guys. Anyway, even if you're not you should check it out. It's a cool bar. I'm keeping a star because it's a little small and crowded.", "author": "Clint W."}

And not just any kind of crowded, but crowded with bears who take up twice as much space as the twinks and muscle queens at the other bars in the Castro. Was it so that I'd stay in the dark back recesses of the bar where it was easier to breathe, but much harder to leave in any kind of a hurry? Or were you just trying to get into my pants, The Edge? Well, maybe you did and maybe you didn't because I'm not claiming I remember everything about Friday night's happy hour.\n\nDon't be fooled by the simple math logic puzzle. A \"tall\" Captain and Diet versus a \"short\" isn't just double the alcohol. No, because the amount of soda on top remains the same (once short squirt), so you're really getting more than double the alcohol in the tall glass.", "author": "Jere K."}

After getting over my preconceived notions at the door, I walked in to find a cave-like interior, with a beautiful \"rainbow flag\" of feather boas adorning the ceiling. And quite the range of tunes, more so than you'd get at many other establishments in the area. No complaints about the drinks my friend and I had; the bar backs put on a nice show for us of just being silly together, and you could say personality, personality, personality. In spades!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-04-04", "description": "The Edge is much more than a bar, it is a community gathering place. Out of the mainstream for tourists, it fills with mostly local folk looking to relax, throw back a few and enjoy each others company. The bar tenders are knowledgeable, very friendly and quickly get to know you by name and your favorite beverage.  The crowd is more mature which is a refreshing change from the 20 somethings that over run nearly every other establishment.  Call me an old geezer if you must, but I prefer my fruit fully ripe, thank you.  Yes, the drinks will knock you on your keester, but that is a tradition at the Edge. If there is one word to describe the Edge, that would be comfortable in attitude.

I'm actually re-editing this entire review and giving The Edge an ass-whoopin' 5 stars.  In my original review, I only gave it 3 stars and complained about the odor.  Well folks, it still stinks like hell, but I've had a change of heart nonetheless.  In the 4 months I've lived in San Francisco, The Edge has become my favorite Castro gay bar.  (Wait, is it necessary for me to say it's a gay bar?  Like is there any other kind in The Castro?)  What I love about The Edge is that it doesn't have to make any hype about what it is in order for it to exist.  They don't have to advertise underwear night for guys to get off in the back room like Daddy's does.  They don't have to create an event like Starfucker at Deco in order for guys to get naked in public and act sleazy.  Witness the fat guy drunk off his ass, dancing around with his pants around his ankles and making out with his boyfriend in the main room.  Totally unscripted.  Completely tragic.  Fucking hilarious.  I've even seen the burly bartenders get into it with stupid patrons and cuss each other out at the bar.  It is what it is, and I love it.", "author": "Flip C."}
