They also have tons of tempting savory options. We ordered the mango pudding, mixed fruit sago, and the original milk custard. I've never had sago, so maybe take my opinion with a grain of salt, but I loved it! It reminded me very much of the tapioca coconut kheer at DOSA.

While I was eating it, I could taste the creaminess of the coconut. I just wish was sweeter. The coconut milk is literally just coconut milk. I also got the glutinous balls in paste- red bean balls in coconut milk sago. The red bean balls were so good; they were filled with a sweet red bean flavor soaked in coconut milk. Again, the coconut milk was very plain and not sweet at all. The only sweetness I got was from the red bean. \n\nMy bf got the waffle and ice cream (you have purchase $40 or more and check in on Yelp to get this dessert for free). It tasted very regular...just vanilla ice cream drizzled with Nutella and a waffle sandwich on the outside. \n\nMy friends got the sesame and glutinous balls and the fruit sago. She said the sesame tasted like the instant sesame dessert. So not really sure if it was made fresh or not. \n\nWe also ordered the salt and pepper chicken wings. It was very crispy and crunchy so I liked it! It came in a plate of 5, so fairly small.

We walked in on Saturday, December 3rd around 6:45pm. Only a couple of tables were taken, so we easily grabbed a table for four by the window.\n\n*Super Mango Pudding ($6.95)\n*Super B-Kid Grass Jelly ($7.50)\n*Ice Cream Nutella Waffle Sandwich ($7.95)\n*Mixed Fruits Coconut Milk Sago ($5.75)\n\nI got the mango pudding. I liked that the dessert wasn't too sweet. The pudding was nice and creamy. The fruit on top was good except for the mango pieces. They were overly ripe and some had brown spots. Kinda put me off on the dessert, but I ate the rest of the fruit (minus the honeydew since I don't like most melons). The grass jelly in my girlfriend's dessert was good as well. Nice and silky. I also got a hot tea which wasn't on our bill, so I'm not sure if we get hot tea for free?\n\nNice place for Asian desserts.

It's always busy here so make sure you put your name on the list. It's by the wall of gashapon machines.\n\nDon't expect good service or any service for that matter. Every time we come here, we get the same few guys and they're rude. It also doesn't matter if you're speaking english or cantonese, they treat everyone the same except their \"homies.\" At least it reminds me of HK.\n\nMango sago - It's okay. Similar to something you would get in HK. Depending on what night you go, the consistency tends to change. Sometimes the mangos are too ripe and it all oozes into a orange soup and sometimes the sago is overcooked so you can't even taste it. But it's good enough if you're craving it.\n\nEgg puff - I will pass on this. Their eggpuffs aren't airy enough. It might be the batter or the process but when you bite into them they're chewy and hard. Also last time we ordered it, it took around 30 mins to make. Everyone else was done with their dessert. \n\nThis place reminds me of a HK cha chan tang mixed with a dessert parlor.

It was enough for us to not come back anytime in the near future. \n\nCame in on a Friday evening with a friend and we decided to try this place since we've both already tried other Asian dessert places in the area. As soon as we walked in we noticed that the place was pretty packed. Glad we made it in before the rush because we noticed groups forming in the waiting room area as we were deciding. Since we just ate dinner, we were only concentrating on the dessert menu. There were so many options, we were a little overwhelmed deciding. There were photos which made the process easier, but most of them didn't. There's also no descriptions so we tried to figure out what a certain dish was. After we told the server that we needed an extra minute to decide, he didn't come back until we waved him down almost 10 minutes later. Took us numerous tries to get his attention as well. \n\nAfter the long and indecisive process, we decided to get the Super mango-go-go to share between the two of us. The man who brought it out gave us a regular mango-go-go. As he turned away we told him we ordered the super. He gave us the super mango-go-go in his other hand and took away the regular one. Finally, we were excited to dig right in! First bite, bits of little sago and ..... ice? Frozen sago? We were both taken by surprise when we tasted it and spent a while trying to figure out why there were random frozen bits in it. Seemed like it was just frozen sago at the bottom. Moving on, we each ate a mango piece and it honestly tasted like bland stringy fibers. I love mangoes too! What a disappointment. My friend mentioned that the best part of the dish was probably the mango ice cream since you already expect the artificial flavoring in it. \n\nSince there were still people waiting, we tried to wave down the waiter again so we could get the check. After a couple unsuccessful tries, the cashier notices us and comes over. We ask for the check and she brings us a check. Except, it was the wrong check. Now we had to wave her down again to ask for the correct check. Overall, there were too many mistakes made for a simple order. The dish itself was subpar and we felt like we were playing a guessing game with each bite.", "author": "Nancy C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-11-02", "description": "After visiting Schubert's bakery, we drove past Kowloon Tong Dessert Caf\u00e9 which piqued my parents' interests as they're pretty serious about their Hong Kong desserts. We came back at night with the intention to just eat a small snack, but we ended up eating dinner and dessert.\n\nThere's a ton of street parking if you go during the night. We avoided the late night crowd when we got here around 8 on a Friday night. Pretty soon there was a long list of people waiting for seats at the caf\u00e9. A lot of young adults/teenagers seem to frequent this place, buying desserts and chatting with each other, so I'd recommend coming a little earlier to avoid the crowd. \n\nThe menu is extensive. There are so many different dessert items that it took us quite awhile before we figured out what to order. From noodles to sago to milkshakes, they have pretty much all the essential Hong Kong desserts you can think of. \n\nDessert Items: \n\nMixed Fruit Sago w/ Condensed Milk: I just wanted to get a dessert item, and thought this sounded fairly good. It was underwhelming and definitely not what I was expecting. I think I could probably throw this concoction together at home. There were various fruits on top of the condensed milk, but nothing special. The condensed milk was sweet and the sago was chewy enough, but it pretty much tasted like a typical dessert you'd get at the end of a meal at a Chinese restaurant. I would not order this again. \n\nBlack Sesame Dessert: This was part of the daily special - I thought it tasted okay. It had a strong sesame flavor, which is preferred, but this dessert isn't a favorite of mine, so I can't really give a fair review. My parents thought it tasted pretty good, although I think they've had better from Premiere Dessert back in LA. \n\nEgg Waffles: Our waffles were a little burnt, so they came out crispy rather than soft. I actually prefer crispy, but the batter had no taste to it, so it was kind of like eating crispy crackers. The inside was pretty soft, but without the sweetness that it needs, it wasn't too good. \n\nComplimentary Ice Cream Waffles: If you spend over $30, they give you a free ice cream waffle dish, which my mom was set on trying. And I'm glad we did because this was probably the best thing I had here! They serve real Dreyer's ice cream, so they placed a thick scoop of vanilla ice cream in between two crispy waffles. It came out well. Because the batter is not sweet (probably the same batter as the Egg Waffle batter), the ice cream from the center really gives the entire bite the sweetness that I craved. The crispiness of the waffles and the softness of the ice cream really worked for me. \n\nHorlick Drink: This came with the daily special as well. The drink was okay. My parents really like the drink because it reminds them of their childhood days. There was good flavor, but I'm not a fan. \n\nSavory Dishes:\n\nCurry Fish Balls: There were 8 fish balls altogether. While the fish balls weren't too special - they tasted as if they were frozen beforehand - the curry did taste really good. It wasn't too spicy, but had a good earthy flavor to it that made me want to add rice to it. Not too bad. \n\nImitation Shark Fin Soup: $4.25 It was decent, but definitely had better in HK. Even HK's 7/11's have better tasting (and cheaper) imitation shark fin soup! I thought this one tasted too salty. There was a decent amount of ingredients inside, but the saltiness of the soup overpowered everything. \n\nSoya Chicken Wings with Vermicelli: $6.50 I thought this was a pretty decent dish considering the price. There were three chicken wings with a pretty big bowl of vermicelli. It was enough to fill my sister and me up. The dish took around 15 minutes to cook, and it was well worth the time because the chicken wings had good flavor that really soaked through beyond the skin of the chicken. The soup base was not too heavy and was quite light, which was nice. \n\nChicken and Pork daily special: This was $9.50 plus an additional $1.95. I thought the price was a little expensive considering the tiny pieces of chicken and pork that came with the dish. You're able to pick your choice of sauce, rice or spaghetti, one hot drink, and a dessert (additional $2). So overall this dish was over $13. There was a good amount of rice (which we used to soak up the curry sauce) as well as a small scoop of corn. The chicken and pork were cooked well and the skin had that crispy perfection to it. I just thought they were quite small. \n\ntl;dr - Overall, I thought it was a decent place to have dinner. It's reminiscent of Hong Kong, but doesn't really come close to the authenticity of HK's desserts and food. I would come back again for the ice cream waffle! There are actually a few other HK dessert stores within a few blocks of this one, but this was the most crowded.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

The menu was huge they had a lot of food and desserts to choose from. I ordered the spam and egg sandwich which was pretty good, cause I mean you can't go wrong with that. Then we also got the curry fish ball which I didn't really like because it tasted weird like the the fish ball texture was kind of weird and the curry tasted like a mix of curry and peanut paste or something. The egg puff wasn't all that either because I like mines kinda with a chewy texture but this was really bready and lacked sweetness. The steamed milk pudding was good, it was smooth and silky and really flavored well. The service was good but I think the inconsistency with the food may be because of how busy they were.

They gave us the wrong order... they gave us some meat with rice and corn instead of chicken wings & fries.

I first discovered this place as an Asian dessert cafe and everything looked super yummy so I knew that I needed to give it a try. My friend and I came on a Friday night and it was pretty packed actually. I got the Mango sago and he got a brown sugar doufuhua which apparently is quite hard to find--well, good doufuhua is at least. \n\nMango sago was originally not sweet enough for me, but one I actually started to mix it, it started to taste a lot better. I've never had doufuhua before so this was a great introduction to it. The doufu itself was great consistency but the brown sugar was a little too strong and made the dish a little more difficult to have.\n\nAnyways, as we were there though, I realized that they have a ton of good savory dishes too! Such a good typical HK style cafe. \n\nI got the instant noodles with pickled cabbage and sliced pork which was quite good. I mean at the end of the day, it's as good as instant ramen can actually be, but it was very HK and standard and I'm a fan. I also got the egg puffs which were better in consistency but I like the flavors of Genki's egg puffs a bit more. Anyways they have a lot of other noodle based dishes, rice dishes, other desserts, ice cream desserts, etc. They have just about everything. \n\nWe also lucked out--I came for lunch around 3pm on Sunday and they open right at 3pm. Normally they're open at 5pm! BUT this place is open until 1am generally on weekdays and 2am on fri/sat evening which is amazing. Would definitely frequent this place a bit more if I didn't live so far!\n\ntldr; awesome HK style cafe with great desserts--not sure why the reviews are so low, probably because all Chinese restaurants get screwed on service but I think the quality of the food is pretty neat", "author": "Jasmine X."}

In the history of yelp or any of my dining experiences. I was called \"f*cking crazy\" in Chinese after trying to speak to the manager about his employee.\n\nI'll try to keep the story short. Came in one night for some comfort Chinese savory dishes and for some Chinese desserts after our dinner. Ordered 2 noodles, 2 appetizers, one soup, 2 drinks. I've been here at least 6+ times before and each time, we've reached the $30 dollars for check-in for the free waffle dessert. I know that we might have been a couple of dollars short so.. this is what happened\n\n(1st interaction) - I asked the waitress in question if our party was below the $30 dollars and let me know how much we need to qualify. She comes back and says \"No\" and walks away.\n\n(2nd interaction) - I asked the waitress again that if we order one more specific appetizer (for $4.50) if we would reach the $30 dollars? Answer was a simple \"No,\" and then she walks away again. I had asked how much we needed to reach the $30 dollars but she ignored the question.\n\n(3rd interaction) -  I waved her back politely again and asked how much it would be to reach the $30 and since she didn't answer so I asked how much we were off by if we ordered the 4.50 app. She said we were $.05 (FIVE CENTS) off. By this time, she had an annoyed smirk on her face. I tried to brush it off because I was just focused on this free dessert. I should have known by then that she was trouble.\n\n(4th interaction) - I asked if we could either pay for the additional 5 cents or purchase a plastic bag (for .10). She said no and walked away again. I think that purchasing anything is reasonable of an ask to hit the target. I really do.\n\n(5th interaction) - By this time, I was fuming. I asked the older gentleman who I've seen worked there the last 6 times Ive been there if it's okay if we did that. He walked away and came back the RUDE girl again. She said no again.\n\n(6th interaction) - I asked for her name so I could talk to her manager about her. As I do at all restaurants when service is superior or totally unacceptable, I try to be as honest as possible to management so they know they're either doing a good job or they know that there's room for improvement. She grilled me and walked away and just gave me the nastiest face saying \"NO\"\n\nWow. As if that wasn't it... I walked to the front to talk to the manager and as we were walking, the man asked her what was wrong and she said in EXACT words in Chinese - \"I dont know, she's f*cking crazy\" WOW. She thought I didn't speak chinese because I was talking to her in English and even then, I didn't lose it. I told her politely that I spoke English in Chinese and her response was \"SO?!\" (exact words and tone).... I try to explain to the manager that she was being rude and unnecessary and all they could say was that they'll bring it back up to the owners. I said that we'd not be able to frequent this restaurant anymore if their attitude doesn't change. And you know what, it wasn't about the dessert, or the 30 dollars or the 5 cents but about the principle. I could NOT believe that this girl worked in the restaurant business. Seriously.\n\nOverall, I know that was supposed to be a short review but it didn't happen. Sorry! But the food here is average. It's cheap and a place that you'd want to go to if you wanted a quick bite. The imitation shark fin soup is terrible. The sesame balls are good. The chicken wings are decent. The desserts aren't over the top but it'll do if you have a late night craving. They're also usually super packed. If the service wasn't that terrible, I'd probably at least visit once or twice a year. But now, it's on top of my NO NO list. I hope you guys get treated better than we did.\n\nWatch out for the young asian girl in ponytails and a pink hoodie...", "author": "Vanessa K."}

This was definitely the place to be. It was cash only and back then Smart and Final didn't care if we parked in their lot. But that was probably 1.5 decades ago. Fast forward to present day there's a sign outside of Kowloon that prohibit their customers from parking at Smart and Final lol. Back then the free ice cream waffle was at a minimum of $25 or more and now it's $30 (probably for the last few years). Still a good deal though. The ice cream is high quality because it's made with Dreyers ice cream and you can taste the high quality. Everything here is so fun to eat. You can order cold food, hot food, dessert and more. The options are endless. I wonder what happened to the happy guy who used to work here? He was always so happy and offered extraordinary customer service but I haven't seen him recently. He always made the dining experience pleasant because he was always so enthusiastic. Some of the workers now don't look very happy lol. Anyways I wish there were more dessert spots like Kowloon. I don't really know any other ones or I haven't ventured out far enough. There's a few along Geary and Clement but I don't really go there anymore. I like getting the egg and luncheon meat sandwich because it has no crust. It's luncheon meat and not spam and I like how they are honest about it because I hate places that say spam but put luncheon meat. I also like the ramen noodles plate with egg and luncheon meat. My picky husband likes coming here too so that's definitely a plus. Their hot tea stays hot for hella long because of the cup they used. They only have two high chairs for kids. There's mirrors on the wall and a TV. Bathroom is okay. Not hella clean but not hella dirty either. No toilet seat covers though. I hope they decide to invest in that. I feel like we order a lot when we come here but the total is only around $30 each time!

Unfortunately, compared to the restaurants in East Bay, the portions are tiny and super expensive. The desserts they serve are definitely good, but not at all worth the price :(\n\nWe had:\n1. Mango Sago - the mango chunks were SO FRESH and SWEET. Delicious, but the bowl of dessert was tiny.\n2. Tang yuan (sesame) - probably warmed from a packet, you could probably make this on your own. Give it a miss.\n3. Yin Yang dessert - I thought this was a little on the watery side, also again, the serving was tiny.\n\nOverall the food tasted agreeable enough, but it was nothing to write home about.

We were immediately greeted and seated once we entered. The menu was pretty straight forward. They not only have desserts, but food platters as well! They have desserts like sago, ice cream, egg puffs, tea, and the list can go on!\n\nWe ordered the green tea ice cream waffle sandwich which was delicious, but I found it hard to eat. The popular mango go go exceeded my expectations. Lastly the egg puffs were by far the best I ever had! It was the right amount of fluffiness, chewy on the inside, and crunchy on the outside.\n\nThe customer service was awesome!

Came in around ten and it's like the busiest times since everyone is out looking for late night snacks/desserts. I just finished watching Finding Dory and was craving dessert so bad that o literally bussed from downtown to the Richmond district hehe. I always pass by this place but I never actually went inside before so I'd thought I'd give it a go. Ordered my own dessert and egg puffs and food came super quick. The egg puffs was something I expected to be good because it was black sesame egg puffs but what I thought wasn't what I got because it was basically plain egg puffs with little pieces of black sesame spread around lol. But it's still alright. What I really liked was the mango go go. I love how you mainly taste mango and only slightly coconut milk because usually it's the opposite.

This place was bookmarked on my Yelp Account for the longest time and I finally had the opportunity to try it out after my boyfriend and I went out for dinner. \n\nFirstly, we sat down and noticed the plethora of signs stating \"Free ice cream waffle sandwich with purchase of $30 or more if you check in on Facebook or Yelp.\" This caught us by surprise, because initially we checked the Yelp page and were excited to see a check in offer. The check in offer on Yelp does not state you must order $30 or more to be eligible for the offer. It's not that big of a deal, but I just wished they mentioned the small print on their Yelp page.\n\nSecondly, the waiter served us \"hot\" tea. It wasn't hot at all and tasted more like lukewarm flavored water. Gross.\n\nMoving on, we looked at the menu and decided just to order one dessert. (Good thing!) We ordered the \"Mixed Fruit Sago\" which oddly we thought was a hot dessert. Yeah, it was served to us cold. This silly mistake may have been our lack of experience in ordering from a HK cafe, but why is it under \"hot desserts\" on the menu?\n\nThe last deciding factor in why this restaurant only deserves 1 star, value. The Mixed Fruit Sago ringing in at $6 was subpar in quality and wasn't worth $6. The fruit was not fresh and the sago lacked flavor.

The interior has a flat screen TV, is very spacious, and appropriate for groups. It was difficult to see the server who stood behind the counter located far away from the entrance. So instead, we seated ourselves and the overall atmosphere was casual and relaxed. \n\nPopcorn Chicken ($3.95): Chicken was breaded and deep-fried but lacked the crispy textures, seasoning, and basil and red pepper. Not as good as the ones at Factory Tea Bar.\n\nEgg Puff ($2.50): One of my favorite Hong Kong desserts. I used to buy these as hand warmers when I lived in the Boston area. However, there were too many air pockets instead of a cake-like soft and spongy center. It tasted like a vanilla sugar cone and not the egg puffs I'm addicted to. Seems like a popular item here, but I don't recommend it.\n\nBlack Sesame Paste ($3.95): The flavor of Black Sesame was decent, but the paste could be a lot thicker with stronger aroma. The quality did not match the ones at Phoenix Food Boutique, My Favorite Caf\u00e9, and 100% Sweet Caf\u00e9. \n\nMixed Fruit Honeydew Sago ($4.75): I loved the taste of the sago, but the fruit was not ripe enough to add to the flavors. \n\nI love Hong Kong style desserts, but why is it that service is always super slow and completely absent? I had to get out of my seat numerous times in order to get the server's attention. She never came back to check on us during the visit, and the \"don't care\" approach can be quite irritating after a while.

They don't have that much variety in their menus and serves very typical dessert. I ordered the mango pudding, mango sago, egg puff, steamed egg with sticky rice, and chicken wings. It was a bonus that they offered free waffle sundae with a check in.\nMango pudding: nothing special about it and tasted exactly like this brand of supermarket mango pudding that you can buy for $.99. They didn't try hard to mask the fact that it was made with powder. \nMango sago: it was okay. Nothing much to say because it wasn't bad or good. Wouldn't get it again. \nEgg puff: it was pretty crispy which was nice but that's about it :/. Pretty plain tasting but then again it was just original flavor. \nChicken wings: their chicken wings were spot on-crunchy and flavorful without being too salty (unlike some other dessert places -_-) the wings are the reason I gave this place an extra star. \nSteamed egg w/sticky rice: never had it with sticky rice and coconut milk before but it's not a bad combo. There wasn't much of an egg flavor, which might've been masked by the coconut milk and sticky rice. It's good in small amount but I had trouble finishing it. After awhile it starts to become too heavy due to the amount of rice. \nWaffle sundae: i wouldn't order it unless it was free...the waffle was plain but the vanilla ice cream was okay. Nothing special either. \nService: the waiter provided good service and occasionally refilled our tea.", "author": "Annie V."}

My order of sticky rice with coconut and mango was AWFUL. First, they brought out a red bean dish which I did not order.

I was expecting white sticky rice with coconut sauce drizzled on top w/ mango slices. NOPE.

A bit airy which I prefer. \n\nThey also have a small selection of foods to order in case you prefer to eat a full meal prior to their dessert.

It was good, the size was normal and the fruits were fresh and ripe.

But beware that there is shaved ice in it so be ready to be freezing cold after eating it.\n\nIce Cream Waffle Sandwich. This one I have always enjoyed because it combined two great things that I love, ice cream and waffle. It's delicious because the waffle is crispy, but not piping hot that the ice cream melts. You can choose different ice cream flavors that go inside the sandwich, I like vanilla mango or strawberry.\n\nAnything mango. I really like mangoes, and if you do too, they make their mango desserts pretty well. I really like the one with the mango ice cream, mango slush, mango, with sago and coconut milk. It's just an explosion of delicious mango, as you can tell.\n\nThey have egg puffs here, but the last time I had it it wasn't crispy enough. I think it depends on the people making it.

We sat away from each other, not even interacting with one another and we were going to be charged a 15% gratuity. That immediately put everyone into a terrible mood.

Honestly, I could barely even taste the egg which is kind of the main component.. Sad to say I've had better egg puffs at Quickly's.. \n\nThe glutinous rice balls had a great texture, but they were doused with too, too, too much brown sugar. \n\nThe ice cream waffle sandwiches were the only thing that we all enjoyed.

I honestly thought I had teleported back home while I was here. Or defied the time-space continuum to travel back to my childhood.\n\nI grew up in little Hong Kong and let me tell you: There ain't nothing like Hong Kong afternoon tea fare. I used to dislike it as a kid because I found the mix of Western and Eastern foods confusing and bizarre. Now that I am older and understand geopolitics much more (which is fancy-speak for \"I read The Economist from time to time\"), I appreciate how perfectly the culinary fusion represents Hong Kong's rich, diverse history. \n\nPerusing the menu at Kowloon Tong, I came across old favorites like curry fish balls, macaroni noodle soup, fried spaghetti and \"chicken egg pastry\", which the menu translates as \"egg puff\". My friends and I only came for dessert, so we ordered the aforementioned puff, taro in coconut milk soup and ginger milk curd. The puff was very good--clearly freshly made--but could have been slightly sweeter. The taro in coconut soup is my favorite of the Chinese \"dessert soups\" and Kowloon Tong's version was very good. If I had to say one critical thing, it would be that it was a tad watery, which softened the pearls more than I like them to be. The ginger milk curd, though, was absolute perfection--and I am not normally a ginger fan.\n\nService was stellar: Fast and friendly while still being attentive. We were fortunate to get here right before the weekend crowd hit. Within 5 minutes of placing our orders, the cafe had filled up and crowds of people were standing outside in the chilly night patiently awaiting their turn. At prices that are comparable to McDonald's, you really have no excuse not to check this place out. I definitely plan on coming back for a full meal.", "author": "Josephine L."}

Though I've only trekked here a couple times, I can easily say that this place has mastered a majority of the signature beloved desserts unique to Hong Kong.\n\nMANGO GO GO [MANGO GI GI] ($4.95): Best rendition of the mango sago dessert, hands down. Not overly sweet; Thick and dense liquid dessert, almost like an indulgent soup; Dessert contained mango cubes, pomelo shreds, sago, mango juice/puree, and coconut milk. Probably the closest match to the quality found at cafes in Hong Kong; Highly recommended\n\nMANGO JUICE ($3.25): Fresh mangoes were clearly used; Not really the thick milkshake consistency since it is fruit juice; Unsure of whether the extra tad of sweetness came naturally from mangoes or was added with syrup; Good nonetheless\n\nEGG PUFFS ($3): A-OK; Taste was okay though could have had more eggy flavor and a bit more sweetness; Texture was okay though it should have had crunchy exterior and chewy interior; Skipworthy\n\nHK STYLE MILK TEA ($2.50): Didn't have this but my folk enjoyed it; Not overly sweet in the least bit (hotter tends to have less sugar); Strong tea taste; Good temperature control\n\nCOCONUT MILK STEAMED EGG PUDDING [DUN NAI] ($4.50): Made on the spot - Came out hot and fresh; Thick and creamy texture\n\nSERVICE: What do you expect? Asian place will come with asian service and occasionally with an attitude. In other words, rude, ignorant, and tense service. Somehow, they didn't exactly exhibit any of these traits in particular though they didn't give us great service. \n\nDECOR: A run-down yet somewhat modern  place. Feels like a pho noodle shop. Lots of seating.\n\nKowloon Tong is definitely a good candidate for HK-style desserts and will satisfy all your HK-style dessert needs, sweet tooth's, and cravings.

But its actually pretty hard to earn 5 stars in my book. However, Kowloon Tong deserves every bit of the 5 star because this is THE BEST DESSERT PLACE IN S.F.!\n\nWhat makes this place the greatest is the workers there. I'm not sure of their schedule, but if you go saturday night (busy time so expect a short wait!), you can catch both Alvin and Brandon working. They're funny, polite, and nice and they make your hong kong dessert experience so much more enjoyable.\n\nThis is a dessert place, but they have other hot/snacky food too. Here is what i think\n\nBUENO!\n(1) Spam w/ egg Spicy Instant Noodle\nMany of you probably think you guys could make this yourself at home. And you're probably right, but that doesn't mean its not delicious!\n\n(2) Fried Chicken Wing\nThey do this really good here. Its super hot and they don't have super bready crusts so every bite is just skin and meat. What i like to do best is line a streak of ketchup on the wing for each bite.\n\n(3) Ice Cream Waffle Sandwich\nHot crunchy surface first, and then you start biting into the cold, soft and sweet part of the ice cream. It numbs your teeth a bit, but its worth it. Butter on waffles make it a breakfast, but ice cream on it makes it an irresistable dessert.\n\nNO BUENO!\n(1) Milk Tea\nI'm not a fan of their milk tea, because its not sweet enough i think. But people always get it so I guess its just me.\n\nIf you live in the San Francisco area, you most def. have to give this place a visit.

They also have a waffle sundae that my family usually likes to order and share together.\n\nThere's almost always a line if you head there past dinner time so plan accordingly.  There's also little to no parking so its usually only locals who are visiting or the lucky or unlucky few that spend a significant amount of time circling for a parking spot.", "author": "Sandy L."}

Not impressive, but not so bad that it is horrible.\n\nKT, DR, and many other one size fits all dessert shops fall more or less into the same trap....variety trumps quality. In Hong Kong such shops exist that also range in quality, but the really good places would focus on no more than a few items, and do them repeatedly since the dawn of time (like Jiro Ono with his sooosheee) while maintaining consistency. It is very hard to nail down everything in an establishment like this, and even achieving proper 50% coverage would be considered lofty expectations.\n\nWith a menu this broad, it has to be believed (for the faithful) that there has got to be some zubic zirconians in the rough in a pile of rocks. Unfortunately I ended up with more rocks than pseudo gems.\n\nMango juice - they weren't kidding, freshly \"squeezed\" mangoes. Super cold even though they claimed they didn't use ice, but it was nice and thick and didn't taste diluted, and it wasn't sweetened either. Saw lots of boxes of fresh yellow \"Manila style\" mangoes in the back corner, so this shop at least uses the real deal. The biggest difference again is that anything mango tastes so much better in Hong Kong because they import premium mangoes from the Philippines. This is another reason why HK dessert shops here that serve mango based offerings will never reach the quality and taste...unless perhaps they use the seasonal organic mangoes grown in Indio (California) that is only available for a very short time each year that is truly excellent. The effort at least has to be appreciated, vs using canned mango pulp.\n\nEggettes/egg puffs (gai daan jai) - Looks decent, but is missing the luster and shiny gold color that would have improved this. Crunchy, and texture is not bad even on the inside, but hardly any egg flavor.\n\nSteamed rice rolls (ju cherng fun) - rolled up ho fun, kind of like Vietnamese banh cuon...well they don't make them in house for sure. A bit oversteamed, and the three kinds of sauces were not so interesting. No chili sauce. And worst of all, I ate it with a fork. DR at least goes the extra mile to provide skewer sticks (like giant long toothpicks) to replicate the HK pushcart / street experience.\n\nIced HK milk tea - uninteresting, not some multi leaf blend and tea lacked robustness and depth. Similar to maybe Golden Island Cafe version.\n\nThe good thing is that KT takes credit cards. Although cashier at first credit card swipe attempt said my card didn't work, and asked for another (either another card, or indirectly hinting at cash payment). I asked her to try again and it worked. Persistence is everything. I looked around, and didn't see the credit card minimum sign (like how that is hidden at HK Lounge 2).", "author": "Ken K."}

I especially missed the food and desserts. So when my friend told me about Kowloon Tong Dessert Cafe, we were dying to try it. \n\nIt was a long ride to KTDC but when my friends and I got here, it was a bit disappointing because there wasn't a lot of people there. It was about 7pm. But we were on a dessert mission so we started going crazy with the menu. We decided to order the egg waffle, the steamed rice crepe, coconut milk taro sago, and the banana split waffle sandwich. BUT then one of my friends spotted the check-in deal.\n\nWe added up our 4 dishes and it totaled to be about $17 so we all agreed that we should order one more dish to get our FREE ice cream waffle (because we just needed to check-in and tag a friend on FB to get the deal). And that is what we did. We ordered a red bean soup with peanut filled glutinous balls (I really wanted to try this). Thus, we got 2 more desserts with a total of 4 desserts and 2 snacks :) Gym time later.\n\nMost of the food was decent at best. The egg waffles were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It wasn't too sweet either. The rice crepe was OK, the noodles didn't taste that fresh, like those you can buy at Asian markets and the sauce was bland. The coconut milk taro sago didn't taste like coconut (to my friend's disappointment) and it was a bit starchy. \n\nThe red bean soup was so disappointing. There wasn't a lot of red beans so it was liquidy (I like my red bean soup with LOTS of red bean). The glutinous balls were OK but the peanut filling was nowhere near as good as the ones I had in Hong Kong.\n\nNow the real winners of KTDC were the ice cream waffle sandwiches. We got the banana split waffle sandwich and the vanilla ice cream with bananas were so delicious. For our free ice cream sandwich we decided to get green tea and mango ice cream filling. AWESOME ICE CREAM. There's something about their ice cream. It's probably one of the best ice creams I've had and their waffles were soooo good. Crispy and sweet with a tinge of maple syrup flavor. \n\nI wouldn't come back here any time soon because their food is not out-of-this-world-amazing, but their ice cream sandwiches are fantastic.

Then I forget all the reasons why I was there in the first place because I'm too busy eating an ice cream sandwich waffle while the rest of my party is like, \"Why did we order two?\" and I say, \"One whole thing is for me. I thought you guys were splitting the rest.\" And I'm usually right. I usually urge the boyfriend to come with me around 7-9pm, before the rush of people who like going out later at night. It's pretty quiet around 7pm, so if you don't want to deal with a crowd, that's a good time to go.\n\nSometimes I get that snack time food, too. Mainly spam. And the boyfriend always looks at me like I'm crazy for it, but damn it, spam, eggs, and rice is awesome. It's a good way to pause in the middle of an ice cream waffle sandwich. The other non-ice cream sandwiches (things like chicken sandwiches) aren't all that great; super fatty, hard to eat as a sandwich, on cheap bread, and served with those crinkle-cut fries you get from the frozen aisle at Safeway. The noodles are quite tasty, though!\n\nOne thing I will always remember: the mugs are deceptive. They're really good at insulating heat, so when they serve you tea, I highly suggest not drinking it right away. It's boiling hot and you wouldn't be able to tell from just holding the mug. Seriously, save your mouth from sure burnination.\n\nOh, and the black sesame hot dessert is good, too! I didn't like it too much in the red bean soup, but in the black sesame, it was lovely.

Whenever I was craving dessert I would opt for golden island or creations over Kowloon. But recently friends have been wanting to come here for dessert more often and I'm glad they did! I tried their mango shaved ice recently and I was amazed it was sooo good I ate the entire thing in just a couple of minutes.  The shaved ice came with mango juice/pur\u00e9e that they serve with their sago, shaved ice of course, lots of fresh mango, and a scoop of ice cream on top. There was also a sauce poured over it but I couldn't tell if it was condensed milk or coconut milk.  Either way it was sooo good and refreshing.  We've also tried their waffle ice cream sandwiches, banana splits, ramen, spicy crispy chicken, and French fries. Their \"crispy chicken\" is just chicken nuggets, but their fries my favorite! Crinkle cut and fried real crispy!! I can eat a whole order by myself.", "author": "Linz C."}

It's not fusion in that it combines other cuisines. It's fusion in that it combines desserts into one plate (e.g. ice cream, bananas, and chocolate syrup packed in between waffles). Checking in on Facebook/Yelp with a $30 purchase gets you a free ice cream waffle sandwich though! Service is definitely slow, but they're super accommodating for whatever kind of party you have, and they let you chill there for a long time. Way better than Creations.", "author": "Danny C."}

We waited about 15 minutes until we were seated. CIndy C. had the strawberry sago and I decided to try the watermelon juice. We also shared the ice cream waffle sundae.

It's good and it's healthy! You also know what to expect :) \n\nEgg puffs are always a popular choice too! When it first comes out fresh, tastes soft and crunchy!

When its packed, the turnover can be slow cuz them peeps there will chatty chat chat and never leave! U feel me? Lol  But they do offer a lot of food selections in addition to dessert so you can actually eat dinner here.  \n\nI usually order the steamed milk or egg with either ginger or almond flavor. If I'm feeling fancy, I will do the bird's nest one.  Does it's job and it's not too sweet. The wait time is about 10-15 min. \n\nChecked in on FB and got the Ice Cream waffle sandwich for Free.  Surprisingly it was pretty good. The waffle was done just right. Very crispy on the outside but not overcooked while the center was still moist. Ice cream was bland...not the gourmet kind but I wasn't expecting it to be. it's free so can't complain too much! haha\n\nService: yes you will need to wave them down for service.

This place definitely satisfies that craving and is a great place to hang out with friends while you're at it.\n\nRecently I have been ordering the waffle sundae. It's a fairly sized sundae with vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry ice cream in it topped with slices of a waffle. Tonight I also ordered the egg puffs. I haven't had much luck lately with ordering a decent egg puff, but this place provided me with something nice. A while back I also had some of their snack food like chicken wings and fries which were pretty good too. The prices are pretty standard for a Hong Kong dessert cafe.\n\nIn terms of service, in my experience they're pretty attentive to their customers. Even though it gets pretty busy, they do pretty well with getting food out quickly and refilling tea. I also liked that they didn't try to rush me out despite having people waiting outside to get seated. Sometimes places will hand you the check rather early to try to encourage you to leave sooner, but this place didn't do that to me and let us stay in here and just chat until we asked for the bill.

A few things to note:\n\n-After 9pm Kowloon will be PACKED!\n\n-CASH ONLY\n\n-waffles for the waffle sammy can vary in size, big one nite and small the next but still worth it! \n\n-Can be a healthier alternative to fatty American desserts!\n\nfobby definition of the day: Sago\n\nSago is a starch extracted from the pith of sago palm stems, Metroxylon sagu.

Also more fondly known as the \"yeah, I think I WILL spend $5.00 on ramen I could make at home because it comes with an egg and meat here, and it tastes better when I pay for it\" cafe.  And mind you, I don't even say that sarcastically...there have been a number of times I've used that exact logic in my head when deciding on what to order (yay...?).\n\nBeyond the noodles (which is exactly like the ones you can make at home, so what is there to say?), they really do have some pretty good dessert items.  I just recently discovered their tofu fa (pretty good), but I generally go with their sago desserts (comes with choice of fruits with fruit puree and sago).  Definitely refreshing on a warm day, and more on the light side too.  The peanut butter toast with condensed milk is good too, but I haven't found one around here that's comparable to what I had in Asia though.  Which is pretty odd, considering it's just toast, peanut butter, and condensed milk.  And of course, you can't forget about their egg puffs, which it seems just about every table will get an order of.  Well, we do at least...but then, we're also the same people that order those $5 bowls of ramen.  \n\nAlso, I can't think of the name of the dish, but I know one of my friends really likes the rolled rice noodles with the peanut and xo dipping sauces...although, I guess that's more of an appetizer than a dessert.  \nIf you're looking for something more like a snack though, I would probably avoid their soy sauce chicken wings.  Not that they taste bad, just that it's pretty generic.  I think I've had the exact same thing at about a half dozen other Chinese delis in my lifetime, and those were generally more flavorful.  \n\nService has generally been good, although it might drag a little on a busy Friday or Saturday night it seems.  Still not terrible though, even if there is a crowd.  But just as a heads-up...be careful with those metal tea cups they give you.  They're so deceptive!

It was a typical weekend, an asian drama was playing, and they were swamped and people crowding outside. We must have beat the rush because we were seated quite promptly. I was really glad to see that they decided to use ikea glass cups, rather than those plastic mugs they had to fill boiling hot tea in. I love getting the tea, but it's just does not sit well with me when it comes in a plastic cup. I literally taste the plastic. *yuck\n\nAnyways, food was mediocre. Chicken was overly dry, strong smell of garlic on the wings, and my ginger milk curd had way too much ginger. Omg, i think i felt it burn down my throat.

Don't do it unless you're looking for an inconspicuous method of prolonged suicide by way of coronary artery disease.\n- I walked to the bathroom and passed the kitchen.

Maybe they should get a longer curtain for the kitchen, lol.\n\nConsidered very much to let them have a strike 3 opportunity with me and come back a third time - but they struck out that same night.\nThe bill came out to $9.66. Most places with a credit card minimum of $10 let it go, since it's \"close enough.\" No, not them. They tried to force us to order more potentially hazardous food, but after reviewing the menu about ten more times I just asked if I could pay the difference - an extra $0.34.

I'm not an asshole, I tipped them anyway. \n\nHere's another tip:\nFood Safety regulations require food to be stored at a minimum height of 6\" above the floor on a clean shelf. Defrosting poultry should either be in a bowl on the appropriate shelf on in the refrigerator at 41F or less, in a shallow bowl under cold running water in the prep sink, or defrosted as part of the cooking process [boiling water, roast pan in the oven, etc.].", "author": "Rosavida C."}

Why do i love this place so much? Besides the fact I love late night dessert, it's a good place to socialize with friends and hang out.\n\nFood:\nI'd recommend trying a bunch of stuff there:\n1) Strawberry sago: I am a big fan of strawberry and if you like strawberries, I'd recommend the strawberry sago. It is served with strawberries and sago pearls (mini tapioca balls except they taste much lighter and you can just slurp them up like a vacuum cleaner). It has a not too sweet and not too plain taste and serves as a light, refreshing dessert.\n\n2) Egg Puffs: Yea, typical, I know but they taste even better when you drizzle all that condensed milk on it.\n\n3) Ramen: They offer a variety of noodle choices paired with toppings. My personal favorite is the spicy instant noodle with luncheon meat (this is not the same as spam) and fried egg (come on, of course you need a fried egg in your ramen!). It has that delicious sodium-filled taste that makes you want to eat it even after a huge dinner with a minor kick to boot (this can vary depending on how wel you take spicy).\n\n4) Ice Cream Waffle Sandwich: Usually when i go, I go with a group of friends and we do a facebook check in (spend 20$ or more dollars and you get one for free). It is a literally waffle sandwich with ice cream of your choice in the middle divided into 4 usually equal pieces. The waffle has that good savory taste to it paired with the sweet taste of the ice cream.\n\nRandom notes: This place gets packed on Friday and Saturday betwwen 10 and 1 (for one, this place is open longer than a majority of the dessert places around the area and everyone just loves getting late night food/dessert in the city) so be prepared to either get their earlier or wait.\n\nRecommended?

For all you \"Snow Frog\" lovers out there we finally figured out its secret. It has nothing to do with snow and probably nothing with frogs either. Mona always loves eating the Snow Frog dessert but we were both wondering what the heck it actually is. So we called the waiter over and asked him to explain to us what it is. He asked us if he should explain it in Cantonese or English and we said it doesn't really matter. Luckily he explained in English because if all those Chinese people were listening in, it probably would've grossed them out. \n\nSo....getting to the point, Snow Frog is actually a fa.....lo....pi....an....tube haha. Now, when the waiter was explaining that to us, I actually had to have him repeat himself literally 3 times before Mona was like \"he said FALOPIAN TUBE\" haha. Now it kind of makes sense since when you look at the actual dish, it's soft and clear. The waiter didn't really tell us which animal it was actually from. No wonder why they always took so long to prepare this dessert dish. I was telling Mona, \"maybe when you order 'Snow Frogs', the cook is in the back is gutting a dead woman for her tube\" haha. Kinda disgusting but that was my first thought. I'm glad they call it \"Snow Frog\" because nobody wants an order of fallopian tube lol. \n\nNow you guys know the secret of Snow Frog desserts so uhm Happy Eating?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-11-24", "description": "After dinner with 2 of my girl friends this past weekend, I was so excited to go to Candybar here in SF for drinks and dessert. But they happened to be closed on this particular Sunday, when they are normally opened. I was super bummed out! \n\nAs a result, we ended up at Kowloon Tong Dessert for your typical Hong Kong style desserts.\n\nOur server for the evening was Alvin.  Normally I dismiss servers at these HK dessert places as they normally don't care about service, but Alvin is an acception to this stereotype.  He noticed the three of us taking pictures of each other and cheerfully offered to take a picture for us.  \n\nWhile I'm not big on HK desserts, I settled instead my usual: The Waffle Sundae.  Joy and I shared this thing as it's clearly enough for 2-3 people.  It comes with 5 to 6 pieces of Waffle triangles and 3 different flavors of Ice Cream. We opted for the Green Tea, Strawberry and Mango flavor, and ordered it without whip cream.  \n\nCandice ordered the Coconut Sago with Tapoica and the three of us shared an order of Egg Puffs.  \n\nEgg Puffs are my favorite here with a nice vanilla flavor, and not overly doughy for my preference.  They also had a nice crunch to them as well that night. \n  \nOur Sundae arrived--only to notice that it had whip cream, when we requested for it without.  We flagged down Alvin.  He quickly and sympathetically apologized and offered to have another made for us.  He also asked if we wanted to keep the present sundae, which was declined.  But this is definitely a first for me.  \n\nI've had my share of negative experiences in Asian restaurants where they continue to pursuade you to keep the order or fight you to get you to believe it was your fault for not mentioning, or something of the sort.  But Alvin was so accomodating, and made sure our order was correct the next time around, and sure enough it was.  \n\nMy only complaint about the Waffle Sundae, is that the ice cream seemed to be topped with some sort of nasty crushed burnt peanuts which really ruined the sweetness for me.  But other than this, I enjoyed my sundae.\n\nCandice on the other hand, with her Coconut Sago and Tapipoca found her dessert unedible.  It was so bland and bitter with absolutely no coconut flavor.  Rather, it tasted of plain warm milk with tapoica.  She found it more pleasureable to try to see if she could take all of the tapioca balls out of her dessert just for the fun of it, as only one taste of it was enough for her.  Silly girl! \n\nService on this particular night was truly great for the first time here.  Both Alvin and the other server working that night were very friendly and continously refilled our hot tea.  We also found out that it was Alvin's first day working at Kowloon Tong, so I quickly praised him for the wonderful job he was doing!\n\nAll in all, while I was really excited about our original plans to go to Candybar for dessert, I had an awesome time chit chatting it up with my friends here.", "author": "Cass J."}

They also have real food and desserts so a little bit of something for everyone.\n\nI usually opt for the ice cream waffle sandwich because I'm a huge sucker for ice cream and anything ice cream related. The ice cream isn't the most amazing out there, nor is it awful though. It's fairly standard. The waffle is similar to an eggo waffle, and the texture of the sandwich with the ice cream is really good. I like getting the green tea flavor, but you can choose up to 2 flavors to share. They cut the sandwich 4 ways. \n\nMy friends like to get other things, and they usually seemed satisfied with their picking. \n\nProtip, they also have a special if you check in on yelp or facebook and spend a minimum, you get a free waffle ice cream sandwich!", "author": "Lena Y."}

Can I one of everything, please?\" was my initial thought.\n\nIt was quite overwhelming at first, deciding what to pick. Thankfully, the waiters were very patient and smiled as they immediately gave us free tea. Bonus points.\n\nAfter much deliberation (and I had quite a dilemma here!), I finally chose a mango flavored cold dessert with sticky rice and a variety of fruit. It was pretty good so I ate that thing in a couple of bites. Afterwards, my friends and I shared the popcorn chicken which tasted funky. The chicken wasn't cooked thoroughly and it wasn't crispy enough. Don't get the chicken here. Also, the waiter somehow lost one of my friend's order, which he didn't receive until 10 minutes later.\n\nKowloon Tong is a great place when you're out late with friends with nothing to do.

The prices are very affordable and the service is decent. It gets quite crowded after 10pm since they're open until 1 or 2am, but not in the daytime (opens around 3pm).

Instead of Macaroni, you can also choose instant noodles, soup rice noodles, fried noodles, fried rice noodles ($1 extra), or spicy instant noodles.) \n\nHOT DESSERTS:\nSteamed Milk Pudding - $3.50\n     (this one was definitely just average. I've had better. It also takes awhile to make...I waited over 20 mins for my order of this.)\nCoconut Milk Black Sticky Rice - $3.50\n     (this one is also average but it might just be due to my lack of enthusiasm for black sticky rice.)\nHomemade Peanut Tea - $3.50\nHomemade Almond Tea - $3.50\n      (All the \"homemade\" teas do not really taste homemade. They taste more like the instant powder packets you buy at the store. Regardless, they still taste good but may not be worth it's price since you can make this at home.)\n\nCOLD DESSERTS:\nMango Go Go - $4.25\n     (delicious! very fresh tasting!)\nWaffle Sundae (over the Ice Cream Waffle Sandwich) - $4.95\n     (I definitely recommend this one! Comes with 4 pieces of waffles and a bowl of ice cream. Share with a friend unless you're really hungry.)\nMixed Fruit with Mango Puree (w/Grass Jelly) - $4.25\n     (Another recommendation of mine! It's healthy and the fruits are very fresh! The best part is the puree! Instead of Grass Jelly, you can also choose sago, black sticky rice, or little glutinous balls.)\n  \nFRESH JUICE:\nWatermelon Juice - $3.25 (current special: $1.95)\n     (made from real watermelons so it's very fresh!)\n\nOverall, I would recommend ordering cold desserts over the hot ones.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-05-26", "description": "My search for the best Chinese dessert place in SF brought me to Kowloon Tong.  My progress so far: Golden Island (Outer Sunset) has inched out My Favorite Caf\u00e9 (Outer Richond) as my actual favourite caf\u00e9. I was really excited to see how this place compares. On first impression, the d\u00e9cor is not as modern as Golden Island, but also not as dingy as My Favorite Caf\u00e9.\n\nWhile it took second in terms of the d\u00e9cor, food-wise it's a distant third. My mom and I shared a HK-style waffle, HK-style French toast, black sesame glutinous balls in black sesame paste, and an egg custard with coconut milk and black sticky rice.\n\nThe HK-STYLE WAFFLE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwHhXgzuW8yYqILkwrhxdQ?select=dwAkwX5ah5LUSLo7ljUr0g) was filled with peanut butter and condensed milk (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwHhXgzuW8yYqILkwrhxdQ?select=am0awgm_JZpTBUBXfffFFQ), one of my favourite food combos. There was a decent amount of both and the ratio was perfect. The waffle itself was very crispy/crunchy, which can be a good or bad thing depending on what you like, but I prefer mine with a touch of softness.\n\nThe FRENCH TOAST was pretty good and had a really nice golden eggy crust (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwHhXgzuW8yYqILkwrhxdQ?select=g6LZYfaAoeaa59Wg9Gmz1A). They use one slice of thick bread instead of two thinner ones with kaya jam in the middle, so it needed a lot of syrup for moisture.\n\nFrom the Yelp pictures, their BLACK SESAME PASTE looked really good. The pics must've been touched up by Mariah Carey's photoshoppers though because in person it was lacklustre (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwHhXgzuW8yYqILkwrhxdQ?select=IR8bY8Sfp7EpnMV_-em8GQ). Instead of being densely black in colour, this one was slightly translucent and looked like it was made from a mix. Although I'm pretty sure they make it from scratch, they definitely don't use enough black sesame seeds so the flavour wasn't very strong. But, at least it wasn't too sweet. The SESAME BALLS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwHhXgzuW8yYqILkwrhxdQ?select=Fs81IFxLa7fRizSV_ZHPtA) could've used more black sesame too. There was too much dough and not enough filling :(\n\nThe most disappointing was the EGG CUSTARD. Blandest custard ever! No coconut milk flavour and (I can't believe I'm saying this) could've used more sugar. The crunch from the black sticky rice at the bottom was nice though (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwHhXgzuW8yYqILkwrhxdQ?select=LlckTpv2YSghYh-fTfEWJQ) and the custard itself had a really nice creamy consistency (maybe from the coconut milk?)\n\nOverall, it was OK. It's just not as good as MFC or Golden Island.", "author": "Steph L."}

Let me start with the good though...\n\nThe strawberry and banana smoothie= pretty good. Expensive ($3.75) for the size of it though...\n\nNow onto the dessert I ordered. Red bean glutinous rice ball with coconut milk taro sago. The coconut milk and taro of it was totally bleh! I honestly cannot describe the odd texture of it; it's like they just use powder or something to make it (and I've had sago many times for FREE at restaurants and it didn't taste this bad). The worse part though was...\n\nTHERE WAS HAIR IN TWO OF MY GLUTINOUS BALLS. Now, I'm generally the type of person who pushes the hair to the side and continue with my meal cause whatever, just one small piece of hair right?\n\nNO! This thing had a WHOLE LONG STRAND of hair in it! I bit half of it and as I was pulling the other half away from my mouth, I couldn't because of the hair that kept it together! Okay, whatever, just one bad one. Onto the next one, BAM! Another piece of hair in it. What the hell? \n\nThe waitress working at that time mostly overlooked everyone unless they 1). Just came in or 2). were about to leave. Finally, another worker came in and I called his attention to the problem. He said he'll tell someone about it. Okay...he goes and whispers something to his coworker who only smirks/smiles and does NOTHING. So I stared at her like...are you kidding me?!? She finally got the hint, I suppose, walked over and asked if I wanted another serving to make up for it?\n\nUh...okay, dude honestly. If you went to a restaurant and you discovered TWO LONG PIECES of hair in your food, would you want another serving of it? Probably not because there's a huge chance that there might be hair in that plate also!\n\nI don't think I'll be coming back here again...not for a long long time any ways.

The ice cream sandwich was very good! It was one giant waffle cut in half, stuffed with lots of bright pink ice cream that had frozen and fresh fruits. In the picture, we all thought it would be really fake fruits, since the ice cream was extremely artificially coloured. It was bright as Pepto Bismol, but good thing it didn't taste like it!

We're big pigs.\n\n-Watermelon juice: Tasted to standard.  Big cup.  \n-Mango puree/chunks with sticky rice & ice cream ($5.25): BEST desert of the night!  Ice cream is an extra $.75 but just having mango and sticky rice is good enough.  This reminds me of the Thai version of the dessert except the sticky rice is black and loosely held together.  Even though the menu didn't say, I think they did add some coconut milk to this.\n-Pork chop with egg noodle ($5.95): There aren't too many salty items on the menu but this was a pretty decent portion.  Satisfies the hunger but I probably wouldn't order it if I had other options nearby.  You basically pick your main carb (egg noodle, rice noodle, macaroni, etc.) then you pick your topping (pork chop, fried chicken wing, fried squid, tofu, etc.).\n-Coconut milk taro sago (hot): This is my comfort dessert... something my mom use to always make.  They put the right amount of coconut milk and the taro bits are nice and small.\n-Tortoise jelly: This wasn't as bitter as I've normally had it.  Nice, firm gelatin consistency with the right amount of syrup.\n-Waffle ice cream: Always good but the portion is huge; make sure you're sharing it so that you can get something else too.  The waffle comes out warm and crisp.

Also got to try these little ricefour balls coated with ground peanut...nice and simple, perfect chewiness.

This is not my favorite place for dessert, i think it's because i got sick of the selection. The service here is super slow, because they're always under staffed! at peak hour you see 1 waiter only and they are usually SUPER SLOWWW..... i use to come here quite often and noticed that workers here don't last very long. They're turnover rate is so quick, yet they keep on hiring slow workers. \n\nI like their XO sauce steam rice noodle, its pretty good. My usual orders are B-Kid grass jelly, it has grass jelly with mix fruits and a little bit of sweet milk added for flavor. it's really good! their mango madness is great for mango lovers! \n\nthe good thing about this place is it opens late.. so if you're looking for a late night gathering with desserts involved, this is the place to go.", "author": "Jenny G."}

There were plenty of parking spaces nearby. This place is packed! We walked in and for some reason, it smelled like hair dye. Weird? I think so.\n\nAnyways, there were 6 of us and only a couple of open seats. I saw the waiter move another party of 4 to another table so that they could accommodate us. Honestly, that was a bit rude. The party of 4 looked like they were already settled in chatting it up when the waiter told them to move. My friends and I could've waited for another seat to open up. I felt bad for them and would've been pissed if that happened to me!\n\nAnyways, the menus are encased in plastic. Like many Asian dessert places, the menus were crowded with all these desserts. A bit overwhelming if you ask me! It didn't take us long to decide though since we came here for their ice cream waffles. Since we were full from our dinner, we decided to get the banana ice cream waffle, a nutella and ice cream waffle, and I got the nutella ice cream waffle as well. The boys didn't order anything, they probably wanted to keep the figure. ;)\n\nThe waiter gave us some complimentary hot green tea in mismatched tea cups. I guess the default ice cream is vanilla? My waffle came with vanilla ice cream that looked really yellow. The waffle itself was not very warm, crispy, and tasted eggy which I didn't really like. I originially wanted strawberries with my nutella ice creamwaffle, but for some reason they didn't have strawberries. The prices are reasonable. A big waffle for under $5 is a-okay.\n\nI don't know if I'd come back to this place. Probably not, but we'll see!", "author": "Joyce E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-04-27", "description": "Got to Kowloon on a Monday a few minutes after they opened and surprisingly, my bf and I were the only folks in the restaurant and it remained that way for the first thirty minutes of our meal. Only a handful of people started rolling in afterwards. \n\nWe ordered salty and sweet items including the deep fried chicken wings with fries, XO sauce fried rice noodles, condensed milk and butter toast, and the ice cream waffle sandwich. The chicken wings were crunchy, a bit oily but not too salty. The wings came with waffle fries and although they were nice and crunchy, since they were fried in the same oil as the chicken wings, the waffle fries had too much of an asian flavor so it didn't pair that well with ketchup. I definitely could have passed on the XO sauce noodles as they were plain and on the dry side. The toast wasn't that special, just composed of a thick piece of white bread topped with condensed milk and butter. I think I would have been much happier with the french toast instead. As for the ice cream waffle sandwich, what our waiter called \"the main event\" as he brought it to our table...it was almost perfect. What is a big ice cream waffle sandwich cut into quarters, this dessert is made of yummy waffles, which I presume is made from the same delicious batter as the eggettes, that sandwich big hunky scoops of tasty vanilla ice cream. The waffle sandwich gets minus points because our waffles were not warm which I understand from other reviews, should be when the ice cream sandwich comes out! This may largely be due to the fact that when we placed our order, we asked the waiter if he could bring the ice cream sandwich to our table after we finished our savory foods and he said yes, we just have to give him a heads up. I have a feeling that the cook made the waffles right when we ordered everything and just added the ice cream when we gave our waiter the heads up. Next time, I'll know better. There is a happy hour special where you get a free hot drink if you order at least $5 from a certain part of the menu. I got a free hot milk tea which was really good with the added condensed milk.\n\nAlso, I just have to make a shout out to our waiter. It looks like some reviews have noted how funny and friendly this guy is. He really is just filled with enthusiasm, doing kung fu moves behind the counter as he chops up fruit, and overall is very friendly and nice. It was really humorous encountering him but he definitely made our meal pleasant and memorable. \n\nTo sum things up, Kowloon has lots of menu items so definitely take your time choosing what you order since items can either be a hit or a miss. Luckily, the menu prices are easy on the pocket. I do hope to return, maybe get the same waiter, and try some different things.", "author": "Maya S."}

Sure, the customers also have to check in Yelp or Facebook but Kowloon Tong makes it easier for them since it offers free WI-FI. Other than that, their Asian desserts and snacks are standard. There is a large variety to choose from but I always stick with the mixed fruits sago, an egg puff, French fries, or the steamed rice noodle with sriracha sauce, hoisin sauce, and peanut butter sauce (my absolute fave). Most dishes range between $3-$8 so it's definitely affordable.

At $5.50 for late-nite service, I can't complain.  Also got the fried tofu with garlic, which was fuggin good.

We were finally able to get a table added and sat down. Then the waiter comes to our table and says that he refuses to provide service and we were dumfounded.

First of all you can't hide your manager from customers when they ask it's just bad service. We proceeded to ask if the manager was even there and they said \"No he's not\" so we then asked who was in charge then and the waiter replied snottily \"We are ALL in charge\". This wasn't the worst part. A woman in our party went followed one of the employees to the cash register and asked what we did wrong and all they could reply was \"We don't have to serve you\" she then asked for the manager again and the employee picked up a note pad and started yelling at her \"If you have a problem write it on this and I'll give it to my manager!\" As he was saying that he inched closer and closer to her face while making dramatic movements eith the pen and notepad and ended his sentence with slamming the notepad and pen on the counter in front of her. I don't know why they let go of good business JUST because they refused to add a table for a 8 person party AND on top of that they yelled at one of our female party members and made her feel threatened enough to the point where she was afraid and had to back away and ask if he was going to hit her.

It is off of Geary but on the corner of a street full of houses. \nIt was pretty busy when we got there but we were seated immediately. Five minutes later, there was a line outside waiting for seats. This place is open till pretty late so people tend to stay and linger and chat which is nice for catching up. \nThey have a lot of fruity stuff and a big selection of different types of asian desserts. The waiter we had was super friendly and took the time to explain to us what certain things were unlike some other asian places where they are really quick with you and are kinda rude. \nI really enjoyed the waffle ice cream sandwich and the mango sago.

The place can be really busy at night and they don't seem to have enough waiters/waitresses so asking for napkins or tea can get frustrating. This place is usually the last place I would consider going if I was craving for late night snacks.", "author": "Lucy C."}

It is what it is at Kowloon Tong--simple, cozy Hong Kong style cafe with friendly service to boot (even to me a non-Chinese speaker). \n\nI keep coming back for their HK style milk tea--the best in the city (and battle the ones I had in Oakland Chinatown); egg puff, and their sago anything! Once in a blue moon I'll order something savory...I suggest taking a look at their day's special as so far they haven't disappointed. \n\nLove that they're open late and have plenty of tables. Quick service (for the most part) is another added bonus. Go to Kowloon Tong for a plethora of Asian desserts and savory bites as well.", "author": "Marie B."}

My first time there, I was deciding between \"snow frog\" or the white fungus/steamed papaya (a warm, sweet soup with chewy white fungus and small stewed papaya chunks...as tasty as it sounds). \n\nI asked our nice waiter if the \"snow frog\" was real frog, to which he replied \"oh yes, it is actually the fallopian tube of the frog\". Tempting, but it was outweighed by being slightly perturbed at ingesting part of a female frog's reproductive system. \n\nThat dish threw me off, and I forgot to ask him what the \"tortoise jelly\" was.

I came again last night after watching Wicked (GREAT musical, by the way), and I have to admit the service was a lot better. Maybe it was just the two workers who happened to be working last night? Who knows.\n\nBut anywho, the first lady who took our order was pretty chill. My friend ordered the shaved ice with ice cream (which is $1 more). Normally all their shaved ices come with a free topping (mango, grass jelly, strawberries, mixed fruits, etc) but my friend just wanted the ice cream with no free topping. The waitress kinda gave that surprised \"Oh wtf?\" look and we all started laughing. And my friend was like \"What? Is that not normal or something?\" She eventually ordered it with the mixed fruits so she could be \"normal\". It was pretty funny.\n\nAnd then another guy brought us our tea, and one of my friends and I were very familiar with the cups (they were from Ikea). We were like \"HEY! These cups look super familiar!\" And the guy just said \"Ikea.\" And we busted out laughing. He was really funny too.\n\nIt took a while for the food to come, but I can't blame them since only two people are working with a somewhat-packed cafe. The shaved ice was good, pretty crunchy though. I'm more used to a more finely-crushed iced. I actually really liked the popcorn chicken as well. Like the other reviewer mentioned, they're popcorn chicken is a lot more less greasy than the ones you'd get at Quickly's. We also ordered the Sundae Waffle. The same guy who brought us our teas even asked us what kind of ice cream we want. Normally, they just give us the original strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla. So he gets a thumbs up from me.\n\nI know I'm talking about the tea guy a lot, but he was just so funny! So I ordered a popcorn chicken to-go to bring back home. A majority of my friends were already waiting outside or heading to their cars. So it was kind of just me sitting there.

The prices all seemed fairly cheap, definitely far from expensive, which is another plus if you're out late and don't want to blow a ton of cash on late-night snacks.\n\nIt did get crowded after awhile, but at no point was it ever overwhelmingly loud or obnoxious. Overall the experience was pleasant, and I think I definitely found a new place to hangout in the evenings.", "author": "Will C."}

But yesterday I came in around midnight and there were tons of ppl, if you're not sitting near the register, it's really hard to get their attention, the customer service was horrible, food took forever to come out. But it was one of the few places still open late on a Monday night. The only reason I'm giving them 3 stars is because my past experiences were good, just don't expect to get good service when the place is packed", "author": "Stephanie T."}

That's crazy.\n\nWe had a group of 8 and we were bunched up in the tables where the drinks/desserts are made. I think our sitting area was blocking the waiters from working efficiently and so the guy waiter asked if we wanted to sit somewhere else. I think there was some sort of miscommunication because the young female waiter with braces was proceding to sit another group at our table.\n\nWe moved tables and we ordered our desserts. I ordered the mixed fruits with honeydew puree with grass jelly. It consisted of some pieces of strawberries, mangoes (probably frozen), honeydew, cantaloupe, watermelon, pieces of grass jelly, sugar water, coconut milk/watered down condensed milk and some blended honeydew pieces. It tasted okay, but not the greatest. People usually go to these dessert places mainly to catch up, not to rave about how \"great\" the food was. \n\nThey make really good waffles though. \n\nWe didn't even get napkins. \n\nThe young female waitress with braces seemed to be annoyed at us though. We ordered some eggettes but they didn't come. We asked her like 3xs and we just decided to cancel it. I understand if the place is really busy...but they really need to hire more people. For instance, 2 waiters and 2 people making the drinks, and 1-2 people in the kitchen making the \"real\" food.", "author": "Jay Z."}

Their cooking/waiting staff seemed small which isn't a great idea when the place is usually packed. The waiter would take a while getting back to us when refilling tea but I appreciated that he decently would come back to our table to inform us that a certain dish would take a certain amount of time longer and that when they took down an order wrong, he would apologize and redo the order properly. What I liked best was the large variety of HK comfort food available. A super simple scrambled egg sandwich on soft white bread without the crust...MMM like momma used to make. Their egg puffs are decent enough but nothing overly memorable. I am saddened that they don't do pearl tea and their honeydew smoothie didn't even taste like honeydew.

We were off by 30 cents from the $20 promotion and the new waiter did not allow us to claim it. We asked the waiter we've seen for months and, after checking our order to confirm, gave us the promotion without hesitation. We understood the new waiters were only following their rules and have not developed the boundaries that the seasoned waiters have.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-01-20", "description": "Kowloon Tong is another in a series of dessert cafes seemingly lifted straight out of Hong Kong and across the Pacific Ocean. So for fans of Hong Kong-style dessert, or anyone looking for a place to burn the midnight oil while indulging that sweet tooth, this place should be right up your alley, almost. \n\nFor all sorts of reasons, most of the dessert here has the dubious honor of being average. A problem I find typical of California versions of Hong Kong restaurants is the quality of fruit isn't the same, which has more to do with America's stringent importation rules than owner's ability to select ingredients. But whoever's to blame, it leaves Kowloon Tong not needing to be a priority on your list of choices for Cantonese dessert.\n\nAs you'll notice on the menu, Kowloon Tong has everything standard for Hong Kong dessert cafes. My hands-down favorite dessert ever, Mango & Pomelo Sago (they call it Mango-Go-Go, Yueng Chi Gum Lo) is a sweet soup of tiny tapioca balls meant to be just barely squishy. Tough and chewy a la its bigger tapioca pearl brother (the infamous boba), the way it's done here, is not the way to go. Also, the mango and pomelo just isn't as good for the aforementioned reason. \n\nThere's also the Steamed Milk Custard (Dun Lai), which comes in a variety of soup base flavors, like ginger (our choice) or various fruits. It's usually solid, and came served in a semi-liquid state, which is disappointing. \n\nAnd Hong Kong cafes wouldn't be complete without the hot snacks. Curry Fish Balls (Ka Lei Yu Daan) are above average, using your typical curry-out-of-a-canister-but-still-okay flavoring. Seven to eight fish balls half an inch in diameter, for four dollars however, makes it just out of reach of 'worth it'.\n\nStill, despite the gloom and doom of being average, there's a not-so-hidden gem to be found. On the main window is plastered a sign in Chinese promoting their Kaak Chi Beng, with no English translation. (It is on the menu but you'd have no idea that it's a big deal.) Too bad, because this Ice Cream Waffle is clearly their specialty and the best thing they serve. A generous scoop of ice cream between two freshly toasted maple syrup infused waffles. It smells good and tastes better. Also plastered on the window is their Egg Waffle (Kai Daan Chai), but having not tried it I'll stick to vouching for the Waffle and its derivatives. (Other customers did order a Waffle Sundae, the same thing only not in cake form which I'm sure is equally amazing.)\n\nKowloon Tong isn't the most user-friendly place to get your dessert fix without bringing either a Cantonese-speaking buddy or someone who has been to these kinds of places with you. The menu has a billion items on it and few of the English names are indicative of what you'll actually get (a common problem with English translations of Chinese dishes). The place itself is equally unfriendly to the uninitiated: loud people, loud TV blaring, and dirty in a clean way but dirty still. It didn't help that in one sitting I witnessed two incidents of customers having hair in their dessert. \n\nStill, come for the Ice Cream Waffle. I suggest elsewhere for your other Hong Kong indulgences.", "author": "Daniel H."}

Their waffles were good, I am sure they used the same batter as the egg puffs but who cares, it is still good. The second time I came here I ordered the mango sago I think and my boyfriend ordered the waffle with nice cream. The mango sago, was not that good. I shouldn't really order mango in restaurants because it always taste creamy and I think that mango and dairy does not mix. The waffle sundae was pretty good, tasted the same, but now they have those HUGE plastic things to put in on and it looks more nice, instead of using plates.

My friends and I walked in and a bunch of fobs were just sitting their playing cards, some were waiters, they were kind of rude saying \"wow are they going to order\" in chinese, and of course I knew what they said as a chinese speaking girl.

It's fresh and delicious and fun to eat.  \n\nBut you have to ask for the free tea otherwise you won't get it.  And by the time you are choking on your egg puff, it's too late.\n\nupdate 8/20/07:\nService last night was so atrocious we almost cried: not sure from laughing too hard at our pathetic selves for allowing them to treat us this way, or simply from the pain of waiting.  Four of us ordered three items as the waiter carefully wrote down everything (he could have been scribbling down his own grocery list for all we know, since he didn't remember what we ordered.)   Minutes later, I got my Longan Ice, which was a bunch of longans soaked in a sprite with ice.  Then people started to come in and they seem to have completely forgotten about us.  After we watched other tables getting their food, we mentioned to our waiter our food hasn't arrived yet.  Twenty minutes later, our friend's ice cream with waffle came.  The waffle was cold by then (we actually could see the waffle being made behind the counter and then managed to sit there completely neglected.)   We mention to the waiter again.  He says it's coming.  It's not.  Our friend lost her patience and said that she could go stand by the counter and wait.  He said, oh no, it's coming.  So we waited.  And indeed it came, and it was a LONGAN ICE!!!  We all sorta jumped and were like, no! that's not the dish that's missing!  We already got our longan ice!  \n\nAnd the rest of the night went by fairly fast: we waited for the taro coconut sago dish.  It finally came.  My boyfriend inhaled it because we have been there for an hour by then and people need to get home because it's a SUNDAY night!  And of course, they messed up on the sago and substituted it with tapioca instead.  But that's okay, because we probably won't be going back anytime soon.

First of all the place stinks like something died in there.  I thought I would give this place the benefit of the doubt since people raved about the waffle sundae.  We took 1 bite and walked out.  Basically cheap ice cream and stale waffles.  What a waste of time and money.  You could not pay me to go back to this dump.", "author": "Chicago N."}

They have really cute tea cups there, but service is a bit slow when it's busy. They don't have that many options, a lot more fruit dessert items. \n\nBut this place is opened late and fun to hang out w/ late at night w/ friends. The people and service is nice. Try the Frog Fat dessert. :)", "author": "lily l."}

Our table's food took FOREVER to arrive. I'd say about 1.5 hour. Asked another waitress, put our order in cuz the first waitress probably forgot. Then she came over and gave us a free bowl of fruits. Yay? Haha, I'm not mean but time is money. And I need my beauty sleep. Anyways, food-wise, this place has never disappointed me. From french toast to sagos to noodles. All pretty good.", "author": "Jimmy N."}

We came on a Friday, which is one of the few days they have warm tofu soup with red bean paste.  It was delish.  The tofu was silky, creamy and soothing as it slid down my throat, and the red bean gave it just enough sweetness.  My friend likes black (tortoise?) jelly, so he got that with some fresh fruit, such as mangoes, watermelon, honeydew, and strawberries.  I didn't care so much for that bitter, black jelly, but the fruit was fresh.  I would definitely come here again.", "author": "sarisha h."}

But speaking of tea, I don't like the tea they serve you either, it's always lukewarm. The only time I come here is when I'm forced to, which is basically when My Favorite Cafe or 100% is closed. Majority of their menu doesn't appeal to me and the only thing that I think is decent here might be their sundae and that's it. But I will say that the good thing about it is that you never have to wait long for seats.", "author": "Kari G."}

You get your own tea, napkins etc. Have a long wait to order, may get your order wrong and can't get your bill.

My friend and I shared the steamed rice crepe, and it was pretty good for a snack.  But as for food to fill you up?  The selection isn't so broad.  When you go here, you find yourself debating whether you want savory or sweets, and that night, I only had a few bucks on me so I wasn't about to go crazy.  Obviously, I chose savory, with the steamed rice crepes, while my other two friends got the Super Mango dessert, Coconut Milk with Sweet Rice, and milk tea.  I tried each of their desserts too, and the Super Mango was pretty good with the mango ice cream, and balls of melon and fresh fruit.  The coconut milk dessert was interesting...it tasted so heavenly at first, but once you stir and mix it up with the sweet rice (which looks like red bean if you ask me), it tastes nothing close to heaven. The milk tea was a bit bland too; I tasted more water than milk or tea?  Questionable.  Well, maybe this just wasn't a good round with Kowloon, but I wouldn't mind going again to taste the other snacks/desserts on their menu.  Oh yeah, the service kinda sucks, considering that they spend more of their time watching the latest chinese soap opera on the one television that they have, than catering to you.", "author": "Jasmine T."}

Not really the best dessert place but it's not all that bad either .. it just really depends what you order . The deep fried chicken wings are good . The soya chicken wings are alright . The egg puffs are too hollow .  The grilled squid is nasty .. it's actual dried up squid . The strawberry is nasty as well . Too much milk and not sweet at all . The sesame filled glutinous balls are alright . It's not from the freezer .. they actually make it themselves ! The Mixed Fruit Strawberry Sago is okay .. just be sure to mix it all up before you eat it . I like how it wasn't super sweet . The mango pudding is too sweet or something .. tastes a little odd . But I do like how they put pieces of mango in it . The papaya milkshake and mango shaved ice is alright . The tortoise jelly is good . The squid balls are pretty good too . They're thicker than fishballs and they taste more interesting . The HK style waffle is hella good . The HK Milk Tea w/ Coffee is good . But the Coffee w/ Condensed Milk is a lot better . I'm so addicted to it :) I'm esp. addicted to the deep fried soya tofu . They open till 1 Sunday - Thursday while other dessert places in SF and millbrae close at 12 .

We ordered sweet sticky rice with fruits and sweet sticky rice with coconut milk along with the coconut saga. The time it took for these bowls to come out were extremely slow. The funny thing was the one with the fruits came out first them the sticky rice alone and then the saga. I enjoyed my sticky rice but it could have been better. My friend did not recieve his saga until about 40 minutes later after my friends and i were finished. To top it off, there was a piece of hair in his bowl. They took it back but it seemed like they just reboiled it. I dont kno if I would try this place again. Next time I might just go to Creations on 17th and geary.
