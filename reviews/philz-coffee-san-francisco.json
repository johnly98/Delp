This was one of the places I was looking forward to when coming back to California. I didn't even know Philz started in SF! I am so lucky to have stayed a few blocks away from this location. I came here probably every day and sometimes even multiple times a day when i was in SF.\n\nYou can not go wrong with any drink you order here. I am normally not the biggest fan of coffee but I can drink Philz coffee for days! I wish they would open one in NYC. \nThis place is kind of unorganized as the line is suppose to start at the back but people who don't know just walk up to the counter, skipping everyone who is waiting. You order at the counter and pay at the cash register!\n\nThe staff are always nice and friendly! I love this location!", "author": "Flora L."}

This flagship location is located right on 24th in the mission. \n\nPhilz Coffee is a personalized experience. They don't have the traditional drinks of a classic cafe, yet provide a menu with beans from around the globe. When you walk in, you approach one of the baristas and give your order. They'll always check with you on the milk content and the sweetness, and after they serve it will always check it's up to your standard. Philz brews their coffees one cup at a time, so perhaps don't go when you're in a crunch. \n\nA couple of their drinks contain fresh mint, but the one I find myself always returning to is the Mint Mojito. It's sweet and creamy and is topped with a fresh mint. I'll admit the name is what drew me in, but the taste has me coming back. Their coffee is definitely one of the more caffeinated ones, so beware.\n\nBlue Bottle, Philz, and Equator are my top choices for coffee in San Francisco.", "author": "Navila H."}

I grabbed my handy Yelp tumbler with lid and reusable straw and headed over to get some work done. All the table and couch spaces were filled so I ended up sitting outside. The wifi is still plenty strong so it was all good. \n\nI'm not a huge coffee drinker but I've always been happy when I've grabbed something at Philz. Bring your own cup and save a buck. I got the mocha tesora with medium sugar and cream. My barista put less ice, which was GREAT. It was just enough to cool it down without condensation forming all over my cup. The mocha tesora was creamy, a little frothy with strong coffee notes and a hint of sweetness. Next time, I think I could even go with light cream and sugar as I felt like I wasn't even drinking coffee anymore! Super smooth overall and I'm sure even without the cream there would be little bitterness. \n\nOverall, definitely stop by if you're looking for a good cup of joe in a low key spot. The baristas are friendly and the shop very cozy.", "author": "Liza X."}

I've been dreaming of a chocolatey and smooth DW for a couple years now. \n\nI roll up to the place, expecting the usual crazy line.

I'm so glad a few years later I decided to give it a second chance due to a friend visiting out of town. We got the mint mojito iced coffee as well as the tesora. They were both phenomenal! I suppose my barista the first time I went wasn't the best because this time around I could tell the coffee as great, and I like how you they will customize about almost everything in your drink (ice, sweetness, milk) so you dont have to do it yourself. I'm usually a black coffee drinker but I'll make an exception for a philz mint mojito. \n\nI cant recall if they serve food here but I also went to a different location where they served a walnut banana greek yogurt with some honey drizzle, and it was amazing!

I like dark roast, or at least I thought I did, I always drink the dark roast at coffee places but holy, this was, way too much for me. My boyfriend had one of the medium roasts and that too wasn't great for me. This place is super cool though and definitely has a bunch of people working here who are super passionate about what they do. The girl helping us was knowledgable but she did recommend the brew I got as one of the most favorited cups so I was disappointed. She was also unable to tell me whether or not the coffee was made straight from the beans or if there were added sugar in there. The calories on the board indicate the coffees can be 200 calories and change so when I asked about that she didn't have an answer. Luckily a gentleman working behind the register was able to tell me that the coffee is straight from the bean and the calorie counts are from the cream and sugar people can add to it. Again, super cool spot. My boyfriend liked his cup and he also got an almond croissant that was bomb. The coffee definitely isn't cheap but this place does coffee right, even though I didn't like it, I can understand why people do. They indicate what flavors you're going to get from each brew, which is awesome. I'd definitely try this spot again if I come to town however going with a lighter roast would probably be best, for me!", "author": "Samantha S."}

Friendly employees too.\n\nI came with a friend, and we sat on the couch, and boy, those couches are hella comfortable... maybe too comfortable. They're soft without much integrity, so you start sinking in and want to fall asleep.

Iced coffee is a dollar more than hot ones which i dont quite understand, but I sprung for one anyway. I got the Gingersnap with vanilla soy and it was sweet enough for me without asking for additional sweetener. For some reason tops for the cups are available only upon request which makes things needlessly chaotic. I saw a man topple his coffee over seconds after retrieving it.

I'd been meaning to check out this Philz location for a while, and I was so glad when I finally did!!\n\nThere's a lot of room (multiple tables, couches, outdoor seating) and quite a few power outlets. There's also a lot of super hip decor throughout the store. I think part of the ceiling was painted with clouds, there was a buncha cool painted artwork on the walls, stickers, signage, all adding to the authenticity of this place\n\nMy two go-to drinks are Philtered Soul (sweet and creamy or medium medium) and iced yerba mate with almond milk and honey (medium medium or medium almond milk and light honey). Philtered Soul is a medium blend with aromas of hazelnut flavor and chocolate, and yerba mate is tea with aromas of Earth, grains, and toast. I haven't tried the food at this location, but most of the choices seem the same as at the others. I'm a fan of the ancho chile breakfast burrito and the apricot bar!!  I think there's even a Mission location special where the blend of the month is $4 for a large and $3 for a small instead of the regular $4.50 and $3.50??\n\nBottom line: If you're a fan of Philz, you've gotta check out this location!!

Went during a recent visit to San Francisco and ended up going to three different Philz in a five day span.

They had many unique blends and recipes and wish I got to try them all, however just tried two -- the Mint Mojito and Julie's Ultimate. \n\nMint Mojito: This was by far the most recommended by friends who lived in SF and my favorite out of many coffees I've tried, ever! It's Sweet, Creamy and includes a freshly picked Mint Leaf (they pick the lead in front of you from a mint plant) ($5.50 for large). It comes Iced and you have the option of making it decaf. I got this on two different visits and love it. \n\nJulie's Ultimate: This is one of the Darker Coffee Blends and the recipe includes Berry, Toast and Vanilla ($4.50 for a large). This was ok and I tasted subtle hints of the vanilla and berry flavors, but a bit too bitter for my taste to be honest. \n\n- Food: We didn't get to try the food, but different locations had different varieties and options. The one we went to in the Mission had cookies and baked goods, while the one we went to near Berkeley had a full spread, including an Avocado Toast that looked really good!\n\n- Service: The service by the baristas and the cashiers was great -- they were friendly, helpful and made sure we got our coffees the way we wanted them. \n\nOverall, Philz was a great experience and I can't way to go back the next time I visit San Francisco area.", "author": "Amit J."}

Perfectly refreshing, the fresh and perfectly excessive amounts of mint gave it this beautiful early flavor that was just perfect for a sunny stroll through the mission.\n\nI was definitely a little confused by the location so I went with the flow--got in line, ordered my drink. sat at the bench facing all the coffee brewers, and then took my drink to the counter. \n\nThis location is nice, lots of seating, with some outdoor tables/chairs too and it's pet friendly!", "author": "Nerissa C."}

What's too sweet for you may be just sweet enough for your friend, and what's too bland for your friend may be just enough flavor for you. How can everyone agree on a good coffee shop, then?\n\nWell, for starters, the baristas at Philz will ASK you to try your coffee and see how much you like it before you take it. Like, they'll leave the cover off and actually wait for you to take a couple of sips to see if they should make any adjustments to suit YOUR taste buds before sending you off on your morning. How sick is that?!\n\nI tried the Tesora, with medium cream and no sugar which is how I usually like my coffee. Oh my god dude. Please believe me when I say this is the BEST coffee I've had in recent memory, and maybe ever. And when I took the first sample sip and my barista asked how it was, I wanted to jump on the counter and yell in his face \"OMG DUDE THIS IS F'ING AMAZING! THANKS FOR ASKING, NOBODY HAS EVER DONE THAT BEFORE!\". But alas, I was still a little groggy (7AM) and could only mutter \"oh yeah, it's pretty good.\" Man. Top 5 regrets in my life.\n\nThe Tesora is just like the menu describes - deliciously nutty and buttery. It was actually so rich that I would probably get lighter cream next time so I could enjoy the coffee flavor more. And I'm the type of person that usually gets a LOT of cream because I'm too much of a little bitch to drink it black.

I drink my coffee black so I really taste the differences between the coffees, and honestly you can't go wrong with either. They also have decent breakfast burritos here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-06", "description": "DATE OF VISIT: ~April 2015.\n\nAlong with Peet's Coffee, Philz is a Bay Area institution. If you're thinking about doing a culinary tour of SF, one of your stops should be this particular branch of Philz Coffee as this is considered to be the very first location. Both Peets and Philz represent the forefront of the second and third wave coffee, respectively. \n\n1st wave: Focus is on mass-production, though the quality was inferior compared to today's coffee. Think Folger's.\n2nd wave: Focus is improving the coffee-drinking experience through higher-quality blends, speciality espresso drinks and the introduction of the modern coffee house. Peet's was the inspiration for Starbucks, which is the quintessential example of a 2nd gen brand.\n3rd wave: Focus is on coffee itself as an artisanal product with care taken in each step of production. Philz, along with Blue Bottle is considered to be the forerunners of third wave coffee in the Bay Area.\n\nAs the original Philz location it feels quite different from the other Philz scattered across the other parts of the Bay. It has a more home-grown vibe to it whereas the other Philz shops seem to come across as more \"manufactured\". Of note is the sign that advertises itself as a Philz location - you don't see that familiar Philz sign on the outside. Compared to a lot of other shops where I can get a book or a laptop and get work done provided there's free wifi this place feels more lounge-y. The couches and chairs are more conducive to relaxing and I could see myself attending an open-mic performance here. Compared to the other coffee shop nearby this certainly blends in with the other Mission businesses.\n\nI only came across this place because it was the closest coffee shop next to the house the No1DP and I were staying through Airbnb. I only found out after the fact that this was the original Philz Coffee. Aside from that the significance behind this particular branch was I got through the last few days studying for my big board exam by drinking Philz. \n\n1. First drink was a Philtered Soul, black. I was (and still am) fairly new to drinking coffee black and Philz along with Peet's are the only brands that I can drink. This is a lighter roast with hints of chocolate. Its inherent sweetness is the reason I can take it black. \n2. The No1DP surprised me on the day of my big exam with a cup of Tantalizing Turkish, a croissant and a t-shirt. As mentioned in my Oakland/College Philz review I fell in love with this drink at first sip because of the cardamom and mint sprig. The croissant was buttery and flaky, a sign of a croissant done right. The shirt was a memento and I treasured it until I tore it due to crashing my ATV. DIdn't get another shirt until more than 6 months later.\n\nGoes without saying that this particular visit to Philz is one of my fondest memories of the Bay Area. Every time I think of Philz it makes me realize how much I miss it up there.", "author": "Isabella B."}

Though this might have been a new concept in the US, I have had similar coffee in India in rural villages (I know right!) which have been much more flavorful. Also, $3.5 is a little steep IMO.

They use Califia Farms almond milk (barista version) which is the best! It is super creamy, chocolatey and satisfying. I suggest getting it half sweet!\n\nThe service was great here (as usual). The barista was friendly and crafted my drink exactly the way I wanted. \n\nThis store in particular looks different from the others. In LA the stores are more modern and \"clean\" looking. This has that \"hippie\" vibe that matches the Mission area. Looks like a great place to relax for a morning/ afternoon coffee. They have a small selection of pastries/ sandwiches as well. \n\nPhilz is always a great experience. Best brewed coffee store!", "author": "Natalie K."}

The staff chuckled like i was some naive child and informed me it doesnt work that way, i had to not order at the register, but must go to a special waiting area at the back of the shop before i could be graced with a barista to hand craft my beverage. Only then may i order my food and pay.\n\nFast forward they give me coffee and refuse to let me put in cream and sugar. They demand on doing it like Dunkin Donuts. I ask if i can please do it since i know what i like and they do not. They refuse, pour cream in my drink and serve it to me. I am obviously upset and they begrudgingly take the coffee back, pour it down the drain and make a new one. Finally they pass me the cream so i can add it to my own drink like an adult. \n\nMeanwhile, they never made a ticket for my breakfast sandwich so i am left waiting another 10 minutes for that.\n\nNever returning to this place.", "author": "Alek C."}

You would anticipate the wait to be long since there are several drinks to be made, but the speed and poise of the baristas make the lines dissipate smoothly. \n\n- You could tell each Barista have a few regulars waiting specifically for their barista be available. They never hesitated to spark a quick and sincere conversation.  Each had their own unique personality without the standard perfunctory you typically get at an establishment. \n\nSHOUTOUT: I'm not a coffee connoisseur, so I am pretty open minded on how my coffee is prepared.

It's not as spectacular as visiting the original Starbucks or anything.  And when you go in it's the same routine like any other Philz you've visited.  Line up, order at the barista, pay for your drink at the cashier, and wait till your barista calls out your drink.  I guess being at the place were it all started does add some allure to the location while you enjoy your coffee there.\n\nA few things I do notice that about the Original Philz:\n-The decor is very cozy and feels more like a lounge than a coffee house.\n-This place is small and the tables can fill up rather quick\n-Drinks seem to taste a little stronger here\n\nI can't believe there was a time when I was intimidated to walk inside.  The experience I gathered from Philz in South San Francisco helped me get a better understanding for how the system went so now that when I go in, I can order my Philtered Soul like a boss!", "author": "Rodney H."}

This is the original Philz where Phil was concocting blends that are now being loved at 21 coffee shops in the Bay Area. \n\nPhilz has lots of different coffees to choose from. My recommendations below: \n\nDark Roast-jacobs wonderbar named after Philz son Jacob who is now head of the company. \n\nMedium roast-Tesora lots of good options here. This is a great starter and was Philz first blend that he took 7 years to perfect!\n\nLight roast-new Manhattan good clean slightly fruity cup\n\nSpecialty coffee-iced mint mojito sweet and creamy. One of the best beverages I've ever had. Can't recommend this drink enough. If it's a hot day in the mission try this one out. Even karl the fog is in town this drink won't let you down. \n\nPhil himself is known to come in the store often and knows a lot of the regulars. \n\n@management of Philz, step up your pastry game. Not bad but would love to see the attention given to the pastries as the coffee. \n\nTremendous coffee and best service at coffee shop in the city. Always a good day when you stop in at Philz.", "author": "Kevin B."}

Just like their people, homegrown, outspoken, not a bad or corporate vibe anywhere.  Their iced mint mojito is refreshing. \n\nI came in another time and wanted a different unique type of drink, and because I didn't want to admit I couldn't read their coffee menu above(since I misplaced my eyeglasses for nearsightedness), I got a bit blas\u00e9 and ordered a horchata flavored iced coffee.  IT WAS NOT ON THE MENU (which I did not find out 'til later) even though I assumed it would be since this philz was in the heart of Latino country on 24th st near Mission St.   He was shocked, but like any great barista, he picked it up and asked me if I liked cinnamon and I said yes!! and he did a great job with it!! \n\nTheir wi-fi is one of the best although the number of outlets is limited to near the couches.  They've got newspapers strewn across their couches if you forgot your laptop or tablet.  They've got outdoor seating, great on a sunny day to chat with a friend.  They're packed in the weekday daytime which doesn't quiet down until afternoon/night although most of the customers are pretty occupied on their laptop or tablet.  Because their shop is small, I would not go in with lots of friends-maybe maximum 3 or 4. Their restroom (which has a number password which you have to ask from the baristas or clerk) is clean but bare and unisex so if you're a woman, bring along your own toiletries and LOTS of it. And remember to lock the door since it doesn't automatically lock once you're inside.   The 12 bus and 48 buses stop on the intersection outside.

The line wraps inside the store like a snake so I hope you have some patience or have some time to burn. The place is packed with all sorts of interesting personalities including all the gifted baristas behind the counter (the Jack Black twin doppelg\u00e4nger is a funny dude). This place totally reminds me of a spot that should be located down in LA, Silverlake Junction area in particular. It'll definitely fit in and it'll also do us Angelinos a favor if they ever decide to open one near us. We won't have to trek norte to get some of Phil'z good brew. Not to mention, it would probably give Intelligentsia Coffee a run for their money. \n\nEach drink is individually crafted to perfection. It seemed to me that each coffee drink required its own brand new filter. I'm sure they're using some \"greener\" approach to the filters. As you wait patiently in line, the menu will have you drawing blanks due to its extensiveness. Choose between dark, medium, or light roasts. The names alone are catchy: Ambrosia Coffee of God or the Canopy of Heaven just to name a few. You can't go wrong with the mint mojito ice coffee. I think that's their best seller. The mint brings the brew to the next level. For you non-coffee drinkers, they also have teas available.\n\nIt was a short visit to the bay, but I hit up Philz Coffee twice and got to sample a few hot and cold drinks from them. Each cup of joe was far from disappointment. With caffeine fixes like this, it's no wonder coffee is one of US's most popular legal drug. Love the baristas and their upbeat attitude.

My husband and I stopped in for a cup of coffee before a show and were told to stand behind the line if a very rude and abrupt manner before we were even greeted.  I took notice of the different treatment that a white man entering the coffee shop received shortly after. He actually go a \"hello\" and a smile. You know, the way a customer should be greeted.  \n\nRather than take our order, this barista proceeded to have a long social conversation with a \"friend\" who recognized her, completely ignoring my husband and I standing there, waiting to order a simple cup of coffee. After about FOUR MINUTES of their mind-numbing valley girl conversation and us waiting to be acknowledged, I finally interrupted saying \"excuse me, can we place our order\" to which she responded \"actually can you please wait behind the line like I told you? I am busy with this order and having a conversation with my friend.\"  At this point, I told her that we did not need to give our business to a place that would employ such a rude (and racist) employee and that she actually doesn't get paid to socialize and ignore customers.  \n\nTo this barista, I hope you are reading this-- Your ugly, unkempt impostafarian dreadlocks make you neither \"ethnic\" nor interesting, and your job does not make you cool. I know you are living the hipster dream as a barista in the mission, but you better recognize what neighborhood you're in and respect the people who have more of a legitimate claim to it that your phony ass does-- and if this is too hard for you to do,  then at the very least, do your freaking job and serve people coffee.

There's usually enough seating for one person, and lots of outlets too - however it's tough to find a spot for two people, especially during high traffic times.\n\nSurprisingly, I've found that in general there's not very much line at all, at any time of the day when I've visited. In general, no complaints about this place, and I'm sure to take someone here first if they're visiting the Bay Area and have never experienced Philz.", "author": "Noah G."}

The menu confused the hell out of me so I stopped trying to understand it and just waited until it was my turn, hoping the barista would be patient with me. \n\nThe set-up is just one long line and then there are 2-3 baristas at their own little station and whenever one of them is open they will call \"next in line!\" and then you go up to their little spot to discuss your coffee. When it was my turn I told my barista babe that it was my first time there and asked if there was something close to a vanilla latte because I had a hard time comprehending their menu, her response was surprising...I was expecting her to be agitated at my ignorance but instead she was excited to pop my Philz cherry and help me find something I would like. I still don't know if they have lattes here...I think they just have tons of different types of coffee and then add your prefereance of milk/sweetener.\n\nShe went over a few flavor profiles and eventually we went with something chocolate/hazelnut which isn't something I would normally go for, but she convinced me I would like it. The names of the drinks here were a little odd, so forgive me for not remembering what it was, but I ordered it with milk and STEVIA! Extra points for having Stevia...I back that. \n\nAnyway, so after you order you find your way to the register...kinda weird because it is not structured at all...they just kind of trust you'll go pay for your drink like a good citizen, but no one is really waiting for you at the register. Then you wait for your barista to call you for your drink...mine took about 10 minutes and when I went to grab it she made me try it first to make sure I liked it. I had her add another Stevia and then it was perfect.\n\nIf I lived in SF I think I would definitely be a regular at Philz once I could figure out what the hell the menu is all about. They put a lot of care and art into making your coffee perfect and I left feeling like I had a custom-made, hand-crafted cup of coffee, and that's pretty special.", "author": "Ashley K."}

The THOUSANDS+ reviews and counting confirm the hand-crafted love and impeccable flavor that's inside every cup.  Some of my favorites?  Tesora, Mocha Tesora, Jacob's Wonderbar, and Silken Splendor.  Fun fact: did you know that Tesora means Treasure in Italian?  I'm such a fan of this smooth, low-acid coffee that I only make Philz at home- but as anyone will tell you, it's just not the same.  \n\nOkay enough about the coffee- I'm here to share my experience and admiration for this business and how owner Phil Jaber has inspired me to be a better person.  Uh WHAT?  Yes, you read that right.  Phil is quite simply, a really, really cool human being.  Here's why.....\n\nOn a sweltering October day, with temperatures reaching nearly 100-degrees, my friend and I decided to get some Philz.  (Okay, I actually insisted on it and she was just trapped in my car along for the ride).  I pulled Yelp up to try to find the nearest Philz as I was driving through the Mission and knew that I had to be close to one.  I stopped at a stoplight and looked down at Yelp.  What's that you say?  I'm verrrrry close to one?  I looked up again and saw the original 24th/Folsom cafe to my immediate left, embraced by a pearlescent haze. (Cue: sound of the Heavens). This was meant to be!\n\nI drove past the stoplight and found a parking spot right around the corner.   Yes, in the Mission.  On a Saturday.  Parking karma!  Ka-Ching!  The stars were clearly lining up for Philz today!  As we stepped out of the car, I pointed out a used sharps bio-bag strewn on the sidewalk to my horrified friend.  Eh.....well we ARE in the Mission.  Nothing shocking there.\n\nI was excitedly bragging to my friend that I had met THE Phil the last time I was at this location.  He was standing underneath a poster bearing his image and I was so star-struck that I was suddenly too shy to ask for a photo and autograph.  (Let's just call this first-time groupie stage fright).\n\nWe walked inside the store and noticed a HUGE mess.  Chairs sitting on tables, people mopping wet floors, and NOBODY making coffee.  HUH?  What happened to the epic Philz day we were having?  Not wanting to give up, I poked my head in and asked, \"obviously you guys are closed - does anyone know where the nearest Philz is?\"\n\nA tall and slender hipster strode over, carrying a pink pastry box and wearing a friendly smile.  \"Sorry, we're remodeling right now but there's one on Douglass- you'll have to drive there or take a bus.  Want a pastry to take with you?\"  My eyes widened.  \"Yes thank you!\"  Soon, I was wearing the same smile as I turned to walk out.  And at that very moment, the heavens parted and my eyes met a very familiar face.  (Cue: the sound of Heavens again).  It was THE Phil.  In the flesh.  Leaning against a parking meter.  No big deal, just another hot Autumn day.\n\n\"Ohmigod!  That's Phil!\" I practically screamed.  I was chewing on my pastry at the same time.  Pastry crumbs dotted my lips.  \"Are you girls enjoying that?  Where are you from?\" the Legend spoke.  \"I'm from the Peninsula?\" I screeched.  \"Oh, we're opening one in San Mateo on B Street in a couple of weeks,\" he said.  All 3 of us continued to chat and his friend took a photo of us (see below).\n\nThe following day, I was procrastinating about work (it was Sunday 'mkay?) and looked up Phil and his story.  Reading this article nearly brought me to tears:  http://savorgood.com/2014/02/27/phil-jaber-philz-coffee/\n\nPhil tells his story of living a very simple immigrant's life in the Bay Area, helping his father run a grocery store in the Sunset.  This is where he spent building his business chops observing customers and their habits.  Market research without a Wharton MBA.  All the while, he would work on blending coffee at the store.  His big break wouldn't happen for another 25 years.\n\nReading this as a fellow immigrant who minded her parents' store starting at the age of 9 was inspirational, humbling, and most of all, deeply personal.  Phil's attitude about treating people with humanity and grace touched me in a very profound way.  Someday, when I grow up, I want to do something with my life that follows the Philz motto, \"We Exist to Better People's Day\".  That's what I call real success.", "author": "Cin P."}

He's created something truly unique. \n\nOften in my coffee conversations with people, I'm confronted with the comment \"Philz is better coffee than Blue Bottle,\" with a look of determination, ready to fight. My response is, \"That's like comparing Mitchell's Ice Cream to Tartine Bakery. They're both local and they're both good, but they're doing something completely different from each other. We can have room in our hearts for both.\"\n\nPositive:\n-No espresso! Philz successfully broke away from the Starbucks model of lattes and cappucinos! They don't get nearly enough credit for this amazing feat. \n-The whole business is based on fresh pour-over coffee: mostly mysterious alchemic blends from light to medium to dark, including multiple decaf options.\n-This concept of this place isn't to educate or to create connoisseurship. It's simply focused on making really delicious coffee. I think this is a huge part of the appeal to so many people who are put off by the snobbery of exclusivity of conventional modern third wave coffee roasters. No attention is paid to regions/altitudes/farms here. Sometimes people need a break from that. \n-So many different blends to try. People get into customizations and make personal connections to specific menu items. \n\nNegatives:\n-I've bought the beans and made the coffee at home. It doesn't taste the same. In fact it's sort of mediocre. \n-A big part of the appeal of Philz coffee is related to the use of manufacturing cream, which, though delicious, is insanely high in saturated fat. You're basically drinking a hot milkshake. That's one of the reasons it's not everyday coffee for me. However, this is probably part of why it doesn't seem like a rip-off at $4/cup. \n-some of the trademark blends which use the mysterious powder (cardamom?), have kind of a hotdoggy aftertaste. \n\nPhil is a businessman, so something gives me the feeling that this brand is trying to follow Ike's Sandwiches and head into something like a Krispy Kreme Donut or In-n-out Burger explosive expansion.

I have to say that I would put a few DC coffeeshops ahead of this one easily, because they're bigger, and they draw in more people who want to socialize. People here seem to want to just grab the coffee and go, but I feel like they miss out on the expeience of the coffeeshop.

Yes, I had been there before. He then got all snooty and explained that they only serve drip coffee. Wouldn't it have been easier to just say they don't have espresso?

What it taste like are those bottled frap drinks from Starbucks, but creamier, fresh-er, minty-er and way better. I would probably get shot mentioning both names in the same review. \n\nMy only thing with this drink is there a lot of solids in the cup that takes up space, so i wish there was more liquid.

Lining up was confusing (even with signage) because people just stood anywhere while waiting for their drink. So. Look at the sign, and walk behind it to get in line. A barista will wave you to their station, ask you what you want, and make it from scratch (including grinding the coffee beans). Sit on the benches behind you and wait. You'll then be asked to move back forward to taste it, make sure it's perfect, and if it is, move to the cash register to pay for your drink and any other treats you may desire. Sounds easy... Let's just say it was super confusing when I went. \n\nOther than that, the staff were amazingly helpful, kind, and loved making suggestions that might better my brew.

I greeted him with a friendly hello and he replied back with a disgruntled \"hi\". He told me my total, I gave him my card, he swiped it and have it back and that was it.

Every time someone mentions San Francisco or coffee, I fondly think back to the time when I visited the Philz near Berkeley... yum. The coffee here is AMAZING-- so amazing, in fact, that if I had to choose a last place coffee pit stop before leaving the country, I would choose Philz. Someone needs to seriously convince Mr. Phil to franchise down to sunny LA.\n\n-Iced mint mojito coffee-- yummm!!! Hint of mojito mint with delicious dark coffee. I don't know if this is very strong, but it was delicious. \n\n-Mocha tesora-- I would say about 3/4 of the cup was REALLY good, and then the last 1/4 of the cup got too sweet because of the mocha that had sedimented on the bottom. I think I'll get the regular Tesora next time. \n\n-frosted vegan orange donut-- are vegan donuts supposed to be heavier than regular donuts? That's what this donut tasted like; the cake was denser than that of regular donuts but the frosting/glaze made it 10x more delicious. A must try :)\n\nThe people at Philz were pretty much misters and hipsters. It's not a big coffee shop, but there are lots of spaces to sit and chat. The bathrooms are decked out in graffiti... so much graffiti, in fact, that you'll feel like you're peeing outside (jkjk).\n\nI'm sure anything that anyone tries from Philz would be amazing, especially their specials #1-10 :) If you come to SF, you have to try Philz!", "author": "Amy Q."}

Around downtown, by the ballpark, in the Mission...even one time in my dreams.  Everywhere!  Now that I've finally been able to strike them off my \"to try\" list though, maybe they'll stop stalking me...\n\nAfter starting off our morning with a trip to Dynamo (and finally scratching them off my \"to try\" list as well), we made our way down the street to get some Philz.  Since I wasn't familiar with which was \"the one\" to try (nor their giant menu), my friends suggested I order the Mocha Tesora.  Ahh...I'm so glad my friends have good taste.  The flavor was really rich, with a good mix between coffee and dark chocolate.  It wasn't quite as creamy as I would have liked, but it still had a nice body to it and just the slightest touch of some sweetness to go with the bitterness.\n\nFor whatever reason, I thought it was pretty cool how the baristas each had their own stocked stations to make batches of orders at a time.  Although, I guess in a way, it's kind of necessary to keep the lines moving.  The funny thing is, initially I couldn't really figure out why they had a bench there facing towards the baristas rather towards the people in line.  Little did I know, it was actually meant for people to sit and wait while the barista makes each drink before customers take it to the register.  Now that's smarts.

I proceeded to get a cup of aromatic Arabic with soy ($3.25) and a mini red velvet cupcake ($1). The red velvet wasn't as good as expected but my drink with a stem of mint was excellent and powerfully aromatic with a full bodied finish. I was awakened by my own amusement from the first sip, and now I'm accompanied by a nice cup of fresh chai ($3) as my fabulous morning was well spent between work, people watching, and chatting with Kent about our common interests in finding great cafes such as this one.\n\nThe vibe is friendly and filled with coffee enthusiasts looking for another round of caffeine. Service-wise, the staff is cheerful, knowledgeable, and deliberate with the way each cup is made. They also offer free wifi with plenty of plugs available on the floor and around their eclectic sets of tables and sofas.

So much so that I would eagerly anticipate my daily study sessions there because it meant I got to null the pain of reading about the political and economic ramifications. Sadly, during my senior year, they started serving a different kind of chai and I was forced to seek out a different studying beverage.  While my thighs were grateful for the relief, my taste buds were not.  \n\nSince then, have been on a mission to find a a' chai replacement.  Starbucks and Peet's are too bland, Urth Caffe's is too spicy and healthy, and while I do quite enjoy the version at Coffee Bean, it's not quite right.  The whole experience of trying and disliking the various chai lattes across many cities has made me feel like I'm an insomniac Goldilocks -- exhausted, but never able to find that just right bed to lay my blonde head.\n\nThis past Sunday, I met up with an.... errr... acquaintance, at Philz Coffee in SF.

Just like me, it was made with sugar and spice and everything nice -- in proportions that were... drumroll please... just right!

I honestly love this location. The baristas are always nice and always ask how my drinks taste! They're friendly and don't mind small talk while multitasking making other customers drinks. Lounge area is nice when you can find a seat cause it's always so busy. If you're looking for a quiet place to study, this may or may not work for you. Also, outlets are pretty sparse. \n\nNow since I'm reviewing the Original Philz location, I'll break down the coffee, as I hadn't on a previous Philz review. My hubs and his classmate were taking about coffee and his classmate works at Peets and describes Philz as the \"Louis Vuitton\" of coffee because they care way too much about their coffee. That sounds good to me! My favorite cold drink is, of course, the iced mint mojito. You're shocked, right? Tell me you're shocked. I get mine with vanilla soy and a little sweet. Hubs gets his extra sweet with vanilla soy. Occasionally, I'll ask for half cream and half vanilla soy - they're pretty accommodating with that. My favorite hot is the Silken Splendor. Nothing but a little sugar and you're good to go (at least for me. I'm not too big on cream/milk in my regular coffee). But if you're really adventurous, try the Jamaican Blue Mountain. That baby will cost you $10 for a large. Why? Because it's special. No. It really is. These beans are picked only one time a year, so hence the huge price. Guess what? A pound is $120. Did you just have a heart attack? I know, right, but one taste and you'll understand. No cream. No sugar. Just plain. Oh. Epic. Oh. Heaven. Tesora is yum. Mocha tesora is yum too. Itz the best isn't in my book, but it's yum. Ambrosia. Ooh. The ambrosia. So good. There is also a sooooo good. And that's good too.

Looking at the menu, we were a bit lost...then we sat down on the wooden bench (pew from a church?) and the answers were right there in front of us - description of the coffee offered, about 20 of them listed by light, medium, dark and decaf.  \n\nI wanted to know what is that wonderful scent - hubby said cardemon, I didn't want to believe it...so I asked and the girl behind the counter said she really can't smell/tell anymore but guessing it is the cardemon.  Ok, which one of the coffee has it?   Tantalizing Turkish under dark roast - sounds good to me, a small please ($3.25)!  She asked if we wanted any cream and sugar and I decided a little of both although we normally have black coffee.\n\nThe fabulous system here is they grind the beans when you order so it takes some time but well worth the wait.  While waiting, you can study on the other available option and decide on what you may want to try next - we already have about 3 in mind.  The decor is very \"Mission\" and the ambiance is very friendly, local and relaxed.  \n\nWhen the drink was ready, she asked if I would like some fresh mint in it - I took a quick sip and said yes.  She picked a couple fresh mint leaves and put it in the coffee - asked if the coffee was ok, enough sugar and cream.  All good - put the cap on and head to pay.  \n\nWe were both surprised at how tasty the coffee is, even with the cream and sugar.  As a matter of fact, the cream and sugar enhanced the coffee, sort of brought out the wonderful aroma even more...the mint added a nice taste.  Here's the crazy part - the coffee tasted better and better as the mint flavor deepened and somehow the coffee flavor seem to be bursting.  Wild but true...", "author": "Gloria H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-24", "description": "I hardly drink coffee. The reasons: (1) I don't care too much for the taste; (2) I hate how it makes me want to run to the bathroom in the morning; (3) I have a horrible experience of drinking 2 cups of coffee the night before a huge math exam and experiencing major stomach pains the following day. (Never again, free refill or not!) So when I am in need of a caffeine perk, I usually opt for tea, but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate a nice cup of Joe every now and then.\n\nPhilz would be one of those places that I would not mind stopping by for coffee every now and then. I've actually been here twice just to try their coffee, and for me, that is saying a lot. The only other reason I would be in a coffee shop is to get my study on. So why would a tea-loving, coffee-no-nothing like me trek all the way to the Mission for a cup of coffee?? Because it tastes GOOD!\n\nOn my first visit, I tried the the Mint Mojito Iced Coffee. I wasn't sure what to expect, but boy, was it good! It still tastes like coffee, but without the strong bitterness. It was also just the right amount of sweetness. I was immediately hooked!\n\nThe second time I decided to try the Ginger Snap Iced Coffee. I was worried that it would turn out too sweet because someone had mentioned that it tastes like a liquid cookie, which some sweet-toothed people would enjoy, but it's not my preference.  When I went to the counter to take a sip, it actually turned out to be a lot less sweet than I had imagined. It actually could have been a little sweeter for it to be just right. I decided to accept the drink as is, although the barista told me to take a sip and to let him know if there needed to be any adjustments. Perhaps the barista heard my concerns when I spoke aloud to my friend, so I didn't bother. The drink was still tasty, but I would definitely prefer the Mint Mojito between the two. If you like sweet chai, you will probably like this drink. \n\nI also took a sip of my friend's medium roast Tesora, which had a very nice rich flavor. Makes me want to try their hot coffees next.  \n\nCoffee snob or not, you will not be disappointed. In addition to tasty coffee, is their friendly staff and chill atmosphere. There are several round communal tables and couches on the side. Noise level is not too high. I could hear my friend clearly. However, we were probably the only two people speaking, beside the baristas taking orders, which made me feel like we were talking too loud. Other than that, the only major downside is the $4 price tag for a small iced coffee that prevents me from coming more often.", "author": "Lily W."}

But it's quite fitting that my FIRST visit was to be the ORIGINAL location. \n\nOrdered: Small Mint Mojito Iced Coffee. I heard about the rave reviews and just had to try it. Taking some other reviewer's advice, I opted for half-sweetened and cream w/ my drink. It was perfect! I wasn't sickenly overloaded with a sugary aftertaste and the coffee was brewed so well that there was no bitterness or sourness either. The mint added a refreshing touch, although a bit awkward when it got stuck in my teeth. But that may just be me being klutzy with food -__-\n\nService: I actually had my friend order for me, but she said the barista was nice in explaining to her that the mint will make coffee more bitter because the barista was worried that my drink wouldn't be sweet enough. Good thing I like my coffee to be strong so that wasn't a problem. \n\nAtmosphere: 11:30 am and this place was PACKED. I wouldn't come here to meet a large group of friends or try to study due to the noise level.\n\nPackaging: Hot and warm drinks come in a paper cup that has a ridge lining (i.e. built-in sleeve). I like how this saves paper! And by not using plastic cups, the ice in my cold drinks don't melt as fast, watering it down.\n\nPrice: $4 for a small cup. Sadly this will be the factor as to why I won't be making regular visits (aside from the fact that I don't live in Berkeley or will go out to SF that often anymore).

I decided to hang out in the shop and enjoy my cup of coffee. I placed my coffee on the opposite end of the table from where my son was sitting/standing/yelling/playing/whatever other action a 2-yr old can do on a chair (you'd be surprised). Anyway, as soon as I thought my kid couldn't get himself into any trouble, he removed his hat and flung it at my full cup of coffee. Thankfully no one was burned, but he made a huge mess. I could not run for a towel or napkins because I didn't want to leave my son by himself at the table, so before I was able to grab him I noticed someone was already cleaning up the mess my son made... \n\nIt was Phil. \n\nHe just smiled and said \"It's good luck.\" After we cleaned the mess, he asked me what I was drinking and he went back and made me another cup himself.

When I would tell the barista what they would typically order at Starbucks, they would recommend a drink for me to order for them. Or if I needed something with lots of caffeine to keep me going through the day, they would suggest something to try.\n\nIf you want soy, they have original and vanilla. For sweetness you tell them whether you want little, medium or very sweet. After they finish making your drink, they want to make sure it's how you like it so they want you to taste it before you leave. Talk about service, right?!\n\nMy go-to and favorite drink is the Mocha Tesora (dark roast). It's a dark chocolate-inspired blend with a mix of cocoa that you only get in-store. I usually get medium roasts, but this is FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC!\n\nI've tried their ice mint mojito and wasn't a fan. The fresh crushed mint in it was too overwhelming for me.\n\nOther blends I've tried that were great: \nSooo Good (light roast): delivers smoky tones paired with vivacious sweet highlights\nCanopy of Heaven (light roast): a signature blend bursting with lively complex flavors and sweet beans from across the globe to produce a delicious caffeinated cup\nPhiltered Soul (medium roast): burst of chocolate and traces of hazelnut. Great for those with a sweet tooth\nAmbrosia Coffee of God (medium roast): has sweet nutty tones w/a subtle finish\nPhilharmonic (medium roast): warm tones with layers of cardamom that you only get in stores\nHazelnut: a sweet blend with hazelnut tones that are rich and creamy w/a bright finish\nJamaican Blue Mountain: a rare full-bodied blend. I've actually tried this blend from other roasters and the one here isn't as good, unfortunately\n\nIf I need a strong cup of joe, I go for either Code 33 (A strong, rich, oily dark roast blend with a full bodied taste. A special blend made for the San Francisco Police Department to keep them alert) or the Greater Alarm (a light roast designed to keep coffee drinkers and firefighters awake and ablaze, it consists of vivid and uplifting tones, paralleled with blazing strength and sweetness).\n\nFor those who don't drink coffee (like a few of my former co-workers), they make excellent loose teas as well. I had ordered the green tea w/honey for someone and they absolutely loved it.\n\nThe baked goods are really good as well. I suggest the scones and the croissants!\n\nP.S.

But there was something just so charmingly peaceful about sitting on the bench outside on a warm afternoon, catching a glimpse into the lives of the Hispanic locals and gentrified SF youth alike.

I had never been to any Philz Coffee, but my friend suggested it since he had been here before with his coffee connoisseur friends.\n\nWalking in, this place was quintessential Berkeley -- there was an eclectic mix of furniture and decorations that made it fun and quirky. We sat down at the bench facing the menu that's posted along the counter. I'm not a big coffee drinker (in fact I just recently weaned myself off of my morning cup of joe), so I decided to choose a mild decaf coffee. For those who want real coffee, there's tons of options, but for decaf coffee, there were three. This was lucky for me because I'm always so indecisive. I narrowed it down by reading the descriptions and chose the Decaf Sumatra.\n\nWhen we went, there were several people filling up the majority of the seats, but there was no line to order. We ordered at the counter being manned by two warm and friendly employees. When I placed my order, she asked if I wanted cream and sugar and I asked for only a little bit. I didn't really watch it being made since I was busy catching up with my friend, but once I took a sip, I knew they did a job well done! It was amazing! Probably one of the best coffees I've had. Usually, I like to control how much cream and sugar (or more so what KIND of cream and sugar) I add to my coffee, but I guess when you leave it to the experts, you know you'll be guaranteed a tasty cup. I paid $3 for my small, which is comparable to other coffee shops. \n\nThe other nice thing is they will make it to your liking -- my friend wanted a little more sugar, so they added it to his cup without any problems at all.\n\nWe tried to find a place to sit inside rather than standing out in the cold, but people were spread out all over the place, so we couldn't find a couple seats together.\n\nOverall, this place has amazing coffee and a friendly staff. I can see the attraction of this place. It seems like it would be a nice place to sit down and relax or do some work if there were actually open seats.

Checkout guy and baristas were both friendly and competent to help out this clueless first time customer. They have you line up behind a line that's well away from the front door, so if you are initially gobsmacked by the menu, you have to be gently verbally guided to line up in the appropriate place, which they do in a way that doesn't make you feel at all dim. Or not too much anyway.\n\nAnyhow, that sorted, the barista taking my order was very kind and recommended some coffees based on my partially articulated desires and based on what I'd ordered at the Berkeley Philz. Given I'd ordered a mocha there, she suggested a Jacob's Wonderbar here. She also suggested medium cream, medium sugar but seemed gratified that I chose just medium cream, no sugar.\n\nAnd it was a good choice and energizing but not too jittery. The chocolate notes on that coffee were just right and it didn't really need sugar.\n\nVery good service, very good coffee.\n\nThe only weird part was that about 80% - 90% of the seats inside the shop were filled and of them it seemed like all or almost all of the customers had at least one Apple product, mostly laptops and iPads as well as iPhones. Given that I'd only brought my iPhone I felt conspicuously out of place. I know this is just the demographics of the clientele but it was really kind of eerie.", "author": "Malcolm G."}

The employees are always friendly and cheery.  They make the coffee exactly how you want it (and make you taste it to make sure it's just right before walking away).\nMy favorite hot coffee is the Julie's; my favorite iced is the Mint Mojito.  I have frequented most of the Philz in The Bay Area; this location is my favorite.  They play great music, have an upbeat atmosphere, and provide plenty of comfortable seating.  I love coming here to sit and read a book on a day off from work for a few hours.\nThe location in Daly City is literally 2 blocks from my apartment, but if I want to sit and read I'll come to this location instead.\nHighly recommend.

I love that the baristas ask you to taste your coffee before you pay to make sure it is just to your liking.\n\nUnfortunately, while the service at Philz was on the quick despite the fact they brew each cup individually, finding parking was a nightmare.

The giant vinyl sign touting their local awards honestly put me off. Felt cheesy and I didn't trust it, somehow, on my first walk past. Too many ginormous signs often means a desparate restaurant, in my experience. But on my second walk past I noticed how PACKED it was, both inside and out, at 11am on a Monday. And so I wandered inside. \n\nFrom Seattle, I've a high level of exposure to a variety of coffee houses. The vibe here is among the best. Quirky and comfortable. Giant chalkboards listing many many types of coffees. But just the Philz blend names, no real descriptions. I was planning to just wander up and randomly choose one, trying to look all cool and confident, ya know? (No out-of-town vibe/tourist designation desired). I'd only been looking at the board for about 10 seconds when one of the coffee employees called me over. (Not sure if barista would apply, as it's non-espresso). His name was Tony and he's fantastic! Super friendly and funny, he put me right at ease, immediately questioning me about what types of coffee I enjoy (and listing several possible types, in case I wouldn't know what to say). I confessed my love for DARK roasts. He told me ETHER was the way to go then. He also gave me a Fist-Bump when I declined cream and sugar. *laughs* I love the idea of Philz, brewing each cup for the customer, and then they do that fantastic long pouring back and forth (that I've really only seen done on the streets of Malaysia) which creates a fantastic bit of froth. It was a lovely cup of coffee.  While waiting for my cup to brew, I got to overhear the interactions with other customers. This let me know that there's a large variety of sweeteners (honey, agave, sugar, etc) and different milks and creams available, too. \n\nThey do have a very INTERESTING bathroom. Some might say it's a public restroom at it's fullest potential, as every square inch is covered in graffiti.

I love this coffee and I go to this Philz frequently. THEY PICK AND CHOOSE WHO TO ASK FOR ID. I like to be relaxed on Sunday's so I send my BF to get my coffee with my card. Starbucks has a policy anything over 10$ they ask for ID so you'd figure that to be the same case. For some reason when my BF was there to buy me a small Tesora they asked for his ID. This is a 3-4 dollar purchase, the lady wouldn't hear anything he had to say and I know this because he called me while he was there (probably because he was in his urban weekend gear instead of his weekly professional look). I GO THERE ALL THE TIME WITH HIS CARD AND HE DOES WITH MY CARD FOR A SMALL PURCHASE AND NO ONE EVER ASKS FOR AN ID (Usually dressed in professional attire because we both work in corporate America). They need to solidify their process for checking ID because the waters can get muddied fast with this subject. I won't say it's racial profiling because I don't know that for sure, but for some reason the day my BF doesn't look like a young professional going into this place he gets carded. What does that lead you to think? Please Philz employees don't judge a book by it's cover. Thank goodness the manager Rebecca heard what I had to say and states she would address the issue to make sure there is a uniform way this ID situation will be handled in the future. I really hope this changes because it'd be sad to have to stop drinking this yummy coffee due to them racial profiling people. I won't support that...", "author": "Stephanie C."}

I was too flustered to attempt a more elaborate order, in fear I'd fuck up again. It was pretty damn good, but I know their other offerings will bump that shits up to a 4 or 5 star experience in no time.\n\nI have my eye on that mojito coffee drink. Yum!

I'd like to think that it was part of my Coffee Education.\n\nYou see, last summer I moonlighted as a barista at one of those super high-end, quasi-hipster coffee shops in Oakland where we brewed individual cups of Blue Bottle coffee as well as our own house-made micro roast. This experience is a great conversation starter and it also really impresses my hipster friends. So I figure if I'm going to use it as a tool to impress bearded, bespectacled men on bicycles, I'd better know what I'm talking about, right?\n\nIt was my last day of work today and I'm nearing the end of my summer in the Bay Area, so today was the perfect opportunity to try Philz. I brought in my own mug (to maximize cost-efficiency) and told the barista I'd never been before, but that I generally liked dark roasted coffee. She recommended the Jacobs. I ordered it medium-sweet, with cream, at the recommendation of all you Yelpers.\n\nI have to say that the first sip blew me away! Perfect sweetness and creaminess where the coffee goes down smoothly without tasting overly sweet like coffee ice cream. The froth on top is also perfect. Not sure how they get that froth with drip coffee- they probably pour it from one cup to another. \n\nHowever, the remaining sips, while still great, weren't quite as amazing. It did have some acidity that wasn't tamed by the cream, and it wasn't worth the 10 minute wait and $3.25. I'd still rank it far above Blue Bottle and Ritual, but I think Philz will remain a once-in-a-while treat while I happen to be in the Mission area rather something I'll venture out for. What can I say, maybe I'm just a sucker for (relative) mediocrity - I do love my Peet's for being faster, cheaper and fairly delicious (Did I just lose all my Yelp credibility for saying that?!)\n\nI must add, however, that as I walked out of Philz with my commuter mug in hand, casually sipping as I walked, I did receive compliments from complete (creepy) strangers such as \"Your hair is beautiful! Never cut it!\" and \"You glow like an angel!\" \n\nHmm, perhaps there really IS some magic in a cup of Philz that you can't get anywhere else.", "author": "Katherine H."}

I could have bought a whole box of tea at Safeway for the same price. So dumb.\n\nPhilz's mint tea actually makes me excited to drink tea. I finally got a taste of the superiority complex that most coffee drinkers have. Sometimes I even get to say things like, \"my tea is much sweeter than usual today\" and act like the barista has committed a serious offense for being unable to consistently replicate the preferred ratio of honey to tea. \n\nIn the same vein, I have to say that the asian guy who makes the Philz bagels is awesome! Sometimes I get wary when someone else is behind the counter.

This was the second time this has happened.\n\nI also thought the new cups were smaller as well, but they're 16 ounces right on the money. I could've sworn the old ones were bigger, but I'll keep my yelphole shut on this point.

The girl making my coffee quite literally ignored me when I thanked her, then barked \"yeah\" when I thanked her again. It was weird. The cashier made a joke to her cohort about calling animal control on my dog who was tied up outside and I was standing right there. Maybe I just caught the staff on a bad day, but they left the impression that they think they're so smart and cool that their customers don't notice when they're being snide and dismissive. Sad face.

Two things I loved about the funky decor of this place: a couple of posters of other businesses in Mission, where collaboration between said businesses and this coffee house was proudly displayed. \"Buy a computer at the computer shop down the street, we buy you a cup of coffee\"; the second one was an advertisement for a \"highly-caffeinated\" carpenter--or plumber--hang on the wall as well.  The \"good neighbor\" attitude is what makes Mission such a wonderful place. Mr. Phil seems to be on it.\n\nBoth Mr. B and I truly enjoyed our hand-dripped cups of coffee very much.  I did as much or even a little bit more than the coffee from Seattle. \n\nAt this point, and after all the praises, you should be wondering why the three stars.  The service was atrocious.  The woman working there on Friday February 4th at 6:30pm might have an angel hand for coffee but has NO clue on how to treat customers.  \n\nWhen I first came and said \"Hi!\" she startled. I profusely apologized even though I suspect what I wasn't what had her jump.  Then I ordered an Americano and a latte.  She said, curtly, they don't do \"watered-down\" coffee and that \"you can go across the street for those drinks, because our coffee shop works in a different way\".  I can understand that, but don't you send me somewhere else! \n\n(Of course I shut my mouth and didn't say that).  \n\nI asked her if I could do something similar and she said she'd give me a regular and a decaf.  Then she pointed out I needed to tell her if I wanted cream and sugar.  I was a little bit confused and ordered milk for my drink.\n\nThen another customer came in and ordered a bag of ungrounded beans. She was a very nice and polite girl and I heard her order THAT.  Almost immediately, the barista threw the beans in the grinder, and the customer said \"no, no, ungrounded\" in a NICE way. The barista got defensive and said \"I heard ground\" and kept insisting on that. \n\nWell, you heard wrong.  The other customer and I exchanged puzzled looks.\n\nAfter that, I get called for my drinks and ask where was the sugar.  She barely contained her annoyance. She said \"I told you we do the sugar BEHIND the counter\" in such a patronizing way, at this point I just wanted to leave. I asked for one small spoon of sugar and she dumped an equivalente to a quarter cup in my coffee. Yes, she made my coffee too sweet.  Jeez. \n\nStill, we loved the coffee. But in a city where we have had pretty great service, this is no bueno.  I would love to go back, but I really don't want to feel like Jerry Seinfeld and the soup Nazi when nicely asking for what is to me one of the most delightful pleasures in life.  \n\nWhich they do pretty well.", "author": "Valentina V."}

I got the Tesora.  It was a delicious medium-bodied coffee, and one of their most popular according to my friend.\n\nThat said, I feel like I really need to go back and take some time to contemplate my next \"cup of love\" from Philz Coffee.

We didn't know who was going to take our order so we went to the girl at the register who told us to order first with the guy...who was still chatting with the other patron.  Umm...okay?  Finally they wrapped up and we placed our orders and went back to cashier girl to pay.  Kind of roundabout if you ask me but whatevs.  \n\nAt this point, I thought to myself \"This better be good coffee\".  After waiting a while, we finally got our iced mojito and mocha tesora.\n\n\"OOH!\" was my first impression, which then ultimately turned into thinking that the mojito was \"just okaaayyyy\" after a few more sips...even though the taste was at first refreshing, after a while, accidentally slurping up big chunks of whole mint leaves was kind of annoying.  Perhaps I wasn't too enamored with it because it was a bit cold outside that day and I probably would've been better off with a warm drink.\n\nOn the other hand, the mocha tesora hit the spot perfectly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-26", "description": "This place serves up incredible coffee. That being said, it's coffee for a certain type of person. If you are uptight and specific about your cream and sugar needs, it might be better to go somewhere else that gives you room to do it yourself. The baristas are going to put your cream and sugar in there for you, so you'll have to specify how you like it. If it's your first time and you don't have any dietary issues, just suck it up and order your coffee the Philz way--with full-on heavy cream and sugar. The coffee is very, very strong and your drink will taste better with the added milky sweetness. \n\nBy itself, the coffee can be a shock to the system. If you're not sure what kind of roast you like, stick with a medium (Tesora, Dancing Water) or just ask your barista for a recommendation. They are the most well-rounded blends on the menu. Lighter ones (Canopy of Heaven, Greater Alarm) have wayyyyy more caffeine, while the darker roasts (Turkish, Ether) are intense, bold and more bitter in flavor.\n\nTip #1: Don't get angry with your baristas if they start blabbing on about how the coffee is handcrafted in a way that will \"blow your mind.\" You came to this hipster joint in the first place, and you asked for it. If you're nice to them, they will do whatever it takes to give you the best drink ever. \n\nMy choice drinks: Mocha Tesora, Dancing Water, Philharmonic, Mint Mojito, Philz Hot Chocolate (tell them to add cinnamon!)\n\nI don't recommend the Philz Chai. It's a lot more bitter than the usual flavor of chai tea and the spices don't mix in very well, so you get a nasty residue on the bottom, which is gross. Unless you're into that sort of thing.\n\nTip #2: If you bring your own mug, no matter the size, you will be charged for a small beverage.

I would jump in front of a MUNI bus for this coffee. The menu of the different types of beans available is huge. It would take at least a month of hardcore coffee drinking to get through the whole menu.\nI really don't know how to explain it, but the coffee is well made kinda like your Grandma baking you a cake with love. There are no frapps or double whipped just straight coffee with cream or sugar of course making it the drink that has lasted for thousands of years.\n\nI believe this is the first store in San Francisco due to the eclectic decorations, and location in the Mission area. The store although is slightly hidden so, you have to be a local to find it! The store is also by far the largest i have seen, but sadly did take a while to get my coffee which isn't a deal breaker in my book. The staff is always friendly at Philz, and willing to wait as you stare at the massive board. While you wait there is a TV on loop of new articles, and twitter feeds which is cool. If your a coffee drinker you need to stop at this store at least once.\n\nIf your looking for a cool local coffee shop that's not a clich\u00e9 this is the place to be.", "author": "Nathan M."}

I buy good grinds; nothing special; like Peet's or something.\nThis probably costs me like 50 cents. And I don't have to wait in a line that wraps around the block.\nI don't know, I feel like the boy in the Emperor's New Clothes or something. Everyone raves about Philz, and I just don't see the charm of their *good* cup of coffee that costs almost 4 dollars. Am I missing something? I'm definitely willing to pay money for food, but I guess I feel that as a matter of principle a good cup of coffee in society should be around $2. Let's keep that reasonable folks. \n\nFurthermore the fact that I can't put my own cream and sugar in it is not helpful and kind of annoying:  \"Um, I would like 2 teaspoons of sugar but not too full, kind of medium sized teaspoons. But, um, then again, can I see the size of the cup?...Oh, maybe 1 and a half teaspoons....um..

I've been to Philz many times, but it wasn't until my last visit that I decided I wouldn't go back. \n\nThe coffee is okay (really strong), and is priced in the moderate-to-cheap range, and I'm giving them one (1) star for the day-old pastries that sell for $1 (instead of buying a new one for $3.50). \n\nHowever, I have to say that some of the rudest people -- customers and workers-- are at Philz. \n\nYou know what, it IS confusing to go in there. Another reviewer commented on the lack of line and the propensity for people to cut in front of you while you're standing around trying to figure out where to go.  And the decorations are tired, beat-up and just sad. \n\nThe short-haired girl who works the bagel and pastry section is very abrupt and has had an attitude every time I've been there.  I have to bow and smile and say please and thank you to her just so she's not a complete bitch--- as if I should be thanking her for popping a bagel into a toaster and spreading a little cream cheese on it. Jeez. Like it's some huge chore. \n\nThe girl working the register had the audacity, when I was going to pay, to ask me \"do you KNOW about our espresso?\" when I ordered one.  She also rather snottily asked if I had ever been to Philz, and if I knew about the \"process\". (Blerg)\n\nAnd the workers facilitate a bad-tempered clientele. People hog couches and don't let you sit on them (even when it's only one person sitting down); the other customers are really grabby when it comes to claiming space on tables. \n\nTheir \"family style\" sitting area would be nice if the other customers weren't so territorial about marking their space. Sometimes I feel like the pushy ones are about ready to pee on a chair just to make sure it's \"theirs\". \n\nPhilz should make a policy that says \"There are no reserved seats unless someone is physically sitting in them.\"  Just putting down your bag and disappearing for fifteen minutes shouldn't be okay.\n\nBut they probably won't change, considering the main clientele is hipstery Mission folk who view Philz as \"their\" local hangout. It's no wonder they were so rude to my mom, she's not in their \"age range\". \n\nI'm actually surprised that nobody has filed a complaint against them for agism or racism in hiring, considering that 90% of the employees are white young females, and the other 10% are white young men.\n\nBottom line: there are better, nicer places to spend your money. Go somewhere less crowded, less cramped, and with less attitude.", "author": "Lala B."}

There were so many different types of people: hipsters in their skinny jeans, a group of firemen on their morning break and the quintessential techie running his office from a coffee shop.\n\nI walked up to the bar and asked for a caramel mocha. The girl behind the counter laughed, in an endearing way, and asked if it was my first time. I admitted that it was and she went on to explain to me the way they do Turkish coffee drip, blah blah blah. I ended up getting a large mocha, which was $3.50 (much cheaper than Peets or Starbucks) and the girl, Ryan, had me taste it to make sure I liked it before she gave it to me.\n\nSo definitely a gold star for lovely staff, who refer to you as love, honey and darling, and gold star for super chill atmosphere and another gold star for the delicious coffee that was served at the perfect temperature - warm and drinkable right away.\n\nThey also have free Wi-fi that you don't need a password for.", "author": "Casey S."}

Damned good thing I decided to look at the internet one morning to determine who would open early so I could go get something the round out my long night.\n\nFacing a blackboard full of unfamiliar coffee names was intimidating at first but a very nice barista offered to help me decide what to drink. I told her I like coffee you must eat with a fork, and she rewarded me with a cup of \"Ether\" with cream, served hot enough to be warming but not so mouth-scaldingly hot that I had to wait an hour for it to cool off before I could drink it without crying in pain. But better than that, it was almost indescribably rich and smooth and it gave me enough energy to stay up another six hours. This was the best cup of coffee I had ever had. Ever. \n\nI've been back a sufficient number of times since that I've completely lost count. It is a six-big-Mission-block walk to Philz from my house, but given what awaits at the end of the trek my feet fly me there in anticipation and then float away effortlessly after the recharge, all of me blissfully happy.\n\nI don't know how I lived without Philz all those years before I knew they existed. And I don't know why everyone in the Mission doesn't immediately say \"Philz!\" when asked where to get a good cup of coffee. Ritual isn't even close with their machine-made boiling cups of bitterness. Save your delicate oral tissues and go to Philz, where the baristas stand behind hand-made wooden filter holders and pour pleasingly hot water by hand into whichever custom blend they have expertly recommended for you.

Not only is the menu of coffee being brewed as diverse as a restaurant's, but the baristas have some kind of ancient art kung-fu-cream-and-sugar training where my \"regular\" amount was literally perfect.  And I don't even normally put ANY sugar in my coffee!  You can go light, you can go heavy, however you want your cream and sugar they have some kind of E.S.P. to get it perfect. \n\nThe coffees themselves are varied to taste, with plenty of light, dark and medium options, as well as some special blends and a couple of decafs.   I had the ambrosia.. yum!\n\nThe line situation was a bit odd for a few people to handle (myself included). It doesn't start with the register, you have to walk around the benchesin the middle of the room to the far end of the counter.  There, baristas will holler out for when they have an opening at their one-cup-a-time dripping station.   No mechanical brewing here! My barista even had a wrist brace from her intensive water pouring.  After you order (your coffee, then how you would like it sweetened/creamed) you can side-step down to check out the vegan pastries and other offerings (and they all looked good) - or you could go next door afterwards and have a toothsome (love that word! I imagine my tooth filling up with something, not just my mouth) baked good like a meat-filled pie or creme-brulee tart (another review...)\n\nOnly downside to this amazing establishment?

The vibe I get from Philz just from walking outside reminds me of the sort of coffee shop in Friends. It looks very 90's and hippie ish. Perhaps that was the turn off for me that the interior was so unappealing. So what?! Why did I not come in here sooner and believe the hype!!! The interior might not be the best but their coffee certainly is.\n\nPhilz is the best way to wake up in the morning. My favorite for when you  didn't get a good nites sleep or need a pick me up is  the greater alarm. (fFrst one I tried not realizing til later that it's named after firefighters to keep them awake. it did just that to me and cracked me out for a good 6 hours straight and was awesome) For just a great cup of coffee ambrosia of god. For more savory: Jacob's Wonderbar or Tesora. I love that they put cream and sugar in the coffee for you. I hate the clusterfuck of a line that isn't caused by the Philz staff but is from the customers who are clueless. For a good wakeup and pick me up Philz is the spot. I love that they're individually dripped and prepared for you and love that most of the beans are cheaper than BBC. I also like that they accept cards and aren't cash only.", "author": "Kristy H."}

I had the Iced Mint Mojito Coffee and my whole body felt invigorated. Life doesn't get any better riding around in my bicycle on a radiant day, stopping into Philz, then acting as  a walking billboard as I stroll down 24th street to buy some produce. That's the life of a SF native. At $4.50 though, it's a once in awhile treat for me. I still turn to blue bottle more frequently to be cost effective. \n\nYou can always tell who has never been to this location, they are usually the people looking like deer in headlights not knowing where to go. Cashier first? They just stand there and delay everything. Do us all a favor, order your drink from one of the 3 baristas then go pay for your drink.

Whenever I go to Starbucks, it's a soy hot chocolate or Chai tea latte for me. I had had a sip of Clara's iced coffee before, and remembered how incredibly awesome it was, so I was happy to come here with a couple of friends after church one Sunday to grab a cup of Joe.\n\nSince I don't drink coffee, I don't bother myself with the latest news of coffee shops or remember who does what with which philosophy or whatever. But I immediately noticed that they brewed each cup individually, which, I think, is the key to their success. I don't know much about coffee, but that was a HECKA good cup of coffee. It was just so fresh, and you could taste the flavor of each bean in every sip you take. I've never been able to actually TASTE what coffee is supposed to taste like until that day. Even with ice and tons of cream, it was absolutely perfect: mellow, slightly bitter, rich and earthy. \n\nI tried my friends' coffee, too. One was called Soooo Good, and it was indeed SOOOO GOOD. I forgot what the other one was, but it was absolutely excellent.\n\nThis coffee has made me into a coffee lover. Now I can absolutely understand why people drink this stuff everyday (beside the fact that it helps them wake up in the morning). I now understand why people wait 30 minutes in the drive thru of a Starbucks every morning. If there was a Philz coffee next to my work, I'd be drinking that stuff twice a day!

It seems that you are learning a new language when trying to ask for a simple cup of drip coffee. Well, there's your first mistake, this is no simple cup o' Joe. \n\nEach cup is lovingly ground only once it's ordered. The baristas knock out up to seven cups of fresh hand-crafted cups at a time.

We weren't sure what to order, so we quickly started reading the descriptions of everything on the front of the counter.  I had heard the mocha, the Turkish Coffee and the Mojito Ice Coffee.  Since it was a bit chilly, I decided to get the Mocha and Dave got the Turkish.  If you want anything in your coffee like cream or sweetener, they do all of that for you.  Each cup is individually brewed and made to your liking.  I didn't ask for any sweetener because I didn't want my mocha to be too sweet.  It came out perfectly.  Dave's Turkish was to die for.  I almost wish I ordered that.  They also have some baked goods there as well.

Philz deserves this for respecting the bean. You gotta love a place that has enough 60kilo burlap bags from coffee purchases past to basically decorate the walls of the unisexed/metrosexed/transsexed bathroom (save for the hilarious graffiti allowed to become slightly off-colored public art for your reading pleasure).\n\nI sampled the Jamaican Blue Bottle (oops .. Freudian slip. I mean Blue MOUNTAIN, of course), perhaps the best $7 I have ever spent on a drip coffee. The Tesora that my wife had was house-blended $2.75 perfection - the greatest caffeinated deal in the city, probably. And the Silken Splendor - other than being a tempting name for a John Waters flick (go Baltimore!) - was fine. Real fine. And a little sensual, as far as beans go.\n\nThere is a nice grungy vibe here, cool social spaces to sit and sip, and the place seems to ooze with local history during times when people could still light up inside as well as out (and before the Purple Haze Smoke Shop came to town, probably). It's actually amazing to me that Philz has only been around since 2003! I would have thought it to be older than Central Perk and Cafe Nervosa, at least.*\n\nSo, let's just say that I'd probably like to sit and get buzzed on the brown stuff with Phil J. one of these days. I'd like to ask him to expand upon the web site justification concerning why he avoids mentioning the origins of his beans and foregrounds instead the masterful art of blending. Yes, blends are amazing and likely take decades of hard work to master. But even a fine blended wine in Bordeaux, which might come from 4 or 5 wine varietals, is STILL labeled according to its terroir. Personally, I like to travel vicariously through the magic of the bean to different parts of the world. Hence the reason why I ordered the Jamaican Blue Mountain (you made an exception to the rule here, Phil! You can't hide it under the specials section of the menu from me!! And Kona wouldn't be Kona w/out Hawai'i). It might be nice to mention the places of origin of at least some of the blends. But I will not second-guess the master. \n\n(*) Note: do not try Yelping these places.

In the rain, we drove around and around and around and arrived soaked and cold. Prepare yourself.\n\nWe walked in and there were signs with very specific instructions at where to line up. The problem with this was that we were unable to plow through the menu without #1 a dictionary , #2 a thesaurus #3 house cheat sheet. I understand that coffee shops like this have a cultish following, but for those of us who just want a great cup of coffee, it felt incredibly isolating. The girl that helped us was knowledgeable and kind, she explained they way it works and recommended the New Manhattan and Ambrosia roasts for us. Hubs wanted a latte though and since he didn't/couldn't find them on the menu, felt pressured to accept the steaming cup of goodness that was being hand crafted just for him. His $4.00 cup of coffee went almost untouched. \n\nI like the idea of Philz and if I'm in the area, I wouldn't hesitate to come back in. Certainly, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here. I hope other locations are easier to maneuver and not so suffocating with their coffee culture.  \n\nCoffee was predictably delicious. My Apple Pecan Vegan scone...OMFG.

Philz is a very well known place in this city, as within the first week I moved here I had several people recommend I try it immediately. After the first visit I knew why!\n\nThe \"Tantalizing Turkish\" dark roast with cardamom and fresh mint leaves is just such a treat. Once I can afford it I would love to buy a bunch of this and make it at home, all the time. The \"Jacobs Wonderbar\" is another one of my dark roast favorites, with a clean, robust coffee flavor and bold chocolate and nutty finish.\n\nI rarely get anything lighter, but when I do It's the Philharmonic or the Tesora. The staff, and obviously Phil, have great knowledge of the different blends, so if you aren't sure what you want they will help you based on what you like. And I'd be surprised if you dont enjoy what they have recommended.\n\nEventually I'd like to try all of them, I have yet to dislike anything I've had from Philz, and I have a feeling I never will!", "author": "Chris G."}

The first time, I found the Turkish blend to be amazingly smooth, with a sweet and nutty flavor. The cardamom was very subtle and enhanced the overall flavor of the coffee without overpowering it. This location (24th Street) gets pretty crowded, but I managed to find seating and an outlet so I could work on my laptop. All in all, a great experience. \n\nI returned and Phil was behind the bar - he made me a cup of Arabic coffee which was delicious - again, the same nuttiness and sweetness from whatever roasting process he uses. Although the cafe was crowded this time, I still managed to find a place to sit and work on my laptop. \n\nFinally, I tried the Philharmonic and the Tesora. Both were delicious - not quite as strong as the previous two blends I tried. There is absolutely no bitterness in his coffees and I believe even a non-coffee drinker would be hooked by these coffees, they are that good. Thanks Phil!", "author": "Robert C."}

I remember that he put actual mint leaves in it, which I'd never seen before. The closest thing was mint tea in the Middle East. I've tried this myself numerous times, and it always turns out terribly, so I need to go back and find out how Phil does it.\n\nI lived in the Mission, and I stopped at Philz almost every day. A few times, I got to listen in to the owner's family drama. I can tell you this for sure: Phil ran a tight ship and was an ambitious businessman. Whenever his son was working the counter, he couldn't get away with anything (like talking to his girlfriend on the phone when he was supposed to be serving customers). I loved it.\n\nSometimes, Phil would excitedly tell me about his plans for expansion. And I thought, yeah, whatever, the coffee is really good, but the cafe itself wasn't anything that special. People are always talking expansion, and I've heard more than one hard sell from a Middle Eastern guy in my life. Well, I guess I have to swallow my skepticism, because I check back five years later, and suddenly Philz is a veritable franchise, with locations all over the city and merchandise to boot.

The (mostly female) coffee makers seemed to vaguely worship Phil, who had a guru / eccentric Arab guy shtick working -- how's that for mixing metaphors?\n\nThe \"handmade\" coffee with lots of creme, sugar and a mint leaf was kind of appealing (in a Vietnamese coffee kind of way).  But, it just feels so odd.  The different coffee drinks are all the same, just made with different blends of beans.  They don't roast their own, do they?\n\nThe place itself is pretty dirty (I remember noticing a pet bird visiting the place); I was a bit concerned to eat the pastries.  Well, I tried one once.  It wasn't particularly good.\n\nThe coffee itself is OK, but the normal drink is mixed with so much cream and it's not really coffee.  I also have to confess, that I usually prefer espresso; hey, that's always made per person.  In terms of coffee quality, you won't confuse Philz with Blue Bottle, Ritual or Barefoot.\n\nPhil seems to have a good mind for business.  Wow, it's surprising that he was able to expand around the bay area.  Are the other locations owned by Phil or are they franchises?  Most of the others do seem cleaner, which is a plus.  And, perhaps serve better coffee as well.\n\nAnyway, Philz is interesting as something different.  If you are in the area (it's a long walk from my home), then it's OK for stopping in.  But, I won't go out of my way.\n\nIn the end, I'm a bit surprised that it's become trendy  in the past couple of years (after kicking around for a while).  It seems like the kind of place that Kramer, the hipster doofus, would have raved about.\n\nI don't begrudge Phil for creating his unique place, but I don't understand the popularity.\n\nIt's a quiet place; the noise level is low.\n\np.s.  Are Philz and Blue Bottle polar opposites?  Been noticing that people's opinion of the two chains tend to be positive for one or the other, but not the same for both.  Now, I'm trying to predict people's preferences.  Usually right, but have been wrong at least one.", "author": "Jice E."}

It mostly works, and the coffee is good, albeit not great.\n\nThe coffee is mostly fresh-roasted. The challenge comes to all the variants they keep in inventory, so sometimes lots grow older than a couple of weeks and it starts to show in the cup. We've bought some beans for home use and have found the freshness varying from what seems like a week to well over a month.\n\nThey are also heavy on darker roasts. And the blends are a bit of wannabe alchemy. In this era of knowing where your food comes from, Philz takes the weird approach of obscuring it with names that seem lifted from Disneyland rides. \n\nBut beware: never order anything besides the filter drip coffee here, or you'll be sorry. We once had an espresso (a real espresso, from an espresso machine, and not the fake espresso \"blend\" of Philz'), and it was outright dreadful - tasting like the watery, ashy flow out of a dormant volcano.", "author": "Teddy B."}

My attention turned to one of the paintings that had the name Phil on it. I put two and two together as to who that was. Of course, I wasn't helped by Phil, but I was helped by this lovely man who made a joke about what I wanted in my tea (\"so you want green, and you want tea in it\"), and asked me if I wanted mint in it. I said why not. I also went back to him quickly after I ordered and asked him how I pay and how I would get my drink (it was my first time) and he was really nice about it and explained the whole process, such as how they do a tasting process (very cool!) but since it's tea and it's super hot, I wouldn't be able to do it right away. Yet, I still went back and forth and asked how I would know my tea was ready. Yes... I was THAT customer for the day. When I finally got my tea, I have to say that I really liked it. The mint gave it a nice flavor. I feel like the $2.50 I spent was well spent. \n\nThere isn't really much a tea drinker can do here at Philz, but, I think at some point I will have to try the coffee here. I also think at some point I will attack the pastry display, because everything looked delicious!", "author": "Caroline L."}

However, one thing I would get picky on with this location is that I had no flipping idea what any of the coffees were, and I felt embarrassed to ask the baristas about each and every one in order to get a feel for which one would suit my tastebuds on a hangover Sunday. Instead, I ended up picking the Arabian coffee partially out of panic, partially because I had never had Arabian coffee before... so in a way, lack of detail was my friend... although it could have been my enemy too. \n\nOnce I got to the counter to order, I saw the different pots of beans, I realised I had picked a dark coffee roast, not normally my choice. Oh well, too late now. \n\nThe end result was a strong coffee with some bitter notes, but it was a really damn good cup of coffee. I also had a bunch of cream thrown in there to take some off the astringency out of the flavour, which was a first for me, as I don't normally use cream. The result was a decadent coffee that helped set me on the path of salvation, supported by an ice cream dessert at Humphrey Slocombe.\n\nIncidentally, felt like while we were trying to decide, there was no where to stand so kept bumping into customers while the baristas kept offering to serve us. It's a bit of an awkward place to stand... until I saw the bench. Feels like I was in a bit of a coffee shop etiquette lesson. It was hipsterville too, so I felt very much out of place.

And sure, there are cool people and beautiful landscapes and giant redwoods and all that, but the thing on the very tip-top of my list was Philz Coffee.

But since there's no extra cream/sugar/stirrer space bottleneck -- that's at the cashier -- and with more than one coffee \"maker\" on duty they dispatch long lines of customers that can curve around out to the sidewalk in a reasonable time. It's a different model than Starbucks' but they let staff dress and act normally.  They all look really smart too, which is important when you're getting coffee, right? \n\nThe layout inside is OK.\n\nPhilz allows non-customers to use the bench outside during street events like fairs, Carnaval and the Food fest. This is what you call being a good neighbor. \n\n\nCons\n\nPricey, at maybe $3.75 a cup for non-small, non-house, non-Fair Trade coffee. Their prices are not prominently displayed on their website either.\n\nSome people like to add their own cream & sugar.  Only my first cup was perfect but they'll tune it up for you.\n\nI don't like the guy in the hat.  Is this outgoing, gregarious personality Phil?  He told me he was the owner.

He was old school Latino.  He was older and he was cool in my young girl eyes.  I always tagged along with my friend as she was a guera dating a cholo who lived in the middle of the Mission.  I went as a bodyguard of sorts and most importantly to make google-y eyes at the brother.  He made google-y eyes back at me but told me I was too young for him.  That did not deter me.  He worked on cars a lot as he was an expert in hydraulics and it was the era of low riders.  I \"helped\" him whenever I could.  Not being much help as my eyes were only on him.  I had it bad.\n\nOne day my friend's boyfriend took me aside and said:\n\n\"Mamita, stay away from my brother.  He's a chipper.\"\n\n\"What is a chipper?\"\n\n\"A non-addicted heroin user.\"\n\nI watched all the after school specials.  I saw Born to Win.

That being said, there are reasons why I don't like this coffee shop at all. \n\nFirst off, the baristas know phil'z coffee and phil'z customers but fail to understand coffee customers of other kinds. This is not the type of coffee shop where you can pour your own cream and sugar, which I don't since I take my coffee black. Ok, so I order black, and every time I do, the barista says, \"Really? No cream, no sugar? Ughhh... OK?\" Yes, OK, please don't question me, that's what I ordered. And it has happened before when the barista felt it was alright to slip in a piece of mint on their own doing. The barista has also told me to cheer up, smile, and that made me even more put off. I don't go get coffee for cult like attitude, and certainly not for some hyper happy behind a counter to give me life advice. Not normal coffee shop behavior.  \n\nSecondly, annoying people sit around Phil'z. I think this place is some what cult-ish, but don't blame me for being put off by the google crazed freak sitting next to me blabbing on her cell phone in a business call. They don't have a no cell phone policy, so I guess Phil'z is not to be blamed, but nevertheless that incident has caused me to go home and now write this. \n\nI have tried maybe 5 or 6 different varieties of their coffee, and I can't say I like any of them more than blue bottle or ritual. I think coffee should be drank black, and not masked by \"turkish\" aromas, mint, or sweet additives. This place is still better than the corner store, and it is still down the block from my house. Many people love it and I can see why, but I don't think it hits the mark of being the top coffee shop in San Francisco for several reasons.", "author": "Chelsea W."}

I can't even remember what I typed.  I proof read my work, i have put the word \"donut\" in the middle of TWO sentences.

It's like finally getting the super cute dude into bed and you're like, \"Really?  That's it?\"  Actually, that's pretty much ANY guy but anywayz.  Let's try this again.  The donuts?  They're good.  The vanilla ones are actually really good.  They taste like they won't kill you from unhealthiness, which is a nice change of pace from the normal donut.  The vanilla ones are better than the chocolate ones.  They remind me of a super fresh version of the \"Nutrilicious\" brand vegan donuts that you can get at Whole Foods.  I will definitely have them again and they are worth seeking out, especially for us vegans and those who don't want to die from the scrumptious fattiness of the regular donut.  The vanilla ones with sprinkles are the standout.  Sprinkles.  Delicious.  \n\nThe coffee?  It's good.  I don't get this whole \"french pressed\" revolution that's sweepin' the city but I like the vanilla flavored cappuccinos from 7-11 because GUESS WHAT?  That shit is straight up DELICIOSO.

I hate to name drop but let's just say her name rhymes with Laura B. The plan was I'd meet at her place then walk down to Philz with her foster dog Sweet Jane. Sweet Jane is, as her name would imply, very sweet and also named Jane so you should adopt her immediately. I have to admit though, that I couldn't help but notice her her huge nipples. She also, apparently, has a vag that says, \"Been there, done that.\" Not literally or else she'd be on Letterman. Anyway, if your criteria for adopting a dog involves the condition of its nipples and vag then you, sir, are one sick motherfu...I'm getting a little off subject here but bear with me because there is a point.\n\nPhilz is the kind of funky cafe that you would expect in the Mission. Mismatched old furniture, houseplants and newspapers. The kind of bohemian joint you can snuggle up with your honeypants and plan a revolution.\n\nSo we get there and I order a drip coffee. It's what they do, make drip coffee one cup at a time. I must have said something wrong because the woman behind the counter hesitated, said, \"Um, okaaay,\" and the old dude in line behind me practically yells in my ear, \"ROOKIE!\" Now, I've only been to Philz a couple of times but I didn't realize how presumptuous it was to simply ask for a cup of coffee at a cafe. Luckily, I am a patient person and practiced at dealing with douchebags which, unfortunately, make up the majority of society. See how good I am at that?\n\nI think it's a little weird that, if you take cream or sugar, they put it in your coffee for you. Despite that, it's always been to my liking so I guess they know what they're doing. Oh, and they use cream not half & half. I only know this because the older gentleman was trying to persuade Laura to have the cream in her coffee. She's a vegan and apparently practiced in the same social skills as me. We're a couple of gaddamned SAINTS I tell you.\n\nTrue enough, there were vegan donuts and between the two of us we purchased their entire selection. I'm an omnivore and by that I mean I eat ANYTHING. Shit that's fallen on the floor, something hanging off your face, well you get it. The white cake donuts weren't bad but the chocolate was just not right. To illustrate this point, when offered a half a chocolate donut Sweet Jane spit it out. Let me repeat that just in case the gravity of that statement was missed. A DOG, who most likely suffered some amount of trauma in her life, (I don't know this for sure but one doesn't get nipples like that without SOME trauma) refused a FREE donut. I mean, shit, even I ate the chocolate one. This dog clearly has more discriminating tastes than myself.\n\nAnyway, despite the mediocre vegan donuts and elitism the coffee is exceptional. This stuff might even help you kick that nasty meth smoking habit you have.", "author": "Josua P."}

However, as a loyal Peet's drinker who buys fresh coffee to brew at home, I feel that while Philz has a vast selection of coffees, none of them come close in flavor to what is available at other places. \n\nI have a theory...perhaps Philz appeals to coffee drinkers who like their coffee drink with a little sum'n sum'n. The cream, the mint, the personal attention...it's fabulous. But when it gets down to it...the beans, that is, the coffee... just doesn't measure up. I enjoy rich coffee-flavored coffee, with a splash of cream. I don't need a mint leaf and fancy footwork to mask what truly good coffee tastes like. \n\nThat being said, I do enjoy having a venerable establishment like Philz in the hood.

Then after I'd waited in the queue AND for my brew. Phil got into the habit of offering a taste of my coffee to someone waiting behind me (either by pouring into a 2nd cup or off his crusty spoon). To them he'd say \"Doesn't this taste like love?\". Did I mention that I'd still yet to pay for the coffee? Phil's sips are expensive and I work for a living. He did this to me like 5 times. \n\nFinally when my best buddy (whom I had brought there originally) complained that Phil had been doing this to him too the last 3 times he'd been, I hit the road and haven't looked back. \n\nFive star coffee, no star crazy.\n\nUpdates Alert; 12/24/06\n\nPhilz iz a Corna Store.

Because the ROI of caffeine vs. cost per cup is on my side\n... Because the girl behind the counter is too cool for school, but nice enough to dispense her nuggets of coffee wisdom\n... Because I can sit on the recycled furniture for hours and discuss the meaning of life\n... Because I took a then boyfriend there and it changed his life (then we broke up, that's another story)\n... because I can pick up a little something across the road, at the Mexican bakery, and take it into Philz so it goes with my strong wonderful coffee\n\nThat is why I keep going back, even though its in the middle of no where.", "author": "Joyce L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-01-21", "description": "Mighty interesting reading these Philz reviews.  I guess you either love it or hate it which says something about the product.  Philz coffee is just straight out bold and strong as hell.  I happen to like my coffee strong.  Many years ago, when I was a younger man with a younger man's kidneys, I loved to drink a cup of Spinelli coffee every day.  Spinelli was the first local roaster chain that I remember outside of North Beach.  There was one just kitty corner to my apartment in the Castro (it's now a Tully's).  Anyway, it was fabulously strong and dark, like drinking dirt, and I LOVED it.  Unfortunately I eventually discovered that, aside from making me a kind of a jerk at work, it also started giving me back problems.\n\n*sigh*\n\nNow I reserve my coffee for once a week, usually on Saturdays.  Quality over Quantity, that's my motto.  To that end, after religiously driving across town to Blue Bottle in Hayes Valley, I decided to branch out and try some other alternatives.  Phliz is my current favorite and, even though Blue Bottle still has a special place in my caffeine lovin' heart, Philz is my favorite vice.  I have been branching out lately but still my favorite is the Tesora where they cream and sugar it for you.  It is an extremely pleasurable cup of joe although I can't drink anything larger than a small for fear of grinding all my teeth to a pulp.  It's is some serious stimulant.\n\nNow, I should also mention that, after reading the 7X7 article on the micro-roasting phenomenon happening in SF right now, a major factor in the enjoyment of your cup of coffee is the culture in which you are consuming it.  For instance, Philz is all about the drip coffee, one cup at a time, ground per person with the blend of your choice.  You don't come here for the espresso as far as I can tell, that's not Philz market.  You come for the drip.  You want espresso, read one of my other reviews which, when I write it, will illustrate the better locale for an espresso.\n\nBut for drip, Philz is a favorite of mine and, as you can tell from the rest of these reviews, it's worth coming in, just to see if it's the kind of thing you dig.", "author": "Torbin B."}

Maybe being so accessible could become a problem because Philz is strangely addictive.  Halfway through a cup-o-Philz, you realize that what you are drinking has to be illegal somewhere because it tastes so good...or maybe it's the fact that you suddenly transform into the most perky productive person you have ever known...and you almost annoy yourself.  I am still not convinced that there is only caffeine in my coffee....but, you will NEVER hear me complain about a noticeable spike in energy that lasts for hours. =)\n\nWhile I feel like Philz deserves 5 stars for the coffee selection and fabulous brewing technique (complete with creaming and sugaring to your liking)...there was a rather angry vegan in the store that was demanding to know how in the world a vegan donut could be made.  The coffee brewing professional behind the counter dryly explained that they were called vegan because there was a lack of animal products in them and smiled sweetly as she walked away.  This was not good enough for the vegan...she wanted ingredients! Now!  \n\nThough I kinda think most vegans become militant and angry because they are secretly starving, I kind of sided with her on this one.  Please make the ingredients available for your bakery items.  There are lots of special diets out there that could benefit from this information (i.e. gluten allergy, vegan, nut allergies, etc.).  In a progressive city like ours that loves to know where food comes from (sustainable, organic, local), I don't think this is too much to ask.  Plus, the poor hungry vegan would have been able to actually eat a donut with a clear conscience.  All that aside, I heart  Philz and I can't wait for my next cup.", "author": "Sarah B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-06-05", "description": "It's worth noting the opinions on Philz are either wholly positive or else wholly negative (though the overall bulk of the responses clearly lean positive). There's very little \"middle ground\" and I think that reflects how strongly people hold an opinion about coffee (whereas, I just can't imagine you'd have such a strong swing of opinions over a sandwich shop). \n\nPersonally, I love Philz coffee: the #1 with sugar and cream. I think they make a much stronger and much more complex and rich cup of coffee than any other cafe I've found in SF. I think the unique flavor of his coffee is precisely why people love it or hate it - it won't remind you of Peet's or any other generic coffee chain. Philz is Philz. \n\nI haven't been to Ritual yet but I have been to Blue Bottle on numerous occassions. BB can make a good drip but they change their beans all the time so you don't always get the same cup twice whereas I appreciate the consistency at Philz. BB's mocha is overpriced and dull compared to Philz. That said, I do think BB is pretty good. Just not as good as Philz. \n\nJust to note: I live within 5 minutes of five cafes but I will get in my car and drive across town for a cup of Philz. Yeah, I'm that addicted. \n\nBy the way, for those who found his coffee too sweet - they ALWAYS ask if you want sugar and cream. You can always say no and then add what you want, your way. \n\nMy only complaint about Philz is that not all the baristas there will knock out the same cup of coffee. I usually prefer to have Phil or his son make my cup and sometimes, I'll get back a so-so cup from one of the other folks who work there or at the 18th st. location.

The last thing I want to encounter at 8:30 on a Sunday morning is a boss treating his staff like dirt while belittling labor laws. Phil was standing right behind the woman who was about to make me what would likely be a delicious cup of coffee (for which I had passed 3 other cafes along the way) so I heard way too much of his tantrum. \n\nPerhaps there was some problem with the way that breaks were given on Saturday. I dunno. But I do know that Phil was out of line today.  He chose to very publicly reprimand the employee whom he had entrusted with the task of giving breaks. When his employee explained her decision (Saturdays never slow down so staff may have to break during busy periods), he suggested that she pull people from breaks if it got busy again.  \n\nWhen his employee reminded him that the law has clear requirements for breaks, Phil really lost his cool. Choice remarks included, \"There's the law and then there's right and wrong\". Sorry, Phil, but you're the one who's wrong here, not labor laws. If you have the capital to expand across SF, then you can fully staff your locations on Saturdays to prevent this problem. Your workers deserve the protections of the law and they also deserve more respect than you gave today. Maybe you were having a bad day, but your choice to publicly berate your staff was a poor one.\n\nI'm not the only person who told the cashier that I won't go back if Phil insists on treating his employees this way. Sadly, Phil got grumpy with the cashier right as it was my turn to pay. I got my cup back empty and left without coffee. Walked back and got a nice cuppa at Park Cafe on Folsom instead.\n\n2 stars because the (expensive) coffee tastes good and the staff was still super attentive and nice as their boss made the whole place look terrible.", "author": "r. k."}

For all you old school Santa Cruz coffee shop fans....Philz reminds me of the Java house a bit. Similar warehousey look, with lots of plants, good coffee and a great vibe!\n\nI am a coffee snob and I have to say wow! I'm in love. I had a cup of the house, #19  Tesora. Which as i understand was Philz first blend. Delicious, well balanced, good bodied coffee...did I say yum! My gf had the Ambrosia which was also delicious. We liked both some much that she got a 1/2 lb of Ambrosia and I got a 1/2 of Tesora.\n\nAlso gotta mentiond that they do make \"one cup of coffee at a time,\" no bs. They have a drip bar setup and make it for you. I got to chatting with the baristas about the \"espresso\" and he was quick to admit that it's a misnomer. The way Philz achieves espresso is by running the coffee thru the grounds a couple times. While you get a good thick coffee that tastes like espresso, it doesn't have the wow, ohh--ahhh factor of getting a nice little shot of espresso from so fancy looking Italian machine.  But I digress...when the coffee is good who cares how you make it! They also have two styles of Chai tea, different spices, which I'll have to come back and try.\n\nIt's really nice when a place lives up to it's reputation.

They brew their coffee a cup at a time and are very serious about quality. The Philz staff is also extremely friendly, as I had a ton of questions as a first time customer and they were patient and helpful. The man helping me suggested the tesora as a good coffee for a Philz newb, and it was all that and more. I'll definitely head back there the next time I'm in the Mission.

Don't bother with the espresso drinks there -- they're good, but don't hold a candle to the killer blends and customization of every drink you get from the fresh-ground beans (and I mean ground-in-front-of-your-eyes fresh) and the friendly banter with the person making it (try telling Phil your mood instead of ordering off the menu; he'll make you something perfect).

We had heard Philz we awesome so we tried it out.\n\nThere was a sign outside that said they had Turkish. I thought \"I LOVE turkish coffee! I guess I'll have to throw out consistency of my drink for this crawl.\" and went in the door.\n\nFirst, the layout of the place is a bit weird for ordering. First we lined up at the cash register only to realize that we should move past the register to where there were hand written signs saying \"Order Here\". Then you order, then you go back to the register to pay then you go back to where you ordered to wait for your drink. You don't always have choice in the layout of your shop, but that wasn't so hot.\n\nThen I walked up to an open barista and ordered a Turkish coffee. I realized I wasn't actually going to get a turkish coffee when she asked if I wanted cream or sugar. I look a closer look at the surroundings and realized I was getting a pour over coffee so I got it black, since that is how I get my drip coffee. (Let's all admit it - pour over coffee is just a fancy name for individually served drip coffee. It is the equivalent of getting a single cup Melitta handed to you, but you have to wait for someone else to pour the water and let the water go through the grounds).\n\nThe others ordered a variety of things including the \"hand crafted espresso\" which is just coffee grounds with water poured through 3 times, it seems.\n\nWe realized after we left that none of us were comfortable here. Perhaps because we didn't know what we were ordering or what we would get. I liken it to going to a bar for the very first time and seeing lots of people around ordering things you've never heard of, looking at a menu and only seeing terms like \"Sex on a Beach\" and \"Mojito\" with prices next to them, then being asked questions about how you want that drink when you have basically closed your eyes and pointed to the menu to decide what to order.\n\nAnyway, so we get our drinks and leave. My turkish is completely undrinkable. I have no idea what this coffee is, but it is burned tasking and sour and bitter all at the same time. I poured mine out. The hand drawn espresso was awful too. Only one person got a drink that any of us liked and she said she couldn't pronounce it or spell it, but she was also sure it was because she got the cream and sugar that it was any good.\n\nThe fresh mint is a nice touch.", "author": "Mitch H."}

Now, I've only been coming here for a couple of months, so maybe that's not enough time to accurately assess a place. \n\nSo far, these are my observations:\n\n-Boy, do the employees like to toot their own horns! One time I was in there for a few hours, I probably heard each girl who was working there that morning tell any customer willing to listen how fucking great and unique Philz coffee is! At first I thought that this might be some tactic to kiss up to Phil, but then realized that a lot of these proclamations were going on when Phil was no where within ear shot. The girl who made my cup of coffee that day went on and on about how much I was going to love it, and how Philz was the only coffee shop she would go to in the city, even before she worked there. It's like, okay, that's nice. I just want some coffee, yo. \n\n-That said, Phil himself seems like a pretty chill dude, and I've never heard HIM bragging about his coffee, so I don't know where the employees get this high and mighty attitude. Phil is rad; he smiles and says hi every time.\n\n-The control freak in me is slightly irked by the fact that THEY put the cream and sugar in your cuppa joe FOR you. I have to say, it throws me off. It's a task that I am so used to doing on my own, and I like to control the amounts of cream and sugar that go into it. Also, along with the whole tooting their own horn thing, on a couple of occasions, I asked for a certain drink to be modified (like, no cream, but sugar is okay; or, can you please use milk today instead of cream...you know, thinking about my health, I guess) and they'd be like, \"Can I please just make it for you the way it's supposed to be made? I PROMISE you're going to love it. It'll be the best cup of coffee you've ever had...okay?\" So what do you say to that, huh? I'm just trying to go easy on the cream and this is what I'm met with. Well, thanks, that helps a lot!\n\n-On to the environment, it's very relaxed, and that I like. I enjoy the big, air-y feel to the space, with the windows and large tables, and the weird assortment of chairs. The real reason I usually go there is for the free wi-fi. You could hang in there and get a lot of work done. Not a high-strung environment, like some of the other coffee spots in the mission. The vibe in Philz is super-chill. \n\n-Bathrooms are important to me. The bathroom here is large but very dark, even with the light on. Clean seeming, but also kind of feels like an outhouse. One time it smelled horrible, but last time I was there it smelled a-okay.\n\n-I can't decide what I think about the mint leaves on top of the coffee. Again, messes with the control freak. I would like it more if YOU could pick a piece of mint and put it on top, if the mood struck. I just don't like giving so many verbal directions when it comes to getting a cup of coffee!\n\n-As much as the employees have annoyed me throughout the summer, they are on top of their game, and very quick to serve you as soon as you come it. They are spot-on in terms of customer service. You may just be in for a preachy monologue, that's all.", "author": "Shannon R."}

I am also a coffee snob and try to avoid corporate america so Philz was the obvious choice for coffee.  Add in the Turkish coffee and abundance of vegan cookies and even Phil himself and I really couldn't be happier with a coffee shop.\n\nThen one day I went in, not long after the re-arrangement of countertops.  I got my coffee and looked for a lid.  You, know, the plastic kind that go on your disposable cup that don't cost a thing (but you probably should be using a travel mug from home).  Usually they are on the counters in abundance, but not that day.  Oh no.  They were no where to be found....except for on the counter kinda behind the cash register, but ambiguously within reach of the groggy customer (that would be me).  So as I'm handing my $2.50 for a cup of black coffee (overpriced but worth it), I ask the woman if I can have a lid.  She sorta pauses, goes \"umm OK\" as i go ahead and grab one.  Then she hands me my change and says \"I'm only giving you $16 back because the lids are $1.50\"\n\nWHAT?  no sign?  couldn't have told me that before i grabbed it? For that price, the lid probably should be gold plated.  with at least a cubic zirconia bit of flair.  Where the fuck is Phil and who is this blond woman?\n\nI cried robot tears onto my overpriced lid on my bus ride to work - I knew I'd never go back there ever again.", "author": "Katherine K."}

Not good, not AWESOME, just OK. As a matter of personal history into my own life, I am a coffee snob. I own my own french press, I buy premium whole beans, and I grind them in my Burr grinder.\nTechnically speaking, all the coffee's I've had there (each different), taste the same.  You get about 3 minutes of actual uniqueness, then every sip afterward, will be like the last cup of coffee you had.\n\nRealistically speaking, since they are not a Star Bucks, and seem to be popular with the locals, and tout how great their coffee is with all their blends, you'd figure, I mean you'd *really really* figure, that they would invest in some actual glass mugs. Instead you get these crappy organic paper cups (yay, good for the environment, but puts a stale taste in your mouth). Seriously, it's like pouring Alagash or Chimay into a plastic cup, or serving Fillet Mignon on the carpet. Get with it Philz!\n\n2) Service: Excellent. They're always polite and have helped me in my indecisiveness of choosing one of their zillion coffees.\n\n3) Environment: Fine. It's obviously a Hipster hangout over there on 24th back behind the Mission. Congratulations on pulling people past Valencia. I'd like to think it's the perfect location to fool you into thinking it's the ghetto, but really, nothing is going to happen.

Philz practically begs you to make this your living room away from home - that place you bring your laptop, plug into one of the many powerstrips, and hunker down into the garage sale chic furnishings, oh so reminiscent of the house you shared with five dudes freshman year of college, for hours upon hours upon hours.  Sometimes I bring my lunch with me, or even leave in the middle of my sess', grab some takeout, and come back.  The friendly folks who work here never seem to mind.  I always feel welcome, if not outright welcomed.  And for these things, Philz, you have my affection.\n\nAlas, the coffee just doesn't do it for me, which is why I can't give you more than two stars.  In fact, I'm baffled by you, San Franciscans, and your obsession with your Philz brew.  Aside from being fresher than the regular old cup of joe since it's made by the cup - which, don't get me wrong, *is* worth something - it's just really not that spectacular.  I've tried many of the blends and most have not gone down well.  I can stomach \"Philtered Soul\" and \"Canopy of Heaven\" with plenty of soy milk.  And sometimes I have to when I need the caffeine.  Otherwise, I do better to grab an espresso from the Blue Bottle kiosk around the corner from my apartment and sip on Philz tea (which is quite good).", "author": "Lulu W."}

I had always hated the taste of black coffee, and even after I would add tons of sugar, I still didn't enjoy drinking it. And don't get me wrong, I had tried a lot of coffee. I wanted to like it, I just couldn't. Then I learned a little more about how to make the perfect cup of coffee. Make sure the beans aren't old or burnt, freshly grind the beans before making each cup, and brew a fresh pot every time you want some-- no using the brew from 12 hours ago that still looks good.\n\nNow, meet Philz. My friend who is obsessed with coffee convinces me to go here with her to try it. I order the ecstatic iced coffee, and my whole world is changed. I have finally found the perfect cup of coffee. As is advertised, every cup is made fresh, and it is amazing how much you can taste the difference. I had some cream added with a little sugar, and it was amazing! There was no bitter after-taste that I normally experience with other coffee joints, it wasn't too sweet, and the cream didn't overpower the coffee. I tried it once without sugar and it was still amazing! Ever since I tried place, I cannot stop raving about it. And I am now an obsessive coffee drinker. I live in Daly City and go to school at SFSU, but I will travel here before classes just to get a morning brew-- it's THAT good. \n\nAnd did I mention the awesome baristas? I've had a different one every time I've gone there, and they have always been so polite and nice, even on a busy day.

I thought to myself--'oh no'--- not one of those overly numerous unpersonalited coffee houses that has no passion about anything they sell and worse their main stay product is standard or sub-standard and is rarely fresh.\r\n\r\nI have been on this part of 24th Street many times and have not really paid attention to what was on this particular corner of 24 & Folsom Street.   Upon entering this 'come as you are' coffee house was a sign board displaying 5 coffee specialties:  so far i have tried only 2 - the Turkish and Arabic.  \r\n\r\nI wasn't sure what to expect so I ordered the Turkish coffee at the Barrista Bar.  I was asked if I wanted sugar and milk and I said \"No.\"  The wonderous Barrista said \"are you sure...\"  she then said \"let me make it the way I like it... you will like it.\"  So she immediately goes to work pours the hot water from a distance into a low tech (high flavour) individually brewed cup of coffee.  I savoured the herbaceous blend and the powerfully blissful coffee.  This I knew was going to be a treat upon my first pursed sip.  \r\n\r\nI like the humble setting and very modest interior-- with coffee bags all carefully classified and this truly creates the coffee experience that I seek each time I go out for coffee-- this truly is a cafeteria.  I love to have service of someone taking their art form and giving me the best offering.   \r\n\r\nWe are such an individualised society that we give impossibly smug orders to a coffee maker at a branded coffee house --we cannot never truly get a full and ever reaching experience and exposure to new things.  Phil is passionate about his art and it comes across coherently and completely.\r\n\r\nCoffee is very important and it sets the stage for the day ahead.   I am a big food and wine lover.  And what I enjoy about coffee is that it has an even more complex flavour spectrum than does wine.  I look for and am fussy about not having the best in food and wine (it doesn't always mean expensive for expensive sake).\r\n\r\nTry Philz--simply amazing coffee and great experience-- one of my favourite coffee houses that I have found in my many travels.", "author": "Jaime Patricio M."}

Philz is awesome because it takes the ubiquitous cafe idea and makes it so much better just by taking the flavor of their coffee and tea as far as they can go.  The chai with soymilk is the best chai I've ever had and the Istanbul Treat is a wonderfully interesting combination of green and black tea, mint, and cardamom to create something that's really special.  I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but I love the Tesora mocha and understand why its been described as a masterpiece.\n\nThe place is homey and the cluttered feel of the cafe adds to the experience for me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-07-12", "description": "I'm torn about this review.  It's obvious Philz is an institution, and the business has received so many good reviews so it's probably warranted its reputation.  Probably.  But I wonder what they put in the water in SF that turns so many into the easily impressed.  Is Philz' coffee good?  I've been here once, so who am I do be in a position exactly to say?  But I can quibble about issues outside of its deliciousness or lack thereof.\n\n1 - Organization:  Where the F is the line?  Oh, wait, there isn't one.  People just come in and order willy nilly.  Baristas just call out and people step up.  If you've never been, be prepared to know what you want before someone jumps in front of you.\n2 - Board layout:  Sure, the coffees and prices are listed up high for all to see.  So why not put the board that lists the type of coffees up there, too?  You know, the one at knee level in front of the counters being blocked by the many patrons who walk in front of you while you try to get a grasp on what type of coffee to drink for the day?  Yeah, that one.  Put that shit at eye level or above where people won't obstruct my view (this goes back to my organization problem)\n3 - Aesthetic:  I'm simply not a fan of shabby coffee house chic.  It's not chic.  I don't like places that look like they found their furniture on the street corner an hour earlier or pulled it from some apartment that's been condemned due to prostitution.\n4 - Drinker's Choice:  I don't like that I can't dictate the amount of milk or half and half and sugar I put in my coffee.  At Philz, the baristas have to put it in.  What is this, Dunkin' Donuts?  If each coffee is individualized, then why would I want a barista putting the milk/sugar in my coffee?  Let me figure out how much or how little of each I want in my drink.  Just because I put a certain amount of each in one type of coffee, does not mean I'll do the same for a different roast.\n\nThat said, the coffee itself I tried (It'z the Best) wasn't the best.  It was satisfactory.  I've had better (and cheaper!!-SF really brings new meaning to the phrase \"rip off\" when it comes to individually dripped cups of coffee).  I also tried my brother's.  I thought the mint leaf overpowered his coffee somewhat.\n\nBaristas were super nice.  And I loved that Phil actually works here.  So how can I not at least give three stars?  That's a real work ethic, and I don't begrudge him his success.  The next time I come back, I'll be better prepared to order quick, get my cup of coffee, and get the hell out of there.", "author": "Brendan Jude L."}

I had been up really late, and my patience was worn thin by this point.  I could've stopped at any number of other coffee places on the way, but for whatever reason I wandered into Philz in a slight daze.  There was a line of people eagerly awaiting their drinks, and the counter person asked me if I'd ever been here before.  I told her no, and she assured me that I was in for an eye opening cup of joe.\n\nI settled into one of their tattered old living room seats five minutes later and took a long slow sip as the opening strains of Lou Reed's \"Vicious\" wafted down from the ceiling-mounted speakers.  This place is cool, I thought to myself.  The messy living room vibe was sinking in heavy, and it hadn't even really registered to me yet just how good the coffee itself was.  \n\nblah blah blah blah blah...so anyways, the coffee was really good.  They specialize in these sort of proprietary drinks, which are not your ordinary latte, americano, etc.  The flavor is very delicate, and they have a velvety texture to them as you take each sip.  They serve each cup with a healthy scoop of what appears to be brown sugar, and often throw a mint leaf on top.  Its somewhat gimmicky to be sure, but you won't find another cup of coffee like this any other place in the city.  \n\nSince I live in the Sunset, and don't usually come out to the Mission except for the nightlife, I find Philz to be a good excuse to head across town on a Sunday morning.

Much of the mission can be divided into \"oh, that's close to Philz!\" and everywhere else. That said however, I don't think that it really lives up to its hype. \n\nOkay, the coffee is awesome. In fact, I tend to agree that it's the best in town. The Tesora is the veteran coffee drinker's best friend and the Soo Good, lives up to its namesake. Also, unsurprisingly, the tea (green with mint and honey) is also fantastic. Overall, whatever liquid just filled your little brown cup is going to be great. \n\nBesides the coffee though, Philz leaves much to be desired. The layout is terrible; both getting your coffee and trying to find a place to sit feel more like a trek into the Temple of Doom, than a pleasant way to spend the morning. It's constantly packed, it's pretty expensive, and finding a place to plug in your computer is usually a fruitless endeavor. \n\nI still love Philz, however, if they ditched the wifi, got rid of some of their decaying couches and chairs, and streamlined the ordering process, I would no longer have a reason to walk past it in favor of the numerous other cafes on 24th.", "author": "Evan S."}

Each cup is made separately - that's right, one cup at a time - fresh brewed drip with your choice of beans. They even sugar and cream it for you. I  worried they'd over sweeten, but they added just the right amount. I ordered #1, a Turkish brew, hoping for strength and body. It delivered. Everyone else seemed equally pleased with their individual choices. It's all just a matter of deciding which of the more than 20 roasts is right for you. There are a few non-coffee selections, as well. One friend ordered an Istanbul tea, which was aromatic and strong. The menu also boasts iced tea, hot chocolate, and iced coffee.\n\nAs an additional bonus, a gentleman lounged on a bench rockin' the blues on a harmonica. My toe was tapping even before the caffeine hit my system. It added to the quirky, earthy feel of the joint. \n\nOverall: excellent atmosphere, excellent service, excellent coffee.

This place plays off of this- why look like a shack and charge so much for coffee? I liked the coffee, though I can see how a lot of people wouldn't- it's very strong and contrary to the descriptions of their roasts, it's bitter. To be fair, I may like other Philz locations more since a few of my gripes about this place is the ambiance.

Not only do they brew your cup individually for you, they grind the beans for your cup of coffee. Even Alton Brown would approve.\n\nIn addition to the many house blends, the barristas will custom blend coffee for you. (My boyfriend's favorite is a combination of Red Sea and Timor, once recommended by a barrista.) The Philharmonic is yummy right off the shelf. Unlike the coffee at some places, Philz' coffee does not require milk or sugar to make it drinkable, and if it is added it can detract from the coffee. This does mean that the mocha leaves something to be desired, in particular, less mochaness. I'm usually a fan of the mocha but Philz coffee deserves to not be drowned by chocolate.\n\nThe barristas add cardamom and fresh mint by default to some blends, so if you don't like these, tell the barrista to leave them out. The people who complained about some strange spice in the coffee mean the cardamom, which is used when making Turkish coffee.\n\nBut the real gem at Philz is no surprise-- Blue Mountain. I was having a really bad day once and I went to Philz and had the Blue Mountain-- I was immediately invincible. It is more expensive (I think it was $6, or $1/inch). It is the most exquisite cup of coffee that I have ever had. It can not be described or believed; you'll just have to treat yourself and see.\n\nAnother gem is Phil himself. He's adorable.

And Philz is never REALLY on my way to where I want to go; but there is something about Philz that always beckons me in. The  much loved \"Phil\" and his family seem to have created such a loving and warm environment in this coffee gem of a place, that it's easy to see why people love to wander into Philz and hang around. Quickly becoming regulars - and taking their coffee regular - with a sprinkle of organic sugar. The outside of Philz is adorned with plants and benches, and almost stands out as an oasis - among the other shops near it. And they really do mean it - with their 'simple - understood , yet understated' mantra of welcoming everyone and anyone inside their place - a tough act to achieve in the Mission. And the coffee----- I swear I don't drink coffee -  - but when I've decided that I need a quick  caffeine pick-me up - Philz rocks.. Each cup brewed fresh and with a refreshing bout of great conversation. And it really is perfect. Fresh, sweet, and strong. The way coffee was meant to be drunk. The waking up cheesy 'Folgers' kind of coffee. The - ''if it was a perfect world' and those  Folgers' coffee drinking, overly dramatic  love-birds stopped playing games and really ended up together'  kind.", "author": "Jessica T."}

So I thought why not? I believe I had the turkish blend with cream and sugar and I liked it. Plus that small cup kept me going all night (had some project that was due the next day). I liked that the coffee had cardamom and mint, at first it didn't seem that those two aromatics would go but they did. I guess with Philz coffee, the reactions are really mixed up, so it really is a matter of preference. But I personally prefer philz to ritual coffee roasters, it's laid back, and inviting. Good thing to note, for those of you that like to control the amount of cream and sugar, you could just order it black. Phil has a condiment counter with cream and sugar, right by two already made, ready to go coffee filled thermoses. And if you're into soy you could also get your coffee with soy milk instead.\r\n\r\n*******UPDATE*******\r\nSo I come to Philz after not having his coffee for months (I was on a tight budget which meant i could not afford Philz)  and I ordered my usual stand by, the turkish brew. The employees were not the usual faces I remember seeing, but they were just as nice. But I have to say the coffee didn't taste the way I remembered it did, I am still recovering from the aftertaste. This made me wonder if the experience of Philz coffee is dependent on who is working the counter that day.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2005-11-06", "description": "I used to manage an espresso bar ages ago, and we roasted our own beans. I consider myself fairly expert in all matters java. And I have had coffee all over the city, all the time. So it is not lightly that I say Philz is some of the very best. Fresh beans and people who know what to do with them. Assuming a place is using premium-grade arabica beans, the flavor mainly comes down to roasting, blending, and preparation. Beans should be roasted the week you drink them - ideally within a few days of roasting. As soon as beans are roasted, they start to lose flavor, plain and simple. This is why Starbucks sucks (coffee trucked in from who-knows-where, roasted who-knows-when, prepared by clueless barristas on automatic machines.) It's why Pete's is fairly acceptable (yes they are a chain, but a local chain that delivers fresh beans several times a week - and the barristas tend to know their craft and product.)\nSo any way - Philz: the fresh mint was a nice touch - though they should ask. If you don't like mint, it's going to permeate the flavor. I ordered a cappuccino the first time. Their steamer was broken - so I got a latte. Excellent lat, but you would think a coffee place would have a backup steaming solution, no? The second trip I had two of their brewed variatals - yummy! By the way, the cup-at-a-time is not a gimmick. That's the ideal way to prepare coffee - it also starts to lose flavor as soon as it's brewed. If you're not serving a lot at once - it does suffer slightly being kept in a thermos warmer. This is why experts will usually use a press-pot or simply mix some boiling water with grounds for professional tastings. They had some Mexican pastries on offer: good almond croissant-type things. Unfortunately, they were not in a case, but just open on a counter . . . including open to flies. Make sure to grab one from the bottom box. So these little things spare me from the 5-star rating.\nPhilz is cheaper and has about 500% less hipster attitude than somewhere like Ritual. A great choice for coffee in the Mission. Grab a latte from Philz on Saturday morning, then walk down the street to Taqueria Puerto Vallerarta for some sidewalk tacos. Heaven! And a perfect SF brunch for about $7 instead of $17.", "author": "David C."}

What I didn't expect was for the coffee to taste like coffee smells. Even if you don't like coffee, you probably like the smell of it; there are few better smells in the world - I'd put it up there with grass and sun-dried laundry. Until Philz, I'd never had a cup of coffee that fully delivered on its olfactory tease. \nPhil himself is a good reason to go. A compact, intense man with a mustache and natty fedora, Phil will sometimes ignore your order and decide which of the many baffling choices on his menu you SHOULD have. I don't know how he does it, but he's never wrong. The first time I went, he fixed me in his Valentino-like gaze and nodded, then made me something called a Tesora, which is a rich, lightly sweetened, insanely good cup of coffee. A bit of cream, just the right amount, spanks the coffee back from the edge of roastiness, making the whole affair slide down your throat like velvet. A mint leaf perched saucily at the top, like the feather in Phil's fedora, is all that stops you from tossing the whole thing back in a shot.

Listen, before you start your rant, I realize the beans are inferior to those heavenly micro-roasted delectation's of Blue Bottle, but please understand--at Philz, the game is all about preparation.  More specifically, it's about careful preparation wed to a fantastic variety of options which should suit even the most finicky Java drinkers.  After selecting one of approximately 30 bean varieties, the counter person will grind just enough for a single cup.  The grounds are poured into a Turkish filter where boiling water is then added (you may also request Turkish spices to be mixed with the grounds before steeping).  Four long minutes later, the coffee is ready to be accessorized.  Whether or not you usually take cream in your coffee, at Philz it is of paramount importance to ask for the \"special cream\" which, though ostensibly a secret, consists of heavy whipping cream that has been slightly seasoned.  Seasoned with what, you ask?  I've no idea--it's a secret.  Other options include a fresh sprig of mint, soy or rice milk, honey, raw sugar, etc.  With coffee in hand, you are now free to experience all the coziness Philz has to offer--be it hunkering down in a comfy couch and peeking out from behind a copy of Gravity's Rainbow or perhaps a game of chess with a socialist is more your thing.\r\n\r\nPhilz Coffee--where coffee dreams come true (if, like me,  you have such dreams).", "author": "Justin T."}

Unfortunately, Phil was out of town when I went, so his son had to prepare my coffee (my companion had his coffee prepared by Phil's son's girlfriend, who I don't think put the same loving care into it).

Our coffee specialist was very nice, no rude attitude there.

The woman who made my coffee was extremely nice, and I watched her make the order for a very demanding homeless guy in front of me- he kept yelling at her to stir faster and she was very kind and had a lot of patience with him. The only negative was the cashier was a bit snippy- when I paid I told her I had already ordered (not sure if she would order me a second cup if I didn't tell her that)- got a sarcastic \"most people have\" in reply. Oh well- her attitude didn't live up to their reputation but wouldn't have been bad if I hadn't expected perfection from the experience. and the coffee was to die for. seriously.", "author": "Kerry L."}

Upon arriving and needing a cup of coffee, my cous took me around the corner to Philz. As seems to often be the case for newbies,  I was confused and somewhat alarmed. I can't get an iced mocha? No espresso machine? No varietals? I ordered a cup of ultimate iced, and spilled it before really getting to the point.\nOK, the next day,  i decided to stop resisting, and and emrace possibility. I walked up to the young man at the drip station, and put myself in his hands- \"make me a cup of dark roast that is going to change my life\". His face lit up, he told me I was going to be up all night thinking about the coffee he was about to make me, and I watched the magic ensue. no machine, just someone passionate and joyful about what he was doing, going for beans, grinding them, pouring water over them with panache, adding cream, and handing me a cup he was clearly so proud of, so invested in. And yes, my life, at least with respect to how I view my coffee, is changed. And now  i am back in Minneapolis, a bag of beans in hand, and some trial and error in front of me.\n\nAnd in answer to your question- 1/2 jacob's wonderbar, 1/2 red sea. with cream. Like listening to thunder in the distance while relaxing in a tub of warm chocolate (tortured simile, but great coffee anway). \n\nThanks you, kind folks at Philz. \n\nAnd btw, to the reviewer who trashed blends, as i used to do, some of the great wines of the world are blends. It is a matter of letting go of the need for contol, and trusting that you are in the hands of someone who knows something you do not.  Peace.", "author": "MJ G."}

I told her I wanted strong coffee with cream and sugar.  I asked how she would prepare the cream.  She said they shake the cream.  It's true. They actually shake the cream in the its container.  The coffee was somewhat strong but it was not hot like I would like.  I'm not use to having someone add the sugar for me.  If your coffee is not sweet enough to your liking, they would add more sugar for you.  I did not received a jolt of high like I wanted.

When I tried their coffee for the first time I didn't know how I felt. Mabee i like it maybee i don't. Its different Then it hit me. Could this be the best coffee I ever had? Can this be better than Peets? Is this better than blue bottle? Survey says ......... Yes I think so. Its amazing I never knew coffee had so many natural flavors. You can taste the sweetness even when you drink it black( well I normally drink coffee black maybe that's why its sweet to me). Although its expensive for coffee ( about 3-4 bucks a cup) its worth every cent. Their motto is one cup at a time. They will grind the coffee right in front of you after you pick one of their many blends. My  2 favorite are the medium roast silken and ambrosia.  The owner is very nice too, he will talk to you and shake your hand. Overall the staff is great.  I do have to point out that some days their coffee taste better than others, so that might depend on who is making it or the beans. But even so its still good coffee. Their coffee is either heck hecka good or good.   Also they don't make expresso dinks so blue bottle and Peets are still champions in that area.", "author": "Derrick L."}
