The rice was hard, but the spring rolls were even harder!!!

Pho is my jam and I'm trying to hit all of the places in the city to see which ones are best. Unfortunately, My Father's Kitchen is the closest Vietnamese place to my house but does not make the top of my list. The broth is so-so. Not as flavorful as most of the other places I've tried. And for the pho tai, they use the fat, wide noodles which I don't like as much as the thinner vermicelli noodles. But even when I get their pho with the thinner noodle, the dish lacks the flavor I want. The large bowl isn't that big and they don't give you a ton of meat, but they don't skimp either.

After deciding on what we wanted, I told my friend to order for us if someone comes by to serve us and I left to go use the bathroom for a couple of minutes and came out and wait a few more minutes.  A white couple comes in, sits down without being seated and asks us for our menus.   Given that we knew what we wanted for some time now, I handed them the menu that we no longer needed.  I thought \"hey restaurants don't rely on seeing who has menus to serve them right?\"  We were the only table aside from the couple next to us who needed serving, the restaurant was sparsely populated today due to rain so they were not busy.  The point is there wasn't a lot to track.  \n\nUnfortunately, the waiter comes over to the white couple's table and starts serving them.

I told him we already received our menus and I gave them over to the couple he was serving since we already decided.\n\nSo the same waitress/hostess who seated us and gave us our menus 10 minutes or more ago, came out and finally to finally take our order.

I told her I gave the couple the menu and proceeded to ask if this restaurant only serves white people because clearly we had to claw our way to give our order while the white couple behind us sat down without being shown their seats and was served a minute after.\n\nI told her #3 and #8 and she left to submit her order.\n\nI was mad but we finally got our order so I let by gone be by gone.  \n\nA minute later she came out and approached us to give us the lemon for the pho I ordered and with an angry tone she told us that this restaurant was not racist and that we were not served because we didn't have our menus despite receiving the menus from her just 10 minutes ago.  After that spewing, she stomped off into the kitchen, clearly mad that we were upset over being served after a couple who arrived after us.\n\nThis really put the nail in the coffin and what really pushed me into writing this review.  I've been to many restaurants, good, bad, terrible and received bad service but usually because the restaurant served everyone badly or because the restaurant was just so busy.  However, this restaurant was not busy and was giving good service to everyone except the 2 Asian guys.\n\nWe left the restaurant after her rant fearing there would be spit or worst in our food.", "author": "Thang T."}

Leaps and bounds above Turtle Tower. It seems many reviewers' chief complaints is that they don't serve it the way they're used to, which probably means they don't give the sprouts, basil, and hoison you often get at Pho restaurants. But I spoke with the owner and she assured me that her recipe is the way her father served it, and it's in the Northern style. So while it might be different, that doesn't mean low quality at all. It's quite the opposite. She focuses on the flavors already in the soup, and it is really apparent. The flavors feel cleaner, more distinct and robust than other Pho restaurants, that to me just taste salty and muddled. But if you feel the need to add some of the ingredients you're used to, just ask!\n\nThe owner is so passionate about what she's serving. Each bowl of soup is like a warm hug from her to you. Their care comes through in their food, but also in the customer service and decor and cleanliness of the restaurant. \n\nWatch out because the lines at lunch time are super long.

I was left with the feeling that they prefer a certain type of customer here because I noticed how those people were treated better consistently.\n\n3. If you choose to order your food to go, my advice would be to wait outside the door in front of the restaurant, instead of trying to sit down on any of the chairs they place on the opposite of their kitchen.  If you do, you will constantly have to maneuver yourself so that the servers don't bump into you as they are trying to serve the customers at the tables.

But the meal was ok at best. First, the imperial roll was really chewy. I had really great imperial rolls elsewhere and never this chewy and was wondering why. The only time I had imperial rolls this chewy was when I did take away and ate the imperial roll much later and micro it. I am not saying they micro their rolls, but whatever they are doing, it reminded me of that. Then, I had the big bowl of pho tai. I don't know the difference between their big and small because the bowl here is pretty small compared to other pho places. Also, they are supposedly Northern so they don't even give you bean sprouts or the basil to put into your soup. Just a slice of lemon and some jalepeno. The taste is just average. It's not very flavorful and I am disappointed by the really watery broth. I guess the only upside about this meal is maybe due to the less than stellar flavor, they are also not as salty like other Pho places. Maybe they are very mind-ful of salt intake due to the restaurant being near two hospital facilities. Hopefully that's it. \n\nI went after lunch rush, so service was ok.", "author": "Missy X."}

This is just a few blocks from where I used to live.There is a dearth of Pho establishments for many blocks. This one has been opened for little over a year. \n\nI really wanted to like this place.\n\nIt looks like a dive from the outside, but walking in, it has a nice, clean, simple decor, with wood tables and chairs, wood floor, and mini-spotlight track lighting. \n\nThe service is really nice, too. The son serving and the mother cooking our day of visit were sweet. \n\nThe Cha Gio (deep fried egg rolls) is very good, much lighter and crispier than most places. The Nuoc Mam (fish dipping sauce) is very sweet.\n\nThe dishes are not the plastic Chinese red and yellow designed bowls you can buy at 99 Ranch, but rather more upscale looking Dansk-like square white porcelain with raised lips and points, and the soup bowls are also a Danish modern all white, smaller and deeper than a Pho place would use. \n\nThey only have a limited menu. The Pho comes in about 6 - 8 versions, including Pho Bo Dac Biet (beef special combo) and Pho Ga Dac Biet (chicken special). The smalls are about $7 - $7.50. \n\nI didn't like the Pho, however. Perhaps it is more of a northern style, as the owner is half Chinese and half Vietnamese, and everyone working spoke Cantonese, not Vietnamese. \n\nThey use the wide, flat fettucini like rice noodle rather than the more common vermicelli type. The Bo Dac Biet meats were nice and tasty. But the Pho broth was very flat to me, more like what i would find in Chinese Won Ton Mein soup. In fact, it tasted like chicken broth to me. \n\nAlso, they served greens with the Cha Gio, but not with the Pho. Instead, they served little condiment dishes with sliced chili peppers and an orange slice? Or maybe it was tangelo? It was not sweet, but it was not lemon or lime. No sprouts, no greens. \n\nI also had to ask for Hoisin sauce, which I usually put on a condiment dish with Tung Ot Sriracha, and dip my beef into so as not to spoil the broth. \n\nSo if you can't make up your mind between a bowl of Chinese noodle and Vietnamese noodle soups, come here and you will get a little of  both. \n\nPS - they really cater to the lunch and UCSF crowd, because they are only open from 9am to 7pm.

The decor is simple . . .just black and white photographs of Vietnamese life (people in rice paddy hats, working the land and fishing).  The menu was simple as well.  Just a few offerings. . . Vietnamese comfort food is the tag line.  We felt comforted, indeed :)\n\nIt was a bit on the pricey side, but we quickly became accustomed to everything being on the pricey side in San Francisco. \n\nI got to chat with the owner/manager very briefly and discovered that it was run by people from Northern Vietnam (judging by her accent and formal use of the language-the South of Vietnam is full of asian hilbillies like yours truly ;P).  This explained the subtle differences in the way the pho tasted and how it was served.\n\nWhen you walk in, you are immediately engulfed by the aromatic blanket of the pho broth.  Because I am a self-proclaimed noodle expert, I could tell right away that the broth was not beef-based.  Or if it was, the flavors had not seeped enough.  Maybe we were there too early in the day, it wasn't even 10am yet :)\n\nI guessed that it may have been a chicken-based broth, not that there is anything wrong with that.  You tend to get a clearer and cleaner taste when you use chicken bones, but I always prefer to use beef bones.  Nonetheless, the soup hit the spot.  Northerners tend not to eat bean sprouts with their pho (which is just fine with this non-eating bean sprout yellow girl).\n\nWe also had their imperial egg rolls.  Soooo delicious!  Their nuoc mam sauce tasted light, fresh and citrusy, not nearly as hot enough, but you can always modify to your taste.\n\nThe cafe sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk) was creamy goodness, but I don't think it was quite strong enough, not like the cafe du monde coffee that is brewed here in Houston's Vietnamese noodle shops.\n\nThe best part:  The pho noodles are made and delivered fresh daily by a shop down the street! I asked the server about them because they were so different (from the traditional banh pho noodle). You could tell by texture and taste that they were special.  Bigger, wider noodles that were perfect for this soup!\n\nDon't miss My Father's Kitchen when you are in the Fillmore/Divisadero area of San Francisco!", "author": "Cuc L."}

Comparing this to a lot of other pho places in inner richmond their portion is kind of poor with that kind of price. I agree with some yelpers here that imperial rolls were about the same price as the pho was kind of lame.

The broth was fairly flat and needed fish sauce to give it the kick it deserved (which they strangely had on the table...?). I don't mean dipping nuoc mam (fish sauce) but the kind that you have in a gigantic bottle in the kitchen. \n\nIt's made with the traditional garnishes, but the lack of sides (lime, bean sprouts, etc.) was a big no-no to me. No matter what, if you're serving pho, you should have the traditional side garnishes. I realize this place serves a multitude of Vietnamese dishes, but not having the chopsticks, spoons, dipping saucers, hoison sauce, sriracha, and chili paste on the table made this place feel extremely unfamiliar. In general, there wasn't a Vietnamese feel to this place at all.\n\nThe wait staff were at least polite and attentive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-28", "description": "The first thing you have to understand when you go into My Father's Kitchen is that it's NORTHERN Vietnamese cuisine, which is different from the Southern Vietnamese cooking that is 99% of the viet places you find in the city. My mother being from Saigon in the south, I'm biased towards Southern cuisine which everyone agrees (including Northerners, much to their distaste) is much more rich, flavorful, and generally sweeter of a palate. The northerners pride themselves on a simple (and in my opinion, bland) palate, much like the Japanese. This is why you don't find the extra condiments on the table at Northern Vietnamese restaurants. They don't believe in it. It's just something you have to come to terms with and you cannot expect otherwise without sounding like a demanding and ignorant tourist.\n\nThat being said, My Father's Kitchen rocked the pho. It came with the signature northern style wide noodle, and the broth was actually very well done and flavorful, which is actually a departure from the old school Vietnamese diaspora in SF. Ever been to Turtle Castle in the Tenderloin? Their pho is practically vegetable broth. Tasteless. No condiments, overcooked beef, very northern viet. But the pho at father's kitchen was very good and far from bland. There was tender loving care in that bowl of noodle soup, and I was jealous of the beautiful woman across from me consuming it. \n\nI was having the Bun Cha Thit Nuoung, which is basically pork meatballs and grilled pork in a sweet vinegary fishsauce filled bowl served alongside fresh mint, lettuce, and thin rice vermicelli, and that was also great. This dish is very northern, and I had it all the time while I studied abroad in Hanoi. They nailed it. Actually, they did it much better than I remember, which is usually the case because it's hard to match the quality of meat we have here in California compared to the overworked farm cattle they serve on the streets of Vietnam. \n\nThe service was very nice, and the waiters attentive and chummy.

Broth is absolutely superb, and while the meat isn't sliced as thin as I would like, the plentiful amounts they provide more than makes up for it's thick-sliced nature.  I typically enjoy thin rice noodles moreso than the flat variety, but MFK's flat noodles are excellent.\n\n-Service: 3/5 stars\nThe older woman with short hair is very solid (She's really not old, likely 30-something, but she's definatly got a few years on most of the servers), I'm assuming she is the daughter of the father of which the kitchen belongs to.  Seems like a family joint, where friends and family of the owner appear to be running the show.  Service doesn't suck, but it certainly has room for improvement.\n\n-Decor: 4/5 stars\nGotta be the cleanest Pho place i've been to.  Far less grungy than all the other 'authentic' vietnamese pho spots, which I originally held against MFK, but soon conceded that filth is not a neccessary ingreiant for my soup to be delicious.\n\n\nOTHER NOTES:\n\n-WTF? no hoison or soy sauce on the tables.  Fear not, just ask and they'll bring some out.\n-If someone your with needs immediate medical attention, there's usually at least five customers with MD's dining alongside of you.\n-Place gets real busy between 11:30am and 1:00pm for the UCSF lunch rush\n-EARLY DINNER ONLY (closes at 7pm) and CLOSED ON SUNDAYS!", "author": "Kyle S."}

I should stop my review here but I'm going to continue...\n\nWe split the bun (vermicelli) with imperial rolls & the satay chicken plate.\n The chicken was not very generous like other Vietnamese places but Unlike other Vietnamese places, it was absolutely delicious. \nEach plate came with a ton of greens. I actually made lettuce wraps with my vermicelli, added some cilantro & thai basil. The only thing that dish was missing was some type of meat.  The Imperial rolls were delicious, again different than what you're used to. I swear I sensed a little bit of cinnamon, dessert-like like flakiness, almost tasted baked v.fried....\n\nOur waitress was very pleasant; she's 1 of those people you would just go back to see again for some reason. Lovely personality :)\nThe truth be told, the day we went in was the last spot of our adventure for my friends birthday. We started the day strolling Golden Gate Park, ended up at Frankies for beer(s) & splitting a bomb Brambory, then saw a happy hour sign on the way to get foot massages so we had to go in and get happy right? We then had fantastic foot massages at UtoEpia and decided to wind down with a light dinner. We got our bodies beat by Asian uncertified massage therapists & arrived at this quaint restaurant pretty zombie- like. \n\nMy Fathers Kitchen has an extremely simple menu which was heaven for us considering what we were working with. Again don't expect it to be the 8 page long typical Vietnamese menu. I think there may have been 12-14 options total & that includes about 5 appetizers, 3pho options, 2 rice plates,  2 vermicelli options, & coffee/tea. I have no idea if they have beer or wine we were not needing anymore etOH.\n\nThey deserve 5 stars: food, service, quality & cleanliness all can be found here. And if you read my reviews you could see that I am a little picky. Not nit picky just picky. Some even more gently consider it being selective.  It's a good thing especially when there so many options and I'm not just talking about food.\n\n If I worked close by, I would definitely be here more often.

Tip: Don't have any because you're sure to be disappointed.  The place is cute and has nice ambience. I went there for lunch with my co-workers and it felt good to be there. It's on the small side, and it's super buzzing with all the people who work nearby.  So it's hard to find a table if it's busy. Uh Duh.\nMy co-workers ordered pho, one chicken and one beef. I ordered a rice plate (grilled chicken with satay sauce over rice). It came, it looked exactly like I DID NOT expect. Not bad, just not what I expected. I need to practice what I preach. One thing I can say about my dish is that the chicken was very tender. I liked the tenderness of the meat, nice and soft. Well pounded. The flavor was... eh. I was NOT impressed and I didn't even eat a fourth of my food. Someone would have liked it (my husband ate it at midnight for he had the munchies), but not moi, said Sharon. The satay sauce it came with didn't even help. It was bland and I even added the hot chili sauce to it. Nada. It kicked it up a notch but the notch was tiny. Very dissatisfied with my lunch, all I wanted was to stuff my face with some sinful ass gelato, to kill a memory of a bad lunch. My co-workers loved their pho, so don't worry, I hope I didn't totally bash them for your own experience. Oh wait, their fresh spring rolls were ok, the peanut sauce it came with was SUPER BLAND.

Its probably cooked by Chinese cooks. I did get very thirsty after it because of the MSG.\n\nAt other places, I always order a small one and I can barely finish it.

The broth leftover is enough to make a new blow!!!! I do not spend more money just to drink MSG!!!!\n\nI was there around 4pm. It got dark early because of the winter. However, no lights were on. Other customers and I were eating in the dark!!!!!!!!! The only light we got was from the kitchen. I told a waitress about it and she said the lights were broken and they get broke every 3 days and there is nothing she can do about!!!!! WHT? then get better light system! I wonder how customers can eat their dinner!\n\nThe most annoying thing was the sound from the waitress boot/heel. She walked around making noises from her boot on the hardwood floor. Hello its working and its not a fashion show! the boot may look pretty on you but it makes annoying noise!\n\nOverall, I can find this kind of MSG Pho anywhere but at least I dont have to eat in the dark with annoying noises!

Not a big issue, but not a great start either. The decor of the place looked pretty nice so we decided to stay. We each ordered a rice plate and they came out fairly quickly, so no complaints there. \n\nThe satay chicken rice plate was decent but I thought that the five spice chicken plate was pretty good. As my friend was picking through the leaves of lettuce that came with her five spice chicken plate, she noticed a dark colored chunk of something. She just placed it aside, but decided to closely inspect the rest of her lettuce. And it is at that point where she found a CATERPILLAR crawling around on her lettuce. WTF! \n\nOne of the waitresses noticed our puzzled faces and so she came over to check on us. We notified her of the issue quietly, but she just responded, \"O! There's a caterpillar on your lettuce? That's a good thing!\" Uh.. maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Either way, my friend no longer felt like eating her lettuce. Then another waiter came over and picked up the lettuce that my friend had placed on the side of her plate and muttered a very insincere, sorry. Beyond that, there was nothing that was done to make up for it. \n\nThe rest of us stopped eating, since we didn't feel quite as hungry anymore and paid quickly (the full bill) so that we could leave.

Being Vietnamese, I know what good pho actually taste like and I'm not that picky when it comes to it.  If my mother was with me, she would have it sent back. \n\nThe broth was SO BLAND that I had to add a bunch of sriracha sauce and it pretty much turned into a spicy soup that had no flavor but the sriracha itself. \n\nWhat really shocks me about this place is that I can hear the cooks speaking Vietnamese to each other.  I know they don't eat this crap at home so WHY?!@!!!!  \n\nAnd then there's the price tag.  $6.5 for goi cuon (spring rolls)??????????  That is fcking bizarre.  How can two spring rolls cost a dollar less than the pho itself?  They must put crack in there and bad crack at that. \n\nI finished my soup to be polite but I was pissed at how bad it was because I know it could be better especially coming from Vietnamese chefs.  The chefs know the crowd they cater to and don't give jack shiz about quality cuz you people don't know what a good bowl of pho is!!

I have a hard time paying a lot of money for Vietnamese food since it is one of the cheaper cuisines and my in-laws make it for free... so I would say that this place could lower their prices a bit.\n\nThe beef pho was nice.  I didn't taste any MSG, just clean flavors but if you are looking for meat... keep looking.  I want to say that my pho had 2 pieces maybe 3 pieces at the very most of small rare beef, which if you know anything about Vietnamese food is ludicrous... especially for $7.50 a bowl.  Also, there was no hoisin sauce in sight, I had to ask... um, really?\n\nI will come here again when I have my next doctor's appointment at Mt.

Chewy, thick, warm, and actually better than Saigon style pho. It's also ridiculously filling. The broth was... meh. It's delicate, but it wasn't very meaty or seasoned. And again, not sure if that's the style or the restaurant. Cuts of meat were okay. Few slices here and there. Nothing spectacular.

They have a great concept with the blue mountain drip coffee and the pastry in the front.  I think if ran correctly, the coffee should yield a higher return.  Menu is very simple.

Nothing better than homemade broth slow cooked over night and rice noodles that slither down with bites of basil, mint, bean sprouts, and meat of choice (or tofu for veggie lovers). Its the way you prepare the soup with all these fixings and sauces (chili + hoisin) with a squeeze of lime that make this mouth watering noodle soup so simple yet delicious. \n\nHaving that said, My Father's Kitchen owner must have used their non-Vietnamese father's recipe. The broth is bland/flavorless and might as well been 1 part can of chicken broth and 2 parts boiled water. The noodles were fine and the veggies were fresh. But come on.. put a little bit more effort if I'm going to support your $7 pho, instead of some other local joint in Little Saigon (not to say SF has aplethora of pho restaurants). \n\nI must admit this place has a nice clean contemporary ambiance: dark wooden tables, warm colored walls, and Blue Bottle drip coffee.

I love pho so the thought of having a good pho restaurant in the hood excites me very much.\n\nI get there and right away I can tell it's not your traditional pho restaurant. Just a little too clean in here. Too many non-asians in here. White people serving the food. These are clear signs this is not your traditional pho restaurant.\n\nBut whatever. I sit down and order the cha gio (imperial rolls) which is the staple app for Vietnamese restaurants and try to order the pho with everything in it (even though they didn't have tendon or the beef balls) but they were out of flank steak. OK whatevers. Cha gio was good. Pho comes out and it's the thick wide noodles. Not the traditional vermicelli style I like. Broth is just ok. Wish it was more flavorful. Meat is good. So then we ask for bean sprouts and basil. They don't have bean sprouts. Really? You serve pho but no bean sprouts. Then they bring us a plate of mint. Not basil. Mint. And no hoisin sauce on the table. Service was a little frantic as we were helped by three somewhat confused servers.\n\nOK, I realize they're trying to do something different here. I realize they're not trying to be like every other traditional pho restaurant. And they're definitely trying to cater to a different audience. Unfortunately I'm not part of that different audience. I like my pho the traditional way. And get some servers that know the difference between basil and mint.

Now if I worked down the street from Soop in Berkeley, I'd be there in a heartbeat.  But with a bridge toll and 16 miles between us, when I crave soup during the lunching hour, I get pho.  I've been to this place twice now and it's an interesting place, definitely not a hole in the wall Asian restaurant.  The inside is very clean, and Pottery Barn-ish.  The servers are nice, and are ... gasp, not Asian?  This is definitely not your typical pho place.  I think they hit the \"modern Vietnamese\" theme spot on.  \n\nAs for the pho?  Prices are decent - $7-$8 for a small pot of pho ... which in my opinion, is not very small.  The pho stock is not too greasy or heavy (no big oil globs here!) which is a plus but it also means that it can be very bland.  The chicken and steak are definitely of higher quality here than at your typical pho place but the chicken was served a little overcooked and the meat was bland too.

Only been eating one meal a day. Not because I am trying to starve myself before my vacation soon, but just been drinking more alcohol than anything. I forget to eat!\n\nMy first real meal for the day came from this place I found as I was walking back from a massage not too far from this place. I found it to be very 'clean' for an Asian eatery (if you know what I mean!!) The only other places I know that are this clean and unique are Anna Mandera & Tommy Toys! As I looked at the menu by the window, I quickly glanced at the guy eating ph\u00f4 by it and noticed he had just finished the whole thing! I peaked to see what kind of action I was going to get in. I saw an Asian lady resting her one leg on a seat, some Pac Heights moms that just picked their kids from school, and some edgy dudes from the block! I said to myself \"OK\" let me try this place..I'm a sucker for Vietnamese food. \n\nAt first, the waitress is also the hostess. Basically, it's a one person place. She was taking an order from a dude. As I looked around the place, the decor reminds me that of Chilango on Church St. I waited patiently for her to say hello. Five minutes later, she notices I'm standing right there. I asked for a table, she said \"anywhere\". I sat down and immediately grabbed a menu. Without a miss, I always make sure they have fresh spring rolls. As I skimmed through the menu really quickly, it's a very plain and simple menu. Not too many options. I wished they had shaken beef as part of their menu. It's one of my favorite dishes. Where's the beef!!!????\n\nSo, I ended ordering the spring rolls and the five spice chicken with vermicelli noodles. I did notice that the prices are more expensive than other Vietnamese places. But I was already there. \n\nMy impression of the spring rolls, very clean!!! I will say this, I have tried this appetizer in every Vietnamese restaurant I can think of. I have NEVER EVER tried a peanut sauce like that! It blew my mind how good it was. It was very creamy and flavorful. The peanut sauce in other places I guess use stale peanuts or recycled from other tables. YES! I said it! Don't act coy on me!!!! If you just dip dip, you know they use it over!\n\nAs far as the five spice chicken vermicelli plate. It was very well presented. The noodles were on the side along with some greens. A lot of mint and basil...Didn't know what to do with that much. The chicken and sausage had a lot of flavor. I couldn't complain.\n\nOverall, I see that a lot of Yelpers did not have a good experience with the ph\u00f4. My spring rolls and chicken was good. Although I only gave them 3 stars, people who know me know that I rate these places on service  more so than the food. Yes, the food has to be consistent, but you're gonna eat it anyways!!!

Asked if they made it but was told that they bought it.  They also did not serve the normal plate of condiments -- basil, bean sprouts, lime and jalepeno pepper slices..  Only got lime and jalapeno slices, which I thought was \"cheap\" considering that a bowl of pho here costs a little more than at other Vietnamese restaurants that I've been to.\n\nThe pho was just ok.  There wasn't that much steak and there weren't that many noodles.  So, all in all, I'd have to say that it wasn't that \"bad\" but I've  definitely experienced better.  Hence, the 2 star rating.  \n\nDon't think I'll eat here again and, if I'm in the area for lunch again, I would probably choose to eat at the Sugar Bowl in the Kaiser bldg on Geary instead, which isn't anything to write home about but at least gives you a better value for your $.", "author": "Martin C."}

Walking into the restaurant, I was happy with the simple and clean decor.  I was excited to try the chicken noodle soup special......especially, because it has the intestines.  \n\nI started with the Vietnamese iced coffee.  The waitress we had brought one with condense milk, after asking me twice what I wanted.  I got my pho and it was a bit more oily than what i am used to.  It tasted okay, not bad, but not good either.  Also, I'm sad that there was no hoisin sauce.  It would have tasted better if i was able to have it to dip my meat with.  I understand that it is northern style pho, but it would benefit the restaurant more if customers were given that option.  I'm pretty sure there is hoisin somewhere in the back of the kitchen.  I tried asking for it, but the server had no idea what hoisin sauce is.\n\nAs for the service....I guess you can't blame people who never served.  As for business owners, I suggest hiring servers with actual serving experience.  The server I got looked completely lost and clueless.  She barely speaks any English.  While I was there, I saw one table trying to get the servers' attention for a few times and was completely ignored.  One of the girls ended up going up to the counter.  Another table tried to waved someone down for their check for about 10 minutes and was not acknowledged until a waiting customer told the guy at the counter.  It is important for a new restaurant to well staffed....especially since your servers are the face of the restaurant.  They should be able to multi-tasks and be alert.

As a fan of NO msg and healthier options to dining out (I am a cancer survivor) I really appreciated that the pho didn't have any msg or other additives.  I had the number 7 large and it was very good!  It was filling too- I couldn't finish it.  But I always get the large size with phos  since I love soup.  Anyways, the fresh spring rolls are good too.  I don't like peanuts in general but I did try the peanut sauce that came with the spring rolls and it tasted very clean with no unnecessary additives.  The ONLY reason I didn't give it five stars is because although it's in an ideal location (across the street from UCSF on Divisadero) for hospital employees etc. - that's exactly why I didn't like the location.  It was super crowded and we had to wait for a table.  The parking was tough too.  For me, pho is a no fuss no muss comfort food so when I go to eat pho, I go to RELAX and a neighborhood pho place usually makes me feel that way.  But this place was crowded and I almost felt under-dressed b/c I was wearing sweats and a cap with minimal makeup (hey even models have days off).  But overall WONDERFUL four stars!

Now that I live here, I'm on the lookout for the most flavorful broth and i can get and the tenderest meat I can find.  While this isn't the best pho I've ever had, it was really, really quite nice: I liked the generous portion of noodles, I thought the quality of the beef cuts was high, and I thought the spices were just right. I tend to like a lot of heat, so I dosed the broth with fish sauce and sriracha, but it didn't need it: this was really tasty stuff.  Since the broth is critical--and, to some, the whole point--I was thrilled to eat here. I also love that they have the shredded papaya salad on the menu; that's one of my favorite dishes, and I will certainly have it next time I'm in the area.\n\nThis was a nice place to grab lunch on a chilly summer SF day.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-02-27", "description": "Does any restaurant in San Francisco serve decent pho without MSG? I haven't found one, but I keep searching, because several people in my work group have serious reactions to MSG and absolutely cannot eat it, as in, zero amount.\n\n(I realize there are many people who doubt that the \"Chinese restaurant syndrome\" is real; I also realize that the syndrome has not been scientifically proven. That said, I would refer doubters to the work of such cutting-edge doctors as Timothy Smith MD of Sebastopol, one of the best physicians and health researchers in the U.S. today, author of \"Renewal\" [1998], who, on pps. 142-143 of that book, lays out a solid case against this junk that inundates our food. [Among other things, Smith says that a pregnant woman shouldn't touch MSG with a 10-foot-pole; the risk of birth defects is too high.] I would also refer doubters to the tales of explosive diarrhea, headache, numbness and nausea told by members of my work group.)\n\nSo, anyway, in my never-ending quest to find a decent pho place with no MSG I called My Father's Kitchen and spoke to Kelly, a server. I asked, \"Does your pho have MSG?\" She replied with great enthusiasm, \"No!\"\n\n\"Absolutely none?\" \"None!\" \"You're 100 percent sure?\" \"110 percent!\"\n\nI was ecstatic! My work group had scheduled an evening session for later that week and I had promised I would bring pho with no MSG. Everyone in my group was jazzed. This was an extremely important planning meeting; we had a lot of work to do; we needed the evening to go well; we had scheduled the meeting to the minute; great pho with no MSG would contribute significantly to our success.\n\nI made a trek to My Father's, walked in, and asked the guy behind the counter, \"You don't have any MSG in your pho, right? Kelly told me that. I'm really happy about that!\" Answer: \"Well, we do have MSG. We don't actually ADD any but there's some in there.\" I wasn't clear how this worked - I gathered it had to do with the ingredients that they got from a supplier, perhaps? - in any event, I was crushed. Even a tiny amount is a no-go for people who are sensitive to it. My work group was meeting in 15 minutes, they were waiting for their pho. (I will add, two women in my group are pregnant.)\n\nI ordered some pho for the four people in my group who are OK with MSG and resigned myself to finding some other kind of food someplace else for the other four people - I had no idea where to look in that neighborhood - but, well, I'd find someplace eventually, which would cause me to be late and keep everyone waiting. Kelly came over while I was waiting. She had been misinformed by restaurant management. She apologized, kind of. I expressed my concerns in frank terms. She replied, \"You don't need to be upset! It's OK! It's OK!\" Well, no, it was not OK, no matter how much Kelly wished it be OK. My work group's session, our most important meeting of the month, had been seriously messed up by her failure to be a professional about her work, by her failure to learn what was in the food she served people, which I take to be a primary responsibility of a good waitperson who's actually interested in helping people enjoy their food and preserve their health. (How many people, I wonder, has she managed to lead astray on this topic? How many pregnant women? I shudder to think.)\n\nI suggested to the guy behind the counter that I deserved a discount. At first he said he wouldn't do it (\"I'm not authorized to do that\") but he eventually came through with 25 percent off. He did not say \"thank you\" when the transaction was completed; he stared at me like I was the customer from hell. Maybe to him I was.\n\nI did not get the impression that he took my concerns seriously. I believe that a really well-run restaurant that cares about its customers, that wants to survive, that wants to prosper, that wants to become great rather than continue forever as a hole-in-the-wall on Divisadero, would train its staff like crazy about every possible problem and issue, including MSG, which is one of the most long-standing, significant health issues confronted by Asian restaurants today, with enormous liability issues attached to it. By this criteria, My Father's Kitchen does not seem to me to be a well-run restaurant.\n\nBy the way, regarding liability issues, the staff of My Father's Restaurant would be smart to familiarize itself with the San Francisco Examiner issue of February 28, 2013, the column by attorney Christopher B. Dolan, \"Foodborne Allergens, Harm, Could Be the Cause for a Lawsuit.\" I would especially refer them to paragraph 2 where the writer describes a lawsuit titled Livingston vs. Marie Callendar's. This case involved MSG. Marie Callendar's wrote a very big check to Livingston.", "author": "R. F."}

Went during lunch and wasn't that busy but the waiters/ staff decided to seat us in the very corner towards the back while other tables for 3 were open.  I must say that the table layout is HORRIBLE in this place.  You can barely fit though some of the tables.  To get to my seat, i had to squeeze between a space roughly 6 inches (sparingly) between two tablest.  I'm not a big guy but it was still difficult getting to my destination.

Three women who were having lunch had the same issue who were seated right next to us a few minutes after.  \n\nFood was alright, but big minuses on the price and the service.  We got our drinks but not once during our entire hour meal were we offered more water.  The only time we were asked how our meal was was towards the end when a friend signaled a worker to get a togo container.  The price for a Vermicelli bowl is ridiculous, 11 dollars without an eggroll, just the meat, noodles and greens.  You can easily get something 4 dollars cheaper in the inner richmond with more food.  Price is not a huge issue but if I'm going to be paying more for an \"upscale\" vietnamese restaurant the least I could have is someone checking in to give me some water.

Honestly, the broth alone should win an award. The chicken pho and mixed chicken and beef pho use the chicken broth, but the beef pho uses beef broth.\n\nI read some of the reviews prior to reading this, and feel the need to respond:\n \nFirst, I am completely baffled by the complaints of \"bland.\" What do you think chicken broth is supposed to taste like? I don't know what you're used to, but this is the pure stuff -- home made, no chemicals, MSG, etc. \n\nSecond, I, too, was initially confused by the lack of sprouts, mint, etc., but I learned (by asking) that the family is northern Vietnamese, and this simpler version is their tradition. The family is very conscious of keeping to their traditions. (I know this, because my friend asked if they could change the menu to include vegetables in the pho, and they apologized, but said they felt very strongly about keeping to their cultural roots.)\n\nThird, the last thing this place impresses me as is \"trendy.\" Just because the front of house doesn't consist of non-English speaking immigrants, doesn't make it trendy, folks! They are just nice people, who try to get to know their regulars, and are staffing a restaurant as best they know how. \n\nFinal comments -- this is inexpensive, simple and delicious.

Sounded perfect, so we went in.\n\nThe atmosphere was nice enough--cozy without being overly cramped (although I can imagine it could get that way with a bigger crowd)--with good natural light coming in from the windows facing Divisadero St. We were seated and given menus promptly, which was consistent with the overall good service. The food itself was another story.\n\nFirst, the fresh vegetarian spring roll appetizer was both tasteless almost to the point of being non-existent, and wildly overpriced for what you get. There was almost none of the mint or cilantro that gives good rolls their zing, and instead of the fresh, firm tofu strips that are standard in most places, we found deep-fried strips that only accentuated the lack of flavor. Moreover, the dipping sauce was overly sweet and cloying. It's okay to try something other than a standard peanut-based sauce, but if you do, it should be something equally savory designed to pick up the other flavors of the spring roll, not hide the fact that there's no flavor to begin with.\n\nWe both ordered chicken pho as our main course, and it was more of the same issue with blandness--and something worse. The first thing we noticed in the broth was an undertone of pork flavor, an indication that the pots used to cook the broth for the different phos were being used interchangeably, a major culinary faux pas. Then we realized that we hadn't been given a plate of the usual accompaniments: basil, cilantro, bean sprouts, and fresh jalape\u00f1o peppers. When we asked about it, our server said they didn't offer those items except for the peppers. However, if we'd like, they could give us some mint, a small plate of which we gladly accepted. That helped give the soup a bit more flavor (and conceal the pork scent), but imagine our chagrined surprise when our check arrived...with a separate two-dollar charge for the mint!\n\nA lot of folks are going to be fine with this quality of Vietnamese food; the rest of us will stick to known better places next time around.", "author": "Bill B."}

I'm already craving the ga satay again today! The service was really quick, which was important, since I only had about an hour to get in and out.

Really no place to stand when waiting for a table and the hostess suggested we have a seat in the hallway of the restaurant, which was 3 chairs up against the wall which faced directly in front of tables with people eating their lunch, which was quite awkward to say the least. The wait was about 15 minutes and then we were lead to a 2 seat table that was in between 2 other parties having lunch. So in order for me to get to my seat the woman sitting at the table next to me needed to stop eating her lunch and get out of her seat to let me into my seat! ummm.... yeah HELL NO! I haven't even eaten yet and it has been an ordeal! So, lets fast forward to the food...... My chicken Pho came to the table looked appetizing and it was tasty, I feel I have had better. The one thing I couldn't stand was the couple sitting next to me ( so close I might add) their hot water from their Pho dishes were splatting on my bare skin when they were sipping their noodle dishes! ummm yeah double HELL NO!

As somebody who was born in Los Angeles, raised in San Jose for over 30 years, I think I know authentic Pho/Vietnamese food when I see one. Of course this is San Francisco, I'm not on a mission to find one. It's almost like going to Del Taco to eat some good Hamburgers. But My Father's Kitchen, though, is the Chevy's of nammer's food. This establishment reminds me why I gave up on looking for good authentic Viet food in the first place. They don't even have hoison sauce on the table. Even if it's northern style, you still have all the other pointless condiments sitting there. I went here for lunch with some coworkers and they were so stoked to try a new Vietnamese restaurant that just opened on Divis. This is probably the first Vietnamese restaurant I've been to where there are no Asians working here. It's kind of like a lot of Latino-ran Japanese restaurants I see in San Bruno. I mean as long as the food is good, I don't mind who works here. Unfortunately, this place should be ashamed to be called Vietnamese food.... it should be Vietnamese-influenced dishes... definitely nothing close to comfort food as they claim. The Pho here uses some pretty thick noodles and the broth is not tasty at all. I don't think people realize how long you need to cook good broth without adding MSG to it. The Spring rolls are.... meh... I make it better at home. They got it right on the drip coffee. The ambience is decent, and it's very clean. But ya'll still didn't win me over. I would've put that extra star up there but when I have to go and ask for the bill.... then bring the payment to them, it shows they are not willing to compensate for the lack of authenticity. I have a new name for this place. It's My Father's Kitchen Where I Wasn't Allow to Go In So I Just Sat at The Dining Table To Eat.  I think that's more appropriate.", "author": "Anthony N."}

When I order bun, I expect it to be, at the most, $8, but here it was $11. My boyfriend was not given chopsticks or a fork and I couldn't get anybody's attention, so he had to use my fork (I got both). This would have been forgivable, but they had to go through various checks when we went up to pay before finding the correct one because they were so disorganized. Although the food was above average, it was not worth it.", "author": "Hannah B."}

Reality is that it was the most tasteless Pho I've ever eaten. I have had better Pho at many hole in the wall places than at this newly redone cramped seating place. The prices and the quantity are a joke. The only thing gong for them is they serve Blue Bottle coffee. All my coworkers have tried it and none feel it's worthy of visit number 2.", "author": "sylvia k."}
