Dessert was the special  FBI Fried Bananas & Ice Cream. Go with the Buka (coconut) and experience a heavenly finish to a delicious meal.\n\nThe service was outstanding, and since we sat right next to the kitchen, our food was piping hot, the way it's supposed to be.\n\nWe also noticed that about every five minutes, there was some sort of food delivery service coming in the back door to pick up an order. It was like a revolving door. Obviously people know this place is Great.\n\nGood Job, Ben Thai!!", "author": "Doug C."}

The flavors were all great and everything came out hot, but our meals didn't come out together. The Thai iced tea was a bit watery and when they get busy it's noisy and hard to find your server. \n\nI would come back again, the food was good and the problems minor.

My husband and I were recently in Thailand and after a few months of detox, we started having cravings for the delicious cuisine again. We had some pretty high standards after spending so much time in Thailand, but we were pleasantly surprised because every dish we tried here brought us back to the local restaurants abroad. All of the flavors were on point, and I was really happy that they had Khao Soi since not a lot of Thai places up here have that Northern Thailand dish. \n\nOne thing I wasn't the biggest fan of was their prices. Not trying to compare it to prices in Thailand of course, but just compared to restaurants in South Bay, this place was on the pricier end for some of their items (Khao Soi & Thai Iced Tea).. but I guess given its location and average Thai food prices in the area, this place is pretty average (so I guess my general advice is to not eat Thai food in SF if you had a choice... haha). My husband and I ordered their Murder Wings ($9.50), Khao Soi ($16), Crab Fried Rice ($16), Pa-nang ($13), BBQ Pork ($13), and Thai Iced Tea ($4.... FOUR DOLLARS FOR A THAI ICED TEA). If I do decide to splurge on Thai food and go back, I'd get the Khao Soi, Crab Fried Rice, and BBQ Pork again. \n\nOk, I'm docking off a star because of their service. 1) They were not the fastest. We were the only other party there besides someone finishing up their food, and our dishes still came out pretty slowly. Can't imagine how it is with a full house. 2) We went at 5:30PM (during their happy hour) so their appetizers were $1 off, but when we got the check they didn't apply the discount. Not sure if this was because we also applied the 50% off non-alcoholic beverages yelp check-in coupon to our Thai tea's, but it's more so the principle that I'm annoyed with because they didn't give us a heads up... We didn't notice until after they swiped our card so we let it go but just FYI.. pay attention to your bill.. they sneaky.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

Comfortable restaurant, with cool dragon art and two separate rooms for diners.\n\nWe got the pad thai, which had slightly thicker noodles than most places. Nice wok hei, and it was a hefty portion.\n\nWe also got one of the specials, which was listed as a Chinese dish made by the owner's mom. Big chunks of pork belly stewed with pickled veggies, lettuce, and hard boiled eggs. Very tasty and we didn't even finish. Doesn't come with rice, so we got an order of white to accompany and it came shaped like a heart.\n\nBen Thai seems big on the flourishes, and my husband's Thai ice coffee came with a paper rose on the straw.\n\nCute place, and definitely would return.

We walked in and was seated by a friendly server. After looking through the menu, my friends and I went a little crazy and ordered a bunch of food! We ordered the Golden Bags, Tom Yum Soup with Prawns, Beef Pad Kee Mao, Beef Pad Thai, Beef Panang Curry, and Mango & Sweet Sticky Rice. We also ordered Thai Iced Tea, Thai Iced Coffee, and alcoholic beverages. We were probably thinking, \"Go hard or go home!\" \n\nThe Tom Yum Soup came out first and our server put them in our bowls for us. My friends and I loved it! The Golden Bags came out shortly after and looked awesome. It looked awesome, but I felt as if it was stuffed with too much potatoes and too little chicken. Nothing too special.\n\nThe entrees took a bit while to come out, but we were hanging out with our drinks and chit chatting. When the food came out, our server asked us if we wanted rice with our Panang Curry. It usually comes with rice at other Thai restaurants, so that was an automatic yes from us. He came out with 3 bowls, but that came at a price! We ordered a lot of food, so I wished he took that into consideration (it's okay, it's our last dinner in SF). All entrees were delicious with the perfect amount of heat! After we were completely stuffed, our server took our plates and asked us if we were ready for our Mango & Sweet Sticky Rice. This took a while to come out like our entrees, but the presentation made up for it! The rice was in the middle with thin slices of mango shaped like a heart around it!\n\nOverall, this place is a solid Thai restaurant in San Francisco! Thai food is normally a bit more on the pricey side, but you will always leave stuffed and satisfied!", "author": "Anthony N."}

The service was okay. A tad slow but not horribly slow. \n\nThe Thai iced tea wasn't as strong in flavor as I like it to be. My companion ordered some kind of chicken skewers and they were mediocre. Again, not terrible, but I had one and wasn't dying for another. \n\nI ordered the Crispy Duck Curry for my entree and I was a little disappointed. The reviews here on Yelp really hyped me up for this dish but it was meh. The duck was very fatty and I really didn't think the skin was that crispy. I also didn't care much for their red curry- I wanted spicier and more of a depth of flavor there. \n\nI had the mango and sticky rice for dessert. That was very yummy.

A check-in on yelp gets you half off on a homemade drink. I'm guessing soda isn't included in that category. But probably thai tea and we got the ginger lemonade. It's very ginger-y, like burn your throat gingery. We had to water it down with the tap water. So be forewarned. I got the pad see ew with pork and the bf got the prao-grao fried rice with beef. I was starving when I there and the portions didn't look that big. But I was stuffed halfway through and ended up taking the rest home for lunch the next day. My pad see ew was simple but cooked well. The noodles are on the thinner side, from what I'm normally used to.  But it was still good. And the amount of pork they put in there was proportional to the noodles. Only like 5-6 stalks of broccoli though. I could've used more. I only had a bite of the fried rice. It was a little too spicy for me. But the bf liked it and scarfed it all down. Both dishes were about $12-13. A little more than I want to pay but it is SF.

They also had a deal on Yelp where you get a housemade drink for 50% off and I got the Thai Iced Tea.

Since bugs/mealworms are something you're more likely to find in Thailand than in the US, I thought maybe that meant the food here would be more authentic, but it was pretty much your standard Thai restaurant.\n\nThe menu isn't as extensive as more authentic Thai spots, comprising mostly of your typical dishes, but at least that makes it less overwhelming to order. They do have some \"family favorites\" though, which intrigued me more, like oxtail soup, squid, khao soi and duck noodle soup.\n\nMy friends and I got the Mealworms to share as an appetizer and I ended up going with the Oxtail Soup (American Thai).\n\n* MEALWORMS ($7) - 4.5/5\nI was expecting these to be a crunchy fried texture, but they were actually soft with a slightly crisp exterior. Yes they look gross, but honestly if you're Asian, you've probably eaten some pretty weird things. Nicely salted and served with crispy basil leaves that gave it a little more flavor.\n\n* OXTAIL SOUP ($15) - 4/5\nHuge portion and very generous with the oxtail! Incredibly tender and somewhat fatty. Definitely a rich, hearty soup. I actually would've liked more veggies in the soup to balance it out.

We started with the larb salad, which came to the table with a very strong scent. Being Filipino I am no stranger to fish sauce, but this sucker was potent! We gobbled it all up, but we just wish there was a little less fish sauce. Our next dish was the crab pancake, which was excellent. Perfectly crispy on the edges with a chewy middle and crunchy bean sprouts. Definitely an excellent dish to share as a starter. For our entree we split the gra-prao fried rice with pork. I'm not one to usually order fried rice, but since I picked the first two dishes, my fiance chose this one. I liked this dish way more than I thought I would. It was very flavorful and the rice was the prefect texture and not mushy. I just wish we added an extra sunny egg on the top so we could mix in more egg yolk! Also, I'd like to note that their Thai iced tea is not super sweet. Usually these drinks are like syrup and way too sweet, but this one was just right. \n\nA great neighborhood Thai place that isn't super Americanized.", "author": "Sara P."}

If you want a real Thai food experience and not the Americanized Pad Thai BS that most of you think is authentic Thai food then go to Ben Thai. \n\nI am not getting paid for this, but I've honestly spent countless hours and wasted hard earned money trying to find a good Thai restaurant that would feed my need for nostalgia. I was so stoked to have called Ben Thai and find out they offered Khao Soi, a traditional northern Thai dish. During my stay in Chiang mai, I fell in love with this dish. I went to Ben Thai to try it and I have to say that while it was not an exact replication of what I ate in Chiang mai, it was pretty damn close. One of the biggest differences is that Ben Thai doesn't use a whole chicken drumstick when they serve up the dish as they do in Thailand. I am assuming this is all in an effort to cater to the American audience and not scare them away from the dish. I can definitely respect that. Gotta make a living in this expensive city somehow! \n\nI give this place a 5 out of 5. For all you peeps ordering the BS Pad Thai and \"Pad See Ew\", don't be so damn basic and get some culture between those chopsticks. Go out of your comfort zone and order the Khao Soi.

My friend and I shared the Murder Wings, (which I found to be moderately spicy, so don't be scared off!) and I ordered the Khao Soi as my entree while she got the House Fried Rice w/ duck and a side order of the steamed vegetables (not good, avoid). \n\nI found the Murder Wings not as mind-blowing as I'd have expected based off the glowing recommendations from several reviews, but my expectations were probably too high. Both our entrees were great, very flavorful and tasty but a little on the heavier side. We were going straight to a show afterwards and couldn't take any leftovers with us, so we tried our best to finish but couldn't quite accomplish it =P.

However, on this rainy and chilly day I saw a duck noodle soup on their family's favorite (or whatever) menu and I was instantly tempted. I love duck but what if their duck is nasty or what if they give me 1 or 2 measly pieces? I bit the bullet and ordered the duck noodle soup and I can tell you that it is what I will be getting there from now on. Any thai restaurant can make pad see ew but I don't see duck noodle soup everywhere. The duck slices were massive and definitely did not skip on the meat.

It's one of those dishes that you know you'll distinctly crave now that you've had it. It's spicy, so if you can't handle spice possibly ask if they can make it less spicy. It had notes of lemongrass but not the usual bitterness that lemongrass can bring in Thai soups. The pork rinds might sound weird but they really made it a knock out dish.

During the weekend and by request, the birthday friend wanted to eat at a great Thai joint. From my last experience, I knew Ben Thai would be the right choice. \n\nRunning alongside the experience, I MUST talk about how wonderful their staff is. Earlier that day on Saturday, I went to pick up a cake from a local bakery to surprise my friend with. The problem was, he was staying with me so there was no way I could bring that cake home. I decided to call the restaurant and ask if they would hold it for me in their refrigerator. Unexpectedly, they answered their phones while they were closed and agreed to hold it! When it was time for the surprise, not only did they bring out the cake, they also accompanied it with a scoop of ice cream and candle. I was sooooo appreciative of that :) Overall, the staff was very consistent in service to that story. On point, everyone was so sweet and so efficient/accommodating to our party. \n\nThe joint is cozy and offers two dining areas next door to each other. The two rooms don't seem to be cohesive, however you can tell they acquired two different spaces and combined it to offer more room for diners. As busy as they were, they did a good job in turning the tables for future guests. \n\nFor dinner here's what I had: \n-Chicken Satay for $9: Chicken skewers marinated in herbs and spices, served with peanut sauce and cucumber salad. The dish came with about 5 skewers and filled with chicken I love the quintessential peanut sauce for any Thai dish, let alone this one. \n\n-Paradise wings for $9: Sweet and savory fried chicken wings saut\u00e9ed with a touch of garlic and topped with fried basil. This was a complete winner for me! Super flavorful and crispy, like the menu says, it's \"The saint to our murder wings' sinner.\" TOTALLY true!\n\n-BBQ Pork for $12: Thin slices of lightly grilled pork marinated in a blend of thai herbs and spices. Served with side salad and a savory sauce. OMG, this was my favorite dish hands down! So much pork in this dish! It was never ending. I tried to order brown rice for $2 on the side to be healthy and it was a little gummy; should've ordered the white rice but the dish more than made up for that! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!\n\n-Oxtail Soup for $15: Oxtail slow stewed with carrot, tomato, and cabbage. This dish is rich and hearty, with a great balance between sweet and salty. Ok so I got this the last time I was here but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to talk about it. I LOVE the amount of oxtail that's in this dish the broth is rich and flavorful. Order a side of rice for $2 and you've got the PERFECT soup on a rainy day (or any day for that matter).\n\nI'm so happy this place is so close to my apartment.

I think it's a little better than Thai Spice, which is another Thai restaurant nearby.  Not sure if there's a lot more options right in walking distance but if there are, I'll definitely try others before coming back. Not that Ben Thai was bad but it seemed expensive for what you get.\n\nThe Pad Thai is $12, as are their lunch specials which come with rice, a nice portion of food (got the eggplant and chicken) and a plain \"salad\" (more like a mound of lettuce).  So lunch for two, with gratuity is $30.  Which I know, in SF seems to be normal, but walking out of there, it sure didn't feel like a $30 meal.  At least I got one more meal out of it as leftovers but for $30, I think I'd rather go somewhere else, or even get delivery from House of Thai 2 and get more variety!\n\nIt's nice inside with two sides of the restaurant - when you face the restaurant the right side is for pickup and delivery people and the left side is if you are going to dine-in.  There was one server for all 8 tables (yes it was fairly crowded when we went in, mostly 1 and 2 people on tables) and she was very friendly and seemed to manage all of the tables well.\n\nFood: Pad Thai was kind of one note. Not too sweet and not that yucky pink color at least.  But it could have used a little more depth and crunch.  The eggplant and chicken was really tasty, just a little oily.  Portions were generous, and in fact there was so much chicken in the pad thai that the next day for leftovers I felt like I was eating chicken with a side of noodles.\n\nOh they also seem to serve unique things (like mealworms, and crickets) but that's not my thing so I can't comment on it other than to say it's on their specials menu sometimes...\n\nIt's a casual Thai spot that I can't complain about, but I also can't really rave about either.  I think I'll try other places just to get a feel but I could see myself coming back here when I am craving Thai food in a pinch.", "author": "Traci H."}

First off, I must start off by HIGHLY recommending you guys order the Paradise Wings! They're the perfect level of crispy and also sweet and tangy but not too overwhelming. The Murder Wings are also good but I personally preferred the former. I ordered the red duck curry and I was captivated by the creamy richness from the coconut milk combined with the plump and flavorful duck. I was pleasantly surprised by the occasional sweet pineapple which I thought added something special to the dish. The owner Tarin is such a nice guy! He brought out the fried banana with coconut ice cream for me and my friends to try. Although we were full, this desert is insanely awesome and had us questioning whether it would be a good idea to order another one.\n\nMy mouth is watering just by writing this review!

The wings were very flavorful and came with a decent amount and the shrimp was perfectly fried and came with a nice dipping sauce. \nFor entrees, we got the papaya salad (tom sum), the fried fish, the pad Thai, the Ouse fried rice and a dish I can't remember cause it wasn't memorable. The papaya salad was kind of bland and could have been spicier. The pad Thai was quite average but tasted good. The fish wasn't very good and definitely not worth the price. The fried rice was my least favorite dish. It had a weird taste and wasn't like the Thai fried rices I've had before. \nThe mealworms came at the end of our meal. They were good, well seasoned and resembled popcorn. After popping a few in my mouth the thought of eating worms didn't really gross me out anymore because it really didn't feel like I was eating worms. Instead it felt like I was snacking on popcorn or chips. \n\nI gave this place 4 stars even though their food isn't that good because I really enjoyed their appetizers, their service was fast, the servers were nice and they were able to make worms actually taste good.", "author": "Cynthia L."}

Our waitress barely said hi to us and didn't smile at all, which wasn't very welcoming.\n\nI liked that there was a lunch menu even on weekends. $11 for a dish is a great deal. I ordered the Peanut Pra-ram with Prawns served with brown or white rice and a salad. I substituted the rice for an extra salad. $3 were added for the prawns.\n\nThe service was very quick. 4 Prawns only were served with my dish. Lots of peanut sauce which was lukewarm, not hot like you'd expect it to be coming out of the kitchen. It tasted pretty good but kinda industrial, like it came out of a can.

My family was famished from our long drive back from Yosemite and ordered almost every single appetizer: Murder Wings ($9), and Chicken Satay ($9), Pork of the Heavens ($9), and Prawn Rolls ($9). I actually loved the Chicken Satay the most, it made me want to come back for more every day. \n\nFamished, we also ordered two soups: Tom Yum ($9) and Tom Kha ($9). They came FAST (maybe 5 minutes) and were such beautiful soups, really! Ben thai is also really generous with the soup portion, which came with plenty of mushroom, broccoli, carrots, all cooked in a coconut milk based soup. I think just one soup is probably enough for 4 people.\n\nMy favorite entree was the Khao Siu ($14), which was egg noodles with pork and veggies in a broth, topped with crunchy pork rind and crunchy noodles. It is definitely a unique homecooked dish that you don't usually find in other Thai places, and I'm so glad I got to try it at Ben Thai.", "author": "Shelley C."}

I'd say the Gra-Prao is similar to a Basil Chicken type of dish you'd get at a Thai resto. It was pretty tasty and I loved the bamboo shoots. The clear winner of the night was the house fried rice (we added chicken). I can't exactly pinpoint what sauce they use, but it was delicious. \n\nAnd the Thai iced tea, you can't go wrong with this drink here. It actually tastes like a Thai iced tea is supposed to taste- the right amount of sugar, tea and half & half. \n\n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our dining experience at Ben's Thai Cafe. \n\nWe came, we saw, we ate and we will be back.", "author": "Nance H."}

I ordered an unsweetened ice tea,  the green curry and my friends ordered the Khao Soi. \n\nUnsweetened thai iced tea - I am just so grateful this is even an option. Kudos to Ben Thai for providing this because I've never seen it offered anywhere else.  It's about $1 cheaper than regular thai iced tea and it's less sweet because it does not contain the condensed milk. Most times I order thai iced tea, it comes way too sweet but this was perfect! If you like condensed milk, you may be disappointed because this is just tea and water with a hint of sweetness.  They also design the straw wrapper to look like a rose which I thought was cute!\n\nGreen Curry - I ordered this with tofu and brown rice. The brown rice came served in the shape of a heart. The green curry tasted good, but like any other green curry. Nothing to write home about but then again, nothing to complain about either.\n\nKhao Soi - The best way to describe this dish is that it tastes like red curry with noodles in it. It comes served in a bowl that looks exactly like a ramen bowl (even the reddish broth + noodles) makes it look like ramen. I love red curry so I thought this dish was delicious. At $14, the bowl of soup is HUGE. The broth is curry so it's very rich and I think it would be hard for me to finish the entire thing by myself. However, it did contain these sliced pickles which my friend did not like. For the record you can order it without the pickles if you also do not like them. I've never had pickles in my thai food so it may taste weird to some. I highly recommend this dish if you're feeling adventurous and want the most bang for your buck.", "author": "Amanda S."}

I had never heard of this place but was Yelping a Thai restaurant somewhere in SF on a Saturday afternoon and stumbled across Ben Thai. \n\nWe arrived around 2pm with a group of 5 and were seating immediately! I tried the red curry with tofu, pad kee mao, and the basil tofu dish. All 3 were great! The red curry was thick and creamy and had a lot of fresh veggies. The pad kee mao had great flavors and it was not too spicy. The basil tofu dish was probably my least favorite out of the 3, but it wasn't bad! The flavors were a little milder, but still and overall good dish!\n\nOne thing that I really liked was that they have lunch specials even on the weekends!

From the Christmas string lights to the authentic dragon painting on the wall, I appreciated every tiny detail of this place. The staff is attentive and friendly, never letting our water cups go half empty. \n\nWe decided to dine family style so we could sample multiple plates. Here was our menu:\n1. Golden Bags: Sort of like bag shaped egg-rolls filled with potatoes and other goodies! Extremely delicious especially with the sweet and sour sauce it was served with.\n2. Tom Yum: Honestly this was the best tom yum I've ever tasted! It was tangy and warm and sweet and even had a slight kick to it! 1 bowl was not enough.\n3. Pad Kee Mow: One of my favorite Thai dishes, executed to perfection.\n4. Pad Thai: Standard pad thai!\n5. Roasted Duck Curry: I couldn't get enough of this dish. The duck was so flavorful and succulent, and the curry itself was addicting! I poured it all over my rice. Probably my favorite dish of the night.\n6. Spicy Tilapia: I don't usually like fish, but this was pretty good.\n7. Crab Pancake: Loved this! Sadly each person only got a small slice since there were 6 of us, but it left me yearning for more!\n8. Murder Wings: Chef's special! Never tried anything like it. The chicken quality was superb, the sauce on the wings is sort of a lemongrass flavor that just felt like heaven on my palate. I don't know how I was still eating at this point, but I guess my stomach opened up another compartment.\n9. Fried Banana with Buko Ice Cream: First time having buko ice cream and it was great, but the star of the dessert were those deep fried bananas!

We ordered the same entree in-person that we did through delivery (pad kee mow) and it was significantly better. The noodles were cooked well, great flavor, just the right amount of oil and spice. ALso ordered the pik-king with tofu. The flavor was good and we liked the touch of lemongrass and the spicy sauce; the dish was undercooked though, as the green beans, broccoli, and carrots were not as soft as would be expected.

Literally EVERYTHING was excellent. \nMy most favorite is Panang Curry, it is thick and creamy with lots of favor (not like lots of places that make them in thin sauce and barely any real curry flavor). \nMurder wings- this is to die for. It's an appetizer but it's so good that I don't mind eating it as a part of my main meal. \nTom Kha, good thickness of the soup and packed lots of flavor. \nBbq chicken is so tender and flavorful. This is their style of bbq chicken (no regular bbq ribs sauce added here) so don't be afraid of ordering it that it might come out not authentic. \nLarb with duck was sooo refreshing and so tender. \nLastly, Ghao Soi is a great curry noodle dish.

I had the khao soi for the first time as I haven't seen it in other Thai restaurants I visited. The curry broth was rich and delicious. The pickled greens balance out the overall richness of the dish and definitely surprised me with that burst of acidity. The crispy noodles and pork rinds on top provide a nice contrast in texture to the soup. \n\nI didn't expect this place to be busy on a weekday night since it's fairly new, but the wait wasn't that long and the food makes up for it.\n\nThai iced tea is awesome as well. Then again, I'm biased since I'm always down for Thai iced tea.", "author": "Eli P."}

I loveee ginger, so the ginger lemonade was right up my alley. I also really liked the thai iced coffee. It had a good coffee taste without being bitter or watered down! \n\nFor food, we tried the golden bags, murder wings, and the green curry. The food was super flavorful and presented so nicely! My favorite were the two appetizers. The golden bags were so pretty! You can tell that they spent time putting it together. They were nice and crispy on the inside and warm and potatoey on the inside. The murder wings were soooo flavorful! It was full of flavor but so fresh at the same time. I highly recommend trying these! \n\nThe place itself was very nice and clean. The staff was very friendly. I think they've put a really fun twist on Thai food, and I'll definitely be back!", "author": "Jennifer H."}

For those of you who are familiar with the popular Thai restaurants in SF (Marnee, Chabaa, etc.), I'd say this one gives them a run for their money. I got the green curry with chicken. It's not watered down like most other places and there was a nice kick, but nothing too strong. We also tried the crab fried rice and the pad se ew. All delicious!", "author": "Tiffany M."}

I used to work around the corner and would come here about once a week. If I could, I'd eat there everyday. I like this spot because the service is very friendly, the quality of the food is great, and they have both the typical AmericanThai food menu items AND some less common items that  are more traditional and we don't get exposed to here. I'm really glad that this spot has allowed me to expand my Thai-food-horizon. I love the usual stuff--green curry, parang curry, chicken satay, Pad Thai-- all great. But the thing that REALLY BLEW MY TASTE BUDS was the **KHAO SOI**. This thick and flavorful soup rivals ramen for me. It's a burst of textures and noodles and creamy broth and pickled veggies that haunt me in my dreams...in a good way. Highly recommend this spot! Definitely a great spot to have dinner before a night of bar hopping on Polk!", "author": "Shayan S."}

I don't live in San Francisco, but visit frequently and this place has become a staple of my trips. I love Thai food and have passable Thai in my city, but this place is what I crave when thinking Thai. At this point I've tried most of the menu and nothing has disappointed. Favorites: pork of the heavens, Tom kha (soup, I get it with chicken - and I get it every time, soooo good), and the ka-ree (yellow curry). They'll also do what they can to accommodate your special needs - for example: when headed to UCSFMC to visit a friend going through chemo I wanted my Thai fix, but I also needed something easy and tasty for him. I explained what I was looking for and they fixed me up with beautifully juicy, mildly seasoned chicken and rice. Perfect. The place is owned and run by a local family, and you can tell how much they care about both their food and their customers. Highly recommended!", "author": "J L."}
