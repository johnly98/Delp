First the restaurant is super loud and has music playing for no reason since it can't be heard. The service is terrible. I had different people bring my food and water, I had to ask for more water as my server never came by to check. Also they only filled the glass halfway, huh, why wouldn't you fill it up all the way. It was a small glass to begin with? There are only 7 or 8 tables full as we took up 3. The food was bland for the most part or gross. The Las Vegas roll was tasty with the cream cheese but that is all I tasted in it. Plus it was super small for the price. The katsu which my mom ordered was nasty and bit sour, which I assume was the sauce. The rice even had an odd flavor. The portions are super small and regularly priced. The real kick was they ran out of cocktails before 8. It was still 7 and they had no cocktails. What the heck? How do you run out of cocktails before the dinner rush? Also the bill comes with a 23% tip and place to add more tip automatically add. Wait why 23 you maybe thinking, well 20% for crappy service and 3% for health insurance. Wow what a scam.\n\nMy sister loved the place, well she can have it. I won't be back.", "author": "Gregory F."}

It was pretty late, so the restaurant was almost empty except for a rowdy table of dudes lol. \n\nWe ordered the sweet scallop roll, torched salmon, and white sake tempura roll. The white sake tempura came out first. It's more of a thicker roll with salmon and avocado, wrapped in seaweed and lightly fried. I liked it and the sauces that came with it. The torched salmon and sweet scallop roll came out shortly after. I thought the sweet scallop roll was tiny in comparison to sushi places we usually go to. But it was delicious because I love scallops. The torched salmon is self explanatory--seared salmon with sauces. It's also wrapped around an avocado slice, which is a great complement to salmon sashimi. \n\nService was extremely friendly.

Being surrounded by a plethora of sushi restaurants, it is difficult to know which one to go to.  Enter Tamashisoul Sushi Bar.  On first impressions, this place is like many sushi bars I have been to in the past.  The place was dimly lit with a minimal number of tables and a bar.  I noticed two sushi chefs quickly preparing fish for a number of patrons who were already seated.\n\nWe were greeted by a young gentleman who was super down to earth and made suggestions here and there.  Since we were comfortable with the menu, we just dived right in and ordered a number of things.  Other than the wonderful salad, the nigiri and the quality of fish was amazing.  If any fish was super fresh then this place had it!  We had red snapper, tuna, salmon and even halibut nigiri.  My mouth is watering as I'm typing this!\n\nHighly recommended to sit at the bar and look to the right.  The sushi chefs are doing their thing.  I saw them grind away at real wasabi which you can get for $3USD and its something I would recommend ordering!  If the sushi chefs weren't preparing sushi, they were sharpening their knives and preparing rice.  Always on the go! \n\nCan't say enough of this place except it'll definitely be a stop when we return to San Francisco!  Go for the nigiri and stay for everything else.  This place is excellent and would recommend it in a heartbeat.  Kampai!", "author": "Alex L."}

But a makeover into   omakase-style with a more limited menu and focus on \"high quality fish only\" (and seemingly higher prices) proved to be a disappointment. All of the grilled food items we liked were removed from the menu. The mushroom miso soup was still flavorful but the serving dish was downsized. While the sushi roll was still tasty, the sashimi salad was poor. The salad was rough and tasteless with the inappropriate addition of tomatoes, blackberries and raspberries. It seemed thrown together without much thought and no integration of flavors. The green tea seemed watered down. \nSo this restaurant has gone from double thumbs up to thumbs down and we likely won't return.

My husband and I stopped here for second dinner on our last night in SF (don't judge, its our thing) and couldn't have been happier with our experience from beginning to end. We sat at the bar and ordered from the sushi menu, we were bummed to see a number of things 86'ed but it was towards the end of the night so understandable. They have real wasabi which I totally worth the $3 If you've never experienced it. We started with the red snapper tataki which was perfection! The red snapper melted in our mouths and we contemplated ordering a second round but went for nigiri instead. We got salmon, eel, yellowtail and red snapper and it was too legit to quit! Being landlocked in Colorado has given me a new appreciation for fresh fish and sushi and Tamashisoul went above and beyond our expectations!

We came with a moderate size group (about 8) and there were orders missing and food being delivered in awkward segments (where half of our party had received their dishes while the other half had not). I don't blame anyone but the restaurant for not realizing that perhaps one additional cook and one additional server is necessary to serve during prime time. \n\nThat being said, the food was alright. The udon was a tad bit salty, and I have no idea why the tempura udon includes all the tempura inside of the udon itself (this makes the panko soggy and generally unpleasant to eat). I did enjoy the design rolls, however, but it was admittedly a bit pricey. \n\nI've never been a huge fan of the automatic tipping rule in cases like these where our fairly large party did not get proper service (we had to pay 20% tip for our $150+ order), so we probably won't be returning here with a large group.", "author": "David Y."}

I actually would prefer to give them a 1.5 star, or even a 1 star, but I really hope they actually have some other nicer servers. Food is fine. Prices meh. \n\nI saw on yelp that this restaurant had good ratings, so I decided to take my sister and my 3yo niece there. Parking in that area is terrible. half the streets were blocked off because of construction, so the parking availabilities were effectively halved. So I had to park in the neighborhood, but I only got that bright idea after 25 minutes of circling. (Don't worry, I didn't rate them on parking- this is just a warning to anyone with a car.)\n\nWhen I finally came running into the restaurant, my sister had already ordered food for her daughter, and the little one was eating it (good.) I barely have sat down and addressed my sister when the waitress comes over and demands \"are you ready to order\". I literally look at her and deadpan \"I just sat down, I'll need a moment.\" Seriously, this woman- it wasn't like I was socializing for the last twenty minutes and wasted her time here. I JUST sat down, I didn't even completely take off my jacket, and I was still catching my breath from running in! \n\nI look at the menu, and prices aren't exactly the best here, so I only ordered the spider roll, my sister got some hamachi appetizer and another roll, and the little one had a tempura roll and ankimo. I'm very glad my sister ordered for my niece before I came, because it took another twenty to thirty minutes for our food to come out. We were one of three parties in the restaurant at that moment, and no one had extremely huge orders. I have no idea what took them so long. \n\nSpider roll: pretty crispy crab, but drenched in sauce. Would have preferred less sauce.\nHamachi appetizer: Really good, fresh fish. Too much sauce, but it was easy to remove. \n\nIn conclusion: Won't come here again, didn't feel welcome. Our waitress was really forceful whenever she asked us \"IS EVERYTHING OKAY HERE\" as if she was daring us to say otherwise. Food was decent, but not quite worth the price tag. \n\n~~~\n\nEDIT:: \nAbout two days later, my sister had to go back to pick up our forgotten toddler utensils. I'm very glad and grateful that they kept it for us, because apparently my sister had to beg them to hold it because they were going to throw it away? (what the?), and when my sister retrieved them, her fabric bag that stored the utensils was soaking wet. (Ew! I hope it was water...) \n\nI then took this opportunity to talk to my sister about the service. I felt like that waitress was weirdly cold and not hospitable. Apparently before I came in, the waitress took my sister's order incorrectly, and then blamed it on my niece. Not cool. My sister pointed at and SAID \"tempura roll\", and the waitress brought her a tempura appetizer. Not a huge difference, and easily fixable. but nope- the waitress took it to the cook, and said loudly \"They ordered the appetizer, but the baby hanged her mind.\" Excuse me- my niece is one to stubbornly stick to what she wants (Trust us- we would prefer she just eat the tempura appetizer). AND my sister would never allow her to inconvenience others with her fickleness. The cook was nice though- and just said to my sister \"it's okay, I have kids, I understand.\" Sweet sentiment, but nope, you just have a very inept waitress. \n\n\nI think they have the potential to be a really nice good neighborhood restaurant, but the way that waitress treated us really left a bitter taste in our mouths.

I came here after a dance workout and was ravenously craving sushi for lunch. This was the only sushi place open within a 15 mile radius! Everywhere else opened at 5 for dinner D: My expectations weren't too high but I was pleasantly surprised at how affordable all the rolls were considering it is the Marina where overpriced food and luxury goods invade. Just a few blocks away a huge crowd of yuppies came out of Soul Cycle so I was expecting small portions and large prices. However each roll was only $10-15 and the portions were very filling.  \n\nThe decor and ambiance was quite dark for a place that opens at 11 am, but the staff was incredibly inviting and gave the best recommendations. I ended up deciding on the King Salmon roll which was baked salmon and raw with cream cheese which is my absolute favorite. The rolls come in 8 pieces and I was debating about getting a second but the first one truly hit the spot. Sauce was tasty but not overwhelming and salmon was fresh as can be.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-08-29", "description": "So after living 2 blocks away for a year, we finally gave in on a tired/lazy night to try this place out. Now to be fair, my wife and I have lived in Japan for about 30 years combined, so we know how to appreciate good sushi. And just to be clear, this does not mean we expect what you get at a $600 a person place like Urasawa in LA or Masa in NY.\n\nBut we do expect fresh seafood. Would you go to a grocery store to purchase fruits past their prime, on the brink of rotting and having an almost intolerable level of funk? I hope not.\n\nThis is what we got in the two seafood dishes we ordered. The chirashi, which is an assortment of sashimi slices in a bowl of sushi rice, and the rainbow row. All fish in both dishes, except the tuna and salmon were inedible. The tuna and salmon were just edible, not enjoyable. The chirashi actually had  slices of tuna \"marinated\" in soy. When this was explained I immediately suspected it was a technique to extend the expiration date of the fish. It certainly did not enhance the tuna but even more oddly, the marinated fish was actually quite dry. In fact, all the fish was drier than what I'm used to, probably due to the length of time it has spent in their refrigerator after being thawed (yes, almost all sushi grade fish is flash frozen) but the marinated tuna was the most dry. Remembering the meal, there were actually thinner slices of fish that were starting to stiffen into shape. Ya, picture that.\n\nSo if you love rolls filled with imitation crab or spicy tuna and something deep fried in or on top your roll, this is your place. Convenient location and decent prices. \n\nIf you expect fresh fish and want to taste it rather than the sauces, fried gimmicks, cream cheese, etc., do not go here. We eat out several nights a week and this was the worst meal I've had in 3-4 years. I almost felt angry I put food like this in my stomach. I feel horrible for saying this but it's true and so unfortunate because theres only a handful of sushi options in this neighborhood. Now, they are of course catering to the local market but I almost see it as if they are taking advantage of their customers who don't know better. Either way, if you want sushi/sashimi, I think this review gives you an idea of who their target market is. Choose based on this.\n\nThe edamame was the best dish. We also tried the smoked squid salad which had a deceiving description. I would be surprised if they actually smoked the squid themselves. This is a typical style of preserving squid in Korea that you can buy in batches from Korean markets. If it is made on premise, than it certainly doesn't taste like it was made fresh. Sorry Tamashisoul, this is just my honest observations from our meal 30 minutes ago. Nothing personal. One last criticism, you don't have a sushi bar so don't ask customers if they want to sit there. You only have a bar...", "author": "Wes P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-17", "description": "Just a year ago, I lived around the corner and would frequent this place as it was good for price and the area. Moving away has made this location a bit out of the way, however, last weekend I came to the area to get a haircut and knew it was perfect opportunity to come and have dinner like the \"good ole times.\"\n\nI would say the best times to come in and eat are around the 4:00 or 5:00pm time slots as it usually isn't crowded. In fact, when I walked in it was completely empty, maybe a couple of customers at the bar. Since it was me, I decided to take a seat at the bar. The bartender, although cordial, seemed to have a particular way of serving; almost as if he was a bit flustered the entire time. I would ask him for something seemingly simple like a glass of water and he would say \"hold on, I'll be right back,\" come back and have to ask me again about what I needed...which was a water. It wasn't off putting and he was serving the entire restaurant (later, more people came in and sat on tables), so not a complete big deal; as a former server, I thought that was interesting though. What I love about the place, though is the decor. It's intimate and a perfect spot for date night! Table tops, high tops and bar seating offers lots of room for diners. Big screen tv's serve as a nice touch as well. \n\nThroughout my many visits, I've gotten a few things, but on this particular visit, here's what I ordered: \n\n-Sake Clam Soup for $6.00. OMG, I've never had a soup like this. You can taste the sweetness from the sake and deep right clam broth. LOTS of clams fill the bowl. HIGHLY RECOMMEND, if you like clams. \n\n-Nigiris range from $5.00-$7.00, depending on what you get. I usually get an order (comes with 2 pieces) of sake or salmon and tako or octopus. The fish was fresh and their wasabi is homemade so that's a beautiful touch! \n\n-Wasabi Shumai for $6.00. It's your classic pork dumpling with a hint of fresh wasabi served in a little broth (maybe ponzu?). Soooo good. I love how this place takes your classic dishes and adds one, maybe two ingredients to really enhance the overall experience. This was no difference. \n\n-Bamboo roll for $10.00: Spicy salmon topped with avocado, crunch, soy tobiko, scallion and special sauce. This was a big roll and super good. They put a ton of tobiko on the top which added more flavor to it. No need for soy sauce on this, lots of flavors going on already. \n\nOverall, my experience at Tamashisoul has always been good.

These guys know how to make some mean sushi! The presentation is stunning, the service here is awesome and the sushi is down right incredible. The proportion size of the rolls themselves are misleading at first sight. They look smaller than your typical sushi rolls, but don't let that fool you. I was completely full from two orders of their specialty rolls: The Bamboo Roll (spicy salmon topped with avocado, crunch, soy tobiko, scallion and their special sauce) and The White Angel Roll (spicy tuna and asparagus topped with white tuna and their special sauce). The spicy miso soup is also a unique and welcome dish; simple, yet rich in flavor. \n\nOther than the incredible food here, the service is very friendly and quick. I waited no more than 10 minutes for my food, and was back to work in 30 minutes total. It's the perfect place for lunch, and makes for a great dinner as well.

If you said yes, make your way over here as soon as possible for a delicious meal. If you said no, this is still the perfect place to start. Fresh sushi, tasty and made with passion.

The orange uni was very good and fresh with a little black caviar on top which really made it special.  \n\nThe happy hour included $5 special edamame, $5 beef gyoza, $5 house-warm sake, and $5 classic rolls.  \n\nI had the Alaska Roll and the Spicy Tuna Roll.  I loved that there was not a ton of rice on the sushi.  I normally end up removing rice because there is too much.  The fish was very fresh and presented beautifully.   \n\nI also ordered a miso soup ($3) which I thought had great flavor and was a pretty good portion (not a super tiny bowl).  \n\nMr. Man got the beef gyoza which were lovely and fried.  I liked the beefy flavor over the traditional pork.  While the gyoza was a bit oily for my taste, I can't really complain because it was super tasty and crispy.  Mr. Man loved it and gobbled it down in seconds.\n\nService was probably one of the most excellent parts of our experience.  We sat at the bar (it was not too busy) and Jeffery and Ryan really took great care of us.  Most notably, Mr. Man has allergies to all seafood and they were really accommodating about finding things that he could eat next time we come for a full meal.  It is rare that Mr. Man a) likes a sushi place due to his allergies; b) likes anywhere without a full bar; c) would voluntarily ask if we could come back to a sushi place without a full bar soon.  Tamashisoul Sushi really charmed him, and that is a tall order.\n\nI'm a huge fan of this place!  Any sushi place that makes both of us happy is a definite winner to me!", "author": "Susan C."}

My taste and palate as you would define would be refined at this point in my life. We ordered the sashimi platter, tamashi on fire special roll, shrimp tempura, sweet scallop roll, and a bamboo roll. The sashimi was fresh and huge, the special rolls were amazing, I especially enjoyed the sweet scallop roll. We paired our food with a large Sapporo to start and then our server Isaac asked if we wanted to try Japanese tequila, it tasted very similar to sake but it was light and smooth as most sakes are. \n\nService:\n\nIsaac was an attentive server/bartender, he recommended some awesome rolls and alcohol.

As our last day being here, we decided that we'd treat ourselves. From the photos, it seemed that it could be a decent place (pictures can be deceiving). We took a Lyft ride from downtown to this spot and walked in surprising ourselves with a cozy and tranquil environment. Our server, Isaac, gave us some great recommendations on sushi rolls. We took his advice on the White Angle, Crazy Love and Tamashi on Fire. These rolls are a must when coming here. We are from LA, where there are many well know celebrity sushi restaurants. We consider this place one of our favorites. Thank you Isaac for your excellent service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-09-16", "description": "We made reservations at 5:30 pm on a Sunday night, but came in earlier then expected around 5:20. When we first walked in it was very quiet and a cute modern looking place inside. The server was bussing around slowly through the bar and the tables when we got there. It was about three tables of two people and four people at the bar. At first our server/hostess didn't notice us until my boyfriend had to come up and say oh we have reservation. And then he replies \"oh I'll be right with you. Sit here\" , and pointed to the table directly behind the people at the bar. \n\nAfter we sat down , we skimmed through the menu and saw the prices are tad bit high. This is where I started questioning their service, because our server completely ignored us for the next 15 minutes. And he took an order at the bar before ours when the party of two rolled in after we sat down! We tried to flag him down and get his attention,however, he would rather put his attention SOLELY to the customers on the bar!! He kept tending to people at the bar as they kept ordering more alcohol! We looked around and saw this other server with her stank face was \"off duty\" sitting in the corner alone. We were hoping this server we saw was not a \"lone wolf\". NOBE HE WAS ALL BY HIMSELF !He was taking orders, doing the bar,and serving the food out! Don't get me wrong- I am a server too , and YOU ONLY HAVE ONE JOB! You have to mulitask and bust your butt off to get in orders while serving food out professional as possible!! I WOULD KNOW! If a customer is done eating their meal and sipping on beer to beer- I would tend to them after I take orders first of newer customers. MAKES SENSE RIGHT? No he served alcohol to the bar people again and again...then he took the other table order before ours and took the food out slowly to other tables.\n\n These people at the bar behind us, were getting really loud and that is when the atmosphere changed so drastically. It was the opera of obxnious drunks with the performance of poor service on the side. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt and waited another 5 minutes until he got to us. He asked \"are you ready to order?\"Me and my boyfriend told him we were ready for a very long time and he replies \"Oh, I was busy with other tables! Did you see!?\" LIKE NO DUDE YOU DO NOT SAY THAT TO CUSTOMERS. You apologize and try your darn best to not make excuses when you work at a restaurant- especially, customer service industry! We blantely ignored his remark and ordered. We got the miso soups,chirasi bowl, gyoza, and chicken teriyaki. Food was rolling out slowly, but we became increasingly uncomfortable with the noise level. First the miso soup came and it was lukewarm, but had a balanced taste. Gyoza was very tasty, however, the teriyaki was very salty. My chirasi bowl was good, the rice was flavored, but I wish they listed what type of fish were in there. After we were done with our meal, we asked the server how long he worked here. He replied \"6 months \". For me ,that's a enough time for a person to get into \"the flow of work\" and you should adapt to being quicker on tasks. I felt bad if I didn't leave tip even though I didn't think he deserved it, but as we left the restaurant - the sign in the front window said \"now hiring servers\".\n\n Overall, I wouldn't be coming back because: 1)it gets loud as hell in there  that you cannot even hear your own thoughts, 2)food was \"aite \", 3) too pricey for portion/quality, and 4)the service was missing completely. The pet peeve I have is servers who \"pretend\" to be nice after you paid your meal while being absent the whole service. Don't let the nifty modern look fool you on this upbeat street.

Only two small things - we got hot tea and they serve it in your own little tea pot. It wasn't as hot as we would have liked. Also we got our salads really quick but seemed to have taken longer than neccesary for our main dishes.

Yes.\n\nDespite the fact that the waiter/chefs/restaurant forgot about us, their rolls were flavorful even without alcohol-enhanced taste buds! So yes, we ordered our food, the table next to us was seated and got their food before us, we asked about our food (cause no one seemed to notice our empty table), the table next to us FINISHED their food, and then we got our appetizer. I don't know if it was actually worth the wait, but this place is definitely worth a try. \n\nThe spicy tuna roll is luxuriously smooth and carried a decent amount of spice -- not too much to overpower the fresh tuna flavor and just enough to please this spice-loving foodie. The samurai roll was a California roll with eel and salmon, topped with a spicy aioli and black tobiko. It wasn't overly glamorous with toppings but it felt like a party in my mouth. The 49ers roll isn't on their menu, but you can ask them to make it! They were spot on. Also, bonus, their sushi pieces are bite sized, unlike many a sushi joint with their oversized concoctions.\n\nMy friend and I wanted to try a beverage from their cocktail list, but they didn't have any on our visit. Out waiter recommended the Nigori sake -- sweet and milky. A good intro to sake.", "author": "Erin G."}

Living near the beach made me as a sushi expert(the truth is, my tummy hurts when I eat raw seafood..but I can't resist the taste and texture of sashimi. Which means, I'm super picky on sushi, especially when it comes with the freshness. ) \n\nI have a quite good nose. I can smell well on everything or anything \n For example, when I drink soju or sake when I am tired as hell,\n the liquor smells and tastes like a nail remover.\n... I know that sounds weird but don't try to understand me. Because I'm like that.\n\nWhen I first came in to this sushi bar I was quite surprise. I thought it was some ordinary sushi joint that smells like fish or vinegar. \nBut since the entrance doors were wide open, I can scent the breeze air and hot sake. \nSince I made a 2 reservation on the same spot, we came here first for a family dinner as a 1st round of the night. \n\nTo start with an appetizer, we had Spicy tuna tartar and Hamachi carpaccio which were their one of the specialty dish, the harmony of spicy tuna and avocado were sweet and buttery, it figuratively melted in my mouth.\n\nAs a yelp veiwer, I SOOO wanted to try their uni nigiri which was posted here before. Thank God they served the best full flavor of nigiri. The uni nigiri wasn't surrounded by nori as a roll or embedded with a chunk of rice. The rice were enough and the uni itself had the right(better) amount of the sweet and freshness.(my mouth is getting watery now.)\n\nWhile we were getting stuffed by hot and chilled sake and beer which I couldn't resist, I was full but had to eat my sushi rolls no matter what. The tamashisoul's special sauce were a little too much for my taste but it eventually made my tongue wake up by the time we had 2nd and 3rd bottles of sake and beer. \nAfter a full dinner with my family, my old missed friends started to come in for our 2nd round to celebrate one of our pal's upcoming event of their marriage. \nAnd yes I had so much fun time with my good friends, it was a blessed and blasting night. \nI will come back whenever I visit my hometown. \n\n\n\nP.S- I didn't forget to have their sweet green tea icecream as a dessert. ;)", "author": "MixD.NA P."}

Basically, this dinner fluctuated more than any dining experience I've had in months, and one could say it was a bumpy road at times.  \n\nThe first faux pas was when our waiter went MIA after seating us.  We waited 15 minutes before being served even just water, at which point we were finally able to put in our request for the bottle of pinot. Given the slow start, we decided to place our entire dinner order at the same time.  Not only did our pinot not show up for another 15 minutes, the couple sitting next to us (who, I swear to God, were seated 10 minutes after us) got their wine first.  I'm not being childish, but when this happens at 8pm on a Tuesday night in a restaurant with literally 5 couples in the entire space, it seems almost comical (but trust me, we weren't laughing).  \n\nJust when we saw the waiter finally approaching, it was to our disappointment to see he wasn't carrying our wine, but instead our miso soup.  A minute or so later, our wine came out....along with our 3 rolls.  You see, this sort of poor timing throws off the whole meal.  Part of the art of dining out is the perfectly timed intervals between wine, the starter, and the rolls, and while no one is perfect, I regret not enjoying a solid 10 minutes of just wine (and conversation, of course).  \n\nOnto the food, and the reason this review deserves 4 stars as opposed to the 2 stars it started with: the mushroom miso was phenomenal.  It was light but almost hearty in a way I've never experienced with miso.  And the rolls! We had the White Angel (my favorite), the Rainbow, and one more which I regret not remembering (or finding on the menu as I review now).  It was crunchy and only mediocre.  Three huge rolls were just enough for us 2 to split and leave feeling super satisfied, yet not so much that we were running home to nap.\n\nIn retrospect, this meal was delicious and the company was fun, but the service was unreliable, and I hope for a more attentive staff if I ever go back.", "author": "Rachel H."}

Waitress/bartender didn't check on me much either. Don't think I'll be back. For such a basic roll I think it would be tastier at Safeway!", "author": "Courtney J."}

The food the first time was better than today. The miso soup was tepid and tasted old. The two rolls we ordered were okay.\n\nThe weirdest part about Tamashisoul is service. Ambivalent and absent minded -- both times we've been, the servers seemed clueless as to their role and what dining out it about. It wasn't busy, but all of the open tables were dirty and just sat the whole time we were there. At one point, our server plunked down a dirty wash cloth on the table next to us, where it remained for the rest of our meal. Made us both wonder what condition the kitchen is in.\n\nThere are definitely worse places for sushi, but with so many better places to go, I'd have a hard time choosing to come back here.", "author": "Terry P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-09", "description": "The only reason I am giving Tamashi Soul a 3 instead of a 2 is because this isn't a bad hangout.  Sorry guys had to round down to 2.  Check my update towards the bottom for the reason.  When it comes to sushi though, ONLY come here if you are not looking for the delicate balance between quality fish and rice.  If you love lots of mayo and teriyaki sauce that smothers your sushi rolls, then this is the spot for you.  The beauty of the sushi is all in the eye and the mouth of the beholder.  This place is not for me.\n\nThe fish of sushi is suppose to be highlighted by the ingredients it is paired with but here it is the sauces that are the supposed stars irrelevantly highlighted by the fish.  They might want to take after Umami sushi and utilize their ingredients better to enhance the flavors and the proper contrast of delicate flavors.\n\nIf sushi smothered and overpowered by sauces gets you wet, then this is definitely the place for you.\n\nUpdate:  Look... I gave you guys 3 stars originally, Min Yong C.  Take the comments as a way to improve.  If you don't agree with me then we can disagree.  I won't be hurt by it but you don't have to be sarcastic.  Judging by all the other reviews, you have a reason for everything that's bad.  For example, a few yelpers got sick after eating here on different occasions and you have the tenacity to blame them for maybe eating too much fish.  That is just hilarious.  Then some yelpers said sauces were too sweet for the sushi rolls, and you told them they are too sensitive to sweetness.  Some other yelpers claim some dishes were too salty, and you told them they are too sensitive to salt.  With the sauce issue, you are saying we don't understand sushi.   \n\nIn my case, messaging me telling me that you hope you helped me \"UNDERSTAND\" sushi... I really had no idea I just got schooled.  For a business that is not looking to improve through thoughtful comments from their paying guests kind of lands it less stars.  Note that in no way from my original review did I mention whether it was \"authentic\" or not.  I just felt that the sauces waaaaaay overpower the actual sushi rolls and fish.  The message sent to me by the owner is as shown on the bottom just hours after I submitted my review today:\n\nMin Yong C.\nComment from Min Yong C. of Tamashisoul Sushi Bar \nBusiness Owner\n12/9/2014  If you like authentic sushi, you can order our sushi & sashimi since we serve and season our nigiri & sashimi very traditional way. When you order items under design rolls which is very Americanized sushi, you should not expect it to be authentic. I hope this helped you understand little bit more about sushi.\n\nI didn't know that walking into a sushi restaurant that it would be \"American\" sushi.  It doesn't say that on your menu or your signs.  Maybe you want to make that clear at the door.  Tamashisoul \"Americanized\" Sushi  \n\nYour nigiri isn't much to rave about either.  I wanted to give less stars originally but thought that it's still a good hang out although not the best sushi.  After this run in though,  I can sleep better giving less.  Can't give a restaurant average or above it they can't respect their client's thoughts especially when they aren't unreasonable ones.  And please, I  don't even know if you understand American sushi, but I sure don't think you understand Japanese sushi.  Even if it is what you claim to be \"Americanized\" sushi, it still deserves balance in ingredients.  That's when it comes to ANY food buddy.  Good luck with your business.  2 stars.  You're lucky I'm not giving you a one.  \n\nStill a good hang out.  Watch a game, drink a beer, have some American sushi.  \n\nI won't EVER be back though.", "author": "Colin M."}

They gave us a complimentary roll which was actually one of my favorites of the night! We tried some sake too (don't remember which one); it was sweet and easy to drink.

Although I also rated it five stars in my previous review, I've never enjoyed my meal more than I did tonight. It was probably because my hubby is better at choosing sushi rolls than me and he handled the ordering this time! We started out with the avocado bomb and it was great. Then moved on to the white angel and the bamboo roll. Wow!!! They were sooo delicious and flavorful. We finished off with the tempura ice cream with vanilla ice cream and it was the bomb. I'm looking forward to my next visit already. P.S. The manger is very friendly and personable and makes excellent recommendations. The prices are awesome too!", "author": "Kelsey K."}

The waitress was very focused on making sure our glasses were full and the plates were cleared.  The prices were ok for San Francisco, and the portion sizes were acceptable.  We spent just over $200 for 3 of us and $70 was alcohol.\n\nThe meh: They are still working out their process.  There was a lot of confusion as to who should take orders, and often our waitress was not readily available as she was trying to pick up for the slack of the other trainees.    Though there were seats when we arrived, we had to sit at the bar due to reserved tables.  The reservations didn't even show up till we were leaving.   \n\nThe ugly: Food Poisoning.

My only concern was that there were only four pieces, kinda eh for $7 right?  \n\nAs an entree I had the chicken teriyaki which was served with grilled veggies and your ordinary bowl of white rice and miso.  It was pretty good but then again I do wish the portions were bigger since that plate was like ~$16.  My friend had the classic eel sushi roll and she said it was just \"okay\".  For dessert I had the fried banana with green tea ice cream and I guess the fried banana was well prepared but the ice cream had this nasty-weird taste, bleh.\n\nThe service was kind of lackluster/slow while there weren't even that many people in the bar.

He also brought over 3 other hot sauces which I totally loved.  The server and sushi chef watched me eat the food in amazement and announced they had tremendous respect for me.  LOL!

I popped in with a gf last night for dinner around 7:30pm - we were able to get last min reservations without any problem. She chose the sashimi platter, which was a bit overpriced for the amount of food. Good mix of sashimi options (the salmon was particularly tasty), but the fish was situated amongst these huuuge piles of a curly white root-like vegetable. It felt like they were trying to disguise the fact that there were so few pieces of fish on the plate - it would have been a tiny dish if they removed the frills. Chirashi is my go-to at any nice sushi restaurant, and I wouldn't get it here again. The fish was ok, but they put a salad on top of the rice with a pungent dressing that I didn't like... it soaked down through the sushi rice and ruined the nice base flavor. I get that they're trying to be unique, but sometimes the true basics are better than the fancy presentations. \n\nI'd return and try the rolls, as there were several (like the Bamboo) that looked interesting. I wonder if they always have the same strange music selection... I'm down for 90s throwbacks like Spice Girls and Britney Spears every once in a while, but it didn't seem to fit the nice, non-crazy-sake-bombing vibe they were going for on a casual Wednesday evening.", "author": "Kelcey M."}

Yet not too busy to seat us right away at the sushi bar. Jin (\"like Gin & Tonic!\" he told us) was the head sushi chef, and I must assume the owner. He was artfully putting together plates of sashimi and still had an eye on the goings-on around how we patrons seated at the bar were being attended to by the staff.\n\nYou could tell the staff were still learning, and there are some kinks to be worked out. But that's to be expected at this point. Jin paid excellent attention to us, and even asked if he could experiment with the sashimi platter he was about to make for us. Hello? Like I'm going to tell a friendly sushi chef \"no\"???\n\nWhen the sashimi plate came, Jin told us what each type of fish was called in Japanese, and what he had done to prepare it. He also served us real wasabi. As if the sashimi wasn't impressive enough, the few rolls we also ordered were just as incredible tasting.\n\nWelcome to the neighborhood, Jin.

For a place that's only been open a few months, this is too much.  \n\nTL, DR: tasted fine on the way down, not so much on the way up.  Eat at own risk.", "author": "Andrea J."}

I came here with some girl friends a while back and we had an amazing time!!\n\nFor a Friday night it was pretty busy! They have a really big cold sake selection which is nice and a lot of different Japanese beers! We were looking to get our weekend started so we ordered some sake bombs which were surprisingly affordable!\n\nThe food was fantastic! The avocado bomb is unique and fun to eat especially if you like avocado. Their rolls have a lot of taste, we had the bamboo, double shrimp, and spider and loved all three! We also wanted to try the salmon, yellowtail, and fluke nigiri which were all super fresh and delicious!\n\nThe service is great!! The servers are really nice and always make sure your glasses are filled, be it water or sake! They always clear plates and make sure you are doing well. Even the sushi chefs are nice! They also make sure you are enjoying your food even though they're busy and engage in conversation. It makes for a really fun atmosphere! I will definitely be back again for some sake bombs and good food", "author": "Michelle N."}

I think this might be b/c the chefs are using saran wrap to keep the rolls together while cutting them, but i found in 3 of the rolls we had, the slices weren't really separate--the seaweed was holding the indivdual pieces together making it impossible to eat. big problem, easy fix... just have have the chefs take their time and do a better job cutting them. \n\nbest of luck. looking forward to coming back and eating some more delicious food!", "author": "K D."}

I was looking for sushi on Union Street and thought I'd try this spot because the atmosphere seemed nice. The place was literally empty, and the host, Jeffrey, refused to seat my friend and I side by side at a four top, so we could both enjoy the comfort of the bench seat and watch the Pats game together. When I pointed out (at about 8 p.m), that the restaurant was empty, the host replied that it's the policy of manager not to seat two people at a four top.  When I asked to speak to the manager, Jeffrey replied, \"I am the manager.\" I said, \"so can we both be comfortable?\" and Jeffrey said, \"sorry it's management policy.\" Despite my obvious misgivings, I stayed because we were very hungry. What unfolded was a customer service debacle like I've never experienced in my life.  They delivered orders we didn't make with rotten smelling fish I would not feed to my dog.  They failed to fill my water glass despite several requests for water over a period of two hours.  There were plenty of staff on hand yet I felt all alone.

I figured I would call the restaurant up myself to deliver this feedback as they should know. The woman who answered the phone got very defensive and told me that the fish is always fresh. I was listening to this woman who was doubting my experience and told me to bring it back. I'm sorry - what? You want me to walk all the way back there to show you the fish you just prepared to me? Shall we do a cutting test? Sure I'll go ahead reach out of the garbage repackage it and walk myself up Octavia Street to show you...RIGHT. Then I finally asked to speak with the manager and he was much worse. Talk about poor customer service - he also wanted to see the fish. The most surprising thing is there was NEVER an apology for the inconvenience. I am a marina local and I will never step into this restaurant again and will tell my friends to do the same.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-10-03", "description": "If our food had not been good, I might have just given this place ONE star because the ambiance is SOOO BAD. Let's begin...\n\nOn a Friday night, while looking at the menu from the street, we were skeptical about the music level but we were hungry and wanted sushi so we went in and got a table for 2 just a few feet from the door. The music was as loud - no exaggeration - as most clubs in the city. It was so loud that it was not enough for the waitress to bend over to talk to us. She had to squat down next to me to talk to me and move and squat down next to my boyfriend to take his order. And these tables are not big. They were closer to cocktail tables than dining tables. I asked the waitress if it was always this loud in here and she said during weekdays, it is more quiet. So I asked if they could turn down the music a little just so we wouldn't have to shout and she said no because the tables are so close that they need to music to be loud so that we don't hear other people's conversations. But we couldn't even hear our own conversation with the waitress! I looked down the row of maybe 10 tables and I saw maybe 3 people talking at that moment and it was STILL loud! I think they are over reacting. No other restaurant on Union Street has to blast their music that loud to facilitate private conversations. Do they think we're talking international spy secrets?? And if the number of tables don't change during the week, why isn't it just as loud then? I've seen just as many people there on a Wednesday without the blasting music. They should just own up to the fact that they want to have a showy hip club vibe rather than a restaurant.\n\nThis idea of \"showy\" comes up again later.\n\nSo we get to food/drink. I wish I could say more about the cocktails which I really wanted that night, but I can't because they DIDN'T HAVE A BARTENDER there. They were about one week old at the time and their bartender was already taking a vacation day? We settled for sake. Luckily for them, the food was good. We had a White Angel and Spider roll and one more roll I can't recall. The White Angel was the best. \n\nI do remember the table next to us got something that was lit on fire when it was presented at the table. I asked them later if it was extraordinarily tasty and they said no. It was good but not incredible. I asked the waitress what it was - their Tamashi On Fire signature dish - and how the flame affected the flavor. She said it didn't affect the flavor at all. It was only for presentation. Well, at least they owned up to that one.  \n\nI might have wanted to stay and see what was up for dessert, but I was tired of shouting by that time. If they can control their image-consciousness and turn down the music, I'd go back often. As of yet, I haven't been able to bear it again.", "author": "Maria Y."}
