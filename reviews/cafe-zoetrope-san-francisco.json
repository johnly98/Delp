What lured us in was the building design (reminded me of New York), and decided to give it a try. \n\nOn a Friday night around 830 pm the restaurant was relatively empty. What really impressed me was the decor of the place. It reminded me of something you would see in an old 1920s film and had a European feel to it. (I didnt know the history of this restaurant until now as I'm reading the previous reviews). \n\nMy dad ordered the asado di tira $23 and I got the malfatti gnocchi $16. The ribs were ok. It was a bit on the tougher side, but still tasted good. The gnocchi was good as well. I'm not familiar with Italian food, but I liked it. It was very cheesy and a little heavy in sauce, but to me I would definitely order it again. Their house bread though was very good!!! I don't know what kind of bread they gave us but it was so soft and delicious. \n\nThe table next to us ordered these fancy cocktails that made me think this would be a nice quiet place to start your night if you wanted to barhop later to the more crowded/louder bars further down the street. There is outdoor seating available if you have a friendly pup. Lastly I was also very impressed with the service. All the waiters were really good at consistently making sure that our water were refilled, and making sure everything was ok. \n\nOverall this restaurant is a really cute place to go. In terms of food quality. I think it's more like Italian comfort food. I would recommend this restaurant for a date, or small groups, and would definitely come back!", "author": "Ann T."}

We drove out to the Francis Ford Coppola Vineyards and enjoyed all the movie props and had some great wine with good food. I found out he had a small cafe in San Francisco which we chose to visit on this trip for Bay to Breakers! \n\nWe arrived early and sat at the cozy little bar that had maybe 8 seats around. The surroundings were cozy and the colors were welcoming. We were seated when the two friends arrived in a booth in the corner. We were told this is where Francis Ford Coppola sits when he comes to the restaurant.  There is a rope used to block it off when he is seated.\n\nAs for the food! It was delicious from beginning to end. We each had our own Caesar salad minus the anchovies. Nice large shredded pieces of Parmesan cheese atop homemade dressing. The gnocchi I ordered had spinach and the sauce was so good you didn't want to leave any at the bottom of your bowl. These dishes were shared by all at our table. The wine was wonderful as well. We started with a Malbec and then ordered the Cabernet as suggested by our waiter. Zoetrope. He mentioned the wine is made especially for the cafe and no one else. \n\nWe ordered our last dish which was sweet dessert. Tiramisu and the special. They were as the rest of the meal, tasty and it was hard to share. We finished the evening with a amaretto. A perfect pre race dinner in the Bay Area!", "author": "Mitchie B."}

I wasn't dressed as nicely as most of the other patrons. I wasn't expecting much but when the pizza arrived I couldn't believe how good it looked! It was perfectly crispy, great cheese/distribution. The sauce was fresh and definitely homemade. It was pretty much a cheese pizza and each slice had a piece of fresh basil on it.

We noticed that \"Coppola's\" was now Caf\u00e9 Zoetrope. Thought maybe they have changed ownership (turns out it is stilled owned by Coppola). We arrived around 6:30pm on a Saturday. Only a couple tables had diners, and they sat us toward the back area. The d\u00e9cor is, as it always was, nice, 'old world' style. The Sentinel Building is worth a little history lookup. \nOur server(s) were both very friendly and attentive. We HATED that our table was right next to the bus station (like 2 feet away). So, there was this constant butt facing the table and the never ending clattering as the servers dug in the bin for service ware. On the other hand, each time they were there, they simply spun around and asked if we needed anything....\n\nFood:  This was the unfortunate part of the evening. \n\"lamb wrap\" appetizer was oddly nothing more than ground lamb in a tortilla. HMMM tortilla?\nThe server said it was super thin pizza dough... it was a tortilla... and not very good at that.\nPortobello soup was good, and you get a decent sized bowl of it. I could have / should have gone with just the soup and some bread.\nTheir lasagna special was not baked long enough, and the marinara, which appeared to be made in house, was extremely salty, and literally ruined the dish. No other flavor could complete with the salt. So, an appetizer, soup, salad and two entrees, (no drinks) were $80. A real disappointment.

We were surprised to be seated right away at the table nearest the front door, but it could have accommodated four hefty tourists.\n\nIndeed we counted ourselves lucky, as the rest of the restaurant, at least what we could make of it, was pretty well packed with mostly foreign tourists judging from the animated hand movements and the boxes of Niebaum-Coppola wine being purchased (photo: http://bit.ly/1Mt8ztK). The menu fits on a vertical piece of paper, so there's nothing too fancy here. We started with their self-proclaimed house specialty, The $9 Caesar Salad which they claim originated in this building at Caesar's Grill much to the chagrin of Caesar Cardini presumably, who has the more popular claim of being the Caesar Salad inventor in Tijuana. No matter as it was delicious and decadently creamy with fresh egg yolks and topped abundantly with anchovies (photo: http://bit.ly/1HtLJ3S).\n\nWe also tried the $11 Oven Roasted Calamari which came drizzled in a basil vinaigrette accompanied by Kalamata olives and chopped tomato (photo: http://bit.ly/1TBV7I8). Very rustic, very simple and quite satisfying with the squid pieces quite plump and fresh. For his entree, Jamie went for the $17.50 Spaghetti alla Puttanesca which came mixed in a fresh tomato sauce with olives, capers and chopped garlic (photo: http://bit.ly/1CD9QP1). It reminded us of our good friend Linda's homemade sauce and while nothing could compare to hers, this was pretty darn tasty even if it did seem a bit overpriced. I decided to try the even more decadent $19 Bumbola ai Broccoli e Salsiccia, which was a big bowl of creamy richness due to the ample amount of fontina blended in.\n\nBumbola is a chubby, spiral-shaped pasta that's meant to look like a bumblebee. Soaking up the cream quite easily, it was mixed with broccoli rabe, Italian sausage, red wine and shallots into quite an indulgent mountain of tasty carbs (photo: http://bit.ly/1SmqPGQ). I probably should have entered a decathlon from the abundant portion I received, which explains why both of us bypassed dessert here even though I'm sure something sweetly Neapolitan was probably waiting in the kitchen. Maybe because we were famished when we came in and our go-to Italian options have been dwindling with the recent demise of Stelline, but we frankly liked Coppola's cucina. It was an offer we couldn't refuse.

Really good, friendly service and great pasta. All the pasta is cooked to order and fresh. We came here and their bread basket was freshly baked and warm. I ordered the pasta carbonara and it was really good! They didn't skimp on the bacon and the sauce wasn't overly creamy. A good carbonara relies more on the butter and egg and less on heavy cream, in my opinion. I also loved how it was so nostalgic and quirky.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-18", "description": "This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in San Francisco. I have fond memories there.\n\nThe Good: the food is absolutely delicious. I love the Carbonara, it's the closest to authentic as I can get, since the time my Italian roommate made it for me years ago, this comes close!!! My friends and husband really enjoyed their meals as well. And no one can beat getting sung happy birthday surrounded by Francis For Coppola memorabilia and trophies... I appreciated the staff singing happy birthday and even cutting my cake!!!\n\nThe bad: Our server was personality wise great! No qualms here. Only thing was the wait times, partially our fault,as we were waiting for the rest of party to get there before ordering. Getting their attention proved to be a bit hard as well. Nothing too horrendous to keep me from returning.\n\nThe Ugly: we were seating in a awkward corner of the restaurant that placed one of my friends in direct line of the walkway. Getting elbowed by another guest settling into their seat at the bar. Getting service was a bit tough, and they kept mistaking our order with the table seated to our right, we ordered similarly yet, our food was taken to their table and theirs to ours... training is key!!! \nLastly I asked for my food robbed boxed to go, yet my food never made it back to me. It wasn't until we walked up to a cafe, that we realized they never returned our left overs- it was a lot of pasta since I filled up on bread (they charge $3) while i waited for my food. I had to call and check to see if they still had it, they didn't, BUT offered me a free replacement \n\nOverall, if you're looking for impeccable service, you won't be satisfied here, but if you can deal with lackluster service and get delicious food then this is a good once in a while spot to enjoy a seat through memory lane while coaxing up with an espresso and a copy of the latest Zoetrope magazine.", "author": "Zareth F."}

I had no idea what this place was, other than my wife saw it from the street and she thought it looked nice. So this review will NOT be based on any film fandom.\n\nThe place is SMALL inside, which isn't too unusual for San Francisco, but you'd be hard pressed to bring a big group here. Most of the tables are for 2-4. Since we had our infant daughter with us, they sat us in a back area away from the few other couples in there. Not unusual and not a problem. Unfortunately, even though all the service had to walk right by us to head downstairs (where the kitchen is?), we seldom got attention. Service was fair to poor.\n\nThe food was a mixed bag. I really loved the caesar salad. Honestly, it was the best I've had in years, maybe ever! But the calzone was just ewww. I was interested in seeing how it would be with ricotta cheese (as well as mozzarella), but it was just bad. Moreover, the crust was folded way too far in, and there was not nearly enough ham. The wine selection was good though, and the sampler option was great. It helped wash away the calzone (that's a plus?).\n\nThe interior was definitely interesting with lots to look at. But that can't make up for the food/service.", "author": "Jason U."}

The first time we were supposed to go to a different restaurant near by but they had to close, so we came here. Good food good service. Then last night we were in the area and tried to go to two different spots but each had a 20 minute wait so we came here. So worth it! We walked in and we're automatically greated with a smile and felt welcomed. They said about a 5 minute wait for a table so we sat outside to check the menu. Some older gentleman were out there chatting and enjoying themselves and sparked a convo with us. Then our table was ready. We asked for the waiters recommendations and we pretty much ordered all of them. Everything was excellent. Of course we all tried each others. The porterhouse was seasoned perfect, not too much, had a great meat taste with a slight char. The mario pizza with a huge slice of sausage was delish. The rib appetizer was tender and tasty and the linguini with clams was on point.\nNot only was the food great but the service was on point. Being a native to the city I have seen and felt a huge change. A great division in cultures and classes. Coming here reminded me of home. Of what it used to be like in the city.

I never post on Yelp, but felt compelled to after this dinner. Having worked in the restaurant industry for 9+ years, this was totally unacceptable and disappointing. Not only did the waiters barely engage in conversation, but also seemed stoned or just absent. \n\nRegarding the food: appalling. You can tell it's an amateur chef that unfortunately has gotten lazy. The grilled calamari salad was tough as rubber bands, and served with underripe tomatoes...sloppy. The Bumbola pasta was a disaster - undercooked pasta, and a sauce that looked and tasted like skim milk and red wine mixed together, and not even cooked or reduced. The pizza was crispy, but lacked flavor and seasoning.\n\nAs a very forgiving and frequent diner in this city, it's unacceptable to serve this kind of food to locals OR tourists who come because it is in fact the Coppola's building and restaurant.

It is after lunch after all. The waitress comes by and takes our orders. Some of us order beers, others order soups, some of us order entr\u00e9es, and others are there just to talk about writing. \n\nAfter the waitress takes the orders, she leaves, and a male server with curly blond hair comes by and gives us a lecture, stating that we can't come here every single month and take up space because we're a restaurant, we know it's called a caf\u00e9, but we're here to make money, we're here to serve food, not just bowls of soup. \n\nWe were all embarrassed because we knew that we weren't really there to eat the food, but we did order food and we did spend money. And that's not the biggest issue because as I looked around the restaurant, we took up less than half of the capacity of the caf\u00e9. \n\nI would understand if the restaurant was full, and I would also understand if there's a line outside waiting for tables, but that simply wasn't the case. And the few hours we were there, there were many seats that remained available. \n\nThe plain fact was, had we not been there, they would've not gotten any of the revenue or the tips that we generously gave, despite the curly blond waiter's diatribe against our being there.\n\nAdded on top of this guy's anger, other servers also looked at us, giving us the stink eye. I'm not sure Francis Ford Coppola would appreciate his waiters treating customers like this, but then I doubt anything is going to be done, since the wait staff hasn't changed since the past year that we've been there. \n\nUnfortunately, I won't be recommending this place to any of my friends traveling to San Francisco, since there are about 3000 other restaurants they can go to.", "author": "Jimmy N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-08-11", "description": "Where do I even begin on one of the absolute worst meals I've ever eaten in the bay area? Is that an exaggeration? Absolutely not! We met friends at this caf\u00e9 last night in hopes of having an excellent meal. From the very start when our waiter, Jafar, greeted us I knew there were going to be problems. He walked around like he was in a daze and had no idea what was going on. Our friends had arrived first and ordered drinks and a Caesar salad. When we arrived 10 minutes after them, we sat down and were given menus. Their Caesar salads were served within five minutes of us receiving our menus. We tried to order quickly to catch up. So all four of us placed our entr\u00e9e order and my boyfriend and I placed our order for the same Caesar salad.  Thirty minutes later, here come our entrees!! When I asked Jafar where my salad was, he said he didn't know we ordered salads. He wrote it down so how could he not have known?  It was that daze he was in! We sent the entr\u00e9es back which was a big mistake.  They just put them under a heat lamp of course. 15 minutes later here come our Caesar salads. I was like you got to be kidding me! We ate the so-so Caesar salad, but it was very wilted. Next, they brought the meals that they were trying to serve us a half an hour prior. Can you say gross? I ordered chicken cacciatore. I have never seen chicken cacciatore with just a leg and a thigh! It usually comes with chopped up chicken breast. It was in a disgusting brown sauce and the potatoes were extremely undercooked. I didn't want to bother Jafar with sending it back, because I may never see the food or him ever again. Next thing you know, he's bringing wine to  our table that we didn't order. What a sloppy mess! Because our meals were barely edible, we decided to try the dessert. It was at that point that I realized I must have been a glutton for punishment. I ordered a cannoli which was pretty good. My friends and my boyfriend ordered pie that was on the menu. Two of our menus said Apple pie, two of our menus said pear pie. When Jafar went to find out what the pie really was he came back and said it was peach pie! Another disaster. The peach pie was a pile of peaches thrown on a plate. There was no crust! It was disgusting. I can't believe Francis Ford Coppola puts his name on this place. I'm just a regular gal and I would never claim to own this joint. We are members of Francis Ford Coppola's winery which is excellent.  While we love the wines, we're curious as to why he keeps this dump open. It really had a dingy look and feel to it and the food and service were awful. The best was when my boyfriend asked Jafar where the men's room was. Jafar repeated, men's room? Men's room? I mean, is that a difficult question? Trust me people, stay away from this joint.

I only had this thought upon entering because it looked impossibly busy and I was starving! To my surprise and delight our hostess greeted us at the door after a couple of seconds and was able to get us a little private booth for two in the right corner of the restaurant. It was a perfect little booth close to the bar but also with a window view to keep claustrophobia at bay.\n\nComplimentary bread with oil/balsamic is served and the male server brought our waters and menus out immediately. The menu has some interesting appetizers, pizzas, and the normal Italian fare. We were in the mood for pasta so I decided on the spaghetti with meatballs and my BF got the Linguini Vongole. To drink we went with waters and a tasting of 3 wines.\n\nWhile waiting for food we did some people watching and observed that the waitstaff seemed to be on their game for the most part. I read that some other reviews found the staff to be distant or cold, even rude, this was not our experience. Our main server was a bit dry but polite nonetheless and the others were perfectly cordial and friendly. The bar scene was interesting; this seems to be a trendy little watering hole for some of the locals and you are in such proximity to others due to the size of the restaurant that you cannot help but be part of their conversations at times. Definitely entertaining.\n\nThe wines arrived first (the pasta is cooked fresh to order and takes at least 20 minutes), we sampled a Syrah, a Malbec, and a Zinfandel which were all good. The Syrah was my favorite, although I would not call myself a wine enthusiast.\n\nWhen the food came, I could not have been happier with the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs are a house specialty and mixture of beef, pork, and veal which were delicious and the sauce was fantastic;very rustic but light and flavorful at the same time. My BF was not as much of a fan of the Linguini Vongole (with clams). The pasta was a bit more Al Dente than he prefers and the white wine butter sauce was a bit thin and did not really adhere to the noodle at all. The clams were really irrelevant to the dish in terms of flavor and instead just got in the way.\n\nAll in all I gave the restaurant 4 stars because the ambiance, service, and overall experience were all good.

Here's my tips to the wait staff for things they should do without customers having to ask:\n\n* great that the hot food is delivered hot, but when the bus-person brings the dishes to the table, have a system so you know who gets what, don't keep showing up asking \"who ordered ____\" for every dish that comes!\n\n* when a party orders entrees, wine and appetizers all around, fill the bread basket when it's empty\n\n* check on us at some point during the meal to make sure everything is OK\n\n* when someone orders a liter of sparkling water, bring glasses (or did you expect us to drink the tap water in order to empty those glasses?)", "author": "Laurel L."}

It has a very old school vibe and my girlfriend and I just love it. We recently were here last Thursday, and the food as alway was excellent! Also, at the beginning of the meal they usually bring you fresh warm bread for the table! Im not usually excited about bread, but I dont know any other restaurant in San Francisco that does that. Regarding the menu items, I've tried about half the menu, but my go to is usually the Linguine alle Vongele and my girlfriend often gets the Spaghetti Classico.  Both are terrific! Probably my favorite Italian Restaurant in North Beach!  Anyway, if your looking for a more authentic/San Francisco Italian Restaurant experience, then go here (also if you are a fan of Francis Ford Coopla and his movies, as this is HIS restaurant).", "author": "Matt L."}

No problem getting a table, and I can see why now.\n\nThe food was so-so; no major complaints, but nothing to brag on either.  \n\nWhat ruined the evening was the customer service.  Walked into the tiny front room (where only two tables were occupied) and I see three staff standing behind the bar.  Two of them make eye contact, then look away.  After a minute of standing there, I approach the woman behind the counter and ask if we are supposed to just seat ourselves.  She looks at me and mutters - \"Oh, two for dinner.\"  \n\nOur waiter was Luke, who initially seemed pretty attentive ( I overheard him flirting with a table of women nearby and I think he gave them a complimentary apertif).  We quickly learned that Luke wasn't very interested in service.  He spent most of the time eating his own meal at the bar and talking with the other staff.  The most activity I saw from him was when a friend of his came in the door.  He ran to the front door, hugged the guy, and then had a nearly 10-minute conversation with him about a car that he's restoring.  This happened about five feet from our table, and he had his back to the customers the whole time.  When he was done with this conversation, he wandered over to a table and said \"do you know what you'd like yet?\"  Thankfully someone behind the bar had already taken this table's order.\n\nThroughout the time we were there several friends of the staff came in, who also received their obligatory hugs and banter in the middle of the paying customers, and they took seats at the bar and continued to talk with the staff.  These friends seemed to receive great attention and service, which is great for them, bot not so good for those of us who don't have previous relationships. \n\nSo, Mr. Coppola, I thought your restaurant looked very cool, lots of great pics and memorabilia, awesome building, but you need to clean house and start over with the staff.  The place has the feel of a restaurant that has definitely seen its better days and is on a fast downhill slope.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-01", "description": "I've been meaning to try Cafe Zoetrope for years, so with no other plans or company last night, I decided to settle in there and enjoy. I'm glad I did.\n\nThe ambience is very casual and relaxed. It was a beautiful night, so the open doors made it nice inside, too. They sat me at a table in the back. At first I was disappointed and thinking of switching. Since I was eating alone, I thought I could at least enjoy people-watching instead of staring at the walls or my iPhone.\n\nAfter a few minutes I forgot about that, because the wait staff were very attentive and friendly. Even the waiters who weren't serving my table would walk by and make a joke or ask how things were. I got the feeling that everyone that worked there was family, or at least enjoyed working together.\n\nI had the Penne all' Arrabbiata and two glasses of the '08 Syrah FC Private Reserve. The penne came out steaming hot and fresh, and I had to wait a few minutes before I could eat. It was delicious and very spicy (I was sweating halfway through). It's hit or miss to order a simple dish like penne and marinara, because some restaurants can make it bland and watery. This penne was done just right and the sauce was thick and hearty - but still very fresh. It had nice chunks of garlic that melted in my mouth. When I was done I had bread left, so I ate up the rest of the sauce with it.\n\nWriting this, I'm getting hungry again.\n\nThe wine was great, too. I like Coppola wines at home but I hadn't tried their Syrah. I'll definitely look for this one in the store. It was bold but not too fruity and went nicely with the spicy pasta. A lot of restaurants will give you a little more than a taste when you order by the glass, but they gave me a full pour on both glasses.\n\nThe couple sitting next to me really enjoyed their food, too (I asked). A few tables down it looked like a girls night out, and they seemed to be having a great time joking with their waiter and asking him about wines.\n\nLast week a friend and I sat at the bar and had a drink, but no food. The bartender was friendly and it had the same ambience all around. However, I wish I had just ordered wine instead of the cocktail. I got an Old Fashioned and the bartender plopped in a whole orange slice, squirted in a ton of soda and lots of ice. Instead of being a compliment to the whiskey, the orange just made it all too bitter. So I would be cautious about getting cocktails. Next time I will just order a scotch or whiskey, neat.\n\nBesides our bar experience, I was very impressed by Cafe Zoetrope. It's in a touristy area and yes, it's full of Coppola-belia, but it stands on its own as a great place for a real Italian meal experience.", "author": "D.J. B."}

The design is so unique and for whatever reason, it just looks like a building in SF that you could only find in this border FiDi/North Beach/Chinatown area.\n\nDespite knowing ahead of time that their pizzas are supposed to be pretty good (and they are), I opted for the Spaghetti alla Carbonara Classico - Spaghetti with Niman Ranch guanciale (bacon), egg, ground black pepper and pecorino romano.  Now, if looks were ever deceiving, this would be a perfect example of that.  The bowl comes out looking really modest, but it's really not my friends.  I was pretty damn hungry, and I still left a few bites behind.  For me, I did have a small knock or two against the dish, but part of it was my own fault too.  Guanciale is obviously salty in nature so that was a given, but it also felt a little burned...sort of like eating oily pork rinds.  The other thing was me screwing up - I had the waiter sprinkle on some parmesan cheese, but I failed to stop him in time and ended up with a cheesier pasta than I would have liked.  Whoops on me.\n\nAs for their pizza, I definitely want to come back for more.  My friend next to me ordered the Pizza Funghi e Salsicce - Italian sausage, mushroom, mozzarella and parmigiano.  Man, that thing looked crazy delicious, and that small bite I had certainly brought the goods.  The best part was there was little to no red sauce either - woohoo!

So when Jole S. mentioned he had a Bloomspot deal for pizza and wine in North Beach I was all ears, and we finally put it to use last night with awesome results. When we arrived were were seated immediately and got instant attention from our server, which continued through the night. Our deal included a bottle of Coppola's Directors Cut (Jole chose the cabernet) and a pizza--we went for the meatball. \n\nIt wasn't the best pizza I've ever had, but it was good and my side of braised escarole made it easy to stick to my diet plan in a carb-rich environment. I also found the space to be totally welcoming. Its obviously Coppola-centric--the walls are covered in their wines and there are movie posters and cool photos all around, but it doesn't rise to a Planet Hollywood level of annoyance. The space combined with the company made it an evening I'm looking forward to recreating.", "author": "Lesly S."}

While normally, my friend and I put up with the slow, inattentive service, as we aren't too needy during our meal, this last time, they were outright rude. The restaurant wasn't busy when I went to go pick up my order, but when I tried nicely to get the waiter's attention (there isn't a conventional hostess stand), he aggressively stuck a finger in my face as if it to say \"1 minute.\" To give the establishment credit, it is always this same busboy that is quite rude. He then returned with a to-go bag and dropped it on the bar without a word. I have no idea how he assumed this was my order, which it wasn't, but after 10 more minutes of trying to get someone's attention to maybe receive and pay for my correct order, I gave up and went across the street to Brioche, the friendliest place in the area, with GREAT sandwiches, soups, breads, desserts, etc.", "author": "Emily U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-06", "description": "It seems to be a trend these days for celebrities to open their own restaurants. Justin Timberlake has Southern Hospitality, Eva Longoria has Beso, and Ashton Kutcher has Dolce, to name just a few. These Hollywood youngsters may be taking a cue from Francis Ford-Coppola, who has owned Cafe Zoetrope (formerly Cafe Niebaum-Coppola) in North Beach since 1999.\n\nCoppola's Italian eatery is nestled on the ground floor of Columbus Tower, the top floors of which house Coppola's American Zoetrope studio. The readers of California Home & Design recently voted Columbus Tower their favorite building in San Francisco, and it is truly spectacular at night, with the oxidized copper facade emitting a soft green glow that is starkly juxtaposed with the night sky, the bright lights of Columbus Street, and the silhouette of the nearby Transamerica Pyramid.\n\nWhile I've always been somewhat disappointed that you aren't greeted with a massive poster of The Godfather immediately upon entering, the inside of the restaurant is still a film buff's dream, with the walls adorned with movie posters, photos of Coppola himself, and various other pieces of motion picture paraphernalia. The back wall is lined with bottles upon bottles of different wines from Coppola's Napa Valley vineyard. There's a small red booth tucked into a corner of the restaurant which is reserved for Coppola in the event that he's in town and chooses to eat there, and it is literally roped off until the servers get the green light to seat other diners there. All in all, Cafe Zoetrope is one of those restaurants that, delicious food aside, is worth visiting just for the decor and atmosphere.\n\nThat being said, the food is nothing to sneeze at, either. At a post-movie dinner the other night, my fellow diners and I (happily seated in Coppola's booth!) started off with a bottle of the Sofia Coppola Blanc de Blancs champagne and the Picada Tray, which was filled with mixed olives, salami and prosciutto, four different types of cheese, and more. This was a perfect appetizer for a table of four, whetting our appetites for what was to come, but not filling us up too much.\n\nWhen it came to the entrees, I ordered the penne all'arrabbiata, which was met with an approving nod from our server. My fellow diners opted for the Argentine-style short ribs, spaghetti with veal and pork meatballs, and the spinach and ricotta \"malfatti\" dumplings in a blended tomato and cream sauce. I tried a bite of everyone's dish, and while I found the meatballs to be a bit dry, everything else was quite good. I personally think I had the winning dish, with a wonderfully spicy and flavorful arrabbiata sauce topping house-made penne, which was flawlessly al dente. The short ribs were cooked deliciously with a tasty chimichurri flavoring, and the oversized malfatti dumplings were soft and fluffy. Considering the quality of our entrees, the dessert menu was impossible to resist, so we all split a chocolate tartufo as the perfect ending to the meal.\n\nThe other night was just one out of dozens of times that I've been to Cafe Zoetrope, and it's never disappointed. Good food, good wine, good atmosphere, and the glimmer of hope that Coppola might walk through the door at any moment? No complaints here.", "author": "Katherine K."}

I ordered chicken scarpiello. The dish had obviously been microwaved. The sausage that was sitting on top of the broth was dry and flavorless. Everything under the broth, including the chicken, was rubbery (and also flavorless). The vegetables tasted frozen, although it's difficult to be sure after they've been nuked. The dish was brought out almost instantly after ordering. There is no way they could have cooked any part of this dish to order.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered gnocchi malfatti. The gnocchi were stuffed with ricotta cheese, which is kind of an odd idea but might have been interesting if prepared well. Unfortunately, the gnocchi were soft almost to the point of being runny. It was like eating little balls of baby food. They were also cold in the middle and you could clearly taste the freezer burn. \n\nIt's as if Cafe Zoetrope isn't even trying to hide the fact that they are serving frozen, reheated food.

Been meaning to check it out for years and I did admire the Beautiful and historical building with great ambiance and Coppolla memorabilia but the quality of the food, is just ok at best. All I tried was the pizza but theoilive oil in itself that came with the bread wasn't the right color to my liking, I can tell its not good quality and had no smell. Its not the pole that works there fault. They don't buy the food. Whoever buys the ingredients to make the food needs a bigger budget. Someone needs to okay that considering the prices they charge. I am no chef but my issue is that I feel that all you need is some decent extra virgin olive oil (it doesn't have to be the most expensive but not the cheapest either) some decent Parmigaiano reggiano , some decent mozzarella, some oregano, etc. (I don't taste ANY herds in my pizza which is a big non no) and even if you slapped all that on a plate, you would have a sloppy mess buts lotsa flavor. The pizza no flavor no good. \nThey charge $16 a pizza well I got there before 5 so they have a $9 special, if it wasn't for that I would be really annoyed. I dint try the Prosciutto. I did vegetarian with basil but there was like 2 leaves. I asked to add anchovies for flavor, they were over salted and not stored in olive oil I could tell and that is a necessity. Also, it is quite stuffy in there, very warm. They need to ventilate the place. I get that red wine isn't served chilled but it tasted way too warm, I couldn't enjoy which is annoying since I purposely ordered a Malbec that you cannot purchase at retail so more expensive....sigh. I can be wrong, maybe I was off but the quality of the ingredients that go into the pizza isn't that good so the product isn't that good.

It worked. This place is pretty compact so don't plan on having any conversations about anything private and don't expect on just walking in randomly during dinner hours. Make reservations! \n\nThe food was good but nothing special or anything extraordinary. We did enjoy the Caesar salad and the picada tray and as always we LOVED the wine. They also have wine from their sister winery, Rubicon Estate. The service was just at par with acceptable (for 3 waiters and a small place it seemed as if they were a bit flustered during dinner hours). The ambiance is so cool. You feel like Coppola's at the next table or maybe just upstairs. His presence is known and it's really special to sit and hang out. Come here for the experience, small bites and of course wine, not the entrees. \n\nOh and if you're a native San Franciscan like myself be prepared to be moderately annoyed by the tourists who speak NO english and tend to be rude. We sat between a French and German couples who definitely didn't read the American etiquette part of their tourist books.", "author": "Kristen R."}

It's canned tomato saucified food with little love or flare given the amount you pay.\r\n\r\nUltimately, you are paying for the historical building that you are eating in: yes, that tall ancient sea green building that makes one wonder: \"how is that building going to stay up when the next major earthquake hits?\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, the building goes back to the 1906 Earthquake and has a fascinating history.  The Kingston Trio used to record music in this building, and, the building was where the sound mixing for \"Apocalypse Now!\" was done.  The Godfather's very own  Francis Ford Coppola has owned this building since the 70s.\r\n\r\nThe interior has what I believe to be an Art Deco vibe.  Lots of checker this'es and thats.\r\n\r\nImagine food sold at the Spaghetti Factory, and then double the prices.  Now you see why I can only give this place two Stars.\r\n\r\nWhen you go there, because I recommend you try it at least once, ask for information on the history of the building.

We split into to table of 5 people we all ordered different type of pizzas and one of my friends ordered a glass of wine. The waiter was high on most probably weed and when he brought the napkin wrapped forks and spoons, he dropped them. Second he brought my friend's glass of wine but he somehow hit the glass to the table that it got chipped on the side. One of my friends and I , we ordered pizza Napoli and it was super salty and the crust was dry and I couldn't eat the edges of the crust because it was all burned. Then the brought the gratuity included bill and they charged us almost $30 for tips. I thinks it wasn't cool that they didn't separate the bill. it was kind of outrageous.

This restaurant is owned by Francis Ford Coppola, and they serve a ton of his wine. When I went here when I was younger the place was described to me simply. When Francis is in town he needed a place to have a good meal where he could sit and relax so he bought up the old building and turned it into a wonderful cafe. His favorite place to sit is on the Kearny side of the building all the way down. It's a very sheltered little seat, and a lunch outdoors is terrific.\n\nIt was just a few hours before my birthday when we entered the restaurant. I sat down and asked the waiter for some wine with dinner, he made a suggestion of a red and I agreed. He brought the wine over and it was fantastic!\n\nWe were nibbling on the bread as we poured over the menu, and ultimately decided on the Quattro Formaggi (Four chesse) and Al Proscuitto (Proscuitto and mushrooms) pizzas.\n\nThey came back in about twenty minutes, and we began to dissect them. The Quattro Formaggi is a delicate balance of four exquisite italian cheeses, on a wonderful crust with delicious tomato sauce. The al Proscuitto is a white pizza with mushrooms and Proscuitto. Absolutely delicious. Great tasting Proscuitto, funghi to die for and a perfectly cooked crust. The wine was a perfect compliment.\n\nAll in all a great meal in a spectacular atmosphere.

It gets crowded during the evening and night time. \n\nMy gf and I had to wait about fifteen minutes because there wasn't any tables available and we didn't want to eat our meals outside so we didn't mind waiting. While we were waiting, an employee brought us a complementary wine. I thought that was nice just to keep us a bit warm with some house wine. \n\nWe decided to order just one pizza and share it. We agreed on ordering the Pizza Quattro Stagioni. The pizza did come out fairly quick so I was happy about that. The pizza was good, however, it did have a complete different flavor to it that I have never experienced in my life. The olives really gave it a twist. It was a good experience and I wasn't too fond of it but it was good. Too bad I wasn't starving, otherwise I would have ordered two pizzas and an appetizer. \n\nOur pizza came out to $14 which I didn't think it was too bad. It is a restaurant in downtown and it has the Coppola name to it as well. For the size and unique style of Italian pizza, it was a reasonable price. \n\nI liked the way I felt inside. All the portraits, memorabilia, dimmed lighting, tone of the room, the vibe I got from all the customers enjoying themselves made it a great warm atmosphere to be in. If I lived in San Francisco, I would love to stop by here on the weekend, have some drinks with some friends and then head out to some clubs.

Some places are so highly rated that you expect nothing less than food fitting for the Olympians.  Sometimes going into a restaurant with that mindset can skew your tastebuds.  As a result, it is refreshing to enter a domain with no previous knowledge and just let your tastebuds go on a blind date.  There is a certain joy of meandering around, choosing a place to eat on an impulsive whim.  \n\nIt was one of my good friend's bdays, who happened to have just broken up with his gf who didn't even wish him a happy birthday.  That witch!!!  A broken heart requires an obligatory shoulder to cry on and some sustenance in one's stomach.  Walking through the FiDi, haf-listening, half-day dreaming, we ended up at North Beach.  Seeing a bustling Italian place, we entered Cafe Zoetrope.  A waitress immediately seated us and delivered our orders, speaking in what seemed like an authentic Italian accent.  Shriveling my heard around, I saw many old pictures on the wall and learned that this restaurant was owned by Francis Coppola.  I ordered the Pizza Quattro Formaggi (tomatoe, gargonzola, fontina, teleggio and mozerella) while said chum ordered the spaghetti.  Our food took a while to come out so I just dined on bread while I listened to my buddy's tale of woe.  Our waitress was very gracious, even alerting me when my jacked slipped off the backing of the chair onto the floor, re-racking for me.  I wish I could say the same for the food, which I found very lackluster.  I had no complaint about the wait; the restaurant was semi-crowded and I know home-style Italian food takes a little longer.  The pizza tasted like a very thin cheese pizza.  It was visually appealing with the thin crust I like and devoid of all that dripping grease that your household pizzerias have, however, the taste wasn't that much different than your run of the mill cheese pizza.  I tried my friend's spaghetti and while you could tell the to tomatoes were very fresh, it just tasted ordinary.  A meatball would have helped.  It is quite a bummer to eat a plateful of just pasta and tomato sauce.  The dish was also quite small for 15 greenbacks.  While I can see this place as being trendy and a nice plan to share a glass of wine, Cafe Zoetrope's food is painfully average and you might as well go to Olive Garden and save yourself a couple bucks.", "author": "Brian V."}

Food took way too long and we waited 15 minutes for mojitos, which were the single best thing we had. For dinner we had an arugula covered pizza w prociuto that had way too much arugula. After drizzling olive oil over the pizza it was pretty damned good.  We also had a clam linguine pasta that desperately needed red pepper flakes, parmesean, salt and pepper. \n\nIn short, we had to do way too much work to get our food where it needed to be.

Now, normally, when I order some sort of sampler appetizer item (especially meat and cheese plates,) the server gives you a little detail on what he's laid in front of you. For example: \"This is a Chevre with herbs and blah blah from Oregon, this is a prosciutto di parma from blah blah and is one of my personal favorites....\" etc etc. You get the picture.\n\nWe then followed up with entrees.

Though, I might normally find Frank Sinatra playing a bit cliche, it was comforting in this cozy, and oddly shaped restaurant. Bottles of wine lined the walls, and the mosaic floor was unique without trying too hard. The tables are a tight squeeze, and perhaps uncomfortable if I were there at night, with parties on either side of me.\n My server seemed distracted by the guy yelling at him from the kitchen, and was walking around as I attempted to give him my order, I simply waited for him to be still before I continued. The voice coming from the downstairs area, where the kitchen was, did not bother me, in fact it was charming in its own stereotypical \"loud Italian\" way. However, what did bother me, was the food.\n The salad was fine, the ingredients were fresh, and I enjoyed it with a few pieces of bread in olive oil. My entree was a different story. The sauce was bland, the linguine were not cooked completely and, the clams, other than drowning in white wine, were not salvation for this poorly executed dish.\n As I finished my meal, I overheard a conversation between three men (whom I like to think of as Gino, Carlo, and Michael) at the bar, which is small, but impressive in its variety of liqueurs. Their conversation made me smile, I felt like I was really in Italian town, and I wondered if this was a real conversation happening at this very moment. Could I be the lucky eavesdropper who overheard these real life Dons talking about \"The Family\"? Or was this an act they put on for all their customers? All I needed to hear next was \"Go to the Mattresses\", and my lunch at Zoetrope would have been redeemed. Unfortunately that did not happen. The best part of my visit to Francis Ford Coppola's San Francisco location was music and the people, sadly not having anything to do with the food.\n Though nothing blew me away food wise, I would gladly return to this cozy hideout, for a casual afternoon lunch. I would not, however, take anyone I was trying to impress, like a client for work, or a first or second date.", "author": "Kierke P."}

It's a bummer that this cafe/restaurant has to occupy the base of the historical Sentinel Building. The feeling when my girlfriend and I walked in was immediately off putting (should have taken this as a sign) but we decided to get an espresso anyway (I would not recommend getting food here). They are located in a nice area and we wanted to sit outside to enjoy the sunshine. The espresso looked/tasted like watered down coffee and had no crema. We asked them to remake it but the second attempt was even worse than the first. The servers obviously had not been trained in how to use the machine or just didn't care to use the machine the proper way when pulling an espresso shot. When the barista was tamping down the ground coffee I watched carefully and I don't think I've ever seen anyone apply such little pressure or put in so little effort when doing such a simple task. We ended up just leaving our drinks outside on the table and headed to Bask across the street which was a much more pleasant experience. We used to pass American Zoetrope all the time when we would go to this area remarking how cute it was and how we should stop by sometime. Well now we know.

The bussers appeared to be so deep in conversation with each other and enraptured with polishing glasses that they couldn't be bothered by our existence, much less our needs. I have to say, I saw them ignore our waiter's requests for their assistance with an equal level of complete dismissal.\n\nThe food was very fresh and savory, simply prepared with just the perfect amount of olive oil and lemon; presentation was a basic white plated here it is.  Seemed just right for the bistro ambiance and the straightforward dishes. Prices were reasonable for freshly prepared tasty Italian fare in a landmark North Beach cafe. \n\nI would add that when my macchiato appeared it was dry foam-as-a-filter, not-a-puddle perfection exactly as ordered and as ninety percent of the valencia barristas cannot *ahem Rituals* produce. That added a Star from three to four right there. I am not shouting bravissimo, but I am smiling with inner abandon. maybe better this joy held back a little.\n\nSo if you have a leisurely afternoon to indulge your idle hunger, wander in.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-05-21", "description": "I was so disappointed by this place.  I came on Sunday 5/20, Bay to Breakers day, at 2pm.  There were 3 tables filled.  When I entered, I was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar, and I said no, I was here for lunch and preferred a table.  No problem, I was seated at a table, and sat there for the next 10 minutes waiting for someone to bring me a menu, or water, or acknowledge that I was there.  Never happened.  So I got up and searched someone out for a menu.  A few minutes later, I had a few questions for the server, which he answered.  When asked if he would recommend the short ribs, he said they were very fatty-about 50% fat-and gave me the impression that no, he would not recommend the ribs.  I asked about the special pasta of the day and he said it was in a very rich sauce, very heavy, and also gave me the impression he would not recommend it.  OK, so I asked about the special grilled chicken salad and the muffaletta.  He said both were good so that's what I ordered.\n\nI waited over 20 minutes for the salad.  I wasn't in a hurry, so that's OK, but given how slow the restaurant was, it seemed odd.  The people next to me, who came in after me and ordered after me, were already done with their pizza and I was still waiting to be served anything.  Well, hopefully the wait would be worthwhile.  It wasn't.  The chicken was cut into small greatly over-cooked pieces which had no flavor except dried out chicken.  And very skimpy on the amount.  There were also \"caramelized onions\" which were simply burned onions.  So $11 for a salad with maybe 1 ounce of dried out chicken, and a few pieces of burned onion.  Great.\n\nThe muffaletta ($18) comes in quarter, half and whole sizes.  The whole is supposed to be $18, but  they charged me $20 for it, since I asked for it \"to go\".  I've never paid higher prices for a to order, but OK.  Well, that muffaletta was one bad sandwich.  A classic muffaletta (which this is supposed to be) comes on a round loaf of bread, with at least 1 1/4 pounds of meat and cheeses, and an olive spread.  The bread was good and true to a muffaletta, but the amount of meats and cheeses--maybe 1/2 pound for this large loaf, were so skimpy and so tasteless.  And the olive spread (in this case mushrooms spread) was also so skimpy that depending upon which quarter of the sandwich you ate, you may not have gotten any of the spread.\n\nI am totally amazed that people gave this place good reviews.  Maybe I ordered the wrong items, but that does not excuse the poor service.  There are so many good places to eat in North Beach,I can only assume people come here for the FFC connection-so if you want poor over priced food with terrible service but some pictures of FFC, this is the place.\n\nAs I was leaving, the people next to me were leaving too, and I asked how their pizza was; they said they didn't even bother finishing it, it was so bad.", "author": "Dan L."}

The interior is a bit cramped, but there's also alfresco dining if you don't mind the steady flow of traffic coming at you from three different directions. Since both the building and bistro are owned by Francis Ford Coppola, whose American Zoetrope offices are situated above, the renowned director is often on the premises. The menu includes family recipes for mostly northern Italian favorites. One exception is the muffaletta - the classic New Orleans sandwich of mozzarella, ham, mortadella, and salami with an olive topping - a whole one of which easily can feed a family of four. Among the pasta options is an outstanding Penne all' Arrabbiata, with a spicy sauce comprised of tomatoes, olives, capers, and garlic. I haven't tried any of the wide array of pizzas, but the Calzone Ripieno, stuffed with tomatoes, mozzarella, salami, ham, mushroom, and artichokes, is excellent and large enough for two to share. Not surprisingly, the spotlight is on wines from Niebaum-Coppola in the Napa Valley.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-11-18", "description": "Go for the atmosphere.  It's a very unique building with cute little tables and lots of windows.  The outdoor seating is lovely if the weather is nice.  The pizza was delicious and the caesar salad is a must have.  Lots of wine choices and a table roped off in case Francis Ford Coppola ever stops in (which he sometimes does).  A little pricey with slow service, but definitely worth it.", "author": "Brig M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-09-08", "description": "I went here for a glass of wine on a sunny afternoon, enjoying a chat with this place's friendly patrons. However the claret was served at room temperature, which was somewhere like 80 degrees that day. Ladies and gentlemen, red wine is often best served at room temperature indeed, but that is French countryside room temperature on an average day of the year. And that is more like 63 degrees.", "author": "Rene V."}

It was a quiet night in the restaurant so the food came out very quickly, great specials and they make a great Cesar salad. It's nice to have some of the N/C wines that are not available at retail without having to go to the winery.", "author": "Whitney P."}

I come here for the ambiance, service, and of course... the food. When I am dining by myself, this is my no.1 place I think of. Beautiful building throughout and damn good everything else. I get a bowl of spagetti with meat balls and wash it down with a glass of claret. The zabanyoni with fruit it just the thing if there is still room in your belly. When I want a change I order the antipasti platter instead of the meat ball with spagetti. The cheese is heaven and the eggplant spread (I normally hate eggplant!) is great with the bread brought to your table. All in all, a very high rating! Enjoy!", "author": "Charise B."}

I've been here at least 20 times during my San Francisco years, and I have always had a wonderful time. They serve the best Spaghetti Carbonara outside of Italy. It's made with ground black pepper, Guanciale (Italian Speck) and Pecorino Romano (Italian cheese). Or try the Pizza Sofia with prosciutto, arugula, and parmigiano. They also have great salads, especially the Radicchio Treviso with orange and balsamic dressing. I miss this place so much.", "author": "Sandra R."}

I only ate there once, on a weeknight when it was quieter, and had a nice time of it.

The decor is world class, with the incredible sense of being in Coppola's directorial studio. The service, however, is mixed. On the downside, the blonde manager deserves the \"Soup Nazi\" award of the year. She refused us service 3 separate times when we arrived 20 to 15 minutes before the posted closing time. No reason given, just, \"the kitchen is closed\". One other time she charged us for when we asked for a second plate of bread which we though was complimentary.  Great restaurant.

And the house wine was Coppola's Rosso blend, for just $15 a pitcher. We ate outside at one of the heated sidewalk tables (dog friendly), savoring the North Beach twilight and watching the tourists and crazies go by.
