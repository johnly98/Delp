As I went to check out, I was going to ask if they had castella cake, because when I was in Nagasaki I loved it. Imagine my joy as I got to the register and right to the left of me was the exact cake I bought in Japan: Nagasaki green tea castella. I almost cried. \n\nThis store was by far my favorite highlight of San Francisco and the prices are exactly what I would have expected!

The Cherry Blossom flavor one was sold out. \n\nThe Harajuku Mochi Chocolates were encased in a nice flattering box to show how trendy it is.

Many items are imported straight from Japan, and I can confirm this after my recent visit a few months ago. I was pleasantly surprised to find the same boxes of mochi that I saw at Tokyo station for only a few dollars more here! \n\nThe store carries mochi filled with more traditional fillings like red bean, but most of their mochi contain white or dark chocolate or even jams with cream inside. The colorful boxes of mochi keep for about 3 months and are great for gifts. These mochi are not to be confused with the larger fresh mochi at Benkyodo that are filled with fruits, lima bean paste, etc.\n\nOther fun items to pick up are the bunny-shaped bean paste manju, Japanese flavored kit kats, and freeze dried strawberries coated in white chocolate. They have a variety of keychains and trinkets near the check out line and they can wrap your gifts in beautiful furoshiki wrapping cloth for a couple dollars more. \n\nI also always buy a 40g tin of ceremonial grade uji matcha powder when I'm here for $12.50, which is a fantastic price. \n\nJust keep in mind that everything is packaged here, but this can be a good thing if you're not planning on eating your treats right away or want to gift them. Japanese sweets don't contain preservatives though, so don't wait too long...but that shouldn't be a problem!

It was a rare treat to the mouth as I savored you. I didn't know if I needed to bite the soft Mochi that encased this treat. It was a luxury in the palate. And for 9 bucks a box it was reasonable after the first taste.\n\nSame for the strawberry chocolate. Think how they freeze dried each strawberry and then dipped into creamy white chocolate. It was science in your mouth and an adventure to your taste buds. The strawberry is like crunchy and dense with the tart of the fruit still present but the chocolate neutralizes that's tartness and so it was a gastronomic experience.\n\nSadly these arE just two of the items I sampled and they have more in this quaint store.

They were good but the texture wasn't exact to the soft, chewy texture of mochi. \n- Sweet bean cakes: I was hoping these would be similar to torimon and it was, but the texture of the filling was off. Torimon has a creamy filling while the filling for these are a bit crumbly. These came in a box of 16.\n\nThe store is divided into sections so it's easy to narrow down what you want. Although this store imports goods from Japan, my boyfriend didn't see one thing that he's had or seen from Japan. It's not a question of authenticity but it was interesting to hear that from him. \n\nThe person working wasn't helpful one bit and didn't bother getting up from his seat to answer any questions or give any recommendations.

I love everything rabbit related and these mochis looked just too good to be true and well unfortunately they were. \n\nNippon Ya carries a variety of Japanese treats from candy to mochi to various other gift items packaged in exquisite cute boxes. We picked up three flavors of the bunny mochi (green tea, coffee, and cherry). The display for the mochi looked absolutely adorable...white mochis with ears and eyes. Although when I opened a box I realized that it looked nothing like the display! You could hardly tell the mochi was a bunny :(. The markings were faded and it definitely wasn't cute at all. Hoping it would taste better than it looked I bought these back home and tasted all three flavors before gifting a couple to my friends.

Probably because all of their food goodies are prepackaged for gift giving. However after a holiday in Japan and drooling over all those treats I was really happy to find them available more locally - and at such reasonable prices. This may not be top of the line but they have a nice variety of mochi from traditional to chocolate to puffed rice. The boxes range from $10-20 - about $1 / mochi. The emphasis here is really on mochi and less on the usual candies/crackers you get at the grocery store.\n\nDefinitely not as high end as Minamoto Kitchoan downtown but not everyone wants to spend $3 / treat.", "author": "Jean K."}

Although Benkyodo remains dear and true to my heart, the prepackaged and imported mochi sold at Nippon-ya are also impressive. Don't expect mochi to taste fresh/home-made quality (if you're looking for that, walk two blocks away to Benkyodo), but do expect to get some beautiful, moist and dreamy confections imported from Japan. In contrast to packaged mochi from other places, the ones here neither taste like plastic or are overly sweet.\n\nI would say the prices are reasonably, ranging around $9-12 per box, for 9-12 mochi. So that would be around $1 per mochi. They have boxes offering your standard azuki (red bean paste) mochi, but I'd recommend going for something unique. Since having been introduced to their mochi I have enjoyed and recommend the following:\n\n-strawberry chocolate mochi\n-mango daifuku\n-bunny cream mochi collection\n-green tea white chocolate mochi\n\nI think their offering changes occasionally, depending on their stock availability, However, it's always a treat when I purchase a new box of mochi there.

When I tasted it - it was sweet, but afterwards it had a slight sour taste which might the mochi(it was slightly fermented). I think these mochi are flavored with real ingredients to give a unique feel of your taste buds. The mochi doesn't stick to your teeth which is a good thing.\n\nAlthough there a lot of varieties of candies, the prices range from $6 to 25 depending which variety you buy. Next time, I will buy the variety pack which has some tarts, mochi, chocolate cake balls, yuzu infused mochi, some french cookies (thin waferlike cookies with cream filling), and chocolate crunch cookies. This variety pack costs $15.95. A good value if you were to give someone who loves authentic Japanese sweets, or love mochi.

I also got the chocolate strawberry mochi, the Harajuku ones...also AMAZING!  They have cute nicknacks too. :D\nOverall, I LOVE this place.  The price is reasonable too.

This place has a good variety of mochi and other japanese snacks. They're great for souvenirs and gifts to take home and share with your family and friends. Most of the mochis don't need to be refrigerated so they don't spoil easily. They are also packaged in beautiful boxes.Try the Harajuku MOCHI chocolat. I think its the godiva version of mochis. What's good about is, you can see samples of mochis on what's inside each box on display. Don't hesitate to ask the cashier.  He was very nice and helpful. They also sell cute accessories such as keyholders. I bought one that looks like two kissing mochis ^___^ which are supposed to be for couples. You can give one to your bf and keep the other for yourself. It's cute!! This place is a must visit when in Japantown SF. Enjoy!!", "author": "Martha N."}

There's a basket of chocolate, strawberry and yogurt filled marshmallows. Were these sale prices I saw? There's a display case of freeze dried bananas and strawberries covered in chocolate. Not only do they look good but they taste good too!\n\nThey also have cute stuffed animals, key chains and toys. Packaging is super cute so I can come here to buy a last minute present. A little pricey but some of these things you can't find anywhere else in the city so pony up here or you can drop cash on a plane ticket to tokyo.", "author": "Lola L."}

'cause I know I will probably go home and devour a gift-sized box of these sweet things in an evening. My favorite is the strawberry mochi with chocolate filling. It's like eating frosting surrounded by strawberry pillows of joy.\n\nNippon Ya sells a wide variety of Japanese mochi confections, ranging from traditional to modern flavors. The products are a little pricey, but are great for gifts. Has anyone ever said \"WOW!\" after receiving yet another janky box of See's candy for the holidays?

Let's say you don't mind eating all that.  Fine.  But you should know that unless you specifically want the pretty packaging Nipponya features so that you have some nice-looking omiyage to give out, you can get a lot of the same treats for much cheaper at Nijiya Market.  Better yet, if you can get to it while it's open, Benkyodo makes various sweet treats FRESH.\n\nI have found a few good items here that I would go back for, and when I'm traveling long distances to see people, I buy gifts here because it's not as practical to transport fresh sweets from Benkyodo.  So yes, do give this shop a look-see, but know that it WILL be overpriced for what you get and that you should research some other shops in the area before opening your wallet.  The generous reviews here are just astounding to me.\n\nP.S. Try the shiso-flavored hard candy.  It's the only place in J-town where I can find such a thing; otherwise I would never pay $3 for a handful of rock candy.", "author": "James L."}

I don't come here too often due to the fact the prices can be rather expensive (that's why I gave it 4 stars) but when I go there my wallet gets pretty light afterwards. =P  So far the things I've tried has been delicious except for  the mango mochi which I didn't like.  The mochi was soft but it didn't taste like mango to me.  Chocolate mochi was good but can be too sweet.  And their chocolate covered dried strawberries are great.\n\nCrackers I've tried were also great!  Especially this one box of crackers I bought last week that was meant to be given to my boyfriend's family but since he had so many other stuff to carry on the plane he left this one which I'm glad he did because it sure is delicious!!  The crackers are round and had 6 flavors (almond, coconut, green beans, etc) that tasted just like they're supposed to (~$15).  \n\nAll their snacks are nicely wrapped and even if they're not wrapped just the box itself looks nice.  Great place to buy for family or friends as a gift if they like exotic japanese snacks.  Plus they have other cute non-edible gifts on the left side of the store you can browse through.  I signed up on their email list more than a month ago and haven't received anything yet but according to a guy working there, he said last email they gave 50% off on the new arrivals for people.
