You choose a base of chocolate or vanilla and then choose one or more toppings to blend in. This is great because you get all the toppings in every bite (unlike traditional self-serve froyo). \n\nThe first time I went, I got the mocha chip, which was good, but was very espresso heavy. The second time, I got the blueberry coconut and it was incredible!!!! Highly recommend getting anything with fruit in it because it increases the volume a lot and makes you feel like you got a lot. \n\nThe biggest surprise to me was the rice pudding - they let you try samples so I had the cookies and cream and chocolate chip and both were really good! I had no idea I liked rice pudding, but when I go back, I think I would try it!", "author": "Nicole Z."}

I got walnuts in mine, but instead of getting the crunch from the nuts it kind of just felt like eating sandy ice cream, couldn't really taste them in there...nonetheless I'm glad to have tried it and it did satisfy my dessert craving. Knowing what i know now about how it gets blended up (no Coldstone paddles here, y'all) i would probably try a different nut-free combo next time. I took a taste of my friends' two cups too - the strawberry one and the butterfinger (i got the banana bread). All three were pretty darn great.\n\nOne issue we had was that the girl preparing one of the cups put it on the counter in front of us and looked right at us so we assumed it was ours and put a spoon in it.

They had other things aside from froyo like rice krispy treats, rice pudding, and even cake.They serve  smoothies too my girlfriend tried one when I decided to bring her and her nieces here she didnt like it. But her 3 nieces loved their yogurt. Suggested that she get the yogurt which tastes like icecream but for calorie consumption she opted for smoothie. One of my old co-workers loved this place he'd get a large thin mint like once or twice a week and we'd always make fun of him because he was so thin. The reason im giving 3 stars is because it was somewhat inconsistant. Sometimes they'd put baby chocolate chips on my froyo as like a garnish, sometimes I'd have to ask where are my chocolate chips? Sometimes the workers wouldnt be friendly, sometimes they'd be super friendly. They used to run out of junior mints for my coworkers favorite and then he'd have to choose another flavor. One other thing I'd like to mention is you have to have a strong arm to work the machine that processes the yogurt and there were multiple times that we've had to tell them \"hey can you run this through the machine again we know its supposed to go through twice\" for the right consistency which is why people actually like this place. Otherwise its fairly small place with a few tables that you may or may not be able to sit at depending on the day and time. It ususlly looks clean and the music is usually decent. I would love to return to loving cup if im ever in the area again.", "author": "Adriana B."}

Upon seeing that Loving Cup had the option for rice pudding, I was so excited because this is a dessert that I always look forward to. I thought that the rice pudding would stand out in one way or another due to the high reviews here. My cousin ordered the yogurt and seemed to enjoy it more than I did.

Loving Cup is super memorable, thus my 5 stars rating!\n\n+1 Price:quantity:quality ratio is hella worth it! TBH, if you weighed the froyo at Yogurtland or Menchies, it would probably cost you around $5 or more just for the froyo. AND if you wanted toppings...that price range goes up. \n\nStep 1: Decide between froyo, rice pudding, fruit smoothies, or fro-yo shakes. (OR JUST GET EVERYTHANG!!) \nStep 2: Feel free to sample rice pudding! \nStep 3: If you feelin' like a no-brainer, you can choose one of the \"favorites\" OR look to the big board by the window and customize your own.  \nStep 4: Pick your size, pay, wait and ENJOY! \n\nRICE PUDDING: \nS: $3.75, M: $4.75, L: $6.75, Pint: $7.75 / Add a topping for 75 cents\n+1 CINNAMON RUM RAISIN. My favorite of all the ones they had today! \n+Flavors change daily, but the set ones are: cinnamon rum raisin, vanilla, bittersweet chocolate chip, coconut \n\nFRO-YO: \nS: $4.75, M: $5.75, L: $6.75, Pint: $8.75 / Add additional toppings for 75 cents (or was it 50?) \n+1 Texture is delicious! Not soft serve ice cream texture, but definitely firmer than your typical froyo (so it doesn't melt all over you...) \n+1 NO SYRUPS used at all! They use frozen fruits to bring out the real flavors and you might even taste the seeds of strawberry or raspberry. Perfect! \n\nPros:\n+Great service. Not super energetic, but this girl knows how to make a mean froyo! She's also hella efficient when the line got super long. \n+Great menu. I want to try all the combinations possible! \n\nCons:\n-Nothing! Except maybe menu was quite overwhelming with deliciousness....\n\nTips/Observations:\n-What if they sold waffle cones?! I think that would be pretty awesome to go with your froyo. \n-Stamp card available! It's not per order, but per item. Buy 9 and get a small free! ($3.75 value)\n-They accept credit cards, despite how small the store front is. \n-If you're a cinnaholic like me...you can get additional cinnamon (and nutmeg) for free! \n\nOverall, coming here again!

We walked from our dinner place, so I provide no help in parking assistance. The later it is the better chance you'll have for parking. \n\nThere were a lot of options for us to choose from, rice pudding, frozen yogurt, our own toppings or a suggested combination. \n\nBoth myself and my friend went with froyo although I will probably want to come back and try the rice pudding. \n\nSizes are generous in my opinion, we both got mediums because smalls looked too small and I didn't finish! Me? Not finish a dessert? It's unheard of. I have a second stomach that's saved for dessert, but it was too much. \n\nPrices are cheap. I paid 5 bucks for a huge medium that I didn't even finish, so I'd say you're definitely getting your money's worth. \n\nService was really friendly for us. I was helped by a lovely older women.  Very sweet and very patience with us deciding on what we wanted. She also offered assistance with the menu and what to choose. I saw other reviews about service, but they mentioned a guy so we must have gotten lucky. Service can make a huge difference on a night out so I'm glad we were helped by this older woman. \n\nFlavors: Cookie monster and the cinnamon toast crunch\n\nThese flavors tasted a lot more healthy than a normal place you would go to, but it was kind of refreshing.  The cinnamon toast crunch had a very strong cinnamon taste that went well with the subtle taste of the vanilla base. It's definitely not as sweet as a regular ice cream or frozen yogurt, but it's very satisfying for some reason. I think because the vanilla is a lot lighter you don't feel weighed down by this heavy dessert. \n\nThe cookie monster was basically cookies and cream, although I could have sworn it was supposed to include cookie dough. Regardless, it tasted good as well. There was a nice texture to the yogurt and the consistency is much thicker than a regular froyo.  Again the flavors are a little more on the subtle side and it's not as sweet, but I appreciated that. It lacks the richness of ice cream, but it's a very light dessert that won't make you food coma immediately after you finish. \n\nI'm a fan, it was a good experience with good service and good dessert. I'd certainly come back to try rice pudding!", "author": "Jay K."}

I heard the small size is plenty. A super good deal for your $3.75.\n\nWhat I'm really raving about is the rice pudding, which is just fantastic. I love rice pudding, but in the past, I've only really had rice pudding at Indian restaurants, which don't include much customization. I will say though that if you're not a fan of typical rice/tapioca pudding consistency, you'll probably won't like the rice pudding here either. There were six flavors of rice pudding when I went on a Friday night, and all of the flavor combinations sounded so appetizing. I wound up sampling the Lemon Vanilla, Coconut, and Cookies & Cream and loved all of them. The Lemon Vanilla reminded me a lot of a lemon yogurt, while the Coconut had delightful coconut pieces mixed into the pudding. \n\nI was in the mood for something more flavorful, so I bought a small size of the Cookies & Cream rice pudding, and my cup was overflowing with Oreo-cookie-goodness. The rice pudding itself has the most perfect texture - not too creamy but decadent enough to feel like you're indulging in a delicious treat. I also feared that the pudding would be too sweet if I got the a flavor like Cookies & Cream, but I was surprised by how refreshing and light this pudding was. Ideal amount of sweetness that isn't too overwhelming. I absolutely loved the little pieces of Oreo cookie that weren't completely blended into the pudding.\n\nI will definitely be back to Loving Cup if I'm ever close to Polk St. If you are a fan of rice pudding, this place will be heavenly.", "author": "Sheila D."}

We ended up splitting a small of their coconut rice pudding and semi-sweet chocolate chip rice pudding. Both complimented each other well, one being added texture the other more flavor. If I had to choose though, the coconut would be my favorite - light, smooth, soft, and addictive. Seriously I'm still thinking about it right now.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-06-23", "description": "This place when it first opened had stellar service and tasty products. It was the first place that converted me into liking rice pudding. But service got increasingly rude. Really rude. I live around the corner and frequent the coffee shop next door and the gym two doors down. All but one of the employees taking the order never (that is not an exaggeration) say, \"Hello, how are you? How can I help you? What can I get for you today? Thank you!\" I have been there every week lately and these common expressions of courtesy are just not said. I'm always polite (also having worked in service) and while I finish each transaction with a thank you to the cashier and the froyo maker, they do not say Thank you in return. The froyo makers SLAM or downright TOSS your food onto the counter. \nA few days ago, I got another winter spice froyo which is their current promotion. I asked the employee making it if I could get the spices as a topping (he was not making any other orders, no one was behind me in line), he responds \"What?!\" I repeat my question. Again he goes, \"What?!\" I repeat again. He gets the cinnamon and slams it onto the counter.  Way to go for customer service for people who spend their $ here.\n\nThe formulations for the rice pudding have also changed. Less spices, raisins if the Cinnamon Rum Raisin, less flavor.\n\nSome time ago, I got my fave flavor and the ladles were laying flat in the dish. The employee took my cash, made an ick face, having to grab a sticky ladle handle and then returned it to the dish. That's a health code violation and I decided to throw away the medium size rp. Not worth getting sick over.\n\nAlso, what happened to the compostable spoons? Why aren't they using compostable lids? It's unethical for businesses to open with greenware and then downgrading to disposable plastics once even consumers enter. (I leave spoonless and use a spoon at home, tho that's not an option for most guests.)\n\nI still like the froyo. I'll still come for evening desserts. The place does well bc there are no other dessert spots in either direction open late, the closest being the boba tea spot on Polk/Broadway. But the declining flavors and horrid, rude, ungrateful  customer service and ungracious social behavior take away from the potential goodness and one leaves feeling less satisfied.  This is not a place that offers service with a smile or thanks.\n\nI thought a lot (for a few years) before writing this review. I didn't want to post for each rude encounter. I even took a break from here for about 6 months due to everything above before I succumbed to my sweet tooth for carbs and dairy. I can't resist when it's nearby and open late. While I try hard to not write negative reviews online bc everyone is out trying to create success, the ongoing behavior here will hopefully be rectified someday. \n\nps.

Bonus points (not really) from the employee who helped me, as she said that was the first flavor combo she tried before working there ;)\n\nWithin a couple of minutes I had a fresh cup of frozen yogurt in my hand. Not only was the color gorgeous, but the flavors melded so nicely together and it wasn't too sweet! It certainly explained why I've passed on regular froyo for this long, so many places have that artificial taste and colors that make you wonder in what country do neon pink strawberries grow.\n\nThis was exactly the opposite: REAL fruit (freeze dried strawberries) meant real and strong flavors. I could easily taste and see the bits of Oreo mixed throughout the frozen yogurt. Texture was good, but a bit icy at the beginning, which I think was from the strawberries.\n\nA gem of a place and I'll definitely be back!\n\nNotes:\n\n- Healthy portion sizes! Prices include 1 topping, with $0.75 for each additional - and there's 25 to choose from. With two toppings, it was $5.50 for a medium size.\n\n- They have a rewards system/stamp card! 10 stars gives you a free small rice pudding or frozen yogurt ($3.75 worth).\n\n- According to the sign, their frozen yogurt is pro-biotic, and I'm all for helping my gut while eating dessert.\n\n- They have a rotating flavor of the day, if you're feeling adventurous.\n\n- Yes they accept credit cards, and use Square.\n\n- A few seats, but seems like mostly a to-go spot.

That said, consistency of \"service\" and the end product have been really spotty lately, so providing some feedback for the management/owners. \n\nFirstly, I live just around the corner and there have now been a couple occasions where I'd show up ~30m before they close and I'm \"the last one for the night.\" While I'm happy that I've made the cut every time, it's ridiculous to be turning people away 25m before you close because you don't want to stay a little longer to finish the job. The first time this happened, I estimate they turned away ~12 people, which is probably only ~$75 of revenue that night, but this isn't an isolated event and lot of those 12 poeple won't be back. In my opinion, it doesn't matter what the queue is at that point. It's frozen yogurt and you can handle it. If this is a directive from management to cut it off to avoid overtime, then that's on them, but I highly doubt it. Totally understand this isn't so black and white and a large group coming in 5m before they close is not cool (turn them away), but this was way ahead of schedule and it's not like they're firing a grill back up to cook something.\n\nSecondly, I'd never noticed in the past how they'd put the yogurt and ingredients through the machine twice to fully mix everything until they stopped doing it regularly. About half the time I go now, they dump everything in and put it through once, so all the ingredients are concentrated at the top of the yogurt. This would be fine if you were ordering actual toppings or wanted half of what you ordered and half vanilla, but the whole point of Loving Cup is to mix everything and it does change the flavor profile. Feels ridiculous even complaining about it, but its such an easy thing to prevent and takes another 10 seconds (that they had the last two times I'd gone as no one else was in line). It's a simple product that's pretty hard to screw up, so please stop being lazy :-).\n\nAlso, FYI as of my last visit yesterday, they are no longer giving out stamp cards.

Intrigued, I followed these like a bread crumb trail and found Loving Cup. What a cute name! Loving cup is a fro-yo place but it's a bit different from other fro-yo places. \n\nThe first step, you pick either a vanilla or a chocolate frozen yogurt base. The second step is you choose your mix-ins. The first mix-in is included, but after that there's a small fee. I was in a more fruity mood, so I decided to pick mango for my mix-in. I placed my order and paid with credit card - they use Square. The guy who took my order was really nice and he even asked me if I wanted a stamp card (buy 9 and get a small cup free!). \n\nSo here, they use some kind of machine to really mix in your mix-in into the fro-yo. And the guy making it really had to press hard on the lever to make the yogurt come out! He must have a really strong right arm! Next to the machine, I saw all kinds of mix-ins in mason jars (cute!) and the guy would add in the mix-ins based on the order that came in. So it's kind of like made-to-order, instead of the flavors being pre-made. \n\nI thought the process was really cool, but my mango vanilla fro-yo didn't have a very strong mango flavor. I think he used real mango, but maybe it wasn't enough. The flavor was really light. The texture of the fro-yo was good though. \n\nThey also sell rice pudding here - that also sounded really good and seems really popular. If I'm ever back I want to try that!", "author": "Sylvia K."}

Something about frozen yogurt that always makes me feel as though I haven't completely annihilated my \"diet\" (I like to think I eat healthy for the most part...okay, I don't eat healthy at all, I just tell people I do, which is half the battle anyways), yet I still manage to cure my sweet tooth.\n\nHonestly, I wasn't \"wow-ed.\" I got the vanilla base with nutella and pistachio. I love the concept of mixing the frozen yogurt with the toppings, like Cold Stone, but it didn't hit the spot for me. The flavors were wonderful, but they didn't pick out the shells of the pistachios, so every couple of minutes, I'd be chomping on shells and would have to pick it out. It just made the experience unpleasant and a lot of work. Every other bite, I'd be particularly paranoid that I'd hit another shell and chip a tooth or something. \n\nI also tried the coffee shake, which was terrible. It was watery, yet unbelievably strong. I expected a thicker consistency that was fully blended, but it wasn't :(. Needless to say, I'm glad I only tried it and didn't get it. Love the flavor, just wish the texture was smoother, creamier, and thicker. \n\nI might give this place another shot, but I'm definitely steering clear of the pistachios and all the shakes next time around!

Also, you're allowed to choose one add-in (topping), and I chose gummy bears -- but, rather than putting the gummy bears onto the yogurt, they put the toppings in a separate cup for you to do so yourself.

The staff was super unhelpful. Basically we were looking at the menu and not one person bothered to ask if we needed help. And then they brought ice from next door and walked outside to inside the store with the ice fully exposed. It was just very unsanitary. But mostly the staff was just so  not about helping anyone.

Whether you're reading up on a new travel destination, a DIY project, or yet another awesome Yelp review from that Mike L. guy (who I hear is pretty damn cool...), reading is quite handy.  That is, assuming you take advantage of it.  Unlike me...\n\nAt Loving Cup, customizing your order of frozen yogurt is really quite simple.  After choosing the flavor of non-fat frozen yogurt you want (vanilla or chocolate), you then pick whatever toppings for them to blend in with your froyo.  Easy enough.  Sadly for me though, I didn't see/read \"blend in\" on the wall and assumed the toppings were just lightly mixed in.  Whoops.  It wasn't until I saw my choices getting swirled together in their machine that I realized I had chosen a fairly random combination of ingredients - chocolate froyo, strawberries, and cookie dough.  I know, right?\n\nAmazingly enough, my odd concoction turned out okay...which speaks to how good Loving Cup is.  Sure, my friend's more traditional combination turned out better (vanilla & strawberry), but I like to think of mine as being avant-garde (and not something a 12 year old would have ordered).  The chocolate flavor was nice and creamy without being too sweet, and the strawberries made for a natural match.  And the little bits of cookie dough?  Not bad, but I won't be repeating that particular mix of flavors again.\n\nIf frozen yogurt creations aren't your thing, their rice pudding is just as good, if not better.  Although I only sampled a bite, the Espresso Rice Pudding was terrific.  What's more? I'm not even a fan of rice pudding!  While it does suck how parking in the area can be pretty scarce, it might be a good thing for me.  If it was easy, I might come back a lot more often than I should.", "author": "Mike L."}

My friends all enjoyed the yogurts they got and i got to taste some and it was creamy and sweet.

I got a coffee shake made with the yogurt and added some english toffee. I enjoyed it but I felt like my drink was too sweet. The yogurt was a nice add though because it kept my drink creamy and a little thick.

This little frozen yogurt, smoothie, milkshake, and rice pudding store has an adorable interior... rustic French meets classic American meets laid-back California. There are only several stools to sit inside and limited seating outside the shop. Most people just grab and stroll (not grab and go!) -- this is not the type of food to devour in a rush. You'll want to savor all the lusciousness of their frozen yogurt or rice pudding. I like their coconut rice pudding and MOST ESPECIALLY their plain frozen yogurt with strawberry and nutella. I've heard this is one of their most popular flavor combinations and why wouldn't it be? The sweet and tart strawberries juxtaposed against the rich and deep flavors of nutella enmeshed with the creamy frozen yogurt? This totally cools you down on a warm day and actually metaphorically warms you up on a cold night. I'm a creature of habit and have ordered his repeatedly because it's just too fantastic to not. \n\nWhat I also love about the Loving Cup is its unassuming nature. It looks like a very simple place, but produces some of the most mind-boggling street treats around. I also enjoy the fact that this is a locals' spot. It's not teeming with tourists and feels incredibly intimate because of that. I joked with my boyfriend that Loving Cup is reason for me enough to live in Nob Hill. He thought I was joking. No. I'm serious. If I can have easy access to the Loving Cup, I'll be a much happier person. Enjoy!", "author": "James Z."}

Your order also comes with one topping which they will twirl in right in front of you. The machine they use is pretty damn cool, something I've never seen before but I did feel bad for the guy who had to make my order. I wanted mangos, which turns out were frozen chunks so when he went to spin my order you could tell he had to exert far more strength to do so. Presentation wise, the combo flavor swirl isn't that pretty but the flavor is solid. \n\nThe froyo was creamy with a good body with a touch of sweetness. This isn't like what you would get at say Yogurtland or Nubu, which was a pleasant change of pace. \n\nI also had a chance to sample their rice pudding and while I'm not a huge fan of rice pudding, I have to say they do a great job as well. \n\nOverall Thoughts\n\nLoving cup is aptly named", "author": "Eddie W."}

Second, select toppings (there's a list on the wall) to be mixed in with your choice of base and BAM! Customized froyo. So simple and so clever. I found that a small cup (~$4) is enough for me. I always choose vanilla as my base and stick to one fruit topping (i.e. bananas or strawberries) and one chocolate topping (oreos or nutella). Toppings aren't free but I believe the first topping is free and the second topping and so forth is about $1 each.\n\nSo far, my favorite combonitation has been vanilla base + bananas + peanut butter + nutella.

The rating is based on my most recent experience, Monday night, March 21st.\n\nI've been here a few times and LOVE the frozen yogurt magic machine that turns already delicious soft serve fro-yo into a DQ blizzard-esque concoction.  Once I discovered it, I told all my friends about it and try to stop by for a treat when I'm in the area.\n\nOn that fateful Monday night, I had a fantastic dinner with 3 of my girlfriends and we decided to skip the dessert menu and head to Loving Cup for some of the good stuff.  This was a big deal as 3 of the 4 of us are QUITE pregnant and dessert is basically the best part of our day :)  \n\nWe pulled up to LC and couldn't believe our luck: a parking spot right out front and 20 minutes until it closed!  Sweet!  We piled out, lined up and started picking out what yummy treats we were going to order.  I noticed as we waited that there was a line of about 6 people, and the 2 girls working there seemed a bit overwhelmed.  One girl kept looking down at the ground and then called the other over.  The other came over, looked down in horror, then looked at us and announced \"we're closing.  we're not taking any more orders.\"  Apparently, the drain on the floor was backed up.  I peered over to see and couldn't see any water on the floor so assumed it was perhaps on the verge of backing up?\n\nMy friends and I looked around - we were the ONLY ones in line as the other customers had already ordered and paid and were just waiting to get their fro-yos.  So, there are 4 more customers, the store has 20 minutes before it closes, and now we're being kicked out? Even though they are going to continue to make the orders they've already taken (there were 6 cups lined up to be made), they wouldn't take ours?  I was thinking maybe we could just order some rice pudding when the girl who made the initial announcement started yelling at us - in an extremely hostile manner -  \"we're not taking any more orders.  We're closed. We're closed.\"  We couldn't believe the way she was talking to us - we hadn't even argued with her, we had just kind of stood in shocked silence and then started to laugh with each other about telling pregnant ladies they couldn't have ice cream!  \n\nWe went to Yelp to figure out where to go from there and decided on ice cream at Over the Moon on Chestnut.  The ice cream was delicious and, what's more, the employee didn't yell at us! \n\nIn all seriousness, I totally appreciate that the workers were overwhelmed and perhaps panicked when they saw  impending drain problems, but they way they handled themselves and the situation was beyond unprofessional.  It seemed to me that they could have easily closed the doors and not taken any additional customers but still taken our order, or if they really couldn't handle making four more cups of fro-yo, they  could have offered us something else on the menu that takes less time.  At the very least, the employee who yelled at us should have spoken to us in a respectful manner - if she'd calmly explained the situation, she would have gotten the same results (us leaving without ordering).    The experience was so unnecessary and unpleasant and I certainly will be taking my business elsewhere from now on and encourage others to do the same.", "author": "Jessica G."}

The shop is small and luckily we got in when we did because there was a huge line behind us out the door while we were waiting for our yogurt concoctions. They use this machine that swirls your toppings into frozen blocks of chocolate or vanilla yogurt which is definitely a cool/different take on fro-yo.

I prefer my toppings to be chunky and if I get something like cookie dough mixed in I really like having little cookie dough pieces to unearth. Because of the grinder all the topping become really fine and well mixed into the yogurt so it comes out a little bit grainier/mixed in than I would prefer.

But really, I used to work at a frozen yogurt shop for two years in high school, tried all flavors, multiple combinations, and even checked out competitors. Plus, I'm from Orange County where Yogurtland emerged. Okay, enough uptalk.\n\nI adore the Loving Cup. I can't even tell you the number of times I've been here. If I checked in as much as I visited, I'd probably singlehandedly crash the Yelp app.\n\nHow it works:\n1. Pick a base - vanilla or chocolate.\n2. Pick your toppings - they range from candy to fruit to sweets and more.\n3. If you don't want frozen yogurt, the rice pudding selection is ace.\n\nThe machine the employees use essentially mixes the topping(s) you selected into the yogurt base you chose. Example: if you pick vanilla base with strawberry topping you will then have a pink strawberry yogurt! I  made the mistake of picking blueberries with chocolate base the first time because I didn't understand this concept and in return I got a blue/purple yogurt with seeds all over it. Fortunately, I've matured in topping selection since then.\n\nCustomer service is always friendly and I like the cute interior of the shop. On weekends it can get a bit crowded late-night but it's never been a huge problem or slow when I'm there. \n\nBe sure to get a stamp card and remember they charge a small fee ($0.25) if you don't hit the minimum credit card charge.", "author": "Salma R."}

It's made with short grain rice and has more ooze & flow than I'm accustomed to with rice pudding. Not that that's a bad thing.

That's why this place gets 4 stars. \n\nThis is a frozen yogurt shop that also sells rice pudding and smoothies. The line was long so I assumed this was something special. It's basically a run of the mill fro yo shop. You pick a base (vanilla or chocolate), pick add ins like fruit, Nutella, toffee, etc.. and they swirl it all together using this contraption that kind of looks like a turbine. \n\nThe end result was basically a very bland tasting fro yo. The add-ins end up really broken down so you can't even taste them really. I got vanilla with fruit and toffee and I couldn't taste the toffee, just the fruit, which wasn't fresh. I know this place is busy and the employees are friendly but I've had a lot of fro yo and this place just doesn't measure up.

I'm just a food fanatic trying to lose weight and Loving Cup is just making it so hard. \n\nIn reality, the yogurt at Loving Cup deserves a full five stars. The idea is genius - choose as you like. Depending on whether you like vanilla or chocolate, you can add whatever toppings your stomach desires and VOILA, heavenly creamy froyo. The thing I love most, alongside with the personalization of flavors, has got to be the texture of their yogurts. Its fresh; meaning you'll never get it melting like many self-serve yogurt shops. Secondly, despite the abundance of flavors you can possibly incorporate into your yogurt, its never overwhelmingly sweet! I love how you can taste each and every flavor you add on. My favorite so far is the vanilla base with nutella, strawberry, and banana. I can't wait til my next visit to start playing with more of the add-ons. \n\nAside from the yogurt, I would probably pass on the rice pudding. I sampled a majority of their flavors and none of them particularly stands out.

They offer a variety of mouth-watering flavors that change daily; however, coconut and rum raisin (and maybe a few others?) are permanent fixtures to their delectable offerings. Fortunately, coconut also remains conveniently undefeated as my #1 flavor.

Also, they didn't have strawberry :(.\n\nMy boyfriend got banana and walnuts with vanilla froyo as the base. It tasted pretty good, like banana bread! It's too bad that after the first thing you mix with the froyo, it's .75 cents extra for another add-in. It's a little expensive for all of that in my opinion. However, I'd say that the small cup was more than enough for one person.\n\nPros is the the serving size is big and the froyo is very natural - it doesn't get all liquidy like other froyo places.

Either way, this place is great!\n\nLoving Cup hand makes each frozen yogurt concoction with a base flavor (vanilla or chocolate) and the toppings that you want added, ranging from gummy bears to Nutella to almond butter to a variety of fruit.  They have a board with a recommended flavor when you first walk in (the Almond Joy that was featured did sound delicious), but I decided to dream up my own flavor creation.  I had the chocolate base with cookie dough and Oreos and was very happy with my choice.  \n\nIn addition to delicious froyo, they also have some really incredible rice pudding if that is more your thing.  I tried the Cookies & Cream and loved that it had the perfect texture and was flavorful without being too sweet.  I also like that there were real large chunks of cookies included rather than just the cookie crumble.  \n\nThey also serve Blue Bottle Coffee, which is absolutely divine if you are a coffee drinker.  They initially forgot about the French press that I ordered (which is understandable because there was a lot of froyo mixing and rice pudding serving going on for only 2 people working), but were very apologetic when they realized the mistake and also offered a refill if I wanted it.\n\nThe space is pretty small, but there are some barstools at the window so you can sit and people watch while you enjoy.  We were lucky enough to grab a spot since we arrived fairly close to closing time one Sunday night.  The decor is reminiscent of an old school ice cream parlor that has been modernized.  I loved the chic look of the boards displaying the flavor options and the instructions on how to order any froyo treat.  \n\nSince each frozen yogurt is hand churned through their magical machine, you will likely have to wait, but don't be too daunted by a long line.  Many of the people in line ahead of us were getting some rice pudding, so the line moved along fairly quickly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-22", "description": "UPDATE (6/23/14): Upgrading my review to a 4 after yesterday's visit. It's been a while since the visit that prompted my first review, so I don't know if they actually changed their sizes or not. Either way, this time I found the small size very reasonably priced and appropriately portioned. I decided to embrace the texture they were going for (almost completely smooth, despite having toppings like pretzels) and enjoyed the experience much more. The yogurt itself is still great and I hope to go back again soon. The quality of the nut butters they use (peanut and almond) are way above any other yogurt place I've been too.\n\n(Original Review)\nI was honestly a bit disappointed with my first visit here. I got the day's special (forgot the name, but it was chocolate yogurt, peanut butter, and bits of toffee) and was excited to taste the results of the unique machine they used to combine the toppings with the yogurt.\n\nAt first, I was blown away by how creamy and light the texture was. Unfortunately, I think this particular flavor combination fell flat for me. The toffee bits were either too small to begin with (I didn't see them beforehand) or had somehow become so thoroughly incorporated into mix it felt a bit too homogenous. Totally cool if that works for some people, but my personal preference is to have toppings introduce little pockets of textural variety throughout the mix so that every spoon doesn't taste/feel exactly the same.\n\nI was initially going to go with two stars because on top of the disappointment I expressed above, I wanted to draw more attention to the fact that the portions are a bit out of whack. I got a small and felt full about 60% of the way through. I'd happily buy a cup about half the size of the small even if they only knocked a dollar off the price tag. \n\nTo be fair though, I have to bump it up back up to a 3 because the quality of the yogurt itself really was excellent. On my next visit (and I will be going back for sure), I'm just going to try out some different flavor combos and see if they're a better fit for me.", "author": "Asif S."}

The reason, this place is not getting 5 stars is because I wish they had other base flavors aside from chocolate and vanilla, maybe mint, coffee, strawberry, etc. I like to always get a chocolate base with strawberries and chocolate chips. It is a bit pricey, but let's be honest everything is pricey in SF, so I guess it is about the average price to get your frozen treat fix. Definitely check this place out if you are in the area!", "author": "Alex L."}

Since I've never been here, I got their three most common flavors- vanilla, raisin cinnamon, and coconut. I liked it in that order. The vanilla was very similar to a dessert called 'arroz con leche' which immediately brought me to my childhood years! It was light and wasn't too sweet either! The raisin flavor had chunks of raisins (yum) and definitely had more flavor than vanilla. The coconut had bites of flakey coconuts. I'm not a huge fan of coconut flakes... But this was an exception because the rice pudding had a nice texture with the flakes. \n\nSuch a light and satisfying dessert. I took the three flavors to share with a group of friends.

New customer as I have told the owner/worker.  I mean I would have totally gave them a 5 star for the food tastes/flavor and service I receive for the rice puddings I had here, but I gave a 3 because for the 2nd groupon we used it on a PIE.  \n\nFirst of all lets talk about the rice pudding: We had 1) Coconut (sweet and creamy -strong coconut smell with tiny bits in there too - its' pretty good 2) Rum raisin (My favorite- the rum taste with a cinnamony feeling it's like Halloween/Thanksgiving and Christmas in one package)  3) creamsicle (creamy and good sweet too u guys gotta try it out)  Loved it , the box was generously filled to the rim.  As long as you have it within the 1-3 days it's all good :)  Sho yummy loved it.  \n\nNow for the part where it was -2 stars.  :(  THE PIE: \n\nOkay, I'm new here, so to me Pies are baked warm and sits in a box, you take it home (long downtown drive and parking) and put it in THE FRIDGE when you get home.  NOPE not this PIE... So my significant other brings our PIE home, puts it in the fridge... (funny thing is he told me that it was frozen) So i just thought.... okay they made it and then froze it to keep it fresh... \n\nGuess what??  The next day when we were going to eat the pie, *Opens box* Pie was entirely melted LOL??!! We were both looking at each other shocked like what da heck? It was in box just the crust filled with liquified innards.  SO i looked at him and said... What kind of pie was this suppose to be??  like frozen?? He's like.. i guess so??[Basically nobody had told either of us-that this was suppose to be some type of frozen or ice cream pie???].  I'm not sure if this was our fault or anyone's but  I don't remember signs or  messages while flipping through their Pie catalog seeing any indication that the pie was suppose to be an ice cream or frozen pie?!!  Maybe I'm just ignorant, but shouldn't they have a note or message on the box or a verbal reminder to the person that picks up the PIE to keep it in the freezer?  Or even tell us when they were describing to us how the PIE works?  They just told us flavors, but not that their pie was different from normal pies.. LOL  There goes that groupon down the drain :C\n\nWe ended up just tasting the flavor of the liquid (nice and sweet mocha pie)  Not sure now how the pie would have tasted originally but we tried to refrozen it (of course it's not going to be the same)  - Not sure why there's no mocha flavor after refrozen :C  but it was nasty and I was very disappointed since I was looking forward the whole week to having that PIE.  The thing basically hit the trash \n\nOh and since we're getting so updated to using internet on phones now a days it would have been great if they had wifi so I could show them my groupon easier.  I have 3g on my android but the reception in there was so poor I couldn't connect well, had to run in and out the shop to get connected- Just a suggestion in case the owner reads this review ;)", "author": "Juila L."}

It's right next to the gym so it's perfect as a little treat after a workout.\nThey have froyo and rice pudding. This place is the cutest yummiest little hole in the wall on polk st. This place is pretty popular so the place gets quite busy.\nI got their vanilla froyo with nutella and strawberries. But they have so many different options and combinations you can create! You pick a base for the froyo, either chocolate or vanilla and then you pick your toppings and they blend it for you in this really cool machine. Each order is made separately and they only have one machine so it takes a while until your froyo is made. But it's way worth the wait! What's nice about them mixing it for you is that you get a taste of all your topping in every bite. But just for warning, if you order a fruit topping it can become overwhelming. For instance, the frozen strawberries and vanilla base basically made strawberry ice cream. Just don't expect to taste too much of the vanilla base.\nI've tried their cookies and cream rice pudding which melted in my mouth! I've never been a real big fan of cookies and cream either. I thought it might have been too sweet, but it wasn't. It was perfect.\nThey also have shakes on their menu, which I'm dying to return and try.\nThey take cash, but their prices are very reasonable! A small froyo or rice pudding is around $5. From what I remember they also take card, but with a fee.\nI also heard they had punch cards for frequent visitors, but I didn't get one when I was there. So I must ask when I go again.\nParking is street parking and is pretty hard to find. So cross your fingers you happen to come across someone leaving at the perfect time.\nTheir service was awesome too.

I had the black bottom which is a chocolate ganache that covers the bottom and sides of the cup then topped with rice pudding. Oooohhhh myyyyyyy... so rich, creamy, full flavored, and probably a thousand calories but sooo worth it! I will definitely be having that again.

From there, they take your goodies and whip them up with a blender (think Blizzard/McFlurry-esque) and pipe it into your yogurt cup. It's soooo creamy; I honestly had my doubts about it being either non-fat or fro-yo. I opted for the vanilla base with Junior Mints and Oreos and don't know that I could have made a BETTER choice.

It's one of those neighborhoods that I rarely wander around in, but I know where it is geographically and have a mental picture of what all the buildings in the neighborhood look like. So we decided to take a field trip and walk around this hilly spot. Loving Cup caught our eyes as we wandered down Polk with its cute little sign and storefront. \n\nWe were offered tastings of the various rice puddings, but after just trying the Key Lime flavor, I knew that was what I would be ordering. He had the Mocha Shake. The rice pudding was light in flavor, but still quite filling. It wasn't too sweet! The shake was thick and tasty. Both were made of local and organic ingredients [only six in the rice pudding!].\n\nThere's a lot on their menu, even frozen yogurt for those frogurt fanatics and smoothies/shakes. So much to try!

We couldn't decide (didn't notice the sign until we were leaving, but they have a \"flavor of the day\" which can be helpful for people like us :P) so we just ended up ordering one of each:\n\n**madagascar vanilla with \"black bottom\" (home-made chocolate ganache)**\n**chocolate frozen yogurt with almond butter (you actually see them mixing the flavors together right in front of you!)**\n\nBoth items were very yummy, but I liked the rice pudding a little bit more since it is slightly more unique.

Some notable toppings include pineapple, blueberry, raspberry, peach, strawberry, toffee, oreo, nutella, animal crackers, cookie dough.

It was pretty rich for a frozen yogurt but wasnt too thick which was perfect for my taste. Not too sweet and the crunch of the oreos blended well in the background to the dominant blueberry flavor. \n\nWhat I like about this place is that you can be unique in making your own flavor in a sense. The only bad thing about this place is that they only have 2 machines and it takes about 3-5 mins to make your masterpiece so I imagine the line getting long quickly. CASH ONLY and parking could be a hassle around the area.\n\nI also tried some of the rice pudding which wasnt bad at all but their claim to fame is their blended frozen yogurt.\n\nBottom line: its a must try as its quite unique and i guess the closest thing to compare it to is the coldstone creations but without regrets as I didnt get that nasty feeling you get after eating ice cream.", "author": "Robert Y."}

The vanilla just seemed to be nonexistent and it just tasted like I was eating some creamy thick rice soup. Definite No-no. Had to get the espresso and I asked for a dash of cinnamon on top.

But then I thought to myself \"self, where else in the city can you find RICE PUDDING?\"  After running my errand, I was drawn back and I had to check it out.\n\nThe store is pretty nondescript and there isn't any seating but the centerpiece of the store is really the display case with a variety of RICE PUDDING flavors.   I sampled the lemon, but purchased a small pecan & praline for $3.50.  It seems like a bargain to me!\n\nThe flavors jumped in my mouth.  I loved the added crunch of the nuts, and I like the fact that I can feel the texture of the rice grains amidst the creamy-gooey goodness.  There was also a chocolate variety but I unfortunately forgot to note the 2 other flavors available.  I figure I'll do a better job reporting on my next visit.\n\nAccording to the 2 staffers, the store only opened up about 10 days ago (which would be approximately Nov. 24).  \n\nWhen I asked whether the rice pudding was truly made from local ingredients (there aren't many rice growers in the Bay Area), they did not know the answer.  They did mention it was prepared in Berkeley, however, since the location is not equipped for on premise cooking.  I left my business card and asked if the owner could let me know how the pudding is either local, organic or all natural.  I hope I'll get my answer soon.\n\nI suppose my only complaint at the moment is that the \"local, organic all natural\" claims are not self evident when you are in the store.

The mango blend was just not sweet enough for me. As others have mentioned...they use REAL fruit so I should have expected it to not be that sweet.

It's $3.50 for a small with one free topping (and another free topping i think? if u do a yelp check in on ur phone...but i dont have a phone that can do that sooo) and 75 cents extra for each additional topping.  A bit expensive in my opinion (since I've been spoiled by socal's, \"Yogurtland\" which was 30 cents/ounce self serve...though I heard they've gone up to 35 cents/ounce).\n\n*3rd check in as of 10/14...got the junior mints swirled into vanilla base yogurt....verry verry good. As a few others have mentioned, it tastes a lot like mint chocolate chip ice cream/froyo/etc (which was/is one of my ultimate favorites) \n\nCONCLUDING WORDS/ADVICE-choose a sweet topping if ur only going with one topping.", "author": "G L."}

I purchased a Groupon and was able to get 3 pints of rice pudding or frozen yogurt at half price, so my friends and I came earlier this week to pick our flavors. They had 6 flavors available that day, and we sampled almost all of them (and split the samples, of course!). I thought the Pecan Praline and Chocolate Chip were too sweet, but enjoyed the Coconut and Creamsicle (had a surprisingly refreshing hint of orange). I didn't try the Cinnamon Rum Raisin because I knew I wouldn't like the rum or raisins in it, and ended up choosing the Madagascar Vanilla Bean because I liked the simplicity of it. However, if it weren't so cold, we would have chosen to go with the frozen yogurt instead because of their awesome machine! They have a machine that whips the topping into the frozen yogurt, so it is completely blended in versus just being sprinkled on top. I will definitely have to come back to check that out. The staff is really patient, and Loving Cup is highly recommended!", "author": "Amy D."}

All their rice puddings are made with the Madagascar Vanilla Bean base, so if you're like me and like yourself some good vanilla aroma & taste, mm mm, then you'll like it.  I sampled shamelessly and ended up with 1/2 nutella, 1/2 coconut (fresh AND toasted mixed in).  The pudding is just the right level of thickness and the arborio rice isn't mushy, holds its own. \n\nFROYO:  Even better!  Just watching them make it was amazing.  I thought they were going to do the mix-ins like Coldstone, with a spoon, not this high powered DRILL.  So pro.  We had Vanilla with English Toffee and PB mix-in.  holy mac it was good.  Froyo isn't too soft which I liked.\n\nSo in summary:  order what we ordered.  Nutella and Coconut Rice pudding.

My friend was driving like a mad woman trying to get us there on time (we were stopped at a traffic light for 10 minutes by a VIP motorcade driving through the city and we were very upset and were yelling like crazy). We were even strategically planning how I was to hop out of the car and order everything for the both of us, and I've never had Loving Cup before so the process was new to me. Basically you choose a chocolate or vanilla base for your yogurt (we combined both chocolate and vanilla!) and then you pick your toppings. My friend had strawberry and peach toppings, and I had banana and oreos! The Loving Cup machine man sticks the froyo base into the magical machine along with your toppings, the machine mixes it all together, and out comes a perfect Loving cup full of perfection. So fresh, so clean and yum. We ordered smalls but the Loving Cup machine man stacked our mix into a beautifully swirled mountain of yogurt.\n\nMy friend and I sat in her car eating our froyos, and when Loving Cup closed their doors promptly at 9:30, we saw many who came too late and were denied.

I have sampled many many frozen yogurt shops around sf and sac, and I think this is the most unique.\n\nRather then just flavors, this place mixes in your ingredients with either vanilla or chocolate ice cream. This allows for an eclectic mix of flavors, as you can choose from a large variety of various toppings ( nutella, espresso, cookie dough, sprinkles, ect 26 in all). The only potential downside of this is that if you pick a poor flavor combination, there is nothing to save you ahead of time because its completely up to you to figure it out. So the rating of this place probably can sway a bunch because if you order an odd combo then it could suck. \n\nAs far as the place itself, it was simple and clean, very inviting. Additionally, the staff is very friendly.  Finally, the serving sizes are very generous. Excellent. \n\nHighly recommended.", "author": "Tom O."}

We were waiting for our reservation at La Folie and our group was haaaangry.  We noticed this little place open next door and decided to try it.  I love rice pudding and my husband loves yogurt.  We were not disappointed.  The rice pudding is delicious and their frozen yogurt is even better.  i'm not sure what machines they use but you get a vanilla or chocolate yogurt base and then you choose your mix-ins from there.  I went with a chocolate base with almond butter and almonds.  It was divine.  My husband went with a vanilla base with junior mints and toffee.  I was a little skeptical of his combination but it was tasty.  I just love how their little machine whips everything up and distributes it evenly within the yogurt.  This isn't like Cold Stone or other ice cream mix-in places where they mix it in by hand on a marble stone.  This little gadget really gets things 'ground' up so to say and mixed into your yogurt.

I opted for Coconut and Espresso.  Both were pretty tasty but they just weren't as good as the ones we had tasted in Portland.

They really pack it in! The small was definitely more than enough. I barely put a dent in my cup and I was super full. My friends and I asked for caps so we can save it for later. I think they need to offer a smaller size because in my opinion, the small was pretty big for a small.\n\nI'm glad I gave rice pudding a shot though!

Our pup was with us and there is a bench outside, so we decided to go for it. I must admit, we have walked past it before thinking, \"how good can rice pudding and frozen yogurt be,\" but I am sorry we did! What makes the LC different from all the other froyo shops is, you pick a base (chocolate or vanilla) then add as many flavors as you'd like, and they puree it for you. They also serve hot beverages. Anyway, the rice pudding is a great alternative to a heavy and rich dessert. It was light with the right about of sweetness and very satisfying. The best part about it is, you can add delicious flavors to it, such as: pecans, pretzels, fruits, etc. We tried it with pecans and it was great. We also indulged in a vanilla base, with nutella and pistachios. How amazing does that sound?! IT WAS!

My first visit was on both a holiday weekend and a hot day which accounted for the crowd of people hovering in the doorway. Loving Cup is a small shop that feels like a mix between a cottage kitchen and an art gallery. They individually swirl the non-fat fro-yo for each order. But, it's the work of only one machine, so it's one fro-yo at a time. After the rush of people cleared out, I got my first cup of Lovin' which was totally worth the wait. I prefer my yogurt to be a bit more tart and a little less icy, but I still enjoyed my cup nonetheless. I also like that they use real frozen fruit. \n\nMy next weekday visit, I found rockstar parking right in front, and there was no wait at all. Let me tell you--if you were to taste their rice pudding blindfolded you would never guess that it was made from non-fat milk! It's the perfect blend of sweetness and creamy fluffy rice, just enough to trick the most diet-conscious dessert seeker. A few awesome flavors: coconut, rum raisin and key lime.\n\n2 stars are just for their support of The Arts and their effort to encourage customers to be environmentally responsible. I visited them twice in a week and they had already rotated their featured artwork. Kudos for serving desserts with compostable spoons in paper cups! They also have bins for recyclables and compostables, which are neatly disguised in a cottage style oak cabinet. The signage needs to be a bit more prominently displayed for customers' ease of use, but hey--way to be forward thinking!\n\nI do wish they could make some non-dairy options, which I was told is in the works. Until then, I'll just pop a milk pill cuz this pudding is dee-lish!", "author": "Kira R."}

You go in, pick your frozen yogurt base and the flavor you want added.  They scoop the hard-packed yogurt into a machine that looks like a drill press, toss in the topping of choice, then press it all through the machine a few times in order to mix the topping in evenly.\n\nFor people who don't want to trek to the north end of the city to try them out, they also just opened a shop down in Mission Bay.", "author": "Kaman C."}

I'm a frozen yogurt-devouring machine--although being mildly lactose-intolerant does sometimes put a halt on my froyo-devouring abilities...I digress.\n\nMy close friend introduced me to this place and I'm in looooooooooove! The only sad part about it is: I live too far away and I'm too cheap to spend $5 everyday on frozen yogurt. ): So for now, I'll just... dream about the next time I come back to this place. \n\nNow, when my friend told me that we were commuting THAT far just for frozen yogurt, I thought she was insane...because seriously, we were in downtown and there were a handful of frozen yogurt places in the vicinity (Yocup, Pinkberry, Tuttimelon, Yoppi Yogurt, etc). All of these places pale in comparison. \n\nSo there we are, sitting on the 27 Muni, riding to Polk just for froyo. We all know the sketchy reputation Muni has--or maybe it's the sketchy people that ride the Muni that give it such a reputation--so was the yogurt worth it? YES. \n\nI ordered a small vanilla-based frozen yogurt with peaches, mangoes and blueberries. The fruits were frozen, but it's okay! It tasted like the best smoothie ever and I say this because they blend whatever toppings you choose in a fancy machine with the vanilla or chocolate froyo base that you choose and BAYUM: your froyo. There's also the option of 1/2 vanilla, 1/2 chocolate. They pump it out into one big mountainous swirl, which my friend called a \"delicious poopie.\"  Beware, the small is way bigger than a \"small,\" so I guess it is worth the $5. They charge for any additional toppings after the first, so choose wisely! They also charge you if you decide to eat inside...\n\nThe place is spotless and very cute! The frozen yogurt is rich and creamy, and they have a variety of fruits, nuts, and sweets (nutella, gummybears, etc) that you can blend into the froyo base of your choosing. Prices can get a little steep, as they aren't at all like those $.45/oz, watered down frozen yogurt franchises, but the couple extra dollars definitely shows in quality of the product. \n\nThere are also lemonades, and rice puddings and other sweets. You can ask to sample the rice puddings too, and might I say, the coconut rice pudding is divine! \n\nI'm only giving this 4-stars because the young lady working the counter seemed like she didn't want to be there. Maybe it was just an off day. She was nice, nonetheless--quiet, but nice. She also may need to learn some food safety and sanitation procedures because she not only touched her phone multiple times, but she also touched her face/fixed her hair without washing her hands and making our food/catering to other customers. \n\nLoving Cup on a sunny, yet breezy San Francisco day: PERFECT.  \n\nDelicious poopie, I will be back for you.", "author": "Rebecca N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-07-12", "description": "I'm writing a review based on two parts:  Customer Service and The Yogurt/Rice Pudding.  I went on 7/11/12 around 9:30 pm\n\nFirst of all, I love food and have been to many dessert places across DC, NYC, LA, and most of the major cities and definitely understand what is out there.  I've done Napa food: French Laundry, Ad Hoc, and Jose Andres's food in DC and LA as well as sampling fair share of desserts and yogurts.  Take it as you will.  \n\nCustomer Service:\nI'm generally not a hard person to please.  As an example, I'm not a person who writes a review based on whether or not the waiter comes over and refills water or doesn't get the check right.  To some extent, there's simply miscommunication and misunderstanding. \n\nThis experience was, however, was TOTALLY different.  If you see the woman with glasses on who's hair is bleach blonde and in a pony tail, this is who I'm referring too.  I was with a friend and I ordered my ice as usual.  I'm coming from D.C. and of course, she took me to a nice place such as this.  Well, my friend all of a sudden snuck in front of me and paid for my icecream and gave the lady the credit card.  I was of course shocked that she did this because I'm staying at her place so I wanted to pay for her dessert at the very least.  So I tried to hand over my card to the cashier lady and even a straight 10.00 bill (because that's how much it costed) but she never took it because of course the decision was already made (even though she had trouble swiping and fumbling with the card that was given.).  I was being insistant that I should pay for about 5 secs but my friend declined and nudged me in kindness.  So then I said to the cashier later, \"Ahh you're suppose to take the GUY's card!\"  in jest.  I suppose she didn't see it as an act of kindess and me joking around with her.  She replied back in a RUDE and Disrespectful tone: \n\n\"DON'T TELL ME WHO'S CARD TO TAKE!  YOU'RE SUPPOSE TO FIGURE THAT OUT WHEN YOU GET HERE.\"\n\n\"WOW!\" I was thinking in my mind.  I really wanted to say, \"excuse me? can you be a little light-hearted and laugh?  Or maybe say \"Sorry\" with a smile?'  I kept on thinking \"WOW!\"\n\nSo look, she can write a review back and say, \"there's a line and I had to get things done quickly.\"  Look that's no excuse to treat a customer or even talk to someone disrespectfully to someone.  I'm sorry but perhaps you as a business owner should look into pleasing your customers first and maybe buying a second icecream mixer?\n\nSo of course, I left it alone and went an ate my icecream in sole disappointment all because of customer experience.  WORST I've ever been treated.  I had waiters miss water, the bill, food orders, and taking a while, but never had they ever talked to me in a disrespectful tone and manner.  Honestly, I'm not hard to please.  \n\nNow for the Food Review:\n\nRice pudding is good, but if you've been to Rice to Riches in NYC, they're even better.  \n\nNothing really THAT special about the yogurt.  They simply just mix it with toppings and such much like you would get at cold stone or marble slap.  So what if it's evenly mixed.  I'd be much happier getting something as simple as Pinkberry or Red Mango.\nOr should I even dare say, McDonald's McFlurry?  Look, alot of this is also the fact that it's in San Francisco and it's in a little cutesy neighborhood with nothing else around.  Great cute store, but honestly if you really think about the way they made the icecream and their ingredients, nothing really special.\n\nAll and all, horrible customer service, all because I was trying to be friendly and pay for my friend and the cashier couldn't take a joke.  Yogurt and Rice pudding...there's better and it's really the \"cutesyness\" of it all.", "author": "Gary T."}

They don't have many flavors each day like Rice to Riches so it was a bit disappointing.  However, I tried toffee flavor and praline pecan.  I loved the toffee flavor!  I was so content after that.

And while I did get a bit into the frozen yogurt craze, I never became a slave to it.  Loving Cup, which also happens to serve frozen yogurt, has opened up to throw something different into the mix.\n\nFlavors often rotate.  The Madagascar Vanilla Bean and Nutella (chocolate) were a lil too plain for my tastes.  And the Rum Raisin was loaded with raisins.  My picks are the Creamsicle--similar to the vanilla, but with an orange twist--and the Pistachio, which is always a favorite.  The Chai rounds out my top three.  \n\nThe price-to-portion ratio is reasonable, and on par for what you'd pay for frozen yogurt.  Rice pudding just happens to be a lot more filling.  In addition to their homemade yogurt are homemade pastries, dairy and non-dairy smoothies.  The ingredients used are mostly organic, and the containers and utensils are compostable.  The staff is also incredibly friendly.  Good comfort food and nice folks always brighten a day.  \n\nThey've got a hold on the market now, but I could see that changing.

I was thinking froyo like those other places (tuttimelon, icebee, jubili)...Wrong! It is totally organic and local here. They don't use mass produced items. They make everything in-house. Their decor is like sorta a modernized old ice cream parlor. They have this machine, where they insert the frozen yogurt. The swivel swivels it up. She put it back into the cup, mixing whatever you want in it, and it mixes and comes out in the most beautiful twisted swirled frozen yogurt.\n\nThe cool part is that with whatever topping(s) you want, it blends completely with the frozen yogurt. So, the vanilla becomes, vanilla with almond butter and pistachio (lemme say delicious) or vanilla with rainbow sprinkles, or vanilla with blueberries, etc. etc....there are so many options to choose from that it is actually good that you have to wait in line while they make your yogurt.

I was pretty excited to see this place open, as I love snacks.  There are several different kinds of pudding here, that appear homemade.  Some flavors, key lime (which is eternally popular), plain vanilla, pistachio, almond.  I love the semi sweet pistachio flavor, but it is a bit on the nutty side for me.\n\nThe great thing about this place is that it is open until 940 pm, which makes it a delicious after dinner or before bar hopping treat on Polk.  Most snack stores close early, so Loving Cup has cornered the market here.  There is also an eat in section with little stools by the window if you care to enjoy your pudding in the shop.  I would love to see some water pitchers as the pudding can be quite sweet.\n\nOne bite of a small pudding is very satisfying.  I love the way the rice dissolves deliciously into utter sweetness.  I can imagine keeping this in my fridge but that would make me fat.  Is there a secret rice pudding recipe?  I am tempted to try to make the rice pudding to see if there is nuance to their blend.\n\nThe pudding looks very homemade, as in DIY, and I cannot decide whether this is a good or bad thing.  I initially thought that at three dollars for a small and five dollars for a medium, that this place was a bit on the expensive side.  One can justify a five dollar yogurt, because no one is going to make yogurt at home, but rice pudding is fairly simple.\n\nI tried to do an ROI calculation on how much it would cost to make rice pudding on my own, and I determined that for four servings it might be about fifteen dollars, which makes this store a good bang for you buck.

I didn't know either, but to sum it up, each cup of yogurt is made with a lot of love. They individually churn each order with the mix-in toppings of your choice until everything fuses into one creamy mixture.  The process is more involved than the usual push the lever, watch the yogurt squeeze out, so the wait is longer, but it is worth it because the portions are huge and it truly tastes like a loving cup.\n\nThe best flavor i've had is the vanilla base with nutella.  You can see them put in liberal amounts of the nutella straight from the jar.  Almond butter is also interesting if you like almond butter.  Oreo and english toffee are also great.  I'm not such much of a fan of animal crackers or the fruit flavors.  The animal crackers kind of just taste like a powdery residue and the fruit is frozen so it doesn't have as much flavor.  I wonder how amazing it would be if they used fresh fruit though...\n\nI'm not a fan of rice pudding in general so I won't really comment on that but  apparently the pudding is freshly made in Berkeley in an industrial sized kitchen and then delivered over.  \n\nI've already brought 3 sets of friends to loving cup since I was introduced to it and they all rave about it too.

So, here's the scoop on Loving Cup (that's kind of a pun since they serve rice pudding, I guess). This place is capitalizing on a trend that's gathered steam in New York, serving expensive and delicious pudding to the masses. But unlike some of the posh, blinged out pudding and froyo places on the East Coast, Loving Cup is down-home, neighborhoody and inviting. I'm a big fan of the vanilla bean and the pistachio. Unequivocally better than any rice pudding I can recall ordering at a restaurant. Also, the portions are huge! A small cup is plenty for one person, maybe even two people if you just ate dinner. An XL pudding is basically a bucket. Good friggin luck.  \n\nWhoever owns this place must be a smart businessman/woman/thing because they've made sure to include the old standbys: smoothies, good coffee (cheaper than the Buck, I reckon), and froyo. So you can pretty much get it all. And they seem to stay open later than expected (I swear I've walked by at 11pm on a Saturday and they're serving to all the folks who just came from Tonic next door). \n\nThis is a fine addition to Polk St. It's nice to see it gaining popularity and that it's managing to attract a consistent crowd.

It feels light, airy, and precious; almost like you're walking on delicious rice pudding. They also currently have framed paper cutouts by a local artist that nicely fits into the shop's decor.\n\nLoving Cup sells rice pudding, custom frozen yogurt, teeny weeny cutesy cupcakes, and other pastry goods. It's rare to find a dessert shop selling rice pudding alongside frozen yogurt, especially in SF.\n\nFrom the various flavors I choose to play it safe with the Madagascar vanilla rice pudding. A small is a hefty $3.75, but the cup is also hefty. I felt so fat afterwards. Loving Cup is ironically located a short distance from a gym. I feel sorry for those guys. They grate cinnamon and nutmeg for free. It really adds something special to the pudding. I can't really back up the pudding with much enthusiasm. It's good, but I can't help but be reminded of the Cozy Shack brand when eating it. If you do get the rice pudding, try out some of the more adventurous flavors. The vanilla might bore you.\n\nIf I were to return I'd try out the yogurt because of all the reviews.", "author": "Michael H."}

Small, simply decorated interior with a few places to sit inside and outside. I have yet to try the pudding, which seems like what' their known for, or were before the fro-yo craze hit. But their fro-yo is my favorite I've ever had. Simple, you pick either vanilla or choc. Then you decide what you want as your 'topping' instead it's not just a topping they mix it all up. I'm a peanutbutterholic so any time pb is an option no matter how much I may want something else or how curious I am to a different flavor I just can't pull the trigger to stray. So unfortunatley I can't speak to many other options. But i gotta say everything I've mixed with the pb has been bomb. My latest favorite is vanilla base, with peanutbutter and bananas. They put it all in this machine and it churns it all up. AND oh the best part is the peanut butter is fresh made there in the shop! They also do almond butter. \nMy pal that I usually go w/ is a sucker for nutella - so she does that and it's delish as well. Very good spot, go there instead of tutti melon next time you're on polk and you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Audrey V."}

I am so thrilled to have happened upon Loving Cup!\n\nI was on my way to a client yesterday when I walked by the place. Rice pudding is an unusual dessert item to see here on the West Coast, so I was intrigued.I am a gluten-free eater, so any place that has a treat that is gluten-free is a bonus. I was warmly greeted by Liz, the proprietress. She is proud of her shop and she has reason to be. Bright, clean, and comfy place with a nice display of the fare. \n\nI tasted the Madagascar Vanilla pudding and was duly impressed. Not too sweet, tasted from-scratch homemade. I purchased a \"small\" (plenty of pudding for a 2:45pm snack) with Lemon Vanilla and a bit of Nutella. It's cool, creamy, and delightfully earthy. Those of you who are lemon fans, the Lemon Vanilla satisfies - you can see the lemon zest in the stuff. And Nutella fans will love her recipe. Yum yum yum! And everything seems to be organic, and eco-friendly compostable spoons provided. Did not try the pro-biotic frozen yogurt, but will next time.\n\nOh, and the 'Churros' cinnamon crisped rice treat! What a hit. Haven't seen it anywhere else and it's fantastic.\n\nThanks, Liz! I hope Loving Cup is around for a long time.

That's right, mix in, not just put on top.  Being that it was my first time, I really had no idea what to try, but I wanted it to come out good! I heard someone else in line order chocolate with banana and animal crackers. Sounded pretty good. I asked the friendly guy working there for a recommendation and he suggested vanilla with strawberries and chocolate ganache... so I went with it. So good and unique! \n\nNow I just have to go back because I'm curious about that chocolate/banana/animal cracker combo. I'm also looking forward to reading some yelp reviews to learn what other awesome concoctions people have come up with. Can't wait to go back.

I had a small rice pudding with 2 flavours: coconut and rum raisin. I have been wanting to come here for awhile. Super nice young black guy working the counter, very outgoing and very conversational. First off, a small rice pudding is huge. Definitely good for 1 person, and i would've split it w/ my boyfriend if he liked rice pudding. coconut had lovely tender flakes of coconut, rum rasin was cinnamony ad had plenty of raisins. I did feel like there was alittle something missinh though, perhaps vanilla. They had vanilla rice pudding, but there should b alittle vanilla in each. I feel like it was lacking alittle flavour. The frozen yougurt machine was really cool! They put in frozen bananas and the machine mixed it up completely to the point that there were no banana bits that i could even taste, it just made the frozen yougurt taste like banana- which was really cool. Gummybears were topped on top, and they were fresh too however they freeze and get harder 2 chew- which just happens if you put them on something cold. The guy said they get realy busy super late at night for some reason. Afew bar stool seats w/ coutertop facing window inside, and a little bench outside. Really cute, friendly, and clean shop, and they certainly give you your money's worth!", "author": "Brittainie B."}

Yesterday, while ambling around Russian Hill, I couldn't resist walking into this cute shop after some window shopping.  I was initially drawn in to sample the rice pudding, thinking it would be orgasmically similar to Manhattan's Rice To Riches, but it's not nearly as sinful given it's made with non-fat milk.  It's a healthy indulgence to be sure, but it could use a little more fat to qualify as a true comfort food.  I opted for a small chocolate frozen yogurt instead, and watched as she used the frozen yogurt machine to mix it.  It's actually really cool!  \nThe first bite of the yogurt was chocolately with a slight yogurt tang, but all that melted away with subsequent spoonfuls.  It was slightly sweet, clean tasting and refreshing!  Though not as good as Fraiche (which just opened up on Fillmore!!!), I liked it nearly as much and walked back into the store to ask for my frequent buyer card.

They take out your choice of base in a hockey puck shape out of a bag. put it in a grinding machine then they add the toppings. They run it through twice to make sure it is all fused together well.

In regards to the yogurt, I might try to have some toppings on top as I do miss sometimes having crunchy shit in my yogurt.  Thanks Liz and team for a good experience today...the slate has been wiped clean!  Besides, how can you not love a place named after one of my favorite songs and that has great pics of one of my favorites bands (the Stones) on the wall.\n\nHmm...so this is weird.  About two months ago I was singing some serious praises for this place in my \"My City\" write-up in the Examiner (http://www.sfexaminer.com/entertainment/My-City-Banana-bread-frogurt-and-taking-in-a-game-43550157.html) and tonight I just had one of the worst \"dining\" experiences I've had in a while.  There used to be two really, really sweet, cool girls who worked all the time, what happened to them?  \n\nAnyway...so like usual, me and a couple of friends go to Loving Cup excited to eat some good frozen yogurt.  We walk in, take a look at the toppings while trying to figure out what which ones we wanted and then bam!...all of the sudden, some really rude voice from behind the counter says \"You know, everything you see there is on the wall listed\".  It wasn't just said in a helpful voice, but in a rude, \"hurry up\" voice.  What if I wanted to look at the toppings versus read words such as \"Junior Mints\"?  Strike one.  Then, as we are deciding what we want (and letting people go ahead of us), the same girl (heavy-set, blonde hair) says \"let's start with chocolate or vanilla, then go from there\", again rushing us.  Strike two.  I then make my decision...\"I'll have half chocolate, half vanilla\" and she says \"you may as well just get all chocolate, it will taste the same\" and me and my friends look at each other puzzled.  How will half chocolate and half vanilla taste the same as all chocolate?  Just doesn't make sense.  Let me just order what I want...I'm the paying customer...right?  Strike three.  I then tell this very unhappy girl what I want, they make it (won't make a big deal that it was much less yogurt than usual)  and when I go to pay and ask for the punch card and the punches for me and my two friends (which I paid for) and she said \"only one punch per visit.\"  Um, we bought three things...why only one punch?  She then realized that was absurd and then gave us one punch each on three separate cards.  I said \"that isn't how punch cards work normally in restaurants\" and she said \"people have really been taking advantage of the punch cards.\"  That's her response...really?  Taking advantage of punch cards.  Loving cup owners...I think you should install a punch card security system to crack down on those \"punch stealers\".  This is absurd.  So yeah...the other guy working really wasn't too nice either and hasn't been the last couple of times I've been there but this girl really left a mark.  \n\nCongrats Loving Cup, it's been about a year since I've posted a review, good or bad, but tonight just couldn't go untold.  Still deciding if I will return, but I do know one thing...I'll never list them as my favorite yogurt place again.", "author": "Jared P."}

On the way I kept chanting that line from the movie Freaks, \"A loving cup, a loving cup.  We accept her, we accept her gooble gobble, gooble gobble.  We accept her, we accept her, one of us, one of us.\"  I was in such a good mood and laughing because of the line that I thought I'd have fun at the restaurant.  Well it's not really a restaurant.  Unfortunately, they didn't have any seating, so we knew immediately we'd have to enjoy our  pudding elsewhere.  The employee behind the counter was very nice and he handed out samples, but it's a little strange. Every time he dipped in with a mini-spoon, it looked like he was dipping into your mama's pot of nastiness.  It just didn't look palatable.  They had only three flavors in the case when we dropped by, which were Almond Butter, Creamsicle, and Chocolate, all of which were merely okay.   My sister ordered the last bit of Madagascar Vanilla Bean, which was already packed in a medium container and the guy offered to make her a black bottom, which meant that he'd put it in another container where he smeared some Nutella on the bottom.  But did the stuff taste good?  Eh.  Quite frankly, Kozy Shack Rice Pudding, the stuff you find in your local grocery, is richer and creamier than this boutique stuff.  If you come, then make sure you bring cash.  Although there is an ATM close by, the guy didn't know where it was and it's a pain to have to go out of your way.  Oh, and by the way.  There is a cool little tip cup next to the cash register that says \"Loving Cup Coffee.\"  I assume this was the inspiration for the store name.  But really, there was no table service, the flavor of their feature item is lacking, and they don't take credit cards.  Why would I give you a tip?

First, Loving Cup is an incredibly friendly and upbeat establishment. I've been there dozens of times, and no matter who is behind the counter, the staff is consistently full of smiles and hellos and questions about how your day is going. Second, their rice pudding is out of this world. Every day they have about 6 different flavors. My favorite is definitely the Almond Butter, but the Coconut and the Cinnamon Rum Raisin are close seconds. Their rice pudding is made from just 6 ingredients (nonfat milk, Arborio rice, eggs, sugar, salt, and vanilla bean, plus whatever flavor/topping you choose) and a small Madagascar Vanilla packs just 195 calories and 3.5 grams of fat. They also have all-natural, nonfat frozen yogurt which is hand-churned to order, and I'd imagine quite delicious, but I've historically stuck to the rice pudding.

The main feature is their rice puddings, but the froyo is my new fav in the city. I did sample the cinnamon rum raisin pudding and it was good, I'm just not into rice pudding in general. The flavors were very pronounced, though, and I'd go here if I grew up on rice pudding and actually considered it a dessert. \nOh the froyo!! You start with base of chocolate or vanilla, then add whatever mix-ins and they swirl it up. Reminds me of Coldstone, but much more delicious and healthier!! I had vanilla mixed with organic animal crackers (the Disney ones from Costco). So perfect! Other mix-ins I remember were Oreo, peanut and almond butters and strawberries. The lady working was super nice and offered me samples of all the puddings. Also had some pastries for sale- muffins, cookies, cupcakes. The small is $3.75 and includes one mix-in. Kinda pricy,  just a bit over my limit, please don't raise prices :) Can't wait to return!!", "author": "Heather I."}

And on Russian Hill there's not that many places open in the evenings just for dessert so we were psyched. Even though their sign on the front door claims that they're open 11:00-9:00pm \"everyday\" my 6 year-old son and I walked in around 3:00pm just to be sure that they would be open after dinner for a treat. The woman said \"oh yes, until 9:00pm!\". Fast forward to 6:45pm the SAME DAY! After dinner we put on our warm clothes and walk down there and--- they're completely closed, chairs up, lights out. Cue the disappointed six year-old (and 40year-old). Now I understand that things happen, but if you want to endear yourself with neighborhood locals who would frequent you 2-3 times a week, and recommend you to friends and family, don't start off by making commitments that you're not going to keep. I hope this place makes it, I really do, but flaking out on potential regulars is not a very good way to start. ***UPDATE A few days after my post I got a relatively nice note from someone @ Loving Cup explaining that they closed earlier that day due to an electrical problem.

What if you crave plain old chocolate or vanilla? Or (gasp!) BOTH! \nNo swirls here, folks. And don't worry about overindulging. That small cup was literally half full. And no, I did not get a mix in. I was charged as though I had got one, but I did not. \nFor $3.75, I received approximately 1/3 cup of frozen yogurt. I'm pretty sure the fro yo is not organic. The rice pudding may be. I don't know. I don't eat rice pudding, so it matters not to me. In any event, 1/3 cup of frozen yogurt for $3.75? At my usual yogurt store, I receive at least 3 times as much, no exaggeration, for $.25 less. Probably more like 4x as much, and sometimes more, depending on the server. \nAnd, I don't get charged for toppings I do not want or receive. That makes no sense! I like frozen yogurt cuz it's fat free. I don't want to add candy, as it adds fat and more sugar. I don't want fruit in my frozen yogurt. So why be charged for it? Arrrrgh! \nYou can get fancy gelato at Naia for these prices.  And you'll have more choices and can get more flavors in one cup!\nOh well, the store is cute. The person working there was nice enough. But for frozen yogurt? No way. I'll walk the extra 10 blocks for sure. \nOh, and it does take a long time to make one yogurt, even if I hadn't had several questions (I did). Not worth it.", "author": "Allucaneat G."}

The pistachio rice pudding and the PB & banana smoothie are my favorites. There's endless sweet combinations with all the toppings and add-ins. The only thing is that it is dangerously close to where I work so I go there way too often!", "author": "Maggie F."}

The location is really cute and inviting, just what is needed to put you at ease and in the mood for the experience.  Both RP (rice pudding) and FY (frozen yogurt) is on the menu, and I've tried both, but the FY is the way to go.  Each serving is prepared individually, unwrapped and put through a diabolical looking machine, with your choice of toppings.  No clock watching here!  The English Toffee seems to work best for me.  Its the penultimate GFE (Great Food Experience).   What a discovery!  Plus its totally legal.", "author": "David T."}

I live around the corner and have been here every single day since it has opened; and Im not even a big frozen yogurt fan. Anyone with a sweet tooth must go here. They have an edge over any other fro yo joint in the city because it's old fashioned creamy style AND they mix in the toppings as opposed to throwing them on top. The chick who runs it is rad and their cinnamon rice krispie treats taste like churros. The pistachio and cookies & cream rice pudding are legit.  Great addition to Polk St.", "author": "Kit V."}
