{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-09-27", "description": "Have you ever wanted to like something so badly, but you just couldn't do it no matter how much you tried?\n\nFor me, that neatly applied to La Briciola. One of the many intimate Italian restaurants in San Francisco, La Briciola seemingly offered an exquisite array of pasta dishes. Despite the higher-end cost (about $20+ for most items), my girlfriend and I gave this place a try in hopes of experiencing amazing Italian food. The restaurant was located on 3rd street near the freeway, so we only had to walk about 10 minutes to get there. Why not give it a shot right? \n\nUnfortunately, it didn't turn out the way we wanted. \n\nIn terms of the menu options, La Briciola served a wide range of pasta creations to go along with appetizers and entrees. We were really intrigued by some of the bolder dishes such as their squid ink spaghetti. We ended up settling for two of their seasonal items: The Spinach Ravioli in Mushroom Cream Sauce and a Meat Lasagna. Here's what we thought of the experience:\n\n-- MEDIOCRE FOOD, CONSIDERING PRICE --\nIf there was one takeaway from our food, it was that the average quality and lackluster portions definitely didn't justify the premium price. \n\n+ House Bread (8/10): Sadly, probably the best thing we ate here didn't even cost us a penny. Their complimentary bread was pretty darn good. It was hot, the olive oil dip was unique by actually having real bits of crushed olives, and I loved the crunchiness of each piece. Unfortunately, some pieces were unevenly cooked and had burnt marks. \n\n- Ravioli With Cream Sauce (6/10): This was just okay. I definitely felt cheated because, for almost $20, my plate only had like 10 pieces of ravioli at most. I ate that thing so fast, and even sipped up all the sauce, but it didn't satisfy my stomach. The ravioli pieces were just okay too - not hot enough and I felt like it was missing meat. Sauce was good and creamy, but it would've been better with more ingredients.\n\n- Meat Lasagna (5/10): According to my girlfriend, this was way too oily. And you could see it! The tomato-based sauce was literally separating from the oil in front of our eyes. I mean the dish tasted fine (not the worst), and it came out hotter than my ravioli, but we've definitely had better for a much cheaper price point. Again, portion size here was really sad. \n\n-- GOOD ATMOSPHERE FOR DATE --\nRegardless of the food, the setting was effectively suitable for a date night. Lighting was great, there was plenty of seating, and I enjoyed the music playing in the background as well. \n\n-- OKAY SERVICE, KINDA SLOW -- \nEmployees here were nice, but I didn't really like the fact that they took their time to serve and approach us. Especially since we were one of the only customers at the restaurant, it was surprising that they were a bit sluggish.\n\nFor the price, I probably wouldn't come back to La Briciola. The food wasn't horrible per say, but I honestly feel like there are better options out there. I give this restaurant a \"Tolerable, sufficient for sustenance\" rating.\n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

There was one waiter and one busboy for the whole restaurant. We were waiting for everything. \n\nCaesar salad was not good. Linguine Vongole was also not good - clams were not fresh and tasted/smelled fishy.

The restaurant offered us some free bread and olive oil with some kind of paste while we waited for our dishes to come out.\n\nWe decided to order the following dishes:\n\nGnocchi Sorrentina (5/5) - I love potato dumplings and cheese. They were especially tasty and chewy. I recommend this dish.\nLasagna di Carne (5/5) - The lasagna had a lot of sauce/flavor to it. This is more of a soft and moist lasagna. I recommend this dish.\nRisotto al nero di seppia (5/5) - I love squid ink dishes. Since I've tried squid ink spaghetti before, I wanted to try it with risotto. The calamari and scallops were delicious. I highly recommend this dish if you like squid ink.\nCannoli (3/5) - This was my first time trying a cannoli and I wasn't too pleased with it. I didn't really like the sweet ricotta filling.\n\nThe restaurant is big enough to have small group seating, but I would recommend to make a reservation in advance if you have a larger group. The interior design is simple with dim lighting and candles on each table. The setting is casual, so you don't need to dress up fancy. The service was excellent. The food was delicious and the portion sizes are generous for an Italian restaurant. We couldn't finish all three of our main entrees, so we took home our leftovers. We had a great experience and were super pleased with the food. We would definitely come back here again!\n\nI don't recommend driving to the restaurant because the restaurant is located on a busy street.

Like Cotogna last weekend, the pasta is super al dente (although slightly less so than Cotogna). \n\nI got the lamb ragu. The pasta was certainly impressive in length (9\"+) and was just thick enough to have good bite. However, it was quite bland on its own. Given the slickness of the pasta, the lamb did not mix well with the pasta and sat at the bottom of the dish. The ground lamb did impart a lamb-y sort of smell to the pasta, but was quite bland (and lacking in salt). The tomato taste to the sauce was also quite light.\n\nI can't comment on the service since I got takeout, but they were nice about letting me take a seat as I waited for my order. Cute interior. \n\nThe bread that they included was some of the best bread I've had in a long time though! Chewy crust that had just enough moisture, combined with dense soft bread. I ate the entire portion they gave me, and that rarely happens with takeout bread.", "author": "Nicole H."}

A small Italian restaurant in Soma, La Briciola was not busy and attended to us quickly. Their service was good. \n\nThe food was okay. The Caesar salad and calamari starters were decent, nothing out of the ordinary and just what you would expect. I ordered the Tagliatelleai with mushrooms and truffle oil. It lacked the flavor I was looking for in a truffle dish, and the pasta was not pulled evenly, as some noodles were very thick and dough-y while others were thin.

It was also kind of heavy on my stomach, I ate 1/3 of my gnocchi and couldn't take it anymore.

We started off with some sparkling water and a variety of appetizers including Frittura di calamari, french fries, caesar salad, Tagliere di Salumi (like a cold cut platter with breadsticks, olives, and pickled vegetables), and Caprese sandwiches cut into bite sized pieces. The appetizers were all pretty good with the caesar salad being surprisingly good due to the high quality cheese and homemade croutons. \n\nA big favorite of the table was the complimentary bread which comes with bits of olive in olive oil. IT'S THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!! The bread has the softest pillowy insides in the world with a perfect crisp on the outside. The bits of olive in combination with the olive oil add so many wonderful flavors with the bread. This was by far the star of the show and the sole reason I would consider coming back.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Spaghetti alla Costiera which is a black ink spaghetti with mussels, clams, shrimp, squid, and cherry tomatoes in a white wine sauce. I found the spaghetti to be perfectly cooked and the seafood to be surprisingly fresh. The clams and mussels came in the shell and the shrimp were nice and plump with one shrimp on top in its shell. I found the white wine sauce to be a bit lacking in flavor however, as I couldn't really distinguish the wine flavor in the sauce. Overall, it was an excellent dish and just the right portion.", "author": "Joshua M."}

The burrata appetizer is simply divine. Creamy fresh-pulled burrata and prosciutto served with a bright salad of arugula and cherry tomatoes. The fried calamari is tender with just the right amount of breading to keep it crispy on the outside. It's also a pretty generous portion. I can hardly walk away from any pasta carbonara and La Briciola does a pretty good version with their penne carbonara. It might be on the heavier side for lunch but the serving size is just right that you get to enjoy all the rich and fatty flavors of pancetta, cheese, eggs, and black pepper without needing to take a little nap after. \n\nRound it out with genuine service that is attentive without being overbearing, the simple charm of La Briciola is a welcome spot in tech-centric South Park/SoMa.", "author": "Jon L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-01", "description": "What better way to start off 2016 than to write about an Italian restaurant in San Francisco! Well, If you're in search for a romantic feel, quality Italian food, and top-notch service at very reasonable prices, \"La Briciola\" just might be the place for you. Located in the heart of the SOMA (South of Market) neighborhood, \"La Briciola\" focuses on Tuscan and Piedmontese cuisine, while serving a unique variety of their home-styled pasta dishes.\n\nI came here with my fianc\u00e9e on a cool Saturday December evening around 8:00pm. Surprisingly, parking was extremely easy to find as there was plenty of parking on nearby Stillman St. (which is almost directly under the I-80 freeway). Since we did not make reservations, I was worried if we had to wait to be seated. Luckily we were seated immediately even though it was close to a full house.\n\nThe inside is as rustic and Italian as possible which truly makes you feel as if you're actually dining in Northern Italy. The lighting was fairly dim but that's what gave the restaurant a truly ambient feel. The archways provided an upscale experience while white tablecloths graced throughout. And the waiter we had a very heavy Italian accent which gave this place even more authenticity.\n\nAs we both had an idea what we wanted to order, our waiter poured our bottle of Red Merlot that we brought from home. Do keep in mind that there is a $25.00 corkage fee. Once narrowing down our selections, I finally decided on their \"Lasagna di Mare\" (for $19.00). This was essentially a seafood lasagna that included a variety of crustacean specimens that included shrimp, salmon, and swordfish topped with B\u00e9chamel sauce. My fianc\u00e9e goes the more traditional route by ordering their \"Lasagna di Carne\" which had the well-known meat ingredients. There was also a nice offering of warm bread complete with Balsamic Vinaigrette that tasted very good.\n\nWe were both pleasantly surprised that both of our lasagna entrees came out in less than 15 minutes. However, I do find that to be a little too much on the speedy side. Which worries me if they nuked it or baked it in a high-temperature oven. I did notice that the presentation wasn't the nicest looking dish; think of it as a glob of biscuits and gravy in terms of looks. But the taste was above average. The seafood didn't overpower each bite as it had the perfect amount of sauce without being under or overcooked. I also sampled a few bites of my fianc\u00e9es entree as hers tasted very delicious.\n\nOverall, I would have to say that \"La Briciola\" is a place that I would recommend. It may not compare to some of the more well-known Italian eateries in San Francisco but with the quaint and smaller size, it is a great place for someone looking for quality food at a decent price. Additionally, the have a generous lunch menu that offers the same offerings at reduced prices.", "author": "Donovan H."}

They have dim lighting and candles on each table (nice for a first date or an intimate dinner). \n\nThe servers were polite and welcoming.\n\nFor me, the food was just lacking and that's the main reason to go out to eat. \n\nI tried the polpo con fagiolini e orzo appetizer. Don't order this. There was nothing about it I really enjoyed, but I honestly hate wasting food so I tried to eat most of it. The warm octopus didn't have a good texture; I felt like it would've tasted a lot better if it was grilled. It came with carrots, a bunch of onions, and a lemon dressing. Didn't like the combination of flavors at all- pass.\n\nNext was the tagliolini di mare. This was a seafood pasta with a nice amount of mixed seafood in it. The pasta was cooked well and the seafood was good, but the sauce was definitely lacking flavor. Pasta is all about the sauce for me, so I wouldn't order this again.\n\nMy boyfriend got the gnocchi sorrentina (pomodoro sauce with mozzarella and basil).

Once we decided on Italian, my friend ended up making reservations for La Bricola; looking at the 4-star average review, I was looking forward to an excellent dinner.\n\nWe started off with the crostini misti di polenta, which included small circles of polenta covered individually with either chicken p\u00e2t\u00e9, a porcini mushroom sauce, and a tomato-based sausage sauce.  Out of all of them, I liked the sausage one the best, but I thought that the polenta was soggy and bland.  The p\u00e2t\u00e9 was meh and the porcini mushrooms did not impress.\n\nI had asked for recommendations for my entr\u00e9e, and our server strongly recommended the tagliatelle with mushroom and black truffles.  If you are looking for a soupy pasta dish that was under-seasoned with overly soft noodles, this dish will meet your requirements in spades.  The chocolate cake dessert was fine but not particularly memorable.

We were seated immediately as the restaurant was nearly empty.  We perused the wine menu and couldn't decide between two options.  We asked to taste both options and were graciously given a taste of each.  \n\nAfter we ordered our wine, a waiter brought out a bread basket.  The bread, served warm, was delicious!  They serve it w tapenade that is very tasty, but I prefer it to have a closer oil to olive ratio - this was on the oily side.\n\nMy friend ordered the crespelle (essentially cannelloni), and I ordered the squid ink seafood spaghetti.  My pasta was very flavorful, a perfect portion (generous but not overwhelming), and had a decent amount of seafood in it.  I would have liked it to have a bit more squid perhaps.  \n\nThe biggest drawback to the place is the slightly undesirable location.  I happened to be in the neighborhood as it is between my friend's office and my office.  I wouldn't, however, have a desire to spend time in that part of SF otherwise.  It's on the border of nicer areas of SOMA, but not quite in the nicer parts as it is very close to the freeway underpass.  \n\nI suspect this location contributed to the empty house on Friday evening, and thus a slightly less than lively atmosphere.

Searching through yelp, we both stopped and stared at each other stumbling upon this traditional looking Italian restaurant amazed at the design and incredible food posts. Made a reservation through yelp for open table, turned on our car and sped to our candle light dinner date. \n\nWe missed it because it was tucked on the bottom of a building near the freeway. But we just parked a block down and walked back. METER PARKING YAY....\nAt 5:30pm, it was completely empty and we were the first ones. It felt like to took a portal from SF straight to Italy (although i've never actually gone to italy before, I bought the whole shazaaam). After being seated our friendly waiter left us with a menu and recommendations. \n\nStraccietti al rag\u00fa di agnello $18: 3 stars. hand cut pasta with lamb rag\u00fa. The rag\u00fa needed a little more flavors to it because it was plain, but i just added more salt and pepper presented at our table. Wished the entire plate had more flavors actually...But the pasta you can taste the difference between hand cut and store bought. For the price I got a pretty small portion, but it was expected. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-briciola-san-francisco?select=2pUUIp85s6LgPxs58AgEIg#j6l6Jww92W_cs0ZgBNlZAQ\n\nMy roommate got the Crostini misti di polenta chicken  consisting of p\u00e2t\u00e9,porcini mushrooms, sausage, polenta.

La Briciola has a cozy little nook they can turn into a private dining area for you and your crew. But the abundance of hard surfaces in this rustic room had us all yelling at each other throughout the meal. And when you're dining together in a 'getting-to-know-you' format, it can be kind of a downer to yell \"huh?\" or \"excuse me?\" all the time. We were only 20 people speaking in inside voices, but if was LOUD. Just a few thick curtains would help soak up the sound. \n\nThe food was very nice, with some unusual appetizers like grilled squid with chickpea puree and eggplant bruscetta, served family style. For my main dish, I had the baked halibut with fresh tomato sauce and ribbon-thin potato slices. It came in a casserole dish, hot out the oven, and the fish was buttery-tender. I tried a bite of the tempting seabass filled ravioli with lobster reduction, but it was somewhat bland - mostly pasta and very little filling. Could be my greedy American appetite, but I'm glad I went with the fish. \n\nService was attentive & charming, wine glasses and water always filled, and each course came out perfectly timed. The atmosphere does feel quite Italian, and the menu has lots of promising dishes with an entirely separate menu for \"from the sea\" dishes. Vegequarians take note!", "author": "Nique F."}

I sat with my parents and husband at one end of the table, and Jon had friends and family around him at the other end. Less than a week had gone by since an accident had claimed the life of his wife, my sister, so the mood was quiet and tearful, instead of the happy and fun birthday dinner she had planned for him just days before.\n\nA few appetizers were ordered but I only remember eating lots of crispy, fried calamari. A plate of it landed in front of me and I enjoyed tons of lightly breaded, flavorful, crunchy pieces. I also went a little crazy with the bread and olive oil on the table. Pretty sure I ate more than my fair share of all the community dishes.\n\nFor dinner my husband had lamb, served in a plateful of gravy - he ate every bite and said it was delicious.  I had a seafood pasta with squid ink, which dyed the noodles black. Seemed to appropriately fit my mood - and also looked pretty cool. It was delicious too. Lots of seafood and a great sauce. I hardly remember eating, or what anyone talked about, but I also cleaned my plate. \n\nService was great - friendly without being more enthusiastic than we could handle.

I enjoyed it very much - and went back 2 weeks later with similar impressions.\n\nThis nice Italian dining experinece is in a strange location.  The surrounding area is not very conducive to a nice dining establishment.  So I am not sure how they survive here - but survive they do.  \n\nThe food was very good - the pasta was fresh and appeared to be home made.  The wine list contained a nice variety - though focused on Italian wines, as it should be - with reasonable prices.\n\nService was \"European\" - it wasn't rushed and it wasn't inattentive.  I thought it was just about right.  Many other review here complain about slow service.   After dining here twice with similar service, I have to wonder  if they were expecting fast food service and were not happy that their made-to-order linguini was not brought out in 10 minutes.\n\nPersonally, I was enjoying the company I was with, so a little break between the anti-pasta and the entree was perfect.  BTW, the first time I dined there, a group of 10 somewhat demanding young SF professionals sat at a nearby table.  Even though the small staff had to deal with them, our service was only mildly impacted.\n\nEvery dish we had here was made quite well.  the cost was reasonable for San Francisco.

A great sign.\n\nThe waiter recommended me a fantastic wine via my stated preferences; big and bold red for my eventual lamb chop feast, but Italian please. It was so fantastic I went online the next day to buy a few bottles for my cellar. \n\nWill I be reviewing my caesar salad experience? You bet your ass I am. What can you do with a caesar salad? I hope you don't do much, because that is why it was perfect. Each fresh and crisp romaine lettuce leaf had the perfect amount of delicious dressing... on every piece in the entire plate. \n\nRisotto... Everything you want a risotto to be. Semi-firm rice morsels with a comforting proportion of cheese folded in carefully. I would change nothing.\n\nBaked Halibut... A luxurious yet simple tomato broth bath engulfs two healthy cuts of halibut surrounded by scalloped potatoes. I drank the broth off of the dish. It was unbelievably flavorful. The fish was perfectly moist and the bath it was relaxing in did not overpower its freshness.\n\nLamb Chops... Like the first thing I wrote in this review, simple done extremely well.

The solid 4-star rating lead us to believe we were going to get, at minimum, a decent meal.  There must be a huge disconnect between lunch and dinner service, because our experience was just straight up poor on all aspects.  \n\nService: Our waiter took at least 10 minutes to show up, did not welcome us or introduce himself.  No drink orders were taken.  No explanation was given about the menu, or the specials sheet which was inserted in the menu.  Food took way too long to come out.  We asked about 20 minutes after ordering and were told \"only two more minutes\".  It was 18 more minutes by my watch before the food came out.  If the food is only half done (or not even started?) let us know, don't tell us \"two minutes\".  Additionally, the place was not very busy, and we saw three separate tables of two get seated, and get their entrees before us.  One table even had desert and left before we got our food.\n\nFood: I ordered one of the specials which was pork loin with prosciutto, served with broccoli rabe and mashed potatoes.  The dish that came out did not match expectations.  There were three medallions of pork loin with prosciutto on top.  The slices of pork were cut and pounded so thin that they were leathery and you could not tell what kind of meat it was.  The side veggies were a broccoli carrot medley that I would guess had been frozen (NOT broccoli rabe), and roasted potatoes.  I'm usually fine with substitutions from what the menu says, but it would have been nice to be warned ahead of time.  \n\nI couldn't help but laugh when I saw the lasagna that some of my group ordered.  Normally I picture lasagna as something that you cut a slice of, and it at least somewhat holds the shape that it was cut in to.  What showed up at our table was gloopy plate looking more like a bowl of soup than lasagna.\n\nWhen we asked for a check at the end, we let the waiter know that we were displeased with both the food quality and the slowness.  He told us that it was because of the lasagna which takes 25 minutes.  Again, better communication at the time of ordering would have been great.  Also that's a deferral, not an apology.

We did not receive our food until 1:10. We all noticed customers who arrived after us receive their food, eat, wipe their mouths, pay, and leave all before we got our food.\n\nWhen we asked our waiter about our food, he said the food would come out in \"two minutes.\" He must have been using the \"two minutes\" from the end of an NBA playoff game because it was another 15 minutes before the food came out. \n\nThen the food came out. The lasagna looked not Nonna's but some pile of mush. It also had carrots, which I found odd since it was lasagna. Others had the pork loin special with broccoli rabe. This was three pieces of pork and some frozen broccoli for the low low price of $23. Not value priced. \n\nAt the end of the meal, the waiter asked how it was and we told him the truth. When we noted the time, he mentioned how the lasagna \"takes 25 minutes\"; however, it was neither noted on the menu nor did he tell us upon ordering.

The grilled calamari shined a bit more than the fried because I could actually taste the freshness of the squid.\n\nIn terms of main courses, we ordered the lasagna, porcini with black  truffle oil pasta, ravioli, linguine with clams, and the spinach salad.   Mostly everyone I talked to really enjoyed their food.  The servers were also very much on top of their game.  They came to do water refills frequently and brought out new silverware after our appetizer plates were taken away.\n\nOn average it was about $35 per person for a genuinely enjoyable meal within a spacious not too loud dining room environment.  This place certainly is more than qualifies as a date-worthy destination and for larger groups too and for anyone who likes to have choices of both Italian meat courses and seafood courses.", "author": "Ben H L."}

There was nothing distinguishing about it. The lamb ragu pasta has freshly made pasta. The sauce was OK, but the pasta was gummy and overcooked.

We expected traffic driving into the city for a 6:15 reservation, but the roadways were so clear.  Great, except we arrived about 40 minutes early.  We even found street parking about 1/2 block away.  What to do with all that time???  Strolled into Zeke's sports bar.  Eclectic and interesting group there enjoying very cheap, and kinda watery, drinks, but who's complaining when you get a well gin and tonic and a Tanquaray maritini for total $10.\n\nWalked into La B right on time, and it was completely empty.  during the entire 90 minutes were there only two other tables were occupied.  Even on a Tuesday night, no place can survive with that small a turnout.  Wondering if that's why they cut back on some of the more expensive ingredients (details to follow).\n\nI had a Caesar.  It was large with lots or fresh lettuce, but totally overdressed with a dressing lacking in garlic and, WHAT, no anchovies.  My husband had the spinach salad and enjoyed it, although said it was underdressed.  We shared Calamari grigliati-grilled squid~arugula~chickpea pur\u00e9e starter, and it was hands down the star of the night.  We got eight baby squid, bodies only, that were perfectly fresh, perfectly grilled, just olive oil, salt and pepper.  I could have eaten a plate full of them.  The chickpea puree, unfortunately had no flavor at all - not even chickpea flavor.\n\nI'm not much of a pasta gal, but I'm TOTALLY a mushroom/fungi gal.  I decided to order against type and get the Tagliatelleai porcini e tartufo- wild porcini~black truffles~white truffle oil.  I was sooo disappointed.  There were no black truffles!  Should I have said something?  I also couldn't detect the truffle oil, and the porcini were not very assertive.  The sauce tasted of raw flour, which I think they used to thicken it instead of reducing it to intensify the flavors.  The pasta texture was perfect, just the right amount of chew, but the dish was woefully underseasoned.  I think if they'd reduced the sauce properly, there wouldn't have seemed such a lack of salt.  My husband got the Vitello alla valdostana- rolled veal~spek~fontina cheese~white wine.  He enjoyed it, although it was slightly oversalted.  The texture of the veal was perfect, maybe a touch too much of the cheese.\n\nI don't usually get dessert, but felt cheated because my entr\u00e9e was so insipid, so ordered the Panna cotta- vanilla cream pudding~cherry coulis.  The panna cotta was about average, but the cherries (I think they were the prized amarena) were exquisite.  Too bad there only three.\n\nOur waiter was sweet and very cute in an androgynous way.  He was a little awkward, kind of there when we didn't need him and not when we did, but I could tell he was trying, and I give points for that.\n\nOn the way home, we decided if we'd combined the two entrees and then split them, we both would have enjoyed them more.  Once again I find myself thinking, if I'd had lower expectations, I would have had a higher rating.\n\nFood:  19/40\nservice: 15/20\nambiance/intangibles:  17/20\nvalue:  16/20\nOverall:67/100\neven though this would be 2 stars, my overall feeling was definitely in the 3 star range, so I'll overrule my formula and say 3 stars, although it would not be above the middle of my revisit list.", "author": "Diane B."}

Made the train home at 7:30.\n\nFirst, there are the people. The service was very good, chatty, and casual. The menu is divided into a daily menu, and then a more general regular menu. All in all, there are enough choices to keep you reading for several minutes.\n\nSecond, there are my choices. Wine: 2010 Sangiovese La Carraia, Umbria, Italia: raspberry, cherry, and pepper, with balanced acidity, medium body, and moderate tannins...smooth, mild, and well-flavored.\n\n1. Orecchiette con salsiccia e rapini ear-shaped pasta~sausage~\nbroccolirabe~olive oil. The pasta was al dente, the \"hot\" sausage was mild, the vegetables semi-crisp (2/3 cooked), and the sauce left plenty of room to taste all of the ingredients.

La Briciola had reservations available and Italian cuisine always seems like a good choice.  \n\nService was very attentive, and you gotta love the Italian accent!  I like how they have some lunch specials in addition to their regular menu.  It was a tough choice but I went with the truffle paperdelle.  My dining companions went with the seafood risotto and the spinach salad with penne bolognese.  Loved the bread and olive oil.  The spinach salad was pretty basic with some simple dressing, some nuts and cheese but was fine.  My truffle pappardelle smelled great and had tons of porcini mushrooms.  The pappardelle was freshly made and delicious carby goodness and listed black truffles and white truffle oil.  However, I didn't see any black truffle shavings, perhaps it was a mix of black and white truffle oil.  Though it smelled truffley, I didn't really taste much.  So that was a bummer.  I had a taste of the penne bolognese and I must say that was delicious.  I heard the risotto was pleasing as well.  \n\nLa Briciola is a cute place with great service and hearty portions.

At 5:30pm, right when they opened, we walked in and were promptly seated. The guy was clearly Italian from his accent and he was so sweet and welcoming. Here's the rundown:\n\nFood:\nTo start, they brought out some fresh bread (room temp) and olive oil mixed in with crushed olives. Normally, I'm skeptical of these types of oil mixtures, but this one was really tasty. The olives were so good, I piled them on my piece of bread before devouring it.\nMy mom and sister started with the Minestrone dell'ortolano soup and seemed pleased with it. My dad got the Zuppa Contadina soup and let me try some; it was pretty good.\nFor entrees, my mom got the Ravioli di cernia (seabass ravioli), which I tried a bit of and it was GOOD. Definitely better than the Straccietti al rag\u00fa di agnello (lamb ragu) I ordered. My sister got the Pennette al granchio con la rucola, which was also pretty good. My dad got the Linguine alle vongole, and was quite happy with it start to finish.\nFor dessert, my mom ordered the Panna cotta and my sister ordered the Souffl\u00e9 al cioccolato. I tried some of each. The Panna cotta was creamy, without being overly sweet, and was covered with a cherry sauce that was delightful. The souffl\u00e9 was quite chocolatey and could even give the chocolate lover a chocolate food coma.\n\nService: The host, servers, and busboys were impeccable. They were all very personable, friendly, and well-timed. We enjoyed our meal for a little under 2 leisurely hours and were quite pleased.\n\nAmbiance: This is a cute restaurant along the same block as Garaje and HRD.

Jamie W. and I were caught in the midst of the hoopla and found ourselves in the relative quietude of La Briciola. Fans were relentless in their enthusiasm and kept banging on the front window behind me as we were eating. I felt like Tippi Hedren when she was cowering on the sofa in that Bodega Bay house in \"The Birds\" as the seagulls were pecking their way through the front door. But I'm no bottle blonde, and that kind of frenzy only happens once every 56 years. \n\nAh, I remember the big plastic tomato in front of its former identity, Vino e Cucina. It was hard to miss when you were driving by. Back then, it was just a casual Italian eatery that somehow slipped my mind. In fact, I wasn't aware that it turned into an upscale northern Italian ristorante until quite recently. It's nicer inside, rather modest in culinary execution but nice just the same. We first shared the $14 Fagottino Ripieni, which were two crepes turned into little pouches holding some mixed vegetables in a creamy pool of wild porcini sauce and drizzled with a white truffle oil (see photo). The dish was charming and delicious. \n\nEntrees were solid as well. Jamie ordered the healthy-looking $17 Orecchiatte con Salsiccia e Rapini, which was a plate of ear-shaped pasta mixed with a mild sausage and broccoli rabe (see photo). Fresh-tasting but lacking a certain oomph to make it truly memorable. I had better luck with the $17 Straccietti al Rag\u00fa di Agnello, a hearty, rustic dish made up of hand-cut pasta mixed in a homemade lamb ragu sauce (see photo). This was really classic Italian fare, and the pasta was prepared with an ideal al dente texture. Service was attentive and not at all wearing on our frazzled nerves.

Warning: For those who DO have crustacean allergies, do not order the risotto-- it comes with a lobster reduction sauce that was not otherwise specified on the menu. (I wouldn't have an issue with this normally, and I generally ask ahead of time anyway-- but it was listed on another item on the menu, so i'm curious as to why they didn't list LOBSTER REDUCTION under their risotto? Some people who are allergic to crusteans generally like eating seafood and would probably want to eat the risotto anyway?) I wish they would have listed it, as they did on other menu items-- but I wanted to write this up so that they know that they could be liable for a lawsuit (so post it on the menu or tell your guests ahead of time!!!!) The only reason I found out about the lobster in the risotto was that I tasted a bit and then asked the wait staff to please inform me, and when it was confirmed-- prompty exchanged dishes with my boyfriend. \n\nOther than that, La Briciola was average. The wait staff took forever and got my order wrong (I ordered the seafood risotto and got the sausage risotto-- but  knowing what I knew about the risotto, I would have preferred the sausage.) While they were prompt and apologetic about it, it left a bad taste in my mouth.The bread was fantastic, as well as the olive oil and olive spread that comes with it, but not enough to forget about the allergy fiasco and the long LONG wait time to order (it took around 30 minutes for the wait staff to come back around after we weren't ready the first time.) My boyfriend thought his pasta (the tagliatelleai porcini e tartufo) was not flavoured well enough-- and also that the mushrooms used in the dish were either way overcooked or just canned (they were mushy.) And the risotto was too salty and did not come with enough chunks of seafood with it. \n\nIdk. I'm sort of disappointed in La Briciola-- the menu looked so delicious and inviting! Ingredients sounded fresh and amazing. What should have been a foodie's delight (especially with all the amazing ingredients listed) ended up being a disappointment and almost-disaster (imagine if I ate the entire risotto WITH the sauce?

We had to ask multiple times for water, bread, and an extra chair. The food came out about 75 minutes after we ordered. The quality was lacking, reminiscent of lean cuisine. \n\nBut here's my biggest gripe... (passive-aggressive nature coming out). I had brought a bottle of bourbon to enjoy with my friends.

No \"please\" or \"do you mind\"... just \"that bottle needs to be off the table\". My blood was BOILING!!!! I had to gather every ounce of restraint not to slap the guy and choke him out. I haven't had such a rude and horrible experience at a restaurant in quite some time. \n\nI encourage the general public to eat elsewhere.

Squid ink spaghetti was plain tasting, per the two that ordered it, so they would not ordered it again.  My T-Bone steak was not medium rare and so over-charred that is all I tasted during my meal.  The grilled calamari was good, although it too was heavily charred, which made the steak worse.  The only food my party said they truly enjoyed was the fresh warm bread, but that is because of the olive tapenade that accompanied it.\n\nDecorum was nice but service took too long and I had to ask multiple times for the same thing like the wine menu then the dessert menu.  Once they took away the menus, they didn't seem interested in offering another bottle of wine to our table.\n\nI do not have a desire to return here due to paying $60 for a unsatisfying meal.", "author": "Kirstin K."}

The gnocchi was pretty solid, but the tagliolini di mare was the star of the show.   Perfect for the light rain outside.

I'm only a dessert guy when the moon is properly aligned, but my date appreciated the classic tiramisu just the same. \n\nAll in all, an out of the way, last minute reservation ended up being the second best idea of the night... but I wouldn't find that out until later. \n\nIf I have time and intent the next time I'm in SF (and in SoMa) , I just might make the hike for lunch.", "author": "Mike S."}

This was not the case. The waiter's demeanor was a bit sour and though he wasn't rude, he also wasn't friendly. It took about 15 minutes for the waiter to take our order, when there was no one else in the restaurant. The bus boy did bring us fresh hot bread with oil and kalmata olives in the meantime, which helped with the waiting. The food came quickly once we ordered but it wasn't worth the prices. I'm glad we stuck with the Lunch Menu instead of the higher priced Main Menu. The Bruschette Assortite Zucchini and the bread were the highlights of the meal. I ordered the Scaloppina Di Limone, the veal was over cooked but the lemon caper sauce was tasty. The veggies, broccoli & spinach were overly steamed and bland. The bus boy and another gentleman served us our food and the waiter never came to check on us until after we finished eating, about 15 minutes after we were done. He never asked us if we wanted to see the dessert menu but simply brought  us the check. I didn't make a fuss since we had to get back to the office and we passed up the hour mark from when we sat down in the restaurant.

This night was no different. I got the rabbit confit. It was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor. The portion was pretty large for a secondi. The confit was served on a bed of cooked root veggies which were also very delicious. \n\nMy friend brought her own customized birthday cake and the whole staff came out to sing happy birthday to my her. They also helped us cut the cake and didn't even charge extra for that. We had a lot of cake left over and gave some to the staff. They were super excited and thanked us profusely.

We were looking forward to trying a new neighborhood restaurant - particularly because we love Italy and Italian food. The bread / tapenade, service and portions were all as advertised (by other reviewers). However, the quality of the food was sadly lacking. The spinach salad had large, hard chunks of candied nuts that were almost impossible to cut through, and too little goat cheese for that mound of spinach leaves, but that was the best thing we had. The vegetable crepes were smothered in a very rich sauce, and were filled with what seemed like, more of the same - nothing that could be identified clearly as a vegetable.  I think most of the seafood in the caciucco had seen better days ...I actually spit out a bite of fish that was very clearly bad. The broth though, was tasty.

Here's the scoop that raises the bar for me to 4 stars; the flavors aren't so concentrated that the textures of the main ingredient are overwhelmed.  This shines through in their gnocchi, which could be described better as cuscini di nuvole (if translate has it right).  The sauce is light, not too 'tomatoey,' just a spectacular dish.

While the place had a romantic atmosphere (dimmed lights, candles on table), I wouldn't bring a date here just cause of where the place is located. The streets are pretty ghetto around here. Also in terms of atmosphere, if you're unlucky enough - as I was - large parties can prove to be quite obnoxious with their volume due to how small the place is.\n\nOn to the food: My friend and I ordered the carpaccio with arugula and parmesan cheese, and the fried calamari for appetizers. The carpaccio was pretty standard. Nothing that I haven't had before at other locations. The calamari was very lightly breaded (almost to the extent of no breading). I personally like my calamari with more breading so I was a bit disappointed. The calamari comes with their homemade marinara sauce, but it was a bit on the watery side. Salt and pepper -- simple stuff, would have made the calamari better as it lacked any flavor. \n\nFor my main, I ordered a sea food stew which comprised of lobster, muscle, clams, shrimp, and broth. I was disappointed yet again. For the most part, everything in the dish was overcooked, the shrimp especially, and it was a bit on the salty side. Though bread is at the table when you start your meal, I wish our waiter would've brought more bread for my stew.\n\nFor dessert, I shared a tiramisu and this was definitely the saving part of the meal. BOMB. I'm a fan of rum in desserts and the tiramisu here had a whole lot of it. I approve. \n\nOur bill came out to $100 with tax and tip. I've had better meals for this price.

Italian food in SF is just never gonna compete with that.\n\nLa Briciola is a decent spot - reasonably tasty food and prices that aren't insane.  I was put off by the rudeness of the staff and a few of my dinner companions commented on it.  I'm not sure what put the bee in their bonnet but they weren't much fun.", "author": "Ivan L."}

Don't let the sketchy neighborhood fool you. Inside it's charming, the food is excellent and the service is great too!\n\nI had a delicious spinacini salad to start (spinach, goat cheese, walnuts) and then followed it with orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe. I also managed (ha) to drink a couple glasses of a delicious and reasonably priced Barolo.\n\nI saved enough room for dessert and enjoyed their version of a molten chocolate cake. Not quite flourless, but a good facsimile and IMHO better than most desserts at Italian places.\n\nOh, and did I mention the service? Great. Never bothersome, but I also never waited when I needed something. \n\nI'd definitely go back another time and bring a group, seems like a great place to have a big group-style meal - somewhere just between casual and fancy.", "author": "Joshua B."}

It was a little empty when I came because it was getting close to 9PM.  The waiter was quick to take our order, but kind of slow at the end of our meal to grab our CC for the bill.\n\nFor $19, I got a shallow bowl of pasta with mussels, clams~calamari, and shrimp mixed in a light, semi-watery sauce.  The dish itself was decent, except for a couple of things.  One one shrimp that had its shell intact was not fresh at all.  The meat was falling apart and was soft.  One of the mussels was actually a bad mussel because the moment I put it in my mouth, a stench escaped the shriveled, brown-orange mussel and hit me bad.  Not cool.\n\nStill, I have to rate La Briciola at least 3 stars because I think the workers here are nice and their overall service wasn't that bad.  I think sometimes you just get a bad mussel and shrimp mixed in with some of the good stuff (there were a lot of good, fat, bouncy shrimps in the mix).  Also, they offer you a lot of bread to go with their delicious bread dip.", "author": "May W."}

It is rare to find a restaurant where every dish exceeds expectations.The food was excellent: perfectly cooked/extremely tender chicken breasts with porcini mushrooms. I intended to eat only half of the chicken, but this was not possible because it was just delicious! My other two family members had wonderful pastas, also cooked perfectly with flavorful sauces. The Creme Carmel and Tirimisu were both wonderful, not too sweet; salads were tasty and fresh. \n\nWe were fortunate to come on a night when the 2 owners were there, what delightful men! Our chats with one owner made the entire experience fantastic. We will not only recommend La Briciola to friends, we will drive over an hour to come here again, hopefully many more times!\n\nThis intimate gem cannot be missed if you want to try a restaurant which brings you back to Italy, even for a few hours.", "author": "M.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-10-27", "description": "After some last minute dinner planning, we ended up here based on JL's suggestion.  Probably would never have noticed it otherwise.  \n\nAMBIANCE: Moderate lightly, borderline dim.  We arrived a little late to our 6PM reservation... but realized that reservations were definitely not necessary-- the entire place was empty!  JL was initially worried b/c he had noticed all the opentable rezzies being snapped up, but clearly La Briciola has plenty of tables saved up for phone/walk-ins.  As our meal progressed the restaurant slowly filled up, but it was at most maybe at 50-60% capacity. \n\nSERVICE: Very friendly and \"Italian.\"  I wasn't entirely sure how authentically Italian, but either way they were courteous and very patient with us (we took our slow sweet time).\n\nFOOD: We ordered two apps to share and each had a pasta entree.\n- Tagliere di Salumi ($14): Yummy assorted meat plate.  We shared a small between 4 people and it was more than plenty.  I particularly liked the thickly sliced salame.  JL was a fan of the peppers.\n- Polpo con fagiolini e orzo ($14): I was hoping for tender octopus, so I was pretty disappointed in this dish.  The octopus meat was tough, chewy, and barely warm (English description states \"warm octopus\").  The shaved fennel was yummy though. \n\n- Orecchiette con salsiccia e rapini ($18): J's dish was unfortunately extremely bland.  I liked how the pasta was cooked though-- perfectly al dente.  The broccoli rabe added a nice bite of slight bitterness, but I felt like it should've been paired with a richer sauce... instead of nonexistent sauce... The sausage was only ok flavor-wise.\n- Ravioli di cernia ($19): Definitely the better pasta dish of the two IMHO.  Robust flavors, but pasta was overcooked, which didn't help the already mushy texture of the seabass filling.  I really liked the drizzle of basil oil along the edge of the plate, which added a bright fresh flavor to the somewhat fishy tasting dish.\n\nI also sampled the Straccietti al rag\u00fa di agnello ($18), which was too gamey for my tastes, but is probably popular amongst most diners.  The lasagne JM ordered came as a HUGE rectangular portion, over which they shaved a very generous amount of cheese.  He scraped up every last bite, so I assume he enjoyed it.\n\nOVERALL: Decent neighborhood option, though not a restaurant I would trek all the way from the southbay for.  The pasta seems to be made in house, as it was very fresh, and I would recommend one that is listed as having a sauce or reduction, as the one we tried with only olive oil listed was quite flavorless.", "author": "Susanna W."}

Honestly, the outside of the restaurant is kinda ghetto because it is located in the old building.  But it is different when you walk into the restaurant.  The decor of the restaurant is not amazing but can able to give you a cozy and relaxing feeling.  \n\nEveryone was so friendly, polite and welcome.  Upon sitting, the server delivered the basket of bread (a lot) with a side of olive oil.  The bread was so good; warm, crusty and soft at the same time.  \n\nWe have ordered:\n\nBruschette assortite ($9.00) - zucchini, eggplant and fresh tomatoes were on the toasted bread.  It was so good.  All ingredients were fresh and tasty.\n\nPepata di cozze e vongole ($14.00) - steamed mussels and clams.  The portion was pretty big.  Good to share with your date or friend.  The sauce was flavorful but not too heavy.\n\nGnocchi Sorrentina ($17.00) - potato dumplings, fresh mozzarella and basil with tomato sauce.  OMG it was so good.  The Gnocchi was so light, soft and melted in your mouth.  The sauce was flavorful.    \n\nToo bad that we were so full and had no room for dessert......\n\nOverall, I had a wonderful dinning experience.  Everything was awesome.

Saw that it was well rated on yelp, decided to give it a try. We were not mislead!  \n\nFor the Antipasti, we ordered the stewed clams and mussels and the grilled calamari. Both were out of this world. The clams/mussels were very flavorful due to the savory broth that it came in. The calamari were grilled to perfection, tasted very fresh. \n\nFor the Primi, I had the Seafood Risotto, chock full of large prawns and clams and calamari pieces. The most amazing thing that made me feel like I hit the authenticity jackpot was the fact that there were 2 huge prawns with THE HEAD STILL ON!! That tells me that the chef must know that the shrimp heads impart the most flavor if left on. And it was true. The Risotto tasted like it should: Seafoody, not fishy; rich, and very filling due to the generous amount of seafood in it. My honey had the Lamb Ragu with Penne, and he thought it was deliciously al dente, with the ragu not overpowering the pasta, just light and flavorful, but filling as well. \n\nThe service was wonderful and warm, with the staff speaking to you in Italian, being very attentive to the fact that we were water guzzlers. Our glasses were never empty. Didn't have room for dessert this time. Maybe next time! We will be back.", "author": "Mei W."}

Grilled squid with chickpea puree was very tasty although the puree could be served without it.  squid was charred in some places but i guess that's a given.  puff pastry seafood was great, had bits of crab and shrimp.  It tasted like a clam chowder in a puff pastry. clam linguine was not as flavorful as I thought.  it was heavy on the wine side, can't really taste the clam broth (if it even had any).  Some clams had sand in it, but i guess it's not their fault.  beef lasagna (special of the day) was very simple but decadent.

Let me say it again in case you misunderstood... FREAKING SHADY!!! Can I give them negative stars?\n\nCame as a group of 14 for a birthday dinner. Had no issues bringing us wine but took numerous requests before we got water and bread, think our appetizers came before the gave us water or bread. They then proceeded to screw up on our orders. We had to remind them to bring out dessert for the birthday boy, even though they reassured us before he got there that they'll make it happen. GRR!!!\n\nThe bill with gratuity came out to a little $632. We split the bill 13 ways came out to $50 a person. Two couples paid with credit cards, and the rest in cash, totaling $650. The waiter ran the cards, and came back with partial cash claiming that we're short $22. We counted the cash; there was only $310. He explained that he took out the \"gratuity\" amount  from the cash. WHAT?!?\n\nFirst of all, we triple counted the cash so we know we weren't short. Secondly, it was an even number as we round up to tip them extra, how is it that all of a sudden we now have a odd number? (310 + 116= 426) Thirdly, why take out  amount returning a partial amount of the cash and claiming we were short? Either way, the numbers just didn't add up. \n\nPer the birthday boys request, we let it go as it was not a huge amount. But it really isn't about the money, more of the principle of it. As patrons of a fine dining establishment, we truly didn't expect unscrupulous behavior from the waitstaff. They may have gotten lucky that we let it go and chose not to take it up with management but they can be sure that there would be no returns from any of us.

The first time we had stumbled in out of the rain and found ourselves in a quiet bit of Tuscany (as reimagined for SOMA). Several of the staff speak Italian and the food is a tasty blend of very traditional Italian with some local artisanal offerings and local seafood. \n\nThe hearty sourdough bread and aromatic olive oil with a touch of olive tapenade was awesome. My partner had the vegetable-stuffed crepes, which we'd also had the time before. They are good, but the cream sauce makes them very filling; they'd be much better to share than to have for one person as an appetizer. Or perhaps the crepes and a salad as the whole meal. I started with the warm seafood salad: sauteed or braised calamari, peeled prawns, and mussels, in a light seafood broth with a bit of garlic. The best part (well, the most interesting part) was thinly shave fennel in the seafood salad that seemed to have been braised in the shellfish broth, such that it took on the seafood flavors while retaining a faintly crisp sweetness. I sopped up every bit of the broth with the bread. (I miss real sourdough down in LA, Nancy Silverton's La Brea Bakery notwithstanding.) \n\nFor pasta, I had tagliatelle that tasted homemade (delightfully chewy and tender) with porcini and truffles. My partner had the classic orecchiette wtih rapini and sausage. He felt it was a tad on the salty side, but I thought it was just right. The rapini was perfectly al dente, the sausage both sweet and savory, and the orrechiette balanced out the other two. :Last time we had shared the bruschette misti, a lamb chop special (meltingly tender), and the rabbit. I'd happily have had the rabbit again (or the lamb chops, if they'd been on offer), but we wanted to explore the menu further. \n\nNo room for dessert this time. We will certainly be back.

I didn't even have to wait for a few minutes after my friends had begun eating, and I was soon eating my extremely delicious gnocchi that just melted in my mouth. A good restaurant is not about being apologetic and delaying the order further, but acknowledging and correcting the mistake swiftly as if it never occurred and that is where this place is an example. Have I used the word exemplary already?! :)\n\nMy friend had a taste of Ravioli and the sauce was just perfect and another friend got a mushroom pasta that was heavenly.Overall, everyone of us loved what we ate and how it was served to us. Did I forget to mention the complimentary bruschetta and the bread that was served as appetizers. They were so tasty that we were almost full even before dinner.\n\nA friend ordered some coffee after the dinner and I must say it was as good or even better than the blue mountain coffee that I so enjoy and recommend.\n\nWe will go back here and you must go too!!!!", "author": "Harsha G."}

It was troublesome from the beginning! My co-worker that made the reservations had a hard time with the customer service when she called to place the reservation AND when she called to confirm the reservation. When we got there, we experienced a really subpar waitstaff. We waited almost an hour from the time we ordered to the time we received our main dishes.\n\nAnd when the food came, it really wasn't worth the amount of time it took for us to receive it. I'm pretty sure they forgot our order since we had to ask them a few times. (Though I don't know how you can forget an order for a party of 8!) For main courses, I tried the tagiliatelle with truffle (really flavorful but a tad too salty), the seabass ravioli (too fishy) and the risotto with sausage (definitely a no). \n\nSo our mistake was picking this restaurant that was much too noisy for exchanging conversations across the table. Their mistake was having only two servers during the busy lunch hour. Lose-lose, and I don't think I'll be coming back.", "author": "Shira C."}

My Girl Friend and I had went back and forth and we came to the conclusion that La Briciola would be a wonderful experience. We made our reservation 7:30. Unfortunately, on the night of our reservation we were running super late. I called La Briciola and they were very accommodating in changing our reservation to 8:45.\n\nSo when we arrived to the restaurant, there was plenty of street parking. After walking inside the restaurant, at first thought was that this was a cozy, yet romantic place. We were seated at our table after a 5 min. wait for them to set-up the table. We  were given our menus and we were conflicted because many of dishes seemed very intriguing by their written descriptions. My GF got white wine and started with an Italian beer. My GF got  Ravioli Con Pomodoro (ricotta, spinach ravioli? and I got the Vitello Alla Valdostana (rolled veal, ham, and fontana cheese with b\u00e9chamel sauce).\n\nWhen we got our food, the presentation was very neat and composed. The plates were not too much or too little of portions. I found my dish quite delicious and my GF was very pleased by her meal. We ended our food experience, by splitting the Souffl\u00e9 al Cioccolato which is a chocolate cake. \n\nWe found this place the perfect place for a quaint romantic dinner or chill place to have a glass of wine.

(yes, I was mesmerized by our server's ocean blue eyes on top of his Italian accent) The variety of dishes can make you dizzy with choosing your entree but it's conveniently divided into two sections: food that comes from the land (chicken, vegetarian options, etc) and from the ocean (clams, mussels, etc)  \n\nThe trio of polenta is good for sharing: each topping was unique on its own: the first had chicken pate, the second porcini mushrooms and the last had chopped sausage.  The polenta was soft and not too mealy; my fave was surprisingly, the porcini mushroom. It had a nice chunks of well seasoned mushrooms, it could almost pass as thin slices of meat. \n\nOur warm octopus orzo appetizer had cannellini beans and barley in a lemon-olive oil vinaigrette. It had generous slices of octopus, but not a home run on taste. Especially after we squeezed more lemon on it, the dish ended up being too sour.  \n\nMy linguini with fresh clams in a white wine reduction was done al dente and again, generous portion but this was a bit under seasoned. My friend wasn't jumping for joy for his squid ink risotto, but it did have that creamy consistency and big cuts of calamari. \n\nI was excited seeing profiteroles on the menu but sadly, this was dry. Even with the pool of melted ice cream and chocolate sauce, it was tough to cut. So, if you need dessert, stick with the affogato instead.\n\nThe dishes are on the pricier side of things, especially the selections on the seafood menu.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-17", "description": "Awesome... as good as it gets!\n\nI love some good Italian food, and in SF there are plenty of places.  I think I have reviewed 2 so far, 1 really good (Perbacco) and 1 really horrible (Poesia).  La Briciola knocked my socks off.\n\nI have walked passed this restaurant several times, but it is in the opposite direction from where I live if we are going out into the city, so it seems silly to go here before we go out, because that would be backtracking.  They have Burrata on the menu (which I recently discovered in SF) and knew that it would be a good restaurant.  Other Yelp reviews have been pretty positive as well.\n\nGetting home late one night from work, we were not going out to the city so we decided to go out.  Downstairs from us is Pazzia (another Italian restaurant) and we had decided on there.  As we approached, they were clearly in the weeds, so we abandoned ship, and turned to trusty Open table.  They had room available at La Briciola 6 minutes from now, and that would be the amount of time to walk down 3rd.\n\nAs we walked in, there were a couple of large tables sat, some small parties too, but plenty of seating.  It was not overly crowded and it didn't look like getting our food would be a problem.\n\nUpon sitting we were quickly greeted, and delivered the most amazing crusty and soft at the same time, still warm, Italian bread, served with a side of olive oil that had a kalamata tapenade in the bottom.  Omg delicious.  My husband and I devoured it. They cleared the basket and brought out a second round, which was really nice and un-expected.\n\nWe started with a Caesar salad to split and the Burrata.  We were quickly informed the Burrata was out for the night, so we went with the Salumi platter (am I destined to not have Burrata? see my Poesia review).  The Caesar arrived and they had already split it for us, which was really nice.  Nice crunchy Romaine, a lemony garlicky dressing, nice cheese on top and delicious crunchy croutons, Everything a good Caesar should be.\n\nThe Salumi platter (small) was fantastic.  Every type of cured salty meat I love.  Bresola, Speck, Prosciutto, and Salami. All top notch.  It was served with a small side of marinated veggies and olives.  Also came with delicious thin bread sticks.  We cleaned the plate and the side of veggies and olives was perfect for us, I love olives, and my husband love roasted bell peppers.\n\nFor my entree I went with the Lamb ragu and pasta.  WOW.  I thought the short rib ragu at Perbacco was great, this however was fantastic.  The portion was huge, enough for an entree or if you were doing a typical 4 course Italian dinner, split this. The pasta was so fresh, totally house made, cooked perfect, came out steaming with the most delicate and complex lamb ragu on  top.  The fresh shaved Romano cheese was the perfect topping and my glass of Barbera wine was the perfect compliment.   I ate every bite!\n\nMy husband got the linguini and clams (the entree he was craving on Christmas night that never happened). The portion was more than generous, it was HUGE.  Tons of pasta, a dozen super fresh and well cooked clams, and the best white wine-garlic-butter sauce.  He couldn't finish it all.  If you get this, make sure you have some of the bread left over to mop up some of the sauce.\n\nWe went with dessert, even though we were pretty full.  Every dessert on the menu I would have done, but I wanted something a little lighter, so we went with the Affogato.  Two scoops of the creamiest vanilla gelato, and a side of hot espresso to pour over the top.  Two small Pirouette cookies were served with it.\n\nThe price was spot on, not too expensive, but by no means cheap.  But for 2 entrees, 2 appetizers, a dessert, 3 glasses of wine, a diet coke (fountain by the way, and I assume free refills, but never had to get it) and an espresso, we made it out for pretty reasonable. \n\nOur server was fantastic too.  Not too obtrusive, there where we needed him, and the pace of dinner was perfect.  He also was great with the recommendations for entrees and wine.  I could tell he had passion for the food and wine and was excited with our choices.   \n\nThe atmosphere is perfect, really quaint inside, you could have a nice dinner for two, a romantic night out, a get together with friends or a business meal here.

I normally order lemonade as I don't drink alcohol and their rendition is amazing.  I asked the waiter to make a recommendation with seafood and he suggested the lasagna which was layered with lobster, scallop, and sea bass with an amazing bechamel and great pasta.

Those came promptly. The salad was ample and I would recommend ordering to share as it was a LOT of arugula. It was fresh and tasty. My friend inhaled her salmon and we waited for our server. At this point, granted I still had a mountain of arugula still on my plate, our server was nowhere to be found. No one came by to check in to see how we were doing, and finally I had to flag the busboy down to get my salad to go. \n\nFrom the arrival of our salads, we must have waited an additional 30-45 minutes before we even asked after our pasta. The restaurant wasn't busy and I didn't think it took that long to prepare the lamb ragu since it usually involves ladling the already stewing sauce onto fresh pasta that took 7-9 minutes tops to cook. \n\nThe lamb ragu was as mentioned on this page, delicious and since they knew we were sharing 2 pastas, they split the portions for us, which was sweet. \n\nThe linguine with clams was also delicious with just the right amount of sauce. \n\nAs we were both in a rush we skipped dessert. \n\nThe food is excellent but the service truly could be better.", "author": "Karen K."}

The \"Straccietti al rag\u00fa di agnello\" is hand cut noodles which looks like moebius strips (basically long rectangular shaped noodles), with lamb ragu.  What is lamb ragu?  I'm not sure but it looked grounded up and it was with this brown sauce that covered all of the noodles.  Only one word describes the taste: FANTASTIC.

Have my taste buds changed after four years in the Bay Area? Will my friends recognize the level of effort put into the menu and each dish? Basically, I feel like my move to SF is up for review during these dinners. And with this dinner, I took a big risk. \n\nMy friend is second-generation Italian and almost never eats Italian food outside the home because it rarely meets the expectations of himself and his wife. They're really nice but have very high standards, especially for Italian food. He also lived in SF for several years and brought his family for a vacation.  Their hotel near Moscone was only about 5 blocks away and the prices at La Briciola are reasonable, especially for quality food. \n\nThe main reason I felt good (pretty...pretty...pretty good) about the recommendation was that the executive chef is Italian, and the servers on both of my visits have been Italian. My friend and his wife really enjoyed the restaurant - what a relief! Everyone loved their meals and our waiter allowed us to catch up over a couple hours. \n\nLa Briciola's pace of service could feel too leisurely if your brain isn't reset to European dining time. You won't feel rushed, especially with the bill. Hopefully this info will allow you to enjoy your next visit a bit more. \n\nThe food here is great; the menu is pretty big for a not-very-big place. I ate the minestrone and stewed rabbit, both of which very good. The minestrone even smelled amazing, and my friend wished he'd ordered it. I couldn't believe how good the rabbit tasted. \n\nWe all shared the fried calamari: light breading, and the squid was cooked just right.

We sat down and they gave us bread with an olive oil with chunks of olives on the bottom for sauce. Both were amazing and they kept refilling our bread without us asking whenever we finished a basket! Super good service. \n\n-I got the Tagliatelle ai porcini e tartufo which was pasta with wild porcini, black truffles, and white truffle oil. The noodles were thick and chewy which went along superb with the mushroom sauce. I had never tasted a sauce like this before. If you really love mushrooms you have to try this dish. \n-My boyfriend got the Linguine alle vongole which had fresh clams with a white wine reduction. This dish was amazing. The sauce was so tasty and when the bread was dipped inside it was oh so good. \n-My friend got the Grigliata mista di pesce with grilled calamari, shrimp, salmon, and swordfish. I had never tasted seafood so good before. This dish was literally amazing. \n\nThey gave the birthday girl a tiramisu cake also. A big piece and it was amazing tiramisu. The atmosphere is nice with candles at each table with super friendly Italian service. Come and try it out and you won't regret it!", "author": "Audrey C."}

The place was pretty full, glad we made reservations. We were immediately taken to a cozy table inside. We ordered the Burrata mozzarella for Antipasti. It was excellent! It was an assortment of butter cheese, Parma prosciutto, cherry tomatoes and arugala. The restaurant gave us house bread which went very well with the cheese, just melted in our mouth. My husband ordered the Agnello al Brunello (rack of lamb), which was alright. I ordered the Rombo all'isolana (baked halibut, fresh tomato sauce, olives, sliced potatoes). The halibut was so so good! I have rarely had fish made so well. The house bread again with the tomato sauce was excellent. The sauce was more like a light broth which was pipping hot. The waiter and the bus waiter were very polite and nice. For the second helping of bread when I said no, they suggested keeping it on my table so that I could have it with my fish and I am glad they did, because I polished it! Since we ate so much bread and carbs, we passed on the desert.  It was a perfect Thanks Giving meal! A bit on the higher end but totally worth it.", "author": "Pakhi P."}

It's along a very unassuming block, but when you walk in, it is tastefully decorated with high ceilings and beautiful lighting.  We were fortunate to find street parking close by, but there is also paid parking right at the nearest cross street.\n\nSome family friends had made a reservation for 5pm with an employee on Saturday and apparently walked away before someone could correct them that the kitchen didn't really open until 5:30pm.  We arrived today at 5pm, knocked on the door, explained the situation, and the waiter ran back to inform the chef and let us in early to accomodate our early reservation.\n\nThe food here is fantastic!  There are multiple vegetarian options which is great, and the kitchen is more than willing to work with you to make a dish how you would like it.  They will substitute, etc, to customize it for you.  I had the spinach salad and the spinach and cheese gnocchi which were both divine.  My husband had the other gnocchi dish, which I tasted and also adored.  The appetizer bread is served with an olive spread which is also delicious.

For this price, this is a great deal for good quality Italian food in BIG portions!  \n\nThe menu is nicely divided into \"Earth\" and \"Ocean\".  I personally like their seafood dishes slightly better than the meat dishes. \nI like the Warm Octopus and the Grilled Squid starters.\nFor main course, the Seabass Ravioli is really awesome... comes with a lobster reduction that you want to lick every last drop of.  (The more civilized way would be to ask for more bread.)\n\nOn the \"Earth\" side of things, both the Lamb Ragu and the Tagliatelle with porcini and truffle oil are great.  But I would still go back for the Seabass Ravioli.\n\nDesserts - congratulations if you can get through a starter and main course and still have room for dessert.  You should think about entering into competitive eating.  But anyway, desserts are fairly classic.  I've had the tiramisu and profiteroles.  Both are very well-executed.\n\nAll in, I like La Briciola as a great neighborhood Italian.  You won't find very fancy creative dishes here, but the food is good, the atmosphere is casual, and the food and wine are priced reasonably.

I chose the orechiette with sausage-- was delicious! but didn't agree with me the next day (not the fault of the restaurant-- i have a sensitive stomach).  \n\nFor dessert, they brought my dad a dessert with a candle (gelato with strawberries) and my brother a tiramisu with a candle and a happy birthday song for each :)  The waiter also brought us a round of sweet dessert wine on the house.  \n\nOverall, everyone loved La Briciola!  The service was warm and personal, and the food was on point.  The menu was a little price-y, but not overly so.

They have two tables up front for two that allow you to look out. They accommodate groups quite well as well, having a decent amount of space to piece together tables. The service is timely and the staff is friendly and attentive. \n\nThe dishes are of top-notch quality as well, though the portion is quite small. Their carpaccio and tagliere are worth a try. For the primi, I am a fan of the any Gnocchi and squid ink risotto. The gnocchis are really soft and well flavored. The squid ink risotto is delicious. They also have a lasagna de mare that's worth trying. Then for secondi, the swordfish, Caciucco di viareggio, and the T-bond steak are my tops. Finally, for dessert, they have the normal range of Italian sweets: Souffle, tiramisu, and panna cotta are my go-tos for any Italian place they they do not disappoint. \n\nGIven their small portions, you are actually okay ordering 4 courses. However, the bill does rack up very quickly, particularly if wine is involved. (I'm a fan of their Chianti's).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-03-02", "description": "With a huge menu and a range of dishes from vegetarian to rabbit there is something for everyone here but most of the dishes aren't that special.\n\nWithout a doubt this is a good restaurant with good solid food and occasionally some quite good food.\n\nWe were a party of four on Tuesday night. We had made reservations that weren't needed as there was about a dozen tables filled at 8pm. The decor looks like they stopped half way through the decoration process but there is nothing horrible about it.\n\nThe service was excellent and helpful without being intrusive. The were able to seat us even though we came early and our party was not complete.\n\nI was dining with two vegetarians, one pescatarians and myself, an omnivore.\n\nThe dishes we had:\nCarpaccio di manzo-a straightford dish of raw beef, arugula, cheese and olive oil. it's was simple and just the way it should be. \n\nFagottino ripieno- veggie crepes with a wild porcini mushrooms and truffle oil. this was probably the best vegetarian dish with a rich creamy sauce and savory filling.\n\nInsalata del campo, a very basic and boring salad, nothing more and nothing less.\n\nOur Entrees were:\n\nTwo orders of Gnocchi con taleggio: this was another average dish and while the gnocchi were light and fluffy, the spinach was non-existant and it seemed unfinished.\n\nravioli con pomodoro-again it was decent but uninspiring spinach and ricotta ravioli with a tomato sauce.\n\nthe three veggie dishes were all under the primi courses but they were entree sized and entree priced.\n\nThe best entree by far was the \nConiglio in umido con polenta where the rabbit was amazing as was the polenta. first off it was huge plate of rabbit and then served with some of the best polenta I have had in San Francisco. The rabbit was cooked beautifully and then was in a rich italian hunter style sauces, all the was tender and moist and tasted like rabbit without any gaminess. the polenta was super crisp on the outside and super creamy on the inside.\n\nWe finished our meal with four desserts, all of which were good.\nWe had:\nTiramisu-very moist and good and pretty standard\nCreme Carmel which was good but tasted a bit over flavored and burnt\nPanna cotta with berry sauce-it was the special and the best dessert, super creamy and rich and the berries was wonderful and burst in your mouth\nProfitterolles filled with creme served warm and covered in chocolate sauce, really large portion of four of them but they weren't as good as at Delfina.\n\nThe bill can add up if you are doing multiple course with antipasta in the low teens, primi in the high teens and secondi  in the 20's. Our bill with three glasses of wine, 3 soft drinks, and three coffee beverages was well over 200.\n\nAll in all this an ideal place to come for a business dinner or a more formal meal with the parents or a date from the Marina. It's does good Italian food in a boring if professional setting.\n\nI may come back with meat eaters or if it's a business expense.", "author": "DeathandFood H."}

If you don't pay attention while walking, you might just miss it and not know! It's rather is a rather shady neighborhood. (At least it seemed so the night we went because there was not a soul on the road in SoMa!)\n\nBut, when you walk in and you get greeted by warmth (not just because the heater was on, but because the place looked warm and the people here flashed warm welcoming smiles!), you just stop dissing whoever you were dissing! Great ambiance. A very romantic setting for those of you who want a quiet little place. Very much a ristorante Italiano feel!\n\nThe moment you are seated, you order the wine and are presented with bread that goes with the usual combination of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Their bread was hot from the oven and oh so soft. I think I stuffed myself with the bread even before I ordered my meal! Our table of 8 ordered 2 bottles of the Tollo San Giovese. Both the husband and I are not fond of red wines. But I totally loved this one. Smooth and not the kinds that gives you a headache. However, it is rather potent! Arun ordered the Italian beer to compliment his food and he was a happy person. I don't know whether it was the happiness courtesy Thanksgiving or they do it in general, but we were served a bruschetta sampler, on the house. That calls for one star atleast!\n\nTheir menu is rather eclectic. You can order stuff that comes from the earth (ergo, meat and veggies) and stuff that comes from the sea (ergo, seafood). My hubby and I ordered the Burrata and the Ravioli con Pomodoro and split it between us since we wanted to taste them both. They were both fantastic. I hadn't tried Ravioli before this and I think I am glad that this was the first time I tried it because I simply loved it. Their marinara was perfect. The prosciutto was yummy. I also managed to sample some of the Gnocchi con taleggio from a friend and the gnocchi just melted in my mouth!\n\nAn equally spaced out menu for the vegetarians, vegans and the ones that like meat. This place serves genuine Italian food. Not the bastardized American version :o)\n\nPost-dinner, the husband ordered himself a Cappuccino and me and a couple of my pals decided to split the Creme Caramel, which essentially tasted like Flan, felt like flan and I think, was flan!\nI managed to sip some of the cappuccino too and man, I was floored. I know this might sound bad about the coffee, but it tasted like coffee back in India and I was a happy birdie!! :-D\n\nPrice-wise, it is very reasonable. The average price for a dish is around $10-$12. Our total bill for 8 came up to $280 including tips. \n\nArun and I would definitely go back to this place. Its just lovely with lovely people serving you.", "author": "Ranjani S."}

The worst part was that after we spent close to $1000 and were tipping close to $200 they refused to take more than 1 card because it was \"too much work.\"  Instead we had to play a complicated game of figuring out who had cash, Chase Quickpay, Paypal, etc.  one poor friend had to put it on their card and then retrieve money from all over the internet.

I walked in, and the place was absolutely packed. I had no idea where my party of three was going to sit. The sweet blonde-haired hostess told me that we'd probably have to wait until 8:45 to get a table, but that she could probably work something out.\n\nI was preparing myself for utter disappointment and I really didn't want to leave. I was browsing their menu and practically salivating. A few minutes later, she came back and told us that we had a table! I was so ecstatic. \n\nWe sat in a cozy table and ordered the 2007 Avignonesi di Montelpulciano Toscana. This was absolutely perfect for me and my man even though we ordered seafood dishes. My good friend was a bartender in NY for the longest time and he definitely knew his wine. \n\nWe started off with the Tagliere di Salumi coppa~spek~prosciutto~salame~olives~marinated vegetables. This was a fantastic dish to share. I love coppa so this was the perfect starter. \n\nMy friend had the Straccietti al rag\u00fa di agnello hand cut pasta~lamb rag\u00fa. He seemed to really enjoy it. \n\nMy guy had the Ravioli di cernia seabass filled ravioli~lobster reduction. Like some Yelpers, I thought the reduction completely overshadowed the seabass - which I could not taste at all. The sauce was delicious and perfect for bread dipping.\n\nI had the Risotto al nero di seppia calamari~ink sauce~scallops. I failed to pay attention to the \"ink sauce\" part of the dish. When my dish came, I dug into the big (but few) pieces of calamari and one scallop (just one?!) and of course, ate the risotto by spoonfuls.  At least it was delicious. The black risotto was absolutely creamy and flavorful. I love squid. It was cooked very nicely here. \n\nHowever - What my lack of attention regarding squid INK resulted in was my teeth covered in pure black - squid - ink. So, here I was talking politics to my two dinner companions, and they were laughing at me and my black teeth. \n\nOur server and the hostess were both polite and efficient.

When I checked out the menu online I narrowed my search down to their risotto allo scoglio (seafood risotto with prawns, calamari, and clams). Unfortunately, they only served it as a lunch special. Boyfriend calls up the restaurant to see if the chef could still make it for dinner, guy says \"yes.\" Score! \n\nWe show up at the restaurant which was empty since we got there fairly early, but the minute we walked in I was already in awe at how intimate it looked. There was a wine rack that lined the far back wall and the walls are painted a nice, simple cream color which gives it a soothing ambiance. While the large arch ways separating the bar with the dining room table gives it a more lively and spacious feel to it.\n\nWe were seated in the back where I could see they had a large selection of wine. I was already ready to order my risotto but then the guy said that it's only offered during lunch. Kinda disappointed by his lack of effort with not asking the chef the possibility in comparison to the guy we spoke to over the phone, so I had to dock a star. Simple gesture that takes less than 2 minutes. Didn't feel like bothering with that, so I just ended up going with the Ravioli di cernia (seabass filled ravioli with lobster reduction). The seabass gave the ravioli a nice light flavor to it so that it didn't feel so heavy with the lobster reduction. Not disappointed at all because it was just the right amount so I could fit some dessert in with my meal. My boyfriend got the Risotto alla monferrina (saffron risotto with sausage) and he was a bit disappointed since the risotto was a little on the under cooked side and the flavor just wasn't there for him plus the portion was way too big. I ended my dinner on a high note with the Souffl\u00e9 al cioccolato (warm chocolate cake~chocolate sauce). It was delicious...I could hardly share with my boyfriend. \n\nI think I'd have to come back to try the other dishes and the waiting staff wasn't all that bad. But I did find it odd that one of the guys who were the hosts, was not dressed in uniform at all, so I was a bit confused when he was leading us to our table.

Other reviewers are correct in saying that they throw Italian words into all their sentences; \"bella\" was thrown around a few times. Other yelpers are INCORRECT in that the portions here are not small at all. I thought they were perfect, especially since for a meal that is designed to have 3 courses.\n\nThe bread basket was to die for. I ate nearly the whole thing all by my lonesome. The dipping sauce was also amazing. I did not discover until halfway through the basket that you have to \"dip deep\" to get the good chunks at the bottom of the bowl.\n\nFor an antipasto, I attempted to order the Burrata, but they were out, it was very sad. Instead I ordered Sfogliatine con gamberi e asparagi. This was kind of a let down. I love puff pastry, but the pastry was lacking in the puff department, and lacking flakiness. My date ordered the carpaccio, which was pretty tasty. I feel I can not properly judge though, because I had never had carpaccio before.\n\nFor our primi, we shared the gnocchi sorrentina. I was very unsure about this gnocchi. On the one hand, it was much much softer/mushier than gnocchi I have had before, but it was also kind of nice that it wasn't heavy at all. This must be the dish that people refer to as \"Chef Boyardee.\" My date said it smelled like spaghetti-o's. Fortunately, it tasted better than spaghetti-o's.\n\nFor secondi, I had the halibut and my date had the filet mignon. The halibut was good, but maybe a little too salty. I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was that made me not finish it. I hate beef, but the filet mignon was not bad; my date certainly liked it.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the profiteroles. They were yummy. The filling was perfect and the chocolate sauce was absolutely to die for. I am quite judgmental of profiteroles because I have made them many many times. It was a very good finish to a sort of medium meal.\n\nMy experience here was not negative, but I think I would try other Italian places before returning.", "author": "Caitlin H."}

Paired with their slow service I don't think I'll be returning. The restaurant itself is cute and charming and most of the people there seem to be Italians.

Came back here last week after many years away because I was in the mood for some seafood.  As always, the staff was very welcoming, and there was plenty of room on a Wednesday night.  We sat at the bar and ordered some wine, which I was very pleased with.  They promptly brought out their delicious bread... warm and crisp, and they kept it coming all night (bad for my low carb goals but good for the bread loving devil inside me).  Started with the steamed mussels and clams.  It was a very simple broth, but was likely the best steamed seafood I've had in a restaurant.  I was seriously spooning the broth straight into my mouth at one point.  It was that good.  We also got the grilled calamari and the pulpo.  The grilled calamari was perfect.  I likes that the dish only included the whole mantles that charred up nicely.  The pulpo was so incredibly tender that at first I thought they had given us something else.  I'm really looking forward to coming back for more of their seafood dishes.", "author": "Ash T."}

The service was good and friendly, but the restaurant was nearly when we arrived just prior to 6 p.m.  \n\nWe ordered the insalata del campo (arugala salad with cherry tomatoes and shaved parmagiano), sea bass ravioli, and filet mignon.  There was also a yelp coupon that offered one free dessert per table, but my wife negotiated to grab us two desserts, so we got to try to chocolate lava cake and panna cotta.  \n\nThe bread was quite excellent and the decor was nice.  The salad was okay - fresh, but not worth the $9 that was charged.

Definitely a date/ anniversary/ special occasion spot. The employees were very attentive and were very easy-going as we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. \n\nThe menu offers a pretty good variety of selection, but as described in most of the other reviews, the portions are pretty small and overpriced. Having read these reviews, I did my best to prepare by eating a bit beforehand. I ordered the Vitello alla valdostana (rolled veal), which I thought would be satisfying and somewhat filling, especially for being an entree dish. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the portion size, BUT those were really (small but) delicious bites! Amongst my friends' dishes (including lamb, salmon and pastas), I heard opinions of it being delicious but not filling OR a bit bland. In the end, it definitely adds up if you're expecting to be full at the end of your meal.\n\nOverall, decent food, small portions, and GREAT service.

I don't really give out 5-stars that freely, but this place is awesome.\n\nFirst of all, getting a reservation was a breeze. Despite its high ratings and popularity, it's not one of those restaurants where you go on Open Table and you can't find an opening within 2.5 hours of your specified time blah blah blah etc etc... I hate that. I actually had to shift my reservation later by half an hour (party of 6) about an hour before dinner, and the woman told me it was no problem. She was so nice and accommodating.\n\nWhen I got there, the hostess was so nice, and was actually able to seat me early. The bread and olive oil dip are as good as everyone says; strong olive oil flavor with bits of olive at the bottom, and warm, crusty Italian bread. Delicious!\n\nI had the sea bass ravioli with lobster reduction, which was great, not too heavy, with a nice seafood-y flavor. My sister had the clam linguine with white wine sauce, which was delicious. My dad got the lamb ragu, which looked yummy as well (I didn't get a chance to try it because he ate it all), so I definitely am coming back to try that. Al their pasta (I think) is house-made, and it's sooo delicious.\n\nFor dessert, I had the panna cotta, which was so light and fluffy, yet rich and creamy at the same time. I don't know how they do it! It wasn't on the menu tonight, so if you want this you might have to ask for it. \n\nAlthough I usually feel stuffed after an Italian dinner, I didn't tonight. All the proportions were just right, and I felt satisfied, but not uncomfortably stuffed. I was surprised, given the amount of bread I ate before dinner! The ambiance is wonderful.. cozy and warm, reminiscent of Italy...and the service is great.

My bf lives a couple blocks away and we're always searching for more restaurants in SOMA, and we were very happy with this find. \n\nWe walked in on a Sunday night with no reservations, but they seated us promptly. We had the cutest bald waiter straight from Italy who answered all our questions in Italian. I loved it even though I couldn't understand him (just smile and nod). I'm not usually a huge fan of the white bread they serve you, but this one was super soft and went perfectly with the tapenade. I practically finished the whole thing by myself (bye bye Cancun diet). For wine, I ordered the Frascati from Italy (similar to a Pinot Grigio) and my bf got the Riesling. Both were great, although the riesling was a tad better since I'm partial to that. \n\nThe zuppa was great too - I didn't order an appetizer since I was pretty stuffed from bread and wanted to save my reserves for the main course. My bf got the sausage, spinach and frommage pasta and I ordered the baked halibut with tomato sauce, olives, and thinly sliced potatoes. The fish itself wasn't the BEST fish I've ever had (tasted a little too... fishy, if you know what I mean). But I figured I'd have better luck with another dish next time - everything else was so good I could tell it was probably just unique to what I ordered. And I'm definitely not this forgiving normally. \n\nThe best part though, was the dessert. The profiteroles were ginormous and overflowing with chocolatey goodness. The caramel custard was delish too. And on top of that - this is what really did it - remember our cute little Italian baldie? He gave us 2 free glasses of Moscato sparkling wine, which is our absolute FAVORITE meal topper. He definitely got a brownie points for that one. So we guzzled and licked the rest of our meal and came back stuffed and satisfied. \n\nDefinitely coming back, especially since it's so good and there were so many other things I wanted to try, like the seabass stuffed ravioli and the warm octopus salad.", "author": "Natalie W."}

My bf and I were looking for a place to eat around his place and as novices to the area we looked on yelp and found this place. It's a small little nook by the freeway but has a really classy interior that I was not expecting. 5 stars for that.\n\nThe service was also amazing! The waiter (we are convinced he might also be some sort of owner or family member as well) was just wonderful giving us a free sample of his bellini champagne for free to enjoy with our dessert. 5 stars here as well.\n\nThe food was great. Their bread they give at the table is so fresh and fluffy and is given with a delicious kalamata olive spread. I love olives so I really enjoyed this. We also got the bruschetta sampler - it had roasted pepper, eggplant and zucchini, and pomodoro (or tomato) bruschetta. It was honestly so delicious. Then we got the spinach and cheese ravioli and this is the only part that wasn't mouth watering. It was still really good, but just not up to the delicious caliber of the rest of the items at the restaurant. Lastly, since it was my boyfriend's birthday, I insisted we get the tiramisu (even though we were stuffed) for dessert, and man, it was good. As I mentioned earlier, our waiter brought us the champagne to accompany and they were just divine together.\n\nWe will definitely be going back here often since its only a few blocks from his place.", "author": "Raina B."}

The restaurant has a nice cozy layout but the tables aren't right on top of each other which I hate! We started with the bruschetta which was nice although not exactly what I was expecting. There were three different types of bruschetta on the plate, a zucchini, pepperoni and the classic tomato. They were nice, but I would have preferred one piece of the traditional tomato, I don't like my apps to be too big.  We ordered a lovely Italian Pinot Grigio to go with our meal and the server was kind enough to make some menu recommendations to compliment the wine which I thought was a nice touch. I had the ravioli and my husband had the gnocchi. Both were delicious and paired with the wine nicely. We had a lovely dinner and I will be back!", "author": "WaltzingMatilda T."}

I was starving after shopping all day and craving Italian food but did not want to deal with the mediocre and overpriced tourist restaurants at North Beach.\n\nGot to the address which looked quite shady outside, but once you walk in to the restaurant, you are transported to a different world from the gang type characters outside.  People are dressed for dinner.\n\nWe arrived around 7pm and were able to get a table without reservation.  Not even 15 minutes later the place was packed and people kept arriving even after 9:30pm.\n\nWe ordered wine by the glass and both my friend's Chardonnay and my Cabernet were very good.  \n\nThen we shared Sfogliatine con gamberi e asparagi puff pastry~asparagus~shrimp~crab reduction.  It was delicious but @ $14 it sure needed more than two and I mean only two penny size pieces of shrimp.  The stuffing was purely vegetables.  The crab reduction as well as the puff pastry were delicious.  Next time just add MORE SHRIMP! and it will be perfect.\n\nFor my main course I had Straccietti al rag\u00fa di agnello hand cut pasta~lamb rag\u00fa which was very tasty but not out of this world. $17\n\nMy friend had the Rombo all'isolana baked halibut~fresh tomato sauce~olives~sliced potatoes which was absolutely delicious. @ $23 She loved it, I loved it and I plan to go back to get a whole dish to my self!  The portion was big and the fish was cooked perfectly.  Moist and flaky.  The tomato sauce was light and delicious and it did not overwhelmed the fish.  If anything it brought out the natural flavors of the halibut.  So, so good.\n\nService was perfect.  Friendly, attentive, knowledgeable.  I think he was the part owner people are referring to.  Very smiley and nice.  Threw in a few Italian words here and there so that was perfect too! :)\n\nThe dessert was good but nothing amazing. \n\nThe reason I am giving 4 stars is because of the halibut, the service and the so, so , so comfortable ambiance.  I don't usually like sitting at a restaurant for more than an hour and a half without getting antsy, but we were there for 2 and a half hours just talking and enjoying the restaurant and wine.

A few friends and I visited La Briciola recently for dinner and were fortunate to find this place on short notice - great combination of Open Table (to find a reservation for 6 people with only 30 mins. advance notice on a Friday night), Yelp (to confirm that La Briciola would be a great place to dine), Google Maps to find my way there, and multitasking on my Palm Pre to make it using all of the above so seamless =). The restaurant has a fantastic milieu with lots of light, tall ceilings, and a very cozy feel. Based on my one visit here, La Briciola definitely seems like a hidden gem (i.e., should be packed on a Friday night but still had a couple of open tables). Anyways, onto the review!\n\nFirst off, even before the food, I must point out that the host / head waiter were both tremendously friendly. In particular, the head waiter was particularly energetic, welcoming, and helpful. If you want to visit an establishment where you truly feel welcome, this is definitely a place to visit.\n\nMy meal consisted of delicious bread (with a great olive oil / minced olive dip) and bruschette, Ravioli con pomodoro (spinach and ricotta filled ravioli with basil & fresh tomato sauce), and a fantastic '07 vintage Irony Pinot Noir (we ordered a bottle for the table) that complemented the meal well. Service was reasonably speedy and definitely friendly. Per another reviewer's commentary, this is a traditional Italian restaurant with a menu comprised of first (primi) and second (secondi) courses, so the portions are consequently a little small (my only real reason for giving this place 4 stars instead of 5). \n\nAnother great touch by the restaurant: during our meal, a person at a neighboring table dropped a glass of red wine that shattered, splattering red wine all over my friend's (thankfully black) wool coat. Not only did the staff quickly help dry off her jacket, but they brought our table a complimentary round of dessert wine (possibly Prosecco?) - overall, an extremely kind gesture by them, and one that did not go unnoticed.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a nice Italian meal (mid-priced), I recommend that you keep La Briciola in the mix.", "author": "Rishi N."}

This place is pretty close to the ballpark right on 3rd street!  \n\nNow one of my main concerns is how this place looks so unassuming - people pass by this little golden nugget all the time!  Don't be fooled though, it's a wonderful place, but a tad small from how it looks on the outside.  You can easily miss it (we drove by 2x before finally seeing it!).  \n\nAfter coming in, we were met by a wonderful hostess that accommodated even though we didn't have a reservation (you should put one in, you won't regret it!).  The day we came in was pretty busy because of prom.\n\nThe ambiance was pretty good - well lit, tasteful decorations, and a great waiter!  The hostess made sure we were comfortable and extremely friendly.  \n\nThe waiter spoke fluent Itallian, and treated us kindly despite the fact that they were going to have a 7:00PM reservation (we arrived a little before 6:00PM).  \n\nWe didn't feel rushed, and they even started us off with an appetizer and have I mentioned their toast is to die for?  The appetizer was a different mixture from the original Bruschette assortite instead of the normal zucchini, eggplant, and fresh tomatoes.  It was eggplant, bell peppers, and fresh tomatoes.  I'm not one for bell peppers, but I would make an exception to this one.  The bell peppers were nicely marinated that I could easily eat more of it if I could. \n\nMy group ordered different entrees so we could share:\n\nRavioli con pomodoro spinach and ricotta filled ravioli~fresh tomato sauce~basil\n\nStraccietti al rag\u00fa di agnello hand cut pasta~lamb rag\u00fa\n\nRavioli di cernia seabass filled ravioli~lobster reduction\n\nFarfalle con salmone smoked salmon~peas~brandy reduction \n\nFor dessert we had:\nProfitterolles alla vanilla  pastry puff~vanilla ice cream~chocolate\n\nAnd something that wasn't on the menu, but a special they had for that day:  a chocolate souffle that was similar to a lava cake.\n\nAll their food were absolutely divine.  \n\nI highly recommend this place and I can't wait until the next time I stop over for a bite to eat.", "author": "Nina M."}

We ordered two dishes on the menu that fellow Yelpers highly recommended and we were sadly disappointed.  \n\nBread and olive tapenade:  The fresh baked white bread was good although a bit on the yeasty side.  It paired nicely with the olive tapenade which I thought was a nice change of pace from the usual serving of olive oil found in most other places.\n\n\"Cesare\" salad:  I'll admit that I'm a bit of a Caesar snob and that I understand Caesar salad isn't a truly from Italy, but regardless, if it's on your menu it should reflect flavors indicative of a caesar dressing  such raw garlic, tart lemon juice, salty anchovy, olive oil, parmesan and ground pepper...WE TASTED NOTHING EVEN CLOSE TO THIS....The romaine was chopped nearly to shreds as though it could have been used to dress an order of tacos (caesar salad romaine is chunky not shredded).  There was way too much cheese on the plate as if the cheese WAS the dressing.  The croutons weren't very flavorful.  This entire salad reminded of something I would eat at an outdoor family picnic, bagged lettuce and Kraft dressing from a bottle...\n\nSea-bass ravioli:  This dish was just okay.  I was excited to see nice chunks of lobster meat in the sauce, only to discover that they were overcooked and rubbery.  The sea-bass filling inside the ravioli felt a little pasty as well.  \n\nTagliatelle with porcini and truffles:  The mushroom sauce was very tasty and the homemade pasta noodles were decent, but for this price they should've been better.  What screwed up this dish was that the star of the plate (the porcini) was undercooked and there were exactly 0 truffles in the dish, only truffle flavored oil.  Don't call out black truffles in the title of the dish if there aren't any.   A few pieces of the mushroom \"cubes\" were nicely sauteed and had a melt in your mouth quality, but the majority of the mushrooms were hard and rubbery, like eating chicken gizzards.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-03-14", "description": "It was my turn to choose a restaurant and the Yelp reviews of La Braciola made this sound like a great choice (full disclosure: we couldn't get an 8:30 reservation at La Ciccia). The meal wasn't horrible and I would give it an extra half star if I could but it wasn't all that good either. In a city of great dining options a place like this will suffer from comparisons to great restaurants.\n\nWe arrived in SOMA at 8:30 and the place was practically empty. There were exactly 8 other people in there. An empty restaurant is such a dreary experience for me. The place itself is nice if not a bit sparsely decorated. The wait staff were attentive and friendly but then again what else did they have to do?\n\nThe menu is huge and I took a long time to decide because oddly enough none of it seemed all that original or interesting. Their wine list is equally big featuring many Italian selections. \nWe began with the lamb ragu. It was watery and the ground lamb was hard to taste. Ragu (of anything) should be rich and savory but this one was very bland. What a disappointment since we actually ordered the wine based on this dish.\n\nI had the involtino di pesce spada (swordfish stuffed with mascarpone and zucchini served with a tomato sauce). It was the most original thing on the menu and despite my negative reaction whenever seafood is mixed with cheese (crab being the exception!) I went for it. It was okay but this yelp review is now the only reason I will remember it. The vegetables/potatoes on the side were better than the main dish. The potatoes were roasted with salt and garlic; they were delicious and I could eat a plate of them!\n\nMy friend had the Ravioli di cernia (seabass filled ravioli). We both thought they were just so-so.\n\nWe ended with a tiramisu and it was the highlight of the meal (other than the wine!).\n\nI give them credit for being a pioneer establishment down in lonely SOMA.

The only reason I won't give this place a 5 star review is because I don't think that such a sharp increase in prices for dinner is warranted, but that is truly picking nits.

Although it was stuffed with an ordinary array of veggies like carrots and broccoli, the rich porcini cream sauce with a drizzle of truffle oil had a nice earthiness and was enough to carry the dish.\n\nThe gnocchi in the next course missed the mark because they were too large and doughy.  The cream sauce was also uninspiring.  If you happen to come to La Briciola (which I don't recommend) and get the gnocchi (also not recommended) I would split the dish.  I'd say it's too heavy for most people to enjoy themselves.\n\nThe main dish was the real bummer.  Veal pounded thin and rolled with spek (a type of prosciutto) and fontina cheese.   The only real flavor of the plate came from a thick, floury white wine sauce that tasted like it  was born of a dry soup mix.  The side was a reincarnation of the same ordinary veggies found in the crepe: a sad little pile of roasted carrots, broccoli and potato.  The whole thing looked and tasted like it came from a hospital cafeteria.  The only difference was that it cost $24.\n\nThe service was a bit slow because the place was full.  The waiter was  friendly enough but seemed in over his head.  He was also the type of guy who made sure to throw in an Italian word with every sentence - I guess he thought it was charming.  Like when ever he said \"Thank You\" he followed it with \"Grazie\"; whenever he said \"Enjoy\" then came \"Buon Appetito\".

I had walked by La Bricola several times and thought to myself this is an odd spot for an Italian place, half a block away from the freeway overpass and not much else around.  My party arrived at about 10:30 p.m. on a Wednesday for a late dinner.  The dinner was great and I would go back for sure.\n\nLike many other San Francisco noveau Italian places (SPQR-A16-54 Mint), La B uses fresh local ingredients in their cooking.  You can really taste the freshness in all the dishes.\n\nWe started with a round of appetizers.  The ministroni soup topped off with some shaved parmasan was good.  I took a bite of my friend's caesar salad and though that they could tweak the dressing a bit to add more of an anchovy taste.  The brushetta was excellent - in particular the porcini mushrooms were a nice complement to the traditional tomato and basil flare.  Another friend ordered a trio of raw fish - salmon, halibut, and swordfish - was tasty but I think the Japanese got the Italians beat when it comes to raw fish.  Lastly, the beef carpaicio was tasty and went well with the basil and shaved Parmesan.\n\nFor our pasta course - I had the ravioli stuffed with sea bass - this dish was the highlight of the entire meal.  The sea bass was not drowned out by the other flavors or the creamy lobster reduction sauce.  A must.  I also sampled some squid ink linguine with fresh squid which was also great if you are a fan of the ink.  For vegetarians, try the pesto linguine with roasted potatoes, cut green beans, and asparagus - the pesto was excellent.\n\nOur second course was not as impressive as the pasta.  I ordered the filet.  I found it to be a bit bland  The portion was large - 10 onces at least.  I would have much rather prefferred a smaller more flavorful portion.  My friend ordered the lamb chops which were much better.\nTo be honest, I could have easily stopped eating after the pasta course and that is probably what I would do in the future.  \n\nThe  wine list is also excellent and reasonably priced.  We had two bottles for just under 100 bucks.  The 2005 Brancaia Italian (Tuscany) Red \"Tre\" was excellent.  It was smooth and went well with our appetizers and pasta.  The next bottle was an Alexander Valley Cab Franc which was a pretty standard cab - good but not as good as our first.\n\nAll and all, I would go back for sure would stick to the pasta and appetizers.", "author": "Moe J."}

Dining out can be a challenge - especially with this perplexing trend among SF restaurants of serving all types of offal, hooves, snouts and whatnot on their fancy ass foodie menus. My god, it's the stuff of nightmares! But I digress.\n\nNot so at La Briciola. I was delighted to see a ricotta and spinach stuffed ravioli on the menu served with a simple tomato sauce. HEAVENLY.  The sauce was perfectly balanced to bring out the flavor of the tomatoes without relying on too much salt.  A pet peeve of mine is over-salted sauces. Allow the fresh ingredients to sing on their own without relying too much on the salt shaker -- and that is exactly what La Briciola does.  The dish made me very happy.\n\nThe service is excellent with the owners tending to your every need and making you feel welcome. A warm and inviting atmosphere soothes and refreshes after a hectic day.   You can't help but live it up in there and drink too much wine - it's a fun place.

My roommate and I started with the burrata, which comes with the-perfect-amount-of-saltiness-and-sprinkles-of-basil cheese, a small arugula salad, and a couple slices of prosciutto.  It was totally awesome and obviously right up my alley.\n\nFor entrees, I had the Straccietti al rag\u00fa di agnello (lamb).  The lamb ragu sauce was great- lamby, gamey and rich- and wasn't too salty.  The pasta was for the most part very well cooked, but there were a couple pieces of fused, semi-hardened chunks indicative of the pasta having been cooked and recooked.  Well worth $17.\n\nMy roommate had the Risotto al nero di seppia calamari, with ink sauce and a scallop.  The presentation on this dish far exceeded that of my dish, but we both remarked on how large the portion size was.  Nevertheless, quantity did not come at the price of quality.  The dish was extremely flavorful and at least the roomie says the seafood tasted very fresh.  I might have to order this at some point.  Again, well worth $18.\n\nThe service was good, and our waiter kindly waived their $18 corkage, which resulted in him getting a slight more generous tip.  Thank you for that.  The wine list is decently sized but not terribly impressive.  For my price point, lots of super-common $10 retail bottles listed at $38.

High marks for the appetizers.\n\nOf the four entrees, two were very good, the \"agnello al brunello\" (rack of lamb, medium rare) and the \"grigliata mista di pesce\" (various fish and seafood). One was only so-so, the \"straccietti al rag\u00fa di agnello\" (lamb ragu), with the flavor of the lamb completely disguised by the sauce. Unfortunately, had it been hamburger I doubt we would've known the difference.\n\nIt was the fourth entr\u00e9e, though, that was really troubling. We ordered the \"paccheri con gamberi e broccholi\" (paccheri pasts with shrimp and saffron sauce), but what came out was the \"paccheri con salsiccia e rape\" (paccheri pasta with sausage). The server quickly recognized the error - perhaps it was not the first time? - and whisked away the plate. \n\nThe plate was returned in just a few minutes, this time with shrimp. In retrospect, it should've been amazing that they cooked new pasta so quickly, but we didn't figure it out until the end of the meal - finding a few small pieces of sausage at the bottom of the plate and realizing that the \"saffron sauce\" had been white, not yellow! \n\nWhen we asked the server directly whether the pasta had not actually been prepared with a saffron sauce, whether anything had gone awry, he went to great lengths to tell us that it had (and not to eat a saffron sauce that isn't yellow - whoops!). Now, obviously the staff was in a tough spot - other entrees had already been served when the error was discovered, including medium rare rack of lamb, but it doesn't seem right to deceive one's customers.\n\nWe still coughed up $125, but the meal didn't seem quite as worth it afterward.", "author": "Michael F."}

A lucky find :)  My former coworkers and I got together for dinner in the city tonight (gosh, I miss them so much!). I arbitrarily picked a place near the Caltrain station - who would have thought it would be so amazing?! \n\nWe started off with a bottle of Pinot Noir and warm bread dipped in garlic, sundried tomato and olive oil. The dipping sauce was seriously addictive and the bread was perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.\n\nT got the mushroom tagliatelle with white truffle oil. The flavor of the truffle oil was 'mouthgasmic.' (Oddly, I was eating truffle oil last night with mac n' cheese. It's been a truffle oil start to the week!)\n\nI ordered the lamb ragu, having been convinced by the yelpers calling it out as \"the thing to get.\" It really was very enjoyeable, rich and tomatoey, but still not nearly as good as that dang truffle oil.\n\nN, who is apparently now vegetarian (when did this happen??), opted for the baked veggies antipasti. Very rich, delicious but probably best shared.\n\nFinished off the meal with a traditional tiramisu with fresh cut strawberries.\n\nThanks guys for hanging. I miss you and everyone else :( :( :(", "author": "Samantha C."}

We had read that if you mention Yelp, they give you a free appetizer. We were really eyeing the Burrata, and were thrilled when the waiter (possibly the owner?) let us choose any appetizer from the menu for the complimentary appetizer.\n\nAs there were 4 of us, we ended up ordering 2 bottles of wine: a $28 SanGiovese and a $33 Chardonnay. I thought the SanGiovese was really good, though it was a bit warm (as a result of it being hot that day?).\n\nWe ended up all ordering pastas and sharing them family-style. We ordered:\n\n* Risotto alla monferrina arborio (rice, sausage, saffron). Not sure why, but I didn't really like this dish much. The sausage pieces seemed a bit too large and the taste wasn't that great.\n\n* Tagliolini di mare (mussels, clams, calamari, shrimp, cherry tomatoes). I thought this was the best dish from the four we tried. The seafood was good, and the pasta noodles were extremely fresh, not to mention the great taste.\n\n* Ravioli di cernia seabass filled (ravioli, lobster reduction). This was the dish that I ordered, and I thought it was a little bit too salty for my liking, though the raviolis were clearly fresh.\n\n* Straccietti al rag\u00fa di agnello (hand cut pasta, lamb rag\u00fa). This was my 2nd favorite dish. I'm not a lamb fan, but the taste was actually pretty decent; not very lamby. The hand-cut pasta, though, was phenomenal.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered a bowl of strawberries with gelato (Fragole con gelato) and some chocolate lava cake (not on the menu). Nothing special to report on the desserts. The lava cake was actually baked all the way through; the lava didn't \"flow\", so to speak.\n\nOverall, the food was just okay, but I really liked the atmosphere and though the service was pretty good.", "author": "John C."}

The evening started off well, with pleasant and attentive service.  However, upon ordering, we were told that one of the dishes - the pesto gnocchi - was unavailable that evening.  To compensate, we were given an order of bruscetta to compensate.  \n\nIt took quite a while for the food to come - over an hour.  We also noted that almost every table in the restaurant was experiencing the same - everyone had drinks and bread (some had their salads) but other than that, no main courses.\n\nIn terms of food quality, it was hit or miss.  My Caesar salad had no dressing, and my main dish, the gnocchi with marinara, tasted watered down.  By that I mean that the marinara sauce was bland - no tomato taste, no bite.  Additionally, the mozarella cheese was rubbery, as though it had been reheated one too many times.  However, one of my friends had the lobster ravioli, which turned out well.\n\nIt's entirely conceivable that the evening we were there was a fluke, given the odd behavior.

And I'm soooo glad we did!!! My mom was very impressed as well and her boyfriend commented that it has the ambiance and feel of an intimate New York restaurant, which I agree with.\n\nLocated in an area that I wouldn't normally venture to for dinner, which is also nice - to get out of the crowds, the rut and easily find street parking! This is a hidden gem. The service was spectacular. Our waitperson was attentive, Italian, polite and cute to boot.\n\nThe food was scrumptious. The caesar dressing was very good but I often forget to ask for dressing on the side as I don't like as much as restaurants tend to add. Mom and I split this and the steamed mussels and clams dish which was so good that I asked for a spoon to finish the broth. Her boyfriend had the warm seafood salad which was also spectacular - I ate most of that as well. I don't usually like calamari but the dressing and shaved fennel left my palate begging for more. He also had the chickpea, broccoli, sausage soup and after I tasted it I almost locked him in the bathroom so i could finish it.\n\nDessert was ice cream with espresso and out of this world, even though it seems so simple. \n\nI will definitely eat here again and recommend it to others.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-04-12", "description": "If I were to describe La Briciola in a quick sentence, I would probably say that it's like \"a kid playing dress-up in Mommy's clothing\". Every aspect of this restaurant, from the webpage to food to the location, embodies that theme. The first thing I checked was the menu online, which was hidden among a sub-par website that looked like it was designed by a high school student in the 90s, complete with cheesy background music. Normally, I wouldn't be so critical of a webpage, but this place gave off the feeling that it was fancy, yet none of the installments really lived up to its expectation.\n\nThe Food: The menu had lots of fancy ingredients like swordfish, rabbit, sunchokes, etc, but overall was mediocre. The plating also was sub-par and made a difference between it being a \"grown-up\" restaurant.\n \n[Appetizer] Sfogliatine -- A puff pastry filled with a shrimp, crab, and asparagus reduction -- Honestly, this was like chicken pot pie but with seafood. The puff pastry wasn't the light phyllo dough kind, but a heavier version that encased the filling kind of like a hamburger. The filling itself was just all right.\n[Entree] Sea Bass Ravioli with Lobster Reduction -- This was just okay too. The raviolis were large, but the filling was only 40% of the entire thing. Also, with raviolis, oftentimes the flavor of the filling gets lost amongst the sauce and the dough. Something like sea bass, which has little flavor itself definitely blended in with this dish. The one redeeming part of this dish was the lobster reduction. Tasted like lobster bisque and was pretty yummy!\n[Entree] Rabbit Stew -- This was the best dish of the night! It had great flavor and a good mix of sides along with the rabbit itself. Having never had rabbit, I thought it was pretty good - although a few bits were inconsistently cooked and a little tough, but overall, I really enjoyed this!\n[Dessert] Tiramisu -- I really like my tiramisus rummy. This one was good, but nothing to write home about, although with the size of it, it actually tasted lighter than it looked, which is good.\n\nThe location was also something to be desired. Tucked between two grungy shops with bars on the windows in a seedy neighborhood, this place really didn't seem like it belonged. \n\nAll in all, I thought it was okay and probably wouldn't go back again for a while.", "author": "Penny Y."}

The food may come off almost as bland to us Americans, as it did at first to me.  However, I gradually found my linguini to be flavorful, actually, and very light.  My sister appreciated her ravioli for its authenticity, as it reminded her of some of the meals she's had in Italy.  Neither of the meals were not too greasy or \"Americanized,\" and unlike many other restuarant foods that leave me thirsty and tired, I actually came out feeling healthy and happy.  \n\nOur waiter, who probably was the owner or the manager, was very kind and let us dine before the restaurant opened.  His thick Italian accent and mannerisms matched the decor of the place.  The place was nicely decorated without giving off a snooty vibe. \n\nThis restaurant definitely had what I would imagine to be the ambience and the flavors of Italy.

With plenty of candlelit tables scattered throughout the dining room and the back wall fully racked with rows and rows of wine, I was impressed with SF for having such an upscale looking restaurant without the upscale prices. \n\nThe management did a wonderful job of accommodating our large party of 16. They tried their best to fit us all onto one elongated table, but it surely would've been an uncomfortable arrangement being all squished in the back corner. We're were satisfied with our 2 tables back to back to each other. Service was on point. The waiters were all friendly and helpful and stayed on top of making sure our glasses were constantly filled. \n\nI was debating between the risotto with calamari, scallops, topped with ink sauce & the seabass stuffed ravioli with a lobster reduction. The thought of \"ink sauce\" reminded me of Mario Kart, so that turned me away and ultimately persuaded me to go with the ravioli...and it did not disappoint! The sauce was delightful and nicely topped off with bits and pieces of lobster meat. Each bite of the seabass stuffed ravioli was more gratifying than the last as the homemade pasta instantly melted in my mouth. However, I couldn't say the same for my friend's salmon filet with saffron sauce. I sampled a tiny bite and noticed the saffron gave the top portion of the salmon quite a kick, but the meaty part of filet was completely bland. Another surprise was that our waiter did not ask how we wanted our flet mignon cooked when he took our order. Typically, I would assume the meat to be cooked medium as a general standard, but the steak came out well-done! Oh what a delicate tender slab of meat ruined from being overcooked. There should be a law that filet mignons cannot be cooked above medium...\n\nThe only issue we had last night was that it took foreverrrrr and a daaaay for our food to come out and when it finally arrived, it wasn't piping hot. I believe that having so many patrons in our party affected the quality of our food, and though we can't really blame the chefs in the back of the house, I still wish the wait wasn't so long. Regardless, I'd be willing to come back and give them another try, but definitely with a much smaller party. \n\nMy rating is actually 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because they totally won me over with my entree and the sparkling red wine.", "author": "Michelle W."}

The pasta with mushrooms that I got was very good, but it was too rich for my taste.  That said, most cream-based pasta sauces are too rich for me and I should have known better.  And man, they definitely do not skimp on the mushrooms!   \n\nMy husband's ravioli (just the plain ravioli) were delicious.  The tomato sauce was spot on - not too sweet, not overcooked, and the right amount of fresh basil.  \n\nOur company was very pleased with their orders. I'm not exactly sure what they got (one was fish?), but they liked it so much that they plan on coming back up to SF from Sunnyvale just to go here for dinner. \n\nFor desert, we ordered the coffee one. I think it has \"caffe\" in the title.  It is simply ice cream with coffee.  I didn't realize that.  The coffee was excellent and the ice cream was high quality.  But $8?  Please.\n\nSpeaking of prices, I was a little annoyed that the website menu didn't include the prices.  Our non-meat pasta dishes were in the teens ($14 and $17, I think), and the dishes that included fish etc could range up into the 20s.  Deserts ranged from $7-9.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-06-23", "description": "When I first saw it, this restaurant menu really reminded me of some places in Piemonte or Liguria: typical antipasti from the centre/north of Italy, separate lists for meat/vegetable or sea-oriented pasta's, many different options for meat and fish. I definitely have a soft-spot for places like Briciola (... let's call it homesickness) and I was eager to try it out.  Mission finally accomplished with my gf and another 100% Italian couple.  Going to the point, here follows a summary of our culinary journey.\n\nWe start like savages, wildly attacking the superb black olives pat\u00e8 with the (averagely good) bread. \n\nAppetizers:\n0- damn, I forgot to mention I'm a Yelper so I missed the bonus :-( \n1- bruschette with tomatoes (average, no garlic flavour at all, few tomatoes), red and yellow peppers (my fellow diners said it was good, I didn't taste it, I hate sweet peppers), eggplant and zucchini (disappointing, the vinegar flavour was too dominant and actually I found it completely out of place).\n2-  Sfogliatine con gamberi e asparagi: this delicious warm puff pastry with a cheesy filling made me feel as I was back in Torino ...\n\nMain courses:\n1- Gnocchi al sughetto d'anatra: this plate was rather weak. Both the sauce and especially the pasta were simply bland.\n2- Ravioli di cernia: good sauce, good filled pasta but a bit overcooked (I suspect that this dish was ready much earlier than it was served to me ... what a shame).\n3-Farfalle con salmone: my friend did not like them at all, saying that they were tasteless (I cannot confirm it, since I haven't sampled them).\n4-Coniglio in umido con polenta: awesome presentation, excellent tomato based sauce, good overall taste but my other friend had some small reservations on the rabbit.  Personally, I wish I had tasted such a wonder :-(\n\nNo dessert this time, since we were late for the cinema.\n\nThe service was flawless and everybody was very friendly. In particular, I appreciated the enthusiasm of the owner when I told him that I was from Torino. He then behaved like the Holy Inquisition asking me from where I was exactly, from what street ... kind of cute after all! In fact, the guy comes from Grugliasco which is a small town in the suburbs of Torino. Ehi, that was great: meeting an almost neighbour on the other side of the Ocean!\n\nI definitely enjoyed the overall experience and I would be back, but \nwhat we got this time was just a little above average, while we would have expected it to be absolutely top notch. \n\n3 and 1/2 for now", "author": "Andrea L."}

We were in the mood for Italian, and this was only 8 blocks from my pad.\n\nThe ambiance is really nice- pleasing decor with high ceilings and open space.  The service was friendly and attentive.  The pricing was par with comparable restaurants. The food was outstanding. \n\nOur four course meal included:\n\nCesare Salad- Delicious dressing, crisp lettuce, tasty parmesean.  \n\nFrittura di calamari - The fried calamari was very tender, flavorful, and served with tasty marinara dipping sauce.  \n\nFiletto con fonduta al tartufo- the filet mignon with fontina cheese and black truffles was wonderful.  The sauce was lighter than I expected from a cheese sauce and didn't leave me feeling weighed down.  The roasted veggies and potatoes on the side were also very flavorful and fresh.\n\nCaciucco di viareggio- This cioppino-like dish was amazing.  The broth was extremely flavorful yet not too heavy.  The broth was lighter than the tomato based cioppino broth, and the dish was loaded with fresh seafood:  crab, calamari, mussels, clams, shrimp, salmon and swordfish.  There was so much we actually left some behind to leave room for dessert.  This was hands down the best dish of the night, though I would order every dish we had again.\n\nTiramisu- traditional, good, ample portion.\n\nFragole con gelato- traditional, fresh strawberries, nicely sized portion.\n\nWe're planning on going back soon to try some of the other menu items, though this time around we won't be quite as gluttonous and may make it a one course adventure.", "author": "Michelle M."}

Thank god for Open Table otherwise it never would have been on our radar. \n\nAs for the restaurant, when we walked in we were greeted by the nicest host/waiter. Yes, here one man does it all. \n\nWe started off our meal with a Caesar Salad. I quite enjoyed it as I liked the bitter taste but my wife wasn't too keen on it. I have to admit, the bitterness isn't for everyone. I think next time, I may stick with the Spinach Salad. \n\nWe both were in the mood for pasta (which is homemade by the way) so we stuck with the First Course. I had the Paccheri con salsiccia e rape (sausage and broccoli)  which was prepared to perfection. My wife had the Paccheri con gamberi e broccholi  (shrimp and broccoli)and enjoyed that as well. \n\nFor dessert we shared an order of the Profitterolles. Unless you are hoping to pack a few pounds on, share one order of this most delicious dessert. \n\nBecause the service between our First Course and Dessert was a tad slow, our waiter proactively made nice by giving us each a complimentary glass of Prosecco. It's amazing how far such a nice gesture can go.\n\nFor anyone looking for a nice mid priced Italian meal, keep La Briciola on your short list.", "author": "Steve M."}

The atmosphere is simple but warm and the food is pretty good- the caprise salad we had to start was fresh and good- not the best I've had, but very good for sure. \n\nOur meals didn't wow us- my man had the pesto linguine, which was good but not a huge portion (for $16) and not enough of the fresh green beans and potatoes (which were both very good). I had the halibut, which I was expecting (from the menu) to come with a few more veggies and potatoes, but it was pretty much just the fish in a sauce (but the sauce was really, really tasty). The fish wasn't the best for me- seemed a bit too fishy for halibut (maybe not as fresh as it could have been)? But then again I am very picky with the few fish I do eat. \n\nAlso, this is a little thing but it is an Italian restaurant- the bread they bring out to start, while soft, is not very good- a good homemade rustic Italian would go a long way to set the mood right. \n\nOverall, a nice little addition to the neighborhood but not necessarily something to go out of your way for.", "author": "Kristen L."}

I should have licked the plate.\n\nThe wine list was filled with good value wines.  We were drinking prosecco and barbera from the by the glass menu.  Both were very good.\n\nMinor complaints probably not worth mentioning, but sort of.  The music was too low to be background music.  It was at that volume that keeps dragging you in wondering what instrument, language, song, etc.\n\nThey could use a little better orchestration at the table.  It looks like they are running a really thinly staffed floor.  On the bright side, anyone passing by would fill water or take away dishes.  On the down side, it was sort of chaotic.\n\nSo, welcome to the neighborhood.  We hope you stay a while.  See you soon...", "author": "Stu M."}

All in all, I was pretty disappointed and will not be going back.\n\nTo start off, both my wife and I found it a bit odd that an Italian restaurant would have an appetizer (Fagottino ripieno) that included crepes (French).  We ordered it and it was tasty - probably the highlight of the meal.  I ordered the Halibut as my entree from the 'Second Course' menu and for $22 it was not only a small piece of fish but did not come as advertised with vegetables and roasted potatoes.  The fish was overcooked and had no taste or texture.  The ceramic dish it was served in arrived so hot - I think the fish continued to cook at the table.  \n\nWe also struck out in the wine department, with all three wines (Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Sangiovese).  The Pinot Grigio was over chilled and tasteless.  My wife's Barbera tasted off and after sending it back and getting the Sangiovese - it did not really taste any better,\n\nThe host was pleasant when we entered the restaurant and our waiter was nice but did not come by to check on how we were doing when we received our entrees.  The restaurant was half-full so I'm not sure why service was inattentive.\n\nWe won't be going back to this restaurant but instead will walk another block or so to the Italian restaurant next to where Bong Su used to be (forgetting the name)", "author": "Raul K."}

We decided to do a lot of sharing so we started with the minestrone and the zuppa  ...as well as two appetizers, the assorted cheese plate and the seafood pastry puff.  I'm not a big minestrone fan but my wife absolutely loved it.  I preferred the zuppa, but honestly I could have done without either.  We ordered three main courses: the gnocchi contadina, the ravioli and the grigliato.  I liked the gnocchi (although the table next to us was reaching albout t the gnocchi triage).  The ravioli was delicious, but the star was the grigliato.  The swordfish was phenomenal and the salmon tasted like it had just been pulled out of the bay.  The calimari was good too, but the shrimp was a little mushy.  However, like I mentioned, the swordfish and salmon were just phenomenal and I would definitely order that again.

It was awesome. The staff is friendly and the service was really prompt. On my second visit I had a lunch special of shell pasta in a sausage marinara. The portion was a little small, but that was ok. The pasta was al dente--just right. Service was really friendly and prompt. I really like this place. I'm from Boston so I grew up on Italian.

I am not talking about outside by the door, I am talking about inside by the tables!!! Where is the Health department to close this place down!! that is just unlawful!! and frankly disgusting, to also see the Wait staffs pet the dogs as if not a big deal! gosh!! what happened to H1N1 scare?? what happened to sanitizing!!!! \nNow our food came cold so it was just not appetizing, but I will rate it!! \nNow the food: except the vegetable filled crepe everything else was really bad. Here is the list: \n1) Chick pea soup: red water, with five chickpeas and some ground meat in it, no taste nothing. 0 Star \n2) Salad: mix greens, with couple of tomatoes, average. 1/2 star \n3) Vegetable crepe: the only good food and tasty. you get two of it. 3 stars \n4) Vegetable panini: Cold bun, cold vegetables as if the vegetables were grilled the day before keep in the fridge and now put on the bun, really bad, french fries was OK. 0 star \n5) Veal: Three pieces of veal size of devil eggs, and cold cold vegetables. \nI didn't mind all of these if the service was good, but when we told the waiters that the food is cold, she said oh the panini is suppose to be cold!!!!!!!!!! Excuse me, this maybe your first time, but not mine having a panini!! Then she brought us a side of the vegetables. All she said was oh I told the kitchen!!! AND????? nothing. \nWe got the bill and no discount. I am sorry I don't expected, but when you screw up at least either replace the food or give something. \nAnyway, the dog thing was a total turned off but the food was even worse. \nI am not ever going back there again!!! don't waste your time, money, there are plenty of places for good food, clean environment.

The wine list is great and the BTG list is long on Italian gems, great Verdichio for example. Waiter was excellent, we had a glass of Barbera which was his recommendation but it was cooked a little, he opened a new bottle refreshed our glasses and gave us a half a glass each of prosecco for desert free as an apology for the poor condition of the earlier Barbera, which was a nice gesture and the fresh bottle was excellent anyway.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-12-14", "description": "We are retired & live in Marin County so do not come to SF often but a trip to this restaurant is shorter & less expensive than a 15-20 hour flight, 1-2 days jet lag etc. trip to Italy because we find the food here as authentic Italian and as good and better than many places in Italy. What is is my opinion worth ? I go to Italy at least once per year (my parents, grandparents & many relatives are born in Italy) and a main objective is to enjoy the food-as most people know, it is no place for a diet. \n\nI really appreciate that the principals are entrepreneurs as they did work for a very good restaurant in North Beach before their ventured out on their own and I like people who have the guts to follow their dreams. My immigrant family approximately 75-100 years ago worked many jobs 14-16 hours per day and I really admire LUCIANO who working for a major financial institution 5 days per week, also, with his lovely wife, RHIANNON, work many nights and weekends here. Along with delightful LUCA, another owner, and all the other Italian speaking waiterstaff, treat us and, I noticed, all customers like family. Its location, perhaps, does not make this a prime tourist destination like North Beach or Fishermans' Wharf where probably over 50% are non-repeat customer tourists as many locals don't want to deal with tight parking conditions in the area. I always feel that a successful neighborhood restaurant depends upon repeat customers so the food has to be good. I always notice ample parking here & many times actually find spots on same block on the street.\n\nFor those who have been to Roma in Italia you should recall that many of the restaurants in Piazza Navona, Piazza del Popolo, The Pantheon, along Via Veneto etc. have barkers outside enticing you to come in. Even here in SF's Northbeach you'll find people enticing you to enter. Many of these places are basic tourist traps. If you recall the movie/book etc. of \"Alice in Wonderland\", she enters the Looking  Glass (her mirror) into a Fairytale type environment. Here, at La Briciola, there are double doors to enter and no one enticing you to come in with \"Buon Giorno, Buona Sera\"---this will cordially be said to you here after you enter. Thus, it is not a walk by, spontaneous come in place but a destination point restaurant. This is a restaurant mostly visited by the locals &, I'm sure, recommended, or should be, to tourists by concierges of upscale hotels. \n\nThe entire idylic setting is like a Trattoria/ Osteria or informal good food \"ristorante\" in a small village in Italia. Look at the website & photos. At the back is an arched room that makes me feel extremely nostalgic as if I were with my family years back in our dining room. The sights of the appetizing various plates of aromatic dishes and the warm and lively Italian atmosphere is the closest thing to being there. \n\nI want to add that for us a good dining experience is even more than the food and the entire well trained staff always make us feel like family and despite the place buzzing busy at times, we are never made to rush as happens in many places when they need turn the tables. Rhiannon, Luciano, Luca & others always return frequently to our table \" Tutto Bene and Tutto a Posto\" (is everthing OK ?) and also chatting with us. Without a reservation one night, we were still graciously accomodated and allowed to sit and wait at the lovely bar setting---it was so delightful, we ate at the bar & turned frequently enjoying watching the very proficient & friendly owners also assist the waiters when needed and walk the floor like orchestra leaders directing the musicians(waiters, cooks, bus boys etc.) to deliver a stupendous performance.\n\nOn a personal basis, there is a characteristic I especially like about them. When I speak Italian, they respond in Italian. When I speak English, they respond in English. This allows me the dignity of speaking the language of my ancestors, weakly or not, as many times their English is better than my Italian. \n\nWOW---the food, did I forget to tell you about the food !!! Hope nobody is waiting for me to describe some things I like on the menu. I do not find a need to mention specific food items. Many times when I like something I return & order the same thing but here there are so many delectible choices, and my wife always orders something different so we can share, we tried many dishes and look forward to trying more. In short, they were all very tasty . Believe me, I would not have written this recommendation if it were not so. Go for yourselves. See the online menu. It is very creative & enticing & the photos will show some of the atmosphere I've described. Again, want to escape to Italia for an afternoon or evening ? This is the place !!!", "author": "Mando R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-02", "description": "In many ways, this place reminds me of the \"Paradise\" restaurant in Stanley Tucci's film, Big Night: everything felt 'right' about the place, but it was empty.   I had half a mind to peek behind the counter to see if Tony Shalhoub was cursing into my risotto, but the chef wasn't amused when I called him 'Primo'.  \n\nThe food is authentic Italian.  The  menu was elaborate and extensive, with seafood (\"Ocean\") and meat/poultry/vegetarian (\"Earth\") options.  We tried their Vitello alla Valdostana, which translates as veal-wrapped around fatty bacon (spek) and cheese (fontina) - it was similar to a chicken cordon blue, but SO much tastier.  I dubbed it cheesy veal num nums, but the chef wasn't moved to make this name change (I encourage all Yelpers to request this dish by this proper name - strength in numbers, people).  The Agnello al Brunello (i.e., rack of lamb) was cooked to perfection, and met my standard of being good enough to pick up and eat off the bone, lip smacking and finger sucking a must.  Their two steaks (T-bone and filet) were decent, though not of the same quality as the lamb or nums nums.  Their pastas (drool) tasted hand-made and fresh, especially the truffled Tagliatelle and the pecorino gnocchi (more drool).  \n\nFrom the ocean, the grilled squid were cooked to perfection - just beyond al dente and short of chewy.  Only Italians manage to really nail this dish. The halibut, cooked and served in the pan, was heavenly.  At least, I assume so, because my friend (the pig that he is) inhaled it and mopped up the sauce.  Speaking of mopping up, the bread was meh - nothing special.  If they want to kick this place up a notch, they'll cover this detail and pull in some great, crisp crust Italian baguettes (or French - no one will fault them for being un-Italian in this department).\n\nMy only real complaint was that the risotto didn't taste as though it were made just prior to being served - it was not as warm as the other pasta dishes, and they went overboard on the saffron.  Curse you for cutting corners, Primo.   Given that the restaurant was empty except for our table of five, I wondered for a moment whether they'd be able to handle the demands of a full house, and I'm curious to see if my rating holds up when the kitchen is running at capacity.  \n\nThe dessert menu was sparse - profitterolles, tiramisu and flan - and I was a bit surprised not to see more options, especially considering the extensive menu.  We weren't moved to try anything, but judging from the authentic quality of the main courses, I would hope that the desserts stand up to the rest and perhaps less is more.  \n\nThe service was authentic Italian.  Our server's recommendations were helpful, his descriptions were spot on, and his hair gel was glistening.  We were waited on hand and foot, and he aimed to please, which reinforced my image of Stanley Tucci's character, 'Secondo' running the show.   The wine list was decent, and the prices were reasonable.  If it were up to me, I might recommend sizing up the options a bit and adding some small batch or hard to find Italian wines.  As it was, the list was good, but there were no exciting surprises.\n\nThe location is authentic SoMa, meaning the neighborhood isn't one you'd normally frequent were it not for this place (it's practically under the freeway).  You're not likely to loiter around outside waiting for a table, but they've got a quaint beer/wine bar to make up for the fact.  It's only a few blocks from South Park, however, so it's well worth the trek.  The interior is warm, clean, and very inviting.  I might suggest that they dim the lights a bit more as the ambiance would have been kicked up a notch.  All told, this place has the appearance of a gem, and I hope it sees a pick-up in customers.  It certainly enhances the neighborhood, and I hope the neighborhood can hold onto it.", "author": "Nils E."}

We were actually quite disappointed from the Wine exhibition at the SFMOMA (really horrible...) and definitely needed a good dinner to cheer us up! Finding the place wasn't that hard, although the neighbourhood is somewhat dodgy. We got there pretty early, and the restaurant was still almost empty. The atmosphere there is really classy and elegant. We got a table in the back of the big room, which was really quiet and very enjoyable I think. \n\nWe ordered a bottle of Sicilian red, which i have to say was nothing special. It was maybe the single minus that night. We shared an Antipasto Misto for appetizer: the Prosciutto was the best part of it, and also the Speck was good, although I'm not such a big fan. \nAs for the entr\u00e9es, I got the T-bone steak, which really tasted amazing, so different from what you get at American Steak Houses and Grills. My friend got the Filetto with black truffle sauce, which he also liked a lot. We also got an espresso and a very good Tiramis\u00f9, creamy and generously poured into espresso as it should be. \n\nA funny group of Italian people joined the same part of the room later on, and it was really funny to overhear their comments on food and wine; btw, they also did not like their (white) wine that much, which really makes me think it's better to avoid ordering wine there: you'll be amazed by the food instead!", "author": "france d."}

We asked our server to combine the salami and artisanal cheese appetizers for the table, and it arrived attractively presented on a wooden board (which is usually how it's done elsewhere but one never knows).

La Briciola, I have mixed feelings about this place. \n\nStarting with the environment, it was cozy, clean, and comfortable. The waiters were friendly and attentive, constantly checking on us and refilling our water. Unfortunately, one of them was a bit incompetent. When he collected our bread plates after appetizers, he left some of the utensils behind. Then when he came back, he only gave some of us dinner knife and fork. I was left with a butter knife and salad fork to eat my entr\u00e9e. I didn't even noticed until my friend asked why my utensils looked different from hers, but I had fish so it didn't require cutting anyway. \n\nService aside, I didn't find their food to be too special. I thought that my Rombo all'isolana (baked halibut~fresh tomato sauce~olives~sliced potatoes) didn't really have much real flavor. I mean I could tell that it was fresh, quality fish. I just was expecting the sauce to have more tomato flavor but it was just salty. With a few tiny pieces of tomato sprinkled on top. The fish, which was roughly 4 ounces, was pretty much the entire dish. I was like...where are my potato slices? They were hiding under my gravy! THAT was how thin they were. In fact, most of them got stuck to the bottom of the dish from the baking process. When I read \"sliced potatoes\", I was really expecting something more substantial but apparently they were only for decorative purposes. Guys, you need to work on the accuracy of your menu descriptions because that totally wasn't what I was expecting.\n\nMy other friend had the Petto di pollo ai porcini (chicken breast~wild porcini mushroom sauce). She said the sauce was good, but I saw her cut the chicken and it looked really rubbery. \n\nTo be fair, their bread was really good. They also had a large selection of wine, but I don't really drink. All the appetizers were great though. We had:\nBruschette assortite (zucchini~eggplant~fresh tomatoes~toasted bread)\nSfogliatine con gamberi e asparagi (puff pastry~asparagus~shrimp~crab reduction) This was my favorite, I should have ordered another one!\nCalamari grigliati (grilled squid~arugula~chick pea pure)\n\nAnd others in my group seemed to enjoy their dishes. They all ordered some type of pasta or ravioli. Hmm, note to self, only ever order pasta from Italian restaurants in the future. So if I ever decide to come back it would be for the appetizers, and I would try something else that is not fish.", "author": "Irene F."}

My wife and I arrived on a Saturday night at about seven (with no reservation) and were seated immediately. So far so good.  Although the restaurant was only about half full, service was slow from the start. Everything took 5-10 minutes too long to come out. My mixed salad was nothing special, but was not bad. My wife liked her Caesar  Salad, but again nothing special. I had the sea bass ravioli in lobster reduction which arrived warm but not hot. The Ravioli was good but the portions were small (perhaps this is why they are so generous bread basket?)\nMy wife's cheese ravioli was unexceptional and not nearly as tasty as what I had ordered.  After we had finished our entrees we waited a good 10-15 minutes for our plates to be clear, despite having made eye contact with our waiter several times; I guess he just did not want to clear our plates. Alas, dessert was unexceptional as well. The desserts looked great but the cream puffs I ordered lacked any real flavor ( I immediately regretted blowing the calories.) Finally, price point was good. Dinner for two with drinks totaled about 95 dollars. I might be convinced to give this place another try, though I left unsatisfied.", "author": "Eric R."}

A few of my friends were in town visiting on a Friday night and wanted to have dinner in my neighborhood, so I wanted to take them somewhere they'd be impressed by but I also wanted to try somewhere new.  I asked my next door neighbor for recommendations and he told me about La Briciola.  His exact words were (via text): \"Great Italian.  Cozy atmosphere.\"  Sounded good to me.  \n\nWe were a group of seven and showed up around 8:30 p.m. without reservations.  The restaurant was about half full and we were seated right away by the very friendly Italian host/waiter.  This was of course immediately impressive since most places on a Friday night at that time have a long wait.  But I think the fact that the restaurant wasn't full was due only to it's location.\n\nThe server was friendly and accommodating throughout the entire meal.  He brought us menus right away, and was always available when we needed him.  We spent more time talking than looking at the menu at first, so it was a while before we even ordered drinks, but the server was patient and we were never rushed.  He also made an excellent wine recommendations (a bottle of Pino Bianco and later glasses of Pino Grigio).\n\nThe food was delicious!  We ordered the arugula salad, cheese gnocchi, linguine with clams, seabass and lobster raviolis, and risotto with calamari, scallops, and ink sauce (there were a few other dishes but these are the ones I actually tasted).  There was not a bad dish among them.  I particularly liked the seabass and lobster raviolis and the squid ink risotto.  The seafood was flavorful and well-cooked, and nothing was too salty.  The sauces were rich and creamy.  I also shared the tiramisu with a friend, which the server told us is homemade and was fluffy and tasty (I probably could have ordered my own...).  \n\nSuccess!  Everyone was impressed, and I now know of a great Italian restaurant in my neighborhood.  We really got the whole package--excellent service and delicious food.  The restaurant is small and the lighting is low, so the ambiance is comfortable and relaxing (and would be perfect for a date, I saw several in progress around our table).  I will definitely go back here again whenever I get the chance.", "author": "Meredith H."}

Here's my experience...we made reservations for four and then had to call ahead with a fifth when my in-laws brought their three year old grandson. The restaurant was very accomodating and helpful and adding an extra person was no problem. We shared an order of the assorted bruschetta - pretty good and a little different including a mushroom based bruschetta. I would have liked the toast to come out a little toastier though. We ordered the large assorted meats and thoroughly enjoyed them. Their minestrone was one of the better I have tried. My husband ordered the pesto which we thought was only so-so (a little stingy on the pesto sauce and they put potatoes and green beans in it which was a little weird). We've been to the Cinque Terra in Italy where this dish is popular and didn't see anything prepared like that. I ordered the gnocchi which was very good if a little on the heavy side - if you like creamy cheese sauce than you will definitely like it. We asked for a little side of meats for the little one and I think they brought it out at no charge and it kept him mostly happy through the meal. The service was definitely on the slower side - we waited a long time between our soup and our entrees (perhaps that was authentic and reminiscent of Italy!). I wouldn't dine here if you are in a hurry. The dessert was decent - an ice cream puff with chocolate. \n\nThis restaurant was walking distance from my sister's place so I would likely go back if I am in the area but probably wouldn't make a special trip of it.", "author": "Shannon W."}

The atmosphere is cute (good for dates), but fill up on the free bread because the meal might not satisfy.  Maybe if I had spent more money I would have enjoyed my meal more?", "author": "Britany F."}

Candles, white tablecloths and white cloth napkins calmed me instantly. This weeknight was not extremely busy, but there were a few other tables filled with diners. That is a better sign that the empties Laine and I have experienced at times in the past. Upon my friend's suggestion, we let the waiter know who had sent us and this was followed by delivery of Tagliere di Salumi, coppa spek prosciutto, salami, olives and marinated vegetables. Full of flavor and a nice way to begin the meal, we were very appreciative of the gesture. As I am steering away from meat, I concentrated on the marinated vegetables and olivees and they were phenomenal. The fresh bread and olive oil also met my expectations for fine Italian dining. Bread is a good meter by which to judge a restaurant. The menu has a lot of options, many pastas such as, ravioli, gnocci, linguine and many more with wonderful sounding variations such as pesto, string beans and potatoes or sausage and broccoli rabe. I was having a very hard time deciding, but after pondering and asking Alessandro's opinion (our friendly, very pleasant waiter), I ordered the Ravioli di Cernia, seabass filled ravioli with a lobster reduction. Upon its arrival, it also had baby prawns in the lobster reduction. Can you say oh my! Honestly, this was one of the most interesting pasta dishes I have ever consumed and what taste. Very different and all of the flavors complimented each other like nothing I could have imagined. The portion was generous and I was happy as a clam. Maryland ordered the Agnello al Brunello, the rack of lamb, green peppercorn and Brunello red wine eduction. Her plate was completely filled with succulent-looking meat and vegetables. She was excited and very pleased with her selection as well. Because we love dessert, we had to end with something dolce and the Profitterolles alla vanilla, pastry puffs with vanilla ice cream and chocolate had our name written all over them. This is such a wonderfully\npresented and fun dessert and Briciola did not disappoint. We were fully satisfied and so glad my friend had given us this wonderful suggestions. Prices are reasonable for fine dining and Briciola specializes in Tuscan and Piedmontese cuisine. I will definitely visit Briciola again.\n\n~Alex", "author": "See T."}

When I asked him, he gave a nothing description of them and even thought the swiss cheese was a parmesan cheese!!   It was shameful.  The restaurant is pretty, but that is all it has going for it.  We had to wait forever for our main meal to come - by that point, we were barely hungry because if you wait long enough, your body just assumes you're done.

Service and ambiance was excellent, and equally matched by the food.  We had the warm seafood salad as an appetizer and then a gnocci lamb dish as well as a seafood ravioli for the main dishes.. All were excellent.   We got to chatting with our waiter and learned he was the owner as well. It was very obvious he took great pride in his restaurant and it showed, from the food all the way to the bus-boy service. Would definitely recommend it.", "author": "tom m."}

They brought us complimentary peach cider for a much deserved toast and were very accommodating to our party. The was equally as impressive. I got the penne pasticciate al rag\u00fa and it was delicious! I will definitely come back soon.", "author": "Claire G."}

Not only was the food outstanding but the staff there was so nice and accommodating and the prices were beyond reasonable. They have a great selection of wines and entrees. My guests especially liked the puff pastry with asparagus and shrimp appetizer and the lamb ragu. The food is prepared perfectly and the interior design is inviting. There is plenty of parking around although the block where the restaurant is located is somewhat dirty and noisy due to traffic- but hey, it's city living. I highly recommend this place for lunch, dinner or a private function. You will not be disappointed!!", "author": "Christine S."}

While there is no kids menu, the waiters were very accommodating with custom plates of pasta and sauce.  Food was tasty, waiters were attentive, prices are fair.  Restaurant is small, quaint and elegant.  Will definitely go again.", "author": "Kristen V."}

Also, very excited that the lunch menu is very affordable for such a charming, sit-down place. The food I've ordered has been nice but not remarkable. The bucatini amatriciana has some uncalled-for herb in it, and the veggie sandwich could take some tips from Caffe Centro down the street. But, hey, the place just opened, and I'm happy to try La Briciola every coupla weeks to see how it evolves.", "author": "Midori S."}

Both were delicious and had a lot of flavor.  The halibut was little over salted and the bread was just adequate -- otherwise this would place would get 5 stars.

Not your typical SoMa slick restaurant but one that would be better found in North Beach. Service was very good...attentive and good suggestions when asked. Food is not overly complex or edgy...very traditional and well put together. Everything tried by my date and I were very tasty..zuppa, carpaccio, risotto, etc. And the clincher for us was that we were able to make reservations on OpenTable about 45 minutes before we arrived. Lucky for us we nabbed one of the few remaining tables. Will definitely go back again when looking for authentic Italian food at very good prices.", "author": "michael N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-09-28", "description": "My husband said his food was great, mine was only OK.  But my main complaint was this: they deliberately prop open the restaurant's doors so that all the traffic noise, including motorcycles and trucks and other really loud, conversation-killing street noises, blast into the restaurant and kill any hope of a nice atmosphere or a pleasant evening.  I was meeting friends I hadn't seen in years, but couldn't really catch up because of this completely unnecessary traffic noise.  I don't understand.  You would think that restarauteurs would understand that one of the things they're providing is a venue for people to meet and talk to each other.", "author": "Victoria P."}
