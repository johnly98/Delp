And this is why we don't go here...\n\nI'll give this place a positive on the decor and ambiance. Pretty different vibe in sf, and typically less crowded, which is nice. That's essentially where the positives end. \n\nBar service. I'd recommend having more than 1 bartender working at 10pm on a Saturday night. Call it business insights, call it common sense, this is just plain wrong. Waited 12+ mins to order from a reasonably/minimally occupied bar to order 4 beers. Ok, not ideal, but I can deal. \n\nHere's where I draw the line: Customer service. \n\nTowards the end of our time at the bar, around 11pm while we were heading to a different bar, my girlfriend starts to feel sick (food poisoning we later found out). She heads to the bathroom to throw up. \n\nI crack open the door a few minutes later to check on her, since our friends just left for the next bar. I'm greeted by the same unfriendly bartender who served me earlier, explaining to me that she's \"watching over my gf\", who clearly is sick in one of the stalls with no help while this bartender is putting on making on the other side of the bathroom. Can I come in to check on her or help while there's no other patrons in the bathroom? NO. I'm not allowed, as I clearly hold my girlfriend's purse (not an intruder, clearly only trying to help my girlfriend).\n\n2 seconds later, older lady who works at the bar barges in while I'm slightly holding open the women's bathroom door. Rudely asks me to leave. Ok, I relinquish the door duties, hoping that my girlfriend is ok inside. 2 additional seconds later, a bartender fellow comes up asking what's going on. Immediately eyeballs me, without hesitation, asks for my ID. Now, let me explain, I am 2 weeks from my 30th birthday and look nowhere near resembling a college sophomore. I explain to the fellow that I'm likely older than him (he looks 24), but I oblige and show him my ID. Results in escalated, rude tone, and begins asking a barrage of additional clarification questions about why I'm waiting for my girlfriend and what's going on. I can't recall the details of the exchange, but out of my group of friends, I'm the passive person, and in this instance, he had my blood boiling. \n\nMy girlfriend proceeded to handle things herself OK in the bathroom, and we left immediately thereafter. This was one of the most chill dinner nights I've had with friends in SF in the last few months, and I was really surprised at the direct, rude interactions with multiple staff of the bar. Not once did any of the 3 staff even simply ask if she was OK, or how they could help. \n\nLong story short, there is a clear and karmic reason that this place is consistently not crowded, not popular, and very likely hemorrhaging money. I do not recommend supporting their business based on morals and ethics.", "author": "Kyle F."}

I particularly liked the fact that the patrons were all different ages. From 20's to young professionals in their 30's to 50 year olds, everyone was getting their drink on. Aside from the main bar area, they had big round tables and booths you could sit in. They looked pretty comfortable. We stayed at the bar to people watch. I only drank beer, so I can't really comment on how well they mix drinks, but I do know if you want a glass of wine, this is not the place to come. My friend wanted a glass of white wine and there was only one Chardonnay option for $12.

Left my card and sat down.  When I returned to close out my card and move on 25 min later, I was presented with a bill for $69, and this is after the bartender 'kindly' comp'd two drinks 'because my tab was so high'.  WTF?!? One round, $69+ for three people??  'Please show me my tab, you must have had someone else put drinks on it.'  Then it gets ugly, 'see the Mexican guy over there?  He just threw out all the paperwork, so there is none to show you'  Seriously??  Then I got a bunch of lies and  false and contradictory statements from the bartender, who finished by insulting me, told me it was my fault and too bad.  The door guy, Rick, while kind was inept and had no information or authority to help in any fashion, even though he seemed to believe he could.  Didn't even have a good phone number to call a manager or owner about this whole issue.  I work in and around the nightlife industry here in the City, and call multiple owners both friends and business associates.  Stunned that this would happen at any place, but to hear the doorman brag about the 'reputation' of this quality establishment, you would think that they would have had some other way to deal with these problems.  No, they don't.  I literally feel like this girl reached into my pocket and stole from me, and her response was the worst, most cliche'd 'Marina girl' response you could imagine.  Entitled, snotty, flat out lied, and then went back to drinking shots and flirting with the guys at the end of the bar.  I am only happy they are not my employees.  Worst. Bar. Ever.

It has a very attractive ambiance and since most people can't seem to remember the name I'm often describing it as either: \"the plush red bar\" or \"fern bar.\"  \n\nOn week nights it's one of the true lounges in the city; easy to get a drink with friends and hear each other talk.  The bartenders are friendly and sweet enough to turn down the music to a reasonable volume (which elsewhere seems to be the cardinal sin of drinking in SF).   Weekends the place tries to transform into a club and I don't find it to be as consistently enjoyable, but if that's your thing... go for it.\n\nOn my last visit (random Monday night) the bartender drawled out a very friendly \"what can I get you darlin'?\" every time I approached and it was thoroughly charming.  She also mixed up a killer Red Headed Slut for my buddy who'd just turned 21.\n\nSo, keeping in mind that I really like this place the other reviewers do have some legitimate complaints which I offer here as constructive criticism (fix these and the place would rock):  \n\n1)  the bar is schizophrenic about credit cards... sometimes they'll let you charge one, sometimes you can give one but only to hold a tab you'll have to close with cash... sometimes they just blink at you.  It's not the mission... you should take credit. \n\n2)  The place is a bit pricey compared to its neighbors.  I actually think well drinks are sometimes accidentally charged as shelf drinks exacerbating this, but haven't had that issue with beer.  \n\n3) Minor nitpick: the bar is starting to show its age.  Some of the seating could use attention (new upholster or more stuffing).\n\nEnjoy!", "author": "David K."}

They are hard as F*ing rocks. You look at them and think, oh yeah, come to mama...I want to relax and throw back my cocktails in the comfort of your cushions. In actuality, they're so uncomfortable that you almost debate sitting on the ground instead.\n\n2) Three words: Cash. Only. Bar. I'm sorry but that is CRAP. The last time I was in and handed over my credit card, the server directed me to the cash machine in the back. So, what you're telling me is that I have to get raped with non-ATM fees because you're bar can't come in to the 21st century? No thank you and good day.", "author": "Julia N."}

Now normally I would say at my age with wiser adage I wouldn't do anything like what we were about to instigate, but he did pass out in a fraternity house, so it was more like his fault than ours.  Well...anyway, we drew a bunch of penises on his face (this was at like 4pm) and he carried them allllllll night long.\n\nWhile we were at Royal Oak, we met up with some of my friends and they all saw the drawings on his face and laughing discreetly.  All of my friends, strangers at the bar, the bartenders were all grabbing him for pictures.  One point during the night, he turns to me and goes \"Man your friends are all sooooo nice!\"  \"Yeah they are\" I replied...hahaha\n\nFinally after last call, they turn the lights on while he was at the bar.  Since the back of the bar and the retaining shelves are all mirrors, he finally discovered we mutilated his face with a sharpie and fiiiiiiinally went and washed them off.  Man, he carried penises on his face for about 10 hours...\n\nWell I guess this is a review about the bar; it's cool, casual, fun.  Not divey but definitely not too shi-shi.

My wife wore a red dress that looked oh so yummy during her bachelorette party years back and from the stories I heard, well lets just say you wouldn't bring it up during Sunday school.  \n\nNo doubt the color red makes people take notice whether some girl is wearing it on her tight body, it's a stop sign, a red Ferrari, or a severely injured person.   \n\nBack in college a few buddies and I went to the local bar to pick up some hotties.  I was a complete dork so basically I was a wing man trying to talk up the less attractive birds (or cows might be more appropriate) while my buddies went up to bat hoping to hit a home run.  One time, my friend landed this Ivanka Trump look alike.  Since my friend was obviously thinking with his penis, his strategy was to get her liquored up (original one there huh?).  \n\nSo she's sucking down strawberry margaritas like a vacuum cleaner.  I try telling the guy she's clearly way too wasted.  Him thinking with his penis thinks it's a no brainer.  So we end up in said friend's car and lets just say we hear the infamous drawl \"uhhhhh I don't feel so good\" from this cat.  Next thing my buddy's interior turns from white to red as a sea of half digested strawberry margarita mix finds its way back to earth looking not nearly as good when it first went down.  So the saying goes, red brings trouble.  \n\nThe Royal Oak has a very red interior.  It looks cool, seems cool but something is clearly missing.  It's true that the bathroom smelled worse than 10 day old piss and yes it's true the drinks are expensive.   But red is supposed to give you a feeling of naughtiness, trouble, passion ... something to make the heart go bump.  I feel none of these here ... zero excitement.  \n\nMaybe it's the music, the scene, the bathroom, the lifelessness of the bartnender or the DNA infested couches.

Sofas, chairs, large round tables or the bar.  Just come on in, get a drink and chill.\n\nThe downside is the drinks are really overpriced, the furniture is a bit cheap and uncomfortable for long sit-downs, no real wine selection - they're really focused on the beer and spirits - and the bar ran out of Kahlua (!?!?) while mixing a drink for me!

The music is upbeat and fun, although the bar isn't set up for dancing. The people who hang out there seem receptive to talking and socializing - and since I enjoy meeting new people when I go out, this is a big plus. The biggest drawback is that the bar is cash only - there's an ATM by the bathrooms, but if you don't want to pay ATM fees, make sure to bring cash.", "author": "Randi W."}

I was then told i was color blind because everything was red.  Although i still think it was pink.  Anyway this place is cute, with interesting lighting (the pink i was talking about) and very... i want to say it has an era theme, but which era?  I don't know.  This is something i'm not too familiar with.  Marianne said maybe the 30's... i just don't know.  You could say something is from the 70's and i'd be like... really?  But enough with my colorblindness and lack of era knowledge.   \n\nThe best part of the night was the girl bartender.  She didn't know how to make the simplest drinks.   When ordering drinks confusion just flooded her face.  So we started off with some beers... not too hard considering we ordered the ones on tap.  However, she did end up spraying beer all over one of our friends.   Then we got to the girly drinks like midori sour.  She got that.  Next, it was my turn and i asked for a sidecar.  Hmmm... \"is that like a manhattan but with brandy?\"  Ummmm... NO!!  So then she looks it up in this book... and tells me... uhhh we don't have brandy!  So i ordered a vodka martini straight up, which i got for free because she couldn't make me a sidecar.  OK fine she made up for it.   Our second round of drinks, confused the poor girl again.  This time i talked to the guy bartender.  I got another martini but Marianne got a chambord sour.  Now, this drink is pretty simple.  One should know how to make this if bartending is their occupation.  Sadly, the guy asked me if that was just chambord and sweet n sour, which i confirmed.  Instead of him making the drink, the girl bartender was given the task of doing it while he made my martini.   Watching her was priceless as she walked back and forth behind the bar looking for chambord which was sitting in plain view.  It wasn't that she didn't see the bottle but she didn't know what chambord was.  I loved it!  Her face was that of bewilderment.  She had to ask the guy what the chambord bottle looked like after 3 min. of searching.  \n\nThe lounge was laid back, not too crowded and was quite comfortable.  Some of the furniture was a little old and felt wobbly.  I was afraid that a few of the chairs wouldn't be able to support me.  I'm not even a cow and i was afraid so that should tell you something.  \n\nOverall it was a cool place, bad furniture, and sad bartenders.

She had the WORST attitude I have ever come across. I took one sip of a rum and coke that I just paid for which was gross and I politely asked if I could swap it for something else instead. She just threw away the drink and walked off. After realizing she wasn't coming back (and it wasn't cos she was busy cos there was 2 other people in the whole bar) she told me I couldn't have an alternative drink because she poured it right and that I should have ordered something I liked. She was the rudest, bitchiest most unprofessional bartender EVER. She should be FIRED!!! I will never step foot inside here again.", "author": "c m."}

And for the ultra lazy, they even have a waitress that will take drink orders and you don't even have to get up to get your drinks.

Some friends wanted to meet here last night, and even though this isn't my kind of bar I decided to tag along anyway.  So I get there with another friend, walk up to the bar, and order a Hendricks and tonic for myself and my friend, handing a $20 to the attractive female bartender in the process.  I get back two drinks and no change.  It's at this point that I discover that this place is charging $10 for a gin & tonic!  I'm sorry, but this joint is nowhere NEAR cool enough to charge that for a drink, hot bartender or no.  It'd be a decent bar were the drink prices lower, but even then it wouldn't be anything worth seeking out.
