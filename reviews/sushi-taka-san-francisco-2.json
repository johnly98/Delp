The outside is nothing to look at but the portions are generous, the fish fresh, and the staff is efficient and friendly. \n\nThe line can look pretty long, but it goes pretty fast. If you come 30 mins before noon or even after, the line dies down. There isn't any real seating inside so this place is more of a carry out joint. \n\nThey have a newer updated menu with a few additions than online. I ordered their Deluxe bowl with brown rice. The box doesn't look like much, but when you pick it up, it definitely has some weight to it. The cuts are really decent and fresh.

The bowl comes with unagi, roe, seaweed salad, corn, imitation crab, and sushi rice. \n\nThe restaurant is small and really only a storefront, so there is usually a line out the door, which means go early!

Thankfully I caught the early beginning of the lunch rush. When it comes to long lines, there are two possibilities: it's overhyped because of some IG-worthy item or it's actually good. I'm relieved to say it's the latter (no disrespect to the IG users out there, I love me some snazzy food pics!)\n\nThe folks at this joint are experienced at handling hungry hippos like myself. I ordered and got my food in a timely manner - points for competence and efficiency! Daily special ran me $10 flat and when I checked in on Yelp, I got myself free miso soup and edamame - apparently these items aren't included in a daily special but are in the regular menu. If you punch in your number, you get a digital stamp card so that's an extra perk for you frequent diners out there. \n\nQuality of fish was fresh and tasty, minus one piece that was a teensy but fishy. The daily special had salmon and spicy tuna poke with crab salad, seaweed salad, and corn on brown rice. The poke was actual marinated fish, seasoned and all, the way it's supposed to be made. The portion appeared small at first, but I found myself struggling to finish it 3/4 of the way in and I'm a fatkid who usually devours all my food!

The burritos are also pretty interesting; I'm not a huge fan, but I'll get it once in a while.\n\nGet ten meals and on your next one, save $10. The app once failed and a person took my name and number down to later apply the ten stamps to my account. I've also seen it happen a few weeks ago to another person. I wouldn't trust them to apply those points to your account, since when I stopped by again a few weeks later, I was still at zero and it was awkward...\n\nMEALPAL comments:\nDefinitely one of my favorites on MealPal.

I think I come here about once a week (!!) with my coworkers to pick up lunch. I mainly get some version of the poke bowls, but I've also tried the cooked unagi bowl (which was good, but not my favourite). I prefer to take my lunch order to-go and eat it more comfortably in a park nearby or back at the office. However, they do have a small seating area outside if you need a place to stay. (I've only stayed to eat lunch there once, which was fine, but it was a busy street with lots of cars and people, so it wasn't very peaceful). Usually when I come to Sushi Taka during lunch rush hour, there's a line out the door and around the corner. Luckily, they participate in a lot of pickup (Postmates, Ritual, etc.) and delivery (Postmates, Grubhub, etc.) programs if you're more time constrained; I usually use pickup and don't need to wait in line, which is fab! Sushi Taka (despite it being a bit of a walk for me) is definitely one of my favourite lunch places, and I'm sure I'll be back soon for more :)", "author": "Bianca C."}

Being just a short distance from work, it was an easy go-to. Not gonna lie-I was wrapped up in the whole sushi burrito thing for a while, lol. \n\nThis place has expanded their menu, offering more than just the few choices of the sushi burritos and bowls from the previous menu. (It doesn't look like the entire menu is listed for the Order Pickup on here, so you will have to order there for the other options). They have newly-added bases for you to choose (white/brown rice, mixed greens, ramen salad). I've tried the Spicy Salmon Burrito, Shrimp Tempura Burrito, the Taka Bowl, Fire Bowl, and the Salmon Poke Bowl which are all fairly consistent in quality; the fish is always fresh and plentiful and the crab salad is flavorful.\n\nThe place is small, but more of a pick-up-your-food-type-of place. Though the line is often out the door, the service is quick- I am out the door shortly after ordering at the counter (in my experiences, at least). Solid sushi burrito/poke spot!

I would say we get it probably once a week because it's that good! The line goes super quick and there aren't a ton of options to choose from so it becomes pretty easy to order.\n\nFood: I always opt for the Salmon Poke Bowl with white rice. I absolutely love salmon poke and they do a good job of not over complicating their poke bowls. The majority of their bowls come with white/brown rice, seaweed salad, and crab with a some of the bowls mixing it up here and there. Unlike other poke bowls, there isn't much room for customization but sometimes simpler is better.Their salmon is already dressed in some sort of shoyu based sauce. The fish taste super fresh and I love the salmon flavor that comes out. A huge plus is that with every bowl you order, they give you a FREE miso soup and little packet of edamame. \n\nTip: If you enjoy Sushi Taka as much as I do, be sure to input your phone number into their rewards system.

It is located on California & Kearny which is like the end of FiDi and start of Chinatown, so it ended up being quite a walk from my office. At the peak lunch hour there was a huge line almost 15 people deep which meant it was definitely popular. Unfortunately the line moved very slowly and it took almost 15 minutes for my turn to order. The menu here is rice bowls and sushi burritos. I decided to get the Fire Bowl ($9.66). The gentleman behind the counter asked if I wanted miso soup and not knowing that it comes free with the Fire Bowl, I declined. \n\nAs per the menu the Fire bowl consists of fresh Salmon, spicy Tuna, spicy tobiko, egg crepe, mixed greens, seaweed Salad and spicy mayo. What I got contained all elements. It also tasted good. Everything seemed to be fresh and even the rice was of a decent quality. As I liked what I got I came back after a couple of days. After enduring the same long slow moving line, this time I decided to get the Taka Bowl ($10.58) which as per the menu consists of salmon poke, spicy tuna, crab salad, spicy tobiko, egg crepe, avocado, mixed greens and seaweed salad. This time I said yes I do want miso soup and got a small container with miso soup along with my Taka Bowl. The Taka Bowl was also good. The only thing that I didn't like was the imitation crab salad so I'd drop that the next time, but that is more of a personal choice. The hot miso soup was average but a welcome addition for a cold day.\n\nPrice wise most of their items are below the $12 mark which is considered good for the area. Quality is also good for the price. Service is slow. They need to speed up as standing outside in the cold is not fun and they should simply provide the miso soup to everyone rather than ask each person individually. Overall there are some rough edges but this is a solid place to get a decent sushi bowl at a reasonable price in FiDi.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

It was seasoned in soy sauce so the fish taste wasn't quite there but hey, quality fish. The only qualm I had was that the very middle of the fish was still slightly frozen. At first glance, the portion looked on the smaller side, but was actually pretty decent for $11.50. The egg was actually layered and pretty good. Felt like the imitation crab salad took up a bit more of the bowl than I'd have liked and was really salty. Seaweed salad was more sour than I've had...think it may have been on its way to being bad :(. Still though. SALMON. 4.5/5.\n\nThe unagi bowl was a bit more standard. The same amount of fish (or even a bit more) than what your average sushi restaurant would give you for ~$5 less in price ($11.50 here vs. $16+ at most spots). Unagi wasn't bad but I like it more smoky. 3.5/5.\n\nI've had a couple of the other items since-- spicy tuna is pretty standard, the scallops they had were also tasty.

They offer bowls and sushi burritos; each time I've come here I've gotten a bowl because I tend to get messy with the burritos. \n\nI've tried their fire bowl (like a poke bowl with spicy tuna, salmon, tobiko, seaweed salad, salad, egg crepe) and their unagi bowl. Both are great options and are REALLY filling. All dishes come with edamame and miso soup on the side! You also get a choice of brown or white rice as a base. All their fish here is so fresh and they give huge chunks! I was surprised when I came here today and was served big blocks of salmon. And their unagi is smothered in that delicious sauce.. mmmm. Each bowl ranges from $9-$12 and they're good portions!\n\nThis place seems really popular as well; I've always seen a line out the door curving along the sidewalk.

Picture on MealPal showed seaweed salad, and another MealPal reviewer mentioned she got seaweed salad and tamago. The cabbage and carrots are clearly cheap fillers, even though stuff like seaweed salad and corn aren't expensive and would have been much more suitable.\n- Crab salad - typical crab salad, really middle of the road. \n- Rice - mostly okay, some parts mushy. \n- No sauce. :( There was enough flavor but the whole thing was somewhat dry. \n\nVery filling but based on comparisons with other reviews, the MealPal version is clearly not up to the standards of a \"regular\" meal here. 3/5 for taste, with 1 star added for value.", "author": "Alice L."}

I can see why though, the fish is super fresh, and their bowls are so filling!  They're more affordable than Sushiritto and  a little more affordable.  Also, gotta love the 100 health score!  \n\nI came here with a friend after 1PM and there was still a line out the door.  We did get our food fairly quickly though after ordering.  He got the spicy tuna roll ($10.11) and I got the Taka bowl ($10.58).  All orders come with free miso soup.  After getting our orders we sat outside and enjoyed the warm day with our fresh fish at the TransAmerica building.  The spicy tuna roll came rolled up with spicy tuna, crab salad, avocado, radish, cucumber and potato chips.  My taka bowl came with slices of salmon, spicy tuna, crab salad, egg crepe shreds, avocado, seaweed salad, and mixed greens.  I also like for the bowls you can choose between brown rice, white rice and mixed greens.  Next time I'll go for the mixed greens or brown rice.  The fish was super fresh, even the salmon, which at a lot of places can taste super fishy.  The spicy tuna was flavorful and didn't pack a ton of heat, but it was difficult to eat with chopsticks in bowl form, better for the roll since it's more contained in that.  Seaweed salad was nicely dressed with the sesame oil, and the crab salad, though imitation crab was light and delightful. Between the three raw fish bowls, only the salmon poke is the only one that doesn't come with spicy tuna.  I'll try to get that one next time, or a sushi burrito.  My friend enjoyed his spicy tuna roll and I got a bite of it as well.  The potato chips was unusual but a nice surprise inside to make it unique and add even more crunchiness to the cucumbers and daikon.  The miso soup doesn't appear to have tofu bits or seaweed in it, it also has a ton of crunchy bubble looking things in it.  I just passed after two sips.  \n\nAll in all, Sushi Taka is a great spot to go for some healthy seafood.  They do offer cooked rolls and bowls too, but, go for the fish for sure!

It's not particularly noticeable, so I would have never thought about dropping by if I hadn't found it on Yelp first. Otherwise, it just kind of blends in amongst the many small grab-and-go places in the area.\n\nThe menu is pretty small, with a few rolls (aka sushi burritos), bowls and sides. If you check in on Yelp, you can redeem a free salad and miso soup, but the rolls and bowls already come with both. They also accept Five Stars cards: 10 roll/bowl purchases gives you 1 free item under $10. Everything comes out to be about $10 with tax, so it's essentially a free meal.\n\nThe rolls are essentially Sushiritto at a cheaper price and smaller size. They're still kind of pricey at $10, but it's FiDi and salads will cost you that much. The size is not super filling but reasonable. Some think Sushi Taka is better, some think Sushiritto is better, but I'm pretty indifferent between the two. Sushi Taka, however, does roll the sushi burritos better in my opinion. They don't fall apart while you're eating them like Sushiritto's do.\n\nThe salad was very simple and fresh. The miso soup came out of a machine, which made me kind of skeptical, but it actually tasted just like any other typical miso soup. There was seaweed in it, but instead of the normal tofu, they had some sort of soggy rice puffs.\n\nService is good here. The staff was very accommodating with my order. I asked for my roll without the wasabi mayo because I find sauces to overpower the real taste of sushi, and I got extra tamago instead of the crab salad. I think my order confused them though because they messed up the first time, but they immediately made a new roll for me, apologizing for the mistake. They make the rolls on the spot, but it's very quick.\n\n====================\n\nI got:\n\n-SUSHI TAKA ROLL ($8.95) - 4/5\n[salmon, tuna, avocado, cucumber, seaweed salad, tobiko, crab salad, tamago, wasabi mayo]\nSolid roll/sushi burrito. Again, I omitted the crab salad and wassabi mayo so my roll was \"lighter\" and less creamy than the standard Sushi Taka Roll, and they also added yellow pickled radish. The tuna was a little off to me, but the salmon was pretty fresh and soft in texture. Overall, solid fish. Not the best I've had, but this isn't a fancy sushi restaurant (or a restaurant at all for that matter), so I was satisfied with the quality. Some other Yelpers have said that they're very generous with the fish, but mine was just an average portion. I liked the slight sweetness from the seaweed salad, tamago and pickled radish, and I was really happy that they weren't super heavy on the rice.", "author": "Jessie L."}

EXCEPT for the fact that I didn't get any kimchi in my bowl, unless it was there and I didn't see it or eat it. That was strange. The bowl looks super full, which is great, but it's a little rice heavy. Regardless, it's still a hearty meal. The fish tasted fresh, unlike some of the reviewers. Maybe I got there on a good day? \n\nWith your bowl or roll, you get a salad and miso soup (if you choose to do so, they will ask if you want a free salad and soup -- why wouldn't you say yes?). The miso soup comes out of a machine, so it's not the best but it's free... so it's decent. \n\nI'll come back to try out the other bowls to see if there's much of a difference...

Parking was difficult to find since we didn't want to park in the lot that is under the park. When we finally found some parking, we walked to the restaurant. It's a relatively small place that does not have seating inside. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Sushi Taka Roll, while I ordered the Spicy Sushi Taka Roll. There is a check in offer of a free Miso soup if you order a roll, so we each got a miso soup as well. We walked down to the park and sat on a bench to eat. Both rolls were both very good, but I preferred the spicy roll more because I enjoy that kick. I enjoyed the fresh smell of the seaweed when I took a bite. I tried adding a little bit of soy sauce to the roll but it definitely didn't need it. \n\nSome may say that this place is better than Sushirrito. I feel a little bit indifferent. Although Sushirrito does have bigger rolls, I like that Sushi Taka has a roll that includes both salmon and tuna, or that you have the option of making your own. I enjoy the simplicity of Sushi Taka's rolls.", "author": "Cathie N."}

Honestly personally I'd prefer if the restaurant increase the price or have a notice that they are increasing the price or decreasing the food due to rising cost.

Yelp says it is $ location, but barely. The selections with tax will rack up well above 10$. Furthermore, I would understand paying at such a price if they were well portioned.\n\nThat being said, the money goes into the quality of the ingredients being used, not how much you'll get. It is sushi after all. Even though it is a sushi burrito, it doesn't mean they will use ingredients sparingly like their Mexican cousins.\n\nFinally, the pictures for the sushirittos are misleading. They look big but they're not really. Also, the amount of stuff that goes into the sushi bowls is so small for 9$. Regardless, since they use quality ingredients, the meal was delicious but not filling.\n\nOverall: I can now say I had a sushi burrito.

I walked next door to get a Vietnamese Iced Coffee (I said I'm off the wagon), and when I came back, my food was waiting for me!   The nice man who always makes the sushi gave me my food and was as pleasant as he always is and I was on my way.  \n\nWhen I got to my desk, there was no extra wasabi, no more machta rice, and the amount of fish left much to be desired...

A must try if you're in the area around lunchtime.\n\nTo begin with, the ingredients are incredibly fresh. Honestly, the quality of their sashimi is comparable to those you find in high-class Japanese restaurants around the area. The customization and concept are both great, allowing you to create whatever your tastebuds desire. As well, the price is very reasonable (especially compared to Sushiritto) for the huge variety and amount of ingredients you can include in your order. They also have sashimi-bowl type options for those of you that are like me and would often prefer to eat from a rice bowl. Personally, I also love their assortment of spicy options such as sauces you can add and spicy sashimi. \n\nThe service is always five stars. The manager (I think?) is so friendly and accommodating during the ordering process.  And unlike many Asian restaurants, they check in with you to make sure that you're liking the food (if you're eating there that is). The food also comes out very quickly and it's typically not very crowded. \n\nOnly downside is that there is very limited seating (probably only room for 2 or 3 people at the counter). I understand that it's more a grab and go place, so if you're looking for a sit down setting this probably won't be the best choice.", "author": "Sunny H."}

I trekked out to here to see what this sushi burrito thing is all about. The location is actually on the edge of Chinatown, so, it was a bit further than what I wanted to walk...but oh, well, I'm here already.\n\nThe shop is tiny and they have options to either order freshly made sushi burritos or buy per-made items on their shelf.  I ordered the Duke.  It was rolled up with sake, kani, cucumbers with a wasabi dressing.  The made to order sushi burrito came out within minutes and is a  long.  When I took my first bite and chewed, I noticed that the rice was a bit sticky.   I hate over sticky rice, especially when it gets caught in your throat.  The dominate flavor was the egg and it should have been the sake, which was almost non-existence, there was hardly any sake in this roll.  I didn't even notice the wasabi sauce at all, usually wasabi kicks me in the nose and I didn't get my nose kicked in.\n\nI don't think I'll order another sushi burrito from here but I definitely am curious about the spam moco loco they had displayed on the shelf.  I don't think anyone can mess up with spam, right?!", "author": "Jenny T."}

The roll comes with one main item, two second items, a sauce and veggies. If you're not a fan of cucumber, be sure to speak up, as it will otherwise be included.\n\nAs many others have mentioned, the owner, Nick, is super friendly and welcoming. Every time I've gone, I've heard him personally thank every customer in line for coming in. \n  \nIt'd be nice if there was more seating, but I'll let that slide because everything else (food quality, customer service) trumps the minor inconvenience of having to walk back to the office before I can dig in.", "author": "Lauren S."}

Never much of a line (so far....but I think it's gaining popularity and I'm sure I'm not helping that) and just SO MUCH better than Sushirrito.\n\nIngredients are pretty fresh, LOVE the sauces inside, and overall tastes like a big sushi roll wrapped up. I love sushi and Sushirrito was just...not sushi-y enough for me, flavors weren't that good. This place gives you a pack of soy sauce with which to enjoy your taka roll and that's not nearly enough but still, so yummy.\n\nI have gotten the Sushi Taka roll and the spicy version of that roll and prefer the spicy one but both are really good. Less greasy than Sushirrito and more options. It's like subway for sushi burritos! You can pick a roll or ask for something else. They also have sushi bolls, actual sushi rolls, and rice balls that my coworkers seem to think decently of. Prices are good. Yum! I want to go back!\n\nOne sushi burrito is decently sized but usually I'm not full by the end of it.

It's just a slightly fatter than normal sushi roll that hasn't been cut into pieces yet. Once the novelty wears off, it tastes just like those other mediocre sushi joints.\n\nMy friend was dying to try Sushiritto, but settled on this place. She couldn't warrant paying over $10 for a sushi roll (neither could I). We arrived before noon and the place was empty. The guy behind the register was really friendly and helpful. (I think his name was Brian because that's what the receipt said). He explained we could build our own sushi using the DIY menu or choose one of their preset rolls. I went with DIY and had the salmon, spicy fish roe, wasabi kanikama, cucumber and miso dressing. Friend had the king roll, but substituted the kimchi for fish roe. \n\nOverall, it was just okay. There's nothing exceptional about the taste that makes me want to come back. So how is this different than your average sushi restaurant? Taste-wise, there's no difference. However, if you like your sushi to be served as one giant roll rather than pieces, then come here. Also, for $8.50, the portion is a bit small.

However his cook prepared the food with all the interest of your average bus driver. I couldn't help but notice when he used the same hands he was handling raw fish with are the same hands opening cabinets, operating the microwave, and everything else - no wiping, just straight from fish to appliances and back again.  This normally would be a deal-breaker for me, but again the proprietor was so friendly I decided to let it go.\n\nSo, the roll is essentially a large sushi roll.  I asked for the Taka Roll, Tuna/Salmon/crab/tobiko.  The rice was perfect, delicious!  The crab was a bit too mayonnaise-heavy, but tasty anyway!  The two, small french-fry pieces of fish (one of tuna and one of salmon) were nice flavor bonuses for eating a roll of rice, but honestly if I didn't know they were there I wouldn't have noticed them.   That's a problem, and for me a big one.  40% of the roll is mayo-crab, 50% is rice, 10% fish?\n\nImagine you ordered a regular Tekka Maki and got a string of fish the size and shape of a drinking straw, the rest of the roll being rice.  That's what happened here.\n\nSo why three stars?  Because it was tasty.  Because it wasn't very expensive ($10 out the door.) Because the owner clearly loves his place and maybe I went on an off-day.  I strongly suspect he wouldn't short-change me the fish.

I thought it was in the financial district but it is more on the eastern border of chinatown. I did go at around 1:30 so there was no rush. I was surprised at the small location without seating but that's ok. As I was walking to Sushi Taka, I noticed the $5 for $10 deal on Yelp so I bought it instead of using LevelUp, which would've only saved me $1. \n\nI was greeted by Nick, who is probably the owner. Very nice, genuine guy! I was expecting more of a Sushirrito type establishment but basically it's like u-sushi fused with Sushirrito. You choose your meat/veggies and other fillings with sauce(s) and they roll it up for you in minutes. It's not cut into pieces, just in half. It's not burrito-sized if that is your expectation going in. It's more of a larger sushi roll. \n\nI had the unagi and shrimp tempura (half and half) with egg and fish cake. All veggies included by default. Sauce: chili mayo and miso dressing. The whole process took probably less than 5 minutes. I didn't eat it right away but the flavor remained a few hours after I settled down and had time to eat. It probably would've been a good idea to eat it right away as the tempura was soggy from the filling but the sauces definitely made up most of the flavor in every bite, so choose them wisely!", "author": "Dominic T."}

It's an easy 4 step process and it takes you through your choice of protein, additional fixings (up to 2) sauces (up to 2) and finally your veggies (unlimited and free).\n\nI got the salmon with egg, miso sauce, edamame, cucumber and lettuce.  Delicious! They have lots of items that you can add with your sushi burrito depending on your appetite.  I didn't get any, but all the prices seemed very reasonable.  \n\nThe staff is very friendly and they definitely appear to take pride in what they do.

The staff was really friendly, so it's good. Too bad I dont get to try their chef's special (korean bbq beef roll). However, I customize my order with salmon, eggs & guacamole with all veggies included. I would say overall it's not bad. Just wish they put a bit more salmon and bigger piece of eggs in there. In the beginning, I was wondering if this would be filling enough (comparing it to Sushirritos' size) since I finished half already. Surprisingly, when I'm almost done, I feel full. So I guess this is the right portion for me. At the other place, the sushi is HUGE, but it's packed with rice, so it's pretty overwhelming and I never finish it.\n\nLike other reviewers mention, I think they should have more preset rolls on their menus instead of focusing on customizing them. I want to be able to go in there and just I want a blah-blah roll and they will make it, rather than constantly referring back to the menu to look at what should I put in the roll. \n\nWould I go back?

In fairness, I'm fussy about fish. I don't deal well with challenges. Sushi needs to be fresh and tender. If I have to work to chew on a piece of fish, I spit it out (same goes with finding bones in my fish). If the sinew of a piece of fish tries to lodge itself between my teeth, I spit it out. \n\nAlas, my spicy salmon roll at Sushi Taka failed to please. The salmon tasted plenty fresh. But I couldn't chew threw the pieces of fish. Believe me, I tried. After gulping down a couple of very stringy, sinewy pieces, I gave up. My appetite was gone. Queasy from the experience, I sipped my tasty bowl of miso and called it a day. Mind you, the rest of the roll ingredients were terrific (love the green tea rice). But the fish - the point of the roll - grossed me out. \n\nWill I try again? Yes. Service is friendly and efficient. The prices are right and the menu is easy to navigate.

It's on the corner of Kearny and that street where the 1 bus runs going towards Van Ness. I had to pee SO bad at that time and when I went in I asked if they had a restroom but they didn't. There were like 10 workers in the small ass \"restaurant\". It's not really a restaurant. More like a food court mall booth. You definitely can't dine in. There were hella workers for a small ass place. We got the unagi roll and the salmon roll. The cashier asked if I wanted a bento box or all theses misc stuff they have on the side. I asked if the two rolls will fill us up and he said probably not so I said okay lemme order a spam musubi. I was checking in on Yelp at that time so I got a check in special and got a free miso soup. I checked in with my hubby's phone too so he got one too. We left and ate our food at the park down the street cuz there were benches to sit. The rolls were pretty good but kinda small. They were about $10 each. I forgot if it was $7.99 or $8.99. Anyhoo, my hubby didn't like the miso soup much. After I ate my roll, I looked in my bag and my spam musubi was NOWHERE to be found!!! Grrr!!! I was pissed. They forgot my musubi and I paid for it!! So I walked my ass all the way back and they were closed... Luckily the door wasn't closed. They had blocked the entrance with a bucket or something. I told the guy who seems to be the owner that they had forgot my musubi and he gave me two from the shelf... I was like it's okay??? Cuz I thought those were just displays like synthetic food. He apologized, I took the musubis assuming it was fresh since he's giving it to me and wouldn't give me old ones right??? Went back to the park.... Okay the musubis were old. Tried to eat at least half to get my moneys worth but was simply disappointed instead. So overall....I liked the rolls. The rolls were good. Kinda small. Kinda pricy so I would probably only come here once in a while. I don't recommend getting the musubi because it wasn't good. L&L tastes WAY better. I didn't get the musubi fresh so who knows. Maybe it tastes better fresh? They gave me an old one. The bento box and other random stuff behind the glass displays didn't look good anyways. I didn't get a receipt when I paid AND didn't get a food I ordered so it SEEMED like they were trying to rip me off but I'm sure that's not the case. I would have liked it if they gave me a receipt so I can keep track of my order cuz what if someone makes a big order and they were missing stuff like how I was? The guy who seemed like he was owner was nice. He told me where I could find a public restroom down the street. Nice guy overall. But back to the food...I had a bittersweet experience because they forgot my food and I had to come all the way back and didn't get a fresh one. I would have been happier if they gave me a fresh one. Would I come back? Maybe once in a while. Still kinda small and pricey in my opinion.....so just 3 stars. I was relieved they didn't lock the doors and left when they closed for their lunch break cuz I would have been SO pissed.

Yay for 35% off and good timing!\n\nOrdered:\n1 King Roll and 1 Warriors Roll\n\nThe King Roll was delicious! I love spicy food and if you do too, this is the menu item to order. Even if you don't like spicy food, this roll is pretty mild, so don't be afraid to give it a try. This roll consisted of green tea flavored rice (standard rice in all their rolls), spicy salmon, kimchi, spicy kanikama (crab meat), and soy mayo. \n\nThe Warriors/Worriers Roll (different spelling on their actual store menu and their online menu) consisted of tuna, guacamole, kanikama, and soy mayo. This roll felt more burrioto-esque with the guacamole. The flavors were okay but it was missing the wow factor. Perhaps, changing the sauce may help? I would not order this again. \n\nBoth rolls were not too overwhelmingly large and they had decent amounts of each ingredient. The rice to ingredients ratio was perfect. \n\nThis place is small, so do not expect a sit down and relaxed atmosphere. Although they  do have two foldable chairs for patrons to sit, the space is very tight, almost claustrophobic small. \n\nGreat customer service and very friendly staff. \n\nThe overall consensus is that the King Roll is the roll to order if you're trying this place for the first time. I will definitely frequent this place to try the other menu items and once I figure out which items I like the best, I'll customize my rolls.", "author": "Kit K."}

(that's what I wanted!)  the fish isn't not fresh, but it's also not prime.  and there isn't a lot of it in the rolls; but there is a lot of egg and mayonnaise and guacamole and, well, extraneous STUFF.  i'm sure some people like it, but not me.  yuck.  and it's all to go.  just so you know.", "author": "gary g."}

The staff was extremely friendly and serviceable. They were happy to explain the way things work (you can build your own sushi burrito) for first timers like us. Our food was prepared extremely quickly (that being said we were the only ones there, 11:15 lunch FTW) and we were out the door within 5-10 minutes of walking in. The sushi burrito itself was a little weird at first but quite delicious! I remember saying that I wanted another as soon as I finished. The only downside I can think of is that one burrito sometimes is not filling enough. And for $8 I usually like to be a little more full after a meal. Other than that though I would absolutely recommend this place and I have every intention of going back to try more!", "author": "Cooper J."}

Next to him on a display table was a large sushi roll, similar to a burrito (sushirito?) and the grand opening announcement, (I'm always one to support lil mom and pops). Got the Chef's Special which included a sushi roll and a drink for $9 dollars (damn Gina).  In a hurry,  and on my way out, the owners literally shook my hand to thank me for my biz. Running off to my meeting, 3 hours later, (at 5:30pm), I *finally* ate my \"lunch.\" Expecting the sushirito to be gross and soggy, ingredients inside were STILL fresh and crisp- and the flavor...MAN,  So flavorful and SO GOOD- I wanted MOOOORE. I could eat one of these everyday. Can't wait to go back. Only complaint: portions not big enough for the price.", "author": "Rebecca S."}

The only reason I deemed this \"restaurant\" worthy of 2 stars was due to the friendly staff; however, no amount of charm can compensate for the atrocious food. My coworker and I each ordered two rolls and were decently excited to try the food after reading the positive reviews. After one bite of each we immediately threw the rolls in the trash and opted to eat the stale cereal sitting around at the office. Sushiritto blows this place out of the water and it's not even that good. Do yourself a favor and go to Tokyo Express.", "author": "Stephan S."}

In short, the Roll was good and i could eat a whole bucket of that Krab.  i'll try spicy next time.  Also the guys were very polite.", "author": "hugh L."}

The sushi is always fresh and the price and amount is just right. \n\nThey don't necessarily have the variety of Ebisu a few blocks down but for me the location is much more convenient, the guys who own/work there are much more personal, and the price is way more reasonable for what you get.  The \"do it yourself\" concept is kind of coook but it's great that they have the more standard pre-set rolls.\n\nHighly recommend with or without the Yelp deal.", "author": "C A."}

The sushi wrap is not huge, which is perfect for someone is weight consious. I didn't try the salmon due to the reviews I'm reading here, but the Miso California Roll was a right choice, a bit salty but flavor is quiet good. The rice is really good, not sure how exactly they made it, but very fresh, moist but not sticky. So important for a rice roll. I also got the green tea cake, given I still have room to consume.", "author": "Daveen L."}

You can choose your own fish , toppings , veggies , and sauce for your own sushi roll but their toppings and veggies are kinda weird ... they're not things that you would normally put or want to put in your sushi rolls . I decided to stick with a spicy salmon roll with tobiko, cucumber , and spicy mayo which was actually not bad ( suprisingly ) . The roll ended up looking like a burrito / wrap cut in half . In addition to the roll , I also had their miso soup which was not bad . It's kind of cool how they use a miso soup dispenser machine and how they let you add your own toppings . I would like this place more if they offered avocado as a topping ...", "author": "Eileen L."}

Same concept - pick a main item (fish/beef/tofu), veggies, sauce and it all gets rolled up like a burrito.  They also have standard rolls like spicy tuna, california, etc in addition to the DIY rolls.  Their rolls are definitely bigger than usushi's and about the size of the ones from Sushirrito.  Majority of the rolls are $7.50 plus tax.  I tried the spicy tuna - ingredients are fresh and flavorful, easily hits the spot.  They only slice the roll in half, so you'll basically have to eat it like a burrito.  The only frustrating part is getting soy sauce and wasabi on the roll; you gotta methodically bite the thing so that it's easier to dip.  If only there was such a thing as sushi salsa.  Somebody get on that!  Also this isn't a restaurant, just an indoor food stand.  Overall, a nice and healthy option for lunch and a good spot to swing by for a quick sushi fix.

I had the Duke Roll and he had the 49ers roll. I was happy with my roll in regards to size, flavor, and, if I were to go back, the menu price but my fiancee's roll was a bit smaller than mine which we thought was odd. I would think all the rolls should come out to about the same size since most of the burrito is filler anyway. His roll cost a little more because it had tuna in it so that was reasonable enough but it shouldn't mean his roll should be smaller. The roll was still tasty though. We also each ordered a cup of miso soup which was also flavorful but in our opinion a bit pricey had we not had the coupon. It's $2 for a small cup. I think somewhere under $2 is more reasonable. Service was friendly (met Nick the owner) and fast. I'd consider going back again for lunch.", "author": "D T."}
