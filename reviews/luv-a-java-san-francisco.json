Sam & Fahad (the owners) are so friendly and know our orders by heart (because they are so nice, they hired a pretty unfriendly woman who really needed a job, but she's gone now and it's back to 5 stars all around!).\n\nCoffee is $2 and strong and delicious, which is a great value esp in this city (though I wear plaid and bike to work, I don't really ever want a $4 pour over!). They do have cappuccinos and chais and their egg sandwiches on a bagel are the best I've found in the city (I'm from NY and good bagels are tough to find out here!).\n\nI \"work from home\" here at least once a week - wifi is super fast, plugs conveniently located and they are totally cool with me staying all day (I usually order 1 drink and 1 food item). I also like that you see a mix of people - there will be older men reading the Times in one corner, a ladies book club talking about social justice in another, families speaking arabic on the couch, and some of us on computers, which is a great vibe. I also left my computer charger here one day and a week later they gave it back to me in a bag w/ my name on it (so so nice thoughtful!).\n\nIt's also kid friendly! On the weekends I bring my 1 year old and no one seems to mind when he's running all over the place.

Otherwise, the place is generally an ideal spot to work.\n\nAs for food and drink: I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I can vouch for the breakfast sandwiches. Having just arrived from the east coast, I must say it is SUCH a welcome change to find that spots like this are able to load on fresh produce ingredients. So it probably goes without saying they have tons of veggie options too, but I think they're worth mentioning.  Like the Sun-Dried Tomato Bagel for instance.(It's exactly what it sounds like + red onions and cream cheese). Or the Veggie Bagel (cream cheese, cucumber, tomato, red onions, and avocado), and the Veggie Garden Sandwich (hummus, cheese, avocado, sprouts, lettuce, tomato, red onions, and jalpeno). \n\nWith this place in my 'hood, I run the risk of never making myself breakfast again.

The atmosphere, food, and beverage was more than just bland. \n\nThe place was quiet even though most of the tables were filled. When I said hello to the cashier upon stepping up to the counter, everyone in the shop turned like I had sneezed in a monastery. \n\nThe manager or owner type felt the need to ask everyone in the shop if they had ordered my sandwich, even though the cashier had asked for my name, saying that he thought my order was weird. The order - turkey, hummus, cucumber on plain bagel. This guy made the order weird & me sick from it - he heated the hummus! Gross! \n\nAnd my chai tea was luke warm with milk concentrated on top.\n\nMe no luv  Luv a Java Coffee House.", "author": "Sara L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-12-12", "description": "Luv-A-Java is the Noe Valley coffee shop I head to when seeking solitude rather than human interaction.  Come the rainy season, it's my go-to spot when inclement weather displaces the outdoor bench scene at Martha's on 24th Street.\n\nWhile peaceful, it's not terribly chatty.  Whenever I cozy up to a window spot and kick back at Luv-a-Java, I do so knowing that a solitary visit sits ahead of me, but also  *knowing* that my paper will get read, and *knowing* that the crossword puzzle  will get my best effort.  Martha's on 24th Street is polar opposite...conversation is quick and easy, but you never know when one of the locals is going to get ahold of your ear and start going yakyakyakyakyak a mile a minute, leaving little if any chance of your newspaper getting a quick glance let alone a solid read.  Regular customers interact with the staff while ordering, but conversation at the tables is scarce.  The music is coffee-shop appropriate, but just a tad loud. Barking dogs on the sidewalk are rare, and screaming children are all but non-existent.\n\nNewspaper readers gravitate towards the front, where small tables bask in natural lighting that cascades in through large windows facing Dolores and 26th Streets.  Free wireless Internet brings in laptop users, who usually cluster towards a cozy area at the rear featuring subdued, LCD friendly lighting.  Better yet, multiple power outlets placed in useful spots let the home-office crowd hang out with their laptops without worrying about battery life. \n\nQuiet. Peaceful. Solitary. A light, airy space with good coffee and ample snacks.  A good spot to lose oneself in a newspaper or work away from home, but not so great for catching the latest neighborhood gossip.  Looking to get away from it all rather than wallow with the masses?  Pop by, grab a cup, and postpone life's demands for an hour or two...", "author": "Mike W."}

Free wi-fi is a sweet deal. The pastries aren't that spectacular, but the people there are always open to thoughts and comments, so I feel like I'm welcome there. :) A nice place to stop by if you want some peace and a friendly serving of coffee.", "author": "Josephine J."}

Ah well.\n\nA great neighborhood coffee shop - perfect for a drive by en route to 280 or to sit down and wile away the hours.", "author": "Kate W."}

They brew a killer cup of coffee, rich, deep flavored coffee that makes one proud to live in SF. Service is always cordial and attentive, and I think they really do want you to \"have a nice day.\"", "author": "Travis W."}

Thanks to Yelpers and their reviews, I finally found this gem in my own neighborhood - seriously, I would have continued to overlook it, not realizing their was wireless, if not for the reviews.  Thanks Yelp!\r\n\r\nGet this - my residence where I used to work has been over-run by obnoxiously raucous construction, and so I realized I might be forced to trying to be productive at cafes along Valencia or Mission St -- which aren't my ideal setting, considering the commotion and tight quarters.  Sooo a handy Yelp search produced this cafe, even closer to home.  I truly like it!!  It's not noisy - in fact, some people step outside to conduct their phone conversations so I wouldn't suggest coming here for a lively debate with a group or such.  There's also enough space.  While I am working, I peer upon luscious palm trees.  I feel very comfy here!  The people who work here are rather nice and helpful.  And, oh, most importantly, the coffee's nice and brisk and rocks me to the core.  And, hey, I don't know what is meant about there being no food, because there are plenty of nibblies here, though most are ready-made.  I had a nice greek salad for lunch and I can see there are  some pre-made sandwiches here too.", "author": "Femita J."}

Gave it two tries (second out of pure convenience), and both failed to impress me miserably. I actually left wondering the second time how people can run a coffee shop and seemingly have not one care how their product tastes. I'm thinking the answer has something to do with people's utter desperation for the stuff.", "author": "sarahjane s."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-09-20", "description": "Favourite Noe Valley cafe hands down, and likely to be in the top 5 for those in San Francisco. Has that 'hole in the wall' look, that made me think I found a hidden neighbourhood gem. An optimal place to bring one's lap-top or a good book and idle away a few hours. The staff and owner seem uber cool with this, and it adds to the chill atmosphere of the place. Coffee is great and strong, pastries fine, and there's a good selection of other drinks to buy. The only caveat is that because it's so quiet during the late morning / afternoon, it's not really ideal for a raucous conversation between friends. That said, I love introducing the place to friends visiting the area as it's my ideal place for a coffee and a good read.", "author": "Steven B."}
