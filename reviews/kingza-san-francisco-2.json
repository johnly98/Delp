Kingza was very very good last night!  \n\nSo someone from yelp who loves sushi as much as I do recommended I check out Kingza. It was not on my radar before but I went to go check it out. Apparently the sushi chef, Tony, had previously worked at a three star Michelin restaurant in New York called Masa and so this restaurant was getting hype. However, when I looked at the yelp reviews, they were very mixed. Fast forward to when I went yesterday, I did not have high expectations since the reviews were not as glowing but the food was amazing!! \n\nFirst, they DO NOT skimp on the expensive ingredients. Think multiple slices of wagyu beef, multiple generous portions of Hokkaido uni, great pieces of toro, and huge truffle shavings. My bf was very very impressed. \n\nSecond, they had some super great and unique appetizers. There was this papaya with baked uni custard... just thinking about it again is making me drool. Also they had a great truffle chawamushi!! A lot of times it feels like the appetizers are just some thing before the sushi but here, they were stars in their own right.\n\nThird, the chef's technique is out of this world. A sushi chef (not here) told me that the best chefs in America are from New York but the best fish is in west coast. Well I think we got a great combo here guys!! Each fish was so perfectly cut it glistened with smoothness... you know like how tiger eye looks all polished... like that. Also there was never any stringiness with any of the fish, all of the pieces were selected perfectly. The rice was also the perfect temperature. That cutting technique though.\n\nI can understand people's gripe about this place. It doesn't have the formalism/ceremonial atmosphere most omakase places do. The chef is chatting with people he knows, drinking with the guest, guest are getting drunk and yelling at each other from across the room, etc. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's nice to have a chill place with amazing food. \n\nThe only thing I would note is that it is true the sushi itself is fairly traditional (even though the appetizers are not.) There isn't much by way of marinades, garnishes, etc. This meant that many fishes could seem similar. I didn't have a problem with that but I saw one comment did. My bf, however, did not like that there were two mackerels in the sushi course since he does not like fishy fish. That's just a him thing though LOL", "author": "Jocelyn K."}

It's clearly displayed at the counter and nigiri is superbly fresh and delightful!  I opted for their Hitachino Japanese beer because I felt like beer more than sake!  \n\nThe signature wins are his appetizers like his Truffle Chawanmushi!  It was appeasing to the taste buds and smell!  Uni amuse bouche was buttery rich and I couldn't get enough!  I would have preferred for truffle toro to be raw instead of seared. It would have tasted better - textured wise!  Chef took time on telling his background and he came to be in SF.  It was a nice story while dining!\n\nAll nigiris were savory and treasured with each mouthful!  I was a bit disappointed that the wagyu truffle nigiri didn't get tossed into my omakase!

Also messed up numerous parts of our order and described menu items inaccurately.

Usually when we have omakase, we're served each piece one by one for an intimate meal. For some strange reason we were given 5 pieces at a time here. At first I thought this was normal so I brushed it off, but the people next to us were receiving their pieces one by one. Where is the consistency here? Why did we get half the omakase treatment for the SAME PRICE? It really did take away from the experience and not sure why we were excluded from this. We made reservations to specifically sit at the bar to get the full omakase experience. We could have sat at the tables and received the same thing... why tell us specifically on the phone omakase is at the bar @ 5pm and 8pm only??? Weird.\n\nI do have to mention how fresh and delicious the food was. The appetizers were very unique and all extraordinary. Unfortunately, I was confused why we were getting a Grade B experience to truly enjoy the meal. Hard not to look over to our left with eyes of jealously to the people reciting the proper, intimate omakase experience. \n\nThe casual, laid-back environment could have been cool, but now it just seems lazy on their end.

Quality of the ingredients (e.g. uni from Hokkaido), technique (e.g. stripping the sinews out of the tuna), service and friendly chef set this place apart from many. \n\nI've been here twice now and each time I've ordered the omakase. And each time was an awesome journey. Make sure to call ahead of time (at least a day) so that they can prepare.\n\nYou start off with ~4 appetizers, which are out of this world good. I haven't had these type of appetizers anywhere else until coming here. Different then straight nigiri after the other compared to other high end sushi restaurants. The uni wagyu and chawamushi were my favorite. After that you move on to the nigiri, which is about ~8-10 pieces (I forget the exact number). Each piece is different in terms of flavor and texture, and offer a refreshing and delicious sensation every single time. Tuna was definitely one of the best I've had. Strangely, I also really liked the red snapper. Lastly, as with any high-end sushi establishment I'd expect the uni to be top notch, which it was. The chef learned from Masa in NY and his experience there has carried well over here. Tip: if there's too much wasabi in a piece, you should tell the chef and he'll adjust. \n\nAbove all else, the service was world-class too. It was pouring rain the second time I visited and the chef himself opened up an umbrella and walked me to the car waiting outside. \n\nOverall, well worth the price. Highly recommend. If you're looking for incredible food and an amazing experience, definitely check this place out because chef Tony and his staff will take care of you.", "author": "Jonathan C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-02-01", "description": "I'm torn between giving this a 3 or a 4 stars. It's a solid 3.5, but since Yelp doesn't let halves, I'll bump it up to 4! Reservation is pretty easy via Yelp. If you want Omakase you need to book 6pm or 8pm and request for omakase. Parking is pretty hard to find in the area, but we were lucky to have found street parking after going around a few times. One downside is that we were never shown the menu since we asked for omakase, so I have no idea how much I would be paying and what the omakase includes. \n\nOn to the foods! In other omakase restaurant, they always start with the leaner fish first before building up to the much fattier fish. It's the other way around here. We were served fatty tuna twice and wagyu on the first course after appetizers and we ended up with mackerel. All the fishes were good, but I would prefer to have it go from leaner to fattier first. The papaya dish is outstanding! It's very unique and definitely not one we ever tried elsewhere.\n\nWe paid $125/person for omakase and we ordered an extra uni which costed us a whooping $13 each. A bit surprising since it's small and compared to how much we were charged for the omakase, I think the uni is overpriced. The omakase itself is worth it for the price, just don't order any additional piece :)", "author": "Prisilia P."}

If your date freaks out because there's no menu and you eat whatever the chef brings you, she's probably a \"missionary\" girl. \n\n*snorts out tea*\n\nLove it! Unless it's served to you on a pretty platter by a sushi chef, nobody wants a dead fish.\n\nGood sushi is expensive and yes, I think it will probably guarantee you a second date but most likely out of guilt because you spent your entire paycheck on the first date. I think a fancy omakase date should be reserved for when y'all are official but what do I know?\n\nMy friend and I've been eyeing Kingza since they opened earlier this year but read mixed reviews on Yelp so we waited it out. Ten months later, we finally decided to take the plunge in this still under the radar sushi restaurant (aka no Biased Bauer review yet). \n\nNo regrets.\n\nOwner/Chef Tony is from NYC and trained with the 3-Michelin starred chef, Masa in NYC (omakase goes for $595 pp there). \n\nAlthough they have an a la carte menu, I always spring for the Omakase at a higher end sushi bar to get the chef's best offerings. You receive 6 appetizers, 15-18 nigiri, and dessert for $125 pp. Lots of luxe ingredients like toro, A5 wagyu, truffle, and uni, and we left stuffed so it was a good value. \n\nOmakase needs to be indicated in your reservations at least 2 days in advance. There's 2 seatings: 6 pm and 8 pm. Parking can be tough in the area so allot extra time so you're not late. \n\nO  M  A  K  A  S  E  \n*Dungeness Crab, cucumber, santa barbara uni: http://bit.ly/2yi0SVK\n*Tai Maki, pickle, shiso, avocado, cucumber: http://bit.ly/2BFTzh5\n*Kanpachi, truffle, micro greens, fried julienne potato: http://bit.ly/2Be0vBc\n*Grilled Uni Custard, baked persimmon: http://bit.ly/2BbPm3h\n*A5 Miyazaki w/ shimeji mushrooms, truffle, yuzu, shio kombu: http://bit.ly/2yi8hEF\n*Chawanmushi, black truffle, Japanese sesame oil: http://bit.ly/2jCdTbG\n*Nigiri (1 of 2): Toro (sinew removed), Seared Otoro, Shima-aji, Engawa, Kinmedai, King Salmon, Tai, Kanpachi, Kurodai: http://bit.ly/2BWhkgO\n*Nigiri (2 of 2): Sayori, Kamasu, Aji, Saba, Iwashi, Hokkaido Hotate, Hokkaido Uni, Ume Shisho, Ankimo: http://bit.ly/2iSYKyy\n*Housemade Lychee Sorbet: http://bit.ly/2iVwR8X\n\nHighlights:\n*The grilled uni custard in a baked persimmon was ridiculously good. The creamy, sweet savoryness with the lightly carmelized crown and salty brininess from the uni was ahhhhmazing. One of the best things I ate this year.\n*The dungeness crab w/ uni, the crab was really fresh and sweet, and went well with the creamy briniess of the uni. \n*The kanpachi filled with fried julienned potato was delicious. Loved the texture contrasts. \n*The chawanmushi w/ black truffles was so smooth and silky. \n*Favorite nigiri: toro (sinew removed), kinmedai, king salmon, aji, and saba. \n*The housemade lychee sorbet was refreshing and nicely sweet with fresh pieces of lychee. \n\nLowlights:\n*The nigiri omakase started with toro. Personally, I think a light to fatty fish progression is better with omakase. \n*Half of the nigiri was just ok. For some of the lighter, white fishes, I think some garnishes could have been added to enhance the flavor. \n*Temperature inconsistencies:\n--The first batch of shari (sushi rice) was too warm.\n--The uni in the nigiri towards the end of the omakase was super cold and the nori was chewy. Perhaps toasting the nori with a torch would help.\n*Not food related but the sushi bar area in front of Chef Tony looked a bit cluttered with the trays, tiny bowls, and knick knacks that weren't used that night. It distracted a bit from the experience. \n\nWe went for the first seating at 6 pm so it was a quiet, enjoyable dinner. Everything was well-paced and took about 75 minutes for the full omakase. \n\nThe staff are very polite and Chef Tony is very friendly. I liked that he checked in to make sure the wasabi levels in the nigiri were ok for us. We were 17 nigri in when he asked if we were \"ok\" (full). I love a good ankimo so we asked if he had any. He gave us each a piece for no charge. Very kind of him. \n\nWe were ogling the truffle butter and truffle oil in front of us, and Chef Tony insisted that we open the new bottle to give it a whiff. One smell and we were sold. He makes his own line of truffle products and sells it at wholesale to his customers. We each bought a bottle of the Truffle Oil ($15): http://bit.ly/2jCrIqy which will come in handy for pasta dishes at home. \n\nIt was quite quiet for a Saturday evening so it's great for a special occassion date night or splurge meal. Please save the sake bombs and drunken frat boy debauchery for The Marina. \n\nDespite some of the lowlights, for the reasonable price, the omakase at Kingza is most definitely worth checking out!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Unlike some high-end omakase only spots in SF, Kingza's unique because they offer a high-end omakase experience ($125), but also has a more affordable a la carte menu as well (hence their more casual vibe). \n\nHighlights: \n- A TON of appetizers (some great, some good): the miso cod was the best I've ever had, grilled uni custard in papaya was really unique and interesting, Hokkaido uni and oysters.. mmm\n\n- ~12 ish nigiris. Loved that Chef Tony serves you 9 different kinds of fish and then a few extras of your favorites at the end. We LOVED the barracuda and iwashi, so of course we double up'd on those. \n\n- Kama toro deserves it's own shout out because that was THEEE best toro I've. Ever. Had. Chef Tony was really excited about this; it was from a 500 pound tuna he broke down earlier that morning. He said it's on YouTube if we wanted to watch, so here it is: https://youtu.be/GoKsko5hN9Q\n\nNot my absolute favorite omakase in the city, but definitely at the top of the pack (4.5 stars!).

More and more chefs are starting to understand the subtle qualities of Japanese food, and that's a great thing. Chef Tony learned his trade under Masa in NYC for a few years, and it shows. \n\nWe got treated to the $125 omakase (thanks bro-in-law!), where everything was superb. The highlights for me were actually the tsumami (appetizers). It's been a few weeks so I forgot what exactly each dish was, but the sliced hotate with uni and ponzu, and a uni truffle chawanmushi/flan was superb.\n\nThe nigirizushi is comparable to the best sushi restaurants in the Bay Area, all with high quality fish and good technique on the rice. We had everything from ootoro to aji to hokkaido uni, and all were delicious. Chef Tony does have good technique with forming the nigiri, which I'm sure will get even better with more experience. The only thing I noticed is that the rice tends to be a bit on the sweeter, less-vinegary side, which goes well with some of the fish, whereas some other fish will fare better with a little bit of vinegary acidity.\n\nThe best thing, though, is how nice and friendly Chef Tony is. We had a great time chatting with him throughout our meal. This is a business that I really want to see succeed, and we'll definitely be back again!", "author": "Kazu O."}

I disliked 2 of the dishes, one was the baked papaya with uni. The taste was just off and the uni tasted sour. The second was the seaweed dish which I saw him scoop onto the fish and was a bit grossed out because it was so stringy and goopy. The abundance of truffle oil was a let down, as I believe the dishes should stand on its own merit. \n\nAnother thing I found odd was starting off with the fattiest part of the fish (toro) to the leanest.  I felt that having such a delicious bite of the toro first and the subsequent fish after was a progressive let down.\n\nI was also disappointed earlier on when I asked the waiter which of the 2 hot sakes he recommended and what the difference was.  He said he didn't know.  Ummm ok.  Can you find out?  I ended up ordering an Asahi beer instead. \n\nA minor point for me is that even though the chef worked at Masa for 3 years, was that he was Chinese. I avoid sushi places without a Japanese chef (Korean, Thai, Chinese, etc).  The chef was extremely gregarious and nice so it was a nice change switching from talking with my date to the chef.  \n\nOverall, a decent meal but I would rather go to Kusakabe due to the quality of service and fish.

What a mistake to make!\n\nThe food ended up being delicious, and hurting more in the wallet than I had planned. We didn't look up much about this place before going in other than seeing it was sushi and so when the staff asked if we wanted omakase we said why not, not realizing it would set us back $125 per person.\n\nAll the food was amazing as all the reviews here mention. My favorites were the wagyu with truffle, the steamed egg with truffle, and the many types of fish were delicious.\n\nThere were a few errors in the service that are why this wasn't a 5-star place, though I'd try it again for sure. First, there was some inconsistent seasoning of the fish between me and the other person I was with even though we both expected the same thing and neither of us had indicated to the chef that we had different preferences. My same piece of fish was packed with wasabi and made me cough while my dining partners was much more soy sauce with almost no wasabi.\n\nSecond, the service was very very odd. The restaurant was relatively empty aside from us and a group in the back. The staff kept walking in and out of the front door, seemingly to smoke or something else. It wasn't very pleasant as it drew a lot of attention to the staff. Second, the staff kept pouring out our sake for us, which sounds nice but in practice every few minutes someone was struggling to reach between us as we were attempting to have an intimate conversation. I would have preferred to just pour it ourselves and in retrospect I should have spoken up to say that we were comfortable doing so.

Kinza has been on our radar for several weeks, but we wanted to go without our daughter.  Luckily our daughter was invited to a friend's sleep-over, so we immediately made a reservation for later that evening.\n\nWe were looking forward to eating here.  Kinza has built up some hype since opening.  We walked in for our reservation and were told we can't sit at the bar.  We have to sit at the tables and cannot order the omakase service.  Apparently, they need to be notified a couple days in advance.  We were told we could come back an hour later for a seating at the bar.  We decided to sit at a table.  Our server was able to get us a couple dishes from the omakase (live uni, caviar dish, and sweet shrimp).\n\nThe Uni was great. Simple, straight forward with a little Wasabi. The caviar dish was off. Can't remember the fish, but it was topped with Russian caviar, swimming in vinegar and topped with truffle. It sounds good on paper but there's too much going on. Overkill and lacked balance. The sweet shrimp was great, served with its fried head. I love that one-two combination.\n\nWe then ordered a few pieces of nigiri and sashimi. The fish was fresh, good quality, but small. Every piece was cut thin and short.\n\nThere were some misfires here and there in terms of service. The staff are well intentioned and work hard to make up for the mistakes.  My wife's exact words, \"this place is a bit of a sht show\".\n\nOverall the quality is good, but doesn't compare to other omakase restaurants in the Bay Area.  We spent about $200 after drinks, tax and tip. So it's not too expensive, but they are stingy with the cuts.

They were efficient with removing the dishes and wiping down our wooden blocks used for sashimi. \n\nFor our omakase, we had 6 appetizers, 13 nigiri + 1 extra toro + 1 choose one to have again + 1 semihandroll, and of course a dessert.

The typical amount is not bad, and considering I never eat my sushi with wasabi, I thought it was the perfect amount. There were a few pieces that had a little too much and went up our noses. I could have asked for less wasabi but I wasn't at the point of no return from too much wasabi so it was on me, but we had a great laugh about it. We were also able to try the wagyu beef I seen photos with and OMG. You seriously need to try it, the meat just melts in your mouth, I usually don't eat/care too much about meat, but give me a plate of this and I'm not sharing. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. \n\nLastly, the dessert. It was a lychee sorbet. I really wish I could buy a tub of this but it will forever be in my memories. There was a strong lychee flavor with lychee bits but most importantly it was a sorbet that wasn't too sour. \n\nIf you haven't been convinced by this review to try their omakase, I don't know what you eat but its obviously not the amazing food I had.", "author": "Tiffany H."}

This is not clear AT ALL. This was the only reason we came here and instead had to order a la carte.\n\nThat aside, here is the breakdown of our subpar experience:\n\nService: Extremely slow. We got our first dish 40 mins in and the next one 40 mins after that. Unbelievable. We ended up having more sake than we needed to since we had already committed to eating here. Also, our waiter was not very friendly and every time we got a dish served no one bothered to tell us what it was. Most other sushi places have better service than this. Beyond \"apologizing\" for the ridiculous wait, nothing else was offered. \n\nFood: We ordered a variety of dishes and nothing stood out. We had the wagyu beef, yellowtail jalape\u00f1o, live uni & sushi special. Wagyu beef was $35 and not worth it AT ALL. As was everything else. Totally disappointing. Fish was OK, not terrible but not great (again, i'm comparing to the price)\n\nSeeing the bill at the end of the meal was the biggest shock because we did not see the value at all. I had the intention of coming back for the omakase but after this experience, won't be coming back at all.\n\nNOT GOOD, So many better sushi places in the city at a better value.", "author": "Laura D."}

There were two uncoordinating servers so one would take orders and then the second one would stop by to see if we were ok so we ended up having to say we were waiting. Some if the dishes came out, but not the appetizers. Those came after a reminder or two at the end if the meal. Someone's side never came out and we ended up canceling it. Finally, there was a fish we didn't immediately recognize and when we asked the server, she had to go ask the chef what it was!!\nOnce the bill was brought, after what seemed a normal amount of time, we had to chase them down. \n\nSo that was service. I can accept mediocre service if there's amazing food involved, but it wasn't.\n\nThe sashimi was served over a huge bowl of ice cubes so the fish didn't shine through at the colder temperature. The sushi was smallish and the prices were high. We all agreed that the fish was fresh, but you can get quality fish in many places. People enjoyed the egg and truffle appetizer. The best part of the meal was the hamachi kama. \n\nThe hamachi Kama was perfect! Finally, something great about this place.\n\nI feel bad for the out of town friends who chose this particular spot because of the chef's training.", "author": "Susan B."}

If you opt for the omakase (~$125), you'll sit at the sushi bar and be served by chef Tony, who is the owner.\n\nTo start, Laverne N. and I were presented with a flurry of appetizers -- abalone, beef skewers, uni custard in papaya (so unique!), AMAZING miso cod, etc. Then came the nigiri -- my favs were the kama toro, barracuda, and a5 wagyu with shaved black truffle (what's new, lol). The uni handroll was also delicious!\n\nI'd say the best part of the experience was chef Tony's enthusiasm for the food and willingness to chat with his patrons about each and every dish; he even showed us the certificate of the cow from which our wagyu came from. :x Definitely the most engaged I've ever been during an omakase.\n\nHighly recommended, especially if you prefer not to dress up for dinner!", "author": "Jennifer K."}

I kept hearing people talk about it saying how good it was, how the over truffle your nigiri. Like come on, how can you really say no to truffle?!? Once me and my bf got there, we got seated very quickly before we made rsvp. The restaurant wasn't a place where it's dedicated to just omakase, they have regular menu as well. There were 8 of us total sitting at the bar area that was having omakase. So the list of bad things start...\n\nI tried ordering a bottle of nanbubijin sake. But the waitress came back and said they didn't have it, and was recommending us another kind. Assuming she knew what she was doing and talking, we went along with it. But it turns out it was umeshu (plum liqueur, it was not even sake. The waitress also said it's a dry sake when it's not. The couple next to us also ordered a bottle of nigori sake (unfiltered sake) but the waitress didn't even shake it before serving it to me. Lack of experience! I couldn't help but lean over and tell the couple that they have to shake before serve. \n\nThe chef put so much thoughts into the appetizers, which was amazing btw. But when it got to the nigiri, omg it was not what I was expecting! They all taste the same because they don't even bother garnishing the fish beside the soy sauce that they brush on top, for every single piece, same! Like at least some green onions, lemon zest or truffle or something!  For the price, i felt like the quality of the fish was like just mediocre. If they don't mention the type of fish to me, you probably couldn't tell much difference from the kind you can get from the Japanese market. And each piece took really long to come out because the chef had to make other customer's order (the people that wasn't part of the omakase party). AND we had to put our plate out to reach for our nigiri, I feel like since I'm paying for the piece $125pp I should be served and not reach out for my own food just cause the chef couldn't reach us. I felt like I was at a cafeteria getting food. \n\nLet's just say me and my boyfriend couldn't wait for the experience to be over so we can just pay and leave.", "author": "Carol Y."}

The appetizer also came out VERY SLOW. i was really hungry and the service disappointed me. \n\nNigiri\nChef Tony did great preparing my dinner, however the other chef needs more training. Some of the fish were cut by the other chef and one of my nigiri's fish was too thin and does not cover the whole rice. Whats worst was that one of the nigiri still have the fish bone! I have to spit it out because its not the edible thin bone. The moment I saw the bone from the fish ruined my mood and I just cant wait to go home. The amount of wasabi was not consistent too. i had to ask 3 times to make it less. So far, this is my worst omakase experience after paying almost $200 \n\nDessert\nI was served a homemade sorbet. I think it was lychee and it tasted really good. It was the highlight of my omakase dinner!\n\nAlthough, i need to say that Chef Tony is a great and kind guy.

It was super fresh and creamy, better than most uni I've had\n- Miso cod: we were all surprised at how tiny the piece was for $15; flavor wise, it was less sweet than expected, which is fine, but the portion was just really small \n\nWe then each got a sushi tasting (7 nigiri + maki) for $30, which is a super reasonable price.\n- Maki: salmon roll and a yellowtail and scallion maki \n- Nigiri: 7 pieces, including hirami, wild king salmon, sea bream, shima aji, tuna\n\nThe sushi rice texture was good, but I wished it had more flavor.  I assume that for the omakase, the nigiri are individually seasoned, but ours came with just wasabi, so you had to dip the pieces in soy sauce.  All of the fish was fresh.\n\nI wasn't quite sure what to expect - I thought it may be similar to the other higher end omakase places, but it's a more relaxed vibe.  Still, the omakase at the sushi bar is not cheap. Based on the photos on yelp, it does seem like they do more seasoning with the nigiri pieces in the omakase compared to with the sushi tasting. \n\nI'm usually not an uni fan, but I would say the highlight of the meal was the uni.\n\nIt wasn't hard to get a reservation, and the Mission is easy to get to for those of us who live on the peninsula.

The service was really welcoming and food was exquisite! I feel like this place is a hit or miss since I saw bad reviews, but because of that, I came here with low expectations - however, everything exceeded expectations! \n\nFor the first 5 dishes, they were appetizers before the nigiri - very different from most omakase spots as appetizers would come in between every few nigiri pieces. I was most impressed with the first 5 appetizers being top omakase dishes like uni, truffle-flavored almost everything and wagyu! The nigiri pieces were all super soft and rich in flavor - they keep the fresh fish at perfect room temperature or something for it to melt in my mouth dish after dish. Also, the chefs here are super generous with truffle - mMmMm!\n\n- Kanisu (fresh dungeness crab salad with summer cucumber vinaigrette topped with fresh uni): I enjoyed the strong vinaigarette and citrus taste to the crab salad and the fresh uni on top was the cherry on top. For the first dish of the meal, I am very impressed uni was a starter!\n- 2 Oysters (house ponzu, scallions and wasabi caviar): oysters were tasty and fresh with the rich flavors from the house ponzu and a kick with the wasabi caviar - yum!\n- Baby Abalone: Didn't see this on the menu, but wow am I once again impressed with an abalone dish (delicacy). The abalone doesn't have a fishy taste - so they cooked it perfectly! Chewiness was perfect as it wasn't hard to chew off and had a slight marinated taste that got me wanting more!\n- Sweet shrimp ceviche (sweet shrimp, microgreens, watermelon topped with caviar): this dish was also tasty with the texture of watermelon underneath. Edible flowers and veggies as the microgreens - interesting, but super yum!\n- Grilled Uni custard with papaya: This has got to be one of my favorite appetizers - grilled uni custard is so delicious when placed on top of papaya pieces topped with truffle! Grilled uni was so rich and definitely didn't have the fishy taste they usually have when raw. The truffle helped make it even more rich. I would totally order this again.\n-Wagyu carpaccio (seared A5 Miyazaki wagyu beef topped with summer truffle): This is also one of my favorite appetizers! We got 3 wagyu pieces with a lot of summer truffle on top - super generous and melt-in-your-mouth goodness! I ate this dish slowly because I wanted to savor every bit of it.\n- Truffle Chawanmushi (Japanese steamed egg with truffle): Also made it to my top 3 appetizers of the evening. Usually, the steamed egg is pretty normal and nothing outstanding, but I must say, this one had truffle in every taste! Super amazing and would definitely reorder too!\n\nWe get a total of 12 nigiri pieces and the first two nigiri pieces were chu toro and o-toro... whaaaat?! Usually, chefs save the best for last - but we got to enjoy yummy toro first! Another nigiri favorite was the butterfish topped with summer truffle, scallop, and uni handroll. Since it was my girlfriend's birthday, they gave her an extra uni handroll - how nice! We all also got a shot of tasty fruity sake to cheers with the chef too - wow. The service is amazing and food was exceptional. We all ended our meal with a lychee sorbet that had actual lychee jelly pieces inside - mMm!

Uni custard served in an uni shell - custard wasn't bad...presentation was nice...cool but I did not taste any uni at all!? Zero. Wagyu + truffle was decent but portion was tiny. Service was heavy on the pretty bad side. Waiter definitely needed some additional training or better...a career outside of the restaurant business. The menu looked good...3 pages good...too bad half of it was not available! The waiter stood there rejecting our orders one after the other. Out of 12-15 or so items we tried to order...we were able to get about 6. And to top it off, pricing on receipt did not match price listed on menu (I had to point this out so that they could correct it...a couple of items were marked up $1 more). I was really excited to check this place out but a big disappointment it was. I did go on a Sunday so maybe it was a bad day yo go?

Kingza felt like a casual friendly neighborhood sushi bar with a high end price tag.\n\nCons\n- Like the other yelpers, I agree that service needs alot of work. Waitstaff not experienced. We got here on time and the waitress/hostess apologized for the delay due to patrons still eating which was totally fine but another couple got seated before us and my friend mentioned that and she did not know what to do but the other couple realize it and let us sit first. The waitress also asked us some things that were kind of offensive like when we asked for recs on sake, she asked us what our price range was. I don't understand why that would matter if we wanted the best sakes they had to offer. The better question would be what taste or type of sake I prefer.  Also, she never checked on us and the owner had to pour us water instead. I overheard him say to her to check on us more. She came back and ask if we wanted to move seats instead which was strange.\n\n- Prepare to wait. Food comes out slow.. don't go there hungry\n- Unfiltered sake selection was not high end or hard to find in your local market. Need a better selection.\n\n\nPros\n- This could have been an one off event but hands down, the omakase bar patrons really made the night. Everyone was friendly and Tony, the owner went around to chat with everyone. One lady ordered a $600 bottle of sake and shared it with the table of 12.  It was a rowdy and happy Friday group.\n- The food! uni was a topping on 3 of the plates and there was caviar and truffles involved on some of the nigiri sushis.  \n-Unique sashimi pieces and combination of ingredients was refreshing.\n\nTony did some upselling where he showed the patron some fresh live shrimp and went around to ask who wants one. If you say yes, it's an extra $10. Not sure if this is a pro or a con lol", "author": "Kelly C."}

Decor was the k and sushi was above average and menu was interesting. \n\nNow Kingza, which the waitress tells me has been open for 4 months, is very different. \n\nI absolutely love the sushi bar - a very smooth solid piece of timber and well maintained with no stains. But that about all I can brag to you about. \n\nThe sushi menu was lacking. Very plain. And what they did offer was WAY overpriced. For example - sashimi is $5 per slice, and it is sliced razor thin - I mean I ordered four pieces of hamachi and it was, not exaggerating here, it was the thickness of a quarter and about two inches long. Other places if get more meat in one piece than I got in four, so that was a wasted $20. So thin you can't even taste it. \n\nThe salmon sampler - 4 sashimi, 4 nigiri, and 6 maki, was $26. The sashimi was a little thicker than the hamachi, the nigiri about average, and the maki was so painstakingly assembled with the thinnest slice of salmon he could muster from the blade. \n\nFor $4 a bowl of miso soup was so watered down and bland it tasted like water with a piece of seaweed floating in it. \n\nI should have known, as Kiji it was always packed. This time there was only one table occupied by obvious tourists. \n\nOverall $95 for two and we went home to eat ramen.", "author": "Bill B."}

I felt the quality of fish was lackluster and the quantity of rice too much. The maki was not memorable at all.  For a side I had a bowl of miso which was quite amazing, but didn't make up for the sushi. \n\nOverall I don't think I would go back.

If the cost were lower, this would be a solid 3. but at this price, the cost/value/quality was 2 stars\n\nWe got the Omakase. \n\nLet's start with the good. \n- This is a large quantity of food\n- Sake was good\n- Some of the bites were delicious--especially some surprise hits, including the papaya dish\n- Most of the fish was fresh and high quality; even their uni was delicious \n- Chef offered a free revisit of one of the nigiri course (while some omakase restaurants charge an additional a la carte fee)\n\n\nNow the bad.\n- The pacing was a mess. It took 18 minutes before we even started. We were sitting at the bar confused and unsure \n- The chef who was in front of us was clearly new, and while I'm down for training, it seemed like he was SO green, he didn't know any of the basics. That's disheartening for a $125 meal\n- There was a fly in the fish refridgerator. We notified the chefs, and they just sort of gave up\n- In the first course, we had uni on top of crab. The uni was delicious however all three of us in our group had crab shell in the crab. We notified the chefs, and they didn't do anything\n- when the first course was dropped, no one said anything to us. they didn't explain what we were eating, just dropped it. We had to ask for help\n- as we got into the nigiri course, they started with toro -- two rounds of toro-- starting with that heavy and fatty of a fish seems questionable \n- The nigiri pieces were dropped on the same piece of wood, and the wiping of the wood only occurred once every three nigiri, so flavors were blending and not in a good way\n- they were heavy-handed on the wasabi, and even after we told them that the wasabi was too strong, and they asked for feedback, they didn't change anything\n- the fish cuts were extremely inconsistent from person to person; within our group it seemed like each of us was getting a different cuts of the same fish. When we brought this up, we were essentially told we don't understand how fish works\n- some of the fish was cut so poorly that it ended up being so chewy that we couldn't even gnaw through. we left those chunks on the plate, and no one said anything\n- On one dish, the sticker of the fruit was still left on the fruit, again we brought this up, and nothing happened (not even a courtesy discount or drink or fish or even acknowledgment )\n- The hot dishes came at wildly different temps between our group. One person had chawanmushi that was so hot, she could barely eat it. The other two in our group had cold dishes\n- They used truffle in EVERYTHING. It was like a trick they couldn't stop performing. It overpowered the fish, and didn't add to the experience. One of the nigiri servings was literally just a ball of rice sprinkled with flecks of shaved truffle. No one needs that. \n- the layout of the sushi bar is problematic. The sushi chef kept asking us to move our plates so he could put the fish on them, and occasionally he gave up and just threw pieces of nigiri on to the plate from afar\n- the three chefs were not in sync. Sometimes each chef would tell us exactly the same thing. But, they didn't seem to be working together. It was odd to be so close to that dynamic.\n\nOverall this experience was somewhat bizarre. It felt like an impression of a fine sushi experience, but not the real thing. I think it would have been even worse at a table, so I'm glad that we at least were sitting at the bar.", "author": "Amy C."}

Most things were 'not memorable' to 'just ok' -- like the wagyu and most pieces of sashimi and sushi. There were 1 or 2 things that was downright terrible -- like the vinegary caviar with some kind of fish in the middle thing (not kidding we couldn't figure out what kind of fish it was because it was swimming in overpowering vinegar). Let's put it this way, even the mass-produced omakase at Sugarfish by Nozawa beat them on both quality and price...and that's literally mass-produced omakase for the beginner!\n\nIn the grand scheme of top notch sushi places that serve omakase, it wasn't overly expensive.

Paid 230 for 2 people with 2 sake each, appetizers and main course, which is way too much for what we got. Service was ok but awkward sometimes. The nigiris had way too much wasabi. One of the appetizers, wagyu with truffle, was just too small for the $35. The ice cream dessert had 0 taste, definitely not home made.", "author": "Kevin I."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-27", "description": "One of the best sushi places my wife and I have tried, so we made sure to make more reservations after the first bite. We both went for the omakase and was not disappointed. Every single piece was very flavorful. Usually, when we go to other high rated restaurants for omakase, there are \"filler dishes\" that are OK; however, here, all dishes were excellent. Reservations for 2 at 7:30PM was very easy. We were seated immediately and was able to order drinks promptly. Almost at all times our sake was poured for us, which was nice. The staff is very friendly. Being seated at the bar made the experience even better. The chef, Tony, provided great hospitality and comped some dishes and drinks that we were gladly expecting to pay for. The price is VERY fair, relative to other highly rated sushi spots in SF, but the quality and flavor of the food was excellent, if not better. Every dish was memorable. The ambiance is louder and has a lounge feel, compared to Maruya and Omakase, but not distracting. Environment is OK, but the food was excellent. Can't wait to be back there on Friday :).", "author": "Tommy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-10-22", "description": "We came in with such high expectations for omakase. Having made our reservation a week in advance, we expected that there wouldn't be a struggle to keep up with the demand. Almost everyone present was there for omakase, and it seemed like both the sushi bar and waiting staff could not keep up. The wait time between dishes was extremely inconsistent. We waited 10 minutes, sometimes 25 minutes, in between courses, which really set off the flow of the meal. Some of my courses that were meant to be hot dishes came out cold. The chef did not realize we were given a certain type of sashimi once already. The head chef was also too busy chatting with friends at the sushi bar. We had a party of three people for 7pm on a Sunday and stayed until 10pm. Three hours for omakase is excessive, especially when the experience is subpar to begin with. Despite the lack of service and the tremendous wait time for our food, the quality of their fish is great, just not worth the time.", "author": "Evelyn C."}

We were visiting from NYC and specifically were looking for an awesome sushi place that was intimate, and this hit it on the head perfectly! Sushi Chef Tony makes the experience amazing. Formerly of Masa and a former New Yorker, he made us feel so welcomed and even added additional pieces to the Omakase (foie gras over rice that MELTS in your mouth!) and another taste of Toro!!! He was a great conversationalist that you know is doing this because he loves it AND because he's damn good at it. He took the time to address every single person at the bar to make sure they were enjoying themselves and that they had enough pieces (adding extra if you weren't full)! He even took a shot of sake with us. The quality of the fish was on point - fresh, perfectly seasoned, and each one well crafted! We've been to quite a few of the former Masa sushi chefs in NYC (I.e. Neta back when Nick and Jimmy first opened it and was actually really good) and this one is right up there with them. The intimacy was equivalent to many more expensive sushi restaurants. It shows that Tony is looking to build relationships with his clientele and there were a couple of repeat customers in there... obviously for a reason! Wonderful place! P.S. when making your reservation, make sure to ask for omakase ahead of time (otherwise you'll get seated at a table).", "author": "Sophia T."}
