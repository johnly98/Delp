I came here for dinner and was seated at the chef's counter (always the best seat in the house and it's a treat to see the chefs prepare pizza and the entrees in a wood fired oven).\n\nThe meal included the heirloom cucumber salad, half order of the pasta special that night (perfectly cooked carbonara with truffle), the chicken meatballs with beans and garlic on the side and strawberry panna cotta for dessert.  I really wanted to try a pizza but, alas, I was already stuffed by the end of the meatballs.  \n\nIt's really good food but it's not the best Italian I've had in SF (the pork and veal meatballs at Zero zero are better and I would go to Cotogna or SPQR for pasta).  Service was so-so but the ambiance definitely exuded the Marina vibe.  With tax and tip, this ended up being $115.  Overall, I think four stars is about right and I would recommend this place if you are craving Italian food and are in the neighborhood.", "author": "Andrew S."}

It was a lazy attempt at a dish that should have excited- I feel like I could recreate this meal easily after spending less than $8 on ingredients at the grocery store after work on a random Tuesday.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-08-12", "description": "Between how long they've been around and how well regarded they've consistently been, it's not exactly shocking to see how many reviews A16 has accumulated over the years.  Which, in turn, largely explains their popularity and why it's historically been so tough to get a table here.  That is, until as of late it seems; after seeing available reservations pop up more and more often on OpenTable, it was like a sign that the time had finally come to check this place out!  However belated it might be...\n\nAlthough the restaurant looked rather dark when we first stepped inside, I really enjoyed the vibe of the space.  Yes, it's loud, but I liked the dim and cozy vibe, as well as how you can sit at the counter and watch the open kitchen at work (the back patio space looked really nice, as well).  Most importantly though, the menu looked terrific - lots of starters, pastas, pizzas, and meats/entrees to choose from, alongside the \"Black Truffle & Grana Padano Festival\" specials they had going on as well.\n\n-- BURRATA with Olive Oil, Sea Salt, and Crostini...$18\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a16-san-francisco-4?select=VOSywV-8zhNTY0D3YthrSQ)\nBurrata is a must for me whenever I see it and, fortunately, this didn't disappoint - the cheese was flavorful, stringy, and not very watery.  Also,  while a couple of the crostinis were borderline burnt, they complemented the burrata and olive oil very well!\n\n-- ZUCCA with Summer Squash, Pancetta, Crema di Cipolla, and Pecorino...$20\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a16-san-francisco-4?select=VjkGIjBvA4kVfeXAw-Eufw)\nI had heard the pizzas at A16 were quite good and I can certainly see why!  The pancetta (there was so much), crema, squash, and cheese created this delicious mix of flavors.  What's more, the crust was terrific - slightly thick and just a touch salty.  Yum!\n\n-- CASSARECCIA - Ragu Bianco, White Wine, Grana Padano...$26 (full order)\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a16-san-francisco-4?select=4qFdq2Ajex_DKft0M4Bw6g)\nMy least favorite dish of the night.  On the plus side, the pasta was well-cooked and the grana padano was tasty.  On the other, the sauce wasn't very good and the meat in the ragu had a weird/gritty taste and texture to it.\n\n-- CAPUNTI - Preserved Egg Yolk, Summer Squash, Grana Padano, Black Umbrian Summer Truffle...$24\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a16-san-francisco-4?select=Yv5z1pNQwkSAqJz6eLZsJg)\nI was pretty hopeful for this dish (it was our one pick from their festival specials), but sadly, it didn't stand out.  The noodles were perfect, and I liked the truffles, but the sauce didn't pack much of a punch otherwise.  Not bad, just not super memorable.\n\nBeyond the food, service here was pretty solid.  Our server wasn't over the top friendly, but she and the rest of the staff were still pretty nice and accommodating.  I just wonder the food was like when Nate Appleman was here; his views on SF diners aside, his time was when A16 seemed to get more notoriety.  Our food certainly wasn't awful, but it'd be fair to say I was hoping for more.\n\nGiven how good the pizza and burrata were, I wouldn't mind coming back for those two, especially to sit in the back patio area on a date.  However, with so many great alternatives out there now, I'd be hard pressed to round up from THREE AND A HALF STARS.", "author": "Mike L."}

Getting our food did take a little while though, so you may be sacrificing service somewhat by sitting out here.\n\nI had the white pizza with prosciutto and mushrooms, and added arugula.  The crust had a good quality and the ingredients themselves were all fresh, but the overall flavor felt a bit flat.  Adding some spice helped, and I ended up requesting lemons to give the pizza a bit of acid.  It was pretty enjoyable with these additions, but not really enough of a treat to justify the price.  \n\nYou'll probably enjoy your meal here and it's a pretty nice setting if you're looking for something more upscale, but I'd personally prefer to check out some of the legit Italian places in North Beach that can offer better quality in a more casual environment.", "author": "Neal C."}

We shared a bottle of wine and I had to pour the entire bottle for ourselves during the duration of the meal. Rookie move from a service side. \n\nBeet salad was great. Pizza, incredible.

I'm a vegetarian and it's annoying to have to Google the ingredients in order to figure out if you can eat that dish. It took too much effort to decipher the menu. I was also surprised that they were not willing to make any substitutions on their dishes...replacing a white sauce for a tomato sauce on a pizza.

I tried the prosciutto and mushroom pizza, and it was absolutely to die for. It is a white sauce pizza and the mushrooms and prosciutto just go so nicely together. If you want a side or a starter, I recommend the caesar salad. It is a more nuanced caesar, but fantastic. \nOverall, this is a really fun place that is absolutely worth the try.

It may have been great once, but it is a disappointment on multiple counts.\nFairly noisy place and some of the staff are downright unfriendly, including our waiter, Omar, who wasn't much interested in answering our questions about the menu.  More discouraging was the most important factor -- the food itself.  Both pizzas and pastas are good, but portions are small and prices are noticeably high.  A single glass of basic wine starts at around $12 and goes up from there.  This place may have been a destination at one time, but it is fairly average now with a high price tag.", "author": "John S."}

The pre-set menu/chef's tasting seemed popular (which has to be booked in advance). We got seated at the tall chairs overlooking the chef's preparing the dishes. The service was good and we got help in picking the right wine. We had burrata to start with which was pretty standard. They did serve us additional crostini on request. The pasta with cauliflower and zucca pizza we picked sounded like some new combinations that might be interesting. However, I was let down by the lack of flavor in both the pizza and the pasta. It just had lot of oil/butter. On the other hand, the seafood being prepared by the chefs looked promising.

We finally decided to try it last night, and it did not disappoint! \n\nWe arrived a few minutes late for our 8:00 p.m. reservation on a Friday night, without incident. I wanted to change our reservation the day of to an earlier time so we could squeeze in the Madea Halloween movie, and I was surprised to find that it was not an option for us - A16 was all booked up on Open Table by then. \n\nWe started with the burrata and acqua pazza, which were excellent choices! We were told we got the last acqua pazza, which was delicious--served in a spicy tomato based broth with all of the seafoods--I would call it a \"must-have.\"  The burrata may be the best I've had to date, largely because (i) it was served at the perfect temperature (room) (ii) with a very high-quality olive oil and a hint of saltiness... yum!  We ordered extra bread so we could sop up every last drop of broth and olive oil, sooooo goood! \n\nWe shared the bavette steak, medium rare, served with cannellini beans, and the pesto bucatini for entrees. Both were delicious. The bucatini was cooked perfectly al dente and the almond pesto was likewise perfectly satisfying. The steak was cooked exactly medium rare and served in a sweet but yummy plum sauce. \n\nWe were so stuffed from those two courses we skipped dessert. Some final notes: Beer and wine only. Dark and loud. Your typical Marina crowd. Service is seamless and efficient. Prices are typical for the area. Not great for parking. \n\nWe were just very pleased.", "author": "Sunny S."}

I've eaten salads all over the world my friends (NY, Paris, LA, SF, Dallas, etc), this should've been priced at $7 for what you get. The meatball soup was pretty good, very fresh in the sense it's a light broth and very minimalistic. Overall I would say just okay, it's saving grace being it seems healthy. The Maccaronara was $16 for a small portion, and it wasn't good at all. Neither the noodle nor the sauce. My boyfriend's lemon gnocchi was bland as well. \n\nOther issues include how loud the restaurant was and the service. \n\nIt's very very loud inside. We asked to be moved due to the noise. The original waitress we had because of our first table wasn't very accommodating when we asked to move one table over so that we could sit side by side to hear each other. The hostess then came and moved us to the atrium. The new waitress we had in the atrium was great but a little slow on service. The original waitress delivered our food at one point and still had an attitude.

I probably would try this again another time.\n\nSo far, I like A16, but I can only give them 3 stars for now since the pizza I had didn't totally blow me away.

Yes they are a little bit pricey for what they are, but who can argue when they taste so good?\n\nWe had the Funghi and the Margherita.  I feel like you can always tell how good a place is by the classic Margherita.  You can't hide anything when all you have is the dough, the sauce, the cheese and some basil.  I'm happy to say the sauce was tangy, the cheese was milky/creamy deliciousness, but the star of the show was the smokey, crunchy yet chewy, perfection that is the crust.  The hardest component to get right but boy did they get it right.\n\nThe Funghi was equally delicious but had a completely different flavor profile.  Boy were they generous with the mushrooms.  The thing was absolutely smothered.\n\nService was good and friendly and the decor is the San Francisco chic you are likely accustomed to.\n\nThe one main gripe I would have is that the amount of mozzarella was a bit stingy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-01", "description": "This is a great, non-tourist, casual but upscale southern Italian eatery.  We visited on a recent weekend stay in the city by the Bay at the suggestion of a local. It's off the beaten path for the tourist crowd, but easy enough to find by either bus (how we arrived) or Lyft (how we returned) from our hotel at Union Square.  \n\nI think the food was very good, but--Hipster foodies will likely roll their eyes at this--I found the place a little pretentious.  For example, my wife had some squid ink seafood pasta. Very good, but the squid ink served only to blacken the pasta without really adding anything but a few bucks to the price.  And the wine list outstrips the menu by at least 500+ items.\n\nI enjoyed our visit, and others who appreciate wine and new twists on food will probably love it.", "author": "David R."}

We decided to give it another try and brought our son with us to celebrate his graduation from kindergarten. We made reservations and they stuck us way in the back 'garden' room which was so hot it felt like a greenhouse. As we were being seated we saw another party ask to get moved into the main room - so we asked for the same but to sit at the counter so our boy could enjoy seeing the cooks and pizza ovens. They told us no - the counter was reserved for \"walk-ins\" and that we couldn't move into the main room either. WTF?!! We had RESERVATIONS!!\nService from that point on wasn't any better and the food was meh. My husband had a pizza - the dough was undercooked and super chewy (i confirmed). My son had a pasta which was one of the specials with truffles and the entire dish was so bland we could've gotten by with pasta, butter, parm. \nSalad was boring and I had the trout which was overcooked. We also ordered the side of snap peas that were overcooked/soggy and the mint flavor definitely didn't transport me to any part of Italy.\nFor the finale - I ordered a glass of white wine for $15 and the pour was close to a tasting - barely a 1/3rd of the glass size.\nWe will never return - I'm so surprised they've survived this long.", "author": "DeeLite W."}

Starters came out quickly. Burrata was superb, felt like we were back in Italy. Waiter recommended the apple salad which was also tasty- light and features lots of fennel which I am a fan of. My friend and I shared a margarita pizza and added prosciutto. It was really great. Doughy yet crunchy crust, flavorful sauce, gooey cheese and perfectly salty prosciutto. They also let you cut your own pizza with scissors which is a fun touch. \n\nAs for the location, it's a fun atmosphere that seems to always be brimming with people. Long and narrow with a pretty outdoor area in the very back. We were seated at the bar which was quite nice and allowed for easy conversation despite being seated next to the person that you're with.

We went  here for my friends birthday party and it was fun being with our group drinking wine and enjoying some appetizers. The setting was perfect, the ambiance was nice and surprisingly it's a lot bigger than expected. It looks so tiny from the outside but when you walk in the good spots are in the back. Our waiter was awesome and he was so patient. big kudos to him. I'll try adding his name on here once I figure it out. So the reason they got 4 stars was because of the dish 3 of us ordered and unfortunately had to send it back. We ordered the Maccaronara which I guess is their most popular dish according to the waiter but it wasn't great at all. We all tasted it as a hard noodle that needed to be cooked longer. It kind of almost felt like the it was cooked half way. But after sending back I ordered their Beet Salad.... which was amazing! Oh my god. Everything was just perfect and surprisingly fulfilling. I did want to try their pizza but   I guess next time with a bigger appetite, I hope to make it happen. Definitely will be back.", "author": "Hector C."}

During our 2 hour dinner, I was bumped/hit 3 times as the waiters were scrambling around.\n\nBathrooms are insufficient for the size and poorly located. 2 Bathrooms each restricted to 1 mens and 1 womens. Had to constantly wait up against a wall while the ENTIRE restaurant patrons squeeze through to walk to main dining area.\n\nSquid appetizer - way too salty, the cook added olives that were so salty that it ruined the dish.\n\nPork Chop - More fat than meat, under seasoned, underwhelming.\n\nPizza - Ordered the spicy pancetta pizza - came out tasting good and very spicy due to chili oil. So much chili oil the middle of the pizza was a soggy, oily mess, and way too salty due to the pancetta which was BLACK (aka burnt). Pizza crust was good.\n\nSquid Ink Dish - Was listed as top 25 item for 7x7 things to eat before you die....I will pass. Underseasoned, seafood was mediocre, and tiny proportion. Go to Old Skool and get the Uni/Squid Ink dish - that is Amazing.\n\nService - Asked for sparking water in the middle of dinner. Was given to carafes and no additional cups (we had 4 cups with regular water). We asked for additional cups for the sparkling water. Waitress gives us the cups and started taking the regular water cups away. My wife said, I will keep my water glass. The waitress' response is \"I am only doing what you asked\". She was very curt and rude as she was scrambling around acting like she doesn't have time to provide us with the proper service. \n\nThe food highlights does not compensate for bad service and overall bad experience.", "author": "Joseph L."}

They had no problem accommodating us which was appreciated.  However, the service was poorly lacking, unfriendly and a bit condescending. Three of us had the steak. Mine was served medium rare even though I wanted medium and the server did not come by to check on us to my recollection. Each of our steaks contained a healthy serving of gristle, making it difficult to cut - I was shaking the table. I did see a previous review that thought her pork was overly salted; I felt the same about the steak. Two of the sides came out after we were served our steak, not with our meal.  We were never offered bread (are we supposed to ask?) The steaks were 38.00 per person and totally not worth it. I will say the fava beans and potatoes were good and well seasoned.

He suggested a reasonably priced, delicious bottle.  It was the most delicious thing of the evening.\n\nThe burrata was good, though it had an interesting texture I haven't ever experienced with Burrata before.  It was.....chewy in places?  But it was decent in general.\n\nThe pizza was horrible.  First, they bring it out with scissors.  Yes, scissors.  I get it - scissors are the \"traditional italian cutting tool\" for pizza from forever ago or whatever.  Awesome.  Welcome to 2017 where knives are commonplace.  Oh, and btw, for a restaurant of this caliber, i have expectations the kitchen will cut the pizza for me, and not leave it to me to make a total mess out of the pie by attempting to creation fashion out of pizza with scissors.\n\nThat aside, the pizza was SOUR.  Not sour, like tomato sauce sour.  It was SOUR.  As it it had been dipped in lemon juice prior to serving.  We sent it back, with no replacement.\n\nThe pumpkin Gnocchi was absolutely flavorless.  And the dish was the size of a small candy bowl.  After having to return the gross (and messy) pizza, I was hungry.  Not only was I disappointed with portion sizes, but I had to send this dish back too as it just didn't taste good at all.\n\nMy partner's Maccaronara was equally \"disgusting.\"  It just had a very off flavor and I didn't blame him for not wanting it.\n\nThe staff handled it all very well, and very professionally.  They offered to bring additional food items and even offered to comp the whole check.  We opted NOT to try any more dishes, as at this point with 4 disappointing dishes we figure this restaurant isn't for us.  We definitely paid for our bottle of wine (it was delicious!) and quietly left the scene.\n\nWe probably will never return.

Upon arrival at 11:45, it was completely empty, so I took a seat at the bar and enjoyed a glass of a lovely Italian white the bartender recommended. People trickled in, then my friend arrived and we were seated. Our service started well, and we shared the luscious burrata with nice, fruity EVOO. My friend had the bean soup while I had the gemelli pasta with a citrusy herb pesto. The texture of the pasta was great, but there was uneven salty and not salty bites. After we had been served, our waiter basically never returned. I flagged down another sever to ask for the wine list to order another glass to share, but no one returned nor made eye contact until after we were done, so we skipped the wine and paid.

We thought it would be fun to relive the 'scene of the crime'.. \n\nWine bar:\nI have to say, the bartender was on his game and knew what he was pouring. It was a pleasure in that he allowed me to taste almost anything. I had a lovely glass of 'sarno 1860'. a dry white from Italy. Anyway, onto dinner...\n\nWe were seated and give a menu with our names printed in the top with 'Happy Anniversary'. I gotta tell you.. this is pretty fab folks.. really.\n\nAppetizers:\nI ordered polenta, Sandra ordered a salad. Salad was fine yet after i tasted the polenta i noticed it was spicy.. like chili spicy.. i'm like WTH? so i looked at the menu.. weird, nothing on it explained there were slices of chili minced into the polenta = deal breaker. Ok, do I enjoy heat, yes. Do I like salsa, yes. Do I like pepper, yes.. yet NOT in my polenta.. and simply LIST it on the menu.\n\nI explained to the the server (Emily) and she brought me a bean soup. Thank you Emily ;-)\n\nMain courses:\nI ordered the roasted chicken with broccolini. Sandra ordered the salmon. Salmon was fine. After a bite of chicken I noticed there was way too much salt. I took another bite, same thing. It was as if the chef was having a field day with salt.. and anyone in the culinary field understands what heavy salting equates to.. right? Anyway, Itried the broccolini. It was prepared fine yet they added grapes and something else essentially making it taste like something other than broccolini.. kinda like eating some sort of bland generic legume. \n\nJacob, the manager must have noticed something was not right and came over inquiring about the food. I explained the huge amount of salt, the spicy polenta and tasteless broccolini.. Jacob was great, he said, 'can i please have the chef see your chicken?\" Of course, i obliged. Jacob returned saying the chef, agreed with my sodium assessment ;-)\n\nEmily brought over desserts; rice pudding and the chocolate budini tart. I took a bite into the art.. WOW! that salt from the chicken somehow made its was to the dessert. Ok, to be fair, the tart is suppose to contain sea salt in the recipe.. just not the equivalent to a salt shaker...\n\nRice pudding had a hardened caramel coating akin to creme brule. It was ok, just nothing to write home about.\n\nJacob came over after and I explained to him that the over use of salt, the polenta, the broccolini, the tart with more excessive salt.. was disappointing. I kindly explained A-16 needs to step up its game to compete with so many places in SF currently.. Jacob explained he was so appreciative of our feedback becuase the only was for them to get better is by hearing from customers.\n\nLastly:\nMeal was gratis. I actually, said to Emily, that is not necessary, yet she said, 'no, it's quite alright'.\n\nA-16 staff/management receives high marks for being professional... yet A-16 falters with respect to food preparation and clarity in communicating the menu.\n\nWith that said, would you return given our experience?", "author": "sam l."}

He threw down the menu on the table, and when the food arrived slapped down the plates on our table.\nThe food was reasonably good, but the portions were small.\nPerhaps a popular restaurant like this can get away with this level of service, but I am not anxious to return.

I had seen it on my list for a while and finally decided to make a reservation and invited along a friend who loves food just as much as I do.  \n\nWe ended up getting the burrata and the calamari to start off with.  I am super duper in love with burrata right now so definitely had to order that and he wanted the squid ink calamari. Both appetizers were pretty on point flavor, texture and temperature wise. \n\nI ended up getting the uni pasta and my friend ordered the lamb one. My uni pasta was definitely too salty. I know that uni has this generally slightly salty flavor but this was salted to the point where it was almost inedible. Definitely not a pleasant dish for me. The pasta was definitely al dente and a good pasta. Also the dish wasn't that warm. It was lukewarm. The lamb dish was much better. The pasta was delicious and the sauce was delicious. I really had wished I ordered that instead. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the chocolate torta which was delicious. It was supposed to have a drizzle of olive oil on top and I generally don't like olive oil on my dessert so I requested to not have it on the dessert. Overall the meal was delicious and just that little hiccup is not something I would judge a complete restaurant on. I didn't have the best experience but that doesn't mean I wouldn't give it a second chance and try something different. \n\nPro tip: reservation and sit outside. It's gorgeous.

Had I not been dining with an A16 veteran, I would still be trying to decide what to order. Since my friend and I came for a late lunch, we decided to split the burrata and bucatini along with a carafe of chardonnay.\n\nBurrata - fluffy and flavorful mound of cheese that is covered in olive oil and shaved salt. It comes with small crostini and melts in your mouth.\n\nBucatini Bottarga- noodles are a bit larger than your average spaghetti noodle (hence the bucatini), and there is a small hole in the middle. This allows for more flavor to be captured within the noodle. The bucatini is topped with a light sauce and delicious cherry tomatoes. \n\nA16 is on the pricier side, but you get what you pay for.

All items were really lovely and well balanced especially the pizza which we agreed was the food highlight. What really left a positive impression on us besides our meal was the service. Our waitress was very engaging and polite despite the obviously high volume of clients at the restaurant. She picked up right away that I was vegan and she immediately recommended small adjustments to the dish to accommodate that. I know that seems like a small thing but it's a huge gesture to me and it made my experience so much more enjoyable. She also did great pacing our meal so that we never had too many dishes on the table. Overall everyone who cleaned our table or interacted with us did a great job.

Service was a little slow, hence four rather than five stars. We were seated in the greenhouse at the back of the restaurant which was quiet but lacked a bit of atmosphere.  And it seemed like our server didn't want to get back there very often. I would advise anyone going here to ask for a table in the main sections. The food though was really good. One of those places where you find yourself googling the ingredients because you haven't heard of them before and now want to eat them every day. Shishito peppers with Calabrian chillis - case in point.  Our server advised us to add a fried egg to the salsiccia pizza because otherwise it would be too dry. Weird to offer something too dry but we accepted her adaptation. Trouble is, when pizza was delivered (different server), there was no egg. And she was right, it was too dry. She didn't come back to check on us but stranded back in the greenhouse we ate it anyway. Strangely though, I am now craving pizza with egg?!  Probably not as good with Dominos. The rest of the food though was excellent. Although we got there at 6pm they were already sold out of two of the four pasta dishes (come on people that's a pretty basic mistake) but the maccaronara was excellent.  The chicken polpette meatballs were very good and the roasted potato side dish was perfect.", "author": "Mat W."}

My husband and I were here for dinner on a Friday night recently and sat at the kitchen bar.  We ordered a margarita pizza, pork chop, and a pasta dish.  The pizza and pasta were not memorable at all (both are better at Delarosa down the street), but the pork chop was just offensive.  \n\nFirst of all, it came about 30 minutes after the pizza and pasta were finished, and we watched it being made in the oven. When it finally arrived, we sliced it and it was raw inside. Not pink and slightly underdone- completely raw and transparent. Like sashimi. Gross. We politely pointed it out to the server who agreed it was raw meat, and took it back. We saw the \"chef\" place it back in the oven for a bit of searing and it was brought back. She offered no apologies. Again, raw. I'm a huge fan of pork chop so I know what I'm seeing but we were told it was supposed to be pink.  It was totally inedible.  On top of that, most of it was fat.  What a waste of money.   It was also really loud and dark, to the point of it being uncomfortable.  Even with most of the raw pork chop still on the plate, we were offered no alternatives nor were we comped for inedible food.

I first experienced A16 when I was still living in New York City and was visiting San Francisco on business. I had heard from a local friend it was a must try so I went in by myself and LOVED IT! I met Benito, one of the bartenders who has since become a good friend. Our friendship started during my first visit as I was dining by myself inquiring about the wines. He lead a small wine tasting and the rest was history!! He has since taken fabulous care of me and really makes each visit very special, delicious and always a LOT of fun!!  Typically the moment I walk in the door and he spots me I have persecco in my hands within a minute or two. We then progress to wine bases on my mood and what I'm ordering. My kind of experience, right? \n\nAs a local to San Francisco, I can now call A16 one of my regular spots I love to frequent. I usually go with a girlfriend for a drink which eventually leads to a bite or two at the bar. There's not much better than amazing, flavorful food, an awesome lively ambiance, great service and a spot that feels like home. A few of my favorites include: The Burrata Appetizer, Mozzarella Pizza, Maccaronara Pasta, and the Chocolate Budino Tart Dessert with Sea Salt. No matter what you order, you have to save room for dessert!\n\nRecently, I had the pleasure of meeting their owner and Wine Director Shelley Lindgren. She was beyond friendly and extremely knowledgeable about their Italian Wines leading me and a friend through a delicious Italian Wine Flight. I really felt like a lucky girl! To not only meet the owner of one of my favorite local restaurants, but to hear her expertise first hand in an intimate setting was beyond special. Whether Shelley, Benito, Alex or Steve are covering the bar I know I'm in great hands and will have an amazing experience! For those in the East Bay they also have a location in Oakland that I also adore, A16 Rockridge.\n\nThanks for checking out my post I hope you enjoy dining with The JetSetting Fashionista.

Olive oil added subtle flavoring.\n\n* Crispy pork belly - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a-16-san-francisco?select=waK92Cv-AvuV8dfxcfdRCg#o74x34KY7aC7mHwfvIr1Hw\n(pearl barley, spigariello, calabrian chiles, salsa verde. $15)\nFantastic crispy layer over a tender chunk of meat. Barley: great texture but a little dry. Spigariello: amazing light bitter taste & slight char, added a different angle to the overall flavor.\n\n* Braised octopus - 5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a-16-san-francisco?select=waK92Cv-AvuV8dfxcfdRCg#sn5dXjhUPUGIQ8T68jf38g\n(cubanelle peppers, roasted fingerling potatoes, black olives, purslane. $16)\nEveryone's fave! I've never had octopus so incredibly tender. None of that chewiness that comes with calamari. Not much else stood out, though the potatoes were well roasted.\n\n~~PIZZA~~\n* Funghi - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a-16-san-francisco?select=waK92Cv-AvuV8dfxcfdRCg#B3G2pot2Oe-PIx-HzYP5Sw\n(mushrooms, smoked mozzarella, grana padano, dandelion greens, garlic, oregano, olive oil. $19)\nNicely done, but I personally like pizza w/ tomato sauce. This was much heavier on savory/mushroom flavors. I thought the mushrooms were a little chewy; I prefer it to be softer as a topping.\n\n~~PASTA~~\n* Maccaronara - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a-16-san-francisco?select=waK92Cv-AvuV8dfxcfdRCg#uzIelyn6l53wIlFYD-KYyg\n(ragu napoletana, house-made ricotta salata. $11/$19)\nI like the thick noodles, but too al dente for me. I didn't get to eat this right when it came out so maybe it wasn't quite fresh/warm. The sauce seemed light, less flavorful than before. Good but no wow factor.\n\n* Ricotta gnocchi - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a-16-san-francisco?select=waK92Cv-AvuV8dfxcfdRCg#m6eSZQehONMOb_CvSksTRQ\n(devil's gulch rabbit sugo, cherry tomatoes, fennel, dandelion greens, grana padano. $13/$21)\nIn general I've realized ricotta gnocchi isn't for me: it's softer & comes apart more easily than regular gnocchi, which is more solid/chewy. That being said, out of the ricotta gnocchis I have had this is the best & comes closest to the texture of regular gnocchi. It still has that airy texture, though. The ragu was good but there was so little of it - just one pile in the corner, & same w/ the greens!\n\n~~ENTREES~~\n* Lucky dog ranch sirloin steak - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a-16-san-francisco?select=waK92Cv-AvuV8dfxcfdRCg#sjqPPp6qXM8vQIidTGL0Cw\n(cipolinis, scarlett turnips, baby carrots. $26)\nThe meat: very tender, well done. The outside could use a bit of char. Each piece was pretty homogeneous in texture w/ a little pink in the middle. This was like modern & small-portioned American comfort food - no pop in flavor, but good quality & well cooked.\n\n* Berkshire pork chop - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a-16-san-francisco?select=waK92Cv-AvuV8dfxcfdRCg#Ra0ZrvRF3_5dl0a8w0MK5Q\n(roasted peach mostarda, toasted hazelnuts, wild arugula. $28)\nTried a bite - really liked it, like the unique peach flavor.\n\n~~SIDES~~\n* Sweet corn - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a-16-san-francisco?select=waK92Cv-AvuV8dfxcfdRCg#Ia4KQuoZgTDZNxY_c6dweg\n(black pepper, olive oil. $7)\nSimple yet amazing! Love the char, & it's super sweet & juicy w/ a kick from the pepper.\n\n* Mixed baby lettuces - 3 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a-16-san-francisco?select=waK92Cv-AvuV8dfxcfdRCg#YqFSbdQk9fd6hAfLNGr4_g\n(radish, lemon vinaigrette. $7)\nNothing special, couldn't even taste the vinaigrette.\n\n~~DESSERT~~\nDessert menu: \n* Pistachio panna cotta w/ Dirty Girl strawberries ($9) - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a-16-san-francisco?select=waK92Cv-AvuV8dfxcfdRCg#OAxwCtHdTBr1dNFxDx28kQ\nI like the slight pistachio flavor. Strawberries: fresh! Texture: a little too gelatin-like & jiggly, definitely could be softer. Crackers were like Pirouettes, added good texture, they snap yet are soft.\n\n* Blueberry bread pudding w/ vanilla gelato & Dry Creek peaches ($9) - 3 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a-16-san-francisco?select=waK92Cv-AvuV8dfxcfdRCg#pH21fTOpInbkM4HSLqY5iw\nTexture: more solid than soft, not my style. Blueberries were sweet - I wish it were more tart to contrast the sweetness of the rest of the dessert. The peaches provide that a little. Ice cream: fantastic!", "author": "Ziyan C."}

This was my second time dining here and it was as fabulous in service and quality as I remembered it when there in 2013.  We started with a luscious burrata with crostini, followed by hearty white beans then a creamy bucatini.  We split the roasted chicken entree that was beautifully presented, unbelievably moist and so tasty.  Just 1 disappointment was their incredibly delicious sweet corn side dish was discontinued on the menu.  Fancy pizzas are also offered and popular with customers.  Their wine list is extensive and mostly Italian so we chose a Primitivo.  A16 attracts an attractive crowd from those out for a casual night to sharp suits walking in after work.  I highly recommend dining here when in San Francisco but remember to secure a reservation since this place is popular and gets packed quickly.", "author": "Kelly P."}

This place rides on it's coattails of having a great wine list...BUT the food doesn't even come close as a match to their wine list.  Shame on Shelley L.  She should definitely pay more attention to food prep.  First I ordered a pasta dish and it was so chewy---almost like chewing gum and way under-cooked I couldn't take but the first bite and had to return it.  My waiter was very nice and suggested I try a pizza...same thing!!!  So undercooked and chewy that I couldn't imagine anyone enjoying such a dish.  Dough was not cooked and impossible to cut (with shears), let along chew.  I had no choice but to return this as well and felt bad...not just for having to do this twice, but because this restaurant was such a huge disappointment.  Maybe Shelley should concentrate more on her chefs, cooking, food, rather than her exemplary wine list and not open more restaurants (Oakland, etc.) until she's got it down right in her first place.\nI'm a food critic and sorry but no way I would recommend this to anyone...and it was not this bad on my previous visit.", "author": "Louise S."}

All aspects of our dining experience were awful.\n\nOur server was inattentive and unhelpful. My girlfriend is sensitive to gluten. When we finally flagged the server down and asked the server to point out the items on the list that are GF, he repeatedly told us, \"the menu is straightforward\" and \"it is very simple.\"... Besides the fact that we were asking him a question and he never answered it, the menu is written in mostly Italian (i.e. a foreign language!). Even though my girlfriend had taken quite a few Italian classes in college, we still could not wholly decipher the menu, and this guy's idea of helping was to insist that it is simple enough for us to figure out on our own..\n\nThey have no beer on tap and an extremely poor selection of bottled/canned beers... Furthermore, he took our $7 canned beer (yea, out of a can for 7 bucks...), cracked it open and sloshed it in to the cup creating a foamy mess all over.\n\nOn top of overpriced pizza, they nickle and dime you for additional toppings (since when do I have to pay extra to have my pizza come with cheese on it? And if that was the case, wouldn't you explain that what your \"simple\" menu means by pizza is actually just bread with some sauce on it??) \n\nThe pizza comes uncut with a pair of scissors. This was new to me and came off as gimmicky to our whole party.\n\nOf the two pizzas we ordered, we finished neither due to the bland flavor. We asked the bus boy for a box so we could take it home to the dog. He then grabbed our plates as if to clear the table. We stopped him to remind him that we JUST said we would like a box. He looked me in the eye and said no problem and cleared the plates. That was the last I ever saw the pizza. We waited about 10 minutes for the waiter or busboy to come by to ask what was up but they never came by. At this point we had already paid, decided to cut our losses and took off. \n\nAs we left, we walked right by the manager and host who were too caught up in their conversation and their phones to respond to my \"goodnight\" or help the 2 parties that were standing right in front of them waiting to be seated..\n\nI often avoid dining in the marina as I usually find the food/experience is no where near worth the cost of its trendy restaurants. This experience has only reinforced this opinion\n\nTLDR:\n\nToo expensive, lacking flavor, small portions, staff is no good and the menu is weak. We will not be returning.", "author": "Jimmy C."}

It's a long place that has several areas: the cozy bar (typically jammed at peak hours), a no man's land on the other side of the bathroom door dividing wall, the rear dining area, and the covered min-patio outside. There's also a nice long counter, where you can watch the chef's do their thing. Love this option, but it can get a bit hot if you're too close to the wood burning pizza oven.\n\nSpeaking of the pizza, it is is very good, but the other dishes deserve even more merit. I had the roast chicken the other night, with a super good burrata to start. Their pasta dishes are on point, and the mostly Italian wine list is worth exploring. It's the kind of place that can take something as simple as cannellini beans or corn, send them to the pizza oven, and elevate them to a much higher level. Granted, it can get packed. But once you're in, you feel like you've found something very cool. Trust me, you'll go back.", "author": "Tom M."}

We had dinner with friends at A16 last night after talking the place up to them, having had a fantastic experience twice in the past. We were seated promptly upon arrival at our reserved time. They were clearly short-staffed last night, which is not the server's fault, however it made for a less than pleasant experience that was not cheap. We are familiar with the cost of dinner at A16, so were expecting to treat ourselves. We waited at least 45 minutes before the server was able to return to take orders for food. I felt badly for the server, as she was so hurried and clearly not in a good mood. We then asked for a decanter for the wine, which of course took awhile. The server was so hurried that she brought the decanter and instantly started topping our glasses off right away even though we wanted to allow the wine to open up a bit. \n\nThe food was tasty, everyone liked their meals and we enjoyed the burrata appetizer. But the service really soured our evening. I felt embarrassed having selected the restaurant for our special night out with friends. By the time the dessert menus were tossed in front of us, no one was really in the mood to spend more money after feeling like the staff was miserable. \n\nThis is not intended to scold the waitstaff - as it is awful to be short staffed - although it wouldn't have hurt to have given us a warm/sincere apology or explanation. We may also have been more understanding if a manager perhaps had come around to apologize, or even if they had dropped off a complimentary few olives or biscotti as a gesture. \n\nUnfortunately, we had been looking forward to this dinner for a few weeks and I know that our friends are unlikely to return, given the experience. I am not sure that we will return either, as it seems A16 is simply riding on their reputation.", "author": "Anne Y."}

I may have waited a bit past my reservation time once or twice, because this happens to popular restaurants, but never a serious gaffe or miss on the food.\n\nA16 offers delicious, soulful Italian food and a fantastic wine list. It is not cheap, but is well priced for its quality and great for sharing in couples or groups. The burrata appetizer and the pizzas are my staples (guests cut their own the pizza with pizza scissors, which is just fun). The pizza crust is thin enough to allow the toppings to shine, but also substantial. Pastas are super solid as well. I've never had reason to order the mains!\n\nThe wine list might be a thick black binder, but the somms are far from pretentious - and they are super knowledgeable. I highly recommend leaning on them, regardless of whether you are going BTG or bottle, and regardless of how much you know about wine (they will still work magic with just a color and a price range).

Not to mention, not exactly the vibe we were going for for our birthday dinner - which I had specified when I made the reservation. Thankfully they agreed to reseat us and about 10 minutes later we got our new table.\n\nService, while friendly, was very slow and a hostess had to take care of taking our orders and bringing us water as our waitress couldn't.\n\nWhile the food is good - I love the burrata (but come on, it's cheese) and their pasta noodles are divine, it's so not worth the snooty attitude at the door and the \"oh we're so packed and sexy\" vibe of the place. It's clear they place more value on maintaining that Manhattan-ish vibe than actually caring for their customers.", "author": "Rachel L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-07-06", "description": "I hate to give a low rating to any restaurant. But in this city there isn't an excuse to serve mediocre food at any price. Unfortunately, our party of 9 unanimously agreed that none of us would recommend or return to A16. \n\nThe Good: The staff was great. They graciously accommodated a last minute addition to our party - so nice!! The place was packed, but we still received pleasant, prompt attention from the plate servers, waiters, bussers, etc. Our waiter gave a delish wine suggestion. The burratta and panzanella salad were very good. \n\nThe Bad: Our party of 9 (including 3 kids) ordered a lot of food. The pasta was fresh, but all 3 dishes were very bland. One of the kids ordered an anchovy-caper-olive pasta and said \"this tastes like plain kid pasta!\" She was right - totally bland. As was the lamb sugo, which uses lamb only to flavor the sauce, so it looks - and importantly tasted - like plain \"kids\" marinara sauce. When we expressed our disappointment with the 3 pastas, the staff was kind enough to substitute with the seafood pasta plate. It was overpoweringly fishy, yet somehow lacked flavor. The chicken meatball dish (which I think was over $30 for 5 small balls) had no sauce, instead served with an odd eggplant, raisin, nut \"caponata\" - waaaay too sweet. The meatballs were overcooked so sauce would have been welcome. If properly cooked the meatballs would have been tasty. The potato and cannelloni bean sides likewise lacked flavor. The cheese pizza was good, but really soggy on the inside. \n\nAmbiance: The restaurant is extremely noisy so you really can only hear the person next to or right across from you We sat at a long table at the bench wall, parallel to the stools at the kitchen bar. Those sitting in chairs at the aisle were constantly bumped by people and staff passing by - there really isn't enough room to comfortably sit there. \n\nValue: The pasta is offered in 2 sizes, and the \"small\" was shockingly small. In fact, all food portions were small. The prices were high, not in proportion to the small serving size or the quality of food. We all left somewhat hungry and very disappointed.", "author": "Robin G."}

It's cozy without being cramped. It's busy without feeling overwhelming. It's laid back and everyone is there to spend time with loved ones and friends.\n\nService - The whole staff is on point. The wait staff is always nearby and are checking in (but not too much). The water glasses are never empty. Really on point service.\n\nFood - Their pizza is where it's at. My girlfriend and I usually get an appetizer and split a pizza and are satisfied. Honestly if you're looking to get full your bill might get a bit up there. If you're reasonable on the ordering you can make it out of here without dropping stacks. The desserts are so good too.

We came back after 45 minutes and the line was forming. \n\nI understand reservations come first which is fine ( no point in having a bad attitude for dinner). The hostess definitely tried her best to help us but it was the male floor manager that is earning this 1star review for this establishment. \n\nAs people piled in, my mother and I overheard that there was another party of 3 without reservation and would have to wait 15-20 minutes (we were also a party of 3). We followed up multiple times that we have been waiting, and we see many free tables. The floor manager was very rude saying \"this is a busy restaurant what do you expect?\" And he couldnt have cared less about sitting my family. To make matters worst, the family after us got seated before us! The first thing I did was blame my mother for nagging the manager and that's probably why they got seated first but I don't think that's the case, he clearly was not professional. I can't help to feel that he judged us based on how we looked like ( Asians that have sport wear on) and probably assumed we wouldn't be contributing to his paycheck. Of course I don't want to say this is the reason but it makes you wonder.\n\nAfter bugging him some more he seemed fed up and set up a tall table ( that seats 2) with an extra chair...that was empty this entire time we were waiting. He could have done that in the beginning, saved himself from the headache and us wasting our time!\n\nNow to review food.

We selected a wine that would go well with the starchy gnocchi and the panna bianco pizza. Think sharp cheese with creamy white sauce. We didn't want a heavy red but definitely wanted a red. This restaurant does not have any wines from Northern Italy so it was a bit tough when there's no Chianti or Barolo on the wine list. \n\nWe chose a wine from the Mount Etna region - ashy, smoky, floral notes and complex but not heavy. The pairing with the smoked pork on the gnocchi was truly inspired. \n\nThe wine: 2012 Passo Pisciaro Contrada Guardiola. $105 per bottle. The entree was $22. The Pizza was $17 or $18. Food portions are small - but that's authentic Italian and wonderful if you want to try several small plates. \n\nFor dessert we had the pistachio semi-freddo (semi frozen) pie with rosewater meringue. Melt in your mouth. To say it was delicious does not give it justice. \n\nWhy only 4 stars? It was noisy.

This is one of my favorite all-around restaurants in SF, and one of my top 2 or 3 pizzas in the city (or anywhere for that matter).  A-16 is almost always busy in the evenings, and does a nice lunch business certain days of the week, so plan ahead.\n\nI have never had a bad experience here.  Most frequently I order pizzas, but I move around the menu as well.  There is some rotation of items based on seasons, but there always seems to be their 'maccaronara' pasta which is essentially a very thick and tasty noodle. I have also tried gnocchi and squid ink tonnarelli when they appear on the menu, and they are both wonderful dishes.  Starters- the burrata is almost always on the menu and a winner.  I've also had a wonderful tuna conserva dish and a pepper dish which was a special.  Everything is delicious.\n\nAll of the pizzas are great- their crust is exceptional. They execute the 'thin' neopolitan style to perfection- with a nice light char on the bottom, not too chewy nor too crispy.  My personal favorite is pomodorro pizza with cherry tomatoes and ricotta cheese (no sauce).  The margarita is wonderful as well, and the fungi is another personal favorite of mine.  You will definitely wind up having random A-16 pizza cravings after your first experience which will inevitably draw you back for more.\n\nFInally, the desserts- try the chocolate budino.  It is a great chocolate cake with a savory touch of sea salt and olive oil which will make your mouth water.  I have tried other items which rotate on and off the menu, and they were all excellent, but this one is 'always' ordered at my table when I visit.\n\nIn summary, A-16 is always superb, as evidenced by the very busy and energetic crowds piling into the place and clogging the doorway at the bar waiting for a seat.  So may call it a scene, but scenes don't last long in SF unless the food works, and A-16 has been around too long to still live off of 'social status'. Make a reservation 1 week ahead for a 'premium' time or shoot for day-of after 9pm.  Be prepared to wait if you just pop in, but who knows, maybe you will get lucky.  A-16 most favorably compares to Flour+Water- and there are a lot of similarities between the two.  I take A-16 for pizzas and F+W for pastas, but both execute everything on the menu in a superior, no-lose manner.  Please enjoy A-16- I always do....", "author": "Andy S."}

And the waiters are polite and helpful. But I was disappointed in the food...\n\nMy party shared some appetizers like the bread and cheese with honey which were okay. We ordered some pasta dishes which were also just okay. The pasta was undercooked and needed seasoning. I rarely eat salty foods and never need to season anything when I go to restaurants so I found that surprising. For the main course I had the short rib plate. It costed $36 for the plate. When they served it to me I was shocked to see that it wasn't any bigger than any of the appetizers. This was a joke I literally finished it in 3 bites. It was tiny and extremely over priced.

The style tends to be like traditional Italian style in Italy: the sauce & other ingredients are only there to enhance the taste of the pasta itself. This works in Italy because the ingredients are bursting with flavor given how amazing the produce are in Italy. But it just didn't happen here. I had the Squid Ink Cavatelli with oven roasted cherry tomatoes, sicilian tuna heart, upland cress, fried breadcrumbs. It was pretty good, but I didn't love the tuna heart - it was a bit too mushy for my taste and the fried breadcrumbs, usually a great addition for puttanesca sauce, just didn't add that much here. One needs the spiciness and acidity in the sauce to cut through some of taste of the breadcrumb, here the cherry tomatos were not enough to counter the additional carb/grease brought on by the breadcrumb. My friend had the special pasta and I would have to give the similar opinion on that one as well.", "author": "Rebecca C."}

While the burrata was very good, the plate that showed up for us to share was absolutely tiny. It literally looked like a half order and both of us were shocked with the size. Especially since we looked around and saw others eating much larger plates. We waited for the bill after splitting the tiny dish assuming that the bill would show it as a half order in error but no, $25 for a tiny plate to share. Absolutely atrocious.

My wife and I arrived at 6:30 for our 6:30 reservation and the hostess told us we would be seated shortly and so we moved aside to wait.  While waiting I decided to ask if the Chef's counter was available and the hostess gave me a nasty snarl of a look and then said \"No, we are fully booked at the counter.\"  The response was fine but the look she shot at me is what inspired the saying \"if looks could kill.\"  Hey, I understand you are stressed, the restaurant is busy but I am the customer not the enemy and not sure what warranted that look.\n\nNow another couple comes in and we are still waiting, they check in with the hostess and are seated immediately.  Ahhh, what just happened?  My wife and I look at each other in disbelief.  Why would they be seated before us?  Seems she did not like my question about the Chef's counter and now we suffer the consequences.\n\nAfter 15 minutes we are seated and the rest of the evening goes fairly well as our server was fantastic and quite helpful with the wine list.

We ordered a water melon salad appetizer which was light and delicious...I would order this again. \n\nThe coolest part about A16 is that you are given a pair of metal sheers to cut and slice your pizza with....it doesn't come pre-sliced. Though this was strange at first, it turned to be a fun and cool way to make it a memorable experience...the shears are pretty nifty and are good at ripping slices apart. \n\nWe ordered the Fungi pizza and the Romana pizza. Fungi was okay but a bit overly done with the mushrooms (as I guess is to be expected). The romana pizza was good and had a nice smoky crust which I enjoyed, but a bit blander and less salty than expected (olives, anchovies, etc) I ordered without the chiles, so maybe that had something to do with the seemingly missing kick of flavor.", "author": "Ronnie S."}

I bookmarked the restaurant and thought when the time came round for my next trip to the City, I'd stop by for a taste of the fine South Italian cooking they are known for.  (Later I would learn this Food network special is very outdated, as Nate is now working in NYC)  \n\nFast forward to the other evening and soon after my sis picked me up from the airport we were on the way over.  A Thursday night and while some had previously told me reservations are a must, we popped our heads in to see if a table for two would be possible.  Street parking could not be found.  Two and half blocks down the street we found a parking structure which cost $3 per hour and we were back on route.  We were offered a petite table for two or a chance to sit at the chef's table.  Heck yeah, watch delectable fare prepared and make our choices on dinner from what we see, rather than what we read off a menu.  Fo'sho.  Our waiter was forgettable and offered little to no personality within the short exchanges.  The hostess however was bright and full of smile, her warm welcome made us feel that we made the best choice for our dinner destination.  Our dinner menu consisted of:\n\nBraised artichokes with burrata and toasted pistachio.  (Starter)\n(Pizza) Salsiccia - fennel sausage, spring onions, mozzarella, tomato, grana, garlic, chilies, olive oil\n(Pasta) Maccaronara with ragu napoletana and house-made ricotta salata \n\nBoth the chef and pizza maker were before us.  We watched as fresh ingredients were applied to cause and then pie sent into the wood fired oven.  It's a lot to take in sitting there.  First time I realized why people on Food shows smile so much when sitting near to the chef during a dinner presentation.  Large pieces of meat, finely cared for, added to tasty ingredients and then cooked to perfection by the mindful watch of the skilled chef.   Sister had said she would hate to be the chef, cooking while so many watched and took photos.  I had a smile ear to ear, looking down on this beautiful cut of pork shoulder.  \n\nBack to our meal.  The pasta was tasty and not too much.  Pizza pie was excellent.  We had a few slices to go and I can report that they heated up well.  Even cold, the flavors of the sauce with the fennel sausage and garlic just equaled yum.  \n\nDue to a minor infraction with our waiter, we were about to leave without finding out whether they offered desserts.  We felt that since we weren't alike other tables ordering up wines, we were forgotten.  Which we were.  On the walk out, the hostess with the mostest was too eager to not allow us to leave without trying at least  one.  With the helpful assistance of the manager Nathan, we were introduced to a signature dessert, the Chocolate budino tart with sea salt and extra virgin olive oil and a pleasantly paired glass of moscato.  I like sweet wines and have had moscato before, but never such a fine one.  The dessert was a perfect finisher.  Sweet, then salty, than a crunchy sweet once again.  \n\nHad thought about inquiring about a bottle, but due to a bleeding parking meter had to make it back to the car.  Maybe I'll stop back and grab a bottle or I've already bookmarked it for future visits for next time.\n\nMy only complaints; no booze.  Only wines.  I would love if you guys had at least one top shelf bourbon maybe? Basil Hayden.  Also, bathrooms are only for one!  I stood in a line three men deep and joked with others, \"if that guy is dropping a deuce, this wait would be obnoxious.\"  For a Thursday night and over a thousand reviews; they are busy.  \n\nIt's best to say something to management if you feel slighted.

The rabbit pasta dish was dried out and over cooked and so was the fish.  Even the dessert was terrible.

Really pricey at $19. \n\nMy husband ordered sausage pizza for the main course. Outstanding. Great sausage. Nice crust and cheese mixture. $20. Reasonable for upscale restaurant pizza. \n\nI ordered black ink clam pasta (one of my favorite dishes). Really, how can it go wrong. Dish had about 5 or 6 of the smallest clams I've ever seen.

I rarely return anything as my husband gets really embarrassed and Im not that discriminate when I'm hungry. But yeah. I just couldn't swallow anymore after the 3 bite. \n\nSo, I send the dish back and ask if they could give me something they recommended. I didn't care what it was.

The topping combos are unique and pair excellent with their wine selection. The crust is perfectly cooked on every pizza I've ever gotten here. They switch their menu quite often and I'm always impressed with the new selection of appetizers, new antipasti dishes, and pizza extras. They focus on only southern Italian wines which I didn't know much about before but one of their  wine sommelier took the time to give us the whole run down.

The food wasn't terribly mind blowing on my end but my dates food was very tasty. We ordered the prosciutto as an appetizer, which was fine, just a pile of meat and some apple slices, not much to say about that. The entree I ordered was the squid ink pasta, which I had to send back because it wasn't cooked through enough and was very dry/bland, I think it was supposed to be al dente, but didn't quite get there. The waitress was very accommodating and swapped it out for a pizza (i figured that was a safe bet) which was tasty but nothing extraordinary. My date ordered the halibut with a side of brussel sprouts both of which were excellent and flavorful, made me wish I had just ordered that. It also gets VERY loud inside once it started to fill up, I could barely hear my date across the table talking at a normal speaking level.\n\nOverall I think this place just tries to be shishi for the sake of being so. All the menu items are every fancy specialty store term and ingredient without any kind of context, the prices are on the high end and the food wasn't bad but wasn't terribly memorable either. The ambience is really cute and charming, the waitstaff were very attentive and friendly but I doubt I'll be returning.", "author": "Jp M."}

Also, it's vegetarian friendly - my wife commented that it was a great balance and selection along with the meat and seafood dishes.\n\nWe had the arugula salad with fruit (baked grapes) and o-m-goodness, it was outstandingly tasty. And right off the bat, a simple and amazing appy set the tone for the rest of the meal.\n\nAs a half dish (a little small IMHO) was the pasta special with shaved crusted roe. This in itself was one of the most sublime and best pasta I've ever tasted. The texture and right balance of basil herb sauce and seafood was unexpectedly knock-your-socks-off good.\n\nA 16's pizzas are just outstanding - we opted for the funghi / mushroom thin crust pizza and it surpassed our expectations as well. Coming from NYC and east coast roots, I have to say that the best SF pizzas can go toe-to-toe with any pizza from Manhattan or Brooklyn. \n\nThe wine menu is incredible (and can be very very pricey). Absolutely the bill can run away from you if you're ordering wine, it's their specialty and no Bay-area restaurant can match their Italian selections. But if you want to go there for amazing food and maybe a glass or a tasty beer (Dogfish Head IPA with Syrah Must is the bomb!), a five star meal can be had for moderate price. \n\nAnother aspect that makes A 16 stand out from other restaurants is their incredible service.

However, our table wasn't ready when we arrived, which wasn't expected! We had to wait for 10-15 minutes, which was pretty annoying. When we were finally seated, we ordered:\n\n-Burrata w/Olive Oil, Sea Salt, Crostini ($12, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a-16-san-francisco?select=tDuBmXLL5PPINF_d2pn43A#tDuBmXLL5PPINF_d2pn43A): Pretty good, but not amazing.

I feel like A16 is a solid restaurant to go to for a good meal, but not somewhere you necessarily rave about. It's also really loud in the restaurant, so this isn't a good place to have an intimate conversation. Our server also seemed stretched thin, and it was hard to grab her if we needed something.

And we had the fun of cutting it ourselves with pizza scissors! \n\nOur main courses (2 had the steak, 1 the tomato pasta, 1 the short rib pasta) were perfectly cooked and tasty. There was so much food, the side dishes almost went to waste. But a second bottle of 2009 Taurasi helped!\n\nDessert - paired as suggested in the menu - was divine.

The sauce was creamy and full of depth in the trippa that I had expected the pastas to come out the same (full of flavor, creamy sauce, etc.). The pastas were quite the opposite, as the sauce was watery and disappointing. The texture of the pasta was firm, but nearly anything to write home about.

A friend of mine had recommended this place, so we made the trek from where we were staying to check it out. We were running 10 minutes late for our reservation so I called to let the restaurant know. The gentleman who answered said it was no problem and that they'd have something for us right when we arrived. When we got there, we were seated at a bar for dinner. I politely asked the hostess who sat us, who claims she was the manager, if there was a table since we had a reservation and she said they didn't have any tables. I again told her I had a reservation and she says \"yes and you guys were late and we are still accommodating you.\" Wow.\n\nI usually give people the benefit of the doubt, but she could have cared less about the situation and was unprofessional and rude. I explained to her how far out I booked the reservation, that we were in from out of town and really looking forward to dining with them and she says \"well you'll still have the same experience.\" Umm wrong answer sweetheart. We decided to leave and on our way out I walked up to her and told her I was really disappointed in the way she handled the situation and she didn't even know what to say. And if she really was the manager, I suggest the owner think twice about the representation in the front of the house. I will never go back or recommend this place.

It was really cool to see how the restaurant ambiance changes as afternoon shifts to evening. The natural white light that pours through from the sliding glass doors and skylights gradually changes to softer yellows, kudos for the designer of this restaurant. \nOnto the food. Eating buddy really knows how to order, and she requested that they put sausage on only half the pizza, so we could get a taste of it with and without toppings, very smart!\n\nWe ordered the following dishes:\nOctopus salad with potato and olives\nBucatini pasta\nPig head pasta\nMargherita pizza with half fennel sausage\nSignature chocolate budino tart with sea salt & extra virgin olive oil\n\nThe margherita here was very solid. In my humble opinion it stacked up very well against Delfina (not an easy task), the only difference being the sauce was a little bit saltier and the crust was just a tad more heavy. At that point, it's just a matter of personal preference.\n\nThe octopus salad was a nice starter, balancing the lighter thin sliced seafood with tiny potatoes. The bucatini pasta is their signature pasta that was good enough to overcome eating buddy's aversion to thick pastas. It was a small sized but hearty tasting portion perfect for sharing. I also enjoyed the pig head pasta which was unique, with flakes of meat that almost reminded me of a more savory version of cooked tuna. By the time we got to dessert, the signature chocolate budino tart was a great cap to the whole meal. \n\nNeeded a short walk around Chestnut after the meal to get the juices flowing but overall it a great time at one of the cutest restaurants in the Marina.", "author": "Mark Y."}

The place is much bigger that it looks from the outside and also has a covered patio which looked lovely.\n\nWe are vegetarians ordered a half carafe of an Italian wine that our server recommended, and three dishes: the lemon zest ricotta gnocchi with green garlic and morel mushrooms, the bucatini with walnut pesto, and the funghi pizza.\n\nThe short version? Ignore the pasta and just go with the pizza\n\nThe longer version:\nAfter we had placed our order, we overheard a group nearby complain among themselves about the bucatini dish they had ordered; they sent the dish back saying that it was \"too al dente\" and \"they were excellent chefs and so they knew the difference\". Immediately, tucked in our corner, we started judging and ridiculing these people who clearly didn't know what al dente was and who basically were demanding limp pasta. But then, our dish came. And there were crunchy parts-- like literally uncooked parts, especially at the ends of the noodles. And we discussed in hushed tones our options-- stop eating and have the dish cleared? Finish it and spit out the tough noodle sections? Or... send it back? But if we sent it back did we want it replaced? What if they overcook it to compensate? As you can imagine, this was quite the dinner conversation/ dilemma. Eventually we decided yes, it would be sent back, and yes, we would want it replaced. And everyone in the restaurant was gracious about it even though we felt bad and couldn't quite meet their eyes the rest of the time we were there. And frankly, even when cooked right, the flavors of the dish didn't impress us, and we wished we had ordered something else. The gnocchi was a similar story-- fine, but not amazing, though cooked perfectly.\n\nThen the pizza came out, in it's full glory with the cutting scissors and all. Covered in mushrooms with a delicious smoky cheese and accompanied by chili oil, we were in love with it from the first bite. The crust had the perfect chew. The chili oil had a nice kick. The mushrooms were plentiful and fantastic.\n\nThe verdict: Perhaps yes we'd be back to eat pizza, and pizza alone.

We came from Philadelphia and were really psyched to try this place.  The food was great, the chefs behind the glass were pleasant and engaging, but our waiter was a total jerk. He made us feel inadequate when we asked questions about the menu, never asked us how we liked our meal,( the busboy did and the chef did), and he was no where to be found when we needed water desperately from the spicy chili sauce.   The chefs brought us water and even smiled that we asked them and not the waiter.  I will tell you as a frequent restaurant goer, I have never been treated like that anywhere. The meal was pricey and we would not have minded but the haute,snobbish attitude from the waiter destroyed our experience. Would not recommend this place at all.", "author": "Carole B."}

On a Sunday night, every seat in the house was occupied, so MAKE a reservation.\n\nThe kitchen did an amazing job of turning out our dishes fast and hot. I usually prefer the food not to come out all at once, but we were hungry so on to the food we go! \n\nThe special app of the night was a bruschetta with pureed fava bean on a thick cut rustic bread with a thinly shaved pecorino cheese on top. Is it worth $4/piece? I would say it's a delicious starter, with hints of lemon and mint, but it could be priced lower.\n\nThe roasted calamari with agretti, Sicilian cucunci, basil and orange agrumato was pretty in presentation and wonderful in the mouth. I loved the freshness of the calamari.\n\nOur Funghi pizza had generous roasted mushrooms, smoked mozzarella, grana, garlic, oregano and olive oil.  The peppery arugula that topped this pizza lends an interesting note to the smoky mozz.  It was absolutely tasty, though the crust was not crisp enough to our liking.\n\nI've been in a pasta mood lately and the squid ink tonnarelli didn't disappoint.  It had Manila clams cooked in white wine, capers and garlic. A little heavy handed on the salt, but the pasta was al dente. It's also not stated on the menu, but this dish had a little kick to it from the red pepper flakes.\n\nThe polenta had a slightly crispy outer layer and moist interior.  A nice side dish to our meal. \n\nEven though we were close to being full, we couldn't pass up on dessert: a chocolate budino tart with sea salt and olive oil.  I've noticed the sea salt/olive oil theme popping up in a lot of dessert menus in SF, rightfully so, since the flavors really work together: the olive oil adds another dimension taste-wise and the salt brings out the chocolate flavors.  A16's version is fantastic, a chocolate pudding sitting atop a tart -- the crust is slightly crumbly and the pudding itself hints of bittersweet chocolate.\n\nService was efficient and unobstrusive, perfect for 3 ladies who just want to catch up on gossip!\n\nA16 still has room for improvements, but having a reliable restaurant in the Marina that features Southern Italian cuisine, well, that's another reason why they're so popular.", "author": "Janice C."}

This was not my first time, here but it is my last!\nThis restaurant is a highly regarded busy place and it is difficult to get a reservation.\nEvening started great with a parking spot in front. Early reso @ 5:30 so it was not busy, which was also a plus. \n\nWaiter was training someone and initially was very available. The Italian wine list was a challenge, but the sommelier was there to help make a suggestion. I was with a friend and we only wanted a half carafe. We asked for a taste, before we made our decision, and he ignored my question until I pressed on and asked again! He finally acquiesced, need I say, reluctantly......Really?\n\nWe had to flag down the waiter to order a 3 course meal that we shared. \nWithin 5 mins. The appetizer shows up at the table, brought by a \"runner\". No wine yet. I mention to my friend, I hate when the food comes before the wine, so that the runner would hear me and help. She walked back to the open kitchen line and stands there? Eventually, the sommelier sees the situation and asks the \"runner\" to bring the wine? Upon her return to our table, she acted as if  it was her idea to help us out, as she mentions this to us as she serves our wine?.........Really? She was instructed to do so, disingenuous?\n\nFood was so disappointing!  Calamari appetizer with creamy polenta lacked any real flavor. The polenta was more like a sauce, not taste or texture,and just yellow. If blindfolded, you would not know what you are eating. Pork spiedini was 2 skewers with 3, 1 inch squares pieces of meat over arugula for $32. We were sharing, so basically we each had 3 bite sized pieces of pork! It was dry and over cooked and had to ask for extra sauce to combat the dryness! Even the prickly pear sorbet was mediocre. It was overly sweet, and with no discernible flavor.\n \nWe are both gluten free, so it was difficult to find much we could eat. They were very smug that this is an \"old school Italian place\" and there were no gluten free options. I guess they are busy enough to leave out a faction of gluten intolerant people, that is their choice, I get that!\n\nI will never go back again. I think it is not worth the price and hype!

Originally offered a seat at the Chef's counter only to have the suggestion soon rescinded it was not until nearly thirty-five minutes later that I was informed that the bar was 'first come, first serve, full service' and having watched seats come and go along with another long-delayed duo it would be ten minutes more before we each procured a seat - my new friends suddenly a silver lining allowing for me to over-order and share.  Still jostled from behind as more potential patrons packed the front foyer it was from the bartender that plates would soon be ordered and although substantial delays persisted to the point of being gifted a complimentary plate of creamy gnocchi I have to say the food universally justified the hassles.  Conceptually based in the cuisine of Campania it was with warm semolina bread and clean, fruity olive oil that the meal got started and with aforementioned gnocchi understatedly herbal and aromatic it was with course two that flavors began to 'pop' - the tender tripe fully embracing a sauce of acid and wine prior to a reference standard Margherita whose springy crust bubbled up in pecan wood char with just enough aged cheese to enliven hand-crushed tomatoes and fresh-pulled mozz.  Again finding myself solo as bar-mates turned elsewhere for more drinks it was simply illogical to me to eschew dessert and after debating a seasonal favorite against a 10-year classic the only right answer was \"both\" - the wood-oven singed puff pastry lovely and light while the dark chocolate budino proved every bit deserving of its status on many \"Best of the Bay\" lists - a light kiss of salt serving to enliven the fruitiness of the oil and accentuate the subtle sweetness of an otherwise intense finale.", "author": "Michael U."}

This restaurant really served that up in heaps. \n\nFirst, the price for NYE prix fixe was reasonable (I think around 125 each, and the average for sf is close to 250), and we managed to get a reservation on the day-of NYE (litchrally impossible) because of a last minute cancellation after which they immediately called us and offered us the slot. Points for reaching out to US instead of having us call back and check.\n\nCan't remember what we ate, aside from it being \"legit\" dinner food and not pizza, I just remember raving about every single thing. Delectable meal. We wanted wine, and their wine menu is a frickin novel, so we had the sommelier come and make recommendations, and whatever he chose was the most unbelievable red wine I've ever had, according to me (love red wine and have tried lots of quality wine in Europe and South America) as well as my bf (thinks he hates red wine because all he knows is Franzia).  \n\nThe environment inside was romantic and intimate -- enough noise that everyone was having a good time, but pretty tame and we could hear each other -- and dim strategic lighting set a really date-y mood. Also, the way the staff treats you really does improve every aspect of the experience. My bf and I look younger than we are (and we're in our mid-20s), so I always expect people can tell we're un-fancy and will treat us like the wannabes we are, but every single person in this resto (and especially the sommelier!) treated us like the President and First Lady, pampering our every whim.

Had a 9pm reservation for 2 and they tried seating me in their section right off the bar at a high table with bar seats. It's a really uncomfortable area and I'm really surprised they try to seat people with reservations there. I asked to be reseated and by about 9:15 I was seated towards the back of the restaurant, which is much better. We had a beet salad, which was just OK and a pizza, which again, was just OK. The food took far too long and we walked out the door at 10:45. This is a really sexy place but lacks substance and flavor. Might try it again in about a year.", "author": "Alex C."}

Everyone greeted us nicely, the server was very knowledgeable about both the wines and the menu items, and she was extraordinarily gracious (and helpful) in finding a new wine when the first one didn't turn out as we expected.\n\nThe entrees were disappointing.  One of us had a sirloin steak, which, despite being ordered medium rare was dried out and tough.

I kept looking around for the video cameras & for someone to pop out & let me in on the joke.  It never happened, this was the unfortunate true reality.  OK, it was a Tuesday night, so maybe we got the \"B\" or \"C\" team, but it was more like the \"Z\" team, for Zombies.  This used to be our go to place to bring out of towners to.  Now I wish that I had gone out of town myself instead.  Unfortunately we did bring friends from out of town here tonight, party of 6. How frigging embarrassing the whole experience was.  It was like the restaurant was being run by a gaggle of stressed out high schoolers.  Not one smile or apologetic statement for what was truly the worst restaurant experience I've had in 4-5 years.  50 minutes after ordering our entrees, 5 out of our six party members finally received their meals.  3 very average trout dinners, one bland and unappealing chicken dish (was supposed to be roasted, but they brought the meatballs instead), a gnocchi dish that was about 9 rubber balls floating in some dirty water with chunks of tomatoes, and we waited for the 6th entree (pasta in squid ink sauce), and we waited, and we waited........ 20 minutes later some lady dropped a small goat cheese pizza that no one wanted on our table and proclaimed \"this is our present to you\", no further explanation.  So we asked, \"where's our 6th entree?\", some mumbling ensued that none of us could understand.  All of a sudden we became the invisible table.  No one met our eyes, no one came by to explain or apologize.  A full 35 minutes after our first 5 entrees had arrived (and someone in our party sought out what passed as management), and everyone else was done pecking at their substandard food, the pasta dish finally arrived with the magnanimous gesture \"we will comp\" this entree.  We all rolled our eyes, asked for the still very overpriced check, and skidaddled ASAP.  There are no excuses for this type of service and food quality from what used to be one of our favorite restaurants.  Sure, we might have hit an off night, but this was equivalent to waiting for 2 hours at the dentist, and then being poked in the eye while he pulls your teeth out.

Although the food was good, the bartender is really what made this experience so great! We will DEFINITELY be back in the near future!!", "author": "Marisa R."}

The food was fine, the service was good, and the atmosphere was parochial from a design stand point.  All of that said, nothing stood out to me as noteworthy and I can't imagine going back unless someone else planned it (especially because I live on the East Coast).  The place was packed and loud as well...so either this is a fantastic location or San Franciscans aren't privy to good Italian on the west coast.", "author": "Tyler L."}

Three stars for the food might be a little generous.  I wasn't impressed, but the food wasn't bad either.\n\nPartook of the burrata cheese drizzled with olive oil, the funghi neapolitan pizza, ricotta gnocchi with guinea hen sugo, and the blueberry hazelnut cake with apricots for dessert.  For two of the dishes I ordered here I've ordered similar dishes elsewhere in SF which were just more memorable -- Luce's burrata was amazing and Zero Zero's Fillmore was a more enjoyable mushroom pizza.\n\nOverall, the food was fine though I probably won't be rushing back any time soon, value is decent, atmosphere is nice, and our waitress was excellent -- attentive and professional.\n\n(Second review in a row for a restaurant named after a road in Europe.

We were seated in kind of an awkward location, but it ended up working out ok. \n\nThey don't have a full bar but do have wine/beer.  We brought a few bottles, and they actually did free corkage as long as we ordered a bottle from their list.   We ordered all the food family style, which I highly recommend...\n\nStarters:\n- Burrata: house made, could have used a bit more salt, but very fresh, good on crostini (you can ask for extra crostini since there's much more burrata than bread)\n- Octopus: braised, with sweetness from cubanelle peppers. The potatoes were flavorful, but I loved the braised pear in the dish\n- Arugula salad: generous size, great for sharing. Lots of greens piled up, topped with pluots, peaches, fried almonds, and pecorino. The dressing was surprisingly light\n- Zuppa de zuca: not exactly for sharing, but it's a pretty big sized bowl. It's a light, summer soup (broth based).\n\nPizzas: i like that they give you shears to cut your own, which makes it more fun. Also, try the chili oil with the pizzas!\n- Funghi: lots of mushrooms, would have been nice with the proscuitto add on.  Too bad they didn't have truffles or truffle oil\n- Margherita: the true test of a pizza place. It was sweet from the tomatoes, and you can upgrade to mozzarella de bufala for $4 more\n- Salsiccia: tons of mozzarella, fennel sausage, greens - nice and meaty \n\nPastas: \n- Buccatini: Incanto had made me fall in love with tuna heart.  The one here is lighter, but the pasta texture is better - very al dente\n- They also made a vegetarian version of the buccatini for my mom, which had more tomatoes\n- Gnocchi with braised rabbit: the gnocchi texture was ok for me, but the braised rabbit was pretty amazing. It was lean but very flavorful, light and hearty at the same time\n- Squid ink tonnarello: al dante, great texture, loved the dark squid ink. There was also braised squid, fried breadcrumbs, with a nice hint of lemon and garlic\n\nEntrees/sides: \n- Steak: medium rare, good to share if everyone wants just a little bit of meat. It was good but not extraordinary\n- Cannellini beans: creamy, not bad considering I'm not a big bean fan\n- Oven roasted broccoli: great roasted flavor, which brought out the sweetness of the broccoli, and it was just slightly caramelized. I highly recommend this one\n\nDesserts: \n- Fig sorbet: good seasonal flavor, but I didn't love it\n- Almond pound cake: with strawberries and balsamic. It was a very dense and generous portion but is good for sharing. The strawberries are like one last taste of summer. I wish it were ice cream instead of creme fraiche on top\n- It wasn't on the menu, but as they had gelato, we requested affogatos, and they were able to make them. The espresso over vanilla gelato was perfect and exactly what I needed!\n\nOur poor server was caught in the middle of a fight to pay for the bill, but he was very gracious about it. Parking can be a bit tricky around here, so you may want to give yourself a little extra time. Definitely make a reservation, and order family style!  Prices are pretty reasonable, which explains why it made the Michelin Bib Gourmand list.", "author": "Marilyn H."}

They serve the pizza with scissors for you to cut yourself, which was kinda cool. It was the perfect combination. Finally, my boyfriend's favorite was the pork fettuccine. The noodles were so fresh, the pork was super tender, and it tasted amazing. The waitress helped us decide on a bottle of wine and we went with a full, Italian red wine that she said was similar to a cab, and her recommendation was great. We both loved it.

The first was 05 or 06 so it really felt like the first time being there.  We had a reservation at 530 and were quickly sat down. \n\nAfter looking at the menu for a few mins our server came over and told us about the specials and let us look over the menu and wine list for a few more mins. The wine list here is made up of mostly southern Italian wines and therefor you will not know any of them unless you really know wine. The wine guy came over and asked if he could assist me in picking out a wine. Of course I said yes! I wanted to try a Sicilian wine so he pointed out a few that were on the page I was looking at. The first bottle he suggested was $222, the second $195, and the third $185. He picked out the three most expensive bottles on the page. Any ass can do what he did! So I quickly sent that prick on his way and picked a more reasonably priced $65 bottle, that was very good. \n\nWe then ordered  some food to share\nthe prosciutto sampler- wonderful BIG piles of two different types \nmarg pizza- everyone says you have to try and it was just ok, but eating with the prosciutto and chili paste oil made it much more enjoyable \npasta- wonderful texture, you can really tell it was house made, the sauce was a little acidic from the tomatoes for me\n\nWe each ordered our own entrees\nshe had the duck- really good flavor, faro was nice, sweetness from the pomegranate \nI went with the short rib- I'm sad to say it was the worst short rib I have ever had! The liquid it was braised in and served over was terrible. Its hard to describe because it started sweet and then finished with an almost bitter taste and was so over powering that I couldn't even taste the meet. I left well over half of it on the plate. Our server could tell there was something wrong and asked how I was doing. I said everything was good because I'm not big on sending things back to the kitchen. I know they are doing their best and it just wasn't for me.\n\nOur server was great! I wish I could remember her name because she was one of the highlights of this place. She is the only reason I didnt give a 2 star rating \n\nI guess you have to know what to order here to have a good meal because some of the stuff is just not good.\n\nOne thing that bothered me and the restaurant has no control over this was the three guys sitting next to us.

Worse they seat parties of three right next to larger parties so one person in my party of three always gets bumped during the meal by a fellow diner at the next table. These seating arrangements do not make for an enjoyable meal.\n\nThe food is good, the menu is a bit limited and a pricey for what it is.

We started with the burrata which had a very rubbery texture and little flavor.  Then we had the margherita pizza + arugula and prosciutto, which was good.  Reminded me of a lesser version of Zero Zero.  And finally we tried the house made ricotta salad.  Just a warning, this is a heavy, filling dish.  If you are sharing a few dishes, I'd recommend getting a small just to get a taste.  We learned the hard way..we got the large, then had to pass on dessert.  \nAlso, I didn't appreciate having to wait for 15 minutes for a late mid-week dinner when we had a reservation AND they weren't even busy.  It makes me think their popularity is getting to their head.\nNot planning on coming back...I'd rather try a new restaurant or go back to one of my favorites.", "author": "Gloria N."}

The atmosphere, food and service were all top notch and our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable about the entirety of the menu and the wine list, and helped us to pick a bottle that complimented our meal. I have to say that the waiter is probably the reason that I am giving this a 5 star review, but it would have been close either way.\n\nI appreciate that the pasta dishes are served in either the full entree size or a smaller portion so you can get a pasta item as well as an entree to have the full Italian dinner experience without getting too much food or overspending.\n\nThe starters and the pizzas dominate the menu, with a few pasta and entree choices. We started with the burrata, which was very good and ridiculously creamy. I think this is probably their top selling starter because the two tables next to us ordered it as well. Although I have heard amazing things about their pizza we decided to go the pasta route and got the Ricotta gnocchi with mushrooms and the Bucatini, which were both delicious. For my main course I had the pork chop and it was probably the best chop that I have had. If it is on the menu I would definitely recommend this.\n\nOverall a fantastic and non-rushed dinner and they gave us a free dessert - score", "author": "Frank J."}

You're not missing anything if you don't get it though.\n\nBurrata Appetizer - GREAT burrata. Served on TERRIBLE toast. I almost broke a tooth eating it.\n\nPizza - Added an egg (for $2 - robbery!). Salsiccia was not bad but one minor comment is that I hate when people cut pizzas into squares (vs triangles) because it makes the spreading of 1 tiny egg that much more difficult. And several people end up eating crust only.\n\nPasta - I had the pasta with red sauce. Loved the texture of the fresh noodles, which was significantly better and tastier than Specchio's. \n\nPork Shoulder Entree - was the first time I've ever had a pork shoulder that wasn't shredded and pulled. It was however very tasty and tender despite appearing like a pork chop of sorts.\n\nChocolate Torte - DELICIOUS. I'm always very skeptical of chocolate tortes which restaurants tend to make overly sweet and solid.

Unfortunately, they did not have any openings, so we decided to take a chance and just walk in. We walked in and I asked for a table, and the host told us that it will probably be a 40 minute wait, and we decided to wait.... but it took much longer than 40 minute and the waiting area was really cramp and stuffy. \n\nWe finally got seated and we all knew what we were going to order, since we were staring at the menu while waiting for a table. WHICH was a good thing, because we read EVERYTHING, and on the bottom it said that \"bread is served when requested\" or something like that. We would have starved to death waiting for our food if we did not have the bread. We had two bread basket while waiting for our food, cause a few of the girls were starving. The bread was okay.... it isn't warm like the bread you normally get at other restaurant, these were cold.\n\nAnyways, three of us had the Maccaronara with ragu napoletana and house-made ricotta salata , since it was on that \"100 things to try in SF\" List. One girl got Bucatini with Sicilian almond and dried san marzano pesto, mint and pecorino, and another girl got the Marinara Pizza.\n\nOut of all three of the food, I would say the pizza was the best and worth the money. The portion of the half size pasta plate was ridiculously small and it was $9.... I would say the portion was less than a pack of ramen noodle. The flavor of the pasta was good, but it wasn't anything special. The texture of the noodle reminded me of the type of noodle used in the Korean/Chinese black noodle, which I like. BUT The pizza was delicious. The dough was soft and the marinara was amazing. And that pizza was huge for $11.50. Lesson learned.... GET THE PIZZA, it tastes better and you can get full.\n\nNow to Dessert. I ordered Chestnut and espresso torta with frangelico and caramelized hazelnuts. It reminded me a lot of tiramisu, and it was really soft and fluffy. It was really good. My other friend ordered the Poached pear and frangipane crostata with anise-brown sugar gelato, and that was pretty good too. It reminded me of pie. But one of the girl said she ate something in it that tasted like licorice.... weird.... I thought it tasted fine. \n\nOverall, this place is not too bad.

It's not far from the Lombard gate.\n\nWe arrived early for our reservation, received a friendly greeting, and were seated right on time.  The back room - what looks to be a converted patio - is slightly quieter than the main dining room, though beware of the slightly sloped floor near the drain.\n\nService was generally excellent - the servers knew the menu, knew the wine, had some good suggestions, and were generally available when we needed them.  A final glass of wine arrived somewhat tardily, and we did have to send back a salad that arrived dressed when we had requested undressed, but those are minor points, cheerfully and quickly rectified.\n\nThe restaurant specializes in the regional wines of Campagna - and a lack of familiarity on my part was no impediment.  A few words about what sort of flavors I like were all that was needed to produce three glasses of delicious grapey goodness.\n\nThe food was great.  Eschewing the main courses, we had the escarole salad ( generous, good flavor ), octopus ( wonderful texture, again stunning flavor ) and a small charcuterie plate ( four selections + spicy pickles, all good ).  \n\nWe had to have a pizza, and were steered toward the Pizza Romana - a spicy and savory selection.  It was big and bold.  Spicy flavors were especially prominent, with lots of garlic and olives accented by a few pieces of anchovy here and there.  The crust was deliciously chewy, and the pizza arrived barely cut on a grid.  Good stuff.\n\nFor pasta, we were steered away from the gnocchi and in the direction of the Maccaronara - a good choice.  Thick noodles with an excellent texture and a simple yet delicious sauce.  It's no wonder they're famous for that one.  We also had a squid ink fettucine with plentiful and delicate squid parts.  The pasta was dark and flavorful, with slightly more bite than we thought appropriate.\n\nDessert - a delicious and light panna cotta won over even this panna cotta questioning diner.  The seasonal pear upside down cake was disappointingly dry, but nicely crusted with strong pear flavors.\n\nWe had a good time.

It's listed on the Bib Gourmand Guide and I've heard such good feedback from friends. \n\nThe ambiance is great, what looks like a small space from the front really opens up in the back. What they lack in width they make up with depth. Modern look with views into an open kitchen and a cool spot for a date, if you don't mind a little hustle, bustle and common noise. \n\nThe food is where A16 fell short for me. It started off strong as I shared the tonnarelli as an appetizer. The pasta noodles really surprised me, I loved the flavor and the texture, also the crab was delicious and not over powering. After the pasta appetizer, we had two pizzas the Funghi and the Margherita. The Margherita was pretty standard, great flavor and loved the crust. The Funghi is what I was really excited to try. I added prosciutto to the Funghi, and even with the addition it still did not reach my expectations.  Sometimes too much of a good thing turns bad, and that is what happened with this pizza. I found myself overwhelmed by the flavor of the mushrooms, and underwhelmed by all the other ingredients. The mushrooms were so salty it just overpowered everything. Moreover I paid $4 extra for prosciutto but did not feel as though I was getting $4 worth of prosciutto, save your money. To top it off, this place gives you shears to cut your pizza, which I for the life of me could not understand. \n\nThe takeaway comes down to this: for a reasonably priced Margherita pizza this place hits the spot. With the dressed up pizzas like the Funghi, A16 misses the mark pretty badly. But, they make it up with excellent pasta. Finally, don't leave it up to me to cut my pizza. And, if you do, at least give me the proper tool, I don't know anyone that cuts their pizza with shears.", "author": "Alex L."}

My old man recognized a particular winery and asked about that wine and the waiter responded 'Well, did you want a Ros\u00e9?...If not, then don't look at the Ros\u00e9, look at the reds'. Later, they didn't fire all of the entrees at the same time, so my pizza came out and before I was able to eat it, it was snatched away from me. I then had to wait another 20 min. No apology. Just a quick snag of my pizza and off he went.\n\nWhen it was time to leave, we asked three (3) times for the leftovers. My mom finally walked up to him at the host station and he shoved the leftover box into her gut and said 'HERE...I wasn't going to walk it back to you'. \n\nListen, this place isn't hurting for business, so perhaps they don't give a damn about the one local customer they piss off. I mentioned something to the manager, who was nice and offered to buy my a drink, but in situations like this, I'm not looking for a freebie...I just want them to treat the customers right. I was looking for a good meal and got pretty rude service in return. Their meatballs were fantastic and the wine recommendation was good...aside from that, I see no need to return here.", "author": "Erik B."}

The other night, since we had three out of town guests, we asked our neighbor, who is a wine dealer, to recommend a restaurant that would be good for five people. He said A16 was terrific, so off we went with high expectations. \n\nYes, the place offers excellent wine choices--my Pinot Noir was delicious, and reasonably priced. But the list of what's wrong with the place is long. First, it's ridiculously noisy and crowded. The tables are crammed together so that you can barely get into your seat; I'm a slim woman, but I couldn't get comfortable because my chair kept bumping into a guy seated behind me. Our table was located under a sun-roof window that could be cranked open and shut by a pole. When open, it blew so much cold air on us that our menus had to be held down by our water glasses. When we asked for it to be closed, we were hot. \n\nThe service was truly unacceptable. My husband and I arrived early, and were seated at our table to wait for our three friends. It took us several minutes to get a waiter's attention so we could order drinks while we waited. Later, when we were all seated, the service was inattentive. When the meals arrived, I discovered I had no fork. Alas, getting a waiter's attention to remedy this was a challenge. \n\nI ordered a simple salad and a white cheese pizza. The salad was good, but the pizza? At this point, I've had a lot of SF pizza, and this one was mediocre at best. My friend's chicken was so undercooked she spurned it. Another friend, trying to order a steak, asked for mustard on the side. The waiter said, \"We don't have any mustard.\" Why? Because the restaurant is Italian. Please! My caramel salted ice cream was so bland it was like iced milk--not nearly as good as what you can get at a supermarket. My friend said his ice cream had a coat of ice on it, indicating it had been scooped earlier and then placed in the refrigerator. Not a good move.\n\nThis is an unpleasant restaurant experience. The staff is nice enough, but everyone is so harried they can't help but offer terrible service. \n\nWe all agreed that we would never go back.", "author": "Laurie F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-01-01", "description": "This review was written after dining at A16 Rockridge; not SF.  But I'd avoid 'Special' dinners here, too!\n\nCAVEAT:  We've had very good meals at A16 with their regular pizzas and pastas; but, when they do a 'special' menu -- as they did for New Years Eve -- run for the hills, because the meal will be on the dark side of execrable.  We learned too late; there's still time for you! \n\nTo wit:\n\nThe first -- and, at least for one dish, the best -- course, ANTIPASTI, was either an albacore crudo (good, if hardly exceptional) or water buffalo veal polpettini (virtually inedible, but for the saving grace of some nicely-brothed, baby lentils underneath).  The polpettini were dry, overcooked, unspiced, and almost entirely lacking in flavor; I don't think we've ever had any 'Italian' dish taste so bland.\n\n So, we were off to an iffy start, but still undaunted.\n\nUnfortunately, the second course, PASTA, was the beginning of the deluge of poorly conceived, prepared, and presented dishes.  The first, a crab crespelle -- not a pasta; think crunchy, tiny, crab flautas on a bed of oil-infused mashed potatoes -- sounded great and, indeed, the little flautas were fine.  But they sat on an oil-permeated, almost tasteless bed of mashed potatoes -- that, for some reason, were not just tepid, but soupy and cold.  A disastrous combo -- but if you ate the flautas quickly, the cold, oily potatoes could do only minimal damage to them.\n\nThe second pasta was a pasta: a single, large raviolo served with an egg inside.  We've had the Michael Chiarello version at Bodega, and it's absolutely superb: it comprises a very large raviolo, served piping hot, and when punctured by a fork, exudes a beautiful stream of bright, yellow egg yolk.  Here, tho, A16 over-cooked the raviolo -- such that the egg yolk had largely congealed.  And to add insult to their own injury, they then served the dish only luke warm.\n\nThe third course, the ENTREE, was a black cod or beef tenderloin choice.  The cod was OK, on a basic level but, strangely, lacked any seasoning, even tho it was touted as having a savory seafood brodo.  (Brodo? About the same as broth bought off the shelf at Trader Joes; tho somewhat less flavorful.)  It was served warm, the plate was cold.  Huh?\n\nBut, while the cod was at least edible, the beef tenderloin was horrible -- twice!  The first time, the plate was cold, and the beef, itself, was no warmer than room temperature.  I asked them to heat it and -- 10 minutes later -- was presented with what looked to be a different plate, with different cuts.  But, this time, the meat was gray, overcooked, dry, and -- essentially -- all from an end piece.  It looked thoroughly unappetizing -- but proved worse.\n\nResting on a bed of winter root vegetables, the beef proved inedible: about the worst I've tasted in my life.  Really.  The consistency was almost mealy.  And the bone marrow bread crumb garni only made a terrible dish worse -- since it tasted like small, sand granules.  (Cf.  Lark Creek's hot, savory, juicy Pot Roast with winter vegetables.)\n\nThe root vegetables were somewhat better -- but only because they had no flavor whatsoever.  And, to top it off, this version, tho slightly warmer than the first, was still served not much above room temperature. \n\n After two bites, I conceded defeat, and pushed the plate far away.\n\nStrangely -- or perhaps not -- our server never asked how that -- or any other -- dish tasted.  That, I found peculiar -- it was as if she knew just how bad the food she was serving had to be.  \n\nWe almost passed on dessert, figuring we could still get out alive, but -- hungry for something worthwhile -- were tempted by the rosemary + chocolate panna cotta.  Seemed like a fun concept of mixed flavors, but A16 took it precisely in the wrong direction: instead of lightly spicing the chocolate with rosemary, they basically served a rosemary panna cotta with chocolate flavoring.  The rosemary overpowered the palate -- and the many rosemary needles inevitably got stuck in one's teeth.  The cookies aside were stale -- as if purchased from a day-old bakery.\n\nOur server was friendly, but the service overall was scattered and inattentive -- as the cold dishes (and lack of interest in how we 'liked' our meals) reflected.  Perhaps she had too many tables.\n\nSo, with relatively empty -- and thoroughly unsatisfied -- stomachs, and nearly $300 lighter in our pockets, we fled A16 for the safety of home, and some edible New Years Eve snacking.  \n\nEnjoy the regular menu at A16 -- but by all means AVOID ALL 'SPECIAL' MENUS AT A16.  Even were if free, this would have been a terrible experience.\n\nSilver lining?  The dinner was so abominable, we laughed [at] ourselves all the way home; we had to squeeze some lemonade out of the A16 lemon!  \n\n(Two stars, because the regular menu is -- has to be -- much better; but no stars for last night.  Inexcusably atrocious!  And they probably have no clue how bad they were -- last night, at least", "author": "Susanne F."}

They say at the end of a year \"out with the old and in with the new.\" Well, that is what could be said about the food as well. They need to throw out all of the food from New Years Eve, as it tasted worse than old leftovers from thanksgiving; actually that is what they may have served. The food was truly disgusting. The soup to start was so small i had really focus to find it in front of me. Once i found it i then discovered it had no taste. I might as well have eaten the table cloth. For the second course I had the lobster pasta and what a workout that was trying to chew the lobster! It was clearly not fresh and was over cooked. Upon trying the beef for my third dish,  I discovered why they did not have salt on the table--they had used the restaurant's entire supply to season the beef. This leads me to dessert. I have a very sweet tooth and was excited to have a dish I would enjoy. But no, it was bland and tasteless. I also have to mention one of my friends had the lamb dish and it was actually inedible. We all tried it and it was actually sickening.  For a restaurant i absolutely love and the amazing food they normally provide, last night was a huge let down and is the reason I will never eat there again. The food was probably worth about 25% of what we actually paid. The atmosphere and service were much below the normal high standards as well.

Neither came until we flagged down another waiter that was passing through.\n\nWhen the food was delivered and he asked us how it was before we had even taken a bite, we didn't see him again until we flagged him down for a to-go box.\n\nFood: \nWe ate almost 2 baskets of bread before the food came out, and had to stop ourselves from finishing the basket even though we noted that the bread olive oil combination was lack luster.\n\nPumpkin Gnocchi: typically a big gnocchi and pumpkin fans, we debated getting this as a full meal or as an appetizer. We ultimately decided to get it as an appetizer and actually said \"wow I'm glad I didn't get this as my dish, it is not what i was expecting.\" \n\n ******We were I ordered the steak medium rare and it was juicy and wonderful. \nThe squash side dish reminded me the taste of a swimming pool. Weird I know, but basically it was not appetizing at all.\n\nMy friend ordered the pork with polenta on the side. \n*****We decided the polenta was good, but the pork was too dry. He admits that maybe he didn't know what to expect from the pork, so maybe it was a bad choice- although recommended by our absent waiter. \n\nWe stopped eating and decided to finish the bread rather than the pork and squash dishes. We had to flag down the waiter for a to-go box since our dishes were still full of food, if he HAD been around to check up on us, he wouldn't have guessed that we were finished with the meal. As we walked home we wondered why we even had the to-go box since the food was not something we looked forward to trying again.\n\nI can't remember the last time I ate somewhere where the food was so meh, that I verbally noted it was disappointing for several dishes in one meal. On top of it the service was sub-par. There were way too many tables in that space and the staff seemed to be overworked. I noticed that there were a lot of people on their cell phones at the end of the night. I assumed they were as bored as us waiting for their food, bills or credit cards to be returned. \n\nI wont return unless I find a guaranteed combination of items that I will actually enjoy.", "author": "Jessica H."}

But because it came so highly recommended I thought perhaps it was my fault.  I did something wrong.  Like maybe my expectations were just too high.  \n\nFrom the outside it looks like a place I'd love.  Small, simplistic, dark...We started with a cocktail each.  There are only three to choose from-so thats 66% of the cocktail list tried by yours truely.  We sent one back, it was disgusting and tasted like watered down coke.  You know me, to send back something with alcohol served to me in a pretty glass...its got to be bad! The waiter just casually took it from my hand, and placed it on the tray of another waiter headiing back to the kitchen and asked us for our dinner orders.  He was apparently not too broken up over our disappointment. \n\nThe wine list is spectacular if you really know Italian wines.  Im guessing.  I don't so I could be wrong.  But this menu was long, with a lot of Italian region headings of all places i'd like to visit or at least be able to pronounce.  I said, \"I like brunellos, in fact give me a big Italian red\"  He said I'll pick something for you and he was spot on! \n\nThe buratta cheese was gooey and delivered.  The marinated olives good but kind of mushy.  And the ragu entree was delish.  I mean its ragu....\n\nSo all in all a good night, good company...and good food.

It is dependable, a good first date spot with a variety of prices on both wine and menu items. However, the motivation to write a five star review is because things weren't perfect, but the way things were handled made my evening exceptional. \n\n1. On Sosh, we had read that there was a beer tasting menu- prix fixed inclusive beer pairings with food. When we got there, we found out that this was a misprint and they hadn't actually approved the messaging. But the concern our server had was so genuine. She went to a manager to check in it, she was apologetic and just so nice about it. She even brought us a complimentary beer taste. Very classy. It took the disappointment out of having to refocus on a new experience. \n\n2. At the end of my meal, for whatever reason, I got sick. I really rarely get sick. Our server (will add her lovely name later!) was so sweet, she brought me ginger ale and the manager came over to chat with me. She discussed that food poisoning usually takes some time. What she said made sense and I was happy to pay our bill, just had wanted to let someone know. (Was it the chili oil? Was it...) Ultimately, I just think my body didn't agree with something, or some combination.  On the way out, she handed me a gift certificate. She didn't have to, but again, it was very classy and left me feeling really great about the whole night. And a gift certificate was much better than taking something off our check. \n\nThanks A-16 for a great night. I will be back soon. I love you guys!", "author": "Danielle V."}

The food was kind of a mixed bag.\n\nWe enjoyed the squid starter, which was stuffed with rice/risotto and raisins (they may have been cranberries or currants...I can't quite remember).  I didn't think the seafood and dried fruit would pair well, but was happy to be proven wrong.  We also shared a tomato and ricotta appetizer, which was simple, but very good.  (At least, I'm pretty sure the cheese was ricotta.  I could have sworn the menu had said the cheese was supposed to be burrata, but it definitely was not burrata.)\n\nThe pizza (margherita) and pasta (maccaronara) were disappointing.  The pizza was a bit bland, and the crust was soggy.  It was drizzled with a LOT of olive oil.  So much, that \"drizzled\" kind of seems like too light of a word.  The pasta was doughy.  We also ordered the sweet corn, which was served on the cob.  (The menu did not indicate this.)  It was delicious, rubbed with black pepper and olive oil, but not really worth the $8.  (We received three small cobettes, which equaled about one full ear.)\n\nI also thought it was weird that they don't let you taste any of the wines.  I really don't want to pay $15+ for a glass of wine I might not like.  They do, however, offer half-glasses, for approximately half the price of a full glass.

It was SO GOOD and I really want to try and replicate it at home.\n\nFor my entree I really wanted to try a unique pasta dish. There were about 5 pasta choices and I debated between the gnocchi and the fish roe pasta. I asked the waiter what he recommended and he said that he didn't really like the fish roe pasta and instead suggested either the Maccaronara (a classic) or the new Nettle Gnocchi with Butternut Squash. I went with the entree size gnocchi and I was surprised at the small portion. The taste was good but the gnocchi with the nettle scent and flavor got a little boring and nauseating after a while. I still finished the whole dish but I won't get that dish again. Still, I appreciated the quality of the food and really noticed the tenderness of the gnocchi.\n\nFor dessert I had a scoop of the the Fig Marsala gelato per the server's recommendation.

It went well with the whole meal. I guess considering how much restaurants mark up wine it was not a bad deal at $75, but it struck me as a little overpriced for this wine. And yet, as far as I could tell, it was one of the less expensive bottles on the menu. It would be tempting to come again prepared to shell out more money on something more unusual since they have quite an interesting wine list focused on Southern Italian wines. \n\nIn fact, next time it's arugula salad, pizza, and the big bucks toward the wine.", "author": "Mister K."}

The place had a nice atmosphere. Good decor and lighting, a bit crowded and noisy but nothing unexpected for getting a good meal on a Friday night.\n\nEverything we ordered I loved. For starters: the burrata (an Italian cheese) with olive oil, sea salt and crostini along with the Prosciutto tasting. This was a great pairing. The creamy richness of the cheese played amazingly well with the saltiness of the prosciutto.\n\nFor entrees I was going to go strictly pizza because I saw a few being eaten around me and they looked incredible, but before arriving I read about one of their signature pasta dishes that was supposedly a must-eat in San Fran; the Maccaronara with ragu napoletano and house-made ricotta salata.\n\nSo as a compromise we ordered the pasta along with two pizzas and just ate everything family style. What amazing flavors! The pasta was definitely a good choice, out-of-this-world good. Both pizzas were cooked perfectly, melted cheese, simple/clean ingredients, great sauce with a thin, crunchy crust.\n\nThey also had a spicy, house-made crushed red pepper sauce that I applied liberally to my pizza. It was super hot, but I'm a fan of heat with my pie so I dug it.\n\nOverall, A 16 was an awesome dining experience, living up to my expectations of a fine San Francisco eatery.", "author": "Jacob C."}

I tried some of my husband's margherita pizza and it was good.  The crust was one of the better ones I've had lately - thin and crispy- and the flavor of the tomato sauce was a little sweet.

But...when we drop as much money as we did last night for the meal and experience we had, I earnestly feel something should be said.  So...here goes.\n\nTo the guy that answered the phone when I called to make a reservation.  You were awesome.  friendly, inviting, told us no worries that we'd been out cycling all day and that attire was not an issue.  You were coolsville.\n\nTo the bartender.  Here's the deal.  I'm sorry you're hectic.  I'm sorry you have a lot of people that want your attention.  But in all honestly, I don't give a shit.  When I walk up to the bar, your job is to be accommodating and straightforward. If we're about to drop close to $40 on a carafe of wine...guess what...I'm going to ask for a splash of potential selections so I know if we like it.  If you have a policy of not doing that, then just say so...I may not be thrilled by that policy but I'm a big boy in big boy pants and I'll live.  IF however, you agree to do this and you don't have a policy against it, then you better fucking do it with a smile on your face and goodness in your heart, not the \"oh my God...I can't believe you're inconveniencing me in this way\" attitude you oozed on my wife and I after I had the audacity to ask you to taste 2 different wines.  Don't like your job?  I'm sorry but its not my problem.  Don't like being in a service industry, I don't blame you...I wouldn't want to either but guess what? I'm not holding a gun to your head you snide hipster asshat.  The three things that kept me from launching over the bar and punching you in the head after you slammed close the wine list, slammed shut the wine cooler, rolled your eyes at my wife, and slapped the wine glass on the bar like you'd just done me a life long favor were: a) I was with my wife, b) we were with our kids, and c) I'd be arrested.  So...get over your self because someday, someone will come in and ask for the same basic help without kids, or a wife/husband, or a care about an arrest record and will punch your smarmy face into next week.\n\nTo the chef.  Yeah...I know its easy to get deceived about Italian food.  Is it good...is it just pasta...etc.  But I lived in Italy for over a year and feel pretty qualified to say the following.  If you're gonna serve a $21 bowl of pasta (maccaronara ragu napoletana), make it taste like something more authentic than Chef Boyardee Beefaroni.  Seriously.  \n\nSo there it is.  I know I sound like the turd in the A16 punch bowl.

The restaurant is a long narrow building that was moving and shaking at 7:30 on a Thursday night. I liked the energy of the restaurant at least until a group of 6 of the most stereotypical Marina girls I have ever seen in my life sat at the table next to mine at the end of the meal. A gentle reminder of where I was. Nevertheless, the dinner at A 16 was great. For two people, we split an appetizer (braised artichoke), a pizza (gotta go classic, gotta go margherita), a half pasta (paccheri), and a side (chard). Their treatment of the veggies were amazing. The braised artichoke was a great texture and a perfect savory dish. As the chard hit the table I noticed an absolutely amazing smell and the dish tasted to match. The pasta was the least exciting dish of the night, on the hard side of al dente, to the point that my dining companion found it a little too tough, I just thought that the gentle lemon and asparagus flavor paired in comparison to what else they were accomplishing at this place. \n\nBut I came for the pizza. I've tried many of the \"best\" pizza places in the city and find that A 16 beats out or holds up to any one I've been to. The crust is very thin, which tends to make the toppings a little harder to stay on, don't go crazy with overloading your pizza with the extra toppings, the menu is created with purpose and focus. The margherita pizza was lightly adorned with mozzarella, grana padano, olive oil, basil, and tomato sauce. And that sauce, the tomato sauce was absolutely fantastic at a just sweet enough spot that marks truly exceptional pizza. In my opinion, great sauce makes a pizza, an they definitely have a great tomato sauce here. The chili oil that accompanied the pizza was a nice touch as well, it brought heat (a lot of it if you wanted) in a more smooth way that topping it with chili flakes. \n\nA place worth checking out.

Both were delicious. \nSecond, Sunchoke and Escarole Salad and La Quercia tasting (Americano, Berkshire and Speck Prosciutto). Sunchoke salad was an unexpected great dish (prob my favorite of the night). Prosciuttos were really good. The Speck stood out to me the most. \nThird, we went for the one special of the evening which was a Pizza (ricotta cheese, ancho crusted crispy greens). This was my least favorite of the night. Not bc the pizza was bad (crust is delicious) the toppings (crispy greens) are not really my thing. I did enjoy the chile oil they served on the side for the pizza. I'm totally bummed though bc I was really excited for their pizza. Should have went with the Margarita. Next time. \nFourth course, Pumpkin Ricotta Gnocchi and Roasted Chanterreles. Both good. Only criticism is that I didn't taste any pumpkin in the gnocchi. RL said he tasted it barley. A little more would have been nice. \nDessert, their signature Chocolate Budino Tart with Sea Salt and Olive Oil and the stand out dish of the night Farro Custard with Bitter Chocolate and Orange Yogurt Sorbet. This Farro Custard was such an odd idea so I just had to try it. I love farro and this custard was amazing. The crispy bruleed top and the chunks of whole farro was just a great combination and a great end to the meal. \n\nRestaurant was packed (8pm on Saturday) but thanks to our OT resie we walked right it. We sat in the waaaaayyy back of the restaurant. Doesn't look like it but this place is quite big. Table was kind of tight but we made it work. Again, Service was great.

Hate to admit it: damn, it was good. \n\nWe'll start with the appetizers. I had the burratta ($11) and crostini which was fantastic. I had never tried burratta.  Burrata is a fresh Italian cheese, made from mozzarella and cream. The outer shell is solid mozzarella while the inside contains both mozzarella and cream, which is all short for a damn good appetizer. \n\nOur 2nd appetizer was the 14 month aged San Daniele prosciutto ($14). Again, very good. Though to be honest - the La Quercia tasting: Americano, Berkshire and speck prosciutto * looked * phenomenal.\n\nFor an appetizer I had the Margherita pizza (tomato, mozzarella, grana padano, basil, olive oil). At $14 it was large enough for two people to share.\n\nWhat surprised me most about A16 was that sweet spot between quality food and value. For what I consider a medium-priced restaurant the quality of the food was high for what is a welcoming and not overly complicated menu. \n\nThe service was fantastic. The servers were very knowledgeable and friendly. \n\nAs far as the ambiance, A16 is definitely busy but I would say it's a good place for a date if you like a bustling restaurant that is sleek and modern.

Since it's difficult to get out of the house now, I wanted this dinner to be special more so than ever!  Since we live in the south bay, eating in the city was a treat.\n\nWe walked around the Marina district and found this place by accident.  I noticed that there was a crowd waiting outside, which indicated that this restaurant must be at least somewhat good.  The posted menu was impressive.  Italian food hasn't impressed me much, because I have found it easier than other European cuisine to be cooked at home.  A16 served southern Italian cuisine but was unique and fresh.\n\nThe one horrible thing was the wait in the beginning.  We were told that the wait was an hour.  This was at around 6 PM.  We walked around and returned and had to wait another 20 mins or so.  The restaurant was busy and bubbled with younger crowd.  It reminded us of a restaurant in NY late at night.  \n\nThe restaurant was worth the wait.  We ordered immediately since we've been staring at the menu for awhile.  Service was great!  Our waitress recommended an Italian white, which I wanted and went along great with my meal. The wine was crisp, floral, and light in alcohol (my request).  \n\nThe appetizers were served fast, which was great since we were starving. They beat the bread basket, which I couldn' believe!  I started off with the escarole salad with watermelon radishes, egg, anchovies, breadcrumbs and black pepper.  I'm not sure if the watermelon radishes were type of radish, but they were pickled perfectly.  I loved the anchovie dressing with the breadcrumbs (gave the dish crunch).  It gave the dish a Caesar salad feel without being the mundane Caesar salad.\n\nMy main entree was the squid ink cavatelli with house-made baccala, cherry tomatoes, green olives and chiles.  The pasta was chewy.  The baccala (salted cod) was delicious!  It was firm and flavorful... reminded me of crab meat.  \n\nWe shared a pumpkin panna cotta with hazelnut cake.  It was light and not horribly sweet.  The richness of the french-pressed decaf coffee balanced out the sweetness well.\n\nI wanted to stay and enjoy the night longer even though it was crowded.

I was also told that there would be no better gnocchi than what I would be served at A 16. \n\nSo I arrived in my little black dress and shiny dangly earrings... a very sophisticated diner who was going to run to her death in the morning. We started with some mozzarella burrata topped with olive oil, served with crostini bread. Such a simple dish yet, utterly brilliant in flavor and texture. \n\nI wasn't sure what to drink so I took the server's suggestion....she recommended the perfect wine based on my tastes. \n\nThen, the gnocchi arrived. \n\nAs a seasoned yelper I don't even know where to begin to describe this dish.

It was delicious - a 1000x better than the marconara. That said, I think in the future we'll probably order two pizzas and skip the pasta dish altogether. Comparatively, the pasta is simply not as exciting or delicious -- if I were rating A16 and had only tried the pasta then they'd probably get 3 instead of 4 stars.

I think I read a review that said they stop the process before it becomes full mozzarella so it's a bit softer and tastes amazing with the olive oil and the crostinis. Every table around ours had this and after reading reviews I went especially to Walgreens to get some lactaid in preparation (is that gross to share? I'm Asian what can I say??). Definitely worth a try or two!\n\nPizza:\n-Funghi - roasted mushrooms, smoked mozzarella, grana padano, garlic, oregano, wild arugula: Delicious!! I saw a few reviews that said the mushrooms weren't good but I found them perfectly cooked, not mushy with perfect texture and the chile oil on the table added just a bit of heat. The other pizzas on the menu seemed good as well - some with just tomato sauce, some with just cheese and one with both. Although the roomie said it was a bit dry I was completely happy just gobbling up the mushroomy goodness!\n\nPasta (ordered half orders to share since everything just looked too damn good!):\n-Maccaronara with tomato ragu and house-made ricotta salata: on the 7x7 list. Now usually I appreciate a bit of meat or at least seafood in my pastas but in this case, it would only ruin the appreciation for a great sauce and amazing pasta. The pasta tasted like it was just made (who knows?) and had a perfect al dente texture that really carried the flavor of the ragu. Loved it loved it, very subtly delicious!\n\n-Squid ink tonnarelli with octopus, Manila clams, black olives, chiles and garlic: I am a sucker for squid ink pasta ever since I tried it in Boston and this one by A16 definitely did not disappoint. Again, great texture in the pasta, amazing flavor and a generous helping of octopus and clams as well. Winner dish for sure!\n\nWe decided to skip out on the entrees considering the reviews for them were mediocre at best and focused mainly on the pasta, pizza and wine that A16 is known for. The bulk of the bill was the carafe of Cab that we ordered which was AMAZING in flavor and complemented our mushroom pizza very well.\n\nAll in all a raving good meal and it helped that everyone around us was raving over their food as well. The minus star happened at the end when we had one pizza slice left (a lot considering it's 1/4 the pizza!!) which was taken away to be boxed to-go yet we did not get back at the end of the meal. =( I'm extremely sad just thinking about how I could be eating for lunch today to re-live yesterday's delicious dinner. \n\nI know I know, longass review but all these dishes were perfect and if you follow this advice (reaffirmed by Yelpers!)

With a good wood oven (and the hype), I expect that texture contrast of crust to cheese to ingredients.

From sparkling to lighter whites to light to medium bodies reds, there's something outstanding for everyone. Takes some to wow me and I was thrilled with all that was poured. \n- Margarita pizza: the best I've had. Delicate, fresh, crushed tomato sauce, mozzarella, and a few leaves of basil. Charred chewy crust to round it all off makes it my favorite. \n- Corn: mini slices of corn on the cob expertly seasoned with cracked black pepper and sea salt. Sweetness, pepperiness, and saltiness comprise a stellar trio. \n- Pasta: fresh al dente with ripe tomatoes being the center of the dish making up the sauce. Ricotta bits mixed in vary the texture and flavor a bit, \n- Prosciutto tasting: 3 different kinds served in piles on a wooden paddle. Americano was standard, Berkshire was more substantial and salty, and speck was smokey. \n- Layout: longer than I expected--like a supermodel's legs. From the front it looks like it'd fit only a few tables, but it tricks you when you get inside the door being roomier than expected. \n- Service: our waitress Amanda was the best. Warm personality with fantastic wine suggestions based on our individual tastes. \n- Almond cake: cross between angel and pound with a noticeable almond flavor. \n- Chocolate tart: hard crunchy almost cookie crust like base topped with a clump of chocolate mousse laced with olive oil and sea salt.

My mom makes them better.\nThe topping to crust ratio was super off on the pizzas, and the funghi pizza (the waiter's recommendation when we told him this was our first time at the restaurant) would really only be good if you were obsessed with mushrooms. A standard run-of-the-mill mushroom eater like myself will feel OD'd on mushrooms after one or two bites.\nIt was also petty of them to charge us $1 for the side of tomato sauce we asked for to help give the pizza a little more flavor.\n\nOverall, I really don't get the hype. Seems like the kind of place that was interesting when it first opened but didn't keep up with the SF level of innovation we've all grown accustomed to.", "author": "Joanne S."}

Now I finally have and I can't stop raving. It's become one of my favorite San Francisco restaurants and that only happens less then once a year. \n\nI love recommending A16 for first dates, old dates, family visiting and a standard regular spot with girl/boy friends. The ambiance is inviting and fresh. My favorite spot to sit is at the end of the food bar watching the small plates Cook. It is an art and a talent to be able to pull off what they do in the kitchen. I am also, now inspired to have a wood burning stove built into my kitchen (a massive one). That will happen when I actually own a home instead of paying a mortgage on my rent in SF. That's besides the point... All you need to know is watching the cooks while waiting and eating your meal is inspiring! Better then staying home watching Top Chief.\n\nMost areas in the dinning look romantic. The front is bar seating and seems a bit crowded for the space. But for a wonderful meal and comfortable seating, sit in the dinning area inside or out. :)\n\nCheers!", "author": "Dee C."}

The meal went downhill after being served a beet salad that was so heavily salted it was inedible. We did not ask to have it replaced but just commented on it. This lead to the manager getting involved who quickly asked us to leave. She claimed we had created problems when we came in when all we had done was make the mistake of walking in and asking whether they could seat us. We were told yes and were promptly seated. Simple and fast. The person who seated us was not the manager and did not support the managers claims but she was unwilling to even discuss it.

Be sure to make reservations on Open Table, bc it only seats 75-ish ppl.  The restaurant brought us complimentary sparkling wine for our occasion, which was so yummy.  We started with the burrata for an appetizer (per Yelp reviews), and it was SO yummy.  Order it, no questions!  For drinks, I had the lager beer, and my husband had two other beers,, Calicraft and The Brewery, I think.  The second one mentioned was awesome!  It was a tangy, citrus-like brew.  Loved!  I didn't drink the other one, and I think I may have the names wrong anyway.  For dinner, I decided to do two appetizer servings of pasta, which was awesome if you like to try new things.  I got the maccaronara and the...one that is listed directly underneath if on the menu!  I think ricci, or something... but it has lemon, asparagus, and some other things.  They were both good, but I think I was expecting more.  Of the two, the maccaronara was better, more traditional if you're not adventurous.  My husband's dish though was insane.  He got the funghi pizza with prosciutto added on top of it.  It was sinful.  So yummy.  Mushroom lovers --- get it.  I think if I could order all over again, I would have got the Panna pizza.  I think pizza is going to be the best on the menu.  We had the popular chocolate dessert for our final order.  It was great, bc even though it was chocolate overkill --- they have huge pieces of sea salt on the plate to give you extra oomph.  It is worth trying if you're wanting the experience.  Service was awesome.  Our waitress Hardwick was fantastic, and she totally went out of her way the entire night.  The restaurant has a cool vibe too.

When the food did arrive (it took a while ) the toast that comes with the mussels was placed on the table so badly burned it was black. We asked for a replacement which we received but no removal of the burnt toast and no apology. One if the pizzas had ingredients in it that we're not listed on the menu. Two of the pizzas has sauce added to them one of which was sloppily poured on top after the pizza was baked. Clearly an afterthought. Al of the pizza toppings were very unevenly distributed on the pies too. The salad never came but was on the bill. The server removed the charge with a half-hearted apology. \nThe pizzas were tasty but not worth the price or aggravation.

A list that consists of restaurants all located in SF. For an East Bay guy this is not going to be easy since I mostly eat in the East Bay, but to quote JFK we do it \"not because they are easy, but because they are hard.\" \n\nAfter taking our kids to Bay Area Discovery Museum in Sausalito we decided to cross the bridge and headed out to the Marina in SF for dinner. My wife thought it was cool, but I was excited because this was a perfect opportunity to try out a restaurant from the 7x7 list. First stop A16 and their Maccaronara with ricotta salata. (Technically I already tried the Pulled-pork sandwich at Roadside BBQ located in San Rafael, not SF but the same restaurant so that's checked off as well.) \n\nSo on to the review. \n\nImmediately after we were seated we order the Maccaronara with ragu napoletana and house-made ricotta salata (7x7 recommendation) and the Margherita pizza for the kids. The Maccaronara was definitely delicious and I absolutely recommend it if you are planning to eat here at A16. But personally this wouldn't be on my list if I was making my own 100 Things to Try Before You Die list. It's just not something I would crave for or go out of my way to have. \n\nWhat I am a bigger fan of is the restaurant itself. A16 was very nice, cozy and elegant. The people were very nice and their staff was very attentive. Only negative for me is that this place is not kid friendly. I certainly would love to come back and dine here again, maybe when the kids are older. \n\nOverall outcome 3 1/2 stars, but I'm willing to nudge it up to 4 stars for the nice staff and great setting.", "author": "Mel B."}

Tuna and fava was good if oily, bread was great alone as well as topped with the above.\n\n- Marinara pizza. Great sauce and loved the thin crust. No need to mess around with cheese or a bunch of distracting toppings.\n\n- Squid ink pasta. Excellent, intense, confident flavor. Small is plenty for two. \n\n- Halibut with sunchokes on the side. Halibut was very good, sunchokes blew my mind A & B style. Taste and look like a potato, but actually a root vegetable. Never mind all that, just make sure you get some.\n\n- Strawberry sorbet. One of the best I've ever had.\n\nOverall a strong four. Most of the food was excellent and priced about right. Service was friendly and knowledgeable. Space is warmly designed, love the pizza oven. Atmosphere is alive and buzzing, little too big and noisy for intimate conversation. I can't imagine this place not being full.

The pizza was fantastic, with an amazing array of flavors -- the only thing that kept my review from 5 stars was that the pizza might have been slightly underdone in the center -- a little soggy in the middle.  (That might keep the pizza from being as good as, say, Pizzeria Mozza in LA.)\n\nThen, of course, the wine -- had a glass of a crisp Falanghina to start, and then shared an outstanding bottle of Aglianico with the pizza.  Intense wine that Aglianico -- so acidic when it was opened I felt like my teeth were going to melt.  But the sommelier decanted it, and after a bit of time, it softened into a perfect wine with the salsiccia.  Still a wine with muchos huevos grandes, but still somehow in balance.

Go to A16 and order the Burrata Appetizer, mushroom pizza and quit being a wimpy, seafood-fearing-pants on fire and get the squid-ink calamari pasta).\n\n\nI've held a 3 year grudge against A 16, and I'm so glad I gave it another chance.  My first trip I split the Marghertia pizza with a friend.  Not memorable and certainly not adventurous.  I thought the restaurant was loud, overhyped and sceney (all three descriptors do not go hand-in-hand with Italian food).  I thought Michael Bauer needed to boot this place off his Top 100.  I also tend to exaggerate and speak in extremes.  \n\nWhen making a reservation here (recommended) I would suggest requesting the back dining room.  The waiting area kind of spills into the front tables and I noticed those patrons had people hovering over them, staring at their food while waiting for a table.  \n\nThe wine list is diverse and expansive.  Our server was helpful in selecting a medium-bodied red and deciphering the pastas (it's one of the few menus where every single pasta had to be explained to me; I didn't recognize any of the names).  We decided to split a pizza and a pasta, since that's what A 16 is known for and seemed like a safe bet.  \n\nWe started with the Burrata, which is a must-have.  I hear that the burrata disappears from the menu from time to time, but may be available upon request.  The Italian cheese is drizzled with olive oil and served with crostini.  I could eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Request more crostini when the 4 they give you are gone!\n\nNow on to the main course.  We decided to go with the famed Funghi Pizza and the Tonnarelli with calamari.  Let me tell you, I'm so glad I had an adventurous dining companion.  The Tonnarelli with calamari may be intimidating to some, as it's a squid-ink pasta which is dark and murky (between that and the red wine, we were convinced we'd leave A 16 with black teeth).  Seriously though....order it.  It's garlicy and basily.  And seafoody, but not too intense.  The tonnarelli is homemade at the restaurant the al dente texture is amazing.  PLUS, they add some aged tomatoes into the dish which give it an incredible pop of flavor.  If you don't fear seafood, you need to get this dish.  Just do it.  \n\nI know mushroom pizza might not sound exciting, but this was totally unique.  The mushrooms are all different sizes and nothing like you see on that Mr. Pizza Man pizza you order at 2 am when you're having a bad day and eating your feelings.  Flavors include oregano and garlic with smoked mozzarella.  No sauce.  Also, there's a little jar of spicy oil to dabble on the pizza.  DABBLE and dribble, do NOT dump this sauce on your food because mother of mercy, it is spicy.\n\nIf I hadn't just gifted the birthday boy a dozen red velvet cupcakes from Noe Valley Bakery, we probably would have ordered dessert!\n\nThis is a great place for a fancy date if you want to be out amongst the people.

Our server was friendly and quirky, but forgot one of our starters and lagged on the water refills.\n\nThe food was seriously mediocre. Our mussels starter was underwhelming. The cured pork and tomato broth overwhelmed the poor little shellfish, which were a bit gritty and not particularly fresh. No bread was offered with the mussels, and no decent spoon for scooping them out.\n\nThe pizzas are famous, but for barely any reason. The crust was baked off perfectly, but lacked any flavor. There was not enough gluten development and maybe even some non-yeast leavening, so the mouthfeel was more yielding than chewy. The crust's flavor was completely empty.\n\nThe funghi pizza had plenty of pricey mushrooms, and good texture, but it was a bit simple. A bit of a one-trick pony.\n\nI ordered the tasting pizza, the \"do whatever you want\" to me, the adventurous diner. Our reservations were early, before the place got really buzzing. So the kitchen had plenty of time to experiment and showoff their, say, cured meats or, say, seasonal veg. No, instead I got four cheeses and rocket. The tired, boring default pizza that is served in every London pizza chain. The cheeses lost each other, the pizza needed seasoning and much more rocket.\n\nAuthentic Italian pizza does not necessarily require a tomato sauce, but I do not care. Plenty about A16's pizza is completely inauthentic, so why stop at the tomatoes?  I ended up using the chili oil like a tomato sauce if I squinted my eyes.\n\nDessert was a fresh torte, a layered thing of booze soaked cake and chestnut custard. It was topped with an annoyingly sweet marshmallow layer, which was probably a nod to toasted brulee.\n\nThe sticky wine paired with the dessert was crisp and perfect, by far the best part of the meal. Our by -the- carafe cab was drinkable, but very simple for the price.\n\nA16 is really, really overrated. As other reviews mention, Delfina blows it out of the water.", "author": "Ben G."}

The wait was 1.5 hours, which may have been acceptable for a meal that brings tears to your eyes, but definitely not what we got. We ordered two pizzas and the ricotta gnocchi.

The burrata is always a must order and was typical creamy goodness. The salumi plate had some interesting options (hello beef tongue!) and went well with the cheese.  \n\nNext up - pasta. Ricotta gnocchi with braised Watson Farms lamb and Jimmy Nardello peppers was divine though the star of the evening was the Bucatini with Sicilian almond and dried san marzano pesto, mint and pecorino. The bucatini was a perfect al dente and while the was the first non-green pesto for me it definitely won't be the last.\n\nWe moved on to two pizzas and wanted to keep it simple - one Margherita and one Margherita with added arugula. The classic Margherita continues to be one of my favorite pizzas in SF though the Margherita with arugula suffered from too much arugula! We ended up picking off a good portion of it and it made the pizza more manageable. \n\nService was top notch - we were greeted with smiles by the hostesses (who sat us as soon as we walked in even though our party was incomplete) and treated great by the entire floor staff.

I enjoyed the food at A16 - a 3.5 star experience, but as Stephen G. mentions, it was the service that put it over the top for me.\n\nMy friend and I arrived at A16 45 minutes early for our 9 p.m. reservation -way, way early.  But we figured we might as well see if we could get in a bit early; she had a table up front near the bar area of the restaurant but we'd probably have to wait for our real reservation time for a table in the dining area.  We decided to wait for a real table in the back of the restaurant.  The hostess was incredibly nice and actually checked to see if there was availability (rather than just flippantly looking through her reservations for the evening).  The bar area was a bit crowded so we went around the corner for a glass of wine.\n\nWhen we returned a few minutes later for our 9 p.m. reservation, the place was still packed.  We were seated immediately and were promptly waited on by a server.  My friend and I don't particularly know Italian wines, so the server brought over the sommelier.  We gave the sommelier a price range and a desired flavor, and he found something perfect for us (without any sort of upsell).  \n\nWe ordered the pizza of the day (ricotta cheese and arugula) as an appetizer; I got the gnocchi with pancetta for an entree while my friend had the beef short ribs (with a side of butternut squash which was highly recommended by the server).  I really enjoyed the pizza - very tasty considering the simplicity of the ingredients.  I liked my gnocchi but it fell a bit flat for me; perhaps I was expecting the pancetta to give the gnocchi more of its flavor but it was a bit bland for my taste.  My friend really enjoyed the beef short ribs, so I think I may have to go with one of the meatier entrees the next time around.\n\nAnd, yes, there will definitely be a next time.", "author": "Wendy L."}

I still dry heave thinking about the pork chop that I had placed in front of me.  It had to have had at lease 3 inches of straight fat around it.   Once i was done sawing off the fat that took up 3/4 of my plate I took a bite and refused to eat any more of it.  It was just gross.  My sweet husband took my plate and traded me for his dish.  He's a meat and potatoes kind of guy and even he said the pork chop was gross.  I can't go back and I don't think I could ever order another pork chop at a restaurant because of this one.", "author": "Jennifer K."}

Since we brought our own wine, I can't elaborate on the wine selections, but I assume they're pretty stellar. \n\nWe'd heard about the Burrata from several friends and ordered that as our appetizer....AMAZING!! It literally melts in your mouth, so good. We also ordered the Funghi pizza, which was so flavorful & delicious...put a little of the hot sauce they provide on it to kick it up! The dough is really delicious....I'm sure any pizza would be great here. Next up, we had the Pumpkin Gnocchi which was so buttery and silky - only drawback is that I wish it had more pungent flavors. We also ordered the Squid Ink pasta with clams - I didn't love the texture and I'm not a huge fan of clams - I wouldn't order this one again.

He had eaten here once before and thought it was really good (hence the return visit).\n\nOther reviewers mention the tables being very close together.  Those along the wall opposite the open kitchen are.  This is a small restaurant, although I did see tables farther back that appeared to be stand-alone with more space.  We were seated at a table along the wall, which turned out to be fine despite being sandwiched between two tables of kids and their parents.  Fortunately everyone was well-behaved (I wish I could say as much for the kids where I live so kudos to SF parents - you must be doing something right!).\n\nThe restaurant info above lists A16 as 'full bar'.  Maybe that means something different in wine country, but to me that means they have liquor as well as wine and beer.  They don't.  I asked.  So if you like to peruse a menu with a nice martini in hand - forget it!  They do have a nice selection of wine, however.\n\nSo a bottle of wine and the burrata starter (with olive oil, sea salt and crostini) were ordered while we perused the rest of the menu.  Everything sounded good and I decided on the Escarole Salad (with nectarines, olives, walnuts and ricotta salata) and the Roasted Chicken Meatballs (with cherry tomato and fennel agrodolce).  Hubs ordered the Roasted Calamari Panzanella (with cherry tomatoes, Sicilian cucunci, fennel and herbs) and the Maccaronara (with ragu napoletana and house-made ricotta salata).\n\nThe burrata itself was quite good but I think it was a bit too liberally sprinkled with the salt.  That would have been OK if the crostini had been plain, but it was oiled, salted and way too hard.  Overall, it was just too salty for my taste when everything was eaten together, so I ate the cheese by itself (rather decadent, I thought).\n\nThen the salads came.  The Hubs' calamari salad looked good, but I didn't taste it so can't comment on that.  My escarole salad missed the mark somewhere.  It had great potential.  I think the nectarine and olive combo was brilliant, but either the greens weren't dried well and watered down the dressing or the dressing was just too bland to start with.  Somewhere along the way, the acid component was missed.  Too bad.  A little lemon juice or white wine vinegar would have taken this salad where it needed to be.  As it was, it was almost flavorless.\n\nThen we received the entrees.  The Hubs' pasta looked pretty good.  It must have been since he ate it all without offering me a bite.  The chicken meatballs I ordered were very flavorful but waaaay too salty.  The only thing that helped was the tomato/fennel agrodolce which countered the saltiness somewhat.  My dish also came with a choice of sides so I had the Roasted Carrots and Turnips (with leeks, mint, lemon and chiles).  Pretty much all I got was roasted carrots.  There was hardly any turnip and I couldn't even detect any of the other ingredients.  Now I like roasted carrots, but I could have had this at home (actually mine are better).\n\nOverall, I was pretty disappointed with the experience.  The food wasn't that great and the service was efficient, but not particularly friendly.  To be honest, I doubt I'd go there again.  There are too many really good places to eat in SF.", "author": "Diane T."}

Placed upon sea greens, the dish led us into the pizza wonderfully.\n\nThe sausage had a kick. Spicy and illuminating heat, it was a decadent bite when paired with the soft dough it lived on. The garlic, mozzarella and roasted spring onions atop the pizza  perfected the pie. Pizza was born to speak like this.\n\nThe squid ink tonnarelli was the true highlight of the evening. Coated in a white wine and garlic reduction, with sliced capers, the flavor profile was distinguished and sharp. A strong portion of manila clams played with the dish, and offered a visually stunning piece.\n\nThat was a food line up that could rival the best in SF.\n\n***\nFor dessert, house made gelato and the carrot cake with pinenut gelato and candied fennel adorned our table.\n\nThe cinnamon crunch gelato was superb. Sweet and intoxicating while the warm carrot cake brought back a highlight reel of being a kid again.

The starter of Burrata with olive oil, sea salt and crostini almost made me pass out it was so rich and scrumptious. I was surprised that I enjoyed the domestic Iowa Berkshire Prosciutto more than the di Parma.  Chestnut cavatelli with ragu bianco, chanterelles, dandelion greens and pecorino was an AMAZING winter pasta dish.

Panna cota with a jelly-like rosewater layer, roasted pistachios, and pomegranate!!!  Chocolate tart with bundino (saying its like a pudding doesn't do it justice) with the darkest, deepest flavor with sea salt.  It was an amazing experience.\n\nIt's a narrow, long restaurant.

It was lit up, in the holiday spirit, and looked like a tiny gem surrounded by bigger and bolder shops&eateries.  However, when we walked in, we discovered that A16 was much bigger than advertised.  In fact, it was the longest and narrowest restaurant we'd ever been in.  It just keeps going and going and going.  And it's got a magical draw to it.  The deeper you get inside, the more it grows on you.  Great ambience and energy.  It feels like the place to be, and for us, it really was.\n\nSara was our server, and she could not have been more professional, helpful and pleasant.  We asked about the starters, the pizzas, the pastas and the wines.  We told her we had to be out by 7:30 because we had tickets for the Smuin Ballet.  And she took care of everything from there.\n\nWe started with the burrata, that silky sweet cheese made from mozzarella and cream.  Could not have been more pleasing.  And then the crispy pork belly.  Also excellent.  We shared the Bianca pizza, with fennel sausage.  Fabulous thin crust, more mozzarella, along with padano--the semi-aged Italian hard cheese.\n\nI was only slightly disappointed with my entree, which was the maccaronara napoletana.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, al dente.  And the sauce was hearty and flavorful.  The only thing missing was meat.  Chunks of meat.  But whatever meat there was originally was fully absorbed into the sauce.  A very minor complaint.  \n\nI'd go back to A16 in a heartbeat.  In fact, I will.

I was so impressed by the crowd that my expectations were heightened. \n\nWe had:\n* CALAMARI - 4/5 - I thought that the way they prepared the calamari was interesting.. it wasn't breaded, and it tasted very fresh and had an interestingly delicious combination of spices/seasoning.\n* GNOCCHI - 2/5 - Slightly tough (even elastic) and salty. Much as I LOVE gnocchi, I just couldn't eat it.\n* LAMB RAVIOLI - 3.5/5 - This was what my friend ordered - a good dish that we ended up sharing because of my terrible gnocchi.\n* CHOCOLATE TART w/SEA SALT - 3.5/5 - Decent to good, but not memorable.\n\nWe also had a bottle of Pinot Grigio and, initially, a Lambrusco to drink with dessert at the end of the meal... I will add that the service was so great and our server was SO wonderful and attentive that when he saw our expressions, he replaced the Lambrusco with a bottle of Moscato d'Asti, my classic choice of dessert wine (grape juice, really).\n\nWith the Michelin Bib Gourmand status, I could've just gone at a bad time and ordered the wrong dishes - or maybe what granted them the status to begin with was Nate Appleman, who I just found out has moved to New York to open Pulino's. We may decide to go back to A16 and give it another shot after we've worked down the list of other Michelin starred and Bib Gourmand restaurants we've wanted to visit..................... but by then, without Nate Appleman, they probably would have altogether lost their MBG status.", "author": "Asha S."}

They gave us a great table meant to seat four, which was nicely tucked away out of the way of the busy hustle & bustle. It was a very busy night - the Saturday before Valentine's Day, though the hostess told us they're usually that busy every weekend. We didn't feel rushed or pressured to order at all, despite the large crowd. The atmosphere is great - it was a pretty cold night so I appreciate the warmth, both temperature wise and vibe wise inside of A16. \n\nThe food: We ordered the clams as an appetizer, which were in a really outstanding sauce and served with a large piece of toasted bread for dipping. We didn't realize when we ordered though that the type of clams were very small, so we ended up with this huge plate of tiny clams. They were good, but sort of an overwhelming portion size that took a lot of effort to eat. I would've preferred a smaller amount of larger clams, but that's our fault for not knowing what type of clams they were on the menu. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the gnocchi pasta dish and it was melt in your mouth good. I ordered the short rib with polenta on the side. The short rib itself was very tender, and the wine sauce was delicious. However the polenta that was served on the side was served way too hot and not that interesting. The biggest \"complaint\" I have about this place is that the meals are very one-dimensional. It seems like pizza is their specialty, being a northern Italian restaurant, so when I go back (because we will be back) I'll likely try a pizza. \n\nFinally, we were able to eat here for about $60 total, including an appetizer and two entrees. We had drinks elsewhere before, and needed to watch the time so we could catch the BART back to the East bay so skipped dessert and coffee, so that cut down on costs. We've both had some terrible meals for $60, so considering how great this place was I think that was a bargain. \n\nOverall we both had a wonderful experience - , this is a cute neighborhood to be in, decent amount night life and good restaurants and a young-ish (somewhat yuppie to older at times) crowd. The vibe at the restaurant seemed older at first when we were waiting for our table near the bar, but once we were seated in the back where the tables were the crowd was pretty mixed. \n\nDefinitely worth a try, great with a date, though there was a table of \"bros\" dining together so good for a group of guy/girl friends, too!", "author": "Jennifer M."}

All of my past experiences have been great, but this one topped them all. \n\nI was here with a party of four and everyone loved their food. The appetizers we ordered were the Burrata with olive oil, Trippa napoletana, and Grilled sardines. For the past 26 years I have hated sardines but because my mom tried the tripe for me, I tried out the sardines and they were amazing. They did not have that overly salty taste that sardines usually have and I could have eaten a whole plate of them. The 2 pasta dishes (one being the squid ink and sea urchin), the rabbit, and the sole were all prepared to perfection. \n\nWe had reservations at 5pm (when they open on Saturdays) since that was the only time available when I booked that week of and the restaurant was packed. The vibe is a lot of fun and the open kitchen adds to the experience since one can see the food being prepared and watch the hot plates walk by.

Well, proscuitto is, proscuitto. You can't really screw it up. It  tasted fresh, and it was on the drier side which I didn't mind at all. Didn't leave grease stains which is a plus! The burrata was pretty delectable, although I would like my cheeses to be a bit more saltier, but it was melt in your mouth goodness. \n\nEntree wise, the pizza was a little bit too soggy for my liking. I mean, when I picked it up, the thing fell apart. The dough was freshly made and it tasted better than the Pizza Hut, that's for sure! It was just a-ok. For the Maccaronara pasta, you could tell that it was handmade. It was perfectly cooked (al dente!) but for some reason (and my friend agreed with me on this) those noodles reminded me too much of udon noodles. I felt like I should be eating it with fishballs in a hot soup. So, yes, the pasta was well made, but it was in a basic red sauce which was too simple and plain for me to go \"wow! That was amazing!\"\n\nFor dessert, we all just had two scoops of gelato: pistachio and almond. Both were good and creamy, but of course, it's not the same as the gelato in Italy, but I won't knock it. It was delicious and i would eat the whole quart like the fatty that I am if presented with it.\n\nThe service was very slow and I hate having to wait for the bill to arrive when you're ready to bolt outta there.

The burrata was exquisite as was the prosciutto, the latter featuring a prosciutto di Parma and a US homegrown variety from Iowa. The Iowan took the blue ribbon, though both were excellent. \n\nWe split the macaronnara for the pre-main course and the house-made pasta was second to none to say the least. It was perfectly cooked and the sauce was magnificent in all aspects.\n\nEntrees included the gnocchi, the pork, and the rabbit they featured as a special. All three amply satisfied, though the gnocchi particularly stood out. Their consistency was that of soft little potato pillows, light and not overly-filling. \n\nFor dessert we had the lemon panna cota, the chocolate budino, and both flavors of gelato. Out of those three the gelatos stole the show. The featured flavors were burnt caramel and pistachio with the former being my favorite. My only complaint with regards to the food was that the budino was over-salted. Salt can do amazing things for a dessert, but you've definitely got to keep it in check. \n\nOur server (I wish I could remember her name to give her proper credit) was knowledgable, unobtrusive, and overall more than competent.

He was a pizzaiolo himself back in Naples and he told me that his favourite pizza in the city was A16's.  Doesn't it sound like a reliable advice? \n\nTonight, after the theatre, I have dragged two Italian friends to this restaurant and guess what? we all ordered pizza. Not only, in fact. I also shared an appetizer, namely grilled calamari with lemongrass and spicy peppers, that we all found divine!  But let's go back to the pizza... After my pizza margherita with Parma ham (exactly like in Delfina last week)  I'm sorry to say that ... I'm so confused! Starting from today, I officially cannot distinguish any longer which is my favourite margherita pizza in SF: Tony's, Delfina or A16? A16's and Delfina's are very very similar, but there is some grated parmigiano on A16's, a typical Napolitan final touch (not so commonly used elsewhere, even in Italy) which contributes to enrich the already excellent taste. Really hard to pick one anyway ... fortunately I don't have to :-)\n\nThe desserts are also seriously worth to be mentioned: my bunet pudding with cinnamon and cocoa, topped with freshly made whipped cream and accompanied by delicious liquor soaked cherries was a glorious way of ending the meal!  The best dessert I have got since my dinner at La Ciccia. The rhubarb cake with green almond ice-cream chosen by my fellow diners was also memorable.\n\nAdding a good refreshing Hoogarden beer, you get a reasonable 38$ (without tip) in total and everything was nothing less than excellent, including the service.

Being a purist when it comes pizza, I typically go for the Margarita which is a perfect ratio of cheese to sauce. It is also fun to get the \"trust your pizzola\" aka mystery pizza which turns out to be a good deal usually coming in at $15. I haven't had a bad one yet.\n\nI have yet to try any entrees as I am stuck on the typical combination of splitting an appetizer (typically of the calamari variety - they change up the preparation methods frequently - but it is always delicious) and then splitting a pizza. This is perfect for 2 people - perhaps supplemented by a salad if you want a little extra.\n\nIf you are looking for a quiet, romantic, impressive dinner, I'm not sure this would be the place as the service could be spotty and you may end up at the pizza counter (this happened to me last time even though I had a reservation). As long as you have a bit of patience, and are not annoyed with a typical influx of people waiting around the bar and hostess area either to get a seat or just as their final destination - A16 is a great local pick. Prices aren't terrible and food quality is good.

All the other dishes were excellently executed. The service was attentive.I kind of like how the restaurant has two very distinctly different looking dinning areas. It was nice use of the space. I was sort of expecting more from the menu than what we saw. This place gets a lot of buzz, but I would definitely drop by on my next trip to SF to be a good judge of the rest of their menu.", "author": "Josie V."}

We came on a Monday night, we got in right away with our reservation and the service was good.  As soon as we sat down, we were told that there was a change to the menu and the cod was to be replaced with swordfish.  Well, since swordfish is better than cod (what?...it is), I ordered that...and it was SO good!  The sauce that came on top was some sort of capery green goop and it was wonderful!  My date said his meatballs were good too.\n\nThe wine we ordered was great.  We ordered, \"Walnut cake with crema fresca panna cotta and rosemary caramel\" for dessert.  It was awesome.  I was very pleased with my experience and would definitely go back.", "author": "PrincessPeac H."}

The place was bumpin' on a Sunday night but we sat in the back room where it is definitely quieter than the front. The room looked like an extension of the main restaurant so we had an issue with temperature as it was a little chilly. When they turned on the heat it got quite hot. \n\nWe split the burrata, escarole salad which was a light take on the classic caesar salad, the cappriciosa of the day, two half sized portions of pasta - buccatini with walnut pesto & the infamous maccaronara - oh hell yes! and 2 desserts that were good to OK. Great meal. One complaint was the bread that came with the oh so creamy burrata was hard and dry. \n\nOk, so the pizza was very good, but I have to say it's not the best I've had. Perhaps you can call me one of those NY pizza snobs who likes her pizzas done certain ways. The crust was perfectly charred underneath, had some chew but I found it kind of bland. The toppings that night were fresh and worked well. My favorites were definitely the pastas. Comfort food, the kind that makes you rub your belly and go \"mmmmm\". I wish they weren't so stingy with their portions. Their \"half\" portions are more like 4 small fork fulls. I'd give the food 3.5 stars but since the place is fun and lively and our overall experience was pleasant I'll bump it up to 4. \n\nPerhaps I'll give SF pizza another try next year with Delfina..", "author": "Lizz K."}

Everything went well for the first half an hour, ordered some drinks, came on time, no issues.  About an hour after we finished drinks, we were still waiting for food.  It didn't strike us as a problem until people around us were all getting food even though they had sat down more than half an hour after us.  We flagged down the waiter and he said he would check on it.  It took another 20 minutes, and 2 different managers before we got any food.  On top of that, the waiter never returned until almost the end of the meal, and claimed that the food was late because he didn't put in the order until after we finished appetizers (impossible because that was almost 1.5 hours before the food came).\n\nWhen the food finally came, it was very good except for one dish (only reason for the 2nd star).  That one dish was so bad, I can't believe they try to sell it.  The dish had 7 noodles, all under-cooked and overly salted, and they tried to sell it for $11, unbelievable.\n\nOn top of all that, the manager only took $30 off the bill, there is no way that makes up for the terrible experience I had there, would never go back under any circumstances!\n\nIn summary, good food, atrocious service, don't ever go there, it's overrated, expensive, and the portions are small.  Good pizza though (but there are other places with just as good of pizza for a lot less money if that's all you want).", "author": "Philip G."}

For example, the squid ink tonnarelli is not my thing (the taste, texture, and way it looks).\n\nBut there are so many things that I do enjoy here that it definitely deserves 5 stars.

The pastas also are available in half portions, which is great when theres only two of you and you want to try a pizza and two pastas - we had the bucatini with walnut pesto, which was nice and creamy and nutty, and the famed maccaronara with ricotta salata - the ragu was savory and rich and clung nicely to the homemade, perfectly chewy pasta.\n\nWe did the Cappriciosa, which is kind of like Dealer's Choice for pizza - basically you just trust the pizzaiolo to make your pizza and you can't make any specifications. Since I really have no food aversions I thought this was a fun idea and we ended up with a great pizza - smoked moz, regular mozz, grana padano, roasted garlic,  chiles, pancetta, and treviso. \n\nSpeaking of, the chili oil is pretty spicy, so use sparingly!", "author": "Jenn C."}

I did not check the Yelp reviews until less than an hour before we arrived. I noticed that there was quite a wide range of star ratings which always makes me suspicious. Unfortunately, my worst fears were realized.\n\nWe were pretty disappointed with just about everything. It didn't help that parents with small child sat right across from us who allowed their kid to pretty much trash the table and surrounding area with baby food and Cheerios. Since this is a neighborhood restaurant, it was pretty common to see small children around.\n\nThe food was honestly marginal at best. The pizza was uninspiring, lacking of any depth or character. We ordered the Mozzarella Burrata and while better than the pizza, I have had much better. The best part of the evening were drinks at the wine bar where the 2 bartenders were very nice and talkative. I will say that the waitress did not rush us through the meal which was very nice but probably held up the reservation list.\n\nBy the time we left, the place was a mob scene. I literally couldn't exit the restaurant there were that many people in the reception area. I had to say excuse me 3 times to get people to move so we could walk out. This is not the place you want to be in case of a fire or earthquake....\n\nI want to rate this as a single star but will toss out a 2 star rating because one of the bartenders was a Sharks Fan.", "author": "Steve D."}

One's as open and bright while the other is dim and more intimate.  Either way, both seem to suit my palate.  It wasn't until an article revealed that A16 was getting a particular batch of Good Family Beef when my friends and I decided to take full advantage of it.  Good solid beef for something other than steak, gotta try it.  (if you're looking for it now, sorry to disappoint.  They only had a limited batch and it was over 6 months ago. )\n\nWe got to sit at the corner by the kitchen where we could see the chef throwing the braised short ribs into that 950 degree oven like a hot cake and tossing it around like it was nothing.  Then with a few pizza twirls going into the oven, it's truly amazing seeing what they're doing and being so close to that raging heat.  Also noticed they dressed almost everything in a generous amount of olive oil.  *inspiration time* Watching the kitchen just gives you that much more appreciation for the time and effort that goes into your meal.  \n\nSo aside from the ribs, we had a bunch of the following:\n-Meatballs - comes in 5 with side of char and pickled onions.  Meatballs were a bit disappointing since I recently had Original Joes in North Beach and it tasted better.\n-Braised Good Family Short Ribs over kale - so damn good and tender with the jus sauce being perfectly dressed.\n-Margarita pizza - good with a thin crust except for a little bit of floppy from the sauce, but the sauce is pretty on point.  Not a fan of the tough mozzarella though.  I prefer more of a creamy softer kind.\n-Roasted Polenta - good with the beef but kinda saltier than hoped\n-Mashed beans - great flavor and nicely mild to go with the beef, but TOO damn thick.  Like Adolf L. says, its like the 2nd bite is a WHAM across the face.\n-Squid Ink Pasta with Uni and cherry tomatoes - pretty good, but nothing extraordinary.  The sauce may have been too overpowering on the uni but the pasta was al dente and had a nice texture.  Cherry tomatoes on the other hand may have been roasted and didn't quite go well with the rest in my opinion. \n\n\nOverall, neat place, great view of the kitchen if you get seated there, but food has a bunch of hit or misses.", "author": "Vincent K."}

After all I must be nuts, we did sit next to Nancy Pelosi last time so it MUST be good right?\n\nFast forward to last month, a few friends visiting from out of town so I went against my gut and went to this highly rated place.  Once again disappointed.  The ONLY thing good there is the burrata (sp?) cheese.  The menu is very limited, and you'd think that would mean that everything was a 10/10.  Not even close.

Did this have something to do with our less than perfect experience? Who knows, but that's the reason I'm going with.\n\nWe started with the famed mozzarella burrata with olive oil and sea salt. The mozzarella was out of this world; the crostini it was served with however, was burnt to a crisp. So much so, that upon first bite, the burned taste overpowered the delicate flavor of the sublime mozzarella. We asked our server if we could have non burned crostini because the burned flavor was taking away from the cheese and she told us sure, but just so we know, all of the bread is cooked uniformly. Um, ok, then why is the couple beside us munching on perfectly golden crostini with their mozzarella? \n\nThe salumi sampler of americano, berkshire and speck prosciutto was also a porky treat and the calamari with butter beans was an unexpected combination that went well together and was perfectly cooked. \n\nMy squid ink cavatelli with house-made baccala, cherry tomatoes, green olives and chiles was a disappointment. I appreciated the layered flavors and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, but the finish was so spicy that it took away from the delicate flavors. I like spicy, in fact, I crave spicy, but it seemed to me that there was a heavy hand with the use chiles in this dish. \n\nFood aside, the atmosphere was a disappointment. The seats were so jam packed, it was like we were on a double date with the couple beside us who were quite obviously on their first date.

It was a wind tunnel affect. The noise bouncing from the two chatty girlfriends and the booming sound from the three drunk men gave us the worst headache. We couldn't eat my pizza fast enough!

Can't complain when you come late, but hate to be seated 40 mins after your res time.\n\nAnyway, we felt that service was good throughout the night. Everyone was friendly, answered questions, drinks and dishes came at the right time, etc.\n\nI think I had always heard good things about this place, but after checking the reviews earlier that day, I was having my doubts. I'd say it was a solid 3-star, maybe 3.5-star due to the good service, experience.\n\nWe ordered the pizza with housemade sausage to start and were able to finish that between 2 people. It was pretty good, but the pizza at other places like Zero Zero, Flour and Water, Farina, etc, is all much better. Then I had the pasta that is supposedly their specialty - the Maccaronarra with ragu. This was okay. The sauce was simple, but good, but I agree with many other reviews, the pasta was seriously under-cooked.  I cook a lot myself and can respect an al dente pasta but this definitely has more than a bit. I didn't send it back, wasn't worth it, plus you always start to question -- is this how it's supposed to be?? but it definitely wasn't my preference. My husband had the pork chop with a side of asparagus, which I always warn him about getting as he raves about the pork chop at Marlowe and is always disappointed when he gets it elsewhere.\n\nWe were celebrating my husband's birthday and they brought out a little sorbet with a candle which was a nice gesture. Overall, it wasn't a bad meal, but the food definitely wasn't good enough to bring us back again.\n\nWhen we were walking out, the hostess wished my husband a happy birthday which was really nice of her to make the connection.", "author": "Lauren M."}

People w/reservations are seated in the rear at normal height tables.  \"Walk-ins\" are seated at high bar tables in the middle and at the counter facing the kitchen at the rear.\n\nMade a last minute reservation for a 530 seating. Got there a little early and ordered a carafe of 2006 Turley Old Vine Zin  (a very nice wine) at the bar until we were seated.  Got very crowded at the entrance with people waiting for the dining area to be opened. There was a little confusion about whether they would add the wine to our dinner tab (rather than have to pay in advance) and deliver the glasses and carafe to our table when seated, but both happened when requested. \n\nSat at the rear in the reserved dining area, which seems the nicest place to eat. The tables for 2 are a bit small and all of the tables are pretty close together. The wait staff and busboys are in constant motion between the tables and service was very good.  The service station for dining in the rear is only a few steps away from most tables and our waiter paid close attention to all of his tables as he breezed by between all of them. Only had to ask for water once and got it by just raising my glass to get the attention of the busboy to brought over a small carafe of H20. Never got any bread that others have said was very good.  It wasn't offered, didn't ask for it and didn't notice that it was missing.  So, I guess it didn't matter. \n\nThere is a very limited selection of entrees (4?) which seemed a bit too pricey in the mid to hi $20's, but there's a broad selection of starters, pizzas and pasta with prices in the $teens. Had grilled sardines and a rabbit terrine (pate) with an spicy fennel sausage pizza along w/the wine and a honey gelato and a lemon mint sorbet for dinner which was all very good for $90 including tip.  Not bad considering the wine was about 1/3 the total cost. \n\nReservations recommended.  The walk in tables and counter seats are quickly taken, so arrive early or be prepared to wait if you don't have a reservation and maybe even if you do.  Seemed odd that there were empty tables in the rear even though there were people still waiting for tables, but most of the empty tables were for parties of 4 (not 2), which may be why they were empty.  In any case, it's definitely worth the effort to try get in for a meal.", "author": "Martin C."}

I wonder what it would retail for, maybe half what the restaurant charges, but that's how it goes. \n\nWe started with the Burrata, and it was nice, but was more like egg white than anything else. It is supposedly something they are famous for, but left us more disappointed. The salt and olive oil made it better than it would have been served naked. \n\nWe had the Margherita pizza and that was good, but not as good as others I've had. I liked the chili sauce they serve ... it's not dried flakes, but more like chili sauce you would find at an Asian restaurant. Different, but better than plain old flakes. \n\nThe Maccaronara Pasta which every body raves about was just like Ragu, and nothing special. We should have ordered the larger portion, because the regular size is just enough to feed a child ... and a child that ate just before going to dinner. \n\nThe desserts were hit and miss. My Almond Semifreddo was the clear winner over the Chocolate and Olive Oil Torte. It was easy to point that out and rub it in a bit. \n\nI am not sure how A 16 fares now that Nate Appleman has left, but I am willing to give it more tries. \n\nI really wanted to try the Salumi plate, but didn't because I would be the only one eating it.

My brother was in town for a few hours and we had to catch an early dinner. I booked a 5:30 res on Open Table Sunday with no problem. We were sat in the back area along the wall. \n\nWe split the margarita pizza to start with. We were both starving so having the pizza come about 5-6 minutes after we ordered was a treat. The crust was nice and chewy. It was a bit oversauced which made fork and knife the best option. I really enjoyed the chili oil on top instead of the usual parm and crushed red. I'd say this pizza was on par or maybe slightly topped by Delfina. \n\nFor dinner, we both ordered the shortribs. I'm a little upset about this since there were several other options I would have like to try (roasted chicken, squid ink pasta, etc.).

It was about 30 seconds underdone - that extra time in the oven would have taken it from good to perfect. \n\nFor dessert we opted for the crespelle (crepes) filled with ricotta and bitter chocolate. It wasn't quite texturally fulfilling - not enough contrast in bite, though the flavor was good and the bitterness of the chocolate cut through the sweetness of the cheese and buckwheat crepes.\n\nService was outstanding - attentive, helpful, thoughtful. \n\nGo early. Choose weeknights. And be prepared to wade through the throngs of humanity crowding the bar on your way out.", "author": "Lindley E."}

We had to stand against a wall (no place to sit) in a cramped area for 40 minutes, as we watched newly arrived groups arrive and be seated. Some had no reservations. No one offered us a drink from the bar (which we couldn't approach as it was blocked with people) or anything. One woman then apologized and said our table was being cleared. We then watched as another party was given that very same table. The woman came back and apologized and said it'd be another 15 or so minutes. We can forgive incompetence, but it appeared as though some members of the staff were just seating their friends and people that they seemed to prefer over us. We never were seated, so I can't review the food. The place was extremely loud and stuffy. Water leak in the sink in the dirty women's bathroom. Never again! We've eaten many times at A16 in Rockridge and had a much better experience. In this case, we left and went to Mezes Greek Kitchen and Wine Bar a few doors down and were warmly welcomed by the staff and enjoyed a nice meal there.

Sad. Apparently they have something called Meatball Monday which we missed out on because of that.\n\nWe tried again on Tuesday around 7pm and had to wait over 30 minutes for a table which we don't typically do but since we'd heard good things, we waited. We gave them our cell # and they called to tell us when a table was ready. It was very full (the restaurant isn't huge to start with). Most of the patrons were young and trendy with a few families - our table neighbors were speaking French and some people were wearing jeans and sandals so there was a good mix of people even though the atmosphere was sort of 'posh'. The hostesses were both very nice.\n\nOur server, Emily was super nice and helpful. We started with their special of the day which was a gnocchi dish with spinach. I think it just came in an appetizer size which we shared along with a bowl of their meatball soup (had to try the meatballs SOMEhow! ;) -- both were excellent. The gnocchi was tender and the soup broth was light and very flavorful.\n\nI ordered their Fregula as my entree (there are 2 size options - $10 or $18 - I ordered the smaller one since we got some apps and I was definitely full) which had big English peas and marscapone - amazing flavor. The texture of the little fregula pastas was lovely, too.\n\nThe other entree we order was the Halibut with eggplant, squid and summer squash. The halibut was so flavorful - good texture - and the vegetables and squid were the perfect companion to the fish. The squid wasn't too chewy either which is the usual complaint.\n\nWe got a carafe of Grillo wine which is likened to a Chardonnay. It was really good and oaky and went well with both of our entrees. \n\nAs a side to the halibut we ordered the Roasted Sunchokes with capers, chiles and onions. Delicious! Definitely recommend getting these.\n\nFor dessert we got the Peach Crostata with Honey Gelato which was light and lovely and not too sweet, though the crust to fruit ratio was a little off for my taste - slightly on the bready side. \n\nAll around a really nice experience - a very flavorful and artful meal. More expensive than we would typically go for but worth it.", "author": "Natalie M."}

NO SHAME. \n\nI met a friendly older couple from NYC who were seated next to me. They were a course ahead, and gave me a fabulous preview of my meal. After half a glass of some fantastic Campanian white wine recommended by the server, I ordered the friarelli peppers with anchovies for a starter, at their recommendation. I thought it was very good, if a tad salty (anchovies are new for me). \n\nThe gnocchi has been discussed here before. All I will say is, GET THE FULL ORDER. I got the half order, then tried unsuccessfully to make googly eyes at the hot, tattooed cook who was responsible for this fluffy potato heaven, hoping he would sneak me some more. No dice. I had to settle for sopping up the broth with my bread. \n\nTwo glasses of wine later, I agreed to a bitter almond semifreddo with cornflour cake and apricots and nectarines. This was, hands down, one of the most incredible things I have ever eaten, ever. EVER.  Whoever you are, pastry chef, I will find you and marry you.

We first got the raspberry crostata, served warm with a big scoop of ricotta gelato.  We then moved on to the chocolate tart with sea salt and olive oil.

The meat *looked* beautiful, but the flavor wasnt there at all. This cut is very lean, which I typically love...but my steak had no seasoning or juices. It was also a really tough piece of meat. The garnishes hardly present, and I would have liked a little more salsa verde to spice up this disappointing entree.\n\nCorn on the cob was fantastic, but I can't fathom paying $6 for something I can make on the grill at home in 10 minutes for 79 cents.\n\nI had the almond cake for dessert, with sage semi-freddo. First off, there was nothing SEMI about this FREDDO. Secondly, I'm really a fan of desserts that arent too decadent, rich, and sweet. I really thought the sage flavors would meet my needs for a toned down dessert, but instead it tasted like someone tossed thanksgiving stuffing on top of my cake. The sweet and savory combo didn't work at all, and I found it almost nauseating. The roasted nectarines were also incredibly sour tasting.\n\nOver all, I can't imagine paying these prices for such bad service and mediocre food.

We told them the name our reservation was under and there were 3 people at the hostess stand staring at the screen for what seemed like 3 minutes trying to figure out where to seat us.  What was odd was that once we said our name none of them welcomed us or greeted us or even looked us in the eye.  They all stared at the screen trying to figure out what to do.  They could use a little better customer service training.\n\nOther than that, great experience, we'll definitely be going back.", "author": "S. T."}

Living in the bay area for several years, and sampling some of its many delicious restaurants, the simple approach to fresh ingredients at A 16 has won my taste buds over time and time again. The wine list is not intimidating, coupled with a staff happy to aid your selection, I usually go for the prosecco.\n\nThe burrata: creamy and tender, as old Italian cheese makers would have it be. The sea salt and fruity olive oil, all spread atop a crispy crostini make for the perfect start to the fantastic meal which awaits. \n\nThe tuna conserva: light and flaky, paired with the fava beans and roasted peppers are like a little party of flavor in your mouth.\n\nThe beet salad: i didn't necessarily have a taste before beets before I tried this salad, but let's just say it won me over. \n\nThe calamari: be nice to yourself and just order one. Each is spectacular in their own way.\n\nThe salumi: hand picked and delicious.\n\nThe pizza: i think I've tried them all, and none disappoint. However I am classicist, and always go for the Margherita. Closest to pizza to  Naples I have ever experienced in the US.\n\nThe squid ink cavatelli: one of my most favorite items on the menu. Perfectly made pasta, with the essence of ocean as only an ingredient such as squid ink can provide.  \n\nThe beef stufato: although the black cod is one of the best I've had, I love red meat, and the beef stufato is divine. Perfectly cooked, paired with the currents and the herb gremolata, a delicate balance achieved once again by the chiefs at A 16.\n\nThe cannellini beans: pair with any meal and the smooth puree will highlight any entree.", "author": "Aimee N."}

However, I am the odd-ball here who did and whats worse is that the restaurant is less than two blocks walking distance from the apartment.  My first experience with A16's menu was one late night when we attempted to make the Monday Meatballs.  For someone who is not usually a meatball fan, I was blown away.  I enhaled more than I had an appetite for and was looking forward to visiting A16 when the time was right.  Apparently, this past weekend was that time.\n\nWe were those horrible people that showed up as one of the last tables.  The hostess tried to pretend everything was fine as I watched her scurry back to the manager on duty and confirm it was oki-doki to seat us.  When you walk into A16, the ceiling is low hanging and the bar is directly to the right.  You can't really see anything else beyond wood and some high bar tables.  As the hostess leads us through the bar and up a hallway, the restaurant suddenly opens up and its a completely different experience.  Ambiance alone, five stars for sure.  The ceilings were high and there was an experience of being in a secret room where only the 'cool kids with their pumped up kicks' go.  Instead of the bar to your right now, you will find the kitchen open to be viewed by diners and lined with bar seating.  I made sure not to sit there, otherwise I would have been talking to myself while the boyfriend drooled on the glass watching the cooks at work.\n\nWe were seated at a small two-top (not the best table in the house but whatever) and quickly greeted by our waitress.  This waitress (won't name names) was not horrible by any means, but she definitely was not oh so happy to see us.  And I'm sorry, but anytime you find yourself rationalizing that the waitress 'must have had a rough shift' or 'oh, its because we are her last table' - NO PASS!!!  First table is no different from the last table, the table who is buying appetizers and one cocktail should be treated with just as much enthusiasm as those buying the most expensive bottle of wine.  A16 has a reputation and it would behoove the wait staff to try to ensure their customers look forward to returning. (Sorry - had to get that out of my system.)\n\nThe boyfriend and I usually share everything because that was we are able to cover more of the menu.  To start, we had the cured salumi appetizer with pickles and grissini.  The salumi was really wonderful and paired delightfully with the pickles.  Each item had a fluffy texture to it, which was suprising to the heavy, chewiness I was expecting.  To follow, we shared the Funghi pizza and a tripe pasta.  The Funghi pizza was good, but it missed that final flavor note.  I can't say what it was specifically.  From New York to California, pizza is an experience that takes over the entire palette.  Somewhere towards the end of each bite I would find myself swallowing hard in search of something I would never find.  The tripe pasta was fantastic and a definite winner on A16's menu.  Tripe can be an intimidating ingredient because of its inherent texture.  This dish is no longer on the current A16 menu, but it was definitely a treat and the favorite dish of the night.  \n\nWe finished our meal with a sausage and pickled vegetable dish.  This literally left a sour taste in our mouths.  The sausage was house made and really lovely.  The pickled vegetables though were so overpowering and the strong, my tongue was sore the next day.  I didn't know what to make of this final experience at the restaurant.  I plan to return to A16 in the next few months after their menu has changed around with the seasons and hope to find more delights than let-downs.  For now, I can only give 3 stars.", "author": "Jessica C."}

I enjoyed the trendy atmosphere, and the service was superb--very helpful and efficient.  The pizza I would certainly come back for; it makes my Top Ten list.   \n\nOutside of that, the rest of the meal was average.  The burrata app was good, but not something I would be dying to order again.  The cheese literally melts in your mouth.  It had the look and taste of egg white.  I'm a fan of burrata, but maybe not in such a naked fashion.  I'd much prefer it on pizza or in a sandwich. \n\nI was still riding on my high from the soft serve at Picco, so when I saw olive oil and sea salt on the dessert menu, I had to try it.  But the chocolate tart was a disappointment, very bland.  The vanilla semifreddo was the better of the two.  \n\nThe maccaronara pasta wasn't much to speak of, literally--I never really know what to think when they only serve you nine strands.  I was finished with my portion before I had a chance to form an opinion.  But I did notice that it was firmer than desired.  The wine was a good pick, per the server's recommendation, but it wasn't worth the $85 price tag.\n\nA16 hits the mark if you're jonesing for pizza, and perhaps, a drink or two at the bar.  Reservations are recommended.  Like any place in the Marina, go early enough, and the crowd is tolerable.  But after a few drinks, you won't even care.", "author": "Marsha Z."}

I forgot my wallet, only had a few dollars in my bag, and wasn't sure if the back up credit card I had was going to work.  (I am a big fan of redundancy-- I usually keep an extra credit card, an old license and some cash in my day planner, in case something like this happens, but clearly the fates were conspiring :-)\n\nGiven that I was splitting the lunch (cost of my share: $17) and I didn't want to be embarrassed by a \"I'm sorry, but your credit card was just denied\", I discreetly mentioned the situation to the server and asked her if the card was denied to \"fake it\" and I would take care of the bill after my colleague left.\n\nTwenty minutes later (way too long), she finally returns our cards, and when my colleague asks why the delay, she mentioned that she had problems running the cards.   (I notice from the receipt that my card was declined and they didn't even include a pen in the folder for me to \"sign\".)\n\nI say goodbye to my colleague and come back to talk to the server and the manager, and I explain the situation, and offer to hand over the few dollars I have and leave something as collateral, but they tell me that they can't let me leave the restaurant until I pay the bill.\n\nI  offer to call American Express to see if they will take a charge over the phone, I deal with AmEx for 15 minutes, and unfortunately, AmEx can't help.   I offer to write a check to A16 and they won't take that.  I explain that I live in the East Bay, and I'm happy to go home, get my card and call back with my charge info.  They then inform me that they can't take charges over the phone (why they agreed that I should call AmEx initially is beyond me) and tell me again,  I can't leave the restaurant until I pay the bill.   \n\nWe continue to argue for ten minutes, and finally I hand over all of my money, which is $11, I give them my business card, they ask for my license!, I give them the old expired one, and I promise to come back with the $6 that afternoon.  Again, they explain if I don't,  they are going to charge my colleague.\n\nSo, an hour and half later, I come back with my $6 and tell them how disappointed I am with the way they handled the situation.\n\n I can understand how they might have problems with people that dine and dash, but I was professionally dressed and initially tried to calmly explain the situation.  Plus, I was only a few dollars short on a small bill.\n\nNow, they have lost a customer based on $1.50 in food costs and an estimated potential profit of $3.  \n\nUnbelievable how shortsighted they were.

Not talking about loving a Sourdough Jack w/ buttermilk sauce at Jack in the Box... talking about appreciating fresh products prepared well with thought and a real attention to flavor.\n\nAnd ever since I was 18, I wanted to try A16.  It had always been on the top SF eats list.  Raves for their wood oven baked pizzas, homemade pastas, and Monday meatballs.  I don't know why but it took me 10 years to finally come here.  The wait was quite worth it.\n\nA few flaws, but they could be overlooked.  There was a good 15+ min wait for our reservation and I can never adapt to a dining room where tables must be moved to squeeze in other patrons.  I call it the ass to elbow bump... both sides really doesn't need to be feeling that extra friendliness.  It really really irks me, but I have to keep reminding myself SF is sparse on real estate and every inch counts.  So on to the food...\n\nFor a light starter - Mozz burrata.  Definitely made the day of, because it was just oozing with freshness.  Good... perhaps needed a zip more seasoning.\n\nThe funghi pizza was wonderful... mushrooms were cooked well.  It can be so easy to cook it too much where the mushrooms become rubbery and gives you that squeak between your teeth.  Tomato sauce was spot on... how all pizzas should be adorned with.  Crust could have been crispier, but I enjoyed how thin it was and didn't go toward the dry cracker side.  A16 introduced me to chili oil on pizzas... yes genius.\n\nDid not enjoy the squid ink pasta.  It seemed a bit too aldente and there was a strong fishy smell to the dish.  A real turn off... didn't eat half of it.\n\nSo after 3 courses we were getting pretty stuffed, but I booked this on a Monday and I wanted my meatballs, which they forgot to order for us.  Thought it would have came before the pizza.  It managed to come out in less than 5 minutes and despite our filled stomachs we trekked on.  And it was ah-mazing.  Great flavor... cheesy... and fluffy.  Can you describe a meatball that way?  Well, it definitely wasn't a dense mound.  \n\nOverall a pleasant dining experience.

Also, the crowd wasn't really my type.  A bit pretentious.  The table next to us was arguing over which sorority at Stanford was the best (although they were well into their 40's) and then gloated about how much money they made.  It was kinda lame.

What the hell, we gave them a shot and WOW what a great dish.  Cooked to perfection and flavor oozing all over the place.\n\nAlso worth mentioning was the wine.  We gave our waiter some general guidelines (Max $60, Italian, red, medium body) and asked him to pick a wine for us.  He grabbed an obscure bottle from Sardinia and now I'm frantically trying to find where I can buy more for myself!\n\nOnly knock on this place is that it's filled with \"beautiful people\".

My hubby and I shared the \"Funghi\", which at A16 is made without red sauce, but we asked to add a little red sauce and also a little regular mozzarella (to mix it with the smoked mozzarella and make it a more delicate taste): the pizza was phenomenal, perfect dough, delicious mushrooms, perfect amount of everything - stellar! I would highly recommend it with the changes we made, but even without, the dough and ingredients were so good that I can't imagine a bad pizza here. \n\nWe immediately agreed that we would DEFINITELY GO BACK to have their pizza. Then, the main course arrived. We wanted to try multiple dishes. I got the Tuna Conserva without olives (can't stand olives) and he got the small portion of pasta Maccaronara with ragu napoletano e ricotta salata. Both were delicious, but the pasta was SO amazing that it tasted like a dish we had in a small osteria in Tuscany. It was so good that at this point neither me or my husband could decide if we liked the pizza or the pasta better.... never before.  \n\nThe service was attentive and the wine was good. The menu is not very large - which threw me off at the beginning - but I guess that the few items are so amazing that it does not matter. \n\nYou definitely need to get there early and be ready to wait at least an hour.... I would recommend a reservation (well in advance, as they are always booked on same-week). With the reservation they seated us immediately.

One of our pasta dishes, though both small, had a fair amount more than the other. I would suggest asking about serving size, then consider getting one small dish and a second regular sized dish- that way you both eat enough, not too much, AND get to sample a couple items.\n\n-The front room, for walk-ins and those who dont mind bar dining, is terribly noisy and dark. You may be tempted to post up here due to the wait, but I recommend sticking it out with some vino and getting cozy in the back.\n\nPROS:\n-Well...the FOOD. We started with Roasted Beet Salad (super fresh and sweet, it would make a great summer salad!) and their famous Bruschetta (the roasted Chanterelle mushrooms are heaven). For our mains, we had the Quattro formaggi Ravioli and a spinach gnocchi that had mushrooms and a spicy, red peper, oil sauce. Gnocchi is usually so heavy, I can'f finish half the plate. This gnocchi was light, packed with flavor, and the small portion size made it easy to finish. For dessert, I tried their newly debuted rosemary cake with caramelized apples and a thick, cold, creamy cheese (whose name escapes me) that sits as a block on top of the cake and tastes like a delicious cheesy gelato. INCREDIBLE. We also got a cherry crostata with lemon gelato- beautiful and delicious.\n\n-The wine list is so extensive its difficult to choose a bottle- so I recommend sampling a few glasses, as the bartenders are more than happy to let you try a few different kinds before settling on your next glass.\n\n-The ambiance in the back of the restaurant is better lit, more cozy, and thankfully quieter than the front. We had the pleasure of getting to sit up at the chef's bar, which is a real treat if you can manage it. Its nice to see all the food prep and be kept comfortable by the fire of the wood stove. \n\nOverall, the food and wine were stand-out, and the service was friendly and informative.

I replied that I reserved a month ago, but the answer was still a very rude 20 minutes.  It took 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge our presence at the table and it took 2 times to ask for water.  We ordered the Burrata and it came with only 5 thin pieces of bread.  We asked for more bread twice to finish the Burrata and finally received a basket with 3 small pieces and the waiter said that they were \"out of bread.\"  Seriously??? What Italian restaurant on a major holiday weekend runs out of bread. Unacceptable.   The food was served in a timely fashion and the pasta was extremely salty.  Do not order the cookie plate.  Cookies were flavorless and not worth the $16 price tag...an icky rosemary cookie... terrible combo.

But then again rabbit is my favorite meat - along with veal. Basically if you are a small, innocent, helpless animal, I want to eat you.\n\nThe only food that was absolutely out of this world was dessert, namely the lemon ricotta gelato.

My boyfriend has actually been a couple of times without me. And he loves it. The one other time that I have been it was wonderful. I had the halibut with farro, lemon and cherry tomatoes. It was to die for. So tonight we had our usual date night, except that my boyfriend is moving in a week for a great job opportunity and we were excited to celebrate.  I digress.   We arrived for our reservation, on time, but waited 20-30 minutes because they didn't have a table. Alright we're over that. No biggie. \n\nAppetizer took another 25 minutes. It was a bruschetta. Granted it was good. But what takes 25 minutes?\n\nMy halibut-that I was so excited for: Epic fail A16. It looked awesome. As I cut into it though, I noticed pink juice came streaming out. Cooked halibut is bright white with clear juice. Cut in  just a but further, it was completely raw below the barely seared outside. I stuck my finger in to test the temperature and it was lukewarm. Not slightly pink and opaque. We're talking RAW. About an 1/8\" sear and then pink, translucent, R-A-W all the way through. I was horrified.  We snagged a server who had brought it out but wasn't our original server and he was as horrified as I. He took it away quickly. My boyfriend continued eating his pizza and I my summer squash. Then our original server brought the fish back about 10 minutes later. Okay. Now I can eat, though I'm now terrified because I was once hospitalized by contaminated food. But anyway, our server comes back and asks, \"How was your halibut, I know it came out late.\" Late? No, not late. In fact it appears that it was quite early as it was RAW. Don't get me wrong, she was absolutely lovely (And really knew her wine!). But I don't think they told her what happened. Not one person apologized. Nor did they offer any sort of anything--like some bread to go with my side, or just something to smooth it over. (though I am appreciative that the server that took it back didn't so much as bat an eye as I asked for new silverware since mine had touched the poor, raw fish.) No one was disrespectful. They were all quite pleasant actually. But it didn't seem that anyone was concerned that they had just served me my meal still swimming.\n\nSo 2 stars to be shared between the first time we went, our server and my boyfriend's pizza.  Maybe it was an off night. We had 3 different people come to our table for something, but it really seemed that the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing tonight. \n\nThe minus 3 is for the late seating, the wait for the appetizer and my seriously swimmy, probably stopped flipping on the way to the table halibut that no one apologized for.

With such great appetizers, I found that the main course had a hard time competing for my attention. I found myself looking forward to the beginning and ends of the meal.\n\nOverall, A16 is a solid and dependable restaurant, but not a place that will blow your mind. My advice is to drop by for the bookends of your meal.", "author": "Vince H."}

Our reservation for 7pm was a great call because the restaurant was very busy and it looked like a long wait. We were seated immediately and service was very good.  The octopus appetizer was phenomenal. Hearty pieces of octopus combined with green olives, peas, crisp potatoes, parsley and a sweet sauce. The sautee clams were very good as well with a perfect broth and delicious rustic bread. The gnocchi was nothing extraordinary, but gnocchi in a light sauce with mushrooms. There was a seasoning or flavor lacking to the gnocchi. I could not decide between a pizza with sauce or without and we got the best of both worlds. A pizza with the sauce on the side. The dough was baked to perfection and the toppings were plentiful but not overwhelming. Definitely come for the appetizers and wine or a pizza, but the pasta left something in comparison to the perfect pizza. All in all a wonderful dinner experience. Also the sommelier had a nose ring and was super fine.", "author": "Christopher K."}

A friend and I decided to check out this place last Saturday night without a reservation.  As we expected, the wait was quite long, however the hostess tried very hard to accommodate us during our longer than anticipated wait.  So I would recommend having a reservation, especially over the weekend.  \n\nThe Memorable Parts:\n- Friendly/Helpful Service (Wait staff recommended a nice wine that wasn't necessarily the highest price.)\n\n- Tuna conserva with new potatoes, gaeta olives, bronze fennel and celery (Very interesting starter)\n\n- Salsiccia - fennel sausage, roasted peppers, roasted onions, mozzarella, grana padano, garlic, chiles (Tasty. Do not underestimate the size of their pizza as I did.)\n\n- Villa dora, gelsonero, lacryma christi del vesuvio, 2004  (Very smooth. I would recommend.)\n\nI would like to try this place again.

At these prices, I'm not expecting my waiter to be wearing super tight skinny jeans and a well worn, ripped collar black t-shirt.  The sommelier was dressed nicely and was equivalently helpful.  She must have noticed me scouring the menu for my Italian fav, Valpolicella, which was unfortunately nowhere to be found.

The Asparagus was quite flavorful.  But, I found the Fava Beans to be underwhelming -- just a wrong texture and mouth feel for me.  Others may like it just fine.

I live around the corner and can never resist an amazing glass of vino for a reasonable $8, but the last trip was the inspiration for this review. I went with my girlfriends and we were ushered to their very cute patio in the back. I stopped counting the passing minutes before we had any sort of acknowledgement. When someone did appear, I got a table of water instead of a glass. The hasty busser poured it all over the table instead of into the glass- and then walked away without even noticing. Leaving the table, the brown paper and me soaking wet. Thanks! \n\nResting upon their laurels, the service at this place has gone on a fast downward spiral. If you are 'lucky' enough to wait the two hours and snag a table, you might be serving the waiters instead of vice verse. I once walked out of this place after sitting at the chef's table for 20 minutes, never receiving anything- not even a nod of the head from anyone. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the food is great. A must is the mozzarella burrata and the la quercia tasting. But sometimes there is a point when the service overrides the food experience and leaves a sour taste. \n\nDue to William Werner's mastery of all things sweet, desserts have a lot to live up to in my book. While SPQR's panna cotta is wonderful, and the idea of chocolate and sea salt are amazing, I was disappointed in the ratio of salt and chocolate in this dish, it is showered in salt. I will say this is an excellent pre-marathon dessert. You will be able to intake enough water and never be depleted of your sodium during your race. \n\nThe stars are for the decor, food (which is pretty dam good and I think reasonably priced for the quality), and the wine. The service just takes away from everything.", "author": "Megan M."}

I was immediately won over by two dishes that I LOVED - the sweet roasted corn and the oven roasted peppers. Well, I don't know WHY, but they've chosen to take those items OFF the menu. I have never seen them come back. I've been back twice since then, hoping to be enamored by some other amazing dish, but so far...nothing has met my expectations. \n\nIt's really unfortunate and which is why I'm conflicted in this review. I love the A16 of the PAST. The A16 at current, does not impress me. Last time I went, I had the Squid Ink Tonnarelli, which was basically pasta that had squid ink in it. YES, it's black. I think the idea is more exciting than the actual dish. It tasted good but still didn't bring back the nostalgic feelings of the corn and peppers of the past. \n\nAlso, their pizzas, while good, really aren't anything special. \n\nI suppose the specialty of A16 is that they have wood-burning ovens. I've sat at the counter facing these ovens everytime I've been to A16 and there is something really cool about watching the chefs prepare the food and place it in the flames. \n\nBut what I really want is those roasted peppers and the corn to come back. So until they do, I probably won't be frequenting A16 anytime soon.", "author": "Esther J."}

A16 is another notch in the belt, a challenging experience that left me wondering whether five stars would have been justified had I not felt like all of humanity's asses and elbows were being continually thrust in and upon my face. And to the loving couple seated next to us: no, dude, you need not lick her hand during your date--it really isn't necessary. \n\n'I'm a reasonable man. Get off my case.' \n\nI'm definitely a fan of the wine selection and applaud A16 for offering such a wide variety of Italians by the glass.

Get off my case.' \n\nOur group of four shared a platter of salumi, which included two varieties of prosciutto and mortadella. My mortadella palate is a bit inexperienced, but was pleased nonetheless. The prosciutto were equally as pleasing, but did not leave anyone wanting for more. The platter screamed out for some type of accompaniment to offset the pork fest. \n\n'I'm a reasonable man.

A neutral review on the bucatini dish, which looked prettier than it tasted. \n\nI went for the Berkshire pork chop. It was a bit on the dry side inside (brining anyone?), but well seared with a house mustard on the outside. I didn't think it paired particularly well with the bitter greens on the plate, though. My side of baked polenta was reminiscent of corn bread, and not in a good, buttery way. \n\n'I'm a reasonable man.

They're both bald and from Ohio, but Nate is heavier-set, tattooed, and a much better cook.  It definitely shows in the popularity of his two restaurants, A16 and SPQR.  As a result, reservations during regular dining hours are hard to come by.  Fortunately, the restaurant has a walk-in policy for those without reservations who are willing to take a chance and wait for an open table.  I actually timed it perfectly by going there on a Friday night after catching an 8pm Joe Rogan show at Cobb's.  My reservations were for 10:30pm - we got there at 9:45 and had a table by 10pm.\n\nFood:  4 stars.  For starters, we had the mozzarella burrata (way better than Perbacco's) and the margherita pizza (delicious, but too much dough in the crust).  Main courses were the maccaronara (fresh, but nothing special at all) and the braised beef short ribs genovese (heaven!) accompanied by the flavorful roasted potatoes.  The unfortunate thing about dining at 10pm became apparent when we ordered the dessert.  Three of the desserts were unavailable, including the highly-anticipated chocolate budino tart.  We settled for the honey panna cotta, which was....interesting.\n\nService:  4 stars.  Service here is good, but a tad slower than I would prefer.  Our server was really nice and gave us some good recommendations (except for the maccaronara).  Otherwise, no big complaints from me.\n\nAtmosphere:  3 stars.  You could tell the restaurant is stretched for space, as the bar area in front is crowded, there are waits for the one-person restrooms and tables, and there is a small room in back that was converted into additional dining space (which is where we sat for the night).  Huge pluses for the hot Marina crowd.  Unfortunately for some reason, they seated us right next to the only old couple in the restaurant.  Even worse, the tables were practically connected (only separated by the glass dividing the small dining room from the large dining room).  It's a little off-putting to dine in plain view of liver spots (I kid!!!!).  On the plus side, the glass shielded us from having to engage in conversation with them (which ended up happening to the other table adjacent to them).    \n\nHits:   Mozzarella burrata, braised beef short ribs, hot crowd.\n\nMisses:  Maccaronara, reservations, narrow space.\n\nIf You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  SPQR, Delfina, Perbacco", "author": "Keith C."}

The lamb was OK, but I am not a big fan of cannelloni and had I known that is what it was I probably would not have ordered it.  So that is more about my personal preference, just going by the quality of the dish and what they did with it, it was amazing.  We all kind of shared and the sole was out of this world.

Fair enough, reservations are made, and, in good time, pizza is consumed.  Minds aren't blown, but that may be because the minds in question have been east of the Mississippi.

Didn't this place used to be a laundromat at one time?\n\nIn all the years I've been coming here, I've never had a real sit-down dinner here as I prefer to hang for wine and appetizers at the bar.  If you choose to eat on the restaurant side, then YMMV (your mileage may vary) as I'm rating this as a wine bar with food.  My usual routine is to hit the bar for two or three nice glasses of wine and something simple and romantic to share or nibble on, usually pizza or a bit of pasta.    \n\nThe wines by the glass are always changing (nice selection!) and I always find something intriguing that I want to try.  Their Italian reds (and whites) by the glass are always fun for me since they always have something different and interesting that I am not familiar with, unlike California wines.  I love California wines, but trying something different makes me feel like a wine virgin, all over again.  I don't know who their wine steward is or if they even have one, but I've always taken delight in the selections I've sampled here.\n\nI ordered their margherita pizza again as I believe it's the perfect accompaniment when you're sampling new wines.  Light, crispy, and trendy (not necessarily a compliment), it's been consistently good for me although outside of this environment, I'd probably want something far more substantial for $14.\n\nNot sure if it's because of the bad economy or perhaps it's my imagination, but the pricepoints for their wines by the glass seemed lower this time than before with more wines priced at $11 per glass and lower.  A nice trend since you and a friend can enjoy more.  \n\nThen again, by paying just another two or three dollars more you can get into some selections you often don't see elsewhere (especially not by the glass) and without commiting to the whole bottle.  I usually go this route.\n\nYes, the wine bar isn't too large and can get pretty loud at times.  I try to avoid going there when it's in full-packed madhouse mode, but when it's calmer, its a wonderful place to be, especially on a date or with someone special.  With the proximity of the waiting area and hostess desk right next to the bar, the people watching and networking opportunities abound as well.  \n\nWine Star is just down the street, but I prefer A16 as it has a slightly older, more sophisticated crowd.  Nice stemware too.  You can always tell the caliber of an establishment by it's stemware.\n\nEvery time I drive or pass by, I'm thinking...I wish I was in there right now.

So much for their recommendations.....\nIt disappointed early on, and it only got worse.\nI was annoyed that the menu they had on the website didn't match the one outside. I understand places change dishes around, but seriously, how hard is it to put \"sample menu\" on the web menu? I found it even more odd that the menu posted outside was different from both the web menu, and the actual menu.\nThey had one fish choice, which also seemed out of place for an Italian restaurant.\nWe decided to share the mozzarella burrata, (another mistake.) It was a lump of runny, tasteless cheese served with 4 tiny crostini. It was ridiculous that they served only four with such a big lump of cheese. Big ripoff, and it wasn't even good. \nMy BF was really excited to try their \"house-cured salumi\", it was in a word- GROSS! It was basically tasteless fat. \nI forgot to mention it took way too long to get our drinks, we actually got our appetizers a few minutes before. \nOur waitress apparently thought she was better  than she was. She took our orders with no pen and paper. i understand there are servers that can do this. but I'm not impressed if you can't get it right. Which of course she didn't.\nShe couldn't even remember what appetizers we ordered. I was waiting for her to mess up the dinner order too. This was the only thing that wasn't a disappointment there. (Yep, she screwed that up too!)\nSo, we waited for our food with hope of it being much better than the appetizers. \nAgain, big mistake.\nI  got the white prawns which were nasty. They had an awful odor, and an even worse taste. Frankly, i was a little surprised anyone would serve them. The presentation was also lacking. I can do better at home. The same can be said of the roasted potatoes. They were bland, and boring. I generally like things a lot more bland than most people, so if i think somethings bland, it has to be really bad.\nI also should mention, we had to ask for refills on our waters. The guy we asked never came back, but finally our server graced us with her presence, and we were lucky she gave us a refill. \nThe prices are completely ridiculous, and the food is some of the worst I've had, \nWithout a doubt, this is the worst experience I've had at a restaurant in the city.\nI'm pretty pissed we wasted the time, and money we did there.

Having just come back from Italy where I ate some of the most amazing Italian fare in the world, A16 left me feeling jipped and unsatisfied. \n\nI started with the beet salad which to be honest, tasted like some weird version of a homemade potato salad - something you would bring to a picnic. It tasted of mustard and was smothered in crumbled almonds. For whatever reason, it just didn't work for me. The gnocchi we ordered was probably the highlight of the evening for me - completely tender and filled with ricotta cheese. The pizza was just eh. I'm a big fan of thin crust pizza but this lacked something...it wasn't crispy enough and the pizza itself, even with prosciutto on it, seemed to lack flavor. \n\nThe dessert was by far the worst part of the evening. We ordered the chocolate tart and for whatever reason, it was jam packed full of rock salt. Every bite tasted like I had just consumed 3 days worth of sodium. I kept on eating thinking that I would eventually get why they would serve this to humans (seemed more suitable to place in front of a cow as a salt lick) but had to stop because I could feel my stomach bloat from water retention.\n\nService was good and the wine that I ordered was enjoyable. I had no idea the restaurant itself was so large! It seemed to go back for miles.

Great selection. I had a couple glasses (yes, I said this was a business lunch) and they were both great. Granted, I was gulping them down trying to escape the heat, but they were good.\n\nThe Service was great. Our waitress was very sweet, knowledgeable and on the ball. I felt bad for her running around in the heat but I never saw her sweat!\n\nThe not so good:\n\nThe bathroom. There is only one for girls and one for boys and they are in the main hallway so you have to wait for a while and you feel sort of stupid in the hallway while waiting and dodging the waiters bustling by and you feel even stupider when you come out of the bathroom and there is a line of people standing RIGHT outside the door hoping that you would hurry the hell up. Its just strange.\n\nThe menu. There was nothing on it! I seriously struggled to figure out what to eat for lunch. There were no pasta dishes to speak of. There were no lunch salads. There were a couple of pizzas, a sausage entree and some sparse salads. In the end, I ordered the meatballs. Just meatballs and sauce...that was it. They were very good, but it was really a boring meal. My dining partners each had pizzas which were way too big for a single/lunch serving. Neither pizza was very exciting.\n\nThe heat!

After much menu reading along Chestnut, the beau decides that A16 would be his #1 preference. I personally would have chosen a different place, but couldn't refuse after seeing how excited he got over the A16 offerings. \n\nThe place was packed, but we were still able to get 2 table choices--a  regular one or one that sits alongside the kitchen. Being the total kitchen enthusiast that he is, of course the beau immediately chooses the latter option. At this point, I was not too happy. Whenever we sit in those type of seats (and we often do, thanks to the beau), I always return home smelling like the aromas of the kitchen for days. However,  it turned out to be an excellent choice. Not only was it very well ventilated but in this kitchen, the cooks are facing you (vs. the usual restaurants where you are staring at their backs & butts). Being able to see the action was quite fun! \n\nOur meal consisted of the following:\n\n-grilled sardines: The appetizer should never be overlooked in terms of importance because it sets the tone for the meal. This was a perfect balance of flavors and textures. Definitely gave us much to look forward to.\n\n-funghi pizza: super fresh with top quality ingredients (enormous in size too). Everything is made in-house. Thin crust with just the right amount of cheese, sauce, and other toppings. I'm not even a huge fan of pizza, but I'd be willing to eat this any time it's offered. \n\n-lamb w/ a side of carrots: Oh my gosh, so good. Even after I was feeling stuffed, I was still trying to get as much of it as possible into my mouth. And it really doesn't do justice to call the carrots a \"side.\" That makes it sound so trivial. Trust me, it is anything but that. Those carrots could definitely hold its own ground.\n\n-Yogurt panna cotta: if you've read any of my previous reviews, you'd know that we always go for the panna cotta. It's the beau's favorite dessert--and we're even willing to forego the bread pudding special (that just means left over bread from the weekends, anyway). HEAVY panna cotta with shortbread & citrus. Nice pairing. Very filling.\n\n-Meatball (to go): Hey, it was Meatball Monday! And sitting by the kitchen, we saw those plated meatballs fly out every other minute. A crowd favorite, obviously.

I heard and read amazing reviews of the pizza and was really looking forward to the experience. Let me break it down: \n\nFood - Pizza was good. I would give it 3.5 stars on it's own. But, compared to other pizza places in San Francisco, I think it deserves only three stars. I prefer Delfina and Pizzetta 211 for thin-crust pizza. If you are opening the playing field to include the east bay, Gather in Berkeley and Pizzaiolo in Oakland are the way to go! \n\nService - Two stars. I was a server for many years in many restaurants from super casual to high end...and I always give service the benefit of the doubt because I know how difficult it can be. The table was not ready on time - ummm, ok, not the end of the world. But after waiting a good 10-15 min beyond the reservation time, I would expect the server to be attentive. Not so. Our server did not show up to the table for another 5-10 min after we were seated. Our drinks came after our appetizer (I have gotten chewed out by former bosses when this happens). She was perfectly friendly, but the overall service was not what I would expect from such a highly rated establishment. \n\nOverall, I'm glad I went. However, I don't think I'll be returning any time soon - or recommending it to friends. There are way too many GREAT pizza places to try!", "author": "Robyn G."}

Sorry, no Daddys allowed.  \r\n\r\nI call it No Man's Land, because no man will come between me and my A16  crew:  Andrew, Benito, Tim and Kevin. \r\n\r\nThe pizza is addictive, with a perfectly charred crust, balanced out with a nice sauce featuring fresh and locally grown ingredients. For an extra kick, if you've got the spine, order the chili oil, then pour a hefty drizzle on.   \r\n\r\nThis is also a friendly, non-snobby wine bar. Just step right up and tell the excellent sommeliers what kind of wine you're looking for. Don't even bother looking at the wine menu. It's always fun to sample various flavors without a big commitment. Hmmm, now I'm sounding like my brothers.   \r\n\r\nThe fine and amenable staff will keep bringing you choices you until you're happy.

Before I had dinner here, pizza for me had become a poor caricature of itself: gooey, doughy, a vomitorium of toppings. But then I tried the Salsiccia, which has fennel sausage, spring onions, grana padano, fresh mozzarella, garlic, and chiles. No drippy sauce (no tomato sauce at all in fact), no gummy crust, no lava flow of mozzarella, no garbage dump of toppings. Just a light thin crust of perfectly cooked dough supporting a cast of savory ingredients that perfectly harmonize into one delicious eating experience.\n\nThe atmosphere here is pretty trendy and noisy, and it seems to be a popular place for groups. The service, as a result, seems a bit harried and distracted, but they are for the most part friendly and helpful.\n\nThey also have a pretty interesting selection of wines from Southern Italy, which I know nothing about. So before ordering that glass, ask the server to pour you a tiny sip (if s/he has the time) so you can test it out. I made the mistake of ordering a full glass upon the recommendation of our server, but I ended up not liking it -- or rather, I did not think it went well with my oh so glorious slices of heaven.\n\nGreat food.

Thanks to Chef Roy, whom i worked with the last year, i got the VIP treatment from the chef de cuisine that night. Chef Appleman (James Beard nominee 2007 best new chef) went to school with Chef Roy at the CIA. however, he was in italy so chef roy told me to introduce myself to the chef de cuisine, Chef Liza. things only got better from there. \n\nBeing from LA, i never expect a restaurant to be busy on a monday night. holy crap, never in my life have i seen so many people packed into a restaurant at 9pm on a monday night. so to start off with i ordered the roasted calamari and meatballs. man those meatballs were out of this world. its not on the menu because they only serve these porky/beefy morsels of goodness on monday. actually i would not have ordered them until chef liza told me about them. the calamari was cooked perfectly tender with a tangy pickled chili salad. then a complimentary plate of house cured lonza came out. yum. i love anything that is cured and made of pork. good balance b/w fat and meat. \n\nthen the pizza came out. as i mentioned in my earlier reviews, antica pizzeria  was/is my favorite pizza place because they are one of the few places that are certified by the italian gov't. once our funghi pizza came out and i took the first bite, i knew this was certified by the italians. man was it good. the crust was chewy and charred. man was it good with their homemade chili oil. i could literally put that stuff on anything. \n\nthen was our pasta course(s). i ordered the tonnarelli (fresh spaghettia pasta) with pork, tomatoes, and corona beans. the beans were whole and mashed and it gave the sauce a creamy velvety texture. very flavorful. then the complimentary anson mills polenta came out. little pieces of guanciale (cured porked jowl) and fava beans topped it off. perfect. by this time i couldnt move out of my chair. \n\nordered a meyer lemon sorbetto and a machiatto and called it a night. talked to the chef for a little bit (only because it was 11:30 and the customers finally died down) and went on my way. great way to start of the week in the bay city.", "author": "Daniel K."}

It's in the Marina, where she repeats over and over that she would live here if she lived in SF (like mother, NOT like daughter), it's charmingly cozy, and the menu has local specials depending on the season and the day. We had the fava bean appetizer, which changed my outlook on those green, flavorless beans (they do have flavor!), the prosciutto sampler platter (and it is BIG), the pizza romano (we're suckers for anchovies) and a half bottle of a beautiful southern Italian red wine that has too many apostrophes in the name to remember.

I can finally write a review for this joint and not just say 'the pizza rocks!\".  \n\nMind you, the pizza DOES rock.  I have dined there 3 times now.  Here's what I have ordered and the ratings:\n\n-Margarita Pizza:  To me, this is a wow.  Very very similar to the ones I have had in Italy.  Super thin bottom crust, a nice thick outer crust, light mild tangy tomato sauce, random placed pieces of mozzarella, and strips of fresh basil.  YUM.\n-Cold cut meat plate:  Nothing super fantastic, but it did come with a variety of cuts that were so-so.  Good if you were looking to eat that, but otherwise, probably pass the next time.  Good selection, however.\n-Tuna conserva - Eh, again, not my cup of tea, but my two friends were all over it.  The tuna was warm - not a fan.  It was tossed in red cabbage and other mix greens.\n-Beef short ribs genovese:  OMG.  Like the ox-tail grandma used to make when you were little.  Sweet, layers of reduction and char, and the ribs were tender like marshmallows.  This rib-less concoction definitely made me forget all the other par apps.\n\nI really cant wait to dig deeper.  Will update more.\n\nAs far as the wine list, if you not Italian-oriented, you will be overwhelmed.  I wasn't sure to just go with the prices or really dig into the meat of the 20 some odd paged wine list.  We opted for a couple glasses the bartender suggested, but they were crappy.  However, there seemed to be quite a selection and if I had the time, I would of requested a sommelier to help pair our food.\n\nThe ambiance is great.  RIGHT in between upscale and casual.  The really made the place work - feels very New Yorkish with very detailed yet soft decor.  Lots of nice lines, fun marble counter tops (chef's table), a wood burning oven (very fun to watch the cooks manage that thing), and nice low-set lighting.  Fun for dates, close friends, and entertaining guests.  Might be bad for a large crowd, but you could try.\n\nOne HUGE takeway - make reservations.

After all, every time I pass A16 it is certainly bustling and the reviews have been so generous.  Yet, even if I had anticipated mediocrity I still would have been disappointed.\n\nThough our reservations were for Sunday evening at 9:30, we were still forced to wait in the crowded bar area.  The hostess was like many a busy hostess--indifferent and impersonal--who can blame her with such a terrible scheduling system!?\n\nThe decor itself is beautiful and cozy.  The open kitchen fills the main room with flavorful smells and warmth.  Lots of warmth.  If it gets any hotter in there we'll all come with a choice of side dish.\n\nLuckily we were seated in the back room--a sort of enclosed patio.  While it was significantly cooler and quieter, the sparse decor and partition make you feel entirely removed from the restaurant itself.\n\nOur waitress was extremely nice, though a bit befuddled when pressed for wine suggestions.  (The shiraz we ended up with was miserable.)  Though nice, I must mention that we only saw her once after taking our order--when she dropped off the bill.  Nor did she seem to remember, or care, that a member of our party was celebrating her sixtieth birthday: neither a candle nor a cake was to be seen.\n\nFollowing our blah appetizers we were hoping for the best when it came to the main courses--the bucatini, lamb, and a pizza.  \n\nWith the exception of the lamb we were extremely disappointed.  The pizza was bland and the bucatini--which was also bland--was further sullied by the overabundance of breadcrumbs.  Breadcrumbs, breadcrumbs everywhere!  Hansel and Gretel would get a kick out of A16--breadcrumbs appear like insidious guests in way too many appetizers and entrees (even when not listed on the menu).  \n\nAll in all, the experience was a waste of time and money.  We didn't enjoy our food, we didn't enjoy our service, and we didn't enjoy the tab for all this mediocrity.  Surely, this passion for A16 is like a boy band--raging for a minute and gone the next?

My boyfriend and I went there with his cousin and her husband who love the restaurant and have been many times. My boyfriend was especially excited to go, since they feature the type of food from the region of Italy that their family is from, and we will be visiting in the fall for a wedding. The food was amazing, we let our cousins husband take control and order many different dishes, so we all ate family style and were able to try more things than we normally would have. The wines that were ordered were very good, they have a huge wine list mostly of imported Italian wines and a few from California as well. Our waitress was an absolute joy, she was just so sweet and bubbly, very helpful and just a lot of fun. It's obvious that A16 is the place to be, the restaurant was full of people the entire time and I can see why. The only criticism I have was for the front of the house. My boyfriend and I had our table reserved for 6pm knowing that his cousin and her husband would be running a few minutes later than us. When we got there, the hostess told us that we could wait for them at the tiny stool area right at the front by the door across from the bar which was full. We ordered a couple of glasses of wine from the bar, but felt very in the way right there in the front. The 2 girls were standing behind the podium right next to us & talking to each other about all kinds of things, and we finally asked if we could go to our table. One of them replied that they prefer we wait until the rest of our party comes because it throws off the flow of the restaurant. Being in the restaurant business ourselves, we have never heard of such a thing and were kind of shocked! A few minutes later, my boyfriend got one of the girls' attention to give them our credit card (we wanted to make sure that we paid for dinner since we invited them) Well, shortly after that she got our attention and took us to our table even though the rest of our party hadn't arrived. I guess since A16 is the hottest restaurant in town they don't have to have their customer service skills as polished as their recipes. But our server made up for it all, she was great! So needless to say, after the slightly rough beginning, our time at the restaurant was very nice. And we look forward to coming back nest time we visit the Bay Area.", "author": "Helen L."}

Even for an american style pie, this overdose of topping would have been unappetizing... for an Italian-style pizza one, it was a disgrace.

Rudest People EVER!\n\nI used to love this place - the food was great, location convenient, fabulous wine. So, naturally, I wanted to plan a special event here.  You would think that any restaurant would welcome the opportunity for a large party that plans to spend an exorbitant amount of money, right?\n\nSo not the case. First of all, they claim that they have a \"long standing policy\" of not taking reservations for parties larger than 6 on Friday and Saturday nights. Stupid policy for any popular dining place to have. So I decided to talk to the manager to see if any sort of exception could be made (a deposit, minimum order etc, I was willing to be as flexible as possible).\n\nInstead of being put on hold forever by some receptionist, I decided to go in person. I walked in 15 minuted after they opened and was greeted by 5 girls who worked there, all standing around and chatting. There were no customers anywhere in sight. I asked very nicely to speak to the manager. \n\nYou might have thought by their reaction that I asked for a private audience with the Queen of England. They all started exchanging looks with each other, I was asked if I had an appointment, I said no and asked to make one. The snotty receptionists reply was that \"it wasn't really her job.\" I even told them that it was nothing bad, I just wanted to speak to someone in charge! Their reply was that they were about to start serving (to who?? there was no one there!) and he was met possibly busy. I didn't know the manager was needed to start food service...\n\nAfter several more awkward looks being exchanged and thrown at me, I was ushered out of there with the managers name (given with rolled eyes and a reluctant pen so I could write it down) and directions to call an automated phone tree that the management team may or may not check.\n\nEven after all of this, I called and left a message for the manager. \n\nI never got a reply.\n\nI've worked in customer service. This is NEVER how a potential client should be treated. Shame on all of them for thinking that they can brush off a patron to their restaurant. Their food was good, but not good enough to excuse this kind of treatment. \n\nThere are plenty of other amazing places to eat and throw parties in San Francisco.

Our initial plan to grab a snack turned into full on feast. I guess that's what happens when you order wine and sit at the bar. Italian wines are always foreign to me and it was nice to have a bartender that let us taste a lot of the wines. \n\nI browsed the menu and the first thing I noticed was the expansive and creative use of fresh ingredients. Not a new concept to SF, but when you intercept locally seasoned ingredients with rustic italian food, the result is something very beautiful.  First up was the Funghi pizza with smoked mozzarella. The crisp dandelion greens on the pizza  provided a nice complement to the mushrooms. The pumpkin gnocci with keel was one of the highlights of the meal. I enjoyed this pasta because rather then being the typical heavy gnocci dish doused with tomato sauce, it was light, ingredient focused, and completely flavorful. This was the perfect dish at the perfect place in the middle of a cold and rainy November SF night. Next up was the Bucatini with Sicilian almond and dried san marzano pesto, mint and pecorino. I enjoyed this dish the least as I did not feel the ingredients in the sauce were strong enough to support the thick bucatini pasta. The Romana pizza is SO delicious. It's not the best pizza in the city (Pizza Napoletana gets my vote) but the anchovies, chillis, and tomato make a great combination (no anchovies at Pizza Napoletana). This pizza came out pippin hot and it was delicious!\n\nOne great thing about A16 is the quality of the chilli sauce they put on the side for you to add to your pizza or pasta.

The pedestrians, literally, walk all over you. They seem to think that there are no automobiles roaming the streets and just walk freely across the crosswalk--what.the.hell. So annoying.\n\nLuckily, I drove my mini cooper, so finding parking wasn't too much of a problem as I was able to fit into a tiny spot that no regular sized automobile couldn't. Hah, Don't hate! \n\nThe place was jam packed with uber chic people just waiting for their names to be called. Luckily, we made reservations ahead of time and was seated fairly quickly once we arrived. I like that kind of service. Don't you hate it when you do make reservations and you end up waiting still for a good amount of time? Don't you? \n\nWe ordered the pomodoro pizza, beef coulette and a side of grilled polenta. Weird how the pizza was better tasting then the beef coulette and polenta. I found the beef lacking in flavor and the polenta sorta burnt. Although, our appetizers were another story. We ordered the tuna conserva with flatbread. Oh my. I could eat this dish everyday. The tomatoes were so sweet and the dish itself had such a great kick to it. Hubby ordered the beet and pototo salad that was good, but not as good as the tuna appetizer. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the apple puff pastry. It sure didn't taste like what I thought an apple puff pastry would taste like. The apples seemed like they were pureed, hence the mushy texture. The side of lemon sorbet was good. \n\nI'd return to this restaurant, but I wouldn't necessarily crave anything from here. The next time I do return, I definitely want to try out their pasta dishes.", "author": "stacy k."}

The pizza is usually excellent, but I think I chose un-wisely for my taste this time (tomato sauce - I didn't read the sauce part of the menu - with 6 black olives and the same number of anchovies).  The wine was good, but even though I KNOW they're pouring a full 5.5 oz -or whatever - into those big wine glasses of theirs (and I do love those big glasses when served a bottle of wine) I still can't help feeling irked by what appears to be a tenth of a glass of wine.  I understand that this is my failing as a consumer, but I thought I would note it in case anyone wanted to set up a support group (I'm in!).\r\n\r\nService was enthusiastic and friendly.  But, what is good service anyway?  The server was nice enough, knowledgeable and brought us what we ordered.  How is she to know that I was trying to warm up my cranky friend (who was still pissed off about some previous transgression that I still haven't figured out) and that her bouncy introduction and breathless specials reciting didn't quite fit into the moment.  Anyway, no one was hurt so that's pretty good, right?\r\n\r\nNice design and decor.  Kudos for the cork (fully recyclable) flooring.

Not just that, but the waitress waited on us just the right amount and had our leftover food ready for us in a bag when we were ready to leave.\n\nThey're apparently known for their cheeses and wines, but I think they should be known for their meatballs and bread pudding with green apple sorbet.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-04-27", "description": "The boyfriend and I recently had an 8PM reservation.   We arrived a few minutes early and were promptly seated on time. We were seated in the atrium section of the restaurant, and while I did not request this seating, it always has been my preferred location: it's quieter/more intimate and more comfortable temperature-wise, as you avoid the heat of the wood burning ovens. This was my boyfriend's first visit; I, however, have been quite fortunate to have a bit of an insider advantage as a colleague is involved with the restaurant. This, however, was the first time I've gone whereas I've not been there with coworkers - I was curious to see if there would be any glitches sans the colleague.\n\nWe split all of our dishes:\n\n- Mozzarella burrata with olive oil, sea salt and crostini\nFirst time the boyfriend had had burrata. Their traditional, simple presentation makes for as good of an introduction as any.\n\n- Salsiccia - rapini, grana padano, mozzarella, fennel sausage, garlic, chiles\nA16 pizzas are regularly debated - some do not care for the doughier center that is traditional to Neapolitan pizzas. For all of you wishing for a crispier crust, our pizza last night would have been perfect for you: the crust was crisp throughout. I, on the other hand, wished it had been a bit underdone. The boyfriend agreed. Still better than most of what you'll find in the Bay Area.\n\n- Ricotta gnocchi in brodo with pork meatballs, wild nettles and chiles\nDefinitely the best dish of the night. We only split a small and were immediately wishing we'd gotten the larger portion. The gnocchi were that perfect \"pillowly\" light texture. The meatballs were very flavorful and light in their own right. Just the right amount of spice to the dish. One of the best pasta dishes I've had at A16, hands down.\n\n- Berkshire pork loin with pinenuts and (some variety of) berries\nExcellent flavor. The boyfriend thought it was a bit salty, however I thought it was perfectly acceptable (I tend to like saltier foods anyhow). Very simple presentation allowing the pork to shine. I think the pork was just a BIT overdone, though it was still moist and fork tender.\n\n- Roasted potatoes, cauliflower and brussels sprouts (side dish)\nNot an entirely exciting side, but paired suitably with the pork. I did like the textural contrast between the crisp potatoes, the slight crunch to the cauliflower, and the buttery sprouts.\n\n- Chocolate budino tart with sea salt and extra virgin olive oil\nI love chocolate. I love salt. I love EVOO (sorry, all your Rachel Ray haters!). The tart was a bit drier than normal (are we sensing a commonality for the evening?), but was still tasty. I've had this dessert numerous times, and while I think this was probably the weakest I've had, it was still better than probably 75% of the desserts I've had in Bay Area restaurants.\n\n- Honey gelato with figs and buckwheat cookies (there was another component - I think it was a crme anglaise).\nProbably the weakest of the dishes for the evening. The gelato was a bit weakly flavored: it was good, but could have been better with more intensity. The buckwheat cookies by themselves were fairly blah, though they did work better when fully integrated with the gelato, etc. The figs were left behind - didn't feel like they meshed well actually. Or perhaps I just wasn't in a fig mood.\n\nI unfortunately do not remember the specifics of the wine we had. It was a medium bodied red, which was more befitting to my boyfriend's tastes - fruity, but fairly dry. It opened up quite nicely and paired well with all of our dishes (we let is breath a bit through the burrata). I'm more familiar with CA and French wines: my knowledge of Italians is limited to mainly Nebbiolos and Barberas. This was a nice departure from my norm - we relied purely on the advice of the wine staff. Good pick.\n\nI'll also say that I think that A16's service is, for its mid-range categorization, is quite top notch: plates and utensils removed after each course, our pasta dish was held in the kitchen so that it would not get cold when the waitress noticed I had excused myself to the bathroom (my napkin was folded upon my return), courses perfectly timed, etc. Highly efficient and friendly... but it still holds true to its more casual roots and isn't overly fussy.\n\nTotal (including tax and tip) was about $160.\n\nIt's hard to believe that A16 has been around for 3 years already. While I've had certain dishes that have been stronger on previous occasions, the food was of a very high quality. The faults I found were fairly minimal and stem from the fact that I personally have many visits under my belt for contrast. The boyfriend felt it was one of the strongest meals we've shared together. It was great to see that I wasn't just privy to special service because of a work connection. A16 definitely stays on the repeat visit and recommendation list.", "author": "Jesse H."}

But I had heard some good things about A16 and that along with my love of Italian food and I was able to secure a last minute 8:00 reservation was enough to get me to give it a try. \n\nThe evening didn't start off that great as the hostess had a real attitude.  You know the one, \"our shit don't stink and everyone wants two scoops\" kinda attitude.  I really got the feeling that they expected the customer to be happy just with the fact that they were allowed to come in to have dinner.\n\nThe space was nice, bar dining in the front and a blend of modern/rustic dining in the back with an open kitchen the focal point of the dining area.  One problem was it was kinda cramped and noisy and difficult to manuveur in and out of the restaurant, or to and from the bathroom.  You always felt like you were in someone's way.\n\nNow all of this could have been overlooked if the food would have just lived up to expectations.\n\nWe started with a couple of half portion pastas.  We had the gnocchi with pork meatballs, and a fusilli in a chicken stock with mushrooms.  The fusilli was the better of the two dishes.  The fusilli pasta was properly cooked al dente and the flavors were very nice.\n\nThe gnocchi was disappointing.  The gnocchi was meh, and neither the pork meatballs or sauce had a lot of flavor.  It kinda reminded me of a weak version of Italian wedding soup with gnocchi instead of orzo pasta and overall not as much flavor.\n\nNext up was a funghi pizza.  Again, I had high hopes but again this disappointed.  There were way, way too many mushrooms.  A combination of enoki and button mushrooms was so overpowering and resulted in a soggy middle to the crust.  Sometimes less is more and this pizza could have done with less mushrooms.  A real let down.\n\nFinally the halibut with fennel and tomato agrodolce.  This was the best dish of the meal.  The halibut was perfectly cooked and the tomato agrodolce really provided a little sweetness, acidity, and color  to the dish.\n\nFor dessert we had the hazelnut cannoli.  Another bummer, it was not a typical cannoli shell with a ricotta filling.  Instead it was some kind of flakey puff pastry filled with hazelnut cream and there were three of them on a plate.  Another case where they should have followed the rule \"less is more\".  There was no need for three of them and the plating was kind of messy and uninteresting/unappetizing.  I would not order this again at all.\n\nAs a final comment, I will say the wine list is very nice with a good selection of wines by the glass.  Let me just say you will need to down a few glasses of wine to help overlook all the missteps on the menu.\n\nFood:  2.5 stars\nService:  2.5 stars\nAtmosphere:  3 stars\n\nI would really like to give this place 2.5 stars but will begrudgingly round up for the wine list.", "author": "Geoff H."}

Sadly, when we arrived, there was no seating available and the place was jam packed.  We were only there for some wine and to start our evening of debauchery.  \n\nThe wine was FANTASTIC!  Indeed!  After about fifteen minutes, the hostess came up and offered us a table because the reservations didn't show up.  Very thoughtful and she saved my feet, as I was wearing a sweet set of stilettos!  \n\nThe place did have a little bit of noise, but nothing out of control.  The lighting is nice.  Not to dark and definitely not to well lit either.  The bartenders and servers were both very knowledgeable about the wines this place carries.  I've heard fantastic things about their pizza, but didn't get the chance to try it this time around.  But I will definitely be back.  In my opinion, it's a nice place to go with friends to enjoy nice, tasty wine and relax.  But keep in mind, they're behind 3 weeks on reservations someone told us last night!

Granted most of this was before Nate Appleman left, but we definitely had high hopes that they would maintain a similar caliber.\n\nThe evening actually started out really well.  We had the salumi plate and the prosciutto plate.  Delicious.  But I'm not so sure that it was house cured?  Then came the tuna appetizer, which was pretty good but nothing to write home about.  Then we waited about 20 minutes after our appetizer was cleared before our main course came out.  The boyfriend had a funghi pizza, he said it was just decent but he'd definitely had better.  I ordered the roasted chicken.  The chicken was fine, although not spectacular.  The broccolini that came with my chicken, however, was horrible.  It was so salty that I drank 2 glasses of water (mine and his) to make it better.  The waiter then came by and only filled up my water and left the boyfriend's glass completely empty.  Weird.  We were done for over 15 minutes before the waiter finally came back to us to give us our check.  He never checked in on us, never talked to us and only filled our water once.  It was ridiculous.\n\nTo top it off, the place is really crowded...and I heard all about our neighboring table's birthday plans that included dancing with her friends and also the other table's horrible boyfriend problems (did you ask him to stop playing his video game rather than just start yelling at him that you hoped he failed in life?  I dunno, just saying, usually I just tell the boyfriend that we have reservations and he'll stop his game).  Fine, I can sort of handle that if it was just that lone complaint, but on top of that you add horrible and slow service and overly salty food (taste the food, if they had tasted the food, they wouldn't have sent it out!)...it's unacceptable.", "author": "Quynh-An P."}

I stopped in with lunch with a friend last week and the place left me thinking about my meal for the next 2 days. \n\nWe started off with the Romaine Chicory Salad and an order of the House-Cured Fennel Salami.  The salami was off the charts and a great snack to go with a rather simple yet tasty salad.  \n\nThen came the real highlight which was the pasta.  House made and the ragu was simply off the charts.  I can't remember the precise name of the dish and it looks like the menu changed a bit.  I am sure you can't lose with any of the past dishes.\n\nWe also order the Romano pizza.  No cheese on this one which is great for the non-dairy lovers out there.  It was great, tasty but I just can't get all that worked up about pizza.  \n\nOn a side note, I had a lemonade, and it was one of the best lemonades I had in a long time.  I know not many people are going to get a lemonade - but hey its lunch right.  Its cool that even on something like lemonade - A16 makes the effort to do it right - not super sweet like a soda but a bit tart with a bite of lemon.\n\nThe space is nice.  You walk into the bar area with ample bar seating.  The main space is open and inviting.  The smells of the food are intense and welcoming.  We sat outside in a covered patio area which was nice for lunch time. \n\nThe service was excellent but they did seem a bit short staffed at lunch.  Things could have ran a tad more smoothly.  Parking is metered outside and easy during the day and free and should be easy on a weeknight.  On a weekend night, you probably don't want to drive or just pay for parking because the area can get jammed up.  \n\nLove this place, will definitely be back for dinner and to try the wine.", "author": "Moe J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-06-28", "description": "Last summer, I discovered the existance of burrata. It was supposed to be deliciously fresh mozzarella injected with cream, incredibly milky, and fantastic on crostini. I was hooked. Where could I find this delectable concoction? Does anyone in the Bay Area make such creamy heaven? (my forays into Bay Area Italian food have encountered mediocre fare, at best) I discovered a review (I can't find it again) that praised the burrata at A16, imported fresh every Wednesday (or Thursday). Thus, my hopes for A16 were incredibly high. I didn't manage to get here last summer, so I went for a late birthday dinner a few weeks ago. A summary follows.\n\nFinding parking is kind of annoying; there's only street parking as far as I know, and it took us about 15 to 20 minutes to find any sort of parking spot. Thankfully, we'd tried to arrive early, so we got there just on time for our 8pm reservation. The lovely hostesses were happy to bring us straight to our table in the back near the kitchen. A16, like many fine restaurants, is a dim sort of place which provides a nice ambiance for intimate dining. The tables are closely packed, however, so the intimacy is mostly lost by rubbing elbows with your neighbors.\n\nA16 has several sommeliers on hand, and after a reasonable wait for a Wednesday dinner, she came over and helped us pick out some delicious wines. She was spot on with my wine, and we had mostly hits with our group's other glasses. And then we ordered the burrata. With some prosciutto on the side. And maybe olives. But the burrata.\n\n(Z). Oh. My. God. It was just as lovely as I had dreamed. You maybe thinking now, \"Why did this strange person give A16 two stars if she orgasmed over the burrata so much?\" To you, gentle reader, I say \"Yes, quite strange. Keep reading.\" The prosciutto was acceptable but a bit dry, and paled next to the mindblowing awesomeness of the burrata. The olives were quite tasty as well.\n\nUnfortunately, everything else was meh. We ordered pizzas, which were supposed to be fantastic; they were okay. I'll admit I misordered and got prosciutto on a pizza. I adore prosciutto, but the cuts they had were very salty when heated. My bad. The crust was incredibly doughy and for the most part the pizzas, while okay, felt like they could have been had for half the price at a mediocre pizza joint. I'd looked up A16 on Yelp just prior to heading up and ordered the chocolate budini tart drizzled with olive oil on the advice of one of my fellow reviewers. It was, alas, not for me. The saltiness overwhelmed the chocolate, and the olive oil just tasted out of place.\n\nTo recap: the service was good taking into account the size of the crowd, the food felt overly expensive for the quality, and honestly it's just too tight to really relax inside the restaurant. Next time I will go back just for the burrata and a glass of wine, and save my stomach for dinner elsewhere.", "author": "Sarah B."}

I admit that I've probably read oh, about 200 reviews raving about the burrata, pizzas, charcuterie, and pastas, but I was still worried that it might be over-rated. I'm seldom on that side of town, but decided to make the trek and was well rewarded for doing so.\n\nHolidays=gluttony in America, yes? I've been on a hiatus from dining adventures as of late due to busy work and a cold, but now I'm back. To really appreciate my return to nice meals, we started with the cloud-like burrata and the prosciutto tasting. After tasting the 14 month and the 20 month prosciutto, the verdict is that we liked both and couldn't discern between the two. It takes a mighty cheese to steal my attentions away from the most velvety marbled salt-cured ham, but the burrata succeeded. We both paused to admire its simplicity, elastomer and creamy pillowiness, and to ponder how a pedestrian \"Precious\" brand mozzarella ball at Safeway could even be distantly related to a cheese so indulgent.\n\nThe wine list is quite lengthy and full of mysterious Italian varietals that I know nothing of. Our menu selections were all over the place, but the sommelier was able to point us in the direction of a Casavecchia when we told her we were looking for something \"interesting\" and easy drinking. \n\nAt this point we were relaxed and in good spirits. I was afraid that we had ordered too much food, so we opted for the small serving of bucatini with Dungeness crab, cherry tomatoes, basil, gigante beans, and some lovely toasty bread crumbs. The beans were strangely absent but completely unnecessary. The pasta was one of our favorites for the evening, simple but incredibly delicious with plentiful chunks of sweet crab. Even though the small portion allowed us to order dessert later, we both wished we had ordered the large. \n\nI was a little let down by our entree selection, but I think it was just a case of mis-ordering. The manfriend was happy with the coils of house-made lamb sausage, but I wasn't so taken by the accompanying giardiniera. I love all things pickled, but the mixture tasted a bit off to me. The lamb sausages themselves were tasty, but overall the plating was careless and I felt like the dish was lacking something. \n\nIn a rare showing of self-restraint, we had asked for the remainder of the prosciutto to be boxed up. I foresaw a cheese plate in my future, but the manfriend could not resist the panna cotta with pomegranate seeds and almonds, two of his favorite things. I'm not one for jiggly, creamy, or custardy finales, so I went with the naughty and wildly rich chocolate budino tart, deliciously topped with sea salt and olive oil for an ultimate sweet savory combination. This little pudding tart can best be described as adult, yum.\n\nService was attractive and polished, very easy to deal with and not at all in our faces. Sommelier was friendly and informative, but didn't make it over until our appetizers were arriving which was a little awkward. The room itself is more pleasant with warmer lighting than the low-ceilinged bar seating. I duly noted the toasty wood burning oven and the cute covered patio.

So far, my guesses are:\n\n* Italian Scrabble tile, where A is worth 16 points.  (Sounds like the game I could win, although I don't speak Italian).\n* Italian highway number.  (Take the A16 down to Palermo, then take Exit 6).\n* Something heard while playing Battleship in Italy.  (A16?

When you walk in, the restaurant looks very small and kind of narrow, but it's really not.  My friend who had been to A16 a few times before requested a table on the patio, which is all the way in the back.  We walked past some bar tables, the actual bar, an open kitchen, a LOUD dining area and finally arrived at the patio.  It's a small, quiet covered area with 4 tables.  The serenity of the patio was worth the 4-minute walk.  (It wasn't really THAT long of a walk, but you know me, I like to exaggerate and complain).\n\nOur waitress was upbeat and efficient, although she kind of disappeared for a while and forgot to refill my iced tea.  They brought us bread before the meal, but for some reason did not bring us the bread plates.  I guess it's their M.O. in Italy, because no one had them.  The tablecloth, the butcher paper and the menu were beige in color, which contributed to a nice, relaxed atmosphere.\n\nI had the arugula salad with nectarines, ricotta and walnuts as an appetizer.  The salad was very good--nectarines and arugula are a great combination--although the dressing was a bit too lemony for my taste.  For my entree I ordered the cavatelli pasta with squash blossoms.  Cavatelli are small pasta shells that are more dense and chewy than other pasta.  I'd say it was like undercooked al dente pasta.  Nonetheless, it was delicious and very filling.  The squash blossoms gave the dish a unique taste, and the chiles added the much needed spice.  I also tried a slice of my friend's Margherita pizza.  I loved the thin crust, although pizza without meat is like a crystal chandelier without light bulbs: it's beautiful to look at, but what's the point?\n\nOverall, I felt very European dining here.  When we walked out, I wanted to hop on my Vespa and ride it to my palazzo, but I remembered that I lived in America, and my 6-cylinder sedan was parked 6 blocks away.  Back to reality!\n\nP.S.

I'm thinking, \"great, another stuff, pretentious, loud Marina joint\".  This was compounded by the fact that our table wasn't ready until almost 30 minutes past our reservations time.  Still, I give it the benefit of the doubt.  To my surprise, the place is quite extensive in the back.  It has a nice and modern look to it.  In the back, we sat in the patio, which was tranquil and provided a nice respite from the Marina meat market of the bar.\n\nWe ordered a plethora of dishes amongst the 4 of us:\n\nAppetizers:\n\nBurrata crostini - Yum, yum, yum.  This is the tastiest, most interesting textured mozzarella I've ever had.  Couple that with the olive oil and I couldn't get enough.\nProsciutto sampler - Loved it, from the mild, to the very strong (bacon like taste).  I'm not usually a huge prosciutto fan, but they definitely know how to cure the meat properly here\nBeat salad - With the combination of flavors and the almonds, it was absolutely delicious.  \n\nFor the main course, I tried the pizza salsiccia.  It came to my table and was enormous.  From the way it was wood fired, to the delicious ricotta, to the fennel sausage, every bite was sensational.  I had to bring some home and I'll be happily having the rest for my lunch today.\n\nI hadn't been overly impressed with the other Italian places I've tried in the Marina before (E'angelo, Emporio Rulli - although they do have great desserts), but I think I now found a gem.

Negative points on that. \n\nSince we didn't have that final pasta dish, we decided to try some desserts. The special fig and walnut gelato was too tart and sweet - and the olive oil chocolate torte was heavy too. \n\nMy overall impression is that the chef must be a smoker and thus over salts and over seasons to compensate for burnt taste buds. Italian food is incredibly delicious and simple on it's own, when you use good ingredients. There's no reason to complicate it with too many ingredients or too much salt.

Nice and thin, with just the right amount of cheese (not piled on like most restaurants around here) and very little grease.

My friends and I sat in the narrow hallway part of it, and it gets slightly bothersome to be in such a high traffic area.

They should make that a dessert all on it's own.\n\nFor the wine, the sommelier did a great job of steering us towards something that complemented both of our mains really well, was very flavorful on it's own, was something completely different from anything I've had before, or would have even considered (the strongest aroma in the bouquet was rose petals!?), and was shockingly affordable (I think it was around $40).  The bottle was taken home so that it can be hunted down for future consumption :-)\n\nI wish I could give 5 stars, but the Gnocchi didn't quite cut it.\n\nWhen you go, definitely ask for the sommelier's recommendation -- if for no other reason to try something really good, and completely different!", "author": "Maneesh B."}

On arriving at the restaurant, we discovered it was a Prosecco and ordered it. The kid was\nright, so points to him!\n\nWith great difficulty because everything on the menu is totally intriguing\nand you want to try it all, we ordered:\n--Monterey sardine bruschetta with minted peas and pickled onions\n--Trippa napoletana with onions, tomato, white wine and breadcrumbs\nfor our appetizers. It was G&J's first time eating tripe, and only my\nsecond, and while its texture takes a bit of getting used to, it was\nperfectly cooked, soft, and pleasant, and the sauce was just to die for. We had to order a basket of bread because that sauce needed sopping up, every drop of it. Thesardines on toast, which we probably should have eaten first, were very delicate flavors, and the fish was quite fishy-briny tasting. The mint was very restrained so that the flavors of the peas and the pickled onions could complement the sardine. And even the durned toast was just perfectly cooked. I can never talk highly enough of the simple perfection of the cooking in this place.\n\nNext, we had the Capricciosa pizza (aka, let the pizza chef have his way with us and put whatever he liked on it). It came with smoked cheese, bitter greens, tiny pieces of pancetta, and was stupendous. They get their crust so thin and perfect, and with marvelous flavor to\nit.\n\nWe ordered just one entree with two side dishes, hoping to save room for dessert. I got to choose and went for the black cod with a crust of olives, capers and a sauce of chilis, tomato and herbs. I adore black cod and this was prime (and of course, perfectly cooked, I just can't say that enough!). There was no need to even CHEWit; the fish just melted in the mouth. Our sides were cannellini beans with garlic and oregano, and roasted polenta squares (which were great with the sauce from the fish). Even the humble, simple beans at this place are a joyous pleasure in the mouth.\n\nWe ordered two desserts:\n--Almond cake with roasted nectarines, florentine syrup, and sage semifreddo\n--Cheese plate with mild bleu cheese, walnut toast, dark thin slices of date nut bread, and Marshall Farms honey\nI think I'm going to dream about the sage semifreddo for weeks, and the\nhoney on that cheese plate was insanely good.\n\nWe were in pleasurable, over-filled pain for the rest of the night.", "author": "TL V."}

My boyfriend had the roasted corn which in a food magazine would have been perfect for the summer bbq spread, however, to eat - ridiculous.  Lets talk more on the corn.  Roasted corn sliced into 1/2 inch coins served in a small bowl.  To eat you must either a. try to cut the corn off the cob on your plate to render only 1/4 of a teaspoon of kernels or b. pick them up and eat them as mini corn cobs, making you look like you are at a mini-tea party for your 3 year old neice.\n\nSaving grace was the wine.

What you won't love is that they take poor SF service to new heights (or lows depending on how you look at it). \n\nThe hostesses are incredibly unfriendly. Perhaps it's due to the never-ending throng of people trying to get a table or maybe they're simply food elitists. \n\nTypically if you don't make reservations two weeks in advance you'll have to grab a drink at the bar for 30 minutes to 4 hours, depending on the night. The bartenders are knowledgeable but also don't understand customer service. When you want a drink, they avert their eyes and continue doing whatever it is they are doing, instead of giving you that reassuring nod that says \"I see you and I'll be right over.\" This can be somewhat embarrassing if on a date to a nice restaurant. \n\nThe upside is they have great wine. Much better wines overall and by the glass for price...especially when compared with the California Wine Merchant just down Chestnut. If only they could swap the customer service at California Wine Merchant for the staff behind the bar at A16... \n\nThe wait staff takes forever to bring you food, remove dirty plates, ask if you want another glass of wine, and bring more bread...all things that you expect from a fine restaurant. \n\nHowever, if you can avoid getting an ulcer from the annoying service that abounds at every turn, you'll fall in love with the amazing food. I recommend a seat at the chef's table, a marble counter in back that goes along the open kitchen, providing a meal's worth of insight into food preparation that might only be rivaled by taking a culinary class. \n\nConversely, if in Boulder, CO, I'd recommend you try Frasca Food and Wine, a much better and friendlier version of A16, which specializes on the northern region of Friuli. This restaurant might be what A16 used to be when it began. The meals are equally priced, but the food is about 50% better and the service about 90% better. \n\nSo, in summary, great food but really horrible service. ...But this is San Francisco and no one has quite figured out how to do food in this city that encompasses great service, food, and price. Maybe that's a good thing because that just means there's room for more gastronomic entrepreneurship.", "author": "Jake V."}

We luckily got a couple of seats at the wine bar within minutes and a very helpful and knowledgeable wine waiter helped us pick out wine.  We were enjoying sitting there but just as our bottle arrived we were told our table was ready.  \n\nOur table was right at the back in an outdoor section behind a window which would have been bad since it was cold but fortunately there was a heater very close to us so it was okay but we did feel a bit left out of from the ambiance of the place.  Given the noise level in the restaurant that might have been an advantage though.  Our waitress was also helpful including pointing out that the salumi dish my partner had ordered was actually head cheese.  A substitution was suggested and gratefully ordered.  The food came out pretty quickly - no complaints there.\n\nMy husband stopper bean zuppa was actually very good - probably the highlight of the evening gastronomically.  But afterwards it was downhill.  The pork salumi my partner got was very fatty and reminded her of spam and so we put some bean soup on it to liven it up.  \n\nMy main was lamb with radishes and another bean based side dish - both were big disappointments.  The lamb was over cooked and dry - maybe it is the authentic Italian style for lamb and I'm just too used to medium-rare lamb in this country, but these well-done casserole sized nuggets of lamb just didn't do it for me, and the radish accompaniment added nothing to the dish.   I took two bites of the bean side and it was bland and very bready - my partner thought the same.  After the great bean soup we were both let down.  Some cheese or spices would have really helped.  For over $20 of food my main was a big disappointment.\n\nMy partner's main was the sausage pizza and it came with a pot of chili oil but there was already a substantial amount of that on the pizza.  In my mind too much and I like spicy and hot food.  If the chili oil is delivered on the side then I think the cook should really go sparingly or just leave it off altogether.  The crust was thicker, softer and doughier than I expected, altogether not much to write home about, maybe we just chose one of their less interesting pizzas and got a heavy handed serving of chili oil.\n\nFor dessert I had a fruit dish in a little pastry case that was unmemorable except for the honey ice cream which was tasty and very sweet.\n\nOverall it felt like A16 had many elements to be a great place - perhaps it has been a victim of its own popularity that has lead to less that great food.  Or maybe a late seating on a Friday night is the wrong time to be eating there.  I can imagine that if you can walk in, sit at the bar, enjoy a nice wine and a pizza then you'll love the place.  If you looking for more gastronomically it was hard to imagine from our experience that you'll get it.  Clearly with all the other fantastic reviews we felt let down but it is unlikely that we'd ever trek across the Bay and across town to give it a second chance.", "author": "Simon W."}

Maybe I caught them on a good night but I have to admit, this was one of the best meals I have had in the city, and I have been to a few places.\n\nWe sat down at 9:15 after catching a movie across the street. Sunday night, no wait for two. I like that. Perhaps an hour earlier or on a different night it might (def?) have been different, but to sit immediately was such a relief. \n\nThe server was a young girl who was very nice and quite helpful about answering questions. I like to poll the audience and find out what the server likes, dislikes, recommends and she was very forthcoming. \n\nThe wine we picked was a Barbera blend that was very good, kinda chilled. Not sure of the name unfortunately.\n\nWe started with two apps, the escarole salad (new on the menu that night) with green apples and I believe pecorino cheese/fried almond bits, and it was very good. I thought it might be kinda plain, but the mixture of the apples and cheese was perfect, great compliments of each other. I also forgot how much I love escarole, it has a unique texture which reminds me of bok choy (am i crazy?). \n\nWe also got the octopus zuppa, which was AMAZING, and also new on the menu. Chickpeas, sliced tentacles and wilted escarole in a deliciously spicy broth. Really, this was kind of mind blowing. I wanted to stop eating it but it was difficult. It was almost as if they new what kind of things I like b/c the spiciness was just what the doctor ordered, like they read my mind.\n\nNext we shared a pizza, the Bianca. I love white pizzas and this did not even come close to disappointing. I remember I turned to my gf and said, \"better than Delfina\" and even today, I think I meant it. We got pancetta added and it was well received. Again reading my mind, they brought out this chili oil which you apply to the pizzas and it was so good. I thought there was only a select few of us who really like to spicy-up their pizzas, and so seeing that oil was very nice. \n\nWe skipped the dessert. Too stuffed, so nothing to report there.

Pizza was just OK, and the burrata (as other people have pointed out) was incredible, but we had a terrible waitress--just really terrible.  I don't typically berate wait staff, but please humor me and my crazy-lady rant.\n\nThe woman watched us 4 girls order two appetizers, two GIANT pizzas, and two pastas, reminding us the pastas could be ordered large.  If you follow my math, this adds up to WAY TOO MUCH FOOD.  When my friends and I realized our eyes were infinitely larger than our stomachs, we asked the waitress to cancel the pastas, and she made no effort to pretend she wasn't incredibly annoyed.\n\nAny competent waitress should know her menu well enough to see when too much is too much, and any waitress who knowingly lets her customers over-order, and isn't gracious about customers changing their minds, is just a BAD waitress.  \n\nLame.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-10-09", "description": "I was really excited to go to A16 as I had read so many great reviews.  My wife and I were quite disappointed with our experience.\n\nWe sat in the back of the restaurant; it looks like it was once an outdoor space that is now covered.  There was a floor drain and my chair was sliding down toward it, so we moved tables.  The overhead outdoor lights had a problem as they continually got dimmer and then brighter again.  It was surprisingly annoying and brought on a slight touch of nausea.\n\nWe ordered our food and selected only a main course and wine since we had lunch at Boulevard in downtown SF and weren't really that hungry.  Our lamb dishes were brought out before the bread and olive oil, which we had to ask for.  The lamb was very good, well prepared and tasty.  The accompanying side salad was fresh, but chopped up Romaine lettuce with a vinaigrette dressing was much too unimaginative and too large (quite disappointing).\n\nDuring dinner, a three top was seated at our 1st sloping table.  They seemed to have quite the time with the musical chairs as they too had difficulty getting comfortable on the decline (it was a small table for 2, let alone 3).  They ordered wine and the sommelier spend a solid 5 minutes trying to open a bottle of red, all the while having her rear end uncomfortably close to my wife's head.  Quite unprofessional on the sommeliers part (no spatial awareness even though the table next to her was empty).\n\nEveryone seemed to be in a hurry especially the waitress and the food runner.\n\nThen the waitress dropped of the dessert menus, literally.  Sort of tossing them to us.  She was in a hurry to attend to her other duties/guests.  We declined.  The check finally came, we paid and on the way out we addressed our concerns to the floor manager.  \n\nShe was quite apologetic and seemed to have an excuse for everything that happened, although, she did ask us to give A16 another try.  She even said that the sloping table, the one in the very back right by the door was the favorite of some of A16's guests.  Hard to imagine.  And no thanks, there are so many great restaurants in SF there is no need to settle for second rate one especially if the best they can do is \"Sorry, but give us another try\".  Maybe their staff should eat at Boulevard and see how it's done.  Only 10% of dissatisfied customers say something, the rest just don't come back.\n\nWe were quite disappointed especially after all the great reviews.

Surprisingly, it was civil, not too crazy, and even though we didn't have reservations, we lucked into a table.(probably because we ate so early and needed to get home)\n\nAnyway, loved the wines from Campagina, especially the Falenghina and the Aglianico.  Burrato was good, the salumi good (love fennel) and tripes!  Where do you see tripes that often, and we ordered a second to have with the pizza margherita.  Yum, but it did get busy with the beautiful marina crowd fast, and it got loud.  Next time I will go with my mominlaw for a late lunch", "author": "Caitlyn L."}

I've been on a losing streak lately in SF, so maybe we can blame the stars or something.  \nAwkward crowding around the host desk upon arrival, though... It's more of a design flaw.  Seated relatively promptly, though a good 10 minutes after our 8:30 reservation.  The long, narrow restaurant opens gracefully into a quaint dining room with exposed kitchen and a little almost \"outdoor\" nook.. Presumably for private dining etc...\nAmbiance aside, the food really lacked.  The squash bruschetta was delicious, however the crostini it was spread upon was dry and clashed with the silky and sumptuous topping.\nThe house made salumi was nice overall, though heavy on the salt and not fully cured.  It was paired with extremely astringent pickled vegetables that acted against the more delicate flavors of the charcuterie.  \nMy companion and I shared the Maccaronara and the steak.  Both were mediocre at best.  The pasta was undercooked to a point that it was sticking to our teeth.  All the flavors were there, though it wasn't enjoyable to eat.  The steak was a mess.  Our waitress never asked the preferred temperature and I realized it too late.  It came literally every temperature.  Each piece was either way over cooked or under.. Except for one perfectly cooked sliver that unfortunately couldn't make up for the dish.  Accompanying the dish were fingerling potatoes and a bit of arugula.. Severely in need of a binding sauce to bring it all together.  I chose the polenta as my side and it was also over cooked, in fact burnt... Only the very center hinted at what it should have tasted like.\nOur wine was delicious however and our server was very knowledgable and chose an outstanding pairing. \nWe were set on trying to enjoy our meal to it's fullest, so we opted for the chocolate mousse tart.  Again, the tart was so over cooked it was almost chalky.  Each bite disintegrated into a weird mush that just didn't mesh with the rich quenelle of mousse. I've never not finished a desert, but this was the first.\nA 16 is a beautiful restaurant with a very talented team of food minded individuals, that much is clear.

Still dreaming about some of the food though!\nOur reservations were for 8:30; we were actually seated almost right away. They had two options for us: chef counter or a table, and of course we chose to sit at the counter.\nClassic app: went for the burrata. You just can't go wrong with fresh cream-filled cheese! I also asked if you could get just one of the prosciuttos from the tasting since I am a huge fan of La Quercia (made in the USA!), and they surprisingly obliged. I did want a few more crostini, but knew I had to leave room for the delights to come.\nWe ordered an interesting white blend from Italy that went well with the salty meat and also the pastas that followed.\nNext up: pastas. We shared the small portions of the squid ink tonnarelli and the gnocchi. The tonnarelli was black as night and twirled with spicy Calabrian chilies and tender little clams. My friend had never had squid-ink pasta before and delcared it delicious! I actually liked the gnocchi prep better - it was pillowy little gnocchi that were lightly sauced with braised guinea hen and pea tendrils, with an interesting cheese called pecorino canestrato on top.\nWe ordered an Italian red (their last bottle) to go with our entree; one of the best red wines I have ever tried, and my friend was in love with it as well. I wish I had taken a picture of the label or written it down but I was in a gnocchi-induced stupor. So we shared the lamb sausage entree with spinach and pickled currants. It was a perfect little coil of spiced lamb sausage, and the accompaniment was good too - we ordered the roasted sunchokes which had a great roasty flavor plus a little heat from the chilies. What's funny is that since we were at the chef counter, I was watching all these coils of sausage going in the oven and they looked so good - I didn't realize there was *another* sausage dish on the menu that was combined with porchetta!!! Super sad I missed out on that one, will just have to return to try it.\nJust when we thought there was no more room, we went ahead and ordered the chocolate budino for dessert. Amazing! The soft creamy chocolate is slicked with extra-virgin olive oil and a few flecks of sea salt. It was hard to leave some on the plate but we had to! We also had an amazing dessert wine with this called Moscato di Noto that I will be on the look-out for. \nWe ended up chatting with our servers and Chef Nigel for a while and pretty much closed the place down. All in all, a really great experience - thanks team A16! I was just glad that my friend was paying because with 2 bottles of wine and all those shared plates, the bill got pretty steep.\n\nI really want to come back to try the trippa napoletana, but I'm still a little scared of it - maybe another bottle of wine would have given me some liquid courage!", "author": "Stephanie S."}

My buddy and I came here because I told him I wanted incredible Italian- and that's what I got!  We started with the Mozzarella burrata- a wonderful soft cheese with the perfect amount of flavor.  We also had the Tuna Conserva Panzanella, a tuna/artichoke/bread salad.  Absolutely incredible.  My friend ordered the meatballs (the special) and gobbled them up in about five minutes.  I had the Chicken.  \n\nI don't normally order chicken from restaurants because my mother makes an incredible chicken, and no restaurant can compare.  While this chicken was not better than mom's, it was incredibly juicy which a nice amount of spices on the skin.  The side dish I ordered was Roasted carrots and turnips with green garlic, mint and chiles- the waitress recommended it, and was right on.  I would have bet money I hated turnips, but this totally changed my mind.  These were perfect.  \n\nAnd then the dessert- one of the greatest desserts I have ever had, The Chocolate tart with sea salt and olive oil.

The mozzeralla was fabulous.  Our server selected a wonderful well priced bottle of red for us.  But...  well, if it wasn't for these factors I probably would have given A16 only 2 stars.\n\nFirst of all, our reservation for 2 was at 9:30 and we were not seated until 10 pm.  Come on.  How hard is it to squeeze two people in on time.  And the hostess was completely indifferent.  We had to keep bugging her about our table.  Basically, we were ignored.  When we got seated it was not a great table.  It was squeezed in behind a huge party.  Our server was pleasant but rushed.  He neither detracted nor added to the experience.  All this I might have overlooked if it was truly the best pizza I had ever had.  It was not.  Sorry.  Pasty Grimaldi's (located in NY and Scottdale) is better.  If I had never had Grimaldi's, I might have though this was the best pizza ever.  A16 doesn't even come close.  Soooo...  my ultimate analysis?  I would come here midweek for pizza if I could walk right in and get a table.  But it is not worth a special trip or a long wait.", "author": "sarah k."}

At that point being led to the back dining room from the front bar area somehow felt like they were stashing us away where we wouldn't bother anyone.

Our waitress was very nice and took great care of us, she really anticipated our needs. Unfortunately the people sitting next to us were so incredibly loud it almost ruined the experience completely. Seriously lady, you can quiet down instead of trying to impress us with tales of getting your garden landscaped! We were thisclose to asking for a new table they were so loud, and no, it wasn't loud in the dining room yet. \n\nWe enjoyed the bresaola and arugula on crostini as well as our Carciofi (artichoke) Pizza. On a slight step down was the Cavatelli with fava beans, guanciale, pecorino and black pepper. It was good but it was drenched in butter and reminded the hubs of Pasta Roni... we had been hoping it would be more like a carbonara.

The fava beans were tender and flavorful, and the tripe was awesome-- perfectly cooked and drenched in a very rich sauce.\n\nNext we had a pizza course with the Margherita and the Salsiccia.  I only tried the Margherita.  It was good but perhaps not remarkable.  \n\nFor entrees I tried the roasted young chicken with radishes & salsa verde.  The chicken was very nicely done, with crispy and well-spiced skin, and moist, juicy flesh.  The radishes were tasty, but a bit heavy on the salt.  I also tried the halibut cheeks with almonds, parsley, and lemon.  They were very good, properly cooked, but a bit stringy in texture (which I don't remember from other times I've had halibut cheeks).  \n\nDesserts were shared across the table.  We ordered a trio of the house made sorbets, the chocolate budino tart with sea salt and olive oil, and the strawberry zuppa inglese.  All were good.

Ask politely.   \n\n\nSome little blonde creature with a Generations old Valley Girl Accent, the kind who says \"amaaazing\" when she means \"good\" takes my call. \"We don't offer pizza to go\". She says this with some coldness incompatable with the pizzeria culture. Strike Uno.\n\nThis is the first time in recorded human history that a place that makes pizza would not put it in a box. Not this pizzeria. It's special. Strike Due.\n\nThen we get into the whole inside pizza gossip world with its own official mumbo jumbo, as discussed by some guy who types in a dark room with four computer screens live [\"A16 is certified and uses OO flour - Park Chow tries to cut costs by not using OO and is flavorless. In fact, although the owner wanted to use OO flour his exec chef chose to ignore this request and utilize non OO flour]. \n\nPal, I don't care if they use flour that came over on the Mayflower and is the size of birdshot if  tastes good. I don't care about celebrity chefs or the inner workings of the Wizard of Oz oven. Strike Due and one-half.\n\nIts just warm bread with cheese and sauce, and maybe a few pounds of processed meats. Its not a religious icon given to man to enjoy in a state of religious rhapsody. Pizza - remember? \n\nSo I go to this shrine of everything crappy that San Francisco has become , and i finally order the super pie. With the certification. With the 00 flour, whatever that means. Verdict: it stunk. The dough was both burned and soggy, the rest of this pie nothing to write home about.\n\nWhy is it that some fat guy in Brooklyn who never heard of 00 flour or certification, and is only too happy to put his pie in the box makes real pie, while this object of gourmet veneration has nothing? \n\nI realize that all the recent transplants to the Bay Area got their Merit Badges in  Restaurant Reviewing,  and that you are supposed to like this place because every insufferable moron does, but seriously - it's hard to park, expensive, the servers are all vying to be on Reality TV, and if they served you the same pizza at Domino's you'd start going to Papa Johns.", "author": "john d."}

The place was packed (no surprise) with a nice mix of the beautiful people and families. Started with Burrata as a starter, Salsiccia Pizza, and a Fregula pasta with a side of Chard. All the dishes were very good. Preparation and presentation were steller. The service was spot on which is a plus considering the crowds. The pizza was my favorite. The corkage is high at $30. A16 has an extensive wine list and wants to drive you to their wines. I look forward to a return visit on my next visit to the Marina. Lot's of fun, and a hot spot!", "author": "Gerry C."}

Created an account and here we go.  \n\nThe ambiance was great, we showed up at 7 on a friday and enjoyed a glass of wine while we waited for the table.  Hostess was friendly and exactly what a hostess should be.  The server (short almost buzzed head) was awesome, attentive and managed to sneak in and fill the wine glasses without interrupting.  Our wine was nice and not that out there price wise.......so from this point you can see that we were getting excited and hoping the hype was going to stand up the restaurant....sadly, it definitely was  a huge letdown.\n\nMy date ordered the roasted chicken with a side of polenta, while i ordered the gnocchi.  My dates chicken was good but honestly very reminiscent of a Safeway precooked chicken.  My gnocchi, which by the way i ordered the large dish, came out with im guessing maybe 10 peices, it was green and surrounded by the mushrooms.  One bite and it was all downhill.  Tasted like green play-doe with an earthworm surround and the sauce was EXTREMELY bland.  \n\nI sat their wondering how I had heard about this restaurant, and why it was packed.....my only guess is that we ordered entrees rather than pizza (i know right, what jackasses we ordered the more expensive items) and that the pizza must be where its at.  \n\nI will be back at some point in the future to give this place another try.....but I will definitly only be ordereing off the pizza menu and wine list only.

While tables are limited and the crowd keeps flowing in, I'm happy to wait my turn and savor the goodness. \n\nLast time I went was Meatball Monday. If you haven't been, you should. Definitely book in advance if you want a prime time (7-9) or come in earlier for a more lax atmosphere and no-wait line. Regardless of the time, my server has always been knowledgeable, friendly and prompt. \n\nI love the fresh ingredients, creative pairings and seasoning. I'd recommend their mozzarella or ricotta (they receive from a place in southern california that is to-die-for and if you want to purchase elsewhere, I'd go to Bristol Farms downtown). The asparagus pizza with prosciutto was lush and my favorite, brioche toast topped with pancetta, pea-puree and egg (with a hint of chile oil). \n\nIf you haven't been, go.

When we were at the hour mark and I asked the hostess how much longer to see if we should go on another walk around the neighborhood she snapped at me and told me the 30 minutes was just an estimate and wouldn't give an estimate as to how much longer. Don't know who peed in her wheaties that morning. Once seated the waitress didn't even give us 2 minutes before expecting to take our order and she was also short with us. Mostly Italian wines which we did not recognize any on the menu so asked for suggestions to which the waitress replied she knew nothing about wine. Could you get someone then? Oh well we ordered a standard CA wine since no one could help. We were there for a friends birthday and told the waitress that but instead of saying \"Happy Birthday\" she asked her if she was of age to have wine, my friend told her her age and the waitress left to get the wine we ordered. Upon her return with the wine she then decided to ID my friend, which was fine but odd that it was after the fact and with the attitude we had already recieved. We ordered a salad and 2 pizzas. The salad was very good and the only reason this place gets 3 stars. The pizza was just ok.

Then came the pasta course....the quattro formaggi ravioli was delicious and the gnocchi just perfect. Then came a very simple pizza, just sauce and olives, but it was made right in front of us by the amazing pizza chef and just perfect. Next...a pork chop from god with some kind of amazing apple sauce and a white bean side (the only thing that was not so hot). And finally just when I though I was going to explode came desert. The chocolate tart with sea salt and evoo would definitely be on the menu for my final meal.

The spaghetti was tasty and perfectly al dente. Also I absolutely hate any poultry related meat substitutes such as turkey/chicken meatloaf, but their chicken meatballs were awesome. \n\nMy only disappointment was with the pumpkin and ricotta gnocchi with kale.

The wine was not what I expected...I'm no wine connoisseur, but I know what I like and don't like, which I've told the server before getting her recommendation.  My ex ordered a soup and a calamari appetizer while I ordered the lamb chops with some vegetable dish along with the wine I didn't care for.  The soup deserves a -1 star, the lamb chops were full of fat...the whatever meat there actually was (1/2 a star since it at least had a little meat? Heck, I'll even be nice and give it an extra star because the seasoning wasn't bad), I had shared with my ex since I felt bad that he didn't even touch his soup.  The vegetables were blah (1 star), and the calamari appetizer gets a solid 3 stars!\n\nAll in all, I think the food gets 1.5-2 stars, and the service gets 4 stars.  I'll never go there again.

And fresh mozzarella.  (It's not one food, but I digress).\n\nMy palate is Italian through and through.\n\nSo when Food&Wine first ran an article on Shelley Lindgren's new spot at A16, I made note and put in on my mental Go-To list.  I've traveled to SF twice in the last few months, and both times, hit this hotspot.  \n\nThe first time was for my wedding anniversary.  We made a reservation, and showed up in our best duds.  (I was giddy when not one, not two, but three people mistook me for the maitre d'.  Yeah, I'm a dork, so what!)  It was a Friday night, and we had to wait, I don't know, maybe twenty minutes.  So I read the cookbook, and made sure diners were happy.  \n\nWe were squeezed into the banquette in the bustling dining room, next to a loudmouth former frat boy and his poor date, but things turned magical when the food arrived.  Grilled fava beans with garlic and crushed red pepper, an assortment of salumi that melted in the mouth, and we shared a wood-fired oven pizza with sausage and mushrooms.  It was six months ago, and I still remember it, that's how good it was.\n\nNext stop was just last week, on a Monday, after a full day of site seeing.  We were sweaty and dirty, and wearing our best \"We Are Tourists\" outfits.  No, they weren't matching.  \n\nWe couldn't get in through Open Table on this trip, and when we passed by the restaurant we crossed our fingers and decided to take a look-see.  And what do you know, they were starting to get busy, but they had a place for us.  This time, we sat at the bar, watched the kitchen and asked questions, all of which the garde mange chef seemed more than happy to answer.  \n\nOur server, who sported a \"Doin it\" tattoo on her wrist because as she said, she was doin it, livin the life, suggested a Campanian wine to go with our pastas, Bucatini with Monterey Sardines and Squid Ink Tonnarelli with Shrimp.  We were supposed to share, but... it's not like it was a special occasion, though that didn't stop us from scarfing down the Chocolate Budino Tart with sea salt and olive oil.

For a place smack in the heart of the Marina that's filled with striped-shirt wearers, it's remarkably without pretension and attitude, the service is efficient and the staff is personable and witty. The challenge is getting seated...\r\n\r\nTonight was our second trip to A16, and the food just gets better. We started with perfect meatballs - light and almost fluffy made with pork, proscuitto and ricotta cheese which was quickly followed by the mozzarella burata (handmade partially formed mozzarella) with crostini and a fried cheese dish - amazingly crispy and chewy with a radiccio and arugula salad on top.\r\n\r\nWe all had pizza next - and my rapini (broccoli rabe) pizza with pancetta and chili oil was amazing. I've always been a fan of broccoli rabe, and the preparation was spot-on: garlicy and spicy with a little fat and salt lent to it by the melt-in-your-mouth pancetta. The crust was perfectly charred and had a fresh dough flavor.\r\n\r\nThe point doesn't come off for the food, which is a clear five stars. A half point is lost due to the physical layout of the entrance/bar area - it's way too crowded, making it almost impossible to physically get up to the bar to actually order a drink. Because the restaurant is so popular (read: prone to crowds) and they offer food service at the bar, the turnover up front is very slow making it an uncomfortable place to park yourself while waiting for your table. Still, once you make it to the restaurant area, it's quite relaxed, with enough space around each table so that you don't feel like you're listening in on your neighbor's conversation.\r\n\r\nThe second half point is due to the 45 minute delay we incurred waiting for our table. Even though we had to wait, the maitre 'd did a very good job keeping us informed about the delay (a table wasn't clearing out fast enough) and arranged with the owner, who stopped in to check on us, to comp us a significant amount off of the bill for the delay.

Later, like 10:30 at night, works well because you miss the main rush. But bottom line, there is absolutely nothing better on earth than the Burrata. NOTHING.\n\nUpdate - went again last night for the first time in years. Our company was lovely and that made the night. The food was also great - we got the burrata, a margherita pizza, lasagna special, short ribs, white beans, potatoes and brussel sprouts, and a nice white wine. One thing we did notice is that the service is off - our waitress would ask us a question and then leave without listening to the answer. But the food is still good!", "author": "Sarah R."}

Food was tasty, atmosphere was lovely, great wine list, but ended up very disappointed by our waitress. We were greeted by a warm staff--the hostess and our initial server, but our server changed after about 10 minutes of being there. While the food was all very flavorful and well prepared, there's something extremely disappointing about poor service. I have to acknowledge the support staff who thankfully remained attentive and accommodating throughout our meal. But our waitress came across arrogant and uninterested. At any rate, we enjoyed the burrata and peppers to start off our meal, and we had the pork and the halibut entrees and also delicious sides of corn and the incredible arugula salad.  The pasta which my daughter ordered was somewhat bland but everything else I'd call exceptional. What ended our experience on the unpleasant side was again our waitress...who assumed (and charged us for) a large pasta order despite ordering a kid-sized portion. When we were curious about the charge and inquired about the bill, she gave us complete attitude. How she handled the whole exchange was rude and unprofessional. For me, there's little that's worse than when trying to enjoy an otherwise wonderful meal and environment, while having a server that seems to exude unpleasantness. Perhaps she was having an off night--who knows--but perhaps she could have simply recognized that we were patrons to her restaurant where she's employed to be knowledgeable and helpful about the menu, and provide good service.", "author": "Kristen J."}

We chatted with one of the owners while waiting for a table and she recommended an Italian white (called 'titolo', I think) that was awesome.  \n - the pasta comes in half orders, which is a perfect size if you just want a little taste.  \n \nDownsides:\n - found my pasta a bit salty.  I got the buccatini with almond pesto.  I think the saltiness came from the pecorino it was topped with.\n - waiting.  we had a reservation, but even so had to wait a bit.

The food is your standard delicious California-inspired Italian cuisine.  Solid effort.  If only A16 wasn't in a city like San Francisco, where sooo many places do what they do well also.  So A16 gets lost in my memory, mixed in with other expensive, solid, and yet forgettable places like Conduit, Farina, and Range.  As with these other places, they are great restaurants for dates, to bring baby boomer aged parents, and provide a gracious atmosphere and service for a lovely long dinner.

Modern and cute inside with dim lighting makes this place a nice intimate setting, though it's fairly packed with people. At first we ordered a pasta with chile in it and it came out literally looking like pasta with sriracha hot sauce drizzled on top and tasted like it too. Upon trying it, I could tell the pasta had great texture but couldn't even taste it because the spicyness of the sauce overpowered the entire dish. What a shame, I kept thinking. When we sent the dish back (I usually never do this) the server was so sweet and wonderful about it, she allowed us to choose something else in place. This time we tried the MACCARONARA with ragu napoletana and house-made ricotta salata, which our server said was her favorite. Let me tell you, this pasta was so fantastic that I can daydream about it! The pasta noodles were freshly made, thick and CHEWY. The sauce was excellent as well and, overall, I think the simplicity of the dish is what made it so great. It's like eating the best spaghetti you will ever have. \nWe also had the margherita pizza and added arugula. B was slightly disappointed that it didn't come with baby arugula. This probably would have been a better option for them to use because the large arugula leaves dressed over the pizza made it a little difficult to eat. The pizza was good, nonetheless.

The olive oil had such a pure taste that I couldn't stop mopping it up. This was a good sign. Bread is such an important indicator of a restaurant's attention to detail.\n\nSalads, cured meats, olives, and cheese were passed around, all delightful. The house cured meats were particularly exciting, as their personal touches shook the salames and pates out of the expectations I'd built up after plenty of grocery store foraging over the years. \n\nAs we grazed on the array of snacks we'd ordered, it hit me by surprise. The aroma of fresh crust, tomato sauce, and cheese wafted my way. Luckily we'd ordered a bunch of pizzas to try, as after catching a whiff of the pizza scent floating out of their kitchen, there was nothing that could have prevented me from eating one. The thin, tasty, cracked crust provides an unrivaled foundation. As I ate it, I tried to think of pizza in Italy that compared, but I couldn't. This was better, though I never made it south of Rome. \n\nMy entree came along and was fine. The gnocchi was beyond delicate, melting seconds after putting it in my mouth. My complaint was that they didn't do enough with the chantrelles. There must be some way to illuminate their flavor more and spread them throughout the dish.\n\nAfter dessert I was so full it was painful.

The standouts are the pizzas, homemade buratta and, of course, the wine list, which is full of obscure, regional Italians.  I know nothing about these, but the wait staff is very helpful.  At a recent dinner party, our server suggested one $40 dollar bottle after another; each was delicious.  The salumis, also made in-house, are tasty too but lack the gaminess of made-in-Italy sausages.\n\nMonday is meatball night.\n\nOr so I've been told.

Which was good, since my other friend and I hadn't even made it to the Marina yet and parking was a pain in the ass due to some beer festival. We finally parked right in front of the Palace of Fine Arts and met our friend at the Grove where he was enjoying a beer. 5 minutes later the A16 hostess called to say there was a cancellation and we could be seated after all. SWEET!\n\nI'm always confused by restaurants that put out only olive oil with their bread. No herbed oil, no balsamic vinegar, just straight olive oil. It's a little strange. A16 should invest in some balsamic or at the very least, rosemary and garlic.\n\nThe pizza I had was delcious, and you get a really nice sized pie for the money. I could only eat half of it. Yay for leftovers! I wish they had a more reasonably priced side salad, to balance out the carb heavy pizza.\n\nOur service was good, when the waiter was around, but he disappeared for long stretches. We were having good conversation and the place was a little busy, so we didn't mind. Plus he didn't act like he was too busy to deal with our requests. The bus boys filled the water regularly (always a good thing). \n\nIf you don't like sitting on top of everyone else, I wouldn't recommend A16. They jam the tables together and you have to weave in between them like you're in a maze. Otherwise, it's a pretty reasonably priced, delicious meal.", "author": "Jessica B."}

I'd been hearing about A16 for a while from my friend Brien W., whose sister Anna helped start the restaurant and worked with the Nate Appleman (the former exec chef) and Liza Shaw (the present one). Since then I visited A16 a few times and had my birthday dinner there this year. Throughout the time I've sampled a variety of items off the menu and the whole range has been really good, but A16 is especially known for a few things: its mozzarella burrata with olive oil, sea salt, and crostini; the tuna conserva with dried favas and roasted peppers; the house-cured salumis; and, of course, the Neapolitan-style pizzas. The latter are my favorites and compete with Pizzeria Delfina for the best pizza in the city. I also really enjoy their wines and the sommelier, Shelley Lindgren, is excellent and always ready to listen to you and recommend a good option.\n\nThe service is generally good, but can be hit-and-miss sometimes. A16 is not a quiet place by any means, so don't count on having a nice romantic dinner because it is always infused with energy and tends to get pretty loud. I would almost say it's better with a group of people since you can order a variety of dishes to share then. It is usually busy, even on weekdays, so reservations are a good idea.

However, let me plead my case as to why it only gets a 3...\n\nFor one, getting a reservation here is a serious ordeal.  You should be booking at least 2 weeks in advance - expect a poor time, be happy if  you get what you asked for.  Secondly, it's like a zoo in there.  The place is jam packed all the time, with nowhere to wait.  Don't expect to find relief when you sit down, because the tables are just as 'cozy'.\n\nNow, why would I go back?  The food is pretty damn tasty...even looking past the stereotypical marina crowd.  If I recall correctly, I sampled the proscuitto plate, a squid ink pasta, pizza dish, and an olive plate.  All were better than expected. \n\nService was good with the staff knowledgable about the wine and dishes.  Kudos to the management for training them properly!\n\nI think I'll come back to A16 when the opportune time comes, but for now they have slipped from glory.", "author": "Simon Y."}

Two real standouts - the atmosphere and the hospitality. Sadly, both are increasingly in short supply these days. A16 benefits from having one of the more unique settings, but they've filled the space with warmth and a terrific staff.\n\nTwo other constants in our visits are the pizza Margherita and the salumi. There are some wonderful pizza joints in The City but I'd stack A16's Margherita against any of them, as well as many east coast pizzerias. As for the salumi, you can't go wrong with any selection but the prosciutto tasting is consistently excellent.\n\nAmong pastas the gnocchi is truly outstanding. It's really the only pasta I'd substitute for one of their entrees, in part because I've become a white bean fiend in the past year and A16's take is pure bliss.\n\nThe dining room can get a little loud, particularly on the weekends, which is a shame because during a lull you'll turn to your dining companions and ask, \"Is this Talib Kweli they're playing?\" Too good.\n\nSome detractors will lament that A16 \"isn't very Italian.\" Having never been to Italy I can't vouch for the cuisine's authenticity, but what I think those people mean is that A16 \"doesn't fit my definition of an Italian restaurant\" e.g. no Chianti bottles with dripping candles. Isn't that what those tourist traps in North Beach are for?", "author": "Trip T."}

We  tried to make a reservation for a party of 7 only one day early, and it clearly wasn't going to happen. The maitre d' suggested we show up at 5pm as they hold (two) tables for walk ins. They sat us at the first table that's designed to really seat a max of 6, so it was cozy, but not horrible. We were a motley crew of friends and family catching up after almost 2 years, so we were too engrossed in our company and conversation to worry too much about our seating location. There's a separate corridor for walking down to the back of the restaurant so we weren't bothered much by staff and guests walking past to get to the rest of the restaurant.\n\nThe food was great, not excellent, but great.  We shared an appetizer of mozzarella spun with cream, served with EVOO and a brown bread crostini. My dairy sensitive tummy told me no, but my tongue told me yes yes yes! The salumi plate was great, although they factored in a lot of sweetbreads/offal/pate style food, all of which I'm not a fan of, but it was enjoyed by everyone else.\n\nThe wine list was great, very heavy on the Italian wines with a reasonable but limited selection of Californian wines. The range of prices was broad, $30 to $400. You could make it an expensive meal or keep it more affordable based on your wine choices.\n\nMost of us had a proper entree, one had pasta and I had a pizza. I wouldn't rush back for the pizza, but the lamb and beef dishes were delicious, as was the quail. Not sure about the pasta, but the ingredients suggested it should be good. Being able to choose your side dish was great, the potatoes with the salsa verde were cooked and seasoned to perfection. I also liked the way they were served separately in a small bowl- good for sharing and easy for the kitchen staff to prepare :)\n\nNothing on the dessert menu tickled anyone's fancy so no one had anything. There were a lot of savoury-esque items and not a smidge of chocolate to be seen (call me simple, but at least one thing on a dessert menu should have chocolate in it). \n\nUnlike other reviewers, we found the service pleasant and informative. We had a large enough party that we had a few people tending on us at times, which is always fun. The ladies at the table always had their wine glasses filled first -I'm a sucker for classic service like that so thumbs up in that department for me :) We're also a bunch who like to hang about and talk after the meal is done rather than be rushed out and I felt that because we were walk-ins they weren't too concerned about rushing us out because the table was needed for the next reservation. \n\nSo, all in all, a good experience. Crowded and busy, yes, but it's that kind of a place. Will definitely go back, would definitely recommend it and will also be trying SPQR.", "author": "Emily T."}

I would open the doors 10 minutes early and allow them to purchase a $10.00 glass of wine) I had made reservations so we thought we would have a table to sit at, but were shown the bar area in front of the kitchen to sit for dinner. There were tables available so we said we would like a table, after some discussion we were given a table.\nNext came ordering our meal.  I asked our server if I could have the chef make my pasta dish a little spicy, and to my surprise she said no! The chef would not accommodate my request. I then responded with my comment that when going to a less snooty / she she place the chef/cook typically will always fulfill the customers request. I also commented that the chef at A16 was pretentious and could not understand why a simple request could not be made. Next, we placed our order's. Wife and friend had the app portion of pasta while I ordered the dinner size. When the plates were served. I commented that my order must be a mistake and that it was the same size as the small order.  The server's comment was that my pasta is weighed and because it is heavier they cut the portion size down. ???????? We are talkin pasta for god's sake, not Gold!!!!!!!

I've heard some mixed reviews but ultimately don't think that A 16 is that special.  We ordered a lot of items to share so we had a good portion of the menu.  The thing I most enjoyed was that they butcher and make everything in house.  We had a close up view of one of the butchers chopping into a pig's head.  Good stuff. \nMeatballs were the best item of the day if not a bit salty.  The red sauce was good, bright and fresh. \nSausage was pretty expensive at $18 for 2 medium sized rounds.  The sausage needed some more punch, it lacked something even after squeezing a nice helping of lemon.\nSalami plate was interesting.  They gave us some salami, proscuitto, pate and head cheese.  I assume everything was made in house.  It was enjoyable but nothing that memorable which was a shame given all of the effort they put into making their own cured meats.\nThe pizzas were a bit of a disappointment considering this is what they are known for.  All of the pizzas were a bit soggy and didn't have the same crunch/texture you'd expect from a wood burning oven.  My guess is that either the temperature was not high enough or our pizzas were sitting out for a few minutes.  Compared to Delfina these pies were not in the same class.  The margherita was the best of them all because of the good red sauce and nice amount of fresh basil.  The mushroom pizza has an overwhelming earthy woody flavor from the mushrooms.  I think it was over powering all of the other ingredients and disappointing.  The bianca pizza which had proscuitto added was generally just ok.

I've also lived in Italy twice, once in the north and once in the south, for extended periods of time. I rarely agree to eat out at an Italian restaurant because too often the food is not authentic (and more often than not, tastes as though it came out of a can) and therefore, very disappointing. Most restaurants slap high prices onto their meals just because they can, but rarely does it mean it's good.\n\nLast night I went to A16 rather hesitantly and left happier than I've ever left any restaurant in San Francisco. The food was incredible and just about everything I ordered was just how I remembered it while abroad. \nI highly recommend the Burrata cheese with some salame or prosciutto to start. The pasta was simple but perfectly made and the entrees, though I don't know where the recipes originate from, were absolutely mouthwatering delicious.\nOn top of that, the service was outstanding.

It has been at the top of my SF restaurant favorites since it opened. I had a great meal there in August 2008 (with two visitors from Italy), and then went back last night after a two-year hiatus. \n\nSadly, last night's meal was less than stellar. The calamari panzanella was the best thing we had. All else was a disappointment: the beloved, usually infallible burrata tasted like it was one day past its prime, the fish was bland, the pork zampone was heavy and mediocre in flavor, and the romaine and chicory salad was crazy salty. I thought that perhaps they were just having a bad night so I decided  to console myself with the best dessert ever, the chocolate budino tart with sea salt and extra virgin olive oil, but to my horror this dessert is no longer what it used to be. The former hazelnut-infused chocolate awesomeness drizzled with olive oil is now an overly crispy tart (without hazelnuts) topped with a lump of less than remarkable chocolate pudding. The salt and olive oil seemed to be in, rather than on top of, the tart, so the flavors were overly blended, rather than ready to blend on the palate. Oh, and the wines were more expensive and less unique than they used to be. Shelley Lindgren, whose passion and knowledge for Italian wines was always infectious, was not there and was greatly missed. The food was overall less authentic in flavor than it used to be.  \n\nI hope that last night's meal was an exception, so I'll be back again, but I need to have another great meal there before I can recommend it again.", "author": "Viola T."}

This restaurant isn't bad, and it isn't super-good, either. It's uneven. I ate the bruschetta with roast squash and ricotta (excellent), and the salsiccia pizza (very good). For dessert I ordered a scoop of the persimmon sorbet and the fig marsala gelato. The persimmon sorbet was sweet but flavorless (where's the persimmon?), and the fig marsala gelato tasted cinnamon-y, no hint at all of fig or marsala. Since cinnamon gelato was the third gelato available that day--the flavor I DIDN'T order--I queried the wait staff. The waiter shrugged & said the pastry chef scooped it out herself, so there couldn't be any mistake, unless it had been mislabelled. Then the waiter removed the dessert plate with the half-eaten ice creams on it, and that was that. At $3 a scoop for fancy frozen dessert, I would expect better quality, and frankly, a little more concern. \n\nWhich brings me to the service. Like the food, it was uneven. At least 4 different servers showed up at my table at various intervals to do this and that. There was a long wait for the bruschetta starter and nobody bothered to talk to me about the delay (although when the starter finally came the wait staff apologized). Ironically, when you're served by that many wait staff, you don't feel like you're being waited on at all. I was there for lunch, the restaurant was about half-full, and I was dining alone. I can't say that any of these factors may have made a difference. But I've had a much better experience dining alone for lunch or dinner in other restaurants.", "author": "Liz B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-06", "description": "For my first review on Yelp, I'm reviewing the famed A 16 -- a place that more or less accurately represents some of the better (some might say 'standard') aspects of \"upper mid-range\" (or is it \"lower upper-range\") San Franciso dining. \n\nThe equation for this sort of SF establishment (at least, as I understand it) is: delightful atmosphere + overall good New American or Cal-Ital or  Asian Fusion or Italian food (with two-to-four outstanding dishes) + entrees priced in the twenties + a good wine list. If that's the left side of the equation, then A 16 could very much be on the latter side of the equals sign.\n\nA 16 -- located on Chestnut Street in the Marina District -- features Italian food from the Campania region. The menu includes several solid appetizers, a nice selection of pizzas, pastas, and a small collection of entrees. \n\nMozzarella burrata with olive oil appetizer was solid, but not spectacular.  Ricotta gnocchi was enjoyable, with a nice and balanced taste of basil. The Bianca pizza was a highlight. The crust out of the wood-fired oven was crisp, but not too crisp -- just right, in fact. Gelato for desert provided a nice finish, with 2 flavors for $6. Overall, dinner is quite solid, but not of the highest-rank. (Food only: 4/5).\n\nAs others have noted, the wine selection is strong and interesting. Appealing ambiance, and the lighting is well-executed. Our most recent server was direct, efficient; not exactly 'warm,' but I had no doubt in her ability to get things done. Service is general seems fine. \n\nThis is a place than any SF diner will eventually make her or his way to (if only because of the buzz inertia that A 16 still has from its well-received opening several years ago). The food is unlikely to disappoint, and the prices are reasonable for a restaurant with this much attention. Overall, A 16 really is a good example of this sort of SF dining -- a place that out-of-towners might think to be a rare gem, while you in fact know that it's one of many truly strong restaurants.", "author": "Matti L."}

I dock points from places that are difficult to get to, park near, and don't have valet.\n\nIt might be a good neighborhood spot if you are fortunate enough to live in the area.  But the highlight of my meal was the burrata mozzarella (that they purchase).  The pastas left much to be desired.  Had the gramigna nera and maccaronara with tomato ragu.  The former was served with beans.  I did not enjoy the contrasting texture of dense and chewy with soft and mushy in the same bite; so like a kid, I picked out the beans.  I liked the flavors of the squid ink pasta and it had an al dente texture, but the presentation was kind of funky (2\" long black thick strands and brown beans).  The ragu one was just way off - neither liked the texture (not as firm as the other) nor the taste (ragu was lacking in flavor).\n\nWith that said, Husband enjoyed every one of his courses.

Did the OpenTable thing, did the calling thing--no reservation because they were having a function. Oh well. The restaurant looks small on the outside, but it's actually fairly decent sized--full bar, dining rooms and chef counters. By the way, there were a lot of \"cougars\" at A16 on this particular Saturday--I thought my friend was going to get devoured before we got a table.\n\nMost of the staff were really nice--one host was a cutie, our server was extremely cool and nice, and one of the other hostesses, I wasn't crazy about--a little snooty, a little attitudey.

We were starving and were going to get a pizza as an appetizer and then separate entrees, but decided to get the arugula salad with nectarines, aged prosciutto, and the Cavatelli pasta as appetizers and then the mixed lamb roast and roasted beef as entrees. Yes, we were definitely hungry. We got a bottle of the 2004 Contesa, Montepulciano to wash everything down and we couldn't have asked for anything better--we finished it off with ease. Now for the dessert. We got a raspberry crostata  and it was really tasty. It was the topping on a very delicious Italian dinner. The raspberry crostata was on a small plate with what looked like vanilla ice cream, but it was ricotta cheese. It was different and kind of threw off our equilibrium--we were expecting ice cream! But it was good. It was like a raspberry/cheese danish but yummier with crunchy carmelized goodness and more expensive than a danish. \n\nI recommend A16 to anyone.

We ordered flights of wine and my date and I sat there for fifteen minutes (literally) with no results.  When I asked our server about the wine, she told us the bar was really busy and backed up.  Meanwhile she proceeded to hang out at various tables in her section, not once heading off to check on our drinks.  So after twenty minutes or more we still had nothing but water.  I finally decided to investigate and walked up to where the bar was.  I half expected to see a scene akin to the evacuation of Saigon, with people hanging out of helicopters clutching wine bottles, but the bartender was not even especially busy.  I asked a guy walking by if he worked there and he said yes, he was the manager.  I told him what was up and he immediately got us our wine, and even a little extra taste of something.  \n\nNow this guy rocked, and did kind of make up for the brain dead server, who must have got an earful from him because she then decided to get back at us by ignoring us completely.

I know this because I went to the restroom, and as I walked by, the sommelier was opening our bottle.  By the time I came out and walked by, the bottle had been partially poured into the decanter.

No greeting, no 'how was the white wine?' we had ordered while waiting.  Nothing.  After she sloppily poured our glasses, she curtly said, \"I'll come by to top off your glasses later\" and took off with the decanter.

Anyway, I was in a bit of a slump before going to A16, and they totally renewed my happy vegan attitude. \n\nWhen my friend suggested that we go there, I had hesitations. Trendy Italian restos with home-made pasta (read egg) and lots of fancy cheeses are not usu so vegan friendly, but the server at A16 was an ex-vegan herself, and knew all of the stuff on the menu we could eat (which was a surprisingly long list) and was sensitive even to the pizza dough and pasta egg content question. We ended up getting a beat salad that was pretty good (although the beats could have been a bit fresher, it seemed like they may have sat around a bit), a marinara pizza (this is actually already on the menu woohoo). We added mushrooms ($5!), but they were nice chewy earthy mushrooms. The pizza sauce was sooo good with lots of flavor. They also had one type of pasta that was vegan, and it was fabulous. They were little folded over ear pastas (forgive me, but I forget the name!) with a nice red sauce and white beans (yes we even got protein). They seem to really know their red sauces, which so often end up bland and in need of salt. They even had a vegan dessert (sorbet), but we skipped it, since we were stuffed. \n\nWe also had a really nice wine that was on the cheaper end of the wine menu. It was a Pinot Noir from Copain Winery. It was nice and full of black cherry and blueberry flavors that were light and food friendly. Perfect summer red.\n\nThe only thing that bugged me about the experience was the server felt the need to tell me that she was vegan until...dun dun dun... she got pregnant, and everything changed! Personally, I plan to stay vegan for the rest of my life, and believe me it's possible to do so without killing your baby or having them turn green and grow antennae (actually that might be cool). She was very nice, though, and I did appreciate her knowledge of veganism, so overall I'm a happy little vegan camper and can recommend a trip to A16 for other vegan kiddies looking for a nice dinner and willing to brave the Marina.", "author": "Jeani H."}

This past Thursday, I tried to make a reservation around 5 pm for 8pm that night for four people.  However, the earliest they had available was 9:30 pm.  They have the front section of tables set up just for walk-ins and the back is for reservations.  \n\nMy friends wanted to eat at 8 pm and we were going to meet for drinks at 7 pm.  I figured I would put my name in at A16 and go to Bin38 for a drink while we waited.   The hostess told me that this could not be done and that I would have to wait at the restaurant to put my name down.  I find it so unbelievably obnoxious when restaurants do this - if way trendier places in NYC can do it, A16 should do it.  But the place did not seem too busy so I figured we'd still go to Bin38 for a glass or two of wine and then head over to A16.  \n\nWell, when we got there I put my name down and the hostess told me it should be about 15 minutes.... 50 minutes later (almost 9pm) we were seated.  While waiting, we were forced to stand huddled along the wall and we couldn't face each other to talk.  If you're going to require people to stay at the restaurant  to put a name down, then accommodate! \n\nWe started off with the buratta (my fav), it was delicious as usual.  They had a pork liver brushetta on special and it was just average.  One of my friends is a vegetarian, so we ordered the Margherita and the Bianca.  This was definitely a little too boring for me, but I typically like white pizza so I thought it would be okay. The Bianca had green olives on it but it was still really bland and nothing special. The Margherita was okay, but how hard is it to do that?  I would come back again for the pizza but would have to get something more interesting. \n\nAlso, I still think the wine list is ridiculous.  They need to have more reasonably priced bottles if they're going to serve $15 pizzas.  We only ordered one as a table.  It's unfortunate, b/c I would come more often if I could get a bottle of wine for a bit cheaper.  I'd end up spending the same amount of money but would have 2 bottles instead of one!", "author": "Katie S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-08-19", "description": "I like it, I like it, I LIKE IT!!\n \nOff the bat, let me say that A16 is not a 5-star kind of place.  It's just not.  The bar is really cool, and the seating is also quite nice - - the ambience is all good, and so forth, but this is just not Acquerello, French Laundry, etc. type of 5-stars.\n \nLife took a strange turn one weekend - - and I was trying to get back on my feet from that blow.  Sh*t happens, and when it does, you either get back up or you stay down.  I always get back up - - but good food and lots of alcohol always helps.\nSo, I get taken to A16..... for dinner.  It's to cheer me up.... or perhaps it was bribery.  I don't know.\n \nParking is seriously an issue here!!!!!!!!!!!!  Meters are crazy expensive, too, or so I am  told.  I was dropped off at the restaurant but ended up waiting on my own for a good 20 minutes while the car was parked.\n \nFirst - - let's just touch on the service.  Service here is sketchy.  It's not horrible, nowhere near that.  But it's not great - - nowhere near that either.  It's hit or miss, and then kind of mediocre even when it hits.  The hostesses.... I'm not sure if they were just bimbos or if they were unfriendly - - but it seemed that they either took 4 minutes to register one sentence, or just didn't care to react to whatever was being said.  Was it that they assmed I was speaking in a foreign language?  Can they not hear me, though I can hear them?  Anyone home?  Helloooo--oooo?  (insert echo) \nNow I don't expect much from a hostess - - I expect efficiency, and a smile.  Neither is offered here.  Hmm.  OK....\nBut once we got seated (after a 30 minute wait or so, which is great, considering it was a full house and we did not have reservations), the waitstaff was better.  Our guy was nice enough - not very quick on the uptake or very attentive, but really nice enough and if asked twice, he got everything done.  Our busboy was better, actually.  And the sommelier we got - - she was friendlier, but I am not so certain regarding how good of a sommelier she is.  Perhaps I know too many people who know good wine...\n \nNow, the food.\nWell - - I have to say that THE OCTOPUS AND ARUGULA SALAD SERVED HERE IS THE BEST IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.  Wow.  Amazing.  Now I tend to order this alot at various places - - and the closest to this that I ever got was Acquerello in SF, which was also terrific, but even they could not hold a candle to how good this was at A16.  DELICIOUS.  5 stars!\nWe also had their house-made fresh Mozzarella with the works - -  super fresh ingredients with outstanding tomatoes..... I loved it, especially with the wine we had. 4.5 stars!\nThey are well-known for their pizzas so we had to try that, too.  So we ordered the Funghi pizza - - mushrooms, mozzarella, etc.  REALLY GOOD, strong 4-stars.  I recommend this particular pizza... and this means alot as I am not big on pizza, at all.\nLastly - - the main entree.\nAfter much thought - we settled on the halibut based on our not particularly craving meat that night - AND the server's recommendation.  This was pretty bad.  Bad, bland, boring.  I could boil a halibut to be tastier than this.  I mean, halibut is not a hard fish to cook - meaty, with enough fat in it, and tasty on its own.  It's hard to go wrong and yet, they somehow did.  REAL disappointment.  1 star.\n \nSo.... combining the mediocre service with the awful halibut to the outstanding appetizers and pizza - - - I settle on a good 4 stars for A16.\n\n\nFYI - this restaurant gets WARM.  At some point, it felt like a steam room.  Full house, no ventllation and bottles of wine  - - -not a good thing.  Dress in layers.... and be ready to peel them off one by one!\n\n***********************\n\nEdit on 6/6/08 to add:\nBartenders here are terrific.\nAnd try the salumi samplers -  some head cheese type of meat, pork belly concoctions, excellent prosciutto, etc.  Their homemade burrata cheese was quite good, too, but I'd prefer it unheated.\nAlso had the pizza.... great crust, quite tasty.  At A16, I suggest you skip any and all entrees - - just pig out on appetizers and their pasta.  Their basic ragu sauce with homemade THICK pasta noodles was nothing short of EXCELLENT.", "author": "Grace K."}

Sure, you can get a margherita pizza (and an excellent, blistered-crust one at that).  But there are also things like housemade buffalo sausage.  And interesting appetizers, the best section of the menu.   And the quality of ingredients is high, and they stick to their Southern Italy schtick quite nicely, as opposed to throwing whatever vaguely Italian trendy food item of the moment on the menu.  They do concede to trendiness in the form of burrata, which people love (and rightly so, because it is delicious) but which totally pisses me off.  Why?  Because I used to buy an entire tub of the EXACT same cheese that A16 flies up from Long Beach at Bristol Farms in LA, and it cost $10 and was fresher.  A16 charges that much for a wimpy sliver!  (gnashing teeth in fury...).\n\nRegardless, because the goodness of A16 is no secret, reservations are a pain.  Solution: go on an off night or early weekend and grab a seat at the bar.  Then you can have cute Kevin the bartender take you the otherwise confusing wine list (who's ever heard of, let alone tasted, those random Italian varietals?).   Please do not follow in my high-maintenance footsteps of tasting 6 reds before committing, though he will humor you if you do.\n\nTwo more words of advice: order at least one dessert, as they are off-the-path in the best way possible - no standard panna cotta here.

I recommend making reservations at the back bar in front of the kitchen if you are a fan of Top Chef, you will like the action. Anyhow, we had a 4 top near the back patio. The place is cozy, decent decibel level (good music, allows for conversation) and good food. The service is my only problem. Although the girl at the front was friendly, real and full of great advice, our server was \"removed\" - and borderline fake. I don't think she was happy to be there. As far as the food: \n- Beet Salad - awesome. enough for 4 to share a few bites. Great starter. \n- Mozzarella Burata - a MUST. Get one or two. The best mozzarella you will have tasted. Served w/crunchy toasts. \n- Side of roasted butternut squash. a MUST. So damn good. crunch and smooth. Get one order for two or even two for 4 people. \n- Sardine Bruchetta - I love sardines. But I was not in love with the way it was served on what tasted like hummus. It was heavy. I prefer sardines drenched in olive oil and lemmon, served simply on a plate alone. \n- Fabriano Salumi - a plate of cured salami, very very god. \n- Pizza - good but not the best. \nOur table started w/champagne (pink) then two of us continued w/a bottle of white and two others - the guys, chose to go the Chimay route. To sum it up, this place is great for shared plates of cured meats, interesting apps, wine selection and warm cozy festive (stylish holiday decor) - love the black wood atmosphere. Great entrance good place to bring another couple and share a tasty southern style italian meal. Service desperately needs improvement. Seems to be an ongoing issue.", "author": "Amy E."}

If you decide to come here, I would make reservations before heading out. \n\nThis was our 1 year anniversary so we wanted some place special. I received 2 recommendations from Jim Stewart and my boss.  They both raved about this place so I thought it would be the perfect experience... \n\nWe got to the restaurant and they took us back to our table. As we approach the back of the restaurant, the hostess turns around and apologizes that they did not have a table. It's not the end of the world but it was a foreshadowing of things to come. After waiting about 15 min, we finally get our table. It looks like they just threw a table in the back. I couldn't even move my seat back more than an inch or else I would hit the chair behind me. The table was horrible! It wobbled like a rocking chair. It almost felt like it was gonna fall over. After bringing this to the attention of our waiter Nico, he pushed the table against the wall and said he was going to get a wedge for the table. About 10 minutes later, he mentioned that he forgot the wedge and came back to fix the table. \n\nNico seemed like a very nice and knowledgeable guy, the few seconds we actually got to talk to him. It felt like he was running around like a chicken with his head cut off. Every time he came to our table, we felt like we were an after thought. \n\nWe started with the Margherita pizza. This was the best dish of the night. The crust was crispy, the cheese was gooey and the herbs were fresh and flavorful. We probably should have just stuck to the pizza. We then ordered the Bucatini with Monterey sardines, dried san marzanos, capers, green olives, garlic and chiles and squid ink tonnarelli with shrimp, zucchini, garlic, mint, anchovies and chiles. The squid ink pasta was very flavorful and actually pretty good. The Bucatini with sardines was extremely fishy and not our cup of tea. I took one bite and didn't touch it again. For our main course, we ended up splitting the local rock cod in acqua pazza with basil. I thought the bay scallops and muscles with this dish was cooked to perfection. My gf said the fish was really fishy even compared to the sardine bucatini. The sauce they use tasted similar to Chinese satay sauce. The side dish of roasted potatoes with pickled onions, capers and chiles was delicious and the best part of our main course. \n\nI really wanted to like this place but I'm sad it was not as good as I had hoped.", "author": "Ken W."}

I paid like $40 for two glasses of wine while waiting in the cramped entry way for an hour after the host said it was going to be twenty minutes.  Then the wine bar is actually not part of the restaurant so they can't put it on one bill, all this after trying to get the bartenders attention for 15 minutes!  Then we sat down.  We had a good seat which was a surprise.  We ordered a salad.  It tasted so bad I didn't understand why it was called a salad and why it was on the menu.  some sort of beet salad w/ onion ehhh!  \nI had been told by a friend that the place was great.  My girlfriend and I looked at the menu and figured why get pizza when we can get it anywhere in SF and pay half the price for it.  So I ordered a Pork Chop and she ordered a pasta dish.  After a long time it came out.  It was not cooked at all.  The thing was rubber and in-edible, and the side was clearly not fresh and flat aout tasted bad.  How hard is it to cook a pork chop and some potatoes.  I can do it easily.  My girlfriends pasta looked terribe and tasted even worse.  I never have had a bad dinner like this in my life!  I seriously can't ever remember sending a dish back to be cooked.  So ten minutes later it came back.  The pork chop was just disgusting covered in fat and no meat.  The pasta was terrible and my girlfriend couldn't eat it.  \nWhen we left we went down the street and ate some pizza because we were still hungry.  I spent $100 and got garbage in return.  \nIf you want high priced, crapy pizza and overpriced wine then go there.  Don't bother getting any of the entres.

We agreed on the funghi pizza and two others: zucchini salad with green olives and parmesan; and I ordered the burrata which was so highly recommended here. Now, the pizza was absolutely fantastic! The crust was thin and the mushrooms were just extremely flavorful. The zucchini salad was good, however, the burrata served with proscuitto was really disappointing. Both my lunch companions are seasoned travelers, one of who has been in the 5-star hotel industry and the other, a lifestyles magazine editor for many years. The consensus on the burrata was that it was so-so, nothing to write home about. Having said that, we did enjoy our meal, the service was good, nothing exceptional. I must say the iced tea was really one of the best I've had and I'm an iced tea afficionado.

That being said, I expected better from A16. After hearing rave reviews from friends I was really excited about coming to dinner here. \n\nThe first thing that went wrong was the reservation. I had made a reservation early that morning for 3 people for 9:30, a reasonably late reservation. At around 6 we extended that reservation for 4. When we got there at 9:30, the hostess tells us that we are going to be seated in the bar section in the front. I was a little perturbed to say the least. I asked her why there was an issue sitting us in the dining room and she said it's because we extended our reservation. What I don't understand is that a table for 3 is basically a table for 4 right? So they sat us at the front, we ordered some appetizers and we were later moved to the dining room. The one bonus is that they must have felt sorry for messing up, so our table did receive comped prossecco, but that still doesn't make up for the fact that they screwed up our reservations. The next thing that went wrong was when we were seated in the dining room my silverware settings were dirty! \n\nSo now onto the food.. I've definitely had better Italian before, especially for that price. The house-cured bresaola was definitely my favorite appetizer, along with the arugula salad with nectarines, fennel, walnuts, green olives and ricotta salata. For dinner I had the maccaronara with tomato ragu and house-made ricotta salata and it was just mediocre.. The wine selection was wonderful, I can't remember the name of the wine, but it was so good! It was a dark red with a full body but it was so smooth at the same time. \n\nI guess I'll just wait a little while and try back some other time to see if my experience improves.

The Tuna was interesting and good.\n\nMy dining partner (who suggested the place) and I shared half orders of Maccaronara with tomato ragu that was absolutely fantastic and the pumpkin/ricotta gnocci with kale, red onions and pancettea, equally fantastic and a unique take on gnocci.  We had sides of cannelini beans and a chard with lemon and anchovy.  There was nothing left on any plates.  We had a house cured beef salami as an after dinner savory before dessert.\n\nThe chocolate bundito with olive oil and sea salt was sublime, but the suggested wine pairing with it should be mandatory!

We also opted for the chocolate tart with olive oil and sea salt which was very nice. Even at the counter service was great, and having tried pizzas around the Bay I would say that overall A16 tops even Delfina and Pizzaiolo.\n\nDinner:\n\nWe sat at the back Patio which was very romantic and intimate, although the constantly changing heat lamp made it hard to get totally comfy. While they had a set V-Day menu, we selected our dinner from the regular menu. We started with a salad course; the tuna conserva salad was totally delicious. Next was a Pasta course, Abby had the squid ink pasta which was pretty good, but I had the Bucantini with roasted tomato and almond pesto and it was pretty pathetic. I totally understand a small sized pasta portion, but this was literally a single fork-twist of pasta. On top of that it was dry and totally boring (at $11 this is not ok). However, the fish entree we shared was really nice and came with some great sides. They also do a fantastic espresso and are more than capable of matching wines for any of your dinner selections. For a multi course meal that included wine and dessert the final price tag of $150 was very acceptable.\n\nWhether you want an intimate meal or a quick bite A16 is a great place to go. Plan ahead, they fill up quick every night of the week.", "author": "Alex D."}

After learning that chefs come in on Mondays, we decided to try it out.  The wine list is very good, and the bartender was extrememly knowledgeable.  Hubby had the pork and pronounced it delicious.  I had the pizza, and though the reviews talked about how great it is, I didn't care for it.  There was little taste to the sauce, and any good italian knows that the success of any pizza depends on the flavor of the sauce.  Also the center was undercooked, so it was a soggy mess.  The dessert was ok.  We had the gelato and it was served in this weird tiny, plasticy, cheap-looking cup: completely opposite of how it would served in Italy. The waitress rushed us: hey, it wasn't our fault that we had a late reservation! It was all that was available.  I saw some of the characters from the Real World: Miami there, and the chef had a mohawk.

From Chestnut Street, it appears to be nothing more than a small restaurant of no more than a few tables, but it is much longer than it is wide.  \n\nWe walked in here around 9pm on a Thursday night and managed to get a table within 15 minutes.  I had already had 2 glasses of wine, so I didn't exactly need another.  I skipped right to dinner and I ordered the flank steak, which was a little on the rare side, but very good.  Their entrees come with a side dish, so I selected the the romaine and chicory salad.

The crust is delicious and the chili oil they bring with the pizza is great, gives it a nice kick. The atmosphere is so fun and it is a great place to bring friends. Some people complain that it is too loud, but I find it festive. The olive oil that is served with the bread before the meal is the best around - it is grassy and peppery at the end. I always try not to eat too much bread so I have room for my dinner, but that olive oil always gets me. I personally find the food here better in the spring/summer because I enjoy the seasonal offerings more (the fire roasted corn with black pepper is wonderful).

But that was nearly 6 years ago, maybe more. This restaurant has been through a lot in the last few years, losing the two chefs who took it to the top of the list of America's great Italian restaurants. In late 2010 I had a couple of so-so meals there, but last month ago I stopped in on a whim and was very pleased to see they were back on their game. The salumi was great. The two pasta dishes we ordered were perfect as were the salads. The waiter was ace. He helped us pick excellent wines by the glass. I love the wine list there. One of the very best I have seen in the city for Italian wines, all from the southern regions, and the staff knows the wines well.

Mind you, I did go there on a Friday night, but there was no rhyme or reason to anything.  We had to wait almost 45 minutes for our table, and we had reservations (that I had made a month prior).  We decided to wait outside since it was so congested inside.  The host could visibly see us, but failed to come and let us know when the table was ready. We had to continually check back with her until we were finally seated.  It was a little easier to relax once we were at the table, but things still felt a little rushed.  The service was mediocre as the waitress did not have a strong grasp of the menu, and the menu itself was a little difficult to decipher.  The placement of the items and the food descriptions did not do the food justice. \nThe tomato sauce on my fresh maccheronara pasta was amazing.  Simple and flavorful just like you'd find in Italy, and the fresh gnocchi that my friend ordered was equally lovely.

We ordered bruschetta with porcini, beet salad, pizza margherita, porcini pasta and panna cotta for dessert.  The meal was phenomenal.  This was the first time I have ever tasted fresh porcini mushrooms and wow!    The chef cooked it just right.  The pizza margherita was the best I've ever had.  And the panna cotta was heavenly, the perfect ending for a perfect meal.  The only complaint is that they really undercook their pasta.  I love my pasta al dente but theirs was almost raw!  \n\nUpdate: This weekend I went there with the same group of friends.  The place was humming with customers.at 5:30 p.m.  Porcinis were not the menu this time so we ordered the beet and arugula salads, a prosciutto taster, a tripe appetizer and a pasta with rod cod.  Most everything was as expected.  The salads were very tasty and seasoned just right.  We all loved the beet salad.  The most memorable part of the meal for me were the prociutto and the pizza margherita.  I never knew prosciutto could be so tasty.  It wasn't salty and chewy like some other types I've had which proved that those were probably low in quality.  The pizza crust was thin and chewy and cooked perfectly with just the right amount of burnt spots.  The perfect amount of tomato sauce kept the crust from becoming soggy.  Then came the pasta.  I thought the pasta I had last time was just a fluke but the pasta was raw again.  Even our waiter agreed that the pasta was raw.  Pasta should not be crunchy.  Unfortunately, even though the pasta was cooked right the second time, the dish was too fishy for our taste.  To end the meal, we had blue bottle coffee and yogurt panna cotta.  The yogurt panna cotta was not as good as the ones they made with cream so I was a little disappointed.  But it was still good.

My major complaint was that the bread was simultaneously too soggy and thick.  The pizza kept sagging but was rather doughy as well.\n- SERVICE:  Had to ask for bread; waitress kept on trying to take my check even while I was still having dessert; basic requests were barely met.\n- DECOR: Very average.  No charm.  Back patio looks like a converted shanty town.\n- MINOR PREJUDICE: I saw that the two single-occupancy bathrooms were gender-specific, which seems ridiculous in this social climate.  Seems overly biased against transgendered individuals.  (I'm not transgendered, but things like this give the Marina the vibe it has).  This is admittedly nitty, but I just wanted to raise the issue.\n- UNRESPONSIVE FOH: I think the service was bad from the get-go.  The maitre'd was chit-chatting with her friend for 5 minutes.  When I checked in, she told me they were setting my table.

The atmosphere inside the restaurant is great, its pretty loud, and very crowded... maybe not the place for a romantic meal, but a great spot for a trendy night out. Originally I had my mind set on pizza, because I had heard so many great things, but after looking at the menu, my eye was drawn to the pasta's... the only real solution was to forgo appetizers, split a margherita pizza and order a couple of pasta's. The margherita pizza came out first (and very quickly) and it was very good, but I have to admit, Pizzeria Delfina has them beat here. However, the homemade pasta is heavenly and it will bring me back to this restaurant in the near future. Also of note, they have an Italian lager-style beer which is great and a must try ($5).

He sold us on the tripe starter. I agreed, but after eating it I wished we would have tried something else. It was just a little chewy for me. Next he ordered the Salsiccia pizza. He went off the menu a little with this one and asked for an egg to be on top of the pizza. It was an interesting addition and very good. After the pizza we had the Maccaronara pasta. We actually ordered two of this dish because it was so good. It was seriously one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had! Finally, we had the Chocolate budino tart with sea salt and extra virgin olive oil which was very tasty and unlike any other chocolate tart I've ever had. If I make it back I would stay away from the tripe, but everything else was great!", "author": "Michael P."}

Great vibe, lots of energy, cool bar, brick walls.\n\nFood:  So hit and miss.  \n\nBruschetta with eggplants :  A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  If Ieft after this dish I would've given 5 stars.  Huge slab of egglplant (we're talking an inch thick), huge slab of heirloom tomato, and delicious home-made cheese.  Generous portion size.  My only complaint was that with such generous toppings the bread got weighed down and soggy and wasn't able to hold up.  \n\nMushrooms with Kale:  Good, nothing amazing.  Needed a little salt.  Hard to mess up mushrooms.\n\nPizza Romana and Margherita:  Toppings aside, my hubby and I had the same complaint - the crust was a little soggy and had lost all it's crispness.  The dough itself was also kind of bland.  I found myself pouring on the chii oil or trying to dip in salt just to give it some flavor.  After trying Pizzeria Delfina the week before, A16 just couldn't come close to measuring up.  Sad, b/c I had heard good things about their pizza.\n\nIf I go back, I'll avoid the pizza, stick to more appetizers, and maybe split the meatballs - heard those were good.  Do I need to go back?  No.  Not worth the $$$.", "author": "Casey M."}

What came to the table were 2 small spirals of sausage on top of arugula.  When my husband asked where the rest of it was- the server told us- oh, it's only sausage tonight.  My husband then said, \"what happened to the other 2 things?\".  She said, \"well- there's only supposed to be one other item, they must have run out\".  She did not offer a substitute or even apologize.   \n#3- Then dessert menus come out.  We ask the server (a different one now) the flavors of gelato.  She says, \"milk chocolate, and caramel\".  She says that she absolutely LOVES the caramel flavor.  So- we order it.  What she failed to tell us- is that it's SALTED caramel.  That's a pretty big thing to leave out of a description.  \nThis was my second time eating there.  The first time I went was not long after it opened.

First time I went to A16 shortly after they opened I thought the food was incredible. Everything from the burrata (my favorite item on the menu) to the pizza was delicious - and the wine list is incredible and well-focused on Southern Italy (a much overlooked wine area up until that point). On subsequent visits, however, the service was lacking, and the pizza was way too thin - and I lived in Italy for 5 years and ate pizza like drinking water - and A16 was too thin and basically collapsed on the plate. All the flavors were good, but it just didn't stand up like before. The burrata thank god is still good but there's a bit too much attitude and resting on laurels right now.

I've been eating there for months (for lunches and dinner) and think Nate Appleman was a genius and well deserving of the James Beard award he won.  Plus the fact that they've continued to be incredible even without him makes me love this place even more. In fact, I've loved dining there on Wednesdays when they typically do their weekly pork butchering in view of all to see as the kitchen is wide open and there's a great counter where you can really get up close and personal with their techniques. One day, however went a little too far. I was sitting in a booth (at a business lunch) facing the counter/kitchen and all of a sudden the person sitting next to me says, \"oh my God\". I look up towards the kitchen/counter and see a pig snout still attached to its head with a hand saw stuck in the middle of the snout. Wow. A little intense but no big deal. Then, one of the chefs begins sawing and sawing and splits the head right down the middle (through the snout) and the sound was horrible - something out of a horror movie. Not only that but when he grabbed either side of the head and pulled the two halves apart I could have vomited. The sound was something akin to a melon being separated and this along with the visual was a little much. I was unable to even really touch the pasta dish I ordered which came out right when this was happening. It had pig trotters in it and while it was technically the other end of the pig, I just couldn't do it. Thank God I had the amazing and wonderful fresh ricotta bruschetta w/ grilled asparagus before and the chocolate budino afterwards.

It was by our waitresses insistence that we gave it a try - she claimed it was really one of their best dishes.\n\nMargherita Pizza - last thing to come out, and we were really excited for it, the reason we came.  My first bit in and immediately the first thing I thought of was Enzio's frozen pizza which my mother used to buy when I was a kid.  Except Enzio's crust was crispy.  This crust was flat and soggy from an over abundance of bland tomato sauce.  The mozzarella was sparse and unimpressive, and the basil just a token 2 leaves.\n\nIf you want to read about our hostess experience, read on.

(Note - and its not like we came in wearing shorts - we were both dressed to go to a nice place).\n\nWe did not have a reservation (it was Monday), so they said it would be @45 minutes but they would take our phone number and call us if we wanted to walk around (the bar was packed).  No problem.  But 50+ minutes later and no call (we had gone somewhere else for a drink) and I suggested we try back, only to find a few open tables.  Guess they had not gotten around to calling.

The maccaronara was good, but nothing special. The pork sausage did nothing for me and the radicchio's bitterness didn't really do much to bring out the flavor in the sausage.

LOVE Pancetta!  i would totally marry it if I could.. We both thought that although it was good, it would have been better if we had gotten the Margherita with the Pancetta..\n-Next we had the Scialatielli with local calamari, zucchini, basil, chiles and pinenuts which we thought was just alright...  We shoulda had the Maccaronara as everyone suggested..\n-We ended with the Roast Lamb Loin and the Cannellini Beans for our side which were both nothing to write home about..

We are both no connoisseurs when it comes to wine and we did not recognize much on the wine list, but the bartender and servers were very knowledgeable and helped us choose..

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-11-11", "description": "I have had an unusual experience with this place. I don't know what happened but I have been here about 5 times before my more recent visits this month. I always thought it was good, but nothing truly extraordinary. I honestly don't know what happened,  but I have been converted, I have seen the light. Call it education of the pallate, but I am now a believer.\nMy lovely wife and I, after waiting a very long time (still won't take the rating down because the food is so amazing) were seated at the chef's table, that is, the table that faces the chefs where you observe in awe the chefs working their magic while you enjoy your company and your meal. This possibly could be what changed my mind about this place. After observing how everything is prepared, it became evident that this is no ordinary pizzeria. I knew that this is one of few places certified by some Italian pizza agency (forgive my ignorance, I don't know all the details) .When I observed the art of how the pizzas are made here I understood what a far cry they are from anything else you'll find in this city. The ingredients are of course fresh. The key though is the wood burning oven. The pizza is first gently topped with sauce and a light sprinkling of mozarella (again, so different from \"our\" pizza) and then topped with whatever you order. The magic happens in the oven, where wood is tossed in to keep ambient temperature. The pizza maker then hoists the pizza towards the top of the oven in its final stages so that it absorbs some of the smoke from the fire. This adds a very nice smoky, earthy flavor to the pizza. It is then topped off (after removing from the oven) with final ingredients like prosciutto that do better melting into the pie than being baked to a crisp in the oven. Sprinkled with some pepper oil, you have a truly amazing pie, even for those of us who are traditional West Coast pie lovers.\nSo last night I was very hungry and decided to have a pizza as an appetizer and the beef short ribs for my entree. I again watched this all being prepared, which is entertainment by itself and was once again amazed by how good the food was. Absolutely delish. The side potatoes that came with the beef were absolutely to die for. Just perfectly seasoned. The real treat in this whole experience, as I've mentioned above but will say it again here, is watching the chefs. I also learned that the main entrees are also cooked in a woodburning stove. They put the dish in a frying pan and slide it into the stove where it bakes to perfection. This is truly a unique way of cooking. The guy who runs that station is simply unbelievable. By himself (with occasional help with the olive oil or small toppings) he manages to prepare dish after dish, knowing exactly when to remove each from the wood burning oven, visibly scalding himself just a little bit each time. Think about this for a second: he single handedly prepares almost every dish that leaves that kitchen in a restaurant packed with 100 or so people at all hours of the night starting in the early evening. This is not to say he is the master chef, as he is not. It is a humbling act to watch though, this guy has got it going on in a big way. When things slowed down just enough for him to take a swig of water I could not resist the temptation to yell to him (had to yell as unfortunately it is very loud in there) my compliments, of which he was very modest and grateful. It's worth noting that all of the chefs in there clearly know what they are doing and seem to enjoy what they do, even when it seems like that would be impossible, being as busy as they are in a hot kitchen under all that pressure. Wow. That's money well spent.", "author": "Matt H."}

What we normally do is order to eat family style.  We also order each course as we go.  They have amazing italian wine, so ask your server to pair each course.  You can order by carafe or 1/2 carafe vs by bottle if you are into trying a different wine with differerent courses.  Everything on the menu is delicious, so try it all.

Although I'm not a huge fan of Italian food and saucey dishes, we decided to give this place a whirl anyways. We were proptly seated at the bar in the main room (no wait) in front of the brick oven and prep line. At first glance, the restaurant is on the smaller side, long, with rustic decor, nice outside patio and 'family-style' seating.  Everyone was primarily dressed in the 'Marina-uniform' but hell, so was I for the night.  \n\nThe wine list was VERY impressive and can not gush enough over how HUGE of a fan I am of the 1/2 bottle carafes they have to offer.  The sommelier was even nice enough to come over and explain to us his favorites and how the list is formatted. '...the complexity that some of the Italian wines carry with them are unparallel to most California wines....' How true how ture... \n\nOur waitress was also very friendly and even swapped out our side plates before every course...service points. My friend had been here a few times before so I let her order a few small plates, a pizza, and a pasta dish to share (Prosciutto and beet salad, tripe, mozzarella burrata, garlic/anchovy pizza, and mushroom pasta.) I rarely go to a restaurant and truly enjoy every dish; the tripe was my least favorite and I don't even like tripe! The fresh ingredients are highlighted in every plate and are unmasked by heavy sauces and butter. If you're a fan of Olive Garden Style pasta swimming in their signature butter/cream/tablewine slurry, I'm unsure whether to recommend this restaurant to you. I've never been to Italy therefore can not preach to you if this is an 'authentic' Italian restaurant, however I think their approach to food is uncompromising and refreshing. The only thing I was slighty dissapointed about was their pizza; the one we had ordered had a thin crust (+++) but had no cheese on it. (--).  Delicious, but felt it was lacking.  For a restaurant that boasts a certified pizzaiolo chef, have had better a better pie in town (DELFINA!!).  Nonetheless, I can't wait to go back!", "author": "William R."}

You know, that I'm all giggles and easy to impress. I'm actually one of the most obnoxiously picky people I know :) and very proud to be so. Having that said that, I felt it was time for me to write a review that wasn't so scrumtrillecent. \n I haven't been to A16 in a while but they were the first place that popped into my head when I thought \"Which restaurant in recent memory would I not give 4 or 5 stars to?\" The last time I tried to go there I was with my entire family and was told by the hostess on the phone that they did not take reservations for a party of 8 but if we came in soon after they opened we might have an chance at being seated. After dropping off the kiddies with the babysitter we rushed to make it over to A16 before 5:30. We were told the wait would be 2 hours. Thanks, informative hostess person. I'm glad I stubbed my toes running down my apartment stairs in order to toss myself in the back of my brothers Suburban to hear I would have to wait 2 hrs for a table. No thanks.\n The time before that, my husband and I went out for a nice dinner date and waited only 15 minutes at the bar. We had a nice glass of wine at the bar while we waited. Somehow, in this 15 minutes we got into the first and biggest argument of our relationship about what, I don't remember. All I remember is sitting down at our table and becoming that annoying bitter fighting couple who is having a horrible night and glaring at the waitress as if it were her fault we're having a bad time. I'm sure she and the other wait staff whispered about us back at the POS. Not entirely A16's fault but it's all I remember from that experience. I think it's ruined for me now. To our servers credit, she did not charge us a corkage fee for the wine we brought in and was always sweet and attentive during the lulls in the argument where we just sat back to glare at each other. So I can't be too hard on them. I think the food I had was good.

The city of Naples is the capital of Campania as well as the birthplace of pizza.  In fact, Neapolitans were among the first Europeans to use tomatoes as food, which were purely ornamental before someone discovered their many uses in cooking.  \n\nSituated on the quiet end of Chestnut Street in Pacific Heights, this warm and inviting restaurant lulled me into a peaceful state.  Although I have heard the restaurant can be quite loud, the evening I visited was calm and subdued.  I took a table in the covered patio in the far end of the restaurant and sipped a glass of Prosecco di Valdobbiadene while I perused the menu.  I was craving hearty pasta and desperately needed to replace the memory of my last Italian meal (at a less revered establishment) when a lasagna Bolognese arrived with an unwelcome \"ingredient\" that was so revolting I had to send the dish back and leave immediately.  Moving on from that memory, I sat and thought about my new life in San Francisco - I daydreamed about growing herbs in the courtyard outside my new apartment, imagined riding my Cruiser bicycle through the city, and pictured myself sipping wine with my boyfriend as the sun sets over the bay.    \n\nI'm not sure how long I sat there, lost in my own thought, but I was only shaken from my fantasy when the main course arrived; a simple and yet wholly satisfying dish of Maccaronara with tomato ragu and house-made ricotta salata.  Maccaronara is a hand made pasta that is long like spaghetti, however much thicker.  When cooked properly, it is chewy but not firm and easily wraps around a fork or spoon without splattering on one's crisp, white blouse.  After the pasta was gone, I sopped the remaining ragu with bread and left no trace that the bowl had ever come in contact with food.  \n\nNot wanting the feeling of elation to end, I opted to slow down my usually brisk New York pace by ordering a cappuccino and the chocolate budino tart.  Drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt, the bitterness of the chocolate tart reacted perfectly with the salt and sent me off into daydreams about whipping up a batch of my homemade dark chocolate turtles with fleur de sel.  \n\nI hope to visit SPQR soon, which is A16's Roman counterpart in Pacific Heights, where I hear the food is lovingly created by the same chef, Nate Appleman. Named after the Latin phrase Sentus Populusque Rmnus, which translates to The Senate and the People of Rome, I look forward to exploring more of Nate Appleman's food and, of course, more opportunities to slow down and let myself be inspired to daydream.", "author": "T.

It was soggy and burnt because the pizza was cooked too quickly, at too high of a heat.  \n\nWhen I complained, I was told they could cook me another, and if it turned out the same, no problem, they would just take care of it.

Apparently they've eaten there many times and the pizza is hit or miss - it depends on who's cooking the pizza that night.\n\nAt the caliber of restaurant, I would really expect much better.\n\n3 stars because I did have that amazing first meal, and the chicken meatballs were very tasty.

It was the worst eating experience of my life. In a nutshell: 3 hour wait for a tiny portion of disgusting oozing- with-oil Gnocci thats waaay overpriced. Now the details...\n\nWe called at 7:30 to reserve a table and were told that the wait would be for an hour. We arrived at 8:00, expecting to wait for a half hour and decided to hang out at the bar until we got our table.\n\nLittle did we know then that we wouldn't get our table until an astounding 10:30. Yes, 3 hours for a damn table. \n\n\" Well, why then didn't you up and leave and go elsewhere\"?? you may ask...\nBecause every half an hour when asked on the status of our table, we were told \"oh, just a half hour more\"... and this game went on until 10:30. I can understand they're busy that night, but in that case, shouldn't the staff give folks a more accurate estimate of the time involved. There's a huge difference between waiting an hour and waiting 3 hours. \n\nAs a side note - this place has the worst acoustics. Maybe its something about the cork type walls, but everything is really loud in there even though its not that big. Its like you're in a dive bar, screaming to the person next to you to be heard.\n\nAnd now for our main event. The pasta fiasco.\n\nI ordered the large portion of the Gnocci (all their pasta dishes come in two sizes). To be fair, my friends who recommended the place, said to try the pizza, which was what they ordered. But c'mon, I've driven all the way from the south bay to the snooty SF Marina District,  I gotta have something other than PIZZA - and so i went with the Gnocchi which sounded really appetizing on the menu. Another person in our group also got seduced into the Gnocci. Forget about ordering the steak or the main entrees cos that stuff is really expensive. \nSo anyways, my wife, myself, and two other people in our group went with pasta type dishes.\n\nBoy do they sucker you at this ripoff joint. \n\nThe portion size - SMALL. And i mean REALLY small for what you're paying. \n\nThe quality of the food- Disgusting. Dripping with oil and salt and no flavor. One of the guys at our table who was also seduced into ordering this dish didn't even finish it and proclaimed halfway through that he'd lost his appetite. It really was that bad.\n\nSo you're thinking, maybe its just the Gnocci. Well....... no. My wife had ordered another kind of pasta and a girl at the table ordered yet another type. All the pastas were sad and less than mediocre testing. Like someone dumped a couple of spoonfuls of Ragu sauce over spaghetti. \n\nEveryone gets hit with a bad restaurant now and then and I've had a few as well. But this is the first time, where I came away from a meal feeling robbed and hungry - after waiting for 3 hours to sit at the table. \n\nYou've been warned.\n\nOne extra star for the Pizza - my friends who ordered it did get a beautiful and unique looking pizza.

The creamiest, smoothest mozzarella I have ever had...it was like butta'.  Seriously.\nAside from the deliciousness that makes me drool as I write this...I thought we had all-around fantastic experience.  The hostesses were SO friendly....our table was waiting and sooo romantic (okay, I have to admit it: it was an anniversary dinner)...the sommelier came over and was incredibly helpful in adapting my French palate toward the Southern Italian varietals...our server let us take our time and linger...\nAnd, everything was sooo flavorful.  We had a pizza with pancetta and shared two small plates of pasta, a gnocchi, and another square-spaghetti that had been slow-roasted in pork and chicken broths.  (Forgive my lack of knowledge on pasta!)\nThe pizza was AWESOME (and I was resisting it)...thin crust, great ratio of real mozz cheese and fresh sauce, the gnocchi was okay (maybe a little hard?) and the spaghetti-type dish was out of this world--sooo tasty.  Meat flavored pasta without any large pieces of meat in the dish?  Probably a man's dream.  But I loved it too!\nAnd, the wine...awesome.  As I said earlier, the sommelier was fantastic (Kevin) and he suggested we split a glass of prosecco to start as we looked over the wine list...so smart!  And they waive a corkage fee if you buy one of their bottles...so yes, we had two.\nRegardless, overall, warmth and lighting were great, noise level a pleasant hum but no problem hearing across the table...laid-back atmosphere...\nI highly recommend you check it out.

Pizzeria Delfina wipes its ass with A16's menu.\n\nThe salad I had was probably the worst salad in a restaurant i've ever had, outside of maybe some diner in nebraska - lifeless, half-dead arugala (yes, much of it was yellow and pale) with lifeless but decent mushrooms and sad looking onions.\n\nThe Waitress was very knowledgeable about the thorough wine list, tho.  Recommended a decent dry fruity white, although not as good as Delfina's Muscato.  She was pretty good, i'll give her that.\n\nThe pizzas were basically lahore karahi's excellent garlic cheese naan bread, (not necessarily a bad thing) which isn't on the menu btw, whose toppings reminded me mostly of thai food (likely basil chicken even tho we had salsiccia) on top of said naan bread.  I feel I could have bought the two and put them together and had a better meal.\n\nThe pasta (that they have apparently had on the menu since they opened and was recommended) was a cross between a slightly fresher (and thicker) version of chef boyardee spaghetti and canned tomato sauce.  For $9.  For a half size.  As in the size of the palm of your hand.\n\nDessert?  Jello putting with sea salt and olive oil.  Wow.  Salt and oil on top of mediocre cheap tasting chocolate mouse.  You go gurl.  I want to rake all of my patrons over the coals and somehow make a business of it like this place.  Well, actually I don't but nice work if you can get it I suppose if that's your thing.  Want to know how they made the strawberry \"gelato\"?  Ground fruit roll-ups (with an extra teaspoon of organic white sugar for sophistication) and original capri-sun, flash frozen for your pleasure.  That will be $9, thank you.  Thank god we were there on an expense account.\n\nThis place takes \"I could make this at home!\" to a whole 'nother level, because, well, I actually could, which for the average San Francisco restaurant (which this place clearly is not) is saying alot.\n\nThe people who go here and think it's soooo amazing have obviously never been through the mission or other parts of town outside of the marina -- and by the looks of most of the clientele there, they obviously wouldn't be caught dead with restaurant staff with actual personality and the decor to match.", "author": "Ben H."}

The mains were chicken meatballs (2), the pork shoulder and the orecchiette with octopus. All were terrific except for the orecchiette.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-08-22", "description": "So I must say I've heard a boatload about this place. The buzz when it first opened was crazy. I was excited to finally try it for myself last night. My man and I where just across the street at the movies when we decided to check it out. The place was hoppn' for sure. The lady who greeted us made eye contact with me immediately and was quite upbeat when I asked what are chances were. I thought for sure we would need a reservation but to my surprise she said it would only be 20 to 30 minutes.  So we headed to the bar and started scrutinizing the wine list. Now here is where I must take a star off. The pages and pages of wine selections required some researched. I by no means consider myself an expert but I can usually feel quite comfortable getting through a list in almost any restaurant. This list was so esoteric and contained so many obscure wines I couldn't make heads or tails out of it. \nAfter selecting something safe (Draft beer) we were taken to our table. Again the lady who sat us gave us an option of a romantic table or two kitchen-side counter seats to watch the chefs. We selected the table but I though it was super nice to give us the option.\nThe menu had lots of options, which is always a plus. The octopus salad with cucumbers, cherry tomatoes and breadcrumbs was a little disappointing. The breadcrumb gave the dish a funny consistency and didn't add any flavor. The salsiccia pizza with fennel sausage, roasted peppers and red onions was fantastic. The crust was amazing. Finally the Chocolate budino tart with sea salt and extra virgin olive oil was out of this world. I could not stop talking about how perfect the savory/sweet combo was. \nThe service is the other star deduction. Personality was completely lacking. The service was somewhat attentive but I really don't know who got the tip. One person took the order, another brought our drinks, and another brought one course, yet another bought the second course. I believe in teamwork but it really made the experience sterile and impersonal. When I was figuring out the gratuity I thought to myself I hope this house 'pulls tips'.", "author": "Gina C."}

It would help if you can give me some details on the sauce, crust, cheese that you encountered when you went there.\n\nThe Pizza: Margherita\n\n1. Cheese - quite bland and tasteless. Not much of it.\n2. Sauce - Bright red, spread very thin on the pizza crust. Ok flavour, but needed more of it.\n3. Pizza crust (ie the entire round pizza base) - Closer to a pita bread than any pizza that I had tasted before. Most of it was paper thin, maybe 2mm thick. Not crispy at all, and when I picked up each slice, it hung down completely flaccid (sorry for the innuendo), and all of the toppings slid off onto the plate. The only way to eat it by hand was to roll it up like a mini burrito.  Significant parts of the rim and the underside of the crust were burnt. The dough didn't have much taste.\n\nOverall, I left feeling confused. Is this the great A16 pizza that everyone raves about or was I there on an unlucky night?

I thought the prices were way too high given the quality of the food (the pizza was soggy and uninspired and the entrees my table ordered were boring). As far as atmosphere goes, the servers were running around the place like a TGI Friday's - it seemed chaotic, loud and disorganized for what is supposed to be a high-end restaurant. What's even odder, is the pretension that the hostesses demonstrate in the front of the house. Normally that sort of thing doesn't bother me if the food and experience is worth it, but given the lack of quality and innovation here it's almost laughable.

*shrug*  that sure as heck was not an easy question.  my wife has always wanted to be taken out for a glitzy night on the town.  however, she's adamant about raising our boy as natural as possible, which means as much breastfeeding as possible.  those two things don't really mix; but you know... a husband's got to learn how to force water to mix with oil in this post.post.modern world, you know?  at times, my wife talked about having me find a place where we could bring our baby.  i tried to convince her to let my mom take care of him, while we enjoyed a romantic dinner.  however, yeah... there was the breastfeeding issue... so... well, in the end my mom told me to leave our son with her because i already needed to meet up with a client for my dj business in san francisco; so i explained that to my wife, and she was fine with the idea of going for a nice dinner.  still, i wasn't sure if she was going to back out of it, so i didn't make any actual reservation anywhere.  when i looked up romantic san francisco restaurants, i felt so out of it.  ten years ago, when we lived in berkeley and hung out in sf, i knew all the phreshest, phattest joints.  nowadays, whoa... everything was different.  where to go? *shrug* i was pretty screwed.\n\nwell, i feel so indebted to a16 because we stumbled upon on it.  the mobile opentable site was totally screwed up on that saturday because of all the guys who were frantically making last minute reservations, so i could only trust my animal instinct and head towards  the marina.  i knew i had seen a few french restaurants of interest out there.  anyway, we found a nice parking spot, and my wife had us start walking in the opposite direction of where i personally thought we should've been headed, but we walked right up to a16.  she looked at the menu and approved.  the only drawback at that point was the quoted, one.hour wait.  we ended up strolling around the chestnut street mall and browsing through baby clothes.\n\nwell, when we were finally seated, i discovered this place was worth the wait.  my wife started with a very creative salad.  good salads aren't as plentiful on menus in the winter months, even here in sunny california.  i started out with the tripe dish.  we loved both.  the tripe was nice and tender.  i suppose the tomatoes provided some acidity or something.  the dish was not overly complicated and, with the spice of the chili oil, actually reminded me a bit of chinese food... i guess it was in a \"good food is good food regardless of origin\" way.  my wife's salad was very creative, with these watermelon radishes.  these slices really looked like little watermelon slices.\n\nfor our entrees, my wife ordered a squid ink cavatelli with bacala, and i ordered a pizza with salsiccia and egg because 1) i saw many other people ordering pizzas, and 2) i wanted to have egg on pizza just as i had in one nice pizza place in d.c. a long time ago.  yeah, the pizza was delicious.  i like sausage pizza.  the rapini on there reminded me of kong ching chai (water celery) that you get at taiwanese restaurants.  what's with me and comparing italian food to asian food, eh? *shrug*  gee, well, i'm going to continue and say that my wife's cavatelli looked like buhndeigi and tasted like joraengi dduhk.  it was delicious.  man, i was thoroughly impressed with the creativeness of the menu.  also; wow, i don't remember san francisco portions ever being _this_ generous!  since i was stuffed, i let my wife pick the dessert on her own, and she chose this pumpkin hazelnut panna cotta dessert.  it was really delicious.\n\nthe decor and ambience of the place was very classy and hip.  it reminded us of a gastropub that my cousin showed us in manhattan.  the service _really_ stood out.  everyone was so polite and out to do a sincere good job.  i feel like i haven't experienced service as good as this recently at other restaurants of similar levels of  \"fanciness.\"  i don't know; maybe this place is just seriously out to impress or something.  i really liked how our waitress could pick out good wines for each of our dishes.  she was so on top of things even though the restaurant was so busy on this valentine's day eve saturday night.  wow.\n\nyeah, so i really feel that a 16 was the perfect venue for this now married.with.child couple to try to relive their \"carefree\" days back in the aughties; but that statement doesn't do them justice.", "author": "beno h."}

However after 3 parties arrived after me and were seated I started to wonder what was going on. I checked in at the desk again and was told 'oh, we didn't realize you were here, we thought you were late and were about to cancel your reservation'.    \n\nSo we're seated and we wait, and wait, and wait...before we get to order wine.  Meanwhile the couple who were seated next to us (and were one of those couples who arrived after us) were already finishing their appetizer.  \n\nOur drinks arrive, we order food and all is right in the world.  Our appetizer arrived (another rave for the roasted asparagus with walnut crema...and we also ordered proscuttio).  The proscuttio is a dream...melt in your mouth....but our enjoyment of it was slightly impaired by the fact that the staff kept wanting to take away our dishes. We had about a third of a plate of the proscuttio left...and we had our utensils in hand so I'm unclear why we looked like we were finished.\n\nFor my main entree I ordered the marinara pizza, which is described as having tomato sauce, olive oil, garlic and basil. I didn't expect the pizza to have 1 piece of basil (one leaf) in the middle of the pizza.  However the pizza was good. The sauce was tasty, the bread fresh and chewy/crispy at the same time.    My friends enjoyed their entrees.\n\nBut again, we were rushed with our plates.  Our table was large enough for us and our plates so I'm unsure why there was such a rush for clearing the table.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the 3 flavors of gelato.  I loved the pistachio and the strawberry swirl but the lemon flavour was a little too tart and salty for me....but perhaps others would really like it.  \n\nAll in all I'm not sure I would rush back to this restaurant. \nDrawbacks:\nSmall, crowded and very very loud.

While not reviewing alot on here we do get around to the SF food scene so of course have always known about their reputation, accolades, and focus on Campania and specifically pizza. Well last Sat after spending the morning at the Walt Disney Family Museum (which is great by the way), we were looking for a place to go and ended up here. We sat at the bar so never got to see the main dining area. So hearing so much about how the chef had studied in Italy to master the \"art\" of just making the dough, we had to go with at least one pizza, the funghi. Let me preface the rest of the review by saying that I love any pizza even the grease laden pizza at Sbarros at my local mall. That being said when it came out to our table I could immediately smell a hint of wood and freshly baked dough. I've always been more of a thick crust kind of guy but never shy away from thin.  So I was a little skeptical before even eating here. Well, while it looked very simple, the flavors were perfect with the most incredible crust. From texture to flavor, it spot on. The crusty bottom with the blackened blisters with their nice crunch, to the soft steamy inner core, has just the right touch of woodsy smoky flavor. We were told that it comes from the 800 degree oven that cooks the pizza in less then two minutes creating that perfect harmony of textures. I'm thinking that you throw any old topping on that and you'd have a great pizza. On top of the heavenly crust was the topping of roasted mushrooms, smoked mozzarella and arugala for a nice spicy punch, simple but just really nice flavors. Oh and did I mention the crust was the bomb? We also had the braised greens with spicy pork meatballs..uh,ok. nothing special but did have good hearty broth,  meatballs were a little bland for my taste.  Service was good sitting at the bar. All in all would definitely would come back for the pizza and certainly try other things off their menu.", "author": "David C."}

The guy at the front this time was nicer and we were sat down immediately. First they put me behind this brat that was WAILING! So I asked to be moved and moved as far away as possible, but you can still hear the kid... oh well. The cold cuts were still good. We got the assortment and the meats were still very good. I think this was the best thing of the night. We also decided to try the Salsiccia pizza with fennel sausage. The sausages had a very interesting texture and taste that reminded me of duck. Overall the pizza was actually pretty tasty and good but a little too salty. Which would be the theme for the entire night... For pasta we got the Tonnarelli with Ink Squid... this dish was a disappointment in my opinion... it was just salty and flavorless... too 1-dimensional for my taste. The noodles were cooked nicely but it wasn't anything memorable. I really like the pasta last time and this time I was hugely disappointed. We got their Meatballs and it's almost the EXACT same one I had 4 months ago. Kind of uninventive and this time it was gross. The meatball was plain and boring. It was just super super salty! I was not pleased with the flavor nor the sauce because it was just salty and flavorless. As I am writing this review I keep wavering btwn 2 or 3 stars... I told my sister I don't want to come back here anymore so I am going to have to lower it to 2 stars. It's about 2.5 stars because the Salumi platter and Pizza were good, but I detested the main courses... Maybe after some recovery time I will wonder back to this place...

I was in an angry, caustic, and very negative frame of mind.  I woke up this morning and realized there was probably a little too much vitriol in my review.  Today, being Friday, and I being in a much better mood will still give A-16 one star due to the poor service, but will remove the harsher elements of my review.  My girlfriend took me there for my birthday this last Wednesday.  After 20 minutes of being totally ignored (and sitting through an earthquake), we decided that we must be invisible.  The table next to us, which was closer to us than we were to one another due to the cramped seating layout, was served before us by our waitress.  The table on the other side was being fussed over by our waitress like a favorite child.  One of the chefs from Lark Creek Inn was seated at the table behind us after we were seated and was served before us.  Then there was the guy at the bar she was flirting with instead of acknowledging our presence.  Finally, a random wine steward took pity on us and decided to take our order for a bottle of wine.  We finally got bread and water (after we got wine) and were a bit concerned that might be all we get for dinner.  Our waitress randomly approached us, didn't even say hi, but did say, \"Oh, I totally love that wine.  We used to serve it by the glass, but don't anymore.  Are you ready to order.\"  Huh? I worked in the restaurant business for over 10 years.  When you have totally ignored a table for 20+ minutes, you don't walk up and make small talk.  You walk up and beg forgiveness.  Maybe treat the table to an appetizer.  In my not so humble opinion, a restaurant experiences its greatest success when you are made to feel like the guest of honor.

We recognized the bartender from a previous yelp outing and got the royal treatment: wine, appetizer, dessert on the house.  The mozzarella appetizer is mind-blowing.  I didn't know it could taste so good!  The octopus salad was well done; the octopus was tender and tasty.  They sent us over a free tuna salad and while my two yelper friends loved it, I thought it was really fishy.  I had a basil pasta with rock shrimp and a little kick that was totally unmemorable (I think I made this for dinner last weekend).  However, the other entrees were delicious: early girl tomato pizza with prosciutto and ricotta gnocchi.  The gnocchi were very unique and nothing like I'd ever tasted before.  Unfortunately, dessert was uneven as well.  The gelato was all right but tasted more like ice cream.  I ordered the panna cotta with figs and zucchini bread.  The panna cotta tasted sour and weird and the figs were too sweet.  I guess they were supposed to go together but I think elements of a dessert plated separately should hold up independently.  The zucchini bread was all right but my coworker's is better . . .  I would normally give this place three stars but our waiter and the sommelier were spectacular and the ambiance was stellar.

We ordered the calamari/squid ink pasta and a couple pizzas.  The pasta had absolutely no taste, had the texture of hard processed cheese and we mentioned this to our waitress.  Her response was to offer two thimble-sized cups of gelato at desert, to appease us.  They were so small that we couldn't use our spoons.  The pizzas had great crust but the toppings were what you would find in the frozen section of Safeway.  Seriously!  The bill came and it was $169 for four of us, which included a $38 bottle of wine that we felt forced to buy from them.

A16 is a trendy and pretty darn cool looking space in the Marina. It seems to be constantly filled with Marina files and \"Yipsters\". That's right. You heard it here first, Yipsters. A cross between a Yuppie and a Hipster.   A16 did hit a few high marks. The house cured meats for example. The Ciccioli (cured pork belly with fennel and olive oil) had a wonderful blend of savory and floral notes to it. In addition, the asparagus with pancetta, hazelnuts and pecorino was simple, elegant and delicious.  Another highlight was Shelley Lindgren's wine list. I was amazed by the amount of great Italian wines she had chosen to serve by the glass. It seemed as if almost every region and varietal of Italy was represented.  Probably the most disappointing part of the meal was the pizza. I had been excited to try Christophe Hille a certified pizzaiolo, rendition of the Campania pizza. I had the Romana pizza, actually I tried it twice in the same night. I ordered it with the addition of pancetta a wise choice I thought, it would accent the tomato, anchovies and calabrian chilies wonderfully. Unfortunately I was mistaken. When the pizza came it had huge chunks of pancetta lardons that were barley warmed by the specially made oven. In addition, the crust was burnt and soggy at the same time, now how does that happen? Don't get me wrong, I appreciate a well charred crust and I am even willing to eat half cooked pancetta, but I could not get over the soggy dough and the overly sweet sauce of the pizza. When asked by my server I told her my thoughts and she was extremely accommodating. She insisted that the pizza be taken back and re-fired. It was a gracious gesture and that alone helped make up for the sub-par pizza, but unfortunately the second pizza was just as bad.  So if you want good pizza try some other joint, but if you want to eat a few appetizers and drink some great wine A16 is a good spot for it.", "author": "Matthew R."}

And I looked forward to trying it again.  So I ate here tonight with the visiting parents, best friend, and her boyfriend.  Couldn't get a reservation, so we walked in early at 5:30  (my parents are very early folk), and were seated immediately.  But not in the main dining room, apparently you definitely need a reservation for that.  Started off with a little taste of an italian red and then we drank 2 bottles of another italian red.  I will never remember the names, especially since my dad ordered.  In fact, he did most of the ordering!  Appetizers for the table were mozzarella burrata with olive oil, sea salt and crostini (delicious and creamy, though I preferred the house bread to the crostini), roasted friarelli peppers with anchovies, Calabrian chiles, lemon and fried breadcrumbs (fantastic!  spicy, salty and delicious), zuppa of fresh butter beans, summer vegetables and spicy pork meatballs with basil and pecorino (loved, especially the meatballs), and a margherita pizza (yum, wood-oven baked).  Whew, after all that, can you believe we ordered mains!?!  My mom and I split (and my best friend ordered) the cavatelli with squash blossoms, zucchini, chiles, basil and grana padano.  This was very yummy, and not super heavy.  My dad ordered an appetizer size of the maccaronara with tomato ragu and house-made ricotta salata, which was good, but not memorable.  And my friend's boyfriend had the duroc pork chop with sausage, with a side of cannellini beans (yum!).  The sausage was DELICIOUS!  One of the best things I tried tonight.  Lastly, there was dessert.  Naturally.  5 people, that meant 4 desserts, each of which was equally yummy: yogurt panna cotta with buckwheat cookie, apples, and candied fennel, plum and hazelnut cake with hazelnut brittle and plum gelato, raspberry crostata di marmellata with figs, pistachios, and ricotta, and chocolate budino tart with sea salt and extra virgin olive oil.  I mean seriously, I felt like we ate the whole menu, and every thing was good.  However, I am only giving this restaurant 4 stars.  Why, you ask?  Because they were a little overly attentive.  You might be thinking, why is this a bad thing?  Because you don't want a server clearing your plates while someone else is still eating.  It makes the people who are finished feel like fatties, and the people who are still eating uncomfortable and rushed.  Poor form A16.  Let the people savor their food!

She timed our dinner perfectly. I'm surprised she's not working at some 5 star place. Anyway, so we walk in a few minutes early for a 10pm reservation, (we tried 9 but they were booked up). We got seated some 15 minutes after 10. While we waited on some barstools behind the hostess stand, we noticed the diverse selection of wines. I guess this place seems to be a meeting place, too. The bar was packed. The hostess saw that I was wearing a short skirt and sat us a a very tiny and cumbersome table smack in the center of the room with no privacy below the table top (girls, you know what I mean). I felt so awkward and exposed. Wishing to be moved I tried to get someone's attention as people whizzed by us and around us, over and over. I guess I wouldn't have minded it  if we were in a small pizza place and I was out for a casual slice in my jeans, but this was our big night out . And suddenly there she was, our wonderful waitress who didn't need much of an explanation to realize I wanted to move and she grabbed a busboy to set us up along the back wall (yeah!).Now to the food, I ordered a very nice citrus salad that was very good, my husband's octopus was very good, too. The main dishes were another story, however. They lacked taste, flavor and creativity. My Main dish of Rabbit was ok, It was cooked on wooden skewers and given a mediocre rubbing with some cheap herbs. I could've done better myself and that's not saying much. With all the hype about this place I expected better. My husband had a fish that was breaded. It was just that and no more. There was no interesting flavor or anything to justify the price...and the wait. We had a nice bottle of Vermentino and the check came out to just under 200$ with the tip. I don't mind paying for a nice dinner but this was just average. More hype than anything , I guess. It's a place to go so you can say you've been there, that's all. I won't be going back.", "author": "rosanna m."}

For some reason I forgot to write about this eatery until I saw it mentioned in Gourmet magazine. So I figured I'd throw in my two cents. We decided to get some food at A16 since it was cold out, we were hungry, and I had seen A16 in the eating San Francisco ad magazine for ages. We were seated relatively promptly in the back. Much to our misfortune, it was way in the back, by the exit and there was a splendid wind that made us very cold. The place was packed full of Marina blowhards and San Francisco elites. It wasn't my favorite crowd, but the food was wonderful. We each had a pasta dish that was original and well plated. The waiter had a great knowledge of wines, and spoke to us about some central coast favorites. Since I grew up on the central coast, this pleased me. All in all, the service was good, the food was great and the drinks were also wonderful. I have to say the fact we froze our asses off was unfortunate. The entire place should be the same temperature in my opinion. But I'm a nerd, not a doctor...er architect.", "author": "Erik U."}

They sat us in back on the covered patio, which was nice and semi-private.  We had reservations for 9 and they didn't seat us until 9:30, but that's how long it took the bf to find parking anyway.  I was worried there would be a strong Marina vibe, but there turned out to be all sorts of people there and we had a great time.  Our server was AWESOME--recommended some good wines (though he didn't warn us the first needed like 15 minutes to open up, and we needed some wine PRONTO), was really patient with our slow decision making, and was friendly and informative.  And my friend brought a cake, and A16 handled it perfectly--they refrigerated it for us while we had dinner, then cut and served it for us, washed the serving dish we had brought, and boxed up the leftovers.  We split a couple orders of the amazing burrata, a couple people had the meatballs, a couple had a pizza, I had a pasta, and the bf had pork, and I think we all really enjoyed our dishes and had a fun dinner overall.  They didn't rush us out even though we stayed until midnight chatting.  Now my parents can't wait to go, and I hope they bring me with them!", "author": "Gina K."}

Came here with a bunch of girls for the start of my girls night out since the fiancee is out of town for his bachelor party. If I could only write one sentence reviews my review would say ORDER THE BURRATA. Seriously, it's heaven. It was creamy and fresh and tasted like butter in the best way possible, do not miss this dish. It was amazing. We also had the prosciutto and it was also delicious, ordered with the burrata, the two complemented each other quite well. I am a fan of simple pastas so I got the maccaronara with tomato ragu and homemade ricotta salata that was really good, the pasta itself was cooked perfectly al dente and my only minor complaint was that the dish seemed a little oversalted. I had a taste of my friend's gnocchi which was really good, the gnocchi were really plump and soft and had a really good finish to them. We got the semifredo for dessert on the waiter's recommendation and while good it was not particularly special.

We started out with the mozzarrella burata, which was delcious- the cheese was SO fresh and the sea salt/olive oil was a nice touch. My salsiccia pizza was huge- could have shared it with 1 other person. The fennel sausage added nice spice to it- my dish was the best on the table. My two friends both ordered gnocchi- it had no flavor and was not melt-in-your mouth, the way gnochhi could be.The semifreddo dessert was fine- nothing spectacular.

(maybe i'm more of a diva than i think? hmm.) we started with the arugula salad- delightful though a touch salty. i happen to adore salt, so it didn't bother me at all, but if you are salt sensitive, you might want to choose another option. we also had the prosciutto tasting- oh.my.god. if you like prosciutto, even just a little, you have to try this. the only downside of the tasting was that the american prosciutto (similar to what you get in most stores) was so clearly inferior to the italian version, i may be ruined forever. le sigh. \non to our entrees- we tried a pizza- delightful thin crust- and the lamb crespelle (crepes). outstanding. seriously. i had to remind myself to relax and enjoy the meal, and not continue to shove it in my mouth as fast as possible. to borrow the favorite phrase of a certain loud-mouthed food network host - yum-o. a16 was absolutely worth the trek to the marina- and that's a huge compliment in my book.", "author": "oona m."}

Served with ciabatta toast this dish is simple yet satisfying appetizer. The eggplant parm has a great element of freshness that combines the texture of the eggplant with sweetness of the earl girl tomatoes and the salty smokeyness of proscuitto. Moving on, the main courses aren't as consistent. The Maccaronara is pretty standard. i.e a fancy name for a dish that is very  comparable to spaghetti. The Bucatini with clams was slighly disspointing as my noodles were a little more than al dente, which is fine if you like it still crunchy in the middle. What really stands out are the beef short ribs and the polenta when they offer it. The ribs are tender and posess a rich tomato flavor. The broth is thick and full of flavor that has been imparted by the slow cooking process.

This place is great and there should be more places like it since you have to wait a month to get a decent reservation.  It is a reasonable price point for dinner which does not really exist here.  Sometimes you just want an easy night out, and this concept could be it.  The dishes are good and reasonable.  The wine list is a bit overpriced, but extensive.  I thought everything I had was good, but not wait a month for a reservation good.  The eggplant app was my favorite, but all in all, they make very good pastas and the pizzas are pretty tasty too.  Either SF on the whole needs to create more places like this, or people need to find somewhere else to hype about so that I can get in here a lot easier.

Now I understand why it's so hard to get in!  Although I usually hate eating dinner this late, I couldn't resist trying a little bit of everything off the menu.  We asked the waitress for suggestions and luckily she picked out all the ones we were eyeing.  We started with the Margherita pizza and mozzarella burrata.  The fresh mozzarella was very delicious, I would recommend it to anyone.  The Margherita pizza was also just as good, although the crust was a tad thick for a \"thin crust pizza\".  We also shared the Maccaronara and the Braised Beef short rib.  As soon as they served the two dishes on our table, you can detect the fragrant aroma of the dishes.  I just wanted to sit there and smell the dishes, taking in all of it.  Oh wait, I did do that!  The waitress even came back and asked if everything was alright.  Of course everything was alright, it all smelled so good!  The Maccaronara was kind of average, but you definitely appreciate the fresh flavors.  The Braised Beef short rib aroma brought back memories of one of my favorite dishes that mom used to make.  And equally to my delight, it was just as scrumptious.  We ended the night initially a tad disappointed that they had sold out of three of the desserts.  However, the honey panna cotta satisfied our sweet tooth. I love eating family style.

Our first few dishes arrived promptly but then it took a full hour (yes, 60 minutes) before our main course (and wine) arrived.  All around us other tables were being seated, served and bill settled while we waited.  Our server was nowhere to be found and then swept by and offered a complimentary half glass of wine to compensate for the wait.  That would have been lovely except that, when the check arrived, we had been charged for it.

Make a reservation and just be patient if you have to wait another 20 minutes.  Enjoy a glass from their amazing Southern Italian wine list.  The bar staff is super-knowledgeable and can guide you to a wine that might make your new favorites list.  The ingredients here are all fresh, mostly prepared in-house, and the purity of the dishes shows A16's devotion to old-world techniques.  The menu is a seasonally-changing delight every time I go.  Most recently, I had a fresh Sardine appetizer that I can't stop thinking about.  So simple, light and full of flavor.  The burrata mozzarella melts in your mouth and tastes of creamy freshness.  The Napolitan style pizzas are the real deal, like I ate all along the Amalfi coast, with few ingredients, purposefully chosen and perfectly baked in their wood oven.  The homemade gnocchi are bites of heavenly bliss.  I've had them in a few different preparations - all wonderful.  My meat-eating guests always rave about the house-cured salumis and the pork chops.  Don't be shy - if you don't know what something is (much of the menu includes Italian names for things), just ask.  The servers love to share their wealth of information and help you select items you will truly enjoy.  I can't forget to mention desert.

The ricotta wrapped in swiss chard was delicious (involtini). The service was wonderful, though the late night crowd can be a tad loud.  My second experience was a let down. I went for lunch and ordered pizza. The waitress was not polite and we were not impressed.  I would still go back for dinner because there is a longer more detailed, and changing menu.", "author": "Lisa J."}

Last night, I witnessed a grown man, (a friend of mine) have a temper tantrum because we got turned away from several rests. in the Marina because the kitchen was closed and there was no food but Pizza Orgasmica to be found.  He refused to resort to that and would rather feed on beers until I suggested heading over to A-16.  At first we were told that they had stopped serving food, (it was around 10:30ish at this point) but there was a very kind man behind the bar who realized that my friend was about to pass out from hunger.  He got us a table right away and even told us to relax and take our time with ordering our food. The service was exceptional, (they never rushed us at any point in the night and even let us drink our wine at the 11th hour while they were closing). The food was really good and even though we made some additions to our order, (like extra mushrooms on the side), the kitchen did not mess it up.  The vino (I don't know my Italian wines like I know my Italian men) are really impressive there.  So, when your stomach starts growling late into the night, head over to A-16 for some delicious food and a cool wait staff as well.", "author": "Stacia F."}

We had no idea it was so big until we walked to the back area. The ambiance is pretty cool - modern but cozy feel, wine was good, and pizzas were great! Not too oily, interesting varieties and combinations of ingredients - really yummy crust - very good overall. I'd definitely come back here for the pizza. The only thing lacking was the dessert. We got this chocolate tart situation - which had olive oil and sea salt on top .... who does that to chocolate honestly. Totally ruined the taste of the tart - we thought it might be an interesting combination initially and the waiter highly recommended it - but it was so weird! Definitely not an enjoyable way to end the meal. We also got another dessert which was kind of tiramisu-ish which was pretty good though - so I'm thinking this chocolate salt tart business might have just been a bad call on the part of the chef. Overall - really cute place, and they let us hang out there til like 130 am which was nice too. I'd come back again.", "author": "Anjali M."}

She was at best snooty and at her worse she talked down to us, even after I explained that we were from the Old Country and that I was in the gourmet food business. And all because she did not really know what an Insalata Treviso was.

The thin crust mushroom pizza was scorched on the edges like it should be, and it also managed to stay deliciously chewy, the amount of sauce and cheese was perfect, but there were a few too many enoki mushrooms for my liking. The pizza was surprisingly good value, unlike the wine - a glass sets you back more than a whole pizza. I tried four different Italian wines between $12 and $16 per glass and although they were not awful, they should have cost that per bottle.

With a quintessential California/Italian Fusion cuisine A16 is definitely reminiscent to Zinzino, which actually occupied the same location during the mid to late 90's. Genuine wood fired pizza along with hand made pasta makes A16 a very sought after spot; precisely why I can only give four out of five stars. A16 is very difficult to get a table at, perhaps its reputation, perhaps it has to do with lack of space, nothing you can do about that, or maybe it has to do with the fact that the wait staff is far more interested in the guests having a good time then in moving people from appetizer, to entree, to dessert in record time, whatever the reason is, it is in fact very hard to get a table and often if you just sort of \"show up\" you may have to wait as long as an hour and a half for an open table...

Instead, they tried to be more sophisticated than they are and serve things like crab meatballs and lasagna with unmelted cheese with some random cardboard-like truffles.  Plus, it was $120/person for the food and an additional $75 for the wine pairing.

It was a warm night so it was a bit warm at our seats, but no unbearable.\nI like the idea that they do things simply...not too many different flavors in one dish and no flavors that overpower the main ingredient(s) which a lot of restaurants try to do. And, of course, I love the idea that they have their own organic garden for much of their produce. \nOverall, however, my boyfriend and I were not blown away by the food. My grilled pork (kebob style) was a little too chewy and gristly and my boyfriend's chicken was nothing out of the ordinary. \nThe service was great...our waitress had wonderfully reasonable suggestions for wine.

Funhi pizza had great flavor but the crust was so tender it was mushy. Ricotta gnocchi were very good, the mushroom just jumped out at you with flavor.  Butternut nut squash with pine nuts and currents were excellent.  Chocolate tart with olive oil and sea salt was nice with a very flaky chocolate crust but TOO MUCH salt.  Once I got home I must have drank a 1/2 gallon of water due to the over salting of the foods ( I haven't had this happen to me in years).

After the SF Chronicle Magazine listed it as one of the Top 100 Restaurants in the Bay Area, I agreed to go to dinner here with a group of girlfriends.  Bad idea.  Two of the people in our party of four showed up on time, but were told that our reservation would be cancelled if the rest of us were not there within 15 minutes of the reservation time.  Even though we were on our way.  I understand the need for people to be on time, but if you don't have valet parking, you should give a little lee-way - and be willing to seat the people who are there and willing to pay for your overpriced food.  Tables were way too close together - making it difficult to have a conversation, or make it to the restroom without a waiter rudely hitting you with their serving trays.  We ordered some artichoke/tuna appetizer (I think that's what it was) which was not edible as far as I was concerned.  Their famed pizza arrived at our table greasy and basically cold.  Gnocchi was decent, but nothing memorable.  The chocolate desserts were pretty good.  The service , however, was HORRIBLE.  The person who sat us had a strange staring problem, and the person clearing the table tried no less than four times to take away my plate while I was still eating from it.  The only excellent parts of the evening were my fellow eating companions, and the nice bottle of champagne we ordered.  Given the number of amazing restaurants in SF, I am absolutely shocked that this restaurant is ever recommended as a good place to go.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

I had been to A16 before and had a so-so time with each visit--but I went there to celebrate a birthday this weekend and IT WAS TERRIBLE.  The staff--with the exception of the general manager, who was quite polite and horrified when we exited by handing her our comments about the evening so she would be sure to know how we felt--was extremely unengaged and unfriendly.  Too bad they did not know that they were serving a television producer of a morning show out scouting San Francisco restaurants and an attorney who sits on three boards in town!  They couldn't be bothered.  Bad table, bad attitude, tons of noise in the back room (which sounded like an echo chamber) and the food was overwrought and--sorry--not good.  My \"special sausage\" was dry and too spicy--Bruce Aidells makes a better sausage for a lot less money!  It was too-too-too...thus leaving us feeling like we should have gone to HOLY GRILL for a burger instead and saved the $600.00.  What a waste.  I will NEVER GO TO A16 again and i strongly urge you all not to fall prey to the press on this place.  It is not good, believe me--save yourself the money and go somewhere where you can hear your dinner companions, the staff is welcoming, and the food is inspired and tasty.  That is not A16.", "author": "sheila s."}

I also heard it was one of the top ten or top hundred restaurants in the bay area. I love food especially Italian and French cuisine. This is the first time I have written a review on a restaurant because I can't take all the bad food out there and I need to vent. My wife went in first to get a table and this night there were plenty of tables but the hostess took her back to the counter area and didn't ask if she wanted a table or not. We changed to a table in the addition area with lots of heat come down. Our waitress for the night was very nice. The first item we had was sardines which was less than average. The next course we had was the famous meatballs and a dish of gnocci. The meatball was bad and didn't taste like there was much meat in there. The gnocci was ok and nothing to rave about. The entrees we had were the beef braciole which was good, but the worst dish was the petrale sole with pistachio and other spice I forgot. The flavor was so bad it ruined the sole completely. Don't people taste their recipes before they put it on the menu. We were so bumed out that we didn't even try dessert. I go out and pay good money for good food and I have been disappointed so many times that it's hard for us to try new places. These days people listen to critics like the pipe piper. WAKE UP and smell the food!", "author": "chris n."}

I finally got one on a Thrus at 10pm and went with a friend of mine after a wine tasting event.  We ordered a carafe of red wine, a san giovese, syrah, barolo blend that was quite interesting.  In fact they have a lot of unique wines on their ine list.  For dinner we shared squid ink pasta with calamari and lamb crespelle with a side of romano beans with anchovies and lemon.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente with a good dose of garlic and a nice amount of calamari.  The crespelle were delicious and very flavorful.  The only thing i did not like were the beans which were mushy and a bit too fishy. This place has a good atmosphere and ambience including a nice patio. The food is traditional and authentic italian but instead of run of the mill dishes the items on the menu are unique &  well executed.  I look forward to going back again sometime", "author": "Melanie -."}

I've never actually looked at the yelp reviews for this place until just now....wow, I'm surprised how many bad reviews there are!  Especially surprised at all of the reverse snobs out there!  So what if it's a yuppie place--get the fuck over it and eat!  Anyways, that said, my meal/wine/service were excellent.  We didn't have a reservation, so actually used our intelligence, got there early (around 5:45), and sat at the bar.  The bartender and barback were both nice and attentive--we never had to wait long for anything, despite the fact that it was a very busy Sat. night.  I was unfamiliar with almost all of the wines, but the bartender made some excellent suggestions, and was also extremely generous with pouring tastes to try!  The fennel sausage pizza was excellent and crispy, with some lovely charred bits, and not at all greasy.  The maccaronara pasta was perfectly al dente...and the hazelnut semifreddo outstanding (although, and I don't want to admit it, my boyfriend's chocolate budino enhanced with a little olive oil and sea salt was just a little better).  The bartender was also very generous with the dessert wines....how could I possibly leave unhappy?  While there, we decided that the bar was definitely the place to be--such good people watching and eavesdropping opportunities, and once the Marina snobs get a little toasted on all the booze, they are actually pretty human!  Will definitely go back ASAP!", "author": "colette m."}

I can't bring myself to give it 5 stars as the waitstaff is spotty at times.  And not their fault usually, it just seems like they always have too many tables to take care of, but once you do finally get their attention they are great!  I also think the sommelier and bartenders are fantastic, especially with my lack of knowlege on Italian wines.  They always seem to come up with the perfect choice.  Now...for the food.  I'd go for the pizza and pasta hands down.  The macaronara is to die for and the gnocchi's are amazing.  I love that they have seasonal sides and appetizers.  I still dream of a whole roasted fava bean special they have in the spring.  This is my go to place with out of towners since the atmosphere is really nice, but not overwhelmingly so.  It still seems to hold on to a certain casual, neighborhood restaurant feel.  And I know, the wait is long, but grab a glass of wine from the great bartenders (who recognize you if you go often!) and relax.  It's worth it and it always seems like they're faster than the time they give.", "author": "L P."}
