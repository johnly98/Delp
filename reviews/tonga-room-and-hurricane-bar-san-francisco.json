We went there on Sunday night to stop for quick drinks. \n \nThe design and the ambiance of this place is phenomenal. The first thing to catch my eyes was that there was a live band floating on the pool area which can't be found at other lounges in San Francisco. \nThey have very cute cozy, tropical themed bar that serves really cool drinks with fake coconuts and tiki cups. \n\nIf you weren't here for dinner, you could grab a drink and swing on the side of the pool, and imagine you are dancing in the beach. \nOf course, don't get dizzy with the fantastic ambiance and jump into the pool.  The warning sign just drag you back to the reality.\n\nThe drinks are delicious and interesting.\n\nOrdered:\nAdult Swim: super refreshing!!\nTonga Kong: A little bit strong, tastes pretty good with coffee liquor. \n\nGreat place for a date or casual hangout.", "author": "Regina W."}

I knew it would be an expensive night based on reviews so I anticipated spending around $100.   Think of it as an experience though.   What other place in the Bay Area area has a floating band stage?  Think of the ambience too, a wonderfully decorated tiki bar with lightning, thunder and rain (over the pool area, don't worry you won't get wet).  \n\nWe went on a Saturday night and  was told the dining area wait was 2 hours and the bar area was 1 hour.  Kind of surprising but there are no reservations for parties under 10.  I put my name down for first available and was lucky enough to not have to wait an entire hour and had an excellent table in the bar with a perfect view of the stage.   Shout out to hostess Jennifer who was very accommodating.  I ordered the Tonga Kong cocktail and the miso salmon.  Both were soooo good!  The cocktail was strong which it better be for the price right?  \n\nThe service was great, the food came fairly quickly for how busy it was and the atmosphere was unforgettable.   I walked out spending $80 which included the $15 cover for the band and tax and tip.  This will definitely be a once in a blue moon excursion for me but well worth it.", "author": "Misty D."}

And also to get a table it's $10 a person just to sit down. Having six people in our party we decided not to get a table and just grab some drinks from the bar. There's plenty room to stand here the atmosphere is super cool with a dance floor an unswimmable swimming pool with an island in the Middle where a band was playing. Every once in a while you'd hear thunder and lightning and a bunch of water or fake rain would spray down from the ceiling pretty cool. Around and drinks for 6 people ran Us $124 minus tip. Pretty pricey so we decided to just stay for one round.\n\nWe sampled the mai tai, the spice killer, the adult swim, and the jungle bird. All the drinks were fruity delicious.

And oh. my. gosh. Tonga Room was even more amazing than I had imagined.\n\nTo find Tonga Room, you can enter the main lobby of the Fairmont hotel, go to elevator and go to level \"T.\"  From there, you will find it at the end of the hallway. I was wowed as I entered this incredibly beautiful hotel adorned with chandeliers, decorative furniture, and high ceilings.  \n\nUpon finding Tonga Room, I was pleasantly surprised to arrive on a Thursday night at 7:30pm with one friend and be seated immediately.  We were seated against the wall but still had a great view of the space.  The walls are a retro fabric wallpaper and the place is tiki themed from floor to ceiling.  The floors are an amazing botanical carpet, the tables and chairs are comfortable and wooden.  There are wooden carved poles on display everywhere, with lanterns hanging from pole to pole, there are boats hanging from the ceiling, and the room is dimly lit with candles on each table.\n\nThe star of the show is truly the blue pool in the center of the room with the floating tiki boat. Every 20 minutes or so, there is a rainstorm with real water coming down and the sound of thunder.  It is intoxicating and exciting.  The whole vibe of this place is seriously amazing, not a detail is missed.  \n\nI didn't eat here so I can't comment on the food but they have any awesome drink menu with mostly rum cocktails.  The drinks are a bit on the expensive side starting at $15 on up.  I appreciate how they mark the drinks with skulls and tallies.  The skulls represent how strong the cocktail is and the tallies, how sweet.  It really makes picking a drink easy.  I had the Jungle bird and my friend tried the Mai Tai and the Fog Cutter.  We were both pleased with our drinks and they were definitely strong.\n\nOn the floating boat, there was a cover band playing, which was fun.  $10 per person gets added to your tab for being there during the band but it's enjoyable and really adds to the experience.  Really, I'd like to see a surf rock band play here, or karaoke would be fun.\n\nI am so excited that I finally got to try Tonga Bar out.  It is on my list of favorite bars I've ever visited.", "author": "Annie M."}

To get table service, it was an additional $15 per person since they had live music, so we opted for standing room only.\n\nIt took us a while to get drinks, which was expected, and drinks were expensive, also as expected. Inside the bar it was small and dingy. What looked like an extravagant pool on social media was a small pool of water in the middle of the room. It was underwhelming to say the least.\n\nEveryone in my group agreed that the live entertainment was the best part. You could tell the band were not professionals, but we enjoyed a few of their songs. \n\nAlso to note, seemed like an older crowd getting down in this place...our group was in our late twenties and early thirties and we felt wayyyy too young.

It was honestly our \"Plan B\" for the tiki bar adventure 'cause I'd already been here about 6 years ago with my aunt and uncle, but my fianc\u00e9 always had it on his wishlist as a destination. \nWe had already read up on previous reviews, and from my experience years ago, we didn't have high expectations. We couldn't make reservations 'cause that's a privilege for the Fairmont Hotel guests, so we went early (shortly after getting denied access to another tiki bar 'cause they posted a last minute private event). My group was there about 30-45 minutes before opening time, and were one of the first there. Once the hostesses opened up, they asked if we were there for Happy Hour, and BAM! We're seated. Lesson of this: Be there early! \nNo joke that 15 minutes after getting seated, the bar was crowded along with seating. Y'all should also look over the menu, so you can order as soon as your server introduces himself with glasses of water. That's if you're in a rush. \nThe setting definitely makes our Vegas tiki bars look like small, adult playgrounds, so it's picturesque for the tiki aficionados. The tiki mugs and other souvenirs are on the expensive side as well, but I guess it wouldn't matter if you're a hardcore collector. LOL. It even made my fianc\u00e9 feel slightly deterred, so my sister and brother-in-law bought him the Boat Bowl for about $55 (includes tax) as a present for being such a great sport during the trip. \nTaking advantage of Happy Hour, we ordered about 7 tiki drinks and 2 Pupu Platters (3-4 pieces of about 4 different appetizers). Total came out to be around $200 (excluding gratuity).", "author": "Agnes S."}

Located in the ever swanky Fairmont Hotel, the Tonga room is a legit relic of Tiki goodness. What used to be a pool was converted to a themed bar in the '40s and seems rather largely unchanged since. It's a pretty wild set up, the likes of which you tend to see in a Disney setting. They float a raft on the lagoon pool to situate live music, and there's even a 'rain' effect that comes and goes over the water for all of your instagram needs.\n\nI came here exactly at 5pm open on a Friday night and it was already pretty packed. We got a table at the bar and ended up next to an elder couple who were told they had to wait at the bar for a half hour before being seated to eat dinner (!? kinda weird, considering the place JUST opened...) but that was fine because they were sweet and ended up buying our first round of drinks out of the kindness of their hearts (thank you!!!). The drinks themselves were lovely and tasty. At around $15~ mark they're what I expected, tiny umbrella and wedge of pineapple kind of presentations but in normal highball glasses. I had the Spice Killer and the Tonga Kong and both were genuinely great. Strong and sweet as promised. \n\nWe considered dining but ended up deciding against it due to a couple of reasons. Beware- there's a fee to be seated at any table (a set price for the live music), and the food prices are on the expensive side in general ($25 ~ $30 entrees). There's also apparently a wait whether you get there on time or not (and no reservations under a party of nine or something?)

It's a place for people to have a sort of island experience without leaving the mainland. But to me, it was a tacky, overpriced experience and I'm glad I only paid for one drink. The two stars are because the drinks are strong. But my drink became bitter after a few minutes because the lime thrown in it was not ripe at all.\n\nThe food consisted of East Asian and Southeast Asian food thrown on an uninspired, and definitely not authentic menu. We ordered the Pupu platter, garlic asparagus, fried rice, and 48 hr Korean short rib. Read the rest if you want to read the details of what is probably one of the worst meals I've ever had.\n\nFor $39, the pupu platter came with oily egg rolls, overdone chicken wings that tasted like frozen section reheated food, kalua pork rolls, breaded skewered coconut shrimp, and ahi tuna poke tostadas. The pork rolls are okay, the coconut shrimp was made well, and so were the tostadas, though it's really hard to mess up raw tuna. Asparagus tasted like burned oil. Fried rice was bland. I regret even putting the \"short rib\" in my mouth because the texture of it was super unpleasant. It was too soft, like it disintegrated as I chewed it. Like what happens if you marinate meat in lime for too long. It wasn't for me. The entire dinner for 2 cost $150 (with a drink for two.) To me, eating here was not worth it, but if you have money to blow go right ahead.", "author": "Melanie F."}

The atmosphere is very nice, it gives a feel of being outdoors, very relaxing.\n\nMy date got a little lost first while trying to find the bar. It is actually located inside the Fairmont hotel.

Once we went, we couldnt find a parking spot and didn't want to spend a lot on parking lot, other time we found parking, went over to see that the bar had been booked for an event and we couldn't enter. Third time was the charm! It was our wedding anniversary and we drove down at 6 pm, hoping to catch the happy hour there. It was a weekday, yet the place was quite packed. You can't make reservations through phone, once you get there, you can put your name down on a list and get texted once your table is ready. Once you receive your text, you have 10 minutes until your table is gone. \n\nWhen we went, there was an hour wait. We were told that we could wait at the bar until the table was ready. The bar was a sweet surprise. No bar stools, no cramped up area. In fact, the bar was quite an open area where we could hang out. It was open to one side of the water pool in the center and the happy hour was still on! The drinks here are pretty potent and very tropical, just as we expected from a tiki bar. The happy hour prices were the best part, we got cocktails, each for $10. We had almost 5 drinks and then got he table. There was a little disappointment here. I had requested the server to give us a table on the water side since it was our anniversary. She said all the water side tables are reserved for hotel guests. Mostly all tables were empty and we were given a table quite away from the water front, which was a little sad. We ordered food, it was average.\n\nAt 8:30 pm, live music started and really set the atmosphere up! Its a lovely place for a nice evening with some strong drinks and nice tiki bar feel. Will definitely go back here, specially to enjoy the happy hour while we wait for a table :)", "author": "Roma M."}

At the time they had a booth set up with some champagne. \n\nAnyways we walked around trying to figure out how to get to the Tonga room. With some help of the inter webs, we managed to find our way downstairs into its secret hiding spot. We got there about 45 minutes earlier, but we were glad we did because a long line formed rather quickly. I found it funny though because people were coming into the line already holding drinks. They were pregaming haha. \n\nSo got in and we're seated in the front half of the room because towards the back was for dinner service. But we only stayed for happy hour. Boyyyy it was PACKED! Thank goodness we were the first ones in the line though because we got a table while other people in the back of line had to pack around the bar. The place itself was awesome. Loved the theme and the water feature. \n\nFor drinks and apps we ordered, something along the lines of someone walking into the luau. I can't really remember the name and something Kong lol sorry I can't remember the names right now. But the thinks we're pretty solid. They packed a punch for sure. We shared the drinks between three people and they got us in a good place. Mhm. We also ordered some spicy chili edamame and calamari. They were delicious.

Interesting business model for a restaurant.. It doesn't seem that they have problems getting people in so they're definitely getting away with it but shouldn't the cover be for people not dining? I dunno for sure.\n\nAtmosphere - it's like.. OK. It's cool looking all luao pirate themed or whatever but it feels a little gimmicky. I felt like i was at a 10 year old's birthday party at an arcade or something like i straight up thought a magician or some shit would pop out of one of the corners. \n\nFood - Oh dear lord. It was so disgusting... like actually some of the worst food i've had in my life. I do have a good number of negative reviews on my yelp page but this manages to trump all of them in terms of how bad it was. AND it was one of the most expensive places I've been! This is like the epitome of the SF bouj \"fancy\" places with terrible food.\n\nOk so everything was covered in syrup. When I say syrup, i mean like... when you pick up anything it feels like you picked up a waffle covered in maple syrup. that's how sticky your fingers become. It's got that glaze that is popular at shitty chinese restaurants but somehow it tastes significantly worse.\n\nA friend of mine got lemon chicken. Oh my god, legit one of the worst things I've had. Have you ever had the lemon loaf pound cake at starbucks? Imagine that but the taste of the frosting on it... and now cover a piece of dry chicken in syrup with that exact taste. IT WAS SO BAD omg. i had half a bite and wanted to die.\n\nThe best thing we got was on the appetizer tray thingy and it was a spring roll. It tasted like it was premade and delivered frozen.. but somehow it is worse than shitty chinese restaurant spring rolls which are definitely pre-made and frozen. Me and a friend shared the wings, and they were really dry and sticky as well. The dipping sauce (tomato based) for the wings was not bad.\n\nIf you are in SF and think about coming here I PLEASE URGE YOU DO NOT GO HERE. There's so much better food in San Francisco for little a fraction the price.

They do not have any chairs/stools located around their bar.  \n\nThere is a stage in the pool for a live band to play.  Typically they start at 8:15pm nightly.  Make sure to take you drink over to the railing overlooking the pool.  Ever 30 minutes a rain storm happens for 2 minutes on the outskirts of the pool.

I've always wanted to come here, being half Tongan I remember my mom wanting to go with the family when we were younger but for whatever reasons we were never able to bring her here. Now more than ever I decided why not life's way to short and with pure luck of staying at the Fairmont for the weekend it was fate!  I have to say my initial thought if the tonga room was it would be tropical, reminiscent of the islands and that the cuisine would be island food. We arrived promptly at 5pm (opening time) because the hotel priority reservation was already booked. The hotel advised us to show up before opening and asked to be seated at the first come first serve. That's what we did and we are able to have a quick complimentary wine and cheese snack from the hotel and we were notified that our seats were available within 15 mins. Ok so brace yourself as you walk in it feel like you are stepping into a mini island. The decorations and vibe is so islander and it's almost as if you escaped to the friendly island of Tonga  we were warmly greeted by our hostess that took us to our seat by the water and boat (where live music is played.) I loved the whole scene, the water, palm trees and rain every 30 mins was so soothing. The bad starts from 8pm till midnight and I thought they were great, however it's an island place it would have been great to here more island music instead of 80's band covers but good none the less. Now on the the service and the food, that is the reason for my rating. The service felt rushed and if you know anything about be islands nothing is rushed and your always greeted warmly. We received rushed treatment and the greetings were mediocre. The food was total Asian fusion with pork being the only Polynesian cuisine? As an islander I felt that they could add more Polynesian cuisine to their menu to get the whole experience. In our culture food is love. We show our appreciation for every event or holiday with food and this food was really over priced and not great tasting. The drinks however were great. I would advise eating elsewhere and coming for the drinks and scenery. It's really such a beautiful place to be lacking the island spirit and island cuisine. Would I come back? For the scenery, drinks and if they switched the music genre yes, for the food no. It's really a beautifully decorated place and a must stop site see if your ever in SF!", "author": "Maya A."}

On one hand, this place has a lot of neat charm, like being inside a Disney ride with the thunder, rain, and kitschy decor, but the prices are horrible and definitely not upfront.\n\nOur problems started because we asked the hostess if there were any vegan options on the menu. A manager overheard us and said that they would sub tofu for meat in a dish, and we were assured that they could accommodate us. Once seated, we told that the server had spoken to the manager and was aware of our dietary needs. So, we each ordered stir fried veggies without the normal oyster sauce, and the server asked if we wanted the tofu in it, so we said yes. At no time were we told that this would be an upcharge. OH but what an upcharge it was! Not only we were charged the full $20 for stir fried veggies, but we were charged $10 extra for a bit of tofu added. EACH. Each plate of veggie and tofu cost $30! This was more than most of the meat dishes on the menu, and absolutely not how we were presented in the beginning. \n\nEven with the cute atmosphere, this was insane.

I have to admit- of places I've been to in Bay Area - including Trader Vic's, Smuggler's Cove, Forbidden Island, and even The Jungle Bird in Sacramento - Tonga really seems to have THE most Tiki-authentic environment.\n\n* Incredible space!  \n\n    From main bar area...\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tonga-room-and-hurricane-bar-san-francisco?select=DogQPxkmkvPMY7d1zgg2pg&userid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w\n\n   ..to main & two side dining areas, Tonga has lots of room to potentially satisfy many patrons.\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tonga-room-and-hurricane-bar-san-francisco?select=i7yAZmZHTEvWzcnjSpPKzw&userid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w\n\n* Rain Forest & Lagoon!  Complete with Thunder & Lightning noises and ACTUAL FALLING WATER from ceiling pipes (intentional, just to be clear) it makes for a fun ambience.\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tonga-room-and-hurricane-bar-san-francisco?select=jsPgDvqge0JNG0j02YDj4A&userid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w\n\n* Floating Band Stand!  Providing ambience at far end of rain forest lagoon - and when band is playing, it will move forward in lagoon.\n\n* \"IF ONLY\" - I wasn't that impressed with \"Main\" dish selections (I tried my friends' Halibut and his wife's Wok), but I managed to still cobble together a decent dinner with the \"Starter\" Crab Cake ($18) and the Pineapple Fried Rice ($10 - two excellent individually offered items. \n\n      In fact, *PROPS* for what could be THE BEST crab cake I've ever had!  If rating was just left to crab cake, 5 Stars all the way!\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tonga-room-and-hurricane-bar-san-francisco?select=SftjtcBw9KWKbX-SVzex_A&userid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w\n\nMORE THAN JUST DECOR MATTERS\n\nSo if ambience & crab cakes were all that mattered, Tonga would easily be a \"5-\"star rating. Unfortunately, based on our recent experience, it only deserves a \"3\"-star overall rating, in that:\n\n= Our \"Jet Pilot\" and \"Zombie\" drinks were way WAY overpowered with Absinthe.  When traditionally done, there should only be a few drops for flavor, but here it felt like there was a shots worth in each.  \nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tonga-room-and-hurricane-bar-san-francisco?select=j-2D20_H-iPKok5BdwZGLw&userid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w\n\n= I can't complain too much about the taste of the 1944 Mai Tai (it's on point), but you get a LOT more bang (ounces) for your buck at Trader Vics, and for substantially less cost ($10 as opposed to $16 here).\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tonga-room-and-hurricane-bar-san-francisco?select=BLdPOKmIvsteTLz9cD45WQ&userid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w\n\n* MENU LIMITATIONS - DINNER \"START\"-FAIL: we got to Tonga by 4:45pm to make their 5pm opening (because we knew from friends you could expect a line, and sure enough, there was) - but disappointment to find out that dinner was not being served 6pm (why do places do this? You're open at 5pm, START SERVING DINNER).\n\n* APPETIZER-*FAIL*: So. We scan the appetizer & starters menu deciding to enjoy their signature pu pu appetizer platter. However, THAT ONE ITEM - still on the menu, mind you, without any notations to the contrary - was not available. It's a cheap trick to dupe diners to your establishment based on signature items, deny them, and then force people to stick around for dinner once they've already made the inordinate investment in time and LYFT to get there in the first place.  \n\n Because of small crowd at 5pm, we could have been in and out by 6:15pm if dinner had started at 5pm But because crowd density has increased by 6pm - and servers weren't particularly great at checking back - we couldn't order our dinners until 6:20pm and so we weren't out of Tonga until 8pm, missing another evening engagement (OUR issue, agreed, but based on an inconsiderate Tonga practice which now makes us very reticent to ever go back nor plan them in our itinerary in the future).\n\nOTHER DINING METRICS\n\n* Though quiet at 5pm, by 8pm noise level is quite substantial.  \n* Our dining area was right next to the bar area, and understand that many hotel patrons just choose to grab a domestic beer ($7) and come stand on the open dance area between the bar and the lagoon to have loud conversations - it is what it is;\n* Parking: don't bother - if you aren't staying here at Fairmont - or aren't a short LYFT ride away from another nearby hotel or home, better rethink your dinner plans. \n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nIf you are staying at the Fairmont - or are close by - Tonga is a nice, very local offering to enjoy. But with other better local Tiki venues nearby in Bay Area, don't go far out of your way just to come here considering inconvenience, disappointments & overall costs.", "author": "Michelangelo S."}

First off, I've wanted to come here for many years now and finally got the chance over Mother's Day weekend which also happened to be my Moms 70th Birthday!  So for her surprise dinner I figured this would be a unique place to celebrate.\nI was a bit worried seeing as though they don't take reservations (MINUS 1 STAR).  So being a \"Holiday weekend\" I wasn't sure we would be seated.\n\nThe hostesses up front were amazing! They said they would try and push us through as quickly as they could.  (ADD 1 STAR)\n\nWe sat at the bar while we waited for a table which was funny because there were MANY tables open.  Since they don't accept reservations, we felt they were just keeping everyone waiting until we hit the 8pm hour when they charge a cover charge....$10 per person.  We had 7 in our party! Wtf?? This is no bueno considering our bar bill cost us over $225 while we waited an hour! (MINUS 1 STAR) The band was good entertainment but only played for under an hour...felt a little cheated on this.\n\nThe food was good.  Everyone seem to enjoy their dishes except one person who said their tenderloin was a bit on the tough side.  The portions were decent for the price and they offer gluten free dishes.  So aside from the tough tenderloin I will still give it a star.  (ADD 1 STAR)\n\nIn the end, yes we had a good time and my mom enjoyed herself.  It was a memorable venue but because of their no reservation policy (unless you are a hotel guest) and the cover charge, I sadly have to say skip this place.

We had the Erasure concert down the street at the Masonic and came right when they opened, as they don't take reso.\n\nThe Tonga Room is inside The Fairmont. We arrived at 5 pm, when they opened.   There was a line when we arrived.  However, we were seated right away, despite missing 40% of our friends, who were in route.  \n\nWe just did drinks/apps but an option to do dinner at 6 pm as an option.  We didn't do entertainment at 8 pm as we had the concert.  I think there is am extra cover charge for this.\n\nOur server was attentive and had great recommendations on drinks.\n\nSince there were 10 of us, we ordered 3 pupu platters to share.  Unfortunately not one item was good.  In fact, it was pretty bad.  Cold, stale, not refresh potstickers, pork tacos, poke tacos, fried shrimp skewers.  There wasn't one thing I liked.\n\nThe drinks were better.  I had a mai tai, which is their sogneture drink.  That was nice and refreshing.  They didn't cheese out on the alcohol.\n\nSince the apps were horrendous, we stayed for dinner as we had time.  We didn't need to move tables.\n\nAfter looking at the menu, I thought, can't go wrong with 28 hr grilled beef short rib.  I was wrong.  It was flavorless, very chewy, and not very good.  The sauce was odd too.  \n\nHonestly, everyone at the table had an issue with their food----flavorless, too salty (fried rice), too salty (king pao), etc.,  The best tasting item was nr friends caulfilower rice dish.  It was actually flavorful.  \n\nDespite all the hype, and knowing the food wasn't going to be good (as many friends have warned), it was a let down.", "author": "Winnie L."}

It was such a delightful experience!  We arrived right at opening and so we snagged a prime table and avoided being part of the SRO.\n\nThe atmosphere alone is worth the trip.  If you love a good tiki bar and you *don't* make this trip, what in the world are you waiting for? It's exactly as you'd imagine and MORE!  They converted the swimming pool into an island get-away, hanging onto the water--there's even a little floating bandstand area for live entertainment!  AND IT RAINS INDOORS, a feature that delighted me each and every time (and I'm sure my enthusiasm had nothing to do with the strength of my drinks).\n\nHonestly, is there anything more grand than a tiki drink?  Especially a tiki drink meant for sharing?  Some might consider them a little pricey but you'll definitely get a lot of bang for your buck!  The happy hour menu is delightful--I'm partial to the dumplings (which are whimsically topped with roe!), the ahi toastadas and the calamari!  I probably wouldn't make this my dinner spot, unless you're fine with making it a tapas-like experience but for a first spot?

Most of us were standing.

It was STRONG -- the type of strong that creeps up on you and hits you out of no where. The serving size looked really small at first, but the alcohol content is high. I prefer fruitier drinks, but if you want a really good buzz, order this one lol. \n\nThe drinks are pretty pricey here, but keep in mind, you are paying for the ambience. There is a floating band that performs during dinner, I believe. It's really pretty inside and they have special effects to make it rain/thunder.

The bar was steady, but not busy, yet it took 15 minutes of standing in front of the bar staring politely at the bartender before he asked me if I wanted a drink. After getting drinks and enjoying the indoor rainfall over the indoor pond (complete with lightening!), I asked the hostess about a dinner table for 10-15. She advised there was going to be an hour and a half wait, so we decided to sit in the bar and enjoyed our drinks and waited for the rest of our party to see if everyone wanted to eat here. \n\nThe manager seated us at a bar table and told me we had to at least order appetizers if we were going to stay (because drinks in the bar apparently don't pay the water bill). There was also going to be a cover charge if we stayed for the band. Lots of rules and money to enjoy the nice Hawaiian atmosphere. \n\nI sat down with my coworkers and my $30 drink, and within 60 seconds had two separate bartenders stop and tell us we couldn't sit there. I should add that I was holding the menu in my hand reading the wildly overpriced menu when they came up to us. I intended to order appetizers for the table, but quickly decided I wasn't giving them any more money.  \n \nWe quickly drank our drinks and left for better service.

I think the main difference that'll make or break your experience is where you're seated which depends on when you get there. On a Saturday evening we got there by 4:25ish and there were no other people waiting. We were the first so we sat down by the waiting area and within 4:45-5pm the calls were nonstop and about 40 people lined up. They take dinner reservations but their lounge is first come first serve so your only way is to get there early. I've seen people wait around the super busy, full bar, stand around, etc which I'm sure is a damper on their experience.\n\nI overheard that for dinner reservations they're booked at least one month in advance so take that into consideration. We were the first ones seated so we scored a really cool seat in the lounge next to the open seat area by the pool. Every 15 minutes or so they stimulate lightning, thunder and rain by the pool which was cool. \n\nWe got two Mai Tais in a bowl which was very good and we also ended up getting a spice killer too. Drinks are CRAZY strong (I choked on both my first sips) so let the ice melt and water it down a little. The ambiance is super cool, though inconsistent. I saw some Japanese room dividers, pirate flag, islander wooden deco, east asian lighting, a buddha sculpture, tiki huts, Hawaiian mahalos, etc. I think this place is a must stop at least once, it's located inside the Fairmont Hotel and also have live music at 8pm.

INSIDE, transpiring every 15-20 minutes or so during your meal!!!\n\n(And I thought -I- brought the BOOOOM!)\n\nFrom drizzle to drips followed by a solid downpour, the precipitation is prominent and chiLLLe... it hardly ends there; Kenny wouldn't steer you wrong, so TRUST ME when I say that the drinks here are to DIE FOR! \n\nFrom coma to resurrection - THE HURRICANE, as indicated within the establishment's name alone - is deservingly their signature drink while they take pride in their house made Mai tai and bay-beh- \n\n*** IT AIN'T NO SECRET THAT THIS KATRINA THEMED ELIXIR WILL FLOOD YOUR LIFE WITH ALL KINDS OF MISERY AND LEAVE YOU DELUSIONAL, IN SHAMBLES AND IN ABSOLUTE DESPAIR!!!\n\nFrom there, there's a buffet, regular menu, \"Happy Hour\" and the list goes on and while most are overpriced and non-revolutionary, is it not prominent that you're paying for the EXPERIENCE of your being enabled up undergo it all?!\n\n[---Disclaimer: It's best I interject that just as the fools that are dying to get into Heaven will surely have to wait their turns...  those looking to dine within it's 2nd coming have got to do the same.---]\n\nTables within this joint are often booked for weeks, if not MONTHS at a time, and while \"Open Table\" is an option, anticipating this place answering the phone, IS NOT!\n\n\"Mama always said not to use the phone when it rained.

Our server was super attentive and recommended drinks and entrees for our first visit.

First and foremost -being inside of a hotel is sort of obnoxious because you have to walk all the way through the hotel to get to it, but I guess it's good business for them. We can usually find parking on the street which is a plus in San Francisco, but you still have a good little walk ahead of you to get there. Another irritating factor is they don't open until 4 o'clock I believe, and while I realize a lot of fancier places open on the later side, it's a bummer if you're a day drinker. I was so intrigued to pay a visit because Anthony Bourdain had been there and made it look so exotic and amazing, but unfortunately when you walk in it's incredibly dark and always super crowded. The drinks were good, but not amazing. It's definitely a cool place to visit if you want The tiki bar experience or to at least say that you've been, I really only go back because the husband seems to really enjoy the atmosphere. Drinks in my opinion are way overpriced but they do have that Hawaiian style theme with the fresh fruit and the cool glasses and stuff so I can see the appeal.

Don't waste your time or money. \n\nWe were initially excited to indulge a few umbrella drinks at this unexpected tropical oasis beneath the historical and grand Fairmont hotel. The Tonga Room has its own side entrance separate from the main hotel . We found our way to the dark hideaway and was greeted by a ho hum hostess who asked if we wanted to stand in the middle of the small bar area or sit at a table in the lounge area ...uhmmmm yeah , considering there were many open seats , please give us a table with a couple of chairs to enjoy our drinks for a moment !  Gheez, it was totally awkward and weird . \n\n\nAnyway, our server was actually much better . She gave us a couple of drink and food menus , \n and wow... everything was seriously over priced. Every drink was priced at $15 or above. Nothing special about the drinks . The server informed us that they are famous for their mai tai, so we ordered one along with a simple pi\u00f1a colada . The $15 dollar mai tai tasted the same as a 5$ mai tai from any dive bar in the city. It tasted like a regular mai tai, nothing mysterious or special about it . My pi\u00f1a colada  had too much ice and tasted sour with an off-putting medicinal after taste. I did not enjoy it at all.   What a waste of $$. \n\nOnly saving grace to the Tonga Room was the over the top tropical tiki decor. It was kind of cool to be sitting in a dim room lit with tiki lamps, decorated with huts and bamboo tables and chairs surrounding a huge shallow lagoon that receives thunderstorms every 15 minutes ! I mean it's kind of cheesy, but still fun . You can't help but smile and enjoy your surroundings, even if the drinks were poo poo . \n\nWould I come back again ? No. It was an experience .

I came on a Friday at 6 and the place was packed with guffawing tourists and corporate types having their awkward \"work happy hour.\" The bartender was nice enough, clearly overworked, but the drinks were all premade and dumped from a bottle.\n\nThere is a very large \"lagoon\" (more of a \"pool\") in the center of the place, and apparently a band floats around on a large raft and plays music in this thing: Unfortunately, at least while I was there, the lagoon was crowded entirely with people taking selfies and staring at their phones, and there was bland pop music playing from the speakers. While I mulled whether to stay and wait for the band, someone farted out the most offensive cloud of stink i've ever encountered, making my decision very easy.\n\nI had very high hopes for a historic tiki bar in san francisco, but...just no. They get one more star than nothing because their bartender seemed to understand my plight despite no exchange of words.", "author": "joe s."}

I've done a few events here and passed by but never had the chance to make reservations and actually dine at the Tonga Room. Fortunately I have an awesome boss that reads my mind and made Friday night dinner reservations.\n\nSome of us arrived early and were able to get seated. The hostesses and waiters were super friendly and accommodating. We got to sit at one of the tables next to the water, which had a stunning view! Lots of twinkly lights and cute cabanas. Once in awhile, the \"show\" would happen, where thunder, lightning, and rain is simulated. Interesting... And kinda random. This room probably used to be an indoor pool at the hotel. This is so much better.\n\nWhile we waited for everyone to arrive, we ordered the \"Monk Walks into a Luau\" cocktail bowl for everyone to share. Lots of fun tropical flavors that will give you a sugar rush AND a hangover in the morning. We also ordered the Royal Pupu Platter. Best decision for a big group! Everything on the platter was solid: the BBQ Kona pork ribs, shiitake mushrooms spring rolls, spicy chicken wings, and Dungeness crab rangoons. Sooo good.\n\nFor my entr\u00e9e, I got the kalua pork, which is smoked and slow roasted and topped with island slaw, pork au jus, and Hawaiian rolls. Mmmm... Would HIGHLY recommend this dish. It's a TON of food, enough for my lunch the next day. Or you could technically dine family style to sample all the \"island flavors\" that Tonga Room has to offer.\n\nSince it's at the Fairmont, food and drinks are on the pricier side, but it's fun to experience at least once... And possibly again when friends are in town.  It's more of a tourist attraction than anything. And even if you don't dine here, the drinks are pretty good, and you can't beat this ambiance. I look forward to coming here again!!", "author": "Stefanie C."}

They definitely don't skimp out on the alcohol here. \n\nThis place is a little hard to find and the easiest way to get to it is if you go through the entrance marked for the health & wellness gym. There are no signs for the Tonga room on the main floor of the Fairmont so its best if you ask someone that works at the hotel to direct you. \n\nThe service was okay as the front desk staff ask if you are eating dinner or just here for drinks. The group before us was also only here for drinks but had to go to the bar which is standing room only. We were lucky and got a table even though there were plenty of tables open. Once we sat down, our waitress informed us that we could also order dinner so it's a little confusing what the seating protocol is. \n\nI would only come for happy hour as all the drinks are $10 and the drinks for 2 to share are $20. Otherwise, all the drinks at $15+ which can get quite pricey. We also ordered the poke to share and it came with a little too much mayo but the gyoza chip it came on was super crunchy. \n\nThe \"rain\" comes on periodically with thunder by the pool area to make it seem like you are in some tropical location.

The indoor rainstorm and the ancient tiki atmosphere are still timelessly wonderful, but the same rules still apply.\n\n1. Go for happy hour, 5 pm - 7 pm, Wednesday through Friday. This is a place to start an evening, not end it. (Place closes early anyway.)\n\nHappy hour drinks are $10. (Normally drinks are $18.) I had a zombie last night that was great, and my wife's mai tai met expectations.\n\n2. It is not advised to have a meal here. Just don't do it, and you won't be disappointed. \n\nSo it's pretty simple. You will be charmed by the ancient Tonga Room if you start your night on the town here with a $10 happy-hour tropical drink. You will be frustrated and (if you're especially naive) feel overcharged if you go there to get plastered after 7 pm. \n\nYou will be angry if you eat there expecting great food. But why would you? Only a crazy person would expect this to be a good restaurant.\n\nThere are plenty of others in SF, and besides, it's no fun to hunker down in a hotel restaurant/bar for hours when you should be out in the fog exploring your options.", "author": "Frappy F."}

When after 30ish minutes I asked the lady upfront if it was about to be our turn, she just said \"yes I guess we could have you seated now\" so... was it really a 30min wait or was it just a buffer time for the customers to spend some money at the bar?

You have college kids in Hawaiian shirts doing their retro thing on the dance floor and there is 50somthing's doing their \"back in the day\" thing. The great live house band plays everything from Dona Summers to The Eagles to the latest hip hop. \n\nThe bar area which includes a large dance floor is free admission. It's $10 per person if you like a table with waiter service. \n\nThe drink menu has the liquor and sweetness levels mark on each drink. Which is good because the Zombie was super sweet and had an after taste if Aqua Velvet aftershave. It's hard to get use to the taste. The Jungle Bird was a lot less sweet and the after taste was more mild (a less potent aftershave lotion taste). \n\nDon't mind the prices on the drink menu because they change on weekends or nights. The Zombie was $19 served in a tall glass (about 13oz) and the Jungle Bird $17.50 served in very short glass (about 6oz). Pricey so make sure you do some \"pre-gaming\" before coming here.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is an awesome Tiki vibe but the carpet in the table area really needs to be replaced.

It was the end of the night and we were tired but we decided to give this place a try. The first thing we noticed on the Saturday night was a line to get into it. We almost didn't feel like waiting but we decided what the hell. It took about 15-20 minutes to get in, which is about our threshold for waiting for a bar.\n\nThe second thing we notice, is why people want to come in. This tiki bar looks awesome! There are ornate carvings everywhere, string lights Adorn it to illuminate the place while not making it too bright. And there's a pool of water with a boat in the middle which featured a live band. All the members were in Hawaiian style gear.\n\nThe next thing I noticed was the horrible, horrible hysteria to try to get a drink at the bar. There were four or five bartenders but there was about 30-40 people trying to rush at the bar. With everyone requesting their specialty cocktails that are tricky to make, it takes a while to be served. Your best bet is to get one or two rounds of drinks drinks for your party so you don't have to wait a second time. Our wait time for the drinks had to be close to 30 minutes.\n\nOnce you're done with that frustration, you're free to drink and use the Dance Floor to listen to the very good cover band. That made up for the terrible drink wait. I couldn't come here all the time but I can see it being a little bit better during a weekday.

I visited on a Sunday night, April 8, 2018 arrived at 7 PM and was quoted a 45 minute wait. If you have less than 10 people and are not a hotel guest, you cannot make a reservation. We were invited to wait in the Hurricane bar - standing only. The tables are for those who just want cocktails and appetizers.  The wait was the same 45 minutes. The cocktails are pretty pricey but all pretty tasty and are reminiscent of Polynesia. If you are seated at a table after or during the clock striking 8:15 PM when the band starts, you will be charged $10/person cover on your dinner bill. If you walk in after 8:15 PM unless you are a hotel guest the cover is $15/person. We had 5 in our party. We order the appetizer sampler, a beef dish, a pork dish, a fish dish and asparagus. White and brown rice are included. This was plenty of food served family style. Of all the dishes, we didn't like the pork too much. It had a weird flavor but in contrast, the snapper had a sauce that was pretty yummy. A birthday comped dessert was delivered and we ordered a key lime cake to share. Pretty yummy as well served with a passion fruit sauce. \nThe 3 piece band was pretty good, playing lots of upbeat danceable, well-known songs. We had a great time.  Our pre-dinner drinks were $55.00 and our dinner with cover charge was $289. You can decide if you think it was worth it - for the fun and atmosphere we thought it was worth it.

She apparently gave permission advising there would eventually be a $10 cover to stay to listen to a band.  We all sat at the table and began looking at overpriced food menus when two bartenders came to us advising it was not open seating and asked us to leave (mind you the table had been empty for 30 minutes, was generating no revenue for Tonga or its employees, and we were a party of 12 willing to order more overpriced drinks and food).  The hostess then came over advising we were not allowed to sit there.  Maybe the restaurant enjoyed empty tables and not making money.  \n\nBased on the complete rudeness of the bartenders, hostess, and another unidentified employee, our party of 12 decided to finish the drinks we ordered and left to eat elsewhere. All of us were in San Francisco on business and were from different states.  None of us were happy with the service from the bartenders or any other employee, nor were we impressed with the prices or the drinks.  Very cool atmosphere but I will never return to Tonga because of this experience.  I cannot believe a restaurant would allow a table for 10 to sit empty while a group of 12 who fit at the table would be asked to leave so the table could continue to sit empty (it was not previously reserved or we would have understood).  Should I return to San Francisco, I will certainly eat somewhere else and not waste my money at this overpriced, under trained, and rude staff.", "author": "Heather M."}

But to be honest, we were very disappointed with the appetizers. We ordered the pork ribs($20)and poke tostada($16), both were cold(supposed to be warm) and on the bland side. However, I do have to say the Macadamia crusted Mahi Mahi was pretty phenomenal and the Peppered beef was very good too. For dessert, we shared the key lime cake with fresh pur\u00e9ed mango, it was close to a perfect dessert, not to sweet, not too tart. Anyways, all in all it's a neat place to go, it's got a cool vibe to it even without the band playing(extra $15 pp to listen to). For a Fairmont restaurant, I feel like they should try a bit harder to give their customers a bit more of a memorable experience. Appetizers were definitely lacking big time!!!", "author": "Nola C."}

But when I came back in September, 2017, this time as a guest of another hotel, it was a completely different experience and I was very disappointed.\n\nFirst, the prices have gone up because, from what I understand it, the restaurant is under new management. OK. It's San Francisco and it's at the Fairmont Hotel. Everyone should expect high prices. \n\nSecond, because I was not a guest at the Fairmont Hotel as I was in the first occasion, I could not sit near the water as I had requested. This, despite the fact that there were tables available next to the water  for the entirety of my dinnerthat I could easily have been sent out.\n\nThird, having spent over hundred dollars on dinner for my wife and I, I was told that if we stayed past 8:15 pm there would be a $20 cover charge added to our bill because 8:15 Is when the music started. So, at 8:10, I had to decide whether to buy dessert and incur an additional $20 (on top of the expense of the desert), or end the dinner  a little early. I did not like that at all.\n\n\nUltimately, I would recommend eating here, but only if the music is playing (after 8:15) and you are a guest at the Fairmont Hotel. The music is really outstanding. Only 2 stars because I was really jaded after my second visit. \n\nUpdate: Thanks for the response. However, the ADDED cover charge of $20 or $30 per couple after 8:15 AFTER IVE ALREADY SPENT OVER $100 ON DINNER IS CRAP.", "author": "Lou L."}

I wasn't interested in the band so if you stay past 8:00 pm the add a $10 surcharge to the guest at the table.  \n\nWe arrived at 6 but it took someone 5 minutes to greet us at the host stand, they sat us at a nice table and reminded us that at 8:15 they would add the band surcharge.  Once seated we were greeted and served water and the server who was most gracious came over and talked to us about the drinks.... by this time it was 6:30 before we even ordered appetizers.  \n\nThe drinks were ok, I didn't think they were with $15 each... but again I realize it was a special occasion.  We got the appetizer which was a combination of the appetizers. I did like the Poke Tostada.  By this time we had been enjoying our drinks and appetizers but time had slipped by so fast it was already 7:45, so we decided to get our check and move on to a place that our $20 would be better spent on food and not on a band cover charge.\n\nThe old school Disney ambiance was fun and the service was great... but if food is a very important criteria then the appetizer was an indicator that Perhaps don't have to high an expectation.", "author": "RS M."}

This is a three and a half star review. \n\nIt's the definition of tiki-tacky in the best way. The lol is campy and fun, the rain is entertaining, and having a band play on the boat keeps it fun. If you can, go for happy hour. Prices are better, and they are overall pretty steep. They don't accept reservations unless you are staying at the Fairmont, so keep that in mind. We got there early, before dinner service started, and only happy hour was available. I got a fog cutter, and it was quite good, for a fog cutter.\n\nWe ended up getting a happy hour table, and another round of drinks, so tried a scorpion bowl or two... Honestly, the flavors were not great. The \"a monk walks in to a luau\" was very medicinal, and no one really liked it. The other was much better received.\n\nSo to assure we could stand, we got a few apps. The poke was solid, and the wings were fine, but the calamari was overly breaded and tough. We moved to a regular table, and got mains. I had the racist and was very happy with it. The crab cake was also excellent. I think a few people were less plussed about the stir fry dishes. \n\nThe service was slow. It took a long time to order, and we had to chase down the bill at the end of the night. While fun and kitschy is lovely and the food was solid,  the speed of service and waits for no reason took away from the experience... And one of the bowl drinks was actually pretty disgusting.", "author": "Erin O."}

I noticed that he was catious to interupt our conversations.  If someone was in the midst of chatting, he would quietly wait on the side before catching everyone's attention.  \n\nI got the Hurricane cocktail and it was strong!

The food was delicious as well.  I forget the exact dish name but the pork was really tender and juicy.  \n\nA cocktail and an entree came out to be ~$66 after tax and tip FYI.

I have been trying to get in touch with someone for three days to schedule a party for my wife's birthday and I cannot reach a human-being to save my life. There is no direct line that is ever answered at the restaurant and in calling the hotel lobby the operator just transfers me to the vacant phone line. It's the worst experience I have had at any restaurant, ever.  I have left multiple voicemails for Alexis who runs their reservations and she has been relatively unresponsive/unhelpful. It would seem the Tonga Room is in the fortunate position of having more business than they know what to do with because I have never encountered a more apathetic group of employees.  If you are able to speak with someone who works there, let alone secure a reservation, count yourself among an elite class of highly fortunate individuals.", "author": "Cameron F."}

My friend and I ended up ordering drinks as well as a few items from the happy hour menu, which was no where near appetizing. \n\nThe chicken wings were lightly flavored with what smelled like a fish sauce, paired with what seemed like a sort of spicy aioli. The server that brought out the fried calamari paired it with this sort of cilantro vinaigrette. As he set it down, he mentioned other sauces were available for the fried calamari should this one not suffice. However, when we asked another server for the other sauces, she had no idea what we were talking about. We did appreciate the constant filling of our glasses of water. \n\nThis place has been a staple in my life for good drinks and yummy bar bites. I have noticed the change in management and overall staffing this past year as well as price differences. However, it did not feel the same to me this time around, and I am no longer excited for or looking forward to going here like I used to be. Would I go again?

The band sits in a little hut in the middle of the pool (that's right, there's a pool in this place!). Extremely Instagram worthy I would say.\n\nThe bartenders were all super friendly too. They helped us when we had no idea what to order. \n\nDRINKS:\nPINEAPPLE ROYALE ($13) - insanely delicious! I ordered the cheaper version of the drink, which comes in a ceramic pineapple vs. a real pineapple ($24). Perfect mix of pineapple, rum, and brandy. I would 100% order this drink again and again\nSCORPION BOWL ($20 for 2 people) - love how this drink is served...in one big bowl with multiple long straws. \nSMUGGLER'S GOLDEN PUNCH BOWL ($22 for 2 people) - tasted like a moscow mule but with rum...it was amazing. I liked it better than the scorpion bowl. so much happiness\n\nFOOD:\nEDAMAME - Can't go wrong...always a great snack.\nSLIDERS - so yummy! perfect amount when we weren't too hungry and needed some light bites\n\nVIBES:\nAfter we finished our (many) drinks, we headed to the dance floor. I felt like I was at a wedding/bar mitzvah.

Which is fine, means the food must be good right? I guess. Maybe. Meh.\n\nStay away from the appetizers. We had the vegetable potstickers and they lacked flavor. They were hard, leathery, and cold and filled with flavorless paste. As for the Pok-Pok wings, Ive had better chicken wings from the deli at Safeway.\n\nFor main's my wife had the short rib, which was probably the best Ive tried anywhere, very tender and juicy. I had the porterhouse steak. It was a little over cooked and WAY too salty. It had a nice Asian flavor but it was hard to taste through all the salt. \n\nThis place is known for their Tiki theme, great drinks, and live music performances. Its pretty much the only reason to come. In fact, some people ONLY come for the music, dancing and drinks at the bar area. They have a dancefloor that gets really packed and people even wait in line outside just to get in like you'd expect at some fancy night club. \n\nIf you come and spend an evening here with friends you'll have a great time. \n\nBut what put me off about this place was the $15 pp charge for the live music. I would be fine paying this if I just came here to have a drink and enjoy the music. But to have to pay even if you are having dinner here is kinda ridiculous if you ask me. Between the 4 of us we shared 3 appetizers, we each ordered a main course, and shared 3 large drink bowls ($50+ each). Just for food and bev we spent around $400. Do you really need to charge us an additional $60??? It aint like Bruno Mars was performing or anything.\n\nThis is an overpriced 2 star restaurant. But I added a star for the awesome drinks, music and fun atmosphere.", "author": "Rimar T."}

There was live music at several points in the evening, and the raining water in the pool was also a nice touch. My company hosted our holiday party here, and we had a section of the restaurant blocked off for us with an open bar and a selection of food. The mai tai was a nice drink, served in a fake coconut and not short on the rum! I was less a fan of the spice killer, which was a bit overpowered with spices. \n\nWe had a buffet line of appetizers, dinner, and dessert, and for me, the food left something to be desired. The vegetable spring rolls and shiitake egg rolls were decent to start with, and the chicken wings and pork ribs were pretty standard and decent bar fare as well. However, I found the mahi mahi quite dry, and the Mongolian beef, the chicken, and the chow mein quite flavorless. For dessert, the chocolate mousse wasn't bad, but the mini-cheesecakes and pineapple upside-down cake (with barely any pineapple) weren't particularly memorable.

The bar area did not include a full dinner menu, just the limited bar food menu and drinks. We ordered the ahi poke, teriyaki wings, short rib sliders, fried rice, edamame, and bulgogi lettuce wraps. The food came out slowly since the small tables in the bar area could not accommodate more than two plates at a time.  The taro chips that came with the ahi poke tasted stale and old. It was crunchy and soggy at the same time. The teriyaki wings was overly salty. The short rib in the sliders were so tough you could not even bite into it without pulling the whole piece of meat out. The bulgogi was as tough as the short ribs. Edamame is edamame, you can't really mess that up. The fried rice was decent and was the only thing I liked about this meal.\n\nI also ordered a lychee martini and it was made with vodka instead of sake, which is more common, and it did not taste good at all. My next drink was the pineapple royal, which was just rum and pineapple juice. This was pretty good.\n\nThe bill came out to be over $160 and that is ridiculously expensive for some bar food and 3 drinks. They also had entertainment that night so it was $5 per person.\n\nThe atmosphere and concept is cool which merits them 2 stars but the price and quality of food is definitely not there.\n\nAnthony Bourdain may have featured this restaurant but trust me and save yourself by NOT coming here.\n\nTotal disappointment.", "author": "Lena V."}

There is a cover charge of $15 per person if you want to sit at the table and order food during the live music nights! There aint no cover charge if you just want to order drinks and be on the dance floor. Food wise, we ordered the vegetable pot stickers, kung pao tofu and the key lime layer cake.

If you really want to check this place out for the ambiance, come here just to check it out -- don't order anything and don't get a table. Just enjoy the atmosphere and leave. Here's why:\n\nTHERE ARE TOO MANY RULES. Honestly, I hope the manager gets fired and someone with actual sense about customer experience re-vamps this place. Some of the rules we encountered last night:\n\n1. No sitting in the bar/standing area. My friend was feeling a little dizzy and grabbed a chair to sit down. Multiple waiters came and hassled her to stand up. She was not blocking anybody and just needed to sit for a few minutes since there was a long wait for a table. Nope, she had to stand.\n\n2. If you want to wait for a table, you can't put your name down. You have to stand in line the entire time to be seated.\n\n3. If you ordered a drink at the bar, you can't wait for a table because they \"can't\" bring the drinks to your table.\n\n4. No ordering food at the standing/bar area.\n\n5. You can't sit at the small tables at the standing area, the hostess needs to seat you because apparently they're ALL RESERVED.\n\n6. You need to pay right away. Otherwise they will take away your drinks and treat you like a bad child if you don't.\n\nApparently, the Tonga Room is a hot spot for people who feel the need to impose their authority on customers since they probably have miserable, powerless personal lives at home. It's appalling to see how they don't care about customer satisfaction at all. What's the point of having a business if you just want to make up 5023874301 rules to impose -- why don't you just move to North Korea? You can buddy up with other dictators to make other people miserable.\n\nHonestly, one of the worst experiences I've ever had. Not to mention that punch bowls with minimal alcohol cost close to $40 and the carpeted floor in the standing area is SO STICKY. My friend, who was the birthday girl, could barely walk around cause her shoe was stuck to the floor and her foot kept slipping out!! I wanted to get the names of the servers and write a complaint to fairmont but since it was my friend's birthday and our buzz was already dissipated, I didn't want to add to the fire.\n\nI will never be back and I hope other yelpers who read this review will heed my warning -- DON'T GO. If you think a bad experience is worth seeing \"rain\" aka SPRINKLERS come on and a mediocre cover band, then please be my guest. Otherwise, there are plenty of better options with better price points and better customer service in SF.", "author": "Sharon C."}

We had reservations at 8pm on a Saturday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. We were seated promptly. \n\nOur table service was odd, it seemed like we had three different waiters and it felt like we were the table that kept getting delayed service. A table that was seated 15-20 minutes after us got their drinks and food way before ours. Granted there were a few bigger tables but c'mon, you can't ignore one just because of the big tables. Anyhoo, we had a mixed appetizer of ribs, egg rolls, chicken, and crab won tons. It was decent but maybe skip the crab won tons. Those did not taste like there was fresh crab in it at all. \n\nThe atmosphere was lively and perfect for sharing a bowl of an alcoholic mixed drink with tons of rum. The drinks were all \"islandy\" and of course expensive. I ordered the scallops which did not taste fresh but my dinnermates' dinners all seemed okay. Desserts were just okay as well. The highlight of the place is the music, the band played in a half-boat which floated in the middle of the rectangular pool. They played covers from the 40's to the 00's and did celebration shout-outs to the diners. Seems like erryone had a birthday that night. They were awesome. \n\nIf you want the full experience, make reservations. If you just want to hang out and listen to music, hit up the bar and stick to the appetizers because the regular food isn't that great. There is usually a line for bar seating in the evening (sometimes more than an hour wait) so get there early.", "author": "Prim P."}

They had a large section of the bar area condoned off for a private party that made the rest of the bar really crowded.  We had the same waitress we had the night before, but the service wasn't as good.  The drinks and food were good.\n\nSo ffter two nights at the same place, we decided we would try someplace else for our final night in SF.", "author": "Wil C."}

(I've even been there for High School Prom events.) I wish I could be more excited about this review, but in all honesty, and at present, I am very disappointed, AND I will avoid going there unless I have lots of money I want to spend for dinner.  I say this because I know the food on the dinner menu to be quite good.  It is very representative of food one might have in a number of Pacific islands, and  I have been delighted with many items I have ordered.\n\nWhat I am reviewing at this moment is what used to be an incredible Happy Hour experience. I understand that drinks and appetizers have increased in price over the years, and I willingly accept that.  What I am most disappointed with is the the offering of free food that is provided during the acclaimed happy hour.  In the past there was shrimp, ribs, meat egg rolls, very tasty noodle dishes, incredible salad combinations, and even things like shu mai , and tasty pieces of chicken on skewers.  \nThese days, it seems that there is nothing even resembling actual protein on the appetizer table.  The options are mostly carbs; vege eggs rolls, bland chow mein, and a few other things I don't know how to describe.\nThe Tonga Room is a fabulous atmosphere, and the rain pool is one of the most magnificent elements of any night club/ restaurant in San Francisco.  Tonga Room management, charge enough to make the food better, and many of your local patrons will return.  Please.", "author": "janice s."}

You can't even call to make a reservation. On our first evening in San Francisco, we decided to take a chance on a Friday night and just go to the Tonga Room and see if we could get in.\n\nWhen we arrived, the joint was jumping and it was even before the music started. I asked the hostess if there was room for 3 and she said, \"For appetizers and drinks?\" Naturally, I said yes and we were seated. If the Tiki Room and Pirates of the Caribbean had a baby, it would be the Tonga Room. \n\nAround 8ish, the music started. The band is set up on a barge in the middle of the lagoon(Yes, the hotel turned their pool into a restaurant). I was wondering what kind of music they were going to play considering the clientele, which was a mix of everyone. And yes, there were hipster and man buns. I mean, it is San Francisco, right? The band played music that crossed all the age groups in the room. People were dancing including the cougars and kids.\n\nThe appetizer menu has something for everyone. It is, of course, Tiki themed. They also have a large tropical drink menu. My wife started with a Chi Chi. My daughter had Pineapple juice on the rocks. I had my usual Maker's Mark Manhattan. As for the food, we tried several things. Calamari being one of them. \n\nI am always concerned when I go to places like this because I always think the service is going to be horrible. I don't like to be rushed, etc. Romy was our server and did an incredible job and even treated my 9 year old with respect, which a lot of servers don't do. So if you go to the Tonga Room, ask for Romy.\n\nAfter all was said and done, we ended up spending 4 hours and about $200.00, but I would do it again. I don't go to San Francisco very often, but the Tonga Room is on my list of \"go to\" places and it should be on your list also.", "author": "Bill S."}

A had family visiting from out of town and we had the idea to come here after wandering around SF for a few hours. We got here around 4:45pm (they open at 5) and were the first in line. We have tried to get in for Happy Hour before and the line has been down the hall before opening. Since they don't have Happy Hour on the weekends, it only started to fill up about 5 minutes before opening. We were sat promptly at 5 in the bar area on the pirate ship at the corner of the lake in the middle.\n\nLet's just get out of the way that Tonga Room's decorations are tacky AF. This is normal for Tiki Bars and adds to the fun. They have a thunderstorm every 10-15 minutes where it rains in the middle of the pool. It's pretty wild. Anyways, the 5 of us each ordered our own individual drink. I ordered a Spice Killer ($15) and A got a Zombie ($18). 2 others at our table got these drinks and the 5th person got a Tonga Kong ($15). The menu specifies how strong/sweet these drinks are on a scale of skulls (for alcohol) and sticks (for sweetness). The Spice Killers were the most alcoholic/least sweet and the Tonga Kong and Zombies were more sweet/less alcoholic. We had dinner reservations after so we didn't order food but what the table next to us ordered smelled surprisingly delicious. \n\nOur drinks arrived in 15 minutes and they were HUGE. I didn't try the Tonga Kong but the Zombie tasted much more alcoholic than my Spice Killer though I definitely preferred the taste of mine to A's. That being said, these drinks were sneakily strong. I was DEFINITELY feeling a bit jolly halfway through my drink. By the time we had finished our drinks, we were a fun bunch. Since we had time before our reservation, we decided to split the 4-person Rainmaker ($60) between the 5 of us. Keep in mind this had the same alcohol/sweetness rating as my beloved Spice Killer. This drink was great and a lot of fun to share but there was a lot of ice in it so we finished it much sooner than anticipated. Determined to make it to dinner, be able to joy it and maintain some fine dining table manners, we asked for the check. While it was ~$30pp, I will say that I did not feel ripped off by these drinks based on how strong and large they were. \n\nI took off a star for the music since they were playing top-40 which was a bit...bizarre. Also, you can take kids here so there definitely are a fair amount of parents getting silly while their 6-year-old is in awe over the pirate ship. This makes a bit of an odd atmosphere but it IS in the middle of a hotel. Is it a tourist spot? Sure but, like House of Prime Rib, this place deserves to be one. I don;t think A and I will be back by ourselves but next time we have visitors, you can bet we are going to make an effort to come here.", "author": "Carrie W."}

There's a random body of water with a floating stage that plays host to random live performances. The decor is tacky and tropical (?) themed. The drinks are strong and pricey. The food is decent - but I think most people come here for the bustling atmosphere, commitment to kitsch, and the aura of being able to get weirdly drunk and no one will mind since you're already surrounded by weirdness.

Our bill was very reasonable for this kind of crazy place- even with all the drinks and the VERY large salads- plenty for 2- our bill was only 90 with tax!  It was a Weds- so there was no band.  Might be fun to see that.  It's dark in here, and I'm not sure about the happy hour- people seemed kind of grumpy over there.

This version was not worthy at all.  I was really disappointed that I had to argue with the hostess for a few seconds that happy hour should at least be available in the bar, which it was but not until I complained,  Also remember no food served at the bar(as one employee mentioned to me it is not cost effective because it takes me 20-30 seconds to make a $20 drink but I have to stop and go all the way to the kitchen if someone orders food.  This all a shock to me as I was here a couple of months ago and was able to order the food at HH prices (on a Sun night-but I think the band had stopped playing????

There's no other place I know of in San Francisco that has a full Hawaiian theme lounge and bar. This place was highly recommended from my sister who lives in San Francisco. It's located inside the Fairmont Hotel below the lobby. The staff who assisted us on the hotel were more than friendly in getting to the Tonga Lounge. Talk about 5 star service in a 5 star hotel. \n\nInside of the Tonga Lounge includes a large lounge decorated with bamboo, a dance floor and a lagoon. Talk about an island theme! One of the band members mentioned that the room use to be the hotel's indoor swimming pool, very interesting.\n\nI ordered the Hurricane $17 and that was strong and we ordered some appetizers calamari and soybeans, both were ok. The soybeans had some spicy salt on top and the calamari was very breaded. They have a live band playing in the background with an artificial thunderstorm with some thunder. Our waiter was very courteous with our order. The place seems to be popular because there was a long line for people to get in without reservation. It was a good experience and relaxing indeed. I hold this as one of my lounge spots whenever I return to San Francisco.", "author": "Paul B."}

We wanted to be seated next to the pool area to watch the band.  We were told over the phone 3x it shouldn't be a problem.  The 4th time we were actually having drinks at the bar during Happy Hour a couple of hours earlier and talked to the hostesses.  Again, it shouldn't be a problem.  We went to the room, got cleaned up and went back down for dinner.  \n\nWhen we got there...sorry, no table by the pool.  I was livid. I told one of the hostesses that I talked to people 4 different times and she was the only one who says that it is a problem.  She just walked away, probably to not blow up in my face.  We were appeased by Natalie who put us in a bigger table with a decent view.  But still, why could we not get what we wanted? Last year we had dinner there and asked if we could sit at the poolside tables which were empty at the time.  We were told they were reserved.  So this year, why could they not have done the same thing and not seat people there when we reserved and requested a poolside table?  \n\nEarlier, at Happy Hour, my husband ordered 2 glasses of wine at the bar.  When he tasted it, he said he wanted to buy the bottle.  The bartender, Matthew, said he only poured one of the glasses out of the new bottle, so he wanted to charge us for the bottle and a glass.  He was also rude about it.  We complained to the manager about his behavior.\n\nFinally, during dinner we ordered the deep fried Red Snapper, sort of an Asian version of a Mexican Majares Fritas.  $44.  When it came to the table it looked great.  Whole fish displayed on a huge platter.  It was almost embarrassing, but looked delicious too.  The seasoning was great, but the meat very dry.  Very disappointing.  We were beaten down by that time and decided to just go with the flow, enjoy Christmas Day and the music.", "author": "Gail K."}

If you wanted to get a table, you had to stand in a line (where they could see you, vs. putting your name down) and wait until they let you into the dining area). We were told that you can either pay $15 for their happy hour buffet (about 6-7 different options ranging from noodles to eggrolls) or stick to buying drinks at the bar. Because we planned on going to dinner after this, we stuck to the drinks.\n\nI got the mai-tai, which wasn't very adventurous of me honestly. I was overwhelmed by the drink options and stuck to what I knew - very boring. It was alright.. but as the two star rating on Yelp states, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" There was so much ice in my glass that I honestly feel that the drink only filled up half of the glass total before the ice pushed it to the top. My friend got the drink which had coffee in it and returned it because it tasted so strongly of milk, which she said didn't mix well with the alcohol.\n\nOnce you get your drinks you can either sit at the bar (which is packed), or find space to stand in the small area where the buffet is - but majority of the room is dining tables which are completely empty.\n\nThe couple next to where I was standing paid for the buffet, and were complaining about how bland the food was.

One co-worker made the perfect comment of \"oh look! a line!\"  A couple key notes -\n\n- We were supposed to have appetizers (400 of each) yet they somehow ran out in 10 minutes.  I was there at the very beginning and never saw anything.  They had the venue throughout three rooms but I later found out that the appetizers never left the first room and the people walking around never made it to the actual tonga room\n\n- The bar did not take cards.  SERIOUSLY?  And I know that if they had told our team putting this together before hand, they would have got the message out to everyone to bring cash so they obviously didn't.  How does a bar not take cards?\n\n- The bartenders except one lady were incredibly slow.  Someone said it best, they were like bartenders you have in a hotel lobby - not a bar.  The old man actually snapped at the coworker I was with and she hadn't even said anything to him yet.  Incredibly rude.  Another bartender when asked if there was anything to drink for pregnant ladies, literally yelled back \"WATER!\" How is this a way to treat guests?  The guests weren't even being disrespectful.  And then they tried to charge for water!  The free stuff that comes out of a tap! \n\n- The food was not set up in a good situation to refill easily and food ran out everywhere.\n\nLike I said previously, the Tonga room definitely over sold us and were in no way ready and able to accommodate what they said they could.", "author": "Amanda K."}

Considering how busy they were, our drinks surprisingly arrived in just 7 minutes...from the kitchen.\n\nWith the first sip of the Smuggler's Punch (white rum), we looked at each other and we all had DAT face...like we just sucked sour toes. Maybe the Scorpion Bowl (dark rum) tasted better? Nope, it tasted like ass with butane. They were the WORST drinks we've ever had. Bar none. A hot mess of cheap wells charged at top shelf prices thrown together by someone who has no business mixing drinks. The Bon Vivants would be horrified. \n\nMy friend's pi\u00f1a colada was merely commercial pi\u00f1a colada mix over crushed ice. For a $12 drink, you would think they would take the 30 seconds to blend it! Nope. My friends and I were saying that we wouldn't be surprised if the drinks were pre-made and kept in huge tubs; where the waiters would ladle into a bowl with ice when an order is up.\n\nEven though we just had dinner, we thought ordering something salty would help the drinks go down better BUT $14 for four cha siu baos (bbq pork buns)?! WTF, I could uber it to Chinatown and back, and get half a dozen for that price. I'm sure it would taste better too. Instead, we opted to get $6 bottled beers to chase down our awful drinks that we never finished.\n\nFor legit tiki cocktails at half the price, hit up Smuggler's Cove (Hayes Valley), Tiki Haven (Sunset) or Trad'r Sam's (Richmond).\n\nNow for the service. For a \"world renowned\" hotel, I expected the service to match. Instead, service was that of a stereotypical Chinese restaurant. Sh*tty. Before I can even put my purse down as we were seated, our waiter curtly asked, \"ready to order\"? Slow your roll, homie. Once we ordered our drinks, he just plopped it on the table and went MIA. The staff clearly have been working there for decades and have lost every incentive to provide good customer service. Yay, unions!\n\nSo why three stars?\n\nTonga Rooms is one of those place you have to experience once in your life. It's hella cheesy and hella overpriced, but hella entertaining. The floating live band and the crowd were Tonga Room's saving grace. The upbeat band did an awesome job singing renditions of top hits from Prince, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Pharrell, and Bruno Mars. \n\nThe older crowd was eclectic and very fun. The table next to us was celebrating a 40th birthday and birthday boy was on a mission...OPERATION: GET SMASHED. He put several straws together and managed to drink from our punch bowl: http://bit.ly/1tFBQZY. He then went around to other tables and did the same. Total beast.  \n\nMad props to the older Asian ladies who were getting down on the dance floor. There was one in a tight white dress flossing \"Hollywood\" stunna shades from the 80's movie Mannequin: http://yhoo.it/1pCyeYp.

Definitely unique! Located inside an unassuming Fairmont Hotel in downtown, you walk in and are transported to Gilligan's Island meets hyped up Techno club! \n\nThe scenery is the bomb - from people watching, to all of the palm trees, flaming tiki torches, the cool \"lake\" in the center that houses the floating stage the band plays cheesy cover songs from - complete with the occasional rain shower and thunder that you would expect in the tropics! Don't worry, you won't get wet...it only rains over the lake...well, I guess unless you fall in! People seem to really like the specialty libations offered and are not shy at all about getting their groove on and letting loose island style! \n\nOur small group landed a table for 4 located in prime real estate. Wait staff is amazingly attentive! Had to try the Lava concoction for 2. Not sure exactly what was in it, but I'm sure it included some kind of rum...aka love punch.

Wine not cheap.. $11-20 per glass, and hardly any vegan food options.  We got veggie pot-stickers and veggie spring rolls, which I HOPE were vegan but in a dark, loud restaurant with a slight language barrier with the waiter it was hard to find out.  My friend ordered us the fried rice, and asked them to leave out all egg and meat, and it arrived full of egg.  I told them just to leave it and I would try to eat around the egg, and later I also thought of the fact that it might have been cooked in butter instead of oil.  The waiter brought a surprise salad covered in non-vegan creamy dressing to try to make up for it.  I gave that to my friends since I couldn't eat it.  We also ordered edamame which came covered in some kind of mayonnaise (mayo is full of egg), and I didn't remember seeing this specified on the menu.  So overall, it's not very vegan-friendly.  They tried, sort of, but the staff needs to be better educated on being sensitive and aware of dietary needs because I'm not a fan of purchasing food I can't eat.

Check: 6789)  I was waiting at the bar with my dad, ready to order drinks. It wasn't too busy when I got there. The bartender (the only Asian bartender, couldn't see his name on tag) then came up to our side of the bar and I began to order. Immediately he threw his hand in the air gave me the worst attitude and said, \"Excuse me! I'm taking their order first,\" in a completely condescending tone. He then proceeded to ignore me and take the order of a group of blonde women to my right (who btw, arrived AFTER me). First of all, I was there first. I was in no way trying to grab his attention in a rudely manner. I only spoke up and ordered because I knew it was my turn and everyone else at the bar knew I was next in line as well. Even the group of blondes he served instead apologized to me for the rude bartender's attitude. It wasn't even that busy to begin with! How can you not know who comes next?? Finally another bartender, Matthew E, came over and asked for our order. He literally saved this review from being a one star rating. He got our order correctly and even threw in an iced coffee. Thank you, Matthew E for the great service!

So we stepped in line\n\n2) We painfully watched the doorman awkwardly tell people \"no you cannot meet your party inside unless we can prove you are a part of their party\" - \"no you cannot come in unless you have a reservation, please stand in line\" - \"no no no no no\"  for about 40 minutes\n\n3) At the 40 minute mark the woman asks \"who would like to sit in the bar area at a table for two and we said \"yes!\" She takes us to a sticky table next to the busy bar area and the server hands us two bar menus. We had been looking over the full menu in line and asked if we could order from that menu. The server told us no, that the bar area had a bar menu with plenty of good options.\n\n4) I walk back to the hostess and told her that when we were seated, she did not explain that we would not get the full menu. She said \"this line is for the bar - if you want to sit at the bar, that is the only menu available\" wait - what? I explained to her that the doorman told us that this line was for people who did not have a reservation - not specifically the bar. She said \"no one in line will be seated at a table because we have a lot of reservations - this is only for the bar\" I WISH you all would have explained that one hour ago.\n\nOn top of that there was an extra $10-$20 (i cant remember) to be in the band's presence while we ate. No thanks - I will NEVER be back to this poorly ran establishment.\n\nOh - and we left - we didn't eat there and never will so no comment on food", "author": "Jazmyn W."}

Why does a beautiful historic hotel at the top of an SF hill have a basement tiki bar? Because someone there was/is a genius I guess. They took the hotel pool in the basement and put a floating stage on it, and made it rain around the edges (literally) and filled the surrounding room with palm trees and put a bar in and a bunch of tables and high tops.... and Tadah! Tonga! I'm not sure I would ever dine there, it's a little damp and basementy, but it's so freaking fun and over the top to go for drinks. Walk into the glorious art deco hotel lobby, find your way downstairs and to the right and follow the signs for the Tonga room and then boom, basement theme bar. Everybody Tonga.\n\n(I actually started out at 3 stars for this one, but then I remembered how freaking amazing the band doing covers on a floating stage on the pool was in the rain and I bumped it up just for them.

So at 6:30 we walked right up to the hostess and were seated at a beautiful table near the water. \n\nWe ordered the Pu Pu Platter to start and it was excellent! The chicken legs were tasty and had a bit of a bite to them so they were definitely one of my favorites. The ribs were a bit on the salty side but quite meaty, egg rolls were solid (filled with portabellas), and the crab rangoons were actually quite tasty considering I'm usually not a fan of those. I LOVED the three sauces they served on the side: plum sauce, chili sauce, and hot mustard. They were super yummy!\n\nFor dinner we ordered the Huli Huli Chicken, the Kalua Pork, Forbidden Rice blend, and the grilled asparagus. Everything was tasty but the portions were huge so watch out! I enjoyed the chicken the most because the meat was tender and it had a nice mix of veggies in a sweet, tangy sauce. The Kalua pork was pretty good but it tasted better with the addition of some of the side sauces because the meat was a tiny bit on the dry side. The asparagus was perfectly cooked and the Forbidden rice blend was excellent; a nice change from the usual plain white rice. \n\nI was super full and didn't want dessert but my parents wanted to try something so they ordered the banana split (which is supposed to be for 4-6 people). IT WAS MASSIVE. There was no way we could finish but we did our best; all the ice creams/sorbets were delicious, but I enjoyed the mango the best. We also asked for the sauces on the side (chocolate, strawberry, caramel) which was perfect because it kept the ice creams safe and each person could add as much as they wanted. \n\nService was great, and it was a lot of fun to listen to the band which started playing at 8 PM.

My boyfriend's parents were staying at the Fairmont and looking for a pre-dinner drink when we decided to head downstairs to the Tonga Room. Walking in this place is pretty cool, yes, cheesy, but the fact that you are literally underground in what used to be the pool for the hotel they have done a good job of renovating it into a tiki bar/pirate ship.  I actually prefer this spot to Smugglers Cove as there is was more seating and a nicer space. Slightly reminiscent to my childhood days at Walt Disney World and the Pirate ship attraction... but with booze!\nWe were able to grab some seats by the pool and shared the Smuggles Golden Punch Bowl for Two ($22).  It was not overly sweet and ginger/yellow chartreuse were a nice balance with the rum.  The server was a bit busy and neglectful, but it seemed that she was the only one working in a pretty full bar/restaurant area so that was understandable.  This is not the kind of place where I would go on the reg, but bringing out of town guests (who are paying) is a different story!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-09", "description": "So I am a big tiki drink culture fan. For about a year, we were even lucky enough to have a tiki bar in Charlotte; Tiki Hideaway. Unfortunately, I think it was a bit too hidden away and alas, it is no more. So, last weekend while in San Francisco, I hit up three tiki bars, Tonga being one of them. It was on my radar for awhile so me, my husband and brother and sister in law hit it up on Friday night over Labor Day weekend. This place gets crazy busy! Loved it. Its what you might expect that it is in the basement of the gorgeous Fairmont Hotel. When you get to the bar, you see the water features, are greeted by a large tiki god and the bar has all the fresh citrus and frills you want. We stood at the surfboard shaped table since there wasn't much seating (that was not a table) ad enjoyed 2 drinks each. The 2nd round consisted of a mai tai which was very nice and easy to drink, a hurricane, which is not a tiki drink in my opinion but the best drink of the night, and two smuggler's, which is a recipe from my all time favorite tiki bar Smuggler's Cove (also in San Francisco). We also shared a communal punch that hit the spot too. \nHow can you go wrong with tiki!? It just makes you happy and possibly a bit giggly. Now go already!", "author": "Emily P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-05", "description": "Had heard about this place on the Travel Channel's - 'Anthony Bourdain's-'The Layover-San Francisco' and hiked up Powell Street from Union Square to the posh Nob Hill neighborhood to check out this historic\u00a0hotel, and home to the infamous Tonga Room: Hawaiian Restaurant and Bar. \nTo give just a little backstory on the history of this amazing building I was interested in its original owners the Fair sisters, who have a Rhode Island connection where I live. (See this info later in the review.)\nThe Tonga Room is located in the hotel's basement, or what they call the 'Terrace Level.' The 75-foot pool was added in 1929 and dubbed the Fairmont Terrace Plunge. In 1945 the hotel hired well-known Metro Goldwyn Mayer's set designer Mel Melvin to create a tiki-style themed experience. It does not disappoint. The pool is surrounded by bamboo railings and Tiki tables and kitschy art work and accents. You feel like you're in a 1950's Hawaiian bar....  or quite possibly on the set of Gilligan's Island. Riggings on the perimeter of the dance floor create the feeling of being on a schooner, and apparently the dance floor was constructed of wood from the S.S. Forester, a schooner that once sailed back and forth between San Francisco and Hawaii. Every half hour or so rain falls from the ceiling creating a humid air reminiscent of the South Pacific.  Thunder erupts from somewhere in the corner of the room. It's just plain fun!\nThe band, the Island Groove Band that I saw on Friday night are really entertaining. They perform on a slowly floating barge in the middle of the pool. Playing everything from 1970's Creedence Clearwater Revival's 'Lookin' Out my Back Door,' to 1985's hit 'Kyrie, 'Lionel Richie's classic 'All Night Long' to the more contemporary Michael Buble's 'Sway.'Giving waves and shout outs to the many tourists and locals alike throughout the sets, they're the perfect band for this setting.\nA fruity Scorpian or Lava bowl is a must if you're going to really take the plunge. Not cheap, but well worth the experience. The glass wear is of course voodoo themed & coconut shaped and 1950's style glasswear, just classic! We did not eat here, but there was a wait for dining and there seemed to be numerous couples, and larger parties dining there. One was a large group with a couple celebrating their 50th anniversary. Though they had mentioned a $10 dollar cover we decided to wait for a table at no charge and then somehow they said just told us to head into the bar at no cost. Dress code seems to be dressy casual. After all, this is the Fairmont. The Venetian Room right upstairs is most famous as the place in which Tony Bennett first sang 'I Left My Heart in San Francisco.'\nSpeaking of the Fairmont, let's get back to the history of this amazing property. Built in 1902 by female architect Julia Morgan, the first female graduate of Paris's  E'Cole Des Beaux Arts the lobby of this property is on par with architecture in Europe.  According to the Fairmont's web site. ...'It was already completed, and the interior furnishings had been delivered and were awaiting their various places in this Palace on Nob Hill. The hotel had just been sold on April 6th, less than two weeks before the conflagration that was to all but level the City. The story however, goes back earlier than that. Tessie and Virginia Fair were the daughters of James Graham Fair, one of San Francisco's wealthiest citizens. 'Bonanza Jim' had struck it rich in a Nevada Silver mine, and his daughters were determined to construct a grand monument to their father, who had passed away in 1894. In 1902, construction began on The Fairmont Hotel, but by 1906, it had become too much of a burden for the Fair sisters, and they sold it to the Law brothers, Herbert and Hartland, in exchange for two existing office buildings at Mission and New Montgomery streets. How could anyone know that the 'great San Francisco fire,' as locals referred to the disaster of the earthquake and what followed, was just days away.' While the Fairmont was shaken by the great quake, it faired better than much of SF that was devastated by fire. The sisters not only honored their father with the flagship for the Fairmont properties 'FairMont' atop this most scenic hill in SF, they also took some of his fortune and built Rosecliff Mansion built by McKim, Mead and White on Bellevue Avenue in Newport, RI.  Both were prominent society members on Bellevue Avenue. They both married well to New York society members Hermann Oelrich's,  and William Vanderbilt III. Oelrich of steamship fortune, and Vanderbilt heir to Steamship and Railroad fortunes.\nIf you like history and Scorpion bowls in an interesting setting, don't miss the Tonga Room!\nHistory pulled from of the Fairmont Hotel web site & Wikipedia.", "author": "M D."}

Maybe I'm just getting old but I got faded on the Smuggler Bowl.

I think because of their tiki themed setting, it makes it feel like you are in the Polynesian Islands. Their drinks are not bad, but I think you paying for the environment than the drinks themselves. It does get a packed quite quickly so I HIGHLY recommend getting their early if you do not have a reservation. When I went, we had their buffet. I would say for a buffet I would give it a 5/10. For the price and what they are giving you, I thought it was ok. It wasn't anything great or special. Sadly, one of the good dishes, I believe it was the pork belly, was rarely refilled, which was quite disappointing. They would refill it once in a while, so they really limited you on what you could get. One complaint is that if this is a buffet and they are advertising it that way, they shouldn't be so skimpy on the food that they are providing for buffet and limiting patrons on getting \"cheaper\" food. \n\nAlso, be aware of their \"cover charge\". They have live musician play and out of the blue they will charge you a cover charge on top of your meal. That was also another thing that I wasn't to please about was how they sabotaged you into paying cover charge for their musicians. It forced us, at least, to eat faster and get out of there, so that we would have to pay to cover charge. We really weren't able to enjoy our time there. \n\nIf I remember correctly the cover charge is like $10 per person on top of all the food and drinks you purchased. Kind of ridiculous! \n\nOther than that, I think this is a good one time experience and I do not plan to come here again.", "author": "Rob F."}

Ok, sounds fair. When arrived, placed my name on waitlist  with hostess(blond hair) and was told I will received a text and wait is about an hour. No problem, so we walked around for approximately an hour and waiting for the text. \nWent back approximately an hour and the time was 9:45pm. The hostess was no where to be found,waited 5 more mins and the hostess came back. We told her we were placed on the wait list and she looked and was like,oh, I can seat you guys now. (She totally forgot to call us!) \nAfter we sat down, it was slightly pass 10p and I also have been here I've before and knew we were sat at the appetizer table and no entrees are served there. I walked up to the hostess and asked her if we can get the food menu. Her response was,we stop serving food at 10. I was appalled this lady didn't in any way let us be aware of such important policy that no entree is served after 10! That's the whole idea of our reservation,is to enjoy the food and entertainment,and not pay $15 cover fee to sit and have appetizer. She immediately saw how pissed I was and offered me to speak with the manager Kristen Carter. She was young and experienced and basically said the same thing her hostess said,\"we stop serving food at 10.\" I asked her if you trained your staff to tell your \"customers\" that when we placed our name to let them know entrees stops serving at 10? Her response was yes, so why am I just being told? She replied with the same answer, we stop serving food at 10 and that's our policy. \n\nI was not only hungry and upset,but we had visitors coming from overseas Europe and was disappointed at the way we were treated. We stopped by to get some Korean BBQ afterwards thank god and was served much better.\n\nI hope the management team at the Fairmont Hotel is aware of how horrible the food service department is,in particular, the manager Kristen Carter.

So we had to wait another hour until we were finally seated. So pretty much if you have ATT sit in the lobby until a table opens up because if not you're not getting a table.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-15", "description": "Try Tonga Room at least once in your life but keep in mind that it's wildly overpriced and the food and drinks are really just so-so. It's a historical institution when it comes to tiki bar history and I'm glad they continue to exist for that reason (there was a time when Tonga Room's continued existence was in doubt). \n\nBut like I said, overpriced. You're basically paying up the wazoo to have the experience of being there. At the same time, it's a genuinely \"only in San Francisco\" experience. A tiki-themed restaurant/bar with a swimming pool in the center, with faux thunder/rain storms at regular intervals? \n\nYup, that's Tonga Room in a nutshell.\n\nCheck it off your tiki bar bucket list if you must, but keep in mind that San Francisco has two other tiki bars that are vastly superior to Tonga Room: Pagan Idol and Smuggler's Cove. No, they don't have the historical cachet of Tonga but their drinks, pricing and overall experience are much better than what Tonga has to offer. And I daresay, they are also both legitimate \"only in San Francisco\" experiences. \n\nMy most recent visit to Tonga Room was a couple of days ago. My mom was in town for a quick vacation; she'd heard about Tonga from her SF-transplant buddies and insisted that we go. We ended up doing a mini tiki bar crawl since her time in SF was limited and we were on foot. Since Pagan Idol is nearby and opens an hour earlier, we started there and then headed off to Tonga. \n\nI wish there was a way we could have reversed the order because Pagan Idol is much better, but it opens an hour earlier and fills up fast. Tonga was a letdown for both of us after visiting Pagan Idol (one I knew would happen because I've been to both places before). We're saving Smuggler's Cove (which I've also visited multiple times) for her next visit.\n\nWe both ordered daiquiris, a tiki bar standard, but an off-menu item at Tonga. They were priced at $15 each and were mediocre. Pagan Idol's daiquiri is currently $10  but it is *so* good that it sets the benchmark for me for daiquiris and I've yet to try a better one. I like ordering classic daiquiris when I can because they're a good test of a bartender's skill set and whether or not a bar is using quality ingredients. \n\nThough a simple drink on paper (a classic daiquiri is just rum, lime and simple syrup), you can end up with something sublime (good rum, fresh lime juice and properly balanced flavors can make a daiquiri one of the best and smoothest cocktails ever) or you can end up with something that makes it clear that they're just \"phoning it in\" so to speak (bad rum, lime juice from a bottle, and poor flavor balance). Tonga Room's daiquiris fell into the latter category. They were drinkable but that's about it. They tasted \"strong\", but not in a good way. More like in they were using poor-quality ingredients and it showed. \n\nAs for the food (we were in the bar area and not the restaurant proper, BTW), we only ordered one thing, the fried shrimp and cilantro rolls (both of us were too stuffed from eating so much great food all week to eat anything else). They were tasty enough but not memorable at all and like the drinks, overpriced. We enjoyed them well enough in the moment, though. \n\nI'll continue to indulge out of town guests who want to visit Tonga Room but I'll tell them there are better spots that are more worthy of their time and money (and I won't return on my own). However, like I said earlier, I'm glad Tonga continues to exist. It would be a huge loss if they closed down, both for SF and for tiki bar history in general. \n\nI do think they're resting on their laurels a bit since they're far more well known by out of town visitors. And maybe that's a good thing. Pagan Idol and Smuggler's Cove fill up too quickly as it is. That said, if Tonga Room has any interest in being a proper stop in a tiki bar crawl, they should consider opening their doors at 3pm. The experience will only build up from there and I think they would be looked back upon more fondly if considered in a historical context.", "author": "Maya B."}

I was trying to coordinate a large group on a Saturday so I was worried we would be turned away. We lucked out and got there before the large crowds, around 8pm, when the band started, and we were able to stand around the bar just fine. Drinks are expensive but well-mixed and strong. \n\nSome helpful tips: \n- Band starts at 8pm. If you just want to stand by the bar, there's no cover. If you want a table, there's a $10 cover after 8pm. \n- Sharing a scorpion bowl,or any bowl, is more cost effective with one other person, if you're planning on drinking several. \n-My coworkers were able to find parking, but it is not easy. There's basically no easy way to get up the giant hill ,except the trolley. It's overpriced, but a nice tourist attraction. If you're taking public transit, be prepared to use those calf muscles and stop after each block to catch your breath. \n\nI'd like to come back here with my grandparents and try some of the food.

Once you're inside standing at the bar a server will come by which is nice. Do not order the pina colada! I'm not entirely sure how they make theirs but it tastes very chemically. I think it may be the low grade mix they use. As a reference, the blended coladas in Las Vegas that are served in those tacky glasses are miles better than these. So before my drink came I went to the men's room. When I walked in I was blown away by the odor. I won't provide more details than that. While I was drying my hands the toilet flushes and the guy came out who was an obvious employee there due to the uniform. Made a B line past the sink and went out the door. WTF???? When I came back I had my drink ready which I sent back after other people tried it. They were also shocked at the drinks chemically taste. Got a mai tai instead. Not too bad.

Tonga Room is one of the longstanding tiki bars in the city, located within the Fairmont and very popular with tourists. There's a cover charge of $7 on Friday and Saturdays for live entertainment.\n\nHow does it compare to other tiki bars in the city? It's very spacious, plenty of table seating, and setup to host events as the space was converted from a swimming pool in 1945. The live band stage in the middle of the water moves back and forth during a performance which is pretty cool. Just be careful not to get too tipsy near the edge of the dance floor and fall in, they'll tell the bar to stop serving alcohol until whomever is kicked out.\n\nBesides being spacious, there's only ONE bar located near the entrance that has two overwhelmed bartenders working hard to keep up with demand. The midsize bar itself is open seating but the bar tables adjacent are all reserved even though no one ever came during the last hour the bar was open, but the servers would gladly remind you to keep off if you try.\n\nAmbiance isn't as tacky compared to smaller tiki bars in the city (ie: Bamboo Hut) but it's also not as charming compared to a medium size tiki bar like Smuggler's Cove.\n\nDrinks: You can expect the usual selection for a tiki bar, think rum. The highlights of course being the three punch bowls available, served in either two or four person sizes. It's $20-22 a punch bowl for two people, or $32-34 for the four person size. The standard scorpion bowl and volcano owl are offered which are good choices. I also tried the unique Smuggler's bowl which tasted a bit like sweet and sour, not a fan. Top shelf cocktails are $13.\n\nHappy hour buffet & drink deal for $10 sounds pretty sweet, maybe worth another visit on Wed-Friday.\n\nAll around touristy spot and it closes early on weekends at 12:30, so if you're looking to continue the tiki bar partying, make sure you know the alternatives!", "author": "Steven C."}

Let me tell you my story.\n\nI called them on Sept. 22 and left a voice message asking for them to call me back to set up a large reservation for a birthday party. Danielle called back the next day. It was a 5 minute call where we set up the details (20 people on Friday, October 9). Never once did she mention a set group menu with a minimum cost. Danielle said to expect a contract in my email, I said okay.\n\nThe next day, 9/24, I still hadn't gotten the email, so I called and left a voice message. I then called again FIVE MORE TIMES, leaving voice messages every time. I called on 9/30, 10/1, 10/2, and 10/5. Each time I left my phone number and email address.\n\nFinally, on Tuesday, 10/6, three days before the party, she emailed me. This is when she told me about the fixed menu and the price minimum. She called me the next day, and I told her it was too high ($70/person, not including alcohol), and she said she'd talk to the chefs to negotiate something lower. This apparently wasn't possible. It wasn't possible to get a cheaper menu, or for 2 people to share a plate. She is telling me TWO DAYS before an event I reserved nearly THREE WEEKS IN ADVANCE, that it is $70/head, not including alcohol, non-negotiable. Oh, and we can only have the table for 1.5 hours.\n\nFrom this experience, I can say that the reservation staff (Danielle & co.) at the Tonga Room are incompetent (can't write down a phone number or spell an email address correctly), provide horrible customer service (don't call back, unwilling to compromise for large groups), are disrespectful (see above), and are an embarrassment to Fairmont Hotels.\n\nNeedless to say, I cancelled the reservation.

The place hasn't changed much since it was originally converted from the hotel's pool to a restaurant, exception for the addition of the rainstorms.  Man, Rainforest Cafe really stole then broadly commercialized that touch, huh?\n\nThe only thing I've had at Tonga has been the drinks, so we can start there.  My absolute favorite, as an eternal fan of cherry flavor and gin, is the Singapore Sling.  I could list the ingredients, but anyone coming here expecting anything but tropical drinks is sorely misguided, so we can leave the description at \"fruity but definitely alcoholic\".  The Mai Tai, obviously, is also a draw, and the punchbowls are more than enough to share with someone else.  The bartenders are quite knowledgeable across the board and I've had some good conversations with them about the differences in their rums, which I don't drink very often.  Really, you can't go wrong with their drinks.\n\nI've not had any food here, but I have seen a buffet set up by the pool on more than one occasion, and it certainly smelled good if that counts for anything.  I believe it's mostly asian-based cuisine, which would fit in with the tiki style.\n\nThere are plenty of things Tonga can improve upon, but I think this is a case of \"why mess with a classic?\" in many regards.  Best time to come is right at opening (5 pm) on a weekday to avoid too big of a crowd, but don't get dismayed if you have to wait a bit for a table or a drink.

It seems to me that the default mode of appreciating this place should be the ironic one: it's often loaded with tons of upper/ middle class white tourists and bro-ish types, all of which (if they have any humanity in them) enter the place gawkingly, astounded (as they should be) by the utter bizarre beauty of this secret(ish) Tikitopia; the band plays on its boat a wide range of songs from a sort of Santana-ish position- and they're solid. They're really good. Because of them my partner and I's new song is Toto's \"Africa,\" specifically the Tongo Room's house band's version of it; the dance floor is an exact replica of some fabulous pirate ship deck, and on it there is to be found a high rate of spontaneous line dancing to a large number of very non-country sounding songs- this last time I visited said line dances were sort of defacto lead by this ancient Chinese man who could out dance just about everybody there. But I don't believe that this place can only be appreciated as such (in the ironic mode): my partner and I have been returning to this place on an almost monthly basis, and that's because it is simply a place to earnestly have fun: to dance, chat with tourists who are only in town for 15 minutes, taste the rainbow, etc.\n\nSo: I don't care about comparing the quality of juice-based cocktails sucked through a five-foot straw out of an actual flaming pineapple because let's face it: you're sucking a juice-based cocktail through a five-foot straw out of an actual flaming pineapple and that's amazing. \n\nOn a serious note, I really really want to commend both the head waiter who attended to my partner and I's party of fourteen at the very back of the club during this last visit: he was communicative, attentive, polite, and helped wade through the chaos of splitting a check 30 ways at the end of the night. Similarly the two hostesses that assisted us were really very helpful and amazing: they helped me welcome and escort our trickling guests in to the table, and they helped us find a dance club that was open later as we left at the end of the night. \n\nAll said: this place is amazing. If you've never gone, you should, at least once in your miserable too-cool-for-tiki-bars-life, and if you have gone, you should go back and tip your servers as much as humanly possible. xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo\n\nPS I would totally recommend reserving a table- the bar can get really bogged down and chaotic, and there's not many places to sit if you don't have one. xoxo", "author": "Joshua A."}

In hindsight I am glad we were there so early because by the time the joint opened there was a decent sized line of people waiting to get in and within 30 minutes of opening the joint was packed!

But alas, the atmosphere can't be overlooked and the live music was undeniably outstanding.

At first, it was very complicated to communicate with this restaurant. I was calling to tell them I will be ten minutes late due to traffic. I was so nervous my table I reserved will be given to someone else. I was upset coming into the place. The place itself is so beautiful and breath taking. I was happy I still had my table I reserved but a bit disappointed that it was not the table I really wanted. I wanted next to the water next to the live music especially for it being over a month reservation. It was still a good view just difficult to take pictures without someone being in the picture. The waiter we had was so nice and friendly and helped us out with our decisions and picture taking. The food is incredible!!There was no left over to take home. The drinks are pricey but worth it. It is really strong! It is  a kick every sip. The live music was the cherry on top! The band played good music and very upbringing. It had me dancing in my seats even though I wanted to stand up and dance. I think if the seating arrangement were spaced out I could dance without being in someone way. At the end, I talked to the manager and she was really nice and understood my concerns. She helped me for future help. Overall, really good place to go to. I am coming back with family and friends.

We had been to the Tonga room maybe 15 years prior and I thought the kids would get a kick out of the place.  \n\nI went in expecting fairly lame food but top-notch drinks, a-la the \"Trader Vics\" that recently closed in Los Angeles.  Exactly the opposite happened.\n\nThe food was surprisingly good. And the drinks were simply terrible.  \n\nWe had some Khalua Pig and ribs. Both were very solid - liked by all 4 of us.\n\nMy wife ordered a Pina Colada and I had a Fog Cutter. Now I loooove strong drinks so I'm not saying they were too strong, but there was nothing to balance the alchohol at all. We might as well have ordered rum on the rocks. The pina colada wasn't blended either. It was rum and a tiny bit of juice and maybe some coconut milk on ice. It was terrible.  My fog cutter was just rum and some cheap acidic mixer. I decided to give them another chance and order a Mai Tai.  It was so bad, I didn't finish it.\n\nThe Tonga room gets high marks for decor and atmosphere and decent food. I only wished I had known that the nearby Smugglers Cove was the Spirited Awards winner of Best American Cocktail Bar 2016. I would have gone there instead.\n\nAlso, they start charging a $7 cover charge at 7pm.  We arrived at 7:30 and paid the cover. But the band didn't start playing until about 8:20 !!! We heard three songs before we had to leave.  I thought it was pretty crappy of them to let the band sit there quietly for an hour while the cover-paying customers listened to their ipod playlist.\n\nBad drinks and mistakes like that, combined with Yelp, will put you out of business.", "author": "Dave S."}

It filled up very quickly. By 5:10 all the bar area tables were taken so many people were standing at the actual bar. I ordered a Mai Tai ($10) which was very good and quite strong and my husband ordered a Kona Longboard ($5). We had a problem with a cracked glass and it was fixed immediately by a bus boy. We ordered garlic edamame beans, pork Shumai and vegetable pot stickers. All very good! My one complaint about the pork was it was a little fatty (which I am picky about) so it had some chewy parts that I didn't eat. Other than that, we cleaned our plates.

The drinks are watered down and come in fun but tacky drinking glasses. When you arrive you get \"laid\", at the front door, but let's be PG here people. I'm talking about the lays you get when you arrive in Hawaii. Oh and did I mention there a love band playing all the hits from the 70's and 80's!\n\nBut despite all of that the Tonga room can be really fun and enjoyable if you let it. I'm a firm believer that It's all about the energy and the kind of people you surround yourself with. Those are key factors in making any situation fun. Outside of the atmosphere, including the live band and the simulated rain falls from the ceiling, the scorpion bowls are most likely the highlight of you're experience here. But there are other drinks worth trying like: the Singapore sling ($12), and the zombie ($12).\n\nAs for the food, as I said earlier it's delicious and comes in at reasonable price point. I loved the ceviche ($14) an appetizer served with fresh fish from south America. When you combine that with the fresh tomatoes, pepper and guacamole, it was so tasty. \n\nAs for the main courses. I've had a few of them and enjoy most of them. The sea bass, pouched in butter as well as the hot pot served with peppers and a tasty spicy sauce, as well as the Pork Loin ($29). All in all the worst thing about the Tonga room I would say is finding park. In Nob hill it's almost in possible, unless you park in a garage. But just be careful because most of the garages close at 10pm. Which is very odd because you would think they would stay open late for people who wanna party in that area.", "author": "Donald W."}

It's pricey, but not one of those spots you'd go to every week (well on my budget at least). Came here with some buddies after going to a convention for a week to kind of wind down. The place has a nice Tiki/Hawaiian theme without being too overly corny. The front section is a first come first serve spot with a bar and a few tables for bar food. We had a reservation for four and were able to sit down already at our table. Our waiter was fantastic and very friendly. The water in the middle was awesome with the fake rain and lightening. There's also a band that plays later on a floating boat, but we left before this happened (shucks!). We ordered some calamari for appetizers which was great. We shared a Scorpion Bowl which was great (and a bit strong haha). I ordered the Kahlua Pulled Pork and it was very tender and I enjoyed the fact an over easy egg was on top with rice. We all shared a Tropical Banana Split at the end which was just fantastic too! It had a mix of sherbet and ice creams which really compliments everything. Overall, it was fun it had great food and a nice atmosphere. The plates are about $30 bucks a plate so keep that in mind.

And when I say my friends I mean there were 20+ of us. So the fact that management didn't just round us up and kick us out, I appreciated. \n\nWe were getting down and dirty on the dance floor surrounded by several patrons who were elderly and dressed very nicely (we had just come from class and were not dressed nicely). At one point a drink was dropped and shattered, but they came and cleaned it up for us, once again, without kicking us out.\n\nI set my drink on the railing while I was dancing and a server took it away even though it was only half done. I told a manager and he got me a new one, no charge.\n\nAll night we were staring at the swimming pool daring ourselves to jump in. Well, one of my friends finally got brave (and drunk enough) stripped down to his skivvies and canon balled in. Swam around for a while, dancing to the band. Employees were waiting for him with a table cloth on the other end, but they at least let him put his pants on before tossing him out on the street and didn't call the police.\n\nSo if I am out with a wild group who wants to shake their tail feathers, I will probably end up at the Tonga Room again.

This review starts with 5 stars...\n\nTonga Bar is located on the terrace level at the Fairmont so you can take the elevator down. Once there, just follow the signs down the hallways. You're greeted at the door and asked if you have reservations. I recommend making reservations especially if you go in a popular weeknight/weekend. Outside there is a sign that says $7 as a live entertainment fee, but does not specify for who. The lady did mention to the party in front of us that there was a charge, but they were going to the bar. We were not notified of this charge. \n\nAmbiance: you walk in and the bar area, which is a good size, is on the right. Right in front of the the bar is a dance floor and the \"pool\" with the boat which has the live entertainers is in front of the dance floor. All around the \"pool\" are tables. Once in a while, there's rain that falls around the pool. Kinda cool. The lights are dim and the place feels welcoming. The entertainers are pretty good-sing a variety of songs/make you wanna dance. Good job with the atmosphere Tonga. Review stays at 5 stars. \n\nFood and drinks: We didn't have much to choose from as the boy is a vegetarian, so we started with the jade dumplings and shared an entree: thai green curry with a side of the forbidden blend fried rice. I really liked the dumplings and would recommend those. The rice was ok. It was a little hard for my liking. The thai green curry...nasty. There was no flavor and not enough curry. It was nowhere what I'm used too when I have curry at Thai restaurants. Drinks: we got pineapple royale which comes in a pineapple and was the better of the two drinks. Also got this creamy looking drink-nasty as shit. Tasted like coconut oil. We couldn't even drink it and just had them take it away. -1.5 stars for food and drinks. \n\nWhat I didn't like was the fact that they charged $7 per person for the live entertainment. If you have customers come for the bar area only, I can understand the fee, but for customers who are there to dine at your establishment, with your prices, you shouldn't charge them an entertainment fee. As a restaurant, you are providing the entertainment for your customers and they shouldn't be responsible to pay for it. Instead, have a place where they can tip the entertainers. -2 stars\n\nI wouldn't come back here and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.", "author": "Puja K."}

Christine immediately corrected me on the manliness of tiki drinks, explaining their history and association with returning troops from the war.  Props.  I stand corrected.\n\nThe next hour in between other patrons Christine continued educating me on the tiki cocktails and the recent changes at the Tonga Room, remaking the drink menus and shifting to only the best top shelf ingredients and freshest fruits and juices.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-18", "description": "I thought it was Disneyland, but the Tonga room is the most magical place on earth.  Why is it so magical? Well, one of the reasons is that my Grandmother used to come here.  Opened in 1945, this is truly a San Francisco gem.  Before it was the Tonga room, it was the indoor pool of the Fairmont hotel, a favorite of old time movie stars.\n\nAnother reason the Tonga room is so magical?  Fake rainstorms and a barge-bound lagoon band.  The night that we went the band played older lounge-y songs from the 1970s like Copacabana, to which I oddly knew all of the words and was more than happy to sing along.  After dinner we even danced on the ship-like dance floor.  That doesn't happen at most dinner spots nowadays.  \n\nI came here on a surprise date night with my husband.  Fortunately, I had a reservation.  Otherwise there would have been a line.  Or perhaps the line was for the bar?  In any case, my husband's excitement was matched only by my own.  The combination of over the top kitsch (including fake rain storms, palm trees, and aforementioned boat-like dance floor) with tasty fruit salad garnished bowls of alcohol makes the Tonga room an instant favorite.  We can't wait to go back and to bring our out of town guests to the Tonga room.  Especially the next time my Grandma comes to visit.\n\nAs for the food, it wasn't great.  I don't care.  FIVE STARS.  The food wasn't amazing, but it wasn't awful, and it was somewhat overpriced.  I am still excited to try their happy hour appetizer buffet. \n\nMostly though, I can't wait to go back to the Tonga room for the shear child-like happiness that it brings me to be surrounded by faux Polynesian awesomeness and live barge music with a big bowl of fruity alcohol covered in tiny umbrellas.", "author": "Nicolette W."}

But a bunch of friends suggested we go and try their restaurant. I think we tried to make a reservation a week before and they said they were full. We went early on a Saturday night around 6 and were seated right away. It was actually pretty empty inside. Not sure why they said they weren't taking reservations anymore. There was a line out the door but we think that was for the bar area. The bar area is not very big but great if you just want drinks. Not sure if you have to order food if you get seated in the restaurant. But we actually came for food so it wasn't a problem for us. We started with a pupu platter. I wasn't super hungry so I didn't really try anything on the pupu platter.  I maybe had one chicken wing and it was ok. For my main entr\u00e9e, I had the steamed Hawaiian walu. It's a white fish with tomatoes, hearts of palm, and shrimp in a coconut lychee broth. The portion size wasn't huge but it filled me up. And the price doesn't seem to match the portion size. But you're paying for the ambiance. For drinks I tried the Singapore Sling and the Zombie. I found the Zombie super strong and it had some passion fruit juice which is delicious. They had some pretty cool drinks include punch bowls with super long straws and drinks served in real pineapples. We stayed for quite awhile and they didn't kick us out when it got pretty busy later in the night. Also the band started playing on the raft in the middle of the \"pool\" area, probably around 8. I think they played for half hour sets and then took a half hour break and did this for the rest of the night. The band was great and started playing more and more upbeat and popular songs towards the end of the night. People were all singing along and it was just a lot of fun.

Her escapade! She met a few good men here too, no one to write home about as they all turned out to be !@#$% .\n\nI used to hangout here for their happy hour on Friday's after work. Back in the days, their 1/2 off drinks came with complimentary \"high noon\" dim sum for free. Yes, free, no charge. Today, they make you pull out extra dollars out of your pocket. Times have change. But hey, you know what they say, \"It's a free enterprise!\" :p\n\nI must say their drinks here though were sick especially their \"Mai Tai.\" That puppy will send you to the moon a few times if you're not careful. It's a kicker for sure and not a picker upper. Bring a friend with you if you're a lightweight. Their Pina Colada here was \"hella\" strong too and huge!! I always requested for an extra shot of rum and most of the staff here were always very accommodating.\n\nSpeaking of service, a good solid three star. I have to give them credit, they're pretty consistent at it.\n\nThe Tonga Room after 7PM is a full functioning romantic dinner for two after happy hour is long gone. It thunders and rains here on occasion (usually every half hour). There is a live band. They play mostly Hawaiian music with their stage being in the middle of the water. I am not sure if they still hit the tunes with \"Engelbert Humperdinck.\" I had to squeezed that in \"t'was\" my Mom's favorite, and still is!! Though the last time we went, the lead gentleman singer was belching Madonna \"Like a Virgin.\" It was a riot!! It just didn't fit!! LMAO I was petrified afterwards and that song with his voice got stuck in my head for days!!  WTF  LOL\n\nHowever, may I suggest skipping dinner here if you are a foodie and do yourself a favor and walk down a few blocks to E&O Asia Kitchen.  This place will make your mouth water with their seafood delights such as their Ahi Tuna, Salmon crudo on Himalayan salt block, and their infamous Indonesian Corn Fritters?

If you are planning to step out of the room, make sure to get a stamp on your wrist, otherwise they will make you wait for a host to be back. \nIt's a family friendly restaurant, so there are kids here and there. Some people are dressed up for a night out, some people are day time tourists. All in all, it's good balance. \nIf you want to check this place and just get a drink and see the rain and thunder (I was not impressed at all), I suggest skipping the line and going straight to the bar. There is a big standing area or dance floor if you want to practice your hula moves, and you will get a really good vibes on the band and the little pond.", "author": "Katie K."}

The cool atmosphere, tiki drinks, Polynesian food is just too unique and always transports me to somewhere tropcial. \n\nNestled within the historic Fairmont Hotel, this is one of the few Tiki bars in California. Decorated with sculptures, bamboo accents, and even a cerulean blue lagoon in the middle of space makes this one awesome place. \n\nWe came here on a Friday for their happy hour. Cheaper drinks, and they also had a buffet for $9.50 that included edamame, macaroni salad, chow mein, a coconut spam and bacon fried rice, as well as hot and honey wings. The fried rice was so good! A hint of coconut, a blend of jasmine and red rice, and the spam just made the whole dish even better. \n\nFor drinks, we got the Scorpion-comes in a bowl with cute umbrellas and pineapple as a garnish, and the Lava Bowl-rum mixed with fruit juices. They gave us extra long straws to savour these concoctions which made it extra fun.\n\nWe were also able to catch some of the live music that took place later on. It was very cool-the stage moved into the middle of the lagoon, a full band and a singer with a soothing voice singing classic jazz tunes. \n\nGood times.", "author": "Vincci L."}

This isn't a necessity, but it is if you want to get a table pool side. We arrived 20 mins early and were graciously escorted to wait in the bar and have a drink until our reservation got closer. No problem! I enjoyed that the bar isn't a free for all. The host makes sure there is room for you at the bar before escorting you. Some may see this as too organized, but I loved it. \n\nAn entire menu of rums! Delightful. I went with the Mt Gay rum... The obvious choice for my pina colada. Once we were seated, we ordered the Lava Bowl for two. Very strong, and very delicious. Comes with two obnoxiously long straws for you to sip from. The \"hurricane\" storms come every 20 mins, and adds to the spectacular 1970s aloha spirit of the place. Rain falls from the ceiling while thunder claps! Don't worry, you'll be protected by the 'authentic' thatched roof. \n\nWe ordered the Ohana meal- $56 per person. I highly recommend this because of the variety of food you get. Three different appetizers to try, three entrees, dessert, and coffee/tea. All the food was good- I especially appreciate the three dipping sauces each person gets for the appetizers. Hot mustard was... Hot! But oh so tasty on the egg roll! Prawns were perfectly cooked, and mahi mahi had a nice macadamia nut dressing with plantains on the side. \n\nThis is not an experience to be missed! The live band starts at 8pm.

The food was priced at premium but it was nothing special. If you're in the heart of San Fran, tango room is the not place to satisfy your taste buds. We tried the scallops and the bulgogi and they were both pretty flat/monotone in flavor. The coconut tuna poke was alright with the taro chips but it can actually do without the coconut, I think it was just a little sorry addition. \n\nThe worst part of all was the service. We waited 20 mins in line to get in for just cocktails. In a split second, we figured it's worth it to get a table for food after the long wait. The door staff gave us the hardest time even suggesting that we go back to the end of the line when we asked for a table. Long story short, they give us a table but now we experience such poor table service. We ask for water, didn't show until 15 mins or so later. Server dropped a fork, promised to get a new one but didn't show for another 15 mins.

Perfect for coconut lovers\n\nShiitake Egg Rolls - Loved that they included shiitake mushrooms\nCoconut Shell Poisson Cru - Tropical fish marinated in lime juice and coconut milk.

My impression after both those conversations was that we would get a table since we were hoping to eat early and were staying at the hotel. Nope!\n\nThe hostess surprised what the concierges had told me, and that they don't hold tables for hotel guests. Okay...weird...so then when I asked how long the table wait would be, she said they don't let you wait for a table, but the bar should be wide open at the time we requested, so to just come back and sit in there. That sounded like a reasonable approach to us.\n\nUntil we came back less than an hour later and there was over a 30 minute wait to get into the bar!\n\nListen - I don't mind having to wait, I know that sometimes good restaurants book up in advance.

It's a SF institution and is decorated like a tiki bar should be but it's really just a tourist trap with overpriced food & drinks. \n\nWe only wanted to share a drink and were not permitted to sit near the pool which we were told was reserved for diners only.  So we had to sit in the bar area near some noisy hipsters but we tried to make the best of it. Ordered the Lava Bowl for 2 which was a strong rum concoction of some sort that came in a bowl w/2 long straws. Service was ok.  Water & the drink was served promptly but they take your credit card to make sure you don't walk out b4 paying. The waitress had to squeeze by our table frequently to serve others so it wasn't hard to find her when we were ready to leave.\n\nTrader Vic's was THE premier tiki bar experience in SF but unfortunately it closed long ago.  The Tonga Room pales in comparison but it's the only high profile tiki bar spot left in the City.

You need to have a grotto-like bar and seating areas made of old ships.

The bartenders are always incredibly friendly and patient, as I'm sure they have to put up a ridiculous number of tourists acting a fool.

It is in Los Feliz, it is the size of a walk in closet and filled with rusty license plates of decades gone by along with a thick cloud of cigarette smoke thanks to some weird loophole in the California smoking ban.  San Francisco also has a tiki bar.  It is located underneath the 5 star Fairmont hotel.  It serves Asian fusion food.  It rains indoors.\n\nThis place is truly unbelievable.  For many reasons.  Let's discuss them.\n\nFirst off it is located under the Fairmont hotel.  This hotel is 5 star, gorgeous, filled with ornate furnishings and illustrious history.  And it has a freaking tiki bar underneath all this splendor.  How did this happen?  Decades ago the room that is now Tonga Room and Hurricane Bar was an indoor swimming pool for the guests of the hotel.  Think 1920's era.  From here the swimming pool morphed into Tonga Room.  But the swimming pool is still there.  In the middle of the restaurant.  With a mini floating barge thing that hosts live tropical bands.  Around every 30 minutes or so it begins to thunder, and rain falls from the sky and into the swimming pool which everybody tries frantically to take pictures of.  Not sure how that turns out but whatevs.\n\nThe day I went there was a guest walking around wearing a green dinosaur costume...costume?  He was soon sipping a tropical drink out of a carved coconut.  The place may sound sort of trashy but was renovated last year and is gorgeous!  Thick dark wood, lush tropical plants and carved status of Easter Island type people really makes you feel like you are in the South Pacific.  \n\nThe cocktail list is filled with tropical drinks and damn are they good!  Most drinks are served with a thick slice of pineapple and maraschino cherry.  They serve the famous stuff like pina colada but also have their own signature tropical drinks like Lava Bowl and Tonga Tart.\n\nTrivia:  the deck (flooring) of the area around the pool is taken directly from the famous ship the S.S. Forrester.  This ship was used in the regular route from San Francisco to the South Seas.  Neat.", "author": "Heather F."}

That's kind of how Tonga Room is. \n\n As you're thinking to yourself that the $30 or more plate you're eating is on par with the okayest Chinese food restaurant in your podunk hometown, you justify it by the fact that you're not here necessarily for the food, but for the entire over-the-top experience.  And being that you made dinner reservations, you're paying for the luxury of not waiting in the line of poor saps winding out into the nondescript hotel hallways.  I overheard one guy on the phone saying \"Yea it's gonna be like 45 more minutes...\"  as I whisked past him to my table. That's worth at least $15 right there. \n\nThe complete Tiki/Polynesian/Quasi-Hawaiian decor disguising what used to be the hotel swimming pool- That's worth about $7.00\n\nAnd the band on the little boat in the pool playing non-stop covers of all the hits I never thought I'd want to hear from; Sugar Ray to the BeeGees.  That's $5.50 easy. \n\nThe fun, flavorful drinks came in fun containers such as:  coconuts, tiki heads, bamboo shaped glasses, giant blue bowls with extra long straws.

We assumed she was charging it to our room. The happy hour is the worst they load the glasses to the top with ice.\nThe ambiance is that of the Tiki Room rain falls down from the ceiling around the pool great decor but for the money you will be irritated at the staff and the amount of alcohol.

I didn't try any of their house cocktails or food - just bottled beer - so I can't comment on that.  The staff were professional and attentive.  I'm giving it 3 stars because of 3 things:\n\n1) The place is dusty.  There are dust trails on the ceiling next to the vents.  Clean the place for god sake!  There is dust on the fake stones and dirt - real dirt on the fake dirt basically.\n\n2) The lead singer of the band is awful.  You couldn't hear him.  Either there was some sort of technical difficulty or he just doesn't know how to project and sing.\n\n3) The chairs and tables don't match the design, look, and feel of the place.  So there's little cohesion in the design beyond the central pond and surrounding fence.\n\nI will say I do appreciate the rain that falls from the ceiling into the pond.  The fake lightning is comical.\n\nWe went on a Saturday night and while it wasn't packed, it was a little busy.  The crowd is primarily made up of 50+ white people with a sprinkling of 30 somethings.  Some women really get into the \"Tonga\" and dress like they're in Fiji or Hawaii.  Watching the old people dance is hilarious.  They look like they're having strokes.  People watching here is priceless.

The Tonga Room/Hurricane Bar has been on my bookmarked list for quite some time but i've never really had an occasion to check it out yet. For my twenty-sexy after party, we decided to go head over to Hurricane Bar to see what the fuss was about.\n\nLet me just start by saying that Hurricane Bar is clearly the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of tiki bars. Where else will you find rain within a bar, a musical stage on a boat that will move back and forth and decor that will make you feel like you're partying in Tahiti. True story-- I posted a picture of me and my besties on Instagram with a caption that read \"partying in Tahiti\" and people actually believed me. \n\nI loved that they had a small dance floor for you to show off them moves. The music is not your typical top 40's but a variety of classic goodies DJ'ed in-house on a little boat in the middle of the restaurant that actually moves. \n\nDid I mention that they have rain and thunder through out the night? Coupled with the tropical drinks, Hurricane Bar makes you feel like you're truly swaying the night away in the midst of a tropical storm. \n\nWho knew such a gem was within the Fairmont Hotel in the middle of San Francisco. \n\n**Minus one star since you're not able to make reservations and have to wait in line (even for a party of 12).", "author": "Tiffany U."}

We could not believe all the people for happy hour. It was packed and a line waiting to get in. We had dinner reservations for 6:00 pm and had to wait approximately 10 minutes before we were seated, even though there was just one couple ahead of us for their dinner hour. They escorted us to a nice table for two next to the water, however, it was shortly thereafter they seated a table of 7 women who were there to party. It didn't take long before they were becoming loud so we asked to be moved.  Our waiter was nice enough to move us to a different table which we were thankful for. As the evening progressed these woman became party animals. So if you are looking for a nice romantic dinner you will be out of luck. However, we were quite surprised by their food. My husband ordered the hot sour soup and Kalua Pork. We have never seen so much pork on a plate and it was delicious. I ordered the tacos and Tonga platter. Both were excellent. Their prices were very reasonable for the amount of food you received. Our waiter Haobo informed us if we stayed pass 8:00 pm there would be an additional cover charge of $10 for each of us once the band started performing even though we were there for dinner.

It's a genuine relic of the glory days of the Tiki craze, and singularly unique.\n - The interior decorating is pretty fantastic--a controlled assortment of tiki paraphernalia, with the centerpiece pool that provides a floating stage for live entertainment as well as a simulated thunderstorm every 20 minutes or so. The dance floor is made to look like the best-swabbed ship's deck you've ever seen.\n - The service was adequate, with regular water refills.\n - The food and drinks have substantially improved over recent years, thanks to fierce competition from... just about every other restaurant/bar in the city. Also, there are more vegan/vegetarian options than there used to be (something that, even in SF, you can't count on, and a trend I'd like to see more of!).\n\nThe bad:\n - The food and drinks were good, but still not great. Though they are supposedly now using legitimate historical recipes from Don The Beachcomber etc., the cocktails we ordered were still noticeably unbalanced and inconsistent. Absent were the garnishes that you would expect from $16 beverages.\n - The restrooms are inconveniently placed far outside of the restaurant in the hotel halls. They ARE very nice restrooms, but I don't get why they can't do some light remodeling and have some restrooms in/attached to the TR itself.\n - The food is WAY too expensive--and we were only ordering apps from the bar. $13 for four egg rolls? Really? (Also, they were supposed to be spring rolls--$16). The drinks cost a few bucks more than Smuggler's Cove, but are still vastly inferior in taste, appearance, and consistency. The rum menu (which is nothing to write home about, but at least they try) charges more than I've ever seen. I get that they're the Fairmont, and you're really paying for the experience, but...\n\nThe ugly:\n - The music. Oh my, the music. Whoever was in charge of the playlist the night we were there should be moved to another part of the hotel, far away from the speakers. You just cannot operate a historic Tiki bar/restaurant without giving thought to the aural experience. Let me be clear--the music wasn't BAD, and I would welcome it at most other bars, but the modern alt/pop/rock sat in stark contrast to the ambience of the Tonga Room. From the moment my friends and I walked in, we looked at each other quizzically, and never really felt relaxed or at ease. I love this place for what it represents, but the music kinda made me want to leave and never come back. And that's a big deal.

We chilled, taking in the ambience when out came the band...on a boat in the small pool area in the middle of the room.  They were cool, they played fun dance songs in the beginning, but as their set went on, they played songs that weren't energizing and fun to dance to.

Not sure if that was such a good idea, because when we got there- there was a line waiting for us at the entrance. Oh yes, before I forget! There is a cover charge of $7 for Saturdays. Anyways, we waited for about 30 minutes before we were brought to our table. Not too bad for a Saturday night, in my opinion. \n\nS E R V I C E  T O O  Q U I C K ?\nNot even 5 seconds after we plopped our butts onto our chairs, a waiter comes over with his pen and paper and asks, \"What did you want to order?\" I'm sure all three of us had the same look of, \"Wait, what??? We just sat down!!\" So, after getting some time to look over the menu- we decided to order the Scorpion Bowl, the Smugglers Golden Punch Bowl, and I ordered a pina colada just cause. \n\nP O '  U P ,  D R A N K \nThe drinks came out a little after 5 minutes, which was quite surprising. Now for the taste test! The Smugglers Golden Punch Bowl was first, and the result? YUCK! Everyone made that oh my goodness, disgusted face. Okay, so let's see if the other bowl is any better. UH, NOPE- noway! I've had many scorpion bowls before, but none as fowl tasting as this one. It hurt my insides to take another sip, so I stopped after two and worked on the Smugglers Bowl. Which, in comparison to the Scorpion Bowl, was much better. I know, I know- what about the pina colada? Well, it wasn't blended. In fact it seemed as if pina colada mix was poured over a cup of ice, no thank you. \n\nL I V E  B A N D\nThis made the night more enjoyable, the band was awesome! They performed upbeat-get-your-butt-up-and-dance-whatever-your-age-is oldies and newies (yeah, I just made that up.), which kept everyone in the room very entertained! \n\nC O N C L U S I O N\nOkay, so the drinks SUCKED. But, you don't come to the Tonga Room to get good drinks. You come to the Tonga Room to have a good time! Listen to a live band perform some of your favorite old school songs, or maybe some of your new school faves. Hence the 3 star rating! Oh, and the characters that this places draws in- I love it! There were little old ladies getting down on the dance floor (too cute), and a gentleman who connected several straws to drink out of our Scorpion Bowl, celebrating his 40th birthday (completely awesome)!

We arrived around 5:30 and most of the tables were empty but reserved so we couldn't sit, not sure why they don't stagger seatings, I'm sure people (including us) would have been happy to start drinks/dinner at 5:30 or even 5:00. \n\nRegardless, the biggest issue we had is they said that a table would be available in 30min if we wanted to wait (this would have been fine, we weren't in a rush) but we couldn't wait at the bar, someone from our group had to physically wait out front by themselves. I'd never heard of such an odd policy. We decided to stick around for a couple of drinks at the bar because the place is neat and then go elsewhere for dinner later. I don't recall the food being particularly memorable so this wasn't a big deal for us. \n\nIf you are just want a couple drinks the bar is a neat spot, although there are no chairs and you can't have food or wait for a table.

I was bummed I wasn't there for that, but all the more reason to come back.\n\nI cannot speak for the food since we didn't eat here, but word of mouth is that the food is good, not great.\n\nWe had several different kinds of tropical drinks, including some of the tiki bowls and they were all good and STRONG. Our waitor was quick and friendly and not at all agitated that we weren't ordering food.\n\nI think this was one of my favorite parts of this San Francisco trip and will definitely be a staple in future trips to the city.", "author": "Ashley K."}

What is better than a gigantic ceramic painted bowl of booze, fruit, fire and an umbrella! I did not eat the food but, why would you?? you come here to drink in a basement that looks like a cheesy 60's beach hidden in a nice hotel. You have to get the girl fruity Lava Bowl!!

A few of them didn't have a seat at the bar, they got up and were standing right next to the bar with drinks in hand.\n\nA security guard came by and said they didn't have a seat, so they would have to leave. Mind you, they got in, paid for drinks, literally had drinks in their hands and were told to leave because they didn't literally sit down in seats at the bar.\n\nI had other people coming to the party and I told them not to come, because I didn't want them coming to my birthday party and be kicked out. Totally ruined my birthday party, and after dinner, instead of staying and drinking and dancing, we all left.\n\nI never, ever had this experience where my friends were kicked out for doing nothing but enjoying their drinks at the bar.\n\nRidiculous, overpriced dinner, drinks, and atmosphere is not worth being treated this way.", "author": "Elena O."}

They took us to Fisherman's Wharf where we ate crab, drove down Lombard Street, rode a cable car and crossed the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\nThe Tonga Room with its tiki huts and giant tiki gods is a sharp contrast to the opulent and gilded upstairs lobby of the Fairmont Hotel. I remember the Tonga room because it rained indoors. As a kid, I thought it was an extension of Disneyland and waited for the animatronic birds to come out and sing. No such luck.\n\nLast night, my friends and I decided to play tourist and celebrate a couple of birthdays here. We had a reservation so we walked right past the line at the door. We were seated right next to the \"lagoon.\" \n\nInstead of birds, the music came from the 4-person band that performed in a boat floating in the lagoon.

The cocktails were delicious but not enough alcohol content for the price. I ordered the drink that comes inside a pineapple.. $24!

Be sure to come on a Friday or Saturday though when they have a live band FLOATING ON A BOAT in the middle of the restaurant while IT RAINS.

HERE WE GO:\n\nI took my girlfriend here last Thursday evening to catch the last bit of Happy Hour, which runs from 5:00pm to 7:00pm Wednesday through Friday. It's $10/person.\n\nThat's a DEAL in this place, and in hindsight, I'm very sorry that we didn't take advantage of it. Even if the food had been shitty, we would have at least walked out of this place feeling like we got our money's worth. \n\nWhat I DID enjoy about the Tonga Room was its atmosphere. It was like walking into an adult version of Rainforest Cafe, complete with rain, lightning and thunderstorms; and as other reviewers have mentioned, there's something very \"Disneyland\" about this place (more specifically, if the Tiki Room and Blue Bayou had a baby). \n\nI can't very well, however, go onto the food without first setting the record straight in regards to San Francisco history. We were told by several staff members that the pool inside of the Tonga Room is \"the oldest indoor swimming pool in San Francisco\". THIS IS INCORRECT, unless they mean the oldest indoor swimming pool STILL IN EXISTENCE. Technically speaking, it was actually the Sutro Baths, which opened in 1896, which to this day still sort of \"exist\", depending on how you look at them...The pool inside of the Fairmont Hotel didn't open until 1929. \n\nANYWAY...\n\nI regret having dinner here. I really do.\n\nIf you don't make a reservation they will probably put you at the shittiest table ever, even if the restaurant is half-empty, as was the case when we came here last week.\n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered the Cha Siu Bao (BBQ Pork Buns). Anyone who appreciates good and cheap dim sum as much as I do will be shocked and appalled that we paid $15.00 for four buns that tasted no better than what we could have gotten around the corner in Chinatown for less than half as much money. \n\nFor the entree, we shared the Fried Saimin Noodles, which was a strange combination of chow mein-looking noodles, sliced sausage and vegetables. A flavorless, poor attempt at...whatever it was trying to be.\n\nMy advice to you? Make reservations for a poolside table, come for the Happy Hour buffet, and leave before 8:15pm or else a per-person cover charge will be added to your bill. A band playing Top-40 music in a floating covered raft? Eh, I'd rather see Diamond Dave.", "author": "Jen O."}

Great for office parties, birthday parties, first dates, after-work get togethers, etc.\n\nIf you're in SF and haven't been here, I highly recommend going.

You go because someone (who is more than likely wildly inebriated) has the moronically persuasive GALL to suggest going there and for some reason you agree, because you're feeling like you want to relinquish control of your flailing life if only for a moment, or a Hurricane or four and a goddamn tiny paper umbrella. \n\nOur story is lore. My roommate and I met up with two of our pals around 11--somehow, these rascals had already been soaking up the Tonga rum since 8pm. Eyes were glazed by the time we sat down at our tiki hut and there was a suspiciously large bag filled with over a dozen commemorative Tonga goblets. Apparently they had rung up such an exorbitant tab that the staff was giving them free shit. Side note: my friends are regular people, not tech moguls. I'm not rolling around with GD Benioff. What. The. Sam. Hell. \n\nThe planets were aligned and the dance floor was packed with spillover from a wedding AND a bar mitzvah at the hotel in which the Tonga Room is located--we were delighted with the witching hour of an all-star showcase. Tonga Room, in this light, is a spectator sport. Moms who have had one too many Chardonnays heckling the band to play Springsteen, tottering precariously at the edge of the moat. The weird uncle that may or may not have hired an escort as a date and is convinced he is an Olympic-level salsa dancer. The lanky teen who was slipped one too many bevs at the earlier wedding's open bar, staggering around like a newborn fawn, just moments from imminent sickness like a ticking bomb about to detonate. Who will be the first to pass out on the island?! \n\nYou better believe we heckled all of them. Until we were asked to leave at closing, when the waitstaff swiftly swiped an electric blue Hurricane from my friend's bare paws and poured the sludge into a styrofoam \"roadie,\" if you will, which we all found even more hilarious as she angrily chucked it at a nearby building. \n\nLong story short, if you don't have an open heart and a soft-spot for saccharinely-tinged shenanigans, go be a douchebag elsewhere (Polk is a short Uber ride away, jerks). But if you're looking to get full-tilt, loosey-goosey, mom-drunk silly, there's a pineapple wedged Hurricane with your name on it at Tonga Room.", "author": "Meredith C."}

Yes, the food is average and ragingly overpriced (they call it \"Pacific Rim comfort food\").  Yes, you may be sitting next to tourists or a birthday party for 7-year-old girls.  But here is what you do: you skip the food, order yourself a pina colada, and thank your lucky tiki stars that a place like this exists in the world.  \n\nThis is not to say that I just wonder into the Tonga Room for a casual Wednesday night drink (OK, I am actually going to do this tonight). But this is a must-visit destination when I have guests in town.  Pro tip: get here early to avoid the cover charge, which I believe is around $5 on weeknights and $7 on weekends.  The band usually starts at 8pm so if you're in and out before then, you're cool.  Or, of course, just embrace a full night of tiki.  And take advantage of the fact that this is one of the few places in the city where you can get up in the middle of dinner and have a dance with your sweetie.  Old school dinner and dancing: that is something that the world needs more of.  So this is my recommendation: have a scorpion bowl, some appetizers, and kick back and listen to the rain (you'll see what I'm talking about) and the sweet sounds of the fantastically lounge-y house band.  \n\nViva la Tonga!", "author": "Eric S."}

I cannot state that enough.  Maybe if I had been treated properly, I would have bought something.  I made a point not to purchase a thing; being treated poorly by 3 different people results in no service at all, and I was going to try a few items on the menu initially.\n\n2) You can really bond with people over bad experiences (in this case, terrible employees).\n\n3) White people cannot dance (but the dance floor is great for people watching).\n\nLet me go into more detail.\n\nMy friend wanted to have her birthday here, and we all decided to meet up around 9:30 - 10 ish.  Parking in the city was a disaster, so we were a bit late.  We walk up to the place, and are greeted with a huge line, which really at this point made me feel like I was waiting for a ride at Disneyland (music blaring in the restaurant, lights blasting out into the line...).\n\nI calmly went up to the host and stated that we were meeting a group for their birthday and that they were inside.  I was given such attitude for asking if we could just go in, instead of waiting for a \"table because this place is too full.\"  Mind you, the group HAD a table, and it was for the guests of the birthday.\n\nWe were let in ONLY after my friend got us out of line (really? even after I gave you the reservation name and facebook invite?) and then, to my amazement, saw that over half the tables were EMPTY.  The place was not even close to capactity.  It was in fact, half empty.  I could not believe this.  I was told before that I would have to wait an hour if my friend did not come get me, and was also given rolled eyes, sighs, and if looks could kill, I wouldn't be writing this right now.\n\nSo, I get to the party, which has about 30 people.  There are about 8 seated at the table, and the rest are lingering around.  I politely asked another employee if we could use another table so more people could sit (there were so many un-used tables, and we were going to PAY for FOOD at the BIRTHDAY).  He said no, and make a big stink that none of us paid $7 for the entertainment fee (what entertainment fee?). No pay, no table.  Well, sir, you lost any money and respect from me.  Also, if there was a fee to \"sit\" at a table, I should have been given this information before I was so kindly let in.\n\nHe then handed me off to another kind gentleman who began to berate me and my group.  I left and told some friends about what had happened.  Apparently they got attitude as well.  For instance, some people had to stand in line (including the birthday girl herself) after leaving to use the bathroom.\n\nWhat a joke.  This establishment has a lot of promise, if they lowered their prices and raised their standards on customer service.  I will never go back here, and strongly advise anybody to stay away.", "author": "Kirsten A."}

I think the place slightly annoyed my GF with the level of cheesiness. But I thoroughly enjoyed it. The dance floor had all kinds of ropes and wooden pulleys etc. and resembles a pirate ship.

Since I wanted their trip to go smoothly I made a reservation for 4 at 9PM on a Friday night. (I had seen other reviews recommending a reservation.)

We had a great time, we really enjoyed the live band and the overall atmosphere for an hour and a half. Now, the things that threw me off:\n\n1. When we were ordered our drinks and appetizers our waiter asked for a credit card to pre-run or something. I thought it was weird, but didn't mind so I gave him my card and went on with the night.\n2. The waiter placed the check on our table 30 minutes before we were done with our drinks and food. The place wasn't close to empty, so I thought it was rude.\n3. Once I finally opened and looked at the check as we neared the end of our drinks, I was SHOCKED that he had charged us an additional $7 COVER PER PERSON! Our bill was already over $120. \n\nI'm guessing this happened because I made a reservation and we didn't order entrees. However, based on the prices of their entrees, we could have easily eaten dinner rather than have drinks and appetizers for $120!\n\nDespite my 2 star review I might be back if we have company in town and want to take them somewhere unique.

For the main course, we got the mahi on coconut risotto, which we cleaned up and the hot pot, which was so large, I had no room for it. Throughout the meal, I ordered two drinks. One was the pina colada. which was surprisingly strong and the Zombie, which I expected to be strong and it DEFINITELY did the trick! The drinks are so worth it! After all of this, my boyfriend proceeded to order the Volcano Sundae with 6 flavors of ice cream, each scoop being the size of a softball. We barely put a dent in it, it was so big! Definitely meant for a larger group and not two people. The toasted coconut was my fave though!\n\nThe bill ended up being around $160(not including top), but considering everything we got, it was WELL WORTH IT. The only reason I knocked off a star is being the service is nothing special. They do their job and nothing more. But I would definitely recommend going for the experience!", "author": "Kathleen N."}

Probably not.  But the Tonga Room is much better because they serve alcohol!!  The drinks are fantastic, but perhaps a bit pricey.  But they taste of the islands and are delicious.

Yes, I have a thing for tiki bars (see also: the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland) but I also just love it here for the atmosphere and history of the Fairmont, and I attempt to drag everyone who visits SF here. I'm sure 3294832 other reviews mention this, but the Tonga Room is built over and around the Fairmont's old swimming pool, which was built in 1929 and closed (I believe) in the 1930s; it serves as the current lagoon. The Tonga Room opened in 1945 and was redesigned in the late 1960s; it had, when I moved to SF in 2009, been the subject of much \"is it or isn't it\" debate regarding its historical site status, and plans were made to close it forever (sob!) as the hotel expanded. While it seems it has a reprieve, I'm not sure if it's permanent, so best to get there while you can. The cocktails are expensive, but they're worth every cent -- trust. Go! Sit under an umbrella under the colored lanterns, listen to the thunderstorm every half hour and tell me your $13 drink served in a ceramic coconut wasn't worth it. I always try to get a table on the water, but there are no bad seats. It gets more magical with every Mai Tai, too, I promise. \n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, and as much as it pains me to admit it: I've never had a good meal here.** (Please see update below.) The food is overpriced and bland, and the chicken dishes I have had seemed to have really off-quality meat in them. The fried vegetables were tasty as an appetizer, and their desserts are good, but don't go for dinner (entrees are $28-30). This is a much better (and budget friendly) experience for drinks and appetizers and/or desserts. I have read that they revamped their menu, and I will revisit if I have dinner again. This review is based purely on past experiences.\n\n**One other word of caution: Be sure to check the Facebook page or call ahead if you're thinking of making the trek up to Nob Hill (particularly on foot -- oof!). The Tonga Room is frequently closed for private events -- and closed Mondays -- so it's better to check before you go. There is also, I believe, sometimes a cover charge on weekends.**\n\nEDIT / UPDATE: Since the revamp, the menu has drastically improved! Even though I had no complaints before, drink-wise, I could taste the difference in the cocktails (which are now made with fresh fruit juices, rather than with artificial boxed / canned mixtures). The food menu is excellent, too -- we started with the Quintessential Pu Pu Platter, which is comprised of chicken wings, BBQ Kona pork ribs, shiitake mushroom egg rolls and Dungeness crab rangoon (3 of each), all of which were excellent. For dinner, I had the green curry, which was great, but I tried the grilled Hawaiian ono (with roasted corn, mizuna, mashed sweet potato coconut with green curry sauce) and it was phenomenal; I will definitely order that next time. For dessert, we shared the Tonga Dessert Sampler Platter (mini gingered banana coconut tarts, mochi trio and a mini coconut floating island) -- they were tasty, too.", "author": "Katie M."}

Located within the Fairmont hotel, it definitely caters to the hotel guests/tourists that are staying nearby.  It definitely has the feel of a touristy lounge where non-locals come to have dinner or a drink or two.  They have a live band that starts playing at 8:15 that floats on a tiki hut. The place is dimly lit and is supposed to add to the \"ambiance\".   I would highly recommend making reservations if you want to have dinner here as the place was quite busy and I did see a line of people waiting when we got here (we had a Friday 6pm reservation).  Definitely plan ahead. \n\nThe food & drink are wayyyyyyy over priced. I would not recommend coming here if you really want value for the price you are paying for dinner. I hear they have better Happy Hour specials so I'd probably go down that route if I ever come back. \n\nIf you do still come here for dinner: I'd recommend \nHuli Huli Chicken\nKalu'a Pork\nPu Pu Platter. \n\nFor dessert, we had the lava sundae, which is definitely great for sharing but once again very overpriced ($24 for dessert, geez!). That definitely can be split among 4-8 people. \n\nI'd avoid the Hot Pot, not very good. Also, the sliders in the appetizers are blah. \n\nOur server was nice but a bit annoying in that he kept coming over asking if we wanted more drinks (nice to ask but he was a bit pushy). \n\nAlso, parking can be expensive (as they have 2 hour parking till 9pm).

The fantastical voyage into a tiki room that takes you miles away from San Francisco and transplants you into a dimly light tropical tavern on the lagoon. \n\nI suppose \"the spectacle\" isn't en vogue these days and people are like, so over it when someone tries this hard. But Tonga's ambiance comes off as effortless. Or at least, a lot of effort along a simple concept: fruity drinks, and old hotel pool turned into lagoon (complete with floating boat that doubles as the band's stage), all tucked neatly into the bottom of one of SF's most stately hotels. \n\nSpaces like this are best enjoyed in good company. Not just because you want to snap a few pics of your pals near the indoor rainstorm, but because of the colorful drinks. Champion among them are the mahoosive vats of alcohol served with lots of comedically large straws that you can share with your entourage. There's really nothing like being served half of the produce section stuck around the rim of a brightly colored bowl of booze. Get it. Slurp it. Love it. \n\nYou may be faced with a cover charge (certain nights when there's entertainment you'll pay). I'm a notorious hater of covers, but didn't really feel too harsh of a sting. After all, the band did play from the boat and you've got loads of vibe to pay for. Plus, the gentlemanly Don B offered to pick up my cover charge. A hat tip to you, my friend.\n\nHopefully the powers that be keep the place and don't swap it out for something \"updated\" or \"swanky\" or \"bourbon.\" Those kinds of spaces do have a place in this world.

They have a great list of different tiki flavors. They are on the sweet side masking the alcohol successfully but some still too sweet for me. We tried a variety that included both hits and misses for different taste palettes in the group. I was shocked that not everyone liked the ginger in one of the tiki flavors (tasted like a Moscow Mule but I can't remember any of the drink names anymore). That was my favorite! I couldn't stomach the whiskey based one as it was way too smokey for my tastebuds. I definitely recommend trying a few. At the minimum, order the deep fried beef jerky. It was incredible and life changing.

I can't say I liked it however. The lychee martini was delicious that is until I ate a lychee and it was soaked in alcohol which tastes like rubbing alcohol- the fruit flavor was ABSENT! And that completely ruined the drink for me.

It's a hawaiian/island getaway themed venue; Tiki heads, torches, and even a pirateship's wheel are just a few of the many festive decorations. There are many seats around the room, perfect for big and small groups. Exotic dim lighting draws the attention toward the pool of water in the middle of the venue. There's a little boat that the band plays on in the middle of the water. As they play, water would cascade from the ceiling and trickle into the water. There's a bar lounge and mini dance floor as well for you extreme party goers ;).  \n\nNot to mention that the food is delicious! The whole venue was reserved for our big party and the food was served buffet style. There was a generous offering of ribs, pork buns, potstickers, siu mai, eggrolls and plenty of restocking! They even had little togo boxes that we could fill and take home, now that's what I call service! Cocktails and mocktails were served too...although the virgin lime margarita I got one wasn't as tasty as I expected. That doesn't really matter because I had a great time and recommend it to anyone who's down for an exotic experience!", "author": "Tina O."}

The atmosphere is fun & certainly different. The historic nature & grandiosity is impressive. The menu is comprised of different, fusion-like food. It is pricey & the food isn't worth the price paid. A PF Chang's has far better food for half the price. The drinks are great but expensive with the range from $12-18 per drink. The staff are friendly & the service is good. We were there on a night with the band playing. They weren't bad if you like poor 70s song renditions. \n\nOverall I think you would be hard pressed to find a local San Franciscan here. This is a place better in concept than reality. It is  absolutely a trap for hotel guests & visitors who, once seated at a table, are stuck with a high-priced, mediocre meal in an entertaining venue. My advice: find other gems in this great city to dine at while in town.", "author": "Amy R."}

We were a party of twelve for a 30th birthday and she helped us secure a couple tables and was incredibly attentive; kind enough to bring the girls water after seeing how many dragon bowls, Mai Tais, etc. they had consumed. Those tropical drinks can sneak up on you and Michaela knew it and helped the ladies out big time. She was great. \n\nThe bad: \nLet me preface this by saying that I initially made a reservation for 10 knowing that the Tonga Room fills up on a Friday night I wanted to ensure that our party would be accommodated. I was unaware that reservations required a full dinner service. The hostess was kind enough to call and fill me in in this at which point I told them that we were just coming for drinks and apps but would definitely put up a table worthy bill. When our party arrived they were again informed of the dinner order requirement (quite rudely as if the Tonga Room was not for our kind) so we said never mind we'll just occupy the bar. The hostess with the English accent was polite enough;  the other hostess with the short hair was incredibly rude and would not let members of our party in while we waited at tables in the bar. It seems that they were upset about the reservation fiasco and we're trying to thwart our good time. I still cannot believe the attitude that the short haired hostess displayed, people like her do not belong greeting guests or interacting with them. Her attitude of superiority and rudeness is the bane of the service industry. It's the Tonga Room not the Fontainebleau , chilll out.", "author": "Ryan P."}

I wanted a damn cocktail umbrella in my drink, and nothing less would suffice. My yearning for tiki drinks brought me here and my experience was decent.\n\nThe ambience is totally kitschy with the boat  in the middle of the swimming pool complete with 70s wedding band, pirate ship-themed accents, and little umbrellas in the drinks. Hell, the little umbrellas were half the reason I came here in the first place. I ordered a Zombie and my companion the Singapore Sling. I enjoyed my zesty Zombie and my bf compared his drink to a \"Poor Man's Wet Woody\" (if you've ever been to Gar Woods in N. Lake Tahoe, you know what this is). \n\nHere's the catch. Of course you'd expect to pay $12-15 for a tiki cocktail. That's a given. But the food is seriously, and no pun intended, overpriced hotel food. We ordered the $30 puu-puu platter and yeah the food was good but obviously overpriced for what it was. This bar is in a hotel and clearly milks the \"expensive hotel food\" stereotype for all it's worth. \n\nService was great, everyone was cheerful and didn't make a fuss that we didn't have reservations. I'll definitely be coming back the next time I need a tropical drink (and getaway) locally.", "author": "Liz G."}

The space is beautiful with super high ceiling, tiki decor with the addition of pirate nautical and comfortable bamboo upholstered chairs. \n\nHere's how it works- happy hour is 5:00- 7:00 Wednesday thru Friday in the bar area behind the desirable pool area. But in the back corners there are two circles of table seating that are fairly close to the pool. Happy hour drinks are $8.50 for singles and $13.00 for bowls. The happy hour buffet is $10.00 for spam fried rice (sparse meat), chow mein and wings. Every 30 minutes there is a thunderstorm with thunder and rain water on the pool. Drinks are not up to the Tiki Ti- the Scorpion Bowl for two is good and not too sweet, but the Mai Tai tastes off and the Bora Bora is too sweet. A strawberry daiquiri was sweet but delicious. \n\nThe desirable seating by the pool opens at 6:00, where the drinks are $12 but the selection better. Here the dinner menu is served with main courses about $25. At 8:00 a band plays on a raft in the pool but I didn't stay for that. \n\nIf you arrive for happy hour at 4:40 you might be the first person in line and can get a really good seat in the front corner of the back corner bar seating area and life is good. Latecomers sit way in the rear and have limited view but they had no less fun.\n\nSo come to soak up the atmosphere and enjoy good service while downing sweet Tiki drinks. My server recommended the Bora Bora and when I asked whether it was good she responded \"it's the Tonga Room\" so take it whatever way you want. I'm glad I came and would come more often if the location was more convenient to drivers. Just bring a little lime juice to tone down the drinks.", "author": "Jon S."}

This manager was so unhelpful saying he'll call accounting and find out what what happen and call me back. I've been waiting a few days and still no call so I called again and he told me it should be only 33 not 66 so check it again so I told him I have bank statements here and it says 66 and 33 was never returned. Why was I charged 66 and receipt even says 33 so where the fuck did the number 66 come from. I was then told hey it happens like it's okay...

But I love this place because it is like a bar, and a time machine. \n\nIf you come on a weekend or after 8 or so, you are probably going to have to wait in a line. If you don't like waiting in lines, you might want to make reservations, but they are by no means neccessary. \n\nBut seriously, Tonga Room is the shit. I'll spare you the extensive history, because you can read that on their website and I'm sure lots of other people have mentioned it, too, but it is its unique and authentic retro atmosphere that draws people in here year after year. Yes, there is a band that plays on a floating platform in the middle of a fancy tiled pool. There are also Rainforest Cafe - esque \"thunderstorms\" every once in a while. There are also little straw hut/cabana booth tables (I don't know what else to call them) and even a small dancing area by the water.\n\nThe drinks vary in strength (some you can barely feel and some hit you hard right away) but they are all delicious. They're on the pricier side, with most of them being in the $12 - 15 range, but it's a nice bar, and they're pretty ingredient - heavy drinks. I'm also a sucker for anything served in a pineapple. As far as the food goes, I've only ever had appetizers here, but they have a great variety, and they've all been really good. Especially the coconut shrimp. Damn I love that coconut shrimp.", "author": "Angela S."}

I think when Anthony Bourdain went there, he was either high or paid to speak so highly about Tonga, because Tonga is a tourists' trap with crappy food and drinks. \n\nIf you think you get a good deal by checking out their happy hour, you are making a huge mistake, drink you'll be getting will be served in a regular glass, not the special glass that you would see on a regular menu. Therefore, you'll be getting a much smaller drink as well. \n\nTheir \"special\" drinks, advertised to be really strong, are pretty much alcohol free and contain only a strong amount of sugar. I would not call them special at all. \n\nThe buffet is the biggest waste of money. You'll get a choice of having a soggy chow mein, old and dry fried rice, or tasteless spring rolls. \n\nThe inside looks sort of tropical but super old and outdated, plus the rain drops look really pathetic and cheaply made. \n\nWe have so many great happy hour places in San Francisco...

To ring in this occasion with spirit of aloha (and to ring in my two week vacation to Hawaii before I ship out), I decided to have my going away party here. \n\nLittle did I know how much I was loved because my friends came in droves, driving in and/or BARTing from Antioch/Pittsburg, San Jose and beyond. Gosh, did I feel the love! But I couldn't help to feel bad for my guests who, after traveling as much as an hour by car or by Bart, were standing in different parts of the atrocious line to get in. A good part of my night was bouncing back and forth to my friends who were in line and my friends who were already seated inside. This alludes to the most important part of the Tonga Room Bar: THERE IS NO STANDING ALLOWED. Their bar is completely seated. With that said, there was a line and a frustrating wait that was longer than the wait for the dining area. When do you ever see that happen? I found myself endlessly apologizing to my guests, completely unaware of this Tonga Room snafu. Let me just say that I'm lucky to have friends that are patient. \n\nDespite the hassle, I had a great time. I had my fill of girly island punch bowls that snuck up on me pretty bad by the end of the night. On top of that, one of my friends was pretty impressed that they had cinnamon schnapps to make a carrot cake shooter, which I had two of. And other friend wanted to do shots of Patron. And another wanted to chug a punch bowl for two. The last thing I remember in the Tonga Room was being dragged onto the dance floor by one of my girlfriends and we twirled, spun, and acted a fool in front the entire restaurant. Being the ones on the dance floor only drew more attention to us, but I loved every minute of it! It was happiness at its best.\n\nOverall, I think I would give this place another try the next time I'm in town if I had a smaller group with me. I definitely wouldn't suggest this place for a huge gathering. Expect to wait in a line along with tourists that are beaming with curiosity thanks to Anthony Bourdain.", "author": "Grace L."}

When the manager leaves, the waiter YELLS at us AGAIN just to make an example of us I guess. \n\nAt this point I am POed!!! No one treats me like that especially on a special night. So, I find the manager and tell him how he has ruined our night. He comes over and apologizes to my fianc\u00e9 and friend and leaves us. My fianc\u00e9 had one more drink and we leave without giving a tip. As we leave the manager stops us asking if we wanted to sit somewhere else and he could get a complementary dessert for us. I'm sorry but as we said, we ate already we are now so upset that we wouldn't be hungry if we wanted to be and a free dessert will not fix that I was already writing this review in my head. This has been the WORST part of my first time to SAN FRAN!!! We said no thank you and we left.\n\nI would say no stars, but the cover band was awesome and worth the extra 7 bucks.

I'd heard of the place for years, but I'd never been fortunate enough to see it for myself. I have an intense love for kitschy, tropical things, so of course I knew I'd have to see this little jewel sooner or later.\n\nWell, sooner came around and I had dinner here on a rainy Wednesday night with some friends, and of course, I was instantly in love.\n\nFrom the band floating on a barge in the middle of the \"lagoon\", to the ridiculously sweet drinks, to the fake rain, I was hooked. When it came time for my sister to plan my bachelorette party, I knew exactly where I wanted to have dinner. \n\nThe Tonga room isn't about the food, or the service, or even the drinks. It's about the lore and history. I don't feel you should be allowed to call yourself a bay area native if you've never set foot inside the Tonga Room. It's like a rite of passage. Along the lines of a trip across the Golden Gate, taking in a game at Candlestick, browsing through the hanging ducks in China Town, or seeing the Christmas tree in Union Square. \n\nThis is one spot you surely shouldn't miss.

The decor of the place is interesting but tacky at the same time.  Looks like it belongs in Disneyland rather than the Fairmont Hotel in Nob Hill.  I'm not going to get into what the place looks like because there are plenty of pictures all over the web for those curious.\n\nPretty much from the very beginning our service was almost non-existent.  We were never introduced to the place or our server, the menu was never explained, we had to hunt down our server to order anything,  and the wait time for food and drink was two to three times longer than it should be.  The only time our server made any effort was in collecting the bill at the the end of the night.  \n\nThe drinks were very poor especially considering the high price you paid for them.  They were watered down, overly mixed with juice and sweeteners, and loaded with ice.  I've had better cocktails with the jungle juice you get at a frat party.  I had their Mai Tai, it was garbage.  I didn't have much of the food but from what I can see others order it looked like typically bar food, nothing special except for the exceptionally high price.  \n\nThe best part comes at the end of the night when you get your bill.  They charged our party 15% gratuity, which would have been ok considering our group size, except that they pretty much ignored us all night. Reading through the bill they actually calculated the tip amount after the cover charge! This is ridiculous.  So we had a group of 15 and the cover charge was $7 so thats a $105 in cover charge times 15% gratuity.  Now I don't mind tipping on food but I have never had to pay a tip on a cover charge as well.

We visited early on a Friday night for Happy Hour (we found street parking nearby after several loops), and while there wasn't a line, we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. Once we were seated, we waited some more for a server, and finally we had to seek out someone to get menus and take our orders. The waitress was not at all friendly, answering our questions about the menu rudely and offering us no introduction or small-talk. Although the Room was busy, there's no reason for a server not to be friendly.\n\nThe four of us ordered two drinks each, and they were all yummy enough in that almost-sickeningly sweet way of tropical drinks. I split the Tonga Platter (bbq ribs, chicken satay, spring rolls, and coconut shrimp) with my fianc\u00e9, and while the food was all fine, it certainly wasn't worth the $26 we paid for it. Indeed, the future sister-in-law ordered the appetizer buffet, and she seemed to get much more bang for her buck.\n\nThe decor is dark but fun, and the atmosphere is neat when it starts to rain on the central pool. We didn't want to pay more when the band came in, so I can't say anything about that. Overall though, I don't think the drinks and atmosphere are enough to get me back into the Tonga Room.

Parking is a mess, but that's expected in SF. You can valet in the hotel lot for $15/hour (that's the price for a guest of the restaurant only - it's less if you're staying the night in the Fairmont).\n\nDo not expect a refill on your drink unless you paid $12 for one with alcohol. I had a sip of a friend's and it was strong. The alcoholic drinks had cute umbrellas and were in Tiki glasses, but were out of our budget.  My husband had a Coca Cola & I had an iced tea. If a restaurant chooses to serve a drink in a tiny glass, be prepared to return often to refill it. I had to request refills for my husband & myself several times. Our meal literally took hours - it was terrible to have an empty glass! Don't punish me for being a responsible driver. \n\nDon't go with a group - we had 10 people & a 6:30 reservation on a Saturday night. They sat us once our entire party had arrived (around 6:45) - they did not take our orders until after 7:15. That was the last time I checked my husband's watch. To me, this is outrageous. Our server was not to be seen, or would come back and rush by. Once we did order, it was appetizers only. He'd come back for our meal order. I ordered an edamame dish ($4) & my husband ordered sweet potato fries.  When our server brought out the table's apps, he announced I'll put these in the middle so that everyone can share and took ours to the other side of the table. We let him know that NO, we ordered those and they were part of our meal. We'd decided to split a dinner and weren't interested in sharing apps. This is unprofessional unless you first ask the person who orders the item. I will say, the edamame was a huge serving; though hugely boring. No flavor.  The sweet potato fries were warm in the middle of the bowl/dish but cold up top. Like they'd sat a long while. I tried the calamari someone else ordered and I'll say it's some of the best calamari I've had anywhere - ever. Nicely breaded. Thick cut pieces. I would order it if ever I were forced to go back here.\n\nFor dinner we split the sampler appetizer. It consisted of 4 items: coconut shrimp, spring rolls, ribs, and chicken satay. We also added an order of Forbidden Rice ($6) & the \"steamed & brown rice\". ($3) Given there were two of us, our served should have said that these are 2 different menu items. We ended up with THREE things of rice and three charges for it. The \"steamed & brown\" wasn't combined like I took the menu to mean. At least it was a small extra charge. I still blame the server for not clarifying this.  The items on the sampler each had three pieces. When is the last time you sat at a table for 3? Ever?? Make it four! For $26 do not be cheap. It leaves a bad taste in your patron's mouth. About as bad as the peanut sauce on the chicken and BBQ sauce on the ribs. Both were drenched in sauces that were too strongly flavored.  Which is shocking since I asked for hot sauce (twice) and each time received a TINY spoonful on a plate that also had a soysauce and mustard sauce. What don't you get? I want some hot sauce. After asking twice, I didn't ask a third time. I used the small amount the table was to share also (since nobody was interested in it); then I just gave up. The Forbidden Rice blend was great. I'd recommend that.\n\nWhile you sit (and wait, mostly) they do have a pretty pool to look at and at intervals it \"rains\" & \"thunders\", which is cool. There's a boat floating in the middle. Once they start playing you get an extra $7 tacked onto your bill and you no longer have to talk to anyone at your table, because unless they are sitting next to you it's impossible to hear them. Oh? You like conversation? Bummer. We gave up talking to the people across from us for the most part. Yelling for an hour was unpleasant. Our server did waive our \"cover charge\" for the band, for the entire table. I don't know why, but I was glad. NOT worth $7 if you're eating. The music was good and they have a great dance floor, so if you're there to drink and dance it would be awesome. Lots of good tunes and the band did a great job covering them. I wish we'd stayed after dinner.\n\nWhen it came time to leave we asked for OUR bill & were told it could not be split up. When we sat & ordered, we'd asked for a separate tab & he said he'd do that at the end. Well, here we are & NO he can't. So everyone figured out what was there's & after a LOOOOOONG time, he came back & grab our cards. At this point it'd been over two hours - which is the time limit for street parking near the hotel, if you don't want to overpay for a garage. Thankfully we had no ticket.\n\nI don't see myself returning here. I was so disappointed. The food wasn't great. Service wasn't great (at our end of the table) - I swear the other end had full drinks!!  It was very expensive and I didn't think the portions were worth the price for the quality.", "author": "Amy S."}

It really was something to see. \n\nFor the uninitiated, the cocktail list is classic kitch, and most of the drinks on it are meant to be shared and experienced as a group: the scorpion bowl arrived with six straws to boot, and the menu beckoned others. Note that things can get a little pricey, but for the things that were a little less fun (I waited on a drink a little longer than usual on a couple of occasions, for example), there were also really positive takeaways, like the spontaneous arrival of a new cold one after a friend accidentally knocked over my previous glass, shattering it. In all, the attitudes of staff seem pretty great: our waiter, for example, seemed to have an opening act, who popped by, picked up glasses from the previous party, did a couple of bits and wandered off into the night. \n\nGo if you can: one thing the Tonga Room is not is dull.", "author": "Kevin N."}

So for starters I went to make a reservation a week before our actual date (dec 17) and the host had said that the latest time she could fit my party of 5 was at 6:30. Now have in mind that their dinner hours differ than most restaurants; also they offer a live band--which they do charge an additional 5 dollars per person for entertainment costs. On our way we were stuck in traffic and I had called to let them know we were going to be arriving later than expected. NO PROBLEM! The host I had talked to on the phone had happily moved my reservation to 7 from 6:30 and guaranteed a table for us if we were coming in later. Food was ok. We ordered Ohana style (Aina Ahiahi Ma'alahi) which was 56 per person. It isn't all you can eat but they do give you generous portions. If I had to recommend this place I would only suggest coming for the nightlife. It was a cool experience coming here for my birthday but from my personal opinion I would only come back for the bar and the atmosphere.  3/5", "author": "Jon B."}

I told them I had a reservation then was happily directed to the Tonga room.\n2. The drinks are super sweet, so be careful on your orders. \n3. Service isn't the best but order the appetizers, they are not as expensive as everything else. \n4. The band isn't that bad, its pretty cool when it rains inside.\n5. The crowd is mostly older so come with friends. \n\nOverall, the place is alright. It was a bit expensive but worth the experience. A great place to bring out of towners.", "author": "Pete N."}

The experience was great, but it was quite the adventure to visit. Firstly, street parking took about an hour to locate. We actually parked in a garage initially and then realized the hotel staff was evacuated due to a fire (fire alarm?). It was windy, foggy, and freezing. We left, then decided to try again after the fire situation cleared. Secondly, the bar was very difficult to find. We kept going further down, and eventually asked a kind hotel staff member. \n\nBe aware there is an entertainment fee, like a cover if you will. It is worth it though. The drinks are spendy, but the Mai Tai was very very strong. Overall, expect to spend a decent amount for drinks here. Stay a while, it'll be worth it.

I just moved here, so I basically took notes on places that looked like fun. The Tonga Room was on the list =)\n\nI went with 3 friends, when we got there, there was a huge line. That part sucked, but there's a app for that =) Broke out my iPhone, went onto Open Table, clicked on a reservation for 20 minutes from then, we went upstairs to the Fairmont bar, had a drink, walked back downstairs, passed the whole line & got seated right away. That's the way to go.\n\nI would have never guessed a place thats on the boarder of cheesy would be in a Fairmont. When I say cheesy, I mean it in the best possibly way. It was like being on a little vacation, or on a cruise ship. Not somewhere I would go everyday, but will most definitely be back.\n\nThe 4 of us shared a Lava Bowl, which tasted like striaght booze (no compliants), we had the appertizer sampler plate, I got the Dragon Beef that our server recommended & one of their rices with sausage I believe, forgot the name. It was FABULOUS. I tried my friends Butterfish, great as well. Then we had a round of Zombie drinks. Even stronger!\n\nThe check for the 4 of us was $283 before tip, but we each got our own entrees but they are definitely big enough that I would share next time, I barely put a dent in mine it was so big.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-10-21", "description": "On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, the Tonga Room has an \"extensive\" happy hour buffet. The buffet is all-you-can eat and it is only $9.50 (plus a minimum of one cocktail)! If you go for dinner, sometimes you pay $9.50 for just one dish, and then once you finish it's done, you can't ask for more (very rude). So paying $9.50 and getting more is an amazing good deal and that is why Sophie, Jason and I decided to go to the Tonga Room Tiki Bar!\n\nWhen you get there you have to ask for a table. They will offer you a table on one of the sides of the room, on a deck that looks like a ship, or in the middle of the room between a lot of people but close to the bar. If you aren't sure which table you want, get the one on the ship because it's better. If you want to be close to the bar, don't, because you have a waitress that can get you anything from the bar.\n\nThe tables are made of wood and the chairs too, but they have pillows which are really soft. That is good if you plan to stay for a while. The room is very dark and tropical. There is a candle on every table and light-lantern style strings. They are nice because they give a nice mood. There is a ship's wheel and straw hut roofs, and in the middle of the room is a giant pool, but a dark one and it's not for swimming just for mood. \n\nIt is important that you order a cocktail. You have to, because that's the rule of the buffet. They have a selection, and every cocktail is $7.50 because it is happy hour. Normally the cocktails are more expensive. They have a selection, and one yummy cocktail I had was the Tonga Itch. It sounds nasty because itches are STDs sometimes. This is a cocktail and it is delicious. \n\nIn the middle of the room is something that could be a dance floor, and there you will find the buffet. When we saw the buffet we were very surprised. It was on a table that was not very long. This is what they had:\n\n- Chicken wings in a sweet chili sauce\n- Macaroni salad\n- Spicy edamame\n- Fried rice with ham\n- A mix of cantaloupe, honeydew and pineapple, but mostly it was honeydew\n- Asian style noodles with vegetable style stuff\n- Mini spring rolls with a sauce\n- More chicken wings in hot sauce \n\nThis list isn't missing anything. This was their buffet. I was very disappointed and sad.\n\n- The chicken wings in the sweet chili sauce were tasty, because chicken wings and sweet chili sauce are yummy and everyone likes them. I had lots of chicken wings, and one of them had the most meat on it I have ever eaten from a chicken wing! That was nice but could also mean the chicken was bionic.\n\n- The macaroni salad was very horrible. I dont like macaroni salad because I don't like mayo, but sometimes you eat something you don't like and it's okay. This macaroni salad was very disgusting. \n\n- The edamame were okay. They had very good intentions because of the spicy stuff, but they didn't taste very fresh and it's edamame - it's not a real food you cook!\n\n- The fried rice was very normal. It was fried rice, and if you don't like meat it sucks because it had bits of ham in it. I like fried rice, but it usually fried rice has stuff in it except for ham. Like pineapple. It didn't. It was boring.\n\n- The fruit was very horrible, too. It wasn't fresh fruit and it tasted like they got it from a can. Pineapple is always yummy, even from the can, but they didn't have much pineapple, mostly honeydew that was disgusting. I used some pineapple and ate it with my fried rice so it would be less boring. \n\n- The noodles were very oily and boring. They are the noodles you get at a Chinese buffet when you pay $4. I ate them and they were whatever. \n\n- The spring rolls were okay. They had a sauce which was good because they were the kind of spring rolls that are dry. They tasted like spring rolls that you get and you eat but don't comment on because they are normal; not delicious or disgusting. You just eat them and talk to your friends. \n\n- I didn't taste the other chicken wings. But they are chicken wings and hot sauce, and everyone loves chicken wings and hot sauce.\n\nIt was very disappointing and sad, and I had 4 servings because I was hungry and I wanted to eat more so it it would feel less expensive to pay for a Chinese dinner at a tiki bar. \n\nIn conclusion, the tiki bar in the Tonga Room was nice, but the food was sad. But if you go to the Tonga Room and read this review first, you will feel less bad about it, because you will go for the experience and not for the food. And the experience was nice, and the cocktails were nice, and if you aren't facing the people coming in and out of the gym next door, you can see a nice room with pretty lights and have a good time.", "author": "Tizia B."}

Unfortunately, that's where it ends for me and it was pretty much all downhill from there.\n\nThis is what happened to us:\n1) We were rushed to order drinks and food.\n2) Every recommendation was the most expensive one on the menu.\n3) None of the dishes were described in detail like other restaurants that serve very expensive food.\n4) When we mentioned the prices we were called \"cheap\" and then told \"you probably voted for Obama\"\n5) Even though we were a party of 8, the total did not include the tip so we added the tip ourselves. Split 4 ways, the bill was paid via cash by one couple and the rest paid by card.  We told the server to keep the change from the cash.  The next day, the 3 couples that paid by card noticed an extra 18% added on to the charge.  Isn't this illegal?\n6) Don't be fooled by Anthony Bourdain's experience.  Obviously for PR reasons, he did not experience any of the above.\n\nTake away from this experience.  Food quality is very typical Asian food disguised in fancy arrangement made to look expensive.  Hoping that the service would compensate for the priciness, it turned out to be even worse.  I'm not sure the entertainment makes up for it either.  I have never been to ANY restaurant where I was treated this way.  I will not recommend this place to any of my friends and I will never go back.

This is how I would break it down:\n\nDrinks - 5 Stars\nService - 3 or 4 stars depending on your server\nFood - 3 Stars\nKitch Factor - 5 Stars\n\nSo, overall 4 Stars. Prices are high and I think the cover charge is ridiculous, especially since I did not really enjoy the band that was playing. But my musical tastes do not really align with \"merely passable covers from the 70's and 80's.\" I understand that some people might come in here and just oggle the place and not spend any money, so have a minimum charge per person. But paying extra just to be there? \n\nAnyway, the reason I come here with my best friend is the drinks. They are yummy, huge and they will kick you in the head. HARD. First time I came here and I had a Zombie and I left one as well. This last time I had a Hurricane, which was $16 but it came with a souvenir glass and that was a nice take home from our girl's weekend. \n\nAs we were standing in line to get in we realized that we were suddenly starving so we decided to order some Kona BBQ ribs. They were fine. The sauce was pretty tasty but they were definitely not hot enough temperature wise. I think in the future I would avoid the food and just stick to the drinks. \n\nCome here with people who you enjoy once you are obnoxiously drunk, because you definitely will be feeling it on your way out.", "author": "Lisa H."}

In other words, I had my expectations for food and service appropriately in check, and I came to have a good time.\n\nWhat I failed to account for was how much crappy service and even crappier food and cocktails would impact my good mood. Not even the fabulous decor - even more amazing than I'd expected - and hokey AWESOME rainstorm could make up for them.\n\nIf this place was a dive bar, with prices to match, the unbelievably brusque waiter would not have bothered me. The watery roasted corn served with the fishy scallops and gristly bacon would not have bothered me. (Well, that would have bothered me, but I would not have been paying $26 for it, so it would have bothered me a lot less.)\n\nIt took 25 minutes after we were seated for our waiter to appear to take our drink order. By then my friend had gone to the bar and gotten drinks for us there, since every person who passed our table had managed to ignore our desperate wavings. Finally the waiter arrived and said very rapidly and abruptly, I quote: \"Oh, you have drinks already. What would you like to order?\" Zero apology, zero welcome, and zero mention of the special of the evening (which we had to ask to find out.) \n\nI can say without exaggeration that I have had more gracious service at fast food restaurants, and that I have had better cocktails at most dive bars. Yes, I wanted fruity, froo-froo tropical drinks but I was not prepared for cocktails so sweet they made my teeth hurt. I ordered two different drinks and each was undrinkable after a few sips, I finally gave up and ordered wine (again we had to chase the waiter down, actually literally, to get an order in.)\n\nThis is San Francisco. I don't care what kind of decor or experience you offer, If you are going to charge $26 for a plate of scallops it had better be worth it. If you are going to run an historic restaurant in a fancy hotel, make sure you hire waiters who have a shred of graciousness to them and then staff your dining room appropriately so that customers aren't left hanging.", "author": "Mary B."}

The food was a 1 but the ambiance was a 4 so I'm averaging the two out.  I visited the Tonga Room last Friday. The atmosphere is so much fun!  The decor is very cool, and the live band really adds to the ambiance.  I wasn't blown away by the service but also wasn't disappointed by it in anyway, it was more than fine. \n\nWe started with cocktails, I had the Singapore Sling which is made with Tanqueray, Cointreau, Cherry Heering, lemon and pineapple juice and Angostura bitters.  It was tasty and strong, just the way a $12.00 cocktail should be.  Hubby got the Zombie which is made with three types of rum, fresh lemon, lime, pineapple and passion fruit and Angostura bitters.  He also enjoyed his drink but opted not to finish it because he wanted to make sure he was fit to drive home. So far so good.\n\nFor Apps: we got the Shrimp and Cilantro rolls ($13.00) that came with this great Chili Ponzu sauce for dipping, and also the Shiitake Egg Rolls ($13.00) which came with wasabi, spicy mustard and some sweet mustard sauce for dipping.      We were really pleased with both but this is the point the in the evening when the direction changed course.\n\nEntrees: I ordered the Seared Diver Scallops ($28.00) which the menu described as coming with braised leeks, a tomato-lemongrass broth and radish & cilantro salad.  What I actually got: 4 colossal scallops (which were cooked perfectly) in a bed of what looked like soggy cabbage in a broth that tasted like Swanson's chicken broth.  I was not able to identify any cilantro or radishes in the bowl before me.  Hubby ordered the Fried Saimin noodles ($26.00) which were described as being served with Portuguese sausage, scallions, carrot, bean sprouts & crispy mushrooms.  What he actually got: greasy noodles with what looked and tasted like pieces of sliced up hot dog, and dehydrated mushroom which were in no way \"crispy.\"  We also had a side of rice that was mushy in some parts but crunchy in others and an order of Sichuan Green Beans. The green beans were described as being tossed with garlic and having a black bean glaze.  What we actually got: Green beans soaked in what tasted like over salted soy sauce.\n\nDessert: Didn't want to put ourselves through the experience of any more bad food, so we opted to skip dessert. \n\nOverall: We did have a really fun time listening to music and looking at all the interesting decorations and decor.  So I would put this place into the same category as Hooters in that you don't go for the food, you go to look at pretty, interesting things and for a unique experience.  And this place really delivers on giving patrons something out of the ordinary.  But if your main draw is great food this is not the place for you.  I would also say that if you want to have a nice quiet intimate conversation you might want to keep looking, the music is quite loud and while it makes for a fun high energy environment, it was hard to carry on a conversation. My final thought is that neither Hubby or I became ill after eating, so there don't seem to be any issues with food sanitation or cleanliness, just poor execution.  I think if they revamped their menu or changed chefs they could be absolutely unstoppable!", "author": "Stephanie C."}

Now that I've been, I have no reason to return.\n\nThe ambiance is awesome.  Let's start there.  The place is a neat room, well-decorated and lit appropriately.  It's a tiki lounge and feels like it.  There's a dance floor that looks like it's part of an old ship (along with the wheelhouse part of the ship, which you can sit and sip expensive drinks in).  Every 15 minutes or so there's a fake thunderstorm that lasts about 30 seconds.  (They could really do with a subwoofer or three to help sell the thunder.)  There's a pond with a floating bandstand.  it's a neat environment.\n\nMy impression of the place began to suffer after that, though.  They are very inflexible about their rules.  I was there with a group of about 9 colleagues to have drinks and perhaps dinner.  Some wanted to eat, some already had eaten before arriving.  The bar area has very small tables and really wasn't suitable for those who wanted to dine.  However, they were unwilling to seat us in the dining area (which had plenty of vacancy) unless EVERYONE purchased an entree.  So we sat in the bar area because two people weren't eating.\n\nThis place is EXPENSIVE.  The drinks are $12-16.  The dishes are $13-30.  I ordered the Chow Chow, which is a greasy chow mein-style dish.  If you want some protein added, the dish runs $30.  It was tasty enough, but certainly not $30 worth.\n\nAfter we'd been there drinking multiple $13 frozen drinks for about 90 minutes, a band started playing on the floating bandstand.  They played all covers and really it just made it more difficult to carry on a conversation.  They weren't remotely interesting to me, but whatever.\n\nThen we got the bill.  We'd already had plenty of time to be prepared for the shock of the prices, but there was a little bit of added fun that I have never seen before:  $5 cover charge per person added to the dinner check!\n\nIt's not enough that we were absolutely gouged for food and drinks, but because there was an awful cover band playing, we were automatically subject to $5 apiece extra!  (It turns out there's a note at the entrance that tells you this, but at no time did anyone bother to ensure we were aware we'd be charged just to enter the room.)\n\nAm I glad I have finally experienced the Tonga Room?

The bar opened at 5 and although it was only 5:20 when we arrived, we already had to wait in line. Once we got seated, we ordered the lava bowl for two and the calamari dish. The drink was adorable - incredibly long straws dipped into the center of a bowl filled with alcohol and ice with pineapple hanging off the side. For such a small drink, it was VERY strong but sweet. For me, the calamari appetizer dish stole the spotlight. A thin fried layer around a big piece of squid crunched in my mouth  after every bite.  It tasted even better after I dipped the calamari into a white dip that has the texture of tartar sauce with a tasteful hint of lemon and herbs that leaves a pleasant aftertaste, making me crave for more.  I would come back JUST for the calamari next time!\n\nThe atmosphere of Tonga was fun. It felt like I was in a different country really and the sudden thunder and rain at the pool made it even more fun. This place would be great for parties and I highly recommend it!

I can't imagine paying full price for this meal. Let me break it down for you.\n\nAPPETIZERS (just a note, you only get 1 per person)\n\nShiitake Egg Rolls: Tasted like a plain egg roll.\n\nTonga Aloha Ribs: Pretty tasty. The flavor reminded me of the Chinese style beef jerky, the juicy kind. The meat was very tender, I couldn't get enough of it. \n\nChicken Satay: The chicken was a little dry, the sauce was ok. Nothing special.\n\nENTREES\n\nFire Cracker Prawns: Big, fat juicy prawns! 3 per person. It also came with lots of red bell peppers and peapods. I only remember that they were juicy.. I can't seem to remember what kind of flavor it was cooked with. Guess it wasn't that good.\n\nMongolian Beef: This dish didn't taste like the usual mongolian beef you get outside, it was better. The beef was very tender and my boyfriend loved the mushrooms that came with the dish. It also came with a crispy, chip like noodle. Just a piece of advice, break up the crispy noodles and add it to your plate when you're going to eat it  but do not mix it in the sauce early on! It will get soggy. I enjoyed this dish very much.\n\nDragon Chicken: I didn't really care too much for the dragon chicken. It was cooked with a black bean sauce, the same sauce chinese restaurants use to cook clams. I think there was some kind of choy in it too. This was my least favorite dish of the night.\n\nSIDES\n\nSzechwan Green Beans: WOW! Yummy! Who knew green beans could be so delicious. I couldn't stop eating it! I really like my vegetables cooked well but not overcooked. They had a wonderful crisp to it, it was like snacking on popcorn or something. It was so flavorful too! \n\nJasmine Rice: It's rice.. there's nothing else I could really say about it.\n\nDESSERT\n\nBanana Mousse Cake: Let me start off by saying that I don't really like banana flavored things. I told myself I would just take one bite then I can grab dessert at a nearby ice cream shop. I expected to be disappointed. BEST DISH OF THE NIGHT!!!! The mousse itself had 2 layers: banana mousse on top and the bottom tasted like banana cheese cake, topped with a slice of dried banana with peanut butter banana flavored sauce on the side, and a little bit of granola on the other side. WOW WOW WOW!! Soooo good. We each had our own dish, thank goodness.. or else we would've been licking off the plate. We both finished our dessert in no time. I didn't go to the nearby ice cream shop as planned, my stomach was happily filled with the banana mousse cake.\n\nThe interior was nice, I truly felt like I left San Francisco. The lights were dimmed, I sat under a little tiki tent made of straws, there were a lot of dimmed decorative lights, and my mai tai came in a cup that looked like a coconut topped with a mini umbrella.  I had dinner around 6pm so the band wasn't there yet. It would rain over the pond every 20-ish minutes with thunder sound effects. It was a good experience even though the food (minus the dessert) was just ok. When the bill came, it was $144 for the both of us without the certificate. We paid $107 ($67 google offer, $10 tax, $30 tip) for the meal. I don't mind paying what we paid ONCE in my lifetime mainly because of the atmosphere. With that said, I don't think I will be coming back. I think I can get all the food I ordered at a Chinese restaurant for a third of what I paid.", "author": "Laura L."}

You wait in a long line and then eventually are asked if you need a table. I said no we'd just like to have a drink at the bar. We are let in and told to go in to the right to the bar area which we did. Most of the table seating areas are closed off, and of the area they were seating in the tables are at about 30% occupancy with still 30 people in line. We went to order drinks and a bar stool became available, sitting down to order, were promptly told by a passing \"hostess\" those were for people waiting in line. We did wait in line! But if we wanted our butt to touch a chair, we were told we should have waited for a table. Rules are rules but these are very unaccomodating, vague, and communicated very, very rudely by the dark haired staff hostess. Pretty much everyone coming in after us went through the same confusion and assault by this woman. Hilarious though we put our jackets and coats on a chair and no one threw them off! You can't sit but it's ok if your coat and purse do! What a shame, such a great hotel and fun bar experience was ruined by bad staff attitude.

They had a live band, playing classic rock (?) but the band plays on a boat in a pond. And before their set break, it rains over the pond while they play cheesy rain songs when this happens (ie. Who'll stop the rain, Have you ever seen the rain).\n\nI also thought they had good food. I've seen some other reviews where people mention it's bad. I'd really disagree! I was happy with everything we ordered. They also have strong drinks! Because there was a big party the night we were there, the dance floor was packed, which made it seem like a bad 80s wedding... but in a good way. I danced with myself, my husband, and strangers.

It's completely cheesy and very much like a Pacific Island version of the Rainforest Cafe, but the drinks are incredible.

In my opinion, Roy's has better Mai Tais.\nPina Colada - my friends who aren't Pina Colada fans loved this, so that says something.\nZombie - solid mixed drink, but nothing to write home about\nLava Bowl - fun because it lives up to its name. Feels like lava going down your throat. Fruit chunks and lots of booze. I drank one by myself, since the serving size for this particular drink aren't as big as you'd think. \nScorpion - my second favorite drink of the night.

Some young kids on my team booked the room for a fun experience for a going away party.   We booked a table of six.   I knew instinctively when I arrived we were in the wrong place....no ambience and as several reviewers have said, an overall apathy.   When I arrived as the host of my party, the hostess did not make eye contact and greet me saying she'd be with me...instead she and four waiters appeared to be negotiating where people got sat...nothing says opportunism more than that to me.   I arrived at the table, saw the menu prices (outrageous), drink prices (OK to over priced) and then saw people helping themselves to a buffet.   We'd been given menus at our places, and mind you, it was 1/5th full at 6:30 PM.    I asked about the buffet, and the waiter said, only 20 minutes left it closes at 7 PM.  I don't know about you, and as someone who never really looks at how much my check is, I'm not a penny pincher, but I HATE it when you're somewhere, there's a buffet or happy hour and the team doesn't have the courtesy to tell you pre-emptively as a choice.\n\nI looked at the menu I had which said buffet, $65 each and I looked at the very casual clientele and asked the waiter what the offer was, he said \"$10 per person only until 7 PM\"...my guests and I quickly served ourselves and sat down having ordered our first round of drinks.   Only after we brought our plates back did the manager come over and say, you know, you were supposed to order from the dinner menu, and we'll make an exception for you availing yourself of the buffet, just this once.   I looked around and didn't see any distinction between where we were and where the happy hour folks were sitting...it seemed very very SCAMMY to me.    \n\nWe proceeded to order close to $200 in food & beverage, and I was prepared to spend more, but the indifferent service coupled with inferior outrageously priced food as well as 2 out of 6 water glasses rimmed in lipstick made me tip the least I have in 30 years....I was highly disappointed, trying not to show it for my guests, but we could have had a totally different night...I will never recommend this place.   My Mai Tai was 2/3rd ice and 1/3rd drink....and costs more than several great mixology institutions here in SF.

I would dare to say...I totally agree. First off, you'd never know it was there. It's hidden in the back of the gorgeous Fairmont Hotel at the top of the hill in San Francisco and upon turning the corner inside the hotel's long corridor, you are welcomed by a bit of both a time and place warp. \n\nThe restaurant -- built in the late 40s -- is a south pacific haven away from city life. It is centered around the original hotel pool, which now serves as a stage for the boat that carries the most awesome cover band. I felt like I was on stage in South Pacific and in a 1970s tiki dream at the same time...all the while, drowning in cocktail/asian food heaven. \n\nThe mongolian beef was out of this world -- made with gorgeous beef tenderloin. The tequila cocktail was my favorite (tematangi ubangi).\n\nThere is a dance floor, a big bar, and great, super kind service. I will be back again for sure.", "author": "Autumn N."}

We went on a Friday night at 10pm and had to wait about 20 minutes to get in. We didn't get any food but we did get their giant tropical fishbowl cocktail that was rum mixed with rum with a dash of rum. We drank two amongst the three of us. The atmosphere was magical. My friend described it as a Rainforest Cafe for adults. The coolest thing about the bar/restaurant was the pool in the center with a live band floating in a little boat. They played the most wonderfully cheesy covers and every 30 minutes they played CCR \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\" and it would literally rain. There was the occasional bachelorette party and group of bros, but the vibe wasn't douchy at all. I think everyone understood we were on holy bar ground and that we were expected to behave. The fishbowl of alcohol was $30 each, but that's a deal if you're sharing, because we were each getting about two drinks out of it.

I came here for a sorority alum dinner and most of the girls got that special groupon/livingsocial-like coupon that gave them a 3-course dinner for $30-ish.  What did they get served?  P.F. Chang-ish Chinese food.  I refuse to eat Chinese food in a restaurant whose theme is revolving around a Pacific Islander theme.  So I got the Moon Salad.  Bland fish in soy sauce with few scatterings of greens.\n\nIt also doesn't help that when I ask for a description of a dish, I have a server yelling in my ear without giving me much of an answer and then demanding that I order within 5 minutes of being seated.  That's the kind of service I expect in a cheap Chinese restaurant like ABC in MP.  Whatevs.\n\nOther than that, the place is really nice inside.  Which is probably why it attracts so many tourists.  At least 75% of the patrons that night looked like tourists.\n\nPerhaps this is a place to go to for drinks but definitely not for dinner.", "author": "Linh V."}

Not too much alcohol in them for the price.\n-Miso soup was bland; no miso flavor; only chicken broth. The worst miso soup I've ever had. You can buy better tasting soup at the market. \n-The edamame was typical but with a pico de gallo powder on it. Too salty for our tastes; but the edamame was OK.\n-Rice was undercooked.\n-Vegetables (fire cracker) were just OK; they were grilled with a soupy broth. Not much flavor to it.\n-Parking: if you park at the Fairmont Hotel: $5/20 minutes; max. rate was $55 I believe. We ended up staying 1 hr 15 min and didn't rush through our dinner. Good luck finding a spot on the street; as everyone else parks there, including the local residents. You pretty much have to park at the hotel or somewhere nearby, and your wallet gets reamed for it.\n\nConclusion:\n-If you want a similar environment/ambiance, try The Rainforest Cafe. Your wallet will thank you.\n-After seeing this place on No Reservations, we were excited about it and anxious to try it out; expecting great/stellar food. Total disappointment.\n-My wife has rolled out better dishes from our humble kitchen, albeit at a far cheaper price.\n-The value just wasn't there, and we won't go back.", "author": "Chuck S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-01", "description": "It can be very easy to forget to do all the touristy things when you actually live in a city. For example, I lived in New York City for a year, but I never went to the top of the Empire State Building. Perhaps even worse, I grew up in the Bay Area and have lived in San Francisco for a year now, yet I have never rode on a cable car. I know. It's pathetic. Luckily, I crossed one item off the San Francisco Tourist To-Do List the other night when I went to dinner at The Tonga Room, one of the city's quirky landmarks.\n\nThe Tonga Room and Hurricane Bar is nestled within the Fairmont Hotel, which is great because you can pretend that you are a rich and fancy person when you go to the swanky restrooms. As for The Tonga Room itself, it's a lot of fun, with an element of Las Vegas-esque theatricality. Seated in a bamboo chair under a thatched hut-style roof, with tribal masks on the walls and a bright blue lagoon in the center of the room, it feels like a little slice of \"Disneyland for Adults\" right here in San Francisco.\n\nMy friends and I went to dinner with a coupon we had all purchased from PopSugar City, which entitled us each to half-off the \"Kao Island Dinner\" plus a cocktail. Of course, there's an extensive a la carte menu, but The Tonga Room is perfectly suited to a lively dinner with a large group, and to that end it offers three variations of a family-style menu, ranging from the Kao Island Dinner ($45/person) up to the Pangai Island Dinner ($65/person). Our menu included the following:\n\n1st Course: Baby back ribs with Kona coffee barbecue sauce, shiitake mushroom eggrolls, and vegetable tempura.\n\n2nd Course: Szechwan-spiced firecracker prawns, Mongolian beef with crispy rice noodles, \"Huli Huli\" chicken with pineapple and water chestnuts in a soy sauce glaze, Szechwan green beans, and jasmine rice.\n\n3rd Course: Banana mousse cake with a peanut butter ganache and a macadamia nut crumble.\n\nGenerally, at restaurants that are all about the atmosphere, the food tends to be subpar. However, the food at The Tonga Room was actually quite good! Take my advice and show up hungry, as we weren't able to finish even half of the food that was brought to us.\n\nOur coupon also included any cocktail costing $12 or less. I asked the waiter if it was true that they were famous for their mai tais, and upon his confirmation, we ordered those around the entire table. The mai tais are made with Bacardi 151, so be prepared for what you're getting yourself into! That being said, they are quite delicious and come in funny tiki cups adorned with mermaids and, of course, a paper umbrella on top.\n\nThe meal wouldn't have been complete without the entertainment of the Island Groove Band, a cover band that plays on Wednesday through Sunday evenings around 8pm (with a cover charge of $5 or $7 depending on the night). The band performs on a boat that \"sails\" out onto the lagoon - retreating, of course, when it is time for the periodic fake rainstorms.\n\nThe Hurricane Bar also offers a solid happy hour on Wednesday through Sunday, which additionally includes an all-you-can-eat buffet for $9.50 on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.\n\nThere has been some controversy in the last couple years over rumored plans to move the Fairmont's ballroom into the area currently occupied by The Tonga Room. My friends and I had a fantastic time at dinner the other night, so I'm happy to report that those plans have been shelved for the time being. It doesn't sound like The Tonga Room will be closing its doors anytime soon, but still, if you haven't yet checked out this San Francisco oddity, I'd suggest that you round up some pals and book yourselves a table soon!", "author": "Katherine K."}

Having grown up on an island, an Island themed venue seemed like the natural choice. \n\nWe made the reservation before bothering to read reviews on Yelp. Imagine our horror when we read about the food and service! We have lots of options for this event and were not about to fork over a fortune for cheap Chinese. So we shared our concerns with the catering manager and went in for a tasting with fingers crossed. \n\nKen was our server on the night of the tasting. He was amazing...attentive but invisible except when needed. After sampling the Tonga platter, we found that the chicken satay, crisp shitake spring rolls and coconut shrimp were spot on in terms of temperature, flavor and presentation. The hot and sour soup was not the corn starchy goo you get at Panda Express. We enjoyed various fruity concoctions including pina coladas, margaritas, a Tongan itch, Mai Tais, lava bowls and Pineapple royales. The cocktails were tasty if a little fruity. But they were  in line with expectations.  \n\nAfter a little back and forth, Lucas the manager got us hooked up with a menu consisting of Tongan platters, miso soup and choice of fennel crusted butterfish, smoked chicken with Tongan fried rice and rib eyed steak with salad.

The baked alaska with pineapple ice cream at the end of the meal was rich and delicious. And although we had planned on cutting out before the cover band came on, some of our guest wanted to hang out a little longer. So we stayed. The next thing you know, two and a half hours have elapsed. And the place was closing. \n\nOur night at the Tonga Room not only pleased our palates and satiated our appetites, but it exceeded our expectations in every way. So if you are looking for an unforgettable evening or a venue for a special occasion, I recommend you give this place a try. For us, this was a night to remember.", "author": "Angelica S."}

As it is deep within the hotel, it is a very very large windowless \"room\", decorated in a hawaiin theme. All the chairs have \"leys\" on them, and the center of the gigantic room is a floating stage on  a pool of water. They float the stage out into the middle of the room while the band is playing, and retract it when the band is on break.\n\nService was top notch. My water glass was always full, and they were very quick on the drink refills. A note on their drinks, I had some strawberry frozen margaritas that I think I could have put back all night if cost was no object, and the rum based drinks were quite potent. \n\nThe food itself was surprisingly tasty, and fresh, and was served 15 minutes after we ordered it. I was pretty stuff.\n\nThere's a dance floor as well designed to look like the deck of a ship...kinda annoyingly placed as you cannot walk to and from your table without passing through the dace floor...as the restaurant is in a hotel, the bathrooms are a good 5 minute walk outside of the restaurant down a hall.\n\nAll in all, a great time for my friend's birthday and a change of scene. The music was great too, but they did all covers of slightly older/classic tunes.", "author": "Jordan C."}

The appetizers are over priced and so are the drinks. Our bill was nearly $100 and let me tell you we left hungry, not that we could have ordered more food because our server was no where to be found. We even waited a very long time just to get the check. We had to walk around and find our waiter in order to pay so we could finally leave! \n\nAs far as being intimate...not so much. This place has room for potential but the music was so loud I could barely hear across the table. This is super casual as well. If you walk in dressed to impress you wasted time because there are lots of people who come here in jeans and flip flops. There are lots of party groups here so you will see people dressed but again it isn't what you would consider romantic. \n\nI did see the manager walk around and look at how busy the place was but did not see him stopping to check on guest and to me that was disappointing. If you are looking for customer service to make your night extra special and make your date, your party, or your guest feel like they matter then maybe you should think of another place.

The buffet was very streamlined and for our needs, not very filling.  They served spring rolls, shrimp chips, chow mien (American version), teriyaki wings (tiny wings).  We told ourselves next time we would come strictly for the drinks and ambiance.  *They forced us to give them a credit card as we were seated as a hold (even though we told them we were paying in cash).  They charged us on the card for the buffet and we paid cash for the buffets and drinks.  It took a few days for them to reverse the charge and irritated my boyfriend for the inconvenience. \n\nAside from being overcharged/inconvenienced up front, the decor is soooo COOL.  I love the retro tiki theme, staged area in the middle of the water and the pseudo rain showers with sound effects.  The tropical themed drinks and decor wrapped up in a unique time warp at the Tonga Room is a must see.\n\nThis would be a perfect place to host a birthday party or a mid week escape!  ***Just be clear with your server that if you plan on paying in cash, you've been given the heads up that they are known for overcharging people (forcing you to use your card when you plan on using cash).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-10-17", "description": "I think I'm in love. Last night, I suggested to my husband that we move into the Tonga Room. Here's why...\n\nFirstly, I love tiki rooms. They thrill me with their over-the-top commitment to outlandish decor, fruity drinks and demon rum. Smuggler's Cove is our local pirate bar, but I think Tonga Room has fully blown it away in terms of grandeur and it's provision of edibles. As soon as you enter Tonga Room, you are greeted by massive totems, huge ikat wall hangings and colorful lights strung between the palm-thatched huts of a small village around a pool. And on the water, there's a houseboat. That's where the band lives. And it rains inside this tropical paradise. Seriously. But I'm getting ahead of myself...\n\nOkay, secondly, Tonga Room ran a killer Facebook deal: $31 for one Kao Island dinner and a mai tai or pi\u00f1a colada (a $62 value). This deal was extra wonderful because of its take on multiple deals per party--the minimum number of coupons per table was two, and the fine print actually encouraged inviting friends. This allowed six of us to redeem our deals at a big, festive dinner together, and also left room in our budget for extra fruity drinks. *applause*\n\nThirdly, when I called to make our reservation, I was specifically asked if there were any food allergies in our group. This is golden customer service!! I have to avoid gluten, which the lovely lady minding the phone duly noted. Every person taking table reservations should be trained to do this--many food allergies can be made less annoying for both staff and customers with a little advanced warning, and that can be facilitated by simply asking at the first point of contact.\n\nFourthly, our waiter was absolutely adorable! He was friendly and attentive, and dealt with my food allergies carefully and amiably. He was absolutely wonderful! While tropical offerings are often easy dining for the gluten-free, he was mindful of what modifications my food needed and always made sure I knew what I needed to about what was on the table. (Thus saving me from myself--were it not for this kindly gentleman, I would have tucked into the Kona coffee-glazed pork ribs and been in a world of hurt, as their soy sauce admixture has gluten in it.)\n\n--Any place that not only anticipates food allergies, but also accommodates diners with special needs so delightfully deserves special commendation. My dinner was tasty and plentiful--as an added bonus, my specially segregated servings were particularly large, ensuring that I wanted for nothing and even had a tasty to-go bag at the end. *standing ovation*\n\nFinally, the band was awesome. This dashing trio of songsters floated out in the midst of a tropical downpour to delight us with wonderfully delivered tropical treats. Several mai tais in, my musical friend was noting their brave choices--Night Fever was delivered in a truly awesome falsetto to make the Bee Gees proud, and Santana's compositions were covered with panache. I have a high cringe factor where music is concerned, and these guys never once triggered it. After many potent potables served in volcanoes, totems and coconuts, we were happily singing in the rain. It was so much fun.\n\nTo top it off, this fabulously outlandish establishment is nestled in the elegant environs of the Fairmont Hotel, so at the end of the evening it is easy to get a taxi out front while marveling at the heights of Nob Hill.

The excitement of the exhibit, mixed with the exorbitantly priced \"exotic\" libations, \"oriental\" munchies and a band that somehow manages incorporate shred-worthy synthesized guitar solos into songs like Louis Armstrong's \"What A Wonderful World\", puts guests at the risk of developing family-holiday-in-hell feelings that dictate one's plying themselves into a stupor with punches, daiquiris, and slings a-plenty to weather the tropical depression of what should be a genuine \"am-I-still-in-San-Francisco?\" experience.

It didn't totally bother me until around 9pm when there were an equal amount of drunk adults and small kids. It made the night slightly awkward as I don't think the bar area is really family friendly. \n\nThe second complaint is that the service is truly terrible. I think they must have the same waitstaff as when they opened the Tonga Room in the 1960's. Two of the servers actually got in a huge argument by our table. One of the waitresses actually spilled a drink on someone at my table. And it took forever to get our orders taken, so thank god the drinks were as strong as they were. Otherwise I'd unfortunately be sober in this delightfully tacky establishment.", "author": "Monica C."}

But there is rain with thunder every 20 minutes and the decor of this funny yet lovely room dates from the 40s when people were too busy saving the free world to make fake singing animals. (And while I'm a great fake animal lover, I find the Rainforest Cafe too fake!)\n\nWhen I first ate here years ago it seemed cute yet funky. This time, it was charming and elegant, and as close to eating in a quiet version of Disneyland Tiki room as you'll find (it's quiet before 8, when the band arrives, and the band is fun).\n\nThe service was EXCELLENT, our waiter was there when we wanted, invisible when we didn't. No hovering, but also no waiting.\n\nThe food is thoroughly Americanized Chinese (with a touch of Hawaii), and it's very fresh, well made and tasty. Don't expect anything gourmet, like Tommy Toy's, or authentic and spicy (like Chinatown), but do expect that everyone you bring here can find something to eat and enjoy. My favorite was the Huli Huli chicken, which is in a sweet pinapple sauce, and the Mongolian beef which was not really mongolian, but very tender steak.\n\nThe portions ARE large enough to share. We had three diners and we each ordered and entree, and there was enough to take home for a dinner for two the next night.\n\nEntrees start at $23, which is high, but you're paying for the experience and if you like this kind of thing, it's well worth it.\n\nWeekdays from 5-7 you can get the all-you-can-eat appetizer buffet for $9.50 (plus one drink, which'll set you back at least $6.50).\n\nThis isn't an everyday place--but it is fun, and unique, as there are very few original tiki restaurants around anymore.\n\nThe big drawback for this area is parking. Street parking requires a miracle (my wife will soon be sainted for twice finding a spot). Parking in the Fairmont costs around $18 per hour, which is highway robbery sans highway. They do NOT validate.\n\nDepending on the day and time, you can park for a flat rate of as little as $15 at the Brockelbank Garage at 1040 Sacramento--literally right next door to the Fairmont. I was there before 6 on Sunday and it was $15. At 6pm it promptly went up to $20. You've been warned.\n\nSo, know what you're getting into and ENJOY IT, it's fun, like a wonderful WWII time warp.", "author": "Daniel W."}

Our first night in town, a Wednesday, we went and there was a line out the door as they were at capacity for a special event. We didn't feel like waiting, so we went back the next day for Happy Hour. The Scorpion Bowl for 2 tasted great, but I was really disappointed at the size. Everywhere else I've been, the Tonga Room's version of a Scorpion Bowl for 2 has been the size for 1. Upon learning about the Happy Hour Buffet, we decided to partake. Strangely, you can't put your name in to wait for a table while you sip a drink at the bar, and you can't have a drink outside the dining room while you wait. Oh well. We sat outside the dining room and waited about 10 minutes and were brought into a table to begin our dinner. For $10, especially in an expensive city, the buffet was a good value. It included fruit, fried rice, 2 kinds of wings, lo mein, and mini eggrolls. You have to purchase at least one drink per person, so I tried the Mai Tai, which was good and strong, and my boyfriend got a ChiChi (Pina Colada), which was also delicious.

Do they warn people with epilepsy? Also, the band in a boat. The band is terrible and they play in a boat. Wearing Hawaiian shirts. I kind of loved the band in the boat. I felt like an American Idol judge as I sat there listening to them croon \"Change the World.\"\n\nThe happy hour drinks menu is moderately priced and each drink comes topped with one of those mini-umbrellas that instantly make everything more festive. The \"Pineapple Royale\" (from the regular cocktail menu) is a slushy mixture that comes in a hollowed out pineapple with a gigantic straw. It was so cool to be drinking out of a hollowed out pineapple with a gigantic straw that I didn't really notice how it tasted. The pina colada is pretty good, if a little on the weak side, and there is a drink whose silly name I can't remember that comes in a cool tiki glass. \n\nThe macadamia garlic spread appetizer is very heavy-handed. We needed to scrape most of the spread off our bread because it was ridiculously dense and garlicky. It was like day-old naan with nuts and relish for $12. \n\nDinner menu is overpriced pan-Asian food and while I didn't try any of the meat entrees, I can say that the the sole vegetarian entree, \"Alena's Mix\", is a whole lot of badly marinated tofu with carrots, broccolini, and mushrooms for a whopping $24. I've made better at home. My friend's \"Mongolian Beef Tenderloin\" was apparently pretty good but the $9.95 happy hour buffet is probably a better deal for most people.\n\nFor dessert, we had the volcano, some kind of mousse concoction with a raspberry center that was covered in whip and topped with a chocolate triangle that was served flaming. It was surrounded by chocolate and raspberry syrup on one side and two mysterious powders on the other. We ultimately decided it tasted like ground-up red velvet cake doused with gasoline, but not in a bad way. \n\nService is slow but they give you leis! It's hard to be unhappy about the service with colorful fake flowers around your neck, especially if you're kinda drunk.\n\nSix drinks, appetizer, two entrees, and dessert for $160.

Unfortunately, the Fairmont folks have gotten the idea in their heads that they can make more money by turning the land where the Tonga Room is into condos. Super lame!\n\nAnyway, the Tonga Room feels more like an attraction at Disneyland than a restaurant: diners are seated in an enormous A-frame with outrigger canoes or beneath thatched huts with a simulated night sky above. Not to mention the \"rain storm\" that occurs every 20 minutes or so, with thunder sounds and lightning and water falling into the lagoon (er, pool). \n\nThe setting and decor are unquestionably awesome, but the food is widely considered to be bad. Most folks advise to go during happy hour, but we weren't able to be so choosy with our time of visit so we took our chances with dinner and I actually was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't all that hungry, so I got the mussels with Portuguese sausage, Maui onions and shoestring potatoes. The broth was made with Kona Longboard lager and it was so savory that I had to sop it up with the bread. I also nabbed the miso eggplant from my boy's plate of flatiron steak, which was doused in a sort of sweet sauce that we enjoyed but not might be to everyone's tastes. \n\nIt will be such a shame if the hotel's plans come to fruition because the Tonga Room is just on another level, definitely one of the best tiki bars in the country.

I'd heard so much about this happy hour and was excited when I had the opportunity to try it on a Tuesday night.\n\nMy friend and I arrived at the Tonga Room at 6:35 p.m.; we were told that the food would be cleared promptly at 7 p.m. (when happy hour ends), so we would have to eat fast! We decided to go with the $9.95 happy hour buffet since we probably weren't going to have a chance to eat dinner otherwise. \n\nI was pretty disappointed in the food selection - almost all of the food was greasy and fried. There was a selection of fried egg rolls, fried won tons, vegetarian chow mein, kalaua pork, cheeses and fruit. I had the egg roll which was fine (mostly just tasted like fried-ness) and vegetarian chow mein (which mostly just tasted like grease). I ate a bit, but it probably wasn't worth our $9.95. The happy hour drink specials (which run the gamut from mai tais to tropical takes on margaritas) were $7.50 ($1.50 off the normal $9 price). If you're in the neighborhood around happy hour and need something to eat, it's not a terrible option (since there isn't much in the immediate vicinity), but definitely not a destination (not even for the fake rain - the fake rain reminds me of when they water the vegetables at Safeway).", "author": "Wendy L."}

The Tonga Room called 2 days prior to confirm the reservation and let us know that if we would like to stay for the live band that starts playing at 8pm which we did not end up staying for. \n\nThere was no hostess to greet us when we arrived. After waiting for several minutes the manager came to greet us and walked us to our table. The staff was very nice and accommodating and the decor was whimsical and created a fun atmosphere to enjoy with a group. We were seated along one side of the pool/ lagoon which was fun. When the thunder and \"rain\" storm would start it was a little difficult to hear our conversations, but the rain only lasts about 30 seconds each time and the intervals were pretty far apart so it was still a fun touch.\n\nThe food. Ugh! I wish I could say better things, but it was basically mediocre Chinese food, at best. They served us appetizers which were a few rib pieces and 4 pieces of tempura veggies.They only brought out 2 plates even though there were six of us and they should have brought 3 for the money. Also, the Mai Thai was much better than the Pina Colada. \n\nThe \"Mongolian beef\" wannabe was not the tiniest bit spicy as you might expect. Everything was edible, but nothing special. And when our bill came we were charged for tax and tip, which ended up being $91 a  couple (including the $31 x 2 people deal and tax & tip). So, the tax and tip was basically half of the bill because it was charged on the full amount before the discount was subtracted.

It was basically just stir-fried beef and veggies in a sweet, thick sauce. My entree was from the menu -- Grilled Tri-Tip.

And no, they did not charge us the cover charge.  We were only there about 15-20 minutes while the band was playing.\n\nAs for the band, they're pretty cool.

But the worst part by far was the service. When I presented my coupon, the waiter snapped at me and my date and started yelling at us about how we should be paying more, and shouldn't be getting away with a discount...the original bill came out to $150!!!! for 2 people (for some dry chicken, rice and green beans). \n\nTerrible food, terrible service, outrageously overpriced, and the band should've paid me a $7 cover to put up with them...skip this place.", "author": "alan R."}

Tonga Room and Hurricane Bar take \"kitchy\" to a whole new level! Aside from the 25 minute wait to enter, we had fun. I am sure you've already heard about the band who plays on a boat in the pool, and the rain storms, and the pirate ship dance floor...we were lucky enough to get a table for two and surprisingly quick service. We ordered the punch bowl for two. It was really fun and refreshing to drink. My hubby ordered some vegetarian spring rolls and noodles for appetizers. I tried them both and was pleasantly surprised. The reason I say I was, \"pleasantly surprised,\" is because often times when the ambiance, performances and bells and whistles are what the bar/restaurant is known for the food isn't very good. We thoroughly enjoyed our apps, however. Aside from the drinks and food, the music was all very catchy. Oldies but goodies greatest hits kind of songs.

Yes, the band is very cheesy and plays Ricky Martin covers from a floating platform in the middle of a lagoon. Yes, it \"rains\" and \"storms\" every 20 minutes. Yes, you can dance with your grand-parents on a pirate ship dance floor.

Now, I'm an absolute sucker for anything tropical, so this place definitely rocked my socks off. Upon walking in, you feel like u are boarding a pirate ship in a very tropical place. Each little table area is covered by a straw canopy, so you feel like you are in an island bungalo, and then in the middle of the restaurant there is a little pond-pool thing.\n\nWe had reservations so we were seated right away, right by the water. After looking at the menu, the food was a bit expensive so I decided to go with a kids meal--chow mein with a spare rib, for $12 (compared with the $27 adult meal). The menu did look quite delicious though. Us girls also decided to get the four-person lava bowl, with fruit juices and rum. This drink didn't taste really good, but the concept was awesome. It's a big bowl that they put in the middle of the table, and then you are given these extremely long straws so everyone sitting at the table can enjoy the drink. Very fun concept!\n\nThe food arrived and it was quite delicious, and I would say the perfect portion size as well. I finished mine (and no, it wasn't because I got the kids plate-it was the same size as an adult plate), and I was perfectly satisfied... not too full but not hungry by any means.\n\nWhile we were eating our meal, a live band started to play, and this is where it gets really cool. The band was standing in a little tiki hut-type thing, and then it separated from the side of the pond and floated to the middle of the pond, becoming a boat. How freaking awesome is that?!?! The band was pretty good too, they played good music and were a lot of fun. Plus they also gave a shout out to the bride-to-be, which is always fun. \n\nI would say that if you are willing to drop some money, and really like island-themed places, this is the place to go. Definitely would be fun on a date or with a group of people. Ya'll better hurry up and get your butts there though, I hear that they are closing down soon.

I checked this Yelp page for pictures to see if the ambiance was suitable for me and my girlfriend's anniversary. Having just come back from Hawaii a few months ago, it was nice to have that whole \"Hawaii\" feel again. The random rainstorms here and there were pretty cool. It rains somewhat heavily onto the pool area, so it's not just flashing lights and thunder sounds.\n\nOnto the food:\n\nWe started off with a couple drinks. I got the punch, which I expected would be watered down, but it was surprisingly strong. Just the right about to taste the alcohol, but not too much that it was nasty.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the scallops and I got the butterfish. The scallops were a pretty reasonable size (even though there was only 4). The butterfish was fully of flavor and the crab on top was delicious. Unfortunately, like many high-end restaurants, the portions were ridiculously small. Good thing we ate a few hours before our dinner at the Tonga Room.\n\nFor dessert, we got the banana mousse with peanut butter...so good! I'm a sucker for peanut butter and the combination of banana and peanut butter was perfection.\n\nOverall, we had a pretty fun experience. Our timing sucked though because as we were paying our bill, the band was just setting up, so we didn't get to hear any music during our dinner. A pretty good restaurant, definitely no regrets. Where they lack in portion, they make up for it in flavor. This place was a bit pricey, so I wouldn't eat there for a casual dinner. For our anniversary dinner, it was fine, but definitely not cheap. Two drinks, two entrees, and one dessert came out to about $95.", "author": "Jeff L."}

The restaurant used to be an indoor pool at the Fairmont until they converted it into a Tiki bar.  This is sure to impress guests at least for the first 15 minutes.   On top of the pool floats a band that plays good dance music.  \n\nThe bar is well-equipped, serving a large array of sweet alcoholic beverages.  Some of the combinations are interesting.  \n\nThe service is also pretty excellent.  A server tends to come to your table the minute you are waiting for something and this adds to the great experience of being totally immersed in a tropical poolside bar/restaurant.\n\nWhere this place falls short?  The food.\n\nMake no mistake.  The menu may SOUND cheap (because it probably should be), but the meals are very expensive.  The Tonga Room offers your traditional American/Asian cuisine with a hint of Hawaiian flavors, but for steakhouse prices.  \n\nFor example, I believe the Mongolian beef was around $35-40.  I remember having a seafood hot pot for $27.  It was basically a soy/butter bomb with what tasted like frozen fish.  Almost every dish I have had there seems to be a little overdone on the salt and fat ratio.  This may be pleasing after a few drinks, but it can weigh pretty heavily on you if you've got things to do later that evening...\n\nAlso, one thing that isn't mentioned enough is the cover charge for the band.  When I went last time it was $7.00.  \n\nThere is also a floating photographer that will charge you Disneyland prices for photos of you.  Watch out for that if you don't want to see him come to your table with photos already made including two sets of match books...  \n\nYou would think that the band and photos would be included with the food for how much they charge for simple dishes that are only slightly better than what you could get for $6-12 at any restaurant in China or Japan town...", "author": "Rocky S."}

The service staff here is rather impersonable.  The waitresses collected plates as they pleased w/o asking if we were finished.  My tropical drink...

My friend and I took our leftovers to go and gave it to homeless people.

The mixed drinks are horrendously bad (and overpriced), but the atmosphere can be really fun if you are willing to take in the kitsch and just have a good time. \n\nI hate reading reviews about this place where people are shocked at the price and scenery.

I mean it is quite the San Francisco institution- but instead of just cocktails- I decided to have dinner here one night with a Bloomspot coupon. First off I had an 8:30pm reservation. We show up and have to wait about 30 minutes for a table. Then we order and the server was quite rude- I think he was pissed because we had that Bloomspot deal and we were not ordering the $14 drinks as quick as he would have liked. \n\nSo I understand a cover charge on the entertainment when having drinks but when you have dinner... a $7 per person cover charge for entertainment on the bill. I KNOW THIS IS A TOURIST PLACE- but seriously? They should waive that for people eating dinner in the dining room. I really like the Tonga Room but feel like they are just nickel and diming me when I am there. I am a local and they should have no cover charge for locals- you know like the Vegas clubs do for locals. I was upset with the service and then the additional fees- even when you eat a full meal in the dining room. \n\nIf I ever go back- I just know now- have a couple drinks & pay the cover- the food isn't that good and overpriced.", "author": "Kimberly M."}

This is the worst restaurant I have ever eaten at. The food is appallingly bad and the service matches. Do not go. Need details? A summary before the details - fatal allergies ignored 2x, grease, grease and more grease, \"would the vegetarians all please sit together\" and we were overcharged. Imagine the greasiest, worst, cheapest Chinese you have ever had. It is worse. \n\nWe made a reservation for a party of 18 to celebrate an event. We clearly noted a nut allergy on the contract we were required to sign as well as other dietary restrictions. We even phoned before making the reservations just to be sure they could handle a few vegetarians and a guy with peanut allergies. No problem! \n\nAs the dinner part started, the waiter *repeatedly* asks me to have all the vegetarians sit together. I must have looked puzzled. Otherwise, he tells me, it is going to be difficult for him. Really? I point them out kindly instead. Everyone is already seated. This is an absurd request. Earn the tip we have already contractually agreed to pay you. \n\nAs the first course arrived, it did so with chicken wings covered in satay sauce, ribs and vegetarian spring rolls all on the same plate. No mention was made of the peanuts. The company CEO, the allergic one, leaves the table - the overwhelming smell alone is enough to affect his breathing. I remind the waiter that our contract called for no peanuts. He looks confused. I point to the wings. \"Satay sauce,\" he says. Yes, I say, made with peanuts. \"Oh. Did he eat it?\" he says while looking at the empty chair. No, he left until the next course, I reply. He assures me that they do know about the peanut allergy, and encourages me to have him eat something else off the plate (with peanut stuff on it) instead. Mind you, despite being told about the allergy and saying they knew about it, they served it on the same plate with everything anyway and failed to mention it at all. Wait for the sequel. Nuts will make a glorious return. Meanwhile, the vegetarians puzzled that you'd serve vegetarian appetizers on the same plate next to the pile of ribs to the right of the peanut wings. \n\nThe food. I have written 3 books, but don't know where to start. It was just greasy in a gross way. You could literally see the grease pooled in the veggies and the plain white rice was plain and white and rice. The chicken, beef and shrimp dishes were likewise greasy and absolutely horrible. This is insane and true - we paid a $1500 bill for this group which included a $200 discount from the manager and then went to a local diner to get something to eat. Honestly, the food is that bad. The salads which were served to the vegetarians contained tofu which was deep fried and tasted of chicken. After the taste nearly made one vegetarian barf, the manager assured us they were fried in a fryer separate from the meat. I ate one myself, and let me tell you, it actually did taste \"just like chicken.\"\n\nLest you think this group is composed of only salad-slugging vegetarians and a guy for whom peanuts are kryptonite, let me assure you that is not the case. Thank God they had alcohol or the whole thing would have been a flop. \n\nDessert arrives - a meringue made with YES YES nuts! Nuts in the meringue, on the plate and, for presentation, a swath of macadamia nut butter across the plate. The CEO dies (he didn't, but that would have been a very dramatic conclusion to this tragic, true tale). Instead, he just leaves again. The manager is summoned, and I tell him how horrible this has all been. It's the second time we have talked that night, and I am being discrete - I don't want everyone to know - but  he, too, is surprised to hear their dessert has nuts in it. \"That part?\" he said, pointing to the meringue stuff. \"There are nuts in there?\" I mean, come the hell on. We were fortunately warned by an employee. The vegetarians who refused the egg meringue were not offered alternate desserts. The CEO was, but by this point, we had already decided to go elsewhere to eat.  The manager wondered if he could get a drink or something for us. I told him he would be discounting the meal.

This makes it a perfect spot to sneak away for private conversation and banter while the hustle and bustle of the city gets shut out.

Luckily you don't need to be a guest of the hotel to go in, enjoy it's lavish and gorgeous lobby and make your way down to the Tonga room. Keep in mind the Tonga room isn't open on Monday and Tuesday and opens at 5pm (restaurant at 6pm). The Fairmont hotel was built in 1907 while the Tonga room opened in 1945, just about 10 years after the countries first tiki bar, Don the Beachcomber, opened in Hollywood. It is more of a restaurant than a bar but cocktails do take center stage for most people here, besides the decor anyway. The room is absolutely transformed to a tropical paradise, nothing cheesy and plastic but more classy and wooden with lots of Polynesian touches. The center of the room is a huge pool and every 1/2 an hour it rains over the pool accented with sounds of thunder and flashes of lighting, it's very cool. I knew the prices here would be too high and that the food would be too average so I did what everyone who wants to check out the place should do. I went when they first opened (if you go the first couple hours all drinks are a few dollars off-$8ish instead of $12), and just stuck to drinks. I got their famous Mai Tai and a Tonga Itch. Unlike what I've read elsewhere, the drinks were not served in a carved out pineapple or coconut but they did include the obligatory slice of pineapple and little umbrella. They were good, not overly sugary or too weak or too strong, both were a tad on the sour side though, nothing amazing but nothing horrible either. I was just glad that I got to see the inside of the Fairmont and to check out the decor in one of the countries most historic, beautiful, and well known tiki bars.", "author": "Matt E."}

But the food is always delicious (and bountiful), and the cocktails never disappoint.

They basically only play the top radio hits (which I can't stand), but I never really minded because it was all part of the cheesy touristy experience. And with rum filled cocktail in hand, everything is sunshine and ponies, right?\n\nBut to have $20 added to our bill for that? We already spent around $200. Come on Tonga Room, that isn't going to help you in the long run. I think after a certain point, the show should just be included. After all, I have to listen to those tunes everyday at work.

Go before they desecrate its badass historical self.\n\nFacts:\n- It's just a must-do. Great place to start the night or to bring friends from out of town.\n- It may be closed certain nights of the week. Check hours before you walk up that huge hill.\n- Sometimes they charge a cover for entertainment, around $5. This depends on the day. If you are with people who are anti-cover at all costs, either prep them (with rumors about the polynesian ukulele band which plays on a mobile gazebo raft) or ditch them in advance.\n- As with any place I strongly recommend bringing only people who are extremely excited to go. If someone says they hate Disneyland or fun, get rid of them since the magic of this place is best enjoyed by positive groups who are ready for it.\n- The Scorpion volcano bowl is freaking strong and a solid way to get a group outing off to a great start.\n- Frozen drinks are in the neighborhood of $12, so not immensely cheap, but they are served in large hurricane glasses and will sugar you generously!\n- The pirate ship-deck themed dance floor (with rope ladder edging) is not only impressive, but a magnet for the most interesting hotel guests and aging San Francisco fascinati.

It tasted like something that could come with at $4.99 combo at a cheap, take-out only Chinese place.

We were running late and I was told that we had to be there by 7:45 as they provide an additional 15 minutes wait before they give up our reservations. We got there at 7:29 on the dot. The hostess asks how large the party and said it was a long wait. I said we have reservations and she comes back that they do not take reservations for Fri/Sat.   I told her to check for our reservation. She looks and finds it and says we can't seat you because your reservation is for next year (2015). Wow. I asked for the manager and he looks dumbfounded and doesn't understand how they booked my group for next year. He explained that they outsource there calls to a call center. Not my problem and you need to find us some tables. Another hostess was trying real hard to have us leave and did not provide any sympathy. How is it that we are being blamed and being punished for there mistake. So they have us wait near the bar after 45 minutes of explaining their mistakes. We were provided 1 round of drinks on the house and our seats will be done by 9:30. We ordered there 2 appetizer sampler at $28 (Pricey for very limited food).Time goes by and the manager says they are waiting on another group to leave and should be seated by 10pm. We looked at the menu and because I couldn't get reception for internet I couldn't look at what the food looked like. So I wanted to get the most expensive thing on the menu which was the Ohana style at $56. Required four people to order but waiter let us have 3 people order the Ohana style menu. Food came up and each entree came with 3 little pieces. Wow. $166 for 3 people and still felt hungry. Food taste good, but couldn't really gauge because we had been waiting since 7:30 and was pretty much hungry to begin with, so anything would of been good. Let's just say this was not worth the time or place. Overall experience went downhill once the hostess lied about not taking reservation, their mistake in our 2015 reservation, outsourced reservation call center, expensive selection of food (This is not Plumed Horse or French Laundry). Don't use the Fairmont name just to hike up your status. Never will I refer nor take my business here. This was not my choice and I was dreading it based on some past yelp reviews.

The Satay was shockingly good while the tempura was about what you'd expect.  The star of the food was the winter squash curry.  It was AMAZING with enough heat to make it interesting and beautiful pieces of perfect squash.  Yum!!  \n\nAnd of course there are the cocktails.  I love a fruity umbrella drink and this place does all the classics.  While I didn't end up getting drunk there, it wouldn't be too hard to lose yourself in all that rum.  \n\nThey have a boat.  Yes, a boat.  On which the awesomely random cover band plays.  There's so much awesome in that string of words that I don't really feel like I need to say anything else.\n\nExcept that it rains.  Complete with thunder and lightning.  And the crowd there on a Saturday night (at least recently) includes so many ridiculous hipsters you'll think you've wandered into http://www.latfh.com/.  I love people watching and making catty comments, so this was a GOLD MINE.  All around, a great experience.", "author": "Liz P."}

Or is the line out the door only because Anthony Bourdain claims this place is one of his favorite spots in SF? Well I had a fun time with my friends here but the bill was so not fun to pay. We dropped $300 between 8 people for drinks, fried rice and appetizers. I think if I come next time I will do happy hour prices.

The atmosphere is fabulous (makes all other tiki bars hang their oversized plastic Easter Island heads in shame) the drinks are strong, the food is solid, and the crowd there is always great.  Whether surprised Fairmont patrons from out of town who didn't know what they were stumbling into, or polyester-clad hipsters looking for a virtual trip back in time, everyone I run into there is looking to have fun.\n\nUnlike some of the reviews on this site, I've always had good experiences with the wait staff there.  I've waited a bit for a drink once or twice, but there are few bars in the City where that won't happen on the weekends.  When it's not busy, staff are happy to take time out to talk with patrons, adding a neighbor feel to this cavernous bar in the middle of downtown SF.\n\nThe live band is a lot of fun, and it's hard not to feel their infectious energy when the boat -- floating in the middle of the bar in a sizable pool -- shakes back an forth while they play, with \"lightning\" flashing and \"rain\" pouring down from the lofty ceiling.  Definitely worth the relatively low $7 cover on the nights they play.\n\nBottom line: If rumors of Tonga's demise are true, I'm going to go back as much as possible until the last tiki torch is extinguished.

Yes, the rain and thunder definitely pin the needle on the Cheese-O-Meter but the place has such a wonderfully campy fake South Seas vibe you have to love it. It is also fabulously out of place at the Fairmont Hotel. A bit like putting fuzzy dice in your Rolls-Royce.\n\nObviously not a place for true Polynesian or Asian food aficionados, but I enjoyed my meal, some kind of chicken and rice dish. And the cocktails had umbrellas in them which offset there somewhat high cost and relative weakness in the alcohol department.\n\nWell sadly there are rumors the place is closing.

It's fun and kitschy, like the Rainforest Cafe, as others have mentioned, and you get a free fake flower lei. The live band, whose presence commanded a ridiculous $7 cover charge, played covers of bad music throughout the decades (from the BeeGees to Buble). \n\nThe food was terrible and really, really overpriced. It was oversauced and tasted worse than food court Chinese. My mom and I shared the Mongolian beef and huli huli chicken. Server asked if we wanted rice but didn't explain why it might be a good idea (SAUCE), or explain the family-style nature of the dishes. \n\nServer was also terrible. Felt really rushed, even though the restaurant was maybe a quarter full.

In fact he was so rushed through our whole dinner that we felt more like we were imposing on his precious time.  This left a bad impression on us!

I expected better since we are from the East Coast and here we are close to Wine country!\n  I ordered Singapore noodles with Shrimp (came with pork but I asked to hold the pork). Whoa...the shrimp was something I would serve at a Barbie doll tea party!! Shrimp looked more like \"plankton\" than shrimp.  A good Waiter should have warned me of that!  I mean these were finger nail size shrimp...the kind that I think comes in a can.   Our waiter was not familiar with the menu...he could not answer questions on a few of the dishes we inquired about.  I must mention...the menu is not large either!    \nWe sampled each dish (4 of us) and only the \"fatty\" ribs were the best meal out of the 4.  This is not a place to go to for the food.

Instead, it's the kind of hotel I worked at to help pay for grad school.  This makes me somewhat prejudiced every time I go to a tony hotel like the Ritz.  It's because I know things like, they don't allow the workers to use the same bathrooms as the customers, and they make the workers eat their dinner in the dungy basement.  Well, in the basement of the Fairmont is a fabulous kitschy place I'd happily frequent again and again.  Or at least any night I wanted to shell out $50 for tropical drinks.\n\nThe service is excellent and the entertainment is a blast at the Tonga Room.  The house band is actually pretty amazing, with a wide range of style, playing anything from Jason Mraz to Elvis.  The decor of the Tonga Room is everything you'd hope it would be, including indoor rain and lightning.  There's plenty of room on the dance floor if you feel like working off some of those tropical drinks you'll definitely end up consuming. \n\nWe went for drinks and spent $50/person, which included a $7 cover charge (for the house band).  We got seated at a nice table for drinks with hardly any wait.  It worked really well to go as a group of 4, but it also seems like it'd be a real blast to have parties here.  If you want to go for dinner on the weekend you'll need reservations.  I'm giving this a Five Star rating because I'm judging it as a bar and not a restaurant.

We went for happy hour, and I was pleasantly pleased that the other people who were there for happy hour made a line. They don't open the doors until 5 so you are standing outside the whole time. The bar area is pretty big, so everyone in line got a seat, but they escort you in one by one. During happy hour they have a buffet with chow mein, 2 types of chicken wings, Hawiian style fried rice, fresh fruit, and egg rolls, which were delicious. All of the carbohydrates  probably complimented the big drinks very well. The food was hot and the staff replenished the food quickly, only complaint was the other idiots in line who wouldn't close the lid on the food, so the heat kept escaping. We would have enjoyed listening to the band, but happy hour  was from 5-7 and the band didn't start until 8, so I guess we will have to come back to listen to that. As an fyi, if you are there when the band is playing there is a $7 cover charge per person, and the regular priced drinks are pretty pricey.

There's rainfall in the center of the room, a band playing on a boat, a pirate ship-cum-dance floor, tiki torches and mini paper lanterns everywhere. It really is like being in Disneyland. The drinks fit the theme: mai tais, margaritas, daiquiris and pina coladas topped off with mini umbrellas. \n\nNow, I would normally give this place 4+ stars based on the overall vibe, but the bar service was TERRIBLE and since I rather value good customer service, this was a biggie for me. The Tonga Room is in the Fairmont Hotel so I really didn't think that customer service would be this place's downfall. Naturally, I assumed the $12 drinks would be the part that I found most jolting. I was absolutely astounded by the chaos at the bar. We waited for 15+ minutes to get a drink and the bartenders were the antithesis of what you would imagine you'd find in a fun-filled, tiki torch-laden lounge (not to mention in a hotel of this calibre). I was already a bit put off after having to miss out on some stellar MJ songs on the dance floor whilst waiting for drinks and then to top it off, the bartenders were just unfriendly. I'm not sure if they were understaffed that night or if they weren't expecting the turn out that they got, but I really don't think that the service should *ever* be an issue at this place, especially when people are paying $10 - $15 for drinks. Icing on the cake? My boyfriend was overcharged. As if we weren't already paying inflated prices, go ahead and tack on an extra drink that no one actually had! Perfect!\n\nNote to the Fairmont: this is the perfect place to have fun, young, bubbly bartenders who act like they ENJOY life. Whether you were understaffed for the evening or the turnout was better than expected, I would imagine that this is something a business would be prepared for.

Quality food ehhhhh not so much. \n\nAlbeit I was here for my birthday, so I don't remember THAT much of it, but from what I do remember, the drinks were fun, the food wasn't great, and the rain storm band was playing MJ classics (he had recently passed). \n\nThey have a fantastic gimmicky photographer who got the best of me. He took a group photo, of course I had to buy it, and then he also made matchbooks for each person with their own face on it! What an awesome souvenir huh??? (That is until your roommate uses all of the matches from your matchbook...) \n\nI'm sure our party was being loud and obnoxious... but so were the servers' shirts!

The Happy Hour is a massive weird buffet/overcrowding of drunk college kids who were singing, screaming, climbing on tables, it was a mess. We had some drinks, some were good some were ok, but couldn't even talk to each other because it was extremely loud. We looked over the buffet and it smelled and looked like microwaved snacks and people were eating with bare hands out of the containers.. nasty. Our server was nowhere to be found half the time and got our order wrong twice, then i had to hunt her down for my card and tab to close out...

Stepping into the Tonga Room from the historical Fairmont Hotel was like stepping into a different world, imagine a cross between the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland and the Rainforest Cafe.\n\nOur group arrived at 6:40 PM, just 20 minutes before the happy hour buffet was about to end so we stocked on some food. For $9.50 you can get very full on just the buffet which contained:\n\n1. Spicy Chicken Wings\n2. Some sort of spicy edamame (delicious!)\n3. Mixed Fruit\n4. Spam, pineapple, and coconut fried rice (also very good)\n5. Vegetable Chow Mein (noodles a little over plump)\n6. Vegetable egg rolls \n7. BBQ chicken wings (tasty, I ate a lot of these)\n8. Macaroni salad \n\nThey have a nice selection of happy hour drinks and I ordered a pina coloda which was yummy. I also sampled the Scorpion for two but it was disgusting. It certainly had a bite to it, but it bit like rubbing alcohol. They brought us these super long straws to drink the shared drinks. \n\nService was pretty good, they came by to give us a last call for the buffet line and our drinks came out fairly quick. They also warned us about the $7 entertainment fee around 8 PM (if we left/paid before 9 we'd be okay because the computer automatically adds this charge) so that was great because I'm a cheapo. The water pond area simulates a rain storm about every hour I think, and in the middle there's this boat where a live singer and band provide live entertainment. After happy hour buffet they brought us some asian trail mix. If you come with a group that plans to drink a lot your tab can add up very quick, our party of 7 got charged a mandatory 15% gratuity fee and our total bill came out to $254 after tax (but we order about 16 drinks total). The only complaint I have is that they took about 20-30 minutes to get our check back to us after we had paid. When we left at 9:10 PM there was a short line of people waiting to get in, and I can see why. Overall it's a great place to unwind after work and step into a different world in San Francisco. I highly recommend it as a happy hour destination.", "author": "Monica W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-06-02", "description": "For a place that may be closing soon, the Tonga Room doesn't let on.  I remember the last days of Don The Beachcomber, Malibu--sitting in thatch roofed booths, in front of picture windows looking out over the surf, and watching the staff lounge about, talking without concern for  the customers nearby, and playing their own top 40 music on the sound system--you could feel the doom.  \n\nNot so at the Tonga.  Yet.\n\nI've done happy hour here, and I would suggest you do too.  You do want to see this place before it closes, and dinner is an extravagance you don't need to experience.  We had the fried Calamari (because Michael Bauer hates the stuff) and the teriyaki veggies for app's, and then did the Wok beef tenderloin, and shrimp with peppers.   I ordered a side of steamed rice.\n\nI'm not a big rice fan, let alone white rice.  Then again, I've ordered at the local Thai places and taken the rice as delivered,   and have eaten every last morsel, marveling at the nutty flavor--how could it be so good?  At the Tonga Room, it isn't.  Bad rice?  \n\nYes.  Tinny rice actually--flat, starchy, no real flavor.\n\nThe beef was tender, moist, and in a thick, mildly salty cornstarch sauce that was vaguely asian.  The shimp was served with big chunks of red and green peppers and yellow onions, and while not exciting, it was at least interesting. All of it was all low-brow Chinatown, at $27.00 a plate.\n\nI must say that I was thrilled to find they do have chimney glasses--the tall cylinder glasses, and my Bombay+soda actually had gin in it, and it came with the lemon twist I ordered (75% of the time  I order it, it either comes with a lime, or a lemon wedge).  Spot on.  And they had Anchor Steam.\n\nRoughly every thirty minutes the thunder would begin, along with the rain, a Tonga Room highlight.   For this reason, I would suggest you do not take lagoon-side seats as we did--sit inland, in the middle set of tables or against the wall--you will have the thrill of a fake storm without seeing the strobes and pipes.\n\nI was wondering about the band.  Given the uncertain future of the space,  I thought perhaps there would be no band, and in any case, it was a wednesday.  And then the stage was drawn across the lagoon, and the band, a trio, boarded.   At this point, I should point out that my last memory of the band--thirty six years ago--on the first time I visited the Tonga Room, was that it was incongruous--way out of place, playing  1970's soft rock.  \n\nWell, it still is.  \n\nThey hacked their way through Sade and other late-century pop music, on an over-amplified yet muffled sound system.  It was like being in the Holiday Inn at Topeka International, or in Evanston, Ill.  Don't these clowns get the ambience?  The darkness, the tropical vibe?\n\nOf course not.\n\nHad I been able to keep to my thoughts, looking at the wood carvings, the thatch, the bamboo and the outriggers, it might have ended wistfully.  I might have lingered over a port and dessert.  But with that idiotic trio I couldn't wait to get my check and get the hell out of there.\n\nYou should be able to walk out into the fading dusk as we saw it, with the Dashiel Hammett fog shrouding the hill--it nearly made up for the band.\n\nYes, you need to go to the Tonga Room, just because it's the City's last big \"polynesian\" restaurant--one of the last of the original tropical joints left on the Coast.  But do the happy hour buffet--dinner is no better and lots more expensive--and leave before the band starts to play--this isn't the Titanic, but the band will definitely sink your night.", "author": "Paul T."}

This review is for dinner in the main restaurant on a Saturday night.\n\n3.5 stars, but if you ask my tiki-loving, Polynesian kitsch adoring, mai tai swilling alter ego, it's a solid 4 stars.  This place is everything it's cracked up to be - a blast from the past where tourist trap meets ironic throwback.  We came after the infamous Bourdain visit and were wise to make a reservation about a week in advance.  After trucking up the hills from the Omni to the Fairmont (\"Boot and rally, honey! Boot and rally!\") in the chilly mist, we were greeted to a solid line and the strains of music from a tropical paradise awaiting us inside.  Once the host showed up at the desk, we were promptly whisked inside and skipped the line, past folks trying to change their 10pm dinner reservations for an earlier time, and see and be  seen types trying to bribe the front desk for a table.  Really?  Are we in Vegas all of a sudden?\n\nWe passed by the band swaying in their little boat atop the former Fairmont pool, crooning old soul classics and parrothead jams - a weird combo, but oddly, it worked.  We liked them so much, we didn't even care about the $7/pp extra charge for the music.  Our waiter came to take our drink order and was brusque at first, which we chalked up to the place being busy.  Turns out that after we ordered our entrees, his mood totally changed - I think that his knowing that we weren't just ordering one appetizer and a few drinks and then bailing made him nicer.  That or the fact that the table of 16 that he was waiting on just left.  Still, it was a whole lot better once he perked up a bit and even eeked out a smile.\n\nThe food is wicked expensive for what it is even though it's tasty enough, but I can't say that I ate anything worth the price tag or even worth returning for.  I imagine that many people come here focused on the drinking, so the food oftentimes serves to soak up the tsunami of rum swilling around in their bellies.  We had the appetizer sampler of crispy coconut shrimp (eh), chicken satay in peanut sauce (eh), veggie rolls (eh) and pork ribs that went from eh to ooooo from a little dollop of the accompanying chili garlic sauce.  I was hoping that dinner would be a stunner, but it was pretty average - mongolian beef was tender cubes of filet that were way oversauced, and the Tonga Rice with bay shrimp and sausage was toothsome, but not anything you couldn't make yourself with ingredients from Trader Joe's.  The lava bowl for two that we split was not bad, but easily could have been a drink for one.  And the mai tai was alright, but not the best I've ever had or anywhere near the hype that it gets.  I think our last bites of coconut cream pie were the best bites we had all night, a sweet conclusion to a festive evening.  I was happy to sip away and sing along to the songs from the band, but I don't necessarily think I would return unless it was for a special occasion.  It seems like the perfect place for a birthday or a party with friends, but not somewhere I'd want to regularly lay my hat.  And isn't that the point of a tiki bar?  Shouldn't it be the place where you go to get away whenever you need it?", "author": "Angela G."}

Then you get to the elevator and head down to the level that the Tonga Room's on. Stepping out of the elevator, you're in your average upscale hotel lobby... And then BAM! You get to the Tonga Room and scratch your head in confusion, wondering when you entered Disneyland and why you don't remember having taken a plane ride down to Southern Cali to get here. ;) Omggggg! Huge wooden tiki statues, a giant pool in the middle of the room with a boat on it where the band plays, strings of lights all over, rainstorms that occur sporadically as you sit... And the entrance to the place looks like you're gonna be stepping on board a pirate ship and you seriously wonder when Jack Sparrow is gonna pop his head out and say hi. Lol!\n\nSo, 5/5 for ambiance and uniqueness. The rest in a nutshell:\n\nPROS:\n- The food was great (though a bit overpriced, but what did you expect? It's San Francisco and you're inside a fancy hotel!).  The rice with the spam and pineapple in it, the tuna, and the shrimp spring rolls were all super delish!\n- Drinks were great and super cute... our mai tais came in little plastic coconuts. Aww. :D\n\nCONS:\n- The music the band played? Ummm.... Their website says \"current\" music, but unless current  means late 80s/early 90s soft rock then... Yeah. Their website is a bit misleading. It got preeeeeetty cheesy when the band started playing Billy Joel and Sugar Ray all night, and it sucked leaving the place with corny song lyrics in your head. Lol\n- Our waiter was heeeeeeeeeeeerra slow. Oh geez! On three separate occasions, my friend and I wondered if we should just leave because he STILL hadn't brought us the check! :P\n\nBUT! Despite all this, I would definitely recommend that you check this place out, whether you've lived in SF your whole life or are from out of town and are looking for something fun to do in the City. Though the experience does have a few downers, overall you're sure to have a really fun time and a really unforgettable experience.  You totally won't regret going.

I wish that the higher higher managers would take time to review this place. Servers have no attention to detail. You're more like an inconvenience than a customer. Servers and hosts need to get serious training about customer service. This place is an embarassment. I heard this place was gonna shut down til anthony bourdain made a mistake of coming in and of course he gets super VIP treatment, which is not always the case w customers coming in, so he thought this was the best place on earth and raved about it. Now they are doing good and back in bussiness.. But with the same service, this place is only good for a little while until people are sick of it again. I say change the staff or get them proper training. Fire people who can't keep up with the job or can't perform what the job entails which are simple things.

From double dates, happy hour with friends, post wedding after parties, and dinners with my family, I've been here several times and the Tonga Room never disappoints. \n\nThe food is great! The Pacific Rim Asian cuisine has a variety of family style or a la carte items on the menu. Some faves are the appetizer sampler, Huli Huli chicken, Forbidden rice, & the Tonga Volcano for dessert!\n\nThe atmosphere resembles the Tiki Room but is more of an \"adult Disneyland\" between the island decor and the wide variety of fun fruity drinks on the menu. Some signature faves include Mai Tais and Hurricanes. A great group drink to order is the infamous scorpion bowl! While dining, guests will also experience \"a rainstorm\" every 20 minutes or so and have the opportunity to overlook the lagoon (which actually used to be the old Fairmont pool). By far, the best part is when the band performs songs, on a boat in the middle of the restaurant, ranging from Bobby Darin, Frank Sinatra, The Eagles to other more modern day hits!  {And I promise you will blush when the lead singer (complete with his striped fedora and all) passes out \"special alohas\" to the crowd}!\n\nOn a side note, if you visit during the holiday season, it's fun to also check out the decorations upstairs in the Fairmont lobby, including the life size ginger bread house, tree, and nutcrackers!", "author": "Carla V."}

Not a regular establishment for a native.  \n\nYes - I know.  The rain shower is cool.  But come on people!  The rain shower is cool like 5 times.

I definitely woun't give it the same praise.\n\nI made reservations through open table and then had to extend it over the phone because I had 11 people, which is more than the maximum number on open table. It was definitely  nice that we had reservations because the line out the door was insane. We were seated within moments and our drink orders were taken. Drinks are a little pricey, but anything that with dragonfruit in it's name usually is. Plus, the drinks are usually never my biggest complaint at a place..\n\nNow for the food. I tried to order the dumplings for the table as an appetizer, but the waiter said it wouldn't be enough food and offered the meet platter filled with ribs, coconut prawns, chicken satay, and other goodies. The group decided it would be too much food, plus a full meal, so we passed. When we began to order our entrees, we kept asking, 'is this too much for one person?', 'will it be enough to share?'. The waiter was very clear that one dish would not be enough for two people. I ordered the hot pot and a side of rice. This was by far the largest pot of food I have ever seen (and for $27 + rice, I'd sure hope so). I had two servings and it looked like I didn't even touch it. The same with everyone else. Each plate could have easily fed 3 hungry people. I find it very disappointing when a waiter doesn't take my best interest into consideration. Why couldn't he have shared that the portions were so large? I know it seems silly to complain that portions are too big, but our bill was $70/person and most people only had 2 drinks. \n\nSo yes, $70 was way more than I wanted to spend for two drinks and a slightly above average meal.", "author": "Erin A."}

We had been talking about going to the Tonga Room forever and we finally did it.  \n\nThe decor is so over-the-top, the dance floor is a giant ship-type thing with the very nice wood floor designed to seem like the deck of a ship.  There are real masts from ships on either side with some rigging and cool nautical antiques- all from ships that sailed in the SF bay of course.  There are giant Tiki statues and tables underneath thatched roofs.  The band plays some island-loungy versions of everything from Frank Sinatra to Van Morrison to the Girl from Ipanema.  It is perfect to get out there and have a dance- especially with a date.  We agreed that it was a fantastic date spot, as well as a great place to bring kids.  Seems like that wouldn't work, but it does.  It looked like a great time for kids- they can have a crazy fancy virgin drink and dance around on the ship.  It was really cute to see parents dancing with their kids during the band's first set.  Later on it was more of a couples dancing type thing, although a couple of us girls got out there for the island band version of a BeeGees song.\n\nThe drinks taste wonderful and the presentation is everything you could ever ask for.  The winners in our group were the drink that comes in a fresh pineapple, the pina colada, the Bora Bora Horror (in tiki monkey cup), and the lava bowl.  They were a bit expensive, but the experience made it all worth it.  Come here if you want to have fun and put tiki umbrellas in your hair and enjoy a fake indoor thunderstorm!", "author": "Erika W."}

I still do, in a nostalgic way, but it's not the same. I used to come here for their $3 happy hour buffet & cheap tropical drinks. I still think that the HH buffet is a bargain at $9.50 (esp. on Nob Hill) but we skipped it this time. No time for eating! I just had a beer but my friends ordered the Scorpion Bowl for 2. Now I am sure that these used to be bigger, they are still served in a bowl but it's pretty tiny. They give you 2 ridiculously long straws that make it seem like you are sharing a drink for 2 when it's really the same size as any other drink on the menu. \n\nThe staff is overly unfriendly & we had to practically beg for a bowl of mixed nuts. Then they gave us our bill without asking if we wanted anything else.  \n\nI was so sad when I heard they might close the Tonga Room.  Now I don't really care much either way.", "author": "Erin S."}

(The HH buffet was $5 back then.)\n\nI sampled a mai tai, a pina colada and a strawberry daiquiri from the drink menu. The mai tai was great but the pina colada was exceptional.  All three were strong.  The service was indifferent, but that is to be expected at a place that caters primarily to tourists.\n\nThe thunder and rain seems to happen only once an hour now, but it's all fun.

I mean where can you go wrong with a hotel pool room that was coverted to a bar/restaraunt just after WWII? Thats 1945 for you non-history minded folks. The pool is still there and has a floating houseboat which features a cover band playing the smooth hits of the 70's and 80's. YES!\n\nThe drinks, well thats the reason you go here, they have all the classic Tiki Drinks from Pineapple Royale's (served in a fresh Pineapple), Bora Bora Horror (for banana lovers) my personal fave the Singapore Sling, Scorpions (gigantic) Lava Bowls (gigantic), Zombies, and a whole bunch of other super sweet-tiny umbrellas-cornucopia of fruit-massive amounts of rum in crazy glasses concoctions for you to enjoy!\n\nThe food is asian or pan-asian depending on what you order and while not the greatest believe me your not going there for the food only. Its an experience.  Thurs and Fri from 5-7 they have the happy hour extravaganza so for 9.50 plus a drink you get all you can eat appetizers, which are surprisingly pretty dam tasty.\n\nFellas if your looking for a first date experience or just looking for a change of scenery this is the place! \n\nSo whisk your girl away to the tropics for the night! remember it does rain every hour or so but no need for an umbrella, there's bound to be a few in your drink.", "author": "Cooper M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-05-29", "description": "I've come to enjoy the atmosphere of this place 3 times now, and I think it will be years before I think to go again, if ever.  Reason being:  the food doesn't compete.  It's just chinese food.  It doesn't stand out.  It doesn't thrill.  And, I'm sorry, for an average $25 a plate it better make me sing.  \n\nOf course the environment is unique, fun, and entertaining.  The band is pitch perfect and on time note for note.  Them playing on a mobile craft is a pretty impressive touch.  The set list choice will definitely get you on the dance floor, but if you're just sitting at your table and trying to hear what your company is saying to you then forget it.  The band is way too loud and it becomes a shouting competition that gets old and annoying super quick.  The band seems to play for about 30 mins., 15 min. break, then the cycle repeats.  In my opinion (which is greatly influenced by the decibel overload) it's too much.  \n\nMaking a reservation seemed to not matter AT ALL.  There's a line if you have a res and a line for walk-in.  My girlfriend and I noticed the people in front of us (before we realized there was a separate line for reservations) were sat at the same time as us, and we showed up right at our 8:30 reservation.  So, no point it seems.\n\nThe drinks here are pretty tasty.  Dark rum is a good way to go and fits perfectly with the theme and decor.  Your wait staff are very nice, buuuuuut don't seem to know a lick of english and we found ourselves repeating our orders more than a couple of times as confirmation was a challenge.  \n\nBut, the food.  Like I said I've been here 3 times over the years and it has never made me happy I chose it.  Once we ordered different meat dishes that came with vegetables, but when it arrived it was all vegetables that some meat accidentally fell into...or so it looked like.  I remember we made a remark to the manager and they were very cool in giving us a significant credit.  We returned on that gift and had another meal there.  The chef staff was noted to not flake on the protein.  This third time our mongolian beef and Afi chicken came out in only 5 mins. of ordering.  In that quick preparation they musta forgotten the special ingredients that justified the $26-$27 charge per plate because nothing really said anything to us about these plates.  For a restaurant to go so above and beyond to create a specific motif you would think they would emphasize the flavor of the food in correlating fashion.  They don't.  In none of my 3 ventures have I walked away thinking, \"this restaurant serves a distinct spectrum of food and flavor.\"  \n\nMy advice?  Go for the drinks, music, and dancing.  That's definitely worth your money.  The food is not special and only somewhat good at best, but for the price it's completely unworthy.", "author": "Nick J."}

I've heard my friends and Yelpers rave about this place so me and my family decided to go here for my uncle's birthday.\n\nUh, no. Bad idea. We went for happy hour, thinking the buffet would have more selections or at least be delicious since it is the Fairmont and their valet service was 50 bucks. The $9.50 all you can eat buffet with one minimum drink should be worth it, right? Wrong. Horribly wrong. The Tonga room sounds Tongan or at least tropical but they served Chinese food. Greasy spring rolls, rubbery chicken wontons, pork chow mein that didn't have traces of ANY kind of meat, and some rice with some fancy name like macadamia pineapple rice or something like that. The best combination I could figure out was the shrimp chips dipped in the pina colada sauce. One star for that.\n\nThe drinks were awfully disgusting. I got the pina colada and believe me, I've been ordering pina coladas for a long time now and this place serves the worst! The 60-year-old bartender mixed it in 5 minutes so I guess he used some premade cocktail mix and added the alcohol in it. Ugh. Nasty. I'd rather drink water.\n\nI think this bar/restaurant caters more to the older crowd rather than the youngins like me, which is probably one of the reasons why I didn't enjoy my experience here. I'm 21 and I felt really young when I walked through the place. Everyone else was at least 20 years older than me, not that that's a bad thing though.

We decided not to wait. \nI went home and made a reservation for the next Happy Hour on OpenTable, even though the Tonga Room website said Happy Hour was \"first come, first serve\"...contradictory much?\nUpon arriving for my reservation, I had a little trouble getting the table even though I had a reservation and the bar area was only half full. It took forever to get a server to greet us and get our drink order. Good thing it was a buffet. The food was pretty good (besides a hair in the noodles) and the drinks were great! Don't count on getting too drunk though, the server doesn't bother coming around to your table but once every 1/2 hour.

In a nutshell, don't come here for the food or you will be disappointed. It's pretty expensive, and you're paying for an experience.\n\nThat said, hanging out at the Tonga Room was like crashing a retirement party. The music is so awful. I was expecting The Girl From Ipanema and Copacabana but instead I got Billy Joel and My Girl, what? The music was less tiki party and more bar mitzvah. My expectations weren't really high, it's just sad because someplace so campy really has a lot of potential, a band with a great repertoire of covers could totally turn things around. Seriously, even an Elvis impersonator would be a huge improvement. \n\nI ordered the most ostentatious drink they had, it came in a pineapple but I was disappointed to find not much of the actual pineapple had been carved out so my drink was probably half the size of my friends' drinks and $2 more. I paid $24 for some really bland (and definitely not spicy as the menu suggested) chicken, and had to pay extra for rice. I could have had better in Chinatown for $9. \n\nWe were here on a Friday night and it was maybe 1/3 of the way full with tourists and sad looking blind dates and plentiful camera phone flashes.

The atmosphere, tiki history, being transported to a Polynesian paradise is why we keep coming back. It's like going to Disney land in San Francisco. We're sad that we won't be coming back. The reason for this is the horrible service and the ridiculous price and quality of there food. It was Saturday and I just got off work. I wanted to take my girlfriend to the Tonga to have a tropical beverage and just relax. We ordered a volcano bowl which was pretty tasty and enjoyed the ambience. I could sense a little rudeness from our waitress when I was inquiring about the alcohol potency of each bowl. She had a short demeanor. I felt like I was annoying her with my questions. I let it go, but it was warning for what was to come. My girlfriend decided that she wanted a appetizer. She ordered the shrimp egg rolls, they were pricey ($13). When they arrived at the table it was literally two egg rolls cut in half with some dipping sauces. She tasted one and told me that it tasted average and did not warrant the $13 dollar price tag. We got the waitresses attention and told her that we're not satisfied with the egg rolls and that we wanted to try something else. She became very rude and apprehensive to exchange it for something else. She said we should have not taken a bite of the food. If the egg rolls were great we would have no problem paying that much. We needed to try them first. My girl decided to talk to the manager about the situation. He told us that there in the process of hiring new waiters and waitresses.

We had 14 people total in our group and it was to celebrate a birthday. The entertainment was great and there was even an area for dancing which was fun!! We would come back here for the entertainment and ambiance for sure. The food was good, but a bit pricey (we understand since it is in a touristy area). I felt like I was back in Hawaii when we were there. Now, the reason why I didn't give 5 stars. The service was extremely slow and I swear we were flagging down our server multiple times or trying to get other servers to find him. On top of that, we felt like we were being rushed for being there. The bus boy came back numerous times taking plates from our table even though we weren't finished with our food yet. He didn't even ask if we were done!! At one point, he even took a plate someone was still eating from and moved the rest of her rice to the person eating next to her!! Wth?? Do you want people returning or not? We explained to the manager what was going on and he took care of it, which was appreciated. I suggest not going here for groups unless you don't mind being eyeballed constantly by the bus boy taking all your plates away...", "author": "Mertani G."}

A lot of times, television has a way of making places look better than what they really are, but in this case I was not disappointed. \n\nFirst thing, depending on what you day/night you go, there will be a cover which will be included on your bill. I was a little irritated at first, but it turned out to be worth it. Their drink selection was very good and very extensive. As far as taste is concerned, their drinks had the right amount of alcohol, if not more (which is never a bad thing). \n\nThe reason a cover is charged is because of the live entertainment, which I must say was very good. A lot of dancing from different age groups, which I thought was cool. On top of that, you have the occasional rainstorm being getting lei'd. Very cool place.

It also helps that I had the best pina colada I've ever tried here - not particularly strong, but incredibly delicious. I suggest getting it with banana (though I'm sure the pineapple and mango are excellent too). \n\nThe only thing that jars one out of the 1950s ambiance of the place is the music selections played by the band - catchy, but more Bobby Darin and less Sugar Ray please. :|\n\nI love me some Trad'r Sam's, but it's nice to experience the classier version every once in awhile.", "author": "Sus...

And it's quite pricey, especially considering the poor quality of the food and drinks.\n\nFirst the cocktails. I had a Mai Tai and it was easily the worst I've ever had (and I'm an aficionado, definitely). It was over-sweet, hardly any taste of rum and the juices tasted like they were from a can. There were 8 of us and the drinks were uniformly bad. San Francisco has so many great places for quality cocktails, and these tasted like something you'd get somewhere in the sticks. Terrible.\n\nThe food was also over-priced and not at all good. We were intending to eat dinner there, but after some appetizers and a drink, we were out of there!\n\nAnd even though the place really wasn't that crowded at all, it was difficult to get the attention of servers.\n\nIf you're looking for a Tiki Experience at a higher level of quality in terms of drinks and service, the Kona Club in North Oakland, Thalassa in Berkeley (both owned by the same guy) have the full tiki effect *and* good drinks. And Trader Vic's in Emeryville has better food and drinks, although not nearly the great ambience of Tonga Room or Kona Club.", "author": "Tim W."}

Things like that probably don't happen in Minnesota much, do they? In my defense, I must say that I was just terribly moved by the atmosphere of the Tonga Room. Middle-aged men in business suits hitting on me, a waitress that seemed like she didn't give a fuck whether we all lived or died so long as she got her money at the end of the night, a roarin' cover band that played on a BOAT in WATER.

I was Tonga Room bound.\n\nI made a reservation on their website and recieved 3 confirmations and also forwarded them to my friend who would be joining me. I had peaked at their menu and knew that their prices were outrageous but figured it was a one in a lifetime expierence.\n\nI get there and found the door and host staff to be VERY RUDE! VERY VERY RUDE! If I am going to spend alot of my hard earned money, then you need to talk to me with respect. Their was a couple in front of us, whom apparently later where going to have a group of 10 more people later joining them. The host said they couldn't find their reservation and was not accomedating at all to the couple. Next we walked up, I knew I had a reservation, and they said that I did not.... Next the RUDE asian host insisted I had no reservation, and apparently I could not be seated in the area I wanted without one. I stated that I made one online... and he had the nerve to tell me that he didn't know what I did but I did not make a reservation, then he said that online has nothing to do with them????? WHAT?????? I made it on your website.... I got a billion confirming e-mails. \n\nAnnoyed that my beautiful expierence was shattered and I was made to feel like a low class citizen, I took a seat in the bar area.... with no view to anything. I ordered the pu pu platter and it was very good... but it was also 25 bucks.... I also ordered a lava bowl for 2, which was small but strong... typically a lava... or volcano bowl is in a big bowl with a flame in the middle.... most tiki bars serve that for 2.... there lava bowl honestly was tiny.... perhaps their $30 lava bowl for 4 was what most places serve for 2? \n\nThe atmosphere is nice, the people are really rude, even the waitress, and bartender.... they yell at you... all of them.... asian.... yelling like... \"No, No... you get this... No, No... you do this.... no, no... you pay this\".\n\nYou can't help but wonder what you are paying so much money for... the location is nice, but with high prices, rude staff and smnall drinks... it's not an enjoyable expierence.

With her previous experiences from the themed restaurant, I trusted her to navigate through the historic Fairmont Hotel. If I wasn't with her, I wouldn't have known which of the many elevators to catch to get down to this gem.\n\nSecluded on the bottom floor with the lights very dim, I got shivers from seeing the indoor thunderstorm over the pool. I was amazed to hear the cover band playing as I looked at all the very decorative interior. As we got to our table next to the Hurricane Bar, a very cool Tiki feel to it. \n\nThe two of us ordered a Lava Bowl for four. I know, right? Well, we were thirsty. Wasn't planning to eat, but we ended ordering their Appetizer platter, which was perfect for two people, but not really a  \"platter\" size I expected. The platter was decent with its coconut shrimp, chicken kabob, egg roll, pork ribs, and something fried. The $25 price was outrageous for my usual expectation of a platter, which to me, should feed 3-4 people or so. \n\nThe Lava Bowl came out to our table and it felt like it took more space than our appetizer platter. Pineapples, cherries, umbrellas, and straws were burst out of the ceramic coconut bowl. The $27 Lava Bowl for four definitely hit our indulgence that night, which made me forget about the price of the appetizer. \n\nNote: When the cover band is playing, a cover charge is automatically added to your bill.\n\nThe live music from the cover band influenced the 4th star on my rating. I loved the karaoke songs the cover band played, secretly we were both singing along at our table.

I had a very good time stumbling drunkenly on the dance floor with the bf...\n\nThe food can be a hit or miss. I had the Ahi Poke as an appetizer the first time, which was amazing with the avocado. The Firecracker with tofu wasn't anything to write home about, although the Tongan rice was great as a side. I really liked the smoky flavor of the Tongan rice. The second time at the Tonga room, I ordered the Smoked Salmon, which was very tasty, I especially liked the sauce and wasabi mash. \n\nThe drinks were good, but nothing to rave about. Although I must say, the drinks were very strong. I think I was good after one, and I'm no punk when it comes to drinks...\n\nMy experience went well, although there were a couple of issues with two of my girlfriends' entrees. Upon being close to finishing her Butterfish (which was very good according to her), she found a large piece of cardboard in her food mixed amongst her mushrooms. We went ahead and let a manager know, in which he was apologetic for, and brought out a new plate of food for her. We later find out in the bill that her entree was also comped. \nMy second friend ordered the Thai Basil Curry, which she wasn't very happy about because it was incredibly bland and watery. Since she was absolutely starving, she went ahead and finished the food, but let the manager know that her food wasn't very good. He also offered to comp her meal but she declined since she had finished the food already. \nI will say that the quality of the food is a hit or miss, but they do their best to make up for their shortcomings by doing whatever it takes to ensure that you are a satisfied customer. The waiters and hosts were very polite and friendly.\n\nIf you walk upstairs to the hotel lobby, the place is gorgeous! :) Super pretty ceilings and chandeliers, and there was also a guy playing on the grand piano. There was a weird lady wearing a kimono-type dress dancing around the guy on the grand piano though.

It seemed perfect for my guests from NY who only care about seeing kitschy old school restaurants.  Unlike Empress of China, the Tonga Room's decor actually lived up to expectations.  The tiki village with the water and the boats all looked amazing.  Too bad that we could barely see them from the area back by the bar where they corralled all us cheap ass happy hour patrons.  We could only glimpse intermittent slices of the decor as they appeared between the broad-backed businessmen and corn-fed tourists packed like sardines by the bar while the rest of the restaurant was all but empty.\n\nI cannot speak badly enough of the buffet.  The offerings were beyond meager and each one vied with the others to be the most nauseating.  There were only four or five dishes- spring rolls, shrimp chips, fried won tons, noodles, and fried rice.  Each more awful than the last.  And the next.  Somehow, in the bizarro world that was the Tonga Room happy hour, that sort of thing was possible.  To top it off, the schisters who run the place weren't content to serve insanely crappy food, they also didn't stock the buffet with any normally sized plates.  Just try and fit $9 worth of spring rolls on a saucer, I dare you!\n\nThe only thing that's keeping me from filling this review with nothing but ALLCAPS and expletives is the fact that when we told the waitress how awful the buffet was (so very bad that Boyfriend didn't even bother to eat anything) she only charged us for one person.\n\nIf you absolutely must see the Tonga Room, go on an off-hour and just have some drinks at the bar.

The waiters were super friendly even though we barely ordered anything. I wonder why they don't have any standing room. Go after 8 pm on the weekend. There will be a $7 cover but it's worth it to catch the live entertainment playing in the boat. Afterall, this place is all about atmosphere not food!", "author": "Kristin S."}

My parents used to go there when they were dating and loved the tropical drinks, rain and thunderstorms, and most of all the band on the barge! They even ordered the pictures of themselves on the matchbooks.\n\nI won't discuss the food in this review since it has been too many years since I've eaten there (although I do remember liking the coconut shrimp), but I have been there a few times recently for the ambiance and tropical cocktails.  While nothing beats a Trader Vics Mai Tai, the Tonga Room's version is strong and sweet, as is the Scorpion Bowl.  And of course, the classic tropical glasses are always fun.\n\nI have to admit I'm partial to tiki bars because I love the tropical drinks (and maybe spent too much time in the Tiki Room at Disneyland as a kid).  The Tonga Room is still one of my favorites.  I just went back with my dad and he told me that his first trip to the Tonga Room was in 1970 when he was in town for a convention.  And he said it hasn't changed much since.  While it can be kitschy, touristy, and pricey (it is in a hotel after all), I still think it's a part of SF that is not to be missed.", "author": "Laura B."}

You would think that such amazing, hip people would have some clue about where to throw a party.\n\nThey have a band on a boat.  This band plays covers of all the songs that ever crossed the line from pop to motion picture soundtrack.  It's not that they play the songs poorly, it's just that they play the most generic crap because everybody will know it.\n\nThe drinks are way too sweet and overpriced.  I had a Blue Hawaiian, partly because of where I was, and partly because I wanted to give a lesson on complimentary colors that involved my dark orange tie.  That was the best part of the drink.  The Makers on the rocks was a good sized pour, and it should be for what they charge, but I really think it was only so great in volume because the old man knew I was watching him.\n\nAgain, I need to express, in order to spare the feelings of the wonderful people I was with, that they know how to have a good time, and they are spectacular party people, but the venue did not enhance my experience.\n\nThe decor is pure cheese, and not in that ironic/Butter sort of way.

I loved that I could share a double cocktail with my friend, and the drink was pretty good. Not exceptional, but I liked it. The band was ok, the singer wasn't great but I liked their selection of classic fun songs.\nNow, the things that really set me up: our waitress, Tina. First of all, she did not serve us for more than 20 min (half of our party of 6 was here). One of my friends was so hungry, she got really upset. Then she would come to our table, mumble something about how she will be back in 1 min and at least she gave us the menues. It took 40 min (!) until we could order drinks and food! She never smiled once, she was outright unfriendly. It was only later I realized why: they include a 15% gratuity with parties more than 6 people, so she knew she gets her tip anyway. After ordering food, my friend and I got up to take a walk around the pool and look at the deco and everything (we were seated in a corner). After a couple of steps we ran into our waitress and now she became plain rude - she asked me if she could help me. I said, no thanks, doin' alright. She then said (I still can't believe she really did that!): \"We don't like our customers walking around when other people are eating\" in a very rude tone. I looked at her, unbelievingly, shrugged my shoulders and was like, \"I understand\" and just ignored her and kept on walking. Then she added \"Did you not understand me?\" I looked at her, furious now, and said, \"Oh I did\" (but still kept on walking around). I mean really, how can you treat first time customers like that?? We didn't stand in anyone's way, we just walked around the pool one time. And it was not that crowded either. If it wasn't that we were waiting for two other friends to arrive, we would have just stood up and left the bar.\nThe food was ok, but did not live up to our expectations or the price they charge you. Also, small sized main dish, mini sized appetizers! I recommend the Pupu platter. \nThe crowd at the Tonga room was mixed, young and old, dressed up or dressed casual, lot of people had fun on the dancefloor.\n\nAlso, beware: they take one credit card right in the beginning as a security when you are not a hotel guest - I found that pretty strange - as if you were not trustworthy. Never had that at a bar before. In addition, we paid 5$ per person cover fee on a Thursday. Over all, it was quite pricey which would have been ok had not Tina ruined it for all of us, she destroyed the fun with her rude attitude.\n\nSumming up, my friend was like, we should have gone to Smuggler's Cove.

So I'm not sure if the management has changed or what is going on but I had one of my WORST experiences here the other night.  It began at the door.  Our party was already inside and there was a line to be seated.  I asked the man at the door if we needed to wait in line even though our party was already at the table, he said yes very rudely.  Then, after waiting for a few minutes the SAME man said \"oh if your party's already here you can just go in\"..... hmmmm... maybe shoulda been a sign that they are unorganized and rude.... but nonetheless we continued to our table.  This is where the fun really began.  We were with a party of eleven.  Eleven.  They had seated us at a small round table and there literally were not seats for everyone.  I know this place is not fine dining.  But how can you take people to a table without enough chairs or even space for people if there were chairs and just leave?!?!?  We were literally left standing in the middle of the dining room untill someone sitting at the table next to us offered us a chair and we moved it over ourselves.  While this was going on there was another huge party next to us, also not given adequate room and to make matters worse their group was spilling into our area.  SO NOT FUN.  I tried to get the waitress a few times but she ignored.  Finally I called her over and she rudely said \"one minute ok\"  I said, could I atleast order a drink?  She rolled her eyes at me and grabbed a napkin from the table and wrote down my order!!!!!  REALLY????  After fifteen minutes of no drink or even a menu given to us (still no chairs either)  I decided to go to the bar myself.  After ordering a drink, standing in the bar area and drinking it.  Man #1 from the bar came up to me and told me that I had to return to my table, They couldnt have people standing in the bar area.  First off, I have NEVER had someone say you cannot stand in the bar, especially at a restaurant where there are grass huts everywhere.  I told him I would love to return to my table, unfortunately we had no chairs at our table, and no room for our party and our waitress would not take our orders.  At this point he looked over and said he would take care of it after seeing the disaster happening in our area. I returned to the table only to find out that while I was gone our waitress had yelled at the bday girl when she asked if we could have a bigger table, maybe some chairs and menus.  She yelled at her to \"just wait!!!\".  Mind you, we were not being impatient, we had now been standing in the dinning room for 15 minutes.\n\nFinally, the man at the door got us another table.  We were happy to move out of that dreadfull womans section.  She cashed us out and brought over our check where she had already written in her tip.  A large one also.  I refused to pay it, and everyone at the table agreed.  This was not an automatic gratuity, she had actually written herself her tip in the tip section on the credit slip.  I dont even think that is legal.\n\nSo we moved to anther table, things are getting better right?  We have a normal waiter, still not particularly nice or efficient, but adequate, (he didnt yell and brought us menus so it was a huge step up).  My boyfriend and I decided we should just try to have fun.  We ordered drinks served in pineapples.  When we got the drinks they were cute and good and we were starting to have a good time.  That was untill we noticed something green on out pinapples.  Yes.  THE PINEAPPLES WERE MOLDED!!!  We told our waiter who said sorry, got us a new one, but didn't even offer to comp it or anything.  That was it for us, we left and went somewhere else.  All in all a HORRIBLE experience.  We will never go back there again.  It really is a shame also becuase the decor is cool, it's a fun idea but there are way to many cute/fun places in SF to go to one where you're treated horribly.

Normally, neither of us would have visited this place, but some of her out-of-towner friends were staying at the hotel & this was an easy spot for everyone to merge.\n\nWe nibbled on cocktail snacks, and sipped our Scorpion Bowl for two (or more like I sucked it down). The Polynesian cover band was actually pretty awesome, they played a mix of different songs for the mostly middle-aged to blue hair crowd--worth the $5 per person they charge for entertainment.\n\nHer friends arrived, and we gathered around the bar people and watched for awhile.

HOT STUFF!

Would there be enough space for our group (they don't take reservations unless you have an enormous group), would the drinks be good and strong, would they appreciate a giggly group of bachelorette party-goers and would the band play things we wanted to hear and dance to? The answer to all those questions is yes, thank the lawd.\n\nThat said, there are a couple important strategies to ensure a good time:\n1) Don't have dinner here. We just had some appetizers, and it was all very mall-food-court, except it's really, really expensive.\n2) Drinks are also expensive, but they're very strong. This makes it perfect for, say, a bachelorette party, but not if you're just going out on a regular Friday night.\n\nThe good stuff:\nAgain, the drinks were tasty and strong. The old-school island kitsch of the place was perfect for my bride buddy, who is actually having an island-themed wedding. We got free volcano cakes because it was a big celebration. Free (fabric) leis for everyone. A dance floor that collectively struts its stuff to the band's renditions of \"Sweet Caroline\" and \"Jesse's Girl,\" among others. It \"rains\" inside (into the center pool where the band is located) periodically.\n\nAnd it's also in the Fairmont Hotel, the prettiest, but most expensive night's sleep you'll ever have.

They were undercooked and extremely under seasoned. Luckily they took the scallops back and didn't charge them to the bill.\n\nIt's mostly old people who were in the restaurant.

Round tables & dark leatherette chairs.  The little lake in the center could have been ripped out years ago to make way for more tables, but did they? No, and that 's what I like about this place. Anyway, if they did lose the lake there'd be no place for the floating barge that the band sits on.   If I had any negatives at all it would be that the music wasn't right. Throw some Les Baxter or Martin Denny in the mix and it would be perfect all around. \n\nBest time to go is absolutely happy hour. Tons of yummy, fried, greasy, delectable goodies including Chinese spare ribs, dumplings, greasy things, egg rolls, more greasy things all for around 7 bucks. Order the drink that's the size of your head. It comes with 2 ridiculously long straws that makes for a good photo op and then just wait -- a little longer --- a few more seconds and crash!

There's a lot to hate here, starting with the $7 cover on some nights because some god-awful cover band is playing, to the fact that the majority of the crowd seems to be older business travelers and bachelorette parties from Walnut Creek.  The tropical drink menu is surprisingly small for a tiki bar, and the drinks tend to taste syrupy.  It's obvious they're using cheap liquor and juice from concentrate.\n\nAnd yet despite all that, I love this place.  Maybe it's because it's real kitsch, not some tarted-up hipster version of kitsch.  Maybe it's because it feels like Disneyland decided to make a bar.  Maybe it's the rainstorm!

Our first visit here was back in the early 80's and all I remember was having to tip the host so he wouldn't seat you next to the kitchen and  expensive, mediocre chinese food (chow mein, sweet and sour pork, etc.).\nWhile it is still freakishly overpriced the food is now quite good. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised. Our first visit was in late June with our son visiting from grad school. We hung out in the bar and had an appetizer sampler plate and cocktails. We especially liked the ribs and the coconut shrimp and of course enjoyed listening to the cover band play songs from the 70's and 80's and watching all the inebriated couples dance. It was a hoot.\nOur most recent visit was last night with  a party of 4 for dinner. We went with the family style dinner (Pangai Island) which proved to be WAY too much food. (Our server did try to warn us beforehand but we chose it anyway). We started with ribs, spring rolls and coconut prawns. Then came green papaya salad (good), then sweet and sour soup that wasn't typical of most in that it didn't have that vinegar overkill. I actually enjoyed it. Unfortunately, by the time the soup came I was pretty much full. Then they rolled out our serving cart of entrees, seafood hot pot, dragon chicken, lamb curry, forbidden rice, szechwan green beans. All the entrees were quite good but we ended up taking much of it home. Then dessert arrived, mango mousse which thankfully was light as air and a great end to the meal.\nWe had several cocktails, mai tai, scorpion, hurricane (you get to keep the glass) and the singapore sling. I think the hurricane was the best of the bunch. Oddly, we didn't care for the mai tai. Also, the singapore sling packed a punch! \nThe same cover band was there as were the drunk people on the dance floor. It is obvious that the Tonga Room is one of those special occasion restaurants. We heard many Happy Birthday songs and large groups and families enjoying themselves. By the time we left around 10:00 the bar was completely packed and the place was buzzing.\nAlso, while we were dining a gentleman came by and offered to take our picture. He was using an old style black and white film camera. He took our photos and about 25 minutes later presented us with a pair of matchbooks with our photo on the cover and two 5 X 7 black and white photos.

The food was excellent, the ambiance was amazing, the band kicked a$$ (usually a cheesier band but fun none the less).

I gave them my card when I got there when we sat down so we could run a tab. Fine, no problem this is totally normal practice. \n\nWhen we ask to close, sorry the tab has already been run, and NO we can not split. I was not OK with that. If you can't split tabs, cool, then do not have your waiters tell people you can when we sit down. Irked on principal alone! Worth going once, but buyer beware.", "author": "Nicole F."}

They told me it would be \"safer locked in the manager's office\" and took my luggage.  When I went to retrieve it at the end of the night, I was informed that there had been a robbery, and my luggage as well as other people's belongings had been stolen.\n        I was shocked at the attitude they took me with that night.  They said it casually, \"Oh, well, sorry, but your luggage has been stolen.  Have a nice night.\"  They didn't offer to call anyone for me, or offer me any sympathy or advice on how to proceed.  When I burst into tears--the items in that bag were both costly and personal--they told me that the Fairmont would reimburse me for everything that was lost.\n        This morning the Fairmont called me and it was a different story.  They would not be compensating me for one dime.  There would be a police investigation, and maybe the police would recover my items and if not, apparently, I was out of luck.\n         I am utterly shocked that a luxury hotel such as yours would treat guests in this way, especially after the amount of money we spent in your establishment this weekend.  Nothing whatsoever was offered to me; even a free night in your hotel might have eased the pain, but your establishment offered me nothing, not even an apology.\n         I spent the day trying to replace everything that was lost with money I do not have.

There's a band that plays classic hits from a boat. There's also thunder and a (very) fake rainfall. I ordered a $12 drink of the menu that appeared to be in a coconut. I asked, \"does this drink come in a coconut?\" The waitress said yes. But it was a fake coconut glass. The drink wasn't bad. I went with my Swedish roommate; it's a local place at a very fancy hotel. We had no reservation so sat at the bar area, which wasn't much different from the restaurant but there was a $7 cover per person. We ate from the full menu, so this fee was a bit silly, especially when 15 minutes after being seated there were a whole bunch of seats in the main dining room that opened up. The food was mediocre Chinese; the orange chicken was similar to a dish you can get order at Best Wok in Manhasset, New York (for a totally random reference point).

My wife, Stella, really wanted to go and since we were staying at the Fairmount, I had an open invitation to drink to my heart's content, always a plus.\n\nWe had come from dinner and a walk and got into the Tonga Room about 8.  It was only moderately full and we easily found a table in the bar.  I ordered a Maker's Manhattan and Stella ordered a mai tai.  At $10 a drink, I didn't want to have to order too many drinks, but at the same time, it was a pretty good price for the not quite kitschy atmosphere and location.  \n\nWe got there just in time for the band to start their set.  The bar played their thunderstorm thing on the lagoon and the band floated out into the middle of the lagoon during the storm.  It was really kinda cool and well done which keeps the Tonga Room from crossing into kitsch.  We were lucky, the 3 piece band was really phenomenal and played songs we knew and loved.\n\nI had one of their tropical drinks after I finished off my Manhattan.  It was pretty good but not good enough to get another.  I got another Manhattan.  We sat and enjoyed the band for quite a while.  I finally finished the Manhattan and Stella said I was going to have to finish her mai tai.  She had only drank about 3/4ths of the drink in the time it took me to drink my 3 drinks.  I finished it off, but I don't think I was better off for having done so.\n\nIn the time it took to pay the tab and make our way to the hotel room, I had lost the ability to actually shut a hotel room door.  Anyone passing by our room would have gotten quite the show if they bothered to look.  Luckily I woke up after about an hour and noticed that the door wasn't quite shut so no real damage done, I'm not that concerned about others seeing my twig and berries.\n\nWe had a great time at the Tonga Room, but be warned, the mai tais are straight rum and will make you drunk.  Maybe you'll get a story like mine or maybe you'll rob a liquor store on your way home, I think anything is possible after one of those mai tais.", "author": "Jeff H."}

Paint on a smile and go gets the drinks.  I waited 25 minutes to get a drink and I watched the drink sit on the bar for 10 minutes.  Had there not been so many other staff in and out of the kitchen I would have gotten the drink myself.\n\nI second the notion that the tropical rain was a downer when witnessing it in the rainiest month on record in SF.

She was standing nearby at the computer terminal and my husband tried to get her attention so the rest of us could place our orders, and what did she do?  She literally shushed him!!  She stuck her hand in his face and turned back around to the computer!!  Never in my life have I seen a server behave like this.  When she DID finally come back to the table, she gave us all a bunch of attitude (I asked a question about the margarita and she acted like I was a complete retard) and then took forever to bring us our drinks.

Upon entering ,  I was delighted to see how we seemingly walked into an episode of Gilligan's Island. Fully equiped with a live band, a lagoon in the middile of the restaurant  accompanied with rain every 20 minutes or so . There was a $7 entertainment fee added to each persons tab , including the gratuity.\n\nWhen I sat down I explained to the waiter that I would be eating seperately from the group along with my GF and he insisted that we had to eat with the group. I then had to ask the person in charge of boooking to explain to the waiterwhat the deal was and to go speak to thte manager. The manager gave us the OK and so we ordered our food. \nI decided to order the mongolian beef and the catch of the day . When the waiter brought out the food I was dissappointed to have received food which didn't even compare to the quality of food that I cold have ordered in china town. Did I mention that the Mongolin beef plate was $30?! And I had to order rice on the side for another $8.WOW!. The fish was just OK. I however was able to look beyond the outrageous prices and the lack of quality food so that I could just enjoy myself. \n\nNext thing you know, the waiter comes out with a bill for $1300. They had forgotten to mention that even thought we were ordering seperately we would still be charged for eating from the set menu. We of course asked to speak to the manager , explaining to her (Ruth is her name) that that was never explained to us. She insisted that the waiter said that he explained that we would still be charged for he food that we would not be eating. NOW SERIOUSLY, who in their right mind would agree to that?!. I proceeded to explain how I ended up ordering something that was on the set menu without even knowing it and asked her to put herself in my shoes. IF I knew that they would charge us to eat the set menu, don't you think I would have just eaten that instead of making the person in charge of our party  have to pay for me, and would I so stupid to order something which we would already be receiving on the set menu . I explained to her that as a manager she should be more concerned with helping us out, rather than giving us such a hard time. When I said the waiter never told us anything about being charged ectra, she insisted he did, as if she was right there. Last time I check THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT! ----End Result: She could not win against us and ended up accepting the fact that we would NOT pay extra for food we didn't even eat. She stated, JUST PAY AND LEAVE. I couldn't believe such an establishment would treat paying customers that way.So we paid our tab and proceeded to the elevator., security guard followed and kept coaxing us as if he wanted us to do something. The elevator door opens and he stand in our way, takes off his coat and pushes one of the guys in our group . Thankfully we are smarter than him and requested to speak to a manager. They called the police and we explained what happened. Ultimately ending with a hopefully fired security guard and an experience we will never forget. If anyone ever asks about the Tonga room.

Way overpriced drinks, and mediocre food (again, overpriced). I would say not worth the wait. It did seem like this place could get fun if you came with a mixed group and had reservations for dinner. The dance floor did get packed with island music and old school funk beats. i may try again if invited for a special event and hope to have a better experience.", "author": "Gerry D."}

I had a total 5 star experience here at a company holiday party about 5 years back or so. It was the perfect place for a group or 60+ loud, fun loving, holiday work friends partying. The service was good, the food was very fun, great drinks, live music the band on the water although super cheesy was great! I was looking forward to coming back with friends after my first experience and avidly recommended them to others. \n\nMy second visit was for happy birthday/happy hour drinks for a group of 10 of us. It was so-so. The service was lacking, but there were 10 of us so I can see how it'd be semi chaotic since it wasn't an 'organized' event. But, I was expecting more, like, shouldn't they be used to big groups? And is 10 really that big? Any how, we still had a few drinks, laughs and a good time despite waiting a lot longer between drinks and orders than we would have liked, but that was probably better for us in the long run, just bad for them.  \n\nMy third visit was my idea. Living around the corner from the Fairmont now, I had some girlfriends visiting from out of town and thought the Tonga room would hit the spot. We went for a few appetizers and their tropical drinks before a night out on the town. The service was AWFUL. The waiter was rude, rushed us from the time we sat down. Was annoyed if we'd ask questions or try to converse with him. Ewww, we got bitchy back after a few drinks and he then quit serving us and just brought our check. They didn't have music that night (or maybe we just missed it?). My friends left angry and I left embarrassed that I'd suggested an overpriced tacky tourist trap that from the evening proved to have no perks to it that I'd seen before. Overall I am over the Tonga Room. I have no plans to go back out of my own freewill. If it's an organized  party, then perhaps I will go as their planning for events is much better than their rude regular waiter service. But considering the 2 places I work now, I am the one that does the event management for all parties and organized celebrations I doubt I'll be back.", "author": "Audrey V."}

The sky hastily clouds over into thick, electric darkness.  The swaying trees start to frantically shake their limbs. And there it is! A cacophony of thunder and pounding rain! A spectacle of lightning! A menagerie of wild animals shrieking at the stormy skies!\n\nNow that I have your attention, let's talk Tonga Room, one of my favorite places to take out of town guests or to visit during happy hour with friends. Located in the basement of Nob Hill's Fairmont Hotel, the Tonga Room is the tiki bar of all tiki bars. Upon entering, the sheer size of the place takes precedent over the interior's details, but once seated it all comes together. Palm trees litter the space and the countless tables and chairs appear straight out of the verandah of a 1970s tropical getaway. A \"porch\" exists to the right, raised up by a few steps and covered with a thatched roof. Lanterns are strewn about and--get this--a swimming pool, presumably worked to represent the ocean, sits smack dab in the middle of this cavernous room! Unreal! Totally glorious!\n\nHappy hour offers a buffet that my carnivorous friends rarely decline, and I hear that the pork buns are actually rather tasty. Menus of tropical drinks sit atop every table and one can choose from a simple strawberry margarita to a giant bowl of alcohol to be shared between two. \n\nThe drinks are inconsistent in terms of strength and sometimes the fruit tastes, um, a bit overripe, but this review still lavishes the T.R. with 5 stars.

Too bad with proper management, better food and drinks it could be a money maker, it is not just locals that like kitsch, many tourists love it too as they don't have it, it is a part of Americana.\n\nIf you want a great tiki bar experience you have to check out Foridden Island.

It apparently was closed for a while but now it's re-opened, albeit with a lounge band playing Elton John and Lionel Ritchie tunes on the raft, instead of an orchestra.  So of course I had to check it out and report back to Mom.   \n\nI moseyed down there about 8:30 pm on a Friday and apparently I hit it just the right moment as there was no line and although there was only one of me, I got seated for dinner at a table for four although I said, \"I'm by myself, I'll gladly sit at the bar.\" (Huge table just for me? WTF? but whatever.)  By the time I left about an hour and  a half later there was a big ol' waiting line.   Plus, I no sooner got sitting down than they let loose with the fake rain-and-thunderstorm, which was pretty impressive.\n\nYes, this place is kitschy as all get-out, but somehow it's also way classier than similar theme joints in Las Vegas, Disney World, and malls here and there across America.  Part of it's the History Factor - the Tonga Room did it first.  Part of it's the attention to detail - the tropical drinks all have their own \"theme\" tiki glasses to match the drink.  For instance, the \"Pipeline\" cocktail has a surfer on the glass.  The servers all look like island folk.  And so on. \n\nThe dance floor is done up to look like the deck of a ship and it was worth going just to see the different types of dancers.  Everything from Dads dancing with their preschool kids, to the older couple who clearly has had a ton of dance lessons proceeding very unsmilingly through some type of 70s disco dance to a Bee Gees tune. \n\nMy drink was very sweet and good, and my prawns and hush puppies were huge, to match the huge price.  Yeah, it's expensive, but this is Nob Hill in San Francisco.  Deal.  Plus the fact that it costs a bit (and is located in the relatively pricey Fairmont) keeps out a lot of the more annoying tourist element, who probably troop on down the hill for a cheaper evening in Chinatown or on the Wharf.\n\nYou also don't need to dress up to go here. They recommend business casual, but I saw people at the bar looking like beach bums in faded old jeans and t-shirts, which did fit in with the decor. If you look too grungy you might get a fisheye from the frosty maitre d and doorman when you enter.   There is a discount on certain nights for hotel guests as well.\n\nAll in all I'd recommend it in all its slightly tacky glory.

Arrived at tonga room at 6.30, nobody was at the reservation counter, the line for walk-in were moving faster, so after waiting for 10 mins for someone to show up, we just went to the walk-in line.\n\nSERVICE WAS HORRIBLE. After the initial order, we wanted to order some more stuff, our server was nowhere to be seen, we asked 2 other servers, the standard reply was \"Let me get some server for you\", but even after waiting 20 mins still nobody to take our order. After reminding one of the other servers our server finally showed up.\n\nCocktails: we ordered pina colada and 2 other drinks, drinks were good. \nFood : , we ordered shrimp rolls, tonga platter and singapore noodles. All the fried stuff was too oily, and when I say too oily I mean dripping oil. And the singapore noodles were not good. The final bill for above stuff was $110.  Thats $55 per person, thats too much for the bad food we were served.\n\nAnthony Bourdain made it look like a very good place but in reality it is not worth your time and money.

Sweetie and I had dinner at the Tonga Room last Saturday as part of our San Francisco getaway experience.  We stayed at the Fairmont Hotel on a bed and breakfast package.  \n\nAmbiance:  \n\nI was not expecting to find a fun, festive party atmosphere at the Tonga Room.  We were both welcomed with \"lei's\" as soon as we entered the restaurant.  The place was dark, loud and full of laughter.  We were surprised to hear \"thunder\" then see the \"rain\" in the middle of the pool where the hut that also served as the stage was located.  \n\nSocial Scene:\n\nIt was fun to see multigenerational families celebrate together with fun drinks.  There were people who celebrated their birthdays that night, got engaged, etc. The dance floor was packed at 8PM. \n\nSalud!:   For me, Tonga Room was all about the drinks and the party atmosphere. The drinks were yummy.  Warning:  Order the Lava Ball Drink if you have the tolerance of an elephant.  If you are planning a long, intimate night, SKIP IT!!!! It was 151 proof! \n\nTaste:  Don't go there for the food. They were overpriced, common-placed Asian/Chinese food although our mongolian beef was very, very tender. It was ALMOST worth the $23.00 price.  The rest were so-so.  \n\nTab:  Our tab came up to $170.00 with tip  (one appetizer, 2 dishes, 2 rice, 2 drinks and 1 lava ball drink which 2 people has to share.   We were charged $7.00 a piece for music charge which was worth it.) \n\n\nHighly Recommended:\n\n\nThe good thing about dining/drinking at the Tonga Room and staying at the Fairmont was you can drink all you want.  After all the Lava drink, thank God we had a room upstairs because I yakked everything out after dancing.  I guess, heat, alcohol and dancing do not really mix especially if you are a lightweight. Sweetie got his groove on, though.  The dancer in him woke up.   Despite everything, we will definitely go back to eat, drink and dance at the Tonga Room. I will definitely avoid that Lava drink!!!!!", "author": "Leah E."}

On the bottom floor across from the gym -kinda hard to find.  The restaurant was large and dark.  Loved the pool in the middle.\n\nMenu:\n- The menus were in a hard cover binder WITH dividers as if it were used for school.  There was a $24 cocktail - a Cosmo 2K.  I didn't try it.  The cocktail menu wasn't as large as Trader Vic's.  The Mai Tai was also strong but served in a porcelain coconut.  The pineapple that was served as a garnish was still frozen.\n- The dinner menu wasn't very impressive.  Nothing really called out to me.  They had price fixed dinners to choose from that  I believe started in the $40 range. \n\nService:\n- The hostess wasn't so friendly.  Didn't ask us how we were and didn't smile.  We were sat at a table in the bar because they weren't sitting people for dinner quite yet.  The server/bartender was friendly at first but rushed us when he took our order and rudely snatched the drink menu out of my boyfriend's hand.  We were going to leave but we already ordered a Sampler Platter.  After that, the server/bartender was friendly.  Not sure what the snatching was all about.  \n\nFood:  \n- The food was OK.  We only based it on the Sampler Platter.  It came with fried prawns, ribs, chicken satay with a peanut sauce, veggie egg rolls and pot stickers.  They weren't really tasty.  Edible,  yes, but nothing that enticed me to stay for dinner.  So we didn't stay.\n\nPrice: \n- $9.50 for a Crown and Coke\n- $9.00 for a Mai Tai\n- $21.00 for the Sampler Platter\n\nEntertainment:\n- $5 entertainment fee for everyone staying after 8 PM\n- The room was the old pool.  A pool of water is still set in the middle of the room with a platform in the middle of it for the music/band.\n- Probably every half an hour, sounds of lightning and thunder are heard over the speakers and flashes of lightning are seen above the huts.  Rain falls from the ceiling and falls into the pool.  Very cool. \n\nDcor:\n- The room is dark.  Tall, wooden tiki gods are found everywhere.  You walk into the lobby and find the bar to your right with one LCD television, stools surrounding the bar and low cocktail tables.  Outrigger boat hangs from the ceiling to the left and lit glass buoys hang from the right.  The platform of a ship stretches the entire width of the room after the bar.", "author": "Bernadette M."}

Let me clarify the role of the Tonga Room...\n\nWHAT THE TONGA ROOM IS - one of the last authentic Polynesian Pop Tiki bars, a place to start the evening with nostalgic cheesiness that combines 60s Disney jungle rides with Don Ho and booze. It would be accurate to say that the Tonga Room is a symbol of a bygone tackiness that never ceases to amuse. There is food, but you are not there for the food. You are there for the tropical rainstorm every 15 minutes or so. You're there to drink fruity rum drinks next to a pool and listen to a band on a KonTiki raft play bad lounge music. You are there to occasionally dance badly to this music. Most importantly, you are there to put on a pleasant buzz with strong fruity drinks and laugh yourself silly. \n\nWHAT THE TONGA IS NOT - A place for a great meal. A place for hipsters to drink Fernet, do coke in the bathroom and converse in inadvertently ironic sarcasm speak. A place to listen to the latest music. And, last but not least, a place to be bitterly cynical. \n\nI hope this clears up any confusion for you.", "author": "Jay N."}

After experiencing it myself, I thought for sure I was going to find people on yelp saying the same stuff but boy was I wrong. Apparently, San Franciscans love the cheesy theme and rate this place with 4 and 5 stars for that rather than the food.\nAnyways, I'm going to get my two cents in. The menu at a glance looked really good. \"family style\" and  \"large plates\".. okay. Sounds good for a big group. NO. complete UTTER lies. Their large plates which average $25 per entree are NOT AT ALL large. Maybe it's large for a family of rats but really... please don't call it large when it's not. We thought ordering 5 dishes was going to be enough to share among 9 people but boy we ended up ordering 9 large plates and none of us really ate that much. That's the biggest thing that got on my nerves tonight. \nLet's get to the food. \"Fire Cracker Prawns\", \"Dragon Fire Chicken\". WOW sounds amazing. Too bad the food doesn't have what it takes to back any of those fancy words up. All the dishes lack real taste, the seafood still tasted fishy. Since we ordered 9 \"large\" plates, that's pretty much every dish on their \"large\" plates menu and in all honesty, I will not eat any of them even if they were $5 instead of the $25. \nService... not bad. Except the waiter gave me an alcoholic drink when I ordered pineapple juice and one of the chopsticks was broken at the tip which could've led to a bloody mouth.\nLastly, the environment. Overall, it's not bad. Except the damn thunderstorm that happens almost every 15 mins. I'll admit it, it was cool the first time it happened but when it started doing it every 15 minutes, it just got annoying and disruptive. \nBottomline, take your money somewhere else where they serve food that's actually tasty.", "author": "Steven L."}

However, there is a huge gap between what is on the paper and what is in reality. \n\nEnvironment: The place may be under construction. The roof looks like half way done warehouse. If you don't look up, the place is actually very interesting with its tropical island theme. \n\nDrink: The price for cocktail is pretty good, somewhere around $7.50. But the wine seems a little pricey. The drink itself is OK, nothing special, I had Mai Tai. \n\nBuffet: Such a disappointment. All they had were spring rolls, deep fried won-ton, stir fry noodles, cabbage with pork, and some cheese and fruit. First of all, I truly felt the food was not worth of $9.50; second, the quality of the food is not great; third, the taste of the food is just average. Thinking of Tonga Room in Fairmont Hotel, Gosh, it is even worse any Chinese buffet in China town you can get for $6.50/person. \n\nService: Oh-my-god!!! We must own her money in the previous life, no smile on her face, harsh tone in her voice, very slow service, over charged bill... one word, 'horrible'.

The menu features island style dishes... and you are surprised when the waiters arrive with chinese-style dishes (but worse than any chinese food i've ever had), with \"island\" aka sweet sauces.  On top of that, some of the dishes we ordered had many \"extra\" ingredients added in, and we couldn't really recognize them from the menu (we almost sent one back because we thought we got the wrong thing).  If you are planning on serving something - give an accurate description of it on the menu.\n\nVery disappointing.

It's always been a fun\nplace, usually chosen for a work get together, farewell party, or celebration of some kind.  It's always been amusing to enter the \"other world\" atmosphere of the rain forest, don leis, and be transported to \nthe South Pacific, far from the clang of cable cars on California Street.\n\nIt mattered not that the food and drinks were a little pricey, we were always there for a party and the occasional splurge was fine.  We were worth it.  We left full and happy and usually danced a bit, and that, after all, is what the Tonga Room is about.\n\nI was surprised last night when my son's girlfriend chose the Tonga Room as the place for his 24th birthday celebration.  Except for me, 64-years-old, the other seven guests were under 28 ( nice of them to include the gal who endured labor to deliver the 9 pound eight ounce boy!! ).  We had a great time.  They shared the Scorpion for four, I had a Zombie - fun drinks, the kind you see in Hawaii and they were pretty tasty, no more expensive than what you find anywhere in San Francisco at a hotel bar.  The food was definitely a bit pricey but it was pretty good.  I thought my Kahlua pork kau kau was the tastiest with slow braised pork, onions, shiitake mushrooms, baby spinach and rich broth ( $28 ).  The Mongolion beef tenderloin at $26 was like any you'd get at a decent Chinese restaurant.  Granted, most of the dishes would have easily served two diners..as they forewarned in the front of the menu.  There was plenty left over to take home.\n\nThe appetizer platter for two at $25 was nice with an assortment that included Tonga's Aloha pork ribs, shiitake egg rolls, pot stickers, flatbread with macadamia nut spread and jumbo coconut prawns.  \n\nOnly the birthday boy opted for dessert since it was complimentary - a Tonga Volcano - passion fruit mousse wrapped in meringue with a molten raspberry center, served flaming.  It was $10 on the menu and I almost rethought the whole dessert thing.  I am a passion fruit addict.  Thankfully, he did share with his mother and it was superb.\n\nThe band was decent and the dance floor was jumping.  They played a whole litany of songs that were multigenerational so that, even I, was dancing in my seat.  \n\nOK, so maybe, the thunder and lightning and rainfall are a little hokey, but it was great fun.

Our waiter seemed a little frazzled though. It was a Wednesday at 8:30 and I think more people showed up late for dinner than they were expecting. He took our drink order and then disappeared for quite a while. When he showed up again he took someone's order who arrived 10 minutes after us. A busser saw me put my arm up like \"what the hell\" so he tried to take our order. So basically, our waiter sucked and was inattentive, but the busser was super friendly and kept stopping by to make sure that we were happy. He made up for the waiter.\n\nWe ordered 4 appetizers instead of full meals. The green papaya salad was basically a $16 plate of cole slaw, so not stoked on that. The poke was good, but small. Mushroom eggrolls were good, as was the vegetable tempura. Overall, if I was just rating food, this would probably get a 2.5. I would only go back for the drinks, which while pricey, definitely had a good amount of liquor in them, so you get what you pay for.\n\nI also agree with everyone else that adding a cover charge for music to your bill when you already spent almost $100 on dinner and drinks should be waived. The band was really talented though, so I see why they charge a cover for at least people in the bar. It would be cool if they had a steel drum band instead of a cover band playing Enrique Iglesias, but they were still good.\n\nAlso nice, they brought out a flaming volcano thing for dessert since it was our anniversary.

The biggest disappointment is the Lava bowls, they used to be wonderfully presented and made such a great first impression when brought to the table with fresh fruit such as pineapple and cherries, and the flavor was sweet, fresh and delicious, they have now went cheap with a light rum, and ginger beer with a few slices of lime floating in it, the taste is bitter, and incredibly acidic...so so sad...", "author": "Steven D."}

We went at about 6 for Happy Hour and the buffet. \n     The drinks were good (my girlfriend's Mai Tai was rather strong) and my Lava Flow was delicious (I ordered it even though it wasn't one of the Happy Hour drinks - well worth it!). We then moved on to a couple of pi\u00f1a coladas which were delicious and, what's more, were served promptly.\nAnd the food? Well we were a tad reluctant to go after reading the reviews on here that told of sub-par food and poor service. I'm sorry but they're wrong. The food is rather good, especially at the buffet prices. I shall go here in the future and see what the full-priced fare is like. I am sure it will be pretty good.\n     The reason this is my first review is because I though it was of the utmost importance to convey to other yelp! users that this place is AWESOME. Who wouldn't like thunder, lighting, and torrential downpours every 20-30 minutes? Who wouldn't like tacky island music being played by a band on a floating stage in a 'lagoon'?

The partial pirate ship inside was also cool.  \n\nThe thing is, for it being utterly dead, did we really have to get seated at the end nearest the door.   There were seats in huts and on the ship, there was plenty to look at and enjoy but we were seated so far away from it all it was hard to see any of it.  No music to speak of, I'm sure there was but that tells you just how meh it was.  \n\nThe drinks were good, so that's a plus, I was definitely a little too happy on my way home but that's as much the fault of the limited food options - read no options for veggies.  \n\nI'm giving three stars; this is a place you have to see because it is a classic, but maybe try to be there when other people are around for a more pleasurable experience.  Enjoy your drinks, they're well made even though they're slow.  I hate to say it but based on what I saw, I'm not that surprised there's talk of closing it.

And the \"lagoon\" where the fake river boat floats out with the washed-up cover band singing horrible  versions of already horrible music punctuated by mock monsoons every so often, is a glorified gym pool.  This sounds way more fabulous than it is.\n\nThe crowd is mostly a random mix of hotel wedding guests and tourists working the dance floor after a scorpion or two or three.   \n\nBut I am glad I went.

The middle of the room features a large pool (used to be part of the Fairmont's original swimming pool) and a floating tiki island a band plays on. Every 15 minutes, thunder crashes, and it rains over the pool. But what's awesome is that it's not \"ironic\", it's just left over from when tiki torches were really glamorous. The dance floor looks like the bow of a ship, and you can sit in little tiki huts.\n\nYeah, the drinks are overpriced, and ordering actual meals is pointless. Go during the happy hour for slightly cheaper drinks, and an all-you-can-eat $8 buffet of  faux Chinese food (pot stickers, spare ribs, won tons, chow mein, etc), which is good in a bad way.  Sure, you'll spend a lot of money, but it's not an everyday type of place. The tropical drinks are very sweet and strong enough; the Bloody Marys are bad; the regular mixed drinks are strong too. \n\nAnd yes, it would be better if the band played something other than \"I Just Called To Say I Love You\", but then that would mean that the Tonga Room got wise to its extreme campiness, and that would probably be less fun overall.\n\nIn conclusion, of you like things campy and retro, the Tonga Room is a good time. It would be nice if the quality of the drinks and food were better, but I personally don't mind paying once in awhile for the wonderfully eclectic ambiance (plus it's nice and darkish in there.) And the fact that it's full of Midwestern tourists and not trendy drunk hipsters is, at times, as refreshing as tropical rainstorm that arrives every quarter of an hour. It's pretty glamorous as long as you appreciate that sort of thing, and you don't get to experience it all the time.

Has a lot of cool history behind this place. Really nice 'tiki\" bar atmosphere to it. Has what use to be the old swimming pool there where some sort of boat/barge floats around with the house band on it. Interesting drinks. A little dance floor (nice after about 4 or 5 drinks). A little area by the bar to sit at.\n\n(- side): Drinks are a little pricey. Has some sort of 'entertainment/sitting' fee (about $6/person, might be more).\n\nThey do have some dinner/food/buffet but I didn't eat there and you can probably find some info. here on yelp. Oh ya, the part where we were escorted out by security was pretty classy. Luckily, my friend decided to use the \"Chewbacca\" defense and we avoided any further altercation.", "author": "Rob H."}

After trying out the Peppermill  during our last Vegas trip (per his recommendation) the BF and I have decided his word is gold!  So when we saw him stop by The Tonga Room in one of his episodes of The Layover it was promptly added to our \"To-Do\" list for our trip to San Fran.  Let me tell you Tony Bourdain you did it again.  We had a blast at the Tonga Room!!  We got there about 8pm and there was a line to get a seat at the bar which luckily for us only took about 20 mins to get through.  The ambiance of the place is wonderful.  Polynesian themed with dim lighting, bright lamp shades and a pool that sudden, unexpected rain showers poured down on.  We were hoping to make it in time for happy hour (as I hear it's great) but alas we didn't.  However after the couple of drinks we had - me the Chi-Chi and the BF a Mai Tai - we didn't even notice the lack of food in our bellies.  The drinks were strong and tasty and the waitstaff oh so friendly.  The only gripe I would have about this place is the host at the front desk.  He was pretty unhelpful with people's questions and considering there was a line and no indication on why everyone was waiting in said line while other groups walked straight up to the host and were seated promptly there definitely were questions!  Also, they have live bands certain days of the week which even as a bar patron you are going to pay to see $5 per person I believe.  We finished our drinks before the show begin so I can't comment on if it's worth the price or not.  All in all a very fun place even for a somewhat large group - a must see if you are ever in the area.", "author": "Nicole M."}

If you're even remotely fond of the Tiki scene and Polynesian Pop, this is the place for you. To be clear, I'd give the Tonga Room a 5 for the atmosphere alone. The drinks, I'm happy to say, have improved over time (they seem to be using better rum and overall they taste fresher). So why am I giving it just 3 stars? I ate dinner there last night, and the dinner was truly lousy. I get the impression all the ingredients are frozen (that tinny taste to the vegetables and flavorless chicken lead me to this conclusion), and they are very heavy-handed with overly sweet sauces; the food is drowning in them.

Our waiter was beyond hilarious and REALLY encouraged us to keep drinking...heh.  We decided to order a bunch of small plates and/or appetizers to share.  I was very happy with all of the food that we chose...it was all very yummy.  Our drinks were amazing and strong enough to get you pretty tipsy even after just one.  The only downfall I would say is that it can get pretty pricey.  You are paying more for the experience and atmosphere than anything.  We stayed just long enough to see the cover band play on their floating boat for a couple of songs.

The pool in the middle of the room is unique, and the \"thunder\" and \"rain\" over the pool was amusing. And my waiter was pretty attentive and friendly--I had made a reservation and he referred to me by name throughout my  meal, which was a nice touch. The drinks were well done too. Blue Hawaiian was delicious, and the mai-tai was good and was served in a ceramic fake coconut cup--so the bar really said \"tiki.\" But after that, things turned fairly average. The food was decent but overpriced. Had the hana pork that really needed to be served over rice, which was an extra charge. It was good, but the menu was definitely  more Chinese than Polynesian, which was a big disappointment. There was an automatic cover charge for everyone who entered, $5 on weekdays, and $7 on weekends. I didn't think that was cool for those who came for dinner--people are dropping $40 or more per person, and you need to charge more for the band? I was there on a Wednesday, and the band was good but not what I expected. They played jazzy soft rock and classics, again a bit of a disappointment since I'm in a Hawaiian-themed restaurant. Mix in some Henry Kapono, Izzy, and even some Don Ho--or someone should be playing a slack-key guitar. Maybe the weekend show is more Hawaiian-flavored, I don't know. The band does play on a covered \"boat\" that floats out toward the middle of the pool--gives a bit of an extra zip to the show and puts them nearer the center of the room for all to see. The decor looks to have stayed the same since the 1940s or so, which is OK as it's not run down, and it's darker in tone, not vibrant like a more modern take on tiki. Overall, if you're travelling to SF, it's a landmark and something worth going to. A caution to single diners: make a reservation for one if you want to do anything other than sit at the bar. They were hesitant about seating me at a regular table at first, but after I mentioned I had a reservation they were happy to oblige with no further discussion.", "author": "Rick B."}

Just how momma likes it.\r\n\r\nladies and gentlemen, if you have not been here, it is worth the headache.  There is nowhere like this on earth (but probably there is in heaven i don't know i haven't been there).  i can only think that this bar was dreamed up in an alcoholic black out after pounding singapore slings and pork buns for 48 hours straight.  i give it four stars for the atmosphere (three of those stars are for the indoor monsoons. they are maybe the best idea a human being has ever had ever.)  the last star is because of the two fantasies this bar has inspired in me.  Don't worry, I will share.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST DREAM:\r\nFinally, I scare up the nerve to do what my friends and I have been threatening to do for a long time, and stow away on the band ship.  I stay hidden (behind the speakers? underwater with a straw from the bar? I haven't figured out that part yet) until we're in the middle of the lagoon and there's NO ESCAPE.  Then, with catlike agility, I pop up, chloroform the singer, and take the mic.  I start out with a song i know will get them.  I sing: Cocomo.  Now in normal life, i have an unbridled hatred for the beach boys but for some reason, tonight, cocomo just seems right.  at first the band is stunned and suspicious and i have to sing a cappella.  then the keyboard player in the turquoise blazer starts nodding--he gets it.  He starts to jam along.  pretty soon I've even won over the cynical alcoholic drummer who should have quit years ago.  when that song is over, without speaking, together on the same transcendental plane of groove, we all simultaniously launch into a thirty minute long cover of chic's LE FREAK.   by the second time i tell the crowd that le freak c'est chic the entire bar is FREAKING OUT.  They are all both FEELING THE RHYTHM and also CHECKING THE RIDE. I BRING THE MFING HOUSE DOWN.  i leave, to return only in the legend told in whispers late at night.  \r\n\r\nFANTASY NUMBER TWO: \r\nit's the last song before closing.\r\nSurrounded by elderly tourists and conventioneers, i'm holding my special someone and doing the 8th grade slow dance two step while the chick on the boat sings \"tiny dancer\".  the bartender is wiping down the bar, the waiters are finishing their side work, the singer's voice is tired and gravelly, and i'm just swaying back and forth with the old people and silently weeping with the beauty of it all.", "author": "joy m."}

We made reservations since we had a group, and good thing because there was a huge line out the door and around the corner. My first impression was that the atmosphere was awesome. We knew in advance that we would have to pay $7 per person because there was a band playing that night. Unfortunately, the band didn't come on until an hour after we sat down and only played for half of the time that we were there. The service was extremely slow and English definitely wasn't the waiter's first language, making it difficult to communicate. One of my friends asked if they had a gluten-free menu. The waiter told her no but that they could make anything on the menu gluten-free. Obviously, that is not true, but that could potentially be dangerous if someone has a serious allergy to a certain type of food. In addition, the waiter was very pushy, trying to up-sell us on ordering more food and pricier drinks throughout the night. When our food finally arrived, it was all delicious, so no complaints there. Then came time to pay the bill.... Three couples paid with cash and two paid with credit card. We gave the waiter the two cards and $370 in cash. He left with it only to come back a minute later without the cash, saying that we were $65 short. He swore that his co-worker double counted the cash, but the supposed co-worker never came out to confirm and we never saw the cash again. One of my friends paid the extra $65 just so we could leave but a few of us didn't feel that was fair and asked to speak to the manager.

Still, the fun factor wins. And I would like to personally shake hands with whomever came up with the names of their house drinks -- hilarious!", "author": "Gregor G."}

I entered the Fairmont hotel from the California st. entrance and turned right to make my way around the corner to a unique dining area.  I slid past the dance floor to where my party tables as I began to feel like I was on a pier in Hawaii- minus the humidity.  I began socializing in the dim tropical ambiance when all of a sudden it started getting wet!  Leaky roof?!?!? Nah, welcome to the Tonga room's indoor typhoon- rain, thunder, and strobe lights.  It was slightly distracting during conversation, but at times it was a welcome break in monotony. \nThe band plays on a floating straw hut in the middle of a huge pond which I like to call the \"indoor pacific ocean.\"  They played some classic cover songs and when I say classic I mean golden oldies.  They played so clean that sometimes I thought I was listening to the actual record being played; so I had to look at the lead vocalist from time to time just to remind myself that they were actually performing live. \nThe room is filled with suspended canoes and tropical warrior weapons screwed into the wall- adding to the island fantasy. I was just waiting for the hula girls to appear but they never came.  After a cold Sierra Nevada, the food made its way to the table.  I'll be honest I didn't know what to expect since my friend ordered everything.  I was thinking island food probably, but I was wrong.  It was actually Chinese food.  The egg soup was delicious but spicy. How Spicy? Make you sweat-like- a-pig in front of everybody spicy.  So if you're one of those that tends to get hot under the collar- have the napkin in hand while eating the soup.  The main course was pretty good- coconut shrimp , really really tender beef and broccoli, plain white rice (nothing spectacular), and some mango ice cream for dessert.  Ah, reminiscing about it is making me salivate.  I have no complaints and I would so go again.  Maybe next time I'll bring a surf board and jump in to the indoor pacific.", "author": "JONATHAN A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-04-30", "description": "Perhaps my expectations were low since I was expecting this to be just an expensive hokey tourist trap.  However having lived in the Bay Area my whole life I figured I had to go to the Tonga Room at least once in my life.  We had dinner reservations for 6:45 but got there 2 hours earlier in order to experience the bar and appetizer buffet ($10 per person with a 1 drink per person minimum).  Not great but good.\n\nAfter the drinks and apps at the bar we relocated to our table in the dining area next to the \"lagoon\" - formerly the hotel's swimming pool.  Yes, it was hokey but also very cool.  The dinner prices weren't even as high as I had expected.  The service was excellent.  Our waiter was very attentive and friendly.\n\nWe had made our reservation on line through YELP.   Very professionally we received a reminder/confirmation phone call a couple of days before.  I'm glad they did call because one of the things the lady told us was that everyone still in the restaurant or bar after 8 gets an automatic $7 cover charge added to their bill for the \"entertainment\" that starts at 8 PM.  Since our reservation was for 6:45 we were concerned about being stuck for an additional $14 cover charge when we had little control over how fast the service might be or in the event we found the entertainment to be really aweful.  We were also worried that if our dinner ran only 15 or 20 minutes past the 8:00 curfew and had incurred the charge, we'd then be given the \"bum's rush\" to hurry up and vacate the table once we were finished eating.  Our waiter assuaged our concerns on both accounts by telling us that at his station we could stay without being charged the extra cover until 8:30 PM and that once we were finished eating and if we wanted to sit at the table and stay longer we could stay as long as we wanted.  While I'm sure he would have been true to his word about being able to stay a little longer without the extra charge and even though, because of the great service, we were pretty much finished by 8:00 anyway,  we decided take him up on his offer and stay a bit longer in order to get the whole Tonga Room experience and check out the music.  While it wasn't what we expected (we assumed it might be Polynesian style music) the light rock the small combo played on the \"barge\" in the middle of the \"lagoon\" was O.K.  They even got us up on the dance floor a couple of times.  We ended up staying till almost 10.\n\nOver all I think the Tonga Room is a really good \"must do\" San Francisco experience for both the locals as well as tourists.  It is an historic exprience from another era.   It evokes the feelings and atmosphere from another time.  It is a little kitchy but it is also sort of romantic.", "author": "Duane S."}

But let's be fair and hear the whole story....Went there with the boy to take advantage of their famous happy hour. We had knocked around the idea for the last 2 years and finally felt like actually going. The price for the appetizer buffet is $9.50 with a one drink minumum (done and done!). The drinks are at special happy hour prices which is $1.50 off of the regular prices. So the Mai Tai is $7.50 instead of the usual $9.00. I think my tender tummy was a little too empty for the super strong Mai Tai and the buffet was filled with fried foods. The food isn't gourmet or anything, but grubbin nonetheless. Kalua Pork with Cabbage-grubbin. Chow Mein-grubbin. Fruit Plate-grubbin. Pork filled fried Won Tons-grubbin. Egg Rolls-grubbin. Sorry for the overuse of the made up word, 'grubbin' as the choice adjective for tasty. I never even use that word. Ever. Somehow it looks less douchebag chode in print, ya know? Anyway, the food was the yum-yum quality of some cool snacks your friend heats up at their house to go with your alcohol munchies.  I really went to town, too, so I can see how there was a little trauma to the system. \n\nImportant tip: If you want to partake in the Tonga Room happy hour, you MUST get there right when it starts at 5:00 PM. 5:30 might be acceptable but not after that. I didn't once see anyone refill the table so first come, first served, baby.", "author": "Magi C."}

Majority of my experience at the Tonga was killer. Drinks were good, band was cheesy as all hell, the waiter was friendly, and we had a blast on the dance floor. We encountered a few problems though. I tried the lava bowl and scorpion bowl (shared, of course) and maybe my taste buds are whack but they tasted identical. No worries though because they were STRONG. Other people's drinks, however, weren't so strong and quite disappointing (e.g. daiquiris and coladas).  Next complaint is service. While our waiter was friendly and patient with our drunk asses, dinner took almost 3 hours! It was a 3-course prix fixe family style meal so the plates should have been flying out of the kitchen. Last complaint was the astronomical bill at the end. Dinner was set at $50/person, which was incredibly overpriced for mediocre salty asian food. Somehow the price was more than doubled by the end with drinks at $10/each and \"entertainment\" fee. \n\nI'm sure I'll be back for some event or birthday party but at least I'll be ready with my bowl o' booze and wad of cash.", "author": "Susan L."}

The food was \"meh\" at best and we were brought the wrong spring rolls, wrong chicken satay, wrong drinks. It was a total cluster and if we hadn't had so much to drink (before and during), probably would have been pissed, plus service was super sloooooooooooow. With that being said, when the live music started (which was a combination Micheal Buble/60's/70's favorites), everyone perked up and we really started having a corny good time. It was super sweet to see little kids dancing with their parents too. We were slightly shell-shocked when we got our bill - 3 alcoholic drinks, 1 iced tea, 2 appetizers and 3 entrees = $174 + a $5 per person entertainment charge, not including tip. Ouch. We'll probably go again, but next time we'll stick to the bar and eat elsewhere. Oh - LOVE the thunder, lightning and rain over the pool that appears every 30 minutes; a really neat touch.

The service was so miserably awful that we actually said at the table, \"I am going to Yelp the sh*t out of this place.\" Hence the review.\nAnyway we were \"greeted\" at the door by an incredibly angry middle aged woman, apparently the matre d' if you could call her that.  I can honestly say, I have never been treated with such hostility before by someone at a restaurant.  We were not a bad crowd either - 6 attractive, completely sober 25-30 year olds, with a reservation mind you, and dressed to the nines. We asked about the cover as it was our 1st time there and we had reservations, and she couldn't be bothered to explain anything and just stared at us with an angry face. So we all start taking money out to give to her, since it appeared that she wasn't letting us in. She looked at us like we were idiots and told us it goes on our bill. Fine. We didn't care. Then she sat us down at a table that was a seat short, and when my boyfriend went to one of the 5 empty tables around us to take a chair (which easily fit in) for himself, she told him no, he could not do that and we would have to move. Odd? We didn't really get it and she walked away with us standing there confused, so we took the chair and carried on.  \nEventually a waiter handed out menus and we ordered up some drinks.  Let me also mention that while we were ordering the waiter was pressed up against me and leaning down so he was smacking me in the head over and over and over again with his notepad and it was uncomfortable to say the least. Then he took all the menus while we were requesting to keep one. Drinks came.  Some were better than others but really cute and fun and that's what we were looking for so it was fine. The bill came but we weren't even 1/4 done with our drinks. The waiter kept coming back for the bill but it had only been a few minutes and my scorpion bowl was full! Another friend wanted to order another drink, but it was way too complicated for him to manage a single mojito and he was very perturbed by the whole idea.  He was making such a big deal out of it that she finally lost it and cancelled it and we wanted to get the heck out of there. $150 for one drink a piece and being treated like garbage. \nI will say the band was great, the kitschy environment and really uniquely done tiki theme was really fun, and spirits were high. It's actually a fun place that I normally could have had a great time at. But the service is so awful that I would NEVER bring out of towners there again.

On weekends they have a band performing on the floating stage.  Who wouldn't want to experience that at least once?  This is truly a unique place.  As far as the food goes, I think it is pretty tasty.  It is sort of Hawaiian/Asian infusion types of food.  I think it is beneficial to split dishes here.  Drinks are yummy.  They have one called The Lava Bowl (I think) and it is for two.  This thing is huge.  I suggest getting one for yourself if you want to get tanked.  They also have a pretty good Mai Tai.  I've gotten dessert here once for a birthday.  We got the brownie with ice cream.  It was gigantic and delicious.  Overall, this is a good place to go every now and then or to take an out of towner because it has such a unique atmosphere and the food is decent too.

The atmosphere was so fun if you're looking for a place that is upbeat and doesn't take itself too seriously. On certain nights they have a band that plays music on a boat in the middle of a pool and we thought that was really fun! But be prepared to pay a $7 cover charge per person on those nights, even if you're eating dinner there. We tried four different appetizer type dishes... the calamari, coconut shrimp, chicken satay and the vegatable spring rolls; they were all pretty good. The drinks are amazing and they do not skimp on the alcohol! At a minimum of $12 per drink I actually felt like I was getting my money's worth. We tried the Chi Chi and the Bora Bora and they were both delicious and very tropical. I had read that the service wasn't that great but we had no problems at all. They were friendly enough and the service was pretty quick. We will definitely go back to the Tonga Room the next time we're in San Francisco, it was such a fun place! If you're looking for a quiet, uptight restaurant this is not the place for you. Reservations highly recommended.", "author": "Michele M."}

When we got there they said we could not sit down because we did not have a reservation, but we could sit at the bar and wait until 8:30 (45 minutes).  We thought about it and agreed to go to the bar area and have a scorpian bowl. As we sat in the bar area overlooking a sea of empty tables for over ten minutes, I knew what was going on. They wanted us to spend money at the bar, then seat us - the oldest trick in the book. Note to Tonga Room - that trick only works if it is semi busy and you can pretend the seats are actually about to fill up with reservations!  When the waiter finally came and took our order he was not friendly at all. When the scorpian bowl came, it was really just a small mug full of juice with a splash or rum. $17 for that little cup of juice! After sitting there for over a half hour, looking at the empty tables, we decided to leave rather than spend $29 on an entree of crappy Chinese food. It took forever to get the check and for him to bring back the credit card. By that point it was past 8:30, all the tables were still empty, and they didn't offer to seat us. We left and went to Chinatown for authentic Chinese food.  Oh, yeah, and the decor, sure it's kitschy but the rainshow looks more like a firesprinkler went off. There was no band playing.", "author": "Mark S."}

We showed up about 10 minutes early for an 8pm reservation on Friday night, and were very excited for the cheesy atmosphere and \"girly\" drinks to come. \n\nFirst off, there were two lines at the door - one for hotel guests and one for those with reservations. No one was in either line, but I felt like we were entering a club and those with \"table service\" get priority. The sign said \"$7 cover after 8pm\" so we asked if we still had to pay it since A) it was still before 8pm, if only by a few minutes, and B) we had a reservation for dinner (and would already be guaranteed to spend $$ inside) .They told us yes. No explanation. No apology. I was baffled. Yes, I had read that sometimes there is a cover here, but nowhere when I made the reservation did it mention this, on the restaurant's site or opentable or anywhere else. We were extremely disapointed and ended up walking away, not because we can't afford $7/person, but because $21 automatically added onto our tab makes an expensive dinner even more ridiculously expensive. And no one had told us beforehand. They weren't even nice about it. Does that mean I could have made the reservations for 7:30? Clearly I should have booked elsewhere.

The place is a cross between a tropical island and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney.  \n\nMet my family members there and was immediately struck by the thunderstorm raining in the middle of the restaurant.  This was the intro for the cover band, which floated out on a boat to the middle of the rainstorm swimming pool.  Funky band, too.  Did everything from Bobby Darren to Queen.  Lead singer looked like a young Chinese-American guy, other members of the band also seemed Asian, fitting in with the Tongan theme, sorta.  They totally made you want to get up and boogie.  My 10-year-old niece just loved them.\n\nThe food was remarkably good given the level of cheese in the decor.  I had a duck breast which was tender and moist.  The mongolian beef tasted really good as well.  \n\nPrices were on the higher side for what you got, but that's to be expected at a place like this, where it's all about the decor.  Worth trying at happy hour, I think.\n\nI would have given this 4 stars except for the fact that parking there is a NIGHTMARE.  I had to actually park in the Fairmont Hotel parking garage, which charges $5 per every 20 minutes!  Maxes at $50!!!  I ended up paying more for parking than for dinner.

It's the kitsch: tiki torches, wooden tribal carvings, indoor thunderstorms, smarmy bands sailing their barge on the tempestuous sea while crooning \"Sail-ing... Takes me awaaaaaaaaaaaaay, to where I'm going....\" And the point is also, of course, the drinks -- the giant, colorful, umbrella'ed, bucket size drinks for two (or in some cases, even four). So you could eat, and you probably should, because otherwise the hangover from those frothy libations would be wicked.  And you could do worse, but (does it need saying?), you could do better too. \n\nTonga bills its fare as Pacific Rim comfort food, or some such improbable description. On my recent visit, I got Mongolian Beef stir fry with crispy noodles, which arrived in a thick soupy brown sauce that no way ever touched a wok, some weird mushrooms and a smattering of crinkle cut carrots (I think). My description sounds bad, but it was actually pretty good, in the way that pizza-when-you're-drunk is. Maybe their seafood dishes are better and more refined, but this stuff was basically fast food with an elevated price tag -- all main dishes looked to be in the high-20s to 30 dollar range. \n\nSo again, I'm telling you, visit, but not for the food. And if you are in the area, do it quick: I have read that the Fairmont wants to turn this place into another bland grey soulless hotel restaurant, which (no matter how little Tonga's food has to recommend it) would be a great loss of one of the time-honored charming oddities that makes SF so unique.", "author": "Jenny B."}

Walking into the lobby of The Fairmont is pretty impressive and I loved the tiki theme/thunderstorm gimmick at the Tonga Room, but the cover band and the clientele started to bum me out after about an hour. I witnessed all the characteristics of bad club dancing (excessive finger pointing, side-to-side marching/stepping, light kicking/leaping into the air) to the listener-friendly cover tunes of '70-'80's rock and soul. It was like being at a bad wedding or at club night on a cruise ship. On the other hand, the aforementioned clientele seemed to genuinely have a great time, so who am I to judge? Maybe I just needed to have some more drinks to make it enjoyable. (but if you HAVE to drink to make it enjoyable, is it worthwhile? again...the mixed emotions thing)\nDrinks are expensive so you may as well make the most of it and get a themed drink instead of your old boring rum and Coke.\nIn closing: Not a bad choice if you are looking to entertain a wide variety of ages for maybe 2 hours.

The food was just ok I had a $24 Singapore Noodles which was just ok, I've had better Singapore noodles or chow mei fun I think it's called for less than $5 at a take out Chinese restaurant. Service was mixed, I walked in, didn't make reservations but did get seated right away but at the lounge which has smaller tables which was fine but then the hostess who seated me with my party of three others gave us one menu without any explanation and still I was fine with that. Our waitress was nice and friendly, older Asian woman, I ordered a drink a scotch neat Macallan for anyone who cares and it arrived in a glass that looked opaque but only in certain spots, I rubbed my finger on the inside of the glass only to smear some kind of greasy substance and I found that absolutely repulsive. I walked up to the bar and kindly asked for another drink because my glass was dirty and the bartender referred me to the waitress so I unhappily went to my waitress and showed her the glass to which she was very apologetic and replaced the drink with me looking on of course. Through all of this I didn't make a fuss or complaint because I was just too tired and just wanted to go home. Needless to say I would never return, it's overpriced, mediocre food and entertainment for those who are easily amused, and I had some of those people with me.", "author": "J B."}

Okay so the buffet is $9 and all you can eat with the purchase of one of their drinks but the service cancels that out.  If you go, look to wait at least 30 mins for someone to come by and ask for your order and don't even think about going up to the bar cause they won't let you.  The novelty wears off in about 10 minutes.  The buffet leaves little to be desired so the chances of you going for seconds or thirds probably won't happen.

I've heard about this place on the Food Network, so I was curious to see how good/bad it was. I passed up on the alcohol and opted for their Innocent Passion instead. I forgot what was in it, but it was good stuff. For dinner, my aunt and I split on a Tonga platter and an order of Huli Huli chicken. The best of the two was definitely the platter. I actually ate more of that than the chicken. I had to cut off a star when it was time for dessert. The Flaming Volcano wasn't as spectacular as I thought it would be. I could taste the alcohol that provided the \"flame\" while eating it. I knew I should have ordered the sticky rice instead! But despite my disappointment, the place isn't too bad. The live band played good music and had people on the dance floor in a matter of minutes. I keep hearing about renovations being due here, which isn't a bad idea seeing that it's pretty dated.

The buffet is only $9.50, but the food selection is limited and not very good.

The first was barely mixed and all the alcohol seemed to be on one side of the bowl. The 2nd one was ridiculously strong (a plus I guess). \n\nCan't say anything bad about the ambiance; the restaurant is very nicely done.

Pros of the tonga room are the fabulous and unique decor, the dancefloor! (which was really the reason for my choice), the yummy Huli Huli Chicken, and the yummier banana mouse dessert. The Tonga Room has a pool in the middle of the restaurant and a thunderstorm over the pool every hour; personally I would've preferred if the thunderstorm would've sprinkled over the restaurant patrons as well but what can you do. They have a live band after 8 which plays on a boat that goes back and forth across the pool and a dancefloor which shakes slightly with the thunderstorm. The tonga room is covered with hawaiian/pirate decor which comes together very nicely. The cons are the food and the price; except for the items mentioned above it's really not very good, especially the Mongolian Beef. Another con is the music as in my opinion it was far too loud and I had trouble talking to my guests. The set-up of the Tonga Room isn't the best if you're in a large group. The band and the pool are in the middle of the restaurant and take up a lot of space and the tables are to the side of the pool which would have been fine for a regular occasion but for my birthday I would've preferred an environment that was more intimate and secluded. As already suggest I would also recommend coming here for drinks or for a small meal with a small group but certainly do come.", "author": "Alla B."}

Granted it did cost only $9.95 but gee, I would expect any food a nice hotel like The Fairmont would serve would be good.  It was so carb laden, rices, pastas, really awful egg rolls and some fried dumpling chicken thing (glad they labeled it, I never would have guessed it was chicken), all tasteless.  Why not charge $19.95 and serve something decent?\nLater when the music started, a few people danced but the most touching thing was when two father - young daughter couples danced together.  In fact, there were a couple of large, multigenerational groups who were having a great time.  So, something special was going on there and do appreciate that.  \nI understand that the hotel is thinking about relocating The Tonga.  I say let them, but make the experience more upscale, something to match the rest of the hotel.\nIf you go, go just for drinks.  They were fun and fruity to match the theme/decor and the service was quite good.\nOne final note, I don't think it's worth staying for the music.  We decided to - for the full effect you know.  A couple of the musicians looked like they might actually be Polynesian, so I wondered if we might hear some Hawaiian type music.  Nope, the first song was More Than a Woman.  Very 70's and campy.

But it's a blast! The ambiance is great. There's thunder and lightening. The band starts at 8 and plays music you can dance latin to, like the cha-cha, rhumba, mambo and even a fox trot and swing. I like to get there when the band starts and leave around 9-9:30 when the band starts playing some other kind of music.  Don't come expecting a gourmet experience. This place is unlike anyplace else outside of 1960s Las Vegas. It's a little trip to Hawaii just down the block.  The food can be the best. The forbidden rice is lovely.

It was my brother's 21st birthday Sunday, so at midnight we headed to the Tonga Room since we had rooms at the Fairmont for his first, celebratory legal cocktail. We headed in around 11:50, explained to the bartender it was his 21st. The bartender was extremely unfriendly. We said we knew we had to wait until 12:00 but we all wanted a round of the Mai Thai's they are supposedly famous for. He then told my  brother who was all smiles and excited for his 21st birthday cocktail, to get away from the bar and that he had to wait until 12:01. 12:01??? Talk about insulting! He then brought all of us \"legals\" our drinks and made my brother wait empty handed, away from the bar. It was humiliating and this was going to be his first legal drink, in a big irish family this is a pretty big moment for us. When he finally served my brother, the mai thai's were awful, and music was terrible as well. We didn't even finish the drinks and got out of there as quickly as possible. AND, since our bartender was so dilligent as to follow the most extreme laws in serving my 21 year old brother, it's pretty funny that he never checked my 18 year olds cousin's ID and readily handed her a big alcoholic mai thai.

There is no denying the beauty and grace of this grand hotel and the iconic value of the great Tonga Room.  As a stand alone review the Hotel and the Tonga Room are must a must see while in San Francisco.  To understand and appreciate the history of the Tonga Room makes the trip worth while, not to mention the delight in seeing this wonderful Tiki Lounge...it is nothing short of plain and simple fun.  We loved it and the drinks were fantastic.  This is where you should stop!  Have a drink and get out!  DO NOT EAT HERE!  the meals we had were simply awful.  Each dish had chicken in the ingredients and my wife and I found the chicken to be inedible...horrible is too kind!.  We sent our meals back and settled for a side of broccoli.  What was also very troubling, is the fact that our server seemed to be expecting our response suggesting he had sen this scene play out many times before.  We had seen other posts 'warning' not to eat the food.  We had hoped those 'warnings' were exaggerated so took a chance, because we really wanted to take in the entire experience of the Tonga Room.  We certainly wish we had listened to those that dined before us...please listen now to me...do not eat the food.  It is a true shame, because you would image a Hotel with the history, legacy and reputation for quality and service would not allow so many negative reviews about the food in the Tonga Room go unchecked.  Review after review have bad things to say about the food. In fact, I would not eat at this property period, because our food experience in the Tonga Room reflects very poorly on the quality being presented throughout the hotel s I wouldn't take the chance and waste the time and money to eat at the Fairmont Hotel.  As stated, with so many poor reviews surrounding the food in the Tonga Room, I wonder if management simply doesn't care...Management...you need to listen, oh and maybe try the food coming out of the kitchen (Especially with chicken)..I bet that will make you take some action.", "author": "Michael M."}

Like the hotel it's situated in, I love the history and learning about it through old articles framed up around the hallways. The food is like any other asian fusion restaurant, but the service is definitely better. Our waiter was very attentive and accommodating. They didn't skimp on the alcohol on their cocktails. We ordered the Tonga Platter which had the ribs, chicken satay, coconut prawns and fried spring rolls, and also got rice and szechan green beans. The ribs were extra sweet, but I didn't mind that. The prawns were pretty big and the chicken satay was devoured by my husband. The spring rolls were nothing to write home about. We really loved the green beans! They were cooked just right and the sauce was so good over our rice. We'd eat here again if we were staying at the hotel.

The Tonga Room is Tiki to the max, complete with an impressive litany of effects and accessories: mood lighting, giant fake palm trees, big Tiki/\"Easter Island head\" statues, bamboo and wicker everywhere you look, a fake thunderstorm every half-hour or so, and a rectangular moat-like lagoon surrounding the island where the lounge/wedding-style band plays at 8.  It would be one thing to take it all in with a snide snicker at one of our more tacky and un-PC pop-cultural moments, but it's hard to feel OK and non-snobby about that when the aging touristas all around are so clearly enjoying themselves without the aid of irony--and that's a pretty thin source of entertainment anyway.  Not to carp further on what's basically a harmless, doofy experience, but I was a little irked that they automatically charge everyone the 5 or 6 clam cover for the band even if you got there before 8 and happened to stay until they started--a word to the wise.  I also was underwhelmed by the zombie I had here.  Oh, it was strong alright, but really hard to drink on account of what I assume was cheap well rum.  I'm not a huge rum fan to begin with, but I've had drinkable rum & cokes made with good stuff, and this was shudder-inducing.  Take it for what it is--if it's your thing, then you won't find a better faux-Polynesian experience around.  It's not really my scene, though it was fun to go once.", "author": "Michael T."}

I asked the waiter about the menu (which is very limited) and he didnt even know what I was asking about and had to review the menu before he could answer.  I felt very rushed in the beginning. My last complaint would have to be that even if you go to would have to be the $7 cover charge whether you eat there or not.

This hotel bar is a tropical paradise of clueless yuppies, tourists, and desperate, sleazy women in their forties, all drinking overpriced, sugary drinks in novelty glasses, and dancing (if they're lucky) or wistfully watching the dance floor. The most fun part of going to the Tonga room is deciding what to wear, which, in this writer's opinion, should always involve at least one item that is either gold or sequined. Bejewelled, we'll say. Okay, the best part is actually the Tonga Room players, who, as previously described, FLOAT out on a bamboo island and play covers ranging from Beyonce to James Taylor. The Tonga Room players are supposedly the \"longest running gig\" in San Francisco, which is suspect since the lead singer looks like she's about 30... But they are truly fantastic.

I mean, it RAINS every half hour, but the servers act like they're employed by the freaking Four Seasons. The Tonga Room *should* be the height of kitschy goodness, and if the atmosphere lived up to the decor, I'd be willing to forgive its faults-- say, the ridiculous prices, the sub par food, and the fact that a bar serving mostly blended drinks really should avail itself of a decent blender. But the whole affair is marred by the staff's snooty 'tudes. I came here during happy hour for a friend's birthday. The condescension started right at the door with a patronizing host, but soon enough we were a big table of happy twenty-somethings looking to down as many daiquiris (meaning $$$$, at these prices) as the Tonga Room could throw our way. Getting round one took long enough, but after that we were totally ignored. The servers catered to the 60+ crowd and never looked our way again. The other patrons did, though--every time anyone at our table seemed to be having the slightest bit of fun. I mean, come on people. You are not at the yacht club. You are at a tiki bar.

At this point, they seated us in a rather small space.  Luckily, the group of 3 next to us left, and we commandeered their table.  By this point, happy hour was just about over, so we quickly ordered some items.  The drinks were AWFUL.  Mine was bad quality sour mix with a scoop of crushed ice.  No fresh fruit juice or alcohol to be tasted at all.  In fact, only 1 of us could taste any alcohol at all, and unfortunately for him, his drink tasted only of low quality booze.

We ordered the Mai Tai, Blue Hawaii, and the Lava bowl to share, the drinks were strong, and sweet, which I guess they are supposed to be, considering they are tropical drinks, but I think maybe they added alittle too much simple syrup or something cause the drinks left a sweet coating in my mouth.  We had the happy hour buffet for $9  Not worth it!!  Fried Wontons with a tiny bit of meat in the center, veggie eggrolls were ok, bread and a few different dips that were too sweet, there was fruit, greasy noodles, and fried rice.

Unlike everyone around us we were not given food menu's only the drink menu that was already on our table.

It had been years since we had last been there, and with the relatively new renovation, we we're pumped to sample an old San Francisco tradition once again!\nVisually, the Tonga Room is like being on the set of an old Elvis Presley film, which immediately transported us to a Tiki-like, Coco Palms feel; we were swept away by the  Aloha...but that's pretty much where the magic ended.\nWe began by ordering a mixed pupu platter and Mai Tai's. The drinks were served in ceramic totem Tiki glasses, which looked festive with their pineapple wedges and umbrellas, but there was little hint of any rum.  On our first sip, through straws, the bottom layer was warm, not iced..not shaken or stirred...WARM.  The pupu platter looked fun, but the coconut shrimp was stale tasting like old fishy frying oil.  The skewered Satay Chicken was pretty good, the spare ribs were actually very good, probably the best thing on the menu, but the egg roll was again disappointing as it too had a rancid old oil quality to it..not fresh at all and had no other real flavors to speak of.  Even the dipping sauce didn't help.\nMy husband and I chose the Mongolian Beef, and it smelled and looked delicious when it arrived, but there wasn't one piece of meat that wasn't RAW.  I love rare meat, but if this was WOK seared, the wok was barely waved over a flame, totally raw!  The same thing held true for my sister's Lamb Curry...raw.  I don't think any one of the 6 of us had anything we'd ever want to order again.  No one was raving, and our exuberant gaiety present at the start was lost into attempting to get through the meal.\nWe tried two other drinks hoping to get one properly mixed and with some rum, but were sadly disappointed, by the same plastic-y consistency.\nHighlights of course were the intermittent rain storms and little combo band on the water.  they were as we remembered, very entertaining and there were loads of people on the dance floor having a great time.\nSo, bottom line....if you're not fussy about what you eat or drink...you'll get a kick out of it.  To me, though, it's a crying shame not to have at least B+ chefs in the kitchen...AND someone who really knows how to make drinks....I was expecting better, but I'll have to give it a \"C+\" overall..(\"A-\" for Atmosphere, a \"D\" for food and libation).  Had heard for years that the food was below par, but this was worse than any of us expected.\nI love that the Tonga Room is still swinging and looks so wonderfully tropical in a Walt Disney-esque (Pirates of the Caribbean) kind of way, but PLEASE...it could do with some new cooks and maybe a refreshed, more up to date menu!!!

But I loved it! Definately a dining experience!", "author": "Skintight_Chorltonite"}

First off, the place is all about the kitchy Island vibe that starts the minute you enter when the doorman presents you with a colorful cloth lei.  The place is layed out like a tropical rain forest lined with grass tiki huts and after some thunder, lightning, and rain, a boat carrying the band fulls up to present the music. Patrons dance on the deck of an old schooner.  The drinks are strong, yet expensive as I had a couple of potent Mai Thai's which loosened me up to joing in the festivities on the dance floor.  The band was rocking and very good. All and all a very good evening and recommeneded to locals and tourist alike - at least once.  The $7 door charge is added to yor bill and the sticker shock wears off long before the memory of a rocking evening in San Francisco does.", "author": "Nick C."}

Sadly, we were disappointed.  The rain went down well with the kids and the leis even better.  I'd pre-arranged (discretely) for birthday desserts for the two kids and could hardly wait for the excited surprise in their eyes when the desserts arrived.  Unfortunately, the waiter announced that he would be bringing birthday dessert.  Though the 6 year old was distracted by the tiki surroundings, the 9 year old didn't miss a beat so the surprise was ruined.  In case this oblivious waiter hadn't ruined the moment enough, he proceeded to bring one dessert and sing happy birthday to only the 6 year old.  When we pointed out the mistake, he took over 20 minutes to bring the second dessert to the, by now, pouting 9 year old.  Sigh....what's an auntie to do?  Gut-buster or not, I guess it's all about the kids at the Rainforest Cafe.  Thus, I don't recommend the Tonga Room for special occasions.", "author": "K S."}

Sounded simple enough.  Well, turns out, other people do the same thing on Friday nights, and so we had to wait more than half an hour in line....wait...maybe even 45 minutes!  At least they served us some fruity drinks during our wait, and I happened to be dying of thirst, so that gesture brought up my spirits despite the long wait.  When we were finally seated, we walked over to the buffet area....I don't know what I was expecting, but whatever it was, it did not meet me there.  There was so little food choices available, and all the choices were more like mini appetizers, except for the noodles...I liked the noodles, but they were kinda cold....but that's to be expected in a buffet, I suppose.  To match with the ambiance, it was really dark in there, and I could hardly make out what I was getting at first, which probably was a good thing that we couldn't see how little there was to choose from.  I mean, the place itself is really cool...we're talking, indoor pool/water show type of cool....but, dark.  I don't like dark ambiance, personally.  The drinks were expensive, but that was expected, and overall, I would say, this was sooooo NOT worth it.  When I walked out to the bathroom, I saw this HUGE line and thought to myself....man, they're just wasting their time...so not worth it...food-wise.", "author": "W W."}

I was looking forward to great fooed and the rain storm that they do and I was not disappointed.  The mai tai, there signiture drink, was sweet with orange and pineapple juice and a lot of liquor (not enough to tone it down or make me stay away,) but definitely strong for anyone who is used to light drinks.  After pondering the menu, we decided to get the Tonga sampler with chicken satay that was tender, flavorfly marinaded and grilled to perfection with a spicy, zingy, tongue tingling peanuty peanut sauce.  The shataki mushroom spring rolls are crispy and greasless filled with flavorful shataki mushrooms and served with a well balanced sweet and sour sauce that is not too sweet or too sour.  The coconut shrimp are huge, crispy, and greasless with a coconut coated badder with a wonderful tart and sweet mango sauce.  The macadamia nut, almond, and scallion flat bread is soft and chewy, but not soggy or hard with the nuts, honey, and scallions making for a plethora of nutty, sweet, and zesty.  The pork ribs are tender with a wonderful honey and five spices marinade and tangy hoi sim sauce.  Our waitress was very nice and attentive, leaving nothing to chance; always checking back not too often to bother us, but not forgetting about us.  The atmosphere is plain happening with young couples to older people staying in town or comming from work to let their hair down.  I llove the traditional bamboo furniture with the nice tables.  The rain storm makes you feel like you are in Hawaii or the Pacific Islands.  So, for excellent, traditional food and cocktails in a fun, casual, festive, traditional atmosphere at a little more than a moderately priced restaurant with a mock rain storm to match, the Tonga Room cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}

After sitting down, we waited almost 30 minutes for a server to come and take our drink orders (which by the way, were very strong, but tasted nothing like how a mai tai should taste, despite the cute, kitschy mug).  20 minutes later we get our drinks, and are also told that we are about to be charged a $7 cover charge for the band that i couldn't see or hear from where we were sitting.  We stayed anyway, and continued to pay a fortune for incredibly bad service and expensive drinks.  Because we had a bunch of people, we were separated at different tables near by, and when one table decided to leave, they got hit with a bill for the entire group!  (three tables, being served separately). This was about the worst service Ive ever received in SF and I cant imagine how people put up with this. Fun kitschy place to walk in, take a look around, and then leave.", "author": "Anne R."}
