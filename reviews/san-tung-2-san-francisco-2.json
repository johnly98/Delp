They're the (overflow?) sister restaurant to the original which is just next door and which got its start as a neighborhood restaurant before getting its place on the map with its famed chicken wings. \n\nWe rushed over after work on a Friday night worrying about how long the line would be. We'd walked by a couple of times only to see lines that were at least an hour long. We got there at 6.30pm, wrote our name and party size on the wall and... got lucky!\n\nSan Tung next door had closed for renovations so maybe the large parties figured they didn't want to deal with the crushing lines when there was only one place to get their fried chicken fix. \n\nThere were a few groups in front of us but we were the only party of 2 and didn't have to wait more than 15 minutes! By the time we left an hour later, the wait looked like it would take an hour too. Bring on the fried chicken. \n\nThis is definitely a no frills restaurant. The tables weren't particularly clean when we sat down and there was still a piece of fried rice on my chair. \n\nWe got an order of wings and some spicy black bean noodles to share. The black bean noodles appeared in two minutes and had clearly just been tossed in the pre-prepped sauce but they were fine. Could have used more meat but a really large portion and decently textured noodles. My gripe here is that the noodles were too long and needed to be cut in half to be served or at least give us more serving utensils than two spoons!\n\nThe wings were big. An order comes with about 12 pieces of either drumlets or the wing itself - all loaded with meat, deep fried (possibly double fried from the crispiness they got on that skin) and tossed in a sweet Asian sauce. \n\nThe only way to describe the wings is that it went all out for flavor on every dimension. It hit you on the head with how crisp the skin was, how juicy the meat was with every bite, and how over sweet the Asian sauce was that they were drenched in. \n\nIf you want subtle flavors and refined service, go somewhere else. If you want some top notch wings that'll make your doctor cry, go to San Tung II", "author": "Jeremy G."}

You have to write down your name and number of people at your party and just wait for them to call you.

Came in on Sunday night around 8pm and we waited about 40 min, even with half the people before us having left.\n\nSo overall solid food, but I don't think anything really wowed me. We tried the green bean, the original crispy chicken and the black bean noodles. The chicken was probably the best thing, which was fried very well and came out crispy and piping hot. The sauce was good, but quickly tired out my palate with its sweetness and tanginess. Not really very spicy at all. I felt like I could only eat two before I needed something else for a bit of contrast. Unfortunately though, the sauce on the green beans had a very similar taste profile and black bean noodles, while different, definitely still had a significant sweetness component to the taste. Everything on its own was solid, but nothing made me think \"I would want to order this again\". 3.5 for overall experience, rounded up to 4 because we mightttt have somewhat brought that on ourselves with sub-optimal meal composition choices.", "author": "Edward R."}

San Tung #2 (and #1) is anything but. \n\nBefore the wings...\n- Put our table of 4 on the whiteboard, and there were probably 8-10 parties before us. We were hopeful.\n- 45 minutes later, barely any names before us got crossed off. Why is everyone eating so slowly??\n- We went to walk around. There's nothing to see. No bars for a drink to pass the time either. \n- 1.5 hours later, we're getting pretty hangry and so are the others in line.\n- They tell us there's only 10 orders of wings left (!). This is at 7:30pm on a Saturday night. I don't understand. We discuss our order strategy and secretly hope the 2 parties before us are not Hooters Wing Eating Champions. \n- As a result of boredom and hangriness, we scrutinized their table operations. Much space is wasted and you're definitely at an advantage if you're a 2-person party.\n- We finally got called! We sit down and order right away. The food came out REALLY fast.\n\nAfter the wings...\n- The wings were just the right amount of crisp, spice, and sweet. Definitely a lot of sugar but so delicious and worth the wait. Happy gal right here.\n- The black bean noodles (portion was HUGE) and string beans were really good as well. I'll definitely get these again when I come back. The mongolian beef was average.\n- Apparently they never freeze their wings and want to make sure their wings are fresh everyday. \n- Must go to bathroom to wash sticky hands but there's only 1 bathroom again. All I want to do is wash my hands.\n\nAggghhhh. Btw, these wings were so good even when I devoured them cold and soggy straight out of the fridge. Not sure what was in them, but I'm addicted to San Tung crack wings.", "author": "Sally L."}

So finally, I decided it's a sin for me to live here any longer, and not know what the hype is about. \n\nLet's start with the good stuff, and what people are probably snooping review after review for. THE WINGS. Keep in mind there are two types of wings, the wet and dry fried. I've heard the dry fried is the way to go. To be honest, they were good, but it didn't blow my pants off like it did for some people. Would I order them again? Yes I would. Would I go out of my way for them? no. We also ordered the black bean noodles (meh, 2/5,) honey walnut prawns (good! 4/5,) and the garlic green beans, which were okay as well. Overall the food was okay. but to be really honest, it doesn't stand out from the hundreds of Chinese restaurants all over the city.", "author": "Maggie L."}

If you are going to eat here, definitely go only if you want the wings!\n\nSan Tung has two resturants next to each other, and this is the smaller of the two resturants. San Tung 2 offers basically the same food, except one item in which I can't quite remember (dumplings?), and is mostly used as a spill over for the main one since the restaurant is so popular and lines are always piling up. If you need to get something quick or are really hungry, this is probably not the move since you are going to have to expect a decent wait. Definitely go either really early or close to closing to avoid a wait. I went close to closing on a Sunday night and waited maybe 30-40 minutes. \n\nWINGS - by far the best thing they offer here. If you aren't coming for the wings, I'd say you probably shouldn't eat here since this is what they are known for and is by far their best item. Don't see the point in waiting for fried rice or other more generic dishes that you could get at other Chinese resturants without enduring such long lines. Eaten fresh, these are amazing. Great crispy texture with a sweet glazey touch that offers a unique twist and flavor. The wings are also slightly spicy, but I don't remember them being too hot. Make sure you enjoy these while they're piping hot.\n\nSTRING BEANS - Crunchy texture that offers are good veggie dish to complement the wings. This would definitely be my go-to veggie option every time I come here. \n\nBLACK BEAN NOODLE - Not too much to say on this one, I guess it was decent and what you expect from zha jian mian, but perhaps the noodles were a bit mushy. Still decent overall, but nowhere near as good as the wings. I think partially I enjoyed these more as well because I was so hungry after waiting a long time and this was the first thing that came out the kitchen.\n\nCome on a day when you aren't rushed and patiently wait it out a least once for the wings!", "author": "Derek Y."}

Hint, hint: put your name down on both waitlists, but if you have a party of 2-4, you're way more likely to get a seat at San Tung 2.\n\nWalking through the entirety of SFMOMA left me with a hankering for those syrupy-sweet chicken wings. I was so thankful that it only took us 15 minutes to get seated -- on a Saturday, no less. The service was snappy, within a few minutes of sitting down, our host came over and took our orders. I apparently get the same thing every time: a plate of beef chow mein and their signature dry fried wings to split. At $20, this is a steal for a filling and meaty dinner in the city.\n\nFYI, you will burn your fingertips and tongue on that juicy, freshly fried chicken. And no, waiting doesn't help. Not when the plump drumettes and wings they use are insulated by a glorious waterfall of slightly spicy sauce. You'll do yourself well to just bite into it and live with the pain. Remember, pain is beauty, and beauty is San Tung's wings. Keep your eye on the bathroom door in the back, though, and make a run for it when it's empty so you can wash your blistered hands. There's only one, so a line forms quickly.\n\nBeef chow mein is your average deal, wet and chock full of minced garlic. They use larger slices of beef than I'm used to seeing, along with a medley of zucchini, celery, cabbage, bean sprouts, and carrots. It's a good way to get someone to eat their vegetables.\n\nI wouldn't say I come to San Tung 1 or 2 for a bountiful medley of Chinese food, but I would say I come here because I know the dishes I eat here are reliable and tasty.

San Tung 2 seemingly has a smaller menu than the original ST. I tried to order the veggie mu shu and veganizing it like I usually do at ST, but the waiter was not having it. He literally was like \"no, we can't do that\", so I had to find something else to eat. They also ran out of veggie potstickers, so that was pretty disappointing.\n\nI ended up getting the mixed veggies and doubled checked that it didn't have any animal products used, including oyster/fish sauces.The sauce was garlicky deliciousness. I really enjoyed the veggies and how *healthy* I felt after eating a whole plate of them. I would recommend this dish to people who want to feel like you just ate a salad without actually eating a salad.

The dry fried chicken wings here are killer. Normally at a Chinese restaurant they have 100+ things on the menu, lol. You're hoping that at least a few of the entrees are spectacular. The fried chicken wings meet that criteria. The other entree that looks quite interesting is the black bean noodle dish with shrimp and calamari. I didn't order it this time around, but I could see it was a popular dish. All I can say is I'm glad I've found a couple of Chinese restaurants that do some things extremely well. \"Dumpling Kitchen\" with their Shanghai fried dumplings and now \"San Tung\" with their Dry wings. \n\nIf you haven't tried their wings, you need to make the effort. Again, this is one on those restaurants where the best time to come is during the weekday in the afternoon, if you can. Otherwise, you'll be waiting in a long line.\n\nAs a side note, there was something about the restaurant that generated some good vibes. They have a lot of staff, making sure the customers are happy.

Go early to put your name down or go to San Tung 2 to expedite the wait time.

Again another clue to let you know you're in a good spot.\n\nFood**\nDry-fried wings- (5/5) please do yourself a favor and order this item if nothing else. Sweet sticky slightly spicy sauce. My wife was even playing with her chopstick with the left over sauce and kept eating the sauce saying how it's a nice lollipop. For you non spicy eaters don't be turned off from the chili icon, trust me it wouldn't be as good without that tiny spiciness. \nHoney Walnut Shrimp- (5/5) tasted a lot of versions of this in other restaurants, this took the basics and just did them perfectly. Honey glazed walnuts were not to hard, not sticking to your teeth when chomping down on them. Shrimp coating was still slightly crunchy not soggy. Mayonnaise sauce had the right amount of sweetness. \n\nOverall, if you don't want the hassle of Chinatown parking; and actually if you just want good Americanized Chinese food, come here. But be warned after eating here your local Chinese restaurant around the corner from home is gonna look feel like a McDonald's $1 hamburger compared to a In-N-Out double double. \n\nKeep up the good work San Tung.", "author": "Adel O."}

There is always a good crowd waiting for a seat, and the sign-up white board is always full.\n\nLet's be honest. You heard about their chicken. You came here for the chicken. You're waiting in the line for the chicken? Hahahaha. Don't! The San Tung 2 that is immediately to the right of San Tung is owned by the same owner, and serves the same exact chicken!!!!!!! Talking to the staff, they only mention that it's a smaller menu: but like I said, you came here for the chicken. It's on the menu. Get your dry fried chicken wings and go about your day.\n\nNow let's talk about the chicken. I love you. You'll love it. Just get it! The sauce is soooooo thick and sticky to the point where touching my chopsticks after the 3rd or 4th wing feels a little gross. The thick sauce is what really makes the wing, but the crisp skin mixed with the sauce makes me want to give this place 6 stars. I had many wings in my life, and nothing compares to this.

This was about 1.5 hour wait. \n\nFood: 5/5 - As for the food at San Tung 2, they ran out of potstickers & thankfully we ordered the original spicy chicken wings before they ran out as well.

Also, the wait time is significant shorter the smaller your party is. If you're coming with a large party, expect a long wait time. San Tung 2 is also much smaller in spacing compared to the OG restaurant. It also has a much more modernized look, feel, and environment compared to the traditional look of OG San Tung. San Tung 2 is a lot more hip and vibrantly colored which attracts a lot more of the younger generations in to enjoy their fried chicken. \n\nTheir fried chicken definitely lives up to it's name.

When we questioned it, we were given no answer as to what it was. They took our check back, told us a significantly lower price to our surprise and took our money. When they were ringing up our check at the register, we heard the male waiter (our original waiter who gave us the check), arguing that the price was right. Money came back to us higher than what we were told with once again no explanation. We didn't even have the ticket to check what our costs was. Frustrated and tired (we've had a long day) we weren't going to fight over money as they didn't appear to be in the bests of moods and left. While we do appreciate the hard work by the workers and chefs in the back, we do not appreciate dishonesty. A disappointing experience.

And let me tell you, they are finger-licking good. \n\nSan Tung has two locations which just happens to be conveniently right next to each other. I've been to both locations and can guarantee you that the way the food taste and is prepped is no different at all, or at least I don't find anything different between the two. The only difference is that the second location (here) has a smaller menu, but all the popular picks are served here as well. The second location tends to have a shorter wait as well, perhaps because many believe the original location is better or they want to eat at the \"original\" place. Whatever it may be, take my advice, if the wait at the original location is long as hell, make your way over to the second and place your name down. Make sure that you are in reachable distance to the restaurants because they will call out names off the list and if you're not there, they may possible cross your name off and for sure will give your table away to someone else.\n\nSo the wings... yes, they are delicious. They are saucy and sweet and tangy and crunchy and just all around amazing! I have friends who would each order their own plate (which comes with 12 wings) and finish an order all by themselves. I can tell you that you're not going to find wings like these anywhere else. Definitely get yourself an order! Literally one time this guy walked past my table and said to me, \"man what do they put in these chicken wings, must be crack or something\" LOL\n\nThe green beans are also amazing! They're stir fried with ginger, loads of garlic, and with a mild sweet sauce. I get super addicted to these, can't stop eating them... they are good and I highly recommend an order of these as well.\n\nThe last time my boyfriend and I came, we also got an order of their handmade three deluxe spicy noodles. It came with a variety of seafood and the sauce was spicy, but it wasn't too bad.. the heat level was good, you are still able to enjoy the noodles. Fresh handmade noodles says it all, it had an amazing texture - just the perfect amount of chewiness. The sauce was just okay to me, not sure if this is something I'd order again. Their black bean noodles are also a very popular choice and I had it a while back but I didn't find anything too special with those. \n\nParking can be hard to find, it's all street parking like everywhere else in SF so just keep in mind that you may need to walk a block or a few to the restaurant. \n\nThe service varies, sometimes it's good and sometimes it's mediocre, and sometimes you can feel neglected. They get very busy so I understand, but I let that slide because the wings are to die for! I always rave about this place to everyone I know and anytime someone brings up SF, I'm always talking about San Tung because it's just that good.\n\nDo not hesitate, come to San Tung!

If you love flavorful wings, go and get them! (their other Chinese food is a meh from me though, I'd just focus on their wings instead)\n\nOriginal Dry Fried Chicken Wings ($11.50 for 12 wings)- Okay, admittedly they did live up to the hype EVERYONE was fawning over. My roommate RAVED about them for ages and I have to admit, my standards for their wings was pretty high and I didn't really want to buy into the hype, but I finally caved so my roommate would stop bothering me.\n\nI was shocked at how much I liked their dry wings. They're literally packed with so much intensive delicious flavor I was surprised to see how much I dug into them, especially as a person who doesn't like to get their fingers dirty for food.\nThey're sticky, but have a nice crisp texture to it, and their magical sauce that they pair with the wings is amazing. It has a nice heat to it, and the mixture of garlic, ginger, and peppers was just right. I'd definitely come here for their wings again. And I mean at around a dollar a wing??? It's priced so right here. Definitely a messy food but the flavor is so worth the mess.\n\nPork Fried Rice- ($7.75) Honestly probably one of the most flavorless fried rices I've ever had. If the Chicken wings didn't come after the fried rice, I definitely would have given this place a solid 2 solely on their fried rice. Maybe it was an off day but it literally tasted like sour salt and rice was mixed together. The pork really lacked flavor. Not impressed and I'd pass.\n\nGreen Beans- Mmm these were okay. Though it's not the best Chinese cooked styled green beans I've had, these were decent and I wouldn't mind picking them up again to help mellow out the intensity of the wings. Decent item on the menu, but I mean nothing to write home about.\n\nAlso like everyone complains, I mean their location isn't disgusting, but it's also not the cleanest place in the world. Their bathroom is kinda dingy but to be fair I've been in a lot worse. I'd give them like a deflated 3/5 for cleanlieness. Also the waiters here seem fine but if you need help you need to wave them down if you need anything. Expect less than superb service if the line is long or you see a lot of customers here.\n\nI feel like overall a lot of people mostly come for their wings, and yeah while I do agree that they're amazing, their other food so far isn't really selling it to me. I'd rate San Tung a flat 4, and that's solely bc the chicken wings are carrying them. Based on their other foods I wasn't that impressed nor would I go out of my way to recommend else besides their wings. I'd definitely come back here for their iconic wings though!", "author": "Allison O."}

We got their popular original dry fried chicken, the spicy black bean noodles, their salt & pepper chicken, string beans, and fried rice. We didn't finish everything but we just took the rest home. So I really enjoyed the chicken and I can see why its so hyped! It was super juicy and full of flavor. We really liked the string beans as well! It wasn't too salty and it was quite addicting.

In regards to these two menus, they look very similar (except San Tung 2 didn't have dumplings the night I came here).  \n\n* Original Dry Fried Chicken *\nDon't get me wrong, fried chicken (or anything for that matter) is damn good. The chicken here was good and flavorful, but nothing special to me. I personally like my fried chicken crisp on the outside while being moist and tender on the inside. I didn't think that this fried chicken was worth the hype of this restaurant. \n\n* Hot Braised Chicken *\nI liked this fried chicken dish more than the original dry fried one because the sauce makes the meat a lot more moist without causing the chicken to lose its crisp skin. As someone who enjoys spicy food, I didn't think the sauce was crazy hot. It gave the chicken a nice flavorful kick.\n\n* Dried Saut\u00e9ed String Beans *\nIf I were to come to San Tung again it would be to just get this dish. The beans were oh so flavorful with a nice garlic taste to it and it still had a crunch to it in each bite (soggy beans are a nightmare).

We decided to be special and order the Peanut Sauce Noodles. The Dry Fried Chicken was just so good. I mean EVERYTHING about it was delicious AND it came out pretty fast (less than 10 minutes). The Noodles with Peanut Sauce was pretty tasty as well but it took quite awhile (15 extra minutes). It was kind of hard to eat because they didn't cut the noodles up so they were super duper long (ask to have it cut at least twice in the back?). The description for the peanut sauce also says \"spicy\" but it was not spicy AT ALL so don't worry if you can't eat spicy foods.

I could literally eat a whole order of these myself but it is nice to share so that you can also try the other things on the menu. These are similar to Korean soy garlic chicken (sweet) with a bit of spice from the red peppers.

Doesn't come with any special dumpling sauce so make your own with the soy sauce and vinegar provided or just dip it in the dry fried chicken sauce.\n\nOther favorites include their noodles such as black bean noodles or the peanut sauce noodles.

Everything was prepared well and came out piping hot which was awesome. Out of the meal I liked the dry fried stuff the most I'd say, but the hot n sour soup being a bit different ingredients wise was a nice change. The three delights was interesting, but certainly not the star of the place. Might be a bit sweet to some because of the sauce but you can scoop some off or just grab the ones at the top if you want it not as sweet in this case. \n\nI'd definitely come back again just to try some of the other dishes to see if there are other dishes I'd want to return to.", "author": "David C."}

The wait was pretty long, and you can see inside the place is owned/operated by a family who work very hard to serve the huge crowd of customers. The food is AWESOME especially the wings. Every table there we see wings, so definitely get the wings. They taste a little spicy and sweet, with a crunchy crust, which is different from anything I've tasted before and totally AWESOME.\n\nWe also got the black bean sauce noodles. Note that this is NOT jangjangmyung--it's different kind of dish. BUT it is actually way better in terms of taste. Lots of calamari inside, and the sauce sticks to the noodles. Definitely worth getting it--still dreaming about it right now.\n\nThe wait staff (family) are really nice.

San Tung 2 is literally an extension of San Tung 1. It's not really a whole new location. They are next door to each other and when they open, you get into one line, then they fill up the first restaurant up and when that gets full, that's when they'll start dispersing people into the second side. It also seems like they disperse depending on party size since san tung #2 is smaller, theyll seat smaller parties where as if you have a larger group, they'll have to fit you in the first location. However since it is the same place, you can rest assured you are going to be getting the same delicious chicken!!!!\n\nYou can't go wrong with their signature chicken. They serve it either dry or wet. \"Dry\" is a little misleading because it's not really dry. They are both saucy, it's just the wet is extraaaaaa saucy and a little more gingery and sweeter since it's sitting in that delicious sauce. \n\nAside from the chicken, they also serve a number of other dishes that are always consistently good! I love the moo shu they have! It's a simple dish that you wrap with something reminiscent to a crepe. Yum!

I did not understand what was so special about this place. Perhaps, the original one next door made that much of a difference ..? The second location next door had similar menus but a few differences here and there. The service was what you would typically expect in a Chinese restaurant but it was just even slower due to the amount of people waiting and the high turnover. But I don't get it, if you're a busy place, there should be more staff on the floor especially on the weekends. The two servers were young, nice, spoke English but not very quick but you can't really blame them, it was packed. \n\nIt was my first time at San Tung and I had no previous experience to compare it to but I guess this place is just too hyped up. The chicken was just ordinary and it was really nothing special. Actually thought it was too saucy. The hot and sour soup, string beans and black bean noodles were just very ordinary.

I've tried both San Tung #1 and San Tung #2 and they serve the SAME Original Dry Fried Chicken. The main difference is that San Tung 2 has a smaller menu. Therefore, if you're only there for the chicken, just go to San Tung #2, where the wait is a lot shorter! But there's no free kimchi at San Tung #2... so if that's a deal breaker for some of you..\n\nThe Original Dry Fried Chicken is anything but dry - they have the perfect amount of juicy, spice, and crispiness. Those roasted red peppers are so good with the wings! Each plate comes with 12 pieces, perfect to share between 3-4 people. It's definitely one of my top 5 places to get chicken wings. I hope they make their way down to LA! Of course, don't forget to order some vegetable dishes to clean your palate in between every few wings.

Our takeout was ready in 10 minutes (one order of chicken wings with approximately 10 pieces came to $13.50). The box came with a lot of napkins as well, which were necessary since it was a messy job eating them! \n\nThe chicken wings themselves were very good. They were very fried and crispy, and a good size with a lot of meat on the bone. I thought there was a bit too much sauce, and the sauce was a little too sweet. However, overall I was very satisfied. Spiciness is mild. Definitely one of the better fried chicken wings I have had, although I still think Bonchon soy and garlic wings take the cake for the best wings.", "author": "Amy C."}

If your tax is XX.93 they will charge you XX.95 they don't tell you that though, But they gladly let you know that 18% gratuity will be added for a party of 5 or more. How rude is that?

Chicken here is not HYPE, it's the real deal. \n\nYes, I had my doubts. Why would anyone settle for #2 when they could go for #1? San Tung #2 shares the same exact same kitchen as the original. I asked the waiter why on earth would nobody come over to the sister restaurant and he shrugged. The menu was almost identical. Smaller, but come on. The wings are what we really care about. Plus no wait? Priceless. \n\nOk, let's talk wings. I've had a good number of wings in my lifetime. These wings can I dare say were....orgasmic. Hot and crispy on the outside, but moist inside. Then drenched in a hot, sticky, sweet sauce that got all over my mouth. OH YEAH. Food porn at it's best. Finger lickin' good. \n\nThe downside to this place, there were noodles EVERYWHERE on the floor. I was wearing my new boots and tried not to get that stuff stuck on the soles of my shoes. But hey, the dirtier the better right? \n\nPro Tip: Why wait for a ridiculously long time for the original, when you can wait NOTHING and eat the same thing? Sure, the menu is smaller. But when you come to San Tung, you just want the wings. Trust me. And maybe the garlic string beans. Ah yes, those were a winner too.", "author": "Jen P."}

You can play your odds and write names down at both San Tungs, but you're still looking at 30-60 minutes for a table at normal eating hours. But it's worth it. \n\nThe two San Tungs share recipes, and not sure if it's been confirmed, but might share a kitchen too. It's uber popular, and while it's a tough sell as perfect food - it will always be consistently good. \n\nOf course, dried fried chicken is a must after standing for so damn long. We actually like the diced more than boned, but try both! We're also fans of the dried friend flounder (get it in the same sauce as the chicken), the black bean noodles, and the three deluxe spicy noodles. \n\nVegetable dishes (pretty much garlic + [insert vegetable here]) and soups are good complements, and you probably just shouldn't overload on fried chicken (though we do), but nothing that tastes different than what you'd find at any other restaurant featuring Northern Chinese food. All in all, San Tung is definitely in the upper echelon of comfort food and we will be back every few months to wait by their doors encouraging waitresses to not call names more than twice. \n\nOne more thing: you won't be seated until your whole party is there, so either fake it and get dirty looks or give your friends a heads up so they don't keep you waiting longer.", "author": "Mo B."}

They are crispy wings that are dripping in a sweet and spicy super sticky sauce... The portion size is pretty big too so I think they are a pretty good value. \n\nI also really enjoy the pork dumplings here, mainly because they have a hint of gingery flavor. The tables have vinegar so it's easy to make a nice dumpling dipping sauce! Additional side orders that are enjoyable are the green beans and mushu pork - these are just safe always-good sides I think.\n\nThe black bean noodles here are kind of weird to me and seem more similar to the Korean style. The sauce is starchy with chunks of veg/protein. I personally would not re-order. \n\nSan Tung 1 currently has terrible health code ratings and I don't understand why it doesn't transfer to San Tung 2... But I try not to think about that.

Had to settle for San Tung #2. \nEveryone has their own preference when it comes to chicken wings. Some folks like the expensive, organic, Michelin-star quality chicken wings. While other people are perfectly happy with the fried chicken they get at their local KFC. Me? I'm somewhere in the middle. While I'm no expert on chicken wings, I have to say their world famous chicken wings definitely live up to the hype at a very affordable price. Crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside, and the sauce tastes magically delicious. I'll say it's pretty on par with the Bonchon chicken wings you can get around the bay area.\n\nBesides the wings, also tried the black bean sauce noodle, beef chow mein and shredded pork with jalapenos. The quantity is a lot - we're a party of 3 and we can barely finish it. Quality is ok. Definitely not the best chow mein or shredded pork or black bean noodle dish I had, but it's decent. All of the dishes (besides the chicken wings) are surprisingly light in favor. \n\nWould definitely come back for the chicken wings.

We ended up going to San Tung 2.\n\nWe ordered the black bean noodles and while it came pretty quickly, the black bean sauce wasn't too flavorful. You can tell it lacked the traditional ingredients to the black bean noodles--the grounded pork, mini potato cubes, lots of onions, and lots of sliced zucchinis. Instead it had shrimp, calamari, a few big potato cubes which I thought was pork belly (DARN), pork, some onions, and some zucchinis. Of course, I didn't have high expectations for this dish. The main dish to really rave about is their...\n\nORIGINAL DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS. \nThe name itself is very deceiving for it is literally drenched in a honey, sweet, gingery, and savory sauce. The wings took a while to come, but once it was placed at our table, we knew we made the right choice of coming here. That beautiful glisten makes our mouth water and eat bite was crispy and hot. The sauce was so flavorful--like MSG/Umami in each bite. They overload the sauce with honey, causing a nice thick consistency of the sauce.

After being seated, your order is quickly taken and food comes out quickly as well. I never felt like I was waiting for the waiter to come by or for food to come out.

The menu is smaller than the original, but it contains all the important menu items from the original like the dried fried chicken wings. They are pretty quick with their service, like the original. They attend to you and serve the food pretty quickly. I feel like the service here is better than the original. They servers are nicer and more attentive. The servers are the original just come take your order and bring whatever you need, they always seem to be in a hurry.\n\nThe best dried fried chicken wings EVER! The hype is definitely real. Honestly there are other places where the chicken wings are crispier or you have more flavor options, but nothing beats this, especially for the price too. They only have one type of sauce which is a house special, but it is absolutely phenomenal. It is the right amount of sweetness and tanginess that allows you to keep eating the chicken wings without getting tired of the flavor! There are a lot of flavors out there that are delicious, but get a bit too much after a while. With these wings I can chow down on a huge amount and eat it again the NEXT day. The wings are decently sized too, so you're definitely getting every bang for your buck. These are definitely the best things on the menu. I would make an hour drive out to SF just to eat these wings and go back home. This is what makes this restaurant a 5 star for me. You cannot get this anywhere else. \n\nThe string beans is also really delicious here. They give you a LOT too, it is definitely something you can share. They sautee it in a sauce that is similar to soy sauce but slightly different as well. It is a little bit less salty, but adds a lot of flavor to the string beans. It has a hint of sweetness to it as well. They are definitely a nice counter part to the wings.\n\nI have tried two different noodles, the black bean and the peanut sauce. The black bean is hands down so much better than the peanut sauce. The peanut sauce is not super flavorful, it tastes quite bland. The noodles are not dry, but the sauce just has no taste to it. I do appreciate that they have meat and veggies in it, but I would definitely not order it again. The black bean has a TON of flavor. They give you a LOT so you will definitely have leftovers. The noodles are soaked in the black bean sauce so you are getting a punch of flavor in each bite. I would order this again. I would like to try the dry black bean noodles too!\n\nThe honey walnut shrimp was very reminiscent of when I was younger and attended weddings at the big banquet halls and they served this dish. It is flavored very well and the shrimp pieces are actually decently sized. I had imagined they were going to be the baby shrimps. I would order it again, but not every time. I don't think that it is worth it for the money, it is a little bit pricey and you don't get too many pieces of shrimp with it.", "author": "Michelle B."}

It took them a while to bring things we asked for and even for the check. Remember I said it was a long wait, could this be because of service? After a several attempts to get a waiter/waitress, my niece's roommate got up and got the togo containers herself. We were the back table near it. They saw us and didn't say anything, so I guess it happens often. \n\nI would go back but I would definitely not go starving (grab a small bite or snack while your waiting).", "author": "Nazarene L."}

Dry fried chicken is pretty much all you need to know here.\n\nI've been wanting to try San Tung for ages, but the first two times we came by, they happened to be closed for an event/away on vacation! Third time's the charm - they were finally open tonight.\n\nI came in a group of 3 at about 7 pm on a Saturday, and both San Tungs (the original and this one, #2, are right next door to each other - and likely share a kitchen) were popping. But this one was slightly less busy, so I put my name on the list. We waited about 20 or so minutes - not too bad! We ordered almost immediately, and the food came out super fast, which was a pleasant surprise.\n\nWe ordered 4 dishes to share:\n\nDRY FRIED CHICKEN (duh): Amazing. Worth the wait! Sticky and crunchy and sweet and spicy and yuuuummmyyyyy. Obviously, order this!\n\nDRIED SAUTEED STRING BEANS: Surprisingly sweet, but quite good!\n\nDELUXE SOUP NOODLES: Seafood and beef with homemade noodles in a super comforting and thick egg broth. I thoroughly enjoyed this, but it wasn't quite as flavorful as the other dishes we ordered.\n\nCOMBINATION FRIED RICE: So good, I kept going back for more. It's a pretty standard fried rice, except the pieces of meat and seafood are pretty large, and it seemed butterier (or something; might not have been literally butter) than most take-out type fried rice.\n\nOverall, if you don't mind milling about for a bit while you wait for a table, then you won't be disappointed!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-18", "description": "Best chicken wings in the Bay Area. Yes, I said it and I'm sticking by it. If you love chicken wings, then San Tung is a must try. It's so good that they opened a second location right next to the first one! If that doesn't tell you something, then I don't know what else would convince you.\n\nThere's a misconception that there's a difference between the two restaurants. I'm guilty of thinking this too, but please be advised that the chicken wings are the same! The only things that may be a difference are that the second location may not serve the dumplings, potstickers, and kimchi. There was a sign outside that said this, but I'm not sure if it's a permanent thing or if they just ran out for the day.\n\nWe arrived on a Sunday almost right when they opened (5pm). There were about 7+ parties before us at the original location, so we walked next door and saw there was no wait. We were seated right away and given waters all around. We ordered 2 orders of the Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings, string beans, and the black bean noodles. We were so hungry that we started eating whatever arrived to the table first. (The order was string beans, noodles, then the chicken). String beans were crunchy and coated well with the sauce. The black bean noodles were so-so. We ended up adding a little bit of salt and sriracha to it and it made all the difference, in our opinion. The chicken speaks for itself. It was so hot that we had to wait a bit until we got to eat it, so that's how you know it was freshly made. It doesn't leave you with that heavy, sick feeling in your stomach after eating, which is a huge plus. It's a must try and I'll let you be the judge for yourself.\n\nLocated in SF, parking can get so tricky. Be prepared to drive around for a while, unless you get lucky and find someone leaving as you happen to drive by. But I promise that it's worth it and the wings will have you and your group planning for your next San Tung food trip.", "author": "Mia T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-08", "description": "If you have never heard of San Tung, you're missing out. Especially if you're into chicken wings. The most amazing and delicious chicken wings that you've ever tasted? I think San Tung nails that description with their original dry-fried chicken wings. \n\nSo if you've never heard of San Tung, let me enlighten you. Chicken wings. People make the drive from all sorts of places just to wait in line and get a taste of these delicious and mouth-watering wings. And because it was such a hit with customers, they opened a second San Tung's next door to the original one. I'm not sure why this one has much lower ratings than the original, but as I've only eaten from San Tung 2 twice AND enjoyed it, I don't know if there's that big of a difference. \n\nThe first time I tried San Tung's, the line was quite long and it was almost closing time. We ended up ordering three orders of the original dry-fried chicken wings and debated on eating it back at my friend's apartment ... or being shameless and eating outside of a liquor store on a public bench. With the AMAZING whiff of sauce from the chicken wings hitting our noses, we knew that we wouldn't last the few blocks so we opted for the latter. Yep. We sat outside, using chop sticks and fingers trying to quickly eat up the chicken wings because they were that good, but also trying to avoid burning our tongues and mouths. We ended up burning our mouths anyway, but because it was so good, we didn't mind. We just wanted to continue eating. Even though the chicken seems pretty lackluster, the moment you eat it with the special sauce, something triggers your taste buds to think, \"no, I've actually never had anything as amazing as this.\" It's not fried to the point of KFC as the chickens are then doused in a sticky sweet sauce that hardens quickly. \n\nSo when I came back to San Tung with my family, the line for the original restaurant was horrendous, but there was no wait at San Tung 2. So ... of course we headed to the second restaurant. \n\nGarlic Green Beans: They're good for a vegetable dish, but honestly it's just a regular green bean dish. You can probably make just as good green beans at home. I wouldn't say they're anything spectacular. \n\nBlack Bean Noodles: My sister originally saw some type of noodle and asked the waitress what it was. The waitress told us it was the black bean noodles, and when it came out, we were pretty disappointed because it wasn't the dish we had originally planned on getting. The black bean noodle dish is light in flavor and pretty unique, but for me - I just thought it was bland and tasteless. There were bits and pieces of meat inside, but personally, wasn't a fan. \n\nRice: You pay by bowl. \n\nOriginal Dry-Fried Chicken Wings: Each order comes with 12 wings, and I don't think you can do half orders, so we had 2 orders of chicken wings. Even though they were that good, we couldn't finish it all and had to force ourselves to eat the remaining few wings. But, I'm glad we had rice to complement the sweet sauce of the chicken wings. The rice allowed us to feel as if we were eating a hearty Chinese dinner. After my family tried these wings for the first time, they agreed with me that it was really good. Something about the way they cook it and douse it with the sauce - it doesn't taste too unhealthy. The chicken is crunchy on the outside with tangy flavor from the sauce seeping in, but upon biting into it, you get mouthfuls of tender chicken. \n\ntl;dr - Yes, I actually wrote detailed paragraphs about how finger-licking good the chicken at San Tung (1&2) really is. If there's a long wait at 1, just head to 2 or order take-out to save time. Original Dry-Fried Chicken Wings is all you need from San Tung's. I don't know if there's ever no line, so it kinda comes down to luck. You can also call in to order for pick-up, but I tried that once and they told me they had run out of chicken wings. Definitely give this place a try if you've never had it. It's worth the visit and you'll leave feeling full and without any regrets.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

We're all here for the chicken wings. Maybe the dumplings. Definitely the green beans. But mostly for the chicken wings. \n\nI often wondered what the difference between the 2 restaurants were. San Tung 2 had been closed while we ate next door at the original location every time I had been there so I never got to try it out until a few weeks ago. We were told it has a smaller menu than next door. They said they dont have the cold dishes available. Fine by me... We were there for the wings and for the string beans. We put our name on the list and were called within half an hour. This was a little past 5pm. They hadn't been open for the evening that long (they open at 5pm for dinner) at the time but both restaurants were packed with long wait times. It helped that there were only 2 of us. We were seated by the window out front on high stools. Right in front of the people looking at the menu taped onto the window. Kinda awkward because everyone could see what we were eating but it was ok. At least we were seated. \n\nWe went with one order of dry fried chicken wings, one order of garlic string beans, seafood soup and some plain rice. All of my focus was on the wings and string beans as that was all I needed. It was just as tasty and delicious as next door. They really are the most crackinest wings in the city. So good. And the garlic string beans, to me, are the perfect compliment to the wings. So tasty and they are pan fried/sauteed in a garlic sauce worth writing home about. It was the perfect early dinner on a Saturday evening.\n\nWings. String beans... all you need. Check, please.", "author": "Chuck D."}

Write your name and number of people in your group on the little whiteboard that's right next to the entrance. They seat by group size rather than going straight down the list (e.g., if a table of two clears up, they'll seat another group of 2).\n\nThe food is great. The chicken wings (I think it's called something something dry fried chicken wings on the menu) are amazing as always. It's similar to Korean style fried chicken wings where the skin isn't super crispy and the wings are covered in a sauce. I love how the wings are just slightly spicy. The skin is PERFECT - still crispy even when covered in the sticky sweet sauce. The meat is perfectly juicy and tender too. I'm from the 626 area and I can honestly say that I've never had chicken wings like this before. Oh yes, also, when you get the wings, be sure to eat them FAST, even though they're piping hot, because that's when they're the BEST and they're freshly made and if you wait, the sauce will caramelize and it won't be as good.\n\nWe didn't order too many other items on the menu as our focus was on the wings (3 plates = 3 dozen wings, yikes). We ordered the green beans, which I liked because they weren't super oily and the crunch is great. We also ordered a veggie + tofu dish which I recommend as well.\n\nThe main drawback is, I think, that there's only one restroom and the lines can get long. People need to wash their hands from the sticky chicken wing sauce!", "author": "Judith C."}

Whoops!\n\nYeah, so if you don't know there's a San Tung 2 right next door. There is usually no wait unless San Tung is over populated and it shifts over. But for a Tuesday night, it was half empty. Both San Tung offer the famous chicken wings and dumplings. However, San Tung 2 always runs out of dumplings and their menu is smaller. \n\nHere's a tip though, order your dumplings from next door as a to go order and they will deliver it to your table. That's boss right there. \n\nSo here's the thing, although it's the exact same food, I still prefer #1. Let's take the chicken wings for example. It was way more sweeter and way more sauce. Secondly, the green beans were also similar in that it was sweet and had lots of sauce. It almost tasted as if they used the same sauce as the chicken wings. Perhaps I ordered the wrong kind because I'm so used to the garlic flavored ones. The green bean dish had so much sauce that it ended up being very \"wet,\" which was a no-no. Lastly, the noodles were very soft and lumpy. You know, when noodles end up being in water for too long and start to sog. Of course it didn't get to that level yet, but as I ate the leftover noodles from that night the next morning, it totally sogged. \n\nI mean, #2 gives your fix but doesn't solve your root problems ya'know.

I left here satisfied after eating my heart's content of greasy goodness, but that said I won't be knocking down the doors to come back anytime soon. The food just doesn't quite meet the hype. \n\nWhen you arrive here, you'll quickly realize that the original San Tung and its next door counterpart serve a pretty similiar menu -- so if you're hungry -- it really comes down to whichever place has the shorter wait. For us, this meant San Tung #2 was the move, and I actually ended up preferring it by the end, as it's basically a slightly less cramped, nicer looking version of the original, plus it has a much shorter wait. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, considering the absurd levels of hype San Tung generates, the food isn't quite as good as advertised, but that said my expectations were also pretty high. The food ain't bad, and it's always fun to fill your taste buds with fried food from a Chinese spot every once in a while. Just be careful not to order too much. Because of the wait, we saw lots of people asking for multiple orders of everything and it didn't end up well. You're going to fill up fast, and this isn't the type of food that keeps well for reheating. \n\nOnto the food:\n\nDRY CHICKEN WINGS - This was the main draw, and I have to say I was a little disappointed. The wings are decent, but for them to be known for them practically around the city didn't make sense to me. I found myself enjoying the wings that were coated in sauce far more than the ones that weren't, so the sauce flavor is certainly good. But other than that, the wings just really didn't do much for me...there's just nothing really special about the chicken itself. Enjoyable, but certainly disappointing. \n\nBLACK BEAN NOODLES - A solid dish with a very unique flavor (still can't quite put my finger on it). Heavy, creamy, a little oily, but the end result is somehow pretty good. A word of caution though: there are a lot of different ingredients thrown into the bowl, including what seemed like potatoes and also some still-to-be-identified seafood. Good...but strange.\n\nPORK FRIED RICE - A classic, but still highly suggested. The fried rice is an especially sound option if you order the black bean noodles, as they compliment each other well. But still, you don't come here for the rice, so a minor victory at best. \n\nOVERALL - I enjoyed my time here, as it's definitely an experience. If you want to try the famous San Tung chicken, definitely stop by and give it a shot. But at the same time, it's necessary to realize what this is...it's basically Chinese fast food in a restaurant setting...which is fine, but 5 star this is not.", "author": "Brian S."}

The location is pretty small, but decently clean. There were about 3 waiters staffed and they were pretty quick about getting things that we needed. So onto the wings! To be completely honest, the wings didn't WOW me. Not really sure if it was because I went to this spot rather than the original San Tung (but I heard they share a kitchen), the wings were too hyped, or I came on an off day. They were just okay.

Pretty good, with perhaps some exceptional dishes.\n\nWe were told by the waiters that this restaurant is the same as its uber popular parent next door except for a smaller menu.  The other place had a swarm of people waiting and there was no wait here, so this is where we ended up.\n\n1. Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings $10.50: Despite the name, these wings are not \"dry\"--they might have been deep fried but they're smothered in a sticky sweet and slightly hot honey-like sauce.  REALLY good.  So good that next to us sat a pair of Caucasian teenagers who only ordered this + rice!  This would be the 2nd best fried chicken wings I've had from a Chinese restaurant, and I've tried many dozens of versions of these.  BTW, there's a lot here, so the price ain't bad for what you get.  10/10.\n\n2. Shrimp and Leek Dumplings $8: These are very well made.  Slightly fancy format--small and cute vs. the larger half moon shapes your mom would make at home.  The skin is tender and not too thick.  For some reason the filling wasn't as shrimp tasting as I thought it would be despite the menu listing only really 2 main fillings--the shrimp and leek.  Feels like there's some kind of filler in there like egg.  You can see in my pictures they're slightly yellowish inside, which isn't really the color of shrimp.  Well, anyway, they taste good no matter what they used inside.  Not the best, but good.  6/10.\n\n3. Beef Soup Noodles $9.50: This one is odd.  We've all had the traditional dark and rich beef noodle soups with stewed beef and sometimes tendons inside.  Well, this is NOT that.  (See my picture!)  The soup is similar to traditional lamb soup--a thicker white soup with preserved cabbage and other stuff mixed in.  The beef is not stewed beef--it's the ultra tenderized type they use for stir fry.  The noodles are not remarkable--not the thick house-made types that the best places use.  I actually do like the soup, which is quite rich and flavorful, but I feel the beef is cheap tasting and it's just not how this type of noodle soup should be made.  5/10.\n\nService: well, the people are very nice and are Americanized so speak English fine.  But it's just totally impossible to get their attention.  I guess it's typical Chinese service for you.\n\nThe wings are a must get.

The peanut noodles we ordered came in a larger bowl than usual. That was a pleasant surprise. But our string beans were undercooked. They had almost that raw snap when you would bite into them and didn't have that nice caramelization on the outside. We debated for a long time whether to send them back and finally did. They came back and were improved, but still not sauteed to our usual liking. That was a bit of a downer. Not sure if that was just an anomaly because we've never had that problem before. Also I'm not sure if they share a kitchen with the original san tung or it is separate? One small thing I noticed was they do not serve kimchi as an appetizer like they do next door.\n\nThe service was pretty bad from beginning to end.

Hop right next door to San Tung #2 - restaurants share the same kitchen and owner, menu is just scaled down to limited options (no kimchee or lunch specials).\n\nBut who cares, because all you really come for at San Tung are the dry fried chicken wings right!? And of course they serve them here as well. They came out pretty fast and tasted just as good as it would've next door. It was smothered with generous amount of sauce, kick of spiciness, hot, fresh and had the perfect crunch into each bite. Mmmm\n\nWe were also able to order hot and sour soup, the small order was perfect to split between two people. The honey walnut prawns were the last thing we ordered and probably my least favorite out of the 3 because it was way too battered. The first two prawns that I ate were pretty good but after that I was kinda over it because it tasted like I was biting into a ball of fried nothing then by the time I'd get to the actual prawn, it was just plain and tasteless. Not sure if it was their fryer, or oil or lower quality from what I'd usually order next door.\n\nBy the time we were done with our meal, I figured we'd probably still be waiting for a table next door. I'd definitely come back to beat the line just for the wings but maybe even order for to-go. The service was pretty bad. I felt almost as if the waiters were scared or avoiding our tables purposely unless they had something to bring over, no checking in to see if we needed anything else or glasses of water until we asked.\n\nIf there wasn't such a long line next door, I'd pass on the #2.", "author": "Georgina G."}

As a heads up.I haven't been to the original ST next door so I can't speak for how ST2 compares.  The original had a wait at around 2PM on a Sunday.  I was just done with a long run in the park, so not wanting to wait, I decided to dive next door to this sister branch instead, which had a couple of empty tables.  \n\nLocation is hard to find parking in.  I happened to be in the park so I simply walked over here without moving my car from Irving and 5th since it already took over half an hour to find that parking spot.  But that's expected for anything within a few blocks of the park.  \n\nThe store itself is slightly smaller than the original, and while not grimy, it ain't clean either (I saw a pile of spilled noodles on the carpet of the table next to me, and there they stayed through the next patron's meal.  Hot.).  \n\nWe ordered 2 noodle dishes, black bean sauce noodle and peanut sauce noodle.  Both servings were fairly large so we took leftovers home from both dishes (add more noodles at home and voila, 2 more meals).  However, I thought they were both a little pricey -- a little under 10 (maybe 9.25?) for each dish.  The noodles themselves were good but didn't blow my mind, I've had better in Chinese places in the Bay Area burbs.\n\nBlack bean sauce noodle -- good in general.  Very saucy, if you are into Korean jjajang sauce.  The sauce had thin sliced beef, the typical zucchini chunks, onion and (surprise!) calamari.  Maybe I wasn't hugely impressed since I do know how to make this stuff myself at home but was hoping that this place could do it better.  \n\nPeanut sauce noodle -- again, very saucy, and rich and spicy.  This one's a heavy dish.  I enjoyed the peanutty-ness and creamy texture of the sauce.  However, I wasn't a big fan of the seafood flavor (there was shrimp and scallop in it, in addition to water chestnut) which stood in odd contrast with the peanut theme.  Don't get me wrong, I love seafood and in particular shrimp and scallop.  Just maybe not necessarily with peanut sauce, which didn't cover the fishiness of seafood as well as other aromatics normally would.  \n\nOverall, it was a fun little lunch in the city at a place that has gotten a lot of hype and coverage, but the food was somewhat underwhelming or not put together as well as I expected.", "author": "Anita T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-09", "description": "San Tung #2 is the old 'Next Door Sweets' that used to offer boba and gelato...but more importantly...was the secret shortcut to San Tung chicken wings. I'm pretty sure they closed down because the wings were more popular than their actual dessert options. \n\nSan Tung #2 is basically the same thing as the original Sun Tung next door. Same owner, same wings you all know and love, and pretty much the same menu (no lunch specials though). San Tung #2 has more of a cafe feel and is a bit smaller with only one banquet table, but they still fit a substantial amount of people. There were probably around 15 well-spaced tables in the restaurant. \n\nTHE ORDER: \n\n1) DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS: Crisp, sweet, hot, and divine as usual. A mandatory order. Period. \n\n2) SPICY BLACK BEAN NOODLES: Saucy, spicy, great noodle texture, and a good amount of pork and veggies mixed in. \n\n3) SAUT\u00c9ED STRING BEANS: Perhaps slightly overcooked as they were a bit wrinkly and soft, but great flavor with a nice sweet sauce. A great vegetable option if you don't like them veggies! \n\nEating at the original San Tung can be stressful; long waits, no-nonsense service, cramped tables, a loud atmosphere, and the general feeling of a rushed dining experience. No one cares though because everyone is really here for the food - or rather just the wings. San Tung #2 however, provided a much more pleasant atmosphere. The service was much better; our waters and cups of tea were refilled multiple times and the bill wasn't thrown in our face before we were finished eating. The decor has a cutesy, modern flare and they have new bowls and plates (which is probably because they just opened), and hefty tea mugs. Everything felt cleaner and was a nice change of pace from the usual chipped tea cups and weathered dinnerware of the original San Tung. \n\nWhich restaurant is better: Original San Tung or San Tung #2? It doesn't matter. They're practically twins and #2 is just an extension. They might as well knock the walls down. The food, at least from what I ordered, tasted similar if not the same. Whichever has the shorter wait time, go for it. If you want better service, perhaps San Tung #2 though.\n\nCame here on Friday at 6pm and there was no wait, but I'm sure that will change as more people discover their grand opening. One of the reasons I don't eat at San Tung very often is I don't want to wait over an hour for a table, but now the wait times will be divided amongst the two restaurants. The crazy lines will be diffused and it will encourage more business as patrons will not have to wait in the cold as long. It's a win-win situation! Excited about the new, or rather revised addition to the block. I'll be back soon!", "author": "Deanna Y."}

San Tung is a Chinese restaurant located in San Francisco, and supposedly has legitimate Chinese food. \n\nAfter my friends picked me up at SFO, we proceeded to go to San Tung. Street parking might be hard to find, so you may have to circle the block a few times. Even at around 8:00 P.M, the original San Tung had a wait, so we went to the one a few stores down, San Tung 2. After comparing menus we figured that it should be the same food. \n\nSan Tung 2 only had young Asian patrons in it, which already set off a red flag. The more older generation Chinese people at a Chinese restaurant the more legitimate it should be!! Anyways, we were sat immediately at a round table and ordered the chicken wings (not shown) that everyone raves about, along with other things. \nFirst of all, I want to say the chicken wings are way over hype. It was decent, but the sauce and the way the chicken was cooked did not exceed any type of standard. I'd rather spend my approximately 10 dollars at buffalo wild wings. \n\nThe best thing we ordered was probably the fried rice, and that wasn't amazingly good either. The other two things were ordered were the Mu Shu Pork and Dried Saut\u00e9ed String Beans. I did not like the Mu Shu pork at all, and the string beans were a bit too over cooked. \n\nMaybe I am being too harsh, but if everyone is going to hype up a restaurant it better live up to standards in my opinion.

The wings are legit. Heard a bunch about how the wings at San Tung are legit, and I agree that they are bomb. A bit spicy, but damn so good. The crunch on them is on point, and the spice was just right. 12 is def. the perfect amount for 2 hungry people. The string beans were meh. It's a huge plate of beans for 2 people, and then flavor on them was just alright. I wasn't like damn these are the best string beans ever. In fact, I only ate a couple.

You'll be in and out much faster then if you try to bother sitting at ST1, espesh if you have a group larger than like 2-3 people.\n\nLastly, the bathroom at this place is a step up from ST1. I'll definitely come back here for more wings in the future.", "author": "Shawn B."}

So, after reading multiple reviews about the two locations having the same chicken wings (but #2 has fewer menu items), we cleverly put our name on both lists.\n\nAbout 20 minutes into waiting, ST#1 announced that they were out of chicken wings.  We then hopped over to #2, and, seeing that we were pretty close to being called, we asked them if they still had wings.  Yes, they said, but #1 had just come over to their kitchen to ask for some wings.  Ohhh no you don't - we haven't been waiting over 30 minutes just to have #1 jack all the wings!\n\nThe waitress asked us where we were on the wait list, and when we said we were next, she told us that yes, there would be enough for us.\n\nUnfortunately, the whole experience was pretty much a let-down.\n\nI didn't love San Tung's chicken wings.\n\nSORRY AMERICA, I LET YOU DOWN.\n\nNot a fan of the sauce flavor, not a fan of the hard-to-crunch-through skin, and definitely not a fan of the wait.\n\nNot a fan of the green beans - too much ginger.\n\nBlack bean noodles were ok, until I tried to reheat them at work the next day and then it started getting funky (especially since there is seafood).  So, if you get these, definitely try to finish them all at the restaurant, because these don't keep well.\n\nHOWEVER.. I am a fan of the shrimp and chive dumplings.  They're plump and juicy and have great flavor.  The pork dumplings were just okay, but seriously I could eat two orders of the shrimp ones by myself.\n\nIs ST (or ST#2) worth the wait?  IMO, no.

Why is there the usual mass of hangry patrons still waiting outside the original San Tung, while #2 remains comparatively empty? What's the difference? Why does it look like a Kwik-E-Mart? Why would a restaurant put \"#2\" in their name? (Doesn't the #2 come after the meal...?)\n\nWell I'm putting your worried, hungry thoughts to rest. San Tung #2 is exactly the same as the original with the following exceptions:\n- wait is shorter (if there is one)\n- they don't serve kimchi\n- they don't offer lunch specials\n- it's quieter and cleaner\n- tackier rainbow light ceiling fixtures\n\nSitting inside the restaurant, you'll most certainly observe hungry, inquisitive people outside, doubtfully reading the window menu and expecting (almost hoping) to find a huge discrepancy that would require compromising the full-fledged San Tung experience. But relish in your own seat, safe from the merciless Sunset chill, knowing that the benefit of the doubt you've given to San Tung #2 shall soon be rewarded with a hot sticky plate of chickeny goodness 40 minutes early. \n\nThe food: I'm not usually impressed with San Tung's (spicy) black bean noodles, but I gave it another shot this time and it did not disappoint. It wasn't spicy in the slightest, BUT the flavor was tasty and caused me to stuff myself to the land of food baby remorse. The string beans were balanced and moist--surprising because most restaurants prepare them too salty and dry them out (just because they're glazed in sauce, doesn't mean they're moist). And the chicken--well, you know the chicken.\n\nIn this lesson in dining, patience is not a virtue--it's a misguided commitment to \"the original restaurant\", perhaps derived from ravenous delirium. It's the same food, people! Save your hungry soul, don't wait in line, and eat at San Tung #2.", "author": "Marina L."}

I'll definitely support the shorter wait because food is king. As long as it tastes the same, the ambiance of a Chinese restaurant does not matter to me.\n\nFOOD: Original dry chicken wings. The only thing you need to know. Got two orders and it is just so good. It's not authentic Chinese as far as I know, but there is nothing else like it and it takes chicken wings to another place. The sauce is this sweet, tangy, garlicy, concoction with a kick of spiciness from the peppers. It is perfect and lingers in your mouth for extended flavor. I believe they prep their chicken with egg whites and deep fry it but regardless, it has perfect texture. It is the perfect type of crispy contrasting the moist tender chicken on the inside. We also ordered the black bean noodles which was also very good. A couple of different proteins engorged in a mildly thick, not too in-your-face black bean sauce. This with the help of soft noodles makes this dish a nice complement to the wings. We also decided to order the garlic eggplant. This was not particularly amazing, as it could use a little more garlic flavor. Still good though.\n\nOverall, if you want the San Tung chicken, come here.

Perfect balance with the spiciness & sourness.\n- Black Bean Noodles with Seafood: My mom who is very picky liked the chewiness of the noodles. We also liked how there were lots of seafood in the dish. The sauce was good too; sweet and salty, but I would go lighter on the sugar.\n- Salt & Pepper Shrimp: Personally we thought this had the shells on. But it was peeled battered shrimp. Nevertheless...they were good. \n- Saut\u00e9ed Garlic String Beans: Still had a good crunch to them. Sauce was good...but like the noodles I would go a little lighter on the sugar next time.\n- Dry Fried Chicken Wings: HANDS DOWN THE BEST CHICKEN WINGS IN THE WORLD! Always consistent.

Then I noticed San Tung #2 next door with signage emphasizing they are the same owner and offer everything that is on San Tung's menu. I gave them a try by writing a name on the wait list to see which restaurant would call us up first for a table. I was initially seated by the waiter, but was told to get up after to seat a bigger party which was out of the ordinary. They then reseated us in about ten minutes at a smaller table. I assumed that they pulled us out since the bigger party would obviously order more food than us. I decided to get the usual Dry Fried Chicken Wings and the Dumplings which were exactly the same as the original San Tung next door. The service here was lacking since I had to get their attention to order, refill water, and to get the check. Would return here if I am in a rush for chicken wings, but would sick with the original restaurant next door since they do not offer lunch specials or kimchi at this restaurant.", "author": "Peter C."}

I was told that San Tung #2 had less options, but served all the same popular dishes, which was all I wanted. \n\nLets start with the food. My party ordered 2 orders of the dry chicken, sauteed green beans, black bean noodles, combination fried rice, and mongolian beef. For some reason, all the food tasted quite similar. Sticky with a very strong flavor.... The dry chicken was pretty good, not going to lie. It had a nice blend of sweet, tangy, and spicy. Only thing I didn't like about it was that it was super sticky. \n\nThen it all went downhill from there. The next thing that came out was the green beans, which came out to be sub par. In fact, it tasted pretty similar to the chicken...which isn't what green beans should taste like. It also seemed like they used the same sauce. Next the black bean noodles came out...I don't even know how to describe this. It had this weird flavor that made most of us cringe. After that, the combination fried rice came out. When the waitress put the plate on the table, I noticed this disturbing strong smell. I took a bite of the rice and it was okay....but then I ate the shrimp. Not only was the texture terrible, but it was spoiled. Spat it out immediately. At this point, everyone was feeling pretty sick. The food just sat in your stomach and it was uncomfortable. The mongolian beef came last. In my first bite, I noticed that they chefs but WAYYY too much baking soda in the meat. For those of you that don't know, many Chinese restaurants put baking soda in the beef to make it more tender. \n\nBy this point we've had enough. What made it worse was the service. Our waitress was extremely rude....there was really only one way to describe her.... We told the manager about our experience and she was able to discount our meal. \n\nI suggest going to the original San Tung. Everyone seemed to be happy there.

My boyfriend wrote his name at the original San Tung and San Tung #2 and waited to see where we would be called into first. After waiting for almost an hour, our friends went inside #2 and noticed someone had erased my boyfriends name on the board (okay WTF?!) We went in and complained about it to the waitress who looked so confused and lost about the situation. She then sat us down at an empty round table away from other patrons. She came back in the next 10 minutes to take our order and as we all finished she repeated everything to make sure things were correct. Our friend reiterated his and his girlfriends order, then the Asian, blond-haired waitress who looked as though she was dressed in gym clothes had the nerve to read back exactly what she had written on her paper again with a NASTY attitude. She gave us the ugliest stare and had the audacity to *ROLL HER FUCKIN EYES* as she turned away to head back in the kitchen. We all looked at each other and said \n\n\"You want a tip...or nah? NAAAAHHH\" \n\nIt's one thing to give your customers attitude but if you plan to roll your eyes and give us a nasty stare-- then make sure it's NOT visible for us to see. After probably 10 minutes or so she came back with our order and luckily we didn't have to interact with her poor customer service attitude and manners.\n\nOur food was good- they offer dry fried chicken wings which is $.50 more than the original San Tung restaurant. I don't get why though if it's the \"same owner\" as stated on their menu. The menu is a lot shorter and they don't offer as much. If all you want is the dry fried wings and you don't want to wait in line at the original restaurant, then #2 is just as good cause the wings taste the same. They do have fried rice, noodles, soup, and vegetables, but choices are limited. Food wise everything was good as well as the portion. Customer service was really where things were bad. The blond-haired Asian waitress has to fix her attitude and the way she approaches her customers. Better yet, she should be trained how to respectfully deal with people.  \n\nP.S. they only accept one paying card to pay for the bill.", "author": "Katelyn F."}

It's a really good appetizer because it comes out pretty quickly. The price is about 10$ a dish and decent portions. The service is usually slow due to the amount of people, so it requires some flagging down. If you come during dinner time, you could easily wait over an hour. Overall, still my favorite wings in sf.

The quality of food and service has gotten quiet worse since then. We liked San Tung 2 for takeout because it was a shorter line and wait with much friendlier staff! What is hilarious is how they operate separately and we only had San Tung original's number for a long time, and San Tung original would always just hangup on us when we asked for San Tung 2! San Tung original was never helpful or friendly. I guess we are lucky to be blessed by their food.\n\nReview on San Tung 2 food. Chicken wings: we never order these here anymore. They don't taste like fresh wings, but rather many times have tasted like about to spoil old frozen wings. While frozen wings are fine, they should still taste fresh. Special Beef: too much sauce and the meat is not fresh tasting also. when someone orders takeout, you do not need to put all the sauce in the to go container, the sauce just completely covers the fried meat in excess and it's gross. Same for all of your dishes when ordered for takeout, string beans, eggplant, and etc... you don't need to include all the sauce and oil that usually goes on the plate because you are putting all of this in a compact container, just think about it! In a nutshell, all the stir-fried dishes are kind of a let down because they really do not care about freshness when we order out from here and we might have gotten sick from here once or twice also. the dumplings are still good, and the noodle soups are meh, oily broths with not much flavor.", "author": "Chen Z."}

If you like #2, you should try \"So.\"", "author": "Lantz G."}

The guy said just a smaller menu. So my gf and I decided to stay and it was amazing.  The drive fried chicken and green beans were mouth watering.  It was our first time there and the food was amazing.  Highly recommended!", "author": "Rashid C."}

It just was not as good, can't really pinpoint why. I say just wait the extra time for a seat next door, it is definitely well worth it!", "author": "Amanda E."}

We got the chicken wings, black bean noodle and shrimp & leek dumpling. man oh man was this meal delicious. The chicken was crispy, not too dry not too saucy. The sauce had a touch of spicy and just overall was the best fried chicken I've ever had, and it was cheap. Their homemade noodles were amazing, it was soft and tasty. There was like potato and squid in it i think. the potato kind of threw me off but overall they were good. The dumplings were good, not too much leek so that it wasn't overpowering the shrimp but enough to go really well together and the skin was good. My meal turned out to be $33.15 and it lasted me and my bf for the dinner the next day as well. The quality for this food especially at a Chinese restaurant was on par and this is a must try if you ever visit SF looking for some great Chinese food and fried chicken.", "author": "Amanda B."}

And if you're not present for your name they swipe it off the list! THANK GOD! Not like the other San Tung lol you gotta play like the maze game on the board to figure out where to sign your name.  (For those who go back and forth to the other San Tung and then get all butt hurt when they cross your name off. You people are annoying lol!) This place gets 3 stars for their customer service, and their food but sucks they don't have sweet and sour shrimp like the other San Tung, but other than that this place is pretty damn good (:", "author": "Gerline R."}

We drove up to San Francisco just for San Tung, like always.  Was taken by surprise to find that San Tung #2 has just opened up right next door (same owner).  #1 had a wait, #2 had availability... was wondering why people would wait when they can go right next door for the same thing.  So we decided to skip the wait and give #2 a try.  #2 location is smaller than the original but it is definitely a lot nicer.  Skeptical walking in but as we saw a familiar face in the kitchen, we were relieved.  We ordered the Dry Original Fried Chicken and were both VERY DISAPPOINTED!  It was very good but not San Tung! We could tell the difference immediately and felt that the drive to SF was not worth it.  Thanks for ruining our day.  Also got the Honey Walnut Shrimp which did not wow us at all either.  We will be sticking to San Tung #1 from now on...", "author": "Tran T."}

The past several times I have come here, there has been a line despite there being many empty tables. Appears understaffed. When I have managed to get a table, staff members have been rude, particularly the younger individuals. Will not bother with sit down in the future.", "author": "Consumer F."}

I've been next door to San Tungs a few times but this was my first time at San Tung 2.  We had a group of 8 people and put our name on both waiting lists and we were called at the same time for both places.  We arrived at 5:30pm and waited about 30 min. on a Sunday night.  San Tung 2 has a calmer vibe than it's sister restaurant next door.  It has nice updated decor and has more space.  We ordered the wet dry fried chicken wings, chicken fried rice, sizzling rice soup, string beans, and noodles with peanut sauce.  The chicken, string beans, and fried rice were the best thing we ordered.  The noodle with peanut sauce was tasty but was a little to much for me.  The food came out quick.  All the servers were really nice and were quick to clear away used dishes at our table.  One of the servers was extremely nice to my young niece and the two quickly became friends.  Thanks for the sweet treat for my niece!  =)", "author": "Leen B."}

The original San Tung right next door was packed and we were hungry and didn't want to wait, so we opted for this place because there was a shorter wait time and because we heard the food wasn't any different. We ordered four entrees for five people, which honestly was a lot and we probably should have ordered less. We had the hot & sour soup, string beans, black bean noodles, and of course the chicken wings. Honestly, I don't know what the hype for the chicken wings is all about. I thought they were decent, but I've had better. They kind of reminded me of mango habanero wings from buffalo wild wings, but not as good.. Or maybe I'm just biased because I love BWW. Anyways, the food was decent but my whole group thought everything tasted so sweet, and not in a good way.. We expected our food to have more flavor, but everything seemed to taste so sugary. Decent food though, and if I came back here I'd probably be coming back for the black bean noodles, not the wings. Mmm carbs..", "author": "Mae F."}

My family and I came here because the main restaurant was on vacation or something. The wait was a bit longer because of the smaller store and since we had 6 people, there was only one table that could fit us and these old timers just wouldn't leave for the longest time! Not the restaurant's fault at all, I was just frustrated. Anyways, we ordered 2 plates of wings, 2 black bean noodles, green beans, mongo beef, and twice cooked pork. Out of everything we ate, I have to say that the noodles were just a huge miss. It seems like they didn't strain the water enough so whatever sauce that was thrown just became soup. as such, the sauce got watered down and the noodles were just not enjoyable. Everything else minus the chicken and green beans were just decent. Wings were good but  I swear not as good as the original. If you're asking 'how can that be?!' well my hunch is that the chef for #2 is not the same chef as #1.", "author": "edward k."}

Which doesn't mean much because all the good items are indeed on this menu. San Tung cooks Northern Chinese food which is generally spicier, robust and oily.  Yes! Like being in the mood for American fried chicken, we had the beautiful chicken wings in honey glaze.  Oh the spice and the sweetness coming together with perfectly fried wings.  We saw a nearby table where all the dudes were eating their own plate of chicken wings!  The steamed dumplings were alright, they didn't quite come together between the filling and the dough.  The potstickers were done right in a larger size than what I usually expect.  We had beef and broccoli for the kid, which was decently done, extremely tender meat, though the sauce was too salty.  The final dish was the noodles in fried bean sauce, a very typical Northern dish.  It's a mild tasting sauce that is blended with thick homemade noodles with squid and zucchini.  Very filling and satisfying meal as usual for this cuisine.", "author": "Eric J."}
