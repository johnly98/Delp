The interior has high ceilings with plaster walls and lighting that will make you feel a little like you are outdoors. Mostly 2 tops that can be arranged to accommodate the necessary number of diners in a group.\nOur server Germano, was very nice and attentive the entire evening. All the service staff were great.\nWe started with the arugula salad, and the beet salad. Both were very good. Neither were large enough to split, as we sometimes like to do when the salad is prior to a larger main course. \nMain courses: \nThe Pappardelle with 'local' wild boar and mushrooms. Not sure where they would find 'local' wild boar in SF... but whatever... This dish was a little flat. Nothing really 'bad' about it, just kinda 'meh'...\nI had the evening special of linguine with rabbit, asparagus and cherry tomatoes. I thought the linguine itself was excellent, and there was an ample amount of rabbit. But, that rabbit was rather overcooked making it dry. \nAll in all, I would have to say the dining experience was just OK.

The host, who I assume is the owner is Italian and extremely friendly and hospitable.

The service was slow but they knew we were waiting and came by enough to update us and even gave us a glass of wine on the house. Additionally I never felt rushed to get out of there and we were able to have good conversation.\n\nFood- 5 stars-Some of the best and most authentic Italian food. We started with the verdure which was grilled excellently and was a nice light starter. I had the tagliolini al funghe with truffles and it was incredible. Sometimes I feel pasta is overpriced for something I could make myself but this was definitely not the case. My sister got the parchadelle which was also nice. \n\nAtmosphere-4 stars- The smell of truffles fills the air. This place is buzzing with life and transports you to another place. It's small and tables are packed in. Our table was near the bathroom which was mildly annoying.\n\nPrice- Not cheap, ran us about $60 each for a shared app, entree, 2 glasses of wine.\n\n\nOverall fantastic intimate Italian.

I came here with the DH, auntie, and two kiddos.  We all really enjoyed Amarena!\n\nWe started with the arugala salad (my oldest proclaimed it the BEST salad ever!) and the burrata.  The vinaigrette on the salad was sooooo good it really made the dish.  It was the perfect blend of sweet/tart/tangy.  The burrata was also very good.  The tomatoes that accompanied the dish, however, were too \"mainstream\" for my taste.\n\nHmmmm... let's see....  What did we have?  I know I had the tagliatelle with mushrooms and the others had the lamb, papparadelle alla cinghale, bucatini, and orecchette.  My tagliatelle was the BEST--everyone said so!  I seriously had to fight my foodie daughter off my plate!  But generally, the pastas were all very well made and their accompanying sauces were tasty and well seasoned.\n\nSo the only weird thing about this place is that the bathroom is tucked into a little corner (not their fault but...) and there is a small table right there with only a sheet separating the table from the bathroom door...

LA is a food mecca into itself and has cuisine representative of nearly every culture within its county limits. However, there are some cuisines in San Francisco that stick out more than LA and for me, its Italian food. \n\nIn searching for Italian (and a last minute reservation on a Friday night), we were able to get a table at Amarena for a group of five. When we arrived, the place was busting with people. The restaurant is within a small house and a small bar in the back. Upon entering, it was noticeably warm inside while it was a conventionally crisp SF nighttime outside. We had a reservation for 8:30 and took a while to get noticed by the host who was seating and deliver wine bottles. We waited about ten minutes to be seated. This was a bit of a turn off and loss of a star for me. Once seated, we perused the menu and decided on a shared appetizer and what our main courses would be. \n\nWe decided on a Burrata with basil and yellow tomato. It was very appetizing and an easy shared plate. For my main entree, I was really craving pasta so I decided on the Linguine also Scoglio, a seafood mix of clams, muscles, prawns, and calamari in a light tomato sauce. The pasta was handmade and cooked al dente. The tomato sauce had a touch of spice that made it more interesting. The rest of my party also opted for pasta dishes, and seemed satisfied with their choices. \n\nI wanted dessert, and asked our server for a suggestion. She suggested the Salame al Cioccolato, which I never heard of and told it was a more regional dessert. I had no idea what it would look like, and when it came out, it was in the form of biscotti but moist like a cake. It lived up to its chocolate-y name, with a nutty twist. It came with a side of vanilla gelato. I was pleasantly surprised with this dessert and will be on the lookout for it here in LA. \n\nDespite the slight wait and off warmth of the inside, it was overall a great dining service with good food and better friends to share it with.", "author": "Rebecca T."}

Everyone around us who came in after we put our orders in got their orders before us. And we're not just talking about a 5 minute extra wait. More like we waited for 30 more minutes compared to everyone else. \n\n2) They recognized that we were unhappy with the wait so they comped us a dessert, which was nice of them. We ordered the tiramisu--hey it's an Italian restaurant! Sadly, this was the first time in a decade of eating at SF restaurants that I was not able to finish a dish because I found it inedible. There was ZERO sweetness to this dish, like the pastry chef forgot to add sugar and added salt instead. I had three bites to make sure I wasn't imagining this, and my husband had a bite too and found it disgusting as well. The waitress asked how it was and I told her my honest opinion, she offered to give us a different one (again, very nice of them) but at this point we had stayed in this restaurant for waaaay longer than intended and our babysitter was waiting, so we just ran out of there. \n\nSo sad, we really love this place!

Great food and service, by both the wait staff, and bus boy. Excellent Creme Brulee and Tiramisu.  Perfect el dente Marinara Pasta with Seafood.  Delicious Lamb with great tasting mashed potatoes.  My man does not like Marinara sauce so he asked if he could have a cream sauce (not listed on the menu) with his seafood pasta.  The chef agreed.  The cream sauce was spot on, and he loved it.  Good bread too. \n\nUnless you get lucky, parking is hard to locate, so be sure you allow yourself enough time to find parking before booking the reservation.

This place is the definition of a neighborhood gem.  The ambiance is lovely - warm and inviting from the moment you walk in the door.  I've found the owner(s) and service staff to be nothing but incredibly friendly and helpful.  And perhaps most importantly, the food is on point!  They even recently started heating up the free bread, which up until that point was probably my only consistent gripe about this place.  In terms of specific food items, we've settled into a routine by now and if you stick to any / all of the following, you won't be disappointed:  cucumber salad, any derivation of a burrata appetizer, butternut squash ravioli, gnocchi, and the truffle mushroom pasta is out of this world.

The space is beautiful and located on a quiet/cute street. I ordered the calamari/shrimp, lamb pops, and gnocchi. The calamari wasn't the cheapest calamari I have ever had but it tasted like it should have been. The plate was mostly shrimp and not much calamari, the portions were extremely over salted. Worst calamari I have ever had especially in SF. The gnocchi was solid, the most solid dish. I hated the tacky garnish (way too big of parsley). The cheese sauce is rich and strong, and the gnocchi itself was the right texture. The lamb pops were $40ish and tasted as if they should have been part of a $15 buffet in Las Vegas. The presentation was so \"cruise ship\" esque. I have laid off reviewing for a few years but this experience was so bad I had to write a review. In retrospect I should have stayed in the marina and just stuck with the Italian Homemade Company. \n\nThe takeaway from this review is, the price point of this establishment does not match the quality of the food. The setting matches the price point, they just need to work on the food.. The server I had was extremely solid, very charming and smiley guy!", "author": "Robert O."}

Loved the romantic, fun, and trendy atmosphere. Service was also fantastic. \n\nFor starters, I went with the Cucumber salad. It was a bit bitter... I should've gone with the Carpaccio. As for my main course, I chose the Orecchiette pasta which I should've gone with the Butternut Squash Ravioli instead. The orrecchiette pasta was too heavy and creamy.

I think that the food is decent, but overpriced. \n\nWe started off with free bread, which was soft and went well with the oil served. Unfortunately I think that the bread was better than our entrees. My boyfriend and I ordered the salmon and the ear pasta with broccoli rabe and sausage. The salmon was overcooked and lacked flavor, but I really liked the fried zucchini that came on the side. The pasta was a bit undercooked and too cheesy for my liking. The menu said that it was white wine sauce, but all I could taste was the overpowering cheese.\n\nService was okay- we had to ask more than once to get bread refill. The bill came out to be over $70 for two of us, including wine. Overall I would probably pass on coming back and go elsewhere.", "author": "Sophia H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-24", "description": "First, have to say, what a FABULOUS location, wonderful facade on the outside of the restaurant, and super adorable and cozy interior and atmosphere. We had reservations for six and they were very prompt about seating us when we arrived. They did have to put two tables together, which seemed strange since we had reservations for six and I would have thought, with a reservation, the tables would have been ready. But no big deal. \n\nThis was for my birthday and it was definitely a quiet evening. The other patrons in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying themselves and that was a good sign. \n\nWe ordered a couple bottles of wine, a couple of appetizers and our main entrees. The wines seemed reasonable in price. \n\nHowever, the appetizers were so minuscule and overpriced, it was a little disheartening. We ended up having five of us show up for the dinner and we ordered the eggplant, the calamari, and the salmon tartare.  The eggplant was literally three small bites or so. I had a teensy little piece to be able to share with everyone. I didn't have any of the calamari (due to it also having shrimp and I am allergic to shrimp - probably should have said it contained shrimp in it on the menu), and the salmon tartare, once again was such a small portion, I ate two corn kernel size bites to ensure others could try it. It was very disappointing. The tartare was completely bland with very little flavor. If it had not been for the arugula to give it a little zing, it would have tasted like air. \n\nThe eggplant marinara sauce had great flavor other than at the end, you got a note of it being a little burnt, meaning the simmer was too high. \n\nFor dinner I ordered the lamb chops. I ordered them medium rare and received medium well, dry, bland teeny (3) little bite sized \"coin\" style drenched medallions. The mash that they came with, I picked up in one scoop with my fork and they retained the round scooper shape when I did it. I had a couple of what looked like tempura battered veggie sticks on the plate. DEFINITELY an overpriced dish. \n\nMy friend ordered the Spaghetti Vongolese and we decided to share each others dinner.  She had some of my lamb and I took a few spoonfuls of the spaghetti. Again, the spaghetti was super dry and bland. I actually took a spoonful of olive oil and some pepper flakes and made it have some flavor. \n\nEveryone else's dishes looked delightful (Gnochhi w/truffle, Short ribs, and Veal Scallopini) were the other dishes. They all seemed very happy with their choices. \n\nService was very good and attentive and the server did a great job of taking care of us, even though my water remained empty the entire dinner, after I had drank all of it the first time. \n\nI don't think I will go back to this restaurant. However, I harbor no ill feelings on the matter. Just not as goos as some other Italian restaurants in the area.", "author": "Tanya C."}

It is a small corner restaurant with valet parking since the parking in this area is super hard. Once we entered we got greeted and seated right away. The owner/manager was really friendly but a bit hard to understand with his strong accent. \n\nForgot the name of the red wine we had but it was very light and had a mild after taste which was awesome for my likings - and that says a lot because I don't like to drink lol.\n\nWe started off with two appetizers:\n\n-Beef carpaccio: very delicious especially with the arugula and cheese toppings. The beef was a bit hard to tear apart when we were trying to grab our own pieces but I was a big fan of this dish.\n-salmon: can't seem to find the name of the dish, but it was like a salmon poke dish. The salmon was soft and topped with arugula which went well together as well. Not bad but nothing spectacular.\n\nEntrees:\n-Truffle gnocchi special: this wasn't on the menu but a special that our waiter told us about. The gnocchi was very soft but a bit bland without the truffle sauce. The sauce was made perfectly and I truly enjoyed every bite.\n-Butternut squash ravioli: my favorite entree of the evening. This was my boyfriend's dish and I took one ravioli and immediately grabbed a few more after the first bite. The butternut squash was perfectly sweet with the cheese and filling! I will definitely order this again when I'm back.\n\nDesserts:\n-Tiramisu: didn't try this one because I am not a fan but everyone else really liked it and the presentation. It was in a cup with pieces of tiramisu bites with a milky substance.\n-Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e: this dish was okay, nothing special. Starting to realize I'm not a fan of overcooked sugar on the top of the Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e too :/\n-chocolate crepe and vanilla ice cream: my favorite dessert of the three. The vanilla bean ice cream was very delicious and was paired with a chocolate covered crepe. I enjoyed the ice cream more than the crepe :p\n\nThis place has good service, good food, and not too expensive! Will definitely be back!", "author": "Amanda C."}

Like many restaurants in SF, it's on the smaller side so be prepared to sit fairly close to your neighbors. While I appreciate good wine, I by no means consider myself a wine snob (it takes a lot for me to turn away a glass). However, our group tried 3 different wines on the menu, and they all tasted corked/sour - the waiter was trying to be patient and helpful while we tasted. The food was mediocre and came out lukewarm; Truffle gnocchi & calamari were probably the best things we tried. The Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e had a lemon flavor to it (not mentioned on the menu) and the tiramisu is almost deconstructed & served with a shot of espresso.

When we arrived, the restaurant only had a few other patrons: an older couple that was probably in their 70s (early bird special anyone?) and a young family with a small child. \n\nIt took us a while to figure out what to order, and the server laughed at us because we kept arguing about starters, but ultimately we settled on a couple glasses of red wine, the arugula salad, paparadelle with meat sauce, and linguine with seafood. All of the food was really good. And they even brought out lots of bread and butter on demand. When we polished off the first basket, they even brought us a second without being asked. And when our cousin randomly showed up (with separate reservations), the wait staff even brought her an extra chair for our two top! Basically, food was really good, and service was even better!\n\nI highly recommend ordering the tiramisu for dessert as well. This was definitely made in house and in the most traditional fashion.

Nothing wrong with the service, but come on, that is steep.  18% is what I would expect, 20% I would understand given the group, but going above that merits a dock in a star in my opinion.\n\nGeneral feedback, the plates are thrown in the bin during clean up with no care causing it to be VERY loud from simplely plates banging around.

As such, unless you ARE an Italian fanatic, Amarena will likely give you the best Italian meal you've had in a long time.\n\nFirst, best advice I can give is pay attention to the specials. From the apps on, they matter. For our visit that meant a nice grilled asparagus and parm app that was a great starter.\n\nFor entrees -- go with any special, particularly if it involves fish. Still, the standard seafood pasta is tough to beat, thick with fresh shellfish and rich sauce. Only slight nit is that the house meat lasagna is more of the velvety, smooth prep than the stand up and salute block-o-pasta that many diners may have grown up on. Nothing wrong with it, but just be aware.\n\nHouse red pours were fairly priced and generous, and the wine list had no complaints it was just that we weren't in a wine drinking, let's knock back a couple bottles mood.\n\nDo have to demand that you finish with some Mousse al Tiramis\u00f9 and espresso.

The server seemed disappointed that we ordered a glass of wine each instead of a bottle, didn't order the day's special or want dessert.  \n\nNow the food...the sauce in the mushroom tagiolini dish was quite frankly bland. I've had a similar dish here before (they might have used a different pasta) and I remember enjoying it a lot more then. Hub's bucatini however was fantastic - al dente pasta and had great bacon flavoring in the sauce. \n\nStill a charming location and restaurant always feels cozy - especially since it was COLD out and felt more like January than October.

Ultimately, we were greeted by the waiter whose name escapes me but he was phenomenal.  Very attentive but not invasive.  Conversational but not pushy.  Explained the specials, helped us with the wine list, etc.  Ideal service from the start.  \n\nSo first off, the bread at this place is absolutely delicious, which sounds ridiculous but it is noticeably better than any other Italian place I've been to.  We also ordered a bottle of wine and even though I usually prefer other beverages, the bottle was pretty solid and not too expensive (~$40).  \n\nWe ordered the Gnocco Fritto con Affettati to start and it did not disappoint.  Classical Italian meats (sopressata, prosciutto, mortadella) with fried dough.  The meats were delicious and when combined with the dough (think of a beignet without the sugar) we were off to a great start.  \n\nFor dinner, I got the Pappardelle al Cinghiale, pasta with boars meat ragout, which was delicious.  Not too heavy, perfectly seasoned, good, hearty dish.  However, my girlfriend ordered the Ravioli di Zucca.  I was a little upset when she did because it had no meat in it but boy was I wrong.  The butternut squash was so light and flavorful.  It basically melted in my mouth with every bite.  Highly recommend the ravioli to anyone.  \n\nFinally, for all of you dessert fans out there, this place has one you can't miss.  It's called the Salame al Cioccolato.  The description on the menu is \"A lovely regional dessert from northern Italy made just for people who enjoy Chocolate\" which could not be more fitting.  Basically, this is a soft, dark chocolate mixed with nuts which is flattened and then rolled up like a pastry.  Served with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge it's got the makings of real crowd pleaser.  \n\nBottom line, this place has fantastic food and service without any exaggerated pricing or snobbishness.  Highly recommend, will definitely be back.", "author": "Lukas A."}

I really wanted to try their creme brulee, but sadly was running late for a friend's party so had to skip.\n\nPrices are about average for an Italian restaurant in this neighborhood.\n\nThe service was okay, but nothing great.  I always had the impression that our server was a little confused, and a we had to ask a couple times for extra sangria.  Overall, though, nothing egregious.  \n\nThe dining room is a little too snug, though.  I like small rooms with am ambiance, but the ambiance is ruined when they try to cram one too many tables and chairs into the room.  \n\nI think with a slightly more attentive wait staff and one table less in the dining room, this would be a solid four star restaurant.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend trying out Amarena.  I can't quite give it four stars, but it's a very good cozy neighborhood Italian restaurant.", "author": "Greg B."}

But it's mainly because, according to my receipt, I came here on 2/28/12, and my memory isn't what it used to be.\n\nAnyway, wanted to at least write something as I had a really good experience here. I was meeting a friend (long lost high school friend) in Russian Hill. We debated between a few places but settled on Amarena (being from NJ, we were hankering for some Italian). She had made reservations though we did not need them. Whether it was an odd night (it was Tuesday) or odd time (8pm), I'm not sure, but it was not crowded (sad). We were greeted warmly by the hostess and were given our choice of tables - we chose one by a heater as it was a particularly chilly evening.\n\nOur server was super friendly and accommodating; we took forever to decide what we wanted because were busy catching up. She let us take our time and did not rush us in the least. I ended up getting the beet salad and that night's special - it was a fish risotto dish and very good. My friend got the soup of the day and I believe the tagiatelle, both of which she enjoyed. We had house wine and good conversation. Our waters were kept full and the service was excellent. To note: the happy hour looked fab and is probably worth checking out. I wish I had written this sooner as could have been more detailed on the food, but I definitely would return if I find myself in that neck of the woods again.", "author": "Allison B."}

I have been here many times yet am positively surprised over and over again. \n\nThe romantic atmosphere combined with amazing Italian specialities and food as well as a great wine list make this a very unique gem in the lower Russian Hill neighborhood. The service team consisting of the owner Paolo, Nicole, Gustavo and Dario is absolutely top notch! They are all super friendly, attentive and very diligent in what they do and seem to be at the right place at the right time - always.\n\nTry the Pappardelle al Cinghiale (boar) - absolutely delicious. So are the Pennette allo Scoglio. All is homemade pasta which makes it even more yummy. Their homemade Tiramisu is just top - served in a very special way. How?

Portions are big.  But overall taste was at best 3-star standard (see below).\n\nThere were a few hiccups with service, including having to cram our group of 12 into a table for 8 for the first 30 minutes while waiting for the table next to use to leave ... but I can understand it's hard to predict how long tables stay.  The wait staff were not rude, but not particularly nice either -- spoke a bit too loudly to the guests, and did not take point to remember who ordered what, BUT still delivered a overall good meal.\n\nI will also commend wine we had here.  We ordered fairly low priced bottles ($40-45) but 3 were fantastic.\n\nHITS:\n--Bruchetta ($9) for 3 -- Tastiest tomatoes, and heaps of it.  \n--Wild Boar Pappardelle ($18) -- Everyone's favorite.  I actually didn't order this -- big regret.\n\nONLY SO SO:\n--Calamari ($14) -- Pretty boring and forgettable.\n--Salmon Tartare ($?) -- Not bad, but the mayo mixed into the salmon cubes overpowered everything.  Might as well have been chicken salad.\n--Lasagna ($14) -- thinnest lasagna we've had -- about 1 inch to the bottom of the dish.  Lots of cheese and meat, but i prefer my lasagna squared and high, Garfield style.\n--Mushroom Tagliolini ($18?) -- I read \"wild mushrooms\" got really excited, but the dish lacked that nutty roasted flavor you can usually expect from such a dish.  This one might as well have been made with canned mushrooms as I couldn't taste it.", "author": "Kendra W."}

Needless to say it was a bad start. Once we settled in though we had a pleasant experience. The food was proficiently made and the ambiance was more than tolerable. I think the two factors that really made the experience a positive one were: 1) the neighborhood feel, and 2) the excellent service (other than seating near-debacle).

I'm totally sold based on excellent service and high quality food. Plus the interior has a very homey feel with brick walls, small European town style windows, and everyone on staff with Italian accents.\n\nAlso, definitely a neighborhood gem. One of those places that's always busy yet there's never too much of a wait. People don't tend to make reservations to go here so there's always tons of slots available on opentable.\n\n~~SERVICE~~\nLike I mentioned - fantastic. We had a 7:30pm reservation on a Thursday night and half my party was an hour late (they are from oakland and didn't build in time for parking). The owner kept updating us, trying to hold a table for us, and just did a really great job not making us feel forgotten. If I had realized early enough my friends were driving in, he would've even had a parking spot for us (maybe one of those spots restaurants have saved for loading?). I think it definitely helped that I am a neighbor though - the owner visibly sparked up the moment I mentioned this, introduced himself, and was super friendly ( not that he wasn't friendly before).\n\nBEST part about the service: that night the chefs spread deal (on Thursdays you can get one drink and help yourself to an Italian buffet) was ending at 8 rather than 9pm and when the owner mentioned this he could see our disappointment. So even though only half my party present and none of us had ordered drinks, he let us help ourselves to the buffet and just sit on the side to eat our food! He even promised to set aside some food from the buffet for our friends when they arrived (this promise was later kept)!\n\nEven better part: when the last two girls finally arrived we had to wait a while for our table (not their fault AT ALL we had been telling them for an hour \"our friends will be here any minute!\" and they were crazy busy all along). Just as we were on the brink of starving to death, the owner came by with glasses of CHAMPAGNE, ON THE HOUSE!! For all of us. What a fantastic surprise! And he had the most adorable Italian accent.\n\n~~CHEFS SPREAD~~\nThere was focaccia bread (buttery, soft, yet good firm texture), salad (simple with greens and a vinaigrette dressing, nicely done), penne with meat sauce (a softer pasta, which I like, with tangy and tasty meat sauce), rice with sausage (probably the most bland item. The rice was dry, the sausage more like cut up slices of cheap hot dogs), and meatballs (fantastic! Tender meat, fresh and flavorful sauce).\n\n~~DINNER MENU~~\n* Gnocchi - 4 stars\nVery very soft, tasty, well made gnocchi. The cheese (blue? Gorgonzola?) was very strong and added a lot of flavor. It was super tasty and super fatty - I took half home and when it cooled in the fridge, the sauce became a completely solid lump! A very tasty lump - nothing a microwave can't fix.\n\n* Homemade Ravioli - 4 stars\n(Stuffed with Butternut squash in a brown butter Sauce and Vegetarian Ragu - $15)\nAlso fantastic. Great flavor, perfectly textured pasta that was thin yet held the contents well.\n\n* Salads\nTried a bite of my friends' salads, a beet one and another. Both were really good, simple, light.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

The truffle mushroom were getting shaved onto my noodle as I chatted away with the lovely folks of the Cibi molto buono and Italia. How generous. The foods and warm and attentive service were all excellent. Honestly, this is my #1 Italian restaurant in SF. And that's coming from a Tokyoite who still has not found her favorite Japanese restaurant in the Bay Area, after 6 years, yet. Oh well, I at least have one Italian restaurant I really like.", "author": "Mihoko S."}

This place was recommended by my bf's brother's roommates/friends. Its a small little restaurant tucked on a corner in the mist of the SF streets near Union Square. \n\nWith no reservations we were sat comfortably in their corner tables with shining (literally) views of the streets of the City. Our server was the biggest sweetheart with her absolutely sexy, husky French accent. She chilled our champagne for us as we our table socialized and studied the menu. \n\nOur table shared the small plate features of their beef carpaccio on top of with capers and arugola (Carpaccio di Manzo; Bruschetta  della Casa;  and mozzarella cheese on top of tomato carpaccio (Burrata alla Caprese). Fitting for the five of us, these dishes were accurate portion without overwhelming flavors and definitely a pleaser for first-timers and small eats before our entrees. \n\nTo eat, I was excited to try their spinach gnocchi with mushroom in a (very) creamy gorgonzola sauce (Gnocchi con Funghie e Gorgonzola). Since I am around pasta on a daily basis for my job, I was taken to great heights of indulging my palate with pairing this dish with Primitivo. The Primitivo is a great pairing in bringing forth the sage in the dish. This is so helping me in my life, since it is teaching me to understand food. And it is so worth the time and effort to pair and discover why food is so enjoyable.\n\nFor dessert, of course, I had their creme brule (Crema Catalana) paired with the Moscato. It was good. However, I have had better. But that is only because Creme Brule is one of the foods, I contend with others to find the best and my own personal stamp of the best Creme Brule I have ever tasted. At least it didn't taste like some custard pudding - it tasted exactly how it is suppose to. \n\nEnjoyable experience, good company, and great service. I definitely recommend Amarena for dates and small groups (max 6 people).", "author": "Jamie L."}

This is the type of place that makes you enjoy the local mom and pop Italian restaurants and the pride they take in their menu.

The restaurant was quiet enough to have a decent conversation and small but not cramped at all. \n\nI can't think of anything particular that would make me give this place a 5 star but I can't think of anything wrong with it and I look forward to going back for more!", "author": "Lauren B."}

The wild boar was bland and the overall dish just didn't work for me.  \n\nMy friend had the osso bucco and he didn't seem to enjoy it that much neither as they no longer serve it with pasta.........instead it was with, I believe, polenta.   \n\nThis may sound weird but the service was attentive yet bad.

None of this dry cake bullshit with whipped cream that you see at other places.\n\nThe Amarena waitstaff is very earnest and kind, and genuinely want to provide great service and recommendations.

The wildboar papardelle was good, very flavorful and well-balanced. The mushroom pasta with truffle oil was extraordinary, the best I've ever had. The truffle and mushroom flavors were so fragrant and delicious, though the dish is a bit rich.\n\nService was TERRIBLE. First of all, 7 of our party of 8 arrived at 6pm on a Sunday, and it was not busy at all. The waitress appeared to have a hard time understanding English, and we had to repeat our orders several times. She also kept rushing us to order when our 8th person hadn't arrived. The bus boy/manager were kind of rough-handed and would splash water when re-filing, or hit the glass when setting down entree plates. Also, my bread plate was dirty when I sat down, as was someone else's water glass. The waitress also dropped dessert forks carelessly on the dessert plate with a clash.\n\nThen it really started to go downhill when everybody else had already gotten their entrees, and the owner/manager asked me what I ordered, and then went back to the kitchen to check, and told me they'd just put the baked eggplant in the oven. So I was like snore, this is gonna take forever. When it finally arrived it was somewhat undercooked if you like eggplant to be very tender. Otherwise it was not bad with the sauce.\n\nNow the highlight of the exceedingly terrible service was when one of us tried to flag the owner/manager down to ask for the check, and he waved and said excuse me several times, and the owner/manager just flat out kept walking past him and ignored him! We persisted on the way back, and then he replied grumpily \"I know!\", and shuffled angrily back toward the kitchen and proceeded to yell at the bus boy about something. 10 more minutes went by, during which time a couple that had sat down some time ago walked out b/c nobody went over to take their order, and the owner/manager yelled some more at the bus boy and waitress and then hovered over our party and pointed down at us angrily, motioning that we wanted our check.\n\nIt was the most uncomfortable dining experience I've had in a long time, and it was all the more unfortunate that tip was automatically tacked on.", "author": "Hera N."}

Calamari and shrimps breaded and fried perfectly.  Awesome.  The tomatoes and onions in oil over toast was just ok - the tomatoes were slightly under ripe, and I personally didn't enjoy the portabella mushroom appetizer - mushrooms were huge but bland, and the presentation was off; it just looked kind of unappetizing.  My gnocchi was cooked perfectly, but the gorgonzola sauce could have used a bit more kick to help out the inherent blandness of potato and pasta.  The carbonara I tried was outstanding, as was the squash ravioli.  The lasagna looked great.  Service was outstanding, and the wine selection was fine.  A nice place, perfect for a date that won't break the bank.  Don't bring young kids - it's too small and cramped inside.  The only issue was parking.

We had been to every other restaurant within several blocks, but for no good reason, we never came here.  It is tiny, lively, a little noisy if you're sitting next to a table of four really loud, drunk people, but the atmosphere is generally very quaint.  Our server was very accommodating, as she offered to make a dish for my husband that was not on the menu.  Veal scaloppini with a little mozzarella were super tasty.  The appetizer salads are ok, and the frittura mista was good.  We'll be back for a Friday night dinner, or for one of their weekday happy hours.", "author": "Spice O."}

I'm not usually a stickler for service and I keep an open mind, but the girl forgot to put the order in for our main course. We waited 30 minutes before we said anything. When we did, the girl was argumentative and pushed back - it was surprising and frustrating. Honestly, she should have just made things right, not argued with us and put the order in, albeit late.  She said she was going to cover the meal (although that wasn't our intent) but we ended up paying for it. Totally fine, just the whole situation was ridic.\n\nThe food was great and I wish I could say I'm 100% certain going back, but there's a good chance I won't and I won't recommend anyone going here.", "author": "Miche W."}

It went fairly well with the Barberra we brought with us (only $15 corkage). Perfect portion for me but a bit on the small side if you are a hungry boy. Another pasta dish that I recommend is the butternut squash ravioli. Definitely on the small side in terms of portions but truly one of Amarena's more unique pasta dishes. My friend who ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese was terribly disappointed.  He said it was a sloppy assembled mess that tasted like mushed up meatballs with over cooked noodles. \nThe procuitto with mozzarella and mushroom appetizer failed to impress but the salame chocolate dessert (fried chocolate cookie log) was very impressive. \n\nIf I lived in the area I would probably frequent Amarena more often but it was nothing too unique that will make me trek out to Russian Hill for round 2.", "author": "Debbie C."}

One problem I've had with them, however, is that back in 2004 I booked a table with them via OpenTable.com. At the time, I must have checked the opt-in box for promotional e-mails from the restaurant, and Amarena does not maintain a properly functioning \"opt-out\" feature for their promotional e-mails so I have been unable to stop their admittedly infrequent spam from populating my inbox for the past 8 years.\nYes. \nFor 8 years. \nFor 8 years, I have been begging Amarena to take my name off of their e-mail distribution list, and for 8 years, they have been paying lip-service to my requests without actually honoring them. \nHonestly, I have been bad mouthing this place for 8 years because of this, and I've been withholding my patronage from Amarena (in favor of other walkable, local choices like Frascati, luella, Allegro or Seven Hills) simply because they maintain a promotional e-mail list without a properly functioning \"opt-out\" feature. I just received another e-mail from them today, and rather than do what I've done in the past and follow their opt-out instructions, I'm hoping that some negative feedback on Yelp will get them to act on this matter and stop spamming their unwilling customers.\n\n[edit: _the very next day_] --- and it worked, because I received a message from someone at Amarena less than 24 hours after posting this review, and he was incredibly contrite and accommodating about this whole affair. There will be a little \"wait-and-see\" until we manage to correspond to confirm that a) my name has been removed from their customer e-mail database and b) his e-mail distribution provider updates their \"opt-out\" procedures to be in compliance with federal Can-Spam laws -- after which time, no one will be able to read this review, because I will have deleted it by then. In the meantime, I will be having dinner at the restaurant at some point this week (not a \"comp,\" at my own expense) in order to meet the manager face-to-face and put this unpleasantness behind us. So if you found this tale compelling, you may want to make a reservation at Amarena this week and see if you're there to see the sparks fly (or the backs get slapped and flesh pressed, as the situation may go)\n\nKudos to the management at Amarena for taking a contrite and conciliatory path toward resolving this situation. My next updated review will be written strictly with regard to the food, the service, the experience and the value.\n\n[edit: the following year...] Never received another e-mail from them after that last incident, and was delighted to put this admittedly very \"first world problem\" in my rear view mirror. A dozen ex-girlfriends have read this review and mused, \"yup, that's him, and -- yes -- he's still single.\" Since my episode with the restaurant's promotional machinery, I've eaten there twice and had magnificent dining experiences both times.

Based on this single, personal, idiosyncratic circumstance I am going to be handing down my decisive final judgement on this restaurant, because that appears to be how everyone has always reviewed everything for the entire history of everdom.\n\nI got two dishes: the cherry tomato soup and the wild boar pappardelle. I can't claim a very refined palate, but I think the soup was exceptionally good. Another possibility is that it was a rather generic soup and I was tricked by the atmosphere of the place into thinking it was superb. The difference between these two cases is less important than you might suspect.\n\nI love eating wild boar: doing so makes me feel like I'm doing a service to society, seeing as how those boars are *wild* and clearly up to no good. The wild boar pasta was tasty. I ate it all. The sauce splashed around a bit, as sauce is wont to do.\n\nThe bread that came with the meal was great. That said, I am a great lover of all kinds of breads and if you are more particular in your yeasty preferences it might not be totally perfect for you. It was on the crusty side, not particularly buttery or anything, but warm and good for dipping in olive oil. I suspect foodie types will like it?\n\nThe service and atmosphere were delightful! I was delighted. My waitress was super-friendly, and charmingly dealt with my own personal awkwardness. Since I got there early, it was pretty quiet and I could hear the staff all chatting to one another in Italian.

TO THE OWNER-SACK UP AND GET MORE STAFF ON, DON'T BE A CHEAPSKATE BECAUSE YOUR PRICES JUSTIFY YOU SPENDING ENOUGH FOR DECENT STAFF, IT'S NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE DINING EXPERIENCE.   We waited 20 minutes for our drink orders to be taken or to receive any bread etc.  That's a lot of time sitting around with nothing to drink or snack on.  \n\nI ordered the Linguine with seafood and could never recommend it to anyone.  All the seafood in my dish was far overcooked and was very tough.  It felt like I was gnawing though dry old rubber bands.  Half of the dish's size would be attributed to the bulky clam/mussel  shells, many of which were empty.  Some may think this adds authentic appeal or flavor, but really it's just inconvenient, is a way to make the dish look bigger and more elaborate, and if the contents of the shellfish are so poorly cooked it's just a constant reminder of that while you pick pieces of shell out of your dish and mouth.  For $15+ I would expect better.  \n\nOther entrees and appetizers have been slightly better but also failed to impress, especially at the price point.  The house wine was not very good.  Others were satisfactory because I knew what I was ordering ahead of time.  \n\nIn a similar price range, it simply cannot compare to superior restaurants like Trattoria Contadina (always excellent) and Frescati, both of which are not far and are outstanding.\n\nSorry Amarena, but you just need to step it up.", "author": "Uuri K."}

My husband ordered a glass of red wine. Here's where it went down hill... \n\nThe Sangria was too sour and the fruit in it did not seem fresh at all. My husband's glass of wine seemed equally as bad. We spoke to the staff about the wine and of the servers tasted it and said 'oh, it's okay' - anyway, she proceeded to give him another glass of wine (which was also not good). We paid our bill without drinking even an ounce of our drinks & left no tip. We have both worked as servers so this is a big deal for us - we have never not left a tip.

The kitchen staff makes the pasta fresh in-house for the entrees. \n\nI live in the area so I walk to dinner here.

To describe it as mediocre is giving it more credit than it deserves. I have lived in the neighborhood for a while now and decided it was time to give this place a shot- my roommate and I ordered the meatballs as a starter and the gnocchi con funghi e gorgonzola to go. If we had eaten in the restaurant, we would have sent everything back. \n\nThe meatballs were reminiscent of the swedish version in a Stouffer's frozen dinner - bland, tiny, and six to a plate for $10. It seems they tried to make up for the lack of flavor by dousing them in sauce (it was more like find-the-meatball soup); unfortunately, the sauce looked like, and didn't taste much better than, ketchup. Or generic tomato sauce right out of the can. Completely uninteresting.\n\nThe gnocchi were undercooked and had the texture of cookie dough, the gorgonzola sauce plain, bland, uninspired. And the funghi were TWO regular white mushrooms. Such a disappointment!\n\nThe only thing we liked was the bread, which was obviously home made. \n\nCompletely unsatisfied, we redeemed the meal by ordering from another neighborhood restaurant of reliable quality (see review on Frascati).\n\nI will never return to Amarena, and I suggest you don't either.

That was probably the only thing that wasn't drenched in oil out of the calamari. For my main course I had their special which was the Filet Mignon in mushroom sauce.

I make very good tirimisu but this one was to die for. \nTheir service was decent. They didnt have a table big enough to for our whole party so we had two big table next to eat other and I ordered 2 of each appetizer for each table so 4 total and the woman had a hard time understanding.

But not here. I was pleasantly surprised. I felt home, I felt in Italy :) \n\nThe staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is cozy. We didn't have a reservation, therefore when we arrived we had to wait 10-15 minutes for our table, so we decided to order a bottle of Barolo from the bar - which then it was transferred to our table...very good wine from Piedmont! \n\nTo have a taste of different dishes my friend and I decided to share everything. \nWe started with the \"Burrata\" and the \"Gnocco fritto con Affettati\": the burrata was super fresh and creamy, simply delicious! I wanted my friend to try the affettati: mortadella, prosciutto di Parma, speck and soppressata...like in Italy! She really liked them. \n\nFor the pasta dish the waiter suggested the \"Pappardelle al Cinghiale\" and the \"Ravioli di Zucca\": what a great suggestion! I loved the pappardelle: made from scratch by the chef with a super tasty boar meat, mushroom and tomato...they melt in my mouth. A must dish! The ravioli were homemade too and were filled with butternut squash with ricotta cheese.\n\nWe were full but we could not leave without ordering dessert: the \"Budino caldo al cioccolato\" and the \"salame al cioccolato\"....yeah, both my friend and I love chocolate!  I found the salame al cioccolato being too dry but I loved the budino! It was a great combination of suffle' with vanilla gelato :)\n\nMy friend and i had a great experience at Amarena.

The place still has braces and glasses on but has potential.  This awkwardness mainly had to do with our server (very sweet, and tried hard, but seemingly new to the business - e.g. didn't understand how to course the sides with the mains, instead brought it out with the apps; also, this is not the snappiest service in the world so if you're on a schedule...you've been forewarned).\n\nAs for the food: the crush has grown up and now has straight teeth and contacts.  We ordered bruschetta and the spicy cucumber/tomato/basil/red onion salad for appetizers and both were delightfully delicious.  Nothing too pretentious - just good food.  The table bread is dense and warm and buttery too (same bread is used for the bruschetta).\n\nFor mains we got spaghetti and meatballs and vegetarian pesto lasagna.  The spaghetti was soooooo good (yes, that many O's are appropriate).  The meatballs were not your typical meatballs - they were more like pan fried meat cakes which sound odd but were a cool change up from the normal simmered for 10 hours in sauce meatballs.  The pasta was fresh and firm and the sauce was full of tomato and basil-y goodness.  As for the lasagna - it was rich, tasty, and very pine nutty.  We also ordered spinach with pine nuts on the side...I want more.  It was garlicky, delicate, not over sauteed, and well accented by the pine nuts.\n\nDesserts: creme brulee - fine, but they topped it off with liqueur.  That made me frown.

We have been here on several occasions and do like the atmosphere and food.  Well, this reservation was for Valentines Day and it was a disaster.  First, the normal menu was suspended of which we were not notified about before we arrived at the restaurant even though the restaurant had our information.  Second, when we arrived, they gave us a list of what they would be serving.  A choice of steak or fish.  I don't have a problem with this, but my girlfriend doesn't eat red meat and is not a fan of Sea Bass.  Therefore, the waiter said she could have Eggplant parmesan instead which is vegetarian.  We had the meal in the courses they laid out.  We had no choice about what we would receive in the different courses since we had no choice and the restaurant gave us what they wanted.  For an appetizer, I received raw tuna.  I don't eat raw fish.  This was a waist.  This went on and on and I was very disappointed, but didn't want to ruin the date.  When we were finished, and it came time for the check, it showed that each meal was $85 plus the wine bill.  This meant our bill was for $247 plus tip for 2 people.  Well, this just isn't right since our bill at this restaurant has never been over $80 for both of us total.  We both work for a living and this kind of surprise was not welcome.  Also, the main courses were not even hot.  I don't know how you serve a steak cooked medium that isn't hot at all, unless everything was prepared way in advance.  My girlfriend said the Eggplant Parmisana was just barely warm - and there were only 3 slices of eggplant.  We were shocked.  I tried not to ruin the evening, but when we were brought the check, my girlfriend was brought a very long stemmed rose.  I apparently had a look of shock on my face and she asked why.  I finally told her how much they charged us for the meal, and we both were completely disgusted.  The food was not that good, the service was slow and the waiter even forgot our bread.  Slightly warm food and we were still hungry.  We didn't want to cause a scene, so I paid and we left.  About 1 hour later, since we were still hungry, we went to Subway for something more substantial.  \n\nI will not ever go to this restaurant again since they didn't tell us how much the meal would be prior to the dinner, and then the food was not good at all.

The tomato sauce was tasty, but the pasta reminded me of the stuff I cook at home out of a box. The dish also was skimpy on the fish -- calamari, a couple prawns, and about a half dozen off-tasting mussels. My husband was not impressed with the osso buco either. \n\nIn the end, there are too many great Italian restaurants in this city to warrant a return trip to Amarena.", "author": "Jennifer Y."}

On July 4th, I wanted to take them somewhere nice to eat after the fireworks show.  We drove around and came upon Amarena by accident because it was really hard to find any place that was still opened after 10pm and on a holiday! It was the first decent place that we saw driving around.  \n\nWe were greeted by a very lovely hostess in this intimate and warm restaurant where you can tell the food is home-made. My nieces had their fettuccini and fell in love with it. The cream sauce was very good and tasted fresh.  My favorite had to be their creme brulee, which tasted as if it just came out of the oven and melted in my mouth. The girls loved the food here and appreciated the warm service. The meal was reasonably priced. The only reason why I didn't rate this 5-stars is because as good as the food was here for my niece... I cannot honestly say it's my favorite as the menu was limited but definitely different/unique. My favorite italian restaurant is somewhere by Napa Valley, but I cannot remember the name of that place. Once I do... I will definitely write a review on it.", "author": "Linh N."}

The first time I went I ordered the Early Bird and the food was good but the portion sizes were tiny.  I had ordered Spaghetti meatballs which was basically one large meatball and a tiny portion of spaghetti.  Even if they had added more spaghetti which for them would be cheap it would have made it seem a bit better.\n\nAs I liked the food I went back and the next time I asked the waiter if the portion sizes on their normal menu are bigger than the early bird offer and was was told they were and ordered off the normal menu.  The portion size was still small.  I don't know why they are sacrificing customers by providing insufficient quantity of food.  \n\nThe wine list is ridiculously overpriced for a casual Italian and it is cheap quality wine with a big markup.

We are driving around the Nob Hill area and have no clue what to eat or where to go.  So what do we do?  We go on Yelp of course!  We see a few restaurants and decide on Amarena.  Best decision of our day!!  This place was AMAZING!  To start with, the place was packed, we didn't think we had any chance of getting a table.  The extremely helpful host, worked his magic, called a reservation who hasn't shown, and then moved a few tables around to find us a spot.  How great is that?!?  This place is very authentic, our waitress was literally FROM Northern Italy, and had a great accent.  \n\nOn to the food, my favorite part.  Our server was quick, helpful, fun, and made sure we had a great time.  We started with her recommendation, a bottle of red wine and the  Caprese salad, which was possibly our second best decision of the day.  The mozzarella literally pulled apart when you put your fork into it, as if it had been made just moments before served.  The mozzarella was by far the best I have ever had, and I am a cheese addict.  If you go here, and don't order the Caprese salad, you are a fool.  My girlfriend who doesn't even like tomatoes loved it.  As for the entrees, I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs with bolognese sauce and it was definitely one of the best I've had!  The girlfriend got the risotto which was delicious (yes I ate at least a third of it).  Our other friend ordered the special, which was a Pork Tenderloin and that was probably my favorite dish of all.  The bottles of wine we got were perfectly paired with all of our meals, and I really wish we had tried desert.  Next time!\n\nOverall, it was an amazing experience.

Not alone.)The food was nothing special-it was average. Small portions. \n\nBut the service was AWFUL. It was clear that they were trying to get you in and out as quickly as possible. We barely finished one course when the waitress would bring us the next, and she even brought out our desserts out before we had finished out entrees, so we got to sit at this tiny table with both. There was no offer to refill our waters or to bring us more bread. And it wasn't just me who noticed this-the couple sitting next to us made a similar comment after the waitress took their check before they even had a chance to sign it. We finished a four course meal in under an hour and fifteen minutes. \n\nAnd I get it-the economy is bad and restaurants are struggling and V-day is a profitable night. But if you are going to charge $75/person for average food, at least provide your patrons with a pleasant dining experience instead of practically forcing them to inhale their meal. I would think that making people want to come back to your restaurant is a better business strategy that having one profitable night and pissing off potential customers.

But my aunt insisted we that check out a new spot in my hood, and after a little yelping I settled on Amarena. \n\nCouldn't have been happier with my pick. Fist off: ambiance. Amarena is warm, cozy and perfect for thawing on a cold January night. We had the entire restaurant to ourselves, which I hope was indicative of a typically slow Sunday and not the dwindling economy (eek). \n\nImpressive wine list too, considering that my aunt - an unofficial connoisseur - found a never-before-tasted varietal: syrae (not syrah). The manager (owner?) came over to chat and share his opinion: apparently syrae is best described as a drier cab. Whatever the label, it was delicious, and we split two bottles between the four of us...and after a full day of wine tasting too. \n\nOnto the food: we were three for three with the appetizers. Two crispy wedges of polenta were coated in a rich, creamy gorgonzola and mushroom sauce. The eggplant parmesan was stacked three layers high with parmesan and herbs wedged between each layer of perfectly cooked, non-mushy eggplant (a crucial element, according to my fellow diners). And the golden beet salad with ricotta dressing was light, fresh, and flavorful. \n\nBecause winter calls for comfort food, we all indulged in Amarena's homemade pasta dishes. The Veal Shank was so tender that the meat literally fell off the bone in the Osso Buco, and the seafood linguine was piled high with salmon, clams, calamari, and prawns. The butternut squash ravioli in a brown butter sauce was ridiculously fresh and light - not your typical coma inducing pasta dish.

I didn't want to pick any old place and instead wanted somewhere that I loved, but had neglected to review until now. I finally decided Amarena, one of my neighborhood gems.\n\nFirst I should begin by telling you a little about fella. He's a great cook and prides himself on making excellent Italian food -- which he does. The only problem with that is that he never wants to go to an Italian restaurant when we go out because he feels (somewhat legitimately) that he can make better food at home. I, however, love to go out to eat and like to change up the cuisine choices.... not having Italian on our potential list of food made me sad. Our compromise is Amarena.\n\nWhat my fella loves most of all when it comes to food is seafood, which fortunately, is where Amarena really shines. Delicious, fresh seafood pastas and appetizers, especially the calamari and the squid ink pasta. The wine list is reasonably priced and the service is always attentive. If you happen to be in the neighborhood on a Thursday, stop in and see if they are having their happy hour (it's only every other Thursday), when they offer live music and free food and drinks.  \n\nThank goodness for Amarena which single-handedly brought Italian food back into our restaurant rotation.", "author": "Rebecca H."}

Sometimes they'll do it with wild boar instead, which is equally tasty.  Just give it a try -- I all but promise you'll like it.  Order a glass of whatever sangiovese they have on the menu, and you'll be enjoying a really nice, relatively inexpensive meal in a cute spot.", "author": "Laurence W."}

But hey, that is my Amarena experience.\n\nThree of us arrived at 7pm on a Sunday night and waited for two more friends to join. The waitstaff were pleasant but clearly inexperienced and not terribly enterprising. (A touch of the Basil Fawlty with only 50% of the mania, if you know what I mean) The restaurant was far from crowded, but we had to ask for virtually everything - the bread basket, to place our food order, to open the clearly-meant-to-be-uncorked bottle that we brought with us (corkage is $15). The background music was best described as the bottom-of-the-barrel-automated-restaurant-pipe-through-the-worst-of-the-worst-elevator/airport-muzak. Not quite the environment-builder that we'd hoped for.\n\nBetween us, we ordered a couple of salads to start and an entree apiece. My friend ordered the chicken special and was told, at 7.45pm, 25 minutes after we placed the order, that they'd run out . We expressed mild curiosity at this point as to how a special could have run out so early. We're sorry we asked. \"Um, it's been a special for about 2 weeks and it was starting to go bad, so we've been really pushing it lately\". This was revealed as a 'joke' only after we had all guffawed in horror/concern. Certainly left us wondering.\n\nAnyway, the salads pitched up and were pretty decent - one basic mixed green affair with oranges and fennel, the other  a delish beet salad with some sort of leafy greens, drizzled with a pesto-like dressing. Too bad we had to wait about 40 minutes after the salad being cleared to experience entrees. (and again, bear in mind we were practically the only people there.)\n\nI think our party was generally pleased with the quality of their main courses. I had a squid ink linguine with various seafood items tossed through it, and it was pretty tasty. My roommate, on the other hand, opted for veal scallopine stuffed with proscuitto and some sort of cheese. It was all going fine until he found a couple of chunks of aluminium foil in his entree. We politely called over the owner, Paulo, to comment on this. In return there was neither horror, surprise or apology - all we heard was the equivalent of \"ah, that's the way they cook it\".  Tough luck for my roomie I guess.\n\nToward the end of the night, our hapless waiter invited us to happy hour \"tomorrow night\". We expressed surprise and delight at a happy hour on a Monday when we'd been told that happy hour was actually on Thursdays. Turns out our waiter THOUGHT it was Wednesday. And commented on how quickly the week had gone. I'm sorry, I have an MBA and yet that math eludes me.\n\nTo the restaurant's credit, we did end up with some free dessert (two of the party had been at a happy hour the prior Thursday and bonded with the Pro-aluminium foil owner, which probably explains that). But at the end of the day we had a lot of talking points related to our dining experience at Amarena, and not many of them related to the food. \n\nBasta, as they say in Milano.", "author": "Leela S."}

Our server was a cute little Italian guy who felt bad about making us wait to put in our drink order, and he ended up giving us free champagne all night - 3 glasses each! All the food was very reasonably priced. I had the butternut squash ravioli and they were delicious and the total bill came out to $40 for the two of us. My only complaint was that the place was ridiculously loud and not really conducive to conversation.\n\nThe second time I came with a large group and the restaurant was practically empty. Everyone's orders came out at the same time... except mine. No explanation from the server. About ten minutes went by and he finally came out with my risotto. It was totally undercooked and inedible. Clearly, they'd forgotten about my order (somewhat understandable since there were about a dozen of us at the table), but what I was really pissed about was that the tried to quickly throw together a dish that takes a long time to cook and can't really be put together in a hurry. The server was nice and brought me a free dessert, but still.. I left with a bad taste in my mouth. (Although, not of risotto.)\n\nSo the verdict? With all the other cute little Italian places in my neighborhood, I don't see a reason to come back here.", "author": "Lindsey S."}

We sat outside, near a pretty tree with red lights. \n\nNow, the food. Ravioli Di Zucca --  pumpkin ravioli in a butter and sage sauce -- is superb at $15. Balanced, well-prepared, with each flavor popping out in a understated way. Amarena features several tasty gnocci dishes (note: I am a major gnocci fan, so take that into consideration). The Sugo Di Agnello -- gnocci in bolognese sauce -- is the stand-out for me. For another pasta dish, the Spaghetti Pizzaiola was excellent, with a delicious basil taste that was certainly worth the $11.\n\nService was classy and timely.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-02-21", "description": "I LOVE AMARENA!!!!  I lived in the neighborhood for over a year before I actually went for dinner (despite drooling at the menu outside on numerous occasions!!) - but once I finally went I was hooked!  Amarena had just been written up in the city paper restaurant review section - and the description of the gnocchi alone inspired me to go that night!  The restaurant itself is adorable - nice mellow colors with soft lighting and beautiful artwork by an italian artist.  And it has a cozy little bar - which is nice if you just want to stop in for a glass of wine and an appetizer - with friendly service and no pretensiousness.  \n\nOk - let's talk about the food.  I usually like to start with Bruschetta - as it's nice and refreshing - and Amarena seems to accomplish the perfect balance - between delicious heirloom tomatoes, red onions, extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The Beef Carpaccio is also delicious - and I love how they serve it with arugola in a nice olive oil/lemon/balsamic dressing (make sure you sqeeze the lemon and mix up the carpaccio - as the italians say this \"cooks\" the beef).  Last time I was there they had Cherry Tomato Soup as the special and it was delicious!  The Involtino di Calamari is also very tasty - and you will definitely want to dip your bread in the lobster bisque sauce.     \n\nAs far as pasta - I'm always a sucker for gnocchi - and it's delicioso here!  The Gnocchi con Funghi e Gorgonzola is as good (and as rich) as it sounds!  I actually love gnocchi with red sauce - so I usually ask for this (off the menu) and they are very accomodating with a light tomato and basil sauce (yummm)!!! And the gnocchi dumplings are so light and fluffy that they are addictive (and difficult for me to share!).  The other pasta dish that I love is the Pappardelle con Cinghiale (wild boar). This dish reminds me of eating at a trattoria in Tuscany - and apparently the owner (Paolo) goes down to the central coast to hunt the wild boar so it's as fresh as can be!!! I've also had the Tagliatelle al Pesto con Gamberi (shrimp) and the pesto is amazing.  I asked the chef for his secret and he wouldn't say - but it's delicious - save some bread for dipping in the sauce!\n\nIf I'm in the mood for fish i usually go for the Wild Salmon - served with cherry tomatoes, olive oil and capers. And if I want a bit of meat the Agnello (lamb) is fantastic! And the lamb comes with roasted potatoes that are cooked to perfection.  I've never tried the breaded pork - but every time I go it looks delicious (and huge) - served with a nice side of arugola with cherry tomatoes.   \n\nFor dessert - I LOVE the chocolate souffle - make sure you leave room - and time for this as it takes a while to prepare.  The gelato is also one of my favorites - served with wild cherries - which is where the name 'Amarena' comes from.  \n\nThe owner Paolo is adorable and always very gracious and welcoming.  He loves to start you off with a glass of prosecco - and then you can take it from there! He is from Milano - and so is the chef - and the waitstaff are usually from Italy - making each visit a very authentic Italian experience.  The last time I was there I actually overheard to women leaving who said \"We don't have to go to Italy to have authentic Italian food now that we found this place!\"  \n\nOne last thing - they have happy hour every Thursday night - which is nice because they always put out a spread of food - including pasta, insalata, homemade onion focaccia (delicious), and other various foods.  All you need to do is order a glass of wine and enjoy!!!", "author": "carla a."}

First, we had a reservation at 8:30 and weren't seated until 9. They were way understaffed. To be honest, they had 25 tables with couples at each table (50) and only one waiter! On top of that, the waiter wasn't very polite or apologetic about the several delays. He didn't even acknowledge our presence for 20 minutes after we had sat down - no water, no bread, not even a \"hello i'm your waiter\". After an hour and a half of being at the restaurant, we got our appetizers. It was already 10pm and several guests had already got up and left before being served the main dish, and we did as well.

I say experience because it wasn't limited to just the food. My friends and I showed up without a reservation, en route to Luella, and decided instead to try something new. After a 15 minute wait, we were seated at the bar. \n\nWe started off with drinks and then the crispy polenta (La Polenta di Amarena), which was delicious. The creamy mushroom sauce did wonders. My Ravioli di Zucca was the freshest pasta I've ever had. I'm used to leaving Italian restaurants having fallen deep into a food-induced comatose state. But no unbuttoning of the jeans was necessary, as my 5 pieces of butternut squash-stuffed ravioli came in a bed of diced veggies. The Gnocchi con Funghi e Gorgonzola was delish (a bit on the heavy side), and came with a cream sauce similar to that of the polenta. And the sea bass special was the biggest hunk of fish I've yet to see on a plate.\n\nBut back to the experience. What's great about sitting at the bar, is that you get to chat with the waiters and the restaurant owner. And Paolo was as nice as could be. Dessert.. the tiramisu was good - I was sold at mascarpone cream. But then dear Paolo gave us each a flute of dessert wine on the house.

The boar was sweet and filling in a savory way and the sole was buttery and with the side of potatoes it was the perfect combo.  1star.  Finally, I have to give the 4th star due to the sense of humor everyone had.  Anyone who is willing to laugh at dumb jokes we might crack and be open and friendly gets a star in my book.  \nDefinitely worth checking out for a relaxing relatively romantic dinner in a low key friendly environment.", "author": "Kylie L."}

First, NO MENU for this evening.  You had a choice of Steak, Fish or Vegetarian.  They did not show the price for dinner on the menu they gave us - or as a matter of fact - gave anyone else.  It included the appetizer, main course & dessert.  When we got the check we almost fainted.  The bill was for $85 per person + $3 for a can of Coke.  The service was not great.  They did give a long stem rose to each couple.  But, a $200 dinner where the food was not hot, we were hungry when we left, and we had not cocktails or wine.  This was a definite case of BAIT & SWITCH.  Even when we left we looked at the menu outside and nothing about the $85 per person for not great food.

But I was hesitant due to some of the complaints on Yelp about the service. I took a chance though, and I am glad I did.\n\nMy parents came in to SF this past weekend, and wanted to meet me for dinner. They felt like Italian. When I heard that, I kind of panicked because I come from an Italian family, and I know that they would be judgemental about the food. I have never been too impressed by any Italian restaurants around here, so I was at a loss. I made a reservation at Amarena and kept my fingers crossed.\n\nI arrived shortly after my parents did. They were at the wine bar speaking with the manager. They were all smiles and laughs. I started to have a good feeling. My parents introduced me to him (Pauly), and he got me a glass of wine. My dad and I then made a reference to Pauly Walnuts (From the Sopranos if you live under a rock). Laughs all around. Dad then explained to me that Pauly had shown him pictures of the wild boars they hunt, and said I should look too. Pauly recommended the pictures for after dinner. My mom agreed, since they are are not cute, they are dead. Ewww. But, dad got a kick out of it, so that's good.\n\nAnyhoo, after a nice conversation with Pauly, we were seated. We had great service all night long. We had a very nice girl serving us, who was understanding when my overzealous Sicilian father somehow broke the candle on our table, and humored him when he tried to make lame jokes. Ahhh, I love my dad. Pauly kept coming back to check on us all night to make sure were were comfortable. He recommened a great wine for my dad to go with his steak. Which leads me into the food...\n\nIt is pretty solid. As I mentioned, I am Italian, and both of my parents and my grandparents make excellent sauces. So when it comes to pasta sauces, I am discriminating. The sauces were good. Not excellent, but good. Not enough flavor for me overall, but I was happy. The gnocchi I had was very tender - great consistency, and the bruschetta was fresh tasting. Dad had a steak dish, and he pretty much licked his plate clean. Mom had a spaghetti dish, and she ate most of it, but it didn't knock her socks off. We also had calamari. It was kind of rubbery, but tasty. The scallops we had garnered mixed reviews. I liked them, but mom did not. Note that they come raw in the middle (I don't think mom picked up on the word \"seared\"). Oh, and the bread is soft and chewy...just the way I like it. Overall, we were happy and too stuffed for dessert.\n\nI guess I just want to say that the service we had was way above average. Even though they were very busy with a wedding party and a bustling Saturday night crowd, we never ever felt neglected...in fact, we felt special and well taken care of. When Pauly saw us get up to leave, he asked if we needed a cab, and ran outside to flag one down for us. \n\nAll in all, we had a great time, and I will definitely be back!", "author": "Baby Bear G."}

The pasta is very fresh and delicious.  The only problem is the sauce seemed liked it lacked elegance or flavor. The place has a small plate part of the menu. A really great choice if you don't know what to get. I really like this in restaurants because I can try more dishes without having to come back another time. I had the meatballs and the polenta.  The meat in the meatballs was too lean.  I've made Italian meatballs before from a cooking class and I would say it was 50% goose fat. These however, were too lean. The flavor very bland and the sauce kept it from being a bad dish.  It was nice tomato sauce with good seasoning.  The polenta was the only better than average dish.  The polenta was moist and had just the right texture.  Not too much cream but not dry either.  The sauce reminded me of a buttermilk gravy sauce.  It was not sophisticated or worth the Russian Hill prices.  Granted I would come back but only if other restaurants were booked near by.

I usually don't snack on bread in restaurants,  but this bread was so good that I ate three pieces!!\nOur entrees, however, were not such a bit hit with everyone. My salmon turned out to be really good. It came with a sauce with capers, tomatoes and olives and there were potatoes on the side. It was sooooo good! The only problem was that I thought that the portion was just a little bit too small. I realize that the food at Amarena is high quality and that it is nice restaurant, but the amount of salmon in the serving was basically a miniature little strip of fish. \nMy friends hated the chicken. They said it was so dry that they could barely eat it.. In fact, one friend asked the waiter if she could please have any sort of sauce over her chicken so that she would be able to eat it. Friends who ordered the rack of lamb complained that the cuts of meat were bad, and that the portions were too small.\nFor dessert, we had coffee, which was good, and the cioccolato dessert, which was very interesting.

It took forever to order and get our food and when our waitress came to give us the food she said that \" sorry it was just sitting in the back for a while\". That's great to hear, then I was siked to eat this meal. She never came back to check on us until long after we finished our meal. We ordered dessert (which was the mistake) and a coffee. She brought both out and asked if we wanted cream, we said yes. The cream never came and she noticed when she came back 30 minutes later with the bill.We said we didn't want the coffee seeing as how we got it for the dessert and she said she'd take it off. She comes back after charging my card and she added another coffee instead of deducting one. So I walk up and point it out and she doesn't the math in front of me and comes up with the same thing. I couldn't believe she really thought that it would be more after taking money off the bill. At this point me and my girlfriend were super over this place. The waitress never said sorry for anything and never apologized. So i signed the bill and we grabbed our things and we opened the door, our waitress ran up and gave us prosecco at the door for \"being great\". At that point it was super too little too late.

Our table of four had the butternut squash ravioli and the veal ossobuco.  The butternut squash ravioli was completely bland and soaking in butter.  The Weight Watchers butternut squash ravioli that I had last week was better.  As for the ossobuco, there was no meat to be found. Only a large bone with some skin swimming in a pasta with gravy.

(Personal favorite probably goes to the calamari-ink linguini with seafood) Chicken was not very good, service is kinda slow, but with a glass of wine in hand and good conversation with friends over dinner, this place provides intimate setting/ambience in the quite part of the neighborhood (Russian Hill?) away from the busy streets.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-05-13", "description": "Amarena is better than most SF Italian restaurants--and that's the Serie A league of Italian restaurants in America.  \n\nThe ambiance is excellent--two nicely understated rooms in what was once a corner grocery store on Larkin at Green.  The owner greets you warmly, and the service is good (but I know that some people have had trouble with it).  We went recently on a Sat. nite but got served promptly and the waiter was always checking back with us.\n\nThe menu is not extensive: mainly fish and pasta.  But they do their dishes nicely.  I favor the seafood mix--calamari, shrimps, mussels, octupus, and tuna--on black ink squid noodles (really done well and tasty).  My wife likes the spinach gnochi and they always surprise with their tastiness.  The other seafood dishes are generally good as are the various pastas.  The salads are tasty but nothing special.  Same with the desserts.\n\nThe wine list is extensive.  BTW the prices are very reasonable for this kind of restaurant.  Many customers are Russian Hill yuppies but don't hold that against Amarena--they are just trying to make a living.\n\nOne huge negative: parking is non-existant within at least a mile.  The last time we went, we only got a space because we saw a guy on Hyde Street take out his car keys and we followed him for three blocks until he got to his car and pulled out.  You can also take a cable car there but that is cornball tourist.  The best bet is to take a 47 on Van Ness and walk about 5 blocks to the restaurant.  Maybe they really need those Russian Hill yuppies to make a living here!", "author": "Murray S."}

I think they must only do specials based on what they can actually get really fresh. In fact, best Caprese salad I've had outside Italy. Too bad its not on the regular menu.\n\nThe osso buco was a real standout, but have yet to have anything bad.

Both the food and wine were delightful -- we ordered steamed clams and mussels, papardelle with ground wild boar and tomato sauce, and the osso buco over palenta, splitting all the dishes between us.  We drank a Mastrobono Riserva 2003, $65 -- the same bottle is advertised on the internet for $50, so that was a good deal.  That made a filling meal for two.  The atmosphere is high-end bistro, a bit loud with close seating but linen tablecloths and attentive service.  Our waiter up-sold us a bit (we gave $65 as our upper limit for wine and he hit it, smack on) but when we teased him about that he comped us two glasses of prosecco.

I was delighted when last minute, on Dec. 30th, I was able to secure a reservation for 4 for New Years eve off Open Table.  The experience was a disaster.  When we arrived, there was a crowd at the front door.  We had a 7.30 reservation.  There was no one greeting people as they arrived or indeed taking any control over the ever increasing flow into the restaurant.   Almost 50 minutes after arriving we were finally seated having waited very graciously.  The food was absolutely appalling, a bland starter of procioutto was served to the table, this was sadly the best part of the mean.  I had the risotto which was luke warm and semi hard from old age with was tastless and tough.  Main course was the Oso bucco which I could have sewed to the sole of my shoe and run a marathon on, it was the fattiest most disgusting piece of meat I'd every been served in a restaurant.  I could barely even cut it and it went untouched as did the same course with everone else at the table.  At that point the bill was placed on our table without the desert that came with the 'fixe prix' let alone asking us if everything was ok or if we wanted coffee.  Upon coffee enquiry we were informed by the Manager that the machine was broken and there was another party waiting despite the fact we hadn't even finished our meal or drinks and had been seated so late.  He was rude and pushy and for this lovely experience we all left $115 per head lighter.   I eat out most nights of the week and the area has so many great places, I was hoping to add Amarena to the list but frankly the whole night left me with little cheer.  We all left hungry and upset.

We had the bruschetta, seafood risotto, seafood ravioli, spinch & gorgonzola gnocchi with shitake mushrooms, handmade pasta with duck, prosciutto pizza, and this fantastic chocolate dessert that is one of their specialties. Parking was a bit hard to find in the neighborhood and if it weren't for a \"parking agreement\" with a neighbor, I would have circled for at least half and hour. The large party in the back room got a bit rowdy so the neighbors called the cops over, but Paolo was really nice and settled the situation. The restaurant is definitely great for parties, but you just have to keep the noise down after 11pm. I would recommend this restaurant over any other place in North Beach.

We should have turned around when we saw that we would be the only table in the entire restaurant at 7pm on a Thursday, but oh well, we learned our lesson.  To start with, I think the waitress was on drugs, which would have been fine with me if she could have shut up for two seconds and let us order our food, or get back to our own conversation.  But for some reason she thought we wanted to hear a 15 minute monologue on why she liked the floating candles on the wall.  Then when we asked her for wine recommendations and told her what we were ordering, her response was, and I'm not even kidding here, \"All the wines go with everything on the menu.\"  I mean, that's a good goal to have, but really, come on.  She also suggested those baked calamari seafood appetizer things a reviewer below disliked, and I have to agree.  The calamari was totally overcooked, and the \"seafood\" it was stuffed with was indistinguishable.  The sauce, however was pretty good.  A salad my friend ordered never came, and our entrees were all pretty unremarkable.  The same vegetables were offered on every plate, which is alright, but makes me think the chef suffers from a lack of imagination.  I ordered the chicken marsala with chicken sausage and although it tasted pretty good, the sausage was shaped exactly like a McDonald's hashbrown patty which kind of grossed me out.  Another table did come in while we were there and they seemed to be having a good time.  They must not have had our waitress.

We never realized this place was just two blocks away from us until yesterday, but now I think its going to be one of our favorite neighborhood restaurants.  There were four of us and all the dishes were great-- as were the appetizers (buffalo mozzarella & bruschetta) and desserts (chocolate souffle & vanilla gelato with cherries).  The waitress/hostess was very friendly/helpful and the place had a very warm feeling to it.", "author": "Michael M."}

We surely would of become \"regulars\" there if we were satisfied with the food as we\ndine out often. But, rather we were very disappointed. The New Year's Eve 4-course dinner we had was a failure. At $65.00 per person, the dinner was pathetically meager. To start off: Appetizers: The prosciutto stuffed w/vegs was good but only one small piece;  the octopus portion was so small, with only a few curls of the Octopus tenticles (oh yes, they did put 4 small wedges of roasted potatoes on it which was odd. We planned on sharing the two appetizers, but there was nothing to share. Pasta: We each had linguini with giant prawns. They left the heads and skin on the three overcooked prawns they gave with this dish which were very difficult to peel off - this was messy. (They should of only left the tail on and peel the skins off before serving. We came to the conclusion that the heads were left on to make the prawns look bigger - they were not really giant at all. This pasta dish was okay but not anything to rave about. The pasta portion was adequate - obviously the \"filler dish\" part of the dinner. Now, the very worse and unexcusable part of this dinner was the Osso Bucco. Usually, this is something that is cooked in liquids a long time so it is very tender when served. The first sign of a problem was that the Osso Bucco was all curled up when it was served. The second sign of a problem is when it was difficult to put our forks into it and hard to cut.  It was full of tough fat/grissle, and finally we had to complain to the owner who pathetically made some poor excuses about it. There was no excuse for this.....the cook had screwed up big time!  If this\nis how the rest of the Osso Bucco was cooked, there were going to\nbe big problems with the remaining customers who were coming in.\nThere were many reservations for this New Years Eve dinner.\nThere was only one other dish served to replace this.....Sea Bass.\nIf there was even a 3 oz portion of the fish served, it is an exaggeration.\nIt was pleasant, but very plain and bland.  It was served with a tiny\n1-1/2\" square of solid aborio rice.  White plate, white fish, white rice,\npretty boring presentation. Oh there were about 4 tiny tiny tomatos\ncut in half for color. What a teaser.  The Dessert: their special\nchocolate cake.....a \"one quarter inch' sliver  thin piece of a brownie with small strips biscotti and walnuts embedded in it. This was good, but such a small portion which looked like a twig on the plate.\nThe only thing we enjoyed was the wine and Cappucino's.   At \n$65.00 per person (not including the wine or coffee), customers were completely taken advantage of with the extremely small portions. Worse of all, the flavor and quality of the food were very disappointing.\n(Others sitting nearby were equally dissatisfied). If you don't know what good quality Italian food is all about....then this place is for you......but, if you do know Italian food......don't even bother to consider this place.  We are native San Franciscans, Italians,\nand have been to many Italian restaurants here and in Italy......and we\nare sorry to say \"this place is a true \"joke\".  PS: this restaurant has\nno heat......and on a cold 40 degree night.....it was chilly in there.", "author": "Girly Foodie F."}

It is the perfect cozy neighborhood Italian restaurant. I guess to some it would have a more elegant or even romantic atmosphere but since I now know everyone by name it is kind of a great place to go with a neighbor when I don't feel like cooking and want something decadent. I have literally called them at 11pm when my girlfriend and I had a mean chocolatey craving and they stayed open so we could run over in our PJs to pick up a dessert. Not sure if they have beer but they have wonderful wines.", "author": "Luna S."}

The owner is super hospitable. I eat here all the time and never had anything bad. Try the Wild Boar pasta, simply the best in the City--believe me I've tried them all. The atmosphere/decor is great too, like stepping in to a courtyard of an Italian village.", "author": "michele c."}

Gnocci w/ mushrooms was good but cream was a bit heavy.  However, the seafood linguine was AWESOME - salmon was very flavorful and included clams, shrimp, squid and white wine sauce was great.

Some Yelp reviews complained about the quiet, but that was actually a plus for me. There are lots of things I'd like to try on the menu, so I will definitely come back! Amarena would be a great place to just grab a glass of wine and maybe some desert, too.", "author": "Sadie H."}

Now I know why. What a huge disappointment. Both my wife and I left completely unsatisfied with the meal and a little under $200 poorer for the experience. It was a \"special\" menu for the night so we weren't able to order the plates that others recommended. First plate of beet salad (blech) and polenta (decent), second plate of pasta and risotto was pretty good, main course of veal was not at all appealing. I'd give it a C- at best. The desert was good, service was pretty standard, and the ambiance was romantic I suppose - but the food was a tremendous letdown. I just moved to SF so maybe this is the way most restaurants operate on Valentine's Day. Jack up prices since they know we desperate men will pay and then pass off second or third rate dishes to improve their profit for the night. Needless to say we won't be back.", "author": "Jeremy W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-02-24", "description": "Authentic Italian food with a real feel of a northern Italian eatery.  Paulo the owner is friendly, generous and enthusiasctic that you are visiting his \"little italy\".  Most if not all the wines are from Italy and are hand picked by Paulo.  I haven't had a bad wine there yet and I go here a couple of times a month.  The place is cozy and dim lit for a romantic dinner.  Small groups fare well too.  The feeling is likened to eating at home in someone's dining room.  My many visits are solo as I get off work late (too tired to cook) and arive via motorcycle due to the terrible parking in this neighborhood.  I recommend taking a taxi for sure unless you are local enough to go by foot.  I sit at the bar which has 3 or  4 chairs and share conversation with the staff while enjoying a glass of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo or Amarone della Valpolicella and wait for arguably the best ossobuco con tagliolini I've ever had (and you too).", "author": "William S."}
