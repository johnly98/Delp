There's so much to say but also so little that can be said!\n\nOn the bridge, you can see Alcatraz, which is another world attraction, you can see a beach (which is apparently all nude? Weird! Sorry nudists, I didn't mean to discriminate against your life choices).\n\nPeople are regularly walking, biking and driving down the bridge, everyday, nonstop. This bridge is so beautiful up close and the work that went into it really shows!\n\nThere is a toll on the way back if you're driving but honestly, if you're not from the area or know the area well, I wouldn't recommend renting a car -- ubering is fine. I would recommend taking a tour of San Francisco and one that includes the Golden Gate Bridge. Especially a double decker, sitting on top, you can really see the architectural genius that went into it!\n\n5/5!!", "author": "Aaron J."}

If you are planning out your day, set aside 30 minutes max to see the bridge. That's enough time to snap some pictures, walk a part of the bridge and leave before you get overwhelmed with the crowd. \n\nThere are people taking  hundreds of selfies at a time like they are going out of style and selfie sticks are still a thing here and people have no shame with taking a photo right in your way. \n\nHonestly, there are better places in SF to see the bridge and avoid this tourist trap.", "author": "Emily D."}

Instead, I call it the San Francisco Bay Bridge. Yeah, I know the locals are gonna whine: \"the Bay Bridge is on the east!!\" HELLO?? Iconoclast!! (Oh, George Carlin!! Why didst thou leave me alone amongst the cretins?)\n\nO.K., for the sake of expediency I shall conform, just this one time, mind you, so I can finally get this review out of my unfinished folder!!\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge (happy, sheep?) is an iconic bridge whose color is hardly gold. But, you know, those early San Franciscans were usually pretty drunk, so chartreuse probably looked Golden to them!! It's famous for being a bridge, much like any other bridge. Not like you hit Super G-forces driving across. It's a little known fact* that the first Selfie was taken at GGB back in 1887, though back then they called it a self-portrait. They weren't bomb like millennials!! \n\nYes, it's a majestic span, in it's own right, and the bridge's construction and history is rather fascinating. Still, it's a bridge. And an expensive one at that. You're going to pay $8 to cross a bridge, and then pretty much U-turn and go right back across, aren't you? Might as well stop for an hour or two and have dinner in Sausalito. Why don't you stop at the Presidio and just look at it. Or Fisherman's Wharf. Better yet, just stay home and buy a postcard on eBay! You'll save TONS of money!! I'm just trying to help. \n\nBesides money, you could be saving yourself tons of TIME!! Traffic can really bottleneck on the streets leading to the bridge. It's up to you though. Maybe this'll be the highlight of your existence, and who am I to put a damper on that!!\n\nIn conclusion: it's a bridge. A cool bridge, kinda orange, but still, just a bridge. \n\n*Historical facts MAY have been fabricated.", "author": "Michael H."}

So glad I finally got to visit it with parents and sister, sister had only been SF once when she was very young so she didn't remember much of SF. \n\nOur Uber took us to the bottom of the bridge, we worked our way up to a few viewpoints, I think this is the best way to see different views of Golden Gate Bridge. We toured the little park with a pier along the coast, and took the hiking trail up to the higher viewpoint, the bottom and second to first viewpoints had much less people so we were able to get some good photos ops! The top one had the most people and it was very crowded which I didn't like. Golden Gate Bridge looked so beautiful and amazing, wish we had the energy and time to ride a bike to cross it like some tourists did. I recommend get to the bottom of the bridge and walk along the coast, take the hiking trail all the way up to other viewpoints to the very top. That way you really get to see a lot more things other than just the bridge, and it's great exercise too!\n\nThis entire place is actually quite romantic too, walk around the park and pier to see ocean views, the hiking trails are filled with plants and flowers so it's lovely to do a little hiking. I'v seen couples riding two person bikes across the bridge, I suppose it's a great date idea too. \n\nNo matter how you decide to tour Golden Gate Bridge, you will not be disappointed that's for sure!", "author": "Mimi L."}

And until this past weekend we were always able to pull into the north bound parking lot, get out for great photo ops, and even walk the bridge before returning to the car and driving away. Now that lot is reserved for \"Buses Only\". What's up with that? Leaving us to find a place to exit, then head back down southbound to very limited parking. We eventually pulled off well into Marin County, I believe Novato, for a restroom break and a few necessary items at a Safeway. \n\nComing back down southbound, we pulled into several lots and waited for a space to no avail. Eventually finding something just past the Log House for those of you that are familiar with that building, and down a side road alongside the old Presidio buildings. It was pay parking, $1.00 per hour. I paid for 3 hours but my printed receipt said we only had 2! It was a good walk to the bridge but quite scenic. And unusually clear skies our full time there, nearly the full 2 hours. Most past visits saw the famous fog roll in nearly hiding the entire structure.

You might have to crawl through a lot of traffic to see it up close, but it is so worth it! At 1.7 miles long and 90 feet wide, the bridge was named one of the seven civil engineering wonders of the United States by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1994 and celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2012.\n\nI've been to the Golden Gate at least a dozen times, but this past visit in August was special. This time, my son and I toured San Francisco with my parents, niece, and nephew and it was their first time. So, of course the Golden Gate was at the top our list! From Morgan Hill/San Jose, we drove through a few hours of traffic on the 280 to 101 and 1 to eventually learn that the public parking lots at both ends of the bridge were closed due to construction. Gah! The Golden Gate Welcome Center and the Golden Gate Vista Point were closed to vehicles, open only to foot traffic!\n\nPlan B. What's my Plan B?! Had to think quick and ended up driving down to Fort Baker to view the bridge from sea level. Fort Baker is on the Marin County side at Horseshoe Cove near the Discovery Bay Museum, en route to Sausalito. In my opinion, it was the perfect place for a few photo opps. Parking was free and plentiful. We even watched a few sea lions swimming in the area and the sail boats cruising by, which made for an awesome background. This area is also popular with bicyclists, so proceed with caution.\n\nNo matter where you are in the city, you should be able to catch a glimpse of this icon.

My heart is in San Francisco sometimes and I think about looking out over the Bay. The Bridge is both a way in and a way out. A way in to all of the adventures and hustle and bustle that this city offers--the food, the people, the secrets behind the staircases, the bread, the truffles, the tower, and the sweeping vistas that you see from the hilltops, often including the surrounding bridges.\n\nIt's also a bridge out of the city to the north. A trip up the coast over the sinuous stretches of highway, the small towns with kind strangers and locally produced mustards and meats. The unexpected forest chapel, the lighthouse, the trees, the stoic rocks, the Victorian town, and the rivers. \n\nStrauss was a planner and a poet. The beauty of the bridge breaks my heart sometimes, and today my heart broke a little more. The city goes on, it lives happily without me; the winding highway north will continue to have passengers.

On the east coast Lady Liberty stands proudly in New York Harbor a neoclassical reminder of America's struggle for freedom. On the west coast we have the great Golden Gate Bridge built during the Art Deco period - a true testament of America's determination and ingenuity. Built in the 1930's it is listed as one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. I am blessed to live just a couple miles from the great Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is a giant of a bridge stretching almost two miles long and towering 746 feet tall! The \"international orange\" was actually first chosen as a sealant for the massive bridge.

And what a lovely orange it is! \n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge connects Marin County to San Francisco County - two beautiful & historic counties that are like night and day. Living so close to the bridge I see \"her\" at least once a week - and it always seems \"she\" is more beautiful than my previous visit. This landmark can be seen up close or from miles away & no matter she's breathtaking! It makes no difference if you're a liberal, conservative, or a moderate like me, spanning the bridge of democracy and hoping of a better life for future generations - this is what America should be! And the iconic bridge on the coast of the majestic Pacific Ocean reminds one daily of being American! \n\nIn the end, if you haven't been to the Golden Gate Bridge it needs to be high on your bucket list! Some might see it as the most beautiful bridge in the world. To me, it stands for the diversity of our great country and how our diversity is America's greatest strength. We can't forget about our past, our present, our mistakes, or our future. We have a short time in this lifetime.

Karl the Fog.\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge took 4 years to build, employing hundreds of workers able to handle the strenuous labor and $30M to complete, the last $6M raised in bonds issued by (now) Bank of America. \n\nIt looks different now than when it first opened: The bridge had a gentle convex arch in the middle of the span that's now flattened.\n\nCelebrating its 50th anniversary in 1987, the Bridge District closed the span for foot traffic and expected 50,000 people to show up. \n\nOver 800,000 people did and many of them found themselves trapped shoulder to shoulder while the bridge swayed and groaned under their weight, sinking 7 feet, while the north and south towers began to bend towards each other like sea grass.\n\nIt survived the miscalculation.\n\nThe second most noted suicide spot in the world, the bridge will see a suicide barrier completed in 2021. \n\nIt's estimated that over 1,500 have jumped to their deaths (almost always jumping off the eastern side facing the City) but most people think that number's far too conservative.\n\nWorth watching is the movie The Bridge, especially the story of Kevin Hines who's one of 26 survivors who jumped. \n\nInstantly regretful, he tried to position himself to hit the water feet-first which he did as a 75 mph human missile. \n\nA seal nosed him to consciousness and kept his head above the choppy, ice-cold water leading Hines to say,\n\n\"You can't tell me that wasn't God.\"\n\nTime stopped for a moment as I imagined what terrible desperation he felt to make that jump he instantly regretted once he let go of the railing. \n\nThank goodness he and others survived. \n\nSuicide Hotline, 24 hours/day: \n\n1-800-273-8255", "author": "Jennifer O."}

I was ecstacic beyond belief .. just because I wanted to see that bridge .. and mind you I am a well read man and I freaking knew it wasn't made of a golden gate and all that .. aha haha :)\n\nWe were staying somewhere near Downtown .. already astounded by the neat and clean air .. (in spite of SF smelling of weed almost everywhere in downtown the air was clean and green for us .. FYI we come from New Delhi so we know the smell of pollution :D) the route towards the bridge on that beautiful sunny day was beautiful, already made my trip so well worth it .. and we did not even go to Vegas yet hehe.\nMy first view, the very first .. and I got mesmerized and it kept on increasing .. deep blue water .. beautiful sunny day .. being able to see as far as we could have .. to be able to walk/jog on the brige .. read about it .. was absolutely surreal.\n\nAnd I'll tell you one thing - the scale of this \"Golden Gate Bridge\" could only be gauged in person. No amount of movies and all could tell you how humongous is this :)\nNo wonder it is the most iconic bridge in the world.\n\nAnd in all honesty, I will visit everytime I come to SF .. just to get the sheer pleasure from standing and looking through the bridge.\nNext time I am driving on it :)", "author": "Wasil K."}

It's probably because everyone already knows how beautiful this landmark is and reviewers had already said all wonderful things needed to be said. \n\nI entered the United States for the very first time in 1998 as a tourist from Canada. My family lives in SoCal so I spent my first few days in Universal, Disneyland, Hollywood and other tourist spots in the area.\n\nI'm sure all other first time tourists could relate that no visit isn't ever complete if you don't do the customary drive to San Francisco just to see this iconic bridge. I could vividly remember the first time I laid my eyes on it as we were driving. The feeling was so surreal to realize you're actually on it than just looking at someone else's photographs.

I have driven on the Golden Gate Bridge several times, in both directions, but never have I walked the Golden Gate Bridge.  On Father's Day, perfect weather conditions allowed for the long awaited walk across this bridge.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is very important to protect your skin.  The weather may be cool, but you can still get a sunburn.  I normally wear sunscreen, in Vegas, but for some reason, I just didn't think to do that in SF and I'm still suffering from it a week later. If you're going to wear a hat, just keep in mind that it does get windy up there.  \n\nParking is free in the Presidio area.  However, if you want that \"front' row parking, we paid an inexpensive $5.  As a tourist in SF, parking can be very expensive, so $5 is a great price.\n\nBecause of our late start in the day and a previous activity we did, we got here at 2:30 pm.  The bridge is only 1.7 miles long, but there is a lot of people here.  On the east side of the bridge are paths for the pedestrians while the west side of the bridge are for the bicyclists.\n\nIt took us some time to walk 3/4ths of the bridge. By that time, it was 3:45.  And if we wanted to have dinner together in the Mission before our flight home, we needed to leave ASAP.  We booked it on the way back to the car and it took us 15-minutes to cut in and out of the crowd.\n\nIt seems like this time of year, during the Father's day weekend, is a good time to visit SF because of the weather.  We were in SF last year and the weather was actually warmer.  Because we didn't get to really enjoy all of the GGB, it will be a must on our next trip back during the summer.", "author": "Edith S."}

The bridge has both a bike path and walking path. \n\nIf you're walking, I'd suggest to start near the warming hut cafe or even Crissy field. It's a nice, beautiful  1 mile hike.

I don't know how many pictures one can take of the Golden Gate Bridge, but it is limitless. It is a big tourist attraction, so it's always busy and hectic. It's the Golden Gate Bridge, enjoy it while you're here if you don't live here.\n\nWalking across the bridge is fun and (I guess) romantic. It's very windy, since it's next to the bay. Many people are seen wearing large winter jackets. I don't think it's necessary to wear a winter jacket though, but I'm used to the cooler weather living in the upper midwest most of my life. It was simply just windy, and it got hot real quick. I don't recommend doing your hair if you decide to walk the bridge. The winds will ruin it. Girls, don't wear skirts. Again, winds. I was pretty disappointed in that when I moved to the bay. I love skirts. It's something I had to give up.\n\nDriving across the bridge is cool, but becomes costly going southbound into SF.

It does not matter what side you start from, but walking is really only the true way to experience the bridge up close and personal. Be wary mind you of aggressive bike riders trying to complete their daily commute to and from work, to the selfie stick wielding masses (if you hit me with that thing one more time I will chuck it into the bay phone and all). Be prepared for it to be damp and cold if the fog is rolling in. \n\nWe were on the bridge in 1987 for its 50th anniversary. They closed the entire bridge to allow people to walk across on the roadway Due to a total lack of crowd control plus over 300000 people, the entire bridge sagged over 7 feet and its noteworthy curve flattened out. We did not notice anything until we got home and saw all the footage. But to be fair the designers took this into account and the bridge was designed with such and event in mind. I'm super glad we didn't know at the time however, because can you imagine the stampede if people had panicked \n\nThe Golden Gate is visible from multiple points throughout the Bay Area. For my money the best view comes from the Marin Headlands. From multiple points you can view the bridge from the Pacific side and its a perspective few get to see. If you want the end all be all Instagramable shot of all time, make the hike out to the Point Bonita Lighthouse. Its tricky to get the timing right but worth it. \n\nParking really sucks at either anchorage and while the bridge does accept FasTrak  it does charge more than other bridges and has congestion / weekend spikes. You pay your tolls on the westbound side and there are no toll takers so just drive on through. You will be billed later. Also thanks to a movable barrier that changes lane configuration based on commute flow, it is much safer driving (less risks of head on collisions)", "author": "Fred T."}

I remember as a kids police would patrol just so they could try and stop flox from jumping off.  Now they have bridge patrol to keep walkers on the walking path and bikers on the bike path and to cut down on the BAFOONERY that can happen on the bridge.  \n\nBunny likes to walk across and then back.

Did you know there are about 600,000 rivets on each of the towers.  \n\nThe bridge has an official website for this bridge and it is also a NATIONAL PARK for don't forget to get your stamp if you collect those.

Since we were going to walk across I knew to bring a jacket but it was FRICKEN FREEZIN so Bunny bought me a zip up hoodie.  Like I need yet another hoodie.  But it kept me warm during our walk.\n\nThere is a toll to go across if your driving which goes toward maintaining the bridge.  The price you pay to know that bridge will not just snap, crackle, and pop a line, nut blot or screw whilst your going over it.  They also paint in regularly to prevent rust with is the cancer of metal. Maintenance is consent as well as painting.  At one point they even had a project to remove all the lead base paint which they completed in 1995.  Today water based painted is used and if you want to know the brand of paint its Sherman Williams.  The website also has a perfect mix you can take to the store if you just have to have that color paint of your home.  THANK THE LAWD I live in a neighborhood that has home paint rules.

The most popular destination for tourists is The Golden Gate Bridge. It's a functional bridge that is well-traveled by people entering and leaving the city. However due to its rich history, it's more than just a gateway into the big city. This is one of the most photographed bridges in the United States due to the sheer beauty that it possesses. \n\nYou can't miss the deep orange hues of the bridge. On just the right day, you might think it's red! The dense fog in San Francisco wraps around the bridge during different times of the day. The fog adds a little bit of drama to its appearance, resulting in some fabulous photos. \n\nPeople come from around the world not only to see the bridge but also to travel across it as well. You can walk, bike, or drive across The Golden Gate Bridge. You'll have to pay a toll to drive across the bridge. If you have a FasTrak corresponder with an account, it's slightly cheaper. Otherwise, you can pay the toll online.\n\nSome people prefer to see it from the deck of a boat. It's not uncommon to see ships and smaller boats sailing by to give people an up close view of the bridge. Either way, from land or sea, you will be in complete awe when you see the bridge.\n\nIf you stop by the visitor center, you can pick up some nifty souvenirs. Then take a little walk outside to snap your photos. You can get some breathtaking photographs from here. Also, don't limit yourself to the visitor center. There are other nearby vantage points for you to capture that perfect shot. \n\nI love The Golden Gate Bridge because it's absolutely beautiful. It has withstood the tests of time, maintaining its classic beauty. I've traveled across this bridge a few times and loved looking straight up when I'm in the passenger seat of  the car.

If you don't park at the bottom and walk up, I would assume that the parking at top was insane(by the looks of it anyways).

It is iconic and describes one of humanity's progress on the evolution of life and science. Although the name itself doesn't really describe it well, it describes more of the history of how California got it's own start. Get your pan/buckets because we are going to cross the bridge or rather just take tons of photos of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.\n\nLocated in San Francisco on the 101 Freeway, you will notice something Red/Orange, but it wasn't GOLD as you thought it would be. The Golden Gate wasn't named because of the \"Gold Rush\", but rather the strait where the Golden Gate crosses. Still it is a perfect name to match both the spirit of California with just the name of the geological location of the Golden Gate. The Hollywood Sign and the Golden Gate Bridge both represent CA in their Southern and North Divisions, respectively.\n\nParking is quite difficult here with the many various tour buses and hundreds of cars with many guests trying to get in. While the main lot is full, there is another lot just under the bridge close to the CHP/Toll Station, where you can park and walk through the tunnel. Again, there will be a lot of traffic trying enter/exit. If you are not stopping at the Visitor Center, but simply driving through prices will vary. If you have FasTrak, it will $6.75. If you don't it will be $7.75 via PhotoToll with your license plate. You'll have a nice mile drive across the bay.\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge host millions of guests everyday and probably has one of the most photogenic backgrounds. There are trails that lead you south of the bridge as well as the infamous walk across the bridge. My wife and I had a picturesque day for my birthday weekend. We wanted to stay there together and enjoy the view on our married adventure. We saw many boats travel under the historic landmark. I have seen many bridges, but I always my home state bridge. I saw many guests take out their selfie sticks and take millions of photos as if there was no tomorrow. I saw some working out and running/hiking at the Golden Gate. Why stay in a building when you have this majestic structure as your background.\n\nThere are restrooms, but beware that there is a long line. There are two food service places to grab food/snacks after enjoying a long and eventful day at the Golden Gate Bridge. Oh yeah, you can never forget shopping at the Gift Shop. Yup, for every landmark, there is a Gift Shop. You will see a lot of memorabilia as well as Golden Gate replicas you can take home. There was some snow globes that had a fog roll in. I guess they were called Fog Globes. They were absolutely wonderful to take home since it doesn't really snow in San Francisco.\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is on the Top 10 of historic and monumental part of U.S. History. I know today we can build a bridge in shorter time span than the era of the Golden Gate, but the lives and many of the technological disadvantages of those time made it beyond belief. I hope one day that the Golden Gate Bridge may be open to walks above the bridge. You can feel the vehicles cross the road while you feel the cable wires and the wind push you around. Well, then again, the Golden Gate Bridge is powerful itself. I'd be on the wait list in an instant. Now I would be on top of the Golden State!\n\nYour Yelp Story is not just a review for some, but a story for many. You write today and share a future for tomorrow.

The Golden Gate Bridge is a glorious bridge yet magical especially if you get a chance to walk on it. Something you never forget as the views are just stunning, spectacular & unforgettable! \n\nI looked up to see what date they completed the Golden Gate Bridge as it took over 4 years to build. It was May 27th of 1937. The first day it was opened people walked, danced, ran & roller skated across it. The next day automobile traffic was then started. Wow it had just celebrated its 80th birthday. Cool! \n\nHope you all get a sunshiny day too like us! Just check the weather report beforehand bc that marine layer can sock in & spoil your pics.

So we actually took some time to Uber closer to the Golden Gate Bridge and to walk across.\n \nI had no idea how expansive the bridge truly was until our Uber pulled up closer. We first went to the Visitor Center/office to browse a little, and then we walked about halfway across the bridge and returned back. Thank goodness it wasn't a windy day! There were tons of others walking across the scenic bridge for the views, but there were actually a lot of joggers there as well who went for exercise. It felt really surreal to walk across, even if we didn't go the entire distance.\n\nWhat I also really liked is that there are many other side paths in the park so you can explore them and get good shots of the Golden Gate Bridge in the background - they may turn out quite differently from that signature tourist picture, thanks to the different angles. I got some pretty cool shots from the park paths we were on. After visiting the bridge, we were able to continue walking down one of the paths - and it was really neat. It took us past Crissy Fields and continued onto Ghirardelli Square and Fisherman's Wharf, which is ultimately where we wanted to end up for dinner. The only reason why we didn't walk all the way across the bridge was because we knew we had a long trek ahead of us to get to Fisherman's Wharf and the other sights on our agenda. One day, I still want to walk across the entire thing! On a clear day, the views are gorgeous and you can get nice, panoramic shots of the city.", "author": "Kelli S."}

Being that it's not gold, the latter seems to make more sense.  Was it once adorned in golden hues, but weathered to a rusty-red? After decades of wanting to come here, I finally made it and aside from the \"Please don't fall over, because you can't swim\" thoughts, this was pretty much what I was thinking the entire time.  But as the Bard would likely say, a bridge by any other name... \n\nSo I ignored the name and I tried to ignore the weight of the crisis hotline posting (I'm glad it's there, but these things are heavy for an empath) and focused on celebrating the fact that, through all the drama it took to make it, we were there! Not only were we there, it was a clear and beautiful, picture-perfect day.  Glazing upon this stoic beauty brought many emotions. It truly is a beautiful piece of work.  We were pressed for time so we didn't get to walk across the bridge. That means I'll need to return to SFO soon to complete that mission.", "author": "Tigra C."}

It was my first time visiting San Francisco so this was a must-see. After 3 failed attempts the fog fiiiinally cooperated with us and I was able to actually see the famous 4,200-ft red suspension bridge before leaving Fog City on July 4th. A sunny day ON the Fourth of July?! God Bless America! I couldn't imagine a  better way to celebrate America; however, the struggle to capture the moment is real. When you aren't battling the moody weather and fog hiding the bridge from view, then you will be battling all of the other tourists trying to nab a parking spot before you. Of course, there are other ways to experience the Golden Gate Bridge like walking, biking, or driving across. But my goal was to be that clich\u00e9 touristy girl who poses for an instagram-worthy photo with the bridge in the background.\n\nParking tips: Drive up Conzelman Road to find parking on the side of the road. There are several parking spaces available but they fill up quickly. Cars are allowed to park along the hillside but please follow posted signage. Patience is a virtue. If you reach the roundabout continue driving up to the left side of the road where there is more parking possibly available. Worst case scenario would be driving back down the hill to wait and see if anyone is leaving yet.  \n\nBest photo op locations: Either walk down to Kirby Cove for a chance to maybe swing (if it's still there) and get the ultimate picture OR settle for walking to the view point/vista point. I recommend snapping a pic above Battery Spencer for the more daring-wind-loving-types. \n\nNo matter how far away you parked, how long your walk is to the desired photo op spot, or how long until other people are out of your perfect shot, it will be a great feat to look back on the day you could see more than fog out in the distance.", "author": "Jennifer G."}

For the most part, you can do so year round.\n\n* While there are 6 lanes for traveling; 3 coming and another 3 going - know in advance that it's probably best you bike ride out. --- Gridlock is typically so severe that a one way trip takes over an hour and regrettably, .... swimming back does not qualify as an option.\n\nUpon ridding your system of \"Frisco Fever\" (see what I did there? I punned disco fever..... lol), you'll be all the more inept to recap on the epic beauty you've just laid eyes upon for years to come.\n\nFINALLY.....\n\n As a parting gift, plan in advance to receive a \"Notice of Violation\" within the mail as your VIN number and/or car tags are traced for failure to remit payment of the unposted/obstructed $7-9.00 toll simply to re-enter the city of San Francisco.\n\n(sighs.....)\n\nJust like jalapenos.

Construction began 1933 and opened in 1937.  80 years later, this architectural marvel has endured many things yet still stands strong!  Okay first things first... Why is it called \"Golden???\"  Cuz it sure don't LOOK golden!  Well turns out this opening that the Golden Gate Bridge spans to the San Fransisco Bay is a strait and it was dubbed Chrysopolae (Latin for Golden Gate) Strait by California Explorer John C. Fremont because it reminded him of a harbor in Istanbul (or at the time Byzantium) called Chrysoceras (Golden Horn). So definitely no golden hue is seen, it looks red, yet it's color is not even called \"red,\" it's actually the color \"International Orange.\"  Well there you go!  Never \"completed,\" it is continually being modified to strengthen its inner workings so we can continually enjoy its existence. \n\nTo visit this world renown masterpiece, it's certainly crazy during the summer.  First of all there is a dense fog you have to contend with all morning that blankets the top of the 2 towers and kaboshes any opportunities for decent pics to show off.  There's a prime time for pics and it's around 1p-6p IF you're lucky.  How do you park your car because it is insanely busy with minimal parking?!!?  Well you can Uber, Lyft, use one of those hop on/hop off tours, or have family drop you off and wait around for you. We actually found a spot in the employee parking on the West side of the bridge for $5. Yay!\n\nSo my family of 5 with 3 kids actually WALKED back and forth across entire 1.7 mile length of the Golden Gate Bridge.  YUP!!!  We were here on a Sunday so the nice thing about the weekends is that no bikes are allowed on East side walkway.  One less thing to worry about if you have kids.  With a leisure stroll it took 1hr 30 min to go south to north end because we're Asian and take hella pics. Nyahh!  Then going back with a same pace took about 40 minutes to return with minimal pics taken but still enjoying the sites.  Even had a whale siting!  So a good 4 hours to spend to fully explore the bridge, including traffic to deal with entering the area.  Fun times.  Kids didn't complain about being tired at all.

Although it was a cold and very windy day in San Francisco it was a clear afternoon and no layer of fog in sight! Parking was horrendous and we drove somewhere and found parking at the Presidio. We entered the bridge from the North end where the Welcome Center is located. The beginning part of the bridge had safety wire fencing and I love it when I see lovelocks on bridges. Took a few photos of them. That extra safety wire fencing does not cover the whole bridge, though, and it is pretty scary looking down.\n\nWe had a clear view of the suspension bridge from one end to the other with a nice panoramic view of the City, Alcatraz Island and even the Red and White Fleet sailing across the Pacific Ocean. Walked past the first tower then the second tower until we reached the Sausalito side. We were not the only ones who braved the cold, we were with plenty of other tourists, young and old, and folks on their bicycles. Beautiful views including witnessing the sun set during our stroll... we were still on the bridge when we heard of George Michael's passing. I loved the 80's and he was totally one of the icons during that generation. So sad.\n\nOverall great first time experience. Will do it again on a warmer day in San Francisco. Did you know that Golden Gate is the bridge with the highest number of suicides in the world? About every two weeks, one person jumps off the bridge. The east side, looking at the city, is more popular for committing suicide. Imagine the ghost stories... \n\nReview #0631 (and 1,475th review for the business)", "author": "May A."}

Chances of the bridge being enveloped by fog is higher in the afternoon. It can be a clear and bright sunny day but once the winds start up around late afternoon, one can see the fog rolling in from the Pacific Ocean across the bridge. Count your blessings if the day is clear and crisp. There is a $6 toll to cross the bridge in your car when entering San Francisco from Sausalito. \n\nJust across the bridge is a vista point on your right which is usually blocked off on the weekends to control traffic and crowds. One can also take the first exit just after vista point, make a U turn at the stop sign, go under the freeway, then turn sharp right to drive up the hill to get some fantastic pictures of the bridge and the city from a higher elevation. Parking is free but finding an open spot can be challenging on weekends. But the view from there is worth the drive up. While crossing the bridge, if you are in luck, you may be able to see this huge zipper machine which moves the center divider like a zipper to the left or right to provide an extra lane for peak hour traffic. If you have 2 hours to spare you can even walk across the bridge and back. Do take a jacket and water as well as sun tan!", "author": "Raj G."}

As a kid growing up on Full House, I always wanted to visit the bridge and painted ladies. This part of my trip did not disappoint and was hands down, my favorite memory of this vacation. Unfortunately, my phone decided to die right when i reached Vista point (great view point and place to take pictures), but this just gave me more of an opportunity to enjoy the moment. We got here around 4 PM and it took us a good hour or so to walk it with picture stops (3.5 miles). If you're going to stop a bunch of times and take pictures, you can spend a good couple of hours here. It's a beautiful and enjoyable walk. Luckily, it was not too windy/chilly/ or foggy out. However, the transportation was a nightmare. We did not want to deal with parking so we took the Muni. Google Maps estimated it'd be a 20 minute drive from our hotel but with all the crazy traffic and merging, it took over an hour to get here! It was worth it but it's good to keep in mind that SF traffic, especially around this area, is bonkers. The worst part was probably leaving--people are stealing taxis, Uber drives are pissed off at incorrectly pinned locations, buses are not on time, and just overall utter chaos. It took us wayyyy too long to get home but still this trip was 100% worth it. Just be sure to plan accordingly considering the transportation difficulties.", "author": "Maysa M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-22", "description": "TIPS:\n\n1. You don't have to drive across the bridge and have to pay that dreadful toll. You can park around the Golden Gate Bridge Welcome Center (you can try the Bridge Round House, the little eatery there, in your GPS if that helps). \n\n2. Parking is limited, but if you circle around enough, you will probably find something at some point. Have your credit/debit card or change available to pay. To do this, you go to a nearby machine, pay, and then take your receipt and display it through your car windshield.\n\n3. Weekends and holidays are understandably more crowded, so if you can, try to do a weekday. Even then, the place is still of course gonna be packed--it's the Golden Gate Bridge, for crying out loud!\n\n4. I think the best photo op is next to the Welcome Center on a little raised platform, but that's just me. I think you get a great view of the adjacent hills and the bay water along with SF's classic fog and the beautiful red tinge of the bridge.\n\n5. It takes me about 20-25 minutes to walk the bridge each way. It's about a mile and a half long, or 2.4 km for everyone basically not in the U.S. (and I guess Liberia and Myanmar). \n\n6. It's COLD, as is basically everywhere in San Francisco. The wind is really exaggerated here due to its super close proximity to the SF Bay. Bring a jacket!!\n\n7. Yeah, you can bike across, and you will see plenty of tourists doing so. I personally don't think it's that worth it over just walking--especially since you're dodging people all the time.\n\n8. There are bikers who seem to be regulars and locals, and for the most part, they do their thing. The past two times I've been here, though, I've had two guys (maybe it was the same guy...) absolutely scream at tourists for not staying to the right side of the sidewalk. They were really jerks about it--these people are here to enjoy the beauty of the view and the bridge, not to be yelled at by some moron who makes San Francisco look bad. I understand that you have a place to be and that these people are cutting into the efficiency of your very tight fitting cycling uniform, but realize for one second that you are biking across one of the most crowded bridges in the United States much less the world; it should be no surprise someone is in your way.\n\n9. It's kind of loud with all the wind and cars driving by. If someone is afraid of this kind of environment, prep them.\n\n10. If you're afraid of heights, you're gonna have a bad time. There are vast sections of the fencing that are about five feet high. You won't fall over unless you try, but try telling that to someone with a fear of heights.\n\n11. If you are thinking about the unthinkable, I'm here to say that there are countless resources both at the bridge--people with pamphlets willing to hear you out, countless tourists who want to get to know you and your stories, phones at select points--and before the bridge--24/7 hotlines, informational websites, people like me (seriously, message me) who care about you. It gets better.\n\nWith these tips, you too can conquer one of the best sights of the entire world!", "author": "Tremaine E."}

The Golden Gate Bridge brings the consumers (mostly drivers) are traveling this bridge to any particular destinations between San Francisco and North Bay every year; anytime. \n\nOfficially opened on 5/27/1937, the Golden Gate Bridge has promises to make it historic by giving the details and structures of this well-constructed decade-old bridge.

The materials, are never worn out which it will remains untouched for many generations to come.\n\nThe bridge is a perfect idea for riding a bike back and forth especially walking by in the bridge too, so you can do your daily morning activities in a breeze. For driving, it can be less complicated, but it does give a smooth factor as you've passed the toll plaza in a flash which you can pay the toll if the mail comes in to pay it back. Tried it after my first attempt, and I have no problems at all.\n\nSince my family and I were a tourists from Sacramento, we did enjoyed visiting to the Golden Gate Bridge for quite sometimes for the past 2+ decades. We did enjoyed taking pictures on every taken poses a lot which means it can be valuable for us in a thousand words right in our family photo album. It's endless and memorable to visit. There's also a gift shop near the bridge, so you can own the Golden Gate Bridge memorabilia at home. I did bought the GGB picture book back in 2008 which it contains full pictures of professional photographed pictures of the bridge. Very jaw-dropping to see it after I bought it.\n\nIf you want to see the bridge without passing it, there's a challenge. You can park at the nearest small lot if it's available although it gets packed, so go there early as you can. Otherwise, you can also ride a bike, walk, or use public transportation easier without the hassles.\n\nTo conclude, the Golden Gate Bridge is the most original, historic landmark bridge that California brings after established a state back in 1850.

I would recommend renting near the ferry house in the pier 39 embarcadero area and riding over the bridge to the cute little town of Sausalito. There you can grab some lunch and then take the ferry back across the bay to where you started out. It makes for an awesome day in the city. I don't remember the exact milage but I would guess that ride is about 6 to 8 miles and there are some hills so you should be in decent shape to attempt this but it is well worth it.\n\n   Now if you are a cyclist and you have your own bike, then I would say go the extra few miles to Tiburon. That's is an 18 mile ride and you can also catch the ferry from Tiburon back to the ferry house on the Embarcadero. That ride is not much more work though as the section from Sausalito to Tiburon is pretty flat.\n\n    Walking the bridge is also quite fun. You can take the last SF exit and park near the presidio and walk as far as you feel comfortable. The nice thing about walking is the slow pace really let's you enjoy all the subtle details of the bridge. You can see and feel all the rivets in the walls of the towers. You can see the huge support wires up close and touch the suspension wires as you walk. Oh and don't forget to look over the edge at the massive height. It's all just so awesome...\n\n   If you are a local or from the other side of the world, a trip across the Golden Gate Bridge is surely a memory you can cherish forever. I highly recommend it!", "author": "Mark F."}

First, of all public transportation there is the cheapest way to get there but depending on where you are an Uber isn't a bad idea. Two GGT buses would have gotten me from the Union Street area to the South Gate for about $3 in an hour, instead I Ubered (Uber Pool) it for about $7 in 20 minutes. To get to the North Side, it is about $25 + since there is a toll involved. Although I believe there are public transportation options to get to the North Gate as well. Keep in mind on some days, such as Sundays, there may be limited transportation there. So for the best views of the bridge it depends on what you are going for. Its very cloudy and foggy, especially during the Summer months. If you are lucky enough to get a clear, sunny day, go in the morning and use the eastern light to get a evenly lit view from the South Gate/Side of the bridge. You can go in the late afternoon or early evening to get an evenly lit view from the North Gate/Side. This is due to the bridge's curve. Also, be mindful that pedestrians are only allowed to walk on the east side of the bridge so again, the morning eastern light will light up the entire bridge nicely during this time. There are also many shooting spots, but some require a bit more walking (if you are not driving - I hear parking is very limited) than most. For example the trek from the South Side's Welcome Center down to the Fort Point area is a half mile walk through some dirt paths/paths which didn't seem to be well lit, so be careful going at night. There are other great vantage points on both sides which other photographers have found but many are off the beaten path in unlit and steep areas so be careful when venturing out. I would suggest you spend a few days getting different angles at different times of the day. Be safe and happy shooting.", "author": "Jason P."}

It's an icon.\n\nTo much of the world it doesn't just REPRESENT San Francisco, it IS San Francisco.\n\nI lived in the East Bay for several years, so I've driven over the bridge quite a few times, not really thinking about the significance of it.  The most memorable trip was the last one I made a year ago while visiting my old stomping grounds in the Bay Area.  I moved to Bakersfield 18 years ago and I was showing a Bakersfield native around that had only been to the San Francisco Bay area once or twice and desperately wanted to see its famous bridges close up.  We drove North up the East side of the Bay, crossing over to Marin via the San Rafael Bridge, drove South into the city via the Golden Gate Bridge, then returned via the Bay Bridge.  The Golden Gate Bridge was most definitely the Queen of the Bay outshining all the other bridges by quite a bit.\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is not golden in color, but is painted International Orange, a color that was selected because it blended so well with the surrounding hills.  It was named after the entrance to the San Francisco Bay that it spans.\n\nThis is a toll bridge, as are all the bridges that span the San Francisco Bay, but like it's counterparts it only charges  a toll in one direction, South.  As luck would have it, this is the direction in which we travelled.  I believe the toll was about $7, which is a pittance to travel across what amounts to a living piece of history.  Nowadays the toll is paid electronically so there is no stopping of any of the lanes to hold up traffic.  You can open an account online to pay the tolls or they will send you an invoice that you can pay later.  Talk about convenient!\n\nLater that day we took a day cruise around the Bay which passed directly under the bridge.  It was quite an awesome sight to behold from below, towering above us majestically.  I understand that you can park at either end of the bridge for photo ops, but I haven't done that yet.\n\nYes, you can take the girl out of the Bay, but you can't take the Bay out of the girl.

Even though it is one of the most photographed spots of all times, I think you would still impress to see this beautiful engineering marvel in person, so don't miss it.\n\nJust a few logistics :\n1) While northbound is free, southbound requires a toll that is paid only via mail. If you have a rental car, the toll is between $7.50-$11 depending on your rental car agency.\n\n2) At the south end, Golden Gate Bridge Welcome Center is a convenient, well-maintained facility with a decent view. However, the best view with terrific vantage point is Battery Spencer at the north end, but the facility is not maintained well and requires crossing the toll booth if you need to return to SF.\n\n3) Battery Spencer is the best viewing spot especially during sunrise, but to get closer to the bridge or learn some information blurbs, Welcome Center is the better choice.\n\nAnyway, no matter where you see this, don't forget to snap a selfie with the bridge!

I love any spot in the city with a view of this bridge. Going over the bridge can be annoying because of the toll and tourism traffic but it is 100% always breathtaking. I've seen the bridge hundreds of times but it never ceases to amaze me. It is larger in person than it appears in pictures and the color is repainted every few years to maintain its signature red coat (though I think the color is called orange with the paint manufacturer). I always look at it and wonder how engineers and architects figured how to make this bridge so many years ago. Most bridges are very generic looking but the Golden Gate Bridge is unique and recognizable across the entire world. I am proud to show off the bridge when out-of-town visitors come visit me in the bay area. Different areas where you can view the bridge include Lands End (good for a stroll/hike with the pups), Golden Gate State Park, Crissy Field (where E-40 performed at the free Budweiser music festival), Baker Beach (dog friendly, nude friendly beach area), Coit Tower and the opening intro in Full House (for those trying to view it at a home that isn't in SF). The Golden Gate is definitely my favorite bridge in the world (and I am living in NY now so it isn't a bias or anything!).", "author": "Brenda L."}

Not to mention all the sail boats and large tankers that can keep you distracted for quite some time if you hit the bridge during peak hours.

Might want to take advantage of that on a nice cool clear day though, possibly during the early hours of the day when it is not packed by locals and tourists alike. \n\nNow if I really had to be picky about the GGB, I'd point out the cost to cross the bridge, but I figure for the two to three times a month if that when I cross it, it is not too bad. I can only imagine that it will go up in time, but hey everything does in life so no use in complaining about it honestly. To turn a negative into a positive though, all of the years handing over quite a bit of money paid off for me when they opened the non stop lanes.

But it was clear when doing research before my trip that this was a stop that had to be made so I went along with it. \n\nTurns out bridges are pretty impressive (and humbling) and if you head to either of the look out stations (one on either side) you'll get some amazing pictures that will make all your friends envious! \n\nI had some lofty goals of walking across the whole thing, but after a long trip with quite a lot of exercise, combined with and strong cold wind I was content with getting my pictures at the look out point and calling it done.  Good thing my brother pushed me to actually walk and said he was ok with just reaching the first tower (which is a common turn around point).  Must note my brother did go back the next day after I had left and achieved his goal of walking the whole thing! \n\nSo yes, this is a MUST see in San Francisco! The look out areas have parking so you can head up there, park and walk across (or bike if you have that option).  We uber-ed so need to park, but there did seem to be some spots available.", "author": "Savanna M."}

Amazing with a breathtaking view of the city and bay. You can either walk, bike, or drive across the bridge. Driving will cost you $7, ridding a bike $4.50 - but well worth it.  You can find parking near both ends of the bridge for a photo op, a visit to SF is not complete if you don't visit the Golden Gate Bridge!  I was lucky enough to cross on a bus tour, so I was inundated with tons of cool facts, I will leave you with one...if you decide to jump off the bridge (dumb move), you will be in the air for 9 seconds, ONLY 3 jumpers have survived this otherwise perilous fall.", "author": "Chris G."}

I went on a great food tour that made a stop at Golden Gate Bridge.  I was also blessed to have the chance to run across the bridge twice while running the San Francisco marathon.  \n\nMaybe its because I am not from the area, but to me,  there's just something quietly majestic about seeing and crossing the Golden Gate Bridge.  It feels like this perfect marriage of the human spirit and human ingenuity.\n\nIts one of those things that's breathtaking no matter the weather or temperature.  It has this sleepy feel during the early morning, it also can be a bit spooky and eerie when surrounded by the fog no matter the time of day!  Then, it has a way of looking grand and stately all lit-up at night.\n\nWhat more can I say that hasn't already been said so eloquently by our fellow yelpers?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-17", "description": "I'm trying to think what I can add to the extensive reviews of this amazing SF site--probably not much other than some practical things to maybe aid a visitor.  For example, I recommend you get to the bridge the following way: Take the Bart to Powell St stop and walk to Mission and 5th by the old Mint building.  You want the stop in front of the Mint Building (the one on Mission st not 5th) and you will be looking for the Golden Gate Transit.  Now, you'll want to jump on the 10, 70, or 110 buses and don't worry about having the exact fare (about 4.50 at the time of this review) because you'll get a card with your change if you overpay (like putting in a 5 dollar bill).  The GGT buses are very nice and clean and you'll enjoy the ride down to the GGB.  \n\nOnce at the terminal on the SF side of the bridge, you can use the facilities, take some pics, or visit the shop before you walk over.  Walking across the bridge is a must-do event--it's very windy so bring a hat and jacket if you don't have a lot of padding.  Once you cross the bridge to Marin County side you can again find restrooms and water fountains to break for your return walk back across the bridge.  Hop back on the bus by walking under the pedestrian tunnel and grab your GGT bus back to Mission and 5th.", "author": "David D."}

Even though it wasn't my favorite thing we did on our trip, it's worth a stop. Here are some tips for tourists that will make your trip smoother:\n\n1) Check the webcam online for fog before you go. If it's a foggy day (which happens quite often), all your efforts will be for naught since the bridge will be almost completely invisible.\n\n2) Dress warm. It's very cold and windy, even in the summertime. Part of why I chose not to walk the bridge was due to how cold and miserable I was. I recommend bringing layers.\n\n3) Ladies, don't wear a skirt or dress! Unless you want to have Marilyn Monroe moments all day. I wanted to look nice for pictures...boy was I wrong.\n\n4) The bridge is surprisingly hard to get to if you're trying to get there on your own. The BART doesn't go anywhere near it. We had to take the BART to the Embarcadero, walk several blocks to a bus stop, and take the 10, 70, or 110 bus (the Golden Gate Transit) over, which took forever due to traffic downtown. Fare for the bus is $4.50, and they don't take credit cards, so make sure you have cash on you. The cash is loaded onto a bus card (really annoying if you don't have exact change, because what are you going to do with extra money on a SF bus card after you leave?). The whole process took a couple of hours. I'm sure there were closer bus stops we could have taken but it was surprisingly hard to find out information on it. For a major tourist attraction, I was surprised at how inaccessible it is if you're not traveling by tour group.\n\n5) Definitely consider biking across it. My boyfriend and I weren't feeling up to it that day, but upon seeing everyone whizzing by on their bikes, we were so jealous. There's plenty of places within the city to rent bikes. The Presidio is also a fun area to bike around afterwards.\n\nHope that helps people!", "author": "Katie H."}

I think of the way it was financed and the 1920 engineering involved and the great nation and leadership that made it possible - like the Hoover dam. \n\nI also think of my Dad's generation and how often they sang and danced to that song - I left my heart in San Francisco. It's probably the most beautiful city that I've ever been to. So much so that I thought about the what if's - what if my parents settled here as opposed to Chicago. Nothing against Chi-town by the way. I'd be a 49er fan, I'd be driving a Prius and working for Google, I'd be......but we digress. \n\nThe bridge is so beautiful as the waters glisten underneath it on a sunny day. Sure the fog gives it a different character. It's just wonderful to see, whether you're driving in from Lake Tahoe or coming up from SFO. Or even by foot from Chrissy field. I'd always throw in a 12 mile round trip jog from Fishermans wharf after work - there are some nice pics that you can take from Fort Mason. \n\nThere are also a bunch of nice views from all the vantage points. Especially while you're having dinner from one of the piers. To really enjoy the bridge, I'd park and walk the entire length and back. The cute little gift shop is a lot of fun too. If you are fortunate, you'll see the workers actively fixing the bridge. Heck, come back often, it's a great place to reflect.", "author": "Gerry T."}

I had not visited the Golden Gate Bridge since I was a young child, but those distant memories paled in comparison to what I experienced while driving across on this crystal-clear day.\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is considered by many as one of the top ten construction achievements of the 20th century. This amazing steel suspension bridge, which was built in the mid-1930s, spans the Golden Gate strait, which is a one-mile-wide, three-mile-long channel between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The bridge links the city of San Francisco to Marin County to the north, via Highway 101.\n\nIf the weather is clear, you can look off to one side of the bridge and see the city of San Francisco and Alcatraz Island. Off to the other side is the Pacific Ocean. The views were simply breath-taking. On many days this bridge is shrouded in fog, and the long, lonely blasts of the foghorn are the only thing reminding you that you're near the water.\n\nDepending on time of day, the traffic can be a bear, but just relax and realize that you're on the freaking Golden Gate Bridge, Dude!\n\nFun facts that you should know about the Bridge....\n\n* The famous International Orange color of the bridge was originally used as a sealant for the bridge, but the bright orange color became popular, and is now available for sale from Sherwin Williams Paints.\n\n* The architects of the bridge drew their inspiration for the Art Deco design elements and the graceful suspension design from the Manhattan Bridge in New York City.\n\n* On the south side of the bridge a 36.5-inch-wide cross-section of the suspension cable, containing 27,572 wires, is on display.\n\n* The movable median barrier between the lanes is moved several times daily to conform to traffic patterns. On weekday mornings, traffic flows mostly southbound into the city, so four of the six lanes run southbound. Conversely, on weekday afternoons, four lanes run northbound. During off-peak periods and weekends, traffic is split with three lanes in each direction.\n\n* And as my dear friend Michelle M. pointed out in her review, this is the 2nd most popular suicide spot in the world. After a fall of four seconds, jumpers hit the water at around 75 mph. Most of the jumpers die from impact trauma. *SPLAT*\n\nPlease enjoy this marvel of engineering and tourism for what it is, and leave the high-diving exploits to the professionals.", "author": "Steve E."}

Between the parking lot and the bridge (which is a quick walk) there are many great photo opportunities. \n\nMy friend Flor and I walked to the first stanchion (we had a lot to accomplish in a short amount of time, and she told me that walking the full bridge takes about an hour), and took advantage of some wonderful photo opportunities. \n\nBasically: the bridge is a SF institution.

I've lived in California all my life and of course been to SF, but never went on the Golden Gate Bridge. Crazy, right!?!\n\nIt actually wasn't even a planned trip to go on it. We were going to Muir Woods and didn't know we had to take this bridge to get there. Lol. Yeah, we don't look @ directions till we leave the house. Also the people I was with, thought there was another way to get there besides going on the bridge.\n\nWell one of my things got checked off my to do list. This bridge is amazing. I know it's just a bridge, but just riding on it and thinking of when it was being built to how much it has gone through, and also how it's one of the top 10 bridges to see, ever! Yeah, it's sorta kinda something big and to be excited about. \n\nYou could also take a walk on there too or ride a bike. There was a lot of people walking. Families, kids, tourists, crazy traffic on that end. I really want to take a walk on here so I could get pics of the ocean and also say that not only have I rode on here in a car, but also walked on it too.\n\nSo, when coming from the SF side you don't pay the toll then, it's when you are heading back from say Muir Woods or just that side is when you pay. However I guess they don't charge on the weekends cause we didn't pay the $7 that was required. We just went right through the paying booth. So yay for the weekends and making my first time worth wild lol.  \n\nOnce again, it's a MUST to see!!", "author": "Akemi H."}

Biking the bridge was one of my very favorite adventures during our 3 days in San Francisco.  The weather is constantly changing- I was hot when we first started but then it got cold on our return over the bridge, so I am glad we stuffed jackets into the bike pouches. I had a baby seat attached to my bike carrying out 3yo. My husband rode with a tandem kid attachment with our 6yo and our 8yo had his own bike. It was the perfect set up.  It was quite busy, even on a Wednesday in November and although the path is striped for pedestrians on one side and bikers on the other side, some people were completely oblivious (stopped taking photos in the middle of the path) and it was tricky to mauever at times.

On a clear day, it's nice to check out the view of downtown and the rest of the city. Lots of people crossing with their bikes or walking around. \n\nIt's nice to see boats crossing under the bridge with their sails and the tour boats full of tourists taking pictures.

It's one of those things that you'll have to see for yourself to really have an appreciation for it. Words and pictures will never do justice to its beauty. \n\nMy girlfriend and I figured the best way to experience the bridge without having to deal with parking and traffic was to bike across it. We started from near the fisherman's wharf and mostly rode right by the water, on the San Francisco Bay trail, past the Palace of Fine Arts Theatre, and up to the bridge. Going one way, it was about 7 miles or so, to the north end of the bridge. Make sure you wear some kind of sweater or jacket because the winds were extremely strong as we rode across. There was a separate lane for bikes and pedestrians, which was nice and convenient. \n\nOnce you get closer to the bridge, you start to see how enormous of a structure it is. I mean it is gigantic. Truly a marvel of engineering. From it, you get a very nice view of the city, the bay, and alcatraz island. The gift shop is nice with lots of touristy goodies. \n\nIf you want to experience the bridge another way, I highly recommend riding bikes across it.

As an SF resident I have had many chances to witness this beautiful landmark. \nOn foggy days you can only witness parts of the bridge, usually missing the top of the bridge which creates a mystery feel to it. During the day,\nMany people either walk or bike across the bridge to the Marin lands.\n\nMy walking experiences were often morning jogs but it's generally busy with tourists. They close off the bridge by sunset to pedestrians but cars remain open to cross. At night the bridge is lit up as a beautiful master piece. There are also various spots in the city to capture the best angles of this bridge. Parking is limited but there are buses such as the 28 line to run pass it for your convenience. \n\nAs for driving across it... It's $6 on the way back into SF and tolls you by capturing your license plate.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-02", "description": "Yelp Review #1,300\n\nBottom Line:  My 1,300th review goes to the Golden Gate Bridge because it is an engineering marvel, a historic landmark, a symbol of progress, a memorial to sacrifice, an American icon, a cultural hallmark, a facilitator of recreation and an unrivaled scenic lookout.\n\nIn the early 1900s San Francisco's Ferry Building was not a cornucopia of cheese, bread, wine and vegetables; rather, it was a bustling ferry terminal for people and cars traversing the bay between the city and Marin County. Thanks to the industrial revolution and Henry Ford, a bridge to connect the West Coast's busiest city with Marin County across the San Francisco Bay was much needed.  A bridge was so high in demand that Bay Area citizens used their homes and businesses as collateral for construction of the bridge. The bridge was not just any ordinary bridge but it was an amazing feat of civil engineering.  The 4,200-foot main span between the two towers was the longest for a suspension bridge until 1981 and the 746-foot towers made it the tallest bridge of any type until 1993.  Construction 200 feet above the choppy bay and in a windy straight was not easy and 11 workers sadly fell to their death. \n\nFast forward 80 years since the 1937 ribbon cutting ceremony and the Golden Gate Bridge is just as popular and photogenic as ever!  Thousands of cars, cyclists and pedestrians cross the bridge every day and the bridge continues to stay ahead of trends with its 100% electronic tolling system.  (Even if you don't have a FasTrak transponder they will send you a bill via a picture of your license plate). The bridge is one of the most photographed structures in the world and thanks to being featured in television shows and movies like Full House and Terminator, it has become a subject of pop culture.\n\nFor the best experience, skip riding in a convertible with the Tanner family and walk or bike the bridge.  The bridge is surprisingly great for recreation because there is only a moderate incline to get on the flat bridge from San Francisco.  Additionally, the bike lanes and pedestrian access is separate from vehicular traffic via concrete barriers for safety.  Traffic on the bridge does make it noisy so immerse your senses in the smell of the salty Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay and the sights of the pristine Marin Headlands and the dazzling City by the Bay.   The views from the southern access to the bridge (including the Visitor's Center) and the bridge itself are amazing but even more incredible are the views from the lookout on the northern access to the bridge.  A great way to enjoy the bridge is to bike from San Francisco across the bridge and then coast downhill into Sausalito to take the ferry across the bay back to San Francisco.", "author": "Courtney K."}

I didn't remember much at all from any early visits.\n\nThere are few bridges in the world that cause so much interest and two of them are in the U.S.A.\n\nIt's easy to dismiss the bridge as just a bridge.  Plenty of people think the same of the Brooklyn Bridge.  I've driven across a lot of bridges, most of which are made from concrete and steel and don't look very interesting because they're just bridging the gap.\n\nSeeing the underside of the bridge, I was amazed at the engineering involved to absorb shocks.  Above, on the bridge, it wasn't just about traffic, but people celebrating their visits with their friends and family.  It seemed quite special that people would feel so much just then.  Could a bridge engender warm feelings, as though it had wrapped its visitors in a cozy blanket?  It seemed so.\n\nSure, you can bike on one side, and walk on the other, and drive between the two, but is it just a structure for transportation, or has it become more?", "author": "Nobuyuki S."}

We took time to look at the displays on the South side of the bridge before going back over, and it was nice to find out some of the history of the bridge.

We who have labored long are grateful. What Nature rent asunder long ago, man has joined today.\" -- Joseph Strauss on Opening Day, 1937\n\nThere are so few monuments in the world that are so iconic that they are instantly recognizable the world over; the Statue of Liberty, the Pyramids, the Eiffel Tower, and most certainly the Golden Gate Bridge (GGB) can be mentioned in that same breath. Growing up in the Bay Area I had taken for granted this amazing, functional Art Deco masterpiece because that stuff is for tourists, right? Wrong. I recently had a new found appreciation for the GGB when I walked across it with my out-of-town cousin and my 4-year-old, and I got to relieve its majesty through their eyes. It really is something else, and don't let the \"I'm too cool to do touristy shit\" attitude get you, because you'll really be missing out. Everyone knows, or has heard, all the usual \"fun facts\" about the GGB, like 600,000 rivets in each tower; 1.7 miles long; towers are 746' high; etc. Well, I dug-up some really cool little known facts--just for you! Enjoy.\n\n-The GGB's paint color is actually called Orange Vermilion (aka International Orange), and was *not* meant to be the final color--which was most likely to be carbon black or steel gray. It was a primer that was applied to protect the steel; consulting Architect Irving Morrow came to like it, as he felt it gave the GGB a more visible look in the fog and complimented the local topography. The military actually wanted it to be painted in stripes, but that's another story...\n\n-\"Only\" 11 workers died during the building of the GGB, which was a safety record at the time. Bridge builders just assumed there'd be one death for every one million dollars spent on a project (35 workers was the anticipated total).\n\n-The GGB is the top suicide location in the world with over 1,500 deaths. This topic is explored in the 2006 documentary \"The Bridge,\" which I've seen and highly recommend. This film is so controversial that the GGB website won't list it in their database of documentaries about the GGB. \n\nThere's a multitude of ways to view the GGB, but I'd have to say my favorite is via Crissy Field (http://www.yelp.com/biz/crissy-field-san-francisco-2?hrid=rPxhJO6TYPuOUqESIOo5Kg) and I highly recommend walking and not driving, but there really is no \"bad\" way.

With it's goldish/orange color it can be seen from miles away on a clear day. This amazing bridge opened May 27, 1937 and celebrated it's opening for a whole entire week! A day before automobiles were allowed to cross this bridge an astonishing 200,000 people either walked or roller skated across, can you imagine all those people?! This is a suspension bridge which held the record for being the longest one of it's kind until 1964. This bridge not only takes you from the San Francisco Peninsula to Marin County but also spans across the 3 mile long channel between the SF Bay and Pacific Ocean.\n\nI've lived in the Bay Area pretty much my whole life and I can count on one hand how many times I've driven across this bridge. I've always seen it on TV and in movies, heard great things about it and would see it while visiting San Francisco.  It wasn't until adulthood and my own curiosity that I finally decided to drive across to see what the hoopla was about and wondered where I would end up. (Mind you I drove by San Quentin and discovered the Richmond Bridge my first time going over the Golden Gate lol). Driving from SF over the bridge you do not have to pay toll which is a plus but on the weekends traffic getting to the actual bridge and going across can be a little slow. It's so beautiful, you can see the beautiful bay, see all the locals and tourists walking across and taking pictures all while trying to take in the amazing color and architecture of the bridge. Some say this is the most beautiful and most photographed bridge in the world and I would have to agree. I absolutely hate going over bridges but this is one bridge that excites me when going over it.\n\nI have yet to walk across the bridge and this is something I'm anxious to do but on a clear summer day so I can take in all the sights and all that the bridge has to offer. The walk across is most definitely an item on my bucket list that I would like to cross off sometime this year! I must say if you live in the Bay Area or in California period and you have not visited this landmark then you are really missing out. Driving across, walking, biking, skating or all of the above are great ways to enjoy the bridge.

There's a parking lot at the end of the bridge and you only have to pay on weekends. When I went, it was a gorgeous November day, but quickly turned into a gloomy winter night so bring a jacket... you will freeze your butt off!! Walking across the bridge was a quick and easy walk with a gorgeous view. Took us about 2 hours to walk back and forth and apparently, the only thing to look forward to at the Sausalito side is the bathrooms so hooray! Though we took a while, of course we did all the touristy things like look down the bridge, and take our touristy pictures. One for the scrapbooks!

It take \"FastTrack\" SEVEN WEEKS to send invoice, by which time I've left country.  I get back 3 months later to huge fines. I GOT FINES WAVED MAYBE YOU CAN TOO:\n\nHERE'S HOW TO CONTEST/COMPLAIN BY PHONE...  (they make it seem impossible to talk to a person, but follow these instructions in office hours and you will get a person)\n\n* call \"FastTrack\" on 1-877-229-8655\n* say 'english' or press 1\n* say 'other information' or press 5\n* say 'questions' or press 2\n* do one of the following, (depending what they mailed you)\n  - say 'invoice' or press 1  (if you just got the invoice)\n  - say 'violation' or press 2  (if you got a violation notice)\n  - say 'notice' or press 3  (if you got a collection notice)\n* (listen through all the stuff about contacting them by web email) THEN \n      - say 'representative' or press 0\n* (they ask for your \"account number\" - ignor that)  \n       - say 'representative' or press 0 again.\n* (they ask you to verify that you want to speak to a representative) \n      - say yes or press 1\n\nThe nice lady waived my \"Violation\" fines - because I complained that it took them 7 weeks to send FIRST INVOICE - by which time I'd left the country for 3 months, and there was no way i could have known I was even invoiced. I also went on about all my other complaints - bad signage, how was I supposed to know what \"FastTrack\" means - whey cant they use plain englsh like \"Call this number to pay your Toll\", why not offer a place to pull over and get a leaflet on how to pay the toll, or offer a box to put your name and address in, so they can send an invoice out right away etc etc.\n\nGood luck!  After you have dealt with your \"Violation\" fines\n\nTHEN COMPLAIN about your bad experience DIRECT TO GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE OFFICE   1-415-921-5858\n\nThe more time \"FastTrack\" and the Golden Gate people have to spend on complaints by phone, the less cost effective it is for them to have such a crap system, and such poor signs and so little assistance for visitors.\n\nI think that they shoudl pay me a \"VIOLATION\" fee for every extra day it took them to send an invoice after the first 48hrs.  Now that would be real accountability!!\n\nTHE BACK STORY:  Horrible confusing badly designed toll system.  I looked everywhere for information as I approached the bridge. couldnt see it.  later told I should have called FastTrack 511 or something, but \"FastTrack\"? doesnt that mean something about commuters? I'm not a commuter, I'm an out of state visitor.  It didn't say 'CALL 511 TO PAY YOUR TOLL\" Why not?  how hard is that? I could have pulled over right after the bridge and done that.   I just went to Google StreetView to see if I can see all the \"signage\" they claim I sailed past.  Nope. I will post the one feeble sign that I see on Street view, positioned on an on-ramp to 101, with lots of tiny writing, and NO INSTRUCTIONS - barely visible even if you take time to look at it on your computer on the google photo, let alone driving past it in traffic.\n\nLike I say, couldn't figure out what I was meant to do to pay - I'm an english speaker, I'm not too stupid to follow instructions.  There were none.  Wondered if perhaps it would be electronic by plate.  No idea. Doesnt say \"We'll snap your plate and send a bill\" nothing. \n\n9/16/15  I cross (violate\"?) the bridge .  \na few days later I get home to Oregon and never hear from them.  \n10/21/15 I leave the country  (37 DAYS AFTER CROSSING BIDGE). By now I've assumed it was a no-toll day or something.\n11/2/15 SEVEN WEEKS AFTER I CROSSED THE BRIDGE an invoice was generated and mailed to me.  YES that is the date ON the invoice.  Not the post mark. But I'd left the country by then, so never saw it.\n2/4/16 I return to the US  to a stack of VIOLATION notices, making me a \"VIOLATOR\"??  and I now have $149 in fines.\n2/5/16 I call in per insturctions above and complain and get the fines waved.  I pay the Toll.\n\nSo When I call the Golden Gate people (number above) that the invoice is dated 11/2/15.  Golden Gate people are soooo surprised that the invoice was sent soooo late (I read on yelp that this is common) and say it SHOULD NEVER have taken so long, they will \"Look into it\". \"Something went wrong\" he said.  \n\nThe \"FastTrack\" woman said it took so long because I live out of state, they have to contact the DMV in my state for my address, and that takes weeeeeks apparently.  APPAULING - they are wasting my Oregon Tax money bugging Oregon DMV for addresses?  I would have gladly just dropped my address in a slot for them if they offered the option.  I'm also going to contact Oregon DMV and tell them to stop wasting OR tax money on processing these CA requests - CA is saving money on toll operators and then shifting costs to OR and other state DMVs to do the work for them.

The American Society of Civil Engineers considers it one of the seven wonders of the modern world.  Regardless if you agree, there's no doubt it's a beautiful, marvelous, and awe-inspiring structure.\n\nIf you want to get photos of and with the bridge, the two best places to do it are:\n\n1. Golden Gate Bridge Pavilion: http://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-gate-bridge-pavilion-san-francisco\n2. Marin Headlands in Sausalito: http://www.yelp.com/biz/marin-headlands-sausalito\n\nBoth locations are public and free, and also provide free parking.  Note the pavilion's parking spaces are rather limited.\n\nThe pavilion and headlands offer excellent, unobstructed, and stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge.  The pavilion is directly attached to the bridge, so head there if you'd like closer shots of the bridge and/or would actually like to walk the bridge.  There are less tourists at the Marin Headlands and you get a more top-down and wider end-to-end view of the bridge from there.  Whichever location you choose, you can't go wrong -- there's no denying the bridge's beauty.  If interested, you can read my reviews of the pavilion and headlands for more information.\n\nWhile the weather in San Francisco is oftentimes unpredictable, the best time to view the bridge is probably in the afternoon.  By then, typically the fog has lifted.  The sun shines more favorably (towards the bridge) in the afternoons at the pavilion.\n\nThe bridge is 1.7 miles.  It takes 45-60 minutes to walk across.  If you plan to walk it, wear layers.  It's windy and can get chilly.  A windbreaker is advisable.  You can also bike across.

Whenever I'm in the city, I have to stop by and visit the Golden Gate Bridge at least once. \n\nThe breathtaking views of the bridge can be experienced from afar, but nothing compares to walking on the bridge and feeling the chill from wind that passes through. If you keep walking you can feel the bridge move up and down and sway side to side depending on the wind and the vehicles zipping by. You can drive across the bridge and get a nice view of the city's skyline, but don't forget to bring some cash to pay the toll when you return back to the city. http://goldengatebridge.org/tolls_traffic/toll_rates.php\n\nI would have to say my favorite view of the bridge is when the fog that envelops the bridge slowly dissipate to show the bright color of the bridge. It's like watching the sunrise as the bridge slowly becomes more visible. \n\nIn my last visit, I tried a free walking tour of the bridge to learn some of the history. I highly recommend taking SF City Guide walking tour. http://www.sfcityguides.org/desc.html?tour=35  It's free and all they request is a small donation. I'll write more about SF City Guides later. I learned a lot from the tour, the bridge's color is International Orange, it is over 75 yrs old and the 2nd longest suspension bridge in the world. There was also some controversy in the building of the bridge. People have committed suicide on this bridge so you will see signs posted warning people not to do so. \n\nThere's a visitor center, parking and public restrooms available.

Parking wasn't a problem as there was plenty of it, skies were pretty clear, and the area was moderately packed. We took advantage of walking through the bridge and it was a relaxing and fun experience.\n\nParking:\nGoing on a weekday, I did not have trouble with parking. Though there was plenty of it, I can see how it can get packed on a weekend. \n\nAmbiance:\nExtremely peaceful. It serves as your typical park and on the occasion, I know events are held near Crissy park. The cars aren't too loud when you pass by.\n\nFeels: \nThe walk back AND forth to the Golden Gate Bridge is 3.4 miles. It definitely gave me a lot of reflecting time about life and the whole entire city, like how this bridge got constructed, why are there a lot of suicide rates on this bridge, and all these other things. Not the most peaceful walk because of car noise but definitely a one you can reflect and have bragging rights.\n\nOverall:\n4.5 stars. I am amazed how hundreds of tourists come by here each day. I can see why, with the aesthetics of the structure, the view, and the thousands of shows/movies it has been featured in. I would have gave it a five but I witnessed a bike collision and it was not pretty. The victim was mildly injured and as much as I wanted to help the person, there was nothing we really could have done, not even call the ambulance. If the bike and pedestrian paths would be completely separated then that would make it safer for everyone.\n\nAdvice:\n* For a chance of clearer skies, come around October or November...if you're lucky December\n* Wear warm clothes, it gets pretty windy\n* If you want to bike, If you are headed towards Marin County, research on how you can start on the left side. Sharing the road with pedestrians can drain the fun from the ride, also even dangerous.\n* BEST PLACE to take a picture in my opinion-head towards Marin County end of the bridge to take a picture there.

At the plaza, on the bridge, from both sides, and from the socks below in both sides. Just gorgeous.

Other times, the traffic can be horrendous (like yesterday when there was an accident and there was only one northbound lane), but I realized it gave me more time to appreciate the beauty of the Golden gate. \n\nI have yet to walk or bike across the bridge, but I hope to walk across it one day. Being from SF, I've haven't done a lot of touristy things. Driving across it yesterday, I realized there's a reason the Golden gate is one of the most photographed bridges and an iconic symbol of SF. It's beautiful! I'm glad I live in the city and can appreciate the Golden gate on a daily basis. \n\nSide note: They no longer have toll takers (which I was kindly reminded of when I came back from Napa last week without my FasTrak!) so I believe the prices are the following when entering the city: I think pedestrians and bicyclists are still free.\n\n$7.00 - Pay by plate\n$6.00 - FasTrak\n$4.00 - carpools during peak hours, FasTrak only", "author": "Elena N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-23", "description": "Beautiful San Francisco Landmark - The Golden Gate is Spectacular and a Must-See!\n\nMy mother and I visited the Golden Gate Bridge on the morning of July 30th. \n\nWe took the BART from the Mission District, where we were staying in an Airbnb apartment, to Civic Center. From there, we rode on a Golden Gate Transit (one-way fare was $5.25 USD) which dropped us off in the parking lot of the Bridge's Welcome Center. The Golden Gate Transit operates buses #10, 70, 92, and 101, which all take you to the same place at the Bridge. \n\nWe arrived at the Bridge shortly before 9 AM and there were only a few other people there. The atmosphere was peaceful and relaxing and it was nice to be able to have almost the entire area to ourselves. \n\nThere was some light fog covering the top portion of the Bridge, but it was still largely visible and beautiful! \n\nFrom the Welcome Center, we walked the Battery East Trail, which was a gravel path that winded through some beautiful and lush vegetation down the hill where we eventually ended up at Crissy Field. Shortly after walking the trail, we arrived at a small open area amongst the trees with a few picnic tables. The views of the Bridge from here were fantastic and this was a great spot for photo opportunities! We then continued walking along the trail which had a tunnel going through a small hump/hill in the path. We finally ended up at the bottom of the hill at Crissy Field. After taking some photos of the Bridge from this area, we continued walking along Marine Drive, which was bordered on one side by a tall rocky cliff (where the walking trail is on top of) and by the Bay waters on the other side. It was a gorgeous street! \n\nAt the end of Marine Drive is Fort Point, which is a historical building that is open to the public. Unfortunately, we did not explore the interior of Fort Point (but are planning to next time we are in SF). The views of the Bridge from up close at the dead end of this street were beautiful and picturesque! We also narrowly escaped getting splashed by some huge waves that were coming off the Bay, while taking photos! \n\nAfter exploring the area at the base of the Bridge and admiring the views from these places, we hiked back up the walking trail to the Welcome Center parking lot and then made our way to the Bridge, where we walked across the beginning portion of it. The Bridge was so huge and impressive when I was actually on it and it was very high, so the views of the surrounding city and Bay were amazing! At the beginning of the Bridge, there was a telephone and a sign with a crisis telephone number posted, for those needing help and potentially considering suicide by jumping off the Bridge. It was quite sad to see this and tragic to think of how many people have ended their lives here. \n\nAlthough we did not end up doing this (but are adding it to the list for next time), you can rent bicycles from a few different local companies to ride across the Bridge to the other side, where the small and hilly Bayside communities of Tiburon and Sausalito are situated. \n\nI found the that the best views of the Bridge that provided the best photo opportunities were from the picnic tables located at the beginning of the Battery East Trail (from the Welcome Center), Crissy Field and Marine Drive/Fort Point. You can also view the Bridge from Baker Beach. \n\nTo avoid the crowds, visit the Bridge in the early morning (approximately 9 AM). \n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is an spectacular and iconic landmark in San Francisco and it is definitely a must-see when you visit the city, regardless of how touristy and popular this attraction may be. After seeing the Bridge in many TV shows and movies, it was so amazing to be able to see and experience it in person. Absolutely stunning!", "author": "Brittany T."}

If you go on the website for the bridge, it will suggest that you take mass transit to the bridge because there is limited parking. Ignore that advice. While it is true that there is not much parking right by the entrance of the bridge, there is plenty of parking at Crissy Field which is right below the bridge. On the weekend, parking is free before 10 AM and very cheap after that time anyway. Since I was still on East Coast time when I visited, I was one of the first cars at the parking lot and got a spot right next to the walking path that leads you directly to the bridge. Crissy Field also provides an excellent view of Alcatraz. If the weather is good, I definitely recommend walking across the bridge. When you reach the Oakland side, you can stop at Vista Point which is great for photos. It provides an excellent view of the San Francisco skyline and Bay. The round trip walk across the bridge will take about an hour.\n\nIf you are visiting San Francisco and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews.

Fortunately, it happened right as I was passing by the toll plaza. I immediately pulled over out of traffic and in to the employee parking lot to inspect the damage. Within 1 minute (I kid you not), a bridge patrol car came to my rescue. I didn't even have to pick up the phone and call AAA. It's like they magically appeared out of nowhere. The officers made a quick call to their roadside service guys, and in less than 2 minutes, a truck was at my side to replace my tire with a spare. \n\nIt was 10:30am and I had an 11am mtg in South of Market. There's no way I'm going to make it in time, I thought. But lo and behold, the guy fixed my tire in 5 minutes flat - free of charge. I was back on the road before I knew it... and I even made it to my 11am mtg with 2 minutes to spare.\n\nI can't thank the Golden Gate Bridge Patrol enough. They were total lifesavers. I got a personal glimpse in to where our bridge toll money goes. Thanks again, guys!", "author": "Kevin B."}

The bridge itself is an amazing architectural feat, so it was neat to see that up close after having viewed it from afar as we toured San Francisco earlier in the day. The views from the bridge are equally stunning, as you get views of the city, Alcatraz, and just beautiful ocean and mountain scenery. \n\nWe were very lucky that it was a clear day when we visited. Some days it can be incredibly foggy in this area, so keep that in mind! There is a small museum area on the San Fran side of the bridge where we able to park for a small fee. There was also a nice little gift shop available too. \n\nMy party walked about half way across the bridge, but it would definitely would have been simple enough to walk the whole way. Obviously the bridge is flat, so it's not incredibly strenuous. It goes with out saying that you are at a high elevation, so it would not be great for anyone with a fear of heights.

It's WAAAYYY to packed.  \n\nI've been to SF a couple times now and never been to the bridge or taken a pic with my gf there.  I was determined to this time, but unfortunately we went on the wrong day.  I thought we would be slick and get there late in the afternoon on New Year's Day.  Apparently everyone else had the same idea because it was super packed at every look out point we went to.  \nWe decided to try again the next day.\n\nMuch better.  It was about a quarter the amount of people at the look out points and we got a perfect picture overlooking the bridge and bay.\n\nif you are going from SF, travel over the bridge and take the first exit to the right.  There is a look out point as soon as you exit, but I didn't like that one.  Continue down the exit and make a left at the stop sign so you go to there other side of the freeway to the better look out points.\n\nYou can go very high up on the mountain, but I think the best ones are the first two you pass up.  Any higher up and you loose the city and bridge in the background.  \n\nBe smart and go up to the turn around (not far past the second point) and make your stops on the way DOWN the mountain.  It is very difficult to try and make a u-turn going up the mountain, plus extremely rude to the people behind you.  Yet, not surprisingly, there are plenty of people who try and do this.  Yes you may have to wait a minute since there aren't many spots to park at the lookouts but usually people move quickly.  \n\nStop, admire the scenery for a minute, take a cute picture and move on.  It is definitely worth a stop and picture but be aware there are a lot of other people attempting to do the same.", "author": "Robert A."}

Driving on it is one thing. Walking end to end? Certainly a very good experience.\n\nI started my walk from the Sausalito side (by the Vista Point exit) and proceeded to get some so-so pictures. Depends on the time of day that you go on the bridge, the fog and lighting tends to affect picture angles. On the SF side, there is a larger pavillon and better opportunity (in my opinion) to get better pictures. Why? You are closer to the downtown area to photograph the skyline, and you are able to get a better vantage point of both GGB towers. The results in taking pictures from the SF were outstanding in picture quality.\n\nIf there is one thing that I didn't particularly like about the Golden Gate Bridge, its with the attitude of the cyclists. I'm not talking about the casual bicycle rider either. I'm referring to the Lance Armstrong wannabees that push tourists around with their griping. The bridge has its designated bike lane + walking lane (on the right) and while I cannot blame the cyclists for getting mad at some tourists that meander into the bicycle lanes a little bit, there are other cyclists that come remarkably close in knocking someone down despite the walker being in the correct lane. There were three occasions where a cyclist bumped me when I was walking on the right side. I couldn't understand why there were cyclists racing on the bridge when there was an incredible amount of tourist traffic walking on the right side on this day. At the time of my walk, it was between 11:30 AM and 1:30 PM, and the other side of the bridge wasn't opened yet.\n\nMy opinion for the city of SF or whatever authority that manages the operation + upkeep of the bridge: keep the left side of the bridge open (the side heading northbound into Sausalito) for cyclists only and the right side open for tourists and casual bicycle riders during touring hours. This will certainly help prevent any cyclist-tourist transgressions or accidents.", "author": "Eric T."}

I was amazed when I finally got up to the bridge that there were 3 lanes in each direction, yet NO TRAFFIC at all going southbound. It was clear all the way from Sausalito to the toll plaza.

It's super impressive when someone says \"we ain't goin' to be changin' the lanes tonight or on the weekends & if you don't like it, you can go on our website to complain\".

You can capture the magnificent bridge with the San Francisco skyline and the Pacific Ocean in the background.  You can also spot the infamous Alcatraz from certain points.  The views are magnificent on a clear day and slightly mysterious on the foggy days.\n\nA dark fact about the bridge: this is the 2nd most popular spot in the world to commit suicide.

It's what connects mainland California to San Fransisco (or at least, the quickest route). As far as the \"awe\" factor goes, GGB is pretty cool. There is usually a lot of traffic and pedestrians on the bridge at any given time during the day and it is a very big structural bridge. That being said, it is just a bridge, and an extremely busy one at that. Not knowing your local routes can cost you upwards of an extra 90 minutes to cross it heading east. Yes, 90 minutes. It is just so congested and unpredictable that the frustration of its logistics hampers my rating. Overall though, GGB is still one of the most beautiful sites of not only California, but the United States. If you come to SF, you must check out GGB!", "author": "Adam S."}

What can I say? I did my research prior to the trip and isn't a bit of fun fact heaps of 'fun'?\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge links San Fran to Marin County and it stands  between the bay and the Pacific Ocean. Now.. Most of you might say: alright yeah yeah whatever but I love that... the fact that if you're standing on the bridge and facing north, you'd be looking at the Pacific by turning your head to the left and the the bay by looking right. I find this 'significant', don't you? It's like say you went to Invercargill in NZ and you went all the way to the southern tip, facing south; you'd be looking at the Antarctic, with only miles and miles of ocean ahead until you reached Antarctica. Come on, this has got to be exciting, right?\n\nAnyway, where was I? Oh yes, the Golden Gate Bridge is not just a bridge, it's a symbol, a wonder of the world. I wonder if Strauss, Morrow or even Ellis ever imagined that it'd be such an internationally recognized structure when they designed it? \n\nIt's very touristy yes and you'd expect it to be anyway but it's a must-see if you're ever in San Fran. Cross it if you can (it's about 3 miles long but I did it and it was awesome!), it's a  amazing feeling, you'll get stunning views of the bay and you can also feel the vibration patterns when you're on it... Yes, you heard right, the bridge displays vibration modes which means it shakes but there's nothing to be scared of, it's meant to do that as it's a suspension bridge. \n\nThinking about it now, I remember seeing locals running and others biking along it, which was really cool. I know I would go for runs along it if I lived in San Fran - certainly beats running along princes park!\n\nThere you go guys..

I understand it makes traffic flow smoother, which is good, or would be good, if the rest of their system didn't suck so bad.  It also may or may not work ok for people who have a standing account.  But for the majority of people, here's how it works:\n\nYou drive through with no opportunity to pay.  In the old days, it was 10 seconds, and you're done.  Now, you have to wait for mail, and hope that doesn't get lost in the shuffle.  The mail arrives a month after the crossing took place, and has less than 2 weeks before the due date, after which the $7 crossing will be $25.  \n\nThere are 2 \"payment options.\"  Online or phone.  Go online, enter their 13 digit invoice # (really, does it have to be 13 digits?  How about making it your license plate plus a number, or something easier to deal with?)  Get to the invoice page, click pay by credit card, enter info...discover system is broken.  It will not take a payment.  Try different computer, browser, thinking, \"surely it's not really broken.\"  Yes, it's broken.\n\nCall to pay by phone.  It's a weekend.  They only work business hours.  There is no return envelop or payment by mail option.  Try to make a note to call them while working.  \n\nWhat once took 10 seconds, now takes 10 minutes, if everything goes right.

Whenever I have driven along this bridge, it is gloomy and cloudy - typical San Francisco weather. But on rare occasions, it's sunny and even more beautiful. The drive is just lengthy enough to get great pictures but not too long to feel bored and annoyed. It overlooks the bay and Alcatraz, that creepy islander prison. \n\nThis is a great spot to take pictures or go for a bike ride like I see a lot of people do along this bridge. You can even go for a stroll and walk it while still getting great photos and a work-out ;) The only thing that sucks is the toll you must pay to come back into the city but you should just get used to it because most bridges have tolls in NorCal and I wouldn't be surprised if they started doing that to freeways, ugh. Anyway, a great tourist attraction and place to visit while in the bay area.", "author": "Alicia H."}

I have changed my ways and try now to \nlook at things from a higher elevation. Although I have been occasionally driving across this bridge for over 40 years, the thought of reviewing it was not on my radar. For most of the world (remember there are over 7 billion of us) the Golden Gate bridge is something they have never seen, or at best seen it in a movie or TV show. So lets take a short look at one of the engineering marvels of the world. The American Society of Civil Engineers call it one of the engineering marvels of the world! Wow that sounds big. It was the longest suspension bridge in the world till the Verazanno Narrows Bridge was build in 1964. What caught my eye was it was built under budget and on schedule. That to me goes beyond amazing for a project as large as this. It is always a wonderful walk, or drive. It is spectacular to see both up close and afar. If you come to San Francisco, it is a wonderful walk or drive. There are spots on both sides to park and enjoy a stroll. The picture overlook on the north is wonderful, and there are many spot on the south as well. Any way you slice it, the Golden Gate bridge is something to look at, walk on, drive on and enjoy during your trip to San Francisco.", "author": "Charley C."}

That isn't even a real color, bridges aren't allowed to invent color names. It's smaller, has less cars, and is younger than the Bay Bridge. I grew up in Marin, went to school in San Francisco, and commuted to San Francisco for several years, so I have probably crossed the bridge a couple thousand times, and it sucks just as much every time. Even worse, they have a monopoly on SF/Marin transportation. The same people that run the Bridge also run the Ferries and Buses! You are all pawns in their game! \n\nTL/DR: Golden Gate Bridge = Comcast with a better marketing team.", "author": "Jordan A."}

I didn't care if I walked or biked across, as long as I crossed. However I walked, jogged and biked across to the other side a few times. I love this bridge. I love that's it's a historical landmark that I can now say I've explored. I love that it almost scares me being on it because I am so high up and I love the amazing views of SF that I've seen. \n\nBiking over the middle can be sort of a pain because of all the foot traffic (you can ride on the opposite side, but you don't have great views) but once you get to about the middle of the bridge, you're clear. There are designated lanes for walkers and bikers, but of course the walkers take over. \n\nI loved coming here on Saturday/Sunday morning or riding at dusk. I really love this bridge with its gorgeous red/orange rustic aesthetic charm. I never understood any of my fellow students or people that could live in such a beautiful culture enriched city and have never visited the bridge. Shame on you!", "author": "Court S."}

Their website is horrible, and it has been the third time that it has been horrible for over 9 months. My wife has had the same terrible experiece. If you don't enter a time before crossing and a date and time \"after today's date\" (listed as optional, but it is Not optional, and doesn't mention that it needs a future date), you cannot continue.\nUsing their automated phone system takes 5 to 6 minutes, and if you ever accidentally enter a number incorrectly or choose a wrong option that is not available, it immediately hangs up on you. So you better get your credit card right, and you better get your invoice number which is 12 digits correct the first time around as well. To be precise if it only catches 11 digits it hangs up on you, and if you forget to press the pound sign for 3 seconds after entering your credit card number it hangs up on you, and if you incorrectly enter one of your credit card numbers, it hangs up on you. \nAnd if you pay your toll on time,  you sometimes get charged for your toll again, and if you do not pay again even though you did not cross you will be heavily fined. And if you dispute the fine, they will only charge you two tolls instead of one.  The price of noticing that they have made a mistake is the same as the price of a second toll.

The pathways to the bridge gives you access to plenty of areas where you can take a photo with the bridge in the background. You can also see Alcatraz island from bridge!

When I moved to the Bay Area in '94 I believe the toll was $3.00, and now it's $6.00, and they want to raise it even more.  They of course need more money to spend (80 million) on the feel-good project of building an ugly suicide barrier that will prevent people from jumping off of the bridge, but will do nothing to decrease the overall rate of suicides.  This has been statistically proven at other places.  Someone who is in that mindset will of course find another way to end their lives.

That being said, I have a couple of tips/observations if you are planning on that:\n\n- I highly recommend taking a bus into the beginning of Sausalito, which is just on the other side of the bridge. I am betting that walking the length of the bridge once will be more than enough for you (as it was for me, and I'm all about walking several miles).\n\n- this will allow you to walk back into San Francisco on the bridge. This seems like it would be a much more enjoyable experience. The half closer to Sausalito is nice and quiet, as most tourists give up at about the half way mark from San Francisco and turn back. So this way you get to really enjoy the bridge, and by the time you get to the halfway mark, when you are about sick of it, your fellow tourists will all be in the mix to really make you sick of it and ready to get off the bridge. By that point, you will already have basked in the beautiful scenery and would have taken all the requisite pictures, without a bunch of annoying tourists in the background of each picture.\n\n- even if you don't mind cooler temperatures, you should at least bring a light long sleeve garment. It gets pretty chilly with all of the wind.\n\n- watch out for the extremely annoying bicyclists. There is bound to constantly be one or two trailing right behind you going at a snail's pace since it's clearly a bad idea to bike the bridge as it's so packed.\n\nI wish i had known these things ahead of time, as it probaly would have made for a more enjoyable experience. So you would do well to heed my advice if you are reading this, since I am pretty sure you are planning to visit the bridge if you are looking up reviews for it on Yelp.", "author": "Mike C."}

Of course, we stopped to visit the Golden Gate Bridge - what better way to tire out a bunch of rowdy teenagers than to make them walk almost two miles? Walking across, a few of us noticed the crisis counseling signs; we knew their purpose, but suicide was a distant concept in our minds - something that happened to other people, but not to the young and invicible. A close friend took a picture next to one. She had a history of trauma and self-harming behaviors and she thought it would be funny. No one laughed, but we understood that sometimes, those who suffer in darkness try to make light of the situation through jokes; perhaps you can laugh the pain away, or if you can demonstrate your ability to joke about the issue, then maybe the weight of your pain can't consume you. Teenagers do not understand much of the world, but there is something hopeful in their naivet\u00e9.\n\nMy second trip was in the summer of 2014; a lot can change in seven years. On my first trip, the bridge was mostly covered in fog, but I felt like a radiant ball of energy, glowing with youthful hope. Life was beautiful and I was so lucky to be there. The second time around, there was no fog to be seen except the fog found within. I had lost most of that lustre; no longer did I radiate positivity. Now, I was a black hole, consuming everything around me - no light could escape once it had crossed the event horizon of my spinning thoughts. The clear, sunny sky could do nothing to clear the fog in my mind. I walked and came upon that familiar blue sign, informing me that there was hope. Hope was a foreign word those days; I had hope, but not in any conventional sense. I hoped for a painless ending, a way out - I had the kind of hopes that one does not normally vocalize during polite conversation. \n\nIt was a beautiful day and yet the urge to climb over the railing was ever present. I walked quickly, eyes cast down, and made it to the other side without incident. I would be tempting fate by walking across again, but it had to be done. I paused at the sight of a yellow phone. I would not make a call, but I would look at it to serve as a reminder of the time I did not give in to desire.\n\nI recently read an article that interviewed a few who have survived the jump. The consensus? \"Everything in my life could have been fixed, except for that I just jumped.\" This is a daily reminder that others have felt this way, too. Others have made the same decision and, still, in that moment, found that they had reached the wrong conclusion. Everything is temporary; the Golden Gate Bridge may spend much of its time swathed in fog, but it still has its day in the sun.", "author": "Courtney W."}

And for good reason.  The bridge architecture is stunning and the views of the city from the bridge are absolutely incredible.\n\nAs a first time visitor to San Francisco, this was a must-see for me.  My boyfriend and I walked across the bridge and took tons of photos - it was a blast!  When we arrived, it was still a bit foggy, which looked really cool.  As we walked along the bridge, the fog burned off which gave us 360 views of the area - amazing.  Once on the other side, we visited the Vista Point and also hiked up a large hill and explored part of an old fort (possibly Fort Point?).  At the fort we experienced some of the best views of the bridge and took the opportunity to fly kites in the strong winds.  It was pretty surreal to fly kites with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background.  \n\nYou must visit the Golden Gate Bridge when in San Francisco - it is practically a requirement! - and I would recommend taking a bus (Golden Gate Transit will take you directly there) to get there because the parking is incredibly limited.

We were traveling from San Diego to Alaska and just had to marvel at it.\nAs a private pilot I would fly over it and turn my wing down, so I could look down at the traffic.  Really stunning from any angle.\nMy favorite picture is of an aircraft carrier passing below the golden gate.  The meaning and symbolism of it still echoes with me...  The ship, passing out of the gate, to go protect freedoms we enjoy within it.

Until recently, I'd never crossed the Golden Gate Bridge (nor had I really gotten a good look at it). Turns out, when I've come to the city by the bay (whoa whoa who-o-oa)*, I've gone east. Turns out I've spent more time than I've realized in Berkeley. That's what happens when you're friends with a bunch of smart hippies. In any case, I was again in SF but this time I was heading north. For the first time. This meant, 'the Golden Gate Bridge.'\n\nAs I realized that I was finally going to experience this iconic modern marvel, I began unexpectedly excited. It's one of those things. You may have seen these engineering wonders in books or on TV but to experience them up close & personal is a moving experience. I smile crept across my face as we neared. The bridge itself is majestic, imposing and beautiful. But adding to the experience is the electricity of the crowd (it's always packed with tourists, locals, commuters, runners, and bikers), the grandeur of the water, the lush invitation of the North Bay's verdant splendor, and the clear skies (not gray or foggy like I imagined) that allowed me to fully enjoy the experience and take many many pictures. 'It's just a bridge; big deal,' some might say. And, I guess that's sorta true. But when you step back, look up and attempt to capture the perfect image to be preserved forever on your camera, the history, cultural significance and wonder of the bridge cannot be denied.

The Gate is often socked in with fog, especially in the mornings. This can make it a bit frustrating. There are plenty of places to get some good shots, but my favorite is in the Marin headlands. Exit after the bridge (on the Marin side), hook a left at the stop sign & park in the 2nd lot up. There is a small hike that will get you those breathtaking views you can't get from the city.\n\nShort on time? There is also a speedboat (the Rocketboat) that leaves from Pier 39 and takes a spin around the bay. You can see the bridge from the water.", "author": "Maureen B."}

I was also surprised on how well that job paid and that unlike my white collar job, when his shift was over, it was really over. \n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge Toll Plaza is a bit dated, but I'll never get tired of the payoff of a view no matter which direction I'm traveling. My most memorable experience was actually walking through the Toll Plaza that one early morning in May of 1987 when the Bridge was opened up to Pedestrian Traffic. There were so many people on the Bridge with me that the road bed flattened, cables swaying freely, and there was no way I could walk completely across. I also still have the commemorative stamped postcard that they handed out at the center of the Bridge on that day. \n\nHere are few other tips:\n\n- From my East Bay perspective, it's cheaper on my Fastrak budget to drive clockwise. For example, I often drive into the City on the Bay Bridge and sometimes leave via the Golden Gate. That's 1 Toll as opposed to 2 if I came into SF via the Richmond-San Rafael and Golden Gate Bridges. \n\n- The best driving view of the Bridge and the City is Southbound just after you come out of the Waldo Tunnel. There's also an exit just before the Bridge for Marin Headlands options.\n\n- For views on foot, there are lots of choices. My favourites are the view from the Marin Headlands (especially at Hendrik Point) and underneath at Fort Point. \n\n- Never drive North or South Bound in the far left lane. For me this is too close for comfort regarding the possibility of a head-on collision. \n\n- By all means, walk or bike across the Bridge!  And if you're game, continue on to Sausilito.", "author": "Eric B."}

To see the GGB from any place in the Presidio is worth taking the 200 or so stairs from one of the trails. There are other routes to take and well guided with signs. Just don't take the stairs at days end. Believe me, my legs HURT once I climbed all those stairs! One single \"turn out\" area. LOL.\nI've never parked on San Francisco side to get to GGB, I find it easier to park on Marin side.\nAlways windy and always beautiful! You can cross the bridge in about 45 minutes. Now keep in mind that every 50 feet you'll be taking another picture of the Bay, so depending how fast/slow you walk/ride is up to you. I suggest you take your time and also remember to look down. Sometimes you'll be lucky enough to spot a porpoise pod and a sea lion or two. Of course lotsa sail boats and ferry boats too.\nI would advise you go early in the am to cross the bridge, less foot/bike traffic. Lotsa runners at that time though. Even if the fog is still rolling out to sea...by the time your ready to go back across it'll hopefully be sunny!

However, the more I reflected on my experience at The Golden Gate Bridge, the more I realized I needed to let other first time visitors know how to use the bridge! \nFirstly, this is a TOLL BRIDGE. You cannot cross it for free. Secondly, you cannot stop at the toll booth to pay the toll. You will get yelled at on a loud speaker and may cause an accident if you try to stop. Simply drive through and a camera will take a photo of your license plate, you will get a bill in the mail for the toll in a week or so. The toll is $6 to cross into the city of San Francisco. If you are a regular visitor, you can set up an online account and pay easily. \n\nThis is a crowded bridge and the last exit in SF always seems to be congested, so be prepared to wait in traffic if you try to \"abort mission\" prior to crossing. \n\nEven still, it's the Golden Gate Bridge. 5 stars because it is gorgeous, iconic and you fail at being a tourist if you don't visit this landmark.", "author": "Julie S."}

Straight ahead, dead on. No ifs-ands-or-buts about it.\n\nAt this very moment, the bridge lights are just barely visible through the evening sky. Two moments ago, I checked the view to see if any ships were passing through in the evening twilght. There weren't any. Ships that is. \n\nNosedivers (they say) usually take the port side  for exit into the water below. That would be the side facing us. The theory is that they are looking toward the hills. Hoping for that last human contact. \n\nAt dusk, I often say a brief matins for them, the poor departed souls. Try to give their wandering spirits rest. Its the least an East Bay girl can do for those who dream of greater fortune than they are able to acheive.  Try to give 'em the peace they seek. Tell them that the 510 folks will love 'em just for themselves.  \n\nWe are like that on this side of the gate.  Open to possibilities. Without judgment. Humble. But proud. \n\nMy favorite memory of a ship passing beneath the Golden Gate was when Queen Elizabeth (that would be the English queen, and not one of her namesakes on Polk Street)...Queen Elizabeth sailed under the bridge on her way to her first official visit to SF. \n\nActually, it was a visit to Silicon Valley, but SF grabbed the headlines. That's the way it is around here, you can live in San Jose, El Cerrito, Novato...but few will know where you are from unless you mention San Francisco. \n\nI digress.\n\nQueen Elizabeth was coming to town. I thought it would be fun to see her arrival from \"on high\" so I grabbed Muni's 28 bus to get to the bridge. Of course, the bus got stuck in traffic just as it arrived at the toll booth. SO..there were four or five of us who got ringside seats. Above the crowd...watching all of the pomp and circumstance *beneath* us. \n\nAs best I remember, our motley crew included: \n\n1.) The bus driver, who had been a Black Panther in his youth. This being from his own life-tale. \n\n2.) A reporter/photographer from some important newspaper like the SFExaminer.\n\n(Examiner? \"How the mighty have fallen\" )\n\n3.) A fellow on his way to Clement Street. Wearing a beret. Might have been IRA. Perhaps a Green Beret. I'm not sure. \n\n4.) Me.  Student in the Poli-Sci masters program at SFSU. WIth a host of uppen-coming fellow students. All wearing blue jeans. All hoping for tomorrow. \n\n5.) Possibly...a sleeping drunk who had climbed on the bus on Lombard. He saw nothing. Said nothing. But (of this I am sure) was somebody's son. \n\nBeing stuck in the bus, as we were, we chatted. Entertained each other with various tales from our pasts. Spent a good half hour watching the world from our bus...a regular Ship Of Fools. \n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge, in her majesty, kept watch. Over the bus, the crowds, the Queen of England. \n\nIn those days, she didn't need painting...her International Orange created just the right backdrop for our retinue. Contrasted beautifully with the green trees, blue skies, and frothing whitecaps below.\n\n(I am referring, of course, to the bridge rather than the Queen. )\n\nT'was a fine moment which will be hard to forget. \n\nAnd the bridge now? \n\nLet me look. Just as I thought. There's a little ship heading out to sea. Its almost eclipsed by the beacon from Alcatraz. But not quite. \n\nThe bridge lights are still shining brightly. As they should be.", "author": "Dorothy C."}

The people I come with, the atmosphere, the weather...it's different every time and it makes me proud that I'm a San Franciscan.\n\nIt is $6 to drive across the bridge (pay towards SF), yeah you heard right, SIX WHOLE DOLLARS. Ages ago, it was only $3 & that seemed like a jip back then.\n\nHow much San Francisco can you get from the bridge??? LOTS, you can see Alcatraz, Bay Bridge, fleets going by, Downtown area, radio tower...don't look to the side if you're driving, FOCUS on driving. Yeah, it's hard not to look at so many attractions but your safety & the other people's safety around you are more important.\n\n3 lanes going to Sausalito, 2 lanes going to SF.

The Golden Gate Bridge is the only sight that leaves me in a trance, memorized by its beauty.  \n\nWhat I love about this bridge is its ability to leave one breathless at almost any point its viewed from.

Sail under the grand bridge, and you are instantly overwhelmed by a sense of endless possibilities, and a new sense of self for those who have forgotten.\n\nWe natives can often take this symbol of America for granted.

Anyway, it was one of the most amazing experience I have ever done. I biked the bridge down to Sausalito and took a ferry back, and all I could say is that it was perfect beyond words. The scenic view is amazing. There were uphills and downhills which I found it hard since I am not an expert but other than that, it was a smooth way. My advice to those who are planning to bike the bridge to wear their helmets because the way is narrow and hitting your head on the huge metal beams on the side can be very dangerous. One thing we didn't do. We didn't realized the danger until we were up there biking and saw the other bikers with full gears.

I mean what kind of chump goes to San Fran and NOT stop to walk this epic bridge. Thankfully it was a sunny and warm day when I did this because I realized 2 things while on here:\n\n1. I still had very much a healthy fear of heights. \n2. That fear is magnified by the fact that there are some strong ass winds on this bridge. \n\nThat being said I steeled myself and walked across. Going was fine, I couldn't help but notice all the phone boxes to crisis hotlines while I was going across. I mean that's a harsh way to go if you want to off yourself. It's a long way down and I was told constantly by people how the Bay does not get warm at all, so if the impact of the fall won't get you hypothermia will. Sorry if that was a bit morbid.\n\nIt took me almost an hour to get across but in all fairness I did stop several times to admire the amazing views. It really is lovely up here. If you had just the view of the city without the sound of crazy speeding cars and the treacherous wind at my back I would almost say it was serene. \n\nDefinitely felt a sense of accomplishment when I got to the end. However, there were a lot of people on the other side waiting for buses back so impatience trumped my fear and I ended up walking back too. The ocean side wasn't open to pedestrians but I did notice that bikes were allowed on that side when I was coming in on Sunday. Definitely would be a nice ride if you get the chance.

Haha.\n\nBig deal, right? For me, yes. LOL. For the average San Franciscan person... you're probably like meh, it's a toll bridge that's big, orange, and pretty.\n\nI've always admired the bridges of the San Francisco Bay Area for their beauty and for their amazing engineering. \n\nMy biggest fear, wasn't the height at which I'd be traveling over the water, but was not being able to stop at the other end of the bridge to take a photo and just admire the bridge up close. Thankfully, it was a not-so-busy mid-morning and we were able to hop into the rental car and drive on over to the Marin Headlands.\n\nGoing Northbound towards Marin County and Sausalito was more of an awestruck feeling that I was actually traveling on the Golden Gate Bridge, the second bridge I've been on in the San Francisco Bay Area (the first being the San Mateo Bridge). On the way back it was just the same, happy feeling that I'm going back into San Francisco by way of this beautiful bridge.\n\nTOURIST TIP: If you're in a Rental Car like me, and you're planning to travel Southbound on the US101-S by way of the Golden Gate Bridge, I recommend that you Prepay your tolls in advance to the Golden Gate Bridge Transportation District (goldengatebridge.org) to avoid video tolling convenience charges + undiscounted tolls charged to your rental agreement. Tolling on this bridge occurs only on the Southbound (way into SF) and it's fully automated/cashless.", "author": "Daniel B."}

Every time I see it, every time I walk or bike across it, the bridge inspires me to never take San Francisco for granted.  From the perfectly clear San Francisco days where anyone upon its gentle arc can see forever and a mile, to the eerie hours when it is concealed in its entirety by billowing hands of fog, the Golden Gate Bridge is the single most evocative icon in a city full of them.\n\nIf you are a cyclist, like me, then you may get the chance to watch the sun set over the Pacific Ocean from the bridge's western side.

I have to say, I did not bike, walk, or drive this bridge as others have; I did the typical stupid tourist thing and took a double decker bus.  It was one of those hop-on, hop-off tour busses that you can pick up down by Fisherman's Wharf (or in a lot of other spots in the city, actually). \n\nTwo tips;\n1) Go sit in the top/open part of the bus.  You get a 360 degree view and get to really get the full experience.\n2)It's colder on the bridge (at least in Spring) than anywhere else.  I swear the temps dropped 20 degrees just while we were on the bridge. \n\nThe good thing about the tour bus is that it goes over the bridge, then turns around and comes back.  If you missed it (for example, if it was foggy) or if you didn't take my #1 tip and were sitting inside the bus, you get a 2nd chance. \n\nI got lucky and was able to get several good views out over the water (the fog blows in and out rather quickly; keep your camera ready, or keep your eyes peeled).\n\nRecommended.  If you don't go, everyone will ask you how you could have made a trip to San Fran and not seen the bridge!", "author": "Ken L."}

I wish it was more like the Brooklyn Bridge (NY) where the ped/bike activities are in the middle of the bridge but its not. Also, the lanes aren't that wide so be careful. The railings on this bridge are short so YOU CAN fall off if you don't pay attention (tall bike riders on the ped side).\n\nThey have significantly improved the bike trail from the bridge into the city so you can bike across the bridge from Marin into the visitor center to Crissy Field and into the city. Its definitely an intermediate ride into the city. Kinda windy and creepy hearing the big rigs pass you but it is on a path.\n\nThere are many visitor areas that can be accessible to the bridge. \n-The Presidio in the city has one where if you hike onto the path under the bridge (yeah you go under the bridge) you end up at the main center. \n-There is also the original visitor center that has a gift shop and piece of an old span but the parking there can be crazy and its metered.\n- Or like me...you can park on the Marin side (exit Sausalito)  for free and walk on the bridge. \n\nViews of the Bridge:\n-Or you can view the bridge up high and go on that same exit ...drive further and view it from the headlands. \n-Crissy Field\n-Or of course Baker Beach (Pursuit of Happyness beach)\n\nEither way, its a beautiful sight of nature, architecture, engineering marvel and a perfect view of the city...with clear sky or a little fog.", "author": "Trishia P."}

Come on now! Even if you're right at the toll plaza it takes like 5-10 min to get on the bridge. If you're travelling from the other side of town, getting to the GG is one long , sometimes convoluted drive. To this day I still don't know the \"optimal\" way from say, SOMA. Depending on traffic conditions, I usually try to find my way to Franklin and then snake my way  to Bay, then hit the bridge. Ok I'm digressing.\r\n\r\nAs hard it is to get to sometimes, it's definitely a must do. For a long time I thought it was too touristy for me and on constant suggestion from my Mom, I finally decided to give in and take the walk across with her. It was a beautiful day, I had a lot of time to kill, and honestly it had been a while since I had a chance to bond with my Mother.\r\n\r\nSo we take the drive across the city and it turns out it's going to be a clear day.  As clear as it was, I knew it was going to be cold on the bridge, and make no mistake, I was prepared with the requisite jackets and pullovers . You know who makes mad bank in SF? The dude that sells the \"I heart SF\" sweatshirts for God knows how much to the tourists that show up to the GG in their short sleeve polo shirts, khaki shorts and sockless loafers. Suckers! \r\n\r\nI must say that the group of people that assembled here was one of the strangest  and diverse I'd seen. I guess such a landmark would bring the tourists from every cross section of the world. My favorite was this huge bus that pulled up and unloaded a bunch of  Japanese tourists. I swear they had 3 cameras each, took a gazillion photos in like 5 minutes and then hopped back on the bus. Not sure they really \"experienced\" anything but they definitely will have a lot of pix that will substitute for memory.\r\n\r\nSo my Mom and I finally make the leisurely trek, caught up on things, and let the rest of the world move in slow motion around us.

Second, it's a beautiful structure apart from being a bridge, which is something I didn't appreciate until I got close up.  And third, it's something that amazed me with it's sheer size and the engineering challenges that must have been overcome to build a bridge in such a geographically-difficult area in the 1930's.  So I was glad I went.  \n\nNote that it's a little difficult for tourists to get to by public transportation.

I have gone for a walk, stroll, tour guide and showing family, and friends to many time to count. For me the experience is exciting, and never gets old. The view can be limited at different times, because of the San Francisco weather that changes so fast. The morning can be covered in fog, where the bridge is not visible at all. Then later in the after noon, its beautiful and clear. Then again within a half hour, you have a mist on you with fog rolling in so fast. But from land, air, being on the water, or from the lookout area, its a must to see! The beautiful bridge herself, I love so much! When you walk around the bridge area plan for at lease an hour, depending on how fast you walk. There are statues along the way, along with plaques explaining the history of the bridge. You can see an area, where it shows strands of the actual cable used on the bridge, bundled to suspend the road. I have enjoy walking, and exploring the whole path areas around the bridge also. Remember to dress in layers because being close to the bay, usually can be windy and weather changes from one extreme to the other. San Francisco Bay is known for great sailing, because of Bay winds.

This is certainly not the place you'd go for anything other than a casual run because no one understands - pedestrians to the Right, bikes to the Left. It is a total cluster! but you can't beat the views. It is by far one of the most stunning runs I have had. The Sausalito side is beautiful, although you have to pay to get back across if you drive over - I highly recommend crossing over and exploring from that end.", "author": "Candace L."}

I came here a few times before but my mom and siblings never been here so I suggest we take a walk across the golden gate bridge for experience. It was cold and slightly foggy when we got here. It was sunny at first but the wind and fog started creeping in. We took a stroll with the kids took a family picture and afterwards we went down so we could look across the ocean and let everyone bask in the ocean breeze. I would recommend coming here in SPRING/SUMMER for a warmer experience. I also like how they put the biker lane on the other side because before we had to walk and there would be bikers zooming through it made it unsafe, but they fixed that problem and its safer to walk on the bridge without getting ran over by a biker. Theres also an area where they built so kids and adult could just chill and read the exhibition area. Its pretty neat the place has change with and upgrade but the same bridge experience. So if your looking for something to do come and walk the goldengate bridge check out the great view watch the cars go zooming thru on the highway and just take a stroll.", "author": "Mary S."}

I remembered the time I was just a little girl watching Full House and dreaming of seeing that landmark. And where I grew up, that was looked up as a \"dream\" to live somewhere else or to travel. Though my individual family never had such life views with limits, many kids growing up in a poorer community have that view. If I would have mentioned that I wanted to see this bridge as a child in school, for example, I would have been laughed at. \n\nIt's a visual masterpiece from the detail of the rivets to the cables to of course its colour. I love how the temperature changes to a crisp cool when you walk towards the middle of the bridge, even amidst the nasty heat wave that was occurring during my 3rd visit this past weekend.\n\nIt's a pleasure to walk the bridge as you can create photographs from a different perspective than the from one of the viewing areas at the end of the bridge. One thing to note is that it will be very LOUD as the traffic is always heavy. A semi passed by as I walked with my bestie and we nearly went deaf. Traffic was heavy every time I visited so that is something to note if you are headed to Sausalito, for example.\n\nIt really is a beauty and I will never tire of photographing it. I look forward to seeing it and walking it again.", "author": "Trudy H."}

Flash forward to 4 years later; I was back in town for the holidays visiting friends and being an amateur photo enthusiast, I had one mission for a beautiful Fri afternoon...shoot the bridge from bother the north and south ends. \n\nOne nice thing about the bridge is they have made it pretty tourist friendly.  With a few parking lots on both ends, you can park if its not busy and walk the entire length of the bridge on either the Pacific Ocean or Bay facing sides, taking in the amazing vistas of the city and the bay.\n\nThe only downside I can say is access to the bridge from the city end cannot be done entirely from freeways.  For out of town tourists, be warned, the 101 freeway will turn into local roads forcing you to drive thru several blocks of city streets before it turns into freeway again leading to the bridge.

The crowd really thins out about 1/3 of the way across. We were lucky enough to see a cyclist get a ticket from a cop on a bicycle for speeding.

One cannot think of the city of San Francisco without this bridge. A good sign of this fact is all the souvenirs.\n\nOn our most recent trip (april/may 2010) , my husband had one wish- to walk on this famous bridge. Parking was a challenge. There was lots of construction around, that our GPS system could not detect (this was a first for me too). I think we made it around three times until we found an open spot. Since there was a race going on, the parking fee was waived. There were numerous tour buses with tourists. There was a crowded public restroom. We stopped in the little gift shop as well. As with all souvenir shops, the prices were high, since it was situated at a landmark.\n\nThere were some vista points along the way where we stopped to take pictures. We walked along the entire length of the bridge but did it again. It was sunny and windy but it quickly got warm with all the activity. I had to shed the layers. There were lots of active people on both sides of the bridge- runners, walkers with dogs, and cyclists. There were lots of commuters as well. (I think that I've been on this bridge a handful of times when I lived here- not much.) It was nice to finally say that we did this- it's funny, how many things you do not do as a local.", "author": "Margret C."}

Well whatever here it is for the record: THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE IS AWESOME.\n\nIt's one of the most iconic parts of California. First, look at if from a far, like from Fisherman's Wharf or Coit Tower, take your pictures, and then actually go to it. If you have the time, bike it because you'll get a much better perspective on how big it is, but if not, driving it is almost as good! So, so much fun. When we drove over it as part of our road trip, Amanda and Crystal made up a song about it and it has forever been stuck in my head. Golden Gate Bridge...

It is on the San Francisco side of the bridge and it is at the base by the water...you are basically standing just feet away from the structure.  I do not have an exact address but just ask someone how to get to Fort Mason Point or put it in your GPS.   \n\nThe other spot and my personal favorite is on the other side of the bridge.  Most people when they are driving North on the bridge away from San Francisco pull over at the tourist point on the right side as soon as they get to the other side of the bridge.  Keep driving and exit the first freeway off ramp following that point. I believe it is Alexander Avenue but I could be wrong...just make sure to exit the freeway right after the official lookout and turn left.  At this point go back under the freeway towards the West and follow that road up and around.  You come to a fork in the road, make sure you go to the right and up the hill....I could not tell you exactly how long but after a couple minutes you come to a lookout point.  You should be able to tell because it is where everyone tends to park.  You then walk up a small hill (maybe 5 minutes) and come to the most AMAZING view of the bridge.  It makes for great pictures of both yourself and the bridge.\n\nDon't worry, if you drive past this point a couple minutes later you will come to a point at the very top of the hill where you need to turn around...and if you do that you get an amazing view of the bay.\n\nIf you want specifics on this spot just send me a message and I can give you a little extra info.\n\nWhile the toll for driving across the bridge may cost you a couple bucks it is totally worth seeing an amazing piece of art that says San Francisco more than anything else.  \n\n:0)", "author": "Eric N."}

THE Golden Gate Bridge!!!\n\nVisiting this architectural triumph has long been on my bucket list, and my most recent vacation to San Francisco provided the opportunity.  The best way to experience this bridge is by having someone pick you up and actually driving across it.

Yes, you can always rent a bike and do the touristy thing...but this particular weekend I was in luck.  \n\nMy best bud Simon was in town and picked us up from the Sir Frances Drake for some sight-seeing.  After having a scrumptious breakfast at Stacks, we headed north to the big bridge.  Traffic wasn't bad at all for a Sunday afternoon.  \n\nWe've all seen movies of this bridge--it's internationally recognizable--but absolutely nothing will prepare you for the grandiosity and magnificence of this architectural landmark.  it's truly breathtaking.  \n\nI'm not exactly sure what route we took after crossing the bridge, but we ended up at the ideal location for a photo op.

But the best thing about it is it's majectic crowning of the entrance to the SF Bay. On looks alone it is 5 stars a dozen times over. \n\nOriginally the GG Bridge was meant to make Marin an easily accessed suburb of SF. But add a bridge access to a big city- you know eventually it will be a major freeway access. And a major traffic pain in the ass. The first time I rode a motorcycle across was terrifying thanks to the wind. I was positive I was going to be blown into on coming traffic. Another death defying experience is being on the bridge at the same time as either someone who is drunk and swerving or is a tourist and is trying to take pictures while driving (drunkenly swerving though sober). There is always two idiots on the bridge each time I cross. One going 22 miles an hour, one going 82 miles an hour. \n\nThe toll is fanatstic (not), as are the fines for going too fast (which is what 51 miles an hour?).. But for me the best part of crossing the bridge in January is the fact that I always get to see at least half a dozen tourists in shorts, short sleeves, dresses, high heels, and roller blades attempting to cross. It's cold out there morons!! Dress for the snow!! I love to snap pictures of the under dressed tourists rather than hope to get a decent shot of SF. Much more fun- especially seeing the expressions on their faces as you take their pictures!! :-)\n\nAnyways, I had to take away a star for the fact that any good 30 sec earth quake could swing the GGBridge right into the bay..

Once we got there, there were 3 times more cars than parking spaces. The same went for the restrooms. They smell like septic! Yes, I do know what septic smells like. Once I fought off a dozen other tourists for a parking spot and lined up with 2 dozen other men for a spot in front of the potty, I did unload a serious amount of liquid while sucking in what I believed to be extremely toxic fume. (imagine the line on the ladies side) Coming from the rectum of America, I think I will promote new jersey back up to the armpit and demote California to the rectum.\n\nOnce I got on the bridge on the pedestrian side, we kept running into bikers. What happened to the biker's side? Where was the enforcer? Do police not exist any more in this city? One female biker charged toward us and politely screamed \"FUCK OFF\". I now have a new image and sound of the SF city hospitality......some female dog charging on a bike with a constipated face letting loose the aforementioned words.\n\nAs we were leaving the park, the traffic was horrible again. We found out that there was a black out in a 2 block radius. People had no idea how to play chicken when traffic lights are off.....and for the hour I was stuck in traffic, no police managed to get to the artery of the city that is just a 4 way pile up waiting to happen.\n\nI highly recommend that you legalize weed and tax the doo doo out of it. Oh and please do send the insane bikers to mental institutions.\n\nThank you, \n\nPig, a tourist who pay more to the state of california than your average tax payers.", "author": "Jeff K."}

You share the walkway with bikers as well, so be careful not to get run over or hit by one, or just move out of the way when you see one that doesn't seem to care to slow down for a walker.

Not only must you see it if you visit California, you should probably have it on your itinerary if you visit the U.S. period. Painted the official color International Orange it stands as the gateway to the San Francisco Bay area. It has to constantly be painted because the paint erodes away quick due to the sea water and salty air. You should read up on the history of it and how it was the first suspension bridge in the world and how many workers gave their lives to build it. It's an appropriate entrance to one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Drive over it, walk over it or ride a bike over it. Just stop along the way to take pictures. There are several places to stop and take pictures, including on the Sausalito side that is an amazing view of the bridge going around the mountain towards The City. I remember I was driving over the bay bridge coming from the Marin side during sunset, just as I passed the Palace of Fine Arts. It was breath taking.", "author": "Liz C."}

For that classic shot of the bridge behind you from above, is a scenic stop at the north bay part of the bridge up on the mountain to the west. For a wide shot of the entire bridge eastern span, venture to Alcatraz or Treasure Island during sunset.\n\nWelcome to the ambitious brainchild of the visionary poet and engineer Joseph Strauss. Featured as one of the greatest wonders of the world and featured in countless media from film to television to video games, I am honored to witness this modern marvel every day when I wake up and look out my window. The story about how this bridge came to be is inspiring. Although this legend comes with many ups and downs being the most captivating symbol of the west coast and the city of San Francisco, it is also sadly home to the suicide capital of the world that even inspired the documentary The Bridge. Hence the nets hanging under the popular jump spots.\n\nThe traffic on the Golden Gate gets busy on your typical rush hours. When it's busy, stay in the right lane for quicker results. Driving across into San Francisco there will be a toll charge. Both sides of the bridge contain walkways, but last I heard only the eastern side walkway is open to the public for crossing, tourists and bikers.", "author": "Terry C."}

Henry\n\nI think this quote pretty much sums it up for the city that gives northern California and the whole west coast a good name. There is just something magical about San Francisco and seeing this bridge, in all of its glory and grandeur just brings you to a moment of awe, a moment of true reflection. It is almost as if it becomes just you and the bridge and now one else. \n\nYou need to walk across this bridge from start to finish in order to appreciate it, in order to have a true moment with yourself and with this icon that is known around the world.\n\nThe song lyric, \"I left my heart in San Francisco\" describes anyone who has walked this bridge. And if you are able to walk this bridge with someone you love you can imagine the power and emotion you would feel. So take a walk here, you don't have to pay the $5 toll then!!!, and experience the wonder of the Golden Gate Bridge.", "author": "Sarah G."}

There are a lot of reviewers fixated on the high number of suicides that take place here. Yes, it is tragic when someone gets to the point they feel the need to end their life. But what does that have to do with the bridge itself? Nothing! You cannot stop people who are determined to do something. There are a number of other ways to do it. Should they walk in front of Caltrain instead? \n\nAnother reviewer gave it 2 stars and said \"It's too bridgey\". I was looking for a laughing icon or an LOL but there wasn't any. Too bridgey? I suppose Lake Tahoe is \"too watery\"?  I'm going to suggest to Yelp they add another rating item for reviews, in addition to useful, funny, and cool: stupid or absurd. \n\nThe GG Bridge is a masterpiece of Architecture and Engineering. Unlike a painting that hangs in  a museum, or a sculpture that gathers dust, it is a utilitarian piece of infrastructure that is used by and is necessary to thousands of people every day. Yet it doubles as art. The fact that it is an icon and draws hundreds of thousands of tourists from all over the world every year is frosting on the cake and adds to its greatness. I have been fascinated by it since I was a kid. Somebody said it wasn't gold, it is rust-colored---FYI the \"Golden Gate\" itself is the opening connecting the Bay to the Pacific Ocean, not the bridge. And the Bridge's color was specifically intended by the Architect to be the \"International Orange\" color, never gold. \n\nThe Bridge also has many different looks and feels. Go out by the visitor center at dusk, just as the sun slips below the Western horizon. The bridge silhouetted against the backdrop of the Marin mountains and the sunset is breathtaking, and becomes incredibly romantic as the daylight changes to night. Or on a sunny, cloudless day with the bright blue ocean and sky all around. When the fog rolls in there is yet another completely different look and feel. It doesn't take a lot of imagination to become captivated by this scene, and if you do use your imagination, there is no limit. \n\nFor those who think the bridge is overrated, go out there on a sunny day...any day...by the Cafe and Visitor center, and you will see multitudes of people from all over the world who came to enjoy, photograph, walk, visit, and marvel at this world-class masterpiece. Ask any of them if they think it's overrated. \n\nI drop it down 1 star from perfect because it is getting ridiculously expensive to drive on it. They are always looking to raise tolls. I know it cost money to maintain. But the cost is too high. It was paid off more than 20 years ago. Tolls should have gone down.", "author": "Steve J."}

The bright red-orange paint contrasts beautifully against the deep blue of the water and the bright blue of the sky. The bridge is stunning on a clear night. Lights majestically beam on its towers while the city lights of San Francisco glisten from afar. However, my favorite site of the bridge is when the fog starts rolling in on a clear day. The sky is still bright blue, the sun is still beaming, but here comes the blanket of fog...rolling in low, covering the road but revealing the towers... rolling in fast from the ocean and into the bay. When driving across the bridge, it is an awesome site to EXPERIENCE. You drive through the rolling fog! Feels like we're floating in the sky! You can't help but feel so at one with the bridge...if that makes any sense. I lack the vocabulary to truly describe the feeling I get when observing this. When staring at the bridge from either Kirby Cove or Baker Beach, I'm still taken away by the distance between the towers. \n\nIt's free to walk across from either direction, free to drive across from San Francisco going northbound, but there is a hefty toll to drive southbound back into the city (current toll is $6).", "author": "Helen L."}

Since 9/11, I don't think this is possible any more because there are cameras every where and I suspect you'll probably be given a ticket.  Also there are shoulder high fences instead of the knee high barriers, making things a little difficult.  I guess, I am a bad boy and I am ashamed of myself for doing this but I couldn't help it.  Another example, I sometimes drive 56 mph in a 55 mph posted speed zone, I like to live life on the edge, Baby!  Ha Ha!!  Besides there were no signs saying I couldn't do it.\nOK, I am an idiot, a retard and I have no impulse control.  \n\nWhat was interesting was the difference between each sides of the bridge.  The side facing the ocean takes quite a beating from the wind and salt corrosion.  The corrosion exposes the many layers of paint all the way down to the metal, it was really, really thick, about a half inch thick. While the other side shows very little wear.\n\nAnother interesting fact is the bridge on the SF side is part of the Presido known as Fort Point.  The water moving out to sea under the bridge is surprisingly strong, like a swift river.  It's also a surf break, waves are created from the wake of large freighter ships passing by. They're weak but surfable.  The pictures I took of the surfers look fantastic.  \nThere you have it, the perfect iconic picture.

The peasants' yacht sailed past Australia, Hawaii and the calm waters of the Pacific until the Golden Gate was in sight. It stood tall and proud through the fog, a beaming orange titan bridging the Old World to the New. Leonard wondered if he had made the wrong decision. Perhaps his wife and son and baby girls were already butchered by the Japanese. Maybe he should have stayed in Taisan. It was too late to go back now. The vessel drifted past Angel Island and anchored into harbor.\n\nFresh off the boat, he washed dishes in Chinatown, working his way up to office clerk at a dental clinic. He learned how to speak American. He bought new clothes and a necktie. He wore a fedora instead of hair. Leonard dropped the chopsticks and picked up a fork to enjoy prime rib at Lucky Penny. While reading his wife's letters, he savored hot chowder on the Pier to stay warm. San Francisco was his new home. Months and wages went by until one autumn morning- Leonard stood at the edge of the Presidio watching the ships sail through the Golden Gate. A foghorn bellowed as the boat entered the dock. This one held a woman and three children who would make complete the much desired reunion he longed for in his mind.", "author": "Mico C."}

Check out Manabu M's review of the Golden Gate Bridge for more facts than you can shake a stick at. I love the scale of the bridge. It is huge, as in way way big. It is always windy on the bridge and if you are on foot, the wind will cut through your clothes unless you have a warm wind breaker. \n\nMy favorite time at the bridge was when the Queen Mary came to San Francisco. We were late to get parking by the Marina or Chrissy Field, so we ended up at the south end of the Golden Gate Bridge. The Queen Mary was later than expected, so we walked about half way across. Froze to pieces, as we were not dressed for the stroll. It was amazing watching the Queen Mary come under the bridge, wondering if it would fit. The Liberty Ship Jeremiah Johnson looked like a mid-sized yacht as it escorted the Queen Mary to port. A grand vision I shall never forget.", "author": "Nancy B."}

When you cross this bridge from San Francisco you are driving out over the Pacific ocean and connecting to Marin County. \n\nWhen you think of San Francisco, visions of this famous bridge come to mind. Millions of vehicles cross this bridge annually and I was one of them. \n\nThis is a work of art and graceful steel at it's finest. I personally would have gone for Teal, but hey orange works into the sunset.", "author": "DJ M."}

Combine San Francisco's ever-changing weather with one of the most recognizable monuments in the world, and it's something that must be experienced to grasp just how awesome it is. It's hard to pay attention to the road while driving across, there's just so much to look at. Driving into the city at night the skyline across the bay is amazing. Driving in during the day stoic Alcatraz looms large out in the open water. If it's foggy, then the rise and fall of the bridge itself reminds me of something outer worldly.

The overall appearance?  The experience of walking, biking, or driving over it?  The views I get from standing on it?\n\nI'll try to review it based on the entertainment value.  First and foremost, it is VERY windy and cold there, at least when I was there (July), so bring a coat or sweatshirt.  \n\nWe took the public bus there, which was a great and inexpensive way to get there.  WARNING: If you plan to walk across, know that it is about 4200 feet across!  A mile is 5280 feet.  It WILL take longer than you think, or at least longer than I thought!!  \n\n2nd WARNING: Once you walk across, there is no bus on the other side!  You must walk back to get back to the other side!  My friends and I almost learned this the hard way (long story don't ask what happened there).\n\nThe views are great.  It's basically one of those requisite things to do as a tourist in San Francisco, and goddammit, my friends and I made sure we did it.\n\nYou can also bike there from the downtown area (there are a few bike rental places that let you rent bikes for $32 a day per adult), and I have to say that you have to be a decent amateur athlete to do this!  There are some hills that left me huffing and puffing like a fat old man.  And there are some parts in which you have to share the road with cars, which can be frightening.  And there are some steep downhills as well, so make sure to use your brakes!  And pllleeaassee wear a helmet!  You can take a ferry back instead of biking the entire path, which I highly recommend.  The bike shop will charge you $10 per ticket, but if you buy from the ferrymen, it will cost you $8.50.  Just sayin'.", "author": "Rona H."}

This is GENIUS!!! I couldn't imagine trying to ride across the bridge trying to dodge pedestrians. \n\nThe day we rode across it was miserable, cold, windy, and foggy. But it was still an amazing adventure. \n\nI recently purchased a bike and haven't gotten to ride it yet but because of this ride, I realized how much fun it is. \n\nThe ride was tough with lots of uphills but what makes it all worthwhile is the view on the other side. Sausalito is a city only thought imaginable in dreams, but no it's reality. The rolling clouds seem to fall over the houses.

Gather around, children, 'cause there's a story behind this one.\n\nI first met the Golden Gate Bridge as a visitor.  I met my step-sister in Sacramento - never been to the Bay Area - and we decided to travel to SF for a visit.  This was several years ago, and  I was firmly rooted in my Colorado mountain home.  I don't know how she did it from Vacaville, but we traveled over the GG Bridge to visit the city  by the bay for the first time.  Oh god.  ...I fell in complete and utter love.  With no thoughts that this would EVER be reciprocated or that I would ever live here - I fell in love with this stupid orange landmark and the city for which it stood.\n\nImagine several years have gone by, and I have been transferred to the City.  I spend part of each day coming over the Bay Bridge.  Every time, there's this squirmy feeling - \"oh god, I work here, I mean I really WORK HERE in San Francisco.  Wow.\".  For those of you native to this area, there is no way to describe the beauty that hits those of us who are immigrant to this town.  I cannot explain the feeling, the joy, that comes from this place.  I thought I was in heaven - little did I know...\n\nFast forward three years and one move from Portland to here.  I'm done.  I cannot hide my love for this place.  I rent an apartment in the city and find I can take the cable car to work every day.  On my second day down Hyde Street, I see the Golden Gate in all her amazing glory - and I fall in love all over again.  I live here.  I LIVE HERE!!!!!  There are no words.\n\nSince that day, I have walked over the bridge several times, taken friends and family up the headlands to take photos and seen her glory in everything including low-lying clouds and bright sunshine.  I am a history major - for me, this place will always hold a tinge of those who worked against all odds to create a dream out of steel and will.  It will always represent that iconic tower thrusting up through the mist on my first visit so many years ago.  And it remains the touchstone of my current life, as a citizen of one of the most wonderful, dynamic, amazing cities - my home.", "author": "Suzanne B."}

But no one knows when your time is up and I didn't know that the Golden Gate would be the last great memory of my brother. Fraternal twins, born 20 minutes apart, our early years were full of brother-sister rivalry and It was only after maturing did we realize how close we really were. So in the last few years, we'd spend our birthdays together in San Francisco. He'd drive down from Oregon and I'd drive or fly up from LA and we would meet each January for a few days of terrorizing the bay area. We were really good at it, true masters of the art blowing the minds of our significant others. We were wild ones, born here in this city and considered ourselves plank-owners. So I should've been suspicious when I suggested we walk across the bridge to Marin and he refused. I thought he was being a wuss for his gf's sake but he said he had a cold and didn't feel like it. I shrugged and did the walk. When I finally got back, he said he wasn't feeling good so we drove back to the B&B and I left the next day. That was the last time I saw him alive. \n\nI got the word while visiting my best friend in Virginia, a friend dying of cancer, that he had died. I thought it was some mad, cruel joke and I broke down, fell to the floor. He had been in excellent health otherwise, surfed, ran a kung-fu studio and was a police officer. How could he have died? His co-workers and friends all suspected foul play but it turned out to be something called sarcoidosis that attacked his lungs and caused his heart to fail, killing him. It had gone unrecognised by his fucked-up doctor for some time. The chronic cough should have been recognized and a specialist referenced...something was wrong. \n\nThe Golden Gate will always be two things to me. It will always be one of the most enduring symbols of our country and a cherished icon of the city I love so much, the place we were born. And it will always symbolize that great sadness of the very last time I saw my brother standing there over the ocean with San Francisco in the background.\n\nYou never know when death will come to someone you love. The Golden Gate reminds me to cherish those moments you share with them because it just might be the last time. My friend in Virginia died of esophogeal cancer twenty days later, a week after turning 49.\n\nI didn't know...\n\nSee my Fort Point review for more on the area...http://www.yelp.com/biz/fort-point-san-francisco#hrid:IXaDA_il--mVYliuyizWIg", "author": "Robin Z."}

Please don't forget those you can only hold in your heart...and then remember to hold the ones you can.  : )\n\nUp until now, I have been hesitant to post a review of the bridge. My best attempts at finding the right words always fall short. It is symbolic of so much to so many. It's had a special place in my heart since I was maybe five. And as in any life, much has happened. Love. Life. Loss. Bad and good. You know the drill. And then it hit me yesterday as I enjoyed yet another Zen moment quietly riding over the bridge and into the city early in the morning while the sun shown, the city sparkled and the waves crashed. Someone else had worked it out for me years ago...\n\nMaze, featuring Frankie Beverly recorded 'Joy and Pain' at the Record Plant in Sausalito in 1980, which happens to be THE pivotal year in my particular journey.

My bike jersey is orange and yellow. It is Italian. I wear it so people will look at me. I look like a super hero-I call myself \"ORANGE MAN!\" My friends call my \"BIG BIRD!\" this is a difference of opinion we have on a regular basis.\n\nSo I ride in this orange outfit across this bridge that is also orange. It is like bicycling in camouflage. I am like a Ninja (yes Candice, a   Ninja!). A big orange Ninja. \n\nMy friend Rich and I ride through the Presidio to get to the bridge, and travel through the tourists to get there. It is really beautiful riding along the cliffs and under the bridge.\n\nThere is a biking side to the bridge and a walking side, so the bikers do not hurt themselves by hitting tourists. You ride under the bridge and clime up a short hill on the other side to get to the biking side. What is fun at this point is that you come to a blind turn and have to not run into other bikers. This can be worse than hitting tourists. \n\nOnce you get on the bridge, it is very interesting, For one, it can be really cold. I have been on the bridge when it is windy and foggy, and the fog blows across, through the bars and can be really cool looking. Dangerous too because you can get blown over. What makes it even more dangerous is that to get around the towers, you have to slow way down and make really sharp turns. This is another place where head on collisions occur. Also, the worst is the tourists on bikes. If you thought the tourists on foot were scary from my earlier comments, you should see the ones on Bikes. Wow! They sometimes don't wear helmets (which is Darwinian if you ask me), and they stop in the middle of the tower part and look out.\n\nNow, I understand, they need to do this. That is why they rented those bikes with the bags on the handlebars in the first place. But for real, must you stand in the bike lane around a blind corner? It is like standing on the street and wondering why you're getting run over. Y'all crazy!\n\nAnyway, the sights are beautiful, and once you get over the hump of the bridge, you can really race down towards the north bay and pass people. Fun!\n\nOn the other side of the bridge, we ride up the Headlands. Once on the top, we can look out and on a clear day see the whole city, with the GG Bridge huge in front of us. It is really cool. Then we ride down the hill, and cross the bridge all over again. The crossing back is pretty much the above in reverse, so I will spare you.\n\nSo what did we learn? \n\nHitting tourists can hurt. They are not to impressed by it either.\n\nHitting tourists on rented bikes can hurt more. This is a lose lose any way you look at it.\n\nThe GG bridge has an arch to it.\n\nI dress obnoxiously for attention.", "author": "Michael L."}

EASY TARGET) \n\nBUT when you get near the end of the bridge, slow down because there is always a policeman with his radar gun standing by a pole at the end of the bridge. (I SEEN THIS MANY TIMES. He just stands there and point.)\n\nwhen he catches a car speeding, he will radio one of his fellow CHP officers parked at a hill right after the bridge or sometimes a CHP on a motorcycle hangs out at the tourist spot. then they will flash their lights and BAM! you are caught. there aren't any excuses to get out of a speeding ticket on the bridge unless if you have a pregnant woman in the car. \n\ni seen many cars getting pull over because they were going 55-65 mph. i think its stupid how the CHP just hangs out waiting for their prey. \n\ngolden gate bridge is a great place to visit BUT definitely a SPEED TRAP!!!", "author": "Carol Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-17", "description": "I first met this modern marvel in 2005 while on vacation. It was love at first sight. Now I live in the area and still love it. I never get over its beauty , massive size , engineering and especially the men who died building it. I never tire of photographing it and whenever I venture near it , I try to take a different angle. I realize that I am not alone in my desire to visit the bridge and spend time admiring it. That being said you would think I would be giving it 5 stars. Well there are a few things that need to be said to the new visitor of this marvel. Obviously , summer , school vacations and holiday weekends are not the best times to go here if you are looking for an enjoyable , relaxed stress free experience. Then again , when are the vast majority of people in a position to visit but those common times. For those of us with flexible schedules , try your best to go during the week early on in the day. Don't forget that this bridge is also mobbed for commuters going about their life so avoid those peak times as well. The other huge problem that I don't see the parks service ever addressing in the near future especially in this economy is the bathroom situation. Picture literally hundreds of people driving into the Fort Point area only to find FOUR stalls for everybody (this is the ladie's perspective mind you). It just isnt cool and at 2pm that restroom is closed for cleaning so the mob is shifted to share the men's room. And yes , I'm speaking from experience .I'm not sure what factors contributed to this lack of facilities . Now the other side of the bridge where you can also park is equipped much better. On either side on a busy day , you will be waiting to and fighting for a place to park. People get extremely testy on the Fort Point side. Hopefully , you won't have a bursting bladder (again that would be me one day as I chugged a Starbucks venti all the way from Campbell). The other caution is how the space is shared on the walk from one side of the bridge to the other. Due to the recent retrofitting work , the Southbound side is closed to pedestrians . So the Northbound side is extra crowded with this potentially volatile mix : you the happy walker , the run run run joggers , other happy walkers , folks like me who would marry their camera if possible they love to use it that much , Lance Armstrong wannabee cyclists and my personal favorite : the awestruck bike riding skiddish tourists . This mix is intertwined with people who are so amazed by their surroundings that they pay zero attention to anyone . So the potential for mayhem is always there. Use your head , be safe and you will forever remember being on this landmark. Don't use your head and you will forever NEVER remember being here as you will have broke your noggin. Oh and during my first visit in 2005 , my ex husband and I watched a potential jumper get escorted to the nearest ER for a psych eval. So I guess that you should be mindful of the suicide help line call boxes along the way too. Back to the fun .Simply plan to go at a time where you can savor the whole experience , putter in the nice little gift shop ,read the historical placards and definitely take pictures. On your way back southbound , you must pull off and drive up the lookout point which has stunning views of the bridge , an old army battery to explore and some moderate hiking if you desire. Keep in mind it can be windy and very chilly here all year round so do wear layers especially for the lookout points as you wont enjoy fully if you are freezing . (yup done that too ) Oh and do i have to say good comfortable walking shoes ? That's important. There is a $6 car toll when you exit Southbound. The Presidio is another must visit but that review is for another day as this explorer needs some sleep. Cheers !!!! Enjoy your journey !!!!!

It's all been said before - it's gorgeous, it's inspiring, it's the quintessential San Francisco image.  Five stars.  Rather, this is a review of it as a place for me to run.\n\nI hate to run.  That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.  My friends know this, yet some of them charmingly keep inviting me to run with them anyway.  A 10 mile run?  A track workout in GG Park?  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha NO.  But I do run - in secret.  Just me and my iPod.  I don't need to run a marathon ever, but as long as I can run across the Golden Gate Bridge and back, I'm happy.  \n\nSo I run across the bridge sometimes.  It's a great place to run, because I get so distracted - I look out at the sailboats, Angel Island, I try to see if I can spot any creatures in the water - ooh look, I'm on the Marin side.  On the way back, I look at Alcatraz, the cargo ships, the SF skyline - cool, I'm back at the toll plaza.  \n\nThe best time to run across the bridge is early mornings, preferably during sunrise.  Since I rarely get up that early, I end up running during busier times.  But I don't mind the tourists.  Sometimes they're useful as marks to keep going.  That woman ahead with the fannypack - keep going, keep going - OK, passed her.  The couple in shorts and San Francisco sweatshirts - keep going - OK, passed them.  The only time they're annoying is when they're walking four abreast.  And the bicyclists - sigh.  I try to stay out of their way, and they seem to return the favor.  \n\nThe biggest downside: the fumes from the traffic.  I always feel like I'm inhaling some toxic stuff.

I love being spooked by the loud honking of semi trucks.\n5. There is a concession stand in case one feels like a having hot dog or nacho after a run.\n6. There is always good sightseeing---this morning I saw a man running in a pair of bright yellow boxer with chili peppers on them...and another man with a tank top that says, \"MILF HUNTER\"\n7. There are over 6 Crisis Counseling phones throughout the bridge, so you won't have to share...\n8. I love being spooked by cyclists coming up behind me full throttle...\n9.

You will, without wanting to, think about what it would be like to simply throw a leg over the railing, lean out, and fall for a few seconds.  Whether it's because of the bridge itself, the bridge's history (the most suicided-off structure in the world), or some combination, the thought is inescapable, no matter how happy or well-adjusted you might be.\n\nWhy can't I stop taking pictures of the bridge?  It's got to be among the 3 most photographed structures in the city, and yet every time I'm on Marin Headlands or down at Crissy Field, or out at Fort Mason, there I am, taking pictures of the bridge.

This review must focus strictly on the Toll Plaza itself:\n\nThe rounded contours of the toll booths topped with the big florescent lit clock (at night) provide a cool streamlined aesthetic that stand as the bridges strongest nod to its art Deco influences.  Add a strong blanket of fog and its pretty hard not to feel like a 1930's private \"i\" when you cruise through.\n\nThe color of the toll plaza (and the entire bridge),  \"international orange\", is a beautiful sun set matching color, if not slightly confusing to the tourist coming out of the gift shop protesting, \"But's its not golden, its red!\" \n\nOh yeah, and there's a toll plaza with a museum and a gift shop that provides one of the most photographed vistas in the world.  In most parts of the country, toll plaza gift shops are located above an interstate and serve as the occasional backdrop for big rig trucker prostitution.\n\nFunctionally, you can catch a cab or a bus from here. And all things considered, like the fact that they have to change the lanes of traffic entering and exiting the eastern most booths of the toll plaza several times throughout the day(!!!), the traffic at the toll plaza aint that bad.\n\nWould be five stars, but damn you know our grandkids are gonna be paying a bridge toll of $25 someday.", "author": "Michael M."}

I've noted other Yelpers using this as another monumental review, 100th, 200th, 300th, et al., as well.\n\nThus, I find it exciting, actually titillating to write a few random facts about this Art Deco masterpiece. If anyone thinks this bridge isn't \"all that\" as you may see in some reviews down the page, then let them try to erect something of this magnitude across a giant bay of water. \n\nI love me some Wikipedia, and local random historical tidbits, which lead to the fun facts below:\n\n1. The bridge has over 1,200,000 rivets.\n\n2. The \"golden\" color of the bridge is actually an orange vermilion called international orange.\n\n3. By the time the painting crews complete their job, a year has passed and it's time to begin painting the bridge again. \n\n4. It's certainly the most photographed bridge in the world, although some would argue the Tower Bridge in London is also a contender for that title.\n\n5. Since its completion, the bridge has been closed 3 times due to extreme weather conditions, all three being high wind gusts up to 75 mph. \n\n6. In the movie, X-Men: United, the Golden Gate was destroyed by the forces of Magneto.\n\n7. In the 2005 tele-movie \"10.5,\" the Golden Gate bridge collapses after San Francisco is struck by an earthquake. (That was a hysterical and horrendously entertaining made-for TV miniseries)\n\n8. Scary enough though, various and loose sources around the city have predicted that the bridge would not survive an earthquake much over 8.0 on the Richter Scale, and definitely wouldn't guarantee it's survival with an 8.5 or higher.\n\n9. Joseph Strauss was the Chief Engineer and he spent 10 years drumming up support for the project in northern California.\n\nFun facts, fun times!!! \n\nMy other favorite thing to do is to walk all the way across and back on  a sunny day.

I guess....\"  (Oh, Glo)\n\nWell, OK, my goodness, that celebration was (whew!) 20 years ago! And Glo, ironically, is now living in Hercules. I dunno if she's ready to take back her remarks.. but whatever..\n\nOur most recent excursion to the bridge was this last Sunday... doing our duty as good Bay Area citizens and host parents to two high school exchange students -- Mohammed (from Tunisia) and Fred (from Korea). It was our first chance since their arrival in September to run up to the City. And how can you take guests on their first visit to SF and *not* take them to the GG? \n\nWhoa! OK. The day we went was not the ideal day for doing what we had in mind. That day the City and especially the bridge was shrouded in fog. We drove right on thru the fog, across the bridge to the Marin side where you could stand fog-free and in sunlight at the vista point and watch the fog roll in thru the straits a hundred yards away almost but not completely covering the towers and suspension cables and roadway. So our guests snapped their pictures. I imagine within those same 5 minutes 50 other pictures being snapped by other tourists.. but because of the rolling fog, I'll bet none of those pictures show quite the same scene as any other.\n\nThen three of us walked back across the bridge thru the fog. But even in the fog.. I know of no other engineering structure this immense that *invites* you to walk on it... right on its skeleton and sense the immensity of its supporting cables and towers.. I know of nothing else this size that fits in so well with the land and the sea surrounding it... or that allows you to feel, to walk uninsulated thru the wind and the fog, and the rain, and the salt air that constantly assault it. \n\nAnd, of course, I know of no other structure this size that serves as such a symbolic gateway between our pleasant urban existence built around the edges of the Bay on one side and the turbulent, untamed, immense reaches of the Pacific on the other.... And then the sulfur lights go on\n\nAnd so even in the fog, the fog horn booming, the wind blowing, walking in semi-darkness there's Mohammed, the 17 year old exchange student from Tunisia practically bouncing over the span towards San Francisco, yelling, \"Man, I love this place.. Man, I love this place!\"", "author": "Weide Z."}

So what made me finally Yelp this fine bridge of ours after all this time you ask?\n\nFast forward: I ran to Marin this morning and it was a super foggy day, with no visibility whatsoever. As I am heading back towards the city and running on the GGB, I see a couple of police/bridge patrol cars double parked on the bridge and I suspect a crash due to the heavy fog. But as I get closer, I notice that there is clearly some activity on the sidewalk. I am running, so I've got good music blasting, endorphins in full swings and I am thinking: \"This could not be a jumper. It just could NOT be\". \n\nAs I get even closer, 4 cops are conversing with a guy and slowly surrounding him,  making sure to stand between him and the water. I see him raise his hands above his head, resigned. I will never forget the look in this guy's eyes. I still have goosebumps just thinking about it.\n\nSo yeah kids, this bridge is cool.

Really, I'm a big, big fan of the Golden Gate Bridge.  \n\nI love how the large public works of the 1930's incorporated art deco elements. For me it makes these large, useful objects, such as this bridge or the Hoover Dam, transcend their function to some extent; they become massive works of art. \n\nThe one thing that I am not crazy about are the yellow lane markers that the bridge crews move from lane to lane for the different traffic configurations. Not only are these a bad method of lane separation, but as a motorcyclist who commutes across the bridge, I've had dozens of close calls with these things shooting out from under the tires of vehicles and flying right at me.

It's not like you're sitting there with your bag of ghirardelli, SFMOMA calendar, and empty sourdough breadbowl puzzling over whether or not you should check it out.  \r\n\r\n\"Mmm, I dunno honey.  Sure its the prominent feature of every cinematic establishing shot of San Francisco in any movie ever set here, but I can't help but feel that the service might be a little slow.

I can't help but smile when I see the expressions of the people crowding the front as they get their first glimpse of this California landmark. \n\nRecently I watched a documentary about the bridge's construction and I'm in complete awe of the people who made this architectural project a reality. The Halfway to Hell club (people who fell into the net but didn't crash into the cold waters below the structure) and all of the Iron workers must have been brave people to work at such precarious heights. \n\nThe fact that I found fascinating about the bridge that I was unaware of until seeing the short film is that in order to fund this huge project, citizens put their personal assets on the line to accomplish this feat. I doubt few would do such a thing in this day and age and in the height of the Great Depression, people were unduly generous with great faith in the ability of this dream to come to fruition. \n\nSide Note: I'm looking forward to seeing the film \"The Bridge\": that explores the more morbid side of this Golden Giant.", "author": "Jessica D."}

After trying to pay online and not being able to figure it out, i decided to wait for the bill to come. After not receiving a bill for over a month, i called and was told that I was late and now owed 70 DOLLARS!. They said to dispute the charge that i would have to send the money first and that they would then dispute it for me. I sent the money and got a letter letting me know that my dispute was declined.

They do a pretty good job of keeping the traffic moving on this bridge, but the price goes up every year and they don't have any H.O.V. or motorcycle deals during the commute hours like the bay bridge does. \n\nHonestly, I don't think that anyone on a motorcycle should have to pay to cross the bridge. One of the scariest things is having to stop at the toll plaza while hoping that the guy behind you can see you and stop in time. \n\nThe bridge also has to figure out a way of separating North and Southbound traffic in a safer way. Too many people have been killed on the bridge in head on accidents. \n\nI really can't understand why the toll keeps going up. Why should it cost that much more to maintain it then it did the year before. The thing really hasn't changed very much since it was built.", "author": "Mike M."}

Initially, Hiep and I were disappointed because we thought that the bus was going to drive over the Bridge not drop us off near the toll booths. It was so foggy up there that you couldn't even see the outline of the bridge. Initially, we walked down to the bike path once I saw Fort Point at the base of the bridge. Took a couple of pictures. Then Hiep asked if I wanted to walk a little ways onto the bridge. I figured why the hell not and we proceeded towards the bridge. One thing they never tell you about the Golden Gate Bridge? Besides its enormous size, it's incredibly noisy due to the vehicular traffic that crosses the bridge. It's right next to your ear when you're walking the sides of the bridge. And it's downright scary to walk a bridge of that size. I don't know how suicide jumpers do it. I had this irrational fear that a gust of breeze would blow me off the bridge and right into San Francisco Bay. I had to securely hold my camera because I was worried it would get blown out to sea as well. The bridge is unique for picture-takers because you have to wait for the patches of fog to clear in order to take decent pictures of the Bay and of the Bridge itself. Hiep and I spent at least two minutes watching how the fog moved across the bridge in an eastern direction and determining when would be a good time to snap a picture. I mean, hey, it's not like we're coming here again any time soon. We walked to the first pillar, then turned back and headed to the gift shop. The walkway was fully of people. It was, admittedly, pretty cool.\n\nI got a photo frame and a tee-shirt at the gift shop for my parents, then we boarded a bus back to San Francisco. We only waited about two stops before we got off at Richardson and Francisco St. to go to the Exploratorium. Sadly, the grounds around the Palace of Fine Arts (the big Grecian-designed Rotunda) were fenced off for renovation and so we couldn't walk around there.", "author": "Henry T."}

It was pretty rainy and exceedingly windy, such that your standard-issue field-trip rain parka would billow up like a wounded blow fish. Now, Reader, I don't know if you've had much occasion to walk the bridge, but even under normal conditions, on an average day, it feels as if absolutely all of your weight is needed to keep yourself from being lifted bodliy by the Pacific winds and casually dropped to the rocks and crashing waves below. Under these more extreme conditions, in the driving rain, in the howling winds, in the dark of late evening, in a ballooning plastic sheet parka, in the thralls of a fourteen year old's emotions, it's fair to describe the experience as something approaching \"harrowing\". Now, not exactly \"terrifying\"; more like how you must feel when you think: \"Oh My God, I'm Actually Skydiving\". However that feels.\n\nAnd yet, I still think this is a totally good bridge.\n\nOur German friend Ollie, who crashed on our couch in Berkeley for a few months in '99 or '00 while he was waiting to get deported (lousy Europeans, taking our jobs! Whhhyyy I oughtta.....), regarded a trip to go see the bridge as akin to seeing the Eiffel Tower. To which we locals respond, \"Hey, yeah...\" and smile and think warmly of ourselves.\n\nDid you see that suicide movie they made, using daily footage they took of the bridge over the course of a year? Sure you did! It was kinda controversial because they didn't tell the Park Service (or whoever runs the land under and near the bridge) what, exactly, they were up to with the cameras. I think they told them they wanted to study the effects of ocean moisture on red paint. Seriously, I'm not making that up. \n\nOk, I am making that up. But they totally didn't tell them it was about suicide. Because the authorities might have said, um, no, it's NOT cool for you to film suicides. Which probably wouldn't have been seen by the public as that unreasonable a response.\n\nI think it was even called \"The Bridge\". Kinda disappointing. It was just about the people who jumped and their particular lives and circumstance, and not about the bridge per se, or the relationship between bridges and suicide, which is the movie I was expecting. They should have just called it \"Suicide\".\n\nDid I just bring the mood down? My bad. Sorry to mention the whole suicide thing, but it's kinda part and parcel of being a famous bridge, I guess. Like Genghis Kahn, right? Everyone loves Genghis Khan, thinks he was totally cool, but there was a downside too, you know? People got hurt.", "author": "Ron Rico R."}

Sometimes i think, up to now, I still play so much the role of Alice.\n\nThe first time was pretty much undeliberate. i did not plan on crossing 4 bridges in one single day- thats Richmond Br., Golden gate Br., Bay Br, and San Mateo Br., (it was my 3rd week of driving and for petes sake what do i know.) I was lost from Richmond going back to Hayward and Golden Gate bridge stood out among the other three. I guess it was a funny and awesome experience, not knowing whats in the North or whats in South.... Well \"where is North and South\" that day was more like it!\n\nSo back to my review-- crossing this bridge for the first time is one of my best experiences. it was so fascinating, you just wanna stop in the middle of traffic and watch that body of water glisten underneath it. Whats more--it was nearing sunset that day, how I wish I have a built in video cam that I could click on automatic when I pass through such beautiful sceneries while driving. I cant help but go a little bit slower and worry later about where to go next even if I was lost.--all the other cars just seem to vanish in front of you... if getting lost would be this grand, then I would opt to be lost from time to time--=) =) =)\n\nIt was really worth it. Your fee for the three other tolls absolutely wouldnt matter to you anymore..that was how it is for my first.\n\nBut today I intended to go back @ sunset. I have some down time after work and ive been googling the directions for quite a while now, so i prepared my toll, put my best music up,\n rolled down my windows for good fresh air (\"ahh freedom\" moment), and leaned back as I drove across this regal landmark.

It is a beautiful structure and a must see for all visitors to San Francisco. It is free to walk, bike or jog across so a great low budget experience.\n\n\n I highly suggest walking across it and taking a moment along the way to have a look around and read the historical signs posted along the way. Bring your camera because the view in all directions is great.\n\n\n It is the most expensive bridge to cross in the bay area, 5 bucks maybe 6, and if you can, avoid driving over it when possible. It is not easy to get to or from without sitting in loads of traffic and if you are doing it for the novelty, then when you drive across you think I shoulda walked :)\n\n\n Oh and yes 24 people jump succesfully to their death each year and loads more are dragged away quite quickly and discreetly.

If you are coming from the East Bay cross the Bay Bridge and park on the side of Marin (that is, drive over the Golden Gate and then park).  That, way you save money and don't have to pay at the parking lot on SF side.  We already paid for one bridge and didn't want to pay another parking fee.  Although you are literally on the bay, bring enough clothing to your discretion.  It was farily warm when we went so a tank top and shorts did it for me.  But after spending time taking pictures and marveling over the bay view, 2 hours later crossing the bridge back it started getting really windy.  So, I say bring a light jacket just in case.  I defintiely loved walking across the bridge and definitely coming back next time to have a romantic walk during the late evening.  I believe the bridge closes at 6pm weekends 7pm weekdays.

It can really be dangerous and life threatening for them. But this is about the JUMPERS that take their own lives off the Bridge. I was paddleing around the tower and buoy there. Luckily I saw my Dolphin friends and followed them farther into the Bay. I turn around and again I see a lady climb over the rail of the bridge and jump, belly flop and gone with the ebbtide out the Gate.

It's a scenic walk and approx 3miles with only two small inclines (one at Fort Mason and the other right underneath the bridge at Fort Point to get to the visitors' centre). 3miles sounds long but in reality it isn't as you are so enthralled in the views that you don't notice the distance. As you walk along the shoreline most of the way you get to see sights and sounds that a lot of visitors would miss out on. If you do the walk make sure you take the slight 5min detour to visit Palais of Fine Arts (where the Exploratorium is housed) and check out of the human sundial on the ground.

Start by walking this thing, and the earth surrounding it.\n\nThe energy around this bridge is off the charts.  You have to walk it to appreciate it, though (and maybe be a California native, but that's another review).  I know, many will think \"what, walk around, under, across . . . the GG Bridge?  meh.\"  But seriously, even if you have lived in the bay area your entire life and you have never done this, it is worthwhile.  Do it right if you're going to do it:  Start early in the morning, or at least make a half day of it.  Pack a light lunch and plenty of water, camera, mp3 player loaded with your extreme best collection, comfortable walking attire, and layered clothing for the many weather conditions you will encounter.  \n\nMany locals don't realize you can walk along the water on dedicated unbroken paths sidewalks all the way from SF Giant's Stadium (AT&T Park) all the way to Sausalito.  Walking across the GG to Sausalito is a great day trip btw, and Sausalito has a ton of great lunch spots, not to mention shopping and endless general people gawking and bugging opportunities -- and after spending a few hours enjoying Sausalito one can walk/bike back or even catch a GG transit bus back to downtown SF for ~$5).  That's right:  walk.  Or bicycle.  That makes for a great trip, but you don't have to go that far -- you can adjust the length of your trip as you wish: one can start from Fisherman's Wharf, Crissy Field, simply start at one end of the bridge and walk to the other side, or a number of starting points in between.   Do venture down the paved paths under the bridge on each end though, to experience what it feels like, and take a moment to take in the view of the bay, the entrance to the bay, and Pacific Ocean expanding westward, as you stand under this engineering marvel from another era.  \n\nNow I'm not a big birdwatcher, but the subtle & silent bird show here is stupendous, for those with eyes to see.  Watch the sea birds fly in from around the bay, slowly, slowly, but ever so surely toward the bridge.  Observe as they make their daily trip toward the ocean, and the sea cliffs.  Watch them carefully navigate around the pillars and cables thrust high into the air by this strange monument erected by aliens called humans, as the wind gusts harder and threatens to slam them into the cables.  Follow their path as they pass above, below, and through the bridge and often turn southward, where they will spend hours gliding and soaring, effortlessly gliding from the strong updrafts on the sea cliffs overlooking Baker Beach and endless beaches below.  Some say they are simply looking for food.  Others agree that they are looking for food a bit, but mostly they are enjoying gliding and soaring effortlessly on the powerful updrafts caused when the winds off the Pacific meet the sea cliffs and strong streams of air are forced straight up keeping the birds and your spirit -- airborne.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-11-25", "description": "In my admittedly limited travels, I have to say that I think the Golden Gate Bridge is the most beautiful man-made spot on the planet.  More beautiful than the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, more beautiful than the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, or even the entire skyline of Manhattan.  More beautiful than the city-state megalopolis of Singapore, more beautiful than the Dom of Cologne, or the Eiffel Tower.  \n\nI'm sure there are a million arguments to be made for all of these places, and the hundred more man-made wonders to be found elsewhere on the planet, but this is my choice, and I'm sticking to it.  I lived in San Francisco for fifteen years, and my in-laws still live in Mill Valley, so I've driven across this bridge probably thousands of times, and every time...I'm talking EVERY TIME...even when traffic's backed up and I'm seriously late for something, even when I forgot the five bucks cover charge to enter the City from Marin County, I always think the same thing:  This is the most beautiful thing in the world.  The towers, the cables, the water below, the Farallon Islands in one direction, the Marin Headlands in another, Alcatraz and Angel Island another, and of course, the unnaturally white skyline of San Francisco in another...the fog that pours through the Gate in a variety of dramatic fashions - either above, below, or through the Bridge itself - it's enough to make you believe in the Great Spirit.  \n\nWhen you walk across it, you get the full effect of its grandeur, and sometimes, you can feel its vibrations and its movement as thousands of cars pour past you in both directions, a river of humanity in every color.  Tourists, dogs, and natives stream alongside you on the wide walkway, and even the awareness that hundreds of suicides have leapt to their deaths from here adds a certain amazing vibe to the walk:  The kind of courage and the depth of the despair that it would take to make someone jump from that great height into the always dramatic water below is almost unfathomable.  Especially when you consider the intense and almost unbearable beauty in whose midst you find yourself.  I hope to see the world before I die, and I hope I see many things whose beauty rivals this spot.  But I don't think I'll ever believe a spot is more beautiful than this one.", "author": "Ken N."}

Even yet, i live in the Marina, and I STILL GET A KICK OUT OF STARING AT THE BRIDGE ON A DAILY BASIS. Even so, it seriously brightens my day.. if only they would LIGHT UP THE INFAMOUS GOLDEN GATE @ night.. \n\nDef a landmark, and def what makes SF ... sahn frahnceesco ... \n\nSo, onto reliving my dream... \"Dream\" meaning, I had a dream few months back prior to my move to SF that I literally jumped off the bridge, of course I didn't go to THAT extent but it was def a weird experience.\n\nIt was a gorgeous, sunny yet slightly windy day.\n\nTook an hour, 30-35 mins each way and it was DEF well worth it!  \n\nApprox 1.7 miles. \n\nIf I CAN DO IT, YOU CAN DO IT!\n\nWalking & driving the GG are TWO COMPLETE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES!\n\nTIP: when driving, try NOT to speed, it's HARD NOT TO, but i repeat, be careful, you will be VERY SURPRISED of those mofos who try to get you. i was SUPER LUCKY NOT GETTING PULLED OVER. i even saw a bridge patrol RIGHT BEHIND ME few times, scanning my plate, while driving and talkin to his dispatcher, but after we crossed the toll, all was good. *phew*\n\nI have to admit, it was a lil bit scary having to walk 101N and feeling the cars driving by... at one point it felt as if you were going to be tossed into the bay since it was so windy at times. They even have an emergency fone to even help those who need crisis counseling. yes, it seriously said that on one of those signs, \"Emergency Phone & Crisis Counseling...\" WTH? is it for people to call right before they try to jump off the bridge??\n\nTook 2 local fotos for your pleasure. Not of the bridge since there were TONS of yelpers who did. I took one for the clumsy folks & a memory token of GG who slipped between the cracks. \n\nNOW, THAT'S DEF A CRAZY FLUKE. Call me weird but it's strange how not only did GG have the same initials as the Golden Gate, but the same amount of letters.\n\nAnyways, I'm doing this again. i'm SO doing this again...\n\nPS. I posted some fun facts... Read below.\n\n\n\nGolden Gate Bridge Facts - Traffic \n. Average crossings: About 40 million per year, counting both north- and southbound crossings, compared to 33 million crossing the first year it was open. \n. Fewest crossings: January, 1982, during a storm which closed U. S. 101 north of the bridge. On January 6, only 3,921 southbound vehicles passed the toll gates. \n. Most crossings: October 17, 1989, after the Loma Prieta earthquake, when Bay Bridge was closed. 162,414 vehicles (counting those going both directions) crossed the bridge that day. \n. Total crossings: Through October 30, 2002, the Golden Gate Bridge Highway District says 1,754,094,967 vehicles crossed the bridge. \n. Closures: The bridge has been closed three times for weather, for gusting winds over 70 mph. It closed briefly for visits by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and French President Charles DeGaulle. It was also closed on its fiftieth birthday\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n. May 27, 1937: Bridge opens to pedestrians. \n. May 28, 1937: Bridge open to automobiles. The toll was 50 cents one way, $1 round trip and 5 cents surcharge if there were more than 3 passengers. \n. February 22, 1985: The one-billionth car crosses the bridge. Toll is $2 southbound on Friday and Saturday, $1 otherdays. No northbound toll. \n. May 28, 1987: Bridge closed to vehicles for its fiftieth birthday. An estimated 300,000 pedestrians jammed the bridge. \n. September 1, 2002: Toll increased to $5 southbound. No northbound toll", "author": "Jennifer S."}

We dragged ourselves pretty quickly and didn't stop to take any pics. Not that there's any good pics to take as SF is not a very good looking city at night viewing from the Golden Gate Bridge.

When I see the tops thru trees or taking the Caltrain (yes you can see it if you're on the left side of the train) I shudder. But it's simply breathtaking. I don't have a friggin boner for the bridge as my review may suggest, but it when all is said and done, the bridge really is a sight to behold. I do get a bit queasy walking over it--it's always windy as hell and freezing--but I'm glad I do. I look down into the icy waters and ponder why people would want to jump? Even as a local, it still amazes me every time I see it. Those tourists plan their whole trip around the GG Bridge, and frankly, it's worth it. I've never met anyone who's hated it.", "author": "Chase S. K."}

This is 5 stars for the Bridge because it is one of the best sites in the world for honing serious bike-handling skills. Not only do you, on occasion, get a nice wicked, gusty cross wind, that gets especially tricky as it eddies around the towers, but you get a dynamic and unpredictable obstacle course, too. Of course, you may call these obstacles \"tourists,\" \"pedestrians,\" \"tourists on bikes,\" \"a pain in your ass,\" whatever, but I revel in my rides across the span, especially the east side. The kids darting to and fro, the unpredictable \"quick step back\" by photographers, the massive tour-packs... all test your control and your patience like no other place in the world.

I was thrilled to be crossing in a car, to do something I'd never done before, to think about how majestic this bridge is.  As a kid I had no appreciation of the fact that we had a beautiful view of the bridge, and almost everything from where Mt. Sutro now hosts THAT tower to Berkeley and Oakland including the other (gray) bridge.  The radio stations used to keep a running count on the suicides, haven't heard that in years, the closures and the weather when extreme.  I remember when so many people walked onto the bridge, I feared it would collapse.  The fare was $ .25 when I started driving my own cars back and forth and it seemed magic to me then, still does but it's expensive magic today.

BAM, we instantly found a parking spot. we quickly found the pathway that takes you under the bridge and to the main parking lot with bathrooms and look out spots. a bathroom break later, we were off to walk this landmark.\n\nwe dressed in layers and walked at a good pace to keep our bodies warm. we saw barges, tug boats, sail boats and a school of dolphins. the sun was out and burned most of the fog away from the bridge. sausalito on the other hand did not receive the same appreciation. to the naked eye, there was a slight haze over the entire span. when photographed, you couldn't see the said haze lol. maybe from a distance it would. when it was all over with, we jumped in my car and continued up the hill to really take in the gg bridge. there are some old military baracks/bunkers left open for the public to see about your 1st 100 yards up the hill. continue up and you have small turn-outs where you can park and take pictures of the gg and/or san fran. continue to the top you will find more parking and a higher vantage point for view the enitire bay area with the gg in the forefront. very picturesque! there's tunnels, hiking trails and more old military bunkers, baracks and structures. some of the military buildings are scary looking - something out of a hollywood scare flick....or some obscure porn movie.\n\ni wanna go back. it was fun, but, would love to do this again in the burning hot sun - which is like 75F in this area! hahaha.\n\n*something to note, the north bound side of the bridge is for pedestrians and cyclists. the south bound side of the bridge is for cyclists only - no pedestrians.", "author": "watani f."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-12-23", "description": "This bridge is internationally known as a beautiful place to die.  The official estimate now is somewhere between 1300 and 1400 suicides enabled by this death magnet.  Those are just the bodies that have washed up on shore and no one is counting those which sank or were carried out to sea.  Likewise, no one can separate the number of accidental deaths from the intentional acts of self-destruction.  The fence is right around seat height for bicyclists, and on a windy day you can sometimes see riderless bikes leaning haphazardly against the guard rail.  It makes you wonder.   Eventually, unless a suicide barrier is built, this bridge may claim more lives than the 9/11 terrorism or the American casualties in Iraq.   San Franciscans will probably still not protest or make the obvious connection that the bridge is killing people,  because one thing they value more than life itself is a nice view.", "author": "David H."}

Jet skii's are not allowed in the Marina but we went anyway and got pulled over by the ocean sherrifs. Its okay, no tickets just a warning to never come back.  All in all, you can see so much more on jet skiis than you ever would driving in car.  Of all the things I saw, The Golden Gate Bridge was overwhelmingly incredible from underneath.  We skiied from one end to the other and drank a lot of salt water too because the waves were very strong.  A word of caution, it is very very cold jet skiing in the ocean, so you must wear scuba diving like wet suits to keep from getting hypothermia.  Not only that, ocean waves are very scary and a little bit tougher and more tiring to ski in.  Be very careful and wear tons of sun screen.
