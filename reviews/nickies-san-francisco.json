It was Sunday and I was craving eggs or french toast, because I'm predictable. A little after 11am, there wasn't much open in the area and I found a sports bar with a high rating show up on my brunch search -- Nickies. A little timid, I decided to check it out. An unassuming bar with surprisingly good food.\n\nThere weren't many people in the establishment yet, but a couple of ladies at the bar with DOGS, and I was living. Anyway, they let me seat myself anywhere so I took a booth near the window where I could people watch and also watch soccer on the TVs. The bar itself is large, with lots of seating, especially toward the back. Bathrooms are also clean, which I think says a lot about how you run a restaurant/bar.\n\nThey don't have a huge menu, for good reason, so when my server came around, I was set on the breakfast burrito, which comes with a free side, so I ordered the hash browns. I waited maybe less than 10 minutes for the food to arrive. For a sports bar, the presentation was beautiful and burrito was even better. I loved that they included little potato slices inside the burrito. A+. Also came with a side of pico. Hash browns were also hot and delicious, and a larger portion than I expected. Prices are what you'd expect -- around $13 for an entree, but honestly, life is too short to eat shitty food.\n\nFrom my perspective, Nickies seems to be a consistent, reliable go-to for no frills brunch food. I'd love to come back and try out that mimosa special next time.", "author": "Jordan B."}

Found Nickies on Yelp and definitely thought we should try it out! \n\nFirst off, if you are trying to find a place that is a crazy, fun, a place with loud music, etc. this is not the place to go. My group and I weren't trying to find a place like that, but thought of something more mellow but the same kind of vibes. Nickies was more of a calm place as a whole.\n\nThe bottomless mimosas in particular were pretty good, not the best I've ever had, but they got the job done. At one point, we asked the server if we could just have the carafe they were using rather so we could fill them up ourselves.\n\nThe food was really good too, definitely not something we were expecting. I got the breakfast burrito with the hash brown casserole. It was delicious!

I didn't want to drink before my tattoo but they had so many temptations it was a struggle to say no. \n\nThey were offering an awesome brunch menu when we stumbled in and though I wasn't hungry there is no such thing as too much food when you get a tattoo. I opted for a pancake. The bartender was kind enough to tell me they were quite large so I opted for just one. Thank goodness because they were quite large. 1 was plenty for a \"snack.\" When it arrived I cut it open and saw the yummy mascarpone inside. I added a tiny amount of maple syrup and bit into heaven. I get nervous about the first bit of any pancake - will it be mush, will it be crunchy, will it have flavor or just be weird batter. The mascarpone was great inside of the pancake. Great flavor. \n\nIt was so good in fact I told my wife we should come by after my tattoo and try their dinner menu. Yes, there are plenty of options in the area but c'mon a slamming fancy pancake for brunch necessitates a return trip... within a few hours if possible - haha.\n\nMany hours later, after my tattoo was finished, we wandered back in for drinks and dinner. We rolled up to the bar and settled in on the comfortable barstools. Why do I mention they are comfortable? My wife has trouble sitting at bars because her feet never touch the floor or the barstool cross bar. These however had the perfect size cushion as well as a foot rest. I feel for everyone else on the short side height wise, this is a perk.\n\nI ordered the rib eye and wifey opted for the shrimp po' boy. The rib eye was delivered about halfway through my beer. I don't usually like brussels sprouts but apparently, once drowned in sugar and vinegar, I am a huge fan! The rib eye had good flavor but the flavoring was a bit strong by the time I was approaching the last few bites. The potatoes were great and had the skins mixed in which broke up the texture for a nice change.\n\nThe wifey wanted more heat in her po' boy but aside from lacking the spice and heat she said the portion was nice. \n\nOverall, the vibe and food in this place are both awesome. \n\nCome in, watch a game, chat with some friends and enjoy this place.", "author": "Sabrina B."}

It definitely has the festive atmosphere of a sports bar - however, I was surprised how small their many flat screen TVs were... they looked to be 21\"? \n\nOur waitress was extremely nice but I had to prompt her after 45 minutes to ask about the spinach salad I had ordered when I first arrived. She explained, \"Sorry, I put the order in, but the kitchen is slammed\". I pointed out that two guys had sat down at the table next to ours -around10 minutes after I had ordered- and had been served their burgers already (they were halfway through when I flagged her down). She was very embarrassed by this, apologized profusely, and then said she would take my salad off my bill (a nice gesture). Minutes later, my giant spinach salad arrived. Nothing special but since it was almost 9:00 p.m. and I was hungry, it hit the spot. \n\nAnother thing is we had to flag her down every time we wanted a drink. When I ordered my 1st beer, my friend sat there with an empty glass and she didn't ask him if he needed another drink. He literally had to get HER attention to order another drink. I used to be a cocktail waitress and I was very surprised about this. \n\nOn a bright side, they have a good selection of beers on tap, and several good IPAs (my fave).  I also was pleasantly surprised how nice/clean their bathrooms were!!

This place is funny - from the outside it looks like your standard neighborhood bar, nothing out of the ordinary. But upon entering it adopts one of many faces: local watering hole, sports bar, English/Irish pub, brunch spot, dance-y DJ nights. It is pretty much a chameleon. This review is based solely upon the local watering hole / pub atmosphere, as that is the only time I've really experienced it. I have been here on game nights (MNF and ThNF) but ended up leaving after realizing it was game night and no tables were to be found. I wasn't going there to watch the game, just to eat, so moved on elsewhere.\n\nAnyway, I'm pretty sure the guy I'm dating is obsessed with this place. Actually, he's said so. And since I get bored easily (makes his life hard, huh?) I rarely will be one to frequent a place unless it is something special. Well, Nickie's, I guess you win. Drinks are always tasty and poured right (our personal faves? the Moscow and Kentucky mules), food is always delicious (I'm a fan of the grilled fish and garlic fries, he tends towards the fried chicken or mac and cheese), and service attentive (being frequent fliers probably helps in this area; the servers almost put the drink orders in as my guy enters the bar).\n\nAll in all a solid spot.

Our servers name was Meghan G and she was the worst server I've ever had in my life. If you get her I would ask for someone else. I went to the restroom and on my way back I saw our food in the kitchen window. We watched our server take drinks to all her other tables, take two tables' food orders and go up and down the stairs that lead to the kitchen 3 times before getting our food. The food was lukewarm but tasted okay. Our server was extremely impatient, rushed us the entire time, would ask if we needed anything and then not give us enough time to even respond. She was hollering at us from across the bar while walking up the stairs to another table, did not notice my empty beer or ask if I wanted another round; we had to flag her down from across the bar just to get her to come over to us. She took away our utensils/extra napkins before we were done, asked if we were all done & dropped our check when we still had a full beer & a double shot. We let the check sit there because we were not done and we were thinking about ordering another drink before we left. She came over again to pick it up and we said we weren't finished with it. She gave us a dirty look and walked away, then proceeded to go to the table next to us and talk about how she hates tables that sit there for super long and then tip her $5. She came up yet again and said 'well I've been here since 8am and I'm trying to go home now.' At that point I was so irritated I decided to write a list for her on the back of the receipt as to why she receive a crappy tip. She had the nerve to come up to us and start yelling at me about how I am passive aggressive and if I had an issue with the service I could have said something to her personally. I responded by saying you never gave us any time to let us speak. She continued to yell so I asked for a manager. I explained the issue to a female, blonde bartender (I didn't catch her name). She apologized and said her service was unacceptable. She told us to come sit up at the bar and bought us a round of drinks on the house.", "author": "Ashley A."}

You get the pic. The burger was good (though it tops out at 12 bucks after gouda and bacon are added to round it out). Fish and chips got the thumbs down, and the Guiness steak/shepherd's pie got the highest marks. Yum! I wish they had put the tortillas on the side, rather than beneath the goods, for the huevos rancheros, which was okay. (You know what you're getting yourself into when ordering plates with Spanish names at an Irish style pub -- or at least you should.)\n\nThe coup de grace? The mac n cheese. It is that good. Like THAT good. Or should I say gouda? They must have a gouda aficionado among the staff: can't remember tasting a better one, one that is flavorful and compliments its edible partners. It was the secret to the burger and to the mac n cheese. Do not come here without having tried the mac n cheese. Just don't. My table partners insisted it is the best in the world.\n\nFor brunch they serve mimosas and 5 buck (at the time of this writing) bloody mary's. With a crew, go for the full bottle of champagne w/OJ, rather than individualized mimosas -- this ain't grade school no more, and you'll save some dough.\n\nComfy, with a less rowdy & sloppy crowd than Dog in the Fog, plenty of TVs, and food that gets it done, albeit a few bucks higher than I'd like -- all in all, a trip here makes for a good game day!", "author": "Robbie B."}

He Dj's at Nickies quite often so i thought it would be a good time. The place was packed of course and drinks as always where hard to acquire. I live a block away on waller and typically dont frequent this establishment cause of the dark interior and crappy service, But tonight solidified my reason for never coming back.\n\nMy girlfriend works as a chef at a restaurant a block away on haight and she finished her shift so i thought it would be nice to go support our friend and grab a drink after her long shift of cooking for 100s of hungry people.\n\nWe grab a beer and go sit behind the dj in the back on the right. Finally able to relax after a long day. Sitting on the table is a half used book of matches. I decided to light one with a little slight of hand trick i know. Immediately i blow it out and forget that it even happened. Suddenly a very drunk curly haired monster of a girl come stumbling up to us and says \"What are you doing\" , mind you thins statement sound more like \"wvaaht rrrruu chewing\" I asked her to repeat her drunken statement and she got pissed and said \"oh no did not try and burn this place down\" i said what again cause its loud and i cant believe i heard what she said.\n\nNext thing i know she come up to us with a guy that looks like a mini asian dog the bounty hunter and his smaller, mute side kick. She points at us and says something. Suddenly i am being escorted out of the bar in a fashion that made me feel like a freaking criminal. Meanwhile my girl is livid, we just bought a beer that we didint even drink and we are being escorted out for lighting a match...Can one even be kicked out for that? i mean there are light candles on the table, should we kick them out as well?\n\nI tried to plead my case but mini Dog kept say we caught you on camera you have to leave now. What camera? Drunk Monster was gone for 2 minutes, I highly doubt you check any camera. And what would said camera show? Me lighting a match, blowing it out, my girlfriend laughing and us having a sip of beer.\n\nThe whole situation was bullshit and handled really poorly. Obviously the Drunk curly hair monster was banging one of the bounty hunter-esq bouncers to have such, excuse the expression, weight or \"pull\" to have an innocent couple who just wanted to hear some music kicked out.\n\nAfter getting kicked out we went to one of our favorite bars,,,Tornado, sat down at the bar and our favorite bartender came over and said he whats up guys? need a pliny. yes sir yes we do.

She even pushed her way past us to deliver a salad to a table while we were walking out.\n\nThe bottomless mimosas were great (and only $8 with a brunch purchase) and I enjoyed my eggs benedict, but their brunch menu is not super extensive.  Worth a shot if you are in the area and looking for a brunch place, but I am not so sure I will make a point of coming back here during my next trip to the city.", "author": "Maria K."}

It was nice to find a place that played most of the games and served brunch as we had a hard time finding places that did so. I got the corned beef hash and it was slightly different from the CBH I am used to. The corned beef tasted more like pot roast and was completely separate from any potatoes at all. Usually I am used to shredded corned beef mixed in with hashbrowns. Still tasted pretty good though. Others in our group complained that their potatoes were cold but mine were a decent temperature.\n\nThe only problem was our food took REALLY long to come out (30+ minutes) so that was annoying since we were starving.", "author": "Alexandra W."}

TVs everywhere since Nickie's doesn't have the big-box shape or feel of a traditional suburban sports bar. The beers on tap taste quite fresh, and they pour the best Newcastle pints I've ever had. Turns out that their website claims to have some kind of unique tap system. Alls I know is....no skunky tasting drafts, and I've had five different beers on draft there. Nickie's is now my go-to sports bar for big games.\n\nThe mix of people is both laid-back and fun/upbeat thanks to background-not-foreground music, usually from a DJ (iTunes?). Depending on the time of night you'll see more or less serious drinkers, people just hanging out, and the occasional family, all co-existing well. Yes, parents in the neighborhood will bring their children on occasion during the early parts of the evening or weekends. I don't have kids but I watched a college basketball game last night with my friend of 25 years, her two kids and mom, who was visiting from OOT. My friend's the person who'd recommended Nickie's in the first place since they live nearby.\n\nThe same person waited on my table for each of my two visits. She isn't necessarily smiley but she's pretty effective. Four of the five of us ordered burgers but we didn't get our Wed night $5 burger special in on time, just after 6pm. We weren't organized enough but you'll have that. Fortunately though, our server stepped for us and corrected the kitchen to take back 3 of the burger orders before serving them to us...so thanks to her!\n\nI expected a five-star burger after the server said, \"The fried chicken is great....The burgers are kind of famous around here.\" It wasn't all that IMO, but to my eyes it appeared to be a grinded and hand-formed patty. I wish it'd been cooked medium and not medium rare, but finally....a burger in SF that isn't OVERcooked! \n\nAt half a pound, it dominates the toppings and sesame seed bun. Love the sesame seed bun!  All of the ingredients tasted fresh, including the patty. The fries were good too, with coarse salt and herbs.

Not only was the food we had mediocre, but half the menu was unavailable (3 out of 5 of the appetizers we wanted to share were out), and the waitress told us this about 20 minutes after we placed our order which meant our food was even more delayed. Sorry to say that we aren't going back - not worth it. We miss the old Nickies.", "author": "Saman A."}

The best we knew how was with a well balanced meal - brunch. Our waitress recommended that we try the Nickie's burger and their breakfast burrito. So, we marched to the beat of her drum. She took our order and then the wait began. Part of it could have been our unrivaled hunger, but our meal took exceptionally long even on a busy day. At least our waitress was having a great time while we waited. And by that I mean she was taking shots with a table she was serving. Once our food arrived, we found it to be less than ideal. The burger was covered in mayo (top and bottom), which was surprising as the menu did not indicate that condiment at all. Honestly, who puts mayo on a burger? I debated asking her to bring fresh buns, but then realized that task might take longer than the food did. The breakfast burrito was subpar at best. There was so much tortilla that the only way to describe its consistency was that of a rock.

I traveled from Maine to Rhode Island to Buffalo NY testing wings at places people recommended.  I was testing purely on \"Buffalo Wing\" not honey hot, bbq, teriaki, etc..\n\nWhen I moved back home to the bay area I still had my craving for buffalo wings but everywhere I tried I felt like the wings were sub par.  too bready, not good sauce, not enough meat, etc...\n\nThis was until I found Nickies.  This place got the formula right.  Their wings have a great buffalo sauce, nice and crispy but the meat on the inside is very tender.  Apparently, cause I asked in a buffalo wing induced haze, they soak the chicken wings is some sort of flavored water (rosemary, salt, other spices), then boil the wings in that water, then fry them.  Its an incredible mix which rates these wings the BEST BUFFALO WINGS I have had in SF so far.\n\nIll keep people updated as I find more.  Long live the wing.\n\n- David", "author": "David H."}

For some undetermined reason, I was charged only $6 for the burger...needless to say, I did not push the kind waitress to explain this discrepancy. Maybe it was Happy Hour? Again, I didn't want to push my luck. The most likely explanation I could come up with, was that the Burger Gods were looking kindly down on me, after the Heat thumped my Cavs that same evening.\n\nNow to be completely honest, when I walked into Nickies in the lower Haight I had no intention of (1) Eating their burger or (2) reviewing their burger. This was a divey, sports bar/Irish pub; what would they know about burgers?! As I scanned the short brew pub menu, I noticed in big bold letters: Niman Ranch Burger. My interest was piqued; Niman Ranch, burger you say? I read on. 1/2 pound burger. ok. ok. Topped with Tillamook Cheddar. Waitress! I was hooked.\n\nI must admit, this was a solid burger and at $6, it was a steal. Again, the burger was pink throughout - just the way I like it - and the garlic aioli (a great touch) added a complimentary taste and texture to the burger. They didn't dump the garlic aioli on the burger either (a la True Burger). The Tillamook was a nice, mild cheddar that didn't overwhelm the burger or the taste buds. The bun, un-toasted, was good but nothing special. The kind waitress didn't know from where it came...other than to say \"from the bin.\"\n\nThe fries were very good as well; every last one having a nice crunch and/or crispness (whichever adjective you prefer to use to describe good fries) as Jenn could attest, as she \"helped\" me finish each and every one.\n\n\nSize: 1/2lb.\nRanch: Niman Ranch\nMeat: Cow\n\nBeer with Burger: Trumer Plisner draft: $6\n\n\nBeer Availability: A fairly large - 15 draft beers and 15 bottled beers - but uncreative beer list.\n\nAmbiance: Nickies seemed like a great place to watch sports - flatscreens were peppered throughout the bar - and drink.

There is a restaurant called the Joshua Tree in NYC, and a number of Irish Pubs which are just like this place, and it is SOOO needed in this city.\n\nThey have very comfortable seating, and different levels so you can watch a game in a smaller environment as well as the main floor.  \n\nI like that some of the employees are actually Irish, and everyone I've met there is nice.  \n\nThey have all the NFL games, college, etc.  Many large HD TVs, and good site lines all around.  Again, best bar for games that I've been too when you factor in comfort too.  Not sure if they show EPL and La Liga soccer, but they'll put anything on if they're open.\n\nTheir beer prices are VERY GOOD.  I think a Carlsberg, which is hard to find, is around $4.  \n\nPlus they have these REALLY GOOD BURGER DEALS for like $5 before 6pm, or something like that, with Fries (also good).  Everything I've eaten there I've liked.  Girlfriend is vegetarian, and she can eat there as well.\n\nI had fish tacos there which were surprisingly good.

They talk to themselves, and sometimes you, but after all this is San Francisco.\n\nAnd the bar completely transforms around 10pm on the weekend nights into some kind of Asian Club.

At least trusty old racer 5 can make it seem less cruel.\n\nI love that every time I'm here, I end up talking to the people next to me at the bar. So many places you go to and are totally isolated off in your own little group, but here everyone seems to want to get to know each other. It's something I really miss about the other cities I've lived in, and something that hardly ever happens to me in The City.\n\nThe food is okay. Not my favorite ever, but it's always nice to be able to nosh a bit while imbibing. The jambalaya was pretty good, and the chicken tenders somehow end up making their way to my table more often than I'd like to admit. Happy hour offers serveral appetizers at $5/each (chicken quesadillas, fries, etc.) and $3.50 or $4ish beers. \n\nI just can't justify the 5th star because as much as I hate to say it, I really can't stand it here on most weekend nights.

I came here during World Cup and it was a big mistake. The place was full when I arrived and they informed me that I wasn't allowed to enter. I told them that my friend had saved a seat for me but the rude door guy still wouldn't budge stating the spiel of \"we are over capacity\" etc. So then when my friend talked to them pointing to the free empty seat next to him the door guy remained unfazed and just continued denying people in unless someone left the bar. So I stood outside for about 30 mins or so waiting to get in when I should have just left. If it weren't for my friends being inside I would have left immediately. Anyways, while I was waiting I overheard some really nasty conversation between one of the waitresses/hostess and the door guy. This is what she said and yes I quote you there are her exact words. Keep in mind that she was about five feet away from me so I could hear everything. \"If these dumb fucks would have arrived early for the game then they wouldn't have problem finding a seat. Rude people.\" WOW!!! That's crazy! I think that waitress needs to get fired for sure. She has zero manners and skills. Lastly the door guy is as much of an idiot as the waitress as he let in some random groups of people who had gotten there AFTER me saying \"My boss is allowing me to let these people in. If the boss says it's ok then it's ok. Gotta follow boss's orders.\" What are you like 12? If your manager was smart which he obviously isn't by hiring some zeros then this business would actually be thriving and happy people would return to their establishment.

The night started out slow, not more than 10 patrons and the music kind of adapted as the crowd grew.  By midnight, people we grooving in the back in a make-shift dance floor.

So far, so good.\n\nI guess we got a little rowdier than we intended or expected to.

My boyfriend also told me we were being loud and making a ruckus, too.  I don't  remember that part, but I also don't remember getting 86'd, wandering off, or buying a burrito either.

It was their first night last night open to the public.\n\nWe decide to get a slice of pizza at Volare next door before having a night cap cocktail. Ain't nothin like a cocktail after yoga. or a slice of cheesy pizza. ahahahaha...\n\nI digress...\n\nThe re-incarnation of Nickie's is pretty remarkable. It looks amazing. And its the cutest damn bar in my neighborhood so now its my new neighborhood watering hole. The kitchen had already closed when we got there so I can't wait to actually try some of their food menu. \n\nYou should check it out. It's cute.\n\nThe only reason I'm dockin' em one star at the moment is because the beats were on repeat and we heard the same songs over and over. And we were only there for an hour. I'll be interested to hear what kind of DJ talent they bring in.", "author": "Matthew M."}

After reading the great reviews, I decided to stop in on a Friday after work.  Drinks here are pretty reasonably priced and the atmosphere is nice and chill, perfect for a Friday.  We had the fried calamari and mac & cheese to start.  I liked the fried calamari, though for the price I think Bean Bag is better.  The mac & cheese was good to me, but it tasted a lot better when I added hot sauce.  We split a fish & chips and the \"jambalaya\".  The jambalaya is more like gumbo, not that that's a bad thing, but you should know what you're ordering.  I'd definitely order the \"jambalaya\" again especially on a cold day in SF, it really hit the spot.  I'd skip the fish and chips just because they really absorb a lot of grease in the deep fryer more so than I've had at other places.  It's a great neighborhood place and I'll be back.\n\nFor cocktails we had a mango mojito and a bloody mary.  The bloody mary was super salty, and we had to ask them to take it back.  The waitress was super nice about it though and didn't charge us for it.  I always feel horrible sending things back, but she didn't make me feel bad at all.", "author": "Joann C."}

After waiting about 5 minutes for a drink the girl next to me got up and went behind the bar and asked me what I wanted to drink, I had no idea she was a bartender because she was sitting next to me talking with a friend for so long. \n\nAfter a few beers I went to close my tab only to see my bill at $71 for four Stellas and a plate of nachos. After a few minutes of argument they changed my bill to around $30 which made sense. \n\nMy sister ordered a Bloody Mary for herself and a Diet Coke for me, she had to order twice and they still didn't brink our drinks.\n\nThere was one girl with curly hair who looked kinda new and like she wanted to help us, but the other bar tenders stepped in and took over for her and completely ignored us.\n\nI am highly disappointed with the service here especially since I have lived in the neighborhood for several years and the service never gets any better.", "author": "Spryte H."}

By senior year she had gained some weight, wasn't looking so good and you didn't mind parting ways.\n\nFast forward 5 years later after college and you pass by her in a mall and you're like \"wow!\".  She's fit, well-dressed and smiling.\n\nSuch is Nickie's, upgrading from the divey place it used to be to this chic \"sort of\" dance club and I say \"sort of\" because it hasn't been really packed or had much dancing the two nights I've been there.  Yeah it appears they might've lost their liquor license (only beer and wine served) but I find the space and lighting to be enjoyable.  There's plenty of room to get around so hopefully you won't suffer too much elbowing when it gets more crowded.  Also props on having a bar in the back to save everyone from slogging through the crowd to get another drink.  Given this, the set-up can be a little weird.  It's like \"bar\" and \"club\" kind of co-existing in one big room.  \n\nThey have some pretty good beers on tap including the Speakeasy brews, Chimay, Trumer Pils and Leffe.  I do strongly dislike that they don't have a liquor license, this place has the perfect decor and mood for martinis and cocktails, not to mention 3 beers greases the wheels for a shot of Jagermeister.  Overall this place is a 3.5, I'm still searching for the half star to make this place the legit 4 I want it to be.\n\nHey DJ, turn the music down, it's Wednesday night and there's like 15 people here total, none of which look remotely close to getting up and dancing.", "author": "Steven R."}

There are numerous tables and chairs so this bar is excellent for smaller groups as everyone will be comfortable and able to be in the group.  The floor plan is well laid out and offers easy opportunities for groups to mingle with others.\n\nThe beer selection is superb as well as the pub food offerings.  The smallish menu offers a step above normal pub fare and will do more than just fill you up.  Honestly, its nice to run into a bar that offers this option.  Sometimes I want to grub and not have to find somewhere else to go or order freakin fried cheese or something equally unappealing.\n\nThe DJ spins a nice mellow mix and this is also a really nice plus.  What you'll hear is the live equivalent to XM Chill with some upbeat R&B and some well mixed hip hop interjected.  The volume is just right as well.\n\nThe bathrooms will rival Danny Coyle's for the nicest in the Lower Haight.  In fact ... they're nicer.\n\nThe staff is quite friendly as well.\n\nNow, when you pop in it will seem slow.  Hopefully NIckie's will catch on and reward the owners for such a great effort.  I'll be back again and again so they get my support.  Sometimes it takes some sacrifice as a customer to help a business through the leaner times.  That said...it is quite refreshing to me too that it is not crazy busy.

They're only a dollar, but I tipped them.  Keep in mind those prices are only from 4-6 PM, but here's what I loved about Nickie's today: I went in at 5:55 expecting only to purchase a beer or two but the bartender asked me if I wanted to buy more since the price was going up, then she kept them in the fridge for me (yes, PBR in the bottle the finest of the fine).\n\nThe place has food, from mini-burgers to salad to fish tacos, and apparently it has hard alcohol which I used to believe it didn't.  While it was more for cocktails, that combined with the cheap PBR gives Nickies an extra two stars.\n\nThe interior is classy, and I believe it does sort of have a coat check, or at least there are hooks to put your coat on underneath the bar.  There are tons of TV's and if there's a sporting event that is the focus of the bar for that night they put the TV on.  On Wednesdays there's a jazz band.  \n\nSome may say that Nickie's lacks an identity, but there are other places to go if whatever's going on there is not your cup of tea.  Nickie's tries to keep you entertained, fed and drunk.  If you don't  like it, maybe you weren't there at the right time.

I got there last Thursday night at about 11 and the place was not crowded, the 4 of us and we were able to get a table. The bar is pretty clean and did not smell like a bar when you walked in... which I loved. I hate walking into a place and smelling booze soaked into the walls. The DJ played good music, mostly 90's and some from early 2000's. Good crowd and good beer. Last night was trivia night starting at 8:15.

The baked mac and cheese is my favorite as well as the calamari. DJ usually plays really good music or they're usually playing a sports game on which is nice.

Drinks were flowing, the dancefloor was hopping, and everyone had a good time.\n\nHowever, when Juicy and I went last Sunday morning for a quick bite it was a total bummer. We had a meeting to get to in about a 1/2 hour, so rather than wait in line at Kate's Kitchen, we decided to give Nickies' brunch a shot.\n\nWe walked in and were completely ignored by the bar wench. We looked for a menu with no luck.  We saw that people were indeed eating brunch, but decided we'd try somewhere else. On our way out we noticed a menu on the door. The breakfast sandwich caught our eye, so we thought we'd give it a shot.\n\nWe go back to the bar sit down and try to get the bartender's attention. No luck. I figure I'll go to the kitchen and put the order in since we're in a hurry.  On my way there the bartender stops me and asks what I'm doing. After I explain she tells me to let her do her job. Well then, do your job and take my order. I explain we're in a bit of a time crunch.\n\nThe rest of our experience is pretty much more of the same. When the expediter brings out our food, he walks past us where we're motioning for our food and hands it to the bartender. She then carries it back around the bar and serves it to us.\n\nThe food was acceptable, but overpriced. An English Muffin with a scrambled egg and a side of taytoes (an and unexplainable garnish of naked spinach) for $8.\n\nOur mistake was going back after our initial reaction.  Overall the experience was tainted because the bartender was a little too preoccupied with her friends than providing any service to new customers.\n\nThey get one star for running after Juicy with her hat that she forgot.", "author": "SteveTwentyThree S."}

I have to say, the place looks great, but I'm shocked they put that much money into a Lower Haight bar when the neighbourhood hasn't caught up.

My dining companion had the gumbo, I had the fried stuff from the sea bascket (calamari, shrimp, cod and hand-cut fries.)  His gumbo was awesome.  Perfectly spices, with the king of juicy rock shrimp that burst in your mouth.  Not at all fishy.  9Usually, the smaller the shrimp, the fishier, but my big shrimp were shrimpier than his!)  Nice spicy sausage.  He scraped the bowl as best he could with his spoon- were I not there, I think his face would have been in the bowl.  What really made my mixed-fried-stuff basket was the sauce.  A spicy chipotle take on tartar sauce.  And the batter was AWESOME!  All the fishly things were in the same flaky, well-flavoured crust. The calamari and fries could have been a little more crisp, but I'm just looking for counter-points now.\n\nFor a Saturday afternoon \"don't want to to deal with the crowds across the street at Kate's or up the street at Magnolias\" lunch-with-beer-option, this was perfect.

But until I come here to do some serious \"drankin'\" (Yelp elite calibur drinking honeys!) , I'm just going with the four. \n\nSo yeah, John H. and I meandered here on a Sunday stroll down Haight. You know, one of those great walks that has no particular purpose but to enjoy the day. Since football season is over, walking has consumed my Sundays. Anyway like any given Sunday, we were in the mood for brunch (along with most likely half of SF) but weren't in the mood for an hour wait. Hmm...a sign advertising brunch drew us in and though it wasn't crowded at 12:30 on a Sunday, let me tell you, this may be a secret gem when it comes to eating brunch without (a) emptying half your wallet, (b) eating tasty food and drinking even tastier drinks and (c) mingling with a good staff and good crowd; I'm pleased to report/yelp that Nickies excels in all three categories. \n\nThe atmosphere is equal parts Irish sports bar and Haight hipster without coming across obnoxious/ pretentious (not an easy feat). Nickie's has a large layout with lots of seating throughout the bar. Low tables, chairs and benches flank the front left sides of the bar while the bar and its stools lay along the right. Towards the back are some higher counters and stools (including this bitchin' counter that seats six right in front of a big screen TV). Low lighting compliments the dark wood and I have to say I'd give this bar three stars for the niceness of the bathroom alone. Go for yourself. \n\nBrunch was a complete success for both of us. The huevos rancheros I ordered were a perfect balance of all components. The black beans and ranchero sauce were appropriately spicy, the eggs the right amount of runny and there was a healthy serving of both the avocado and potatoes. The tortillas sadly, were only 'eh'. But the Bloody Mary I had with my meal more than made up for that. The taste of black pepper was strong but not overwhelming. John got an egg scramble chock full of veggies topped with mushrooms and cheese along with his always enjoyed Big Daddy. The scramble was a hefty size and he claimed that all the veggies had a nice crunch and flavor to them. Our server was all decked out for the Sunday before St. Patty's Day complete with green glitter that was cute but not annoying. She was totally on top of her game so hooray for her. Both meals and drinks together cost well under thirty dollars and quite honestly felt like a steal. \n\nBut let me be honest, the whole brunch could have been ruined by one unintentional eyesore. You see, from my vantage point I was looking directly at large man ass crack. Yep, every time I looked over at my dining partner I was confronted by the tip of a blinding white moon. Now before you continue to wince/ laugh/ scream in terror, I do have to give the man some credit though. For starters there was no visible tufts of curly butt fur lingering about. Secondly, the guy was slightly aware of his fashion faux pas. He was considerate enough to hitch down his shirt in the back to the cover his plumber's smile but sadly, the shirt wouldn't stay. Ladies (and I use the term loosely with some of you- ha ha) haven't you ever been out only find the shirt/ pants you chose weren't quite cooperating with your body at the bar and you find yourself readjusting? That's what I thought.....Thirdly, I realized if I scooted over about a foot, I could use John's head as a shield from the view. Thanks hun.  \n\nSo yeah, what could have killed a lovely happy brunch or a stellar Bloody Mary or conversation with good company didn't. In fact, the whole brunch experience all together made me see the bright side of a Sunday without football. Even though it's still a healthy five months away, I've learned that it doesn't mean I can't enjoy the most chill day of the week. Cheers!", "author": "Veronica G."}

No longer is it a dimly lit sonic assault on your senses, but rather a wood-paneled and cajun-spiced type of a joint. Now that is fancier on the inside, it doesn't feel like a lower haight kind of place anymore, but considering that this side of filmore is in desperate need of renovation in general, I mark it up as a positive upgrade. The beer prices are on the higher side, though, and for just standard pub brews. It stings a bit, especially since you can go just down the street to Toronado and get premium beers for about a buck less. But, I think the ambiance is totally different, so you are paying for the mellowness. It feels like the most \"grown-up\" bar in the area, which can be nice every once in a while. One thing to try once you are here is the chips, which are actual thick slices of potato, fried. Not bad.", "author": "Tom H."}

The prices aren't bad either - everything was very resonable.  There is always music in the background.  It was never too loud that I couldn't clearly hear my friends around the table.

Once she got me to dance (and trust me, it is a sight to see if I could dare to flatter myself), she told me that I was a beautiful dancer and should be on \"American Idol.\" Got it gentleman! Take this \"American Idol\" to Nickies! (And I'll have another soju with ginger ale.)", "author": "Zulu Q."}

I dropped in on a Sunday night around 7 pm to check out the traditional Irish music which was amazing!  Nickies has traditional Irish music playing every Sunday night starting around 6 pm, so check it out!  Full disclosure ~ my roommate is one of the fiddlers and is amazing in her own right, but I digress....  I ordered the Spicy Jambalaya because, well, it just sounded right at the time.  I wouldn't normally associate Jambalaya with Irish music, but it worked.  The Jumbalya was filled with both shrimp and sausage and had quite a kick (thus the name spicy; yes, I'm quick on the uptake.).  The bartender doubled as the waiter and did an excellent job answering my questions while making sure I had everything I needed ~ he was great!  The atmosphere itself was part neighborhood, cozy pub, part trendy lounge; again, the mixture of themes didn't seem discordant.", "author": "Matt P."}

It has enough TV's to satisfy the various sports fans you might go eat with, has an eclectic (yes, sometimes an 80's punk rock song is followed up with a 90's hip hop song...) music selection.  They regularly have a variably of specials depending on the day/month/season but I especially love their mac n cheese, as well as their fried chicken.  Sometimes they're short staffed and the music can be really loud but then again it is a bar and it's a sports bar as well.  Pretty cleanly for the most part and now they have specials on some of their appetizers on different evenings.", "author": "Ive M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-09-14", "description": "I loved this place but am still a bit confused since it is supposed an Irish bar but trendy as hell looking just down the street from the projects. This whole neighborhood has been changing for years and Nickies is a welcome addition to that. Heard that it had been recently renovated and it looks devine. Very large, lots of shiny pretty wood accents and a great bartender. Unfortunately I don't remember her name, especially since we had been drinking before we got there. But I do remember she was sassy and efficient, just like I like them. What I do remember is that they serve champagne by the glass there and one of the glasses had the word \"sex\" in it. Had to try it. Wasn't bad. They serve yummy food per the nice boys sitting next to us. I tend to talk to strangers a lot. Keeps me from getting bored. I would like to say that I'll be back often but I can't walk home after drinking here. But I'll definitely be back when in the neighborhood.", "author": "Heather L."}

Call me a lush- but you just can't beat that, especially in SF, especially in this economy.  To  top it off we had a super nice waitress, they played good upbeat music and the food was tasty ( I had the garden burger).  Haven't been here at night- but I heard they have Magner's specials- which also ranks them tops in my book.", "author": "PDX t."}

Was I prepared for the pleasant surprise when randomly dropping in on a Wednesday night to finally check out the place after owner change and renovations?  Certainly not.   Live Jazz band, cozy atmosphere, great food at decent prices paired with friendly and accommodating staff in my neighborhood, walking distance from my house... I was so SOLD, right there and then!  I like the Wed Jazz nites the best although that very first week, I actually ended up going there three nites in a row.  Guess I wanted to make sure that I wasn't dreamin' that first nite.  The only, and really the one and only downside is that there are only a couple of tables that comfortably seat tall people... Most of the tables are too low.  So I'm hoping that either, I'll shrink in the course of time OR Nickies might exchange some of the low tables in favor of their taller patrons.  Oh, yeah, and maybe they could add an outdoor patio for their smoking patrons but that's probably going to remain wishful thinking.  Either way, I'll be back and recommend it for any night of the week that calls for a place to chill and wind-down.", "author": "Sabine W."}

Well let's try someplace new... that place looks cool. Nice exterior, the menu sounded pretty good too. Okay, lets try it. The inside was beautiful, there were less than 10 people in the whole place when we walked in around 6:45pm. Sweet, 15 minutes left of happy hour. We found a table in the corner, checked out the menu again, and after waiting for a few minutes realized that the solo bartender was in the weeds. Yes, you heard me right, 10 people in the bar (14 with the addition of my friends and I, but we weren't even acknowledged yet so we don't count.) and she's already totally overwhelmed. So we decide that waiting at the table is just rude when she's so busy, and we go to the bar to order drinks and \"nachos\". She was a sweet girl, we got our drinks and sat back down. ...time passes.... 45 minutes later we finally get our Irish nachos. They're okay, mostly cold though. We decide to give it another chance because a second girl has showed up to help. Cool, we'll order dinner and more drinks. It came out in about 30 minutes, still FAR too long when you're starving. During that wait, the DJ started. Definitely not what I was expecting. Kind of a house, hip-hop, techno mush. I can't describe it, except it was WAY too loud for any type of music. At this point we've been there for over an hour and a half. Barely got 3 beers each, and when the food arrived, it wasn't even that good, especially after waiting that long for it. Around the time the DJ started (8pm) the place started to fill up, mostly with marina type people. They seemed to be enjoying themselves. So if you're into that vibe, you may love it. I, on the other hand, would rather carve out my liver with a red hot spork.", "author": "Joy T."}
