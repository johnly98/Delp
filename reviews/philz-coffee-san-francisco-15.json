Right between the Embarcadero and Montgomery stations, this is a popular Philz location. There always seems to be a line out the door, but it does move at a decent pace. They also accept mobile order, which has been super convenient for me. I'd make my order, get off at Embarcadero, walk over, pick up my drink, head over toward Montgomery. \n\nThough with the convenience of mobile order, I feel that it's a bit rushed based on the taste of the coffee compared to ordering in person and waiting to mobile order and pick up. The mobile order at this location tends to be very popular if you compare the times of pick up at other Philz. I try to place an order before 8:20AM, and the pick-up time is 9AM, whereas other Philz is 8:30AM. Learned my lesson - order it before I hit that tunnel after West Oakland. \n\nI love getting the mint mojito (creamy cream, medium/light sugar) on hot days as it really cools you down. When I'm too cheap to spend that extra $1 on the mint mojito drink, I'll either get the ecstatic iced coffee (such a wonderful blend) or their Julie's Ultimate (hints of vanilla, berry, toast). Their dark roasts are all wonderful - a standard Jacob's Wonderbar for a more traditional dark roast, Tantalizing Turkish if you want that herby/cardamom flavor, Aromatic Arabic if you want that dark dark dark flavor. Yumness! You can customize your coffee by the creams (creamer, soy, vanilla soy, whole, 2%, etc) and sweetness (sugar, honey, artificial sweeteners, etc). \n\nThe baristas here are super nice, and I'd order in person every morning if I was willing to get up just a bit earlier allotting some time just for the Philz coffee, but unfortunately, I rather sleep in an extra 15-20 mins so I mostly mobile order.", "author": "Rita W."}

Despite it being a chain coffeehouse, everyone I know who's been to SF tells me that if I'm into coffee, I need to visit Philz.\n\nI made my way to this location one morning before work started - just to try it! The lines were out the door, but yet people were still lining up. This was a good sign. They specialize in drip coffee, meaning they make your drink on the spot when you order. You order with the barista and then slide down the counter to pay. They'll call out your order when it's ready.\n\nDespite the fact that I prefer my coffee with no sugar and just a splash of cream, I opted for the traditional light and sweet Mint Mojito. It was so good. The coffee was so smooth and the subtle hint of mint really made the drink pop.\n\nI liked it so much that I found another Philz close to my friend's house where we were staying and made us stop there before our road trip to Monterey.\n\nThe baristas were super nice and I thoroughly enjoyed my first Philz Coffee experience.", "author": "Michelle T."}

On market street in the financial district? Nope. Not gonna happen. The embarcadero garage is the closest mass parking option, and baby it ain't cheap. Like a lot of things in SF you are best served getting here some way that does not involve driving. Luckily there are literally dozens of other options including the cheap effective and popular trolley line.\n\nThere is not a lot of inside space-this thing is almost a walk up kiosk. There are some window counter seating, and a few loungy chairs with tables just to the left as you get in the front door. There are however a dozen or so table/chair combos outside, which only really works if the weather co operates. When it's sunny (pro tip-don't count on that before noon at the earliest) that makes a good choice, otherwise......well, there is another Philz about two-three blocks away (the thirst for coffee is real in the city yo) which will while still having a line, it's typically less of one.\n\nIt's not uncommon for the peak morning office coffee rush to be ten to twenty people deep. Yes, the coffee is that good. They don't do specialty coffees-non latte's, espresso etc (I could swear that they used to-both myself and my partner-who normally doesn't drink coffee-distinctly remember a exceptionally good philz mocha, so either that was a seasonal item/short term thing only, or we are both wrong which is possible) yet the pourover blends on offer are sheer caffeine delight. You've more then twenty choices grouped into light, medium, dark and tea blends and it's hard to go wrong. \n\nDo note that you've got to stand in line (the longer one) to order a coffee direct from the barista, then stand in line again to pay (this line will be by the pastry display case). The second line will be where you place any food orders as well. Philz typically has the best avocado toast in town, and the sweet options are solid as well.  Also know that the barista will be adding any cream or sweetener you may be wanting so if you desire those speak up when ordering. While there is always a line, it isn't always long, and it does tend to move fast. Philz is optimized for volume sales.\n\nSo the four stars are for the perfect pour overs, supreme baristas and delicious toasts not for anything else about this spot.", "author": "Steven W."}

I love all things mint, coffee, chocolate....so definitely knew I wanted the mint mojito coffee. I ordered that one half sweetened. It was still absolutely delicious! I drank it faster than I would have liked since I was doing some work there for a couple of hours.\nIt is a bit pricey for what it is though. +$1 for this and I got the smallest size, but still came out to just about $5.\n\nThe line was pretty crazy. I'm not surprised since this location is in FiDi. It definitely gave me time to figure out what I want since there were so many options and to kind of figure out what the ordering and paying system is. \nIt's different and unique compared to what I'm used to.\n\nFOR THE FIRST TIMERS, a step-by-step guide and narrative by yours truly:\n\n- Wait in line and figure out what you want. \nGood luck if you don't like mint and defaulted like be because there are so many interesting names and ones that sound delicious. \nIt's so hectic and loud that you almost feel bad asking too many questions.\n\n- If you make eye contact with one of the baristas and she's free, walk up to her (or him) and basically shout your order cause it's that loud. \n\n- Then walk to the right to the cash register and wait in line to pay. You tell them what you got. \nIt's a system of trust.\n\n- Then wait around and watch the hustle and bustle of making your drink. Good luck getting a seat.\n\n- Wait till either your name and/or order is called and you'll see the barista looking around and yelling while still trying to swiftly make the other orders.\n\n- Pick up your order, flash a smile and thank you, and bustle on out. Enjoy~\n\nRANDOM:\nI did notice something. The creatives are all about sitting at the window, opening a notebook, and then just people watching for hours. No writing, nothing.

Decided to take ol' Philz for a spin today and am seriously impressed by my experience! Located in the heart of SF's FiDi ( the millennial term for Financial District) - it's a happening little joint with food options as well including my fave Avocado Toast. Yum!\n\nI asked the friendly hipster at the counter what her recommendation was between the Chai & another tea called Istanbul Treat, she said the latter was her favorite. Be prepared to also get asked what level of sweetness and how much cream you like. They definitely cater to everyone's personal preferences, so you can be assured you get exactly what you order! \n\nLiked the playful candor between the hard working employees as well. You can see the teamwork and service with a smile which is clearly very important here! \n\nBack to our orders. My friend ordered the iced Mocha Tesora which was to DIE for ... perfect balance of chocolate with the quality coffee beans they use. Quite delicious, think I'll order that next time! Don't you just hate it when your friend's order ends up being better than yours? \n\nNot to take away from my Istanbul Treat tea. It was such a smooth, delicate blend of spice and cream and the honey paired nicely! \n\nOutdoor seating is also available, so you can observe her business men & women clad in work attire and a pair of sneaks as they hurriedly rush from A to B. \n\nLadies & Gents, you're looking at a Philz convert!", "author": "Jeanie B."}

I entered the coffee shop and it was surprisingly spacious and very clean.

The girl at the counter was very nice and friendly.  She quickly took my order and in a matter of minutes my drink was ready.

I usually get a frappuccino or a hot coffee, but I figured I'll expand my horizons and my friend was really adamant that I try it.  Thank goodness I listened because the Mint Mojito was delicious!

He's got over 30 stores in the Bay Area and as far south as LA and San Diego that he has got a cult-like following. Having met Phil, a local celebrity, he gives an aura of a cool grandpa with a Midas Touch and a twinkle in their eye. \n\nFor the longest time (it seems that way) the closest location from my work was the one near AT&T Park. I didn't mind stopping there before going to work, but traffic before and during a game made it quite a challenge. \n\nWhen I discovered he finally opened one location in the Financial District, I got giddy and my inner caffeine addict in me couldn't wait to strut the 10 minute walk into arabica nirvana.

Not based on whether or not the barista is making it (or saw/remembered the order )\n-Baristas were only announcing drinks for large orders (3 cups or more), or for people who inquired if their drink was ready.

And the Philz Coffee that I decided to drink this time was the New Matthattan Style Coffee and finishing it all it tasted really good and kept me awake through out the whole day!!! If I get another chance I definitely would wanna go back to Philz Coffee and try another Coffee style at Philz Coffee!!!", "author": "William B."}

Since opening in the early 2000s, this small coffee chain has become quite popular and synonymous with the San Francisco Bay Area. With over a dozen locations in the city, my first experience with Philz was several years ago in the Castro. Not long ago, we stopped by this location in the Financial District and the coffee we got hit the spot.\n\nThis location is busy with both tourists and workers. The cafe is centrally located to the Ferry Building and the Embarcadero, South of Market, Union Square, Chinatown, and the FiDi.\n\nThe cafe is located on ground level, at the bottom of a First Republic Bank office building. The storefront facade is all glass and both the inside and outside look nice and modern. Indoor and outdoor seating are available. Sitting outside is pleasant as there are many tables and chairs spread out across a spacious brick courtyard, away from the streets. Inside, the cafe feels warm, comfortable, and inviting. Access to the restrooms is restricted by a passcode.\n\nPhilz specializes in individually drip-brewed cups of coffee. During our visit, the coffee menu had over 20 blends to choose from including dark, medium, and light roasts as well as multiple decaf options. A small cup cost $3.50, large $4.50, and by the pound, $18 per pound. In addition, they offered other drinks like iced coffee, hot chocolate, and nearly 10 kinds of tea at similar pricing per cup.\n\nOne thing I like about Philz menu is even though there are a lot of options, they keep it simple. You don't have to be a coffee hipster to enjoy this place. Each coffee (or tea) on the menu is described in three helpful, aromatic words or less. For example, the medium roast Philtered Soul is described with the words hazelnut, cocoa, and syrup. The dark roast decaf Swiss Water Peru: cedar, earthy, smokey.\n\nI tried the dark roast, full body, Jacob's Wonderbar prepared \"Philz Way,\" medium sweet with cream. The drink was ready in a few minutes and its description (chocolate, nuts, clove) was spot-on. One of the baristas told us Jacob's Wonderbar is one of the company's most popular dark blends and I can see why. It's a very good, quality cup of coffee.\n\nGood service. I'd definitely come back.", "author": "Daniel B."}

I am a pretty picky coffee drinker and I rarely go to a coffee chain, such as Starbucks, to get coffee unless I am traveling.  It was hard to decline her invitation since she was so enthused about it; so I skeptically obliged.\n\nI must say, I did enjoy the coffee at Philz.  Unlike most of the dominant chains, you can always pick the flavor you like at Philz.  That was my biggest pet peeve with Starbucks - you never know what blends they are serving when you walk in. \n\nThe hand pouring of the hot water to brew the coffee seemed more for showmanship than any real practical purpose.  The blends of coffee are quite excellent with distinctive flavors that would probably meet the preferences of most savvy coffee connoisseurs.\n\nI tried Julie's Ultimate for my first visit since I prefer darker blends.  It had a nice toasty vanilla flavor on top of slight hint of roasted nuts.  This is a blend that may be habit forming for me.  I can see why Philz is so popular.", "author": "Louis C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-05", "description": "As someone with gold status at Starbucks (does that REALLY MATTER anymore though?) and really likes the consistency (generally) found at a Starbucks, going to Philz required a bit of a learning curve. Luckily I was there shockingly early and my fumbling at ordering didn't cause a hassle (I hope!).\n\nSince I've only ever ordered Philz from their truck I didn't know how they distinguish themselves from other coffee shops from a service perspective (it's easy to tell how distinctive Philz is from a quality of product perspective). At least the location I walked into, which I assume is similar and generally  consistent across the brand, there is a big counter with a few baristas. You order your drink from them and then shuffle over to the register to pay. This seems intuitive but for some reason I definitely hit the struggle bus a little by going straight to the register (probably because that's where the food was and I wanted food as well).\n\nSo, my first faux pas was not ordering from a barista. Then, I didn't realize the extreme care Philz baristas take with drinks means you basically have your own barista for your time and experience. You watch your barista make your drink and they had it over to you. If two people order the exact same drink and one comes out first- make sure it was your original barista. That was my second blunder here. My third mistake was not tasting my coffee before putting a lid on it. Apparently you're supposed to do a taste test and let the barista know how you feel about your drink. Whoops. Luckily I got a black coffee so it wasn't a big deal.\n\nI also got super confused about my food order. I didn't know when to expect it or where to pick it up. Eventually I figured I would trust Philz to guide me... and it came through! Somehow the person making my food knew my full name and called it out when it was ready. I have to assume it was from my credit card or a previous visit (again, to the truck) somehow?\n\nAnyway, my own incompetencies aside here... the coffee was/is fantastic. Hands down, fantastic. The avocado egg toast was wonderfully delightful and absolutely made me understand why other millennials have such a hard time deciding between it and buying a house. I'd likely go with the toast more often than not personally.\n\nNext time I go to a store location I'll know better. But, there will definitely be a next time, or basically and every time when I see Philz.", "author": "John T."}

Ugh, I can't do this afternoon coffee thing anymore-- I feel suuuuuper jittery right now, but for everyone who has regular coffee tolerance, I think the caffeine level is probably normal. I got extra cream in my drink and I think it may have diluted out the taste of mint-- I'd have loved for it to be a bit more minty! My coffee definitely tastes more like cream with a hint of mint than coffee. I did appreciate the fresh sprig of mint on the drink though. Also gotta drink it fast before the ice dilutes your drink!\n\nAdequate amount of seating on the inside, outdoor seating for when it's warm.

First, let's start with the eye-popper -- the price.  A large coffee at Philz is $4.50 where it's \"only\" $2.65 at Starbucks.  If you're into coffee volume, a large-size Philz cup is equivalent to a \"grande\" size (medium) cup at Starbucks.  OK. So the price puts you in the first class cabin.  Is it really worth the price?  So, second, how's the taste?  It's not as bitter as Starbucks.  Philz adds sugar and creamer as part of their service.  Nice!  Lastly, what's the final word on Philz?  My mind is not ready to cough up $4.50 for a cup of coffee.  Yeah, it's a great cup of brew.  But, on a daily basis, $4.50 is close to the cost for a meal.

The service was really friendly and I could tell they were trying to make sure everyone was happy.\n\nI ordered a small mint mojito iced coffee ($4.50). Very sweet and refreshing.

It is on the expensive side compared to Starbucks, but they don't charge for extras like almond milk like a lot of other SF coffee shops.\n\nThis is a newer location so it doesn't have the \"hole in the wall\" vibe like the original locations.

It's MUCH better coffee and the processes are better than a Starbucks type, but it's really not truly specialty coffee. The single cup \"pour over\" method they use isn't precise which kind of defeats the reason to do it in the first place. Plus the use of only blends (rather than single origin) isn't the way to bring out the true flavors of coffee. It's a way to make coffee more marketable to more people.

The coffee tasted like something new and delicious to me:) Not coffee so much as creamy divinity. Totally exceeding my high expectations.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no consistency with that deliciousness. I order the exact same thing (Iced Ecstatic, extra cream no sugar), and another barista will pour the hot water so fast, it floats all the coffee grounds and the coffee comes out tasting more like lightly coffee flavored water. Very disappointing. I'm not too concerned about the $4.50 + tip as I am that I walked over to this place and had something delicious in mind.\n\nI am lucky that my first experience was good. More often than not, I am getting a low end coffee experience, and it seems to be happening more frequently with time. I wonder if their rapid growth and/or general busyness has something to do with their diminishing quality assurance.\n\nI finally gave up on Philz. It's too sad knowing what they are capable of serving only to get served something significantly worse (either because a barista is not properly trained or in a rush).\n\nThank you for those 2 exquisite cups of coffee, Philz :D\n\n\n\n\nP.S. I realize I'm a bit of a coward, as I could probably ask the barista to prep the grounds by lightly wetting them first, letting them sit for a moment, and then pouring the water slowly and evenly over all the grounds, to extract more flavor.

But Philz...   \n...\nwell... \nit just...\n...\nlives up to the hype. \n\nBeware of the bizarre combination of techies and hipsters (and i dislike them both) that philz up this place. The line is always out the door and around the corner, but the coffee??? the coffee??? Is wonderful!!! Who would have thunk' it... Drip coffee has been revived and remixed. They serve drip all sorts of ways. With flavors that consist of: mint, honey, brown sugar, cardamom, nuts, chocolate, blueberry, hazelnut, plum, maple, herbs, caramel, beets (ack!!!), lemon, citrus, cherry, raisin, grapefruit... and the list goes on. So don't let the menu overwhelm you. It overwhelmed me my first time. For me, i finally found my sweet spot with the Philtered Soul that has a hint of hazelnut, cocoa, and syrup. Add a little bit of brown sugar to it and those flavors come right out. \n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. I know it can seem a bit froufrou. And I wouldn't advise on spending $4 on a regular drip coffee. So if you're the plain ole coffee type of person, then I recommend that you stick with your Peet's, anti-corporation local spot, or (I dare not mention the devil's company that's taking over the world with their own brand of GMOs) coffee franchise that originated in Seattle, Washington.  \n\nIt you're too lazy to doctor your own drip coffee, and don't mind attempting some interesting flavors, and don't mind spending and extra buck or maybe two, then you should try Philz. \n\nNow... this Philz, in particular has a pretty amazing staff. They're friendly and efficient. I feel bad when they have to scream to get some techie noob with his/her earbuds jammed in their ears listening to some new age blah. So check out the menu and PAY ATTENTION to your baristas. It helps the nearly infinite line move a bit faster. \n\nThe ambiance is unique for a coffee shop. Especially a chain coffee shop. It has a feel of your local spot, with the exception of the lengthy lines and the 3 to 5 baristas making 3 to 5 cups at a time. From what I've read/heard, the sandwiches aren't that bad... as long as you don't mind the gentrified prices.\n\nAll and all from what I've seen in my once a week experience for the last few months, they get a nine on a scale from one to ten. 4 and a half stars, but I'll round up since the staff is so friendly. I find that amazing since they're dealing with grumpy faces all morning long. \n\nSummary:\n\nGreat coffee \nGreat staff\nGreat ambiance\nLong lines (order ahead)\nFast pace environment\nHipsters and hype feeders will love the place.", "author": "Stephen G."}

I usually hit up one of the other chains in the area, but this place always has a line out the door in the mornings, so I thought, \"This place must be good!\" One morning when I got off of Bart, I noticed the line was short, so I took advantage and tried it out.\n\nFirstly, it was very confusing as to how you're supposed to order and receive your drink. It's not very intuitive to a new customer, but thankfully I got the gist. I ordered randomly from the list; I have no idea which coffee was good because everyone was only raving about the mojito drink on yelp. Since I'm not big on sugary drinks, I was forced to go out on a limb. \n\nThe coffee was honestly like mud. It was so thick and bitter. This is coming from someone who typically drinks coffee with a teeny bit of milk, almost black. I didn't even finish half of my small cup. Waste of $4. \n\nTheir pastries were very expensive too. The ginger scone was obnoxiously sweet and I didn't finish that either. \n\nOverall, for spending more than $7 on coffee and a scone, I felt genuinely ripped off.

I'm usually a big fan of philz but this location really needs to work on a few things. \n\nThere used to be long lines at this location, and maybe other patrons feels the same way that I do--because it's definitely not as busy as it used to be. \n\nThe baristas are not as friendly as the other locations, but I still came here because I thought the orderahead app was convenient. They messed up my order numerous times and I still came back (is the mint mojito just a mojito coffee if it was missing the mint?)

I didn't think the Tesoro was anything special, but the Ginger Snap and Mint Mojito are truly amazing. I prefer them hot, but they come Iced by default. I also enjoy the Ecstatic and the Hazelnut as well. \n\nHere's the catch, after coming here everyday for about 2 weeks, i had two bad ones in a row. No problem, I'll take a break, one week later I went back and it was still terrible. Even after adding another spoonful of sugar it was still very bitter (it was the mint mojito too). I'm not sure what happened but my last 3 visits have been misses. I'm hesitant to go back now for fear it won't be good for the 4th time in a row, but the times they got it right it was definitely a 5 star place.", "author": "Jeff W."}

The way they make their coffee is simple (just cream and sugar - with a few 'fancy' drinks if you want), and they have so many roasts to choose from; it's a great place to learn about how roasting can affect coffee. \n\nMy favorite is the Tantalizing Turkish with light sugar and cream, I love dark spicy roasts, and the mint sprig adds a lovely touch of flavor.

Sadly, quality has gone down as their business expands. I think it's another classic case of great things ruined by hipsters/hype. Before, their coffee had always been spot on and consistently awesome. Now, especially with this Front St location, the quality is mediocre, if not poor. Philz has fallen to a new low this morning when I got a super rude barista who had major attitude. I usually use Order Ahead to skip the line but Philz wasn't accepting orders through the app this morning so I had to wait in line. The barista I had the misfortune of encountering practically barked at me. He did not give me any greetings, barked \"what do you want\", never asked how much cream and sugar I wanted etc. When my coffee was ready, he did not call out my order but just let it sit there. When I took the initiative to ask if the coffee sitting on the counter was mine, he was like yeah and turned away, busy getting back into chit-chatting with his coworker. Unlike the usual Philz fashion where all the barista are always friendly and polite, always be sure to check if the coffee is to the customer's liking, this batista did none of that and was simply awful. The coffee he made was horrible too. I hope I would never see him again.", "author": "Nerdy P."}

However when I tried ordering two drinks, the girl who was taking my order refused to give me more than one drink, even chastising me on how I was being unfair to everyone else for asking for more than one drink. Despite telling her that the other staff said I could order however many drinks I wanted, instead of doing the logical thing and checking in with another staff or her manager, she just kept standing there saying no - rather rudely too. Despite what I said, she wouldn't listen and kept saying the same thing, how I was being \"unfair to others\" for trying to order more than 1 drink. \n\nPlease don't tell your customers they can order as much as they'd like and then scold them for doing so. It leaves a bad impression of your customer service and shows the lack of communication between the staff. I get it, it's free but that still doesn't give your staff the right to lecture a customer and call them \"unfair\" for trying to use a service they were supposedly being offered. Afterwards, I even saw several people walk out with two or more drinks in their hands. \n\nI am insulted!
