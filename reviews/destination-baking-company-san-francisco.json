Joe's comment regarding the number I was requesting was: \"What am I going to sell everyone else the rest of the day\", could I just give you six\". Really??\n\nLast time I checked I have never gotten a discount for more empanadas so the bakery still makes the same amount of money. How about baking more empanadas, or preparing more unbaked empanadas just in case you sell more? \n\nAnyways, I've decided to assist Joe with his apparent inventory concerns by moderating my visits to many less if any.", "author": "Chris L."}

The weekend seasonal fruit pies are also fantastic. I recently ordered a white peach pie that captured the essence of the in-season fruit and not drowned out in sugar. I also love their olallieberry pie when it is available. And the Thanksgiving pies, particularly the sweet potato, apple and mince meat are favorite selections.

They weren't busy around 2pm, but they had already sold out of a lot of items, so you'll have to come early if you want to see the full selection. I ended up trying:\n\n-Sticky Bun ($3.75): This was a giant sticky bun, but it was on the doughier/heavier side. I think they also added cardamom or some other strong tasting spice, which I felt ruined the overall taste of the sticky bun. I wouldn't get this again.\n-Mazarin (Almond/Raspberry) Tartlet ($2.85) & Apple Streusel Tartlet ($2.75) [https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=10SOO3BYbqk18UDM_XSVOg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg]: The mazarin was good overall, but the almond and raspberry flavors were very light. The crust was also very hard since I had it straight from the display fridge. This was good, but I'm not sure I would get it again. The apple streusel wasn't very good- the filling was too thin, but the topping was good. I think this would have been better if I re-heated it a bit in the oven first. I probably wouldn't get this again though.\n-Carrot Cake ($3.50): Yum- this was my favorite item from this bakery. The cake was moist, and the cream cheese frosting was really good. Recommended!\n\nThey also bake homemade fruit pies, but sadly, do not sell them by the slice! I hope that changes at some point. I would come back to try their other items if I was in the area, but would only come if it was earlier in the morning.

And then they wonder why I voted Bernie...)\n\n- Taste: 2/5 (who thought it would be a good idea to dip the whole croissant in butter after it's done cooking? Because that's the overwhelming taste here... Butter. Not like a subtle hint of it either. More like shoving a spoon of butter in my mouth kind of experience. The croissant can't actually express itself if it's covered in butter. When you go out with friends and decide to put 5 layers of makeup on, you gotta ask yourself: what have I become?

Cranberry scone - it was too dry for me, not than many cranberries.  The outer crust had a nice crunch. Wouldn't buy again.\n2. Sticky bun - way too many nuts. Most places have either pecan or walnut, this was topped with a lot of almond slivers out numbering the walnuts. The sticky sauce was not gooey enough and the bun wasn't that moist, between the 3 pastries, it was the only one I'd buy again. \n3. Cinnamon bun with raisins - a decent amount of what looked like Thompson raisins, Bun was too dry. We bought the one with the white sugar glaze, there wasn't much glaze compared to what a Cinnabon has. \nOverall, I think you'd fare better with the sticky buns at Devil's Tooth Baking Co. in the Outer Sunset if you really want buns.\n\nWe bought a fresh mixed berry tart to take to a friend's house.  \nThe place is a nice corner shop with a few tables for dine in.  We were looking for pies but they told us the pies were not available until 12:30 PM and only one flavor today - apricot.  I don't like apricot pies so we ended up at a Supermarket and got a small cake instead.\nThe tart was $24 and was \"OK\". The crust was cookie-dough like.

I work here on weekends and I obviously won't give an actual review because I may sound biased, but I wanted to address a couple of (bad) reviews. Hopefully things will be cleared up :) Feel free to ask me any other questions, but I guarantee you we pride ourselves with hard work and are passionate about what we do. (5 stars for having an excellent working experience with coworkers and customers)\n\nQ: I see pastries behind the counter but am told there is nothing left to buy. What's up with that??\nA: The food that you see on the racks behind the cashier (and occasionally behind the counter because we have no room) have already been reserved way in advance! The reservations range from a week to 48 hrs in advance. If you keep coming into the bakery and never see your favorite pastry, reserving is the way to go!\n\nQ: I've seen the workers grab tips for their own, what an untrustworthy employee! Why should I come here if workers feel entitled?\nA: If you see workers grab tips, that tip BELONGS to them. Say if one worker was at the cashier for X hours and then another worker comes in and takes over the cashier. The tip that is already available in the jar should belong to the one that actually worked the cashier! Trust me, we're fair about this.\n\nQ: I called in advance for an item but when I arrived there was none left! Why would you lie to us and waste our time?\nA: When someone calls to ask whether or not we have a certain item and we say we have the item, we actually do have it. What probably happened was that the item was sold by the time you arrived (a lot can happen in just a few minutes). We usually have a lot of items stocked but there have been occasions where we run out of pastries (sometimes everyone likes to come in super early all at once and order in bulk!). Again, it's best to reserve, reserve, reserve!\n\nThose are just a few that I wanted to address and this is through MY experience only. I hoped that helped!

I looked around for one for a while and had a hard time finding a bakery that made one.  I found that Noe Valley Bakery makes one (that is about half the size and half the price) but it is non-traditional. Even though it sounded great (chocolate-almond filling with an orange glaze) I wanted something typical of New Orleans cakes since my boss went to school in NoLa.  Destination's King Cake was $30 and made about 16 generous slices.  I cut a couple of them larger than others but if I had been more uniform and modest in my portions, it would have easily cut 18 or even 20 slices.  The cake was perfectly fresh and delicious.  The cream cheese filling and brioche dough make it taste like a big Danish - yum.  They insert the little plastic baby after baking, as a safety precaution, and everybody digging in, hoping to get the special slice was a big hit in my office.   \n\nIf ever I need another Gallette de Roi, I will definitely order from Destination.", "author": "Emma H."}

I let them know that I would be back shortly and when I came back 30 minutes later, the owner himself said that he'd given away my pie. I seriously thought that he was joking and pulling a prank on me... But he looked at me as if I was the one in the wrong and proceeded to not apologize or you and feel remorse that the situation had happened. By this time of course all the pies were sold out... And it was only 2 PM in the afternoon. So this was a classic Seinfeld situation where he reserve the pie but he did not hold the pie...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-08-16", "description": "Wow, talk about time travel.  I last reviewed Destination Baking Company back when I first started Yelping.  That was a long time ago, and this update is long overdue.\n\nDestination Baking Company currently operates a stall at the nearby Glen Park Village Farmers Market on Sunday mornings so I've been enjoying their baked goods even more lately.  The selections change every week so if you're looking for a specific item that isn't featured at the farmers market you can just walk up to the actual bakery a few blocks away.\n\nI've noticed they usually have three to four types of breads, a sweet selection such as their chocolate chip cookies and seasonal baked goods using farm fresh produce.  I've never tried their breads because I'll admit I'm a bit bias in favoring the Acme Breads store at the Ferry Building, but I usually go for Destination's seasonal goods.\n\nSeveral weeks ago I was floored by the beauty of their Apricot Galette (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c2s4NY6M7NuD6FOWDa7YCw?select=SZ6m_Ze0zrucrE2q-HtTFA) so I just had to try one (or two).  These aren't as mind numbing gorgeous as the fruit galettes featured at Frog Hollow Farms, but I've got a bit of bias there also that I'll cover in an upcoming review.  For most of this apricot season I've noticed that the little stone fruits aren't quite as sweet as they have been in recent years.  These galettes featured at Destination Baking use apricots from the ApricotKing orchards in Hollister.  The galettes had a good flaky crust with some coarse sugar sprinkled on top.  The quartered apricots swimming in their own juices inside the pastry were quite soft, but as expected the fruit was on the tart side.  In this case the coarse sugar granules on top really helped to tone down the tartness of the fruit.  In my opinion these galettes were very good.\n\nThe Gravenstein apple season just opened a mere two weeks ago, and right on cue Destination Baking featured fresh Gravenstein Apple Galettes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c2s4NY6M7NuD6FOWDa7YCw?select=2oCu2yRGLxCaNsv3DWGhww) in their farmers market stall this past week.  Similar to the apricot galettes in preparation I found the apples a bit on the soft side, but the fresh flavor of the Gravensteins stood out well.\n\nWhat won me over in taste however was Destination's Potato Pesto Flatbread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c2s4NY6M7NuD6FOWDa7YCw?select=jZoXybEx8Wa_b_9KeSOWow).  These were absolutely incredible after I wrapped them up in foil and baked them back up hot.  The golden flatbread was crispy on the outside and soft and chewy inside like a really good pizza dough.  These are layered on top with a generous spread of pesto, thinly sliced skin-on red potatoes and a mild white cheese.  I bought two at the farmers market, but had I known these were so incredible in taste I would have bought more.\n\nI enjoyed the first one just on its own, then paired the second one with a ragout I created using fresh oyster mushrooms from Far West Fungi, white turnips from County Line Harvest, fresh beans from Dwelley Farms, zucchini, onions and fresh herbs from Smith Family Farms and tomatoes from Frog Hollow Farms.  So darn good that I'm loading up on the Potato Pesto Flatbread the next time I visit Destination Baking.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

Brilliant.\n\nMy favorites were the sticky buns with mixed nuts (such a generous helping of nuts!) and the cinnamon rolls, which I guess tells you I like that dough of theirs. The cinnamon rolls had a nice almost frosting to them which was very vanilla-y. The cherry danish seemed a tiny bit stale and I would have preferred a jammier fruit spread out more. The dried fruit scone (you can choose which dried fruit you want) definitely was not sweet - this was the only one that I tried a little bit of and was not tempted to have any more. I was surprised that I didn't like the sour cream pecan coffee cake too much - it was TOO sweet and gooey for me but maybe would work for others. I liked that there was a no dairy option (Italian coffee cake) but my lactose averse partner has not told me how it is yet.", "author": "Lisa K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-12-24", "description": "Destination is a small bakery with a decent variety of offerings for the size. But I would not necessarily recommend it, at least not a trip out of your way, because I'm not a huge fan of the food. When I buy something from a bakery, I want to take a bit and think \"darn am I glad I bought this because I could not make this at home.\" My feeling every time I get something from Destination is \"well, I coulda spent that money on the ingredients at Safeway and had four of the same thing in an hour.\"\n\nHere are my specific complaints. and all of these apply to every trip I've made to Destination: 1- The pastries are drier than I like. In fact, I almost always need a glass of milk or two to wash the pastries down. 2- This may be a factor of timing, but the pastries are never warm. I'm not counting this complaint in my rating. 3- The pastries don't taste like anything super-special. For me, that's a huge deal. A substantial portion of my belly came from cinnamon rolls at a bakery in Vernon Hills, Illinois, and I think that quality of cinnamon role should be a good baseline. Basically, it's a personal failing and character flaw that I expect the world's best of something to be an appropriate baseline.\n\nThe reason I ranked this two is that the definition of three stars is \"A-ok.\" The definition of two is \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" And, in that description, Destination is absolutely two stars.", "author": "David H."}

They're so good that I make a special Sunday trip there just to pick up a pair.  Imagine a devilishly generous portion of warm, oozing, top-quality chocolate resting inside a pastry crust that's somehow both flawlessly flaky and decidedly doughy.  Hints of honey and sugar and heaping spoonfuls of time, artistry and love finish off the pastry in fine fashion. \n\nIf but once in life, every San Franciscan should double park and hazard light it up to experience this awesome take on a French classic.", "author": "Brendan S."}

My favorite is Banana Cream Tart. It seems small, but it is a big burst of fresh banana and sweet cream, with a soft crust that makes the whole thing melt in the mouth. I adore their other fruit tarts too, which is always fresh and juicy. So far, I only had the Red Velvet in term of cupcakes, since I always hated cupcake frosting - but not since I tried it here! The sweetness is just enough and the frosting is soft and goes well with the cake. I also like their crostata and Italian coffee cake.\n\nSince they do buy-one-get-one-free after 2pm, I like to get one croissant to eat immediately, then another for night dessert at home. My favorite is the chocolate. Pop it in the toaster oven and there goes a mouthful of warm chocolate and buttery flakey goodness. \n\nCoffee is ok for a bakery, but you get free refill. If you are really picky, there's always Cafe Bello just over 2 streets away.\n\nPeople here are friendly, and I enjoy doing my readings here.

All the yelpers that recommended the chocolate crossaint were absolute 100% correct. It is DELICIOUS-O-SO GOOD! lol. I'm not even a fan of chocolate, but I totally crammed down two of them in one sitting - yum~ The gentleman that commands the register is really nice. I've tried almost all the danishes and seriously, the texture has just the right amount of crunchiness (is that even a word?) and softness. Also, did you all know the French Bread is ONLY $2.25?!! So do NOT buy french bread at Canyon Market when you can walk one block up Chenery and get it for WAY CHEAPER. In my opinion, DBC has a bit more crunch to their breads compared to Canyon Market.\n\nOh yes, don't forget...after 2pm danishes and croissants are buy1get1free - that's why today is: TGIF with (not a cherry) a choco croissant ** on top ;)\n\n*If you take the bart...get off of Glen Park (duh) ...walk one block down diamond street toward chenery...then make a right on chenery...walk 1 block up that hill and the first street on your left is DBC~ \n\nAnd YES, they take credit cards.

I can't compare them to other places because I haven't had red velvet anywhere else.  They're very sweet, smooth, and with cream cheese frosting.

Not a winner for us.\n\n* Empanadas with chicken, corn, and jack cheese - very rich and satisfying!\n\n* Pumpkin walnut muffins - excellent flavor, moist and pumpkinny!\n\n* Corn muffins - okay.  Not a top pick.\n\n* Chocolate and almond croissants - divine, high quality pastries, but too buttery for my husband and me.  We skip these, but know they are very popular.\n\n* Breads - We love the challah and white bread (my son's favorite for toast).  Generally a fan of whole grain bread, Destination's 9-grain isn't our favorite - the grains are too large (my son won't eat it, but will eat most multigrain breads).\n\nOur favorite items are still the:\n\n* Lemon Tartlet - can't be beat - magnificent tangy lemon goodness.\n\n* Mini Chocolate Bundt Cake - made with sour cream, fudgy,  occasionally overbaked, but when perfect, it's heaven!\n\n* Chocolate Chip Cookies - high chocolate chip to cookie ratio and very tasty.\n\nI like that they sell organic grapefruit juice, among other drinks.

After 15 years of searching every Safeway and Lucky's to find the elusive Mrs. Smith's mincemeat pies for our holiday table, I have grown to loathe it.  \n\nThis year, something different happened.  I was driving by Glen Park and something made me turn up Chenery.  Something made me find an empty parking spot right in front of a business I had never seen before.  It was called Destination Baking Company.  *cue angels singing*\n\nI stepped inside and the aromas of pastry, cinnamon and sugar wafted over me like olfactory snowfall.  I saw a tray of pies.  I asked, \"What kind of pies do you have left today?\", never hoping to be so lucky...\n\nMincemeat.  He said mincemeat.  He pulled out the pie and showed it to me.  Flaky, perfectly baked crust with sugar crystals on top.  Beautiful!  Christmas was saved!\n\nI bought the pie, and 2 chicken empanadas (my husband's other favorite food), and a sugar cookie to soothe my frazzled nerves.\n\nNeedless to say, everything was DELICIOUS.  The empanadas were full of meat and vegetables, with a buttery crust, and heated up perfectly in about 10 min in the oven.  But the pie, oh the pie.  Perfect filling, perfect crust.

Very relaxing and low-key environment.\n\nI'm not a big fan of super sweet baked goods but I have a weak spot for banana nut bread.  Most of the banana nut bread I'd had were rather dry, crumbly and in room temperature.  Not so at this place.  Their banana nut bread was so moist it literally melts the moment your tongue presses it against the roof of your mouth.  It's so incredibly tasty you want to savor each bite.  I cannot help but smile when I'm done with my last bite, thinking this piece of bread just made my morning!\n\nI had always been a skeptic when it comes to buying coffee at a bakery; don't quite know why.  But I tried their coffee one day when I ran out of coffee at home.  Since I brought my cup, they only charged me a dollar for a big cup of coffee.  Speaking of taste first, it's strong enough for me to taste its freshness (I've been drinking coffee for over 20 years and have been drinking it black for the past 4 or 5).  Not only that, it has enough caffeine to give me a slight jolt!  That's rare.  \n\nAll in all, great place!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-11-03", "description": "Let's start where I usually start at Destination, which is with the croissants. They are the best I've ever had, anywhere. I spent a week in Paris this year and didn't  find any croissants quite as good. And I looked. Joe's croissants are loaded with butter but manage not to be greasy. They have a very mildly sour taste, in a good way, the way very high quality butter like Strauss gives off a tiny bit of sourness. And they are crisp but not burnt. The plain croissants are particularly good. I have had dozens of them over the years and the quality has never varied.\n\nNo, they are not dense and bread-y, as another reviewer commented, albeit disparagingly. If you go around the corner to Pebbles Cafe, which carries products from Bay Bread, you can get this kind of bread-y croissant. It is vastly inferior to the Destination croissant in my opinion. It is unnuanced, unchallenging, and uninteresting, more or less just a roll and not really worthy of being called  croissant.\n\nMy partner usually starts with one of the cinnamon rolls, a sticky bun, or a bear claw. These are equally yummy - yeasty, buttery, and sweet without being cloying.\n\nAfter lunch, I often drop in at Destination to get one of their small pastries. They are yummy, perfect with coffee, and not too large, very suitable for an afternoon snack without stuffing one's face. \n\nI think of San Francisco commercial pastry generally as a sad state of affairs, partly because the product is often so large and at the same time so tasteless. Eating a chocolate chip cookie can be like eating an entire stick of butter. Scones can be big enough to feed a family of four. Not at Destination - smaller sized things, but very high quality, and that's just how I like it. The fruits used in tarts there are especially good - very high quality apricots and strawberries. I have spoken with the owner about this and he has told me that he sources much of his produce from local organic farms. I am not an ideologue when it comes to local produce and sustainability issues, but trust my taste buds, and Destination has given them some very nice moments.\n\nCakes are very good, too. A few years ago, we ordered our wedding cake from this bakery. It was beautiful, and unbelievably tasty. \n\nDestination is far and away my favorite bakery in San Francisco. How it has escaped a mention in Patricia Unterman's San Francisco Food Lover's Guide for all these years is just beyond me. \n\nI so want to love Tartine - the place is beautiful, and so is their product, and it's such a cool scene, and it's closer to where I live.

They were dark brown and not as fluffy.  Honestly, they looked more like crescents.  I was skeptical but I tried the chocolate croissant and though it wasn't the prettiest it was excellent.  It's flaky on the outside and denser than usual.  Definitely made with plenty of butter.  It needed more chocolate but that's a minor flaw.  \n\nThey only had two cupcakes left: vanilla cake with chocolate frosting.  This was my first time receiving a cold cupcake (refrigerated) and I didn't like that aspect too much.  The cake was undeniably dry.  The frosting was hard (well it was refrigerated) but I will say that it tasted like they used good chocolate.  I liked the chocolate non-pareil they put on top.  But I don't think cupcakes are their forte.  \n\nI sampled a white bread that was very good - chewy crust, tender inside.   They also serve up espresso drinks.", "author": "Lolia S."}

I also didn't know there are a dozen adorable shops on Chenery.  \n\nFollowing my cousin's advice, we walked a bit on Chenery looking for THE bakery.  No wonder she forgot the name: there are no huge, visible signs outside.  \n\nThe inside is clean.  Actually, a little too clean.  Apparently we were there too late (around 3 or 4ish on a weekend), and most things seem to be sold out already. \n\nSo we bought a tart and a bread pudding.  My husband said the tart was okay, but the bread pudding we shared was quite good.  Egg-y, buttery, sugary on top, and has raisins.  Reminds me of nice bread puddings served in restaurants.

I want to be a cool Glen Parker and fit in with the hip, up and coming neighborhood. \n\nBut I can't.\n\nThere's another bakery out there (rhymes with sateen) that has totally ruined Destination for me.   \n\nI ordered a lot because I didn't want to miss out on ANYTHING. \n\nLet's begin with the tartlets:\n\nI had the chocolate, mazarin (raspberry/almond), and banana cream. I prefer a flaky crust over the crumbly one that is offered at Destination. The fillings are simple, but unimaginative. Chocolate too rich, raspberry too sweet, and banana cream just left me wanting something more.\n\nOn to the cakes:\n\nIt's true that they keep their cakes in the refrigerator. I suspect that this is necessary because it's like 80 degrees in there. The ovens are literally 10 feet away from the cash register. \n\nThe cold cakes (cupcake, carrot cake, moon pie) make the frostings hard, so I waited for them to come to room temperature before enjoying them. The cupcake was yellow bottom with chocolate top. My favorite combination of ALL TIME. To my dismay, the cake is super dry! Like sawdust topped with chocolate ganache. :( Majorly unpleasant. Cupcakes, in my opinion, should be frosted with frosting and not ganache.The carrot cake was okay. But totally like something I make. Not something that I would pay for.  With so many glowing reviews of the moon pie, I was saddened with the fatty, tasteless confection that I purchased.\n\nThe shining star was the chocolate croissant! I love the small shape and the sprinkle of salt on top. Terribly chic! Nice and flaky and just the right amount of chocolate. \n\nI threw in a loaf of plain challah at the last moment. I like how they don't over bake it. I like my challah a little pale. After I dry it out, I'm going to make Sateen's bread pudding with it tonight. :D \n\nOne last note about pricing. While the Destination banana cream tartlet is a mere $2.50, there really isn't anything in there besides banana-flavored custard and cream. Sateen's banana cream tart has chocolate, caramel, sliced bananas, custard, and cream for about $5. And about 10 times the size of the tartlet! I know where to get more bang for my buck!", "author": "Jacquee P."}

The neighborhood is quiet at that time and there are places to park. \n\nThere were numerous hot, fragrant baked items just coming out of the ovens... I chose four pastries-- a chocolate croissant, a plain croissant, a cherry Danish, and a giant cinnamon raisin bun. I gave the plain croissant and cinnamon bun to co-workers and didn't get to taste them, but another co-worker and I shared the chocolate croissant and cherry Danish. Both were still warm, and made of flaky, crispy, chewy, melt-in-your mouth dough... I didn't even know a bread item could be all those things at once until I tried Destination Baking Co's treats! \n\nThe cherry filling of the cherry Danish was tart and delicious and obviously made from real cherries (they probably don't have this Danish in winter, but maybe they'll have apple then). The chocolate croissant has just the right amount of complex, dark chocolate filling, with some coarse sugar sprinkled on the top of the bread. it could definitely cause a chocolate croissant addiction.\n\nAll four pastries together were $9. The cinnamon bun is enormous and definitely enough for two people to share, and the bakery makes all their dough fresh (many bakeries have freshly baked pastries, but most are made with frozen dough, frozen cinnamon rolls, etc). They use organic ingredients when possible, so I think the pastries are a good deal!", "author": "Dani Y."}

I've  been to this place a handful of times, and I have never been disappointed. I usually get their croissants, because they are the closest to the ones I remember in Paris. I also picked up their baguette, hoping to find a place that can make those baguettes that are ubiquitous in France but impossible to find in the US, even in foodie San Francisco. Well, their baguette isn't it, either, but not bad! I got mine still warm from the oven. It was sour dough and I am afraid I am not a fan of sour dough (I know, sacrilege!), but theirs was yummy and fresh. The coffee was also nice and I appreciate how they put out soy milk for those of us who prefer it.

But I still log on everyday and read reviews from my homies and stalkees (aka friends and favourites, respectively).  And today, I was hit with this feeling of..  \"Oh sigh.  I wish I had reviews to write.  I wish my Yelp page weren't so pathetic-looking.  I wish I still felt something.\"  Then my cold, cold heart melted a little, and sitting there in the thaw, was my love for Destination Bakery.\n\nAnd speaking of renewed loves:\nI *just* saw John Mayer's VH1 show - \"John Mayer has a TV Show\" - despite its old news.  Yeah, I live in a hole, where we only watch Deal or No Deal and other manner of terrible things.  Anyway.  He's hilarious.  And I love (watching) him.\n\nIf only John Mayer worked at Destination.  I'd go everyday.  And I bet you their tip jar would be spilling over.  \n\nBut even though he doesn't work there, I still manage to make my way over there occasionally.  I've only tried: lemon tartlet, baguette, bread pudding.\n\nOk, so the lemon tartlet was just like any other tartlet.  And the baguette was a baguette.  But then again, my baguette palette is not awesome, but I generally just LOVE bread anyway.\n\nBut there are two reasons I keep coming back:\n1) The bread pudding.  Despite the fact it has raisins (BLECH) and is a bit too sweet and maybe is not doughy enough...  I do Really like it.  And to be honest, I'm pretty sure I like it more than the Tartine bread pudding that I had only once.  It has this lovely, burnty sugar appeal on the surface bread peaks.  I also love that the flavour is tinged with buttery and vanilla-y goodness.  And it's a HUGE piece for a mere $2.75.\n\n2) Part of the appeal also lies in that fact that it has such a corner bakery, neighbourhoody feel.  There are always a few people inside and/or outside, just chillin with a snack and a newspaper.  And even though it's not in my 'hood, it's still within walking distance.  Combine that with the homeyness, and I just cannot help but love this place.  It's my great weekend treat to make my way over and get a piece of bread pudding (lasts me two days since I discovered the concept of portion control).  I certainly deserve it after climbing the hill that is the end of Noe Street to Laidley (yeah, it doesn't sound that impressing, but my chest pains beg to differ.  Google Map:terrain that 'ness, ok?).\n\nAs added bonus: The pies at Mission Pie are baked here - anyplace that enables my pie consumption is delightening beyond comprehension.\n\nI am determined to visit often enough and order the bread pudding each time, such that someday I can just roll in, give a knowing nod to the dude at the counter, and say \"i'll have the us(ual)\" (How does one spell that phonetically?  \"yujje\"?).  Yeah, that's right, I've got goals.\n\nWhile we're on the topic of nothing in particular, here are few more tidbits of random trivia/my feelings:\n-I am going to start eating my cereal with water.

The chocolate version is sinful, and when paired with a cup of coffee, you'd swear Twin Peaks is the Eiffel Tower.\nIf you're looking for the best Challah bread, go to Destination on Fridays, and buy one...but think about buying two, because once you taste it, you wont be able to stop.\nThey also make sublime baguettes daily that are irresistible, not to mention fruit galettes, killer cinnamon buns, chewy chocolate chip cookies (with and without nuts) cupcakes, moon pies, and wonderful savory choices like empanadas!\nThe bakery's employees are the real thing - friendly, funny, and such a big part of the great feeling you get upon entering. \nIt's a little gem of a place, and once you go, you'll be back, like all the Glen Park residents and other fans alike!\nOh, don't let me forget to mention the PIES!

Thus lured, we rushed inside and found a smiling man standing before a huge baker's rack of pies. \"What kind of pies do you have?\" I asked. \"Apple, pumpkin, cherry, mincemeat--\" I stopped him right there. \"Did you say mincemeat?\"  I demanded. No one ever has mincemeat. Sometimes I think I'm the only one in the world who likes mincemeat (with or without the meat). He answered: \"Yes, mincemeat, but there's no meat in it.\" \n\nFive minutes later, we exited, me clutching a white box containing a mincemeat without the meat pie, hard pressed not to tear the box open and devour the pie right there on the street, with my hands. I managed to wait until after dinner on Thanksgiving day, and then while everyone else was having pumpkin (boooring) I topped my slightly warm slice of mince pie with a giant scoop Bi-rite's salted caramel ice cream and dug in. Readers, it was perfect. The crust was light and flaky. The filling was thick and sweetly sour, heavy with spice. The best mince pie I've had in a long time. I'm guessing the rest of their pies are good, too. But for now, I'm sticking to mince.\n\nNOTE: It occurs to me that I should explain what mincemeat is, since many people hear the meat part of the word and they don't want to hear any more. Once upon a time mincemeat was a combination of apples, dried or candied fruit and spices, and finely chopped beef. Now days almost no one puts meat in the filling, even if they still call it mincemeat. In old timey days, the minced (finely chopped) ingredients  were then marinated in brandy for weeks and weeks before being baked into a pie. I doubt if there was alcohol in Destination Bakery's mincemeat pie, but it was full of minced apples, raisins, currants and spices. Think of mincemeat (minus the meat) as a heavily spiced apple and dried fruit pie. There--doesn't that sound delicious?", "author": "Lilla F."}

DBC is number one in the city and I have tried many- including Tartines which is very good but doesn't have the flavor and texture of something that was made with love, not like DBC. They also make some absolutely fabulous pies, perfect crusts, smell to die for, taste like heaven. Coffee, quite good. Its more than that though, the owner is a man who loves what he is doing, and is the friendliest guy. He always make time to chat. Its human and warm, inviting, sunny and sleepy, like Glen Park! I love DBC, not only for the quality of its goods, but the quality of its people.", "author": "Lisa B."}
