It's probably my favorite post or pre giants game spot in San Francisco.\n\nThe bar is massive, well stocked, and well staffed. So you always get a drink you like, for the most part you can always find a seat, and the wait is little to none.\n\nThe food is amazing. It's cooked perfectly with high quality fresh ingredients and tastes amazing. It's also priced fairly even though it's right next to AT&T park. \n\nOverall, I love this place and have been here many times and will continue to come here in the future.", "author": "Sean S."}

We were going to a SF Giants game and stubbled across Pedros Cantina Restaurant. We decided to venture in a see what food and drinks they had. \nIt was crowded inside, but it was before the start of the game after a\u013al. \nWe looked over the menu and 'Nachos' sounded so good! So we ordered the Pedros Nacho Plate with choice of meats. We ordered the Al pastor meat choice with drinks of course.\n\nThe Nachos arrived, it looked really good.  \n\nOnce we dove in to the food it didn't taste as good as it looked. What I thought was cheese, was actually a bland/mild (guessin) chipotle sauce. There was very very minimal amount of real cheese but smothered with the sauce. That's all I tasted! Sauce! The Al Pastor was very delicious to their benefit. The guacamole and sour cream amount was gracious I admit.\nDrinks were rather small in its glass...at $12 per...not worth coming back.\n\nI should've looked up their star rating's before coming here...live and learn.", "author": "Frank W."}

We were in town for a game last night and popped in for dinner.  There was literally no one in the restaurant.  We got a table on our own, as the two guys who worked there were very busy in their own conversation.  We waited a bit and no waitress came.  The two guys told us we would be better off just ordering at the bar, which we did.  Food finally came and it was average at best.  After we left, my husband realized he had left his prescription glasses on the table.  It had not even been 20 minutes and we were back at Pedro's.  He had to work his way through 3 people who all told him they couldn't help him, before he spotted our original bartender who finally was able to get his glasses for him.

Think $12-13 for tacos, quesadillas, or burritos that are going to be rather pedestrian. Ed U., in particular, rightly notes that the juxtaposition of a place like this against a quality, down-home, authentic, super-cheap venue in the Mission not far away will be particularly jarring. Indeed, the quesadilla I had didn't even rise to the level of one that I could get for $5.50 at St. John's, a divey pub in Santa Clara that I used to frequent.\n\nGiven the setting, the drinks are going to be the best bets here, although once again they're quite pricey outside of happy hour. The margaritas, for example, weren't bad, but they were rather tiny given the price.\n\nAll in all, this isn't an exceptionally bad place, but there's just so much better here in the West Bay - that is, if going somewhere truly ethnic and authentic isn't beneath you.", "author": "Vincent L."}

It was absolute chaos downstairs but luckily my buddy had been sitting upstairs since 1pm and had a great seat. It was also much less crazy upstairs. Its fun sitting at the bar and watching everything from upstairs. Music is pretty loud and there were a few people dancing here and there. \n\nTried a bunch of different drinks. All of them served in small plastic cups. \n\nRum & Diet Coke - tasted like pure rum and no coke \nMichelada - I had been wanting to try one for ages. My friend told me it was like a shrimp cocktail minus the shrimp and beer instead. It was not bad but there was no ice at all in the drink and it was warm by the time I was only half way done with it. Also tons of huge pepper pieces towards the end of the drink \nMargarita - there is NO blender upstairs so they just made me one without crushed ice. Apparently someone straight up stole my drink right after they made it so the bartender made another with extra tequila \n\nPrices are super standard. Yelp check in is not valid on game days so no $5 sangria for me. \n\nI'm not sure what people are expecting from a bar across the street from the ball park. Of course its going to be expensive. Of course the food will be subpar. Of course the service isn't going to be great. Places like this will always have business purely on their location. Its like when you have to shell out $7 for a bottle of water at a music festival. Options are limited. Just take it for what its worth.", "author": "Tiffany V."}

Every staff member that I saw during this reception was decently friendly but seemed kinda miserable. Even the bartender kept ignoring me when the bar was not even busy. Anyways that's me being nitpicky. I had a great time with the people that were at the event, despite how terrible the food was. I would not come here on my own, though.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

Why? Because we had great seats and view of the game the entire time. If you are worried that there will be conflicting games, Pedro's has multiple channels on at once. For instance, this Sunday they had the World Cup on the projectors and most of the TVs, but also had ESPN and the Giants game playing on the corner TVs. \n\nNow on food--I didn't even attempt to try the salsa due to previous reviews. Even though the menu read 'home made' chips, the salsa still looked like it came out of a chunky tomato can. The breakfast menu was actually really good, but they can improve on their portions. Irish coffee was largely sized and good, but I'd skip on the margarita. The sangria, which is $7, was decently proportioned and delicious. The burrito bowl... never again! It looked like it had ingredients straight out of Taco Bell. The meat tasted like it pre-washed in water and no seasoning was added to it. Quite dry. Definitely do not go to Pedro's if you are trying to have authentic Mexican Food.\n\nOur server was also really attentive contrary to other reviews.

But they can do it, so they do, can't blame them for that.  \n\nPedro's itself is a good sports bar.  It is pretty big and plenty of TV's.  Not a wide selection on tap, but the populars are there.  Full bar as well.

Meanwhile, the bartender was still chatting it up with the group of guys. The chilled-glass employee came back and again, ignored me. So I asked her for a menu. She said she would get me one, but instead went to the chatty bartender and told her I was sitting there. By this time 10 minutes had passed. The bartender came by and asked me what I wanted. I ordered a glass of wine and nachos (classy). So I get my wine and then the runner brings me my nachos. I ask him for utensils.

The only thing I expected were inordinately high prices, surly waitstaff and barely passable gringo-mex cuisine.  \n\nHaving such low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised by the level of professionalism our server had:  not only was she cute in the extreme (always halfway to excellent in my book) but for long periods of time she was taking orders, bussing tables and running food solo for the entire bar area.  I could see her really start to struggle as patrons began to keep on filling in and as their alcohol consumption began to increase, but she handled it like a champ.  \n\nThe food and requisite high prices were as expected, so I really couldn't complain there...  although one of my dining partners who hails from ATL by way of the Midwest asked our server, \"That's all we get??\" when the $13 Lilliputian plate of chips, cheese and some sort of bean dip that masqueraded as nachos came to our table.  Eh...  Again, I suppose that's the price you pay for the convenience of being so close to AT&T Park, home of the hated SF Giants.  *please Giants fans, don't stomp me*\n\nTLDR Summary:  Bring low expectations regarding the food and the (high) prices but be content in the fact that you're going to be waited on by some really attractive servers, conveniently next to the ballpark.", "author": "John S."}

My rule of thumb, early bird gets the worm! \n\n-If there is no seating down stairs there's a nice little upstairs with a bar and flat screens. The seats at the very edge of the balcony are nice if you don't like people standing in front of you. Only draw back is it gets hot up there and the sound system is controlled from speakers down stairs, so its a little bit of echoing.\n\n-You do get a mix of the good, the bad and the ugly, but as a whole there's a good mix of people that come here.\n\n  All and all, I think Pedro's is a good location b/c of its size and easy access to public transportation for people seeking a place to watch a sports game.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-10", "description": "I'm going to leave just a bit of room for improvement; although honestly, very little improvement is needed.  Because I had to go back to work on the afternoon of my visit I didn't try any alcohol from the bar.  I'll consider giving these guys that coveted fifth star after I get a chance to down a few margaritas and sit down to some ice cold brews.\n\nI had one very small complaint after my first visit and it was that the food menu was a bit limited.  It's no big deal  because everything I tried was super fresh and super delicious.  Take into consideration that this place just opened and the service was downright impeccable.  Greeted immediately as soon as I made eye contact I was asked whether I wanted to sit at the bar or at a table.  I chose the table because staring at bottles of liquor wasn't going to cut it for me especially when I couldn't have any.\n\nMy waiter took my beverage order and returned quickly with my beverage.  Since I had no menu-related questions for him he gave me a bit of time to continue to read the menu.  As soon as I took my eyes off the menu and onto one of the many overhead televisions my waiter was back asking me whether I was ready to order.  I ordered an appetizer and a main entr\u00e9e then proceeded to check out the gigantic space and the beautiful interior (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vs0y-ryWnBGcbmpLZO2Zdg?select=GT3gHEkZ3Lb7I9DrNZfYOA).  There were other diners present so out of respect for their privacy that was my only interior photo.\n\nMy food arrived lightning fast.  Well, maybe not quite like lightning, but it was fast beginning with my Chicken Tostaditas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vs0y-ryWnBGcbmpLZO2Zdg?select=wLJZXcf1MBXxkVOvmoMNfQ).  These were deep-fried tortilla shells filled with chicken chili verde, fresh lettuce, pico de gallo, two types of grated cheese and a cool, creamy sauce.  Of the three tortilla shells two were regular flour tortillas and one was a spinach tortilla adding a bit of color to the trio.  The chicken was moist and flavorful and the tortilla shells held up beautifully while holding up some rather wet ingredients.  Since there was very little spice to these I tried both the red salsa and the tomatillo salsa which were available in squeeze bottles on each table.  As it was neither salsa had much heat to it, but I enjoyed the tostaditas anyway.\n\nFrom the menu description and the $12 price tag I was expecting a huge plate of food for my main entr\u00e9e.  I ordered a Pedro's Plate with carnitas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vs0y-ryWnBGcbmpLZO2Zdg?select=GJwFQK7pNBB9Q_vWKdf8_A), and it did not disappoint.  The plate comes with a choice of meat, rice, whole black beans (my favorite!), pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream and a set of steaming hot corn tortillas wrapped in foil.  What I wasn't expecting was the side salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vs0y-ryWnBGcbmpLZO2Zdg?select=ZQPPM1pHM4Ugww0DkPwt9w) that came with the plate.  The salad was super fresh with chilled shredded lettuce, sliced cherry tomatoes, sliced radishes and seedless strips of jalapeno all topped with a mild red salsa.  A lime wedge accompanied the salad.  I squashed that lime flat and enjoyed that fresh, crunchy salad before digging into the carnitas plate.\n\nThe carnitas were excellent and the amount of meat on that platter was very generous.  There was a very good mix of lean pieces and marbled pieces of pork.  As expected the most lean pieces were kind of dry, but the pork had excellent flavor.  All of the remaining components of the platter were delicious.\n\nConsidering I still attend close to 30 San Francisco Giants home games every season I can see myself finding my way back to Pedro's Cantina often for a pre-game drink and delicious food.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

This past weekend Joey and I decided to hit up Pedro's Cantina (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gnBkWwpd5anIlw5Q8TLFww/l.jpg) in San Francisco, right across from AT&T Park. This time around we were accompanied with three other buddies to watch all the NFL games. I've actually been meaning to check out Pedro's Cantina since last year when my friend Chris mentioned it as a good bar to watch games.\n \nThe Scene: \nVery spacious with a circular bar in the middle of the cantina with 22 flat panel TVs all around the walls to view all the games. There is also an upstairs area that overlooks the main floor as well. The crowd was pretty chill, but I can see it getting crazy packed during the baseball season (go Giants!).\n\nDespite having 22 TVs, not all the TVs have their own cable box. In fact, some of the TVs are connected together with the main TV. So if the main TV has a particular game on, some of the other TVs will show the same game as well, even if no one is watching that particular TV. I tried to request one TV to be changed to a different game not being shown at the bar, but was denied as it was connected to the main TV despite no one even watching that TV. /sad face\n \nFood:\nYou can't expect too much food-wise since this place is a sports bar that also serves Mexican food, and not vice versa. However, after reading some of the reviews here, I thought just maybe the food here could be really good. I ordered 5 street style tacos, a mixture of Carne Asada and Chicken Chile Verde (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6Vc8yy44r1kblqiT9RxlYg/l.jpg). They were average at best, not bad or extraordinary. It was a bit bland even despite how hungry I was that morning.\n  \nService: \nThe service here is a little on the slow side.

Tickets to SF v LA were a little out of my price range, so Pedro's Cantina seemed like the perfect idea.  The cantina wasn't especially busy, especially on the given Saturday night with the home game across the street.  After being carded by security, we sat ourselves and waited for our waiter...and waited...and waited.  I eventually had to get up and signal a waiter over.\n\nThe server hurried over and gave us menus and went over the drink specials.  I used a Yelp Check-In deal, but unfortunately, he had no idea what he was staring at on my iPhone.  I don't even think he had an idea of what Yelp is.  Nevertheless, I was given my check-in drink offer. The menu has Mexican staples, such as chips & salsa, guacamole, ceviche, tacos, quesadillas, etc.  I decided to order the Street-Style Taco Plate, which consisted of three tacos, with your choice of meat, beans, rice, guacamole, salsa, and sour cream.\n\nThe food came out and was purely..mediocre.  The carne asada wasn't especially delicious and did not justify the $14 price tag.  The beans and rice were bland and lacked flavor.  Overall, the pricey plate was was nothing short of disappointing.  I'd recommend ordering the three taco deal for $8 and skipping the plate.  The house sangria was equally disappointing and was overly sweet and resembled sweet and sour mix.\n\nAs if the service, food, and prices weren't bad enough, this is where it gets worse.  My check is a surprising $30; however, it's not my check.  After tracking down the waiter, who was chatting it up with some ladies at the bar, he went to go void the ticket. After five minutes or so, he brought over the right check, the more expensive check.  Fast forward a few days and I'm online checking my debit transactions and Pedro's Cantina charged me three different transactions!  The whole ordeal took over seven days to clear and resulted in them \"holding\" my funds for those seven days.  If you go to Pedro's, skip the food, get the drink specials, and pay in cash.\n\nAmbiance: 5 Stars (out of 5)\nFood: 2 Stars (out of 5)\nService: 1 Stars (out of 5)\nPrice:  $$$ (out of 4)\nOverall: 1 Stars (out of 5)", "author": "Alexander E."}

They were packed, as expected but they had a really good handle on the crowd control and organization.\n\n\nNow make no mistake this is bar food. Mexican style, but bar food. If you  are expecting Cantina quality Mexican food you will be disappointed. But if you are looking for a fun, reasonably priced place to hang out before, during, or after a Giants game then you'll be happy.\n\nThe cans of Tecate were $5 a piece which isn't bad considering inside the park 12 oz of beer is $9:75. I had a pomegranate margarita for $8. The first one was great. I couldn't even take more than two sips of the second, it was too sweet but I'm sure if I cared enough to bring it back to the bar they'd remake it.\n\nDuring large events they have porta-potties in the back, which originally grossed me out but they were very, very clean and they had separate men and women's along with a giant dude standing there making sure the drunk men didn't wander into the ladies and pee all over. \n\nFun place and as sad as it is, while the food wasn't amazing.

Yes, this place easily reaches capacity for high-profile game days (like the World Series).  No, that does not mean they *have* to change their business policy and start treating their customers like cattle, herding them and milking their money-teats.\n\nMaking your customers wait in line for up to an hour and stripping them of their money, just to have them enter and find that the place practically empty is 100% standard douchey-club-type bullshit.  Do you want to attract the types of people that have no self-respect?  Because this is how you get the types of people that have no self-respect (and they have no respect for anyone else, nor your establishment, either...  just think about where this is going).\n\nIt all boils down to the old saying: just because you can doesn't mean you should.

Came here today after attending Fleet Week with my family. We were a large group  of 8 and 1 person in our party wanted to watch the Kansas City game. We wanted to move to a corner table and push two tables together, one server already told us it was ok, but then the server that was serving our table told us it wasn't going to work and then went on about fire hazards. This server was super unfriendly and I wish I had gotten her name. I asked her what other options she had and she couldn't really help. I asked to speak to her manager and the manager was also as useful as a door knob. We were also told we could sit in the back area where there was more room, but when we went to sit they told us it was not open yet. Whoever is running this godforsaken place needs to get their shit together and maybe have a staff meeting so they can all get on the same page. 3 people from our party got fed up and ended up leaving while 4 of us stayed for the service to get worse if that was even possible. \n\nThe 4 of us decided to stay because 2 of us had already been having drinks. We ordered a round of drinks. I wanted water, and since our server was as helpful as a doorknob I decided to go to the bar and grab a water. I was standing at the bar, while I heard a stout looking server ask with an attitude if she could help me with something. I said I'm just asking for a water. She said she could get it and I said no thanks since you didn't offer I was going to grab it myself. She then went on to school me about how California is in a drought. I thought to myself, \"oh honey, that is probably the most useful information you have going on in that head of yours.\" I just thought she was out of line and extremely inappropriate. \n\nThe manager never once seemed to care or apologize to our party. He simply said we needed to get along. The food is not super great, so don't expect much. I'm sure our food came with a side of spit, courtesy of our most gracious knowledgeable server.\n\nBy all means, if you decide on making a bad decision by coming here then I would stick to drinks. It is a great place to watch sports, but don't even think about moving tables together. There may be a fire hazard, in which case we may not make it out alive.

Ten minutes go by and no menu, so we decided to grab a couple because we were sitting next to one of the computers that the waiters put the orers in.  For some reason I thought the menus would draw a waiters attention, but clearly I was wrong because we sat there for another ten minutes.\n\nFinally, we were acknowledged by a waiter who took our drink order, dropped it off, and said he would be right back.  Ten minutes later we are still waiting for him to take our food order and consider leaving.

I was excited about this place after reading about it on Thrillist and Urban Daddy but it didn't deliver.  Here's why:\n\n1. Chips and salsa are not free.  Huh?  Isn't that standard at a mexican place?  Even chain places like Chevy's have bottomless chips and salsa and this place charges $3 and serves the salsa in a cheap paper cup.  For an extra $3 you can get one small scoop of guac and half the salsa (since they split the space of the paper cup). Really?  Photo of this posted.\n\n2. Their margaritas are served in tiny plastic cups with mostly ice.  What is this a club in Cancun?  Pedro, the ballpark is across the street and this is a restaurant.  Use glass.\n\n3. There's no silverware, only a bucket of tiny plastic forks.  Our table actually had only knives.  Nice.\n\n4. The burrito cost $8 and came wrapped in foil.  It was the size of a burrito at taco bell and there were no beans or rice on the side. I uploaded a picture so you can see how small it was.\n\n5. The grande tacos cost $13 and they were served in a paper dish with no sides.\n\n6. The music was horrible for a sports bar.  Songs alternated between spanish music and bubblegum girl pop.  \n\n7. The hostess sat us at a table in the back corner that was not wiped down from the previous group.\n\nIt's too bad because the space is good and I really need a good place for football this season.", "author": "Kris N."}

We got a seat and I peeped the menu.\n\nThe menu is very much a taqueria menu. Street tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, tamales, etc. Prices were decent, considering the rent they must be paying. 3 tacos for $9, burritos for $8. Cocktails, not so much... About $8 for a mixed drink. That's where Sneaky Pete makes his scrilla.\n\nConsidering the crowd, our waiter did a decent job of turning the order over quickly. I ordered the Nachos with Chorizo, my lovely wife got the Carnitas Street Tacos. The nachos were actually perfect, the chorizo was delicious. I snagged a bite of the street tacos, and the carnitas were ultra-juicy and tasty. My wife got the sangria, and it was one of the best I've ever tried. \n\nThe presentation of food was relaxed.

It took so long that some of us had to leave before our food was served. Due to the slow service, I am more hesitant to hold work gatherings at Pedro's.", "author": "Peter C."}

Me and a few friends were looking for a late night bite and drinks; a local recommended Pedro's. \n\nPedro's was pretty fun! Good sized bar with plenty of options. There are plasma TVs around to catch up on some football (a must factor when out for some evening drinks;). \n\nHowever, I wasn't to enthused about the food. Well, I ordered carne asada tacos with rice and beans. The tacos were ok.. I just loaded them up with sour cream and guacamole which made them go from ok to good! The rice was dry and the beans were bland. So, basically I should have just ordered tacos with no sides. \n\nAll in all this place is pretty cool to hang out for drinks and football. Seems like a good place for large groups as well.", "author": "Cherise G."}

His latest venture is an almost exact copy of of the successful Pete's, only with a Mexican theme.  Pedro's (Wow, what an imaginative name.  It must have taken them two whole seconds to come up with that.) has copious drinks, passable food, soaring ceilings, and a plethora of big screens so you'll never miss a play.\n\nThe real question is \"With Maya on Second Street, Iron Cactus on Third Street, Mijita in the ballpark, Mexico au Park in South Park, and Tres Agaves just down the street on King, does South Beach need yet another Mexican joint?\"\n\nIn the cavernous, but well lit, space now known as Pedro's Catina lies the answer.  The menu offers nothing that can't be found in any other generic Mexican restaurant north of the border or here in the neighborhood: chips and salsa, tostadas, tacos, and burritos pretty much round out the selections. \n\nWhile not innovative, Pedro's Mexican food is at least good. The pollo chile rojo has a nice kick. The pork carnitas have the requisite smoky flavor. The marinated, grilled prawns are juicy and delicious. However, like most Mexican establishments targeted at gringos, the spiciness of Pedro's dishes has been tamed, but is nothing you can't remedy with a shot or two of Tabasco. \n\nThere are at least 10 beers on tap and a variety of spirits to wet your whistle.  Pedro's margarita with jalepeno-infused lime juice for an extra kick was a pleasant surprise.\n\nPrices are a bit steep--$8 for a burrito and $12 for grande tacos--and charging $3 for chips and salsa is insulting.\n\nAn interesting, if off-putting, twist is that all plates, flatware, and barware is biodegradable.  Yes, this sounds green, but in reality is a bit of a pain.  Eating with Taterware from a paper plate should be reserved for a picnic, not a sit-down establishment where one pays more than $10 for an entr\u00e9e.\n\nIn the end, the answer to the question of whether South Beach needs yet another Mexican restaurant is \"Maybe.\"  If not innovative, Pedro's fills a niche for the ballpark crowd.  We'll see how well it does in the off season.", "author": "CJ G."}

The ticket said $5 drink specialS and $5 food specialS. Basically, false advertisement.\n\nSecondly, I was not able to find mustaches or sombreros. HELLO this is a cinco de mayo party, where are they? I searched the whole place and finally came across someone who had a fake mustache. He graciously took me upstairs to a woman who had to search through a box of condoms and god knows what else to give me 3 crappy mustaches. I was somewhat happy to find them, but was not pleased that I had to run around like a chicken with its head cutoff to find these mustaches that should have been given to me in the first place.\n\nIn addition, the service was not only slow, but terrible. I understand that it was somewhat busy...but cmon have your restaurant equipped for this event. Anyway, my friends got their food 25 minutes before I got mine...and I even had to remind the waitress that I still haven't gotten my food. I saw my food coming, but to my dismay this waitress goes to other tables trying to give them MY food! Finally, my friend had to run after the waitress to get my quesadilla. I was happy to get my quesadilla, but was not impressed with the taste...\n\nAnd lastly I went looking for my promised sombrero. I finally found one with condoms on it..nevertheless, I reached my hand for the sombrero.

Not the front door men- but the door man in the Alley where the port-a-potties were located. \n\nSo i go out in the back alley with a friend to use the port-a-potty. I see an exit door, and I thought I'd go check it out. I opened it really quickly....and decided to shut it as I realized it wasn't supposed to be an actual \"exit\". So i'm walking back to use the restroom......Then this big latin man (working for pedros) asked me to go for a \"walk with him\"- but while doing so- aggressively pushed my shoulder in that direction!!\n\nI said \"I will go for a walk with you, but don't touch me\" in a polite but direct manner. He again, pushes my shoulder in that direction. I said \"Seriously man, you can't touch me or anyone else\" So then he stopped and aggressively told me to stay away from that door as he thought I was letting my friends in. Maybe his thought process was just, but I shut the door so quickly realizing that was not a true exit. I told him i'd stay away from the door, and we went our seperate ways. He was very rude, direct, vulgar, and un-polished. I will give him some credit though because he had to deal with A LOT of drunk/stoned riff-raff patrons. However he shoulda realized i was not one of those patrons just by talking to me. \n\nThen here's the kicker. My friend decides to go use the restroom an hour later... waits in line to use the portapotty. A couple guys were smoking weed while in line for the restroom. My friend asked the guys if he could take a rip of marijuana. They let my friend. Almost immediately the same big latin bouncer comes over to my friend asking just him to leave the bar for smoking weed  OR  give him 100 dollars and he will forget about it. My friend, being a type B, gave him all the money he had $25 to get away from the doorman. \n\n\nWow is all i can say. But hey Pedro's- i'll still come back.

Tons of TVs, and there's some room to stand around which is nice if you don't feel like being that awkward person that goes and asks every group with empty glasses on their table if they're leaving soon. \n\nIt's self-seating so grab a table (if you can find one) or head straight to the bar. I prefer the latter; it's a bigger bar area than most of the other places around the park and there is almost always a single seat somewhere. If you want to avoid a crowded bus immediately after the game, you can kill a lot of time by talking to random Giants fans near you. I've heard some really great stories...and some really weird ones. \n\nOn game days I've seen another drink station near the entry to Pete's. It rarely looked busy so if you just want a beer or Jack and coke, you can get one there pretty quickly. \n\nMost of the bartenders are really friendly. It's a great environment to hang out, start up a sports conversation with someone new and enjoy baseball season to the fullest. Then stumble right across the street to MUNI and get yourself home.", "author": "Ally W."}

There is also a loft space when you go upstairs with a separate smaller bar. \n\nI've had the nachos and the Al Pastor tacos. The nachos were boring but the tacos were tasty.\n\nMostly I've tried their drinks. They have a very unique Jalapeno Margarita.

It was extremely hard to find seating by yourself though (do you snag a table? awkwardly hover over patrons who look nearly done?), so we ended up standing around these two chairs and constantly prowling the atmosphere.\n\nDrink were EASILY accessible. Just approach man behind numerous bars, ask for a drink, and at the mini bars he fills it up with a cup that has a magnet attached on the bottom. Practically no line. Just be careful, don't push that magnet, liquids will come pouring out like a stream.\n\nIt took us a while to wave a server down, but when we did he was super helpful and helped us move tables to accommodate our large group. The food came out rather slow though, they forgot my chips and salsa (why do we have to pay for salsa!!), still charged me for it, but were nice about removing it. Actual food was okay for Nor Cal Mexican food (sorry, So Cal Elitist Snob here), but I was kind of bleh about the chips too (not crispy enough.)\n\nOverall it's a nice place (great atmosphere) to come before the grandiose price of baseball stadium food, but you have to expect it to be busy, and thus service does take a slight hit.", "author": "Adele Z."}

Even in NYC you'd get a pint of *something* for that. That's after a $10 cover (they gave a $10 food voucher to use any other visit, but would I want to go back?), and since I didn't have cash there was also the $4 fee at their mini ATM.

Definitely no tables unless you came earlier, but you could move around, so that's cool. They had some drink specials, I took advantage of $5 shots of 1800. Sizes of shots were pretty generous. The bartenders were pretty cool, didn't do a lot of chatting but they weren't rude and didn't take long to fulfill orders etc...\n\nOn the other hand... our waitress was not-so-cool. She literally looked like she wanted to kill herself. I wish I had gotten her name, because it was really bad how rude she was being. I arrived later than the rest of my party and therefore was completely sober upon arriving. My party was roughly 15-20 people deep. I understand that she was surely dealing with tons of drunk jerks all day due to the holiday and the game, but seriously, this is the job you signed up for. If you don't like drunk people, don't work as a waitress at a cantina. Because I was completely sober and only ordering my first drink, I could easily recognize the animosity in her gaze when my BFF was trying to order. My BFF asked what she would recommend for us to drink (inquiring about specials etc), the waitress said (word for word), \"Well it's not what I want, it's what you want, so what do you want?\"... uhm okay?? She would come by from time to time to ask if anyone needed to order anything, but God forbid someone actually did. \"Can I order some tacos?\" would get a response as if you were asking her for a kidney. Another completely sober member of my party commented how she looked like she desperately needed to take her break.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this place solely based on her attitude. The rest of the place wasn't bad, but with so many other places offering the same atmosphere/drinks/whatever nearby, there is no point in wasting your time dealing with someone who behaves as such. It's a shame that a waitress with a bad attitude can cause you to lose business in the future!", "author": "Shelby P."}

This place is preeetty spacious. I came early (around 10ish/doors opened at 10:30 AM), so I was one of the first  to get first pick on tables/seats for my group of 7. We chose the L shaped table between the entrance/bar/and stairs. Great call on my part because it was the best table in the house in my opinion. Close to the bathrooms, in view of the large projector screen, screen at the table, screens at the bar, close the bar. Just a great table.\n\nThe food wasn't all that great, but I was there for football and beers so I'm not going to complain about the food. If  you do want food though, the chicks ordered wings from next door and they were able to deliver them to our table. Wings were pretty dece. Despite the place being suuuper packed, the waitress was able to get our beer buckets and bloody marys in pretty quickly. Props. She was also really nice. How she was able to keep her composure all day with the per capita of douchebags in there? I have no idea.\n\nI also like how they had a smoking area in the back with canopies (to protect everyone from the stupid rain) and a bunch of porta-potties and makeshift sinks. At first glance, I thought, \"Eww... why would I want to go in there when they have real bathrooms inside? I'm not a dog.\" Then I realized why an hour later when it was shoulder-to-shoulder packed with douchebags inside and a fat line for the dudes' room. So yeah, I ended up pissing in the porta-potties like a dog the rest of the day.\n\nAll in all, I had a great time at this bar. Our tab came out to be $750 with a $150 tip.

Exposed brick, flat screens everywhere you look, tons of places to sit, including a huge balcony.\n-Our server, Stephanie, was very sweet and smoking hot. And let's face it, that can go a long way when attracting your neanderthal sports fan (eg. Phil H.)\n-Food, for the most part, was pretty decent. Definitely a good option for a pre-game bite....we really enjoyed the nachos grande with chorizo.\n-Food prices seem to be in line with typical, pre-game dining options: think $10 for a big plate of nachos, $3 for 'street tacos', etc.\n-Location! Location! Location! Right across the street from the ballpark, you really can't get any closer than Pedro's.\n\nThings I hated about Pedro's:\n\n-Serving food on paper plates, with plastic utensils, and drinks in plastic cups. C'mon, we are paying restaurant prices, treat us like adults and give us really plates and glasses.\n-My 'Cadilliac Margarita\" was WAY too sweet. And at $10, just not worth it.\n-$18 for a pitcher of Bud Light. Wow.\n-No happy hour on game days - we're sneaking out of work early to start drinking before the game, would it kill you to knock a buck off before say 6pm?\n\nThe good out weighs the bad so three solid stars. With such a large space if you get there on the early side you should have no problem grabbing seats either at the bar or at one of the many tables available. But based on our one pre-game experience I think Pedro's definitely needs to step things up if they want to attract crowds when the Giants aren't playing across the street.", "author": "phil h."}

I figure if I'm going to order a small taco for a crazy price, I should be getting my money's worth. I didn't. The waiter ended up messing up my order too, so I think in the end I paid way more than I should have. \n\nI thought Mijita was bad, but I guess now they have competition. I would go back here for the beer, pretty much. Also I heard it's connected to Pete's Tavern as well, so I think I'll just stick to drinking instead of eating bad tacos.", "author": "Caroline L."}

While I enjoy Pedro's as a place to watch games and to grab some drinks, the food here has never been particularly good. They advertise themselves as a Mexican restaurant, but the tacos and burritos have always been just ok, and bit on the pricey side. Today, I went in and decided to try a salad -- which may have been my mistake -- but it was quite disappointing. I had the Fiesta Salad, which was listed as being composed of little gem lettuces, red peppers, grilled corn, jicama, and other ingredients. When it came to the table, I was quite disappointed when I saw that it was watery romaine lettuce and there was no corn at all in the salad. I didn't send it back because it was so busy, and it just wasn't that good anyway -- adding some corn or replacing the lettuce wasn't going to help. I also think the chips are on the greasy side and the salsa they give with the chips is completely lacking in spice.

We found seats and ordered our drinks and apps.  After I ordered my drink, the waitress informed me that it's not really good, very heavy on a certain ingredient.  If an actual employee of the establishment is telling me something is bad, I should have listened and it also reflects poorly. The salsa was like pace picante still it was edible so we ate it.  We ordered taquitos and I had to pull out the chicken that was too pink.raw.  The chorizo was anything but chorizo, so I had to stop eating.  It was plain gross.  My drink, just like the waitress had warned was terrible.  I tried drinking it but I couldn't, I left it about 95% full.  The waitress passed by and saw it so she asked if I needed anything so I asked for salt.  Our table didn't have any, the waitress never came back for my salt so I left the drink almost untouched.  \n\n I expect good/decent service especially from a place like Pedro's in such a high profile location.

The service is kind and attentive. Unfortunately, it is also very overpriced and stingy about its portions and ingredients. The food, served on paper plates, would have been fine had it been half the price or double the amount. But six dollars for chips and a small amount of guac, and ten dollars for a tostada salad bowl with not much of the good stuff makes me not want to come back again. For these prices, there are a few things that could be changed:\n\n1) Paper plates, plastic forks, and plastic cups? REALLY??\n2) Chips and salsa should be free or very cheap when sitting down for a meal of this price. I know plenty of Mexican places that are half the price and they still provide free chips and salsa.\n3) When one actually purchases the chips and salsa/guac (mistake), the ratio is WAY off because of their stinginess with the guacamole.\n4) They put 3 small slices of avacado in their tostada bowls. THREE.\n\nI give them two instead of one star because they're still newish. But I'm not going back.", "author": "Justin M."}

I was with a big group of about 10, and 5 of my friends were already seated for about 20 minutes and still hadn't gotten helped.  We all sat together and we continued to wait for the waitress and nothing, finally a friend in the group decided to get the chips and salsa himself which was visible to the guests.  About 10 minutes later the waitress finally decided to arrive with more chips and I'm sure she noticed we had already helped ourselves since we hadn't seen or heard from her.  Still no order for drinks or water, so we had to walk up to the bar ourselves to ask for water, the bartender said sure and asked for a credit card to open a tab (I didn't even know you needed a tab for a pitcher of water but Ok).  I then decided to explain to the bartender we aren't getting helped over here where is our waitress we want to order food and drinks.  His tone of voice was so rude I couldn't believe it but told us we had to wait for the waitress to come back and we shouldn't be helping ourselves to the chips and salsa and to remain seated, and he can help us with our drinks.  \n\nWhen I turned around one of my friends was already complaining to the general manager of the location who was also extremely rude and unprofessional.  I myself work in the hospitality industry and I was completely shocked to see how he acted with my group.  As a manager he should have tried to save the tables and immediately should of asked two waitresses to assist with the tables and get the orders in.  This place needs some serious training with all there staff including the manager!!!!!!\n\nI WILL NOT! be recommending nor visiting this restaurant again when visiting AT&T park.

Checked out several but picked this Mexican as it looked nice inside.  My bf and I sat at one of the tables near the bar area and several TV's.  Our waitress came soon enough to take our orders - chips/salsa, bloody mary, tacos, burrito and a coke.  She brings the bloody mary in a timely manner and I asked for some iced water.  We waited a few minutes for the chips and salsa to come next.  We see that on the counter it says \"please ask your server for chips and salsa.\"  We waited and waited.  A couple next to us was also waiting impatiently.  I saw the man walk over to the chips counter.  I pointed to my bf the chips so he went over too but didn't wait for the server to come around from wherever she was.  He started taking some.  The waitress sees him and pointed to the sign.  My bf walks back to our table with chips but no salsa.  The waitress serves the other couple chips and salsa but didn't come to our table to see if we needed anything like salsa.  She walks away pissed at my bf for serving himself.  When she was back at the counter, I approached her for some salsa.  That's when she goes off on me attacking me about my bf's action saying can't you see that I'm doing many tables or to that extent.  I said it isn't it normal to be served salsa and chips right away while we wait for food? She starts arguing with me then rudely put some salsa, which her long dangling hair had dipped in, and some guacamole on our table.  I told her I wanted to talk to the manager, who came to our table.  My bf said something to him and the manager replies back by saying he wasn't gonna fire her.  That was also an out of line response as all I wanted was to tell him how rude and out of line she was talking to me, a customer like that.  The manager listened and talked to the raccoon looking waitress with long hair.  If you get her, watch out.  Another waitress took over our table and was nice enough to check on us from time to time.  I shared with her what happened and she was apologetic.  Ok, after my bf apologized to the rude waitress, I told her she was out of line.  She apologized as well but had to add that I was rude to her too, which I was not as I only wanted salsa for goodness sake.  And even if a customer is rude to a waitress, she should have enough professionalism to bite her tongue and call the manager if needed.  Instead, I'm the one who called the manager and reported her rotten attitude.   Chips  were stale and not worth $3 except for the guacamole maybe.  Shrimp and carnitas tacos were ok.  My bf liked the wet burrito.  Good bloody mary.  Ok food overall but very likely, we'll never go back because of the unpleasant experience and combative waitress.

The tortillas could have been cooked thru a little bit more but still decent\n\nEvent most likely had an impact on the food, reason why it was probably coming out nice and hot, pretty cool they didn't screw it up, an order at the bar would take less that 10 minutes to pop out, hand delivered by staff too, kind of a suprise how they would find you, prices are steep for nachos and tacos\n\nOverall experience was nice, no issues with crowd, vibe was good, actually alot of eye candy too\n\nparking sucks in the area, valet for $25 right in the front of the lot on the side, fuck it, that's why you work\n\nI would come back for another big event, if it was smaller I probably would become a statistic of the food woes", "author": "R O."}

The terrible service at this establishment compelled me to sign up and post a review.  I went to this bar based on the recommendation of a friend to watch my hometown NFL football team on opening weekend.  As I was watching my team play, the restaurant switched the game to another matchup which was already showing on several other TVs.  So, now the 20 plus TVs were playing the same 4 games.  As I motioned to the waitress to ask why the channel was changed, she gave me the 'hand' and nodded her head with a look of contempt as she walked by without stopping.  I asked two other servers if I could talk to somebody about the programming.  They essentially ignored my request.  So, there I was sitting there waiting around for a manager that would never come.  Finally, I left after finishing my beer and missed the opening game of the season.\n\nI understand that these employees are busy and stressed, but a courteous explanation or an apology for not being able to accommodate everyone's wishes would have gone a long way.  In other bars I've been to, the manager will come over to the area where a game is playing and ask if anyone is watching the game on a particular TV before switching the channel.", "author": "Grant W."}

I especially appreciated that they were making people line up and wait (even though we had to line up and wait) so it didn't get too crowded.  Until they let too many people in and it got too crowded and then punks gave me attitude when I asked them to pretty please not stand directly in front of me (we had a table upstairs, and it was crowded, so people wanted to stand in the small aisle between our table and the railing seating).  The food was okay, the beer ridiculously priced (between Pete's & Pedro's they must've made a quarter of their income on that one night alone).  I can't really see myself trekking out here for anything other than Giants games though, so this makes sense.\nIf you're looking for THE SCENE to watch your Giants games with multitudes of other hyped up, beer drinking fans, this is your place.  If you want a mellower vibe with televisions you can see and better food, I'd recommend you find another location.  \nA word to the wise - do NOT jump around in the street after an epic win.

First bad clue was when our ice tea arrived in plastic.  Ok, we don't do unnecessary plastic in SF.  Did they think we would drop our drinks and shatter them?  Then the cold, stale \"homemade\" chips showed up in a cardboard box - taken, as my son pointed out  -from one of the many huge plastic bagsful spotted in the kitchen.   Fresh from Costco? You make the call.  The salsa was from a jar with maybe some flavor tossed in to disguise its Costco roots. \nThe kids wouldn't touch the disgusting dark meat chicken (I ate it the next day; woke up with its foul taste in my mouth). The quesadilla was rolled like a burrito and pan-fried. Huh?  The beef tacos were dry and the tortillas hard.  It did make for a great family memory as well as engaging conversation to compare the horrors of it all.   Maybe this place is great if you are drunk beyond repair on cheap tequila from a plastic cup?  I will never know.

I'm one of the biggest Giants fans I know, and I know that when the season starts up again, I will be heading back to the cantina and tavern....Don't plan on driving, parking down there is a nightmare and valet is a little pricey. Great place to throw a party or meet good looking Giants fans!!", "author": "Scott O."}

The location is great and the size of the restaurant is huge!!! It was such a treat be able to pick between so many seats.\n\nI got a regular margarita ($7) and it came is a plastic cup.  The drink was actually pretty good and not overly sweet.  I went with two other people and they tried other mixed drinks. Both were $10 and were very sweet.  I also had sangria, which was pretty decent too.  If you're coming for strong drinks you're probably better off just drinking wine and beer.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered a tostada salad.  The corn was roasted and very good.  My meal was pretty good, but it was served on a paper plate with plastic utensils.  All food was rather overpriced given the size, quality, and cheap utensils.  \n\nI would definitely come back for a drink or two before the game, but would only get beer, wine, sangria or a regular margarita (1 tops).", "author": "Valerie S."}

Drinks are over priced even for the area and the food is really bad. Not much else to say, it's pretty hard to make Mexican food this bad, and when I say bad I don't mean not authentic I mean it is bad.", "author": "David W."}

My first impression was, wow they spent alot of money on the interior, its huge but very corporate looking.\n\nI was seated for lunch and it all seemed very formal until I noticed plastic forks on the table! I ordered 2 super taco's, beef and prawn. The taco's arrived in a paper bowl and I was not given any utensils so I assume they intended for me to eat with plastic utensils!! Really they spent that much money and couldn't afford the silverware, In a city that prides itself on being green, major faux pas!!\n\nThe food was tasty but portion size was small and after seeing the taco's I ordered one to go, $20 later (including tip). It was an expensive lunch.\n\nService was good, there appeared to be more staff than customers so no surprise there on the first week.", "author": "s s."}

When we walked in, immediately, the hostess seemed annoyed that she had a customer - unfortunately the hostess was also our waitress.  She never smiled once... We ordered our margaritas and water...the maragrita came fairly quickly - she asked if we were ready to order and I asked for another minute.....had i known she would not come back for 10 because of her in depth conversation with a co-worker, I would have ordered then.....She took our order...I still had no water.  Our food came out fast ON PAPER PLATES and there were PLASTIC utensils.  Oh and by the way, my order was incorrect - I ordered CRISPY tacos, she brought me soft tacos.  If you are going to charge $15 for a plate of tacos then I would expect the serving pieces to be real plates NOT PAPER- these are not fast food prices.  We ordered another margarita and WATER again - which she brought 5 minutes later in PLASTIC cups, with no apology for forgetting the water the first time.  \n\nI would over look of of these errors if the restaraunt was busy - but they were not.  There were maybe 4 other tables with people at them ...and 3 servers.  I will never go back here for anything other than a beer before a Giants game.  If you want good mexican at pretty much the same price - go to Tres Agave ..it is worth the wait.", "author": "Heather S."}

It is not low end but not high end food and some of the best I have had.  The service is friendly; our server was always checking in with us and very attentive.  I love the Mexican soft rock and light pop playing.  The five canasta soft tacos are to die for with fresh corn tortillas, tender marinaded canasta, and salsa which is by far blows Chevy's out of the water.  The chips and salsa are some of the freshest I have ever had; crisp with a salsa that has enough spiciness to make itself known to you but not set you on fire as it is on the mild side.  My uncle loved his Pedro's burrito with grilled prawns.  Round it off with two Doseqes Ambers and you will not be disappointed.  So, for some upscale Mexican for a little more than what you would pay elsewhere with friendly service in a casual yet classy atmosphere, Pedro's cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}

(well bc work is right across the street and we like margaritas) so i was super excited when i came here before a giants game (regular season) they had $2 tecates. great because i only had $5 on me in cash and didnt feel like using my card that day. they have a ton of tvs and an upstairs area. for the post season i would watch my games upstairs...that was until game 5...well game 5...line was out the door and around the corner. (same thind held true for momo's petes. public house...and anything within a two block radius of the park) it is very lively there when the giants are playing which make this one my favorite bars to watch them. i havent had their food yet. maybe one day ill come check out their happy hour but till then get there early if you want to watch the giants.", "author": "Ashley H."}

I'm no punk or a bad tipper but I'm not going to tip a bouncer for standing in the vicinity of our table and continuously telling us to move.  That's all this guy did for an hour and a half was tell us to move.  I would never tip a bouncer in the first place unless he hooked me up with some kind of VIP service but to tip a bouncer just because he was in the building makes no sense to me.  First he came up to me and asked me three times for a tip.  I told him no and laughed thinking he was joking.  Then he went up to my friend and creepily whispered in his ear \"got a tip for your favorite bouncer\".  My friend said no and he continued to ask us and tried to pump his chest out like he was intimidating someone.  This is the Reason I keep it Oakland.  I've been in the bay my whole life, been to most every club in the city, and the City has nothing on Oakland from the people, to the service.", "author": "Ronnie D."}

Yep they charge for chips and the portions are small. However its the crap service that really makes this place a complete stink hole. A simple order for two was messed up 3 times by our waitress who kind of apologized for forgetting the rice and beans as she was walking away. The guy that owns this place (Pete) knows he has a guaranteed customer base during the games and basically hires Corkeys off the street to pretend to be servers. I've been a few times because it's close and every time the service has just been god awful. After this time, I am done. Hopefully Pedro's gets what's coming to it fairly soon and closes for good.", "author": "Seth G."}

The odds of getting a smart and properly trained server/bartender is what may keep the gambling addicts  amongst us showing up at these two places. Seriously...Pete...do you actually put any importance on training your staff? I know the staff at Momo's is only slightly better since they make more money there. But time and again my orders are wrong, the staff has no idea about what is on the webstie...prices are wrong on the site FYI...and half of the time at Pedros they will screw up your order. Don't believe me? Try it yourself...The guy who owns these places just cares about your money. Not about your experience in one of his places. If you don't believe me, just go to Pedros and ask any server any question about the menu or the food.  If you want a job, just walk right in to Pedros....they seem to hire ANYBODY...but if you want a good mexican meal then you are better off at Victors or Mexico Au Park...Pedros is no bueno...", "author": "Mark B."}
