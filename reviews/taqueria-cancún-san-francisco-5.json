It ended up missing that special touch of meat flavor that makes burritos good.\n\nSo I guess this is what a \"Mission Burrito\" tastes like, and to be honest, coming from SoCal, I think he burritos down there taste much better. They're pricier up here (but that's expected), and I don't think they taste as good. The ones in SoCal have rich flavors, and everything goes well, and the seasoning is always on point, which I couldn't quite say the same for here.

After much research and deliberation, I settled on Cancun.\n\nOrder: super carne asada burrito \nCost: about $10, cash only \n\nPros: \n-Steak was surprisingly tender\n-Flavorful overall\n-Decent size\n-Colorful, cheery atmosphere with plenty of seats\n-Free chips and salsa\n-I got there just around 4pm and had no line or wait (burrito was ready within minutes) \n\nCons:\n-Poor distribution of ingredients. First few bites were full of sour cream, and then the sour cream was hardly present halfway through. \n-No discernible cheese\n-Second half of the burrito was very salty, almost too salty to eat (perhaps correlated with the tapering off of the sour cream that helped temper the salt?)\n-Sadly, the fresh avocado chunks added little flavor or value\n-Could have used a bit more heat (or a spicier salsa)\n\nOverall, I was a bit let down by this burrito, especially at $10. I had picked Cancun because I read specifically that their burritos were well spiced and had good ingredient distribution, but this was the opposite of what I experienced. \n\nThe biggest redeeming factor was the tenderness of the steak (but maybe I'm just used to tough meat in my steak burritos and don't know any better?). \n\nI was also really disappointed that there didn't appear to be any cheese. I looked for if, many times, but if it was there I could neither taste nor see it.

Lines can get super long and crowds the inside of the place, so not good if you are claustrophobic.  \n\nMy guy friends ordered the carne asada burritos- first thing I noticed were how massive they are!  Even they had trouble eating the whole thing (one of whom did a 3 hr bike ride just before)... I can't even imagine trying to eat one myself.  Also noticed how much salsa they dumped on their burritos, which personally means that it was either not flavorful or was dry.\n\nI ordered the Alambres (beef, bacon, peppers, onions, rice, beans, and tortillas) and, again, the plate was massive.  The only reason I ate most of it was because I had just gone on a super long run and needed the carbs.  The meat was flavorful, but it was unfortunately rather tough and salty (probs was because of the bacon).\n\nSuper cheap- we all paid less than $10 for these massive plates of food (mine was the most expensive at $9.99).\n\nSo it's not a go-to place for me, but it's not the worst option ever in the Mission.  I can see why people might like it (cheap price for massive portions); maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.

On to the food.\n\nI ordered a carne asada super burrito ($8.99). It comes with rice, beans, onions, salsa, cheese, avocado & sour cream. Sin cilantro para mi. Taqueria Cancun's burritos are pretty big. They are not cylindrical like El Farolito. They are fatter and use a different kind of flour tortilla. Still good and loaded with flavors. The asada was good and the other ingredients with the meat, all went well together. It is definitely a meal unto itself. It's not cheap but you will be stuffed after you're through. \n\nWe also ordered a couple of super tacos ($3.99). One asada and one al pastor. They are big too and really loaded. Each super taco, like the super burrito, comes with onions, cilantro, salsa, cheese, avocado and sour cream. Lots of sour cream. It's good stuff! The al pastor is pretty good.

Luckily there was an ATM inside so I could withdraw some cash ($2 transaction fee). There was a line for the ATM so I'm guessing a lot of people didn't know either. I came here solely for the tacos and I ended up getting four: lengua, cabeza, carne asada, and carnitas. Total was $14, a little more expensive than I'm used to. I expect a regular taco (just onions, cilantro, and salsa) to usually be around $2.50-3 at a taqueria but it's $3.25 for one here. The tacos are pretty big though so I would say they're worth the price. \n\nThe lengua and cabeza were very tender. Carne asada wasn't that great - a bit dry. The carnitas though, was the best carnitas I've ever had! It was perfectly fried pork that was juicy and flavorful. It was definitely my favorite out of the four. What was lacking was the salsa on top of the tacos. Although the tortilla was quite soft, I would have preferred more salsa on the tacos cause after a few bites, the tacos got kind of dry. They do give chips and salsa with your purchase, but the chips tasted like something I could get at a grocery store instead of the fresh, crispy chips I get at other taquerias. I love chips and salsa along with my Mexican food so good chips are a deal breaker for me! I ended up using the salsa that came with the chips for my tacos instead. It would be so much better if they had a salsa bar! \n\nOverall, tacos were good, but I've had better experiences elsewhere and it's a bit more pricey than the other taquerias I've been to.", "author": "Cecille W."}

If you are on a trip to San Francisco and could only eat one burrito, it should be from Taqueria Canc\u00fan, Gordo's Taqueria, or La Taqueria.\n\nWhen I think of a Mission burrito I typically think of a steamed tortilla, but Taqueria Canc\u00fan griddles them. Griddled tortillas can sometimes make a burrito difficult to eat vertically, but Canc\u00fan avoids this issue by being careful in their assembly and wrapping process. The pinto beans and pico de gallo are supporting players and shouldn't overpower, and Canc\u00fan does this right. If you've consumed other Mission burritos from respectable places, you know what I mean. The rice at Canc\u00fan is a bit mushy (but very flavorful), the cheese is perfect, and the slices of fresh avocado really help keep it fresh.\n\nTaqueria Canc\u00fan's burrito is a great example of the whole being better than the sum of the parts. They slow-cook their meats. They don't over-engineer their supporting ingredients. They provide their customers with a handful of tortilla chips and salsas (red and green) for free.\n\nDespite not using steamed tortillas, this is the burrito shop I most associate with the Mission. Canc\u00fan is a classic, they do things simple and right, and I leave satisfied and stuffed, regardless if I'm sober or drunk.\n\nI will, however, get this inconvenient fact to my narrative out of the way: I HATE their Al Pastor burritos. They taste like pork in sloppy joe sauce, waaaay too sweet and ketchup-y. I come up to SF from San Diego, and we have a different idea about Al Pastor down there. If you've never had Al Pastor pork before in SD, just trust me.... it's better. \n\nBut everything else from Canc\u00fan -- chicken, steak, and carnitas -- is consistently top-notch.\n\nIf not for the missteps on the Al Pastor, I'd be willing to say Canc\u00fan is the best burrito shop in the country. Alas, a bad burrito is harder to forget than a great burrito is to remember.\n\nStill, this is my \"go-to\" burrito spot when I'm fortunate enough to be in San Francisco.\n\nFood/D\u00e9cor/Service: 4.5/2.2/NA", "author": "Jay K."}

Sounded spectacular and unfortunately turned out disappointing, at least in my opinion. \n\nI know I shouldn't order a wet burrito and expect it not to be wet, but the tomato sauce was quite watered-down. With the tomato sauce puddle and the overwhelming amounts of melted cheese, the flavor profile seemed closer to lasagna. I hate to be such a downer, but my rant goes on: the guacamole was minimal and diluted, and the al pastor was bland and scant--the interior was mostly stuffed with beans and rice, so fishing around for pieces of pork required more patience than a treasure hunt.\n\nThe redeeming factors are 1) the thought that this may be tasty if I had massive drunchies after partying too hard, and 2) that the lively, colorful ambiance is nice to dine in. I've had a wet burrito before in a not-very-authentic taqueria in South Bay and enjoyed it. Maybe my tastes for Mexican food are so bogus it's with the ranks of Panda Express fans.

I'm an El Farolito guy, and I swear by the grime on their tables that they have the juiciest burrito in all of Mission. So I was startled, and even slightly offended, when Vegg Mosby comes out to say that Taqueria Cancun is the best place for burrito. \n\nAs you may remember from my previous reviews, Vegg Mosby is a kind of vegan variant. So whenever he says there's a good restaurant, I have to take it with a grain of salt and a packet of MSG. Let's be real, Vegg has never even had Korean BBQ before, how credible could he be when it comes to food?\n\n\"Alright, fine fine fine. We'll go to Cancun. I bet it just tastes like some whack vegan joint, but I'll go with you cause I'm a good friend.\"\n\nWhen I finally sat down with my go-to burrito (Al Pastor, no sour cream, extra cheese), I had to admit that I was pleased with the price. Eight dollars and some chump change for a super burrito AND chips. This could be good. And so I took my first bite.\n\nWow. \n\nThe tortilla was toasted so there was a little snap of crunch for each bite. The Al Pastor was as juicy and greasy in just the right way. The taste was further bolstered by a generous helping of onions and cilantro and a healthy helping of beans for the texture. And finally, there were these avocado slices hiding inside that added a divinely refreshing touch on an already heavenly burrito.\n\nI quickly realized that I was eating my words faster than I was the burrito. Taqueria Cancun was legit, and Vegg Mosby deserved an apology.\n\n\"Aye man, sorry for discrediting your taste in food just because you're some sort of vegan. I'm gonna have to say that Cancun is just as good as El Farolito.\"\n\n\"It's alright, man. I know a few other vegan joints, too. We should go together sometime.\"\n\nSee, that's why you gotta love Vegg Mosby. He thinks just because he scored ONCE with Taqueria Cancun I'm gonna start listening to him for food choices.

I find writing Yelp reviews pretty natural because I take so many pictures of my food and the friends I eat it with, only to look back and pinpoint specific moments when I was particularly happy or sad.\n\nThinking about Cancun makes me nostalgic because it's been a staple of my diet since I first came to SF last summer. It's right beside Mission Control, a house I've spent so much time at during the past year, and I associate it with so many different things: late night chats with friends after leaving a club or bar, ducking out the house at 1 AM to satisfy burrito cravings, mid-afternoon snack breaks after hanging out at Dolo. Cancun's carried me through a few friendships and several hazy summer nights. I always get the veggie burrito, which is delicious and probably results in an instant three pound weight gain.

The carne asada burrito at Taqueria Canc\u00fan is good. Is it great? Not particualrly. A contender for the top 25 in San Francisco? Possibly. \n\nWhat I think makes a great burrito is the tortilla. It's quite possibly the most important component of Mexican food and without a good one, you're already at a disadvantage. Taqueria Cancun's tortilla is a bit more flaky and dry than most and something I'm not used to. Bring on the lard homie! \n\nThe carne asada burrito as a whole was a bit dry and lacked the \"wow\" factor. The rice was excellent, and the salsas were solid. I think next time I should ask for refried beans instead of the standard pinto to help make the experience a bit more \"juicy\". Another huge factor that played into my 3 star rating was because of the chips. You've GOTTA be making these in house if you're a taqueria.

It was steaming hot which is great. The tortilla was soft but wasn't grilled which I prefer. The meat was very plentiful but lacked a punch of flavor and crispiness (I prefer when the meat has just a bit of crunchiness on the outside). And though we ordered medium spicy - there was no kick at all. In fact, I had to ask for more salsa (which was AMAZEBALLS) for finish the burrito.\n\nUnlike many other places, Taqueria Cancun does not have a salsa bar. It's kinda nice not to see other peoples grubby hands all over the salsa ladles, but it's a bummer that there were more of the delicious salsa to be had. There were two types offered - one red (tomato) and one green (avocado). Both were INCREDIBLE and very very HOT.\n\nWe also had two tacos - one carne asada and one chicken. They were HUGE with piles and piles of meat. seriously, it was a little insane the amount of meat. But again, it lacked flavor and punch and frankly just a tad dry (perhaps due to a lack of salsa).

Even though it was pouring rain on the day I came, the restaurant was packed. Cancun has a standard menu of any taqueria. They're fast, and the food comes out piping hot. Perfect for a fast meal that you want to take to go, or if you're starving. I ordered a carne asada burrito (regular comes with rice, beans, salsa, and your choice of protein; the super burrito comes with rice, beans, salsa, choice of protein, cheese, avocado, and sour cream). The burrito also comes with free chips that you can also take with your to go order, or if you eat in. I recommend asking for extra green sauce to go with your burrito, its extra spicy and adds that perfect kick. I do like that they also add regular salsa for your chips. \n\nI still like La Taqueria better because they have a larger focus on meat (they dont have rice in their burritos) but Cancun is definitely a great alternative.

I met a friend at Taqueria Cancun for a weekday lunch, and ordered up a trio of tacos. I enjoyed the place, and the food was fine, but I wasn't terribly impressed. Cancun couldn't hold its own against the tacos I have at home on the regular.\n\nThe space was fun, casual and cheerfully decorated, with a kind of effortless appeal and easy atmosphere that marked it as pre-tech boom Mission. Service was quick and friendly. We ordered at the cashier, paid up (cash only), and waited for our numbers to be called. Seating was plentiful.\n\nThe complimentary chips and salsa were pretty great--crunchy, fresh tortilla chips and chunky,  flavorful red and green salsas. I ordered three tacos, a super taco with carne asada, and two regular tacos, al pastor and cabeza. All three came on soft tortillas with onions, cilantro, and salsa; the super added cheese, avocado, and sour cream. I was definitely into that super taco, and I enjoyed both the carne asada and the al pastor. The cabeza was kind of gross--definitely the squishy, mushy side of the cabeza spectrum, so I wouldn't recommend it if you only like cabeza half the time (I feel like I had a good cabeza run until Cancun, so I guess I was feeling lucky). I also just didn't find anything special about the tortillas or the quality/flavor of the meat. It all tasted good enough, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.\n\nI'll have to try some more Mexican food next time I visit the Mission. I liked my lunch at Taqueria Cancun, but it didn't step up as a San Francisco taco champion.

Having said that, if TC were to open up a New York branch you'd find me there a couple times a week gorging on a burrito mojado with carne asada...

I've actually only ordered that one thing here so I can't really comment on the rest of the menu but the chips and salsa are also tasty and the carnitas burrito is bomb. I order my burritos with just meat, cheese, avocado and sometimes salsa or a tiny bit of sour cream- no rice, no beans, no extra cilantro or onions. The carnitas here are amazing. So much flavor and so perfectly cooked. They are a little more \"wet\" than carnitas I've had elsewhere, like they've been braised in the cooking liquid. Not so wet though that the burrito is softy or anything. A lot of places will add too many spices to the carnitas or make them dry or have other issues. Here, the meat is perfect and the combination of it with the cheese and avocado is awesome. It is a pretty greasy/heavy burrito and I have a feeling they use lard in their tortillas. So definitely not something to eat all the time or the healthiest option around. Prices are really good too but it is cash only (there's an ATM with a fee inside). I'll definitely be back for a delicious burrito and a beer. 5 stars because I've had the carnitas burrito quite a few times and it's never disappointed.", "author": "Seema U."}

Based on his expert recommendation we now have a favorite post beer drinking hang out. Taqueria Canc\u00fan is fast, friendly and well priced. Portions are massive and the quality stellar, what more could one ask for? \n\nOnto the foods..\n\n-Carne Asada Burrito Mojado - Huge mega sized burrito filled with rice, beans and meat, like lots of meat. After trying a few burritos around the bay Im happy to report that this burrito had the perfect meat to filling ratio. The burrito is served slathered in green salsa, red salsa and sour cream. With so many different sauces each bite was different from the last, gotta love variety. The meat was tender and had a slight smoky flavor, good meat, good meat. For the price I felt this was a bargain!\n\n-Al Pastor Torta - I think everything is super sized at TC! This torta was thick and oh-so-messy with the fillings leaking out all over my hands during each bite. The al pastor had a nice sweet and smoky flavor, they sure know how to cook meats here. Beans, onions, avocados and sour cream graced the roll which had a nice chew and moist crumb. \n\n-Cheese Quesadilla - Cheese and a tortilla joined together through melting and ever lasting love. Not much to say here except yummy love.\n\n-Cheese Enchiladas- These were just fair in my opinion. I prefer a richer thicker more smoky chile sauce rather than the thin more brightly flavored sauce on their version. I mean these were good and stuff but weren't that satisfying to me. The beans however are f-cking superior. So creamy and smooth with a deep rich flavor that I will order a bean and cheese burrito next time we eat here. \n\n-Horchata - This wasn't nearly as bad as the sludge served at The Little Chihuahua, this version was pretty gritty and not easy to drink. After a few sips I threw it out. Note to self, stop ordering horchata. \n\nAnother huge plus for TC is the fact that they're are open late night! Oh, they are cash only so make sure you're good to go. Also, parking is a bitch in this neighborhood. Took us close to 15 minutes before we lucked out landing a spot a block from the restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-06-15", "description": "First off, let me say that the food here is legit. Cash only but decently priced (for 2017 SF) with the freshest sesos (pork brain) in the mission. This is one of my go-to spots for a quick mexi meal. (Crispy tacos or carnitas at El Buen Sabor, Cabeza tacos at La Oaxacaquena, Carnita Torta at Yucatasia being the others.) If it's primetime, call ahead and your food might be ready by the time you get to the cashier.\n\nI'm giving them 2-stars in this review because of the subpar service I received the other night. I called in an order of a double meat (camarones and sesos) super burrito and had to wait another 5 minutes after paying before it was ready, which is perfectly fine and didn't influence this review in any way. They were really busy that night. My disappointment started when I got home and took about 4 bites before it was evident that they had only put shrimp and left out the sesos. It sucked, but mistakes happen. This in itself wouldn't have earned a negative review. I called them up, explained my predicament and the guy begrudgingly told me to come back to grab a replacement burrito and to make sure I brought the other burrito with me. Again, this was all fine enough. The lightweight attitude was a bit off-putting but, whatever, maybe they get scammed with this shit all the time. What put it over the top was upon my return, the cashier/phone guy looks at my partially eaten burrito, disappointingly shakes his head and mutters something about \"you almost finished it\". WTF? I ate a quarter of it max and this fool thinks I really went all the way home and back to come up on a few extra bites of shrimp burrito? They f'd up and he tried to give me a guilt trip about it. GTFO of here with that BS. 4 stars for the food (as always), 0 stars for the guilt trip and implicit scam accusations = 2 stars.\n\nIt's important to point out that this review is mainly about the late middle aged male cashier that was working there that night. The younger dude that usually works the cashier is cool as hell.\n\nLast note: shrimp and sesos might sound gross to some of y'all but don't knock it before you try it. Or don't try it and leave all the fresh sesos for me and all the folks I've put on to its deliciousness. Also, the combo goes just as well in a quesadilla.", "author": "Carlo B."}

My roommate was raving about having to try a proper burrito and this was his favorite spot. As a burrito lover, I look back on that day as a beautiful moment that changed how I rate burritos forever.\n\nFREQUENCY: I've dined at this establishment more times than I can count (and I've only lived in SF for 3-4 months). I had to cut back to once a week because I like to stay healthy and fit and I was probably eating about 3 of these burritos per week.\n\nFOOD: Get the super burrito. Taqueria Cancun has other items on their menu but it might as well not be there at all. They have about 8 different meats to choose from (or vegetarian if you prefer) and I've tried them all. Each is delicious but my go to at this point is Al Pastor. Your burrito will come with chips plus one green and red salsa cup. I prefer the green salsa so now I ask for two green salsa's. I can't speak enough about how amazing the burrito's are here. I grew up on the East Coast and I'll honestly probably never order a burrito when back home ever again. San Francisco Super Burrito's and San Diego California Burrito's have spoiled me. TRY THIS BURRITO! It's the first thing I take any visitors to do. And it's under $10 for a mound of food.\n\nDRINK: Taqueria Cancun offers a good selection of beer, fountain drinks, and water. I'm personally a fan of a Pacifico with my burrito but my buddy gets the soda and really enjoys that too. \n\nATMOSPHERE: Taqueria Cancun has the standard vibe for a taqueria in the Mission. Tables are usually filled with people having conversation and it can get a little loud at times. Plus depending on the time of day the line may be out the door. I promise it's worth the wait. But I've learned when they are and aren't busy from my multiple visits.\n\nSTAFF: I have literally never spoken more than my burrito order to the staff. They are quite and keep to themselves but since they are all behind a counter making food I don't mind nor am I offended. They have consistently made me amazing food so they get 5 stars in my book.\n\nPAYMENT: Taqueria Cancun is cash only. They have ATM's on site.\n\nThere is one location in The Mission and one location in SoMa. Both are awesome and I go to each one regularly. If there is one thing that anyone takes away from my Yelp profile it is to try a burrito at this place!", "author": "Christopher D."}

Being a taco fiend, I went with my usual faves to get a good sense of their quality of meat but was pretty disappointed. Not worth a meal there when the amazing La Oaxaquena is just a block or two away.\n\nBetween chorizo, al pastor, and carne asada, only CARNE ASADA was worth trying I'd say. Chorizo and al pastor were both soggy, lacked crunch, and were basically unmemorable pieces of meat mixed in with the salsa on the tacos. At least the carne asada had a crispness and therefore texture to the meat, though it was still a little dry. \n\nI was feeling adventurous with a friend and we also got a BRAIN taco - if you've ever made a broth and seen blood when it's cooked in boiling water, that's about the texture of brain - soft, spongy, with a little bit of give on the outside (like when creme brulee or boiled milk has that thin layer of skin at the top). Jiggly but  disintegrates easily once you start chewing.

The tacos weren't that special to me, maybe because the lengua and al pastor were okay.

It's big, it's full of goodies, and it's topped with even more goodies (enchilada sauce, sour cream, guacamole, cheese).  My husband and I literally inhaled this thing and licked the plate.

However, in the battle of La Taqueria vs. El Farolito vs. Taqueria Cancun, Taqueria Cancun has won over my heart (read: stomach).\n\nAl pastor burritos here are a religious experience for me.  Yes, they are that good.  Whether you order the regular or super burrito, you will get a massive amount of food with quality ingredients, but obviously the super burrito is better because of the avocado.\n\nAn added plus is that the restaurant itself is larger in size than El Farolito so you're not bumping into other patrons while you wait.  I wish they were open on Tuesdays, but that's the definition of a first world problem.", "author": "David B."}

With so many options in the area (i.e. La Taqueria, Farolitos, TLC, etc, etc.) it's hard to know which one to go to. \n\nTaqueria Cancun has been my go-to Mission burrito place since I moved to SF a month and a half ago. While I could walk a little further down the street to La Taqueria (aka the acclaimed \"best burrito in the world\"), it's really nice to be able to just sit down in the restaurant and enjoy your food without the chaotic crowds of people surrounding you on all sides (which the typical experience you will have at burrito joints closer to the Mission BART stations). \n\nTaqueria Cancun has your standard burrito offerings like all other burrito places. $8-9 gets you a standard sized burrito with chips and salsa. I usually get the super burrito with carnitas to satisfy my constant burrito cravings.  \n\nIt should be noted that there are two Taqueria Cancun's in the Mission District. I usually go to the Cesar Chavez one since it is much less crowded than the one near 19th St. If you are just going to grab-and-go, either destination is fine, but if you plan on sitting down and enjoying your meal I would definitely recommend the one closer to Cesar Chavez.", "author": "Derek L."}

I've been here several times, and each time I've had bad stomach pain several hours after eating and an upset stomach the following day.\n\nThat aside, the food has always tasted very good, but not necessarily better than other taquerias in the Mission. It also is always packed with people when everyone's hungry after a night of drinking. Even so, the wait isn't too long.\n\nI couldn't imagine many people wanting to eat here sober because it is pretty dirty. The staff cannot keep up with clearing tables of dirty dishes, nor wiping down the tables after customers have finished eating. That said, what really doesn't make sense is that there doesn't seem to be any trashcans for people to scrape their own plates and throw trash away. Seems like a poor management decision because trash just ends up on the floor instead of in a receptacle. Also, the bathroom is rank.\n\nIf this seems like a negative review, that's because it is, but I want to state that I would probably eat here again with friends late at night if my stomach could handle the food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-13", "description": "Smack in the middle of The Mission, Taqueria Cancun sports some of The City's best burritos.\n\nWith wooden tables and benches, faux brick walls, and adobe tiled floors, Taqueria Cancun screams \"burrito joint\" from the moment you enter. The menu holds no surprises, and none are missed. When you wander into this dive, you want a burrito, taco, or quesadilla, straight up with no frills.\n\nThe regular burrito ($6.25) features rice, beans, onion, cilantro, salsa, and your choice of meat. The standard meats are well represented: carne asada, pollo, carnitas, and veggie are on hand. There is also lengua (beef tongue), cabeza (beef head), and sesos (beef brains) for the more adventurous. The super ($7.25) adds cheese, avocado, and sour cream. Since it is included as a separate ingredient, the cilantro overtones may be too much for some diners, while others may find it pleasant. \n\nThe carne asada super burrito was sizable (not epic, but still large), and there was a good mix of ingredients throughout, making each bite a multi-taste pleasure. Taqueria Cancun burritos have a higher steak to filler ratio than El Farolito, and the tortillas are griddled rather than steamed, providing ample differentiation between the two big Kahunas of Mission burritos. \n\nThough the tortilla chips are complimentary, but there is no salsa bar. Rather salsa is doled out by the cashier in tiny, miserly plastic cups. As in any good Mission burrito joint, there is a myriad of well priced domestic and Mexican beers, Mexican and regular sodas, and aguas frescas.\n\nYes, the lines can be long, but they move quickly. Yes, it's cash only. Yes, it can be smokey at times.  What else would you expect from one of the quintessential burrito joints in The City.", "author": "CJ G."}

Then they hired this cranky old guy who rolls misshapen burritos with gaps and uneven ingredient distribution.\n\nFor a couple years, things remained stable -- ask for extra salsa, go somewhere else when cranky was rolling -- but then the decline accelerated. They painted over the glass sneeze guard through which you were once able to watch your burrito being prepared. That is a highly suspect move! And they've put up a sign which states they soon will no longer be open on Tuesdays. Why? It's packed every single night.\n\nToday I ordered my old favorite -- the shrimp burrito. At its best it's crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, shrimp drippings mixing with sour cream to form a delicious orange mess. Needless to say, today was a let down.

Expect some major lines on weekends, but partly because this place is a very solid post Day-in-Dolores taco place. \n\nFor some reason I really enjoy watching my food cook in front of me. Make it is just seeing the raw ingredients become something so deliciously palatable. Or maybe I don't trust people want to see how fresh it is. Regardless, the food at Cancun is as fresh as can be as I watched it all prepared in front me me. I got a carnitas burrito, and I'd say that I could have probably saved what I had left for breakfast the next day. Incredibly generous portions, in my opinion.\n\nA small touch that I particularly liked is that they cook the tortilla in such a way that they make it a touch crispy. It gave the burrito a texture a bit closer to a quesadilla, but I really enjoyed it. I've had enough burritos in my lifetime that it can be fun to see someone mix it up a bit.", "author": "Jake B."}

Little did I know that 6 years later, it has still held up to be my gold standard burrito. I tried other popular joints like El Farolito and the so-called \"best burrito in America\" at La Taqueria, but Cancun has got to be by far my favorite. The tortilla wrap has a great texture and really flakey. The rice has a hint of lime that tastes awesome with the avocado. Although there have been times where the avocado was not distributed evenly, I learned that you can add in extra avocado for free! And it lowers your chance of having avo only on one side of your burrito. I have come here both drunk and sober countless of times, and either way this place is amazing. I am also thankful for that \"best burrito\" place directing the crowd over to La Taqueria as I can now stroll in and get my favorite burrito with a shorter wait time! \n\nUPDATE: I came back here after I wrote this review and discovered that they'll be closed every Tuesday starting on October 21st.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-02-16", "description": "I like Taqueria Canc\u00fan. It's not mind blowing nor is it close, but it does serve up some tasty Mexican fare. I put off writing my review until I gave them a second try, which happened to be months apart. On my initial visit, I ordered a trio of tacos, in which I tested their three meats, carne asada; pollo asado; and al pastor. It was good but my friend's torta was much more impressive than my taco plate. Last night, I followed up with the same order and tried all three tacos all over again.\n\nTaqueria Canc\u00fan is definitely a Mission taqueria with late hours and plenty of drunk hipsters. I can't begin to describe the amount of blasphemy I heard inside the taqueria. \"Sup, dude...can I get a...\" and \"Can I get a bean and cheese burrito with guacamole, no beans.\" These are just some of the type of things you can expect to hear at 1am. The taqueria is pretty cramped and gets packed with steady business, especially during late night hours. It can be a bit of a gamble to get a table, but as long as a friend stakes out a table while you order, you should be okay. \n\nConsidering the amount of orders they're processing, I'm impressed with the quick turnaround. My three tacos and my friend's shrimp burrito were ready in five minutes or so. We initially were taking our food to go, but after finding a table, we decided to enjoy our food while its hot. I have to say I'm disappointed in that Canc\u00fan took my three tacos and wrapped them all in foil. If I had taken them home, they would have turned into soggy, juicy tortillas with three different meats. I do realize its a means to cut cost, but had I come home to soggy tacos, I probably wouldn't return to Canc\u00fan.\n\nCanc\u00fan is plenty of generous with their portions, as they stuffed the tacos with plenty of meat. [see pic] The first taco I tried was the carne asada and the meat was tender and had plenty of flavor. Next up was the al pastor, which always tends to be my favorite and this was no different. The al pastor was tasty and had great flavor as well and most importanly was not greasy. Last up was the pollo asado taco which was good as well but if I had to rate the tacos it would be: al pastor, carne asada, and pollo asado. All were great and filling and reasonablly priced at $8 with tax.\n\nI do think Taqueria Canc\u00fan is a great spot for Mexican food in the Mission, but it does have its problems. At the top of the list is the fact that there's no salsa bar. I'm sorry but what the hell am I supposed to do with two pinner salsas when I have three tacos and a bag of Costco bought chips? Yes, the salsa is made fresh and does have real avocado, but what's the point of teasing me with salsa for two or three chips. There's absolutely no way I can go back and cut everyone just to see if I can get more salsa. Forgive me but I love my condiments, salsa especially. Lastly, the cashier is always less than custom service oriented. He can often be seen texting and simply isn't a people person. Nevertheless, I will say that these small imperfections will not stop me from coming back.\n\nAmbiance/Decor: 2 Stars (out of 5)\nFood: 3 Stars (out of 5)\nService: 2 Stars (out of 5)\nPrice: $\nOverall: 3 Stars (out of 5)\n\nPros:\n+ Mission taqueria\n+ Great prices/value\n+ Generous portion per price\n+ Good tasting Mexican\n+ Fast turnaround \n+ Mexican/Domestic beer \n\nCons:\n- No salsa bar\n- 2 salsas per order\n- To go tacos are put together all in the same piece of foil\n- Chips are not made in house\n- Cashier lacks people skills\n- Cash only\n- Hipsters", "author": "Alexander E."}

My boyfriend and I had about 30 minutes in San Francisco before we had to hit the road to Yosemite and in our previous trips to sf we had never had a chance to get Mexican food in the mission. I just googled 'best Mexican in the mission' as we were low on time and this place came up. It was soooo unbelievably good. From the outside the place looks a little unexceptional and there's really nothing special with the decor inside. But the fact that the restaurant was full and there was a line was an omen of something special. There were plenty of tourists there who must have googled the same thing I did, but there were also plenty of locals. The guys working were super speedy and efficient. I got a super veggie quesadilla and my boyfriend got burrito mojado. We were both incredibly happy with our sizable meals. The tortillas were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and the cheese was perfectly melted. We were very fat and happy after finishing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-06-06", "description": "While in pursuit for the taqueria in SF that will make my panties drop the way La Pinata in the east bay does, I became infatuated with Taqueria Cancun. I had never had it but it was always on the \"Best of\" lists for the burrito category. If this many people think this is the best burrito ever, they can't be wrong...right? Wrong. Well, wrong according to me anyways. Everyone has different tastes and everyone has a different description of their \"perfect burrito\". Taqueria Cancun just isn't my type of burrito. I think if TC were a boy and we went on a date, I would decline the second date, saying to him, \"Look, you're a cool guy, we're just different people.\" I wouldn't bad mouth him to my friends, I would just tell them that he just isn't my type. Ok, let me explain why.\n\nIn my typical fashion, I ordered the biggest, wettest, sloppiest burrito on the menu. I ordered the Burrito Mojado with carne asada (see pic.) I noticed on the menu that it didn't mention guacamole being in the super burrito, which is odd. Normally the super burrito from any good place has guac included. So I asked the guy taking my order to add guac to the burrito. He informed me that they do not have guacamole, but do have avocado. I almost passed out, but held myself together and told him to go ahead and add the avocado. \n\nUpon arrival, I noticed the burrito was of \"okay\" size. Nothing monstrous. In order for a burrito to rate high with me, it must be the size of a small child. I cut the the non-child like figure in half for the official Liz Burrito Inspection. \n\nFirst immediate gripe: They gave me f****** whole beans. I immediately went flaccid. I hate, I despise, I LOATHE whole beans in my burrito. I love re fried beans!!!! They make the burrito more wet and mushy so that all the items blend together. I knowwwwww, whole beans make a more authentic Mexican burrito. But this review is based on my personal burrito preferences so I'm whining. The dude taking my order didn't ask my preference of beans (usually they do) and I suppose it is also my fault for not thinking of emphasizing that I wanted re fried beans when he didn't ask. But still, I was irritated. \n\nI picked a piece of the carne asada out of the burrito to try it's quality alone. I must say that it had great flavor and was nice and moist. Taqueria Cancun DOES make a very tasty carne asada. So 4-5 stars for that. \n\nI didn't see much evidence of avocado being in the burrito upon slicing it open. So I dug in and still didn't find much avocado. I was bummed out about that. \n\nThey did smother it in a lot of enchilada sauce, which I really enjoyed. However, they didn't put a sh!t load of sour cream on top. And it was really runny looking sour cream. I am wondering if the stuff on top was actually creme (in Spanish pronounced 'crame-uh' but with an accent and stuff.) I think creme is similar or maybe the same thing as Cr\u00e8me fraiche. Creme is good, but not as good as our typical sour cream, in my opinion. \n\nSo, the burrito was OKAY. I must add that the prices were really impressive. Pretty cheap. But still, I would rather pay a few extra bucks and get my guac, thick sour cream, and a few extra inches of length and girth. I think perhaps that Taqueria Cancun is more on the traditional Mexican burrito path. Which is great, don't get me wrong, but just not my thing.", "author": "Liz M."}

Between two people, we wolfed that down in a blink of an eye. And damn. it was good. Every bite had the perfect distribution of meat (we got chicken), cheese (CHEESE GROMIT!), salsa, and guacamole.

I came to SF with expectations to be blown away by two of the most popular burrito spots in the bay area. I've been told they're the best in the state, better than LA or SD. Having lived in SD for  7 years, i'm going to strongly disagree after this initial tasting. The tortilla at both places are lacking (not toasty enough) and sauces/salsas are underwhelming (not enough onion or spice). Having stated that, lets continue on to the comparing Taqueria Cancun  to El Farolito.\n\nEl Farolito has better beans (creamier and more flavor), better tortilla (more crispy) and better sauce (more spice). Sounds like everything in a burrito right? El Farolito has the win in the bag right?! Problem is that I'm carnivore and Cancun had the better carna asada. Far by. Better seasoned and cooked to a slight crisp that adds texture. And the protein is very important. Like the important  enough to even out three other definitive advantages to El Farolito.\n\nBased solely on this one  visit to both places, i'd be most likely to return to Taqueria Cancun because the quality of the protein is the most important thing to me.

It was my first time in ages, bar hopping around the Mission on a Thursday night.  I'm normally in bed by 11PM if I have work the next day.  A \"crazy school night\" for me is having a few glasses of wine (or saki, depending on the place) with my dinner at a restaurant with my friends.  \n\nI thought that I would last that Thursday night out.  I even cheated and power-napped after work so that I wasn't going to burn out as fast and be a debbie downer.  Unfortunately, I still managed to be \"over it\" by 12:30.  Two of my close friends and I decided to sneak away from the rest of the group at Beauty Bar and eat at Cancun for old times sakes.

The ambiance was great. Just a nice day today.\n\nTaqueria Cancun is one of the heavy hitters on Yelp when it comes to Mission Mexican food. So it was just a matter of time before I got my hands on one of these burritos. I LOVE burritos in case you didnt know. \n\nBurrito of choice, carne asada super burrito. The pieces of carne asada were juicy, tender, and full of flavor. The rice was super soft and fluffy. The flavor of the rice was really subtle but complimented the meat juice well. The burrito was HUGE, although it had a little bit too much rice but hey, I'm asian, I'm not one to complain about rice. There was still a hefty amount of meat in there.\n\nI wish there was a salsa bar so I can load up on that stuff. They keep it behind the counters so you have to ask them for a little container of salsa. The pico de gallo was good but the gaucamole stole the show. It's has a little spice to it and has a super creamy texture. Ask for lots of little containers of gauc, trust me.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I thought the ambiance was great. Tacky decorations were plastered on the ceilings and walls. Festive music was blasting. The smell of the grill was drifting through the air. I loved it. \n\n*CASH ONLY*", "author": "Harry T."}

The only downside is that the lines can be really long here, plus its cash only.  I'll definitely be back for my shrimp burrito fix!", "author": "Mike M."}

The ambiance may get a little stuffy, plus the yellow walls and shoddy benches won't win any decoration contests for most people.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for good Mexican food in the Mission, this should be on your list; near the top if you have less than $10 to spend.

You're not familiar with the area, you've parked at the northern end of the Mission District, you're trying to walk to El Farolito, and you're hungry as a hippo.\n\nThis place was jammed packed on a Sunday evening. I didn't time how long it took from the second I walked in to the time I took my first bite, but I have that same feeling right now waiting for season 3 of Eastbound and Down to start. Yes, that long! \n\nI was set on ordering the quesadilla suiza at El Farolito to see what all the fuss is about, but since I didn't reach my destination I was delighted to see that Taqueria Cacun also offered this dish. I came with a friend and we decided to share a quesadilla suiza and a chicken super burrito. How can you resist ordering anything with the word \"super\" in the title? I dare you to try. Our order number was finally called and let me tell you, the quesadilla suiza was definitely worth the wait. This was made with a healthy serving of grilled beef surrounded by globs and globs of cheese melted in between two massive flour tortillas. The tortillas were grilled to perfection, just the right crispiness. The extremely tender beef combined with the cheese satisfied all my taste buds. \n\nNow on to the chicken \"I got tricked by the name super\" super burrito. It was a little bit of chicken and a ton of rice and beans. I think it also came with a dab of lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado. I couldn't tell because the amount of rice and beans completely covered up the deliciousness of the rest of the burrito. If only Super Man was called Man, I would have avoided this blunder.\n\nHad we ordered two quesadilla suizas, there's no doubt in my mind this would have been a 5-star review.  I may never find out how delicious El Farolito is, but at least I can be the 886th person here on Yelp to give Taqueria Cancun at least 4 stars.", "author": "Eric K."}

I doubt I'll have a Cancun visit that was quite as magical as that first trip, but it's the kind of food that warms your tummy while you sit down on a Sunday night and catch up on emails. That sets you back $6 for a beer and a dinner you can't finish. That requires you to carry half a burrito in your purse for the rest of the day while you walk around the Mission after stopping here for lunch.\n\nAnd, as far as I'm concerned, any place that allows me to positively feast with the cash I have in my coat pocket at the tail end of a brutal Saturday night, or that can half-live up to my drunken fantastical expectations is pretty darn good in my book.\n\n(I have never been to actual Cancun)", "author": "Amanda F."}

When you dine, the guys bring you water and your order, they don't really come around and cater to you, its a pretty informal atmosphere.  I don't mind getting up a few times for more 1-oz size of salsa but I do mind that there's no horchata. Bummer. I really was craving it.  \n\nI think I've finally found the closest thing to a San Diego burrito in SF.  What I like about the carnitas and carne asada burritos here is how juicy and tender the meat is; the carne aside is cut up into tiny pieces- something I've never experience anywhere, not dry, very tasty. Although they skimp on the salsa and chips, they make it all up in their burritos. These burritos are BIG with the right amounts of each ingredient, loads of guacamole line the tortilla, lots of guac and salsa are mandatory in my Mexican food. I was only able to eat half. \n\nThis place is in the mission and I would've had a more pleasant experience if it weren't for the bum coming in half a dozen times, yelling something, getting kicked out, coming back in, yelling something again, getting kicked out, he finally came back and changed it up- suddenly a liquor bottle appeared in his hand which he proceeded to guzzled down. It was like a creepy magic show desperate for applause or any kind of credit. Props to the guys in the kitchen for keeping their cool and pushing him out every single time he came in.

When I saw it on the 2010 7 x 7 Big Eat list, I was finally convinced to drag myself out to Cancun to see what all the hype was about.

I asked the guy at the register if they had any really spicy salsa, like habenero salsa, and he said the green one he had provided was very spicy. That was so bogus. Get that weak \"hot\" sauce out of my face! It was about as spicy as a sweet watermelon agua fresca. Also, at an authentic Mexican restaurant in the mission, is it too much to expect fresh chips made in house? Even the gringo white person Mexican places in the Marina make their own chips, WTF! \n\nThen came my burrito, a super chicken burrito. Overstuffed grilled tortilla packed with flavorless chicken, cheese, avocado, sour cream, salsa, rice, and beans. Tasted bland as fiber one cereal. I mean, do they even marinate the chicken? Come on! Also, you must be the only taqueria in the Mission to serve up whole beans; where's the refried beans when you need them?!? These are supposed to be dirty, greasy, gut blasting mission burritos! I didn't know they sold Baja Fresh burritos in the mission! \n\nAnyway, I won't be coming here again.

He's a sweet fella, though!\n\nTostada de Ceviche with Avocado- Sure beats El Farolito's. They were spot on with the marinade! Not too sour. Not too watery. Good balance of cilantro and onions. Good portion of fish too! I think it was tilapia.\n\nAlambres- Bacon fat makes everything taste better. Especially when slathered about onions and mild green peppers. That's all I've got to say. Oh yeah, bring some Tums.\n\nCarne Asada Burrito- Aromatic, but standard. Nothing hopped out at me in terms of flavor.", "author": "Colleen W."}

Hopped onto my yelp and came across Taqueria Cancun and saw that it had 1400+ reviews so i thought i must definitely give it a try.  I think a big part (for me atleast) of mexican food is the chips n salsa.  I am huge fan of chips n salsa and from my experience, if the chips n salsa arent good, neither is the food.  The chips n salsa were nothing special at all.  I ordered the super carne asada burrito and it was OK.  Id eat here again if i was in the area, but wont go out of my way to eat here.

Christmas lights year round, or 2.)  Questionable hygiene practices in the kitchen.  \n\nWhile Taqueria Cancun doesn't actually meet either of those requirements exactly, they do have immensely colorful decorations hanging down from their ceiling year round, and the bathroom is definitely scary...but that's okay, because you came here for one thing:  The BEST Burrito in all of San Francisco!!  \n\nTheir carne asada is moist and flavorful, already very different from the rawhide-style chunks of shriveled beef found at most taquerias.  And instead of filling your burrito with watery guacamole, they give you the real deal:  humongous hunks of fresh avocado!\n\nI also highly recommend their quesadilla suisa - succulent, flavorfully meaty and cheesy and incredibly filling!!\n\nA word to the wise:  don't order the refried beans if you can't handle heat.  Cancun's refried beans are super-picante, something that often surprises new patrons who are used to the uber-bland kind found at other taquerias, Tex-Mex restaurants, and from a can.  Not a fan of black beans, either?  Try the pinto beans - they won't scorch your mouth like the refried ones, but feel substantially lighter in your stomach than black beans!\n\nThe only downer about Taqueria Cancun is the corn tortilla chips, which aren't the thin, crispy, salty addictive kind found at most other taquerias...but you don't generally go to a taqueria for the chips, right?\n\nBest of all, Taqueria Cancun is open really late at night...so if your burrito craving hits after several hours of hitting the local bars in that neighborhood, you might still have time to stop over at Cancun for something substantial to soak up all the alcohol in your stomach before heading off to bed.\n\nSure, there are folks for whom this taqueria isn't the earth-moving experience it is for me and mine...but I figure these folks just haven't tried the carne asada!", "author": "Amy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-16", "description": "A brilliant coworker of mine suggested we head to the Mission for an evening out. I can think of no better place to start the fun than is burrito place, which has burritos so good they will Don King your hair  with each bite.\n\nThere's not much more to say about the food other than it's incredible, perfectly cooked innards that don't suffer from the typical burrito problem that each ingredient is ghettoized within the tortilla. Things were spread evenly and awesomely and it was the same consistent goodness from bite one. The green sauce they give you is pretty spicy, so don't overdo it and ruin your burrito until you've sampled it. Tortilla chips also smacked of yum.\n\nBut before i move on, i must pay homage to the tortillas themselves. Now i have traveled the earth, had my fair share of foodstuffs designed as a vehicle to get other foodstuffs into my belly. Of the greats (butter cookies for nutella, terducken, chick fil a biscuits) nothing comes close to these. These must be some Atlantean recipe, something passed from the alien visitors to the Mayan and Aztec high priests. They are the rising and setting sun and all life in-between. Their mix of taste, thickness and barely charred flakiness means that they pierce your chest cavity and grab hold of your very soul li ke the first love of your life.  Were that i only lived in San Francisco.....\n\nSo what stops this place from being the perfect establishment? It is understandably crowded... While the clientele seemed pretty damn cool, friendly and in a good mood (who wouldn't if they were eating there) it was pretty close quarters and if your party is larger than 4, chances are you will either have to split up at different picnic table style seats or wait a while for a seat. Chances are the former once you get your food because you will lack the patience to wait.\n\nAlso, if Mission life isn't your thing, then this will probably be too sketchy for you...but really, this is worth any trial or tribulation to get to it.\n\nOverall, its in the same service style as  (line ordering going towards a cashier), but looping them in the same group as Cancun is like saying Cortes was close enough to Quetzalcoatl... Go there, be merry, bring cash, be ready to order and you will be rewarded with a happy ummy that prepares you for whatever late night adventures you are getting yourself into.", "author": "Ned C."}

I just don't get what all the hype is about. I have to give it to them, for a hole in the wall Mexican place in the Mission that gets as much foot traffic as this place does, it is very clean. The wait to get your food can be a little lengthy, but that's to be expected from such a busy place. \n\nThat being said, I have to explain why I gave the place 3 stars. I was a little disappointed with...the food. Say whaaaaaat? Yeah, sorry guys, but I just didn't think this place was as amazing as the yelp reviews had made it seem. Ended up ordering a chicken super burrito and a carne asada super burrito. I have to say, the meats were amaaazing. The carne asada was marinated really well, was super juicy, and just had awesome flavor. The thing I really enjoyed about the chicken was that little bit of crunch which gave the burrito a really nice bite. \n\nThe gripe I had with the super burritos is the amount of filler ingredients that's in there. The rice and beans don't add much to the burrito flavor-wise, so the huge amount of each that they put in there really does a disservice to the great tasting meat. The best part of my burrito was the last couple of bites because all of the meat gathered at the bottom, with just a bit of rice and beans. Those last couple of bites were amaaaazing. Unfortunately, that means that the other 3/4 of the burrito was all rice and beans. \n\n If the whole burrito was made like the last 1/4 of mine, Taqueria Cancun would've definitely gotten 5 stars in my book.", "author": "Angelo D."}

This should be a good sign, right?  With high hopes and an unsteady stomach, due to motion sickness, I entered the restaurant.  Immediately I noticed the papel picado adorning the ceiling.  The colorfulness of the art brightened my spirits.  After a few more moments of looking at the art, I decided to turn my attention to the menu above the cashier.  \n\nAs I had never been here before, I needed some time to decide what I wanted.  While I was contemplating the menu, the man at the cashier stood there looking exasperated and kept tapping his notepad, which made me feel like I should hurry.  Mind you, there was no one else in line. \n\nFinally, I decided on a regular grilled chicken burrito and the boyfriend decided to get the regular al pastor burrito.  The man at the cashier gave us some chips, salsa, and guacamole.  We picked a table and waited for our friends to arrive.  While we waited, we snacked on the chips with the salsa and guacamole.  The salsa and guacamole had a nice amount of spiciness.  Our burritos arrived a few minutes later.  \n\nThe burritos were quite big but not quite as firmly wrapped as I would have liked.  Though I kept the aluminum foil wrapped around the burrito, the burrito started to fall apart, making it hard to eat as I neared the end of the burrito.  I liked that the chickens were grilled and cut into chunks but I felt that they skimped on the chicken and put in a lot of rice and beans as filler.  I couldn't even taste the chicken until I was 1/3 of the way through the burrito.  I tried a few bites of my boyfriend's al pastor burrito and I thought it was okay.  The place was nice enough to give extra sauce when we asked.\n\nOverall, I thought it was okay.

I grew up in San Francisco and I remember first hearing accolades about this place from a certain burning man loving vegan physics teacher, which should have clued me in to the fact that it sucked. Vegans have no taste in food, burners have no taste period...but I digress. How much does it suck? Let me count the ways:\n1. dry ass tortillas\n2.chicken that tastes like the bits in a can of chicken soup\n3. pastores that is extra ketchup-ey\n4. Chalky horchata\n5. The chips are always stale. I know they are free but still\nIn sum, the food is as shittily bland as the crowds it attracts: pasty faced transplants who see the bright decor and don't know any better. If you are drunk and need some gringo mexican food, it is seriously worth it to walk a few blocks to one of the farolitos. The green sauce is much better at farolitos.", "author": "Julia M."}

Okay, so it's not in the straight hood, but you should be warned.  I know this is a weird outlier situation, but the last time I was there I had my burrito stolen by some homeless man.  I didn't really mind since I set it down to go grab some chips and I felt bad for the dude.  BUT I did have issues the SECOND time it happened!  The second time months later, I was sitting at the bench and I set the burrito down literally in front of me and then turned my head to talk to my friend.  A few minutes later, my friend pointed over and laughed as another homeless dude started eating my burrito in-front of me.  I didn't make that big of deal (mainly because I respect the Darwinian 'Winning' attitude that the guy had).  \n\nSo that's my warning.  If you're not done with the burrito, don't EVER put it down even if it's literally half a foot from your chest.  I now travel there with duct-tape and tape my burrito to my hands.

Last night I got the torta con jamon because I wasn't hungry enough for one of their huge burritos. It was good. Wasn't the best torta i've ever had but it was only $5 so yeah...it's good for the price. \n\nSo yes, I'll give it 4 stars for being open late night to appease my drunken hunger as well as the cheap prices.", "author": "David C."}

The anatomy of the Cancun taco is as follows.  Double tortilla thingie, smothered with a GIANT dollop of the meat of your choice (but seriously, trust me, just get the Al Pastor and the Chorizo) as well as a ton of Salsa.  It's greasy, your hands and perhaps shirt will be stained, but as the juicy sloppy mess hits your mouth it generates a tacogasm that rocks you back and forth for basically the whole night.

Taqueria Cancun knows how to pack it all in their burritos: ingredients, portions and flavor! \n\nWe ordered the Super Burrito with Carne Asada. The burrito was at least two pounds, and served up super fast. The meat was really tender and full of flavor, and evenly distributed among the other ingredients including avocado, sour cream, rice, etc. The best part of the burrito, in my opinion, is the outside of the tortilla. Most places just warm the tortilla before they fill it up, but Taqueria Cancun throws it on the flat top with the cheese sprinkled on top. Not only does this ensure that the cheese actually melts in the burrito (there isn't anything more gross than semi-melted cheese), but it also gives the outside of the tortilla a little bit of crispiness.

Biting into it made my weekend, and it was full of cheesy, cilantro-y freshness.  I found that adding some of the pico de gallo and (spicy) salsa verde from my chips was a great idea, and added a little bit of extra flavor.  That was my only area for criticism, is that I would have liked some more seasoning or spice in there.  \n\nNow, that may be because I've gotten used to the less-authentic offerings that are more accessible to me, and I will still say that I love Chipotle, which is like a flavor explosion, but in my experience this was more true to the real deal, and that's OK with me.

I haven't had the chance for a good direct comparison, but from what I remember, it was similar to El Farolito, which I also enjoyed.\n\nBottom line here... for your minimal investment, you will get a huge burrito that is incredibly satisfying and filling, quick service, and a lively place to chow down.", "author": "OJ B."}

What I didn't like was the seasoning on the chicken.  I am not sure what it was, but it looked like curry and cayenne pepper mix, and it tasted weird.

I am now a turncoat in the burrito wars.\n\nFor a long time I swore by your veggie super burritos (why yes, I do eat food that isn't fried or never had a face sometimes) - if I was anywhere in the Mission looking for a burrito, I'd come to you over others, even if it meant a walk or a BART ride.  I've had decent burritos and other assorted goodies elsewhere, but there was something about you that I just craved and adored.\n\nHowever, I had a revelation encased within a grilled tortilla and a cylinder of aluminum foil this past Friday evening.  I expected good, but not One of The Best Damn Burritos Ever.  Granted, like many places, when you're eating the burrito you'll get a pocket of sour cream here, avocado there, maybe some cheese and rice, then some rice and bean, then a big glop of salsa, but I personally like the little surprises in every bite.  \n\nUnlike *some* places (I don't mean you EF, but one that I have on the side when you're not available - since we're being honest and shit), sour cream and avocado is included in a veggie super burrito and you get a bunch of thick but well-made chips, along with two kinds of salsa.   I'm afraid the chips are better than yours, EF.\n\nI'm sticking with 4.5 stars for now only because I haven't tried anything else yet, but I think this is a relationship I must explore and see where it takes me.  \n\nSorry EF - I wish I could say it's not you, it's me as personal taste is so subjective, but unfortunately that's the whole point.  We can still be friends though, and we'll totally hang out.  If I'm in the area.   KIT kthxbai. \n\nSus.annah B.", "author": "Sus... B."}

I should actually be ashamed of myself. I spent the bulk of my life in the Bay Area and consider myself to be a Mexican food connoisseur, yet in spite of that, in my 26 years of life, I have only been to the Mission District once to sample its scrumptious burritos. For shame!!\n\nI live in LA now but I have made it a point to go to at least one burrito place in the Mission every time I go back to the Bay. In my extensive reviews, I found that there is a pretty big consensus that the best two places in the Mission are La Taqueria and Taqueria Cancun. I wasn't sure where exactly on Mission each place was located, so my friend and I decided to drive down the street and stop at the first one we saw.\n\nAs is the problem with most places in San Francisco, parking is a beeyotch. Luckily, as soon as we saw Taqueria Cancun, a spot opened up directly across the street. We were there before the bars let out so the place wasn't too packed. It took about 10 min from the moment I first stood in line to when I received my burrito. The ordering system is simple. You pay for what you want at the register and he/she gives you a number. Then the guys preparing the food call our your number when ready. \n\nI ordered the Carne Asada burrito and it was delicious. The night was a bit hazy but some of the ingredients I remembered being in it were carne asada, rice, sour cream, guacamole, and beans. A pretty normal collection of ingredients but assembled better than pretty much any other place. The beans and meat were phenomenal. They were both so juicy and succulent that I thought I might have to order another one. \n\nThe crowd was nice too. There was a group of Hispanic girls singing along with a guitar behind us making it feel a little more authentic. Every person I caught sight with smiled at me. Even some random girl sat down and told my friend and I how much she loved Filipino people. I definitely am not in LA anymore.", "author": "Jamie Q."}

I resisted Cancun based mostly on the fact that the totriila falls apart on their burritos while you're eating them, making the whole endeavor high-maintenance (some might rightly call ME high-maintenance for this).\n\nBut of the 761 factors that go into rating taquerias, location (I live a block away) and taste converged in 2006, and I've been drawn like a magnet ever since.\n\nSimply the best forest despite only slightly above-average trees. And by that (for those lost to analogy), I mean that no single ingredient is incredible knock-your-socks-off, but they all come together to create the most enjoyable taqueria experience.\n\nI tend to go for super grilled-chicken tacos, super grilled-chicken burritos, or super vegetarian burritos. Per the paragraph above, I think it's Cancun's salsa that really seals the deal. It's spicy, so hold onto your hat, but it enhances all the other flavors in whatever you're eating.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the huevos-and-chorizo breakfast. For those who eat lightly in the a.m., one order will easily feed two people.\n\nLastly, Cancun is still cheap. And by cheap, I mean affordable, not chintzy.\n\nPost-lastly: My cohort and I LOVE the fact that sometimes there's a hyphen between \"Can\" and \"cun,\" and have affectionately begun to refer to the place as \"Can-hyphen-cun.\"", "author": "Jeff H."}

Al pastor tacos are piquant and delicious with just a hint of sweetness to make the flavors more than one dimensional. Love their lengua, it's soft and pillowy. Same with their cabeza although it was a bit high on the fat content. Very beefy flavor though so you win there. Last but not least, they overstuff their tacos. There is a LOT of meat in there. Take that for what it's worth.\n\nI think they can improve on their salsas and their chips. It's relatively minor to the taqueria experience but every detail counts in a competitive market. I like that their salsas have a nice bite to them though. \n\nPrices are bit higher than most taquerias in the area but they're dependable so it's a worthy sacrifice. \n\nRecommendations: Al pastor, carnitas, lengua, orange-carrot juice.\n\nConclusion: You can hold your head up high telling people that you ate here.

I honestly cannot say that there is anything special about the food here.  I'm wondering if others are enamored with this hole-in-the-wall more for the price and portion size.\n\nThe carne asada was cooked well and was moist but it was not fragrant or tasty.  The burrito's only pro were fresh slices of avocado. But the cons included the aforementioned tasteless carne asada and also how the scant amounts of avocado, meat and sour cream were drowned in excessive, heaping piles of rice and beans.  Not well balanced.  The taco salad was nearly unmemorable and if we did not perk it up with the free house salsa it would have been.  The taco salad bowl itself was stale.\n\nIf you are planning to eat there then just be aware that there are mostly picnic style tables and unless you have 4 or more people in your party you will likely be sharing a table with a buzzed, but friendly, stranger.  The jukebox sitting there is also kind of random, but I'm sure it is a lot fun for the post-bar crowd.", "author": "Rick T."}

It can get a little crowded inside, so you might want to have a friend snag a table if there's one free while you wait in line.

I really wanted to jump on the band wagon and give it 4 or 5 stars but I cannot and almost gave it 2 stars. First and foremost i love Mexican food especially Burritos, I can honestly say it is my favoritest  food in the whole wide world( yea i said favoritest). I have been to a million different places similar to Taq Cancun whether it was in  SF, L.A., San Diego or Mexico and enjoyed it . The carne asada burrito i ordered was one of the worst i have ever eaten. It was very bland, lacked any kind of flavor and was nothing but filler. I watched the guy make my burrito and though it was a bean and rice burrito for someone else. Don't believe me, it had 2-3 scoops of rice, 2 scoops of beans and 1 full scoop of carne. I also asked and paid for guacamole and got a 2 slices of avocado instead thanks. I seriously only ate half of my burrito and threw the other half away and left very disappointed. \n\nNow on to the good, i think there salsa verde was very good and went well with the chips they serve (but it could not save my burrito). It had that little kick i enjoy in good salsa. The chips you get when you eat here were decent nothing special but enjoyed with the tasty salsa. Taqueria Cancun offers many different types of beverages for you to enjoy including beer. I went with the Sidral Mundet Apple Soda cause i love it. \n\nIf i ever come back again i will order a bean and rice burrito and hope they fill it with carne asada and guacamole ...maybe I'll just go with the tacos my friend said were delicious or just walk a block to the next place and hope for the best.", "author": "Raul R."}

The normal taco truck outside of MIssions Cliffs had driven away so we ventured up towards Mission St.  We attempted to go to Cha Cha Cha, but that place was too packed.  \n\nThe bright yellow sign of Taqueria Cancun caught my eye.  After checking the previous Yelp reviews on my friends iPhone this looked like a great second choice.  I was impressed by the amount of people eating here.  One of the other things I noticed is that they didn't do a good job at busing the tables.  The Yelp reviews had me all hyped up so I ignored this and  thought, \"the food has got to be good\".\n\nI got in the long line and placed my order in Spanish.  Trust me, I don't sound like a gringo but the guy taking my order almost seemed annoyed that I was speaking Spanish to him.  The next thing I noticed was that the chips that come with your meal were from a bag...sorta stale tasting too.  And instead of a salsa bar they gave you two tiny containers of salsa.\n\nI had three super tacos--the carnitas one had a couple pieces of grissle in it, the al pastor one was so greasy I almost crapped my pants eating it, and the carne asada one had no flavor.  What's so super about one and a half slices of avocado and a mound of sour cream?  And for $3 each?!

My brother typically gets the same burrito with beef, and also raves about the flavor...it's all in the spices. \n\nTheir chips are something to pass on definitely. They seem as though they come out of a bag you would buy at a grocery store for cheap. They are thick, corny, salty...just not good eats. However, anything that is grilled up in their yummy spices and juices are definitely delicious. \n\nFour stars for their cheap, giant, and delectable super burrito.\n\n***Disclaimer: Order the GRILLED CHICKEN (not the pollo)!!!", "author": "Shannon F."}

First, because they grill the tortillas instead of just steaming them like a lot of places do. Second, because they really heap on the avocados. I once watched the guy scoop out an avocado, toss it in there, and then grab another avocado and toss in another half, just because the first avocado wasn't big enough. This is real avocadoness. Cancun is the place for burritos, as in the Super. Even the Super Veggie is good despite being veggie. For tacos I would go elsewhere as they have never heard of a fish taco here. There is usually horchata and a single agua fresca available, e.g. watermelon or cantaloupe, for a good price.\n\nAmbiance? Well, this is the heart of the Mission, and you will get the regular denizens here. There is blaring mariachi or reggaeton from the jukebox, and you sit on these big picnic tables, and truth be told this is not the place to relax and hang out for an hour and chat over a burrito.

Their response is typically - \"crap, I have to eat here again tomorrow.\" Revealed to me by my brother, who used to eat at Cancun all the time in the nineties, I discovered the bliss that is a Cancun burrito in 2003.  Though I know you either love it, or you don't, I fall squarely in the former camp.  The highlights are definitely:\n\n1. Toasted tortillas.  It's so good.  Really.\n2. Tons of avocado in each burrito.  No skimping.\n3. The price tag.\n\nThere's nothing yuppie about the burrito, and you'll find Mexicans and Mission hipsters sitting side by side munching away.\n\nI've also found that their ground beef super tacos are scrumptious as well.  \n\nYou have nothing to lose with this place.

If I had to choose a cuisine to eat for the rest of my life, it would definitely be Mexican.  That said, Taqueria Can-Cun (Yelp forgot the hyphen), Mission location near 20th St.  is da shit.  My favorite burrito of all time, every time, even better than burritos eaten in Mexico.\n\n\"If it ain't broke don't fix it\" applies to my order here.  I've tried other items but I ALWAYS go back to my usual: the super carne asada burrito.  The freshness and quality of the grilled beef can't be overstated.  But the key here, as any fellow burrito porn fan will attest, my friends, is the all-important  PERFECTLY PROPORTIONAL BLENDING OF THE INGREDIENTS.  For this reason, all prospective taqueria owners/cooks should be sent to Taqueria Can-Cun for a mandatory burrito making workshop slash class.  I can't even count the number of times that a perfectly fine burrito experience was nearly ruined by the last few bites being all one thing, usually rice.  Every bite of a Can-Cun burrito is the same due to the skill of the cooks: 100% off the freaking chain.\n\nAll the salsas are good, but the spicy avocado salsa is mind-blowing.  Through 18 years worth of visits, they never give me a hard time about giving me that extra one either, so remember kids, always put at least a buck in that tip jar.  If it's early, I'll have my huge brick o' food with a melon (cantaloupe) agua fresca rather than a beer.  Here in the Reno area, where there are some OK-to-good taquerias (but nothing on the level of the Mission joints), aguas frescas are an endangered species, with the melon agua fresca being extinct.\n\nThe other locations (Market St. and south Mission) are good too, but for some reason don't capture the quality of the one on Mission near 19th.  I'd still give them a solid 4 1/2.\n\nAfterthought #1: people who knock a star off, or complain at all, about a taqueria having stale chips suffer from extreme suck-itis.  They're FREE, PEOPLE!!  With the low price of the food, quit bitching!!   The inexpensive burritos are so gigantic that I've easily made two full meals out of one. Besides, the avocado salsa is so godlike that I could probably manage to keep a dead rat down if I gave it a good dip in the ol' sauce.  Sorry to anybody that read this review on their phone right before/while eating, heh heh heh.  Which brings us to...\n\nAfterthought #2: A good friend visited San Francisco recently and believes she ate at Can-Cun, and saw a roach on the wall.  I hate to even mention this, because I've never had a cleanliness-related issue there.  From her describing the sign, location, and the interior, it sounds like it was the place though.  I guess there have been a couple instances of having to napkin the table down a bit to be safe, but hey the place is always packed with people and there's often a revolving door of homeless hitting you up as you eat, so shit can happen. If this kind of thing revolts you, don't dine in a Mission taqueria and go eat overpriced food in an antiseptic environment instead.  I like the Mission \"atmosphere\" myself.  Once I remember going to get a burrito on Halloween of either 1996-97 @ Can-Cun and being insulted by a group of drunken or otherwise \"lit\"  gangstas on the way in.  As my burrito was being prepared, I watched them shove shopping carts out into the street as the traffic swerved to avoid them.  At that point, I changed my order to \"para llevar\" (to go).

If this makes you uncomfortable, then skip this place.  I don't think it's that big of a deal but I can definitely see a fellow tourist giving this place a bad review just because of the location.

She said that it was really good food at a cheap price so I thought why not? When I came into the Taqueria I had to use the restroom pretty bad so when I got in the restroom I noticed that the toilet paper was being held up by two locks, one a key lock and the other a combination lock. The fist thing that came to mind was \"getto fab!\" I thought it was the funniest thing I have seen all day. What I also noticed about this place is that it was really color full. The celling at ribbons all around, there were beautiful hand pained art work on the walls. There were fresh daisy's everywhere and there was even a real life sculpture of the Virgin Mary on the wall! Now lets talk about the food! I have only been here once and I got the veggie taco which was good and really spicy. When I was about half way done with it, I kind of noticed that it tasted a little bit on the soapy side, I was really hungry so I kept on eating it. I just thought that was a little strange. But It was good, I suppose and for one veggie taco, one diet coke and chips and salsa the price of $3.94 is not that bad at all!! I may go here again when I am in the Mission and I am craving Mexican food. I would give this place a shot if you haven't gone yet.", "author": "Kris O."}

Everything that goes inside one is good eating so it only makes sense that stuffing it all into a big flour tortilla is bound to breed taste success.  But, it is hard to make a GREAT burrito.  Yes, achieving superior burrito technology is no simple feat and unfortunately most taquerias either lack the skill and/or desire to get there.  \n\nThankfully, Taqueria Cancun has gone the extra mile.  It's all in the details.  We're talking freshly cut avocado slices instead of guacamole that might as well be sour cream with green food coloring.  We're talking tortillas that are steamed just right: not overdone so its slimy nor underdone so it has too much bite.  Oh, and of course the MBR (Meat:Bean:Rice) ratio.  Dead on.  \n\nAs many other reviewers have pointed out, Cancun's ambiance doesn't exactly scream luxury nor is the crowd perfectly serene.  But, let's be real, taquerias are about the food.

An thats not stretching it either. The Mission late night is Gnarlssssssss. Bistro and I happened upon the place once back in September but being that I was in a drunken stupor I didnt remember much about the spot other than the grub was FUCKIN AMAZING. Let me repeat FUCKIN AMAZING. i cant tell you how much i was craving for a burritto after that first encounter...well i got my chance this last friday.\n\nThe Bist and I found ourselves on the Haight around closing time and decided to catch a grub at this place, being that i was pretty sober compared to the last time we where there, i knew i would have a better opinion of this place.\n\nWe strolled up after having searched high and low for a parking spot, which almost takes an act of God to do in the City. The spots has one of the loudest decors on earth, your assualted with like a million colors the second you walk in. That and the sound of Mexican beats coming from the juke and the smells of the grill cooking up some marvelles grub.\n\nI went ahead and upgraded my burritto this time to a wet burritto (no racist jokes here people, Im brown and proud beatch!) The carne asada is grilled to perfection and wrap in a store bought flour tortilla with all the trimmings and then the burritto is thrown on the grill once more, for what? dont know dont care. It is then topped off with off with enchilada sauce, melted cheese, pico, crema, and guac. Scarfed that bad boy down in seconds and washed it down with a modelo. damn!!!! The chips and sauce...if you forget to ask for some your playin yourself. top 10 material saucewise.\n\nOh almost forgot to bring up the natives. You get an assortment of characters at this location, there are three, well at night anyways. The thugs, hustlers (me), pimps (me), hippsters (JRNO) and trannys (JRNO) and so on. Shit we got to see some cat hang cuffed, layin on the sidewalk, surronded by cops, in a pool of his own blood! Hows that for realness!!!", "author": "Danny E."}

Super cheap, obviously, and every dish is huge with the option of getting something even huger. The tacos are great: very flavorful, well sized, and fresh ingredients. Burritos seem to be the best here though, but do not underestimate their special plates which are the burritos on a plate, without the tortilla. Every order gets you a basket of chips that is hard to finish and a thing of salsa which makes everything you get better, if that is even possible. Beers are really cheap, as are sodas, and everything else you might want to drink. It is cash only, which may be a downer for some of us, but luckily not much cash is required.

A bit expensive (esp. compared to real tacos in Mexico) @ $2.25/each but they are actually tasty and fill you up pretty good.  Other than the tacos all the other food here is pretty cheap.  I would recommend getting the regular tacos instead of the super.  The super have sour cream and avocado which is good but makes them kinda messy and you don't really need those extras since the regular was good enough.  I also like the super burrito mojado.  Its basically a burrito with melted chesse and salsa on top!  The carne asada here is my fav meat.  Not the best you'll have but good.  They actually have pretty good Mexican breakfast here.  Eggs and ham is my favorite with the Chorizo and eggs a close second for the AM.  Another good thing to try here is the torta with ham or carne asada.  It its great when your not starving since the burritos here are big.  The another dish I like here is the quesadilla suiza (\"Suisse Quesadilla\" but that just menas the quesadilla has meat in it) .  It has the same stuff as a  burrito but with no beans and they cook it with a bunch of chesse.  Watch out for the green salsa!  It is very good but spicy and will catch you off guard if you pour it all over your food!\n\n\nThey have coke in a bottle from Mexico which taste way better than the American can Coke since its made with real sugar.  They also have aguas frescas.  My favorite is horchata.  I actually like the carrot juice they make there, makes you feel a bit healthy after taking down a huge burrito.  The place has meixcan beer from Sol, Corona, Tecate and others.  It is a great place to go after a night at the bars and it is kinda its own scene since its really crowed on late nights in the weekend since its open after 2AM and they'll pretty stay open until the crowds die down.  \n\nThe guys (and it is really only guys) that work there are all pretty cool and hard working.  Most are from Mexico and are into soccer.  So if you wanna get a reaction wear a Club America or Chivas soccer jersey and you'll get a \"cool shirt\" or a \"ah man, you like them?\". But its all in good fun.  They have a great selection of Mexican music from corriods, banda, mariachi, and even some Spanish rock.  I love this place!", "author": "Ivan M."}

Everyone pretty much knows that any food you give a drunk person they will eat and claim it's the best food they have ever eaten. So I was determined to see if I was just wasted or if Taqueria Cancun was the real deal. First time sober I got a Carne Asada Burrito and I was sold.. Second time I got a Chicken Quesadilla and I was blown away. I've eaten at over 30 different Taquerias and this by far was top 3. The next time I went I got a shrimp quesadilla and was amazed. Probably the best quesadilla I've ever eaten and I now only order that when I go. Soo good!! I grew up eating Mexican food since it's a big part of my culture.

Walking in the restaurant looked much less shady than surrounding restaurants with a clean and bright interior.  We walked up to the counter and ordered. My friend got the torta while I went with a trio of tacos, a lengua, a cabeza and my old standby al pastor along with a beer to wash it down.  The food was prepared quickly and we began to scarf it all down.  \n\nThe first thing that I noticed was the there was a substantial amount of meat in each taco with just a sprinkling or onions, cilantro and salsa on your typical small taco sized corn tortilla.  The cabeza and lengua tacos were a little bland but tender.  It could have used some salt in the cooking or maybe a little more lime or salsa.  The pastor however was one of the better pastors that I've had in recent memory. The meat was properly cooked, had tons of flavor and offered a little kick of heat with just the right amount of grease to lube the taco on it's way down.  However, at $2.50 a taco, it's about twice as expensive as a good taco truck taco but I suppose they offer about twice as much meat so it probably evens out.  My friend's torta was really good juicy on the inside and toasty on the outside.  A lot of tortas that I've had don't really heat the bun for you.  I'd also like to try some of their burritos and other dishes as well to see how they compare but all in all a solid effort, espeically with the quality of their pastor.", "author": "Gary L."}

That seems like way too much, especially since i just a had lunch at Super Taqueria in Morgan Hill for 3.15.

I am a vegetarian, so have only had the veggie burrito, but this place is just about worthy of the \"Best Veggie Burrito\" award they promote as their claim to fame. \n\nThere are a couple things that Taqueria Cancun does which sets them apart from the crappier taquerias: (1) They use fresh avocado instead of watered down, imposter guacamole. (2) Their burritos are actually served warm/hot, which is one of the greatest distinctions between the best taquerias and all of the other mediocre bullshit. When you go to Cancun, Farolito, or anywhere else respectable, you won't be getting a burrito that is only room temperature, if not cold. No, the best taquerias actually spend the time to make sure the proper temperature is attained for optimal enjoyment. (3) They offer their burritos \"mojado,\" meaning drowned in enchilada sauce. This is an indulgence only for special occasions. \n\nI am not going to comment on the ambiance, as that is entirely irrelevant. At any taqueria, the burrito/food should be good enough to pull you away from your surroundings. So nonsense like cleanliness or \"Van Halen on the jukebox\" are not legitimate concerns.

I've stuck to just a few basic things each time, the burrito with grilled steak, the super burrito with grilled steak, the veggie, the super veggie, and the tacos.  Right off the bat, I would probably say its a toss-up between this place and El Metate when I'm trying to get a burrito in the mission.  It usually ends up being this place because of its proximity to the 16th St. BART station.  These guys have really, really good burritos with a good combo of things going into them and have a flavor that I have not been able to reproduce at home no matter how hard I've tried.   The best of their stuff is their grilled steak (unless you catch a whiff of bad luck and get some dry stuff that's been on the grill for hours). \n\nThe salsa they've got going is the bomb and goes perfect on top of your burrito.  I always try to get extra salsa and end up finishing it all (both the red and the hotter green).\n\nThis spot as well as the one further down mission near Cesar Chavez serve up the same stuff.  In terms of ambiance, I wouldn't say there's much going on.  They're basically hole-in-the-wall places which can get crowded at times.  I don't mind the Mexican music from the jukebox but would prefer them to lower the volume sometimes so you can hear the dude behind the counter call your number when its ready, but ultimately, this is a place I'd swear by.

It was overpriced, and the food wasn't bursting with flavor as a taqueria food ought to. I will also venture to say, it was too spicy. I normally enjoy food that has good heat to it, but not when it completely masks any other flavors that might be there, and it tastes not of flavorful spice, but of heat, as if someone poured a bottle of Tabasco over my entire plate. I just don't see the attraction of this restaurant.", "author": "Joel W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-04-01", "description": "So, Taqueria Cancun is the perfect place to take out-of-town visitors when you want to give them the \"Mission burrito\" experience.  It is especially the place if your friend prefers Tex-Mex food to pozole and menudo.  Or if he/she likes colorful decor that feels slightly kitschy.\n\nThe carnitas burrito I had was definitely tasty, it just felt a bit contrived to me.  The salsa didn't quite have that \"made with love\" feeling or flavor, and the burrito was on the saltier, greasier side, compared to other burritos I've had.  Hence, the Tex-Mex comparison above.  Real Mexican food (in my experience) is not the least bit greasy, despite the overwhelming amount of good stuff (sour cream, cheese, fried pork, etc.)  Nor is it commercial-tasting.  For me, Taqueria Cancun fell on the commercial-tasting side of the spectrum.  It could just be that I prefer a more simple burrito?\n\nI am not knocking Cancun at all, I think whether you like this place or not depends on what you're looking for.  I would rather frequent El Metate (equally colorful decor!), El Norteno Truck and El Tonayense Truck.  Maybe I just like food from trucks?", "author": "Sarah C."}

My life was saved on many occasions by their tacos and burritos when I was just too moody and introspective to prepare food for myself.

Unlike some of these reviewers I actually lived in the mission so I never had a moment of revelation regarding where I was.  Seriously, people who wanna talk about a mouse, the street clientele, or what it looks like when they're sober should probably stay in the Marina/Hayes Valley/Arizona or wherever they cabbed/drove their Jetta in from.

Its usually the absolute must go destination whenever food cravings come to those that have had a few too many.  Its always an adventure to get here.  Once it was the bart, a few times shoved into a taxi, others times the bus or by the graciousness of our DD.  Sometimes we stumble in from bars in the area but however we get here we are always elated as we walk inside.  The big wood tables, the bright yellow walls, the crazy prints and pictures and lone blacklight.  The mix of homeless people, hipsters, and inebriates makes for entrancing people watching.   It's exactly where you want to be.  You fight your way to a table and go order delicious food.  Then you're set.  You night is made.  Everything is perfect.", "author": "B B."}

The meat in my carnitas super burrito was very bland and for that much fat and guilt wrapped in a enriched white flour tortilla, it should taste damn good. Had it been amazing, I would've easily put the whole thing away, but the fact that I could only get through half of it is not a good sign.", "author": "Cher E."}

Every year or 2 for the last 10 years or so someone drags me back here and I go along because I love burritos - not just Mission burritos but ALL burritos - so much that I can't believe that I don't like them here, and the same thing happens every time. Mediocrity. I give it 2 stars because mediocrity is really easy to acheive in a simple burrito so it's really unforgivable for these guys who've been doing it this long not to be able to serve me a something a little better. And the funny thing is the people I go with tend to say that there's isn't very good that day either, but I think they're trying to make me feel better for being one of the only people in San Francisco who doesn't like Cancun.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-08-29", "description": "I love the burritos at Cancun and have never had a bad experience there, drunk or sober.  However, what keeps me from giving this place more than three stars is the cleanliness of the place.  Were not talking just a one star reduction in cleanliness, but two and that's being gracious.  I can't speak to the bathrooms, since I know better than to use the bathroom in a place like Cancun.  Also, the occasional junkie strolling in hassling people for money is a bit of a turn off and gets tired when dining in the Mission.  The steak super burrito always hits the spot.  The grilled tortilla & steak, the black beans, the avocado, the salsa all come together to make this burrito memorable and enjoyable, no matter if I'm cold stone sober or drop dead drunk.  Also, the tomatillo salsa verde is off the chain as the kids say these days.  Needless to say, when I go to Cancun, I do feel like I'm rolling the dice, since it looks like the health department hasn't stepped in there in a number of years.  If you're not down with the Mission-sit-down-dinner-experience, I would suggest a 'to-go' shot.  The prices on the menu will keep you from wondering what lurks in the back kitchen.", "author": "DamnGringo X."}

I ordered a quesadilla with chicken... it was very good! the skin was crunchy and the cheese was melted just right as its stringy level. My sister ordered a burrito with grilled beef. It came with chips and some very very spicy salsa and dip. Both which are only $5 each. \nOur meal was very enjoyable until I found a strand of hair embedded in my quesadilla, so we quickly brought it back to the cashier. They examined it in disbelief. They were speaking in Spanish amongst themselves. Couple of minutes later, the cashier came over to my table and asked if I wanted the same thing or if I wanted my money back. I didn't care about the money; I only wanted the HALF of my quesadilla back. I told him, but he insisted on giving me a WHOLE quesadilla back. He packed it up to-go for me along with some chips and salsa. When I got it, I tried a piece. Not only was it with beef instead of grilled chicken, but the skin was not made nicely crispy like it was before; it was rather very soggy and seemed as if it wasn't grilled. Before I left, all of the workers behind the counter turned to my table and mumbled more Spanish amongst themselves... hmmm.. I wonder what they said?\nOverall, good food but OK costumer service.", "author": "Dianne I."}
