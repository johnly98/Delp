It was a hop, skip and a jump from my AirBnB and I'm glad it was.\n\nOne of the smaller bars I visited in SF. However, it was the perfect size in my opinion. Not huge, but not tiny. You had enough room so that you weren't rubbing elbows with the person next to you but it didn't feel overwhelming. There wasn't a large crowd of people in there this night. However, you could tell that this was their local watering hole.\n\nThe bartender was great! She poured a nice drink and had a great sense of humor. As soon as we sat down she was chatting with us, cracking jokes and even giving us tips on places to go in the city while we were there. She was just as awesome with everyone else in there and you could tell she's a big reason people were coming in. \n\nThe drinks were good and the prices were even better. We didn't stay long but we enjoyed our time there. Next time I'm back in the neighborhood, I will definitely stumble my way back in for a cold one.", "author": "Zoe F."}

The tourist crowds nearby were too much to bear making us wander a few blocks away before checking for 'nearby' bars on Yelp. We were about a block away and headed over.\nI have to admit, from the outside it looks a bit 'seedy' making me second guess my decision. The inside is a perfect dive bar with a smiling bartender chatting with customers, a couple playing darts in the back, a few folks at the bar drinking beer, watching a game. Laid back perfection.\nThe drink prices were good with a good selection of beers and liquors. Red Sox and Celtic banners adorn the walls. Restrooms are clean and although I didn't look, there seems to be a space 'out back'. The owners, both from 'Mass', moved to and met in, California.

Unlike the Jefferson St restaurant bars, this little joint seems to be a rest stop for those who just clocked out and nearby residents out for some socializing.\n\nNo food here, just booze.  The small bar seats a few on stools and the low top tables with chairs and the former church pew along the wall seat a few more.  I saw one video game, a digital jukebox, a dart board, and a number of TV's (6?) for viewing the current sports broadcast (basketball and football on this evening) - don't get too comfortable, the games switch TV's; makes things moving I suppose.  There's a small patio in the rear with a couple picnic tables.\n\nI liked this place, in part, because of the lack of pomp & circumstance that touristas have come to expect.  It's a clean divey bar.  It was a nice place to sit down, relax, drink a couple, and watch a game.  Order pizza to be delivered, if you're hungry.  It is slightly residential with neighbors living quarters next door on both sides.  Be polite and keep the riot quiet when out front.\n\nService was ok at best.  Ordering at the bar and getting the tenders attention was a task.  He didn't seem to notice peeps waiting to order unless flailing their arms for attention.  \n\nI'll be sure to remember it's here for the next time I'm walking the wharf area and just want to sneak away for a calm beverage.", "author": "John H."}

Redskins bar away from home!  The only one we could find in San Fran.  On a Sunday night game, despite a disappointing Skins season, I was impressed to find so many skins fans at the bar in Burgundy and Gold attire.  \n\n2 stars Ambience:  The ambience is nothing too exciting - your standard American pub with an \"L\" shaped wooden bar parallel to some tables along the length.  We sat at the short side of the bar and there was a bit of a strange but tolerable odor in my corner.   \n\n0 stars and 4 stars (hit or miss) Service:  Our first bartender seemed annoyed we were there, asked what we wanted and walked away (barely anyone at the bar) when we took a 10 second pause to peruse the beer list.  When I asked if there was a food menu, he remarked that they don't have a kitchen and then plopped a big binder of delivery menus in front of us.  We ordered food from a nearby takeout place.  10 minutes later, another bar patron right next to us asked the same question and got a different answer, \"There will be a free hot dog station behind you, but you can order delivery, too.\"    I would have never ordered delivery if I knew that.

Little did I know, though, that this spot was a well-known Boston bar! Arrrrrrgh! Had I known that, I'd have opted to listen to the game with a strung out trucker named Gil over a CB Radio along the dusty roads of Barstow. But hey... I was already there with some good company (meaning the people I came with), so I really had no other option but to stick it out.\n\nThe bar itself wasn't all that bad, but if you're not a fan of Boston sports, you might be pretty annoyed. I guess you have to give credit to those jerks for having relatively good sports teams and being passionate about their city... so I can't knock 'em too hard... but seriously, do you have to be sooooo obnoxious? I mean, they were cursing at The Joker fer Christ sake! There's no reason to bad mouth Jack Nickelson just because he's sitting court side at the Staples Center, right? What about Chris Rock and David Spade?!?! Anyhoo, I digress....\n\nThe bar has some pretty decent drink specials, which made up for the rowdy, potty mouthed fans. Though not reinventing the wheel by any means, tonight was \"Thirsty Thursday,\" which meant we were privy to $3.50 well cocktails for the entire evening. They have a chalk board with the rest of the week's bargains, but I was too busy being sprayed with saliva by a rotund gentleman with a thick accent and a faux-vintage green Celtics shirt from Urban Outfitters to soak it all in. But even though I wasn't able to take notes, I'm willing to bet the incentives would leave me with no option but to return at a later date. \n\nThey threw in some free hot dogs for the entire bar, so that was a pretty nice treat (if you like manufactured meat byproducts, that is) so even if you're a sports fan in the minority, you have to respect the generosity. If you despise Boston sports, however, you may want to wait until all of their teams have the day off. Just sayin'.", "author": "Ruggy J."}

Well I just discovered one the other night. The selfish part of me was reluctant to write this review for fear of letting the secret out..... but since I love you yelpers so much I decided to share. \n\nbecause sharing is caring. and i care.  \n\nOk I lied... a little. I didn't exactly find the Red Jack Saloon myself.... a friend is in town right now visiting from boston and he actually found it. after pre-drinks at michelle's we headed out to fishermans wharf to watch the Sox game. The first thing I said when I walked inside was, \"huh? No f'ing WAY is a bar this perfect in fishermans wharf!\"  \n\nIts certainly not my usual cup of tea..... but i knew i had stumbled upon something really good. Its very low key and you can almost feel the history pouring out of the walls. \n\nThe best feature to me was nice local vibe. Everyone we met knew each other already.... And when we walked in, we instantly became a part of their family. We were there on Wednesday which they call \"Whatever Wednesday\".... Meaning whatever drink the bartender chooses that night (he gave us 3 options) is $3.50 \n\nyes $3.50-- all night long. way CHEAP! I picked the rum. naturally.\n\nThey also have darts.... Or as my boston friend called it \"daahts\".  \n\nThen, there's a jukebox-- YAY! And just when you thought it couldn't get any better.... They have a great little outdoor patio are in back for smokers. The entire back wall is painted like the Green Monster so you feel like you're sitting in Fenway Park.\n\nAnd speaking of cool...... one of the regulars here is a former inmate of Alcatraz. Yes, its true. His name is Darwin Coon and he was an inmate there from 1959 to 1963. yes i asked, he was in for bank robbery. We were trying to get him to tell us some good prison stories but the Sox game was on and we had our priorites...... anyway, he was a nice old guy and when he left I actually gave him a big hug. See what a little rum will do? Here's a great story about him: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2000/08/14/MN88235.DTL\n\nReally, how much more do you need? Red Jack Saloon has \"daahts\", a jukebox, red sox fans, a smoking patio with the green monster, cheap drinks, Alcatraz inmates and a lot of history..... i for one  will be back. in fact, its been awhile since i've done this but....yes i think a little Yelp outing here might be in order. stay tuned", "author": "Michelle I."}

We parked about a half block away and were going to walk to the Pier 39 before returning to the bar to watch the game.  We asked the mechanic next door to Red Jack's Saloon if he thought our car would be safe with a few things visible inside and paddle boards on top.  He said it wouldn't (it wouldn't be in Portland either) but he would move a car he had parked in front of the bar so we could park there... this was the first awesome thing we experienced on this evening.  We parked in front of the bar and asked an employee that was out front if he thought the car would be safe there.  He said it would and that he was the doorman and would watch it for us regardless.  Awesome thing number two.  We went to the pier with our dog and returned for the game.  We were about to put the dog in the car and the doorman told us we could bring her in.  WTF?  Bring a dog into a bar?  This doesn't happen in Portland.  So we brought the dog in and not only did a woman who seemed to be a manager (?) get us a tray table and chairs to sit at because the place was packed for the game, they brought the dog treats and water.  Awesome things numbers three and four.  The staff and the clientele alike were all super friendly... like to the point that we wondered if we were on some type of hidden camera show.  Awesome#five.

Just hit the Red Jack and you'll be pleasantly surprised (and well taken care of).\n\nWe made the mistake of going to a bar on Pier 39 for a beer on Saturday night, just because there weren't many other options we were aware of. After paying over $10 for two Coronas (!!!), I got on my iPhone and looked on Yelp for other options. Turns out The Red Jack was only about three blocks north of the pier and thankfully outside the touristy area. \n\nThe Red Jack has great \"curb appeal,\" as it's located on the ground floor of an old apartment building. Inside, it has lots and lots of charm. We sat right at the bar and were very happy to learn that the beer special of the day was Widmer Hefewiesen draft for $3 a glass!  Being from Portland, where Widmer is brewed, (and which also happens to be one of our favorites) this was indeed a nice surprise. \n\nThe bartender was a very nice young woman who took good care of us. She was friendly and engaged us in conversation throughout the night. The bar has a dartboard, pinball machine, a great Internet enabled jukebox (so you can request just about any song), and a bunch of board games you can take up to the bar (which we did).\n\nAnother nice surprise was the OTHER drink special of the night, which was the house Bloody Mary for $4.25. I'm not a big bloody mary drinker, but this one was really good and quite spicy. I may be hooked.\n\nThe bathrooms were small but clean. They have a nice outside patio with a wall painted to look like Fenway Park's \"Green Monster.\" It was a bit too chilly to sit out there, but it was an appealing space.\n\nUnfortunately, we found out last night that the Red Jack is in danger of closure due to complaints from neighbors about noise.

I don't feel like I can recommend it as someplace you go out of your way for, so the extra star goes for being North Beach and keeping a local-friendly vibe. Also, I got carded. Wait, what? I'm in my 30s... thanks, Mr. Bartender! Unfortunately, I didn't get to meet Mark and Laurie, who I hear are \"flippin cool\".\n\nAlso, they serve my newly-discovered second-favorite porter, Deschutes Black Butte. Heh, I said \"Butte\".", "author": "Paul B."}

You get one or two wandering in from time to time, but not often. This is definetely a neighborhood bar...with a good jukebox, good people (young and old), board games, darts, a back patio and an occasional bar-b-q. \n\nI still stop in even though it is no longer a convenient location for me, just cause I like the vibe.", "author": "Drue C."}

Well, my traveling partner was inspired to do some extra exploring and in the mood for some liquid refreshment  (because it WAS 2 in the afternoon after all). So we put on our brave faces and got ready to set foot inside.\n\nOk, first off, \"People Love Us On Yelp\" sticker=good sign. Ashtray, out front; another good sign. Meet a former Alcatraz inmate and buy his book? Well now we're talking! The flat screen that features random Youtube clips AND Yelp reviews, darts and Red Sox paraphanilia all about, a chalkboard promoting (even more) affordable drinks--all good. \n\n But when I see an establishment that has (a) an Old School standup Pac Man game, (b) the '94 World Cup pinball game (featuring the goalie, the dog and 75 cents gets you 5 balls!), (c) a covered outdoor smoking patio with about 300 ashtrays strewn and (d) sparkling, snappy commentary/ conversation with locals and the bartender, well then you get a place as comfy as my Yelp elite sweatshirt!

The bartenders there are so nice and cool, they know what they are doing, and actually seem to really like their job. The bartenders come in on there nights off.  Everyone there is there to drink and chill and talk.  There are a million board games, wi fi, great music selection on the juke box.  There is a  nice patio in the back too as well. I didnt think i would ever give the five star, but I cant think of a single problem with this bar.", "author": "Mary R."}

I don't know who Jack is or why he was so red that they had to name a bar after him, but that's beside the point.\n\nFinally last Sunday evening, my friend and I decided it was time to see what all of the noise was about.  Upon entering the saloon, Mark (the former owner) greeted us with a very fun, outgoing personality.  He bought us our first drink and maybe more because we drank at least 10 beers between us and the tab came out to $23.  Now THAT, my friends, is what I call economic stimulus!  They also included us in a round of shots, even though we were the only two in the place who didn't know anyone else.  That, my friends, is what I call Bostonian hospitality.\n\nEveryone there was very outgoing and friendly with lots of great saloon personality.  All this and the fact that Darwin Coon, former Alcatraz inmate, frequents this place makes it a must for any passers by or locals.  The regulars are big time darts athletes.  I would have joined their league if I didn't live two hours away.\n\nI would have given it 5 stars if there were more hot chics in there on Sunday night.", "author": "Bob S."}

I really love Red Jacks... but I also think that no normal person frequents the same bar as much as I go to Red Jacks.  I am a woman who loves variety, but when you do theatre and get out of a show at 10:30 pm every Fri/Sat and 4:30 pm on Sunday...sometimes the first thing you want is just a drink.  Red Jacks is great at providing you with strong, cheap drinks and a bag of chips...especially near Pier 39 where everything else is stupid expensive and served in measured pours.  I also love that Red Jacks has the Fun Finder game where you have to find the difference between pictures of 2 naked woman...man, I get stuck in that game quite frequently.  They also have plenty of board games (which I love) and you can order out for pizza whenever.  Why not give it a 5 star rating if I love everything about it, you ask?  Because I am just so damn bored of coming here every Fri/Sat that I am driving myself crazy.  \n\nSo...if you wanna know where to find me...go to Red Jacks every Fri/Sat at 11pm...and I'll be there...again and again...and still getting carded by the same bartender every week too....sigh.", "author": "Jennifer E."}

It's not a glam bar, so if there's anyone reviewing this place that gets all snooty about \"ambiance\" they can kiss it. \n\nEveryone is very nice, the atmosphere is really cozy, relaxed, and fun. Plus, they have games, a dartboard and a jukebox -- so you don't have to worry about a crappy DJ!  Plus plus, the bathrooms are impeccable! No one pees on the seats and there's always enough TP -- even when it's busy.\n\nI've spent my fair share of days and nights (some of which I don't remember very clearly), and have always had a good time. And the bartenders always make sure I get home ok :)\n\nThey even have heart - one of their bartenders fell ill, and they regularly hold fund raisers for the charity they've set up for him! \n\nCome for the Sox (or the Giants), come for the Irish Car Bombs, come for the fun!", "author": "January P."}

Great locals and super friendly staff make for a perfect after work spot to grab a couple of drinks. If you are a Bostonian transplant and need a place to catch up on the Sox or the Pats, this is your spot. They always have the games on and even have a \"Green Monster\" painted on the wall of the patio out back. Of course they are also fans of the local sports scene, and will certainly try to accomodate other fans if there is a game you really want to see. Different drink specials every day during happy hour and they sometimes even have something cooking to take care of the munchies.

My first week at my new job a few people from work invited me to this quaint dive bar.  It  was on that first night that it immediately reminded me of that kind of home-y, \"Cheers-esque\" pub where the bartender always remembers your name and your drink and serves it with the same warmth and welcoming smile as they did on the very first visit.  While Nicole is usually the one that keeps the Stellas coming, Nick and Mike are equally as friendly with all the patrons, whether they're working or just enjoying a brew like the rest of us.  These people, their friendliness and off-the-cuff humor made my boyfriend and I instantly fall in love with this place.  My only qualm would be that this is a Red Sox bar, being a native New Yorker...well you can understand. : ) However...These are West Coast Sox fans, no offense Red Jacks, that just means we can forgive each other for our baseball teams and drink together in harmony.  \n\nThis is so far the best place for an uncomplicated after work adult beverage where you can relax play Jenga, sing along to Journey on the Juke Box and meet the kind of down to earth people you feel like you've known your whole life.
