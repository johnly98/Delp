Swanky, rustic vibes with a beautiful interior, I'd definitely come here if you're in the mood for drinks on a fun date night or a casual get together with friends!\n\nI overall just love the atmosphere of Holy Water. Friendly and easily approachable, but also laid back and chill. I came in with the intentions of ordering a Painkiller, but either it wasn't being offered anymore/it was seasonal/off the menu, so I was sad that I unfortunately couldn't try it.\n\nAfter the Gold Rush ($13) (Boubon, Pineapple Gum, Apricot Brandy, Lime) Good, and I can see why it's a popular drink here. However I felt that I tasted more of the bourbon and not a lot of the accents of Apricot Brandy or pineapple gum. Still a pretty good drink and a recommend!\n\nZombie ($16) (Blend of rums, Citruses, Tropical flavors & apparently death in a glass) Definitely for someone who's feeling more bootsy. I overall really liked this drink, and it definitely was a strong one. The description really doesn't lie, it was definitely a strong drink. \n\nTo be honest my favorite part about Holy Water was just how beautiful the ceiling was. I couldn't help but stare at how beautiful the ocean water ceiling was, adorned with the hanging lights. The tables are also candlelit, and the bar stool seats tie in with the rest of the rustic, wooden interior, with the fun accent pops of the wooden barrels.\n\nThe bathroom was also really clean, so that was a plus. There's also 2 TV's here as well so when there's a game it's really nice to chill. \n\nThe only minor downsides are that it's a bit loud, though I don't mind that too much, and also I wish their website would list a menu of what kind of drinks they offer. The only reference I had for drinks were the photos other people took on Yelp, most with dim lighting so it'd be helpful to see a more clear menu somewhere else.\n\nI'd give Holy Water a 4.5. The main highlights of this bar for me were how beautiful the ceiling is, and the drinks are pretty good too. Definitely a laid back, chill bar I'd go to again!", "author": "Allison O."}

(I believe a few of us have had this place bookmarked for some time. If not, I know I did at least.) We stopped by on Saturday, March 10th around 5:30pm. There wes a decent amount of people here, but we still managed to find three or four seats at the bar.\n\n*Frisco Sour: bourbon, benedictine, lemon, bitters ($12)\n*Bourbon Breakfast: bourbon, allspice dram, heavy cream, maple ($12)\n*La Paloma: tequila, lime, sugar, grapefruit soda, salt ($12)\n*Black Manhattan: bourbon, averna, bitters ($12)\n*Vieux Carre: rye, cognac, benedictine, vermouth, bitters ($12)\n\nI have no idea how much each round cost, but I'm listing the menu prices above. The menu does state that happy hour is 4pm-7pm, so if it applies to Saturdays, each cocktail should have been $9 instead, which is a great deal! I started with the frisco sour as I needed something lighter after all the bubbly and beer I drank earlier. It was a good twist on a pisco sour. Next up was the bourbon breakfast. A friend had ordered it first, but I found it too sweet, so I asked the bartender to make mine less sweet. This worked out well as I do love my boozy coffee. For the third drink, I ended up with the paloma as the bartender said a friend ordered it. He had a bit too much to drink that day, so I just took it instead of sending it back. I believe in addition to all the drinks listed, someone also ordered an old fashioned? I'm not sure what it was, but there is a misplaced drink in my pix.\n\nFun bar for our last stop down Cortland Avenue. Great HH specials with $5 beers, $7 wines, and $9 cocktails.", "author": "Elena N."}

Really, that just about sums it up.\n\nOK, some deets. We got in before Saturday night SF bar prime time, so street parking was pretty easy & available seating at the bar & tables was about 1/2 full. We grabbed the table in the back corner nearest the restrooms & had a cool time chilling & conversing.\n\nThe bartenders were friendly, attentive, & efficient. Even after it started getting more busy as the night wore on. Holy Water is definitely more of a fancy cocktail bar, but (being a beer guy) I found the beer selection on their 8 taps to be respectable.\n\nIt's dark inside, but not too dark. Ambiance is undeniably hipster, but there wasn't such a profusion of ironic moustaches, bowler hats, or anything steampunk amongst the clientele that I felt the immediate need to vomit up my dinner.\n\nWe all had a couple rounds & it was a nice spot to hang out.

The interior is sure to have sparked many an Instagram sesh spent agonising over which filter and what hashtag(s?!) to use. The cocktails, and their nomenclature to boot, look equally impressive. \n\nMy siblings and I came on a Sunday afternoon, and, unfortunately, my sister and I were under the distinct impression that we were going to a coffee shop. I'll pretend that my coffee shop outfit, actual (not e) book included, is not what drove the bartender to card me (nor will I pretend that I didn't delight in not looking noticeably older than my baby-faced sister). The fabulous interiors definitely are not conducive to reading a book (unless you want everyone to hate you as you wield your phone's flashlight). Our second faux pas was in ordering a glass of wine, off the relatively short wine list. It retrospect, when a place has an A4 sized cocktail list and a half-PostIt sized wine list, it is probably best to order a cocktail. \n\nHad I better exercised my ability to read and pre-searched Holy Water, I'd have told myself to go for the cocktails.

From the Churchill and Bloodhound folks, comes the best neighborhood bar I've been to. It's a bit of SoMa and The Mission rolled into one sans the horrible parking and [sometimes] pretentious yupsters. \n\nIt's very chill and low key with a mixed crowd.  Not a place to rage but to enjoy a good drink with good company. \n\nYou can grab a seat at the bar or come with a group of friends to hang out at one of their communal tables. There's flat screen TVs to watch the game. You can even bring your dog with you (there were 2 that night). \n\nAll is welcome at Holy Water and that's how the staff makes you feel. They're the nicest bar staff I've encountered. \n\nOn the menu are 10 artisan cocktails ($9), 8 draft beers ($5-6), 15 bottled beers ($3-8) and 3 wines ($7-8). CC's accepted. \n\nFor all you fernet lovers, Holy Water has a handful of different varieties unlike other bars that only have one: Fernet Branca. \n\nI've cut down on my drinking these days but we had just come from a banquet filled with [free] booze so I needed a \"night cap\". Ok, two. \n\nThe Holy Gimlet ($9) was well balanced with Hendricks, lemon and cucumber. Not syrupy sweet which I liked. I couldn't leave without some pre-hangover prevention so a shot of Mexican Fernet neat ($7) it was--thank you, Adrian for the recommendation.\n\nI've never heard of Mexican Fernet so I did some digging. Apparently, it was discovered early this year at a dive bar in Guadalajara. They use the Mexican Fernet in a cocktail called \"Pink Testicles\". \n\nPink balls ehhhh?

So they were heading outside and then one of them vomited outside. She went outside and made a comment requesting for them to pay 5% tip for vomiting and claiming she can ask for that. She also accused him of vomiting in the bathroom, which he did not even do. They tried to talk to her and she just ignored them and didn't want to discuss it. The other two bartenders went outside and told them they weren't welcome to the bar anymore. So they left. While I was inside with my other group of friends, the same waitress came back to our table and started clearing our drinks without asking. She was even grabbing a completely full new drink to take away. We weren't even loud or being obnoxious at our table. We were just sitting there, enjoying our time talking.

However, after the majority of my extended party left, and we few, strong, seasoned g-hards remained, it was a very nice time.

There is this right amount of light that accommodates romantic dates or just a group of friends. The shelfs are gorgeous. Those doors in the back with \"NO\" signs gives me the chuckle when I take care of my business. It's not pretentious, nor is it too humble. It's modern but also timeless. It's just cool.\n\nBartenders are pretty cool, too. I've seen Max most of the time because he works on my Friday. Super chill dude, and he knows his stuff.

It's great for what it is and I would definitely return if I was with a friend or two from out of town who I needed to catch up with, but it's a pretty chill place which isn't what I'm usually looking for on my weekends.\n\nIt seems like their cocktail specialties are bourbon based which, again, is not my cup of tea, but my bourbon connoisseur friends vouched for the quality of the drinks. And they were surprisingly cheap ($9) for the time and care that went into making them. If you don't like bourbon, they have a (I wanna say) lime gimlet that is really tasty. It was a hit with everyone in my group of about 14 who tried it.\n\nAside from the fact that it was hotter than Satan's butthole in there, the play was nice and spacious. Plenty of tables to snag if you're with a group. But again, if you're looking for a more upbeat scene or if you want to bar hop, this isn't the place for you (at least not for those particular activities).

That's \"Bernal Hill Bar Family,\" just in case you didn't know (I just made it up...make it happen). A seemingly sparse crowd, we easily found seats at the bar. Initially I was put off. Reasoning being that Bernal Hill is so quaint and charming. Holy Water feels slightly out of place. I felt like I was in the likes of Churchill/Brass Tacks/any other new SF bar. After a quick talk with the bartender, it appears this new spot is from the same exact masterminds. \n\nBut stepping down from my preservationist soap box, I think Holy Water is fine. Am I upset mine and my date's cocktail was closer to the double-digit price range each? Yes. But am I thrilled they offered some bitchin' crusted almonds from a local vendor. Hells yes. They were ridic good. That said, the bartenders and co-owner who was in house were real nice. Talked us up. It was sweet. I felt like it was a hybrid of typical new gentrified bar that felt like a local watering hole.\n\nNot gonna lie, I was sort of into it. With this place within walking distance to my bed. I can already forecast my drunken-stumble from there to home. It'll be a great spot to bring visitors to my neighborhood who wants to \"grab a drink...you know, somewhere fun and nice.\"", "author": "Jon C."}

You get $1 off signature drinks like After the Gold Rush: Old Grandad Whiskey with pineapple, apricot and a lime twist. It was one of the best drinks I've ever had.\n\nThe crowd seems to be mainly locals, which I loved. The vibe is really chill and the air is filled with the sound of conversation rather than loud music. And the bartenders are friendly and masterful at their crafts.

This place is definitely on the radar for an encore trip. I love a place that surprises u with unique options & especially drinks, which score a 4 out of 5 with me. The 4 being that no one person should handle a bar alone it creates the oh c'mon hurry it up affect. The people were decent no fights, and the bartender created a drink for me at my request called the suicide. Try it! I dare you to drink it with a straw LOL! To everyone, remember drink responsibly, and always call a taxi or a friend after you have consumed more than the law recommends.", "author": "David T."}

I wish the ambiance and seating were warmer and more comfortable, respectively, but it's still a decent place to spend an hour to unwind, sampling their good beer selections or cocktails. Ask for Mike and use his expertise to choose an appropriate cocktail. Mike is wonderful, talented, humble and kind, but we also had another bartender who was rude and obnoxious, but that doesn't appear to be the norm. Try it out and have fun in Bernal.", "author": "R L."}

Definitely look up & admire the Japanese block print wallpaper on the ceiling. lighting & artwork make for great conversation.\n\nJust opened so if wasn't crowded but I'm sure that will change :-)", "author": "Amy B."}

We don't spend too much time over there but now we have a reason to leave our hood and head over. Great drinks and really nice staff.

The spiritual rebirth of Stray is complete.  The sanctuary and sacraments are truly born again.  The bartender (Cora?) was transcendentally charming and attentive (and I am not used to such attention as I am 25-30 years older than the typical patron at these kind of places). Yea, though I walked home through the valley of the shadow of death, the mescal cocktail I had delivered me from evil and restored my soul.  I will come here again and again.", "author": "John T."}

It's low-key, and it doesn't have any of the pomp of other places with a similar repertoire of cocktails on offer. The prices are reasonable, the service friendly, the bathrooms clean, and the space is nice. And it still allows dogs and shows the games when they're on. I think it's a great addition to the neighborhood.", "author": "ashley h."}
