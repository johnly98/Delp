It's 10 more minutes walking from my place than Bar Basic, but I'm sure Oz (our husky puppy) appreciates the extra exercise. I should, too.\n\nI've never been to a bar where the customers loved Oz so much. It was adorable, and it warms my heart to meet other dog lovers. It was pretty crowded when my friend and I arrived around 5:00 PM but we found places to stand at the end of the bar by the pool table. \n\nAt first, we tied Oz to the pipe underneath the bar, then we let him roam around when we saw he didn't cause too much trouble. Unfortunately he ran out the door at one point and almost into the street, so we'll be way more careful next time. Yikes!\n\nAnyways, the drinks here are great, from cocktails to beers. The vibe is laid-back, the bartenders are super friendly, and there's a good rotation of customers so you'll usually find somewhere to sit eventually. And there's a pool table with a good amount of space around the edge so no one gets impaled by a cue stick.\n\nI'd love to come back again in the future and hope we meet other dog (and human) friends!

Today, at bloodhound, I asked for the name of the manager of the bar and the bouncer, along with his buddies (one a bartender at the bar) loudly chanted (in my face) for 5 minutes, \"his name is John FUCK YOU.\"\n\nSo, if you want to go to a bar that would utterly disrespect you for giving a \"weird look\", go check out this one!\n\nThe only reason to go to this bar is to wait for the line to die down next door at Raven.  I was really excited to check out this bar with a group of 5 sober people (meaning did not drink at all before) and was turned away at the door for being \"disrespectful\". I understand that bouncers have all the power to turn people away with reasonable cause but I've never experienced this sense of discrimination and utter condemnation.  I was in such disbelief as to why the bouncer refused to let my friend in so I asked for an explanation.\n\nThe bouncer, word for word, told me that my friend simply, \"gave him a weird look\", at which point a bartender and third person, who was chatting with the bouncer, decided to verbally assault me outside of bar. \n\nI highly doubt that it is reason enough for a bouncer to rudely and loudly degrade a person by raising their voice and prohibiting them to enter a bar because he/she felt the person trying to get in \"gave them a weird look\". Additionally, it is not okay that the bouncer continued to verbally attack me and allow the friends of the bouncer to abuse and assault people he turned away from the door. \n\nAfter viewing the negative comments about this place, it is not surprising that I received this response from this bar.", "author": "Janet H."}

Trendy and ironic and tech people with a ton of excess money to spend. \n\nWe came for a pop up dinner event so it was extra crowded but even after the even closed up the place got more crowded. There were a lot of people with backpacks loaded with clothes and computers coming from work in the area. A lot of work meetups and happy hours as well as some first dates and social gatherings. It was super busy but kind of comforting to be around a ton of 25-40 year olds who had their own things going on and were actually really nice. \n\nThe bar is super clean and the aesthetic is undefinable which I have kind of gotten used to in SF. Its like local edition but not underground which is a great thing actually. The lighting is really hazy here but its great to be able to step outside if you want to.

Big Game Hunter in one corner, mounted deer/moose head in the back, pool table, and crowds of hipsters all amplify this effect greatly, for better or for worse. The only thing that ends up feeling a little out of place are the nice sectional couches that line the windows towards the front, but they're comfortable enough that I can't really complain, especially given the lack of low, accessible seating otherwise.\n\nThe majority of their drinks are served up in mason jars of varying sizes, which is kind of kitschy, but neat nonetheless. And with most priced at under $10, they're right around the same price point as equally enjoyable Rickhouse. Having tried the Recoil (Bulleit bourbon, St Germaine, lime, and ginger beer) and New Fashioned, I can highly recommend both - and the rest of their drinks are probably pretty good bets too.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - With a very spacious interior, people shouldn't encounter any problems getting in or around the lounge. The bar is, of course, standard bar height, but the end furthest from the entrance is actually standard table height, should you need to garner a bartender's attention.\n\nBathroom - Semi-private men's bathroom. I say semi-private because it's a single room with two urinals and a toilet, but there's no lock on the door, so... use at your discretion, or have a friend stand watch outside. Otherwise accessible, though those with wider wheelchairs may have trouble getting inside due to the side privacy panel of the urinal closest to the door.", "author": "Johnny W."}

My most recent one was so bad, I left in tears.\n\nMy friends and I were at Raven next door. One incredibly intoxicated friend disappeared from the bar and wasn't answering his phone. He is from out of town and doesn't know his way around the city. It was pouring rain. Figuring that he may have ducked into Bloodhound, I headed over there.\n\nNow, I'm a pretty polite person. So I asked the bouncer, \"Excuse me. I'm looking for a friend who is lost. Do you mind if I check if he's here?\"\n\nBouncer: \"No, we're closing.\" \n\nHe then proceeded to violently push an intoxicated man out the door (no clue about the man's previous behavior or if the push was justified, but at the time the man hadn't done or said anything)---directly into a girl. Yes, he violently pushed someone into an innocent bystander. The girl was struck in the face and was very upset. The bouncer apologized to the girl, said \"stay out!\" to the guy, then turned to me and physically removed me from the door frame (didn't ask me to leave, just strong armed me out the door.)\n\nMe: \"Sorry, do you mind if I just scan the room? He is very drunk, from out of town. I'm just trying to find him.\"\n\nBouncer: \"It's not my f****** fault you lost your f******  friend. That's your f****** fault. Now get out.\"\n\n...............\n\nCompletely uncalled for. I was sober. I was polite. I wasn't disorderly. It wasn't after closing, but a few minutes before and my request to scan the room would have taken all of about 30 seconds. People were still seated, enjoying drinks. There was no reason for his atrocious behavior. I've since tried calling the bar to speak with a manager four times. Each time the phone rings and rings and never reaches a voicemail or a person on the other line.\n\nHorribly unprofessional and I won't be back.", "author": "Marcella D."}

This should be an item on everyone's bar-hopping list.\n\nThe highlight of my experience here was this. When I was getting ready to hop to the next bar, this Asian guy outside named Petey said something along the lines of, \"you guys can't leave, we're going to take a shot right now.\" We all walked back into the bar, he threw down his jacket, and began to barback to earn 6 shots of tequila. Apparently he works with the bartender at another bar and he was helping him run the show for a little bit to get the shots for free. We found a table while he was doing his thing and 10 minutes later Petey brought us 6 shots on the house--made possible by his hard work of picking up glasses and stocking shelves. We hung around for another 30 minutes talking about the rigors of life and New Years Eve. This was a moment where a nice person did a nice thing. This man deserves a good break in life.\n\nAt any rate, this is probably now one of my favorite dive bars to hang around in SOMA. That night, we ate at The Chieftain Irish Pub, went to the Tempest Bar (another awesome dive bar), then spent most of the night at Bloodhound. This was a fun battle plan that night.

I was there last Saturday night with a few of my buddies and it was filled with a pretty mixed crowd. You get everyone from hipsters to wannabe Hollywood types, hippies, nerds, geeks, preppies, etc. I love going to place with a diverse crowd because I enjoy people watching and, well, I just love people! I'm kind of chatter box around strangers. Yeah, I'm that guy who walks up to everyone and strikes up a conversation. \n\nThe decor is pretty cool. It has, what I call, a hipster gothy cabin look to it. Really dim with hanging antler chandeliers, a long bar that looks like it's made out of old barn wood, a ton of communal tables and a pool table in the back. The bartenders are cool and they pour their drinks pretty heavy, which is something I appreciate - anything to get me closer to blacking out. \n\nOverall, I'm a fan of Bloodhound. It's mellow but has an upbeat vibe at the same time. It's a great place to grab a drink with a big group of friends.", "author": "Bruce C."}

Because SF is not a laid back city.  Sorry, it's just not. \n\n4. Good beer on tap. Not the best tap selection in the world, mind you, but good enough.\n\n5. Buck Hunter. No, I'm not going to claim that Buck Hunter is a Portland thing... it's a hipster thing. But Portland is disproportionately full of hipsters, so many of which are vegetarian.

I still haven't worked up the nerve to try the Big Buck Hunter, but that day will come. I've had the Recoil twice now. With it's mix of Bulleit Bourbon, St. Germain, ginger beer and lime, it has everything a girl needs to happily imbibe. For something else along those lines that will put a bit of hair on your chest (or add some pep to your step), go for the New Fashioned. It replaces the traditional sugar cube/simple syrup in an Old Fashioned with maple syrup. Somehow, this simple switch really elevates the flavor from the orange peel. If bourbon just isn't your thing, the Turf Cocktail has enough gin to really get your buzz on. The tiny sip I had of my friend's drink was plenty for me. The bartenders are really efficient and friendly and the bouncer complimented my dress. What's not to love?", "author": "Nicole M."}

That's the only reason this isn't five stars, because Bloodhound is one of the best bars in my backyard. Any place can have a bar, but what separates great bars from the rest are the people they attract, and damn if Bloodhound doesn't attract some of the best in the city. \n\nI'm new in town, so that means a lot of bar-crawling alone and I've been offered cupcakes, been swapping travel stories - even had someone I'd never met stop me as I left to give me her phone number. The bartenders are chatty and know all the regulars, and they can mix up a great cocktail (their Sazerac is my favorite) when your favorite beer disappears from the taps. This is a great first or last stop on your night out, to shoot some pool, chat up some new people, and Da Beef is just down the street for some great Chicago dogs late into the night.", "author": "Kevin B."}

On Thursdays, a few guys set up shop out front with a kiln and cook overpriced mini pizzas. There is also a girl dressed as Alice who occasionally walks around the bar and sells cookies (note: family friendly cookies).

Their specialty drinks are mighty tasty, but they also have a good inventory of beers on tap. \n\nI haven't been here on a weekend, but it's definitely a cool place to hang during the week.  It's spacious with lots of seating, so it works well if you have a large group.  Best of all, they serve no pesky food to get in the way of your buzz.  You can soak up the alcohol later at Extreme Pizza, which is only a block away.  Alternatively, The Cat Club is in the same block, so you can go dance it off if your timing is right!\n\nI guess the only drawback for me is that their Happy Hour could be a little bit happier ($1 off a $9 cocktail isn't really much of a discount).\n\nP.S.

I was waiting at the bar VERY patiently for about 20 minutes. He had served so many people that came up after me and then FINALLY he asked me what I wanted and I ordered a vodka and soda. Then he yelled \"is that it!? That's all you want to order after you looked like you were waiting SO impatiently!?!? Are you sure you're not going to order something else after I give you this drink?!\" I was Sooooo appalled and so shocked at how rude he was. I've never experienced this kind of service before from a bartender especially being a girl and seriously waiting 20 minutes for a drink.  Even though I liked everything else about this place I don't think I'll ever come back because of that one bartender (the darker haired one. The other one was nice).

I suppose if I had the time and will I'd be scouring the calendar more often but work keeps getting in the way. When I found out one of the old school Yelpers was leaving the area, I made it to Bloodhound for the rendezvous. On a Sat night this place is packed to the gills. I had to wait outside for a few minutes, though the door man was cool. Going inside, the rustic bar with a number of hard working bartenders were scurrying around while, tons of young drinkers clamored to get around. \n\nRunning into various Yelpers I'd not seen in years, it was like an event back in the old days. I sidled up to the bar and deciding that I didn't want to get back into the crush of things again, I double fisted with a Recoil and Ward 8. Both Bourbon based drinks, they hit the spot as I made my way back to the group. \n\nI can't count the number of times I was bumped into, elbowed, pushed what not. It's like college had just let out or something. I figure this place makes a much better weeknight bar than weekend but the people watching was interesting. Drinks are solid, though I wish I had free will to punch each jerk off that just showed zero respect for anyone as they made their way through the crowds.", "author": "Kim N."}

It's divey, but not too divey, but it's not one of those bars that's nothing remotely like a dive, but thinks it would be \"cool\" if it's dive so it tries too hard (does that make any sense?). It's just an overall laid-back atmosphere. The decor is pretty cool (the ducks on the ceiling are a plus) and I really like the whole \"rustic\" feel.\" \n\nThey have a great beer selection and I love the fact they serve them in mason jars! For no good reason really I've never tried any of the specialty drinks here even though they all sound delicious (I'm also a big fan of Hanger vodka, which they have). \n\nAnother big plus about this place is that despite what you would think might be a tough area for parking, it's actually pretty easy (I've only been here on weekdays when I got off at work and since I don't live or work in the area that's a big plus to meeting up here). \n\nI think if I actually lived closer to Bloodhound (or even came to SOMA more often than I do) this would be a regular stop of mine, and would inch up closer to five star territory.

I'm usually an old-fashioned girl and definitely enjoyed their \"New Fashioned\" with maple simple syrup, but the bourbon cocktail with ginger beer and elderflower liqueur was one of the best drinks I've ever had, hands down.\n\nThey had a DJ spinning vinyl (on a Tuesday night!), which was awesome, but it still kept a very chill vibe.

To be honest and true to my review I even went in... Alone! \n\nI've always been impressed with Bloodhound. It was opened not too too long ago by a couple guys from Double Dutch and Ambassador. The name Bloodhound is originally an alias for the St Hubert (or Sleuthhound) dog. Though it is doubtful that that fact is why they allow K9 pets to roam as free about the floors of the bar as the beautifully painted black doves artistically appear to be doing across and around the ceiling. Bloodhound dogs were bred to to help hunters track deer and were rather homily pups quite honestly.\n\nBloodhound bar, unlike its namesake, is gorgeous. Repurposed wood panels the wall, paintings of bears and antler chandiliers are included in the decorations. The look is hunting lodge chic. There are high top wooden tables, bar stools, and comfy couches placed strategically near the front of the venue to take pressure off the bar itself.. But my favorite outside the dove colored ceiling is the lighting. The antler chandilier is very hip, but look again. The light bulb chandiliers (over the hightops) are too cool. I want them. And even the track lighting over the bar is both artistic and original.\n\nThe $9 coctail list is creative, not a renaming of the same cocktails every other bar serves but Bloohound originals with names like the Ricky Ricardo, the Recoil, Jack Rose, and of course, the Bloodhound- imagine that! Beers will run you @ $5-$7 but they are nice enough to list the alcohol percentage right next to the name. \n\nAfter purchasing a Daq 1515, I picked a corner to observe from, wanting not only to check out the video game \"Big Buck Hunter\" (an awesome shooting game) but what kinda tunes were on the juke box (it was turned off for the night but it looks like a blend of bar favorites). I looked out over a sea of mason jars (in 2 sizes), martini glasses (specialty cocktails), and wine glasses (primarily containing extra strength beer) and realized how much more I loved Bloodhound after my mandatory Friday night visit. The crowd was more- well for lack of a bettert word- real than i'd seen on a Friday night in a SF watering hole in, well too long. There really was a bit of everyone. Every where you looked were flip flops and jeans. The ladies had on casual make up and down played hair. The men's pants were neither too big, nor too small. And it even looked like someone took a handful of UC Berkley boys and dropped them in for artistic flavor. My favorite foursome were the 21 years old girls -feigning nonchalance in a bar full of late 20's and 30 somethings. It was impossible to tell who was hip, who was professional, and who was on the prowl (except the 21 year olds of course). It was comfortable. And that C word I almost never use. I actually believe if Toby Keith's famous \"I Love This Bar\" had begun playing at 1:30 am Sat morning, that if by the 2nd verse, after the left right looks to see how all the other patrons were reacting were done, this crowd would've known the words and sung them proud.\n\nWell I know one thing for sure... \"I Love this Bar\"!\n\nPs the male bartender was impressive- to say the least. And the female. I think Genuwine wrote a song about her that had a line \"Is there any more room for me, in those jeans\".

Bloodhound is a bit unique in that it's decorated like a hunting lodge -- think gun ranks & antlers. I was skeptical at first, but happy I gave it a shot because the cocktails are excellent!\n\nMany of their libations are whiskey-based, but there also tend to be several tasty non-whiskey options as well. Try the Jack Rose or the Ward 8! If you're not a cocktail person (gasp), they also tend to have pretty decent beer on tap as well, and a pretty good selection of higher-end whiskey (& some other stuff) for sipping on.\n\nCocktails run the SF standard $9-10 each. I do like that there is some non-bar seating (a few vinyl couches & tables scattered around the far side of the bar), and I've always had great service. My only beef is the noise level -- the place can get REALLY loud if it's at all crowded, to the point where you sometimes have to yell so that the person ten inches away can hear you.

I was meeting some colleagues for an after work happy hour and this place does not exactly strike me as a place professionals go after a long day of work. It is pretty dim lighting and has relatively limited seating with no waiter service. My rating is biased because I was not anticipating this type of setting based on what I was originally told. I would probably go back for a Friday or Saturday night and have a good time but not an after work place for me. \n\nOne redeeming aspect of Bloodhound is the fact they offer Olympia beer.

But after careful bullet-point consideration I can't think of a single thing I don't like about this bar.\n\nLet's start with the most important thing about a bar, the drinks: They are good! They have a specialty drink list that is tasty and seems to be ever changing. I'm a whiskey guy and while their selection isn't the most extensive it has some quality hooch on board.\n\nPrices: It is quite reasonable. I was there with a group of friends and it was something like $30 for 5 drinks. And that included one or two higher priced premium drinks.\n\nService: The really cool thing about this place is that the bartenders (some are the owners) are REALLY nice! I can't stand when I go to a bar, Ahem Pink Elephant San Diego, and the people who work there are just assholes! These guys and gals are awesome!\n\nAmbiance: The crowd is definitely not the green as the valley 21 year olds that trash a place and puke outside. Classy people in their mid-late 20's all the way to late 30's but honestly diverse, mellow and polite. The taxidermy aesthetic is warm but original and lends itself to the hunters' lodges and workmen's bars of the Ozarks but with a pristine and fresh twist.\n\nFood: They don't serve any but there is usually a food truck out front, pizza is close by and there is a newly anointed bacon-wrapped hotdog stand out front.

The bar is shockingly clean, but avoids feeling sterile because of the wooden, country-ish decor.  Drawbacks are that the drinks are pricey, and that it's out of the way for where I live in Russian Hill.  Being that this is more of a \"have a drink with the lads\" joint, I feel like this bar would be better located in a place like Polk Street or Hayes Valley, but I guess SOMA needs a normal bar too.\n\nThe big bartender guy is really knowledgeable, but if you catch him at the wrong moment can be a little impatient and snappy.  Nonetheless, you will get what you order, and it will be well-poured.  I highly recommend the buttered rum for colder evenings!  It is truly delicious, and you can say that you've actually tried that noble and classic drink, The Buttered Rum.  It's kind of like drinking warm and tasty egg nog.\n\nThe door is always open here, in a literal sense, so dress warm (or enjoy them buttered rums).\n\nPool and other game machines toward the back where they belong, and the men's room is really clean.", "author": "Dmytro A."}

The bartender was very attentive, informative and friendly. \n\nMy friend eventually arrived and we moved to the cool bar height tables by the window.  The ambiance is great as they had plenty of seating, pool tables and interesting decor.  It seems even if this place gets super packed you can still have room to get around.  \n\nWe had a couple rounds and I was pleased to see they use fresh ingredients and loved the mason jars used for the beer!\n\nGlad I was introduced to the place and look forward to coming back with more friends!", "author": "Kim T."}

Pretty straightforward bar with high quality bourbon and spirits, a few meaty salty snacks consisting of Whisky Sticks from The Fatted Calf and Chicharrones from Ryan Farr's 4505 meats and a nice open feel to it, unless it's packed like it typically is wed.-sat. This bar has tons of open space, some cozy high-back chairs and 2 couches you could get lost in on a cold sunday afternoon while the rain beats down outside. \n\nIf you're looking for sporting, as any good hunting club should offer, there are 2-3 flat panel TVs that are tuned to sports, a nice pool table in back with plenty of shooting space and, of course, what's quickly becoming the new 'Golden Tee' for modern bars, the video game 'Big Game Hunter' where you can show off your marksmanship skills and take down an electronic deer or two.\n\nBloodhound features some 'whole pig' and other special cooking events from local butchers and chefs and I'm told that San Francisco's Bull Moose Hunting Club meets here the first tuesday of each month for socializing and planning hunting outings.", "author": "Derek D."}

I'll definitely be coming back.\n\nThe things I love about Bloodhound:\n\nAwesome hunting lodge decor - I almost felt it should've been in Disneyland's Frontier Land.  But it was just short of being kitschy which made it perfect\n\nBeer in mason jars - Very unique...and what a great selection of beer they had!  But I wondered if the mason jars were to distract us from the fact that you're still paying $5 for a beer but not quite getting a pint?  At least that's how it seemed to me.\n\nJukebox - Awesome selection of music.  Thanks to Andrei Z, we had a great time picking out songs and playing \"name that artist\" (or drink) whilst doing so.\n\nPool table/duck hunt - I love having entertainment in a bar....also played in to the lodge feel.\n\nThis place is open with a lot of windows (which provided much entertainment through the night...naked man, man brushing his teeth, women walking a pygmie goat on a leash).  Just across from Terroir, you can do wine one night and beer the next.  \n\nI'll definitely be back for more Bloodhound....", "author": "Melanie N."}

We arrived yesterday promptly at 3:43pm after our SF Food Bank volunteer event via @Boobs4Food. We were thirsty. Very thirsty. Since the doors weren't open, we went to the liquor store on the next block and downed a couple beers to quench our thirst. Point being, they open at 4pm. If you arrive earlier, you know where to go. \n\n2. Quality environment that makes you want to stay all afternoon - I love the decor, the painted birds on the ceiling, all the Hunting theme mumbojumbo. The excellent longbar with tons of comfy barstools.\n\n3. The Bartenders - they know their stuff and they make great drinks. Whether you want beer or liquor - they pretty much have it all. I tried the \"Dusty Road\" yesterday as Anthony cranked out a few for our party. Bulliet Bourbon + Bundaberg Ginger Beer + wedge of lemon. Delish. I'll be getting that all the time now if I'm not getting 1 of their many beers on tap. Love the La Chouffe!!\n\n4. $3 Chicharrones Bar Snacks - the perfect compliment to a jar-ful of beer or a strong cocktail is a bag of these swine-a-licious rinds courtesy of Ryan Farr's 4505 Meats. Tasty, crispy, dusted with a spicy goodness and clearly indulgent. Grab a bag on your next visit. \n\n5.

They have a pool table and.. big buck hunter which is like completely appropriate for the decor, being hunting lodge-ish and all.  Man, I do love to hunt me some bucks (of the video game variety).  The buck hunter thing is huge on the east coast, and I'm happy to see that it's (maybe) starting to take hold here.  I mean, shootin' and drinkin' go so naturally together, don't they?\n\nThe drinks are well made, and the fact that their namesake drink, the bloodhound #1 contains a healthy dose of campari warms the cockles of my heart, which I think is a good thing.  If you like beer, definitely try the old speckled hen, which is a tasty, tasty beer.  \n\nOne night, the friendly bartender explained to me the whole socio-political makeup of Irish Whiskeys: apparently Jamesons is the catholic one, and Bushmills is the protestant one.  Then, he promptly poured us the whiskey that was non-affiliated.. I can't remember what it was, so it must have been good.  See? I learned something.\n\nI'm not sure what the other reviews are thinking since sizewise, the bar is plenty big for San Francisco.. and as for it smelling, um.. I guess they were never here before, nor do they smell any of the other bars in this city (especially the one in the mission that rhymes with assanova.. great bar, but man, that place smells awful.)  \n\nOh, and +1 star for being open EVERY NIGHT of the week.  Too many places in this hood seem to think that (a) people aren't here past 6pm (ahem, new pho place on 9th) or (b) people don't go out on mondays or tuesdays (I'm looking at you, Rocco's)..  So, I'm super happy that bloodhound is open every night, like a proper place in a city should be.\n\nAnyway, welcome to the hood, bloodhound folks..  I'll be seein you a plenty, methinks.", "author": "Dennis Y."}

I was a pretty big fan of cassidy's in terms of a local bar. 5 bucks for a beer (in a nifty mason jar) was a dollar more than i was hoping to pay (especially when i can walk across the street and get a 5 dollar beer from the city beer store that amazingly obscure and delicious), but owell.  beer list is just OK in my opinion, but again i'm biased based on what you can get next door. bar looked fully stocked though.\n\nthat said, it is really nice inside. i dig the lighting. i thought the mirrors up top where a little out of place compared to the rest of the rustic theme, but  all in all its very well put together. bathroom was very standard, and thus  lame in comparison to the rest of the bar, but it is a bathroom i guess. \n\nprobably the best part was the crowd, which was pretty mixed. better than the typical soma place, so hopefully that sticks around.\n\nall in all, honestly it was the big buck hunter that made the place for me. i walked in really hoping for a foosball table, but being from ohio i was pretty much sold when i saw big buck hunter. not to mention last night it was free to play. i'm guessing its because they are just opening. or maybe it was a fluke. but i'm praying that it will just remain free all the time. then its 5 stars from me.", "author": "justen e."}

And, most often, you have to go to those bars with a group, or at a least a friend, so you can muscle some space at the bar, get a table, and so on.\n\nBloodhound--don't have to worry about all that.  Some nights it gets packed with industry happy hours (tech, arts, film, more), but on most nights you can find a place, even if alone, and talk to the owners and bartenders--all of whom know something about what they're serving you.  \n\nIt works as a space, place and bar.

Furthermore, the first time I was here there was a super nice bartender and friendly people at the next table. \n\nHowever, this review is reflective of a crappy experience I had here Monday night with a bartender I will refer to herein as \"Little John\" because of his resemblance to said Robin Hood character. I came in there with a middle aged woman, a family friend of my parents' from out of town for an after dinner cocktail. We were slightly indecisive at first which annoyed Little John but we finally ordered our simple glasses of booze and he quickly made them and plopped them in front of us and then with a look of pure contempt asked us if we wanted to start a tab, to which we replied in the affirmative. Now I'm not sure what exactly this man didn't like about us but he was clearly unwelcoming. When he poured some fancy brownish cocktail for the guy next to me I (out of my love of weird herbs and bitters in drinks) curiously asked what it was three times; the first two times he pretended not to hear me and ignored me and the third time he glared at me and said snobbily, \"a Fernet cocktail\". Of course I nodded to this and thought, \"whatever the fuck THAT is... thanks for the explanation you condescending bastard\". \nWe slowly and slightly uncomfortably sipped our drinks and when we were done and walking out we heard a very insincere, \"Have a good night, ladies!\" come from behind the bar. \nDear Little John-\nI'm very sorry that a) my guest and I didn't meet your culturally fascist expectations of customers for asking about an interesting looking drink and b) I brought someone who could very well be a suburban mom-type into your awesomely hip bar. \nGet over yourself!\nI hate to say it but I'm assuming the reason I had a pleasant experience here the first time is because my drinking partner that night happened to be in her late twenties and covered in tattoos.", "author": "Allie S."}

It's got a funky feel to it, but nice and clean. The pool table is the most expensive I've seen @ $1.00 / game, but if they keep it maintained and nice cues as a result, then I'm ok with it...all part of the price of admission to maintain the higher-end atmosphere. I'm tight with the owner's of Julie's down the street, but they just wouldn't listen to me and put in a pool table or two...However, they need to PUT UP A CHALKBOARD so those of us who want to play can get down to it. \n\nThe jukebox is all over the map, but I'm happy to see The Pixies in there along with the classic rock and hip hop. I think they made it overly diverse on purpose until they feel out their demographic a bit better.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the new place affects the feel of the area.

Although it has large windows and a substancial sign it doesn't immediately jump out as 'the place to go' - so it was most fortunate that I was invited to the Happy Hour there.\n\nI was a little intimidated at first by the sudden darkness as I went in but as my eyes adjusted to the room I suddenly felt intrigued. This was not the Dive bar I had expected at all.\n\n A beautiful solid bar ran down the right hand side of the room with stools at just the right hight for the various patrons to sit on and then rich dark brown wall seats on the left with what could only be described as rather 'fun' looking low recliners which were on wheels. The ceiling immediately caught my eyes with the shadows of birds circling overhead. Even the artwork had been carefully considered and raised an eyebrow with its diversity and tongue in cheek nature.\n\nWhat really excited me though was the treasures that lay at the back of the bar. A fine pool table, begging to be played, a juke box with an incredibly diverse range of music and a 'Big Buck Hunter' game as well.\n\nA bar is not made a decent bar by its decor though.\n\nLuckily this one has just used the interiour to compliment 'its offer' - which is a wide range of spirits, some well thought out wines (not a huge selection - but well chosen) and a cocktail list which is best described as leathally excellent.\n\nMy favourite cocktail so far is the Ward 8 - which is made with excellent precision and flair by each of the bar tenders I have so far met. While if you are feeling like something without alcohol they can with equal dilligence whip up a fruity little number which will refresh and revitalise immediately.\n\nThe staff here are friendly and patient. Quick and skilled.\n\nThe space is large enough for a group of people to go drinking together although I would really not recommend having your gathering next to the pool table - unless you like being poked and hit with the pool que. :)\n\nThis is the place to go if you want a stress free drink with friends - the only bad thing to say about it? Those cocktails are far too easy to drink, the bar tenders far too good at making them quickly and the end result is you may go home significantly poorer.... ;)", "author": "Lulu R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-04-30", "description": "I've been here several times now and I see a trend emerging, which leads me to drop a star back. For two reasons.  \n\nOne - Your cocktail experience will hinge entirely on which bartender makes your drink.  If you get the skinny shaved head guy, order a beer instead.  He is way too busy chatting up the women at the bar, and way too focused on checking his phone and texting to see what he's putting into the shaker and into your glass.  If you get the portly red headed gentleman - where are you?? - order down the list, one of each, and have a ball. \n\nTwo - The other current feature of this place that warrants a dropped star is, unfortunately, the people.  Rotating mix of marina white chicks - \"ooh oooh, let's go check out the guys in SOMA! ...  Yeah, let's totally do it, rawr!!\", skin-tight flannel plaid shirt bicycle people talking loud to ensure they get noticed, hyper professional skinny cougar types with way too much lipstick, and some after work crowd taking group photos they'll probably immediately post on their \"about us\" page on their website.  So what is my problem with these people?  It's certainly not their dress or make-up.    My look no doubt will offend some hyperbolic critic too.  I get it.  So what's my beef??  In short, the vanity.  It's that the people here each seem to be here for a distinct and instrumental purpose.  No one in the room seems to be enjoying someone else's company or just themselves being there.  Instead, it's like they're there strictly *for something* - to find a loud talking skin-tight flannel shirt bicycle boy to take home, or to show their co-workers how \"chill\" they can be, or just to sit and enjoy their spectacular selves no matter who they're talking to.  If you're thinking... \"hello, this is almost every bar in this city\" I'd say you are mostly right.  but i think it's still useful to know which ones tend to be this way and which ones don't.  And my previous review failed to mention this about this place.", "author": "Nikki F."}

You can chill here with your friends or you can put your game face on and get in on the action. Either way, you're going to have a good time.

We decided on Bloodhound. My partner decided on a special bourbon drink. She got it back to the table and accidentally spilled it everywhere. I needed to get a rag and I asked if we could get another drink made (I would have tipped him generously, as we did the first round).  He said, \"that pain in the ass drink she wanted? Looks like the one she has is still half full.\" I did want to jump over the bar and punch him but I didn't. I got my rag and walked away. If the bar would have been full I would have never asked. It was empty and he was just an asshole. Everyone I was with are in the industry. They are all waiters and bartenders so we all decided to never, ever go back to Bloodhound.

You go to a bar where you feel comfortable, but the only drink the bartender knows how to serve well is a pint of beer. Or you go to a place that has got quality bartenders, but then you're hemorrhaging cash and dealing with a pretentious clientele.\n\nBloodhound gives you the best of both worlds. Dylan, the bartender and co-owner, mixes up some great drinks, but they don't cost you an arm and a leg, and no one expects you to be dressed to the nines to get past the door. The hunting lodge aesthetic seems to say, \"If you're just a fella tryin' to do a thing, then yeah, come on in, brochacho.\" It's a dive bar that's not at all a dive bar.\n\nOne thing to be aware of: when I was here last Saturday, I saw multiple waves of different sorts of people come in over the course of the evening. The character of the clientele here has not yet been irrevocably defined, and I'm hopeful that the patrons on the whole remain unpretentious and laid back as time goes on.

I love the wood painted ceiling with the wood decor and the antlerchandelier. It has such a woodsy rustic feel even though it's nowhere near the woods. I love the open space, it's good for happy hour and has a lively but not overcrowded feeling. I've often gotten a seat if needed and usually don't have to wait tooo long to get a drink. They have a great beer selection - bottled and tap, as well as the wide selection of cocktails. I especially love that the beer comes in jar- like glasses, very laid back. This is definitly a fun place during the week. I can't speak for the weekend as it's usually an after work spot for me.", "author": "Lindsay A."}

Perhaps it's the country modern style of wood paneling and antler chandeliers?  Perhaps it's a little bit of both.  It was a really pleasant place to hang out with friends.  Bloodhound is pretty spacious for a bar although I can see it getting packed over the weekends.  The drinks were good and bartenders were cute and helpful.  I had one of the specialty cocktails - Peach -something or other.  It was a perfect sweet girly drink with plenty of alcohol.  I came here with a few friends on a Wednesday night and I would definitely come back.  I really like that the music was not very loud, so we could actually have a conversation without shouting.  The music selection was also good  - something jazzy and easy to enjoy.", "author": "Lidiya B."}

I have found the staff all pretty helpful and friendly as well.  I believe it was some orange haired gentleman that made me a Dr. Hemmingway drink.  It was so good I had 2!!  It was so good I came back a week later with my sister... alas, the ginger mixologist was the only one who possesed the great secret of my favorite drink.  There were orange bitter, gin, and idunno... angel kisses in it or something!!\nI did try another beverage from their special menu .. the pegu... it was veryyy delicious as well.  \nThe crowds were so different from both nights I hope I am giving a fair review.  The saturday night crowd was packed and a bit yuppyish... but great music and still a great vibe!!\nThe Thursday crowd was a lot more chill, laid back... a lot more flannel then necessary... i liked it!!  However, the music was just not the same.  I think I prefer the weekend bloodhound.  The bartenders were a lot more interesting, the drinks were better, the music was better.. just bring your own friends.  \nOh and watch your purse!

It's just a fun bar with a rugged manly vibe, but totally welcoming to us gals.  Totally diverse crowd; ambiance is casual enough to almost want to call it a dive-bar, but it is so far from a dive... it's just right!  Bartenders are great.  Love that beer comes in mason jars.  However, I have this compelling need to order a Jack and something or another every time I am here.  Friday night they had a sidewalk kitchen serving up flatbread pizzas.  A Sunday afternoon brought fantastic pulled pork bbq sammies.

This is a cool-looking bar with friendly owners (extrapolated from speaking with the one behind the bar) which I will no doubt frequent on many occasions in the future.

Maybe it's because I make mine at home at about an 80-20 split. \n\nUPDATE: They started opening up a little earlier a few days a week which I like bc I have a window from 4:30-5:30 almost every day during the week when I can grab a drink before heading home.\n\nThe bar gets a bit too crowded and loud for my tastes on later on weekend evenings, but I'm 38 and married with a kid.\n\nUPDATE 2: The owners seem to be really cool guys.

If this bar was located on Polk among dozens of other bars just like it, it wouldn't be nearly as cool. So props to the owner for abiding by real estate rule #1: location, location, location. I've hit up Bloodhound for happy hour with co-workers and to kill some time before a show. They have a giant selection and boast some unique beers such as the Moose Drool Brown Ale. Even when it's busy the bartenders take the time to talk to you, and I was able to sample a few beers before making my selection. Beers are served in old fashioned mason jars, which adds a kitschy little touch to the overall experience. The decor reminds me of a modern log cabin home with some indie art thrown in. Bloodhound is a good place to bring a big group since the majority of the space is open. There is a fairly large lounge near the front window you can gather a crowd around, or you can pull a bunch of stools up around the long wood slab tables. There's a pool table in the back, and I have seen many friendly games played out there (nothing like the stick cracking debauchery at Delirium). Every time I've been to Bloodhound, it has been immaculate. I actually think it will have more character and be more inviting a few years down the road when it gets grimed up. For the most part, the people that frequent Bloodhound are young professionals with a few 'seasoned' professionals thrown in for good stories. I've seen people in there working on their laptops as well, but that's always earlier in the night before things get too messy. I like Bloodhound because it is close to my office and a good stop before heading over to a show in the area, but I wouldn't be trying to go all the way down to SOMA on a weekend just to go to Bloodhound.", "author": "Breanna L."}

We went to the bloodhound late one evening after running out of options in the Russian hill area and wanting to go to a place nearer to home. When we got there it was crowded but since it was late we found a table not too long after arriving. I spent most of the evening drinking mateveza so I was wide awake but didn't want to drink any more filling beers. I loked at the signature cocktail menu and fell on love. In Philadelphia we have loads of options for good beer and what I have been gathering is that sf is a great place for artisan cocktails. I tried a few different ones on the menu but settled on the recoil. It was sharp and a bit fizzy with a good bit of sour. The bartenders were friendly and accomodating. I really enjoyed myself there. The next time i'm in SFO ill be visiting the Bloodhound", "author": "Darreck R."}

Some guy told me few weeks ago it was kind of Seahawks place. Was he right, there is a guy there who tells the bartender what to put on the TV and if your game happens at the same time as a seahawks game, good luck catching your game.", "author": "sid c."}
