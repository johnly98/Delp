For that, 3 stars. \nWould be more but: Jeff, what oh what is going on. Is good help hard to find? I'm an employer too and I know it is. But,  an employee's abilities, or lack there of, reflect Managment's abilities to train and mentor. \n\nExample: keep the money received out of the register until change is made. This will avoid questioning the customer's integrity about the denomination of the bill presented. And will hopefully avoid what apparently was an employee breakdown and escape to the back room during what turned out to be a mini rush today.  \n\nOh, and a smile and friendly greeting to customers would go a long way too. Haven't seen that here at Pops for quite some time. \n\nWill I be back or recommend again? At this point, can't really answer. Maybe, for the quality and variety of sandwiches. Maybe not for the decline I've seen in service during my last couple of visits.", "author": "Joe P."}

I prefer theirs to the local sandwich shop actually. I wish there were more choices for bread on he Yelp app because they clearly use other breads aside the choices given but aside that, I can't really complain. \n\nService itself is a bit cold at times. Drivers deliver with a lackluster attitude and I find myself wondering why I am tipping at all. There is a delivery fee but if you get my order on time to my home, that alone isn't exactly a reason for me to tip you lol. Early? Yes I will tip extra. But doing your job description doesn't exactly mandate a tip from me. Being a nice person who doesn't shove a bag into my face as they take off without even a word does. The guy who answers the phone is very nice and was helpful with an order that was MIA via the Yelp app (thanks Eat24! *eyeroll) and when I contacted Yelp (Eat24) for help I was met with no response as well. Very annoying for an almost 2hr wait. \n\nThe different sandwiches I've had all have me full and happy with minimal mess (sometimes their sauce can wet up the sandwiches for a delivery) and their prices aren't too bad even with their delivery fee. I like the tootsie pop included. \n\nThe only thing I didn't like was their macaroni salad. It was bland and not very flavorful but it was nice having crisp veggies in it. The potato salad was very hit or miss. One day it was VERY vinegary and I found it hard to eat it. I tried to order it again but this time it was the complete opposite - bland and tasted like dry potatoes with not much else lol. So I guess I'll leave out the sides from now on. \n\nOverall I give it 4 stars because I like most of their food but not much their service. They deliver and lately my roommate orders a lot of sandwiches from the place down the road a ways and their sandwiches just aren't my thing. This is a great alt.", "author": "Bella B."}

Whether I'm bringing it home, eating in the car, or taking it to the game, it's always what I expect.  One Flap Down is my go to but you really can't go wrong with any of the other sandwiches.\n\nAs for people posting bad reviews based on delivery.  You obviously don't cherish the integrity of your sandwich much do you?  Every employee works extremely hard here with the amount of foot traffic they see, so listening to complaints over the phone is probably a little tough for how busy they are.  Before all these food delivery services even existed, you might not have had the luxury of even having a Pops sandwich delivered to your door.

Perfect place if you happen to be in the neighborhood; maybe if you need some refueling after hiking Mount Davidson.  Not quite at the level of a Roli Roti where people justifiably brave crazy lines for a sandwich nor is it worth a special pilgrimage all the way to Miraloma.  But their food definitely seems like the most appealing of the nearby strip mall options and you'll leave quite satisfied.\n\nJoey Bag-a-donuts: A trifecta of meats with beef meatballs, grilled chicken breast and bacon!  And, of course, it wouldn't be complete without a whole lot of melted provolone.  I liked the meatballs since they were moist and quite a generous portion.  The grilled chicken breast was about what'd you expect; a fried chicken cutlet would been better, but hey it's still decent chicken simply grilled.  I wasn't a fan of the bacon since it wasn't crispy and was a skimpy portion.  The marinara sauce covering everything added a nice tang to contrast the meat overload; a good amount but not so much that you're dripping sauce on yourself.

Other than that I know nothing about pops. \n\nhave no idea what there food tastes like although it looks good right! That's why this isn't a one star! \n\nSo...\n\nEat24 has no way of checking if this place is being honest about menu items or delivery times so here's what happened. \n\nI had a 30 dollar order not a ton. \n\nGet a call saying they don't have the bottled cokes so I have to settle on cans. And you know the refund process on that shit is terrible so I said it's fine I'll eat the difference and it will be all good. \n\nDelivery time is 45-50 minutes. \n\nGet a call from my brother who is at the house an hour later and the food hasn't arrived so I hit the refresh button where Eat24 contacts them. Here is where it gets good. \n\nThe estimated time stayed the same. And it stated a time that had passed about 15 minutes earlier. \n\nSo this means that Eat24 contacted pops and asked them about a delay and was told there was no delay! \n\nAt this point an hour has gone by. \n\n I call almost right away and find out that the sandwiches are actually done and made. Cool! But their estimate is 30 minutes before I would be receiving them! So I have to eat a sandwich that has been sitting for god knows how long plus their estimate of 30 minutes. \n\nThen I cancelled the order. \n\nAnyway who knows when those things would have arrived on time.\n\n\nOh and the people there are laughing at the fact these things are happening!

I know, I know, it's pretty pedestrian and I'm not sure where I picked up the habit (New York?) but this is the sandwich I love.\n\nAll this lead up is to say: Pop's Sandwich Shop provided me with one of the finest ham and cheddar sandwiches I've had in years, all on a terrifically toasted sourdough roll. I'm struggling to find a flaw in it, or the place itself. The cashier was sweet and the sandwich maker brought my sandwich over to me once he'd wrapped it up and gave it to me with a smile and a genuine well-wish.\n\nWhilst living in London, I missed American deli sandwiches something fierce.

I think I will definitely keep coming back to try more sandwiches but I really wish it was a place that would take me from subcenter.", "author": "edward k."}

And my was very toasty, I wish it was a little less.So, if u want a fresh cold sand which,make sure you say so! The meat is cut super thin and piled on! The People working there are super nice!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-20", "description": "I just spotted this brand new (less than a week old), old school, toasted sub shop near Tower Market in the Twin Peaks area.  Style wise, it's like Submarine Center and Gene's Liquor - toasted subs with Italian dressing (secret sauce).  The sandwiches are bigger with more filling than Submarine Center and they taste better too.  \n\nYou choose your meat and bread for the regular sandwiches ($5.47 - $6.47) or you can choose one of their specialty sandwiches.  There's one vegetarian sandwich (Politically Correct).  I tried the One Flap Down ($6.47, don't really understand the name) with turkey, salami, ham (which I omitted), American cheese, lettuce, thin tomato slices, red onions, mayo, mustard, pepperoncini and special dressing on Dutch Crunch.  Positives: Generous amount of meat, great bread, hefty sandwich.  Minor flaws: not enough veggies, especially the red onions and tomatoes, too much mustard, and it wasn't toasted long enough.  It was still cold in the center.  I'm sure they'll adjust this and increase the toasting time.  Or ask for it extra toasty.  Jalapenos are free.  You can add on soup, salad, chips, cookies and soft serve ice cream.  \n\nThe shop is bright and clean with a couple of tables.  The owner was really nice and would like to adjust his menu to reflect the preferences of the community.  I hope they have good meatballs.  3.5 stars for now but I bet that they will improve since they just opened.

It doesn't matter. Things I loved:\n\n- Friendly, thoughtful, attentive service. I appreciated how they made my sandwich just ahead of a large order so I didn't have to wait forever. And I loved that they asked if I wanted my frozen yogurt at the end so it didn't melt, and then prepared it about a minute before I polished off the last bites of my sandwich. Nice timing, and way to pay attention\n\n- Menu bonuses, including whole wheat rolls and free cranberry sauce. Those two things along with a massive amount of turkey and veggies came together for an amazing sandwich.\n\n- A distinctive touch, which was a tootsie pop with every order. And they had no problem swapping my chocolate for a cherry.\n\n- Even a good client base, as the what seemed to be rowdy high school group addressed me as \"sir\" when asking if they could have my big table so they could all sit together. Sir? Yeah, you go ahead.\n\nThis was an easy five stars to give.", "author": "Jason B."}

See the burnt sandwich for yourself. \n\nhttp://img3.imageshack.us/img3/8777/burntsandwich.jpg\n\nCons: Moody employees, burnt sandwiches, unsanitary conditions, high calorie sandwiches, and terrible customer service. You can tell the sandwiches aren't great because this shop is always EMPTY.\n\nPros: Close to Mollie Stones down the street where you can get better sandwiches. Motivates you to walk down to Mollie Stones to get superb customer service.\n\nCheck out their burnt sandwich (link above). Doesn't this sandwich look burnt?

Today on Oct 28, 2010 at 11:47 am (Thursday) I bought it to the Owner's attention and spoke to Jeffrey personally and showed him the pictures. I stated to him that this happened to me 5-6 times and he asked me how come I didn't complain the first time. I replied that, \"I can tolerate it a few times cause people make mistakes. Then after a few times, I'll complain.\" Owner Jeffrey gave me a free sandwich and stated that it was on the house. In addition, Jeffrey stated, \"Here's a word of advice, I heard Molly Stones make good sandwiches\" after giving me the free sandwich. (He implicitly stated to me to never to come back to his store and I'll definitely take his advice to never buy sandwiches at this place again.) \n\nFurthermore, Pop's sandwiches are made by employees that do not use gloves. They can be cleaning the tables with their dirty towels and then be making your sandwiches with their dirty hands afterwards. My free sandwich today has human hair in it and I totally lost my appetite for their sandwich after the poor customer service by their owner Jeffrey. The employees are rude and moody like their owner Jeffrey. If you call ahead, you MUST leave a phone number or the employees will give you a difficult time.

The Pop's meatball sandwich is fantastic with high quality meatballs, delicious baked bread and extremely filling for my hearty appetite. \n\nThere are many other signature sandwiches that caught my attention, so I look forward to trying and reviewing the other offerings. One big hit for sure will be the soft serve ice cream. In the pouring rain, I saw 7 people order soft serve in a 30 minute period.\n\nFinally, I was fortunate to meet one of the owner's when I ordered my sandwich and he gave me the story behind Pop's. The shop is owned by two brothers with strong SF roots (attended Saint Ignatius and USF). It's named after their 94 year old grandfather \"Pop\" who is one of their great inspirations and a sandwich aficionado. \n\nPS - \"One Flap Down\" refers to how Jeffery Leonard from 1980's San Francisco Giants rounded the bases after hitting a home run.", "author": "Michael P."}

She said to go, even though she hadn't asked me (it was for here).\nA few minutes later, as a customer was ordering seven subs to go, I received a sandwich wrapped to go and some weird energy drink. I exchanged the energy drink for the beverage I'd ordered, not mentioning that the energy drink cost more. It wouldn't have been worth the hassle for them to figure out how to give me a refund on the difference. I opened my sub wrapper to find a sub with many of the sauces and veggies I had explicitly asked to be omitted. Multiple times. I took the sub back to the cashier, and she went to fix it. Now my sub was in line behind the guy with the huge to go order.\nIt came back out, this time packaged for here, and was closer to what I had ordered (I asked for extra lettuce, it had very light lettuce, but again, not worth the effort). I had asked for no pickles on the sub; they left a pickle spear under the sub in the basket, so the whole side of the sub tasted like pickle. The sub was very lightly toasted this time, rushed to be fixed for me. The turkey was flavorful but not plentiful, and the bacon was flavorless and cut so thin it was see-thru. I was hoping the sub might save the experience, but it worsened it.\nBottom line, if the cashier's not ready to be on her own, put a trainer next to her, attached at the hip. And if there's a breakdown in communication, don't hesitate to talk to the customer and apologize, instead of trying to fix it behind the scenes with the same staff that f*cked it up the first time. And if you can't get the service right, you'd better pray the food's good enough to forgive the rest of the poor experience (it wasn't).\nCheck out my sandwich list to find out where to go instead.", "author": "Matt G."}

It is a wonderfull spot for sandwiches of all kinds.  I usually get a pastrami sandwich w/ pesto sauce.  It's always nicley toasted, warm, and delicous.  Plus their sandwichs are big (I usually eat half)The toostie pops are a nice touch too.", "author": "Sesily M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-02-22", "description": "ok after readin the other reviews I needed to voice my opinion.  Pricewise, yeah it's not $5 footlong, but that's like comparing apples to oranges.  I ordered one of their specialty sandwiches which was tuna, cheese and avacado on sliced wheat.  Yeah you think sliced wheat at a sub place, what the heck?  While I was waiting for my sandwich I was thinking just that, I should have got the dutch crunch, oh well next time.  Well when my sandwich arrived, which took about 5-7 minutes, I was quite surprised how good it was.  It came perfectly toasted, great tuna mix, with a pickle on the side.  I will definitely return...", "author": "Eric D."}
