I don't even know what was the highlight because all of it was SO GOOD. \n\nThe salad was really big (so it's def a bang for your bucc) and super light & refreshing. I feel like a lot of Japanese restaurants drench their salads with sauce until it's salty af, but not Okane. The sukiyaki came with the most perfectly cooked egg ever, like i've seen maybe 10 perfectly poached eggs in my life and this was one of them. The beef was really juicy and soft and thin. Both are perfect for sharing between two or three people, since their portions are so big. \n\nThe restaurant has a lot seating for such a small space (without being cramped). It was pretty quiet so it's a good place for talking. The environment was fancy but also casual if that makes sense, so like it's a good date night place but also you don't need to dress up. If you wanted to you could probably get a sick insta from it too because the inside is pretty.\n\nThe service was the fastest i've ever seen for a sit down Japanese restaurant.

The experience was nice and service was relatively quick, but there's few things that didn't quite resonate with me at Okane.\n\nFirst, we ordered three items to share: Akhihabara Roll, Roppongi Roll, and Kappabashi Roll. We devoured everything in no time and were still hungry. The rolls were pricey for the amount of food. Yes the ingredients were fresh, but there wasn't much of it. So disappointing that we ended up going somewhere else to eat more food. Blasphemous.\n\nAlso, there was no soy sauce on the table, and we had to ask for it. Kind of inconvenient but I get they want to eliminate clutter on the table. They allot a certain amount of soy sauce then walk away with the receptacle. Never seen a place do that before. \n\nAnd lastly like I said, it's pretty pricey restaurant for sushi that doesn't fill you up. It's a classy place for a nice business lunch, but expect to walk away thinking about dinner already. Would I come back here? Nope. Did I like the food? Yes.

Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed by the dinner, but maybe I'll come back for brunch someday. These are my thoughts on what we ordered:\n\nGrilled cod: the best dish we ordered. The cod was buttery and well seasoned. \nSaba karaage: this tastes like pan fried mackerel that my mom makes, but with pickled vegetables on the side. Make sure to eat the fish with the veggies, which brings out the flavor of the mackerel in a different way. \nToriteba karaage: these were amazing and the crunch was equivalent to that of chips. The sauce was also really good. \nOysters on the half shell with uni ikura quail egg: the oysters were overwhelming and had a bitter aftertaste that couldn't be quelled by the sweetness of the uni, ikura & quail egg. I wish the oysters were smaller and sweeter. \nShinjuku roll: this had a great texture, but the A5 beef didn't have much flavor or fattiness. The creaminess of the avocado and sweetness of the snow crab paired well though. \n\nIn terms of service, the servers were friendly, but were not organized in terms of handling our order (we had a couple people take our order and then they got confused delivering dishes to us).

We were prompted several times by the hostess to order quickly and we ordered food to share family-style. She looked at our order and told us that we should get 3-4 more dishes and we should order now and not order after we've gotten food. We got a few more and she asked if we wanted one more. We declined, as it was a lot of food. One friend in our party commented, \"That was intense.\" \n\nWe sat down, the food arrived quickly, it was all yummy, but when the time rolled around to 8:42pm, and we were finished with our food and got the check.

She came back after 20 minutes with our appetizers and we ordered our main dishes and some more appetizers. \n\nAfter over 30 mins, she came back with only two of our orders. We waited a bit to get our two other orders, so we can all eat together, but it took so long and after over 45 minutes that nobody came to our table, we gave up. She never even came back to fill up our water. We had to keep asking someone to bring some water to the table. \n\nIt was very disappointing to have to go through that. We were not able to enjoy our time together and have a nice and relaxing dinner.", "author": "Reza N."}

It was a Thursday night and it was pretty empty so we got seated immediately. Overall nothing about this place stood out to me. The sake I ordered from their menu happened to be sold out. The service was average as well: First nobody had chopsticks when the food came out, then my friend ordered a drink that never came so we had to follow up on that, and lastly at the end of the dinner they quickly cleared our table and my friend's drink that was still half full. They didn't even ask her if she was done with it (which she was not) so they had to bring the unfinished drink back from the kitchen. \n\nWe essentially finished all the food we ordered within 45mins because the food came out all at once. It didn't create an environment where we could hang out and chat; it actually felt rushed. We each paid about $50 and were still starving. Instead of ordering more we made a group decision to go to another place to finish off the night with some tater tots :)\n\nTo be fair, the food was good but not stand out from other sushi/japanese restaurants in the city. It's really not worth the price. I'd recommend using your money elsewhere and skipping this place. \n\nRandom fact this place is part of the restaurant chain owned by Omakase Restaurant Group (ORG) that also owns the Omakase restaurant next door and dumpling time that's right around the corner.", "author": "Kathy L."}

My friend and I walked in for our 6:30pm reservation...thinking it was Okane...only to realize it was Omakase. Here we were in our ripped jeans, plus me in my \"vaca vibes\" crop top, thinking holy shit we are SUPER underdressed?! And wait wtf, we booked a Michelin star restaurant for dinner?! Hostess checked us real quick and said Okane is next door. Whoops. So tl;dr two sushi restaurants next door to one another. Omakase to the left; Okane to the right. \n\nOKAY, soo when we got to the correct restaurant I was thinking, well damn, Omakase must hate being next door to this \"shittier\" restaurant w the wrong ppl coming in all the time. And again, I got fact checked by my friend who went to the restroom and saw a newspaper article on the wall, detailing Okane being the sister restaurant to Omakase. Well guys, we were in for a better than expected Saturday night sushi experience! \n\nI got a lot more excited about dinner and HAD to get the Hokkaido uni nigiri at that point. My friend's not much of a sashimi/nigiri eater, so we got two of the rolls (one was basically a 49er roll w a diff name and the other was a shrimp tempura w hamachi on top situation). For apps, we started w the lotus root chips and agedashi tofu. Anddd to finish we got the udon with soft boiled egg. YUM. \n\nHonestly, I was really happy with the sashimi quality (no surprise if they're right next door to omakase)...I meannn, they've got to be getting the fish frm the same vendors (maybe just slightly lower quality and I'm okay w that on a regular sushi night). Also, the udon had great bite to it, and the soft boiled egg was blanched to perfection. I'm not a huge fan of rolls either, but I'd say it was pretty good quality. \n\nDefinitely a come backer. Prices are higher than a nightly sushi dinner spot, but nothing compared to what you'd pay for Omakase next door. About 45pp. Service was also pretty good. Keeping them at 4 stars bc there wasn't anything EXTRAordinary about the dinner, but still good enough for me to patron again.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

My fianc\u00e9e is currently not eating soy or gluten and they were extremely accommodating. They allowed us to order sets of 2 nigiri with one fully dressed and the other without the soy/gluten. The chef made a nice little tray of lemons, yuzu vinegar, truffle oil, and salt to help flavor the various fish and instructions were given to the server for which things to put on each fish as we received them.\n\nAll of the fish we were served was very fresh and delicious, while there were a few that really stood out like the amberjack, grunt and the fresh hokkaido scallop.

I love the face mask that lined the back wall as decorations. Really nice touch. My friends and I decided to order several things and share. Started off with otama udon, the roppongi , shinjuku, ginza roll, an order of local uni for me, and a bottle of sake. Everything was so good! I definitely enjoyed all the rolls and were able to taste how fresh the fish were. And don't get me started on the uni, I love that they serve it without nori wrapped around the rice here. The uni literally just melted like butter, it was so good I had to order another one haha. The wait for the roppongi roll took a lot longer than anything else and we didn't mind. We honestly just thought because of new year everything was probably backed up but the staff had noticed and bought out lotus chips and another ginza roll for us while we waited. It was really unexpected and we all comment at how amazing their service was. I understand getting one thing but two? The service alone will be the reason I'll keep wanting to come back here :).

Was pretty bummed at first but turns out I was mistaken. There's not too many options for brunch but their most popular items are the set menu. The restaurant feels very intimate since its not very big, so you might also want to make reservations if you don't want to wait.\n\nMy friend and I ended up getting the set menu from the Okane Brunch Menu which also comes with a bowl of rice, miso soup and a side salad. I'm giving this place a 10/10 in terms of presentation and their creativity. This was my first time having japanese brunch so I was really excited about it. The portions looked really small and I thought I would still be hungry after this meal but man was I wrong. \n\nMegumi: \n- Stewed beef: in layman's term its basically your beef yakiniku. Nothing really special.\n- Miso gindara: Gindara was marinated well and was really soft. Did not taste fishy at all. \n- Onsen tamago with truffle oil: This to me was the highlight of the meal. You have a perfectly poached egg in a bowl with a white creamy sauce, asparagus and a hint of truffle oil. No words can describe how good this dish is. They suggest you to pour it over your bowl of rice but I personally like my rice plain. \n- Sushi sphere: Your typical nigiri (salmon, toro and white tuna)\n- Potato salad: Nothing special\n- Crispy baby anchovies: Don't remember getting this with my meal but we did get a bunch of pickled vegetables \n\nMiyabi: \n- Stewed pork belly: Melts in your mouth! Similar to caramelized pork belly in chinese restaurants. \n- Braised chicken and turnip (soup): Clear broth with chicken and daikon, A little bitter, maybe they didn't wash the daikon properly or cooked it too long\n- Smoked salmon: Tasted like the miso gindara but with an additional smokiness to it. The fish itself is smooth and doesn't smell fishy.\n- Tamago: Pretty good tamago, perfect sweetness level\n- Sesame tofu: Tofu had a weird texture. It was crumbly and not as smooth as your regular tofu.\n- Crispy baby anchovies: Don't remember getting this with my meal but we did get a bunch of pickled vegetables \n\n\nFound out that this was actually a sister restaurant to omakase (right beside it).

It was wide open when I made the reservation.\n\nThey call it brunch, but it's more like a Japanese breakfast set in my opinion. I ordered the Miyabi set ($22), which comes with pork belly, braised chicken, smoked salmon, tamago, and tofu. I loved the presentation, as everything comes in colorful small plates served as part of a round wooden tray (see my pictures, that will make more sense). Halfway through eating, I realized I probably wouldn't be full from the set and ordered an okonomiyaki on the side ($14). \n\nFood-wise, everything in the set was delicious except for the braised chicken which came in a broth, as the chicken was kind of dry and hard to chew even though it was cooked in the broth. My favorite item out of the set was probably the pork belly, as it was well flavored and melted in my mouth. Something to keep in mind is that the sets are all on the small side, so if you're hungry you might want to order some of the appetizers to share.\n\nI was disappointed by my okonomiyaki, though. I don't know if it's because they were rushing to get it out to me because I ordered it halfway through my meal, but it came out maybe 80% cooked and there was still some of the uncooked mix that pooled at the bottom of the dish. They must have heard my friends and I talking about it (or maybe they noticed themselves), because they comped it for us. That's what I call good service! \n\nOne thing that threw us off was the prices on the menu were a little bit higher than the prices we saw on their website. The Miyabi set is actually $22 and the Megumi set is $25. We had already scoped out what we wanted before coming, but the increased prices made us rethink our choices.\n\nI'm glad I came to try it out once, but it's honestly a bit too pricy for what it is and the portions that you get, so I don't think I will be back for brunch/lunch.\n\nParking in the area is street parking.

It is a small place with a prominently displayed sushi bar. I loved the brightly colored artwork and the patterned light shades- sometimes the small details make a place just pop.\n\nThe servers were polite and brought water right away. The only thing I would ding them for was not bringing all of our food out at the same time. There was a few minutes of lag time between each entree. But the food was really beautifully plated and tasty! We ordered two of the sushi lunch sets, the salmon teriyaki bento, and a udon bowl. \n\nThe bento box was so pretty! Two pieces of teriyaki glazed salmon nestled next to a mound of salad that was topped by crunchy tiny unidentifiable white balls. A small serving of rice was dusted with some seaweed in it's own compartment. In the last compartment was a small pile of pickles. It also came with miso soup, which arrived earlier than the main bento box. \n\nThe nabeyaki udon is the one with shrimp tempura, chicken, wakame, green onion, and fish cake. It arrives in a very hot, covered pot that the server lifts up with a flourish and a warning about the hot pot. The only downside to the covered pot is that the tempura is soggy before it even arrives. However, the bowl was good and filling, with lots of chicken. \n\nThe sushi lunch set is comprised of 5 nigiri, 1 roll, 1 tamago, and miso soup. The sushi is chef's choice but they can work with you to customize it to your liking as well. The sushi rice seems already seasoned with soy sauce- it is a mixed brown and white color. It made the tuna(?) roll look a little muddled. The nigiri were fresh with generous slices of fish- we had salmon, tuna, and a few others that I couldn't identify on sight.\n\nA great place for a sushi lunch. It seemed other people agreed beacuse they were trickling in around lunchtime and the place was half-full when we left. They also had several carryout orders. I bet the weekend brunch is wonderful as well!", "author": "Sally C."}

Tasted okay...not worth the price.\n-4 pieces of UNI NIGIRI: your typical hokkaido uni, which was melt in your mouth good and super creamy! \n-Agedashi tofu: came with 4 pieces of tofu and a couple fried vegetables.

I made a reservation online for 5, but they were able to accommodate our large group luckily. It's a pretty small restaurant so I would recommend you to not risk this like I did if you plan on coming with a lot of people. Given we were seated at their largest table, they really could not go beyond 8 without splitting tables. \n\nThe menu was interestingly displayed. It's not the easiest menu to read and we weren't sure how to gauge the portion sizes. I think this restaurant is mostly known for their sushi since they're sister restaurants to omakase. \n\nThe rolls are all decently good. Fish is pretty fresh. I ordered the chicken skewers, and would definitely not recommend you order them. It's $13+ for 2 skewers of chicken + 1 skewer of some chicken ball.

I made a reservation for 10AM (opening time) assuming we would need it because its SF and you need reservations everywhere but we were the only people in the restaurant through the end of our meal. This was surprising since Okane is buzzy as the more casual little brother of Omakase but I guess its in an odd part of town.\n\nAnyways, we arrived on time and were sat promptly. The hostess explained the menu to us including the 4 set meals as well as the a la carte options which was thoughtful service. I decided on the Megumi set ($25) since it included sushi and A had the Miyabi set ($22). Keep in mind, the prices are $2 higher in the restaurant than online. We did not have anything to drink but water though their Sake list seems legit so if we come back for dinner, maybe we will check that out. While we were waiting for our food, we noticed how beautiful and simple Okane is. It seems very modern with a ton of natural light from the windows. Everything down to the chopsticks (which were the most natural-feeling ones we have ever used) seems well thought-out. Note that Okane shares bathrooms with Omakase next door and that the bathrooms are, befitting of a Michelin Star restaurant, beautiful and smell AMAZING. Weird observation for a bathroom, I know, but I really want to know what air freshener they use because I need it in my apartment like now.\n\nOur food arrived so I stopped pondering the restaurant and took my obligatory Yelp pictures. We were started out with Miso Soup, Salad and Pickles which were as expected and then our sets arrived. Both of the sets were plated BEAUTIFULLY and are instagram-ready. Our waiter explained each dish to us and we got to work! I won't go into details about each dish in each set but everything was good, nothing spectacular. I would say my main disappointing options in the Megumi set were the Temarizushi (Sushi Spheres) and the Onsen Tamago (eggs in hollandaise). The sushi tasted gritty to me and had an odd flavor. The Tamago I couldn't figure out how to eat. From A's Miyabi set, I think the Smoked Salmon wasn't great. Most of the other items both sets were decent. The amount of food was perfect since we were full but not stuffed.\n\nI was a bit disappointed as I have wanted to come to Okane for a while but from what I understand, brunch is a newer offering so they may still have some kinks to work out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-05", "description": "I still haven't been to the fancier Omakase next door, but one recent evening after work, I ventured toward this otherwise desolate area of SoMa to give its casual cousin a try. If you've ever been to this part of Townsend after 6PM, it's a bit of a ghost town except for a few locals carrying home their groceries from Trader Joe's nearby. The dimly lit Okane had maybe two other customers when I asked for a table and immediately perused the surprisingly comprehensive menu full of izakaya-style small plates. There were two sushi chefs ready for business at the counter, but business continued to be pretty slow that evening (photo: http://bit.ly/1OgrWXq).\n\nI decided to try one of their specialty rolls, the $15 Roppongi, which decoratively combined maguro, hamaichi, snow crab, salmon, and avocado into a filling wrapped by thinly sliced cucumber in a coil-like fashion (photo: http://bit.ly/1YcaWqM). I thought it was going to be like a rainbow roll, but it actually turned out to be a healthier variation since there was no rice. It tasted so fresh I didn't miss it, and it was complimented by generous slices of fresh ginger (photo: http://bit.ly/1QTEZOi). I decided to follow this up with the $8 Jidori Egg Chawanmushi, a custardy home-style favorite that they gussied up with fresh shrimp and sauteed bok choy (photo: http://bit.ly/1rxDdxz).\n\nIt was quite tasty since it reminded me of what my mom used to make if I was a very good boy.

He doesn't quite appreciate how difficult it is to get a table in SF and I tried to find the best option available for prime dinner time at the last minute. Okane is what I came up with.\n\nEven though the time we wanted was not available on OpenTable, the hostess was very kind to accommodate us when I asked nicely over the phone. We arrived at 7:30 and were seated at a cute two-top near the entrance. \n\nThe menu is more izakaya style but also has a decent selection of sushi and sashimi. We shared 3 items for dinner: Beef Sukiyaki, Salmon sashimi, and Ginza Roll (shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber, topped with torched hamachi, jalapeno, blue fin tuna). I was pleasantly surprised that it ended up being enough food for two hungry people.\n\nThe sukiyaki seemed highly recommended by some Yelpers but it was truly a disappointment. I do not think I'm a sukiyaki expert by any means but I do love this dish. The beef and overall flavor of the broth was good; however, I did not like the seaweed and the noodles were terribly soft and broken.\n\nThe Ginza Roll and Salmon sashimi were good; I've had better at the same or lower price point (Elephant Sushi anyone?).\n\nOne of the awesome things about Okane is that there is ample free (after 6) street parking in the neighborhood, which is such a luxury in SF. This is a solid Japanese option in SOMA.", "author": "Yi Z."}

I went to Omakase during its first month of opening and loved it, but I immediately realized it wasn't a place to frequent other than for special occasions.\n\nTherefore, I was more than excited for Okane to open. I dined here back in February and was very impressed with their Agedashi Tofu - it was super gooey, melt-in-your-mouth, with a light ponzu sauce. Other favorites included Hokkaido Uni ($15/per pair) and the Shinjuku Roll ($25) - topped with A5 Wagyu for 7 pieces.\n\nTonight, we dined here again since we were in the neighborhood and were reminiscing their amazing tofu. We ordered it again and while it was good, it wasn't as gooey and mind-blowing as the last time. We made a note to the staff and they were so kind and immediately took it off our tab, asking what made it better last time. I can certainly appreciate when the staff takes the time to take your comments and thoughts into consideration.\n\nWe again had the Shinkuku roll and it was as good as last time, if not better. We also opted for some misc nigiri such as the Domestic Uni ($10/pair), Ikura, Sake, and Kanpachi. The domestic Uni from Maine was no comparison to the Hokkaido. Very medicore and less flavorful and creamy than Hokkaido's. The udon was pretty standard- I would've liked a few slices of meat, even if the entree cost a few dollars more. Just udon with soup and an egg is pretty bland.\n\nService is solid - the staff all share duties and frequently come to check on you and refill your drinks, never really going unattended.\n\nOverall I like Okane for a casual night out or for craving any sort of Japanese dish- they really have a pretty good variety of foods on their menu, from noodles and rice dishes to nigiri/sushi and cooked dishes.\n\nThe ambiance is inviting but spacious and pretty casual. This spot in SOMA is especially parking-friendly (metered/street as well as a lot next door).", "author": "Veronica S."}

Place is smallish but still a lot of table options if you are a group of two. The place is sleekly decorated but not overly done. There is a small bar counter where the chef is preparing the dishes. \nThe menu is a little overwhelming with so many options of veggies, beef, fishes, sushi, noodle rice dishes. Luckily we had a great staff that helped us settle some dishes. We went with the delicious live uni (special of the day),yu dofu a clay pot, beef sukiyaki, roppongi roll, nori chazuki, and aji tataki. \nThe live uni was obviously fresh and so delicious, and impeccable plate display. The tofu in clay pot was pretty plain and healthy served with kelp and seaweed - nothing special just plain with some side sauce. The beef sukiyaki was amazing and so flavorful - a bit on the salty side but in all the right ways. Roppongi roll was great because it has cucumber instead of rice rolled around the fish so it was a nice alternative. The nori chazuki was rice with soup - it was good and hearty for such a cold night. The Aji tataki stole the show. They took an entire little aji fish, gave us the meat as the sashimi, then deep fried the skeleton for us to eat the end.  It was so amazing! Deep fried aji bones for the win. It was so crisp and flavorful, we ate the whole thing including the head which we weren't sure if we were supposed to keep eating but we did it anyway. I love the zero waste involved. \nGreat spot and I'd def recommend it.", "author": "Veronica L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-18", "description": "It's Japanese diner style food. But given this is America, you can get all sorts of izakaya in one shot. It is not as good as that underground spot in Time Square theatre district (Sake Bar Hagi), but this being San Francisco, it's good, very good in fact.\n\nA perfect spot to take your little ones. They have a good reservation system. You can get in and out easily. The children were tired so it's nice to be seated ahead of the reservation time by 20 minutes. Strength is their sashimi, and misc. bar food that mix well together. Monkfish liver is very fresh. Nigiri is on the spot tender and soft and fresh. Rolls are well done. Sukiyaki is light and airy, perfect for sharing. Grilled cod is rich and flavorful and is as good as you can get on this side of the coast. Chawamushi was bland and watery, worse than I could have made at home, so I'd skip that and go to Ame (the Michelin star restaurant in SoMa) for that (it's really the best of the best, even better than Yuzuki so no need to get it here). Salad is a bit too salty and soggy.\n\nKarage and chicken skewers are quite a hit among the children. Which is to say, this is not a great place for adults who want a fancy Japanese meal but it's excellent if you want to drink a beer and watch the children go crazy. \n\nI really would have wished for it to be higher end, only because a real exciting izakaya place ought to offer something you just can't get anywhere else. I think it's very good for what it is. It's marked a return place when you need to be gentle to your wallet and you want to go eat quickly and then leave. So this is where the star rating is aligned with the quality of the food and not aligned with its affordability (which is a solid 4) and convenience (which is a 5). \n\nAll things considered, not a date place, a great family (Japanese) diner with popular food items. Inexpensive, with ample parking, and a perfectly good place for friends to gather (won't break the bank).\n\nThe restaurant is very efficient. It is powered by a newly minted Michelin star restaurant next door. It's very well staffed. They treat children well. It's very affordable. It's got a huge variety. But for a great new restaurant to stand out and capture the audience, it needs some oompth (think Volta on Mission), or je ne sais quoi (think An Japanese in Japantown) . Sadly, Okane lacked both.", "author": "Victoria E."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-22", "description": "Nothing gets me more excited than when a new restaurant opens up, especially a Japanese one. I could eat Japanese food all day, every day for the rest of my life...if I was rich. But, we all know that legit Japanese food doesn't come cheap. And by \"legit\", I mean the type that won't give you the Hershey squirts from all dat orange bukkake sauce. \n\nHow can I satiate my Japanese food craving while being mindful of my food expenditures? Go for lunch...specifically, weekday lunch. Lunch items tend to be less expensive and booze is out of the question when you have to return to work afterwards. Though I've been called a \"church girl\" at work (wtf?!) so maybe a couple of sake bombs will show them who I really am! *Muaahaaahaaa*\n\nMy co-worker and I went to Okane (same owner as Omakase next door) for lunch yesterday. Luckily, we came early and beat the lunch rush. They've only been opened for a couple of days and they were pretty packed by the time we left at 12:30 pm.  \n\nOkane is an izakaya restaurant (Japanese tapas). The menu is quite extensive - they have everything from agedashi tofu, chawanmushi, karaage, yakitori, tataki, sukiyaki, donburi, udon to sushi. Their lunch menu and dinner menu is pretty similar except that they don't offer the bento boxes at dinner. They also offer omakase at the sushi bar ($80?). Beer, sake, and wine only.\n\nWe started out with the Jidori Egg Chawanmushi ($8): http://bit.ly/1Pntwfs. The jidori egg gave the custard a brighter yellow hue than usual. Loved the silky and lush texture but it needed a touch of salt or soy for flavor. Although the shrimp tempura was perfectly crunchy and airy, I prefer the traditional steamed shrimp. The bok choy was an odd garnish and made one of the tempura pieces soggy.\n\nI ordered the Shokudo Bento Box w/ chicken karaage as my protein ($14): http://bit.ly/1OCsJUz. It was accompanied with a beautiful medley of other items: shiozake, marinated kelp, fishcake, tamago, japanese pickles, rice, and miso soup.\n\nThe miso soup was too salty for me so I just picked out the tofu and seaweed to eat but my co-worker enjoyed it. My barometer of a good Japanese restaurant is their rice. The short-grain rice was sticky and had a good chew (not mushy). For functionality purposes, I would have preferred the rice in a bowl. I'm a messy eater to begin with so it was hard to eat rice off a wooden board with chopsticks without flinging some into my hair. Told you, I'm messy af.\n\nThe chicken karaage was nicely crisp and tender but it was a little dry and I didn't taste much garlic and ginger flavor. Slurp Ramen in Chinatown has my favorite karaage to date. The other items refreshingly and subtly rounded out the meal. Save the tamago (sweet Japanese omelet) as a \"dessert\". Portions are appropriately Japanese sized. If you have a big appetite, you'll probably still be hungry after the bento box.\n\nService was cordial and prompt since we were the first customers. It slowed down as they got busier though. \n\nThe dining area is minimalistic and zen with wooden furnishings and a wall of Japanese noh masks. There's only one large high top for 8 people, so it's recommended to come in a party of 2-4 people. \n\nEasy street parking. \n\nSince we went to Okane for lunch and were being mindful of the bill, I didn't get to sample as much of the menu as I wanted to. What we had, however, was pretty solid and was approved by my Japanese co-worker. \n\nAn izakaya meal is not a true \"izakaya\" meal without sake and beer flowing so for round two, let's let our hair down and get a little ratchet - sake bomb time?", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Very satisfying.\nThe onigiri is not typical, it is not wrapped in seaweed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-19", "description": "In case you didn't already know, Okane is the sister restaurant to Michelin rated Omakase next door. For me that was enough of a hook to get me strolling through their doors....lol. Well that and the fact I have been super craving quality sushi  lately. I came to Okane with the mentality of finding really high quality fish with a reasonable price point, and in that regard I believe they met my expectations. I came with a friend and we shared a bunch of nigiri. Among them were the toro, sake, hamachi belly, hokkaido uni, kinmedai, and shima aji. We also split an order of the shinjuku roll which was basically similar to a fancied up California roll but used snow crab instead and was topped with lightly torched A5 Wagyu beef. \n\nI was really excited to try the toro since this was my first time ordering it coupled by its high price point and rarity. (Don't even get me started on overfishing and sustainability...lol) Anyways, I digress. The toro was ever so slightly torched and visually you could just tell it was a fatty piece of fish by the flesh. I salivated in anticipation. When the toro first hits your tastebuds, you get that immediately recognizable \"tuna\" flavor but after that is when all comparisons end and the flavor you get is just fatty, creamy goodness. It literally melts in your mouth and if you were blindfolded, you could easily be duped into thinking this was a piece of high grade Kobe or A5 Wagyu beef. You heard of Parmesan Reggiano hailed as the undisputed king of cheeses??? Then Toro has to be the G.O.A.T of sushi....lol. \n\nWe were quite pleased in the quality of all our nigiri, especially in the fish to ride ratio. Whereas most sushi bars might try to skimp on the fish ad cut a sliver of fish that's almost transparent and place it on a mountain of rice, Okane did the exact opposite and cut a generous portion of fish that pretty much blanketed the bed of rice it was placed upon. Our only complaint on the fish was the kinmedai, which we found awfully chewy and almost gristly, not good eats. Our server also neglected to give us individual plates even though we were sharing basically everything. Minus 1 star. In short, Okane is a solid sushi bar worthy of it's big brother's Michelin status. Until you get to try out Omakase, I would suggest Okane as an affordable alternative. I will definitely return.", "author": "Derrek O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-02-20", "description": "*** In Short ***\n\nDecent izakaya with okay to tasty dishes, but pricing relative to portions lends to poor value.\n\n*** In Depth ***\n\nI took advantage of that fact that I was In the area for a nearby art exhibition last weekend to come and try Okane while they were still new, and hopefully, not too crowded. Coming in around 8pm without a reservation, my date and I were lucky enough to get seated almost immediately, at the last open table at the time.\n\nNow, I've never been to Omakase, and I'm admittedly not a huge fan of sashimi. However, Okane has branded itself as an izakaya, and I ordered accordingly, for the most part::\n\n* Sake Lees Alaskan Black Cod - I use black cod as a baseline to judge izakayas by, and while theirs wasn't bad, it was lighter in flavor than I would have expected, and not nearly as melt-in-your-mouth tender as I would have liked.\n\n* Toriteba Karaage - A little bland on its own, but very flavorful when paired with the accompanying spicy mayo and shiso salt. But, I mean, these were just chicken wings. Sorry: expensive, chicken wings. For the same price, I could have gone to Hot Sauce and Panko and gotten almost 3x as many wings, that would have been both more flavorful and juicier.\n\n* Chawanmushi - A very, very delicately flavored chawanmushi, compared to the ones I've had in the past. Not to the point of being bland, but given the two things we'd eaten right before, it definitely was on the light side, comparatively.\n\n* Shinjuku Roll - By far the best thing we had that night, and the only thing I'd consider coming back here for. It's basically a California roll (with real crab) with a hefty portion of torched wagyu beef on top. The flavor of the California roll portion was a little more dominant than the beef, but you could definitely taste both. Pricey, at $25 for seven pieces, but more reasonable when considering the components than the other items were.\n\nSo, the problem with Okane isn't that the food is bad, because it's not. The problem is that, for the price (we ended up spending $40 per person after tax and tip) and the small portions, I'm expecting the food to be fantastic, if not stellar, and that, these were not. The value just isn't there. If you want a solid izakaya experience, you're better off going to Kiraku in Berkeley for something casual, or Izakaya Yuzuki in the Mission for something fancier.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - It's a brand new restaurant, so accessibility isn't a problem, with plenty of space and accessible tables.\n\nBathroom - Single, private bathrooms, and quite accessible.", "author": "Johnny W."}

It's definitely a good place to hang out with friends.

The pictures on Yelp were really inviting, but the flavors that I tasted just didn't match up to the price. First off, we got the tartare which was tasty! The Harajuku roll was also yummmy as well! But we got one other roll (which I forgot the name of) - it was wrapped in cucumber instead of seaweed, and although the idea was innovative, the overdose of cucumber drowned out the tastiness of the savory fish inside. But really though. The fish was theeee bomb dot com in that roll!! Lastly, I ordered the Ikura and Salmon rice dish with the hot green tea, and this is where I really felt like I didn't get my money's worth. Yes, I knew it was going to be experimental and probably bland, but I didn't expect it to be thaaaat tasteless. I thought that at least the fish eggs would save the flavor, but meh. I tried to save the flavor with pepper flakes, wasabi and soy sauce, but uguuu, not my cup (or bowl) of tea. Although I enjoyed the first two fish dishes, it was along the pricey end and I was still hungry, so overall, I'm giving this place a three star. The ambiance and decor inside was really nice and Japanese-esque though!! Next time, I think I'll try eating the nigiri sushi rather than the menu items and perhaps my rating with change because the fish here really did taste fresh and savory!", "author": "Kim N."}

We ordered two rolls, a tofu dish, and a sashimi plate. The two rolls were ok. I would say the biggest issue was that all the flavor s would muddle together and you end up not being able to taste the fish. The tofu dish was a huge let down. We ordered the Yu-dofu and we felt the chef just gave up. Image four pieces of tofu that tasted store bought, two shitake mushrooms, and some veggies, boiled in water. Yep, that's it. I mean, at least put it in some dashi sauce as it was so bland. The sashimi plate was the complete opposite. All you could taste was the truffle oil and the texture of something soft (fish) and mushy (avocado) - the presentation was very messy too.\n\nLastly, the experience. The waiter seemed a bit distracted when I asked him questions about the menu. The menu is quite confusing as they try to be fancy with the descriptions and titles. However, every time I asked a question and he answered one, he would begin to turn away and leave. I had to start asking another question for him to stay. This happened three times. When the food arrived, the wait staff would also just drop things off without explaining what they brought. \n\nGranted, we had some baseline expectations since the sister restaurant has a Michelin star and yelp had 4 stars, but this was a huge letdown, especially for the price of the food.", "author": "Andy C."}

However, I don't remember the last time I tasted such delicious fish that it's made up for the lackluster of the other dishes.\n\n1) 5/5 The Sushi Lunch Set came with chef's choice of 5 nigiri pieces, tekka maki (tuna roll), tamago, and miso soup.  The fish was absolute melt-in-your-mouth perfection.  At $19, I find that it's totally worth the price and was filling.\n\n2) 2/5 The Mixed Tempura is not on the menu but I was allowed to order it anyway because what Japanese restaurant wouldn't serve tempura during lunch?  The tsuyu (tempura dipping sauce) was rather bland despite adding the grated daikon and garlic provided.  It also had a slight medicinal flavor going on which I can't say I enjoyed.  They also added popped rice into the batter for the shrimp tempura which was not my favorite either.  The vegetable tempura was not bad--green beans, asparagus, avocado, mushrooms, and I believe some kind of thin piece of root but it was so hard, I could not bite through it.  At $18, $1 less than my Sushi Lunch Set, I found this as the most overpriced appetizer I've ever encountered.  Although there were 3 pieces of shrimp and a good amount of veggies, I still don't see the justification at charging the price of an entree.  \n\n3) 2/5 The Ontama Sukiyaki Donburi (beef donburi) was a nice and large portion, however, it was also unfortunately very bland.  Donburi is my go-to Japanese dish when ordering for my children because if they don't feel like eating the meat, they'd gladly just eat the rice with the delicious sauce.  However, my son did not enjoy it at all since it was dry and the sukiyaki beef was too chewy.  He had literally 2 bites and refused to eat anymore.  At $14, I couldn't just leave it so I took it to-go for his dad, the human-vacuum, will probably eat it for dinner later with no problem.\n\n4) 5/5 Service was awesome.  The servers were very nice, prompt, and checked on us consistently.  It was definitely full table service which is a nice surprise since most typical Japanese lunch spots have servers who are focused on rushing out orders rather than focusing on their customers. \n\n5) 5/5 Cleanliness/Decor was totally my style.  Very chic and appropriate decor that was not too busy or distracting.  I couldn't help but notice how nice their wooden chopsticks were as well as the dishware.  Yes, little things like this deserve mention when reviewing a restaurant.  They do make a difference in my dining experience and it's much appreciated when a restaurant takes that much care in choosing such small details.\n\nI am definitely coming back here for lunch when craving some good sashimi.  I would still try out their other entrees in the future but I really do hope that the restaurant will revamp their donburi sauce.", "author": "Ivy Z."}

Apparently, the same people who pick out the fish at Omakase also pick out the fish for Okane... good enough for me! We started the night off with the chef's oysters, which were absolutely divine. 6 oysters came out on ice, each with quail egg, uni, tomiko and ikura (flying fish/salmon egg), and a light drizzling of ponzu sauce. Seriously, perfect. \n\nAlthough it wasn't listed on the menu, we were told that we could still order the omakase (chef's choice)  for a set price of 80 bucks. The price is a little cheaper than the average SF sushi place, I think.\n\nThe first course that we got was the ankimo (monkfish liver) in ponzu sauce.  It came in 3 hearty portions of ankimo; I'm not generally a fan of ankimo, but the ponzu sauce that the ankimo came with was fantastic. The next dish we got was two large pieces of salmon belly and two pieces of maguro (tuna) sashimi. Both my date and I commented on how fresh and soft the fish was in comparison to some other places that give out sinewy, poorly cut pieces that you could tell have been frozen. The next 11 pieces that we got were all nigiri; nothing overly exotic: fatty tuna (almost literally melted in your mouth), Hamachi tuna, halibut, albacore,  Hokkaido scallop, squid, makarel, salmon, uni, unagi, and wagyu (given free courtesy of the chef!). The end of the meal ended with the option of tamago or black sesame ice cream. The black sesame ice cream was absolutely amazing, and a perfect ending to the meal.\n\nI normally like to liberally drown my sushi in soy sauce because 1) I love soy sauce  2) I'm an uncultured swine, but I will begrudgingly admit that the sushi was so perfect that nothing required soy sauce. The wagyu (some places don't season it properly, cook it too much, add too much other crap, but this piece was perfectly fat and cooked) and the chef's oysters honestly were so good that I was left speechless for a few minutes.\n\nSample Conversation:\nHer: \"Hey, these are reall-\"\nMe: \"I need a minute\"\nHer: \"Oh come o-\"\nMe: -audible moan-\n\nDefinitely come here and try it out!", "author": "Kevin Z."}

Our waitress was very friendly, but she messed up on our order twice....she wrote everything down and repeated our order so not sure how she can still mess up.\n\nThe food started off pretty good, than it got worse and we were over it. Pretty large selection of stuff to choose from. \n\nFried lotus root chips-these were good and I love anything fried\n\nAssorted chicken skewers-the size of these were pretty big, tender, and flavorful\n\nChicken wings with spicy mayo and shiso salt-perfectly fried and the shiso salt made it very yummy\n\nBeef tataki with ponzu gelee-looked amazing, but super bland. \n\nSalmon and ikura chazuke with a tea soup-bland, bland, bland. We had to put some soy sauce to make it taste better\n\nSalmon and avocado-it was part of their special fish. It looks like salmon sashimi wrapped around avocado. Not sure what was so special about this\n\nThe ankimo was really good. We ordered a few nigiris and sashimi pieces came out instead. We told our waitress so the rest of wouldn't be a mistake. The sashimi was only ok. Nothing special. Not bad, but not super fresh. They also ran out of alot of things. \n\nWe ordered 2 rolls, but only received one. Snow crab, avocado, topped with A5 wagu beef, fired garlic, and sancho pepper-first you can't put A5 wagu beef on the menu if that's not what you are serving. It was tough and so bland. Isn't this suppose to melt in your mouth? SMH.\nThe waitress forgot the to put in the other roll. We were too full and didn't want it anymore since we knew it was going to be bland anyways. Need to work out some kinks still and improve on the flavor of their food.", "author": "Karen H."}

My boyfriend and I came in for lunch, hoping for some friendlier prices, but be warned that the lunch menu is still relatively expensive. I had the chicken teriyaki bento, which came with salad, an assortment of pickled veggies, and rice. The chicken reminded me of home, not at all like the sticky sweet teriyaki you would think of. The portions were just right to keep me full but not feel overstuffed. My boyfriend had the beef sukiyaki, which came in a claypot with an assortment of veggies and meat in a flavorful broth. We also tried the agedashi tofu and chawanmushi, both of which were cooked perfectly. My only complaint would be that both were slightly lacking in salt. All in all, it felt like a fancy home-cooked meal, and I'd definitely come back again.", "author": "Ashley T."}

We came here Saturday evening of July 4th weekend around 7 PM and were seated immediately without a reservation. It was not super crowded, but had a good amount of people inside. We got the Chicken Karaage, Hokkaido Uni, Shinjuku Roll, and Beef Sukiyaki. The sukiyaki was good at first, but once you eat more, is a bit too salty. The karaage was really tender on the inside and crispy on the outside, and the Hokkaido uni was really good as well--it tasted super fresh! But the Shinjuku was definitely the highlight. The wagyu beef on top was perfect: slightly smokey, great flavor. Really high quality sushi for a non-ridiculous price.

All of them were delicious. The toro was a higher quality cut that looked marbled and tasted like meat. Price-wise it's extremely good. Sanraku charges about $14 for a 2-piece nigiri of toro that is definitely low quality. $18 here at Okane is worth it if you've never had toro like this before.\n\nExtremely friendly wait-staff.

And then I learned that they share the supplier with the Michelin star rated Omakase next door. #winning \n\nMy friend and I made the mistake of walking into Omakase like two bozos before finding out Okane was one door down. Note Omakase is tiny, dimly lit, quiet, and most likely reservations-only.. \n\n\"Uh... Can we get a table for two?\"\n\"Do you have a reservation\" \n\"No.. Is this Okane?\"\n\nA friendly Japanese female server kindly let us know Okane is one door down.\n\nApologies for the disruption, fine diners.\n\nWhen we got to Okane, it couldn't have been more different than Omakase. Bright, no smell of a Michelin star, people eating mostly rolls. Well, the meal was theirs to lose after THAT resetting of expectation! \n\nIm happy to say Okane completely delivered and exceeded far exceeded our drastically lowered  expectation. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu - a huge plus given I brushed him off in my mind at first for being a white dude. My bad.\n\n\nChicken karaage - 3.5 stars. Deliciously crispy, well seasoned, a little too oily for me \n\nMackerel karaage - 4 stars. Quality fish not over cooked. Nicely balanced with the grated daikon and jalape\u00f1o mixture\n\nBok choy with sesame sauce - 4 stars. Perfectly cooked bok choy and delicious sesame sauce. We ended up asking for more bok choy because there was way more sauce than bok choy\n\nHamachi sashimi - 4 stars. Fresh. High quality, buttery sashimi. No real wasabi though\n\nShinjuku roll - 5 stars. This was for sure the highlight of the meal. Real crab meat and avocado roll topped with AMAZING pieces of seared wagyu beef. Melted in my mouth. I'd go back just for this roll. Note this is a pricey dish ($25). The server let us know the beef is sourced from the same supplier that Omakase uses. I always judge roll eaters but damn, I'm all in for this one.

Sashimi fish here were incredibly fresh, the server told me they source their fish from Tsukiji..makes sense!\n\nSaba karaage? I've been to many Japanese restaurant and have never heard of anyone deep frying Saba, so I gave it a try and both presentation and taste was great.\n\nShrimp arare tempura? The tempura was huge, which is good because we were hungry. Arare rice cracker gave it some unique and distinct texture to it, avocado tempura threw me off first but taste was actually great.\n\nOcean trout sashimi was one of their special so we gave it a shot. Sashimi was thick and tasted amazing. I believe they put truffle oil on them. We ordered few other sashimi and they were all much better quality than what I've had in many other restaurants. Menu had some fish I've never seen in other places too.\n\nOKANE HANDROLL was out of this world, a must try if you're into uni. It's basically a handroll with sea urchin, salmon roe and shiso leaf and salmon skin? Such a great idea for a handroll!! Little pricey for a handroll but I ordered a second one after eating the first one, just take my money!\n\nWith a bottle of small sake, bill came out to about $150 for 2 people, not too bad for the experience, we ate a lot of food.\n\nOverall I'd like to give this place a 5 star.\nService is good.\nFood is great.\nAtmosphere is good.\nAnd lastly, their black sesame ice cream.. was crazy good.", "author": "Mario K."}

We sat at the bar and I'm so glad we did! \n\nFor nigiri, my friend and I ordered the toro and sake belly which were both delicious. The fatty tuna melted in my mouth as expected. We also ordered the Ginza and Shinjuku roll but the one that stood out more was the Shinjuku roll which had snow crab, avo, and torched A5 wagyu. Who doesn't love wagyu?!  \n\nThe chef at the bar recommended to us try Hakkaku (sailfin poacher) which was a fish I've never heard of before. It's a three course set that prepares the Hakkaku three ways. Since he said it was their special of the day, we decided to give it a try. The first course was a beautifully presented sashimi platter of Hakkaku along with the body of the fish. It came with about 15 pieces which was a pretty good amount for the two of us. The second course was the crispy skin of the fish which I thought tasted like chips! And lastly, we ended the meal with a fish broth soup which was soooo yummy! There were fish bones, tofu and all these different herbs in it. We were super stuffed, but our chef gave us tamago and their homemade white sesame ice cream on the house! I've never had white sesame ice cream before but it was honestly the best sesame ice cream I've ever had. I realized as I was biting into their tamago that it's the same one that Omakase serves as well!

The black cod appetizer is to die for and fresh fish variety is very good. Knowledgeable and very friendly staff with good sake selection. I would give them 6 stars if I could :) Highly recommend this place!!!", "author": "Galina R."}

The fish here is extremely fresh and delicious and the small plates were great. The karaage is a must try. We split one plate and ended up ordering 2 more. The grilled shiitakes were also really good.\n\nOur favorite sushi were the various bellies - toro, salmon belly (special that night), one other I forget. They were out of aji, but had shima-aji which was just as delicious. The ginza and shinjuku rolls are great. The toched A5 on the shinjuku is just as extravagant as it sounds. We also had the harajuku and asakusa which were great, but I'm sure any of them would be great. The fish is fresh and the combinations go well.\n\nThey have a good sake list and we tried a few different bottles which our server recommended. When someone said they wanted nigori, she guided us to a not-too sweet one which really hit the spot.\n\nOther things: easy to get to, ample parking, 90s hip-hop playing non-stop. Its a fun spot with good food, will definitely be back.", "author": "Derek P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-07-18", "description": "My dinner there was mediocre at best.  Even though they are a sister restaurant to Omakase next door, the quality of the fish and the sushi/sashimi preparation are nowhere close.  The other items: soup, salads, cooked fish, are likewise entirely uninspired.  Many better choices in SF for Japanese.", "author": "Alex S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-07-17", "description": "My friend and I decided to try this spin-off of Omikase on a weekday night, and we both ordered the chef's sashimi sampler.  The fish quality was just ok - some pieces tasted fine, while others were not so fresh.  I thought it was maybe just me, but my friend felt the same way.  As a chef's choice sampler, the chef can choose whatever cuts of fish he would like to serve.  Given that he chose to serve fish that wasn't that fresh is disappointing. In addition, a bowl of rice was not included and was an additional five dollars.  Hence, two stars.", "author": "Eric W."}

From the Agedashi Tofu to their sushi rolls - excellent. We ate their once in person and thought the service was mediocre but the chef is fantastic. The service is the only reason I did not give it a 5 star. Maybe it was just that day, but the servers and host were confused and kind of disorganized. The food made up for it.", "author": "Faisal M."}

I called to order something for lunch and they had some overly complex reason as to why I can't place an order and would need to dine in instead despite being stated as having take out as an option on Yelp. Very disappointing, overly complicated - I'll take my business elsewhere.", "author": "Elisabeth H."}

The food was all fresh, the place is clean, feels upscale, and the servers are nice. I was able to walk in around 6 on a Friday and just sat at the 5 seat sushi bar alone with some tables open. It got a little busy afterwards and most people had reservations.  Will definitely come back.", "author": "daniel h."}

I came here for dinner with another person on a Monday night and the restaurant was mostly full, but wasn't too crowded and we were seated right away. The service was attentive and pleasant right off the bat. The server brought water and told us the specials and took our order, then brought sushi garnishes in pretty little plates to the table (the usual stuff: soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi). We ordered three dishes- the hamachi kama (sp?), which turned out to be a collar of hamachi grilled and served with ponzu, the harajuku roll, and the chicken karaage. All were attractive and pretty delicious. The details were done right- the hamachi was seasoned into the crevices and tasted like it was grilled over charcoal, the karaage was very very hot and fresh, and the harajuku roll had a lot of accents that didn't feel gimmicky (the lotus root chips on top were seasoned and spicy and were a really delicious garnish).  Portions felt a little light for the price (50$ for a light dinner for 2 people, no beverages), but not unreasonable.", "author": "Allison W."}

Very fair priced plates (especially for the same expertise from the owner of the Michelin Starred Omakase). The owner/head chef Jackson came out and made sure our meals were to satisfaction and that we were enjoying our time. Really cool atmosphere and super friendly wait staff, I will definitely be coming back.", "author": "Stevie J."}
