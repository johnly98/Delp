For how delicious this place is, I was surprised the place didn't fill up completely by the time our meal was wrapped up. We'll definitely be coming back! \n\nThe Good: \nBanchan was amazing. I'm picky about kimchi and Stone Bowl's kimchi was perfect. It was sour/umami, not watery. It was crunchy & fresh, not soggy and mushy. \n\nWe ordered several variations of the soft tofu soup bowl, and all were equally amazing. My favorite was the beef tofu soup with mushroom as an extra add-on. While this didn't take away from the tofu soup, I was disappointed that they don't seem to do different levels of spiciness. Even though I requested spicy, it came out mild. It also wasn't salty enough but adding a little bit of soy sauce from the condiments on the table fixed that. Nonetheless, it was so good that I'd come back and order the same thing again! \n\nThe kimchi pancake was also a favorite at our table. \n\nI couldn't tell if it was because the tofu soup was particularly hot or if the restaurant is just warm, but I was definitely feeling uncomfortably hot by the end of the meal.", "author": "Yuchen L."}

Unfortunately, this place is a little on the higher end price-wise, so we only come here so often. It's a very clean restaurant with a beautiful interior. I feel like they had an uplift with furniture and paint inside recently, but can't verify that. \n\nTheir side dishes are pretty good, usually it's the kimchee, radish, broccoli, and fish cakes. The waitresses are usually pretty nice about refilling it if you want extra. I usually order their spicy pork with rice on the side and it's nothing special to any Korean restaurant standards but very good. Their bibimbap in the white bowl is a healthy alternative to their stone bowl version. It's interesting cuz they had kale in it but it mixes pretty well with the rice, egg, and other condiments. Their army stew is great on a cold SF day to warm you up. It's your typical bowl with spam, noodles, and rice cakes. If you're in the area and craving Korean food with the notion already that you'll be spending at least $20 per person, try this place!", "author": "Ada C."}

The six of us were seated quickly on a Saturday night around 6:30pm.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n- Soft tofu stew: my favorite! The tofu is soft and flavorful and I cannot get enough broth. Tastes perfectly with white rice. You can choose it with mushroom, kimchi, beef, seafood or combo\n- Army stew: hodge pot of ramen, ham, sausage, kimchi, etc. A little spicy\n- Bimbimbap with vegetables: you need to add some hot sauce for flavor\n- Spicy pork: I did not try\n- Rice cakes under appetizer\n- Seafood pancake: I was a little disappointed because the pancake is not very chewy or crunchy. It is more on the soft side\n\nService was ok. Our waitress checked in us once during the meal and that was all.\n\nI was disappointed at the side dishes for both quantity and quality. Of course you can ask for more but if there were only three tiny pieces of broccoli for a party of six, you may feel my feel. The flavors were not outstanding as well.

Plus they don't offer the croaker fried fish. \n\nThe side dishes were fine. Nothing amazing but no complaints.

This bibimbap came not only with a good amount of seafood, it also came with a ton of veggies with a runny egg on top. The egg wasn't too runny but I was really impressed with the seafood and veggies. Make sure to use the gochujang sauce in the red tube that they give you!\n\nI thought everything tasted really fresh and really tasty.

This new Korean spot is in the Lower Haight right across the street from Wonderland and Cafe International, and you shouldn't let the generic name fool you even though most of their entrees involve one.

Usually, tofu soup at other flavors would just be spicy without any flavoring but this place was tasty. Also, places usually make their tofu soup with so much water that there's barely any tofu or seafood, but this place made it thick with so much tofu and so much seafood. This place has the best tofu soup, hands down. \n\nTheir stonepot vegetable bimbimbap was also a good choice. The vegetables included a really sweet yellow pickled radish, kale, beanspouts, and carrots. It had so much vegetables that compliments the sauce and crispy rice really well. And I was really happy to hear that they could substitute the purple rice for plain white rice. A TIP when eating a vegetable bimbimbap: use the complimentary fish cake dish as meat for your bibimbap, it saves both your money and adds meat to your rice! \n\nI also decided to settle on a meat dish and got the bulgolgi. This was not something I would get again simply because everything else that I order was so flavorful, but the meat dish was disappointing. It lacked flavors and wasn't what I expected.

The menu is smaller than a traditional joint: it really focuses on serving bibimbap, a stone pot stir fry with mixed veggies (and optional protein). Personally, I think the pricing is a bit steep for bibimbap ($13 for the basic, $17 with chicken $19 with beef). For other dishes, prices are in the mid-to-high $20 range, which is pretty high for grilled meat with some veggies.\n\nThe food was pretty good: one of the most authentic and variety friendly bibimbaps that I have had.

The menu is extensive, prices are pretty good, and the ambiance is cozy and sweet. A perfect date spot. What I love about this place, and other Korean restaurants, is the banchan- 10 or so complimentary little plates of yummy little plates of pickled vegetables and other things that get REFILLED as you finish them! As far as entrees go, we always get their special Galbijjim, a sizzling bowl of beef stew with glass noodles, carrots, daikon, chew rice rolls. This dish is so insanely good, we've ordered it every single time.  While it's the most expensive item on the menu, it's perfect for 2 to share! \n\nThere are a lot of restaurants in the Lower Haight that come and go, and I hope Stonebowl isn't one of them.", "author": "Nicole H."}

If you ever need some good, hearty food to warm your soul then this is where it is on Haight Street. The staff is very welcoming, friendly and just over all naturally happy people. Props to Jenny who had amazing service and great suggestions! Another waitress was helping her as well, I didn't get her name  but she had short hair and she was also just as friendly and gracious!! I ordered the Galbijjim and it seriously was the best Korean Stew I've eaten! The meat fell right of the bone and the sauce was amazing! My boyfriend got the Bibimbap which was also really good! (if you mix the Bibimbap with the Galbijjim it's even more amazing!) I will definitely be coming back to try more of the soups!!", "author": "Nicole D."}

It's a little expensive, but the food is good enough to make it into my rotation of restaurants in the area. \n\nStarted off with the japchae, which was both the most enjoyable dish and the best value ($4 for a pretty solid amount of food). I think 2x japchae might be a viable dinner option; looking forward to experimenting with that. \n\nThe banchan were pretty good, especially the seaweed. I might have liked a little more kimchi. \n\nKalbi bibimbap in the eponymous stone bowl was exactly what I was looking for on a chilly night. The short ribs were well-seasoned, and the various vegetables were appreciated. My only gripe was that it's a little pricey at $19 -- guess rent in the neighborhood is pretty expensive, though. \n\nThey're still working out some of the service kinks -- I had to ask for water twice (once more than the drought regulations require!), and they didn't bring out any gochujang with the bibimbap until we explicitly requested it. The waitstaff is super friendly, though, and I have to imagine all that stuff will improve in the coming weeks.", "author": "Ryan D."}

We had booked a show in SF, and I looked for Korean food.  I happen to really like dolsot bibimbap.  I figured with a name of stone bowl, their bibimbap better be damn good.  \n\nIt's a very clean and somewhat stylish restaurant.  Prices are pretty expensive for what you get and to add-on meat.  Don't order ramen, its lackluster, with very artificial broth and noodles. \n\nI ordered dolsot bibimbap with spicy pork.  I enjoyed it, but I feel like there wasn't enough oil in the bottom or the bowl wasn't hot enough, cuz i didn't get enough burning.... \n\nBanchan selection is meagre, and they only offer to fill up your banchan once.  The first time they brought out kimchi.. there was like 2 pieces, not kidding.  I immediately asked them to fill it up, and they brought a nice big patty.  Stil.... sorta stingy.  This is a like a mom and pop place, but they don't charge mom and pop prices, and the hospitality didn't feel generous.  Not planning to visit again.\n\nI feel bad leaving a lackluster review, but I just wasn't impressed with what I received.", "author": "Alex S."}

This is homestyle Korean, not too greasy but very comforting.  True to their name, there were many stone bowl options.  My companion ordered the beef bowl and enjoyed it.\n\nService is nice and friendly, though still a little bumpy from being so new.  I saw one of the waiters literally answer questions about the entire menu for more than 5 minutes, which has to be commended.  \n\nAn extremely extensive wine and Soju list made me sort of want to order some alcohol just to take advantage of it.  \n\nOther highlights include mom style kimchi fried rice, and delicious/trashy army stew (with spam and instant ramen noodles!
