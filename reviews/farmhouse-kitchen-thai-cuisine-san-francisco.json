You can choose between your choice of tofu, minced pork, pork, or chicken, but I *highly* recommend the minced pork option. Farmhouse is the only place I know that serves it with minced pork, and trust... it's amazing. I've also ordered their Pad Se Ew multiple times on Caviar, and it tastes equally amazing delivered. Not to mention, portions are extremely generous and it hits the spot for all your late night cravings. \n\nTheir cocktails are also delicious, one-of-a-kind, and aesthetically beautiful. I started off with one Summer Spritz (ingredients: Aperol, Sparkling Wine, Pressed Grapefruit, Lemongrass Simple) and ended up ordering three glasses. It's light, fruity, and not too strong or sweet - the perfect \"girly\" cocktail. \n\nThis place is always packed, so make sure you make a reservation beforehand or walk-in before 6pm! I came here at 5:30pm on a Friday night and didn't have to wait, but the place definitely filled up by 6pm.", "author": "Cindy L."}

Haven't tried anything that wasn't delicious. \n\nThis place has sister restaurants in Oakland and Portland. The atmosphere and staff def reminds me a lot of the places we visited in Portland. Reservations are not hard to get and if you come early when they open, the place is empty and you get seated right away. The staff is super helpful, but sometimes it can be hard to get their attention depending on where you sit. A lot of the tables are close together so be prepared to get cozy! The table next to us was basically face first in our fried chicken trying to stare at what we were eating. \n\nWe ordered the pad see ew with pork. If you add certain proteins there is an upcharge. This dish has a lot of flavor and you can taste the \"wok hai\" which is the taste of the pan. I've ordered this spicy and non-spicy. Be careful as their spicy is CRAZY spicy. Like mouth numbing. They also offer a holder full of sauces. Try the house made one, tasty and makes your mouth feel like it's on fire. \n\nWe also ordered the Hat Yai Chicken which is their signature fried chicken with yellow curry, roti, and blue jasmine rice. The portions for this dish are generous and enough to share. The blue rice is cool but doesn't taste any different than white rice, but it was BOMB with the curry. The roti was placed on top of the fried chicken so it was slightly soggy, but still great with the curry. Def a must try!\n\nWe rounded out our experience with their bread pudding as dessert. Theirs comes in a muffin shape with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. It comes out hot and delicious! Not too sweet and not too soggy.\n\nThe best part is the quality is consistent. Every time I've visited I've left satisfied and full. Great place to visit if you're craving Thai food.", "author": "Junella T."}

The dishes came out sooner than we expected given how crowded the restaurant was and the food tasted decent, but was honestly nothing special and did not stand out as being any better than the hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurants I normally go to.\n\nWhat drove me absolutely crazy about this place was, every 20 minutes a crowd of employees would run around the already very loud restaurant banging on (what sounded like pots and pans) celebrating the birthdays in the room.\n\nI had a bad headache and this made want to curl into a ball and cry hopelessly. It didn't happen once, not twice, but THREE times during the course of our dinner.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the portion sizes of the food we ordered were a complete joke and considering the average price of the dishes we ordered were $20+, there was no excuse for this. I want to say each person in our party had maybe two large table spoons of fried rice before we were scraping the bottom of the plate.\n\nI left this restaurant hungry, absolutely miserable from the excessive noise, and I had to pick up a $35 bill BEFORE tip (meaning our total bill was $140 for four dishes).\n\nIt's possible it was just an off night, but I left so remorseful of this restaurant pick, you can bet I'll never return here again.", "author": "Nima A."}

I ended up ordering the Hat Yai fried chicken (~$23). My friend ordered the 24-hour broth. We also ordered a dessert to share. The fried chicken was SO good. It comes with Thai fried chicken, roti, rice, and curry. I can't even express how delicious the curry was! I think this was large enough for 1 people to share. I was stuffed! Oh, and the 24-hour broth.. so delicious! \n\nI suggest asking for their spices if you like spicy food. the Godmother really adds a special kick to your food. \n\nIf it's someone's birthday, a whole group of the servers come out and sing to you while playing the drums. It's really entertaining! However, they still charge for the dessert.. \n\nThe beers are kind of expensive ($7-11) for a can.

The restaurant has been pretty busy so if you come during prime time dinner hours, I'd recommend making a reservation in advance or plan on waiting 30+ min.\n\nThe menu is expansive, and gives you a variety of apps, salads, entrees, noodles and soups. I personally like the variety available, but it can be overwhelming to others. I've been here a few times now and would recommend two entrees: 1.) The Panang Neau, a fall-off-the-bone short rib served over blue rice with broccoli I spears. I usually eat half and save the other half for leftovers, but don't be surprised if you don't want to share and eat it all.  The meat is just so tender! 2.) The Hat Yai Fried Chicken, fried chicken with an Indian asian flare, served with to roti (similar to an Indian style tortilla), this delish potato curry sauce, blue rice. The dish is flexible giving you options to mix and match each bite...mix it all together, eat it similar to a taco...you can't go wrong bc the flavors just work! \n\nAs for other items: expect A LOT of spice in the papaya salad (they note it's spicy on the menu). The mieng salmon is supposed to be wrapped but the way they present the filet works better eating as is. The Neua Yang steak has a great presentation (they light it on fire in front of you...see my video), but I felt the alcohol either didn't burn off or they marinated it in the rum bc it overpowered the taste of the meat. Also not as tender as I expected it to be. Looking for a fun drink? Get their Thai iced drink, it looks like a snow cone with the mound of shaved ice when it comes out.\n\nLooking to celebrate a special occasion? The staff comes out banging a drum and shaking cups of silverware...it's so loud, everyone in the restaurant will know you're turning 50, 32, or 21 (there seem to be a lot of celebrations when we go, lol).", "author": "Amber H."}

This is coming from someone who lived within walking distance of quite a number of decent Thai restaurants in the city too.  We came here after we got shafted from a supposed lunch omakase at a nearby sushi restaurant, and thankfully this place did not disappoint!  The things we tried included:\n\nChicken and Waffles:\nPROS:\n- great quantity, definitely enough to share and take some home if you get other dishes\n- good balance between chicken and waffles\n- chicken was not too greasy\n- curry/dipping sauce had great flavor: it's good to put it on the side because it allows the patron to dip or pour as much of it as they would like.\n- also comes with a side of rice so get your carbs on!\nCONS:\n- breading on some chicken pieces were a bit too heavy: it's not your standard \"fried chicken\" (see picture)\n\nPapaya Salad: definitely one of the dishes that I use to gauge how good a Thai restaurant is.\nPROS:\n- fantastic quantity: I was almost 1/3 full just by nibbling on this before our main orders came out\n- good balance between all the ingredients: I am a fan of the sliced grape tomatoes\nCONS:\n- a bit on the tart end but nothing that I would say is a true con\n\nPad See Ew (Thai Street Food): their meat options for this section on their menu is AMAZING.  I ordered this with the house crispy pork belly and that's what sold me on giving this 5 stars.\nPROS:\n- great quantity: definitely shareable\n- not mushy noodles: it's hard to do fried rice-noodles without overcooking the noodles or having them break apart on you.  These are perfectly done!\n- CRISPY PORK BELLY IS GOLD: this literally made the dish.  My friend also agreed hands down.\n- well balanced in flavor and not super greasy\nCONS:\n-NONE\n\nI also ordered the typical Thai Iced Tea - it was super nice how it came with a perfect ice ball on top.  Service was 100% on top, never had to ask for a refill and only for the check.  I would definitely come back here again.

Expect to pay around $18-30 for a dish with very generous portions! Must eats: Hat Yai Fried Chicken.\n\nAmbiance:\nDon't expect a quiet dining experience here; the music is turned up quite loud and it can get hard to hear your dining companions at peak hours. However, the restaurant is bustling with energy, and sometimes servers will walk around offering snacks (like fried grasshoppers!) on little platters. The restaurant is decorated in bright, bold colors, though it's a bit dimly lit. \n\nFood:\nThough the Panang Neua is delicious, the Hat Yai Fried Chicken never ceases to blow me away. I like to order new dishes every time, but I'll make an exception for the Hat Yai. It's so simple yet delicious; the chicken breast is so tender it cuts like butter, and somehow Farmhouse Thai perfectly fries it to have a perfect crunch. Paired with the potato yellow curry with blue rice and the wonderfully flaky and buttery roti, it's a beautifully balanced set in a generous portion. \n\nThe Neua Num Tok Rolls (cilantro/mint/cucumber wrapped in wagyu beef strips) were made with very tender wagyu beef, but the standout for me was the cilantro-lime vinaigrette drizzled on top. The aroma and tang of the vinaigrette perfectly balances the richness of the beef. \n\nThe Panang Curry has the slightest bit of kick to it, and the aromas are so rich and delightful. The beef add-in didn't do much for the flavor or experience of the curry; I'd skip since the beef itself wasn't that exciting and a bit chewy.", "author": "Jen R."}

They give a pretty good amount of food, but still not quite worth the price. This place gets full so you either need reservations or plan on waiting a little bit. We got lucky cause they squeezed us in to eat for 1 hr since the table was reserved.\nDespite the price, I tried the basics and they were all very good.\n\nPad Thai - just the right texture and I enjoyed the flavors. It wasn't like other places that make it super saucey and ketchupy. It was dry, but in a good way, and a little sweet, but with the lime it balanced out nicely. \n\nThai fried rice - solid fried rice. Rice texture was on point, not mushy. The only bad part was the meat seemed a bit on the dry side (this one in a bad way). But it smelled great and tasted great.\n\nMieng salmon - they're like lettuce wraps. They gave two large pieces of salmon with vermicelli, veggies, and some type of sauce that went so well with it all. Thoroughly enjoyed this dish.\n\nPapaya salad - very spicy for myself but still really refreshing and had good fish sauce to go with it.\n\nI do want to come back and try some of the other special/more unique dishes but that'll probably also have to be for a special occasion when I'm feelin like spending some money.", "author": "Rachelle C."}

Their dishes though at least for my friends and I were not cleaned thoroughly, double check your utensils before using!! As for the food: \n\nTom yum: Everyone has their preferences, I thought flavoring was just right for me. Good balance of sour and spicy.\nHat Yai: Best dish out of all of them, price wise too. Fried chicken was super crispy, rice was cooked right, and the roti and curry were on point. \nPad Kee Mow: Good spice, but so oily and so little portions. There were barely any noodles and I added the \"Wagyu beef\" for another $2 totaling to a known basic Thai noodle dish to $17 dollars. They had this under the \"street food\" options in the menu which I thought was very ironic.\nEggplant with sticky rice (side): Eggplant was cooked unevenly, some were still raw in the middle.\nThai Tea: Literally Thai tea with a huge ball of just ice shaved iced. You're paying another $2 for hella ice..\n\nOverall, nothing stood out to me for me to give this place another try. There are soo many other more authentic and quality Thai places in SF.

And is legit spicy!\n\nI'm not sure exactly what our friend ordered but here's my best description of the dishes below:\n\n* Leaf-Wrapped Salmon - 3.5 stars\nSoft texture, interesting with a pesto-like sauce. I do like my salmon a little pink and undercooked, so I would've preferred that. But the leaf keeps the filet nice and moist.\n\n* Yellow curry w/ eggplant, string beans - 3.5 stars\nGreat flavor, and love the crunch to the veggies, but wow this is spicy!\n\n* Spring Rolls - 3 stars\nFine but a bit plain/boring compared to the other dishes!\n\n* Beef w/ Rice - 4 stars\nLovely tender beef, really good quality cuts, and flavorful sauce.\n\n* Pad Thai - 4 stars\nSoft noodles, tons of great veggies.

Came by for a late lunch and most of their table were still full, must indicate their popularity :) We were seated pretty quickly (there is a person up front to check in with if there's a wait). They also do a lot of take out orders, so if you don't have time to dine in, that's also an option. They do take reservations, so if you have a decently sized party, it would be best to reserve. I hear they do fill up completely during peak hours. \n\nI've had the pad see you and pad spicy eggplant. The pad see you was pretty standard, good portion size, nothing super special. The eggplant was solid, not too salty or overly oily, though the flavors are pretty heavy. You can ask for mild spiciness too :D I got the eggplant with crispy pork belly, which was delicious. Each piece had some tenderness of the fatty part and then crispy in the lean parts. Good amount of pork belly for the extra $4 on top of the base dish price. Generally, their dishes have higher price tags than other other Thai places I've been too, but its decent for the food you get. \n\nService was pretty good, though they were a bit curt when taking our order. All in all, I would recommend Farmhouse if you're feeling Thai in the Mission area. Pretty decently sized restaurant as well.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

I loved the lively environment, how engaged and fun loving the staff is, and the psychedelic decor, but the food was somewhat of a disappointment.\n\nFirst up, why can't we make reservations on the phone? I called up to get a table for two, and was told that there would be a 45 minute wait no matter when we reached. The only way to make a reservation was through the Yelp app, and no slots were available for this particular day. This makes it a little cumbersome to check out this place on a whim!\n\nWe were turned off by the one hour plus wait when we got there, but were offered the choice of bar seating. Since it was just the two of us, and the bar has full service, we went with this option.\n\nThe food menu is extensive, grouped into appetizers, curries, noodle dishes, street food, and entrees and each dish is clearly explained. Pictures would've been helpful, as most of the entrees come with multiple components. Spicy dishes are marked as such, and it would have been great to have crowd favorites/chef recommendations marked as well. The drinks menu is almost as extensive as the food menu, with a dozen cocktails, beers, and wines.\n\nWe ordered the Hat Yai fried chicken meal and the \"Run Juan\" sizzling seafood platter. We also got a Thai-chelada (Thai version of a michelada) and a Tsingha beer.\n\nThe complimentary pickled salad that they serve before the food is so, so good! I finished the whole plate by myself and had to order for a second serving so that my dad could taste it as well.\n\nMy order of the fried chicken came within 10 minutes, but my dad's order took much longer, and we had almost finished my entree by then.\n\nHat Yai Fried Chicken - Southern Thai style fried chicken which comes with paratha, blue rice, yellow curry, pickled cucumbers, and a sweet ans spicy dipping sauce.The curry was really flavorful, and paired with the paratha would have made a perfectly adequate meal by itself. The blue rice was... well, blue. i couldn't detect any special flavor to it. The fried chicken was perfectly crisped, but was bland and a bit soggy on the inside, and no amount of the dipping sauce could remedy it. The portion was huge, and we struggled to finish it.\n\n\"Run Juan\" sizzling seafood platter - The platter consisted of shrimp, calamari, scallops, and some sort of catfish in a spicy peppery sauce, with green and red peppers and onions, and came with a side of white rice. This dish was much better, and I could've licked the platter clean, had it not been a burn hazard. My dad and I agreed that we should've only ordered this entree and tried out one of the appetizers.\n\nThe thai-chelada was eh. I ordered it because I've never had a michelada, so I didn't quite know what to expect, but it was sour and tangy and I was able to finish it, so I guess it was okay.\n\nAt several points of time during dinner, the staff emerged from the kitchen with with raucous birthday chants, some sort of a hat for the birthday celebrator, and a cake of some sort (?). That looked like a lot of fun, so if I lived in SF, I'd definitely want to celebrate a birthday here.\n\nService was attentive even though we were at the bar, and the bartender was very merry and chatty and made us feel like we were a part of the regular dining crowd.", "author": "Shivani P."}

It all looks so colorful and thoughtfully put together making me want to take a picture of everthing (and I'm not one of those people that is always taking pictures of food).  Many of the alcoholic drinks are garnished with flowers, so pretty and presentable.\n\nI'd recommend the Hat Yai fried chicken.  It comes with roti bread, curry, and the ever famous blue rice.  \n\nFarmhouse is a little more on the pricey side, not that it's overpriced but you aren't going to find something here $10 for lunch.

It's a risky statement, among hundreds of Thai places, some of them even holding Michelin Star accreditation (I'm lookin at you, Kin Khao). But you trust me right? Farmhouse is theeee best. I am convinced this spot will satisfy picky eaters and Thai-food enthusiasts alike. This is THE spot, y'all.\n\nGET:\nThe Panang Neua - Slow braised bone-in short rib drenched in panang curry, ISSA GAME CHANGER. I could drink the sauce alone with a straw. The meat falls off the bone, melts in your mouth, and launches your mind into a blissful state of euphoria. If you pass up on this dish, I feel sorry for you.\n\nGET:\nThe Hat Yai Fried Chicken - I get cravings for this chicken every other day, it's THAT good. The chicken is fried with a light batter making it perfectly crispy without ruining the freshness of the chicken. It's comes in a huge platter surrounded by nasi kerabu, roti & yellow curry. Side note, contrary to popular belief the rice is blue from butterfly pea flowers, not smurf tears. Totally safe, totally delicious, totally worth it.\n\nGET:\nThe Neua Nom Tok Rolls - This appe'thai'zer was recommended by our server, and I will echo in his recommendation. One order comes with four beef rolls made with wagyu, mint, cilantro, cucumber, drenched in a yummy cilantro lime vinaigrette. Perfect portion size for 2 people.\n\nREGRET:\nThe Thai Tea. Great tea, ruined with too much ice. It comes served with a giant snowball balancing on the edge of the cup. I don't know who thought this was a good idea. Someone must have watched Frozen too many times. I do not want to build a snowman, and neither do I want any of it in my Thai tea. Anyway, it ended up being very watery, and I couldn't get past 2 sips. What a waste, but ya live and ya learn.\n\nAlready planning my next trip to Farmhouse.

It has so much to look at and that is a good thing because chances are, without a res, you'll be waiting a long time! Thankfully for us, there was a two seat opening right at the bar and it worked out that we were able to be seated right away! \n\nThe restaurant is known for its fried chicken. It's more of a Thai chicken and waffles, if I may, but the flavors feel so much more complex than just that. They have this super neat blue rice that accompanied the dish. The fried chicken is not dripping in oil, which I appreciate. It is served with some curry and potatoes with some leavened bread and oh my gosh is it good!!!!! It just all works so so well together. I have never had food like it. The sweetness from the honey dipping sauce, the crispiness of the fried chicken, and the soft bread, wow. It was so good! \n\nAnd we also split their herbed rice salad. Normally I order papaya salad, but have heard that is spicy. This dish, the herbed rice salad, is super flavorful and really delicious. It's unlike anything I have had too!

I also loved the vibe and ambience. THE AESTHETIC. It was beautifully decorated, bright and fun!\n\nWe started with the Neua Num Tok Rolls ($15.50) as our waitress recommended and I have no regrets. The wagyu beef was so tender and just melted in your mouth. It was wrapped with mint, cilantro and pickled cucumber, and served with a fragrant cilantro lime vinaigrette. \n\nI quickly browsed Yelp to see what I should order for my entree and the Hat Yai Fried Chicken ($21.50) stood out.

It's probably food coloring, but I dig it.\n\nMy friend ordered Panang Neua ($27.95) and that was perfectly cooked. It's a dish with their slow braised short rib in a rich panang curry with grilled broccolini, bell pepper, onion and fried basil. It also comes with a side of blue rice. It's the most expensive dish on the menu, but may possibly be worth it.\n\nFor dessert, we had the Farmhouse Bread Pudding ($10) with organic vanilla ice cream and caramel.

The braised short rib/ panang neua was also so perfect. The meat just falls right off the bone and getting a mix of the veggies made this dish a treat to eat.

The waiter had seated me (without greeting me) after leaving me hanging for about 10 mins at the door. Then, seated someone who came right after I did and seated the individual immediately and greeted him and took his order before me! Excuse me?! What is up with that. Am I an invisible Panda bear or something, geez... I used to serve plenty but c'mon it's common sense to go ahead and get the order and at least say \"hi.\" \n\nSecond off, I was told to hurry up and rush my order because the kitchen was going to close/shut down (still had just about an hour before closing lunch) with an unpleasant attitude and tone of voice. I understand, the servers are probably having a bad day or just don't want to be there but you're at work suck it up and leave the issues and nasty attitudes at home because I'm coming to pay for a service and food...\n\nAnd lastly, the food...the food was good but not phenomenal or anything marvelous. The presentation was very pretty so I'll give credit for that. I ordered the \"Hat Yai Fried Chicken.\" It's just about $22.50. It comes with fried organic chicken breast, roti bread, blue jasmine ice and yellow potato curry. The chicken was very tasty and well cooked. The curry was a bit disappointing as the temperature was more on the cold/warm side and very salty. But everything else was good! I recommend you try it. \n\nHopefully next time I come the service will improve and it will be better overall. I am willing to come give it another try.", "author": "Jessica K."}

The place has many tables and a very festive vibe.  Here's a breakdown on the food:\n\n1. Herbal Rice Salad - It's a complicated dish with almost 10 ingredients.  Definitely something I could not make at home!  Hearty dish, but not memorable enough to order again.\n2. Ahi Scoops - Great appetizer to share.  It comes with 4 pieces with the following layers: seared ahi tuna, cucumber, seaweed salad, crispy yam.  It's best to eat all in one bite!  The flavors meld well together and the crispy yam gives great texture to the dish.\n3. Khao Kha Moo - This was on the secret (or not so secret) menu of the day.  Braised fall off the bone pork, rice, vegetables, and boiled egg. The pork was very tasty, but unfortunately there were a lot of fatty pieces.  The dish came with a spicy sauce that I could not get enough of!  \n\nI enjoyed the different variety of Thai foods that this place offers, but felt that $35 a person (no drinks) was pretty steep for what we ordered.", "author": "Helen T."}

The rice was blue, but otherwise tasted pretty standard. A lot of fried stuff on the chicken, flavorful yet not too spiced. Curry was really flavorful, unique smell, I really enjoyed this. Didn't like that the potatoes were giant chunks but no biggie. Goes well with the chicken, a bit hard to eat as takeout food.\n\nAlso got an order of raita and a pork belly side. The raita is crispy, sweeter in nature, not as chewy as the one at Rangoon Ruby. The pork belly side was tiny but the taste was spot on, light without any sort of pork flavor, a bit too crunchy for my personal tastes but I thoroughly enjoyed the chewy parts.\n--\n\nEdit: Man it's a party in here! Came by for dinner with a friend, and I've never really used the word \"delightful\" to describe a restaurant's attitude toward customer service, but that's what this place felt like. Upon being greeted by a waiter in bright eye makeup and shiny clothing, we were promptly escorted to our seats. \n\nWe ordered the barbecue chicken and 24 hour beef noodle soup. They provide a plate of pickled veggies, which were tasty and refreshing on a hot day. Food arrived within 5 minutes of ordering, and portions were very generous (price point ~$20-25 for most dishes, with portion size being 1.5-2x your average portion). \n\nPickled veggies were in a light sweet vinegar. Crunchy-ish and a good way to stimulate the palate. There was a tiny fly buzzing around, which was annoying, but it eventually went away.\n\nThey portioned the beef noodle soup into 2 bowls for us. The broth was a very dark brown, and had an acidity to it that reminded me of Chinese black vinegar egg and pork knuckles. Didn't really taste too much of beef to me, but you could definitely tell that there was a lot of time and depth that had been put into the broth. The beef was tender (strippy kind) and fell apart easily. Noodles were the thin egg kind, and a bit less memorable to me. [Edit: Upon eating leftovers, the broth was still a bit sour but less vinegary] 3.5/5.\n\nThe barbecue chicken (half) came on a giant skewer, with a healthy portion of green papaya salad on the side. The chicken and the skin were both pretty moist. The papaya salad was fresh and well seasoned. The sticky rice was a bit dry and very sticky. 3.5/5.\n\nAtmosphere-wise, this was a blast. One of the waiters came through halfway with a carrying pole balancing two baskets, asking people if they wanted to try the special of the day (coconut worms). She had a bicycle horn she beeped to get peoples' attention. All the staff came out with various musical instruments to celebrate another patron's birthday. You could tell that they truly delighted in their jobs, which is always a plus.", "author": "Nicole H."}

The first time was as a function of needing food after boozing in the area, and Farmhouse came up on Yelp as close enough to stumble to. Thanks, yelp!\n\nThat time, I don't remember as much of the food as I did the environment. It was super dark (or my eyes were blurry from the booze). I had a relatively positive feel, and remember it being super loud there.  I do remember a fried pork thing in a dipping sauce (and a quick look at old pictures show that it DOES INDEED EXIST), which was delicious. Pretty sure we had some other noodle stuff, which was solid. I did mention that was a while ago, and I had been drinking, right??\n\nThe second time I went was more recent, and was for an early dinner. So I remember it all, and well!\n\nCalamari - I'd skip unless you just need something fried (but then...go with the pork I remember). The squid was thick cuts of the rights, beer battered and fried. It was good, but not very special.\n\nKao Soi: Since having this in Chiang Mai, I've ordered it EVERYWHERE I've gone. But, alas, nowhere is as good as Chiang Mai. So grain of salt. This one was solid, and I liked the pickled veggies thrown in there. The balance of the noodles to soup was good, though I'd like a smidge more of the crunchy noodles. The soup was of a good flavor and salt for me to drink too.\n\n24 hours beef noodle soup: This was crazy good. A little extra salty, but really delicious. I would bathe in that soup if I could. Or, maybe that's a waste of good broth. It was good. Worth the 2x cost for the noodles.\n\nBoth times I was here, I saw them bring out birthday celebrations and the kitsch goodness I mentioned before.

A group of friends and I had reservations here for 6:30 on a Tuesday night, and the place was already filled with energy and lots of humans ready for some dinner.\n\nI immediately noticed that the decor and ambience were unlike most restaurants: A tall blue wall was along the back of the room covered with rows of hose nozzles, there were plants hanging from the ceiling, television sets on one wall near the bar, and colorfully-clad waiters and waitresses in large hats and huge smiles on their faces sauntered about. \n\nThe menu *really* impressed me, though. Which is probably what you're reading this for!\n\nFarmhouse Thai's menu features an array of colorful cocktail mixes, and each is presented in a cheerfully gaudy manner that will make you beam when it's placed in front of you. Fair warning: It'll also make you want to try everyone else's drink at the table. \n\nMy drink recommendation: The Mama-san, made of unfiltered sake, red wine, lemongrass, lemon, and orange bitters. I'm also a sucker for a drink with a flower in it, and the Mama-san made that happen.\n\nAppetizer recommendations: Some waiters were walking around with what looked like mini hot air balloons, but in the baskets were different appetizers and foods to try. We saw fried chicken in one of the displays, which we ordered and tasted fantastic. I love this idea: Show me and let me smell your best treats, and I'll probably give in. We also ordered spring rolls which I will ALWAYS eat, and a rice salad complete with blue rice (!!!). \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the beef salad. The waiter told me it'd be \"slightly spicy\" and asked if that was alright, to which I responded, \"yes, that'd be fine!\" Unfortunately I do not understand my own tolerance for spicy foods and it was a little spicier than I personally prefer... but I was warned! I mixed in some rice to spread out the spiciness a bit (if that's a thing? I'm bad at science.) But I was able to handle the dish a little better after that. The beef was juicy, the vegetables were cooked perfectly, and my Mama-san went perfectly with the meal. Yay!\n\nLast but not least, dessert. There were several instances throughout the night in which the staff would emerge from the kitchen with a giant dessert platter, dancing and singing \"happy birthday\" to people at various tables. One of the people in my own party had a birthday coming up in the next few days, and someone was slick and made a birthday celebration happen at our table. This meant we got a lovely, upbeat song and dance, along with a mouthwatering dessert platter that included watermelon, chocolate lava cake, coconut shaved ice cream, and my absolute favorite, BREAD PUDDING. If you want just one dessert recommendation, bread pudding would be my go-to rec here! \n\nAnd finally, I always say I'm a sucker for a good aesthetic, and Farmhouse Thai's bathroom is a part of that fun aesthetic. I'm not sorry for pointing out how great the bathroom is! The walls are painted rainbow and there's a cute mini ladder that doubles as a toilet paper holder. There's only one toilet so lock the door behind you when you walk in, but there are two sinks because I think it used to be a multi-toilet bathroom. I tried to take a selfie but then I realized I was taking a selfie next to a toilet. But if I were good at taking selfies, this would be an ideal spot.

This well-known Thai eatery packs 'em in and pleases 'em all, whether it's service, flair, style, or flavor... there's a lot going on in this package. \n\nFirst off, it's crazy in here. Just like the vibe in Thailand. It's loud, hectic, colorful, crowded, and packed with sensory overload. If you want a subdued romantic spot for dinner, this ain't it. Those in the know make a reservation, those that don't wait a while for a table. The staff is dressed in a riot of color, and the decorations are a mish-mash of styles and elements. It's all around fun. \n\nThe food? Legit. It's not your average collection of stoplight curries. Sure they have red/green/yellow on the menu, but they're not the center of attention. The real fun is found in the more unique dishes, like the bone-in short-rib slow-cooked with Penang curry. Or the slow-cooked beef noodle soup. The Hat Yai chicken is pretty amazing (although not quiiiiiite as good as the Hat Yai at Hat Yai in PDX... just sayin'). The papaya salad offers fermented crab and fermented fish options - not for the faint of heart/palate. And while they do have a regular pad Thai, farang-style, the better version comes with the grilled river prawns. \n\nI could go on and on about each dish on the menu. I've had many, and they're all great. I've never had a bad or even mediocre experience here, and I can't imagine anyone else having less than an excellent time either.", "author": "Don B."}

They also had a little Photobooth area by the check-in stand, which was already a little more interesting than your average Thai restaurants. \n\nAs soon as we sat down, I looked around the restaurant and took in the vibrant energy of the restaurant. The staff seemed super excited to be there and were all full of life. \n\nA few minutes after we sat down, I noticed one of the workers carrying fried chicken on her shoulders in a way that seemed to be mimicking street food in Thailand - umm..that was cool! \n\nAs far as my entree goes, I decided to go for the Hat Lai Fried Chicken - it was highly recommended to me by my fellow colleagues, and I'm glad I took their advice! My entree came with a curry with potatoes, along with the fried chicken, and blue rice - yes, I said BLUE rice! I don't know exactly what they did to make the rice turn blue, but it sure was amazing. I mean, the overall entree put together seemed well thought out. \n\nThe best part about the evening was when the staff congregated around one of my colleagues to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to him. Let me just say that it is definitely a special way to sing happy birthday to someone at a restaurant.

It seemed a bit like Dim Sum.  We ordered the Thai green curry noodles and the Panang Neua.  The green curry noodles was really good.  But, the Panang Neau was amazing.  The slow braised short rib was super tender and had great flavor with the addition of the Panang curry.  It didn't hurt that this dish included blue rice giving this dish a lot of color, great for photos.  \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this place.  The food was great and the atmosphere was super quirky.  We even got a free apron with a recipe for ordering the curry noodles.  The only knock I had against this place was that our waitress was so soft spoken, it was hard to hear her in the lively dining room.

Surprisingly, this place was packed for a Wednesday night. If you don't have reservations, expect to wait a while. \n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty tiny and from the moment we walked in, it felt like we stepped into Thailand. [Or so my group said so since they all recently went to Thailand]. The waiters are dressed in Hawaiian shirts and the whole restaurant has a \"tropical\" theme to it. \n\nThe whole experience was very authentic. They had people walking around offering different types of food on carts (cheese ragoons and fried grasshoppers). My table ordered the Fresh Vegan Rolls to start us off. I was expecting a couple of small rolls, but they were pretty large and cut up in bite size pieces on a bed of peanut sauce! \n\nI ordered the Panang Curry with Tofu and the regular rice (blue). The curry was delicious! It was SPICY! So beware - I'm also a wimp when it comes to spice so there's that. But to my surprise, the portions were small (not family sized like a lot of Thai places). So order for yourself. I finished my Panang Curry and rice. I was pretty full and didn't order dessert but the portions are definitely doable for yourself.\n\nOverall good experience and delicious!

Farmhouse Kitchen seems like a popular spot for large groups, and was pretty full when we arrived. Farmhouse Kitchen is basically a more upscale Thai restaurant, with the staff dressed in traditional garb and the funky colorful decor. We ordered numerous dishes to share. The papaya salad had a decent kick to it. My favorite was probably the crab fried rice. Although the showstopper of the night was the rice that came with the curry, which was inexplicably blue! To this day I'm not sure why or how. Although not Thai at all, I liked the sweet and soft bread pudding dessert. The flavors were not too different than the average Thai restaurant in the Bay Area, of which there are many, but the environment is elevated so it'd be a good spot for a date night or special night out with friends. It appeared as if Farmhouse Thai might also be a popular spot to pre-game for going out as they have festive drinks in large containers with multiple straws. The most amusing part of the dining experience was watching the staff strut out with gongs and various other loud clanging instruments to sing someone happy birthday. For the amount of food we ordered as well as nice plating and ambiance, the price was very reasonable at ~$30 per person.  Would be a fun destination for a happy hour type outing.", "author": "Amy G."}

It was super busy for lunch, and when I came back for dinner later, it was still busy, with people waiting outside.\n\nOWNER, PLEASE TAKE NOTE:\n\nThis may have actually been a 5 star one for me, had I not felt so rushed by the staff.\nI totally understand the importance of the turning of tables, but I'm a paying customer too. Staff was omnipresent, chipping at the bit to quickly whisk away your food once you set your utensils down. As I was signing the check, the host came and told me they had another reservation waiting for the table. Look, buddy, I'm by myself eating just a bowl of noodles, for $23.95 no less, and I'm already signing the bill! Don't be overly money grubbing, or this will backfire and word will spread by word of mouth and all over Yelp! I'm willing to overlook it this time, because there was much I liked, but I really hope this isn't a standard business practice.\n\nAMBIANCE: Super lively, hip and fun. Cool, modern, elevated decibels, but still fine for chatting.  I really liked the vibe here! Granted, I was here on Friday night, so I'm not sure if this is typical, but this place sure seems popular!\n\nFOOD:  24 Hours Beef Noodle Soup. I'm positive Fred Flinstone dines here. If you order this, you'll know what I mean. Or just check out my photos of this dish, and you'll see why I stated this. The broth was slightly sweet, and filled with a good amount of fresh crunchy celery and celery leaves. And that hunk of meat...Well, I literally just used chopsticks, and the perfectly braised meat effortlessly separated off the bone. Ok, I'm a believer that this really took 24 hours to prepare.\n\nMUST KNOW:  You'll be asked if you prefer your dish prepared with no spice, mildly spicy or very spicy. I decided on mild, and I'm sure glad I did. Unlike the majority of Thai restaurants in the Bay Area that tend to lower their level of spiciness to accomodate the American pallette, Farmhouse reminds me of the spiced up foods I've had in Bangkok. Translating to self - \"Keep it mild, if you actually want to taste the flavors of the food, and complete your meal without going through wads of tissues to blow your nose with. Don't you dare go beyond mild! Hear me\"?\n\nEXOTICS: There was a waiter, in traditional Thai garb, offering cooked grasshoppers from a basket that he had around his neck. Now, I love my deep fried foods, but I passed on this one. In retrospect, they may have been wok fried. Whatever, irrelevant for me when it comes to grasshoppers!\n\nI'll be back to try their other dishes, for sure! But no grasshoppers, keep it mild, and please don't rush me!", "author": "Lori N."}

But most importantly, the food is de-lish! The paratha is phenomenal, almost certainly thanks to the extra butter or oil to give it that crispness and taste of indulgence. On my last visit I opted for the yellow curry with tofu and a side of rice (which is blue). The curry flavor is really unrivaled - I take a few spoonfuls plain just to bask in its deliciousness. If you're decently hungry, it's plenty of food for one, especially if you put a dent in the rice.\n\nProperly full, we opted to take a mango sticky rice to-go to enjoy later in the evening. It wasn't in season on our last visit in December, which was disappointing, but after tasting how perfectly ripe the mango was, I can admire how they only want to serve the best. Not usually a fan of sticky rice (I'm pretty adamant that rice is not a dessert), this black rice, coconut milk, sesame, and mint won me over. I liked it much more than the \"Thai Vacation\" coconut with sticky rice, ice cream, and other toppings.\n\nThey have lots of inventive cocktails, beer, and wine, but no hard liquor. Not a problem for me as I'm happy to lap up a Thai Iced Tea topped with a ball of shave ice or sip on a whole coconut.\n\nDo yourself a favor and make a reservation on Yelp, as there aren't a ton of tables and the wait can be a bit given its popularity.", "author": "Cristina S."}

I've been wanting to come here for awhile, but the experience doesn't compel me to return. Don't get me wrong. The food is good. It's just the service I didn't quite fancy, but I don't want to offend anyone if it's a cultural thing. The atmosphere was hectic, and I felt rushed to get in, eat, then get out.\n\nI made reservations for dinner with Nina Y. Thank goodness, because there's no way we would have gotten a table within an hour during busy time. We still had to wait, though. Once we sat down, we quickly decided what we wanted. I got a small bowl of Tom Yum soup and the beef rolls.\n\nIt was the perfect amount of food, but I should have specified to have the beef rolls and Tom Yum soup come out at the same time. Instead, the beef rolls came out first (because they were under the appetizer section of the menu) and I was just awkwardly eating by myself while we waited for the other two items. They were good, though! Surprisingly spicy. My mouth is watering while typing this.\n\nWhile eating the beef rolls, someone came around and said something quickly. I nodded, thinking they were asking how things were, but he put a salad on our table and walked away. I was like wtf. I felt so swindled and didn't realize what was going on. But it was too late. We were already charged. It turned out to be only $5 but still.\n\nThe crawfish and fruit salad was insanely spicy. Interesting flavors. I wouldn't have ordered it myself. Not on purpose, anyways. The Tom Yum soup was spicy too, of course, and it was the perfect amount. What would have been a perfect ending is mango with sticky rice... but they didn't have the dish. Maybe it's not an authentic Thai dessert. Anyways, that was the biggest disappointed, which I drank off at a nearby bar afterwards.\n\nAnyways, I'm glad I came here to try Farmhouse once since I've heard so many good things about it, but there are other Thai restaurants around San Francisco I prefer... that have equally good food and a far better customer and culinary experience.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

I recommend dipping everything in the curry sauce. You definitely get a variety in this dish.\n\n-Shrimp dish: we ordered a shrimp dish that came with bell peppers and a mound of blue rice.

From the outside and the name you wouldn't have thought that it was a Thai restaurant. The outside was extremely pretty and the inside was even prettier.

Almost all the tables were filled and there was loud Thai music blasting. \n\nI really wanted to order the Thai Iced Tea as it had a ball of shaved ice sitting on top which was different than anything I've seen anywhere else... But I had just gotten a deep tissue massage and my blood pressure was extremely low (dizzy and slightly nauseated) - so I just opted for a Vegetable Pad See Ew. \n\nWhenever I try a new Thai place, I either generally get a Pad See Ew or a Pad Thai before I try anything else - if they can't get the basics right, how can I trust anything else on the menu?\n\nMy food came, pretty average portions, plating wasn't very pretty either for $15.50... but dang was it good. The soy sauce flavor was spot on and wasn't sour like many other subpar Thai places I've been to. There were plenty of vegetables mixed in with the noodles so there were not just a couple pieces of broccoli and the rest were noodles. The only sad thing was since I wasn't feel so hot, I could only take 2 bites before I had to stop (to no fault of the restaurant). One of the waitresses noticed that I wasn't really eating my food and came over and asked whether I was enjoying my meal. \n\nI asked for a to-go and also if they had Mango Sticky Rice (my obsession) - She put the order in for me and after a while came back to check on me and went to the kitchen and came back with my order.

The food was solid, and the service was ok, but it did seem a little pricey. Tried green curry noodles and also the wagyu steak.\n\nWouldn't be the priority spot for super authentic Thai food, but it is obvious that the chef/staff puts effort into making the dishes tasty. The green curry was flavorful and went well with the noodles/veggies it came with. On the other hand, the steak was tasty, but the dip was a killer. Steak itself was good, but again, I would say a little overpriced. My real issue was with the service. I felt like we were being rushed out of the restaurant right when we got there, and sure i understand if there is a huge line outside, but toward the end there were open tables yet we were still rushed out.

I'm a big fan of all the photogenic details, faucet wall, trinkets from Thailand, as well as the artfully presented food. Defiinely date night worthy. \n\nWent to a surprise birthday party here for a group of 10 and our menu was their most popular dishes. Here's some of my favorites. \n\n- Chicken wings - Best in the city. Crispy, juicy, plump, flavorful and the sweet chili plum sauce brings the Thai-ness to the dish. Must order. \n\n- Herbal rice salad - Loved the contrast in colors and textures of this dish. toasted coconut, shredded green mango, crispy shallots, purple rice, etc make for a memorable dish. \n\n- Panang Neua - The slow braised bone in short rib with the panang curry sauce was incredibly tender. Recommended. \n\n- Hai Yai fried chicken- It was like a flying saucer of light and crispy deliciousness, the curry dipping sauce for the roti had good flavor as well. \n\n- Thai chelada - crisp and refreshing like it's Mexican cousin but uses Singha beer instead. \n\nWhat earned the 5th star for me was their dessert and when about 5 staffers they came out to sing Happy Birthday with a drum. It was awesome, had everyone laughing, and definitely made for a memorable birthday. \n\nThe dessert platter had macarons, fresh shaved coconut, cantaloupe, molten lava cake, and this sweet black rice with lychee and gelatin cube ice with cream.", "author": "Earl G."}

At the surface, Farmhouse Kitchen might look like a hoky (Thai) dining experience. But with the truly flavorful food and an atmosphere that couldn't be replicated elsewhere, what Farmhouse Kitchen yields is a remarkable dining experience.\n\nFirst things first, let's booze it up. I ordered the Makram (Hahn Fire Soju, FH Tmarind Shrub, Bittermens Habanero, CO2- Don't ask me what any of this means). The Makram starts on your tongue as a refreshing summer drink and ends with just enough sting to remind you that you ordered a spicy drink that packs a punch. I also sampled a friend's \"Coconut Island\" (Carpano Antica Vermouth, Dolin Blanc, Coconut Cream, Lemongrass, Lemon), which unsurprisingly tastes like vacation.\n\nLiquored up? Let's add in some carbs and enough curry to make you feel even warmer on the inside. I ordered the Panang Curry (basil pepper, basil, crispy yam). If you're sensitive to spice, I might direct you elsewhere. It's not an overwhelming heat, but it's the kind of spicy that builds. Coated over the blue rice (what makes it blue? no idea, but it's delightful), The Panang Curry is a warming (and quite spicy) comfort food that I cannot recommend enough.\n\nIf you're gonna get wet, you may as well go swimming. Time for dessert. I have never cared for bread pudding and always found it to have a repulsive consistency. Farmhouse Kitchen made me a believer. The bread pudding at Farmhouse Kitchen was the right consistency and the perfect amount of sweet and savory. If someone in your party is having a birthday you're in for a real treat, I won't say anymore than that.\n\ntl;dr: Go to Farmhouse Kitchen, eat curry, eat bread pudding, be happy.", "author": "Tyler M."}

The decor of the place is vibrant and the energy of everybody was on high. We probably should have reserved through Yelp but since we walked in and loved in, we made of the most of our hour wait and grabbed drinks nearby.\nFirst off we got the kick bowl since drinking out of a large container is always fun It was a lot for four people and I think is a hefty endeavor for any party less than that as the couple next to us left theirs half full (wimps.) The food itself was great. We had pad thai, pad see ew and a red curry. Flavorful and everyone's dish tasted great.\n\nThis place is a must for celebrations as the entire wait staff makes a spectacle of it and it was really fun even though my table wasn't celebrating anything.\nIt's a pretty big turnaround place as the wait can stack up, wouldn't go here for a long conversation times.

Amazing food, quick service, a funny hat and mild public embarrassment - this place has it all! \n\nI went with some colleagues to Farmhouse Kitchen Thai Cuisine as part of a team dinner. We were sat shortly after our entire group arrived. \n\nAnd while Farmhouse was packed, the entire staff runs it so efficiently. \n\nWe were given menus, and our drink orders were quickly taken and fulfilled. I can personally vouch for the Thai tea, which comes with a snowball in the glass. This keeps the tea cool and was such a fun extra. \n\nWe then ordered our entrees, and they were placed in front of us not even 10 minutes later. \n\nEnticed by the pics on Yelp, I ordered the Tom Yum Noodle Soup. This soup is packed with seafood, with salmon, calamari, shrimp and scallops. My favorite part was the egg noodles. It's hard to pinpoint why these were so good, but they just were. Maybe they soaked up some of the flavor from the spicy broth. I'm not a huge spice fan, but this was the right amount of heat. \n\nI almost got the pad thai. And happily two of my colleagues did, so I was able to try it. The Grilled River Prawns Pad Thai, in particular, is beautiful and delicious. The prawn was huge, and the noodles had a slight sweetness to them. \n\nSo where is the funny hat and public embarrassment?\n\nTo celebrate something in my life, my boss told the restaurant staff it was my birthday. And for birthdays, Farmhouse Kitchen does it right. Several of the staff members start from one side of the restaurant and clap, cheer and sing their way to your table. And once they get to you, they put a straw hat on your head and a plastic lei around your neck. \n\nIt's mortifying yet so fun and endearing at the same time. I hated/loved my coworkers for this. \n\nAnd to top it off, the staff puts a large tray with a sampling of desserts in front of you. This is a serious dessert selection. It included some lychee ice cream, coconut milk shaved ice served in a hollowed-out coconut, chocolate and large slices of watermelon, among some other items I'm forgetting. The coconut shaved ice was my favorite, though it was all delicious. \n\nWe had so much fun at Farmhouse Kitchen, and we were in and out in roughly an hour and a half -- an hour and a half of delicious food, fun and now good memories.", "author": "Emily H."}

We almost asked to send it back, but decided against it. We ate a few grasshoppers which weren't as scary as I thought, but we quickly ran out of our beverage and bugs when we realized our food was taking much longer than everybody else's.\n\nThe table next to ours had dessert, left, sat a new party, and got their dinner before our server came back to tell us that she had forgotten what we ordered. Shame.\n\nAnyway, the food finally came and it was SPECTACULAR! They nailed everybody's dishes. I had fried chicken and perfectly flavored yellow curry.

My issue with this place is their food.\n\nA thai place for me has to do 3 things well: Tom Yum, Pad Thai, and Pad See Ew. Tom Yum - good. Pad Thai - Okay, but I still wouldn't order again. Pad See Ew - One of the worst I've ever had. They should change the name of this pad see ew to \"Plain Jane\" (except maybe not cause A$AP Ferg made Plain Jane cool!).

Our group easily booked reservations on a Friday night even though there did seem to be wait when we checked in. Be warned, the outside does not reflect the inside. The decor is unique and does bring you back to a Thai market or stall. It is also pretty loud and chaotic with music blaring and people randomly walking around with baskets (of what we found out later are fried grasshoppers. Our group of three split chicken wings, chicken noodle soup, yum moo krob (pork belly). Everything was delicious but nothing stood out as very memorable.  An interesting point of the restaurant that they do a huge parade of noises for anyone's birthday; which was exciting the first time but got a little much the fourth time. \n\nOverall, I think this place would be great for parties or large groups where you want to get a little rowdy while eating delicious Thai food.

Specials are in the $20-28 range. However, the food is very beautifully and artistically presented, and well-cooked. I got my pad thai with a crispy pork belly supplement (+$4), which ended up not quite being worth it for the few small pieces of pork belly that I got. The pad thai was delicious though, and was not too oily or too sweet, and the new pieces of pork belly that were there were deliciously crunchy and rich. The amount of food was enough for two meals for me.\n\nThey also frequently would gather the staff and bring our birthday cakes to much fanfare and cymbal smashing to other diners - definitely looked like a fun place to come celebrate your birthday.

No reservations? It feels like any time of the day that you walk in, prepare to wait at least an hour to be seated, if you didn't make a reservation ahead of time. Yeah, that's how popular this place is. The restaurant always reminds me of lakorns (thai dramas). It's super quirky.

Super bright colors,etc etc. I like it (haha) because when you step in, you're already thinking this is so cute to eat at. At least I do. We got the ahi scoops, crab fried rice, Thai street green curry noodles, and the infamous Hat Yai fried chicken. Ahi scoops-skip. The other stuff were much better.

Who wants to be surrounded by merriment and don an awesome hat?  This gal right here.  Is it September 2018 yet?  Oh well, I guess I have 9 more months to try everything on the menu, right?\n\nHere's what I've tried so far - \n\ncrispy calamari - 14\n^this might sound weird, but I want to swim in a pool of the cilantro lime sauce that comes with this appetizer.  yes, the squid seemed fresh, perfectly battered and fried (though I couldn't necessarily tell that it was \"curry\" battered), but the sauce... I'd put that on a car tire and eat it. \n\ncrab fried rice - 25.95\n^ordered this two out of the three times I've been and have never tried the bone broth that comes on the side, haha.  am I missing out?  in any event, they do not skimp on the crab meat - hallelujah!\n\nhat yai fried chicken - 21.50\n^the friend who originally put FT on my radar just loooves this dish.  I'd give points for the juiciness of the chicken and the perfect texture of the fried shell around it (probably the exact same batter and technique used with the calamari), and also for the addition of roti, potato yellow curry and blue rice to round everything out.  however, if you come to FT for something that has a knock-your-socks-off flavor profile just know in advance that this is not the one.  but if you'd like one mild dish, perhaps for a less adventurous friend/family member, this one is a winner.\n\nneua yang steak - 27.95\n^one of my friends saw \"wagyu flank steak\" and added this to our order.  the surprising thing?  while the flank steak was good, I just couldn't get enough of the bed of Thai long beans underneath.  Paired with the ginger rice, too?  Holy heck... I thought it was good enough to skip the meat and just go vegan.  small note: get ready to take a video once they light this on fire - so Instagram worthy, haha.\n\npad see you beef and chicken - 16.5\n^i prefer getting this with beef rather than chicken, but either way they're both good.  this dish also made me think about being a little more \"strategic\" when ordering from Farmhouse.  you could probably enjoy pad see you at a number of different Thai restaurants throughout the city at about half the price.  unless pad see you is an absolutely must, i think you could forgo it in order to get something that you'll only really see at Farmhouse.  just a thought!\n\npanang neua - 27.95\n^i'll be honest and say that i had some reservations about this dish because some photos make the rib look pretty small.  honestly, though, the panang curry that this is cooked in, and whatever dry rub they might use in addition to it, makes a little short rib meat go a looong way.  this is not a dish you need a lot of in terms of quantity; just a small piece with rice and broccolini = perfection.\n\nkick boxing bowl - 24\n^delicious cocktail WITH A DISCO LIGHT?!  sold.\n\nthai vacation - 10 \n^the menu says it's a \"half fresh coconut filled with black sticky rice, vanilla ice cream topped with peanut and sesame\".  i'm a fan of fresh coconut, black sticky rice and vanilla ice cream and thought this was a good, but not great, choice.  next time i'll go for gold and get the ruk na platter.\n\nAssorted Notes:\n\nIt is super easy to make a reservation through Yelp so DO IT; this place can get packed during dinner and there isn't a huge waiting area so you'll have to wait outside in the (California) cold during our winter months.\n\nI've never had to park more than a block away from Farmhouse (I'm guessing most SF locals choose to Lyft, Uber, Muni in?), but this part of the Mission doesn't necessarily feel unsafe when you're walking around at night.  \n\nPost Farmhouse option (I have tried this after dinner on a weeknight) - Boba Guys further down on 19th (between Lexington and Valencia) and then people watching at Mission Playground or a couple blocks further at Dolores Park.

Do not try to get group seating on a Friday - it is an absolute nightmare, and you will have to murderously glare at the drunk parties gathered around their Kick Boxing Bowls or listen to the sound of their birthday drum concerts enough times to make your ears bleed. \n\nI tried the Hat Yai Fried Chicken, Tom Kha Soup, and Thai Street Green Curry Noodles. They also give you some complimentary pickled vegetables, which took the edge off our hunger. While the blue rice served with the chicken is fun, it tastes like normal rice and wasn't too exciting. The chicken was fine for fried chicken, but why pay $21 for that when you can get it at a sketchy fast food joint? The roti bread and yellow curry dipping sauce that came with the chicken were really tasty, though - I could've put that sauce on anything. \n\nSimilarly with the noodles and soup, the flavors were incredible when they hit my tongue. My favorite was the soup, which was just delicious with every slurp. The chicken in the noodles was kind of tough, but the green curry was good.

I was lucky to get a reservation on a Thursday for a table of 2 for lunch on Saturday. I received a confirmation phone call about 5 mins prior to my reservation and we were seated right away when we got there. The decor of the restaurant is super cute and the food all looks very delicious. My husband and I ordered classic Thai iced tea, the neua num tok rolls, papaya salad, Hat Yai fried chicken, and Thai spicy seafood. Overall, everything was very delicious. It's in the top five of Thai food restaurants I've had (between restaurants in LA and SD). The papaya salad and seafood were a little too spicy for me (my husband thought they were fine), the the flavors were still very good. The fried chicken is a popular dish and I totally understand why it is popular. It's a perfectly fried chicken breast. The breading is super crispy, while the meat is super tender, juicy and flavorful. I was surprised at how moist the chicken breast was. The dish also comes with a roti and curry sauces. The roti is very buttery and flaky, and the curry sauce is very flavorful with a coconut mild base. Lastly, the rice that comes with the dish is a blue rice, dyed with a blue flower. The rice itself did not have too much taste but the blue color is definitely pretty in pictures. For my husband's seafood dish, this was not as impressive. The flavor of the dish is good, but not the best we've had. The amount of seafood in the dish is not that much but all are cooked to just the right texture. The two appetizers: Neua num tok rolls are also very good in flavor; I especially like how the mint sauce and cucumber perfectly balanced the fattiness of the beef. The beef itself is a little over cooked, kind of a waste since it's suppose to be Waygu. Finally, the papaya salad was refreshing, though kind of spicy for me. I was kind of supervised at the Romain lettuce and spring mix in the salad, but it doesn't taste weird, so I guess it's fine. \n\nNow that food review is over, I think their service is not as great. Our papaya salad was delivered to the next table, which also ordered one but ordered after us. Another waiter was bring another papaya salad to them and returned back to the kitchen after seeing that they already have one on their table. We eventually got the salad with the entree courses. We had to ask for water several times (since it was so spicy), last time before we asked for the check. The check came, but our water were never filled again. \n\nOverall, I would go back if I visit SF again. Definitely make a reservation if possible.

I literally left wanting to book a flight to Thailand...because I'm sure its just like this ;) But, seriously, from the wardrobes of the staff to the birthday celebration songs with accompanying instruments, this eatery will be in my memory for months to come. In fact, I'd love to bring my team here during our next work trip to San Fran!\n\nSo, what did we eat and drink? \n\nEverything. Not quite but almost. The vegan soft spring rolls were incredibly tasty and served with eight small pieces (similar to sushi bite sizes). I appreciated that they used a thicker/different rice paper than you'll find at most other Thai eateries. I kicked my meal off with the Coco Lada with coconut cream and rum which was presented beautifully with a fruity garnish and umbrella. I was quickly taken back to beachy memories from our honeymoon in Vietnam. I could have guzzled several of these if not for knowing how fatty coconut cream can be. For my entr\u00e9e I purchased the tofu veggie soup with rice noodles, pea pods, broccoli, tofu and a very refreshing and light broth. If I lived in San Fran, this would be my new go-to \"sick soup\". It was extremely light yet filling. Out of curiosity, I ordered a side of the ginger rice which also has garlic mixed in and I cannot recommend this dish enough. Great bonus add for whatever entr\u00e9e you end up ordering! Finally for the finale: DESSERT! We rolled it all out with the bread pudding (which was some of the best bread pudding I've ever had - there is a reason the menu notes it as being a \"house favorite\") alongside the mango and sticky rice, coconut bowl filled with coconut granita (incredible!!) snd taro ice cream mixed with rice and red beans. All three were served on the dessert sampler. Perfect for a group!", "author": "Brittany S."}

Well maybe not so great for the embarrassed birthday girl/boy, but hilarious for everyone else. If you tell them you're there for a birthday when making the reservation, they have this whole birthday procession where 5-6 people slowly walk up to your table banging all sorts of percussion instruments and sing happy birthday not once but TWICE, all the while placing various accessories on the birthday person's body. (If you want to see a video of this, check out my video at https://www.instagram.com/p/BZ9KsMUjTIF/?taken-by=crazytensai in the second post). During the course of the 2 hours we were there, there were a total of 4 birthdays being celebrated, so this seems to be a popular spot for it!\n\nPrice-wise, it's definitely not your run of the mill Thai spot, so make sure you have the right expectations in mind when coming here. I was eyeing the crab fried rice, but felt like the $24 price point for it was a little high. Or $21 for their 24 hour beef noodle soup. I settled for the Hat Yai Fried Chicken ($19.50), which seems to be a popular dish according to Yelp reviews.\n\nIt was a much larger platter than I was imagining, as in addition to the fried chicken, you also get a serving of blue rice, yellow potato curry, and roti bread. It almost felt like two separate dishes, one with the fried chicken and the other with the curry / bread / rice combo. I definitely struggled to finish my dish and didn't end up eating most of my rice.\n\nThe fried chicken was a pretty large piece of breast, and while I was a little worried that it'd be dry (I'm personally not a huge fan of chicken breast), it actually turned out surprisingly moist and well flavored! I had no problem finished the chicken as that was my favorite part of the whole meal :) The curry was a little bit spicy for my tastes as I have very low spice tolerance, plus there was some cilantro in it which was a pain to pick out, but what I ate was tasty with the roti.\n\nThere were 7 of us, so we also opted to split a kick boxing bowl ($32 for 36 oz). I definitely recommend getting two for a group our size, as it was hard for all of us to reach the bowl and we had to constantly pass it around on the table and each person wasn't able to drink that much. It'd be good for 3-4 people, I think. It was a very sweet and fruity drink so I enjoyed it.\n\nI'm sure it's bright inside during the day, but come dinnertime, they dim the lights way down and it becomes pretty hard to get a good shot. Apologies for the grainy shots!\n\nAlso, if you're all about that perfect 'gram shot, bring your phone with you when you go to the bathroom! I know that sounds weird, but the wall of the giant bathroom is painted with a gorgeous rainbow logo of Farmhouse Kitchen Thai. I was kicking myself for not bringing my phone to the bathroom when I saw it...lol", "author": "Dianna H."}

By far one of the best (maybe the absolute best), dining experience I've ever had. \n\n FOOD; we ordered the 24 hour beef noodle soup. amazing rich, hearty broth with an exotic sweet and sour Thai flavors! It came with Thin egg noddles that were perfectly al dente, a good amount of herbs, like lemongrass and slow simmered beef. It definitely appealed to my adventurous taste buds. \n\nBut my favorite was actually the chefs special which had this garlic flavored rice, chicken, and of course various dipping sauces. \n\nAlso their roti canal is amazing. Perfectly satisfying chewy and luscious carbs, while crispy on the outside... \n \nSome dishes that weren't my favorite (yet still enjoyable) : \nthe friend chicken app. Too dry for my preference. Not much meat. Great flavor though \n Blue rice: fun, tasted good, but overhyped and no where near tasty as the garlic rice.", "author": "Christina N."}

We ordered two of their most popular dishes, the hat yai fried chicken and the papaya salad. The hat yai fried chicken was a little more on the pricier side, but it comes with so much more than just chicken. This dish included: curry with potatoes, roti, rice, and the fried chicken. Everything worked so well together! The chicken was crispy and not too oily. The papaya salad had a spicy kick to it, which I really enjoyed. \n\nThe restaurant itself is decorated uniquely and kept very clean (big plus!!!) There is a long table in the middle which is perfect for a large party. Will be back soon to try the noodle soups and curries! Parking was difficult to find, even on a weekday. We found 2HR free parking a couple blocks away.", "author": "Nancy C."}

We were suggested to go here by someone we just so happened to be passing by. We had no reservations and they managed to get us a table at the bar once we arrived.\n\nThe service was incredible!! Everyone was so friendly and cheery that the atmosphere in the room was contagious and you couldn't help but also be happy and smiley. Our server took really good care of us at the bar. I ordered the beef soup which she recommended was very popular.\n\nThe soup was fantastic! The meat melted off the bone and the flavors were so good. I ordered medium spicy and it was a little spicier than I expected so just keep that in mind when ordering.\n\nThe night we dined there, they also seemed to be celebrating something and I actually won a free tshirt from the raffle they were having. Our server was also so kind to take a picture of my boyfriend and I, then have it printed out for us.\n\nDessert was unforgettable. I was already so stuffed from the soup but I couldn't pass up dessert it looked so good. We got the bread budding and it was delicious. I ate the entire thing even though I was already full.\n\nThis place is absolutely amazing!

The Thai iced tea is fun since it comes with a snow ball doused with condensed milk but there is a lot of ice so you do not end up with much iced tea. We loved the grilled shrimp pad Thai under the specials. The noodles were perfectly chewy and the sauce and tart and sweet. The braised beef special was melt off bone delicious. We also really loved the Fried chicken special that comes a with sweet curry and roti!!! We could not get enough of the roti and even ordered an extra order of it. The papaya salad was actually really spicy despite the \"medium spicy\" warning from the the server. We also got the drunken noodles which was not that spicy and lackluster compared to the special grilled shrimp pad Thai.

It was special to go with Marley as she reviewed the place on the Bay Area Show Check Please. So thankfully she did all the ordering and we just got to enjoy the food :) \n\nWe arrived for lunch, and parking was pretty easy to find. We made reservations so we're seated immediately. It wasn't terribly crowded so I imagine those without reservations would be able to be seated pretty quickly as well. The interior was cutely decorated with a Halloween theme and the servers were also dressed in their fun Halloween costumes. \n\nMarley did all the ordering and we ended up getting Kobe beef jerky and par dip fresh tuna for appetizers. The kobe beef jerky was their house marinated wagyu beef with a delicious black dog chili sauce. The meat was very tender and marinated well :) the fresh tuna was a diced maguro tuna, which was also quite yummy.\n\nFor the main dishes we ordered the herbal rice salad, the hat yai fried chicken, the panang neua, the pad Thai, and the 24 hours beef noodle soup. Everything was delicious! The two dishes that stood out to me were the hat yai fried chicken and the panang Bria. The fried chicken was paired well with the yellow curry, and there was a sauce and honey on the side to dip the chicken in. The flavoring was so delicious! And the panang neua is amazing .. the meat literally melts in your mouth. I would go here everyday if I could :P apparently they do something amazing to their rice to make it such a pretty blue color :)\n\nThe servers recognized Marley from Check Please and were so kind to give us dessert on the house. The chocolate cake, apple pastry, and coconut ice cream were all amazing! Whenever I have guests in town I will definitely take them here :)", "author": "Jackie C."}

I fell into that boat with Thai food -my previous experiences were so-so. There was something about the coconut-based curries that I did not like. \n\nThat all changed with Farmhouse Kitchen Thai! Whoa! What an eye-opener! If all Thai restaurants served food of this caliber, there certainly would be more people loving Thai food. But, of course, that would mean everywhere would be good and the novelty lost. Thank heavens for bad Thai food and the mouth-wateringly good Farmhouse Kitchen!\n\nMany of the entrees are served family style, enough for three or four people. If everyone ordered a different entree in a four-person party, the resulting meal would be more than satisfying!\n\nIf I were in the mood for their soup - temperature hot, with tender-but-crunchy vegetables, and a rich coconut curry soup base was sooo good, I must remember to order it the next time I come here (and I will return...). I didn't order it, but I tried someone else who had ordered it and wow! I immediately fell in love with this delicious soup!\n\nThe green curry had flavor bursting out the moment you tasted it, followed immediately by a good amount of spicy heat! Nice! \n\nThe Pad Thai, with it's striking orange color, sticky noodles and a good amount of combo seafood, served over a bed of bean sprouts, made the saliva glands explode with tasty goodness!\n\nThe Pad See You with the flat noodles also had great flavor - with only a mild amount of spice\n\nThe Panang Neua (with a big marinated short rib) had meat that just fell off the bone, it was so tender! (My mouth is watering even as I type this!)\n\nAnd finally, the Coconut bread pudding with a delicate souffl\u00e9 with a caramel glazes on top, with a scoop of coconut ice cream and whipped cream with slices of strawberries - oh, so yummy!\n\nThere are so many other items on the menu I want to try. I cannot wait to come here again. Farmhouse Kitchen Thai, you have me sold in Thai food! Thank you!\n\nUnfortunately, I must dock one star for the toilet.

They seemed a little confused on the phone but told us we were good to go.

I have to admit that I didn't believe her and ordered more than she suggested, and we ended up having leftover food. \n\nThe highlights for me were the fried chicken dish and the short rib dish.  The group didn't like the prawn pad thai and many said the prawns were 'off.' I didn't take my chances so I didn't taste it myself. They did a great job accommodating our vegan members and I was really impressed with how they really didn't mess a single thing up on our order. \n\nThe funniest part of the night was when we had a birthday song for someone in our party. An entire mini parade came out, clanging symbols, draping props on the birthday boy, and singing for what seemed like a really long time. I wonder if other diners in the place get annoyed when they have to be there for someone else's birthday... but in any case we thought it was hilarious! \n\nIt's a big space, good for groups, and they make dining fun.

The staff here are colorfully dressed and the vibe here is super chill. fyi it is loud but not unreasonable, also parking here can be a pain cause its right by residential property so if you can bike/uber/walk you should do that. They have a fairly extensive menu and I'll be glad to come back to try some of their other stuff.", "author": "Peter P."}

Came on a Friday night to grab dinner with a friend and we were seated promptly (we opted for the bar). Inside the restaurant, it's dark, busy, and lively. Seriously tons of stuff going on! Hosts dressed up in colorful Thai outfits and cool decor everywhere. It's casual and upbeat and man, so much character. The staff is friendly and if it's your birthday, they sing to you. Very very loudly. Be warned! \n\nThe food was delicious. There's a decent amount of items on the menu and a few vegetarian options. I ordered a noodle soup, can't remember what it was exactly but see the picture! DELICIOUS. Perfect portion size. Lots of stuff in the dish not just soup ya know. I asked for medium spicy but it wasn't that bad. It definitely builds up and sneaks up on you but they must have thought I couldn't handle real Thai level spice. (Somewhat true LOL).

I was dining with a huge group of 11, so that meant a lot of food. There were three dishes in particular that stood out to me. The Hat Yai Fried Chicken was amazing. It was perfectly seasoned and fried. That is a no brainer to get. The Pad Thai is also incredible. Those noodles rocked my socks off. The short rib (Panang Neua Dinner) was so incredibly tender that I was cutting it with a fork. There you go, I've given you your order.\n\nDo not forget dessert. Although I've had better fried bananas at the Thai temple near my home, the dessert we ordered off the menu was all amazing.

My boyfriends dish came with an interesting sauce, sweet, a little sour/spicy that he didn't like but I loveddd for my pork belly. I mopped it up!!! Made my dish. One of my friends asked for their spiciest sauce and they came out with a platter with four different ways to spice up your dish, one labeled \"grandmas sauce\" that's supposed to be the spiciest. Supposedly it still wasn't spicy enough for him, but if you have an average level of spice tolerance it should be pretty spicy for you. \nIt's a bit pricey, but it's in SF and it's just one of those joints.

Farmhouse is just okay in my opinion, and I'm surprised to hear people raving about this place. I had a better experience this time around, but it still doesn't particularly impress me. It's not very authentic in my opinion and I'm not expert on Thai food but I've definitely had better experiences at other restaurants in SF. I would say this place is more an expensive hipster Asian fusion spot to eat at with lively decor and ambiance.\n\nThe first time I came we shared a lot of the typical dishes family style. None of it really stood out to me even though I don't remember what we had. Also don't really find the blue rice that impressive, since it's just regular rice that happens to be colored. There's a lot of potential for it, maybe could take some inspiration for how tasty and unique purple rice is at Korean joints. The presentation of the food comes on huge plates so I'd imagine that I'm getting a better deal for the entrees I'm paying for.. but I'm still not convinced. The food is generally pretty whitewashed.\n\nI decided to try the most popular dish here to see what the hype was all about.\n\n24 Hours Beef Noodle Soup - Slow cooked bone-in beef short rib, egg noodles, veal broth, broccolini, basil, bean sprouts, cilantro, green onion & pork fat garlic oil. Came pretty quickly in a huge bowl. The price on the menu is $23.95 but with tip and tax it could run you more than $30 which is ridiculous. It's good beef noodle soup and the broth was done pretty well, don't get me wrong but if I'm paying that much for an Asian dish it needs to exceed expectations.\n\nI think a big part of why Farmhouse fell short for me was because of the scrappy service. Our waiter was hard to reach, and would often run off before we finished what we were asking for. We ended up having to flag a lot of other random waiters, some who ignored us. \n\nIt's good but not great, and in my book this place is overrated.", "author": "Chelsea W."}

You just know you're walking into a Thai restaurant the moment you walk in. We were sat in the middle of the restaurant at a long table. We were greeted by our server who took our drink orders right away. We started off by grabbing a bottle of white wine for each side of the table. \n\nLooking at the menu, they serve a wide variety of Thai dishes ranging from curries, soups, noodles, and \"street food\". We decided to two separate orders since we were such a large party and share with our respective side of the table. To start off, my side of the table ordered the kobe beef jerky, tom yam soup, mango salad, fresh rolls, and thai sausages. All of them were delicious. My favourite being the tom yam soup (perfectly spiced and flavourful) and the mango salad (surprisingly spicy, but perfect blend with the sweet mangoes). \n\nFor our main dishes, I can't even remember everything we ordered, but there was a green and red curry, chicken pad thai, pad kee mow, and a few other dishes. All I remember from this meal is that I was one stuffffed lady! Everything I put into my mouth was tasty, spicy and flavourful. Everything you'd want for your Thai food - unless you're not big on spice. One thing that was really memorable was the servers walking around with bucket-like containers attached to a long pole that they balanced on their shoulders. They would come around offering smaller dishes such as crickets, shrimp, and smaller noodle dishes. Me and a few others tried the cricket, and after experiencing my first cricket, I can't say it was the worst thing I've ever eaten. The spice of it masked it's \"cricket-ness\" and all I remember is that it was really crunchy. Happy I could cross that off the bucket list! \n\nOverall, you can't go wrong with any of the dishes you order here. As Brett N said, all the dishes we tried ranged from good to great.

I had high expectations after my manager said she booked reservations at Farmhouse Kitchen for a team dinner during a brief stay in SF. Of course I scanned their Yelp page, website, and menu before our arrival and I was so excited. I personally have a lot of dietary restrictions and I was pumped that this spot was able to work with my diet. The reviews on the page raved about how good the food was and the place looks absolutely beautiful. \n\nOur reservations were for 7PM and we got there about ten minutes early. I loved all the plants outside of the building and the colorful streamers. It really set the stage for dinner. We walked through the front doors and were instantly greeted by the host and were told it'd only be a few minutes before we would be taken to our table. Not only was the host decked out in vibrant Thai clothing but the staff was pretty decorative as well. I loved the bright colors, plants hanging from the ceiling and fun music playing lightly enough to not disrupt our table conversations. \n\nOnce our table was ready we took our seats and dove right into the drink menu. Their drinks are somewhat tiki style but also a little classy. I ordered the flower spritzers and it was super light and refreshing. It included elderflower liquor, Thai rose bitters, sparkling wine, and rosemary. I loved that it came with a sprig of rosemary. Give me any drink with fresh herbs in it and I guarantee I'll love it! Next up were the appetizers. We ordered a few different ones for the table to share. We got the vegan fresh rolls, the \"Mieng Kum Kung\" also know as the crispy crusted prawns, and the Neua Num Tok Rolls. The vegan fresh rolls were awesome. They had some tofu, fresh herbs, bean sprouts, and noodles and came with a side of pickled vegetables. There was also a side of peanut sauce, which was awesome. Just how I like it! The prawns were honestly out of this world and I highly suggest you try them. They were fried and laid upon a piece of lettuce. It was almost like a little wrap. The third option we had I didn't try due to it being mainly beef but my teammates said it was delicious. After drinks and apps we placed our entr\u00e9e order. I decided on the Mok Salmon, which came with a banana leaf wrapped piece of salmon, grilled asparagus, and blue rice. There was also a side of sauce, something with cilantro and lime. It was seriously amazing. I could drink this stuff. If they sold it, I would buy it and put it on everything. The salmon was cooked perfect, as was the asparagus, and the rice was the perfect texture. I did wonder how it was blue though...\n\nLast but not least was dessert. We were celebrating a teammate and my manager snuck out to inform the staff. They went above and beyond to make her feel special. Not only did she receive an extravagant song and dance but a giant platter of desserts. There was ice cream, macaroons, brownies, flavored ice, etc. We all shared it, trying a few bites of each item. My favorite was the little macaroon. It was tiny but very tasty. \n\nIf you're into this type of cuisine and find yourself in the area, do yourself a favor and come here. I do highly recommend you make a reservation ahead of time, as it was really busy. Like seriously, the place was poppin!

Not the most ideal for trying multiple items. But with one shot at this, my wife and I decided selfish decisions had to made. To start, we got the Neua Num Tok Rolls. It was not at all like I expected. But the \"rolls\" were actually the extremely tender flavorful Wagyu beef. The savory flavors of the meat mixed so well with the cold, crunchy cucumber and mint. This was an incredibly, well designed dish that had such good complimenting flavors.\n\nI decided to go with apparently what they are most famous for, the Hat Yai fried chicken. That was one decision I will never regret. It came with a yellow curry that was nearly as good as the chicken itself.

For mains we got green curry, fried chicken, pad see ew, and more green curry (with noodles). Everything was flavored really well with good portion sizes. The green curry was a little runnier than I'm used to, but nothing a little blue rice couldn't soak up. (By the way, it's literally just dyed jasmine rice. A little gimmicky since there's no taste difference... but I can't argue that it looks cool.) Pad see ew was delicious and I loved how fresh all the vegetables were. High quality food. We left clutching our sides and aching for a nap by the end. \n\nAtmosphere: What a unique spot -- decorated in a strange industrial/Thai style with staff dressed in island-like apparel. The birthday celebrations are INTENSE and COMMON. There is no way there were 5 birthdays going on in the hour I was there, but it's quite fun to play along if you're in the mood. That being said, might not be the best for a 'classy' first date.\n\nValue: Prices are on the higher end, but portions are actually quite generous. Still, I consider this more of a 'treat' than a staple. \n\nService: Despite the constant birthday celebrations, service was fine. Waters were refilled diligently. We did wait over an hour for our table though, so MAKE A RESERVATION. (If you don't, don't wait outside! Walk around the corner to Trick Dog for an awesome cocktail!)\n\nOverall, a really fun place. It's food and entertainment in one and maybe a little over-hyped, but the food delivered, so that's alright with me.", "author": "Deena M."}

We ordered a few of their top sellers which is the hat yai fried chicken, panang neua, and 24 hr beef noodle soup. \n\nThe portion sizes were huge so it's good for sharing.  The fried chicken was surprisingly tender and went well with the curry sauce.  The panang neua is braised short rib with a curry glaze on top.  The beef was fork tender and delicious.  The 24 hr beef noodle also have a large slow cooked beef short rib that of course was also tender.

My buddy and his wife raved about the food here, especially the green curry and shrimp dishes.  After our meal, I'm inclined to say that its definitely one of the better Thai restaurants I've been in SF.  5 stars. IMHO its a step ahead of Osha Thai and Kin Khao. In fact, Kin Khao should give its 1-Michelin Star to Farmhouse.  I'll have to bookmark Marnie Thai on 23rd for next time.\n\nThe restaurant is in a somewhat remote area on Florida St, across from a residential area.  Outside, it looked nothing like a Thai Restaurant, but instead something rustic like you'd find in Napa.  We all ordered family style and pretty much enjoyed all the dishes:\n\n1. Mieng Kum Kung: Appetizer of three perfectly fried prawns served on a green leaf with minced ginger, lime, coconut, tamarind, and yes peanuts.  Elevated coconut shrimp with some serious jacked-up flavors. (5 stars)\n\n2. Green Curry with Mary's Chicken: Served with Thai eggplant.  Curry was excellent - not watered down and moderately spicy.  Chicken was moist.  They served this with blue flower rice! (5 stars)\n\n3. Pad Kee Mao: Vegetarian version of spicy Drunken Noodles, and pretty good.  The color is lighter than I'm used to seeing, but the spicy kick is definitely there without the excess oiliness. (4 stars)\n\n4. Pad Char Shrimp: Excellent saut\u00e9ed shrimp in red curry, but the real winner is that amazing green cilantro-based dip that was similar to an Indian chutney, but with intense Thai kick.  Comes with more blue flower rice which was a hit (5 stars).", "author": "Daniel C."}

This is really really really good Thai food that is fresh, well flavored and delicious. I felt like they put a lot of thought into the design of the restaurant and all the servers dressed colorfully which is parallels the dishes and the food that is served. \nWe had a reservation and they were kind enough to push us by about 15 minutes which I appreciated. We were seated quickly when we arrived and it didn't take long for our server to stop by for drink orders. I ordered a hot tea and for appetizers we chose the chicken wings. The chicken wings had a nice sweetness to them and a little crunch although the portion size was only 4 wings. I was told that the recipe has changed so if you've had them before it's possible the recipe isn't the same. I thought they were good but I heard that the last recipe was amazing!\nWe ate dinner family style and ordered, crab fried rice, green curry with chicken and had a soup I can't remember the name of. The food came out quickly and everything was delicious. There is a healthy amount of crab in the fried rice. The green curry wasn't overly rich and had a nice balance of basil with a little heat. The soup was light and refreshing. \nOverall I had a great time at Farmhouse, it's one of the better Thai restaurants that I've been to and everything I tried was flavorful.

The place is definitely in a nice, cleaned up section of The Mission District. \n\nVibe:\nA few things of note - Chinese New Year is this week so the restaurant and staff were colorfully decorated with beautiful tokens of celebration! Red paper lanterns everywhere, streamers, dragons, flowers, festive music, and bits of Chinese culture sprinkled throughout. It was a lovely experience. This place was super modern with bits of modern art baked into the walls. Nice restaurant space, great mood lighting.\n\nThe service:\nAs a whole the servywas nothing spectacular. The young man who severed us was polite, tentative, accurate, and space, so for that I appreciated him. However when ordering he made no suggestions, pairings, fan favorites, etc. Not bad service by any means, he just did not engage with anyone at the table. \n\nThe menu:\nThe menu is pretty extensive and for someone who is slightly unfamiliar with traditional names and staple dishes in Thai cuisine, I found myself googling a few things. There were also two \"secret menu specials\" in celebration of CNY. And there were ladies walking around with trays of small treats - a fried wonton, and FRIED GRASSHOPPERS! \n\nThe food:\nWe wet our whistles first with a glass of sparkling rose. We ordered the samosas to start - the one thing I forgot to snap a photo of. They were absolutely delightful. Crispy flaky pastry she'll filled with potatoes and heaven. And the spicy curry sauce that came with it was stellar. (Also worth noting, the samosas come with 3 pieces but we were able to up that to four pieces so we could each have one.) Between the four of us we ordered the Red Curry with crispy pork belly, Yellow Curry with chicken, the Tom Yum seafood noodle soup, and the Tom Kha coconut soup.  The seafood soup and the red curry were delicious. I would definitely recommend ordering ride to go with the curry as it doesn't come with it. But it was still quite tasty. The seafood soup was a little more tangy (think vinegar flavor...\u200d) than I expected it to be, but the noodles were cooked well, the seafood (shrimp, calamari, & scallop) seemed fresh and was tasty. ! I had never eaten grasshoppers before tonight...but it was an exciting adventure that I'm glad I did but don't ever need to do again ...it came with a few larvae along with 3 full grown grasshoppers. The grown ups were kinda tasty, salty, crispy, kinda like a kettle cooked potato chip. The larvae were tasty too, but the texture was kinda weird...not mushy - just dry and fibrous? \n\nThe price:\nMost of the apps are around 6-12$, salads around 15-19$, curries for 15-19$ and main entrees for 16-47$ (most of those being between 21-28$). A little rich for my blood considering the whole experience, but it wasn't the worst. Our bill was 172$ for 4 people, so roughly 45$ per person, for 1 appetizer, 4 glasses of wine, 2 beers, 2 curries and 2 soups.\n\nAll in all a good meal, good service, good restaurant.

Add the fact that staff is attentive, service is timely, and venue is lively; and you got yourself a solid 4 star resto. Not a 5 star because there were a few missteps. \n\nI waltz in with two buddies, no reservations and yet we get seated in abt 15 minutes. They were definitely busy but the hostess let us know that if the four top reservation didn't arrive, we could snag the table. Yass! \n\nMenu is straight forward and most, if not all of my go-to fave Thai dishes were there. My dining companions and I ordered the following:\n- Thai sausage appetizer was decent. Small sausage for three - sliced into several slices with thinly sliced cucumbers, shredded carrots and ginger and peanuts to accompany it - was tasty and left you wanting more. A tad overpriced tho.\n\n- Yellow curry, Thai spicy had a good flavor and wasn't too hot. However, IMHO after a few bites all I could really taste was the chili oil. And it looked it too! Nice that the veggies remain crisp because nobody likes over cooked veggies in curry/soup. \n\n- Tom yum noodle soup, Thai spicy with mixed seafood was delectable. I only had a couple sips of the broth but man was it tasty!! A true seafood rich broth with good coconut flavor, as well. My dining companion gave the seafood two thumbs up for freshness and serving variety. However, there was too many noodles. And thin egg noodles? Meh.\n\n- Pad ka pow was my main dish. It's what I order to measure how good the Thai resto is...and it could have been easily one of the best I've ever had (top 3 for sure!). Great minced pork to peppers ratio. Just the right amount of heat. Nice that there wasn't dry and \"gravy\" tasted great over rice.\n\n-Rice was blue! Like smurf blue. Odd, but it was jasmine rice and didn't bother me. One of my dining companions, however, couldn't get past the color and left 3/4 of the serving untouched. \n\n- Kick boxing bowl was surprisingly good. Big bowl with extra long straws reminded me of rum concoctions I've ordered at tiki bars, but this was nothing of the sort. Sparkling, slightly fruity and sweet, it was easy to drink and appeared endless.\n\nDefinitely a pleasant dining experience.

From the decor to serving plates, everything is traditional and sets a clear ton for this restaurant. Wait staff are also dressed to match the theme. \n\nHat Yai Fried Chicken- Beautiful presentation, large enough to serve 2 people. Blue rice is visually stunning, yet does not taste too different from regular rice. The yellow curry is not over-powering, it is quite light but is perfect to bring out the flavor of the chicken. The chicken has a VERY thin crispy crust. The meat is SO juicy, lean and tender! I would describe this as a light and healthy version of fried chicken. There is no grease, no fat, and no guilt to eat it! \n\nPad kee mao- such a simple dish, but mind blowing! The noodles are so soft yet not easy to break, and it is SO flavorful with different types of spices balancing with mild heat.  After trying this dish, I realized the many pad kee mao I had at other places cannot compare. Although this seems like a simple dish, I highly recommend it! The portion is on the small side though, do not expect this to keep you full. \n\nI have come here a few times and have tried many of their dishes. Farmhouse Thai cooks meat really well, you cannot go wrong with any choice of protein. Prepare to wait on weekends if you don't have a reservation, this place gets busy!

It's a perfect balance of carbs, protein, and fat, and also savory and sweet. The curry goes with everything - rice, roti, or even the chicken! Not your typical fried chicken also - very thin, crispy skin. 100% recommend! \n\n- 24 HOUR BEEF NOODLE [4/5]: Large bowl of noodle with beef (rib?) that melts in your mouth. This is the perfect comfort food. The soup does not leave you feeling thirsty. \n\n- YELLOW CURRY [4.5/5]: Recommend if you like sweet curry! This curry is like of like the one from the Hat Yai Fried Chicken. It comes with potato pieces and roti bread. Recommend to order with pork belly! They add a nice chewy texture to the curry. \n\n- PAPAYA SALAD [3/5]: Flavorful but very spicy! You can tell that it's made fresh because of the nice crunch to the veggies. But the serving size is pretty small and 50% of the plate is cabbage. \n\n[SETTING/SERVICE]\nI love the set-up of this place! Lots of open space and natural sunlight, and not too crammed.

It's pretty loud inside, so not a good place for an important conversation, but it's a great place for a fun meal with friends. The wait can be excruciatingly long- but it's always gone by faster than they estimate. Last time they said 90 minutes, and we were seated within 45 minutes! It's definitely worth the wait if you do end up having to hang out for a while. \n\nNow for the food- I have tried the panang curry, yellow curry, fresh rolls, lotus cookie dessert, coconut latte, and the tom kha soup.

One of the dishes was too spicy, and they were nice enough to take it back and remake it. For the price, the entrees are well proportion for a thai place in San Fransisco (almost too much food). \n\nThe dish I got was the Hat Yai Chicken which consists of a fried chicken, yellow curry with potatoes, roti, and blue jasmine rice. It was delicious as the roti went delicious with the yellow curry. The blue jasmine rice was fragrant and went great with the yellow curry as well. The fried chicken was golden brown and delicious as well but I only wished that the chicken was a little bit crispier (not as crispy as I would hope). \n\nOverall, this restaurant is great and is well worth the trek, however, I always leave feeling something was missing from my thai experience (I have yet to figure out what it is, but It's pretty minor). \n\nTips - Get the fried chicken!

Didn't make a reservation. Luckily, Farmhouse is close by to many good spots like a brewery and my favorite cocktail bar.\n\nWe dipped into Trick Dog a few feet away, had drinks then came back when they texted me. The best part is that the service at Farmhouse is friendly and so beautiful. Everyone there is so full of love and smiles. The music is super festive, and the decor and colors at Farmhouse give off such a party-all-day vibe. Great spot for groups, date, or family.\n\nThe food is the name of the game here. Their samosas are so good. Flaky and veggie-friendly--GET IT. Boo ordered the chicken legs which a guy walked around carrying, almost reminiscent of street vendor style ordering in those Southeast Asian countries. Chicken legs are 2 for $3, which he said was yummy but not really worth the price (better bang for your buck at dim sum spots). The prawn pad thai is delicious and the noodles are cooked to perfection, but a bit too sweet. Red curry is so flavorful, and well enjoyed with jasmine (looked blue/green!) or their sticky rice which comes in a bamboo cup. Portions are humungous. We definitely overate for 2 people...and even had to take our rice home to eat tomorrow. \n\nIn all, the food is so delicious, and even sitting at the bar or at a communal table will be fun. There aren't purse hooks at their bar seating, but you do get full view of their drinks being made and extra pickled veggies if you ask nicely. Most of their cocktails run on the sweet side, but their flower spritzer is more refreshing with elderflower and bubbly. I had the Ya-Dong set, which is a set of 2 shots that come with a Singha back. The best way I can describe it as a Taiwanese kid is that one tastes like the herbal chicken soup my mom used to make me drink when I was on my period, and the other red one tastes like super old Chinese herbs that you imagine when you watch old Asian time period shows.\n\nPrices are affordable for SF standards but on the $$$ side. We basically paid $40 per person for our feast--but we did order too much. It feels like such a party, and we weren't even celebrating anything!

Their wait staff seem to be Thai and the menu had some great dishes, both in presentation and taste.  We tried the steak roll appetizer and the meat was amazingly tender. It wrapped with cucumbers, mint and other flavorful things that I couldn't make out but it was delicious.  Pad Thai was okay and I wish it had more noodles. I think this was more presentation than anything else. They also only give you two prawns with it. Really? You're better than that Farmhouse! Lastly, we also tried the beef short rib that was tender off the bone. It had his curry like sauce that I used to mop up some of the blue rice. Highly recommend for meat lovers out there.\n\nSo if your thing is to bring Thailand over to America in the Mission District of San Francisco, you may be more critical than I am. However, if you're an amateur foodie like myself, then you'll like this place. Plus, you can drink right out of a whole young coconut.", "author": "Quoc N."}

The green curry ($14 + $2 rice) was spicy surprisingly spicy as well, even though no \"spicy icon\" was noted next to the dish. The Tom Yum noodle soup ($16) was surprisingly not spicy, and had more of a lemongrass flavor; but this dish on the menu had a \"spicy icon\" next to it.\n\nThey have a spicy challenge here, to be completed in 15 minutes.

Can't even remember how I first found this spot...but there's a ton of great spots around this one block radius (Trick Dog, etc)! Farmhouse Kitchen has got the vibes of an authentic bustling Thai street restaurant (minus the street feel) - you'll get it once you're there! \n\nTip 1: make reservations if you're planning ahead. This place gets PACKED. Tried coming here once at 7:45pm on a Saturday and was told it'd be a 1.5hr+ wait. No, thanks. Made reservations for tonight's dinner...and by the time my group was leaving around 8:30pm, there were still at least 6+ groups waiting to be seated? On a Wednesday night! \n\nTip 2: add some buffer time prior to arrival to find parking! Parking is really a hit or miss around this area. Now with all the apartments and restaurants and bars in the area, it's a bit tougher :/\n\nTip 3: share the dishes! They're HUGE. I can never finish my own entrees. And I always get apps on top of the entrees. This is by no means a cheap dinner spot, but they compensate that with their extra large dishes. They're honestly shareable sizes. \n\nTonight I had the fried calamari and seared tuna for apps. For my main I had the green curry with seafood. Even though all my dishes sound pretty basic, Farmhouse's seasoning game is real strong! The fried calamari paired with the perfectly homemade(?) sweet and sour dipping sauce. And my green curry had just the right amount of kick, topped with fresh seafood and greens. I thought I was really hungry before dinner, but couldn't even get through half my curry! \n\nOur particular server could've been a bit more lively, but he got the job done without being rude. There's a lot going on, and definitely a fun environment overall.\n\nAll in all, Farmhouse is a great spot to come by once in a while! Am I going to spend $45 on dinner every night? No. But would I come back for a fun get together occasion? Yes. 4 stars!", "author": "Jennifer L."}

I took my family here last week since they were in town and I wanted to take them to a place that was Asian and trendy. I couldn't be happier. My sister got the ribs, my husband got the salmon, my mom and I split the pad thai. It was so good! The ribs beautiful looking that I really wish I took pictures. The meat fell off the bone and I snagged a few delicious bites; it was so soft I could pull the pork off the bone with my fork. The pad thai was perfect. All the food tasted was really solid, but the presentation is what sold it; everything looked beautiful.\n\nThe atmosphere was super cool too. The lighting we good/bright so I could see my company and food. There were little disco balls/light that weren't particularly intrusive, just neat to look at. The seats were pretty comfortable. \n\nAs for the staff, they were great. Our waiter was super friendly and helpful. Everyone was attentive. Their outfits were so cool. I don't know if it's a uniform or just what they decide to wear, but it's all cute, like gender non-conforming Thai garb with jewelry/neck pieces, it's hard to describe but everyone looked fabulous and I was very impressed. \n\nI also had the Thai tea which was unique in presentation. The tea was in a shallow glass with a shaved ice ball on top, soaking it in like a snow cone. It was a very fun way to drink a traditional beverage; I felt like a kid I was so happy.\n\nThe bathroom was clean, private and large. With an awesome rainbow painted on the wall (ceiling to floor). Even though there was only one toilet, there were two sinks, which earned this place some points for just being corky. \n\nAll in all, I'd recommend this place if you want to show someone around a unique and fun experience with good food.

Overall I like the food, but I do have some issues here. \n\nFirst, the place is always busy, and extremely loud, so be prepared for that. Also, the ordering to-go is part of the same process as waiting for a table, so it gets very crowded at the front of the house. \n\nI ordered the Chicken Wings appetizer, and for $11 I received 4 small wings. Nothing special here, just majorly overpriced wings. Should I have received more than 4? \n\nI also ordered the Grilled River Prawns Pad Thai. This was delicious, but again at $23, overpriced. I guess this is the new norm for SF, since their pricing in general is VERY expensive for what you get. \n\nOverall these dishes are/could be great, but Thai food in general is not meant to be expensive. At most these dishes are worth $13-$17. But given the atmosphere there, and new money, I'm not surprised. I used to go here a lot, then stopped, but sadly I won't be going back.\n\n*UPDATE* The comment from the Resturant missed my point about pricing. I received 4 dry wings in a plastic to-go container for $11. That's completely unacceptable. Don't patronize me based on selecting \"more affordable\" food options from the menu. The Pad Thai tasted great, but $23? The only reason it's $23 is because you're rent is most likely overpriced, and you pander to the elite crowd who's more than happy spending that kind of money on Thai food.", "author": "Steve P."}

This place is definitely Michelin rated for a reason! We put our name down around 7:30 and waited 30-45 minutes to be seated (not bad given our group size). They're nice enough to call you when your table is ready, so you can roam around the area (Trick Dog hello!) while you wait. \n\nTo start we all shared the Tom Kha soup with chicken. It came in a flame pot to keep it constantly warm and it was dynamite! The chicken was shredded and cooked well and the soup itself had very rich flavor - on the sweeter side as far as Tom Kha soups go, with good balance established with the cilantro. Pretty sizeable portion given 10 of us all had a bowl with some to spare.\n\nFor mains I had the Papaya Salad and the Red Curry. Okay so the Papaya Salad was easily the BEST Papaya Salad I've ever had, and I pretty much thrive on Thai food. Fair warning - this dish is spicy! But in the best way possible if you can handle it. It had a great crunch from the peanuts and chewy dried shrimp. Just an explosion of flavors and textures in your mouth. Would highly recommend for those not afraid of spice.\n\nThe Red Curry was equally fantastic. It had a rich flavor just like the soup with lots of basil and actually came in a great portion size. We ordered the blue rice to accompany it. To me it didn't taste special but hey, it's blue and that's perty cool. \n\nAmbiance is very comforting and warm!

Definitely a very authentic Thai experience, with a very enthusiastic host to add to the vibe. I would recommend making a reservation as most of the 6:30-8pm restaurant times get taken. I did arrive on time for my reservation, but still had to wait about 15 minutes before I got seated. However, the servers were so kind as to give me a free desert for the wait, even though I really didn't wait that long! It really shows that Farmhouse appreciates their patrons and want us to have the best experience. \n\n[Dinner]\nI ordered the 24 hour beef noodle soup. The give you A LOT of meat and the soup was extremely flavorful. It seems that this is a highlight for the restaurant and I would definitely come back for this dish! My friend ordered the yellow curry. It was alright, I wasn't super impressed with the curry or the hyped up purple rice (even though it was really pretty to take pictures of). \n\n[Drinks]\nHighly recommend the fresh coconut. I really like coconut water, and they top off the whole nut to the brim and bring it out with a spoon so you can scoop the meat out after. I want to come back and try the beautiful cocktails.\n\n[Decor]\nI think 50% of the reason to dine here is definitely to see the work of art that is the inside.\n\nOverall, definitely a must-try if you enjoy authentic experiences.

It's very rare that I say this but THIS PLACE IS SOOOOO WORTH THE WAIT. \n\nSwung by on a Sunday after doing an event with my company nearby on Mission. It was kind of early for dinner (around 5), but this place was paaaacked. The wait was 40 minutes, but even though we were hangry we decided to just go with it and grab drinks while we waited. We ended up getting to the bar and being confused, but finally ordering a COCO-LADA, a drink with coconut cream and a bunch of other goodness. Refreshing and a good way to calm the hangry nerves.\n\nAfter finally getting sat at about 50 minutes, we were famished. The server came by quickly and grabbed our drinks. We started with a large TOM YUM soup which came out slowly, but was suuuper tasty. BE WARNED, this soup is Thai spicy, not commonplace spicy. About 10 or so minutes after the soup came out the entrees were sent. We got the EPIC FRIED CHICKEN and the special they had that night called the LARB MOO. The chicken was easily some of the best fried chicken I've had in the city with a great crispy outside and tender inside. It was juicy and just had an overall great taste. The Larb was actually just a salad kind of dish with a side of sticky rice. It also was good, but again the spice level here is on the high side. I might pass on this one next time, but loved how it came as an assortment of goods. \n\nLoved the professional attitude and overall positive vibes here. Def coming back!", "author": "Daniel O."}

We ordered the papaya salad with fermented fish sauce and it was good! (The stinker, the better) They even have a fermented crab sauce option. Came in for my bestie's grad. dinner on Monday night & the place was quite busy (maybe it was graduation night too?). Aside from the papaya salad, we also ordered the sausage, beef salad, & roasted pork belly. The beef salad was so tasty as the sauce had a savory, vinegary flavor and the beef was tender. I'm usually not a fan of roasted pork belly but this dish was an exception - they seasoned it with a chilly powder along with roasted rice powder. \n\nThe ambiance of the place was casual. At first, it didn't look like a thai restaurant until you walk in where the employees are dressed in traditional clothing along with the decor. Service was friendly with food coming out accordingly and servers were always on top of water refills.

As someone who's originally from LA, I have pretty high standards when it comes to Thai cuisine. I'm also more of a \"hole in the wall\" diner, where I prefer the gritty, no-fuss mom-and-pop top establishments to the swankier ones that cost $$$ but don't produce very good food. That said, Farmhouse Kitchen completely took me by surprise - who knew you could have great Thai food AND great restaurant ambiance?\n\nI had the Hat Yai Fried Chicken and my friend had the Pad Thai - the Pad Thai was meh (good flavor, but noodles were a bit overcooked), but the chicken was DELICIOUS! It's usually hard to go wrong with fried chicken, but I really loved the combination of the crispy batter (never had anything like it before) and the sweet/sour sauce. The curry and roti were the icing on top of the cake - the potato was cooked perfectly, and I'm a sucker for roti. I wasn't a fan of the blue rice (did they just add food coloring? weird...), but portions were so generous that I didn't feel the need to eat it anyway. Between me and my friend, we took home half of the pad thai.\n\nService was excellent. I was especially impressed at the end, when they asked if we wanted to split the check - I don't think I've ever had a restaurant ask me before! I know it's not convenient, so major bonus points in my book.\n\nRandom note - I love how they incorporated lots of small authentic touches in the decor. My friend's from Cambodia, which has a similar style. We noticed that the chicken was served on plates similar to those she has at her house and the background music was Thai. Small things I'm sure most people don't notice, but it made the experience feel like an elevated version of the mom-and-pop restaurants I love.\n\nWe'll definitely be back. It's totally worth the price, and I'm dying to try the beef noodle soup next.", "author": "Larissa M."}

However, my boyfriend said he prefers the boat noodles at Zen Yai over this rendition. \n-The curry that came with the hat yai fried chicken. YUM. I could eat that sauce with anything. \n\nOkay: \n-The shrimp pad thai and red beef curry were alright. I've had around the same at other thai places. The beef in the curry was pretty hard. \n-I didn't think the hat yai chicken was anything special, despite all of the raving reviews. It was fried pretty well, but other than that, it was pretty small and wasn't extremely tender or anything. \n\nThe not-so-great:\n-The Thai sausage appetizer- okay flavor but kind of dry. Tiny portions.\n-The service. None of the waiters were very welcoming. We felt rushed the entire time, as waiters tried to clear dishes before we even finished eating, without asking! Literally a second after putting down the fork, there would be someone at the table, trying to take away the dish, even if there was still food on it. This happened like 4 times.\n\nOverall, pretty decent Thai food but nothing you can't get at other Thai restaurants.", "author": "Chloe Z."}

Loud, brash, and wild enough to keep all 5 senses at full stimulation. You're pretty much guaranteed one of those unforgettable dining experiences here, so be sure to come in with an open mind.\n\nThe food is damn tasty. Huge portions, and you'll be thankful for them because you'll want to eat every last bit. Appetizers we had were the Chicken Wings and the Par Dip Tuna. The Chicken Wings were so delicious; incredibly crispy and the sauce it came with was fantastic. The Par Dip tuna was tasty as well. Kinda like a normal raw tuna dish but this one had a great texture and a pretty unique flavor to it. My main course was one of the chef's specials. It was the Massamun curry and although this dish was tasty, it got to be a bit overwhelming in flavor after awhile. The roti it came with was probably the best roti I've ever had though. So flaky and tasty. The blue rice was also a nice little touch, presentation-wise. Kinda weird eating blue rice though. Like eating smurf bits.\n\nThe experience itself is a trip though. If you wanna go in blind and not be spiled about the experience, stop reading here. It's so crazy in here. Some of the staff is dressed up in wild costumes and makeup. There'll be someone going around offering you cooked grasshoppers to eat which really isn't my thing at all, but my friends said it tasted like fried chicken skin. If it's someones birthday, there'll be lots of clanging and noise as basically all the staff will surround your table and sing to you with cymbals and drums ablaze.

Inside, there are colorful flags and art all over, as well as antiques that make you feel like you stepped back in time and into the opposite side of the world! Above all, however, the waiters were super friendly (and were all wearing water guns strapped to their shoulders--apparently in honor of a New Years festival/tradition that happens in Thailand) and the food absolutely amazing!\n\nI came for lunch with a group of four, but the portion sizes are quite big, so we ordered three main dishes to share, and it was more than enough! The Kai Yang, Som Tum plate came with the most tender barbecue chicken I've ever had (marinated in turmeric and coconut), along with a bamboo steamer of chewy sticky rice, a dish of spicy, pungent papaya salad, and a vinegary spicy sauce for dipping. What an amazing, perfectly balanced combination! \n\nThe Thai Street Green Curry Noodles were also amazing--the delicious, fragrant curry came with chunks of bone-in dark meat chicken and plenty of vegetables including eggplant, bell pepper, and bamboo. But the most amazing part of the curry was that you could taste the depth and variety of herbs that were used--so fresh, fragrant, and complex! The dish was served with rice noodles, bean sprouts, and pickled veggies on the side for a great combination.\n\nHowever, the dish that impressed me the most in terms of flavor was actually one of the most simple--the Mok Salmon, which consisted of grilled wild salmon wrapped in a banana leaf with oyster mushroom, and served with grilled asparagus, blue rice, and a spicy cilantro lime sauce. The best part of the dish was definitely the salmon. Like the other dishes we had, you could really taste all of the pungent herbs and spices that were cooked with the salmon--the depth and level of the flavors were unbelievable, yet the salmon wasn't overpowered at all! The blue rice was also particularly fragrant (though I have no idea how they make this!), and the spicy cilantro sauce went perfectly with every component of this dish.\n\nFarmhouse Kitchen deserves 5+ stars for the finesse of their dishes--not only is the plating absolutely beautiful, but the execution is unparalleled, and every single dish I tried was perfectly seasoned, and the components were perfectly well-balanced.

My visit in August was just not as great as the experience I had at my first visit back in the July '15. Our large group went for a team dinner and, once again, our group leader called in advance to ask for fresh coconuts at the table. Unfortunately, the coconuts were not there when we arrived and we never received them. \n\nThe restaurant was very busy, and service was spread thin. It took a really long time to get drinks. An annoyingly long time. \n\nOur group shared a bunch of apps, and almost everything was on the extremely spicy side. This actually made it difficult to enjoy the food, because everyone just felt like their mouths were on fire the whole time. (And again, drinks were sparse.) Still, everything was tasty.  \n\nWe also shared our entrees, and we ordered a little bit of everything. My favorite dish by far was the fried chicken, which was absolutely incredible. The least favorite dish of the night was the pad thai with shrimp. More than one person at the table said the shrimp tasted off. \n\nSaving this review from descending into two star territory is the incredible birthday celebration the staff performed for one of our friends. Huge dessert plates were presented at this time and I have to say they have a killer array. I couldn't get enough of the frozen coconut cream dessert, in particular.\n\nWould I go back to Farmhouse Kitchen in the future? That is unclear.

The consistency was still watery and not super rich or thick like curry, a good thing.\nBeef Salad - Slightly sweet and sour marinade, acidic dressing, fresh fibrous greens.

My girlfriend ordered the Thai ice tea and that was a presentation in itself! The Thai tea concentrate is served in a metal cup with a dome of shave ice drizzled with cream. A memorable entree for us was the 24 hour beef noodle soup. It's served with a large beef short rib, egg noodles, cilantro, and bean sprouts. The flavors are hearty and at the end of the dish (if you can finish it all) doesn't weigh you down one bit. Customer service here is great, but the one annoyance is if it's a popular birthday day. The happy birthday song is loud and it's fun to clap along to, but it gets tiring after the 3rd birthday. I'll definitely be coming here again to enjoy the food and Thai ice tea.", "author": "Aimee I."}

They also said everything they had was HELLA good. With that said, I ordered a variety of things off the menu and I can't say I had the same experience. \n\nFirst impression, I liked their little hidden location. I thought the place itself was hella cute and decorated fun. I wanted to take that flower pot/center piece home lol but I took a picture of it instead. The service was like other people have said it was so-so. I didn't think they were hella friendly and they weren't hella rude BUT I did feel rushed towards the end when hella people started lining up outside the doors. Luckily, because it was planned I set up reservations around 6 PM this past Sunday so it wasn't hella busy when we first came in. Also, I don't know if I was just distracted but I was surprised at how fast everything came out. \n\nAs for the food, I listed what we ordered and my personal opinion: \n\nSTARTERS \n- Ahi scoops: hella cute to look at & tasted just as good too, the fish was fresh, the flavor had a little kick to it, know that they only come with 4 servings though \n- Thai fish cakes: this wasn't anything extraordinary but it wasn't bad, I think this came with 6 cakes and crispies underneath \n- Kobe beef jerky: I know it's supposed to be jerky but I thought it was a little too dry LOL, either that or it really didn't have any flavor it was more something to chew on but it is good with the lime-y sauce \n- Mieng Kum Kung: unfortunately didn't get to try this because it's my sisters favorite thing from this spot lol and everyone ate it all, there wasn't enough to serve our table so order appropriately lol \n\nSPECIAL \n- Mok salmon: I like how they wrapped it with the fresh dill on top added a LITTLE flavor, and they didn't overcook the salmon, it is better with the green sauce which I am assuming is something cilantro-lime-y \n- Panang neua: the best thing here according to my sister and brother in law, I agree there is a lot of flavor, sweeter than I am used to but still hella good! The meat falls right off the bone \n- Hat Yai fried chicken: the \"other\" best thing, again I lucked out trying this one but I did try the dipping sauce and again, lots of flavor and if you like your curry sweet it's good. \n\nTHAI STREET FOOD \n- Pad See You: My family ordered this last minute so I was too stuffed to try it. My brother said it was the best he had because he could tell the noodles were fresh and prepared there \n\nSOUP\n- Tom yum: one of the main reasons I had to knock them down some, this arrived fast but HELLA cold like nobody wants cold soup (well at my table anyway) and on top of that the spoon they gave me was hella too big to scoop stuff out, there wasn't enough broth to serve to everyone at my table, the flavor was good extra tangy and spicy which I liked but don't expect more than 6 prawns, I prefer more of a seafood combination option \n\nSALAD \n- Yum Moo Krob: I thought \"garden vegetables\" was going to be more like a typical salad but it was just pork belly on top of hard cabbage with a sauce similar to what they put on the larb. I was disappointed this didn't taste as good as I hoped. To be honest, there was no crunch to the pork belly it was either prepared with too much moisture or it was sitting out for a while. It hurt my teeth to eat this lol. You know it's not crispy enough when the skin is like sticking to your teeth. My brother in law can cook a mean piece of lechon though, which I think most prefer crispy. \n\nSIDES \n- Side of asparagus: I liked this, not overcooked, still crispy, and who doesn't like garlic? \n- Side of bone broth: I don't know why I expected more from this lol but it was simple, not bad, kind of what you would get if you ordered broth at a pho restaurant \n\nDESSERT \nPlatter: Enough to feed our table lol, variety of things to choose from & again cute \n\nOverall, I didn't hate it but I think my sister made me set high expectations. I think it would have been different if we didn't feel rushed and the soup was actually hot. I would come back and try the things I missed! Everything is definitely overpriced tho!", "author": "Roxanne A."}

I have been wanting to try this place specifically for 2 things. One, because of how they greet the birthday celebrant before serving dessert and two, to try their bomb Hat Yai chicken. We started with some appetizers; Ahi tuna scoops, crispy tiger prawns, and calamari. (All freakin delicious) For entrees; most of us got yellow curry and Hat Yai Friend Chicken. (I definitely recommend trying the Hat Yai) Highlight of this dining experience: Pad See You dinner with crispy pork belly (we ordered 1 to share). TO DIE FOR. If I had to choose 1 dish from the menu, I'd definitely pick that. \n\nI am only giving them 4 stars because although the service was pretty fast, they messed up our order, had us cut our own cake and gave us insufficient utensils and plate.", "author": "Gwen M."}

Before our orders were taken, I walked back inside to use the restroom. Not seeing any directional signs, I asked one of the servers were the restroom was located. The server looked me up and down and without hesitation told me that the restrooms were for customers only. I quickly replied that I was with the group outside and the server rolled his eyes at me and pointed almost with his head where the restroom was. Not the best first impression of the staff. \n\nWhen it came to the food, I ordered pad Thai. The dish was nothing out of the ordinary; neither good nor bad, almost bland.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-27", "description": "TYPICAL TASTING THAI FOOD\n(3.5 stars)\n\nJust so you know... on yelp RSVP it said no opening until 5pm. However, at 3pm I was able to walk-in and get a table for 3. \n\nI wanted to like this place but I need to expect more than average tasting food. I guess restaurants in SF are doing new things to be \"creative\" to stand out in the crowd. Well, I'll be real with you - typical tasting thai food, nice presentation, but nothing to over bend the wallet. I don't get the concept of \"farmhouse\" and \"thai food\". The ambiance was cute and clean but walking in didn't feel like I was a Thai restaurant. For example, you can uproot the thai restaurant and put an American(New) restaurant and the owner wouldn't have to change the decor. \n\n1. Servers were thai, food was authentic \n2. Service was good\n3. Menu had a decent selection \n4. Food was good\n5. Price wasn't worth it\n6. Try not to sit near the back wall. Why? Because it's near the one toilet unisex bathroom. And someone took a dump and the staff cracked the door and it smelt like shit. That's so gross, luckily we were done eating but that's just disgusting. \n\nNEUN NAM TOK ROLLS - it's basically cucumber, cilantro, and mint rolled up in meat. It was tasty but a little overrated. Average. And average shouldn't be expensive. The meat wasn't as tender as I'd expect it for the price you pay. \n\nGREEN CURRY - with pork belly. Pork belly for the choice of meat was the best choice. They were bite size and crispy. But it would have been nice if they warned you this was spicy. Not just spicy but 'thai' spicy. I could only handle one bite but that one bite was good. for those with sensitive stomach... be ware, it made my stomach lightly twist throughout 24hrs. RECOMMEND if you like spicy curry.\n\nGRILLED RIVER PRAWNS PAD THAI - this is from the special menu and not the regular pad Thai listed on the back of the menu. This special pad Thai is $8 difference. And honestly, nothing is special about it. Same Pad Thai with fried wontons and ONE big prawn cut in half (not plural prawnS) on top as garnish. No choice of meat, by default tofu is mixed in. It was good/decent/typical tasting Pad Thai but if you don't care for those garnishes save yourself $8 and get the regular pad Thai. RECOMMEND if you want to pricy Pad thai. \n\nPAD FRESH GINGER SAUCE - with chicken, shiitake mushrooms, white onion, green onion, and fresh ginger. LOL the name is ridiculous. Obviously they are Americanizing their menu but they should keep it authentic with the names, this is basically Gai Pad King. This was very good, but again typical tasting. RECOMMEND.\n\nSLATE BLUE/GRAY RICE - nothing special. Don't be fooled. It's just presentation. They cook rice with butterfly pea flower but it didn't change the the taste of the rice JUST THE COLOR. \n\nBUTTERFLY PEA FLOWER DRINK - not listed on their menu. But when the server mentioned how they prepared the rice, I recall having A butterfly pea flower drink in a different thai restaurant. Thy prepared it on my request and it wasn't as great as I had it before. It was like a sweet/sour lightly carbonated lemonade. Def not how I've had it before and was kind of disappointed.\n\nNice ambiance, good food, but not a rush to come back. \n\nUntil the next review...", "author": "Jane A."}

My friends and I tried a variety of dishes and really enjoyed the bold, SPICY, flavors used in their dishes.\n\nWe started off the meal with the Par Dip Fresh Tuna which features fresh Maguro tuna tossed in a mix of green onions, cilantro, dill, coriander, and dehydrated chili. The flavors were aromatic and delicious, but that chili was definitely a kicker. It was bold and took us by surprise on just how spicy it was. Take caution.\n\nTheir complementary tap is good though and enough to temper the heat if you don't want to go the extra mile to order a fresh coconut. Their tap was infused with mint and limes too!\n\nAs for the Yum Moo Krob, the pork belly pieces were delicious. Mint and shallots gave it a sweet, yet refreshing undertone on an otherwise rich and meaty cube of pork belly. However, to call it a salad was a little excessive. It was literally a wedge of cabbage that you had to saw apart. It wasn't really conducive to tossing like a traditional salad.\n\nFor main entrees, we shared Thai Street Green Curry Noodles, Spicy Eggplant, and Khao Mun Gai. I thought the curry was absolutely delicious. I loved the addition of figs to give it a nice sweet surprise. Some of the other garnishes were just okay in my opinion - I always love the addition of bamboo shoots and bell peppers because they tend to withstand the cooking process and stay crisp. However, the green beans were almost mushy. In regards to protein, it wasn't a lot for the price point, but the dish itself will be more than enough to fill you up. As for the Spicy Eggplant, I thought it was done very well. It wasn't too oily and the pieces were very substantial. Lastly, the hainan chicken rice. I thought the chicken was a little dry, but when paired with the broth and variety of sauces, had really good flavor. That said, my favorite part of this dish was the broth. It was so light and the daikon inside provided a lovely sweet flavor. The rice lacked some flavor compared to other versions I've had prior.\n\nAdditionally, the bowls of rice provided were...blue...it was odd. It's not purple rice...just blue.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed our meal. It's definitely an elevated style of Thai cooking. Flavors were phenomenal, presentation was beautiful, but it's definitely a pricey choice in my opinion for ingredients that weren't otherworldly unique.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

Multiple friends had to give up eating here previously, since they tried to walk in and it was over an hour wait. Luckily for me, my friend had her birthday dinner here and we were able to get reservations for a large group on a Saturday night. They packed in 12 to one table, and a few of us had to sit in an uncomfortable corner spot; however, it was worth it for the food! The ambiance here is very eclectic and lively- some of the male staff have makeup on, wear dresses, and are hilariously sassy. This was perfect for a group birthday dinner, and we tried:\n\nDrinks:\n-Sparking Peach Jelly (Pink Moscato, Sparkling Peach Jello, $12, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=h6NXWQjiF1EQYAlT-Wq5fg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum, this was a very unique drink with actual jello pieces in it. It was very light and refreshing, and not too sweet- recommended!\n-Kick Boxing Bowl (Brut, \"Sato\" Unfiltered Rice Wine, Passion Fruit, Lychee, Umami Chili Salt, Served in Ratchaburi Bowl, 36oz/$32, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XaDAdwbj0x3TbCz87Z0bvQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): You can't taste the alcohol in here much, or the fruit flavors. This was a very light drink, and difficult to share since the straws are super tall. I probably wouldn't get it again.\n\nFood:\n-Neua Num Tok Rolls (Wagyu Beef Wrapped w/Mint, Cilantro, Cucumber, Served w/Cilantro Lime Vinagrette, 4/$14.50, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=__xSIWPwtDhRVqHvCy4Dag&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Delicious! The beef had a great sear, and the flavors worked really well together- recommended!\n-Ahi Scoops (Pan-Seared Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna, Cucumber, Seaweed Salad, Crispy Yam, Dill, Lemongrass, Chili Lime, $13.50, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=WVrgd4hhfeKuszxEkbOyrw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): A little too spicy, which I rarely say. I loved the spice, but it overpowered the subtle taste of the tuna. There also weren't enough scoops- skip!\n-Mieng Kum Kung (Crispy Prawns on Lettuce, Wrapped w/a Zesty Mixture of Lime, Ginger, Onion, Roasted Coconut, Peanuts, Tamarind Sauce, 3/$13, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cmgVmnXZoWiVOtZHbmwfbg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- this was my favorite out of the appetizers. The crispy prawns were large, and cooked perfectly, and the tamarind sauce was delicious- recommended!\n-Kai Yang, Som Tum (Half BBQ Chicken Marinated in Turmeric & Coconut Milk, Papaya Salad, Sticky Rice, Roasted Rice Sauce, $21.50, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SePPjJ1mt4D4LS_JhkQdXA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- the chicken was flavorful and cooked really well, and the presentation was amazing. They also give you a giant portion- reocmmended!\n-Hat Yai Fried Chicken (Chicken Breast, Turmeric, Herbs, Fried Shallots, Roti Bread, Potato Yellow Curry, Blue Rice, $19.50): Super crispy exterior, and they give you a giant portion! However, I don't like chicken breast, and it was a little dry inside, so I wouldn't get this dish again.\n-Penang Neua (Slow Braised Bone-in Short Rib in Penang Curry, Grilled Broccolini, Bell Pepper, Onion, Fried Basil, Served w/Blue Rice, $25.50, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=jyYfXyc7_f6cEChP9GF_CA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The flavors were great, but I wished they gave you more penang curry (it seemed like the short rib was just dunked it in quickly). I also wished the short rib had a bit more fat to it. The majority of the meat was tender, but there were a few spots were it was dry. I probably wouldn't get this again just because there are so many other more delicious dishes!\n-Tom Yum Noodle Soup (Salmon, Calamari, Shrimp, Scallops, Egg Noodles in Spicy & Sour Broth, Spinach, Broccolini, Bean Sprouts, $17.50): The tom yum soup was really good, and had complex flavors. They also didn't skimp on the seafood. However, I'm not a big noodle soup person, so wouldn't get this again.\n-Pad Thai ($15, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OvAAaaa-_umtvVHRV6S_Fw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg&utm_campaign=www_photo_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)): Yum- this was a really good version of pad thai, if you like your noodles on the sweeter side. I loved how all the flavors worked together- recommended!\n-Thai Vacation (Half Fresh Coconut Filled w/Black Sticky Rice, Vanilla Ice Cream, Coconut Cream, Peanuts, Black Sesame, $9.50): Super unique and delicious! I loved the slices of fresh coconut in there, and the coconut cream was really good. \n-Croissant Bread Pudding (Vanilla Ice Cream, Caramel Sauce, $10): This was an interesting take on bread pudding, and it was good, but not as fluffy/chewy as I was expecting for a bread pudding. This is worth trying once, but I'd order the Thai Vacation again over this.\n\nOverall, this was a really fun dinner, and a few of the dishes were also unique. Service was solid, and but parking can be difficult.", "author": "Amy D."}

They presented us with chili pepper hats and paraded the food out in a loud procession as to call as much attention to our foolishness as possible.  Did I mention the plates were lit on fire like some kind of diabolical birthday cake? Well, we succeeded, painfully choked down our two plates, and won our meals plus a bucket of beer!

But alas, I was completely underwhelmed given the hype, and most of our food came out lukewarm. The one saving grace: atmosphere is nice, and it seems like a fun place for dinner with friends. \n\nGreen curry chicken with vermicelli - curry was lukewarm and after you add the vermicelli, raw bean sprouts, etc, it downright was cold. Chicken was tender, but bland. \n\nChicken wings were pretty good. The skin had a nice crunch to it. The sauce that you dip it in is a mixture of that sweet thai sauce from a bottle and they chopped in fresh chile and garlic. I think for a restaurant of this caliber and price point, they should make their own sauce or at least not use the most basic thai sweet sauce on the market. \n\nCrab friend rice - the crab was dry and tasteless. The fried rice was almost cold. The bone broth that came with it wasn't very flavorful and yet again, it was lukewarm.", "author": "Patricia L."}

This past weekend, I had a friend visiting from Netherlands and I was looking for a good spot near where she was staying. (She was staying at the Mission) So as I was browsing Yelp (of course, where else. Duh?) Lolinda and Farmhouse came up as the top 5. I've been to Lolinda and yeah, it's a cool spot because of the rooftop and all but it's been cold and I also feel that Tapas don't typically fill me up so I always end up with a big check since I order all of the items on the menu. Lol. So I made her choose which menu she liked and thankfully, she liked Farmhouse so I made a reservation the day before we were going to go. We got there at 6:35pm or so on a Monday (good thinks I found parking quickly) and we got seated right away. The place looks really festive! They've got banners and all the festive decor that are Thai inspired. We got served right away which is always a plus to me. We ordered a few things to share: The Vegan Spring Rolls. I love these. I ate most of it! There's nothing really special about them but they're always a good starter to share. We also had the Ahi Scoops - pan seared sesame tuna served on a cucumber seaweed salad thing. The tuna was fresh and the presentation was amazing! We had the Neau Num Tok Rolls - Wagyu Beef wrapped with cilantro and cucumber.. another greatly presented dish and the beef was soooooo tasty. Ah! I can eat probably like 5 orders of them. We shared the Seafood Pad Thai - this was ok. Nothing special about it but there were big scallops, shrimps and squid on the plate so at least they weren't stingy on the ingredients. We also had some wine. I had the Pinot while my girlfriend had the Rose. They were.. Meh. Well, maybe we had higher expectations so we were a bit disappointed but we still drank them obviously. Why waste them right? Overall, giving them a solid 4 because as busy as they were - we got their attention with refilling our water, checking in if we're good or need more food, etc. They were busy on a Monday, celebrating a few birthdays and singing to them so I'd suggest you come during the week so it's less crazy.

That host was a site to behold, truly a Snapchat picture come to life with floral headband and beautifully done makeup!  We could not be seated until all members of our party arrived so we decided to wait outside on one of available seats.  I saw one thing I really liked, which was that many people were getting food to go.  Either this is the only place in the area to eat (it's not) or the food is really good (it was).  Reservations are needed or a long wait could ensue.\n\nWhen all members of our party were present, we were promptly seated.  We asked our server for recommendations for beverage and food selections.  We started with the Neua Num Tok Rolls, then ordered the Herbal Rice Salad, Hat Yai Fried Chicken and the Panang Neua.  We chose to eat our dishes family style but each entree could definitely be eaten on its own.  \n\nThe Neua Num Tok Rolls, were wagyu beef rolls wrapped with herbs and cucumbers in a tangy vinaigrette.  The beef was tender, succulent and beautifully seasoned.  This was my favorite dish of the night!  The Herbal Rice Salad was a fantastic mix of textures and sweet, salty, sour and spicy flavors.  I could have eaten a heaping bowl of this dish.  \n\nThe fried chicken dish is highly recommended but note that they prepare the chicken with a very light and delicate batter, likely using rice flour or cornstarch in their mix.  It comes with pieces of roti and a yellow curry sauce.  I love fried chicken and found this version well seasoned, tender and juicy.  If I recall, this also comes with a side dish of honey.  I was happy to have shared this dish as it might have been too rich for me on its own.\n\nPanang Neua is a short rib on bone that was cooked until fall apart tender.  It came with a nice curry sauce that cut into the richness of the meat and came with their blue rice and broccolini.  This dish is definitely good for meat lovers!\n\nTo accompany this meal I ordered the Thai Chelada.  Most of their cocktails are on the sweet side so I selected this beverage on advice of our waitress.  It's similar to a Michelada.  While the beverage itself was fine the spice mix was a bit on the salty side.  Luckily, they have a wide variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic options.  \n\nThe staff were helpful and really friendly.  They have a great way of celebrating birthdays here.  Farmhouse Kitchen could easily have been one of those places that known for cocktails, flash and overpriced menus.  However, it's not and the food is really one of the reasons to try this restaurant.  The food is presented in a beautiful manner and tastes great too!\n\nParking is not easy but it was doable.  I found a spot one block away on a Friday evening and a couple of spots opened up right in front of the restaurant while I was waiting for my friends.  This is one spot where it's probably a good candidate for an Uber/Lift ride.\n\nWe saw small and large groups here made up of young families, friends and couples of all ages.  It's a fun spot and will definitely put you in a great mood upon arrival", "author": "Melissa L."}

I would recommend the pad Thai and Thai fried rice, but all of the meat in our dishes was a bit dry. The Thai iced tea wasn't really worth the $5 price point as well and it was quite sweet.

So we walked back to our friends spot on Mission and 19th and bought a $4 bacon-wrapped hotdog as an appetizer. They called us back at 9:30, walked back but they had given our seats away. However, they were able to seat us quickly after. The food was good, not the most amazing but still pretty good.

When we were dropped off, we were surprised to see that Farmhouse was the restaurant on the street with loud music, bold colors, and workers wearing elaborate costumes; this is definitely not your typical Thai food spot or Thai food take out restaurant. \n\nI had made a reservation at 6:30, but they were kind enough to extend my reservation to 6:40, since we were running late. When at the door, we were instantly greeted by a hostess who was dressed in a Thai-themed costume; he really added to the theme and festivities of the restaurant. \n\nAfter being seated, we were served pickled cabbages and carrots, which I actually really enjoyed since they were refreshing. For an appetizer, we decided on the samosa. The order came with three samosas and a yellow curry dipping sauce. The samosas were super flaky on the outside and moist from the potatoes on the inside. The curry sauce was also one the best I have yet to have! It was super aromatic and lightly sweetened. For our entrees, we ordered the river prawn pad thai and the curried shrimp dish that came with blue rice. The dishes came on large and beautiful plates, but I was honestly not super impressed by the food. The pad thai was good, but definitely not the best I have had. For my personal preference, I wish they used more tamarind sauce or sauce in general, since the noodles came out pretty pale in color, even though they should be well coated in sauce. Also, the pad thai was $23, which I thought was a bit ridiculous for a dish that should be super inexpensive. The pad prawns were good and juicy, but super greasy; the whole dish was swimming in oil. However, I did really enjoy the blue rice. We decided to try a dessert so we went for the Thai vacation, which I enjoyed as well! It was a coconut ice cream and sticky rice combination that paired well.\n\nThe ambiance at the restaurant was amazing! It was super festive and the decorations were so colorful. Also, halfway through the dinner, waitresses were walking around with food on shoulder baskets to give an even more authentic Thai feeling. \n\nI do wish the restaurant wasn't as loud as it was, however. The blasting music made conversations somewhat difficult. Also, the prices are honestly really steep for this place; each entree was about $20-23, and though good, I think it's a bit excessive to spend that much for Thai food that isn't even that amazing. \n\nOverall, the food was a 3.5/5, but since the ambiance was so amazing, I am rounding it to a 4. I would come back again for the experience and the ambiance, but I am sure there are better Thai restaurants.", "author": "Sandra S."}

We ordered several items for sharing: Mieng Kum Kung (leave wrapped crispy prawns), Green Curry w/ House Crispy Pork Belly, Tom Yum Noodle Soup, and Hat Yai Fried Chicken.\n\nOf those dishes, the prawns and the fried chicken were the standouts. The meaty and crispy prawns were wrapped in a leaf, along with a flavorful mixture of peanuts, coconut and onion. The fried chicken was the most memorable--moist and crispy and filled with flavor. (Though the batter was on the greasy side.) The accompanying yellow curry was flavorful as well. While the blue rice made for a dramatic presentation, it tasted like, rice...\n\nThe Tom Yum was a bit of let down. Although it came with a generous portion of seafood, the soup was missing the expected flavors (lemongrass, galangal, etc.). \n\nI found the service to be quirky. We were asked to place our orders so many times, that I stopped counting after the fourth or fifth time. It was inexplicable, because the restaurant wasn't busy--the dining room was only a third filled. And they seemed just as anxious to clear our table. Several times they attempted to remove dishes while we were still eating. One staff member did notice our growing annoyance, and did jokingly ask before removing the remaining dishes.\n\nOverall the food seemed solid. But for me, only the fried chicken dish was memorable.

The yellow curry also can act as a dipping sauce for the fried chicken! The portion size is big! \nThai Street Green Curry Noodles ($16) - super good green curry! It can be spicier, but it was very creamy and fragrant. The curry had chicken or pork blood jelly which can be a new thing to try for some.

It was easy to find parking since there seemed to be more availability with the ninety degree parking around the area. It was also a pretty hot day for SF and even though we were seated right by the open doorway, it was really really hot inside the restaurant. I couldn't imagine how I would've felt like sitting further into the restaurant.. there was absolutely no breeze coming inside. That was probably one of my main issues with this restaurant - the lack of ventilation and fresh air! \n\nHere are some of the things my family and I ordered. For appetizers, we started off with their samosas, calamari, and mieng kum kung (crispy tiger prawns). I didn't have a chance to try the samosas. The calamari was good, but I wasn't expecting the batter to be so thick/deep fried. It looked like onion rings you'd get out of the fair.. The pickled vegetables they served at the beginning of our meal were so good!\n\nMost of our dishes had blue rice which was pretty unique. My mom ordered the mok salmon which was wrapped in a banana leaf. I took a bite of this and I wasn't too big of a fan of the taste. It definitely had the taste of the banana leaf.. but it was a huge piece of salmon! My boyfriend and I got their hat yai fried chicken. If you're looking for a comparison with what it tasted like, I'd say the fried chicken plate at King of Thai! But this dish comes with roti bread and yellow curry for dipping! My dad got their tiger prawn pad thai. Pad thai is always good, but my dad said the tiger prawns didn't have much meat. My brother got chicken yellow curry which tasted pretty standard. My sister's boyfriend had the kang kua prawns which seemed to be a very small portion. My sister got one of their seafood specials and I'm not sure if it was the phi pi platter.. but it wasn't good. It came with an assortment of seafood like mussels, tiger prawns, octopus, some sea shell.. lol. The vermicelli noodles served in the middle of the dish were difficult to separate and had absolutely no flavor. Her dish actually took forever to come out and sadly it was not worth the wait.\n\nAnother issue I had with this place was the fact that they kept waiting on us to pick up our plates at almost every opportunity. Yes, I get it, you wanna clear up the table, but I felt like it made our dinner feel a little rushed. At several points during our dinner, when we'd just be sitting there, I'd notice the waiters/waitresses just standing there like \"Are you done?\" \n\nA little on the pricier side of Thai cuisine, but I'd say it's worth a try. They gotta do something with the ventilation though..", "author": "Sydney C."}

I came here with a friend after running an errand in South San Francisco and thought if we had already crossed the Bay, we might as well go somewhere in the city for an early dinner at 5:30 on a Friday. \n\nFOOD: Hat Yai Fried Chicken. The famous fried chicken of this place and it's definitely worth ordering. The potato curry was very full body and the three pieces of potato were cooked to perfection. With the roti on the side, you can dip it in the shallow bowl of curry and enjoy the crunchiness of the roti with the saltiness and spices in the curry. Moving onto the chicken, this fried chicken ain't a joke. It's fried to perfection with a light batter that is fried at a very high temperature creating a nice thin, but very crisp texture on the outside. The chicken is very tender and not dried out and pairs well with the dipping sauce on the side. The blue rice, although does not taste very different from regular white rice, is visually appealing and adds a filling aspect to the dish. \n\nSERVICE: Average, although I did find myself a little rushed towards the end of the meal service. Although I wasn't done eating, my plate was almost taken away, but I got to enjoy my last few bites of the delicious fried chicken. \n\nAlthough pricier than your typical Thai joint, this place has a twist on your standard Pad Thai plate. My only complaint with my dish that it was not as hot (temperature wise, not spiciness) when it came from the kitchen. I may have a temperature After we left at around 6:45, there was a line/wait, so I would highly recommend doing a reservation if you are looking at dining at a normal time on a weekend and want to get seated immediately.", "author": "Albert H."}

Servers are dressed in colorful tropical shirts. Succulent plants everywhere from the tables to the outside of the restaurant. Walked in on a Wednesday night with no reservations and was lucky enough to get seated in five minutes. We got served some pickled vegetables as a free starter.\n\nPAPAYA SALAD $12.50\nA good light option to combat the fried chicken that followed after. The medium spicy wasn't really spicy at all. I probably won't get this next time and would opt to try the mango salad or herbed rice salad next time. \n\nHAT YAI FRIED CHICKEN $18.95\nStellar! Fried chicken is perfectly crispy and it just flakes off easily. Biting into it, the crispy part reminds me of funnel cake. Chicken breast is nice and juicy and it pairs well with either the sweet and sour sauce that comes on the side or you can dip it in the curry. The dish also comes with roti, curry dip with potatoes, blue rice, and some pickled side veggies all on one big tray.\n\nAfter we finished eating, they cleared our dishes and then someone came and set out new plates in front of us and that was confusing since we hadn't even received our check yet. I thought more food was coming or something (that we didn't order) since they gave us new plates but I guess they were just setting it up early?", "author": "Diana C."}

After spending a few hours at the Carnival in the Mission I brought my butt here because it was the closest restaurant to where my brother and I parked our car. I got a Pad Thai and he order a salad. His salad wasn't bad although he said he would not order it again. There was nothing special about it, indeed, I do not see any difference between the one we got there and the one he could have bought at Trader Joe's. Well, maybe the difference is that we paid nearly $20 for this one when Trader Joe's costs probably a fourth of that. My Pad Thai was the most boring Pad Thai I could have asked for. Plain, boring, non-spicy and bland. I had to eat it because I could not find the waiter after my first bite; although I wanted to send the meal back and order something else that option did not seem to be on the table.\n\nI have not see a restaurant that is worth when the food this bad and when there is no service.

Unless I drive over there, it's a bit of a schlep especially if you're counting on the 12 to pick you up sometime in your lifetime. However, my friend Maggie took the advice of a colleague of hers and invited Jamie W. and me to dinner at this spot of which I was completely unaware. Trick Dog and Central Kitchen are just around the corner, but I didn't know this happening Thai eatery was attracting the young and hip all on its own.\n\nIt looked expansive when I first entered the empty restaurant, but it crowded quickly before we knew it. I got there first and ordered a $4.50 Classic Thai Tea just because I needed something refreshing (photo: http://bit.ly/2fBnKd3). Once we sat at the table, I moved onto the even more refreshing $6.50 Whole Young Coconut, which is exactly what it was like I was on an episode of Gilligan's Island with the Howells. It even had a pink straw and matching umbrella (photo:  http://bit.ly/2fP2jCW). Maggie decided to get something with more of a kick and landed on a $9.50 Thai Cooler which mixed a lager with fresh pineapple juice, lime, and cane sugar (photo: http://bit.ly/2gfssLK).\n\nWe decided to share our plates and started with the $12 Ahi Scoops, a quartet of appetizer servings combining pan-seared Ahi tuna covered in black sesame seeds, cucumber, seaweed salad, crispy yam, dill, lemongrass, and chili lime (photo: http://bit.ly/2gwcZYe). Tasty bites with a nice contrast in textures, they were like maki rolls without the rice. We moved on to a $12 tureen of the popular Tom Kha, a luxuriant coconut soup with mushroom, tomato, galangal, kaffir lime, lemongrass, long coriander, and for $4 extra, fresh prawns (photo: http://bit.ly/2gJf06m). It was a lovely tropical broth that tasted creamy without having any cream in it.\n\nOur entrees came next with the recommended $18 Hat Yai Fried Chicken arriving first. It's a Southern Thai specialty that fries up a large chicken breast and adds fried shallots, turmeric, and other herbs in the coating. It came with a bowl of potato yellow curry, roti bread for dipping, and a scoop of intensely blue rice made from dok un sun (butterfly peas) (photo: http://bit.ly/2g2gAiz). The poultry was quite tender on its own, but the curry, rice and roti bread made it a more complete meal. The finale was the $22 Panang Neua, a large slow-braised, bone-in short rib with a Panang curry ladled over it.\n\nIt came with grilled broccolini, peppers, onion, fried basil, and more of that blue rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2gfzHmW). That was definitely a high point with the meat falling off the bone with ease with the curry providing extra punch. For dessert, an indulgence I know after all that food, we decided to splurge and get the $26 Ruk Na Platter, a somewhat overpriced potpourri of most of their specialty desserts - taro sticky rice, coconut creme brulee, choco cake, a caramel macaron, and a wedge of fresh seedless watermelon (photo: http://bit.ly/2fP7F0L). It was such a fanciful meal like we were in Koh Samui lounging next to the beach....only it's the Mission and I don't need sun block.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...creatively executed Thai dishes mostly flavorful, some a bit overdone\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...cavernous space feels casual like a beach club\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...polite but not overly informative\nTOTAL - 4 stars...Thai food for an eclectic palate, no pad thai allowed", "author": "Ed U."}

On my recent visit earlier this week, the restaurant was decorated for Halloween and had candy bowls scattered throughout...  My party of 10 was seated promptly upon arrival.  We were offered water and drinks (we went with the Wonderwall Pinot Noir) within minutes, but given plenty of time to enjoy without feeling pressure to order food right away.  When we were ready to order, our server, Tonk, was super helpful... I was torn between several dishes and he helped me decide what to order (the green curry chicken).  This was in addition to some shared appetizers and sides (Vegan Fresh Rolls, Ahi Scoops, Spicy Eggplant and Asparagus).  \n\nThis place is known for their Hat Yai Fried Chicken, which I tried on my first visit, and it is delicious.  That being said, I don't know that you can go wrong with your order here... everyone I dined with loved their meals.

First off the service was so on point. We got attention from multiple people that were checking in to make sure we had everything we needed and were happy. The waiters made a point of walking around the establishment looking around at people's tables in intervals. I haven't seen that kind of dedication in a long time at a SF restaurant. \n\nSecondly the food was delicious. We ordered:\n\nPar Dip Fresh Tuna \nPretty spicy. Actually a great pairing with the Tom Kha soup since it helped with the spice level. Really tasty. \n\nCrab Fried Rice \nThey dished out a lot of crab in this dish which I appreciated. The dish came with some sort of beef broth which I think were suppose to use for more flavoring? The crab fried rice was excellent on it's own. \n\nLarge Tom Kha \nLOVED this. Best Tom Kha I have ever had. Amazing base broth. We ask them to add shrimp in it. Highly recommend you do the same. Definitely order the large if you are sharing this with two people. You will probably need to get two larges if you are sharing with more than two people. \n\nGlass of the Waterwall Pino-yum \n\nPresentation was on point for all three dishes.\n\nThe whole vibe of the place is happy. Also this is a great place to take groups. They had some huge farmhouse style table set ups that could of accommodated a group of 10 or more. \n\nI'll be back.", "author": "Cynthia G."}

It was my first time here and I've been wanting to try them for a while now. The pricing is wild, pretty expensive for Thai food, but I guess it's more Thai fusion.\n\nWe ordered the punch bowl, calamari, fried chicken, curry and roti, the crab fried rice, and the Thai street green curry noodles. Each dish cost roughly $19-26. The best thing was the fried chicken and curry, but the roti was basically rock hard, it was the worst roti I've ever had. When I think roti, I think airy, soft, thin. This was flattened and tough. Next thing would be the crab fried rice, that was pretty good. I enjoyed the two bites I had. My only thing is I wish they had mixed the crab in instead of putting it directly on top, but it makes sense from a presentation stand point. The calamari was okay, I've had better, but the sauce it came with was good on its own, a little sour and salty, but I don't think it complemented the dish. And the green curry noodles were not good. They were cold and because of that the flavor was not there for me. All I could really get was the spice, not much else. My friends and I agreed, that we could definitely skip this. We also got talked into trying their bread with pandan dip, which was alright, it was just bread dipped with a sweetened condensed milk flavored with pandan. The pandan flavoring could have definitely been stronger. I would skip this as well. If I do come here next time, I would probably go for the basic curries or more authentic Thai cuisine, because from what I could tell from the fried chicken dish, the curry was good. And the entrees/fusion dishes we ordered this time didn't really fulfill my Thai craving.\n\nService is good, a little pushy, but they're all super nice and sweet. They kept coming around and asking us if and when we were going to order when we had already ordered a drink, an appetizer, three main dishes, and their pandan item.", "author": "Eva C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-04", "description": "I will probably, from hence forth, refer to this as one of the great Yelp-affirming experiences of my life. It's no secret that I'm a fan of the site. I live it, I breathe it, I say the word every day, and I preach it from the tops of the mountains. But sometimes when you're so far into the trees, you have a hard time seeing the forest. It's experiences like this one that help me remember that big, beautiful forest that is Yelp, and how it's completely changed my life for the better. \n\nEnter Farmhouse Kitchen. It was a Wednesday night and I had some free time. I had a lot of work to do, and found myself taking too long at the hotel doing it, panicking, and abruptly grabbing my phone and wallet from the hotel to rush to the party supply store. I took a Lyft (thanks!), arrived in enough time to get what I needed, but by the time I could catch a breath I found myself back out on the curb, in a strange part of town, in the dark, hungry and ready for dinner.\n\nTen years ago, I wouldn't have really known what to do. Go back to the hotel? Ask the guy at the party store? Sometimes I wonder what we did... did we just wander? There's a certain adventure and sense of discovery that comes from that and I've found some gems that way, but instinctively I reached for the Yelp app and punched up nearby locations. With a few quick swipes and taps, I locked in Farmhouse. With another tap and rotate, I mapped the walk. And just like that, I was headed to a highly rated Thai spot. \n\nThis review isn't all about Yelp, however, so let's get down to the restaurant itself. When I was a block away I got that tingle. You know the one, don't you, my fellow food lover? The one that starts with the faint scent of coconut milk, lemongrass, and fish sauce. Then it intensifies when stoked by the chatter and laughter that only a full restaurant house can produce. Then the tingling reaches maximum strength when windows reveal rows of happy diners, determined servers, lights reflecting off of clanking silverware and half-drunk wine glasses glistening under the warm yellow lights of a well-appointed interior.\n\nYes, the bar will be just fine. I passed the communal seating and plopped down. The tingling had become a warm, low burn when I checked the menu to find that sai ua (aka Chiang Mai sausage) was available, and they presented an adorable little card marking Khao Soi as the day's special. These are my two favorite Thai dishes of all time, and I rarely find one of them, let alone both, in the same place. Again, I checked Yelp to see what people were ordering. Hat Yai was the clear consensus and when the server approached I closed my eyes and half-ordered, half-wished that they would all be as good as I hoped and as other Yelpers described them. Two entrees and an appetizer. I regret nothing.\n\nBy the time the sausage arrived I was drunk on the smells and kind service. The couple next to me was feeding each other, going on with each other and the staff in Thai. I tried the first piece of sai ua and the rest is a blur. I ate it. Fast. Then the khao soi. Perfectly pickles greens, crispy noodles (not everyone gives you this many to mix in, but the textural element it adds is invaluable) and thin noodles. I had the first piece of chicken and was almost disappointed it didn't have bones. But sure enough, the second bite did--as did most bites--and that deep, rich flavor from bone-in chicken filled me up. Then the Hat Yai. The blue rice. The curry dipping sauce. Whatever magical vinegar honey sauce that was served with. I ate nearly everything and only stopped because I promised a friend a few tastes.\n\nIt was a Yelp-affirming night. In no other world would I have confidently walked right to an incredible Thai place like Farmhouse. I wouldn't have found it otherwise. The personable servers made me feel at home as a solo diner. It felt like that restaurant, in this city, at that bar, eating those dishes was exactly the place I should be that night. No where else would have done.\n\nThese people understand flavors. Maybe you won't have the same experience. That's ok. It's subjective, after all, and I don't want to leave the hype that this is a magical place that transports you to an alternate food universe. It's food, after all. But it was MY magical place. Go find yours. I know just the app.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

Next was the pad char shrimps which again were very flavorful served with mint chutney and blue rice. We asked for medium spicy and the dish delivered on the spiciness, something that you don't find at other places. Overall it was infused with flavors which were beautifully balanced. \nDrinks- Not a fan. Ordered the limeade house soda, which was too much ice and very little soda. My husband ordered Thai iced coffee which came in a small cup and was too less a quantity. We didn't find any cocktail to be appealing so settled with our non alcoholic drinks. \nAmbiance - Nice chilled out place, loved the colorful clothes on the servers. The place was a tad bit small for the number of tables they have, making it quiet noisy, so no real personal space. \nService- The service was quick but both of us didn't quiet appreciate the servers attitude. That's what led to the four stars.", "author": "Isha R."}

They paid a lot of attention to the interior design of the restaurant! Since I was a first timer, I asked the waiter what their most popular dish was and he highly recommended me their Hat Yai Fried Chicken ($21). So we ordered that and had to order the Thai street food classic Pad Thai ($16). Hat Yai Fried Chicken was delicious! Very crispy flat fried chicken with yellow curry, roti and blue (!!) sticky rice. The Pad Thai was decent - a bit too sweet for my taste (ketchup?). Overall, it was a fun and exciting experience. I was seated immediately at the bar on a Sunday night at 7pm but there were lots of people waiting for a table. My final thoughts are great food, perfect date night place but a bit pricey.", "author": "Katie Y."}

Our group was on a trip there and we had a birthday girl so despite of the location (quite far from downtown), we came here for a birthday dinner. I would suggest making a reservation if you have a large group cause it gets pretty crowded. \n\nOkay first impression, the vibe of this place screams \"overpriced hippie joint\" (plot twist: it's not). The staff dressed in tropical clothing with flower necklace and crown(?). Around the tables were vintage decoration such as old fashioned sewing machine, old food cans, and old toys. As we were navigating through the big as* menu with Thai titles and English description, a waitress kept coming back and forth every 20 seconds to ask if we're ready to order, which was kinda annoying. She also seemed uninterested and impatient when my friends had some questions about the menu. \n\nAnyway, setting that aside, we ordered some appetizers, Neua Num Tok (steak roll with cucumber), Yum Moo Krob (house grilled pork belly salad) and a Tom Yum pot for sharing. The steak roll was high quality and the pork belly salad was really well seasoned. Tom Yum was just okay, not the best I've tried. We each ordered a special set ourselves so we got to try as many dishes as possible lol. I had the Crab Fried Rice my self and it was perfect. The fried rice smelled really good and there was a lot of crabmeat as well. It also came with a bowl of light and hearty veggie soup and some dipping sauce. A lot of people came here for the Hat Yai Chicken so we tried it as well. I wasn't impressed with the fried chicken itself (c'mon, it was chicken breast) but the yellow potato curry including in the set was on fire! I'm normally not a fan of curry at all but it was so good you feel like there's an explosion of flavors in your mouth. I would also recommend the Panang Neua, which is braised short rib and veggies in panang curry (but more like panang flavored soup). It's definitely not a typical Thai dish you can get anywhere. I would not recommend the Mok Salmon (too dry) and Kai Yang, Som Tum (nothing special) tho. \n\nIf you have a birthday person in your group, you can order the Dessert Platter and when they bring it out for you the whole staff will play gong (yes, the metal round thingy) and sing for him/her. I think it's a nice service of them. But if it's not the celebration then never mind cause it was basically some scoops of ice cream, watermelon and some irrelevant sweets. \n\nOverall, the price is more pricey than an average Thai place but you totally get what you paid for. The food is unique and delicious and you will have a fun time as well.", "author": "Hannah V."}

When it first opened, both the food and service was outstanding. My last two visits before visiting tonight were mediocre with servers who didn't seem to care at all, and food that wasn't prepared with the same quality as when the restaurant first opened. \n\nTonight I ordered take out and the experience was terrible. There was a huge line of around 20 people trying to get attention at the front desk but it was taking forever for the server to process each person. To make matters worse, each person in the line had to fill out a form on an iPad which took a long time. I waited around 10 minutes in this line for the chance to pick up my pre-paid take out order. \n\nWhen I finally got to the front of the line to get a chance to pick up my food, I found that it had been stored on the floor. I find this to be disgusting and shows lack of respect for the food and the guests. Who puts food on the floor? \n\nIt's also a violation of Part 7 of the CA Health and Safety code (CALIFORNIA RETAIL FOOD CODE) which specifies that all food must be stored at least 6 inches above the floor to prevent contamination by splashes, dust, vermin, or other forms of contamination (Article 5 114047 (b). \n\nNevermind that it's a health code violation to put food on the floor. I think basic common sense thinking about hygiene should cause a reasonable person to put dinner on a table, not the floor in the middle of a high traffic commercial environment. I didn't have the energy to complain about this because I'd just landed from a cross country flight and 12 hour journey and after driving across town to pick up this food that I'd been so looking forward to, I didn't have energy to argue, so I took it home, then threw most of it away.\n\nInteresting to note they had a DPH inspection just last month and got hit with multiple food safety violations and got a food safety score of 83/100 which is not great. As I suspected, the attitude that would allow employees to put dinner on the floor is not isolated but seems to be consistent with an overall culture that disregards commonsense principles of food safety. And this seems consistent with my observation that things have changed a lot since it first opened.", "author": "Eater S."}

From the creative plating to the intriguing food coloring (yes, I'm referring to the blue rice; yes, it tastes exactly the same as white rice), all their dishes come in beautiful presentations. There are also \"specialty dish\" carts that periodically swing by each table dim sum style. From these, I sampled the grasshopper (no, it wasn't because of a dare; no, it wasn't my first time eating insect) and we all shared the hoi tod, which is a fried mussels pancake.\n\n// Neua Num Tok Rolls ($14) - 4 stars\nExtremely flavorful slices of Wagyu flank steak. Unfortunately, they were also a little overcooked.

I also liked how spicy the papaya salad was, but thought the black sticky rice was particularly hard. When initially ordering this dish, I actually tried substituting out the sticky rice for more salad, but our server wouldn't let me.\n\n// Hat Yai Fried Chicken ($19) - 5 stars\nI'm the biggest sucker for fried chicken, especially when it's drenched in curry sauce. Quite a filling meal, with all the roti bread and blue rice on the side.\n\n// Thai Vacation ($9.50) - 4 stars\nVery cutely plated inside a fresh coconut, the Thai Vacation is a mixture of black sticky rice, vanilla ice cream, coconut cream, peanuts, and black sesame.", "author": "Miko B."}

The service was a bit inattentive but I got what I needed once I waved someone down.\n\nHat Yai Fried Chicken\nThis was my favorite dish because of the yellow curry.  I was dipping everything in it and could have just drank it.  The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  By itself, it was lacking flavor but after dipping it in honey and then the curry, it was delicious.  Make sure you get this dish if you go here. \n\nPanang Neua\nThe short rib is fall off the bone but the Panang sauce was too salty for my taste.  I thought the meat was flavored enough to where I didn't need the sauce.\n\nNeua Num Tok Rolls\nThis was a very nice appetizer.  I highly recommend it.\n\nPad Kee Mow\nThis was good too but we had too much food so we didn't eat it all.\n\nThe only disappointment of the dinner was the dessert platter.  For $27 I expected some interesting Thai desserts.  Instead there was one Thai dessert, big slice of watermelon, and the rest was American stuff.  The American desserts were too sweet (like stuff you find at Safeway).  The watermelon wasn't ripe enough, plus I don't think I should get simple fruit for that cost.  At least give me nice berries.\n\nI will definitely go back but will skip the dessert.", "author": "Lily L."}

I didn't expect a wait at this place, so early in the night, away form the hustle and bustle of the main strip of Mission... so I already knew I was in for some good food.\n\nBased on the Yelp reviews, we opted for:\n\nNEUA NUM TOK ROLLS - 5 STARS. The only thing that could make this better is if they portioned it out smalller. The piece of meat was a bit too big and I would have savored it more if it came in a smaller bite, maybe halved. But it was SO TENDER AND DELICIOUS and went perfectly went the fresh cucumber and mint. Comes with 4 'rolls' and is a pretty big appetizer for 2 people. Perfect for 4 though.\n\nHERBAL RICE SALAD - 4 STARS. People said that if you like the tea leaf salad, you'd probably like this.. well, the flavor isn't really the same but you'd probably like this if you like coconut and peanuts! I like coconut and peanuts, soo.. yeah. \n\nHAI YAT CHICKEN - 4.5 STARS. YUMM. Two thin pieces of juicy fried chicken served with roti, rice and curry. The only thing that would make this better is MORE POTATOES IN THE CURRY (but I'm a potato fiend and I'm really asking for too much - haha). The presentation is awesome with the knife thru the roti and the chicken, along with the blue rice.

Neua Num Tok Rolls (beef Rolls with cucumber and mint) : at first I was surprised that $15.5 only 4 small Rolls .. but after tasting it, I know why it's expensive. The quality of the beef is good, and it is tendon and juicy.  \n\n2. Hat yai fried (organic) chicken: actually I am not a fan of fried chicken breast because it's always dry. But this one, its soft and moist inside. Taste really good! \n\n3. 24 hrs beef noodle soup: I like the homemade beef broth and the 24 hrs braised short rib is amazing.

In this city, usually, the combination of hipster + anything equates to overinflated prices and mediocre food.  Farmhouse Kitchen Thai is a rare exception.  Ridiculously hipster yet still authentically delicious.  Yes, it is a bit on the expensive side but the quality is worth the somewhat inflated prices.\n\nAMBIANCE & SERVICE\nWeird.  A wall of a hundred faucet taps (which I assume are useless) all lined up.  Unattached faucet taps just lying around.  A strange iPad to greet you with what looks like a fake music video that was filmed at the restaurant playing on repeat. Somewhat cool is that they periodically come around with traditional carts with \"specialties\" almost dim sum style.  Total throw back to being in Thailand and an extremely smart marketing ploy.  Who could say no to $3 fried grasshoppers that you know someone at your table will just HAVE to try?\n\nService, once seated, was excellent.  However, they were super behind on seating reservations.  We made a reservation for 7 PM and we weren't seated until 7:30 PM.  We saw other tables being seated before us and asked why and they said it was because they had a 6:45 PM reservation.  However, to apologize for making us wait, they did comp us an appetizer of delicious spring rolls.\n\nFOOD\nWe ordered the Hai Yat Fried Chicken (duh!), Green Curry Noodles, Crab Fried Rice, and Drunken Noodles with Crispy Pork Belly.  Each dish was exquisitely presented, colorful, well-balanced, and generously portioned. The rice is even blue!  I thought this was a gimmick...but apparently it's a real thing!  It's dyed with a special blue flower.  \n\nThe standout, not surprisingly, was the Hai Yat Fried Chicken.  Love the roti and the curry that the chicken is served with.  In fact, we ordered an extra bowl of rice and kept refusing them to take the dish away because we wanted to slurp up and sop up every last bit of the yellow curry it is served with.  Definitely a must-order! \n\nThe green curry noodles were also really flavorful, but definitely much more on the spicier end.  Plentiful with curry and lots of garnishes (bean sprouts, cucumbers, basil leaves, pickled vegetables, other unnameable herbs, etc.) but a little light on the amount of noodles given.  The crispy pork belly in the drunken noodles was also great!  But, what's not to love about drunken noodles?\n\nEach dish is around $20 so this is definitely not somewhere I could eat on the regular but it's a nice treat!  And, I will definitely be back!", "author": "Jess Y."}

Staff was dressed in some colourful shirts which looked more Hawaiian than Thai, but I've never been to either places so I'm probably wrong. Service is fast and friendly: they're always there when you need something and don't bug you every few minutes.\nI ordered the special which was some sort of curry noodles with chicken. There was A LOT of chicken in that dish. The meal wasn't too spicy(I probably wish it was). We also got green curry with sticky rice. The rice came in a cute wicker sort of bowl. \nFor appetizers we got some beef wraps. I can't even express how soft and tasty the beef was! \nIt probably shouldn't matter much but the food was made to look appealing.

I craved that dish ever since then. Just yesterday I finally had a chance to go back and get dinner. I live a little less than 2 hours away but it was well worth the return. Grabbed chicken wings for the appetizer they were spot on. The chili plum sauce was good. I got the Neu Yang Steak and it was excellent.

We were going for a family birthday celebration and there were 2 kids. We mentioned up front that the kids could not handle spicy food but many of the items recommended ended up being very spicy. We were annoyed that the waiter recommended yellow curry without telling us that the fried chicken included the very same yellow curry we just ordered when it was clear we were trying to sample different things off the menu.  Also, it was very busy but they kept trying to clear our plates while there was still food on it and we were still eating.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-23", "description": "I was nervous about coming here after seeing so many reviews mention the lack of vegan/vegetarian options; what assuaged my fears, though, was the business owner responses saying they were more than willing to make substitutions in order to accommodate dietary needs. So:\n1) Kudos to them for doing that!; it feels like more and more restaurants are refusing to swap out ingredients for whatever reasons (it's too much work, they \"know best\" how the dish should taste, etc). Bend don't break, chefs, because we're all paying attention.\n2) Proof to business owners that responding to reviews makes a HUGE difference to your potential customer base!\n\nI came with a large group and there seemed to be some hiccups regarding initial service (I think, for example, we were supposed to have those individual coconut drinks waiting for all of us, but that never played out), but it mostly smoothed out over the course of the evening.\n\nI shared a bottle of wine because the cocktails all seemed to have beer; I was really expecting there to be a bigger, more interesting drink list. Folks I was dining with got the Kick Boxing Bowl (brut, rice wine, passion fruit, lychee, and chili salt), and I was immediately jealous. Expensive, but worth it from the looks of it/them towards the end of it! \n\nThe food, for me at least, was much more awesome than I was expecting. The Vegan Fresh Rolls (with tofu, mixed greens, bean sprouts, and a chili peanut sauce) were delicious. The rice paper roll was thicker, stickier, and gooier (for lack of a better word) then any other fresh roll I've had, but that made them interesting and different. If you're coming here with friends who aren't plant-based eaters, I'd suggest getting an order just for yourself! For my main I had the Yellow Curry with Tofu (sans fish sauce). It was very, very tasty. There are times when I'm glad I don't have to share with my omnivore friends, and this was one of them. The bowl of food contained a hearty portion of potato, tofu, and sauce with several wedges of perfectly made roti bread. I also got a side of sticky rice to ladle it on top of (pro tip, right there). Ate until I was beyond full, and don't regret it (reason number #433 why I wear yoga pants all the time: their stretchiness).\n\nThe atmosphere is colorful, vibrant, and definitely different from anything in Maine.

I was told that the owners of the restaurant also own Kitchen Story but Farmhouse Kitchen was more Thai VS Kitchen Story being more fusion.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a pretty secluded area in the mission. It was mostly warehouses when we drove by at night. It's pretty easy to spot since majority of the area is pretty dead at night, we saw a bunch of people outside and figured that was the spot. Parking is pretty limited, but we managed to snag a spot across the street as someone was leaving.\n\nThe vibe is definitely more Asian than Kitchen Story and so was the menu. We ordered a bunch of appetizers, drinks, and everyone had an entre to themselves. For a party of 7 the bill came about to $450 after tip. They included a 20% gratuity for parties larger than 6. \n\nThe food wasn't bad, but not the greatest Thai food I've ever had.

First off, I have to say they provide you with the best customer service. It was pretty busy for a Monday night, but we still received great customer service. We were taken care of immediately (a reservation through Yelp definitely helped though). After ordering, I think our food came about 10 minutes later (maybe less?). However long it was, it's the fastest I've ever gotten my food at a nicer, sit-down restaurant. And don't think the speed compensated how good the food was because IT DID NOT.\n\nFood: Besides the blue rice, which I thought was alright and tasted like regular jasmine rice, everything was pretty delicious. I got the Hat Yai Fried Chicken--chicken is fried and crispy, and it came with the blue rice, roti, and a sweet curry dipping sauce. I think this sauce also comes with the samosas, which I highly recommend as well. The exterior had a crust similar to an empanada which I'd never seen before in a samosa. My mom got the Mok Salmon, which came wrapped in banana leaves, leaving the entire thing super juicy. It comes with a spicy cilantro lime sauce that was a little too spicy for my mom and I, but I'm sure others would love. If you aren't fond of spicy food, I wouldn't recommend this though. Without the sauce, the salmon would be a bit boring. My dad and boyfriend got a Pad Thai with beef and Yum Moo Krob, a pork belly salad which were also pretty good.\n\nDessert: We got the croissant bread pudding which was perfectly baked and sweetened with caramel on top. If we weren't so stuffed, we'd have finished the whole thing. Comes with vanilla ice cream, strawberries and whipped cream. My parents got the Yim-Yim with everything coconut.

Compared to my usual places, the prices were a few bucks over the norm. Good, but not great, but I guess the buzz justifies the cost.

Yah, those were THE days...you can hear the ratchetness and smell the camel toes from a mile away.\n\nEnter the hipsters and tech bros: Whisper is gone and the just as pseudo fancy Circolo (just as ghetto as Whisper when it was a club) across the street is gone.\n\nAlthough this part of the Mission is still gentrifying, it's come a long way from what it was 6-7 years ago. Super cute restaurants like Farmhouse Kitchen Thai Kitchen have taken residence along with multi-million dollar lofts that I will never be able to afford. But, that's gentrification for ya right?\n\nAt first glance, the prices at Farmhouse Kitchen may seem high for Thai food but they're justifiable. They use local and organic ingredients, and the portions are generous (enough for another meal). Plus, the presentation of every dish is instagrammable worthy - beautifully plated with vibrant colors that pop. \n\nAfter an offsite work meeting, I stopped by Farmhouse Kitchen for lunch. No need to peruse the menu as I knew what I wanted to order, the much raved about Hat Yai Chicken: Southern style fried chicken, yellow potato curry, roti, blue jasmine rice ($16): http://bit.ly/1VCfJUJ. The fried chicken breast had a satisfying crunch and was nicely tender. I immersed each piece into the curry sauce and wrapped the flaky roti around it to make a mini kati roll. The blue rice was just dyed rice. I had plenty of leftovers for dinner. When I ate the different components separately at dinner, I noticed that the chicken was sour (too much citrus in marinade?) and the curry dipping sauce was too sweet. This went unnoticed at the restaurant as curry sauce balanced out the sourness of the chicken. \n\nAlso, ordered their House Soda ($3.50) which was refreshing but a little too concentrated for my liking. Needed to be diluted a bit more. \n\nProps for the lightning fast service (received my order in 5 minutes) since I had to go back to the office but one of the servers had a bit of a diva attitude - an unspoken sass with his body language. \n\nMe: \"Hi!\"\nHim: \"Ready to order?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, I like to order the...thank you!\"\nHim: *flips hair*\n\n*Server places check on the table*\n\nMe: \"Thank you!\"\nHim: *flips hair and quickly turns away*\n\nHe didn't actually *flip his hair* (it's an idiom) but he gave off the \"whatever, girlfriend\" vibe. Not a deal breaker but the lack of mannerisms and response was off-putting. The other taller male server with the side swept bangs was really nice though. He read my mind when I wanted a glass of water and nicely packed my leftovers into different compartments. \n\nUsually the ambiance and d\u00e9cor at Asian restaurants are an afterthought. This is definitely a restaurant for the millennials, it's hip, trendy, and great for groups. Too bad, there's no full bar.\n\nParking is VERY difficult during the weekdays. Since there's no meters or time limitations on parking (other than street cleaning), people that work and live in the area park all day in the area. I got lucky. As I was driving down the street, someone pulled out of their space. Parking on the weekend should be much easier. \n\nKin Khao and Lers Ros (original TL location) are still my top picks for Thai food but Farmhouse Kitchen is great for a hot date and chic group together. Please work on that *hair flip* though!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

However, I was a disappointed. I ordered based on the recommendations of the server. \n\nRESTAURANT: \nGood vibe, open space and busy even for an early dinner. \n\nYou don't have just one server when you order. There are multiple servers checking in on you so it's hard to know who to flag when something is needed. Some were more friendly than others. \n\nFOOD: \nSpring Rolls - 4 stars, fresh light clean taste. Definitely recommend if you want something light. The sesame seeds in the peanut sauce were really yum! \n\nCrispy Prawns - 4 stars, the only thing missing was a sauce or diced mango for extra flavoring. \n\nPapaya Salad - 2.5 stars, giving this a lower rating as the level spiciness cannot be chosen and is pre-made. It's disappointing as most Thai restaurants, especially ones that charge $20 for most main dishes, should allow you to alter your spice preference on a papaya salad and prepared well in advance of service. \n\nPad Thai - 3 stars, greasy. The noodles were stuck together and very limited amount of vegetables for a veggie pad Thai. There were also 3 large inedible green vegetables almost as big as a finer in the plate.", "author": "Marisela E."}

As of today, it has been open for over a year and a half ...and i am sure it's not going anywhere!! \n\nThis is a northern style restaurant and it is reminiscent of Andy Ricker's Pok Pok, but maybe even more enjoyable! It is currently Michelin recommended! \n\nThe appetizer line up has flavors that are bright, balanced and have sweet and sour notes, in a majorly good way. My absolute favorite appetizer was the Mien Kum Kung which are crispy crusted tiger prawns, served with  leafy green veggie (not sure what the leaf was, raw collard greens, perhaps) with a zesty mixture of lime, ginger, onion, roasted coconut and peanuts with tamarind sauce. This effin appetizer is so effin good, i would not be mad if that was one of my last bites i ever ate! That little mixture under the prawn is surely to contain particles of crack, cuz it is addictive!  You must get this remarkable dish folks!\n\nWe also tried the Neua Num Tok Rolls which are snake river farm wagyu flank steak wrapped with mint, cilantro, cucumber served with cilantro lime vinaigrette. The steak was very tender and the combination of the other ingredients make it a well balanced bite, it is served four  per order.\n\nThe Crispy Calamari are curry battered monterey squid in spicy pepper served with a cilantro lime sauce. This is very good especially if you are one of those people like me that if calamari is on the menu, u will get it....so get it. The only thing thats it's missing is tentacles, no tentacles! All calamari lovers love tentacles! \n\nNow to the main dishes...\n\nThis is the house that Hat Yai Fried Chicken Dinner built!! This dish keeps coming out that kitchen all day long yo...and for a reason, it is fire!!! This is a Southern style dish with Mary 's chicken breast, turmeric and herbs, fried shallots, roti bread, potato yellow curry for dipping and purpleish rice....the big colorful plate has all these tiny bits too, well the fried shallots...and cucumber and a little dish of sweet and sour sauce. My party all agreed that this was the best dish. The chicken is outstandingly tender and fresh and the batter is so crispy and puffy. The roti and the curry are super good together. The curry sauce is very sweet and light. \n\nThe other dish we had was the Kai Yang Som Tum Dinner which consists of half a Mary's organic BBQ chicken marinated in turmeric and coconut milk, papaya salad, sticky rice (the menu says you get black sticky rice but we got white) and roasted rice sauce. The chicken was very tender, but it could've used some grill marks or char points, in my op. The papaya salad us easily the best i've ever had because of the shocking balance of flavors! The rice was HELLA sticky, like so sticky, the rice particles did not want to part ways with each other...that was the only sucky part if the entire meal. The chicken too, I mean it takes effort to eat chicken on bone especially if you share, so i may skip this another time, due to laziness...\n\nI'm ghetto, so i brought my own coke zero, cuz no places have coke zero (well some) but the waitress said she would get in trouble if she brought me a glass full if ice... So...I put my zero away...my mom insisted that I should get a Thai Iced Tea, but i didnt want to, because i didnt need more calories. She said it was the best one shes ever had and she orders it at every thai place in SF...she said something about the texture of the ice (looked like cruahed ice) makes it extra special...\n\nThe decor is super cute and the music is groovy, like not sure if it was English or Thai...or maybe i cant remember...parking can be difficult! \n\nOne more thing that was dope about this establishment is that in SF terms, it is huge! Lots of tables and space....it kinda says \"we knew we were gonna be successful and need a big ass place in SF standards\" It looks like they have performances of Thai dancing at times, maybe just not during lunch. Another cool point is that they seem to value diversity and hire a diverse staff!! \n\nAll in all, great place that pays attention to tiny details in all aspects! Service was attentive and friendly as well. Come early, it gets crackin'", "author": "Yva D."}

Fortunately, Farmhouse didn't disappoint and I've had the best Thai food experience. Granted, I haven't been to Thailand, but this seems to be pretty close to the real deal. \n\nAs the long and hip name suggests, this is not your typical Thai place that you've grown up with. You won't find green curry fried rice nor Thai ice tea on the menu. My colleague, who'd been here already several times, highly recommended the fried chicken and so I went with that: a-mazing!\n\nWhile I love the food, I found the service a bit nonchalant...let's put it this way: I can't recall any interaction with anyone from the service team.

First I thought the dishes were pretty over-priced, but the food is amazing (you also have to get the right dishes). I came here several times with large groups because there's lots of tables and waiting is max 15-20 min (hard to find such places in SF). The restaurant has a fun, clean vibe. \n\nHere are my reviews in order of my favorite dishes.\n1. Hat Yai Fried Chicken - 100% will not regret ordering this. The serving can feed almost 2 people. The chicken is so juicy and crispy. So perfect with the sweet and sour sauce. The curry dip comes with yuka (first I thought they were potatoes) and slices of naan? platha? This part of the dish tastes very similar to Burma Love's platha dip which is my go-to appetizer. \n\n2. Grilled River Prawns Pad Thai - Is $20 pad thai really worth it? yes. The prawns are HUGE and so fresh. I love their pad thai although it can be a bit sweet for some people. Treat yoself to some expensive and darn good pad thai. \n\n3. Green curry with crispy pork belly - At first I totally judged this combination, but you need to try their crispy pork belly. I couldn't stop eating them. I like how their curry has a lot of vegetables. \n\nDishes I didn't like:\n- Papaya salad was way too spicy and too saucy \n- Tom Yum was also super spicy\n- Pad Kee Mao's noodles were too overdone\n\nI like their thai iced tea and honey milk lavender!", "author": "Christine C."}

I love going back to Thailand since it's a foodie's paradise...and the sad thing about it is that it's so hard to find even half of what's out there...here.

A rare gem in the packed city of San Francisco. \n\nI've been to Farmhouse Kitchen Thai twice with a party of 5 or more and both times, it's been a solid experience. Call ahead or make a reservation on Yelp and it's smooth sailing.\n\nOne of the many things I like about this particular restaurant is their location: 20th Street Corridor. Within a short walk you've got quite a few Mission border gems like Trick Dog, The Tradesman, Atlas Cafe and Flour + Water. Totally underrated in terms of neighborhood street cred.\n\nWhat to order? I hate when people say this at a restaurant, but you really can't go wrong with most everything on the menu. Here's what our seven top chowed down on a few weeks ago:\n\n+ Fresh Rolls (with shrimp)\n+ Ahi scoops\n+ Crispy Calamari\n\nAnd for an entree, I should've split the Hat Yai fried chicken, but damnit, I didn't want to share. Half of the table ordered the same main dish and none of us were willing to go halfsies. And you know what? It really was everything promised: tender, flavorful, and just the right amount of spice. My tastebuds were tickled in oh, so many good ways.\n\nPrice per person (with automatic 20% tip with large parties) came to about $35 per person. That included apps, mains, and drinks. That's a huge win in San Francisco... finding a table to fit your people and then being able to afford the experience.\n\nIf you like Thai food and you like visiting the Mission, go here now.

Pad Thai has pleasantly bold flavors that fade into sweetness without the grease that plagues so many Thai restaurants. Pad kee mao is a heartier pick with tolerable but awakening spice. Steer clear of the mango salad unless you are SERIOUSLY ready for the spice. My tongue was stinging so much that I had to order the lavender steamed milk, which has the perfect ratio of milk to foam to flavor.\nI've heard the samosas and coconut soup are outstanding, but I love my go tos far too much.  Skip the shrimp fritters unless you understand (and like) them mini sized. \n\nSERVICE: so friendly.

It's clear that a lot of thought went into the physical aspects of the restaurant, and the staff are well trained; quick, very friendly, and very attentive.\n\nThe food itself was good seemed authentic (who am I to know?), but people considering the restaurant should keep in mind that what they've had before probably won't match up to what'll be served here. Adjusting takes a little bit of time, but it's worth it. The flavors you are used to aren't as strong as they usually are, and there are new flavors and spices to try.\n\nGive it a go!\n\n\nCons: This place almost got 5 stars. \n\nWhat knocked it down were the insects (grasshoppers? crickets?). They offer very authentic cuisine, and part of that cuisine are the insects they offer to you as a treat while you wait. Unfortunately, they don't really ask if you want it, they just serve them as if they were serving a bowl of peanuts. \n\nWhile this isn't necessarily a bad thing, where they missed the mark on customer service was the fact that the bowl followed us from the waiting area to the dining table. The fact that the bowl sat far away from the waiting party and no one so much as touched them should have been a sign.\n\nStaff should probably take 30 seconds to explain what the treat being served is, and if the party is interested in them.

The tables were really close to one another so I felt like I was practically eating with the two tables on each side hah. They also have this unique faucet decoration on the table that is movable, but never seen it before so it was cute. My boyfriend and I ordered a few too many dishes for us to share, but since it was our first time, we had to go for it! We were given a complimentary pickled dish ata the beginning of our meal, it was decent, but I like Vietnamese pickled cabbage better. \n\n- Tom Kha: this coconut soup was delicious! We ordered a small to share and it was enough knowing the many dishes that were on its way. Generous on the chicken, the onions were soft and sweet, and the coconut flavor was prominent and delicious.\n- Chicken Wings: not dry on the inside, but super crispy and tasty on the outside. Decently made, but if I had to rank my dishes from my favorite to least, this one didn't stand out to me like the rest.\n- Neua Num Tok Rolls: deliciously flavored beef rolled up for an easy bite. Comes with 4 pieces - definitely recommend trying.\n- Hat Yai Fried Chicken: came here just for this dish and it was not disappointing. The dish setup was beautiful, the blue rice was unique and yummy, and the curry had a kick of spice but still super yum! A bit pricey, but totally would order again.\n- Thai vacation: this has got to be my favorite dish - or maybe I'm just a huge coconut fan. This is eaten out of a coconut, where you can actually scrape off in the inside. The mixture of black sticky rice, vanilla ice cream, coconut cream, peanuts, and black sesame came together so nicely that I forced myself to finish it even though I was so full. Recommend to order!\n\nWhile waiting for our dinner, all of the sudden I notice a line of the waiters and waitresses come out with a gong walking towards my table. I then realized it was just how they presented the Thai Vacation for the birthday boy! They sang and gave him an awesome hat and neck decoration to wear until we left. Too bad we didn't get to keep the hat and lei, but definitely unexpected and funny to see my boyfriend so embarrassed of the attention from the whole room.\n\nI had a good experience here. Good & fun service, fun decor & attire, and delicious food  - what's not to like? I would definitely return even though they are a little more pricey than most Thai spots.\n\n+UPDATE: came back with girlfriends and had the crab fried rice with their hot sauce - it is delicious!

It also had a side dish with a spicy, vinegar based sauce that had a huge kick but so worth the heartburn.  \n\nIf that wasn't enough, we got coffee to go.

My family and I came here after a long day of hiking since my brother was in the mood for Thai. I checked online for open reservations around 6:15p, and seeing none until 8p, I didn't see the point when we were going to get there around 6:30p anyways. No way a party of 4 would have to wait for 1.5 hours, right? \n\nWalking off the quiet streets of this part of the Mission into Farmhouse was something like stepping out of a chimney after using Floo Powder. It's dimly light, colorful, and festive inside - an assault on pretty much all your senses. We put our name down, were told about a 40 minute wait, and settled on some of the colorful plastic stools in front of the reception desk. A cheesy parody music video was being projected on the screen facing us, and loud Thai music made it difficult to converse so we tried looking at the menu instead. \n\nUnfortunately, it was holiday season and my presumption that Farmhouse managed their floor service like most other restaurants and held at least 1/3 of the seating for walk-ins did not hold. Ordering takeout would have been more efficient. This would not have been too much of a problem had the front house staff been more upfront about their seating system and wait time (every \"10 more minutes\" turned into 30), and had a brush-up on PR skills. The bathrooms were at least a nice refuge, the far back one being a spacious vault with one toilet and two sinks. And a sign-up list for their top secret club. \n\nAs we were superseded by group after group of people, each seemingly larger than the last, I had the fleeting thought that maybe reservations superseded any semblance of a waitlist for walk-ins. The only entertaining moment during the waiting game was when a server went around with fried crickets to the diners (not us, part of the Crowd Behind the Desk) to offer his wares. Over an hour later, I was regretting not just making an Open Table reservation for 8p because I wasn't even sure we would get in at that time. Several other groups around us, even with reservations, were getting antsy and two groups decided to leave. \n\nJust before 8p we were seated at the draftiest table, being closest to the door. A vegetable salad was dropped on the table before us, and my sulking mother was determined to find everything else wrong with the restaurant. Unfortunately, they got her order wrong (she ordered the Chicken Noodle Soup and was given the Vegetable version) and I ended up switching my Tom Kha Soup w/ Chicken with her as mollification. These items were just average, but my brother was quite happy with his super-tender Panang Neua (short rib) and ended up eating half of my dad's Hat Yai Fried Chicken, so at least there was one happy stomach at the end of the meal. The portion sizes seemed about right for dinner pricing - the noodle soups particularly so. The dishes were unlike other Thai places I've been to - and I've never been to Thailand - so I can't speak to how authentic they actually were, but it definitely appeals to the SF crowd. \n\nDuring the meal, the waitstaff was pretty attentive and kept the water glasses full. But about halfway through the meal, it became obvious they were rushing to turn over tables and nearly took away my brother and my dad's plate three times. Calm. Down. What irritation had dulled now rose again to the surface, and I'm sorry to say that we all left with a sour aftertaste. I recognize that my experience was affected by the timing of the visit, but I don't think I'll be coming back to re-experience the poor service and average food.", "author": "Helen S."}

I had the red chicken curry. The chicken tasted like it was boiled and dumped into the pre-made a day old curry sauce. I also ordered vegan spring roll that was $9.95. Outrageously pricey since all it had was bunch of iceberg lettuce with one or two basil leaf with a small piece of tofu. Tasted very bland. Thank God for the peanut sauce for improvement. I also ordered Penang neau and pad Thai to go for my daughter. Didn't try any. Parking here is very limited. It can get pretty busy esp on weekends. If you want authentic Thai food, go to Marnee Thai on 9th and Irving. Very busy and parking is just as limited, but worth it.", "author": "Mariah O. C."}

Farmhouse is off the beaten path, but a worthwhile venture for something slightly exotic and VERY filling. It does get pricey, if you start with appetizers. Word to the wise: save space and go straight to the main dishes!\n\nThe menu is super long and tempting, so I suggest using Yelp photos to choose what you want. The Thai Fried Chicken was popular with our group, a huge portion of chicken with a side of curry & purple rice. Share-able! The 24-hour beef noodle soup was another winner, the broth so unctuous and rich. \n\nI wanted something saucy & noodley, and ordered the Thai street green curry noodles. This was more like curry with a side of noodles. Still good, but definitely ask the staff questions if you're craving something specific. \n\nNote: the tom yum kai soup is a BIG portion to start with, with tons of chicken, light on the broth. Not the best if you just want something to savory sip on before your meal, but great as a filler-upper. \n\nAmbiance is vast, like a Farmhouse, great for a group dinner of 6-8 people (or less, of course).

Put our names down for 2 and were told that they would call in 30-45mins when our table was ready.  So we took off and came back 45-mins later expecting to be seated soon.  The host told us (could have been a language communication issue) that he still had no table for us and moreover, his 9pm reservations were going to arrive soon and we as walk-ins would be bumped yet again for them.\n\nWhat kind of hospitality is this?\n \nConsidering we just came back from a different establishment and dropped $30 on cocktails waiting for our table.  [Note to owner: don't let those $30 go to another place next time because we didn't order ANY drinks with dinner.  Not the wisest business decision on your most profitable product- alcohol]\n\nBefore we could fume however, we saw a few people get up from the bar seating and pointed the empty seats to the host and asked to be seated at the bar instead of waiting another hour.  The host obliged.\n\nNow with that experience behind us, we moved on.\n\nFOOD: authentic, delicious, and came out QUICK.  We ordered (for 2):\n\n-Crab fried rice: a MUST.  The rice was soft and perfectly cooked, and CHUNKS of crab were visible.  Came with a bowl of delicious chicken bone broth.  Very satisfying.\n\n-Papaya salad: refreshing and savory.  We ordered \"spicy\" and were warned that it was going to be SPICY.  It wasn't.  Just the right amount of spicy and I can handle some, so it was perfectly fine.\n\n-Beef rolls: they were AMAZING!!  Grilled Steak wrapped around cucumber and served up with a sweet and savory sauce.  The roll was a bit too large to stuff in our mouths in one bite so I would recommend cutting it up.  Hopefully the chef can just make more smaller rolls to enjoy so you don't have a mouthful of food and chewing it for a solid 5 minutes to get any kind of room in your mouth to even speak or breathe.\n\n-Tom Yum: if I could re-order, I would NOT have ordered this.  It was just fine, and we were warned yet again that this was super duper spicy.  It was a tad spicy but again not that bad.  Let's just say I wasn't dunking my mouth in my water cup at any point of the meal.\n\nWe left incredibly full and satisfied.  No room for dessert.  Everyone was much nicer on our way out and we'll probably be back.  Hopefully they work out a better system to seat customers in a more efficient manner and improve on the hospitality.  As a walk-in, I would expect to be welcomed and not treated as a nuisance.  Once the hype dies down, there will ONLY be walk-ins!", "author": "Cin P."}

But at least they didn't grab me by the neck and throw me out the door; maybe that's reserved for next time.\n\nThe spicy Papaya Salad is highly recommended on Yelp, so that was course number one.  It was moderately spicy but not egregiously so.  However, the dressing was sufficiently assertive so that I couldn't taste the papaya, and that was the whole point of the salad.  A dressing should complement, not mask, a salad.  This wasn't bad but it could have been a salad of almost anything.\n\nHat Yai Fried Chicken Breast with roti bread, potato in a yellow curry and blue rice was plated to give the impression that there was more on the plate than was actually the case.  The potato and yellow curry was in a large bowl that occupied most of the plate and the roti bread sat atop the chicken breast making it appear as though there was more protein than was actually present.   But the chicken breast was perfectly fried and when dipped into a bit of the proffered honey was very nice.  In fact everything on the plate was very nice but be aware you are really carb loading high glycemic food with this plate: a large portion of blue rice; roti bread; and white potato.

Flavorful and tender but we both enjoyed the fried chicken above more.\n\nOverall, we think we've found our favorite Thai restaurant in the city! The prices are a bit pricy but typical for SF and the portions are big at least. Delicious food, large portions, and friendly service. We came on a rainy day so there was not that much people, but I can imagine it getting crowded during peak hours.", "author": "Kathleen Y."}

Got an easy same day reservation by calling the restaurant after seeing that Yelp and Opentable said they were full. The waiter was cute! Haha but also very receptive to our needs. The food came out fast. We ordered pad see yew, pad Thai, squid special, Panang curry, Thai sausage, chicken wings, and tom kha gai soup. Everything  was very tasty and authentic. My Thai friend who came with us was very impressed with the flavors. The wine was good but a bit overpriced. I love the ambience of the place, from the friendly Thai staff to the decor to the loud Thai music. It reminded me of being back in Bangkok. Overall with good and 2 bottles of wine our total was about $300 for 6 people. Not too shabby. Will def come here again. Oh and birthday boy got serenaded by the staff.

I don't think it's for everyone though due to the texture, which is very similar to Japanese kamaboko (that pink stuff that you get in a bowl of udon) or the fish balls you put in hot pot\n- Tom Yum Noodle Soup ($15): Good amount of seafood inside, and the broth was spicy and super flavorful. Loved that the egg noodles were cooked well, not soggy at all. The crispy wontons(?) on the side were a nice touch too.\n- Hat Yai Fried Chicken ($16): HIGHLIGHT of the meal! The fried chicken's breading was so so amazingly crispy on the outside. And the yellow curry was the most flavorful yellow curry I've ever had.

Go if you like flavorful, TASTY, delicious Thai food with a bit of spice. \n\nThe hefty portions are affordable in comparison to other \"hip\" Thai/Asian Fusion restaurants in SF), and the best part is that the food is TASTY (did I already say that?). If I could dream of what authentic Thai food tastes like, Farmhouse is pretty much close to what I would expect the real deal to be. As someone who personally loves salty, flavorful foods, Farmhouse nails the Hat Yai Fried chicken with curry, naan, and blue rice. The batter on the chicken has the perfect crunch and isn't dried like many other Thai fried chicken dishes that I've tried. My favorite part about this dish is the curry that's included - it simply makes everything all the more creamier and tastier! My boyfriend typically orders the Panang Neua, which is a slow braised bone in short rib in a panang curry with grilled broccolini, bell pepper, and blue rice. This is literally to die for. Again, I'll highlight the curry, which makes this dish as it adds creaminess, flavor and spice to the beef. \n\nBonus points for a fun, well decorated atmosphere! For a second, you might almost forget that you're in SF. \n\n*Caveat: although I deemed Farmhouse 5 stars, I must mention that the service can be off sometimes (the staff has forgotten to put an order in, mixed up an order, etc).

I could hardly eat it all, and almost wish I had known how big the portions would be so I could split it. \n\nNot the most vegeterain-friendly Thai though. Originally I had planned on ordering the Papaya salad, something a little less hearty and rich than curry, but was told the dressing used wasn't vegetarian and that there was no way to alter this dish to make it vegetarian. Kind of a disappointment and slightly annoying since Papaya salads are normally a veggie go-to (and how hard is it to just not add dressing to a salad?)\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is dressy, lively, not too noisy, low-lighting, hipster-Thai fusion fun.

I found it on yelp, made a reservation through yelp and could not wait to dine here, I really was very excited to try it out! \nFriday night we walked over from the office (1.6 mi. from Hayes Valley). BEWARE: Florida st and Treat is crackheads ghetto - Yikes! But it's ok, me and my gal pal made it through alive! SUGGESTION: Uber it. \n\nOnce we walked in, it felt like we left San Francisco and entered Thailand! The host/waiters were in costume or I should say, traditional Thai attire, and they all spoke with thick Thai accents; quite authentic. (Our jaws dropped). They asked if we had a reservation and I said, yes, so they immediately seated us. The decor on the other hand was so cool, very trendy with a modern twist. There was a wall display of water faucets with red handles.. hundreds of them, visually a pretty cool concept. The decor didn't seem to have any authentic Thai theme/motif, but it suited the place and I loved every inch of it. The overhead lamps looked nautical, I'm not sure if there is an intentional \"water\" theme of some sort, but whatever it was, it looked great! \n\nWhere do I begin with the food.. Ugh.. There's so much to say.. As I expected everything to be delicious.. It was! We ordered all the waiters suggestions:\nAhi Tuna appetizer - BEEE-U-TIFUL presentation and excellent tasting. \nPhai Char Shrimp - came with veggies and blue rice - Yum!\nBeef plate (not the beef noodle soup) - meat was so flavorful and tender it fell off the bone. Came with veggies and blue rice - perfection!\n\nTHEN.. came a little Thai man, in his Thai attire, carrying a pretty Thai display of Thai food. (Where has he been my whole life?!) Optional for $7 he offered a spicy red curry chicken bowl with veggies. The combination of fresh veggies was presented in a bowl made out of banana leaves to mix in with the red curry chicken).  Uhhhh.. Yes please! \nWe gobbled that right up! \n\nIf there weren't people around giving me dirty looks, I would have licked all the dishes clean.. ! \n\nWe washed everything down with a nice cold Belgium beer; much needed to cool the spice! \n\nFinally, dessert.. The chocolate thingy. (I forgot the name). It's the only chocolate item on the menu, served warm, you can't miss it.. It's so good, included vanilla ice cream! \n\nWe ordered a lot, bill came to $88 for 2 people including tip. I have to add, the service was exceptional, everyone was so kind and respectful, and humble I may add. \n\nThere,  that's it, I got it off my chest.. I absolutely loved this place! Location kinda sucks, border lining the crackheads ghetto. (Further down on Florida St at the corner of Treat.)   however, the restaurant is located in a residential area, looks as though it's a new development (not sure), but street parking is available. \n\nYes, I'll be back again and again and again..", "author": "Anie L."}

I have been rooting for farmhouse for so long and have spread the word to everyone how great it is. Now, I don't normally write reviews, this is actually my first ever review. Today, I was so beyond disappointed I felt compelled to write my first review. I had a reservation at 9:30pm. Which I understand is late. I came in and they sat us down very quickly. Then we received a very rushed server with attitude asking us if we knew what we wanted. Understanding that it's late and last call was in 15 min, we quickly responded since we've been here many times and know the menu inside and out. I could easily wave the rushed order, that's understandable, But that's not what disappointed me. So our order comes out, our usual, 2 chicken noodle soup dishes but it comes completely plain, no spice, although it says on the menu (SPICY!!). We order this almost every time we come here so we know how this dish is, and what we're signing up for since it normally comes out pretty red. Again, the plain soup was very understandable. Maybe miscommunication. So when we had a look of disappointment, they asked what's wrong and we let them know we're sorry but we usually order it spicy, and that it's okay we can keep them as they are. They took it back quickly without saying anything and come out rushing with new dishes and slammed it on our table. We would understand if it was busy at the time, but the Resteraunt was half-full. They were just trying to get people out fast. The dishes were un-editable spicy. I mean dangerous. I have never received this dish so outrageously, vengefully spicy. I had 2 bites before I had to quit. I saw copious amounts of large red chili flakes I have never seen in the dish before the other times I have ordered this. It's the kind that hit your throat and make you cough. They weren't supposed to be in there. I am so disappointed they would rather hurt their customers to prove a point, or try to fulfill a request so haphazardly that they added a sick abnormal made-up amount of spice to a dish. The next day, we were both sick to our stomachs, whether it was from the spice or food poisoning, I don't know. I have never been so disappointed with a Resteraunt. Eat here in the evening/night with caution. The service will be terrible.", "author": "Rachel L."}

My sister and I went on a random Wednesday evening and there was parking right outside. We didn't have a reservation so they were going to place us in the middle of the room, but we said we preferred to be against a wall. Although we pointed at the booths, she took us to an awkwardly small table that was right next to the bathroom. Um.\n\nBut let me get to the important part - FOOD:\n- complimentary salad (watch out, it has a kick!)\n- hat yai - chicken was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. roti nicely chewy. curry consistency very watery; would be better to be less sweet to offset all the oil/fried stuff on the plate\n- panang neau - blue rice was cool. just rice though? no special flavoring along with it. short rib was fall off the bone mmmm\n- drinks: sparking peach jelly, coco lada - sister had both of these drinks lol. She was surprised at the jelly bits inside the 1st cuz you can't see it. Said she couldn't taste the alcohol. 2nd one, she liked better cuz it was lighter. This one seemed bottomless! She kept drinking but the level would barely go down lol \n- fried crickets - didn't try, but it was cool how there was a server going around asking if people wanted to purchase some to try it!\n\nAll of these had AMAZING visuals - large portions, great color themes on the plates. I honestly want to say that the taste of all of these didn't blow me away, but they were very filling and we loved the different textures and flavors that they included. Service was great in the beginning, but as it got busier into the night (nice diverse crowd, btw), they got slightly negligent. About $85 with tip for all this. So yes, on the pricey side, but considering SF and everything, very worth it. Happy bellies = happy experiences. \n\n*** TL:DR - Cute and instagram-worthy + good food experience.

We went in for an early lunch and first impressions were really good.  The place was decorated very well and very modern.  There were still traces of new year decorations so it made the place really colorful and bright.  On one accent wall there was a art display of water hose faucets.  It was really cool and grabbed my attention instantly. \n\nNow for the food we ordered chicken wings to start and the waiter offered some egg rolls that weren't on the menu to try.  The wings were extra crispy and really good.  The eggrolls lacked some flavor and meat.  I didn't realize it was veg.  It came with the sweet dipping sauce but that didn't help much. \n\nMain course was pad ka pow with chicken.  It didn't come with rice, which I find to be a bit odd.  The waiter bought me some and to my surprise it was blue! Really cool as I've never had blue rice anymore.  The waiter assured me it is only food coloring and no flavoring is added.  The chicken was a bit over cooked.  As I bit into it, it tasted really dry and not tender at all.  However all the spices in the dish were really good.  Just a shame the chicken wasn't cooked right. \n\nMy bf had the chicken curry which was served with eggplant and bamboo.  Again a bit of a let down.  There was something off about the curry.  I can't really describe it but it didn't taste like how I expected it to taste.  Kind of a sharp unappealing taste.  It really is a shame since this is so close and it looks so chic inside!\n\nI may give it one more try since we live so close.", "author": "Nyla K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-09", "description": "Farmhouse is near the top with Kin Khao for posh, Thai food, and apparently everyone in the Mission agrees because both times I've been there have been a wait - make a reservation! In order to have a positive experience, I think it's essential you order the right dishes. \n\nOrder These:\n* Chai Latte - 4 stars: Creamy, rich, flavorful. So good.\n* Herbal Rice Salad - 3.5 stars: If you like Burmese tea leaf salad you would love their take which includes purple, herbal rice. It was a little too sweet for me, but a must-order for first timers.\n* Panang Neua (short rib) - 4 stars: Fall off the bone tender, and great flavor. Note: The beef still has some structure, but I enjoyed it still.\n* Beef Noodle Soup (short rib soup) - 4 stars: Soup version of panang neua (so choose one or the other).\n* Coconut dessert - 5 stars: Fresh coconut served with sticky rice. MY GOD. So fresh and so good, and I don't even like fresh coconut much. \n\nPretty Good:\n* Bacon wrapped Scallop - 3.5 stars: Good, juicy, and bigger than other places. A little pricey though at about $3/pop. \n* Thai Crispy Rolls - 3.5 Stars: Clear noodles in egg roll format. Good, but could be more flavorful. Would get again.\n* Spicy Eggplant Side 3.5 stars: Good, but standard. \n\nPass on These:\n* Chicken Satay - 2 stars: Dry, served with sauce that tastes straight up like peanut butter. Liked the roti.\n* Kai Yang (BBQ chicken) - 2 stars: Pros: smokey, comes with papaya salad and sticky rice. Cons: Sticky rice seemed under-cooked. Chicken was dry and mushy at once, didn't like the flavor. $18!\n* Tom Yum - 3 stars: Pretty average flavor. Prefer the 24-hour beef noodle soup.\n* Green curry noodles: A little bland, especially when paired with the noodles.", "author": "Jess C."}

We understand that the place is often busy, and many people are waiting, but we don't go to any restaurant just to eat. There is some sort of hectic atmosphere in this place. For example, I take the last piece of food from one of my pates and put my fork down; Momentarily one of the staff members\u200b grabs the empty\u200b place from the table. Just chill a little.

Good thing I made a reservation through Yelp because it was very crowded on a Friday night! Cute, modern decor and food comes out quite fast.\nWe ordered the fried chicken and the beef shank. Huge portions! I liked the curry that came with the fried chicken but the beef shank was quite salty. Both dishes came with a scoop of pretty bluish purple rice. I tried the house soda as well and wasn't a fan. It reminded me of plum juice.\nFor dessert we ordered the Thai vacation which was vanilla ice cream served in a coconut with coconut meat and sticky rice, and requested to leave off the peanuts.\nService was kind of stifling. While you ate, they were nonexistent but as soon as you look full they seemed in a rush to make you leave. While we were waiting for the bathroom and check, a waitress bluntly said to me \"A bunch of people are waiting for you to finish\". I've never experienced something that blatant in a restaurant!

We also ordered the classic Thai tea and an elderflower spritzer. The food came out very quickly and was DELICIOUS! Some of the best Thai food I've had. Highly recommend the yat Thai chicken and if you're looking for a light starter, the spring rolls are perfect. Another great thing about this restaurant was the service. My boyfriend mentioned to our server that it was my birthday, which resulted in a fun hat, Polaroid, complementary dessert, and birthday song. We left without picking up our Polaroid and the server ran after us to hand us the unexpected gift! \nAll in all, I will definitely be returning here when I visit SF again. Hands down one of my favorite restaurants with great food, service and accommodations-- I highly recommend it. Thanks for making my 21st so fun!", "author": "Jj S."}

Service was exceptionally friendly and attentive. \n\nWe walked in without a reservation on a weekend for a group of 4 and there was only one spot available at a small table. I'd definitely recommend getting a reservation beforehand. The table was a little too small and we could barely fit all the dishes we ordered on there.\n\nWe got the street fair baby shrimp fritters ($9) as an appetizer. I thought this was just okay and probably would try something else on the menu next time. Highlight of the meal for the entire table was the 24 hours beef noodle soup ($18). The beef was extremely tender and the veal broth was so flavorful. It is the perfect dish for cold San Francisco weather. The panang neua ($22) was tasty but if you're going to get beef short rib I would go with the beef noodle soup. The pad thai ($14) was good but didn't stand out to me. Really enjoyed the spicy eggplant side dish ($9). There were great garlic and basil flavors!\n\nOverall excellent choice for Thai food especially if you're looking for a nice dining experience.", "author": "Linda X."}

But be warned, you're probably going to spend around $30 if you order food and drinks. (Worth it, at least every now and then.)\n\nOne thing to immediately notice is the decor, which is kind of modern and hipster. There's one wall that is pretty distinct which is entirely covered with sprinkler heads (no idea where they got them). Definitely not your typical Thai place decor. They also have really huge single bathrooms, which are kind of overkill. (In the words of my coworker, \"I think the reason why we have a housing problem in SF is these gigantic bathrooms.\")\n\nIn any case, the food is fantastic. I've ordered the Mok Salmon and the Panang Neua (braised short rib), both of which feature incredibly juicy and tender meats that are served with flavorful sauces and soft blue rice. I'm a big fan of the blue rice, but willing to admit that it may just be the blueness tricking me into thinking that it's special... I've also stolen bites of several other dishes from my fellow diners (friends, not random people), which have also tasted amazing, so I think it's fair to say that you can't go wrong with the menu here (especially the \"Specials\" section).\n\nThere's also a wide drink selection, of which the whole young coconut is my favorite - cool, refreshing, and naturally sweet. Plus you can scrape out the juicy fruit insides when you're done! It's super tempting and I usually end up caving and ordering a coconut even though I think is a bit too pricey at $6.50.\n\nFinally, they accept reservations online via Yelp, which is always a plus. Definitely will be back for some amazing Thai food (and to gawk at the huge bathrooms)!", "author": "Brittany C."}

We started the meal with young coconuts which I thought was neat. We all certainly got our fill of tasty coconut water. The appetizer selection was impressive, I would have eaten almost everything on it! The beef rolls were so, so, good. The beef melted in your mouth and the sauce they put on it was fantastic.\n\nFor my main dinner I went with the fried chicken. The presentation of the dish alone was really impressive. The dish was great and the curry dipping sauce that came with it really complimented the fried chicken well. The dish was huge and could have easily been shared by two people. The blue rice was tasty, just your standard rice.\n\nNow on to the piece de resistance, the dessert tray. It was my birthday and they put a candle in it which I always appreciate. The desserts were soooo good. I am a sucker for mango sticky rice so that was great. I also loved the coconut ice cream that had sticky rice hidden underneath. \n\nThe staff was so friendly and accommodated our large party without one snafu.

What a fun Thai restaurant. \n\nI went for the first time this evening with two friends and really enjoyed not only the food but also the ambiance! I noticed that the back wall was decorated with what seemed like at least 50 sink faucets!! The staff were all dressed in Hawaiian shirts, some even with fun eye makeup and hair-- definitely a quirky crew. For a Wednesday evening, it was well packed. \n\nWe ordered the popular Hat Yai Fried Chicken, Thai Street Green Curry Noodles, Chicken Noodle Soup, Pad Cabbage, and Taro and Black Sticky Rice. (Note that the portions are on the generous side. For three petite girls, three main dishes meant lots of leftovers!) \n\nI ordered the Fried Chicken dish, and it was absolutely delicious! Super juicy and the batter was very nicely done --  a thin, crispy layer that tasted freshly fried! It came with roti bread on top, blue rice (not sure if this is authentic, but definitely trendy), and a bowl of yellow curry. Wow, was that satisfying. The cabbage was decent, nothing super special. Though I didn't try the Green Curry Noodles or the Chicken Noodle Soup, both of my friends thoroughly enjoyed their dishes. From what I heard, the soup was definitely on the spicy side...and if you're adventurous, try the blood jelly in the Green Curry Noodles (which didn't have a super distinct flavor but gave me goosebumps thinking about what I was eating). Our waiter brought out a huge apron for my friend who ordered the Green Curry Noodles, apparently everyone who orders that dish has to wear the special apron, lol. The Taro Sticky Rice was a pleasant finish, which came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and coconut flakes. The sticky rice had a surprising, smoky flavor to it. It was wrapped in banana leaves and perhaps heated over a grill/charcoal. \n\nAfter we finished our meal, we noticed a waiter walking around with a large basket...of grilled insects! Yes, grasshopper and some type of silver worm. Appetizer/dessert anyone?\n\nHaha, I definitely will be telling my friends about this place. Hope to be back soon.", "author": "Christine T."}

Yup, you read that correctly. It was phenomenal, the spice level was just right (I asked for medium), the new meats were a fun addition, and everything just tasted SO good.\n\nAnd as if all that wasn't enough, for dessert (and because it was our dear friend and coworker's birthday), they brought out these insane dessert platters filled with all sorts of Thai-inspired dessert delicacies.

At 8 pm with lines out the door and a packed house with a trendy interior and hip looking waiters, we eagerly waited for our table. We had a reservation for 8:15, but had friends who were late, so they wouldn't seat us until everyone was there. Our friends arrived at 8:45 and then we waited sadly and hangrily as many other groups got seated before us and as the waiters arranged and rearranged and then re-rearranged other tables.  We finally got seated around 9 and ordered immediately. The papaya salad came first, and was so spicy that we left half of the dish unfinished.  The fried chicken was yummy, but everything else we ordered (minus the blue/green tinted rice) was remnant of traditional Thai fare.  Maybe I was hangry, but I was unimpressed by the food for the price.\n\nThis place seems like it would be good for party groups who want to share scorpion bowls.

Overall I'd say 3.5 stars.\n\nThe first time I ordered from here I got the Neua Num Tok Rolls and a large Tom Yum soup. The rolls were decent, and the beef was juicy and quite tender. I think an herb would have tied the flavors together better. I was so blown away by the intense and delicious flavors of the soup, couldn't get enough. I was also sick, and this totally hit the spot. I thought, \"I can't wait to order from here again!\"\n\nSecond time around, had a friend in town and we were craving spicy food, so I suggested Farmhouse. I can't say my second experience was even close to the first. I ordered the Hat Yai Fried Chicken and friend ordered Phad Thai. The Phad thai didn't have much flavor and the fried chicken was extremely greasy and didn't hold the breading. I did however, admire the pretty blue rice. The curry it came with was delicious, and was a little sad at the inconsistency of flavors across dishes. \n\nWell, at least I know what to order next time! \n\nBoth my experiences here have been with delivery and both times the driver called and asked me to come downstairs instead of bringing it up and no forks, knives, or napkins were included.

We made a reservation on fairly short notice. After 3 or 4 visits to restaurants that were packed this was a welcome find. It was so nice to just walk in and get seated right away instead of the \"it's an hour wait\" greeting we'd been getting.\n\nWhich was surprising because Farmhouse is pretty great and would warrant a long wait, for sure. But I won't complain about that!\n\nSo yes, we were seated right away and brought over menus. Something of note--it's beer and wine only. I had thought longingly of a delightful tropical cocktail of sorts but alas, there were none except a couple of beer cocktails. Not the end of the world, I just ordered a young coconut (to fulfill my need for something tropical and delightful) and some wine instead. That was just fine and dandy.\n\nThe coconut in particular was awesome. That fresh, refreshing coconut water and that delicious coconut flesh was fantastic to snack on.\n\nSpeaking of snacking on, we also ordered a couple of appetizers--the vegan spring rolls with peanut sauce and the par dip fresh tuna. Both were awesome.\n\nFor my entree I went with the Kai Yang, Som Tum which was half a BBQ chicken marinated in turmeric and coconut milk served with papaya salad, sweet plum sauce and black sweet sticky rice. The chicken was phenomenal. Really really good. I loved every bite of it. The salad actually had a bit of a kick to it and as someone who is a little bit (okay, more than a little bit) of a wimp with heat I had to pace myself. The black sticky rice was interesting. I thought it tasted good but the texture was a bit chewy and dry. It didn't really TASTE dry, so I didn't dislike it, but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. But I would absolutely get that dish again, if only for the chicken. \n\nThe presentation on all items was also really cool. My entree in particular came out with the rice in a bamboo container, chicken on cool roasting skewers, etc. I was overwhelmed in a good way when it was brought out the table. Very impressive.

A group of five of us came for dinner mid week and the place was packed from the time we entered to the time we left. The atmosphere is a cool mix of hawker, regular restaurant, wall full of faucets. Thai music plays  while the waiters run around wearing traditional thai long shorts/ short pants. \n\nMenu isn't crazy big but it is filled with a lot of interesting things with elaborate names. The problem with this is that you have to kinda translate it and edit the dish down to what is really is. Like just to describe say basically \"beef\" it says \"Grilled Snake River Farm Wagyu Flank Steak\" so you get kinda like \"wait what i'm getting snake from a river farm grilled?\" for half a second. I hate it when things use too many words to describe things. That drives me nuts. So after translating the menu, we decided to order the following: \n\nMieng Kum Kung - which is fried prawns on top of some delicious crunchy things on top of a leaf. Gorgeous and delicious dish. \nThai Sausage - good but a little boring - just sliced up sausages on top of some cucumber slices. \nTom Yum Soup - super spicy and flavorful. Very delicious but nothing unusual. \nBeef Salad\nPork Belly Salad - Both were amazing and we were all sweating with smiles on our faces while eating it. It was so spicy but so crazy flavorful. It was served with slices of plain cabbage which made a perfect compliment to the fatty meats in savory spicy sauce. \nHat Yai Fried Chicken - Fried chicken was good - no bones, comes with a curry on the side and special blue rice - not sure what makes it blue or why it's  blue but it's got a different taste than regular rice and it was delicious. \nThai Street Green Curry Noodles - Kinda boring and disappointing. It sounded a lot better than what actually showed up which was a bland green curry, and some noodles on the side. It also had a bunch of raw vegetables on the side. \n\nAfter having the super flavorful beef salad and pork belly salad and soup- the two entrees seemed really bland and overall didn't taste like much. \n\nA surprise element was kinda like dim sum service where a waitress came around and asked us if we wanted small dishes. Of course we wanted off the menu daily dishes and they were a fantastic choice. The first surprise dish was a spicy sausage salad, just some small sausage slices with lettuce and chilis and onions. So good that we ended up ordering more at the end of our meal to end on a spicy note. The second dish that came around was grasshoppers. I'd highly recommend them. They are a great source of protein and they're just tasty crunchy snack. It's a little weird to see their heads but whatever. \n\nFor dessert we had the Thai Vacation - half a coconut filled with a black sticky rice, vanilla ice cream, and topped with coconut cream. Not only beautiful presentation but delicious. They also had a dessert option for 2-4 people. Looked like a chef's choice of desserts that they said was very instagram worthy - so I applaud them for their sale description because they know what's important to the people (IG worthy or not). \n\nThe overall experience was fantastic from start to finish.", "author": "Veronica L."}

I came here with a group of 4 on a Thursday and we were able to get same day reservations for dinner. When we got here it was packed though! The place isn't big so definitely make a reservation. Make sure your whole party is there though, we weren't able to get seated until everyone arrived. Once you are seated service is fast and attentive. Our water was constantly refilled and food came fast as well!\n\nThe food here is some of the best in SF in my opinion. Prices are high, but they have specials that are a bit different from traditional thai dishes. Also, portion sizes are huge. Two girls can definitely share an entree and an appetizer. My friend ordered a thai-chelada which she really enjoined. For food, I ordered the Hat Yai Fried Chicken. If you like fried food you need to get this. The chicken is fried in a tempura-like way and super crispy and flavorful. The curry that comes with it is just as good. It's not too sweet, but there is also a side of honey as a dipping sauce for the chicken. The flavors and textures paired together surprisingly well. The Thai Street Green Curry Noodles were also raved about and my friend loved it. \n\nThis place is cute too. Extra points for the little succulent that they put on our table.", "author": "Ellen M."}

When my colleagues and I arrived, we were smitten with the space right away. It's bright and airy with plenty of wood (tables, floor) and I particularly loved the antique sewing machine that doubles as the hostess stand. \n\nFarmhouse Kitchen is the third restaurant from the folks who started Kitchen Story and Blackwood. Definitely start your meal off with a whole young coconut to drink. As soon as you take a sip you'll feel like you're on vacation at the edge of the Mission! I took the lead in ordering a wide selection of the menu for us four ladies to feast upon. From samosas and satay to Penang curry and papaya salad, we sampled a lot. \n\nThe stand out for me was the Hat Yai. This Thai-style fried chicken was mega crispy and juicy and I loved the blue rice, potato curry and roti that accompanied it. \n\nAt the conclusion of our main dishes, I couldn't resist ordering the dessert platter. My dining companions groaned, but who doesn't want a bite of every dessert on the menu? If you can only order one, make it the mango and sticky rice. The mangoes are impossibly ripe and pair perfectly with the sweet and salty sticky rice!\n\nI noticed when I paid the bill that all of our dishes had been marked \"mild\". This may be the default but I wish we'd been asked when ordering what spice level we preferred. I know I definitely could've handled a little more heat.\n\nFarmhouse Kitchen definitely has all the Thai staples you're used to, but I like their unique takes on less familiar dishes.

We ended not getting the dessert platter because it was $22 and was served for four people. Next time! \n\nFOOD: Love the presentation! It gives off a farm vibe with rice in a weaved basket and grilled chicken between sticks and salad in a bowl. This was for the Tum Som Chicken Chef Special $18. Rice was a little too clumpy and hard for my taste. But chicken was pretty good - the thigh was nice and moist whereas the breast was on the drier side. Neither of us were fans of the sauce and the salad was a tad too spicy for me (I don't take spicy too well). \nPanang Curry $10 - we got this with crispy slices of bread instead of rice. Decent portion, but the spice for the basil was too overpowering for my taste. It took away from the panang side of the dish a little. But if you love powerful spice, you would like this! They also have complimentary sweet potato chips! \n\nSERVICE: Pretty tentative & friendly service \n\nAMBIANCE: The building reminds me of a farm x warehouse kinda vibe with hipster x traditional thai decorations.

He was carrying baskets of assorted fried vegetables and asked if we wanted some. I mean.... DUH! I'm not going to turn away a basketful of fried crunchy treats. I also got the green curry with beef and blue rice. It was so delicious. Green curry is already my favorite, but this was excellent. The vegetables were warm and tender, but still had a crispiness to them. The curry was thinner than I had normally had it, but not watery. I didn't notice a huge difference in flavor, but the blue rice was really gorgeous. \n\nThe atmosphere as a whole was so fun. It was trendy and modern, but had authentic and traditional decor as well. The bathroom was large and very clean. I am looking forward to my next meal here!", "author": "Isabella G."}

You get the farmhouse vibe right away. I've been here once for dinner and another time for lunch. \n\nMy dinner of Hat Yai fried chicken was super delish. Anything fried is yummy anyway. \n\nI was not very happy with my Kai Yang, Som Tum for lunch. The menu says the chicken is marinated in turmeric and coconut milk, and I barely tasted it. I had to ask for more dipping sauce (think more tangy vinegary, but sweet sauce) for flavor. The papaya salad is also spicy so I recommend asking for a substitution. Black sticky rice was black sticky rice. \n\nService is nice, and waters regularly refilled. Would I make this a regular spot to visit? Probably not since Kitchen Story is closer for me.

Love the eclectic/traditional decor, which set the mood for dinner. I came around 6:30 and there was already a 30 min wait for 2. Ended up sitting at the bar, which ended up to be a better experience (in my opinion). The bartender was super accommodating, along with all of the servers who kept on refilling our drinks or taking away plates. \nI had the Hat Yai Fried Chicken and it was BOMB. The chicken was so on point, I can't! It had a super crispy and light taste, and with that sweet and sour sauce they served on the side, you have no choice but to shove your face. The potato curry was delicious too but a tad too sweet for my liking. Still, it made for a great sauce for the blue rice. \nMy boyfriend had the curry chicken and noodle bowl and he said it was amazing. I liked it too. There was just the right amount of heat, and the chicken was tender. \nOverall, amazing experience. By the time we were finished dinner, the place was packed. Parking is sort of hard to find, but this is San Fran, so expect that?! Luckily the street parking opened up at 6 so we literally grabbed the last spot close by. \nIf I'm ever in San Fran again, I'll definitely be back!", "author": "Heather L."}

It goes like this:\n\nAgent: Sorry we have no mid-size available at the moment\nJerry: I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?\nAgent: Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars\nJerry: But the reservation keeps the car here! That's why you have the reservation!\nAgent: I know why we have reservations\nJerry: I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to HOLD the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them!\n\nThat's kinda what happened to us on a Friday night here. Made an 8:15 reservation, we get there and there's no host and a bunch of people waiting around Wait 10 mins until we finally get attention from someone, and we're asked to wait another 10-15 minutes. Wait? What? This where I go \"I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?\" and they say something like: \"Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of tables.\"\n\nI mean what's the point of treating reservations like a wait list. Reservations are part of delivering someone a good experience because let's face it, waiting sucks. I made a reservation because I don't wanna wait almost half hour for a table.\n\nAnyway, after that whole ordeal the service was fine from there although it seemed like a lot of other people were also waiting around to get there reservations fulfilled so I'm inclined to believe this happens a lot.\n\nWhat I love about this place though is the ambiance. The decor really sets the mood. It's a bit loud but that's kinda the point.  They also have people coming around serving various exotic Thai snacks. This is when I tried fried grasshoppers for the first (and last!) time.\n\nPlating was pretty nice and made everything feel authentic. The food was generally good but I can't say it's much better than your typical goto Thai joint that's probably half the price of this. I got the Fried Chicken with curry dipping sauce. Curry great, chicken mediocre.\n\nWould like to give this place another shot and try more of their dishes but it's hard to justify the wait (even with a reservation) for, like I said, food that isn't much better than nearby cheaper options.", "author": "Andrew D."}

Not super special but very good\n\n- mango salad with prawns - great robust flavors  and fresh!\n\n- crispy pork belly salad - pretty good, the pork had a good ratio of fat and was very crispy\n\n- chicken and rice - my favorite dish of the night - I have had better in SF (check out Amphawa) but this was still great.  The chicken was moist and tender and the rice was fragrant.  The dipping sauces were delicious too.  \n\n- beef noodle soup - it was ok.  Noodles were soggy, broth had too much cloves(?) but the beef rib was rich flavored and tender\n\n- yellow curry with pork - decent but not super special\n\n- fried chicken - once of the weakest dishes tonight - so dry!  Came with delicious roti and curry sauce though\n\n- pad see you with ground pork - this was great!! - strong delicious flavors and good ratio of protein to noodles (actually could probably use more noodles).  \n\n- dessert platter - loooooved this.  The bread pudding was phenomenal as was the warm chocolate cake (decadent yet not overly sweet, my fav).  \n\nLove the ambiance in here as well - nice combination of feeling like your in Thailand but also at a hipster Mission place (if you can imagine that)", "author": "Olivia T."}

I gathered a bunch of friends here for dinner Saturday night.\n\nFirst of all, the plates are YUGE. Good luck finishing one yourself unless you have a big appetite. Most of my friends ended up splitting two dishes, which ended up being the smart thing to do. We also split some appetizers: Thai fish cakes and calamari with cilantro lime sauce. Enjoyed these, but nothing too special. I'd recommend skipping the appetizers since the entrees are so filling.\n\nThe Hat Yai ($18) seems to be the most popular dish here, and it did not disappoint. The chicken was so flavorful and roti bread was perfect for dipping into the curry. The blue rice was a bit novel but didn't actually taste too different than white rice. While I loved the 24-hour beef noodle soup ($18) with slow cooked bone-in beef short rib and veal broth, I do wish there were more egg noodles. The short rib was unbelievable. Both entrees were really solid!\n\nThe restaurant itself is trendy as hell and roomy enough for large groups. In fact, there was a table of 20+ people sitting behind us!

And there were only about 10~12 customers dining. No need to wait. Wow, how lucky we were! The weather was good, the environment was bright, and people there were all with the great smile. Such a relaxed atmosphere that I would recommend people who like to take dinner earlier just come here.  \n\nWe had 2 special: Neua Yang Steak & Panang Neua, and 1 classical Thai tea. The steak in medium rare tasted good, and the sauce was worthy to try for people who love to explore new flavors--the combination could give you some new inspiration. And, I really like the ginger rice with the steak. It was not too hard nor too soft, just right.  \nAs to the Panan Neua, I love it! Although it was really a big size for me that I could only finish about half of it, I still couldn't stop. When those multi vegetables went with the super delicious curry sauce and the hashed sweet potato, not only the flavor but also the texture became a nice balance as a whole.

There was absolutely no parking for blocks in radius and we were JUST about to give up and go somewhere else when a car pulled out right in front of the restaurant and we were able to snag the spot! Inside is bigger than it looked on the outside, with nice decor and a shiny stone wall on one side where the bar is. The place was fairly packed and parties waiting by the door to get their seats. Luckily we made an advanced reservation and waited only 10 minutes. This place is very loud, casual dressing, mostly white collar people wanting to relax after a long week. \nI ordered the panang curry with seafood combo, with the famous blue jasmine rice plus extra roti bread, that was crispy and fresh pan fried. Reminds me of a green onion pancake without the green onions. The flavor of the curry was strong, sweet and spicy, embedded with calamari, shrimp, pieces of tender fish fillet (tilapia?), chopped red peppers and fresh basil leaves. I drank it up. The rice tastes normal, just blue, so no hesitation needed if you got it and didn't know what to expect.\nThe boyfriend ordered a tom yum noodle soup with seafood as well. Same types of seafood as mine, flavorful broth and he ate all the noodles! So I think he liked it. :)\nOh yeah they also gave us pickled radish and carrots, sweet and sour, like Vietnamese style.\nThere was also a man carrying two dishes on a stuck on his back, offering free samples of something but we were too full at the end of our meal to try. It's a fun plus to have though.\nOverall, I enjoyed the experience. It truly reminds me of Kitchen Story, with the menu it offered, but just a way bigger and louder crowd. If the parking wasn't so bad, I'd be inclined to come back, but I have to stick with Kitchen Story since it's much closer and more intimate.", "author": "Alice S."}

But that all changed when I dined at Farmhouse Kitchen last night.\n\nSure, this restaurant offers the usual Thai suspects (curries, noodles, Tom Kah, papaya salad, etc.). However, what makes Farmhouse Kitchen stand out is their unusual menu offerings. I'm talking about dishes like Ahi Tuna Scoops, the Neua Num Tok Rolls (Grilled snake river farm wagyu flank steak wrapped with mint, cilantro, cucumber served with cilantro lime vinaigrette), and the Herbal Rice Salad (made with toasted coconut, peanuts, shredded green mango, crispy shallots, lemongrass, cilantro, sliced long beans, chili, kaffir lime, dried shrimp with tamarind dressing). And those are just the starters!\n\nFor my main course, I ordered the much-Yelped-about Hat Yai Fried Chicken (crispy chicken breast seasoned with turmeric and herbs, and served with fried shallots roti bread, and potato yellow curry for dipping. This dish more than lived up to its hype in both presentation and taste. My dining companions feasted on the Panang Curry Chicken, the 24 Hours Beef Noodle Soup (slow cooked bone-in beef short rib, egg noodles, veal broth, broccolini, basil, bean sprouts, cilantro, green onion and house pork fat garlic oil), and the Mekong Fish Cakes (White fish, fresh kaffir lime, red curry paste, sliced long bean served with cucumber peanut relish). Everything was beautifully plated and fan-freakin-tastic. Although I'm not much of a beer drinker, a bottle of Singha was the perfect way to balance the Thai spices.\n\nService was friendly and attentive. Given how busy the restaurant was, I was surprised by how quick the food came out. This kitchen is a smooth running culinary assembly line. They clearly know what they're doing.\n\nAlthough we sampled a variety of dishes, we barely scratched the surface. I can't wait to come back and explore more of this eclectic menu.", "author": "Kevin B."}

I was pleasantly surprised at the modern yet farmhouse ambiance paired with such interesting Thai cuisine.  Every item that we ordered was plated with such care and detail.  The flavors in the food were authentic and highly enjoyable.  Between the four of us, we had the pleasure of trying several dishes.\n\nTwo of my favorite dishes of the night were the Hat Yai Fried Chicken & the 24 hr Beef Noodle Soup.  The fried chicken was perfect in every way.  It wasn't too greasy, the chicken was moist on the inside and had wonderful flavor.  The beef noodle soup was superb, if you ask me.  The meat fell of the bone and the noodles were tender.  The flavor of the soup was absolutely comforting.  \n\nI would definitely come back again for the food.  The wait staff was OK.  I didn't feel like customer service was all there.  They were prompt to take our order and also clearing the table was quick....but I felt customer service during the night was lacking a little.  Perhaps it was just an off night.", "author": "Vindy C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-21", "description": "3.5 stars\n\nFarmhouse is a quirky/hip Thai restaurant in the Mission. The food was pretty good, but service was not so great - we waited at least 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. When someone finally did, we ordered the Panang Neua (bone in short rib curry) and the Hat Yai (fried chicken with roti and potato curry dipping sauce and some sort of sweet sauce). Both were also served with blue rice, which made the dishes look really interesting, but it just tasted like normal rice. Not sure why it's blue.\n\nMy bf thought the short rib was OK; the meat was tough and the sauce was heavy, but the broccolini was a nice touch. I thought the Hat Yai was better; the boneless fried chicken was tender and had just enough breading and the dipping sauces were flavorful. I love roti, but this roti wasn't as soft as others I've had. We also ordered the \"Thai Vacation\" for dessert, which was vanilla ice cream, sesame, peanuts, coconut cream, and real shaved coconut served in an empty coconut shell.  It had a nice presentation and was delicious, but I would have preferred a more tropical ice cream flavor. All in all, a cool Thai restaurant, but I think you'd be paying more for the ambience than the food.", "author": "Stephanie G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-07-09", "description": "Extremely overrated and overpriced. You are paying for expensive SF overheads and a hip scene. I get it, everyone is impressed by the fried chicken dish, but come on folks let's try to move beyond that novelty and look at the entirety of the menu . Would not eat here again. Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons:\n\nPros: \n-Fresh herbs, traditional pungent flavors\n-Flavor profile of most dishes close to what you would get in Thailand versus Americanized Thai Cuisine (sweet and not herbal or complex)\n\nCons:\n- pricing is ridiculously high for small portions. Many dishes run between $20- $28 for factory farm beef/pork.\n- some dishes such as the rice salad ($14) are syrupy-sweet.\n- green curry noodles ($20) are very disappointing. Simply a bowl of green curry with a small side of mushy overcooked vermicelli rice noodles. Again, not sure what justifies the price. Chicken was full of tiny very sharp bones. \n- dishes are small and not meant for Asian style sharing. When I asked for more rice noodles because there wasn't enough to share among the four of us, our waiter told us portions are meant to be for \"one person only\" we were then charged $5 for an additional tiny side of mushy vermicelli  noodles. Would one person really want to eat an entire bowl of green curry and nothing else? \n- fish cake was rubbery with no detectable kaffir lime. \n- despite use fresh herbs many of the dishes were not layered or complex. I love spicey but  every dish was overwhelming even thoughwe ordered medium. This place was so one-dimensional couldn't taste any of the other flavors. This is a typical trick of some new Thai places to make people believe they're eating authentic Thai food by simply cranking up the heat.\n- the tarot and rice dessert is unimaginative--simply mashed Taro on top of a bed of rice with sugar and some coconut milk.\n- at least four or five times the waiter tried to take away dishes that still had plenty of food on them. We found ourselves fighting him off for the majority of the meal. It eventually became so comical that at least it brought some good laughs.\n\nThe people running this restaurant are very smart and savvy, they've tapped into a very young \"hip\" consumer base in San Francisco that doesn't care about paying twice the price for something with no justification.\n\nFor those Thai food aficionados interested in an  authentic experience checkout the plethora of Thai restaurants on San Pablo Avenue in Albany which are less than half the price of Farmhouse.", "author": "Earls C."}

We had green curry, pad se ew, and the mango crab salad. \n\nThe other frustrating thing is that for a fairly large restaurant there was only one bathroom.

The 2 appetizers that I have tried were really good - it was the vegetarian spring rolls (which surprisingly tasted good but it's because of the yummy peanut sauce it's served with) and the thai sausages (which were super flavorful and sweet...). I also was able to try the Pad See Ew, the Red Chicken Curry, and the Yellow Tofu Curry. All of these were very very tasty and full of flavor. I thought the portion sizes were kinda small as I could finish it on my own (which i usually can't). Overall, really reallly yummy tasting foods (but not sure if they are worth the price to you)!

It was perfect because you could add or leave as much milk as you would like. We then shared the vegan spring rolls which came with a nice thick rice paper wrap and the best peanut sauce I have ever had. For entree I got the crab fried rice which had sooo much fresh crab, it was a really great value for money. The portion was also huge and easily enough for two people.

We decided to sit at the bar - and actually we should have just sat there to begin with and I recommend this for small groups w/o reservations. The atmosphere was lively - loud music, colorful lights, hipster design etc. Unfortunately - my group was less into eating adventurously so we had samosas and thai fried rice.

There was a really cool live show that night with Thai classical music and dance.\n\nThe food was delicious and very filling!

The atmosphere was slightly more trendy, but not as night-clubby as an Osha Thai. \n\nWe ordered the Khan-Toke set and the Hat Yai Fried Chicken. The fried chicken had a different batter -- not buttermilk but more of the fish and chips style batter. The meat was still incredibly juicy though. The yellow curry sauce was great for dipping the roti in. The set was a great way to try a little bit of several different items. The black 'sticky' rice was so sticky that it was actually rather hard and difficult to chew through. I'm not sure if that was the intention, but I gave up on it about a quarter of the way through. Other than that, all the other ingredients were very fresh and flavorful.\n\nWe also ordered the matcha tea, but they brought out a genmaicha green tea instead.

I've gone with a reservation, without a reservation, and an hour before closing, and every time I've had to wait 30+ minutes.\n\nTip #3: There's a decent amount of street parking around the restaurant. You might have to circle a few times and walk a few blocks. \n\nOverall: The food at Farmhouse Thai is amazing.

And this was no different, delicious fried flavor, sauce, and all!\n\n*  Hat Yai Fried Chicken - Another very tasty and flavorful dish, that suffered a bit because the chicken itself was too dry. If they get to a point where they can consistently keep this juicy, I can easily see this becoming a favorite of mine.\n\n* Neua Yang Steak - Great, great flavor here too, but, like my experience at Cockscomb, our medium rare steak came out more like a rare steak. Remind me to confirm with restaurants what medium and medium rare means to them next time?\n\n* Seafood Fried Rice - I guess from the list of ingredients I shouldn't have been entirely surprised, but this was another somewhat bland dish, especially compared to the crab fried rice at Ler Ros.\n\n* 24 Hours Beef Noodle Soup - A simple dish in appearance, but wholesome and good nonetheless.\n\nMind you, this is no where near Lers Ros tier deliciousness, but what you lose in flavor, you gain in decor and ambiance: Farmhouse has easier parking, less sketchy surroundings, a more spacey interior, and, perhaps most important, a lower overall volume that allows for easier conversation.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Large and spacious, with a good amount of spacing between tables, so accessibility isn't much of an issue.\n\nBathroom - Accessible!", "author": "Johnny W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-13", "description": "TLDR - overpriced, small portions of Americanized Thai food in a nice, trendy restaurant; far from authentic Thai, just okay as Asian fusion\n\nMy first time trying Farmhouse Kitchen was through Caviar and thought the food was okay. More recently, I stopped by for dinner. It was pretty busy for late on a Friday night, but it wasn't more than maybe a 10 minute wait for a table for 2.\n\nThe restaurant definitely isn't your typical authentic Thai joint. It's nicely decorated and has more of that trendy, Asian fusion vibe. There's table and bar seating as well as a large table that looks like it might normally be used as a communal table if there isn't a large group dining in.\n\nFood overall is just okay. It's definitely Asian fusion/Americanized Thai food, so don't expect anything authentic from here. The portion sizes are pretty small, especially given the prices, but I guess that shouldn't be too unexpected given the ambiance of the place.\n\nWe ordered: \n\n-THAI FISH CAKES ($9) - 4/5\n[white fish, fresh kaffir lime, red curry paste, sliced long bean; served w/ cucumber peanut relish]\nSurprisingly pretty good! Not as good as the fish cakes I had in the streets of Thailand, but I'd definitely recommend it. If you've never had fish cakes before, they're sort of like fish patties with the texture similar to the fish/shrimp balls that you put in hotpot. These had decent flavor and the cucumber relish was refreshing\n\n-MOK SALMON ($18) - 2/5\n[grilled salmon in banana leaf, oyster mushroom, lemongrass, dill, shallots, grilled asparagus\nspicy cilantro lime sauce; served w/ blue rice]\nSo disappointing. Definitely miles away from authentic fish amok (which is much creamier), but also disappointing as a salmon dish itself. I love salmon, but this was on the dry side and lacking flavor. I didn't think the cilantro sauce really went with it either. I also don't really understand what the blue rice is. Tastes like normal rice.\n\n-RED CURRY ($13) - 3/5\n[bell pepper, bamboo shoots, basil; served w/ jasmine rice]\nWe got ours with chicken. Pretty average curry. Might've done better with more heat.\n\nFrom my prior review/Caviar experience, I got:\n\n-NEUA NUM TOK ($12.10) - 3/5\n[grilled marinated flank steak wrapped w/ mint, cilantro & cucumber; served w/ spicy roasted rice sauce]\nLooked and sounded much better than executed. It could just be because of the delivery but the steak was a little tough and overcooked. That aside though, I found the flavor to be lacking. It kind of tasted like the amateur Asian steak I'm capable of cooking at home. Not sure if it was supposed to be served with a different sauce, but the one that came with mine was some sort of cilantro sauce with a good kick to it, which definitely added some much needed flavor.\n\n-KAI YANG, SOM TUM ($16.10) - 3.5/5\n[half BBQ chicken marinated in turmeric & coconut milk; served w/ papaya salad, roasted rice sauce & black sweet sticky rice]\nOverall, a pretty tasty dish (and a very decent portion size), but I was more a fan of the som tum (papaya salad) than the kai yang (bbq chicken). The papaya salad had a good balance of salty/savory, acidic and spicy flavors. I would've liked it even spicier and I remember the papaya salads I had in Thailand being a little sweet as well, but definitely not lacking in flavor. The chicken (one large wing and thigh/drumstick) was tender and fragrant from the coconut milk, but very light in flavor. The rice was whatevers. It wasn't actually sweet and the outside layer got hard pretty quickly. I wish I could've substituted more papaya salad instead of rice. The rice sauce that came with it was incredibly salty. Definitely didn't need that", "author": "Jessie L."}

I could tell that the ingredients were fresh, but in terms of flavor, nothing popped and made me yearn for more.\n\nBEST DISH: Rice salad - gingery, coconut-y, mango-y, crunchy goodness!!\n\nJUST OK DISH: BBQ Chicken - Not bad. The chicken was tender, but not worth $18!! The plate that it came on was impressively big, but it was really just 2 pieces of BBQ chicken, a bowl of purple rice, and a tiny little papaya salad.\n\nTHE MEH I WOULD NOT ORDER AGAIN DISH: 24 Hour Beef Noodle Soup - We were wowed by the giant hunk of meat that came with the noodles. We were even more impressed when my boyfriend picked up the giant hunk of meat and the bone came right off. Thinking that we were in for a tender, melt-in-your-mouth beef experience, we felt cheated when the short rib turned out to be stringy, chewy, and on the tough side. When I eat Asian food, I expect my meat to be fatty, juicy, gelatinous, and soft...so this did not measure up to my standards. The broth was good but lacked punch. The egg noodles used were not the kind that picked up the flavors of the soup, and just tasted...well...eggy.\n\nI would give this place another shot though. I might come back to try some Thai staples, like pad thai and crab fried rice.", "author": "Catherine C."}

It kills me a little that I'm paying over $20 for soup that I may be able to find for a fraction of the price in an Asian restaurant, but so far I haven't found a place with such great tasting noodle soup. I also am not a big fan of fried chicken in general, but I am a big fan of Farmhouse Thai's! The skin on the chicken is light and crispy, not overly breaded. The curry that the chicken is served with is also really good. \n\nMy only gripe is that this place is not always consistent. Over the 4 or so times I've been here, I've received varying serving sizes of the chicken. On some days, they will give a lot of meat, but on other days, they will serve one smaller piece. \n\nFarmhouse is always crowded during dinner time, so I recommend making a reservation in advance. When going in big groups, even with a reservation, be prepared to wait 30-40 minutes before you are actually seated. I have also visited during lunch time on the weekend, and there was no wait.", "author": "Mina K."}

The food was portioned very heavy...yes it's pricier than a lot of places, but the portion is huge.  But I'm not a fan of just quantity without quality.  Each dish was stellar...I'd say the dishes had more of a hybrid Thai style by mixing some modern twists, and other Asian cuisine styles into their recipes.  Bud #1 got the braised beef and said it was ridic, bud #2 got the special curry noodle...whoa.

Since he dislikes going far from home, I remembered this new spot while walking the dogs one afternoon. The location is he artists neighborhood between Mission and Potrero. The area is quiet and the streets are cleaner than Mission and Valencia. It was Sunday so I did not think a reservation would be needed. Do not be fooled folks, this place is secretly popular. It was packed! Even still we waited less than 10 minutes for a table. Though seated we waited more than 10 minutes for a server to come to our table.\n\nOnce water was on our table our server came to take our order. I wanted to try the young coconut drink after reading the rave Yelp reviews. Unfortunately they were sold out. In its stead I went with the Thai iced tea and wow!! Just wow! It was perfection. It wasn't too sweet, nor to heavy with cream/milk. It was so refreshing I ordered two back to back!  \n\nFor our meal we ordered the Beef salad and Thai crispy rolls as appetizers. Followed by a\nvegetable Tom Yum and Kai Yang Som Tun BBQ chicken as the main course. Let me start by saying everything was so wonderfully delicious. So much so that when we were walking home I was hurting I was so stuffed! I just could stop eating everything. \n\nThe beef salad was exceptional! The beef was seared to a juicy tenderness which perfectly complimented the cucumber and scallions. The crispy rolls were just as delicious. Crispy, flaky pastry stuffed with silver noodles, cabbage, mushroom and cilantro. Their house made sweet chili sauce was again, not too sweet and definitely not like the heavy consistency you get with the commercial sauces.  No red/pink color dye here! I was torn with the Tom Yum. On the one hand the broth was spectacular and the vegetables were al dente. Bit the flavor of the broth was not your normal Tom Yum and it certainly wasn't as spicy as I was hoping. It was good, but I would not order it again if I was in the mood for a traditionalTom Yum. Buy the time our main course arrived we were practically ready to throw in the towel. But when a plate 1/2 the size of the table arrived with our chicken, sticky rice and papaya salad, our stomachs nearly jumped out of our eyes! Juicy, peppery meat that melts in your mouth, only to be refreshed by the accompanying tangy papaya salad. \n\nThe service was good, but it was not outstanding. I did not like hat we had to wait so long for someone to come to our table after being seated. Additionally, we ordered quite a bit of food. Everything came all at once; the salad the soup and the rolls. I was surprised that our server didn't consider the size of the 2 person table, which was very small.  It would have been better to receive one or two items at a time, so we could take our time to enjoy each course. I ended up having to tell him to wait on the chicken entr\u00e9e. \n\nOverall the meal was very good and it wasn't overpriced. All of the ingredients are organic and fresh. I hope on my next visit they will have the young coconut available.", "author": "Jaylena P."}

If you are a foodie and are hungry for an interesting take on Thai food: this is NAHT the place for you. We are more in the 2nd camp. We, a table of four, ordered two appetizers (meh, very standard samosas and spring roll variants), and then two different curries and two seafood dishes.

But this place had a lot of highs but also a a lot of lows when I came here for a group dinner for a group of 9. They do take reservations for large parties and we were able to get a dinner spot only a day in advance. They have a lot of large tables and on a Saturday night there wasn't ever really a line or wait from what I saw so good if you want to skip the crazy San Francisco dinner waiting.\n\nFirst off, the ambiance and decor here is lovely. Really open and beautiful space. I would imagine it to be a great place for a fancy or celebratory occasion! \n\nNow, the most important thing - the food. Some parts were amazing. Some were not my cup of tea. Here's what we ordered, sharing everything family-style:\n- Neua Num Tok Rolls: 4 pieces of wagyu beef that were so tender and juicy. Loved the toppings and spices it was paired with. I think this was everyone's favorite dish! It is very small however, with each piece just a bite of beef really.\n- Thai Street Green Curry Noodles: I thought the curry was good especially when you mix the vermicelli noodles in it comes it! I've never had noodles with curry before like this so it was really good. But, it came with so little noodles that there was still soooooo much curry after we finished the noodles. The curry was too heavy and oily to eat without some sort of rice or noodles so I wish they had balanced the curry/noodle ratio better\n\n- Chef specials (we ordered both offered that night): Presentation was beautiful, on this tall wooden stand, although impractical for a large group so they ended up taking that away haha.\n1. Beef with papaya salad and noodles with some sauce: While the beef here was really tender like the appetizer, that was the only part of the dish that was enjoyable. It came in several parts, the beef in a bowl with some vegetables, the papaya salad in another, and then the noodles. We did not enjoy the sauce and spices that came with the noodles and the papaya salad was SOOOOOO spicy without any tastiness to it. It was also not very enjoyable and no one wanted to finish it after the beef was gone. So we essentially got a dish for $25+ for just a few pieces of beef (although it was really good). Definitely felt a little bit unsatisfied with this one.\n2. Pork soup with noodles in a claypot: This also came in a few pieces and we added all the ingredients (noodles, toppings, etc.) into the claypot with the broth and mixed. This soup was absolutely delicious. It reminded me a lot of pho, as the broth was clear with rice noodles. This was probably our favorite entree! The only problem with splitting a dish 4-ways is each bowl was so small. We each probably got a small bowl with a few strands of noodle. Again, very little noodles came with the dish!\n\nI was absolutely shocked by the small portions, especially the small portions of noodles for each dish. We did split everything 4 ways but even so, if I ordered one of the chef specials to eat by myself, I would have been disappointed at the portion for the price (each chef special was in the upper $20s). Some in our group were slightly full, some not that full, but no one was stuffed by this meal. And while I don't doubt its authenticity, we were all really shocked by spice combination in the beef chef special. Besides the beef, the papaya salad and noodles just weren't very appetizing and we left most of that dish untouched.\n\nWe ended our meal with a Thai Vacation, coconut sticky rice, with coconut and coconut ice cream! This was served in a little coconut and a little umbrella which I thought was beautiful. Tasted great as well! Definitely recommend their desserts as there were so many I wanted to try!\n\nI think this place shines in its presentation and gorgeous ambiance. They also serve some really tender beef and they have very unique dishes that I have not seen at your typical Thai restaurant. However, I cannot understand the high price tags (appetizers were well over $10, entrees were $17-$25, and chef specials were upper 20s) for such small portions. And then there were some parts of our meal that were a little strange. Maybe we didn't order the correct things, although I assumed chef specials should be some of a restaurant's best dishes. Regardless, I am open to coming back and trying some other dishes! Have heard great things about their Hai Yai chicken and Panang Neua.", "author": "Jingxi Z."}

We ordered BBQ chicken along with papaya salad, it was amazing good, Thai sausage was great too but the noodles with simmered beef was average for my taste but it wasn't bad. \nIf you were in the city , come to check them out.

A block from my old office building. How I miss working in the Mission... :/ The plating alone intrigued me but the reviews were all superb so I was hooked on coming in Monday after work. \n\nOrdered the Hat Yai Fried Chicken. Comes with roti, potato yellow curry and blue rice. This could easily feed two people but I didn't eat lunch so I was able to devour every bite and soak up every bit of the sauce. Couldn't let it go to waste now. :p Every bite of this dish was full of flavor and spice. The fried chicken especially with the sweet dipping sauce and perfectly crisp skin.... Pure deliciousness. Most authentic Thai I have had in SF. \n\nThe staff was also super friendly. I also asked the waitress if there was any significance of the 99 faucets on the wall. She explained #9 is good luck within the culture. The faucets resemble the flow of water/rain hence more good luck is brought to you. \nHighly recommend and Look forward to trying more dishes.", "author": "Erica M."}

The Devore is great and the waitstaff all wear very fun Hawaiian shirt with traditional Thai pants. We were seated promptly as they had just opened for the day. I ordered a Thai tea which is always one of my favorites. It arrived with a large scoop of crushed ice which was great. The prices are a little steep with the average tab being $15-24. Condiments are a bit pricey I've never pd $4 for peanut sauce although they give you a nice portion. Before our meal we were served pickled veggies which were nice. My coworker ordered the Thai rice with seafood but instead received the a noddle dish. The waiter quickly corrected the order. I ordered the Hat Yai chicken which was a large chicken breast deep fried, yellow curry with potato, roti and blue jasmine rice. It was a large portion and very delicious.

Your service is impeccable, and people around here really care about service and customer experience. \n2. I LOVE the atmosphere of your restaurant.  It's so airy and breezy.  The Thai flower decor is insanely instagrammable, and we love to use Instagram here in Maryland. #FreeAdvertisingForYou\n3. That appetizer with the Waygu flank steak rolled around cucumber and mint in the green curry... well, I was trying to figure out what's been missing in my life for some time now... and it's that. \n4. Those spring rolls with the glass noodles.  I doubted ya there for a second. I was like... that's carbs stacked on carbs.  But you knew what you were doing.  You knew better than me. \n5. When I ordered the 24 hour beef braised soup, I didn't realize that for the next 24 hours I would be thinking about the soup. I'm assuming it's also it's cooking time. Clever... very clever *wink\n6. The spices that you put on the table were not kidding. They were not playing anyone. No chain of fools here. They were serious. Appreciated. \n7. Ok... I know it's weird, but I love how you serve almost everything on enamel. I love the blue and white enamel plates, I love the red and vanilla colored enamel plates.  I love enamel- sue me. \n8. Everything was so fresh and clean tasting.  I mean... no heavy oily dishes, the produce was super fresh. The kitchen was clean as a hospital operating room. \n9. And the quickness in which you got out 10+ entree dishes was just... impressive. \n10. I know  A LOT of Yelpers in this area, and I know that we would frequent your establishment. I mean, I'd essentially live there. \n\nAs concludes my petition to have you open up a second location in the Maryland Suburbs of Washington.\n\nBethesda, MD would be great, thank you.", "author": "Mike B."}

The restaurant has a nice balance between open and clean with rustic charm.  The nice bar side seating and view od the kitchen gives it a good \"modern\" spin. Parking nearby is also not terrible as they are actual parking not just curbside spots where you hope you fit and aren't sticking into someone's driveway. \n\nThe food is tasty as I mentioned before.  The appetizer that is basically a coconut shrimp lettuce wrap is really good and comes three to an order.  Although papaya salad is a standard dish, give the rice salad a try.  The short rib masaman curry is less curry and more of a curry rub fyi, not bad just slightly misleading by the description. \n\nAll in all I love this spot.

Their take on the yellow curry was a little different then what I've had before. I loved the Roti on top of the curry it was almost like a creamy curry pot pie. The Tom Kha was one of the best I've ever had with so many fresh veggies and mushrooms I'd definitely order it up again. They give you spices to add to your dishes but I do wish they let you order by heat.

I was directed here during their soft opening by a coworker who had a hot tip about Farmhouse's recent opening.\n\nWhile I'm sure this place would be a perfect dinner location, I'd actually suggest it for lunch. It's place on Florida is sunny, warm and welcoming. The first thing I got off the menu was the whole young coconut which was fresh and refreshing. It wasn't too sweet, but seemed to perfectly quench my thirst. I noticed they have quite the coffee bar as well, so if you are looking for a midday pick me up this is the place. \n\nWe ordered a few dishes, but by far and away the best standout is the Hat Yai. It's a friend chicken dish with a side of blue rice. Additionally, it comes with a wonderfully crispy roit and potato curry. I wasn't totally sure the process of eating the dish (was the curry for the chicken? Was the Roti supposed to be dipped in the curry? Why was the rice blue?) But I ended my meal quite full and content. \n\nWord on the street from some spice fiend friends is that you can really ask them to kick up the spice.

When I think Farmhouse, I think stuff like brunch with eggs and bacon, not Thai food.  But aside from the name, my dining experience here was pretty good!\n\nA modern atmosphere with a touch of Thai decorations to remind you you are here to eat Thai food, not brunch :).  They started us off with some sweet potato chips that were lightly salted.  Actually really good, and I don't prefer sweet potato chips.\n\nWe ordered the Herbal Salad, 24 hr Beef Noodle Soup, and Hay Yai Fried Chicken.  The Herbal Salad was good, but not really my thing.  It had a strong taste of Coconut rice, which is not a bad thing.  The textures within the salad were varied and come together well, the different flavors were okay together.  \n\nThe Beef noodle came out next, and wow, I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  The beef was so tender and came bone in!  It had a very distinct thai twist to normal beef noodle soup, with a hint of boat noodle broth that I really love.  The noodles themselves were normal egg noodles, but the star here is the soup and beer rib.  \n\nI wasn't sure what to expect from the Hay Yai Fried Chicken, but it was presented well.  The fried chicken was heavily battered but flavorful.  It's greasy enough that I don't know why people would think its dry, especially with the sweet and spicy glaze drizzled over it.  It came with pieces of Roti to dip in a curry that was really, really flavorful.  I wasn't sure if it was mean to be put on top of the chicken (with glaze sauce and all), but it was really good.  Came with blue coconut rice!  (I was pretty coconut riced out by this point).\n\nPortions were really good sized so we didn't finish what we ordered between two of us.

Our group ordered close to 10 different dishes, but my favorites were the Hat Yai Fried Chicken and Herbal Rice Salad. The fried chicken had the perfect amount of crunch while the meat was still nice and tender. It went perfectly well with the fried roti and curry sauce. The flavors in the dishes were not as bold or robust as some of my other favorite Thai restaurants; however, Farmhouse Kitchen excels in presentation.

I started vomit strongly around 12am and meanwhile started diarrhea. My colleague didn't vomit but kept diarrheal (not stopped even when I am writing this review). Both of us had fever, ranging between 100.8 to 101.3 degree. By far, my colleague still has fever. \n\nThis is our first time came to this restaurant. We didn't eat other food before came to dinner and didn't eat anything else after dinner. From the items and smells vomited, you can tell it is all the food from this restaurant. \n\nWhat we ordered: street style green curry noodle and Tom Yum Soup Noodle. \n\nWe called the restaurant and talked to the manager. Nothing is solved. Anyway, whoever is considering to come eat here should be very careful. Hope you don't get the same experience as us. Food poisoning is painful....", "author": "Elaine L."}

I went to Farmhouse as a party of 2 and we were immediately seated in the bar area even during the dinner peak rush (it also helps to call in). The waitress was helpful in explaining the menu and explained what the most popular dishes were.\n\nWe ended up ordering the Fried Chicken and the Beef noodle soup. The fried chicken turned out to be too dry to eat by itself and the small side \"salad\" turned out to be too spicy to enjoy, I typically enjoy spicy food but there was too much pepper to enjoy the salad properly. The noodles turned out to be a good choice, the meat melted off the bone as we were picking it apart. Eventually due to the spice, we ordered the thai iced tea which was by far the best Thai iced tea I ever had before. However, it was a shame that it costs $5 for each tea and it was half ice.\n\nI would recommend getting the soup and a thai iced tea.", "author": "Michael T."}

I was expecting to have crab in the fried rice. NOPE. The ONLY crab I saw was the few pieces (3 small pieces) that was used as garnish on top of the fried rice. The fried rice also came with a crab seasoned soup and two sides of dipping sauces. I was not happy with paying $20 for rice and eggs.\n\nThe Thai sausage we ordered was very good, but with a price tag of $8 for just one sausage (about 6 pieces), the '$' signs quickly washed away the flavorful taste.\n\nMy final dish was the Herb Salad. I've never had anything like it before and I have to say, it was great !! Perfect combination of herbs, spices, peanuts and rice in one dish. It truly leaves you feeling refreshed and satisfied. \n\nGo for the Herb Salad, skip the crab fried rice, but if you like paying $20 for a bowl of rice and scrambled eggs, then be their guest.", "author": "Co C."}

I *want* to like it--it's like that guy you're dating who is great and sweet but you just don't really feel any chemistry with. I love the way Farmhouse Thai looks--as someone else described, it's a hipster Thai restaurant, and there really aren't many of those. The interior is quirky and gorgeous, and the service is great. The food itself comes in huge portions and is beautifully presented. But I've come here twice, once for a group dinner and once for lunch, and I didn't really enjoy either meal (I got the Tom Yum Soup the second time, forgot what I ordered the first). The flavors are almost a little too intense, and the food's just too heavy for me.

The place is averaged size, with a mix of rustic/ somewhat traditional Thai decor.  I really liked the rustic lights in the dining area and bar. \nWe had a huge party (10 people) and made reservation ahead of time.  We did family style and ordered about 6 main entrees, 5 appetizers and 2 desserts. \nFor appetizers we ordered the calamari, wagyu beef , chicken wings, papaya salad and herb rice salad.  The chicken wings only came with 4 pcs but it was tasty.  So are the wagyu beef and calamari.  The papaya salad was spicy, we asked the server if it can be less spicy but she said the papaya salad has been pre-made so it's already at medium spicy (this is thai chili we're talking about so their medium spicy= it's spicy!). The herb salad was good too with blue rice. Very tasty. \nFor main course we ordered two of the slow cooked braised ribs, the fried chicken, pad see eew, pad thai, beef noodle soup and tom zappp.  The fried chicken was juicy and came with blue rice, roti and curry sauce for dipping.  Mix the blue rice in with the curry sauce and you'll be satisfied.  The pad see eew and pad Thai were also tasty.  The 24 hour beef is a must try, the meat is so tender and the panang sauce is soooo good.  I wasn't a fan of the tom zappp.  I just didn't like the flavor.  The beef noodle though was awesome! \nFor dessert we ordered the platter which came with taro/black sticky rice, pudding, coconut ice cream, watermelon, macaroon and other fresh fruits. It was delish!  We also ordered the yim yim... which consist of coconut ice cream with coconut milk and toasted coconut flakes.  I didn't get to taste this but was told it was awesome... \nI forgot to mention we also ordered Thai iced tea, Thai coffee and coconut latte...", "author": "Bash B."}

I tried a lot of dishes - fried chicken, Panang Neua (braised short rib), mango sticky rice, bbq chicken, tom yum soup, and beef noodle soup, and thai fried rice with pork belly.\n\nThe standout dishes were the braised short rib and the bbq chicken. The short rib was so tender and the meat was falling off the bone. A lot of their dishes come with this interesting blue rice which is pretty delicious. All of their dishes look too pretty to eat. You almost feel bad ruining the dish just to eat it...\n\nI liked that they offered thai fried rice with the option of add ons - add the pork belly, you won't regret it!\n\nOverall, it's a pretty solid thai fusion place.

I loved the crunchy texture and herbs in the rice. It was really flavorful, savory and coconut-y all at the same time. The portion was pretty big, and large enough to split between 2 people. Really enjoyed it, and would come back just for this dish.\n\n* Panang Neua - The short rib was really well flavored, spicy and tender. It had a bit of a chew to it, but I still liked it. Good portions for sharing.\n\n* Pad see you - My usual go-to Thai dish. I was a little disappointed in this one, since the other two were so good. The chicken was dry and the noodles were a little mushy, but still tasty.\n\nService was really great, and our waters were always quickly refilled.

This is not your mom's Thai joint.\n\nThe decor in this place is remarkable. There's a strange disconnect between the farmhouse/country style decor and the Thai cuisine, but somehow it works. Also, going in the bathroom, you'd never guess there was a housing crisis in SF - it's absolutely massive, and there are inexplicably two sinks even though it's a private bathroom.\n\nMy friend and I had a heck of a feast when we went. We ordered the samosas, fried chicken, crispy pork fried rice, Thai iced coffees, and the molten chocolate cake for dessert. Everything was superb, but as many other reviewers have pointed out, the Hat Yai fried chicken is to die for, and the iced coffee is the best I've ever had (like a superior version of the Mint Mojito at Philz).\n\nOverall, this was the best Thai restaurant I've been to and I can't wait to go back.

Its not on any major corners like Flour and Water or Salumeria. It's a little hidden but its definitely near some other really delicious places. \n\nThere is not another Thai place close enough around this area. I can't say I know a lot about authentic Thai food although I have had thai food all my life being my mother's favorite. My friends though are and they were quite impressed. \n\nService: Their service is really good. Everyone is really nice and you can tell they are really trying to do their best. I cannot say that about almost all of the other restaurants around being that this is a very \"hipster\" area. \n\nAtmosphere: I really like the decor. It's defintely hipster in its design so I was a little nervous that the food wasn't going to be very authentic but despite the hip design of the space it was! Glad that authentic asian food can also be met with nice design without overcharging as well. \n\nFood: I had the 24 hour beef soup. That is a lot of food. It comes out with a giant shank of beef. I really apologize for not taking a picture. If you love beef like I do then you should really try it! I also had the tom yum noodle soup which had a lot of flavor. I found it slightly oily though. Their thai tea was a little too sweet for me, I just asked them to add more tea and they did without question. \n\nI really hope word spreads about this place!", "author": "Carmen L."}

Their restaurant needs sound insulation, sound panels on the ceilings, walls, that absorb the noise in that echo chamber of a restaurant. This is not the only one in the Mission, but having to yell at the person in front of you ruins the appetite. \n\nWaiters also need to be a bit louder because of this but they are polite and silent, which makes it even more difficult to talk to them.\n\nI'm tempted to give it a 3 because this is something that is severely lacking in most hip restaurants in this area, but it's not always like this, so it gets a 4.

We were seated immediately which was good. Their Thai food is honestly mediacore for the price they charge. Beware, the portions are pretty small as well. We got the curry, pad Thai chicken, Papaya salad, and chicken fried rice. Chicken fried rice was flavorless. We had to use ALOT of the powdered red chili to have some flavor. I've had way better Thai food in hole-in-a wall places where it's inexpensive. So as far as food goes, it's MEH. Nothing special and nothing to rave about.\n\nAt one point, my friend tried to ask for help and she said \"excuse me\" to our waiter politely I may add. And he legitly held up his hand rudely in her face without saying anything and walked away. WHAT THE HECK. I've never seen anyone do that before..Maybe the polite thing to say was \"I'll be right with you\". But he didn't do that. We also still had food on our plate we were finishing up. They continuously asked 2-3 times to take our plates away when we were still eating...Maybe instead say \"is there anything else I can help you with?\" NOT \"are you guys done, can I take this plate?\"..when there's still food on our plate! After they took our plates away, we were still sitting finishing off our beers, and the waiter came to clean the table with our napkin right in front of us while we were still at the table.

I have a pretty good tolerance but this was really, really spicy. I can't imagine your average person could eat this.  The flavors were delicious but I couldn't find the chillies or maybe there were seeds in there I couldn't see so there was no avoiding the spicy. It's the kind of burn you feel in your stomach even. \n\nTom Yum Noodle soup - ridiculously salty. Inedible! I doubled the liquid quantity with hot water and it finally became barely acceptable. It was inedible and my husband agreed. \n\nChicken noodle soup - really good \n\nPad Thai - dry and no flavor\n\nGreen curry chicken - wonderful and the blue rice was a fun surprise\n\nI'm hoping I hit it on an off night or maybe it was so late they gave me the end of the tom yum soup and all the spices had settled in it.

Includes their staple blue jasmine rice, mixed with a myriad of ingredients such as peanuts and green mango. Think something like the Tea Leaf Salad at Burma Superstar.\n\nFried Chicken ($18): Came with a side of curry, roti bread, and blue rice. The chicken was perfectly fried and juicy! I loved the presentation, with a knife stabbed through the roti bread on the chicken.\n\nPanang Neua (Braised Short Rib) ($22): Very tender and flavorful, a little spicy. This dish is a bit heavier on the spices, and includes a mix of brocolini and veggies topped with their red curry sauce and blue rice. \n\nWe loved all our dishes and would come back to try other dishes.

We called ahead and the wait for a table was still over an hour for a table for 2. We decided to sit at the tiny bar until a table came available. Finally decided to eat at the bar because we got tired of waiting. And tired of being ignored by wait staff. Eating was a mess of getting jostled and bumped into. The place was cramped. What happened next was half my fault, but the waiter left my credit card at the register when he handed back my receipt. I didn't realize that he didn't give my credit card back until I was in the airport 12 hours later. \n\nCalled the restaurant. They did have my card but would not discuss it.

For entrees, we got the 24 hours beef noodle soup and the hat yai chicken. While the beef noodle soup was really tasty, I'm not really sure if it's worth the price tag. The hat yai chicken was probably my favorite item. The chicken was perfectly crispy and the curry on the side was so good! Pro tip: save room for dessert!! The Thai Vacation, which is a sticky rice with vanilla ice cream and strips of fresh coconut inside of a fresh coconut was absolutely delicious. I had to use all of my willpower to not order another one!", "author": "Jennifer C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-30", "description": "This is definitely an \"in\" restaurant in the Mission.  Full house on a Saturday night.  Overall the food and decor are nicer than typical Thai restaurants and the menu is more creative.  They have servers walking around with (presumably) street food offerings of fried crickets and chicken feet. We passed on those.  Didn't care for the beef jerky appetizer, but overall food was good and nicely presented.  My main complaint is this: we felt rushed from the minute we were seated.  Server came immediately and pushed us to order drinks and appetizers before we had a chance to look over the menu, then returned quickly for the rest of our order.  The bus person kept trying to take our plates away even though we were not completely finished.  We were there for just over an hour but felt like we overstayed our welcome by at least 15 minutes. They were trying to turn over tables too fast, especially for a nicer establishment.  This made the experience less pleasant than it should have been.  Might return, but wouldn't give them top marks for service.", "author": "Debbie W."}

The restaurant has an open setting and is very welcoming, had nice decor and is a fun place to eat. Staff was nice and we got great service. But since this is a restaurant and my main purpose there was to eat, if the food isn't memorable then, well the experience isn't memorable either. It's over priced for Thai but that's even okay if the food is tasty. But it wasn't. It wasn't bad either, just mediocre and unmemorable, like solid three stars. I got the Pad Ki Mao and the serving size was like a snack size. I looked over to the table next to us and their plates had larger portions so maybe I have portion envy. Who knows? But can you blame me when I left with both my tummy and wallet on empty? I may give this place another shot but since there are just too many other restaurants out there, I can't imagine being back very soon.

Our party of five were all present and they just happened to have an opened table. The atmosphere was fin and exciting, and ambience was very colorful. Thai rock-a-billie \"Luk Thung\" country music gave the entire place an awesome party vibe. Waiters were all very friendly and attentive. Some male servers were dressed in traditional dancer attire and were very pretty.  Attention to detail definitely gives this place a very attractive aura and warmth. Water was served a couple of minutes after we sat down and drinks were ordered right then.  The food was as authenic as the village Thai food in Thailand. The Laos Style Papaya Salad with Salted Blue Mud Crab brought us back to the street vendors in the heartland of Thailand...freshest ingredients and the right amount of fish sauce, chili, palm sugar, and other ingredients. We ordered extra sticky rice to polish off all that good sauce mixture and delicious shredded green papaya. We also had the \"Sai Ort\" sausage....perfectly smoked flavor and roasted. The Green Curry, Marinaded Grilled Chicken, and Beef Rib soup were excellent.  The entire meal's presentation was very traditional as everything was served on old school decorative trays.  The \"Wow!\" factor is definitely found in the fresh ingredients and unique herbs used in each dish...a la cuisine.  We followed the meal with their Dessert Platter that included Monkey Bread, Coconut Ice Cream with real Coconut Meat, Fresh Watermelon, Strawberries & Cream, Lava \"Fudge\" Cake, Pineapple Ice Cream, French Vanilla Macaroon, and Light Whipped Cream galore.

The chicken it came with was extremely dry. As dry as chicken can get... paired with sticky rice and a side of what I think was vinegar? Dry, flavorless chicken with dry rice. Not good. Maybe the papaya salad will save the dish? Not really. It didn't taste fresh at all. Like the papaya had been sitting in its dressing for days. Overall just not worth the price.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-12", "description": "So this review is going to be about my 2 separate visits that took place less than 12 hours apart :P\n\nI've had this restaurant bookmarked for a while now. First of all, I LOVE Thai food. Secondly, this is a sister restaurant of Kitchen Story. Beside it's location being a wee bit out of the way, I didn't see any reason why I should not pay it a visit. Last night, I finally came here with the BFF for a weekend dinner, AND today again with my mum for lunch. (Mum got a bit jelly and curious when she saw my food posts on a different social media handle. Curse Internet!!)\n\nIt's an interesting location for a restaurant. Then again there are a few other cafes in the neighborhood. Gentrification at its best. Parking seems packed both times I was there yet I got lucky and someone pulled out of their places both times. Super cute and trendy decor filled with hippie ambience. Can be a bit loud with the music though.\n\nThe service was great both times. During my first visit, we were greeted promptly and led to the bar area since we didn't make reservation and the place was pretty crowded already. During my second visit today, we were seated at a table as the place was pretty empty. I supposed that people would opt for a brunch place with bottomless mimosa instead of Thai food on this gorgeous Sunday. \n\nNow on to the food. Portions are decent and presentation is beautifully Instagram-worthy (when you see two big guys sitting at the next table taking picture of their food, you'd know what's up.) During my first visit, the BFF and I tried some of the dishes the lot raved so much about:\n*Hat Yai Chicken: The fried chicken breast was crunchy with decent flavor. The curry was flavorful but a bit on the sweet side. The roti, unfortunately, was hard and difficult to chew. We had to put each piece into the curry sauce to \"rehydrate\" them and it would still be difficult to eat. \n*24 Hours Beef Noodle Soup: The beef was fall-off-the-bone tender and very flavorful. Regrettably, the broth was awfully salty.\n*Ahi Scoops: Warning: super spicy chili sauce sitting right on top of the piece of tuna. I literally sat there for a good minute or two before I regain a little sense of my taste buds. I could barely taste any other flavor from the rest of the dish. Just be sure to have your water ready for it.\nThe second time around, my mum and I decided to try something different:\n*Daily special red curry with (something) prawns in half pineapple: We wanted to try a curry dish and the waitress was recommending it so we thought why not. It wasn't very impressive. Again, the curry was not spicy at all and rather sweet. The two giant prawns were somewhat undercooked and difficult to eat. Love the coconut rice though.\n*Pad Thai with Tofu: Decent and solid classic Thai street dish. Yum.\nWe also tried their *Mango Sticky Rice for dessert. They seemed to have combined black sticky rice with regular sticky rice so the consistency was pretty interesting in a good way. Love the fragrant sesame seeds as well.\n\nTheir drinks are pretty interesting too. Besides just the usual Thai Iced Tea that could be found in regular Thai restaurant, they have variety beers, wine, hot drinks and tea as well. Collectively during both visits, we have tried their *Honey Milk Lavender, *Ginger Milk Tea, *Coconut Cream Latte, and *Rogue Hazelnut Brown beer. They were all wonderful. \n\nPeople might find the price a little higher than other Thai restaurants but I am willing to pay for the wonderful meal, service, and ambience. It's probably good for date night too :P Overall, I enjoy both meals I got there. The one star was taken off because of the overly salty broth and sweet sweet curry. But I will probably go back sometime to try different dishes to see if they might earn that star back.", "author": "Pearl T."}

My friend who is part Thai recommended it and it was honestly one of the best Thai meals I've ever had. It kind of reminded me of Burmese food too....We had the short rib, green curry with eggplant and tofu, pad Thai, fish cakes, tiger prawn appetizer, steak and their street food special. Everything had great flavor. A little sweet and a little spicy, which was a perfect combo! The green curry was a little watery and not thick like I'm used to, but the flavor was still excellent. I'd definitely come back!!!\n\nOur reservation was at 7pm and they sat us right at 7, which was great. They did rush us with our meal a little, clearing plates before we were done but I think they were just trying to turn the table since they had a wait.

Even with the camera crew, the restaurant was running very smoothly, and service was impeccable. The chef/owner even came to our table to explain the taping and see how we were doing. Food-wise, this is some of the best Thai food I've had - full of flavor and SPICE!! Definitely felt the heat, but not so much that I didn't enjoy the meal like some other places I've been too. We ordered the mango salad, penang curry with tofu, and crab fried rice, which were all delicious. We were also offered some complementary \"street food\" appetizers.\n\nThe ambience for dinner was dim but relatively lively and colorful, so good for a fun date or outing with a group of friends.

The reason why I hesitate to give this restaurant a higher review, despite the delicious grub, is due to three reasons- two of which are the result of restaurant stingy-ness. \n\n1- First, upon asking if we could have a bit more of the sauce that came with our appetizer spring rolls, we were informed that they don't give out anything for free. This was a big turn-off especially because this restaurant is above-average priced comparatively speaking to other Thai restaurants. Their higher prices should well encompass offering a small amount of extra sauce. We then asked them for soy sauce instead. 5 minutes later the waitress came out with the tiniest drop of soy sauce in the smallest bowl. Obviously they had a huge issue with providing anything extra at no-cost, even for small items which normally come at no-cost with a meal at a restaurant.\n I see this as equivalent to a burger joint charging you extra for ketchup or mustard. A bit ridiculous in our opinion.\n\n2- Second, they don't do anything gratuitous for birthdays. Only if you order a dessert do they come sing you happy birthday which is quite lovely but if and only if you order on your own. Both occasions I ate here was for birthdays and we were too filled from dinner to order dessert so we missed out on the experience. \n\nThird, the restaurant design is quite a lovely open space but because they are packed in the evenings- you have 10-20 people standing at the entrance literally peering over all of the diners seated towards the entrance of the restaurant. This makes for a stressful environment for the entrance-seat diners and as a result you feel obliged to eat faster and enjoy your dinner less. Their space is such that it could easily be fixed with some sort of separator to divide diners from tens of people anxiously waiting to be seated.", "author": "Talya R."}

We arrived around 8:45pm and we were offered to sit at the bar since a table was going to take about 15 mins. The bar was small but no biggie, the place was busy, our server was a bit too serious and we felt a bit rushed. While looking at the menu we were asked 3 times if we were ready and i swear we just got there. The food is way over priced. I ordered chicken yellow curry, it was nice that it came with Roti. It was good but the food was not hot, it came out cold to warm. The hubby ordered the chicken wings and crispy calamari. The portion size is a bit small for what you are paying for. I find that you can get more bang for your bucks else where. The cocktails are not so great, ordered the coco lada, it was mostly just a cup of ice to me.

The atmosphere is great but the food was no where near the 4-star rating that people gave on yelp. I ordered three dishes: Vegan Fresh spring roll (more Vietnamese than Thai), Mieng Kum Kung (Shrimp), and Papaya Salad with Salted Crab. Everything was so salty, especially the papaya salad. The flavor is not authentically Thai. Plus, they served the dishes on possibly the cheapest Thai metal plates available in Thailand. I told the waiter that the papaya salad was super salty. He said it's probably because of the salty crab. If the chef knew salty crab is already very salty, he should have adjusted the salad accordingly.  They didn't bother to fix it, so that's a knock of their service. Plus the Mieng Kum zesty mixture is also very salty. They served a fried shrimp on it, but the shrimp had no flavor and was way to big to eat with the Mieng Kum the traditional Thai way.  Lastly, I also ordered sticky rice so that I can eat it with the papaya salad the traditional Thai way, but the sticky rice is dry and hard.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-21", "description": "After searching Yelp for a place to celebrate a couple birthdays, I settled upon this place. It got great reviews, the menu had a mix of Thai classics and some new entrees, and the interior looked pretty quirky. Here's a rundown:\n\nService: From the beginning, we had excellent service. We were running late and had to push our 6:15pm reservation back to 6:30pm -- no problem. Once we arrived (about 5 minutes earlier than our 6:30pm reservation), we were seated immediately. Our waitress was so friendly, attentive, knowledgaeble, and enthusiastic, but not in an annoying way. Our water glasses were never empty and we had several other employees waiting on us, changing out our plates for clean ones, serving our drinks and food, and replacing dropped silverware.\n\nFood: The menu is quite extensive, and like I said, they have Thai classics like Paid Thai and new items like their version of fried chicken! We ordered the Vegan Fresh Rolls, Fried Calamari, and an interesting take on jerky. The fresh rolls were pretty good, but the peanut sauce made it really good. They were well constructed, so they stayed together even when cut in half and the sauce was thick enough to stay on the roll, but not overpowering. The calamari was interesting. Probably my least favorite, but not bad. The batter was unlike any other I typically have on calamari, and reminded me more of the kind you get on fish 'n chips. The jerky was pretty tasty and definitely reminded me of jerky. For entrees, we ordered the Hat Yai Fried Chicken, Pad Char Shrimps, and Pad Thai. The Hat Yai Fried Chicken was a hit. I wasn't a huge fan of it, because again, the breading reminded me of fish 'n chips, but everyone else like it. To be honest, the chicken was amazing, and melted your mouth, but it was too greasy for me. It also came with roti, yellow curry, and blue rice, which was tasty. The shrimp dish was just okay - nothing spectacular. The pad thai was really good. Something about it... I couldn't put my finger on it, but it was delicious and the first dish to disappear. There was also a chicken special going on and they offered single serving portions for $7 from a guy wearing one of those sticks across his shoulders to carry things on either side (what's that called?!). Anyways, it was an eye-catching display and got our attention. The chicken was just ok, but you could tell it was authentic.\n\nDrinks: They have an extensive drink menu and you can get whole fresh young coconuts! I'm typically not a huge coconut milk person, but it was so good! Between that and all the food, I was stuffed when I walked out.\n\nPrice: This is definitely thai food done with quality ingredients (they use Mary's chicken for their chicken dishes!), so expect to pay more, but with four drinks, three appetizers, and five entrees (we asked for two orders of the fried chicken), the total was a little less than $150.\n\nWould I return? Probably. This is a fun find and the food is good. Also, parking isn't too much of an issue.. You just have to look.", "author": "Leana L."}

As others have said, the interior is beautiful. It's spacious, with tons of seating without being too close, and there are lots of cute touches - plants, decorations, candles, etc. \n\nService: Took us a while to flag down our waiter after we asked for a few more minutes to decide, but after that, the service was impeccable. My water was refilled every single time it was down below half the glass - so fast and so attentive! I was pleasantly surprised. The food also came out pretty quickly once the order was in. \n\nFood: \n1. Green curry - was really excited for this dish, but it was just alright. The fresh vegetables were great (green beans, eggplant) but the curry itself was extremely oily and heavy. I wish it was a little lighter because my friend and I both couldn't have more than one serving. \n2. Pad kee mao - delicious! Noodles were cooked perfectly, good balance of noodles and veggies, and also had a little spicy kick. Loved it. \n3. Basil Fried Rice - Decent. Not the best I've had. Again, a little too oily and not as flavorful as I'm used to, since I had to keep adding spices. Again, the fresh veggies were good.\n4. Cool BLUE rice - never seen this before. It tasted just like white rice, but it was pretty cool to be served blue rice. \n\nPricing: A little above average (each dish, which we ordered with tofu, was about $14) with average serving sizes. \n\nVerdict: Food was a solid 3.5 stars, but rounding up for ambiance and good service.", "author": "Anu P."}

First of all that beef noodle soup- just wow! Super flavorful and just fall off the bone meat! The noodles were good. They were a bit stuck together but I'm guessing it's because the broth was warm and not piping hot(delivered in a plastic container) Still, very, very, very good! It has definitely convinced me to come into the restaurant and try other dishes! The house soda though, didn't do it for me. It seems to be one of those items that you either like not don't like and it didn't hit the right notes for me. Other than that, I'm definitely willing to try other items.

It's so pretty, modern and unexpected, given its location, that it feels like you've just stumbled accross a secret, cool spot that not many people know about (even though the restaurant will probably be full because it actually seems to be trending).\n\nI also loved the staff, which are cordial, joyful and know a lot about the food they offer. That being said, I gotta tell you I did not love the food itself. And since my friends, who know much more than me about original Thai food, said it is pretty much the real deal, I feel like I have been given fake Thai for a long time. Or maybe my expectations were just too high. All I know is I did not fall in love for my shrimp pad thai, wich I felt was too sweet and a tad boring, or any of the entrances I tasted, like the one that had tiny fried mushrooms stuck together (sorry but I didn't quite memorize the name).\n\nI do have to make one very special mention for their dessert though: we had the pudding with ice cream and it was so incredbly good!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-10-16", "description": "This was my first time eating at Farmhouse Kitchen and I was really excited. I saw a lot of positive comments & food photos on Yelp so I chose this place for my wife's bday. I also invited a few friends to join us to surprise her. When we got there the place was packed and lively.....maybe just a little too loud but I was ok with it. Our reservations were at 7pm and it did take some time to get seated, 7:35/7:40, so be prepared to wait a little during peak time. When we finally got seated and ordered appetizers/dinner I was very pleased with the service. We ordered the samosas, ahi tuna & grilled beef appetizers. The appetizer servings are very small for the price, since we were a party of 6 I had to double or  add a 1/2 order to each appetizer, for example 1 x samosa order only included 3 pieces for $9. The samosas were very small, with little filling but the presentation was very nice, the ahi tuna was good but it was very spicy. I was ok with it but others in my party thought it was too spicy. Now the beef roll appetizer was perfect and I would order that as a meal. After appetizers our Tom Kha soup arrived. I was a little disappointed, too much coconut and not enough lemongrass, a big miss for such a basic Thai dish. Then the main dishes arrived. 3 of us ordered the most popular dish Hat Yai fried chicken. Presentation was nice and the dish was pleasantly good, I give this dish a 3.9 Star. The chicken was cooked well but I think the surrounding food such as the roti (a little oily) and curry fell short (not enough curry flavor/bland). My brother-in-law ordered the short ribs and it looked good! I almost wish I had ordered it myself until he commented. It was too spicy and it was burning his mouth. I could tell though the dish was cooked perfectly as the meat was easily pulled off from the bone. And the final order was the bbq chicken. Again, great presentation but I heard that the chicken was a little dry and the side salad was way too spicy.\n\nSo, my final thoughts are if you're looking for a cool, hip & trendy restaurant then this is the place. If your palate can't handle the spice let your server know and maybe they can adjust the spice. \n\nFor me I'm 50/50.....I'd probably go again but for lunch. My rating for the food only is 3.85 stars....just missing that 4 by a little and can easily become a 5. The Service though is a solid 4.5 stars.\n\nI hope this helps....enjoy if you go!", "author": "Dennis M."}

They use only the freshest of ingredients, and their food isn't the typical Thai cuisine you'll find in SF. Their Tom Yum soup wasn't the usual red, oily concoction I'm used to seeing. Instead, it used a deep chicken broth for its base, with a mix of spices that made the soup taste like it'd been cooked in a Thai home, not restaurant. I had the Hainese chicken/rice dish for my entree. It was deliciously cooked and went very well with the homemade spices on the table, made by the server's grandma! And we ended our meal with a delicious dessert called Fhuk Thong of squash, custard, and ice cream with fresh coconut. The dessert was a real standout and a great departure from the typical desserts in SF.\n\nAside from the food, the restaurant itself is super cutely decorated, with a clean, modern aesthetic. And the staff and servers could not be any friendlier. I'm really impressed by this new spot, just a couple of weeks in, and I will definitely be going back for more food!", "author": "Joyce S."}

No hyperbole intended: it is _the_ best. The food is delicious. Every single dish is genuinely inventive. The portions are massive. The price is just right. If you've got friends from out of town and want to show them the Culinary Delights of the City without showing them the Insane Price of the City, Farmhouse is unequivocally the place. If you're alone and want to chow down at a bar, Farmhouse has you covered. And if you want to grab the best takeout of your life at 9:30pm on a Tuesday, Farmhouse is there for you too. Within 20 minutes you'll be on the couch, in your underwear, stuffing your face with kobe rolls and a soup with a comically large bone-in rib, and you'll feel like a goddamn king.\n\nI cannot praise this place enough: there does not exist a bad item on the menu. And trust me, as a local who eats here 2-4 times a week, I've exhaustively searched. This is not the sort of joint where you want to order a pound of Pad Kee Mow or Red Duck Curry: aim for the specials and treat yourself to brand new flavors. Personal highlights:\n- Panang Neua. Bone-in rib cooked in delicious panang curry, with blue rice and broccolini. I suspect this is their most popular dish, and with good reason: it's phenomenal\n- Crab Fried Rice. Everything about this dish is amazing, but the sauce is what really makes it stand out.\n- 24 Hour Beef Soup. Zesty, decadent, perfect levels of spice, complete with that signature rib. My go-to comfort meal.\n- Mok Salmon. Juicy, perfectly cooked salmon, wrapped in a banana leaf. Sauces are out of this world.\n- Fried Chicken. How do they keep perfectly cooking things? Unbelievably juicy, perfect levels of spice, yellow curry dipping sauce.\n\nI could go on. The Neua Steak is fantastic. The Pad Thai is great. My girlfriend claims that if she had to eat one meal for the rest of her life, it would be Farmhouse's Tom Yum Noodle Soup.

It was ok until they seated us at the only table adjacent to the bar, in the corner. Bad start. \n\nEverything sounded yummy so we took our time ordering, getting waters first. \n\nA server came by and took our appetizer and drink orders. \n\nSamosa- $9 \nThis came with 3 pieces and a bowl of curry for dipping. The size was smaller than my palm and I'm a petite person. The curry lacked flavor so it seemed a bit useless.\n\nNum Tok Rolls- $13\nThis came with 4 small rolls of flank steak. Decent portions with a good flavor. I understand the pricing on this one because of the meat quality.\n\nWe kept looking around for a server to take our order for the entrees but we couldn't get their attention. By this point, three more tables had been seated. We weren't able to order our entrees until they brought us our appetizers. \n\nRed curry w/ chicken- $13\nThis was pretty basic. Hard to screw up. \n\nHat Yai Fried Chicken- $18\nI was really excited to try this after reading the reviews. The presentation was beautiful, with the blue rice, chicken nicely stacked with roti on top, and colorful potato curry. The chicken was nice and crunchy. Two stars for this.\n\nNot sure if this is a cultural thing, but each server came up to us to ask if we were ok... But they only looked/talked to my boyfriend... ALL 3 boys and one girl. I get he's good-looking, but I felt really disrespected especially since they asked him if he wanted a second beer and didn't bother to look and ask me... And I actually wanted one. VERY RUDE. To top it off, once they saw my boyfriends plate was empty they asked him twice if he wanted MY food boxed up, even though I was still eating...\n\n2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 beers= $74\n\nThis place is overpriced for whatever Thai food. Definitely geared for all the money in the area. This place needs better customer service.", "author": "Lilimae S."}

Service, cuisine, drink menu, and lovely interior design. I loved their concept and idea for a restaurant, because to me farmhouse, chicken and waffles, right? But i'm just a foreign Texas girl in the big San Fransisco city, so what do I know?!\n\nI am a sucker for this farmhouse decor trend, so my heart was won over by the long wooden family style table we were sat at, along with the rest of the interior decor. Mason jars, big glass containers of flowers, and a super homey feel through out the entire place.  The drink menu was extensive, with beers and cocktails, and even some mocktails, which I am sure my former pregnant self would have appreciated back in the day. I stuck with an IPA which perfectly complimented my dish of Crab Fried Rice. My portion was a huge and served with a soup side dish. We had some heavenly appetizers chosen by our host for the evening and the Papaya Salad was incredible! But warning- the spice level is UP there. It left even our pro Thai eaters sweating a few bullets that night! Our server for the evening made sure our water glasses were constantly filled (perhaps it was the sight of us fanning ourselves!), and took wonderful care of all ten of us for the entire evening; everyone's order was perfectly executed and dishes were cleared promptly.", "author": "Casey S."}

My friends got the special dishes (northern something- It looked like pho noodles), the pad kee mao and ribs- but they all said it was too spicy for them.

Well, the search is OVER! Our meal at Farmhouse was like finding the promise land!  The entire experience was that of discovering the unexpected, and we LOVED it!  The decor inside is more what you would expect of the latest and greatest new american \"gastro pub\"; not what you would typically expect from a thai restaurant.  Such a wonderful surprise!  On to the main show stopper... the FOOD! \n\nI love Thai food, always have, always will.  I find it rare that a thai restaurant throws a curve ball at me and serves me up something I've never had.  That was exactly what happened with the unbelievably good food at Farmhouse!  We got the wagyu beef wrapped around mint & cucumber to start, panang curry with chicken, and the pad kee mao.  I'll start with the appetizer: absolutely amazing!  I've never had anything like this, and that automatically excites me. GET THIS APPETIZER!  The pad kee mao had some really fabulous flavors that I've rarely had in a thai noodle dish.  Somewhat reminiscent of masaman curry flavors, but even more intricate and some extra spicy kick!  The curry was also great, although it was our least favorite of our amazing meal.  Plus, there's blue rice... that's right, rice, that's BLUE!  That makes the trip worth it all by itself!", "author": "Kendall S."}

I came here with a group of three and we explored the menu like nobody else could. We ordered the Khan-toke set, street fair shrimp fritters, papaya salad, 24 hour beef noodle soup, and the Hat yai chicken. I have to say my favorite was the hat yai chicken! The curry was so flavorful and the bread that they served was flaky and not too oily. The chicken on the dish was also very moist but I had to keep dipping my bread in the curry. The street fair shrimp fritters was something new and interesting that I haven't ever tried and they were really good. I love going to southeast Asian restaurants and ordering papaya salad; there is something that is so comforting and fresh about it, and this is by far one of the best! The salad was really spicy which I loved and very balanced. The only thing I would have to say that was a little let down was the 24 hour beef soup. It was good, but I was comparing it to a Chinese beef noodle soup, which might have been the wrong decision, but none the less was still good.", "author": "Brandon C."}

It was both juicy and tender and the skin had a delicious seasoning and smoky char. The purple sticky rice came in a little bamboo container that made the rice extremely aromatic. The papaya salad on the side was a little too spicy for me, but it was a refreshing counter to the chicken.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-28", "description": "Edit - Farmhouse, you wily pak wan!  You have wooed a fifth star out of me with your promises of sour pepper water.  I am a sucker for flattery (and spicy vinegar).  Consider me bribed (and charmed).\n\n****************************\nI want to be irritated with Farmhouse.  Like, yeesh it's expensive and fancy and gentrifying the neighborhood blah blah blah.  But, ya know what, even though I'm from here, have lived in the Mission (off and on) for a couple of decades now, I'M gentrifying the neighborhood.  I setup my company's office in this neighborhood because it was near where I live and a lot nicer (for me) than being downtown etc. but anyway, I'm as much a part of this (or more so) than little ol'Farmhouse. Self-recriminating diatribe over.\n\nI'm one of those annoying bastards that lived in Thailand for a while (a year give or take) so it makes me insufferably fussy when it comes to Thai food.  Which is stupid.  Because cuisine does and should adapt to its environment.  Thai food made here from things grown here should be different than Thai food in any part of Thailand.  It's probably more of a mistake to try and make it \"100% authentic\" and yet, with that said, Farmhouse manages to give me all the best flavor memories of my time there.  Since it is right by my office, I've eaten there about ten times in the last few months and the only miss I've had so far was their Fried Chicken.  Rather than being a succulent bone in piece with maybe a light dusting of cornstarch and/or rice flour for a slight crisp coating, this was a full on breaded chicken tender that was rendered immediately soggy by the curry side dish it came with.  Overall, this dish was super heavy and confusing to me coming with both rice and potatoes and naan and a breaded chicken breast tender.  No balance and missing the strong spicy-sweet-herbaceous flavor profiles I expect and want from Thai food.\n\nBut enough bitching, everything else I've had here is dope.  The pad kee mao is maybe the most spot on ever.  In fact, I'm not sure, at this point, if I've actually had it any better anywhere else.  The pat ped (fried onion+pepper etc.) is awesome and the non-edible seasoning elements (little immature seed pods on a branch, not sure what they were in Thailand or here) which you must eat around none the less enliven the dish with truly unique flavors.  The Tom Kha and Yum, the Som Tum (papaya salad), the different curries, Pat Ka Prow (Thai basil stir fry) which are all, more or less, Thai classics, are rendered both perfectly and with a fresh simplicity that is flavorful and satisfying in just the way that has made many of us love Thai food.  Thai cooking strives for balance and proportionality using ingredients and flavor combinations most of us don't get in our day to day meals - spicy, sour, edible herbs (basil, mint, cilantro to name a few), sweet (important), rich, acidic etc.\n\nAnyway, I'm going on and on here.  Just give it a try.  I would give it 5 stars but it is a bit pricey (par for the course these days), the ambience is on the loud and not super cozy side for dinner (but fine for lunch) and it can get a bit chilly.  But their most egregious failing is that their condiment caddy (\"Puang Prik\") is lacking Prik Nam Som (literally \"sour pepper water\" which is essentially white vinegar with sliced jalapenos or serranos typically).  This diminishes my enjoyment of pretty much any Thai dish by about 41% and I have now resorted to making it myself and stocking it in my office kitchen much to the confusion and chagrin of my team.  Come on Farmhouse, Prik Nam Som is one of the four pillars of Thai condiments (along with Nam Plah, Sugar, and Dried Chili bits).  If you provide it, I will be left with no honest recourse then to update my review to 5 full stars (yes, I am attempting to bribe/blackmail you, I am that callow).", "author": "Milk N."}

Also the problem with these two dishes is, they shred sweet potatoes into noodle like sizes and fry them, they are remaining at the bottom of both these dishes and it is so fun and delicious to eat.\nThe Neua Nom Tok rolls are simply amazing.  The brined cucumbers and tender beef go very well together.  There is a green clinatro sauce at the bottom that you just want to lick up.  \n\nFor the main - I would have gotten the Panang Neua myself, but I wanted to try the Kan Toke Set.  The set was really good and contains a lot of variety. But for amazing taste, the panang would have been better.  There is also a distinction with how this restaurant makes their panang curry.  Other restaurant is a thinner consistency.  This curry is like a super super thick and flavorful sauce.  Its thick body and even richer flavor will drive you insane, add to that a super tender short rib, it was almost a panang curry gravy.\nThe flank steak was okay, I don't recommend that if you are going for interesting or flavorful, but the rice that went with it is some of the most delicious rice I ever had (I like the pieces of fried caramelized onions).   Also the blue rice that came with the Panang Neua tasted really good.  \n\nDessert\nReally, don't get the bread pudding.  Everything else is amazing.  We were all surprised that the chocolate cake was really well done(Thai & chocolate desserts, uhhhh???) - no, but it was amazing.  Everyone really liked the ice cream.

Sadly my wild king salmon was excessively overcooked, and I wonder if it really was wild caught as it had the appearance and texture of farmed fish. The blue rice that accompanied the salmon tasted no different than plain white rice, but the tiny dish of spicy sauce that came with the dish was indeed very delicious.  My friend and I shared the coconut ice cream topped with almonds and it was delightful.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-08", "description": "We eat out most nights of the week and will often take a break from our main go-tos to try out new places. As complete Thai nuts, we were really excited to try Farmhouse Kitchen as it's right in our neighborhood. We gave it a couple weeks after opening to give them some time to settle in and iron out any bugs in the new space and then went in about a week ago towards the end of June. \n\nService was outstanding. Everyone we encountered was incredibly friendly and attentive. Granted, there were only a handful of other occupied tables so this was not a good test of their service for a busy situation. However, we got the sense that this level of service would be maintained on a busy day as well. \n\nDecor was cute. Nice new clean space. I wasn't totally wild about some of the style choices but ultimately, eating out is entirely about the food for us. \n\nOn to the food. We have a couple Thai dishes that we use as a benchmark when venturing out to a new spot. Green curry, Yum Nuer/Beef salad and Tom Kha Gai soup. For this visit, we went with their green curry and beef salad. We also ordered the baby shrimp fritters and Panang Neua, a slow-braised short rib curry dish. \n\nThe beef salad ($13) was completely average. Fundamentally, there was nothing \"wrong\" about it but we've certainly had better in San Francisco. \n\nThe baby shrimp fritters ($10) were good if you like that sort of thing. This dish was recommended to us by our server and the flavors of the sauce were good and the baby shrimp were crispy and nicely fried. \n\nThe Panang Neua ($22) was good. I'd order this again...if it weren't $22. Tasty dish that was done well but priced too high. I might pay $15-17 but not more.\n\nFinally, the green curry ($13). This dish broke my heart in all the wrong ways. If you're going to open a Thai restaurant...in San Francisco...you have GOT to nail a basic dish like green curry. My husband and I have eaten green curry all over San Francisco and most recently in Paris and Berlin. There's a consistency that exists all over the world with a dish like green curry that shouldn't be too much to expect from a place ballsy enough to open in a competitive city like SF. This was BY FAR the worst green curry we've ever had. Visually, there was tons of oil that had separated and was floating on top of the curry. Upon spooning it out onto the plate, it was clear that it was in a pure liquid state equivalent to a thin soup. But we've had runny green curry before that at least had good flavor so we thought it might still be okay. Sadly, this was not the case. The flavor scarcely resembled green curry and we might not have even known this was supposed to be green curry if we hadn't ordered it by that name. The chicken quality also contributed to our disappointment. And what's with the blue rice? Maybe that's a Thai thing that we're in the dark about but not super appetizing, guys. White or brown rice will do just fine. I rarely leave a dish completely uneaten but that's what we did. We typically eat some of a dish that we're not thrilled about to be polite but could not even muster that with this one. The server was really sweet and definitely noticed. She asked if everything was okay like she wanted to make it right if we weren't happy. But there were no words for this. It was just plain awful so we just said it was fine. If the green curry was this far gone, what could we have said, really?\n\nThe table of three next to us were also unhappy with their dishes. I can't speak for them but I can say that we overheard them picking at their food and commenting in less than positive ways, leaving much of some of their dished untouched as well. \n\nBottom line: It wasn't a complete disaster. And their service game is solid. However, there are too many good Thai restaurants in the city that consistently serve yummy food at cheaper prices for us to ever return to Farmhouse Kitchen. And truth be told, I will deal with shitty service to eat kick-ass food any day. So great service alone will not cut it. Head over to Regent Thai on Church St. for some major no-nonsense Thai goodness that is crazy inexpensive for what you get. If you're looking for fancier Thai, Kin Khao in the Union Square-ish area is the place to be. You'll pay Farmhouse Kitchen prices but the food will actually match it.", "author": "Amy K."}

Upon arriving we were greeted by a fabulous host(ess) acknowledging our family of three immediately. It was a busy Saturday night, and I unfortunately was unable to book a reservation online, and magically we were ushered to a table. Farmhouse Kitchen's service exceeded expectations; the price point of the food is appropriate; and since we're on the subject of food it was exceptional from the wild salmon wrapped in a banana leaf to the fish cakes and even the brown rice was the best brown rice I've ever tasted. But what made the whole experience 5-star was the coalesce of perfectly done foods, prompt friendly service, all within the ambiance and stylized form of Thai culture reflected from the servers' attire and the occasional server carrying food on a basket with a rod throughout the restaurant floor.

I would recommended that you go somewhere else because not only is this place is over priced for what you get, the food is average, and the portion is small.\n\nI came here to celebrate my son first birthday which to me is a big occasion.  I have planned every details of the party and carefully selected the restaurant.  However my experienced at the restaurant was completely disappointing.  First of all I tried to call ahead and preorder the food so I don't have to deal with the ordering and the logistic when I arrive.  The staff still didn't have it together and had to interrupted me while I try to get my party set up and retake my food order.  I asked what is the problem that he couldn't use the order list that I provided earlier, but then he blamed me for being late and not arriving at 5pm when actually my reservation was 5:30pm and my husband and family did arrive before 5:30pm.\n\nBut what really made this restaurant the bottom of my list is how they were so unaccommodating.  My son wasn't eating much from their child menu.  So I asked the wait staff if they could do a side order of a fried egg, it can be scramble any kinds of egg, just egg.  The waitress came back and said that they are not able to do anything like this.  I was like it's just eggs.  Most of your dishes have eggs and you can't just do a fried egg.  Their respond was we don't do anything like this.  I was stunned and speechless.  From that moment I made a note that I would not again step into this facility.  For those of you with picky toddlers beware this place is not family friendly.\n\nFinally when it's time for the highlight of the evening.  The birthday boy is about to cut his first cake.  I asked the staff for a lighter to light the candles.  Instead they brought me a check.  a check?  I was stunned!  Did you not here me correctly or you can't see that we are trying to cut the cake.  And there they were handing me the check as if they are telling me that it's time to leave.  I thought that was such a rude gesture.\n\nI have to say this restaurant is not good for party gathering, service is disorganized.

We have been searching for a good Thai fish cake every where outside Thailand and found it in San Francisco.  Most flavorful and juicy fish cake, yet not oily.  We ordered two orders for the three of us.  The place is very cute, literally like a farm house.  The food comes in traditional Thai plates.  The papaya salad is very flavorful with different level of spiciness.  We chose very spicy because I came from Thailand and it met my palate.  Despite the spice, you can savor the freshness of the vegetable, meat, and ingredients.  Everything is fresh and not drown in fish sauce or sugar.  Every dish is well balanced.  Make sure you save room for the dessert with sticky rice and taro (a lot of taro which slight sweetness and creamy, heaven) and ice cream.  get your warm sticky rice and taro and mix them with cold ice cream will complete your scrumptious meals.", "author": "Yaw E."}

I came in by myself and was directed by their waiter to sit towards the back of the restaurant but first I mentioned to the waiter that I was going to use their restroom. After that, I sat where I was directed to. Once I was comfortably accomodated and reading the menu the waitress approached and asked me if I had a reservation, I said that I didnt but the other waiter had  suggested that table for me and thats why I sat there. She said they were fully booked and I said: Good for you guys standing up to leave. On my way to the exit she asked me for how many people would I need, that let me confused cause she said they were fully booked less than a minute ago. On my way out She insisted and repeated: For how many people I said: Nevermind, Im leaving this place cause Im hungry and you said you didnt have a table for me. By now all their customers were looking at me and not happy to have embaressed me enough she said in a loud voice: Have a good day, drink plenty of water clearly trying to falsely twist or claim that  I was on something else. By the way, If you treasure good and consistent service experience I strongly NOT recommend this place. Go elsewhere. Sorry but your reply below still doesnt sound genuine and just for your own records: The waiter offered me the table before I said I was going to use your restroom. I never ever will go there again and I will make sure my friends neither. I wish you change your attitude and get some customer service training. Regards.", "author": "Julian K."}

We ordered the Tom Kha soup to begin with - good flavors, nothing that was out of the ordinary. Ordered the fried chicken to share as main course - honestly, the potato curry was the best part of the dish! The chicken was good - but the breading was thicker than the chicken and it got to be too much after a while. A good dish to share. For dessert, we got both the coconut ones (don't judge us) - both were really good! Overall a good experience, but nothing really stood out to steal the show.", "author": "Sachee P."}

Oddly, with the d\u00e9cor they could be server California Cuisine, BBQ or any semi-casual American fare.\n\nStopped by for lunch as they opened just a block or two away from the office. Looks like same menu for lunch and dinner so prices for lunch are a bit higher than I'd expect. For example, as this is a Thai place, I always order the Phad Thai as my first meal at any new Thai restaurant to gauge their style and ability. For $14 I had the Phad Thai with chicken and opted for spicy. Just the right amount of heat. The dish was tasty but I can get a similar dish 2 blocks away for almost 1/2 the price. The chicken was a little dry, noodles were perfect however.\n\nMy guess is that rather than a regular lunch spot this is going to be better for special lunches for folks in my office and surrounding offices.\n\nWorth a visit. I'll be back, but rather than putting this place on my short list of local restaurants, this is likely going to be a spot that I visit once every two or three months.", "author": "matt g."}

This is not one of those. This is the real deal, this is as good as it gets.From the ambiance, to the food, to the music, to the staff. It all adds to an incredible *experience* - something you don't get in just any restaurant in San Francisco. And all for a decent price. Are you a fan of Kitchen Story? Are you a fan of Starbelly? Yep, this is yet another gem from the same owners. I could go on and on about the decoration of this place, but I will talk about the food first. Every time I come here I try something new. Every time I leave, I leave with a new favorite dish - is that not incredible? Following are a couple of the dishes I've tried: The yellow curry will not disappoint. Please do't forget to order yourself a side of roti - because it is the best I've ever had. The rice salad is my favorite started, but if I feel like something more hefty I wouldn't think twice about getting the beef jerky. The red curry short rib is the.BOMB.COM. If you can't handle spicy food - don't forget to ask for it *mild*. The samosas are also incredible. If you feel like a drink - the thai cooler is just so scrumptious. Finally - please say yes to dessert. Thinking about their bread pudding, it's moist yet sponge-y texture makes me giggle. I am not super into sweets - but this one is just the perfect amount of sweet. The servers are incredibly nice. If you can get your hands on the book \"You Are A Circle\" flip through some pages - it speaks some truths. One last note on the badass thai rock music they usually play.

We arrived and were told someone was still at our table. I asked the expected wait time and was told they had already paid. About 15 minutes later I asked if we could get a drink while we wait and were moved to the bar. About 10 minutes later we see the table leave and they quickly turn it then sit another couple there! I asked the hostess about this and she said they had been waiting longer. Although we hadn't seen them the entire 30 minutes we were waiting. Finally we get sat at a table in the bar. Food was average, split a couple of salads, calamari, and salmon. Salmon was quite nice. We ordered choco cake to split and it took another 20 minutes and that we had to wave then waiter down and remind him then it magically appeared. So when the bill came I expected given all the issues they would have bought our first round of beers or the dessert but no. I raised the entire experience to the hostess and she was indifferent. She was full of excuses then finally offered to comp the dessert.  I can forgive the mediocre food and delayed dessert service to being newly opened, but her utter indifference to the entire situation. With all the options in this city, I recommend you pass on this place. And slone side note, there are tons of tiny gnats or fruitfulness everywhere and one ended up in my beer.

It was chicken soup with a slight asian twist. It wasn't the right color and didn't have any spice to it. The shrimp pad thai was overpriced given the quantity of shrimp included in the dish was very skimpy. The spring rolls were not traditional. Rather than using rice paper they used what I believe to be wide rice noodles which were very thick and overpowered the rolls. In addition, we had to send the rolls back because two ingredients were missing - mint and cilantro. The meal was less than underwhelming and if that is a normal experience, then the average 4 star rating for this restaurant is very misguided. The only two positives were the wine and beer we selected. But at even that, the wine pour was less than optimal.", "author": "Tina B."}

Unfortunately, the cooking is just not there in my opinion, in fact I can hardly even associate it with Thai cuisine. I wish they would improve but chances are slim. Me and my Thai friend (who was bitterly disappointed in the food) ordered just two things: papaya salad (Somtum) and Hat Yai chicken. The first thing that came was a bowl of soggy sweat potato chips - totally unnecessary if you ask me. Somtum is a quintessential Thai dish, very simple and doesn't require cooking yet not easy to achieve perfect balance of sour, spicy, crunchy, fishy, sweet etc. When it's great, it's mind-blowing but in this country most of the time it's just a sad soggy salad. Farmhouse version of Somtum is nothing to write home about but at the very least there is an clumsy effort to make it right. Wrong chilies used (no excuse in the Bay area where Thai chilies are cheap and easily available), not enough fish sauce, garlic, lime juice. The chicken dish though is plain awful - overly sweet and not balanced. The boneless chicken cooked well but reminded me of some pseudo-italian chicken parmesan. Watery and cloyingly sweet curry is a cruel parody on Massaman curry of Thailand. Blue-died rice is just a gimmick (doesn't add anything to overcooked and flavorless rice). Cucumber instead of providing some relief from fried flavorless food is drenched in even more sweet dressing. My friend said it's an insult to Thai cooking. Next time, we will trot back to Sai Jay Thai in Tenderloin, grim neighborhood, plain setting, simple decor, no alcohol but so much better food!", "author": "Mikhail K."}
