How this is still possible in 2018?  Not sure but I'm not complaining.  I am a wing connoisseur and will never turn down a buffalo wing, fact.\n\nEnded up getting there around 9 ish.  The place was packed.  Wall to wall, uncomfortable, can't breathe.  You line up like cattle at the bar and place your order with the bartender.  There are a few sauces to choose from, I went with buffalo.\n\nWe were able to find a seat on the outside patio.  The wings were delivered right away-- they were okay! I mean, does anyone really have the right to critique a wing that you paid a loose coin for?  Probably not.  It was a decent wing, a little soggy but if you like super saucy wings, this is for you.  The BBQ wings tasted like corn syrup.  Again, if sugar is your thing, those wings would be right up your alley.\n\nThe atmosphere was fun until the bouncer started screaming at us to clear the patio.  Cool, you have a loud voice.  We get it.  I gathered the remaining wings I was eating and headed back inside with my group to watch the Lakers game.  There weren't any tables open so be willing to get creative.  We ended up using the busted shuffleboard table as a place to eat.\n\nAll in all, okay experience.  I've had better wings, I've had better experiences.  Honestly, I would chalk this up to a Wednesday only scenario.", "author": "Lindsey P."}

There are other reviews below of the same thing happening so watch out! It's ridiculous and annoying when businesses/employees do that. They have not responded to my email about this. \n\nMoving on...\nWe came for Wing Wednesdays. Each person has to order 2 drinks in order to get the 25 cent wings. We got some bottled beers and also craft - pretty good choices! As for the wings, we ordered habanero, bbq, and buffalo. The habanero was sweet and quite spicy but really delicious. Comes with ranch or blue cheese. The wings were spot on in general and at 25 cents can't be beat! They don't allow to-go boxes for wings!! Be prepared. \n\nThe place was super crowded and people really just find any spot to squat in which is fine because that's the vibe here.

The Totchos, which are tater tot nachos were super bomb. The tots were perfectly crispy, which is important when using them for nachos, and the toppings were tasty as well.\n\nThe service was great, even on a busy wing Wednesday afternoon. \n\nI've been here a number of times and each time has been consistently great.

They have weird/interesting decor with a display case containing a hodgepodge of oddities behind the bar, and mannequins in interesting attirr. The rest of the decor feels kind of modern/industrial. The mix of elements comes together really well! Perhaps because of this, it draws in a diverse of people of varying ages and styles. \n\nWe sat at the bar and the service was awesome! The bartender took the time to chat with and get to know everyone and we felt right at home. We ordered our drinks and the bartender made us memorably good Bloody Marys - they were nice and spicy and full of flavor (it tasted like they used Old Bay or a similar spice blend and it was so good!). \n\nFood-wise the brunch menu is definitely comfort food, with an array of gluttonous items to choose from (e.g. do you want a fried chicken sandwich served on a donut? How about tater tot nachos? Or biscuits and gravy? They've got your back!). I opted for the Giants Platter which had a biscuit with gravy, french toast, eggs, breakfast meat of your choice and tater tots. Everything was delicious and it was a HUGE plate which was super satisfying. My boyfriend ordered the Breakfast Totchos which we also enjoyed and was a similarly huge plate of goodness. \n\nAs added bonuses, the brunch is quite affordable for SF (most entrees are $15 or less!) and there was no wait when we went! By the time we left it did look busier with more of a wait, but nothing compared to some of the more intense brunch-waiting situations you might encounter elsewhere in the city.", "author": "Christine G."}

The line to order was definitely a solid 20-30 minute wait, and it's clear that Teeth is pretty understaffed - the cashier is also the bar tender. In order to get in on the 25 cent wings, you'll need to purchase 2 drinks. It wasn't immediately clear to me what the limit was, but the bartender let us know for the 4 dozen wings we ordered, we needed to get 6 beers. Everyone gets Modelo because it's the cheapest beer you can get at $4, but there's a few other cheap beers on the menu as well (though admittedly, they're not very good - think Bud Light quality beer). For 4 dozen wings and 6 drinks, it came out to roughly $50 after tax/tip/SF-health-tax which is pretty well priced. It's like getting free drinks on the house considering wings are normally about a dollar each on non-Wednesdays. I stayed for a while because one of our friends was running late, and I would advise you to bring a jacket for if you're sitting outside on a summer night because there aren't any heat lamps and it gets pretty cold in the back. If you're sitting inside, I'd suggest you bring some earplugs as the inside is LOUD; your ears might sustain some permanent damage if you come here frequently, as the music is as loud as your typical club. Expect to yell in order to communicate with your friends inside. Would I come again? Definitely! But just set proper expectations before coming in for wing Wednesdays. \n\nFYI. the death wings are extremely spicy, but the burn wears off in a few minutes. Definitely try one out if you're a fan of spice.", "author": "Austin W."}

A staple of the mission dive bar scene, this place has no problem filling up the weekend for a drink, and definitely for wing Wednesday. I most recently came here for one of these wing Wednesdays, and I got here around 5:30pm and was LUCKY to get a single seat at the bar for 5 people.\n\nFOOD:\nIt's hard to go wrong with 25c wings, so there are really no complaints. Decent buffalo wings which were tangy and spicier than your standard wings. Blue cheese dressing to help wash it all down. Only real critique is I wish it were fried a bit more to be crispier.\nBBQ wings were a tad light on the sauce, but were a nice simple sweetness that somehow also went well with the blue cheese dressing.\nWhen it's busy, like on a wing Wednesday during a warriors playoff game, the line for a drink (which there are two and they are usually located at the opposite corners of the bar) can take quite some time. Sitting at the bar, we had to wait for one of the bartenders to come back from her break to get a drink, even though we were literally sitting at the bar.\n\nIn the end, no complaints. 25c wings that were good, but not even close to great, on a packed night. I enjoy this place sometimes. Definitely a place you can come back to.", "author": "Bryant C."}

Indoors was hot, crowded, loud and smelled like chicken. Thank goodness they have a patio section with some picnic tables and tall tables. They also have one TV but nothing was playing at the time. 2 unisex restrooms covered in graffiti and stickers (per usual, you won't get bored in the bathroom). \n\nWe ordered the sweet chili habenero, bbq, and buffalo wings. For $.25 wings, they were normal sized and drenched in sauce which is a good thing. The mayhem tater tots were good, but like all things with toppings, it wasn't evenly spread. Not a biggie, their tots were still edible and crispy. \n\nThe reson for 3 stars is the method of the madness. I think they can be more efficient when it comes to service. Maybe more staff in order to have table service? (You have to order everything at the bar then get served at the table, even for extra dipping sauce). Maybe have a mini bar outdoors just for drinks? It'll break some of the crowd and make the line a little less long? Granted, it was wing Wednesday and it probably only gets that chaotic some nights.

I don't normally hang out in the Mission, but I haven't always had the greatest experiences in the past. I was still confused when I learned that it was a bar... like, what the? But then it happened.... I went inside. Let's just say that these teeth were poppin'!\n \nThe space is lively! Lots of people, great music, and a super diverse crowd. It's not the largest space, but the back patio is where it's at in the summertime! If you plan on coming here during the games, don't expect to find a seat unless you plan on getting there early! Wing Wednesdays are super crazy too. The wings are just amazing here and they have an amazing $.25 wings deal all night long on Wednesday nights with the purchase of at least two drinks.\n \nSpeaking of drinks; the bartenders here really know how to whip up a mean cocktail. The drinks are made super strong here, so just beware and make sure that you pace yourself. Happy hour is from 4-7 during the week and aside from wing Wednesdays, they also have some really good weekday specials!\n \nIf you decide to get the wings... because I KNOW you're going to get them: you have to try the sweet chili habanero wings! I could just rave about these damn things foreva, foreva-eva, foreva-eva! The flavor on these things are just so ridiculous! I think I ate about 50 of them all by myself and my mouth just about went numb! But it was OOOOHHH sooooo good!

Teeth also sells burgers, sandwiches, and salads but most people usually come here for drinks and WING WEDNESDAYS! \n\nJust wanted to highlight that Wing Wednesdays are 25 cent wings with 2 drink minimum all night. On weekdays from 4-7pm, there are $4.50 well cocktails (think simple cocktails like cranberry & vodka, rum & coke) and $1 off bottles and cans. Tables can be tough to get on Wednesdays. I recommend getting there early so you can make it to the happy hour special AND order wings! Parking can also be difficult around the Mission area. There's a lot of metered parking, but it is free after 6pm.\n\nOverall, the wings are pretty decent; it's definitely not the greatest but it's good for the price. Wing flavors come in natural, buffalo, sweet chili habanero, barbecue, or \"death\". You can mix and match the selection of flavors!

The place fills up really quickly on Wing Wednesdays, which starts at 4pm, so try to get here early, especially if you're coming with a large group. \n\nI recommend sitting outside in the back to enjoy the nice and hot summer weather. I'm not sure about the other foods that they serve here, but this place is ultimately a chill place to hang out and have some really cheap wings on Wednesdays.", "author": "George L."}

I've heard it called so many names now (Teeth, Teeth SF, Dr. Teeth, etc.) but in the end, it's pretty clear that everyone is talking about this place on Mission with the tooth logo out front. \n\nI first came for brunch and because I was driving later, I missed out on the bottomless mimosas but it was definitely free-flowing and quite affordable! I split an okay omelette, but the TRUE BRUNCH STAR for me was the shared order of totchos (tater tots + nacho toppings, including guac!). So good!\n\nI didn't think I'd be back for a while since this place is pretty far from me, but I ended up back here this past week on Wing Wednesday and WOW IT WAS CROWDED. I commend this place for keeping their wing prices (25 cents each!) low for so long! There's a posted rule of 2 drinks per person to get the deal, but with the crazy crowds this seems impossible to enforce. While wings come out pretty fast, I'd recommend sending someone in your group by 5pm to either order or grab seats unless you want to stand around for close to an hour. Also, watch out for the regular to high cost of everything else on the menu (pitchers of margaritas add up)! The natural wings and the thai chili ones were my favorite, but TBH I didn't try the others.\n\nTo finish this up, service seemed so-so whether it was fairly quiet (Sunday morning) vs packed (Wednesday evening). Our server dropped a wing as he set our tray down and was nice enough to get us two wings to replace it. I've definitely been to other places that just ignore dropped food--not cool.

If you're feeling especially like walking on the edge, try the ghost wings. They're made with ghost peppers, and whichever parts of your body come into contact with them will burn for at least the next 24 hours. They'll even give you a glass of milk to go with the wings, though it's one glass only, so drink it smartly. Would also recommend eating these wings with gloves because that sauce residue is invisible and deadly. Great for treating your enemies or just watching grown men cry. \n\nThe drinks are fun.

Buffalo, naked, and mango habanero are all good! I don't really mess with bbq wings. The wings are juicy, crispy, and decently sized. Only draw back is don't order too much, because you can't take any home! We've also tried their tots and the totchos and the garlic crab ones are both good!

We finally got the chance today and neither of us were disappointed. Just a disclaimer, this review is based purely on food and Wednesday happy hour, I know nothing about the drinks here.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n1.5/2 Stars for Taste --\nWhen you come on a Wednesday, you are here for the wings. They have original (a dry rub), buffalo, BBQ, and chili habanero. The wings are decent, but not mindblowing. (For $.25 cents though, I am not complaining.) My favorite is the chili habanero, which tastes more like that Thai chili sauce you can buy in bulk at Costco. Not a huge fan of their BBQ, which tastes far too tomato heavy to me. \n\nMy sister and I are fiend for fried potatoes, so we knew we had to order the Tot'chos (tater tot nachos). SO GOOD. The cheese wasn't the nasty theater chili cheese, but one that was thick, almost with a potato texture. Like chili cheese and bechamel sauce made sweet love and procreated. It was a perfect complement to the sour cream, salsa, and guacamole. A must try.\n\n1/1 Stars for Value --\n$.25 cent wings on Wednesday nights is the best deal in town. It was $11 for a large plate of tater tots (refer to the picture for scale). You can definitely share that plate with up to four people. The rule is that you have to get two drinks per person to get the Happy Hour wing price, but I think they usually let the \"per person\" part slide.\n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nI was a bit skeptical about the two drinks minimum rule for the HH price. I'm having surgery tomorrow so I'm not supposed to drink and my sister is practically a nun. The bartender let us know that non-alcoholic beverages count too! When I was here last time with a party of 6 or so friends, we kept on going back to order additional rounds of wings and they didn't make us buy more drinks each time...but that was probably because we bought like 3 pitchers the first time around. \n\nThe line was crazy the last time I was here; I probably had to wait 15 minutes just to place my order. I don't know if it was the rain tonight, but there was virtually no line. The wings and tots were out within 10 minutes. Super fast service here!\n\nBonus star because whenever I have a Wednesday night free and a hankering for some finger-licking goodness, I will drag my ass down to Teeth. 40 wings per person? Sounds about right. Next time, I want to try the crab dip tater tots!\n\nTL;DR: $.25 cent wings on Wednesday, two drink minimum. Try the tater tots.", "author": "Abby W."}

I wound up ordering the The Mayhem (Fernet Branca, Calvados, Templeton Rye, orange bitters, peychaud's bitters). It seemed like an interesting/potent medley of ingredients. The drink was actually just ok. Even though I like all the ingredients that went into my beverage, they just didn't all work together (at least for my palette). That being said, I did appreciate the effort/creativity that went into making of the drink. And for $11, I didn't feel like I really lost too much on this experiment. The cocktail still had a strong kick to it, so I could at least get a nice pre-dinner buzz going. \n\nBut what I really enjoyed most about Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem (beside its name) was the people watching. If I lived in the Mission, I would def make this my neighborhood watering hole. \n\nBTW, I heard through the grapevine that they do some great weekly specials, including: $1 tacos + 2-for-1 margaritas on Tuesdays, 25 cent wings on Wednesdays, and Bottomless Brunch on weekends.", "author": "Kevin B."}

We were on our way to a class on Mezcal in the Mission and needed to eat before we start tasting some hard stuff! Didn't want to get lightheaded after just one sip! Lol\n\nHe chose Tots (yay!) and, I knew just the place for it--Teeth SF. Luckily it was only 3 blocks from the 16 St. Mission Bart station. \n\nIt happened to be Tuesday which meant 2 for 1 Margaritas. A great deal for $8! We ordered that, the Crab Tater Tots, and Buffalo Chicken Wings. \n\nThe Crab Tater Tots had a nice amount of crab meat and sriracha mayo sprinkled on top of the tots. Yum! Get this if you like crab and sriracha! Next time though I'm gonna get their Totchos. Nachos and Tots sound like a winning combination! \n\nWe opted for 12 instead of 8 pieces of Buffalo Wings. 8 pieces would have been enough in hindsight since the wings were quite meaty. We tried to finish all the wings but alas we were unsuccessful. If you want a great deal, come here on Wing Wednesdays when wings are 25 cents each! Don't think you can find a deal as good as that anywhere else in this expensive city! \n\nWe got there around 5 so the place wasn't must have had about 8 patrons. The place is large, so if you have a big group, it would be a perfect place to gather after work. They also have an outdoor space. \n\nOur server was very nice. She checked up on us a few times.

Dr. Teeth is a staple Mission bar with people just looking to sit back and unwind after work. They have happy hour between 4-7pm with $4.50 well drinks and $1 off beers. While they don't carry any notable craft beers, you also aren't paying an arm and a leg for what they do have (ie. Guinness, Anchor Steam, Modelo, etc.)\n\nThere are a few tables but most seating space is communal, this goes for inside and outside. While most seating is bar height, there are a few \"booth\" like seats for lounging. With a dark red interior, it's a very lively and intimate environment, though gets stuffy when there are a lot of people - which is often. \n\nWings are 25cents each and they have 4 different flavors: 1) natural, 2) buffalo, 3) sweet chili habanero, and 4) BBQ. You can order any amount, either from the bar and grab a number or from a waiter/waitress (only if you're seated inside). The line is slow at the bar as there's typically 1 bartender that is both taking orders and making drinks - not very efficient. To \"qualify\" for 25 cent wings each person has to get 2 drinks, though I don't know how the bartender really tracks that... \n\nThe wings come out hot and piled on the same plate for each order. a few sticks of celery and blue cheese also come custom. The natural wings are a bit bland and tougher since they have no sauce. The BBQ are dripping in gooeyness and you can expect to need a lot of napkins. I like the sweet chili the best as they have a sweet honey taste and a slight spice, though nothing overwhelming as you might think with the habanero. They're not San Tung wings, but for 25 cents each, they're pretty damn good. \n\nAlso try the tots. You can get them as a side (hug pile) or as totchos. Because when are tots ever bad??", "author": "Liza X."}

At Teeth, Wednesday means Wings Wednesday. Their special is 25 cent wings with a minimum of two drinks (does not have to be alcoholic drinks)! \n\nI came to Teeth about a month ago around 5:30 PM and the place was packed. There was barely any room to move around the place and there was no open tables or seating (it is a place where you order at the bar and find your own seat). So after waiting about 30 mins or more, my group and I decided to leave and try again next time as it was somewhat hopeless for us to order and find a place to seat a party of 6+. \n\nA month later, I decided to go with my boyfriend and one of our friends (smaller party) and at an earlier time. We got to Teeth at 4:30 PM and basically split up. My boyfriend waited in line to order, which wasn't too bad as there was about 3-4 people in front of him. I went to the back to find a seat as we wanted outdoor seating as oppose to indoor seating. I was able to snatched up a bench table before a wave of people came in. When I walked to the back, there was about 3 tables opened and as soon as I grabbed my table, the other two tables were also taken. \n\nThe outdoor seating is nice as it has picnic tables and fake grass to give it a park feels. They have a water station outside for those that need water to down more food and dilute the alcohol, you do not need to walk all the way inside. It could get pretty cold out there as it did when I was there but when the sun was occasionally out, it did warm up for a bit. The noise level is what you would expect at a bar, relatively loud but it is based on the crowd that are out there.\n\nThe service was amazing. Within a minute after my boyfriend gets to the table, I had asked him to go back and put in an order of tater tots and it took longer for him to come back from putting in that order than for the wings to arrive and he only took about 5 minutes to order the tater tots and walk back. About a minute or two after he came back from ordering, the tater tots arrived as well. I definitely give props to the fast service as the place was starting to get packed at that time. \n\nWe got truffle tater tots and 50 wings (20 Buffalo, 20 Sweet Chili Habanero and 10 plain). The truffle tater tots were amazing. Being someone who love tater tots, one of my main criteria is that it must be crispy and it was. We were there for about an hour and a half and at the end, the tater tots were still crispy. The shredded truffles on top was amazing as it adds favor to the tater tots. The 50 wings shared with 3 people was definitely more than we all could eat so we ended up giving the remaining to our table neighbor. I am not a big fan of buffalo wings so I stayed clear of it. The sweet chili habanero tasted more like the Thai sweet chili wings that you would get at a regular Thai restaurant. The plain wings are hot and crispy. The wings overall was decent. They aren't the best in the city but they are amazing for the price. They taste like any other wings that I have gotten in the city so far (haven't gotten amazing out of this world wings yet, so please leave recommendations if you have any) but for the prize, I would definitely recommend it over other wings Wednesday locations.", "author": "Chenny O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-06-05", "description": "I've only ever come here on Wednesday nights for their quarter wings with the purchase of 2 drinks. If you come during happy hour, drinks average around $3-5 so you can get a full meal for less than $12. They are pretty lenient on the 2 drinks per person rule, considering there are probably way too many people in their for them to actually take note and count, so if you don't want drinks, just have one person order all the wings. The wings themselves are decently sized and for a quarter, so I really can't complain. My personal favorite are the chili habanero ones. They aren't as spicy as they sound. All their other flavors are just ok. Also, something to note is that their flavored wings tend to come drenched in sauce, so, if you don't like them super saucy, order some plain wings and toss them in the extra sauce yourself. This place gets super crowded so be prepared to wrestle your way to a free table (if there even is one), and then wrestle your way to the bar to place your order. The wings aren't the best in town, but for 25 cents, you can count me in. \n\nPros: \n- Cheap way to get a filling meal on a Wednesday night \n- Food comes pretty quick considering the number of wings they must have to churn out\n\nCons:\n- Terrible area to have to find parking in \n- Really crowded inside with almost no room to move around \n- Although there are a lot of tables, you'll be hard pressed to find an open one during peak hours\n- Flavored wings are drowned in sauce", "author": "Diana C."}

Would have been easier if it weren't raining and the back patio was a viable option. (The back patio is one of my favorite parts of this bar.  Darn. It did start to fill up quite a bit around 11:30 when we left.  I'm unclear on if they take reservations. I thought they didn't, but then there were a couple tables with reserved signs on them? \n\nFor brunch, know that it is a bar, and therefore kinda dark inside. And the music is kinda loud. But hey, you should know this.\n\nThey do have bottomless mimosas, I didn't get them though, so I can't speak much to the quality - but the table next to us looked like they were having fun.  I got a classic bloody mary, which wasn't all that great - it was too peppery. \n\nI got the Chile Verde Burrito, which was quite good.  The verde sauce was excellent. Really my only criticism is that there could haves been more meat, but I mean, usually there could always be more meat, right? And it came with sour cream.  I hate it when you have to add sour cream to your burrito for $1.25.  \n\nMy friend's biscuits and gravy with eggs was also good. Biscuits were standard - which is to say totally fine. But the gravy was really quite good and that's the most important part.\n\nReally quite reasonably priced as well. I'll come back some day and do the mimosas - hopefully when it's sunny and I can sit outside.\n\nI think this place is still more of a winner as a night bar for chicken wings, sliders, and 2 for 1 margaritas on Tuesdays, but brunch was really pretty decent.", "author": "Sarah C."}

Personal advice, get here early if you plan on coming for Happy hour as it gets really crowded and busy. There's also limited seating in the back but that fills up too.\n\nTypically I come in on Wednesdays because of their $0.25 wings. For classic buffalo wings, choose their buffalo sauce flavor. If you're feeling adventurous, I would recommend their sweet habanero. It's tangy flavor is comparable to Buffalo Wild Wings' Mango Habanero. If you're not into much saucy flavors, then the au natural is your safest best. I would stir away from the BBQ sauce simply because they drench their chicken in so much BBQ sauce that it becomes really soggy. Keep in mind that they have a 2 drink minimum for their wing orders, so order wisely. \n\nMoving along, if you need to nibble on something small while you sip on beer and talk with friends, I would recommend their Garlic Crab Fries. Ever since Coachella, I've been in search for Crab Fries and this by far is the closest one. It's not too heavy on the garlic so you don't have a pungent breath after every bite. I just wish they would be a little more generous with their crab and sriracha mayo. Their tots are also worth the try. I have tried their Nachos Tots but I wished I ordered just their regular one. The toppings would have been perfect with tortilla chips but not with tots. It just made the tots soggy and messy to eat. But when I got the chance to eat an untouched straggler, oh boy it sure was crispy.\n\nTheir sliders are also delicious. Priced at only $3 each, these sliders may be tiny but can get you real full. I tried their Classic and Pulled Pork, but my favorite would have to be the Fried Chicken. Just the crispy chicken paired with cole slaw and sriracha mayo is just amazing. \n\nAnd of course, the drinks here are cheap. I often get the Beer-garitas. Usually I'm accustomed to pairing Coronas with my Margaritas thanks to Chevy's Mexican Bulldog. But here at Dr. Teeth, they use Pacifico, which is a good alternative as it's not too heavy or make me full. Also please note that from 4-7pm, $4.50 for well drinks and $1 off of beers. Also their cocktails are quite strong. I've tried their margarita because I prefer tequila over any other liquor. After 3 glasses of those babies, you'll soon be forgetting whose round is it to buy next. \n\nDr. Teeth's is the perfect Happy Hour Spot!

It certainly was not due to the bar service or the other clientele which would best be described as murdery and over-served. \n\nIn defense of the service, I used to bartend and I know that Sunday day-into-evening crowds are pretty much the worst and that murdery is sometimes the best mood you can eek out, but a little effort on their part to seem like they don't mind bartending would have certainly been appreciated. \n\nWhen we walked in there were 3 incredibly drunk girls trying to run into and/or jump over a parking meter and I'm pretty certain that one of them was bleeding from the mouth (probably from something to do with the parking meter jumping) and that was only confirmed when I saw that same girl struggling to hold herself up to look in the bathroom mirror while here two equally drunk friends formed an open door posse in the bathroom entryway to laugh and give some very poor life advice to their bleeding friend. That scene was about par for everyone inside of Dr Teeth, while the patio (where we chose to sit) was sunny, sticky, and full (to a comfortable level) with at least moderately respectable human beings who did not go out of their way to make it painful to be around. \n\nWe initially ordered one of the cocktail pitchers to be split amongst 5 of us which was a pretty good deal and I think we each got a glass and half out of it and then most of us followed that up with a nice cold beer since the day was what would be considered a scorcher by San Francisco standards. \n\nFor food, I went with the dungeness crab totchos, as one does.

I got there with a friend first around 6:15pm. At that time, we couldn't find a table, so we hung around in the back patio until half a table opened up about 25 mins later. We snagged it for our party of 5. The other half of the table opened up and we ended up having dinner and drinks.\n\nSince it was Wing Wednesday ($0.25 wings all night), we of course ordered wings! There are some rules to observe, so make sure to read the signs: (1) 2 drink minimum per person, (2) No to-go boxes, and (3) Extra ranch or blue cheese (+$0.50). We started with a plate of 8 wings each: Au natural, Buffalo, Sweet chili habanero, Bbq. The wings came with I believe, a side of ranch. I didn't use it, so I'm not sure if it was blue cheese or ranch, but you can probably ask for either. My favorite flavor was the sweet chili habanero. It had a nice heat and I liked the contrast of flavors. The buffalo ones were okay. They weren't very hot. I'm not a huge fan of bbq sauce unless it's super spicy. It can be a little too sweet for me. So I thought the bbq ones were okay. I did get a side of death sauce so we could dip the au natural wings in it. My friends thought it was super spicy, but it was actually okay. There's definitely some heat in it, but nothing too unbearable.\n\nWe also got an order of Totchos ($11): melty cheese, pico de gallo, olives, jalapenos, salsa, sour cream & guacamole. Tater tots and nacho cheese are two of my favorite things in the world, so I adored this dish! So good! We also started with 3 Beer-garitas (or are they called Beeritas?) and a Diet coke. The total with the wings and death sauce ended up being a little over $50, so I'm not sure how much the Beer-garitas were. Probably around $10 each? A friend ended up getting another plate of wings and a second rounds of drinks. The beer-garitas were light, but fun to drink.\n\nSo much fun celebrating Wing Wednesdays. And you can't beat $0.25 per wing! Just make sure to get there early so you can snag a seat!", "author": "Elena N."}

Our server was super nice but I heard her telling the table next to us the last three shots (two tequila and one \"Bacardi bomb\" which she described as totally gross but that she  gets them all the time) she had just taken and it was very apparent that she was wasted.  She took forever to return to our table, the few times that she did, I had to ask for a box 3 times.  \n\nThere was ABSOLUTELY no reason to get the \"bottomless\" mimosas that she pitched to us because we were only able to have 2 or 3 each (and they are served in those tiny plastic cups you get on airplanes) since every time they came back to refill, they would get to our table last and wouldn't have enough left in the pitcher to refill ours.  Then they would forget to come back.  \n\nMy boyfriend liked his Giants platter, but my food was all cold and not very good.  My over easy eggs on top of my breakfast totchos were over hard and all of the tater tots were mushy.  I think our food must have sat in the window waiting for our server to finish her shots for a good 10 minutes.  That or they just prepare cold food.  And their prices are laughably high.   \n\nTo top it off, our server lost my credit card.  When she realized, she drunkenly staggered off with a look on her face like she saw a ghost.  She came back about 20 minutes later and handed me the bill fold and said \"funny, it was right where I left it!\" I opened the fold and my credit card had a fat, sticky, muddy footprint on it.  Had our server been just buzzed instead of totally sloshed, she would have had the presence of mind to wipe it off.  Now I have to cancel my card and get a new one reissued because I don't know what's worse: the scummy residue of over-served, under-aged douchers all over it, or the possibility of stolen credit card information. \n\nIt was a good day because I was with my baby, but there were a lot of other things I would have enjoyed doing with the 3 hours it took from start to finish.  \n\nCold, mediocre lunch, hammered server, lost credit card and a couple of rotgut mimosas was over $60.

Why would anyone not love this?! They have a few different flavors of wings to choose from: normal, BBQ, sweet chili habanero, and buffalo. The sweet chili habanero is definitely my favorite. It's a good balance of sweet with just a bit of spicy. I wouldn't recommend getting the normal wings though; they don't have any sauce on them so they're a bit dry and unflavorful. The chicken used for the wings is pretty good quality and have a decent amount of meat on them.\n\nTuesdays are $1 tacos and 2-for-1 margaritas!

(Fun fact: it's a band from the Muppets) From the quirky name and its location in the Mission, you can solemnly swear that you are up to no good. Indeed, there's a drink named slap in the face, a burger called the dick pick, and cocktail pitchers titled community service. This divey bar with its dry humor and decor of torsos is made for mischief and shenanigans. \n\nThe bar food features ingenious comfort food concoctions, the most famous of which is the TOTCHOS ($11). It's simple in concept but addicting in taste, combining tater tots with nachos toppings of melty cheese, pico de gallo, olives, jalapeno, salsa, pulled pork, sour cream, and guac. The tots get considerably soggy under the pile of toppings, so you do have to eat it ASAP.\n\nThere is a build-your own sampler in which you can choose 3 apps/tots for $16. It's a little confusing on the menu since it's right below the tots section, but we clarified that we can choose from any totos and appetizers (Also, they ended up charging us $22 because there's an extra cost for the totchos vs regular tots). We went for the totchos with SWEET POTATO TOTS and chicken, which I preferred over the traditional pulled pork one. I like to think it's healthier because the chicken is the cubed type like what you find in cobb salad, and it came with some spinach mixed into the toppings (vegetables in bar food? Unheard of!) The CHICKEN FINGERS were alright, decent but not particularly outstanding. Of note, it did taste different from the pre-made frozen ones with the heavy breading that you usually see. I enjoyed the REUBEN ROLLS, a clever fusion of spring rolls and the Reuben sandwich. Essentially, it was a fried Reuben... who can say no to that!\n\nService was great, especially since most casual bars in SF get away with no service at all. The server checked in on us quite often and also made sure that we had enough cups, napkins, plates and utensils for everyone as more joined our group. (Came with friends from dental school, who all of course got a huge kick out of \"Dr. Teeth\")\n\nTeeth Bar is definitely a fun place, whether for scoring their 25-cent Wing Wednesday deals or indulging in divine totchos late into the night.", "author": "Edna C."}

After a couple of strikes, I turned to my trusted list of Yelp bookmarks and found Teeth SF. I don't remember when I bookmarked it, but I'm glad I did because this was a good find. \n\nFrom other reviews, Teeth looks like it's usually hopping but for whatever reason we were able to snag seats pretty easily around noon. Sunday brunch calls for bottomless mimosas and Teeth delivered. For $15, we got some of the strongest bottomless mimosas I ever had. Two mimosas in and I was definitely having a good Sunday. At one point, the waitress told us that since the establishment was responsible for our safety after we left the venue, she had to start pacing us to keep us from getting too drunk. Is that an actual law or were they just budgeting us? \n\nAnyways, on top of the mimosas we got a round of bbq wings to share and I ordered myself some crab cake benedicts. The benedict was good and the crab cake was all right, but the tots that came with them were fantastic.

(If you don't mind maybe chilling next to the toilet for an hour or so down the road, but I'm pretty sure that was more my fault LOL.)\n\nFood 2/5: Idk if I've just been spoiled by LA (where food tends to be cheaper on average,) but food here is not good for the price, which isn't that expensive strictly speaking (plenty of $10 dishes on the menu)... but still expensive for basically being a glorified McDonald's (I think their main selling point is tater tots which to be fair is good but then again how can you mess up tater tots for drunk people,) except McDonald's tastes better imo. Best thing I ate here were the crab tater tots.\n\nService 3/5: Waiters were friendly and I really appreciated how my glass was never empty or empty for long, but they were pretty slow in regards to other things like food (lol can you tell I care about my food.) Oh and also my waitress got 3/6 orders at our table wrong so idk how that happened.\n\nAmbience 4/5: The inside reminded me of Cabo in LA (which people go to for Taco Tuesdays) and if you don't know what that is, just think dim red lighting and ratchet. We didn't get to go outside because apparently the patio was too crowded and I meant to check it out before leaving, but I kind of forgot due to having too many...\n\nDRINKSSSSSSS 5/5: Honestly you know bottomless mimosas are always going to be made from cheap af champagne and yes my hangover sucked, but drinks were strong and yummy and ALWAYS COMING, which are all that you should require from bottomless mimosas. They're also only $16 (I think,) which is p good. \n\nGiving it a 3 for now, because it wouldn't be my first choice for boozy brunch in SF (not that I've been to any other ones in the city... but there's always something better right??!?), but I have a feeling with a couple more visits, I would maybeee be willing to bump it up to a 4.

Great drinks, truffle tots and regular tots are also very good. Be prepared for a large crowd on this day though. \n\nFOOD: \nYou can't go wrong with .25 cent wings! The buffalo flavor was super good and the habanero was tasty too, especially if you like spicy. I'm not a huge fan of truffle oil anyway so I could do without the truffle tots but the regular tots were good. They also have tachos (cheesy tots). My friends and I didn't order them but they looked good. \n\nSERVICE\nIt's a bar and it gets pretty crazy so don't expect one particular person waiting on you. However, it was pretty easy to flag someone down. I suggest going directly to the bar and ordering your drinks there, much faster. \n\nAMBIANCE\nOnce again it's a bar and it was pretty hard to hear unless you are sitting super close to who you are talking to or yelling. The music was more hipster chic than anything else.  The crowd seemed cool but I do miss the days when the mission was actually the mission and there was more diversity at places like these.

Ok, read another review because this is just for their wings night.\n\nHere's the deal, when you buy 2 drinks per person, the price of wings drop to 25 cents each(minimum of 4 per flavor/per order). The cheapest way to do that is to purchase their sodas($3) or PBRs($4). I recommend the latter as they put ALOT of ice in their soda cups(no refills mind you).\n\nAs for the wings, there are 4 flavors. Here's my review on them:\n\nAu Natural:\nBasic fried chicken with no sauce, good to order at least 4 to dip in the sauce mixer which you will have later.\n\nBuffalo:\nNothing special but it's a staple\n\nBBQ:\nFor me, this was too sweet, but if you love BBQ flavor, this is for you\n\nHabernero Sweet Chili:\nThe best one for me, sweet and spicy, the perfect match to a beer/soda.\n\nSize of the wings:\nThe sizes seem to vary from: \"This is the smallest wing I have ever seen in my life\" to \"These wings are pretty normal size\"\n\nAnd now for why they have a 3 star review. When you order 4 wings(the minimum) they'll give you 1 sauce(ranch or blue cheese) and some celery. When you order more than 4 wings, they'll still give you 1 sauce and some celery. You see where I'm going with this? Personally, I don't really dip my wings into more sauce if there's already sauce on them but my friend does. We ordered 24 wings to start and go 1 sauce. When we asked for more, the waitress told us it would be $0.50 more. Are you kidding me? I would rather just order 4 more wings and get another sauce and celery at that point. Later, we ordered another 24 wings and guess what? 1 sauce.\n\nOf course giving this place a 3 star just for the sauce problem is quite evil, BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!\n\nFor some reason, even when the place wasn't packed and they have 4 waiter/waitress/servers and 1-2 busboys, they can't seem to clean tables fast enough nor check on your table every now and then.\n\nThe best thing I would say about this place is how fast the food comes out, but when you're ready to order again, your waitress will be MIA.\n\nTLDR: If you want cheap wings with 2 drinks minimum, this is the place for you, if you like to dip your flavored wings into more sauce, order in smaller quantities.", "author": "Da X."}

My friends got here at 6pm and by some minor miracle, we found seating at the bar area at the community table.  Started with beer and only a dozen wings and a regularly priced order of the tatchos.  Although it does seem weird to order a $11 dish of tater tots covered in cheese, salsa, guac, and sour cream but after getting my dozen wings and eating a couple of them, the tatchos actually were a good palate cleanser.  Those wings...yeah...they were quite heavily sauced.  I don't know if it's butter, margarine, fat, something in their sauces made those chicken wings feel twice as heavy in my stomach. After eight wings, I had to call it quits...and per the rules of wing Wednesday, I had to get my second drink to fill my two drink minimum.\n\nAfter 7pm, this place goes crazy.  I saw two servers most of the night handle a ton of customers all over the crowded dining room.  Despite the craziness, she was quite cordial and patient when we had questions or additional orders for drinks.  \n\nWould I come back for Wing Wednesday again?

However my friend convinced me to just give it a try. When my meal came out the chicken looked and tasted amazing. The chicken wasn't dry and had a good amount of flavor to it. The plate was drenched in syrup and the donut had a jam spread with five pieces of fried chicken on top. The combination was delicious. I usually find these types of meals very rich and overpowering but this one was just right. The saltiness of the chicken complimented the sweetness of the donut and jam. \n\nMy friend ordered the crab cakes Benedict which was very well made. Their pouched egg it perfect and oozed onto the crab cakes. They also added Holliday sauce on top and spinach at the bottom along with tater tots and some ranch. When I tried a bite of the meal the crab cakes were delicious but had a pretty salty seafood taste to it. Don't get me wrong I loved that kind of seafood flavor but I just found it a bit too salty for my liking. I think by eating the spinach along with it neutralizes the saltiness as well as a bite of a tater tot (I don't know why).  \n\nOverall the meal was delicious and I would definitely love to come back!

I've always sat in the outside back patio area where it's also dog friendly, the only downside is that the TV back there is a little small.\n\nBoth visits here were mainly to grab drinks after coming from eating somewhere else, so I've only had room to try the wings. I always get the sweet chili while my bf likes the buffalo wings, so we get the 12 pieces for $11. The weird thing about the service is that the waiters that serve the outdoor area in the back don't have access to adding items if you have a tab open in the bar.

Our bubbly pink haired server Ana explained in detail the plethora of wing options available to us with precision and expertise, and, despite her being a vegetarian, directed us in the direction of some delectable sweet chile habanero wings. Knowing our appetite wouldn't stop at wings, we also opted for the garlic crab totchos (yes, that is tater tot nachos for the nonbelievers) which were a fantastic choice. Drinks were unique and full of flavor as well, including a few of Ana's suggestions including the spicy cucumber margarita and something incredible with blueberries!

Our waitress finally came over with a blas\u00e9 attitude to say our food would be out shortly. Finally the food arrived and wouldn't you know it, she forgot to put in the tachos. She asked if we still wanted them and we said yes so we ate our other appetizers while we waited for the tachos which came 15 minutes later. An entire hour spent waiting for the main item we wanted to try. \n\nI do have to say the food was pretty great, the menu made up of something out of a glutinous dream, it had every guilty pleasure you could ever want. The tachos ended up being out of this world amazing. The mac and cheese was also delicious, so creamy it should be illegal. The fried pickles were good but strange, they were sweet pickles which was not what I was expecting, but the chipotle aioli they were served with was quite tasty. Buffalo chicken wings were also good, classic but with an added kick.  \n\nDrinks were also pretty great, I had a Mexicano Mule which is a Moscow Mule with agave and serrano peppers, evocative of a jalapeno margarita but even better. \n\nA really unique atmosphere and decent food & drinks, I just wish the service was up to par.", "author": "Caroline G."}

Came in, had a good crowd going and it was pretty easy to order. We ordered the totchos and each had 12 wings each and ordered one pint of beer each (which per their criteria it's a minimum of two drinks per order or so they say). Food was pretty good and the beer itself. \n\nNow to the annoying party, as I asked for the check from the waiter, she says that it's a minimum of TWO drinks per PERSON. I looked over the flyer that was in the stand (the flyer is double sided). On one side it says \"two drink minimum per order\" and on the other side it says \" two drink minimum per person\". I tell her that it says its per order and she argued back saying it's per person. I pointed out what was stated on the flyer and she said \"IT'S FINE BUT NEXT TIME IT'S TWO DRINKS PER PERSON\". At this point I'm thinking this establishment needs to get with it and stick with one story. If you're going to have a certain criteria it should be across the board that way people are not misled to false advertisement. Not only that, it's a liability issue if you get my drift. The manager(s) should look into that and fix it. Other than that, it's a cool spot. I'd probably swing by if in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way just to come all the way out there. Maybe the second time around my experience would be a bit more pleasant and I'll have a change of heart.", "author": "Angeline S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-13", "description": "Sinful sweet&salty brunch food paired with drinks and good company. I highly recommend turning off your health conscience before dining here.\n\nOur group of 6 started with Sunday brunch that blossomed into afternoon shenanigans. At 10:30 AM, it was fairly busy inside and out, so we were lucky to grab a table in the outside patio area. The patio has an upper level that, at the time, was occupied by a crazy fun birthday celebration full of bear costumes and alcohol.\n\nOf course, our own table had its fair share of alcohol with BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS at $15 per person. The servers are incredibly prompt with mimosa refills, which created a state of gradual, enjoyable drunkenness...for my friends :)\n\nWhen choosing my dish, the TOT-CHOS, tater tot nachos, were recommended, and I too pass on the recommendation. At $7.95, the combination of crispy tater tots, melted cheese (but not the tasty nasty cheese-from-a-can/jar), guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, black olives, and a generous portion of jalape\u00f1os (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vu9lAE9YVeLHpSpgD8Ncrg/l.jpg). As always, more guacamole and salsa would have been nice, but the jalape\u00f1os were a much appreciated kick to the dish. And if you ever need to choose between tater tots and fries, always go with the tater tots. Trust me.\n\nOur awesome waitress gave great brunch-exclusive recommendations: the jelly donut & fried chicken sandwich and the showdogs, aka pancake-wrapped maple sausages on a stick. The JELLY DONUT & FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH is served with homefries or tater tots for $8.95 (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dJrUicJXlv5NCNCqznOeTg/l.jpg), and the name belies the contents: a jelly donut cut in half, invaded by a deep-fried chicken cutlet and a slice of Swiss cheese. I don't know if the donut is homemade, the chicken cutlet isn't anything special, but the combination of the sweet glaze and thick raspberry jelly with the salty crunch of the chicken patty is euphoric. Sweet&salty4lyf.\n\nThe sweet&salty theme continued with the SHOWDOGS, 4 pancake-wrapped maple sausages on sticks (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AeWp3mdM73z4kw8Fx7HVGA/l.jpg). I forget the price, but I'm going to take a stab at $7.95. In essence, they're a much yummier version of corn dogs. Loved the maple sausages, and the maple syrup dipping sauce perfectly complemented the crispy pancake batter. However, I'd def recommend the JD&FC sandwich first.\n\nBacon is an extra $3. Oh, and any side of tater tots come with a yummy, slightly watery ranch dipping sauce. A basket of original TATER TOTS (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lwx5Xkc8PGHgxfIXRld-Mw/l.jpg) will run you $5.95. Seriously, those tater tots are bombdotcom.\n\nThe inside dining area has a bar, pool table, and TVs all around. They have Jameson on tap (my friend said other locations have different whiskeys on tap), as well as Fernet, a SF staple (http://www.foodrepublic.com/2011/06/01/fernet-branca-real-san-francisco-treat). Random note: given the hustle and bustle of this place, there is always a line for the women's restroom (only one stall). Amusingly, there are also audacious ladies who not only use the men's room but also get angry at men who try to use the men's restroom. This place is fun no matter what you're doing.\n\nBOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS (and prompt refills) for $15. Fernet and Jameson on tap. $0.25 Wednesday wings. Must try TOT-CHOS for $7.95 and JELLY DONUT & FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH for $8.95, if only once in your life.

If you get here around 6-7pm with a group of people, be prepared to (1) Stand and wait for table, (2) Have part of your group sitting down and the other part standing until the party next to you is finished! Sounds bad...but when you're with friends and exchanging laughs, time definitely flies by! \n\nWe usually get about 120-300 wings for our party, depending on how many of us there are. They have a few flavor options. I recommend the Spicy Chili or Mango Habanero! Yuuuuums. \n\nCAUTION: Dr. Teeth has their own \"Death Sauce\" made with Ghost Peppers (Scoville of a million!!!! Regular Tabasco sauce is around a Scoville of 4,000). Be VERY VERY careful with this if you do want to try it.

We waited about 10 minutes for someone to come clean the previous party's food and drinks but no one came, so we kindly asked her and she gave us the DIRTIEST look. I felt bad, we tried to stack things to help, but I'm sorry we had to ask you do your job. We ate our food, but decided to order 16 more wings and 2 PBR's because the wings are only 25 cents with a minimum of two drinks. She told us \"happy hour was over so PBR's are no longer $2, they are $2.88.\" That was fine with us! Nothing better than beers and wings. She comes back with the bill and says its \"$14.71 without tip.\" First off, we were a party of 4, not 8+ so obviously gratuity/tip is not included, there's no need to be a smart ass about trying to imply tip. Secondly, 16 wings is $4, two beers is roughly $5.76, and two ranches are 50 cents each. 4+5.76+1 = less than $11. And I know for damn sure tax was not $3+. My friend asked her about it at the register and told her we decided to cancel our order. The vibes were bad and she wouldn't explain the extra charges but she went ahead and charged it anyway. Why? I don't know.. We waited to get my card back, and when we finally did, she said \"I charged your card but deleted it, and you guys have to leave.\" WAIT, WTF? I assumed okay, it was busy and she wants people to be able to sit down and eat. But when we were leaving, she tells the security guard \"they can't come back in.\" I don't think she saw standing me there at first when she said that so he asked why, then she saw me and said \"oh nothing.\" What the f?? The security guard then asked us why we got kicked out. Idk, why? I wanna know too! You're telling me we got kicked out because we cancelled our order cause we didn't want to be overcharged and she didn't want to explain why?? I wouldn't trip over $3, she could gladly have it if it makes her mood better for other customers. But it's the fact that she had the WORST attitude with us the entire night. If you make a mistake and told us the wrong price for beers, EXPLAIN IT. We would have no problem paying more for it. But if you wanna try to hide the extra charges in hopes that we don't notice it, get caught and not explain why, and have a b*tchy attitude the whole night, then I suggest you find a different job before karma bites you in the ass.", "author": "Cassie T."}

Those were also good, but a full serving would have had me on heart attack status. This was a perfect portion. The last sampler we had was the Mac and Cheese.

Since I was with a man, and men usually surprise me with how much they can inhale, I figured it was better to be safe than sorry. But we had been drinking shots and craft beers, and my mind was way bigger than our stomachs. \n\nI asked for the wings to be cooked extra crispy, and the bartender said that was a no-go. But why? I always order that way when I'm at a table and with no flack. Mass confusion / sadness, but moving right along, I also asked for a side of Death Sauce (yes, I've had it and I like it a lot, that's why I get it on the side, eat at your own risk, yada yada yada). Food comes out, all sauces on the side (??), no Death Sauce. Hmm. \n\nKeep in mind, the place is starting to pop off, and the sole bartender is getting crazy drink and food orders, so it's hard to flag him down to correct this mishap. Anyway, we eat, we drink, we are merry. Then we get super full, just like the restaurant, and decide it's time to dip out to Cha Cha Cha for some sangria. \n\nWe asked for the bill and a box to take our remaining 12 or so wings (yea, we did very little damage, it's shameful) and the bartender said no to the box. Straight up. But we ordered two drinks each (actually more like 4 drinks each, but who's counting), and he said that if you could take them to go, everyone would do that, which is probably the lamest excuse I've heard. Dr Teeth offers their food for pick-up, but I guess that doesn't go for wings on Wednesday?\n\nAnyway, we were dismayed and off-put by this, as it is just ridiculous for paying customers to not be able to take their leftovers with them, even on a special night. It's not like we wanted to-go cups for our beers, or something crazy. We were able to hand our wings off to some mutual friends who were staying, but that burn was no bueno.", "author": "Crystal C."}

However, I do recommend getting some of each type so you don't get sick of one or the other (except for death, but more on that later). \n\nAnyways, the indoor seating is pretty limited, but there's a lot of outdoor seating. If you get there before 6pm, you'll probably be able to get an outdoor table. The indoor tables were gone before 5:15 though. \n\nThe wings come out lightning fast when we ordered.

The girls who were sitting next to us offered us some of their death wings (they got like 4 and didn't eat any of them), so we manned up and tried one. Oh. My. God.

Word to the wise, this place gets crowded and people become hawks looking for tables. And wings aren't really the type of food you eat standing up. And be very territorial with your seats. \n\nAs for flavors: Sweet Chile Habanero, Buffalo, BBQ, and Au Natural (dry).\nSweet Chile Habanero is hands down my favorite. Don't let the word habanero scare you. The buffalo wings are actually much spicier. Wings are accompanied by a blue cheese dip and a few celery sticks. The buffalo packs a kick and it doesn't help that the thick delicious sauce gets every where, spreading the burn. Don't forget to ask for extra napkins...you will need them. The bbq flavor I'm not really a fan of. I'm not sure if it's too sweet or too tangy, but either way, I always jut get the buffalo and the sweet chile habanero. These three flavors come with an overload of sauce, so if you're into dry wings I guess you can get the Au Natural flavor which is just the fried wings without the sauce (boooooringggggg). \n\nAlso one more word: TACHOS. \nthat's right.

Great decor and fun atmosphere. $0.25 wing Wednesdays are so worth it because they are not anything close to wing stop/ hooter dainty wings. Minus 1 star for the nasty bathrooms. \n\n\n$0.25 wings: sweet chili habanero tastes just like it sounds, and if you are into sweet and spicy like I do then this flavor is the one for you!\n\nOriginal wing: just your good old fashioned fried chicken wings, tasty for it being plain\n\nMac n cheese truffle: OMG I love truffle oil! This mac and cheese was ok it was kind of cold by the time it got to the table =(\n\nReuben egg rolls: the hubs loved this and i found it to be quite delicioius in eggroll form. \n\nWhiskey breeze: A sea breeze but w/ whiskey instead of vodka... it was OK\n\nCucumber cooler: refreshing and tasty\n\nI'm going to try the jameson on tap next time hahaha\nAside for my gripe with the bathroom I do have to note that there are inconsiderate people in there.

This place had great reviews on Yelp, so we decided to give them a shot.\n\nIt was a Friday night and they were clearly understaffed. It was over 10 minutes before a server came to give us menus and another 10 minutes before she came back to take our orders. \n\nDr. Teeth has a great selection of cocktails including 60 oz (!) pitchers of some of them. We ordered a round of drinks thinking that we'd probably try a few types of drinks over the course of the meal. However, they didn't bring out the drinks until after our food came out (30 min after we placed our orders). The server kept coming around to tell us that she would bring the drinks soon, but it took way too long for her to actually make it happen. I had the Old Cuban (which was a rum drink) which tasted mostly like the bitters in it and not much else.\n\nSo far, everything that I've mentioned has been negative; so why 3 stars? The food was awesome! I had the Strangelove burger (jack cheese, chipotle mayo, and bacon) cooked medium with tater tots as the side. The burger was juicy, flavorful, and cooked exactly to medium, and the chipotle mayo really complemented the cheese and beef. The tots were awesome too. I also tried some of the truffle fries and those were nice too (they didn't go too heavy with the truffle oil). \n\nThe atmosphere of Dr. Teeth's is cool too. We really enjoyed sitting at the picnic tables they had in the outdoor seating area. \n\nOverall, I think that the food made up for the slow service and I'd be willing to go back on a less crowded day.", "author": "Ravi S."}

I guess it's the cold weather, low bank account, absence of the pretty Christmas trees and the second chin I grew during the holidays. \n\nBut there are glimmers of happiness for me throughout the dreaded month of January, and one of them is brunch at Dr. Teeth with good friends. (This does not help that second chin issue...)\n\nI have been to Dr. Teeth for brunch more times than I can count, and can't think of a reason to complain. Well, yes I can. They should see me walk in the door and pour mimosa down my throat and shove tot-chos in my face before I can even get to a table. But other than that, Dr. Teeth is the perfect brunch spot, and one of my happy places. Sometimes people who are feeling down envision their \"happy place\" and picture a beach in Hawaii... yeah, mine is the patio at Dr. Teeth, where drunkards are tossing bean bags by me while playing corn hole, the sun is shining  down on me and I'm knocking back quite a few glasses or champagne and OJ with a buddy. Tot-chos are in front of me and then some kind of breakfasty concoction makes its way to my face and all is well. \n\nJanuary is over now (thank God), but my relationship with Dr. Teeth isn't. \n\nDr. Teeth, thank you for saving me money on therapy.

The outside canopy has a picture of a tooth on it, which initially led me to think it was a dentist, but boy was I wrong. Both outdoor and indoor seating are available. The inside is dark, dimly lit, loud, and full of more hovering people than there are outside. At least outside, I can breathe and hear what my friends are saying, as well as be able to see the food in front of me! I honestly like the outside seating more, despite the cold outdoor feeling. There are lots of TVs inside and one outside, which is a plus for any sports fan.\n\nI seriously don't think you can get any better than 25 cent chicken wings (all night) and $3 PBRs (until 7 PM). We usually order about 90 wings and 1-2 orders of tots (don't judge), and for each person in our party of 5-6, it's only $7 bucks a person. The wings come in buffalo, original, barbecue, and sweet chili habanero (my fave). THE TOTS ARE TOT-ALLY AMAZING. Maybe it's because I'm just tots fan in general, but the different varieties of toppings (crab, taco toppings, etc.) you can get definitely bring them to the next level.\n\nGET THERE EARLY!! Or at least designate an early bird to get a table! By 6 PM, the tables are taken and there are already a good amount of vultures hovering around. I must say, it takes a good amount of hovering, awkwardly asking people, and a combination of speed and extreme luck to grab a table.

Like everyone else the habanero were the most memorable. Also, ordered the tot-chos and reuben rolls both were tasty.  \n\nOne tip, they don't let you take any wings home which is weird. All in all, its a fun spot to come after a long day of work and get your wing on! \n\nWill definitely be back to try the jelly fried chicken sandwhich and corn dogs.", "author": "James H."}

I didn't know what the fuss was all about then I saw how cheap it was to order a big plate of wings to share amongst friends. We just ate the buffalo flavored wings. I'm a big fan of tater tots and had to get the \"tatchos\". Interesting concept and I actually thought there would be nacho chips in there. They had big screen TVs here that showed the 1st game of the World Series and then showed the Warriors game afterwards. I finished off all that food with a Jameson and Ginger.\n\nThe thing that turned me off were people who were asking if we were leaving the table soon. Nope. We reserved it for a reason and we aren't leaving until we feel like leaving. I also felt sorry for the shuffleboard here as it turned into a makeshift table for people as I saw plates and drinks on it.. The men's bathroom door doesn't close so it would be awkward if you had to go and it was a number 2. I could also barely hear conversations even though the music wasn't playing really loud nor were the TVs.", "author": "Gerard Y."}

We seat ourselves, wait close to 20 minutes for ANYONE to even notice us.  The place wasn't even that full, there were still tables available outside.   WHEN WE DID GET SOME ATTENTION, 20+ MINUTES AFTER, WE GET ONE MENU, WHICH WAS SOAKED IN SOME NASTY ASS ALCOHOL. STEP YOUR GAME UP.  \n\n2.  We get a \"new\" waitress, and she tells us they have a new chef and everything on the \"old menu\" is gone until further notice.  ACTUALLY,  WHEN WE SPOKE WITH SOMEONE ELSE WHO WORKS THERE, THEY SAID EVERYTHING WOULD BE AVAILABLE AFTER 3PM, SO STOP LYING TO US JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW JACK ABOUT ANYTHING, NOOB.  OH, AND HER ATTITUDE WAS DOWNRIGHT DISGUSTING.  \n\n3.  This \"new\" waitress, doesn't tell us our orders come with tator tots, so we end up ordering two separate orders (thinking that our orders didn't come with them).  Guess what, OUR ORDERS DID COME WITH TATOR TOTS AND YOU JUST COST US TWO ADDITIONAL ORDERS, ridiculous.   How did you even get hired?  Hopefully, at best,  it was out of pity.\n\n4.  After waiting literally over an hour for some tator tots, and a burger, they bring out my burger and didn't even tell me they didn't have the fries I ordered.  Guess what these idiots put as my side?  YUP, FREAKIN TATOR TOTS.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-19", "description": "Came here on a Wednesday night for their 25 cent wing special after a long day of hiking. Between 3 people, we ordered 4 DOZEN chicken wings (regretted afterwards) and the truffle tots (since they ran out of fries) and we each got a beer. We ordered the bbq wings, sweet chili habanero wings, and the buffalo (original) wings. My favorite of the three were your good old buffalo wings, flavorful and had a nice kick to it. The bbq wings were my least favorite... the sauce was too sweet. The sweet chili habanero was alright, it didn't stand out as much as I thought it would and it wasn't spicy at all, in case you're wondering. The truffle tots was delicious! Tots in general are good, but throw some truffle on it, AMAZING! The wings/drumettes are huge, compared to other place. We made the mistake of ordering too much and ended up having about 8 pieces left. Since the pieces are so large, it's hard to get the center to be flavorful... so near the end of the meal, I just ate the outside since that's where all the flavor was. I probably wouldn't mind paying 25 cents for smaller pieces if they tasted better. I guess you get what you pay for? Overall, you will come out feeling full after this meal.\n\nPlace gets extremely packed because of the specials. Looking for a seat? it's like the Hunger Games in there! Be prepared to be asking all the tables if they're leaving or soon. Luckily, a couple was willing to share their table with us. If you have a table, you can order from there (which goes by a lot faster) but if you're still scouting for a table, line up with the rest of the people and you'll get a number to put on your table once you find one (this way takes longer). Service can be a bit better, but I guess if you're coming here, you already have low standards for service. My waitress accidently dropped a chicken wing on me when she was clearing the table. I don't blame her since she had her hands full and the place was packed. I just wish she came back to wipe the table... instead we had to resort to using napkins to clean our own table.

I love when that happens.\n\nTheir brunch menu is out of this world, and third-world priced.

They paid for their meal and were just still sitting there talking even though they were done.

Not super great, some of the pieces were cold.. i'm pretty sure they just buy low grade chicken and precook a bunch ahead at time.

The only sauce flavor you really need to get is their SWEET HABANERO CHILI SAUCE for your wings, because the flavor is EXPLOSIVE in your mouth.  A little warning to the non-spicy food eaters--it won't burn, but it might still make you pant like a dog (just a little).  \n2.  You need to order at least 2 beverages total (it can even be a non-alcoholic drink) in order to qualify for the 25 cent per wing discount. \n3.  If you cannot finish your wings, they WILL NOT give you a box to take them to go.  However, they will give you a small container for your side dishes that you paid full price for.  I mean, it's understandable...because you shouldn't ask for a to-go box at a buffet, BUTTTTTT....DAMN...I didn't want these tasty wings to go to waste!  So...a little FYI--be prepared to eat all of what you order.  \n\nMy eyes were bigger than my stomach this time around, but nonetheless....LESSON LEARNED!\n\nSide note:  I'm impressed that the waiters/waitresses don't ever write your orders down and they bring the right order out to you every time.

I'm not exactly sure what that means, but my point is that I absolutely love Dr. Teeth.\n\nFor one thing, they have really great happy hour deals and a different special every day of the week. Not too shabby for Stephenie. Wing Wednesday is one of my personal faves, partly because it gets so wild in there. SFers sure do love 25 cent wings, I have found. They used to have trivia on Tuesday, which was absolutely fantastic, but they have sadly dispensed of it for some ungodly reason that I will not even try to fathom for I wish not to fill my soul with grief and sadness. But they have $1 tacos and 2-for-1 margaritas on Tuesdays instead, so that's a fair enough consolation prize, I suppose.\n\nBut more importantly, Dr. Teeth has some of the best bar food I've ever had the pleasure of shoving down my gullet. Totchos? Yes, please. Bacon Mac 'n Cheese? Yeah, I'm all over that. Burgers? Don't mind if I do. The point is that their food is bomb and it's pretty reasonably priced, in my humble opinion.\n\nAlso of note, there is a pretty cool patio area out back that is fairly large. It was a fantastic mini-getaway when we watched game 7 of the World Series (Mad Bum!! Woohoo!!!) in that jam-packed oven of a dining room. I should also point out that during that game, it was (understandably) crowded as a mofo in that place, yet our server was still awesome.

Most of all, there's a ton of seating both inside with tables for larger groups as well as lots of space outside with the patio (and there's corn hole outside too!!!!!)\n\nOverall, it's a GREAT choice if you are in the Mission.  The only downside is the lack of parking, but 'tis the life of living in San Francisco.  I plan on coming back for Wing night on Wednesday!!!", "author": "Robert T."}

I'm not a huge drinker anymore and I'm also not 22 anymore so for me it was a miss. Our group was reminded at least 9 times by the waitress that every person needed to abide by the 2 drink minimum to partake in wing Wednesday (25\u00a2 wings). Some of us didn't even know if we were going to eat wings but that was irrelevant to the waitress. I understand her responsibility but why don't they change this to a minimum charge on the bill or prepaid tickets or something else so you don't constantly have to be harassed about this? \n\nI ordered an old fashion and for $11 it was pretty lame. Lacked any sort of love, not that I need love in my drink, maybe just a quick assurance that my cocktail is a cocktail and not a well soda drink. \n\nRegarding the wings: It's not a bad deal to come on wing Wednesday but I personally would not brave the insanity that ensues; your dedication to wings will determine this. For me it was way too crowded and way too hard to get the waitress's attention (although she did her best).\n\nThe haberno wings and Au natural wings were great. Buffalo was not my thing. The ghost pepper was great. Delicious and spicy with bragging rights upon completion.\n\nSo in summary, this place is fine. It just isn't regular joint for me considering the crowds and drink quality.", "author": "Katie A."}

That is until reality hits the next morning and you realize that you inhaled your entire daily caloric intake in 5 minutes flat and consumed as much salt to bloat you to a Michelin blimp. *Bashes head on wall*  \n\nIf you're going to have this kind of regret, then stay far, far away from Dr. Teeth & The Electric Mayhem.\n\nIf tator tots and fried chicken alone weren't bad enough, Dr. Teeth has found a way to make bar food staples even more gastronomically artery-clogging. From tator tots smothered with an avalanche of melted cheese, guac, and sour cream to a fried chicken sandwiched between two jelly donuts, the food at Dr. Teeth will have you popping a Lipitor or two but it's totally worth it. Dr. Teeth is like the Broken Record (http://www.yelp.com/biz/broken-record-san-francisco#hrid:48ZPHYyTmHSHAM-gWQ_l7g) of The Hipster Mission. \n\nIn celebration of Hump Day last week, we started our happy hour with the gut-busting Tat-Chos ($7.95): Deliciously crunchy tator tots topped with melted cheese, jalapeno, pico de gallo, creamy sour cream and buttery guacamole http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y8mGQTwmFaSu3d7dAywOHA?select=CRIJQ8J_Y3PIkWcuXag7bA .

The Napoleon complex suffering corn dogs were disappointing in length and girth but did redeem itself with its nicely spiced sausage. Umm, that so did not sound right. :X Anywhoo....next came the Wake & Bacon Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Bacon, Cheddar Cheese & Fried Egg ($7.95) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y8mGQTwmFaSu3d7dAywOHA?select=AJH_upFc-gltUalms4Rfgw. The crisp bacon against the oooey gooey cheese and the fried egg was sinfully good but with a dip in the tomato soup adding a bit of a garden fresh tang, it made it a tad bit less guilty. Needing to get maximum stuffage, I threw my order of the Croque L'oignon Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Gouda, Ham, Caramelized Onions ($7.95) on my friend's plate and he reluctantly inhaled it. But he inhaled it nonetheless, so I'll take it that it was good http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y8mGQTwmFaSu3d7dAywOHA?select=WH_AHkSKwjq49KMMBfEHlg. I knew men were good for more than one thing.

Definitely Wing Wednesdays -- I swear, this place is the ultimate place to celebrate the end of hump day (especially if your work day realllllly sucked). Take advantage of their full bar or the open patio in the back while devouring 25\u00a2 wings! I believe they now have a new rule as of a couple months ago (two drink minimum if you want to take advantage of their wing special) but it's no biggie. If you decide to come here, just be ready for a night of good food and alcohol in an exciting atmosphere!\n\nAs for the wings, I opt for the sweet chili habanero flavor every time. It has a little bit of a kick to it, but the sweetness of the sweet chili pairs very well. Don't forget to pair the wings with an order of totchos (crispy tator-tots topped with the goodies of nachos like guac, sour cream, salsa, and cheese). Wash it all down with your favorite beers or any alcohol of your choice and VOILA - you have yourself a good night. \n\n** PLEASE NOTE ** - when you're deciding what flavor of wings you should get for the night, the spicy atomic wings should not be on the top of your list unless you want to throw it up in the bathroom or sit in the corner in agony. It does, however, turn into a \"How Ballsy Are You?\" game where my friends and I occasionally test our limits as to how spicy we can actually eat. I'm not joking when I say that even a lick of the sauce can turn your night around. The worker that took my order even warned me that eating these ghost-pepper wings can be painful (and an additional thank you for warning me that you guys ran out of milk). If only I recorded my friends and I eating these. It would've been a great laugh seeing us all struggling, sweating, and tearing over just a small dab of the sauce. \n\nI've never made a trip here and didn't enjoy it. This place attracts a wide range of crowds and it's always been a pleasure to meet locals or visitors that are just passing by in San Francisco. \n\nAnddddd...here I am at the end of my review realizing that it's actually Wednesday today.

My instinctive reaction when someone warns me about an unassailably spicy hot sauce is to order some in a champagne goblet, add vodka, and take it as a shot; all the while looking straight in the eye of my challenger, laughing maniacally as a look of mute horror spreads across their face (this has only happened once in real life, the aftermath was impressively unpleasant...). \n\nDr. Teeth makes Ghost Pepper \"Death Sauce\" (I'm sure you can guess where this is going). I ordered some on the side of my burger...and havoc ensued. While I enjoyed the smokey flavor and initial numbing burn when I tasted it raw, the infernoesque aftermath left me stoically blinking back tears and gulping down vast quantities of beer.  Adding it to my \"Death\" Burger (10.95) wasn't a much better choice, and although the ciabatta bun (what is this, 2001?!) soaked up much of the flavor, the spice remained, almost overwhelming the properly-cooked to medium rare, coarse grind of the meat. Applying some to my  \"Fries a-la-mayhem\" (which seemed to be a take-off of in-n-out's Animal Style Fries) was a much better option, with the fiery malestrom bringing out the sweetness in the caramelized onions, the earthiness of the potatoes, and cutting the salt of the cheese sauce. \n\nI did not give the bartender the pleasure of seeing me cry, but I most certainly did spend a few minutes in the bathroom, trying to scrub the capsacian out of my beard. \n\nEverything else was unremarkable, with decent happy hour pricing (4$ well cocktails, 3$ bottled beers), an above-average cocktail selection (I especially liked the \"Mayhem\", a Fernet infused Manhattan), and a poor selection of beer (four taps, none of them unusual or compelling). With only one bartender to handle a Friday night rush, service was on the slow side, but, in her defense she was certainly nice (and her job seemed to involve a lot of muddling, every bartender's nightmare). The crowd  trended toward the tech world and twenty-somethings stamped from the mold of the Marina district, none of whom I particularly felt any desire at that moment to mingle with. \n\n3.5 Stars: A good happy hour, a good burger, acceptable fries, and holy-shit-that's-hot Death Sauce. Probably not worth a special trip out from the Richmond District, but I would consider going back if I'm ever in the area.\n\nExtras:\n\nAccessible to every Mission corridor bus line, Bart, the 33-Stanyan and 22-Fillmore.\n\nBe not afraid of the creepy mannequins on the wall...and why does every bar in this city have to use Edison-style bulbs for lighting?\n\nDiscounts available using Swipely.\n\nOwned by the Tonic Group, whose specialty seems to be nostalgia (hence the name inspired by the Muppets).\n\nJameson and Fernet on tap!", "author": "Casey U."}

We showed up, and literally got shoved around for 20 minutes before someone told us that it would be an hour to get seating inside, but if we wanted to sit on the back patio, we could put our orders in at the bar. There was no list to sign up to wait for a table inside - one of my biggest pet peeves at restaurants.\n\nThe back patio is nice once you get past the weird area that looks like a scrapyard.

I wish they'd taken the money and area they put into having a nice astro turf lawn and bean bag games and put it towards more seating.\n\nThe waitress never came to our table to take orders, check on us, or even get us waters. We were the table between the other two, so she was very obviously skipping over us. What the hell? The bar back was out there and more attentive and helpful than she was, so we ended up tipping him only. He seemed really frustrated and apologetic with everyone else's performance.\n\nIt took us an hour to get our food, and it was cold and incorrect.

There is an outside area, though, but you'd want to be inside by 8 PM to hear the trivia questions. There is also a shuffleboard I've never played, and a bathroom I've never used.\n\nFood (Tuesdays): $1 tacos (steak, chicken, fish, or veggie) and BOGO Margaritas ($5 each). I haven't had the veggie tacos, but my favorite would be the fish. The steak tacos have too many onions, and the chicken tacos are too bland. The fish isn't beer battered or anything, but still good. I've also had the Easy Rider Burger (9.95), Onion Rings and the Tot-Chos (7.95). The burger was simple but good (on nice soft bread), Tot-Chos were good, but the onion rings were soggy and nasty - would not ever get again. On Taco Tuesdays though, you definitely get the best bang for your buck if you order tacos. I'm inclined to describe the margaritas as \"decently strong,\" but keep in mind that I am a three-shot wonder and am positively STARVING when I get here (and the food takes a good 30 minutes to arrive). My friends all pound back multiple margaritas when they come here.\n\nTrivia: Trivia starts at 8 PM, maximum 8 people per team, hosted by the sassy gay MC Casey. Always lots of fun, and people come up with some really creative team names. 4 rounds: 1) Current Events; 2) Mystery (changes weekly); 3) Music; 4) Random. 1st place team wins a $50 gift certificate, 2nd place team wins a bottle of hard alcohol (random), and 3rd place team wins a round of shots (8). One time they were a nice fruity concoction, another time it was Jameson. Though I'm sure you could ask for whatever because the bartender is really chill.\n\nWhen you leave you'll want to walk in a group though, because the outside is kind of sketch at night (it's Mission St, duh).", "author": "Cynthia W."}

The hardest part about visiting your restaurant is that it's always full and there's no rhyme or reason to getting your seat. So there's always a competition between you and the three other parties all looking to be served who are hovering over the eating customers and all waiting to pounce on the next open table. It's pretty frustrating, especially when you've been waiting the longest, but someone else was in closer proximity to the table when it opened. Even a sign-up sheet would fix this problem, and improve the experience for everyone.\n\n2) If you're going to have a trivia night, get a better microphone/sound system. Half your patrons aren't playing and they're all yakking, and the host has the world's quietest microphone, so everyone's annoyed on trivia night.

There was also that beanbag toss game, the appeal of which I don't understand, on the patio.

The wings - we ordered with three kinds of sauces: buffalo, BBQ, and habanero chili - I loved all three. The buffalo had a kick to it, the habanero was more of a sweet and salty assortment, the BBQ was good old fashioned barbecue. \n\nI liked the seating in the outside patio better than the indoor seating - there are games on the upper decks for you to pass time with. \n\nReally good experience- even with the wait and all.

We were so damn hungry that we had very low standards at this point.  So I ordered the burrito that was supposed to come with chili/meat. A basic ass burrito would have satisfied me. What did I get? A tortila with eggs and tater tots. After telling our server that I didn't order this weak excuse for a burrito, she told me that they ran out of the other ingredients. Isn't that something you tell a customer before you make the food? Or at least when you hand it to them? Two of us ordered the burrito so 1/2 of us didn't eat bcus we were not about to pay $11 for tortilla with egg and potatoes when Taqueria Cancun was down the street. They also managed to mess up the remainder of the meals they didn't already totally mess up. \nNeedless to say, this place is great if you like wasting your time and money.\n\nAnd while I'm still confused about why this place has such great reviews, I'm guessing it's because everyone who wrote a review was drunk so their standards were probably even lower than mine.", "author": "Paulina T."}

The margaritas used to be better with the old bartender - he would make fancy stuff with cucumber or strawberries, but last time I went the bartender only made standard but mediocre ritas which were not very strong. \n\nThe wings are delicious. We usually get 20-30 or so for 2 people of the chili habanero, buffalo and bbq wings. They don't allow you to take any extra ones home with you, so if you order way too many the way I usually do, bring a little container with you to take the leftovers - they are great reheated in the oven or toaster oven. \n\nDO NOT under any circumstances order the death wings unless you like being in intense pain - I love spicy food but honestly they should not even be on the menu; they are not fit to eat. After eating one, I thought my head was going to explode and I couldn't speak for nearly 10 minutes. Nothing could cool me down, it was too intense! Then on the way home my stomach got totally messed up and I suffered for 2-3 days. Bad news. Stick with the non-lethal wings!\n\nAnother thing I love about this place is their tater tot bar!

No big deal. I didn't expect to be seated right away. Time goes by and 2 people in our party decide to venture off and go eat elsewhere. So we change our party to 3. This is where the FUN begins!\n\nThe girl asks us if we mind sitting out back where it might be cold. We stupidly accept the offer because we are starving! So we get taken to the back and lo and behold a table with two WOBBLY AS FUCK chairs and three chairs just standing around waiting to be broken. She asks ME to grab one and I get one that looks like it was picked up at a yard sale. I'm thinking - where the eff am I? Am I getting paid for this? This is NOT my job. I'm hungry so I think \"Whatever, I'll sit here.\" and just grab the damn chair. \n\nServer is nice and we get the bottomless mimosas and all. Are they good? Hell no. Nasty and watered down. For the food I got the Mission Scramble and my friends got the sliders and some other plate I don't remember. My food was not great,  and the eggs tasted undercooked. Best part of my meal? The tater tots (thankfully!)\n\nAnyways, the reasons I'm giving this place a two is not only because the table/seating area was shitty, the food was nothing special, and the mimosas were watered down, but also because of the HORRIBLE experience it was to sit out back. \n\nWe were sitting there attempting to enjoy a meal when we begin to notice BLACK STUFF in our drinks. Where could it be coming from? OH! The motherFUCKING people right up next to us SMOKING like there's no tomorrow! Management allows this sort of thing? I understand the smoking part, but hello, common sense people. You have paying customers who do NOT smoke just trying to get through a meal WITHOUT eating/drinking cigarette ash! So I even ask my server and the guy refilling drinks for new drinks - COMPLETELY IGNORED ME. My server looked at me like I asked her to perform brain surgery. Instead of bringing me a new cup of water or mimosa, she brought us the bill. Fuggin' joke.\n\nI seriously do not understand the appeal of this place and the 5-star reviews. \n\nNever coming back here again.

Found a spot outside and bummed it at a table that was reserved for 6. Ate the food and kept looking out for the person that was going to come and claim the table. What I noticed was everyone walking outside was trying to stake out a table that was leaving. It sucks not to have a place to sit and eat. \n\nGuy came at 5:55 and asked if we were going to be there any longer and I said we were finishing up, just trying to get some boxes.\n\nApparently they don't give boxes out on a Wednesday.

Admittedly, I'm not much of a drinker anymore, but I decided to indulge and imbibe in an adult beverage.\n\nI ordered a Blackberry Fix (or is it Fizz?). It was $10 (a bit steep), but it was tasty. It consisted of Skyy vodka, crushed blackberries, lemon juice, and a big blackberry for a garnish. There's another ingredient, perhaps elderflower?, to give it some sweetness.\n\nFor all of my fellow foodies, Dr. Teeth seems to have an extensive menu of bar food taken up a notch. They have appetizers, sandwiches, salads, tater tots (!) ... the list continues. On this particular evening, I was stuffed with Thai food, so I will have to try their cuisine at a later date.\n\nSomeone told me that there's an outdoor patio, but I'm a wuss when it comes to the brisk SF nights.

The bottomless mimosas was definitely appealing.  I came in a little after the place opened for the morning and there were a few guests already seated.  With that in mind, I was surprised at how slow everything was from placing our order to finally getting our food down to paying.  Granted by the time we got out of there the place was packed, I at least expected to get our food faster.\n\nNow for the food.  My boyfriend ordered the Mission Scramble and I got the Mushroom and Spinach Omelet.  But out of curiosity we decided to start off with an order of \"tot-chos\" (nachos style tots).  The tot-chos were decent but after the cheese got cold, it wasn't so appetizing anymore.  My boyfriend's Mission Scramble was good but nothing special and my omelet was awful.  I don't remember the cheese they used but the texture and taste was so bad that I couldn't even pick around it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-05-03", "description": "I am sure I wrote a review of my experience here. Has it been removed? Very weird.\n\nLike many others, I dined at Dr Teeth in early April with a Living Social deal.  I'd heard mostly positive things about the restaurant/bar in the past and was excited to give it a try.  When we arrived, they were already very busy, and we were informed that there would be an hour wait.  They offered to start us on the bottomless mimosas, so no problem, we agreed to wait.\n\nAs time went on, we realized the host at the door was doing little to manage the seating of the waiting parties.  The waitresses did not seem to be updating him when their tables were leaving; people were seated out of turn.  There are large picnic tables outdoors that appeared to be self-seated, but we were told we couldn't sit there.   We were a party of 2 and it took almost 2.5 hours to be seated!  They ended up using a large table to seat 4-5 parties of 2 after hours of waiting. My impression is that they didn't want to \"waste\" the other tables on a small party.  The entire time, the host refused to give any estimates for the wait (even once it became clear his original estimation of an hour was way off base).  In fact, he seemed to be spending a lot of time talking to a friend rather than paying attention to the situation inside the bar.  I am sure they were in violation of fire code / capacity restrictions at many points in the day.\n\nMeanwhile during this wait, we saw people eating standing up near the bar, holding their plates, because they did not want to wait any longer;  people with plates sitting on the ground outside by the picnic tables, because they didn't want to wait any longer.   Dr Teeth was generous with the bottomless mimosas, which made for long restroom lines.   While we were waiting, one of the patrons also stumbled outside and puked by the restaurant entrance.  Who knew brunch could be this classy?\n\nDespite all these issues, if the food would have been good, I would have considered going back again.  The bottomless mimosas were disgusting.  The 'juice' tasted more like 'fruit drink', I'm guessing watered down concentrate.  My order of eggs Benedict and tater tots was incredibly average.  The eggs were a bit overcooked (and not served very warm).  As for the tater tots, I guess I was expecting not to get the same sort of frozen tater tots I could warm up at home... maybe my expectations were wrong.  (Let's be real for a moment:  frozen tater tots taste better when eaten on my own sofa).  \n\nThe only positive points of the day were that the looooooong wait gave me lots of time to catch up with my friend, and that the waitress for our table was cheerful and fantastic, despite what I'm sure was a very stressful day.  In fact she was the only decent person working that day.", "author": "Heidi M."}

It was shocking to me since I never expect this many people would be out for happy hours on a work day. Well, I guess we were just like them? \n\nSo they have this 25-cent chicken wing/leg special that you have to order with a minimal of two drinks. I had two bud light since I didn't feel like drinking, plus 10 pieces of chicken, with two sauce choices, half and half, and it only cost 11 dollars! What a steal, isn't it? \n\nThe crowd there seems nice and they have a nice patio/deck in the back. It's perfect for those who'd want to enjoy their food with a taste of nice weather the city has the offer. \n\nMy only complaint was that it was way crowded. But hey, good food, good crowd, and good price. I guess everyone will come over for that. \n\nI'd recommend against driving over there if at all possible. Parking was terrible and it took 20 dollars for me to park next doors, which was a bummer. So by all means, if you can take public transportation over, you definitely should consider that option!", "author": "Victor K."}

Wasted in more than one way.\n\nI should have known better as the day went from beautiful stroll past Dolores Park to pee drenched streets of Mission. The fact that I had to present my ID before even getting in the door could have been strike two. Yelp's description of ambience: \"Hipster.\" Yeah, I should have known better. \n\nI had purchased the Living Social deal after looking on Yelp. \"Well this place seems to have decent reviews\" so it seemed safe. We arrived around 11 am and the place only had a few open spaces (plenty of outside seating). We chose a spot near the front window. When the waitress finally came by she noticed I had the deal and got us started right away. We were sitting near an older couple, the man was eating wings that were not sitting right with my nose. We chose one of their omelets and the jelly donut chicken sandwich. The omelet was bland. It needed salt, more ingredients, or better cheese... did it even have cheese? Clearly it wasn't memorable. The eggs seemed slightly overcooked and dry for my liking. The jelly donut chicken sandwich was interesting but maybe only because it actually had flavor. The food was nothing to write home about. The deal also included mimosas and a shot of liquor (I don't think a shot of anything should be served with brunch). So we finished up, paid, and left.\n\nAs we made our way home, I was under the impression that I was just sick from the booze. Wrong. It went from bad to worse. Random upchuck in the park :( followed by even more embarrassment as we attempted to get back to our neighborhood via the Bart- so, so sorry Bart station but I'm sure you've seen worse from homeless people. I don't even remember half the day, waking up in my apartment with my coat and jeans in the wash because I threw up on them. For the next 16 hours I was either passed out in bed or hugging the toilet from food poisoning (because no one continues to puke like that even after their stomach is empty). I'm lucky I recovered before my boyfriend took me to the ER to have my stomach pumped.\n\nNeedless to say, after that traumatizing experience I will not be coming back to this establishment.", "author": "Miffy Y."}

They have bar food down. They have \"bars\" for tater tots, mac & cheese, and burgers. Other foods, like french fries, have almost as many options. In fact, they offer five kinds of sliders. We tried four. My favorite was the rueben. Somehow, corned beef, sauerkraut, and 1000 island dressing are even better in miniture. It made me want to try the full-sized version sometime soon. The frenchh dip, which had a really wonderful au jus, was a close second. Tatertot-wise, we opted to try the buffalo bleu ones. With buffalo sauce and melted Point Reyes bleu cheese, they are savory and delicious. The portion size is huge, too. After working our way through a mountain of potatoey goodness, eating five sliders seemed daunting. My friend made it through, but I only managed four. Of course, having a taco in addition to the tots didn't help. It was taco tuesday (only $1 each!) and 2 for 1 margarita night as well. We couldn't resist. The tacos aren't bad either. The one sip I had of my friend's was STRONG. Together on a regular basis, they might be dangerous. I heard the veggie taco is the thing. Next time, it's on the docket. Tuesday was also trivia night.

They weren't able to give me pancakes as a side anymore, unfortunately. The sandwich was amazing! The sweet taste of jelly donut along with the savory juiciness of the fried chicken just blew my mind completely. The tater tots were also really, really good, although I wish we had ketchup. It came with a ranch dip as well as habernero Tabasco and Cholula, which I was also pretty happy with.\n\nMy friends got the Mission scramble as well as some other kind of omelet. The eggs dishes were HUGE, and I'm pretty sure nobody was able to finish.\n\nI was way too many mimosas in and very happy at the end of it all.\n\nService got a bit slow later, as the bar got really packed around 12:30, which was understandable, although annoying.", "author": "Michael W."}

Top it off with their Tate-Tot selections and you can't go wrong.\n\nWe had a party of 4 and was able to get a center table next to the bar and kitchen, and in between all three flat screens (especially good spot during bball season).  We ordered up 20 wings to start (half sweet habanero chili sauce and natural with a side of \"death sauce\" - made from ghost chilis).  We also had the Tot-Chos (tater tots with guacamole, melted cheese, jalape\u00f1os), and the Garlic Crab Tater Tots (topped with garlic aioli, and crab).  Sweet habanero was super tasty with a little kick balanced with the right amount of glazed sweetness.  The natural wings with a smidgen of death sauce was explosive.  The heat from the death sauce just builds in your mouth and is not for the squeamish.  Both tater tot dishes were good (how can you dislike tater tots).  Tot-Chos won me over with the right amount of crispness with melted cheese and a little heat from jalape\u00f1os.  Will try their sliders next time around.\n\nThey even had Jameson on tap...  Which we had to partake along with Lagunitas IPA, and hefeweizen also on tap.

So owners cute brunette with long straight hair and awesome figure (i know you said your name but PBR had its way with me) deserves an effing raise!\n\n4 star goes to the adorable bartender. The stache made my day. Also alot of bartenders when confronted with a drink they haven't heard of will be dicks about making it. I am obsessed with cactus coolers, but nor cal seems lacking in them so I routinely have to explain this at bars. (citrus vodka floater of peach schnapps dropped into red bull with NO orange juice!) He was just like okies tell me whats in it and bam drinks made and in my tummy. I also am a huge bloody mary fan and I think I would actually mission here hung over for one it was that good.\n\n4stars go to the awesome back patio. I had some not so great tan lines from sitting out there.\n\n4 stars to an actually maintained shuffleboard! so many times places have shuffleboard but theres no sand on it so the games :(\n\n4 stars for their drink specials. Me coworker and man all go pretty wasted over a decent 5 hours for around 70 bucks. (roughly 5 an hour for a good time)\n\nBathrooms were a bit icky but hey its a bar not a lounge so i can't hate. Over all I am sooooooooo glad i gave it a chance cause we had a super fun time, the drinks were strong, our waitress was bomb, and the crowd turned super fun. Can't wait for July to start drinking again and do the bottomless mimosas.\n\nSo thank again friend for suggesting!", "author": "Meg N."}

I mean, OMFG, it's the fucking Electric Mayhem, can you picture that?\n\nIn the end, the bar doesn't incorporates almost any Muppet theme into the decor.  For the very in the know, there's a single peacock symbol on the wall along with the very prominent Dr. Teeth sign out front.  Otherwise it appears to have left over decorations from an S&M club.  Odd.\n\nSo I came for the decor (which isn't there) but stayed for the burgers and beer.  It's got surprisingly good bar food!  Burgers are moist real beef patties on a nice bun, veggie burgers are good according to the wife.  The philistines who eat the tachos (tater-tot nachos) seems to love them.   The one thing I haven't heard love for is the fried pickles.  Which is fine by me cause I hate pickles.\n\nOh, and beer.  They have that too.  The taps aren't anything too special, typical SF favorites.  But your drinks come in old jelly jars which is always fun.\n\nIt can be crowded sometimes but wade through the crowd to the back where there's often still plenty of space.

Wednesday nights are chicken wings night and the place gets hugely packed with people!  You need to arrive shortly after opening otherwise you won't get preferred seating.  They offer I think 6 types of chicken wings.  As a fan of all things spicy, I tried their \"Death Wings\" and they live up to the hype.  I had one and that was enough.  They basically use hot sauce that is used for large soups.  The others are all basic and standard, but the flavor is good.  There's a large hidden patio in the back, so follow the hallway back.  The patio is cute, but could use some updates to make it more consumer friendly.  On the top tier where we ate, it was pretty dark.

Bad service, hipsters, expensive drinks, crowded, etc. and our experience was just the OPPOSITE.\n\nWe showed up on a FRIDAY at 6pm, right in the middle of most bars slam time, and the place was only slightly crowded.  Granted there were a dozen+ people outside because it was so nice out, but inside, it was just us, another 2 tables and a few guys at the bar.\n\nWe had a group of 15 people who straggled in over the course of a 2 hour period, and we had our own personal waitress, even after all the tables in the bar were filled with other customers.\n\nWe were a nightmare--ordering food and drinks EVERY time she came back to the table (8+times) and asking for separate checks, paying for drinks in cash but food on a tab, that sort of thing.  We also had a Groupon, but we got ZERO attitude and amazing, doting service.  We literally never waited to order food or drinks, and everything came out quickly,  was correct and on the right tab.  Maybe they got a new waitress?  Ours  was a young, leggy blond.\n\nI was happy to see the dude with the curled mustache at the bar because so many people had spoken highly of him on here, and his service was no disappointment.  \nWhen I went up to order drinks, he acknowledged me right away, even though the 5 people at the bar were clearly regulars and he was chatting with them.  He's one of the few bartenders in the city who can work AND talk at the same time.  Shocking, I know.\n\nThe guy ahead of me ordered like 15 drinks, and even apologized for taking so long (though it was only like 2 min) and because everyone around (staff and patrons) was all smiley and inclusive, I would have waited 15 min for a drink!  It's amazing how few people know that a genuine smile/eye contact and an *I'll be right with you* can get you FAR with customers.\n\nWe also ordered 7+ plates of food and although most everything on their menu is a gut bomb, it was still mighty tasty!  \n\nDid I mention $4 for 24oz of PBR?  YES!

This place is terrible. \n\nGranted, this was probably during one of their busiest times (New Year's Day) and they simultaneously had a Thrillist special going on. But if they were going to do a special intended for a drunken New Year's crowd, shouldn't they have prepped for it? They were extremely ill-equipped for the crowd.\n\nWe waited almost 20 minutes before getting a single look from one of the wait staff, who told us we needed to order at the bar. After getting thrown back and forth between the wait staff and the bar, we finally made our order.\n\nWe had joined our group of friends who made it to the bar a bit earlier than us. We met them in the back patio, which was a nice, quaint location to have a nice New Year's brunch. Unbeknownst to us, we would have to wait a solid 1 hour before the first part of our group received their food and then another 1 hour before the rest of us got sick of waiting. At best, the food our friends got was cold and unappetizing.\n\nThe only redeeming portion of their meals was probably the tater tots, but even then, we weren't able to experience those tots on our own. Having waited a solid 2 hours for our food, we went to talk to the wait staff who were no longer coming to the back patio and they said that our food was 6 more orders back. Are you kidding me?!\n\nWe decided to leave and asked for our Thrillist refund so that we could either use at another time (or in our case sell it to someone else). That seemed to work smoothly, but then the damn manager had the gall to tell us that we had to pay for the bottomless mimosas that were a part of the meal. Really? Yeah, and it was $15 per person, the same cost as the damn Thrillist deal. GTFO.\n\nSo we argued with the manager a bit more, stating that we had little of none of the mimosa to drink. He tried making excuses about how many people were there, but really, that's not our problem. I'm a reasonable person when I go to restaurants because I've worked in the service industry, but this was a completely negative experience that I hope no one ever has to experience during their time out.", "author": "George D."}

I got the Blackberry Fix drink, a burger, and my friends and I shared truffle tater tots and sweet potato fries. The Blackberry Fix is a delicious drink. You can definitely taste the liquor, but it's not too alcoholic tasting for those who might as well just be taking a shot. I also had a sip of the Whiskey Breeze and that was also pretty good. Not as heavy on the alcohol as the Blackberry Fix, but good and I'm not even a huge fan of whiskey to be honest. The truffle tater tots were gooood. Not as truffle tasting as I expected, like truffle fries from Unami Burger, but still good. Sweet potato fries, a choice you can't go wrong with. Burger was delicious and it even came with this sweet chilli sauce that was great for dipping. Service is good and our waitress was really nice.

We had just all-you can drink mimosas, which were pretty low grade, but, there are lots of other drinks.  In this place, you're paying for the atmosphere.  \n\nThat being said, I don't know how this place gets 4 star averages given its food.  I ordered a spinach and feta omelet, which was delicious, but came with a massive 1/2 plate of bland tater-tots and a fruit cup of mealy banana and a few slivers of strawberry.  They were out of some of their more famous sides, including the bacon.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered scrambled eggs, toast, tater tots, and sausage.  Everything was so bland and grey, it was basically tasteless.  The tater totes aren't tossed in any spices or anything.  They come with a dill-mayo dressing that could be good, but which was so watered down with milk, it wasn't.  The sausage was terrible.  \n\nThe service here is good.

The service was slow since my coffee was forgotten until I annoyingly reminded the waitress  and the food could be better. I ordered the 2 egg special and tater tots at $9.00 and it was not epic. Tater tots might be from the grocery frozen food section, thawed, and baked. My peeve was to be charged $15 for bottomless mimosa that is strong yet served in plastic cups. Shouldn't I feel special with a real champagne glass if I pay $15?  Circa charges $10!  Also the LivingSocial deal was not a deal after all since you left spending more than you anticipated for tax, tip, etc. \n\nAnyways I think there are many other spots in the city that have brunch that is just as tasty and worth what you spent.", "author": "Patricia P."}

First off, we were so very disappointed by the fact that there's nothing whatsoever related to \"Dr. Teeth & Electric Mayhem\" (of the Muppets) on the walls.  The walls are pretty bare, and there's soooo much potential to pimp that place out with some sort of muppet-related anything.  But, there's nothing.  We were quite let down by that aspect.  We just figured it was copyright infringement or something which is why there's nothing, but, then don't have that name, right?\n\nThe food and menu, on the other hand, we totally love.  Now, it was only my wife and I, so, not knowing how big the portions were, we got an order of buffalo tots as an appetizer.  It was a mountain of tots!  It was awesome.  We couldn't finish them.  They were doused with buffalo sauce and had blue cheese interspersed throughout.  As well as a side of blue cheese.  They were slightly soggy from the sauce, but the flavor was great and some of the ones with not as much sauce still had that nice crunchy outside.  They weren't TOO spicy hot, either, which is good for some people.  Would definitely order them again.\n\nWe also got the egg, bacon and cheese sandwich with a side of mac 'n cheese.  The sandwich rocked.  I would definitely get it again.  The mac 'n cheese was good too.  You could taste the sharpness of the cheese.  And possibly a hint of truffle oil.  We dug those as well.  The menu was great with tons of things we we wanted to try, but of course couldn't  try it all - burgers, wings, fries, sliders, etc.  The combinations of ingredients in the burgers and sandwiches sounded  awesome, so we can't wait to go back and try some more food.", "author": "dave g."}

I dole out my stars based on how well an establishment meets my expectations, and Dr. Teeth was better than expected.\n\nI went here on a Thursday with boy because we wanted to eat the ghost pepper wings. Well, I sure did. I've been telling him for months that I love spicy food, and he would sass me with his half-Mexican birth certificate and tell me that there is no way a white, Jewish princess from Connecticut can handle \"real\" spice. So, when I heard of Dr. Teeth, I knew I was finally going to get my chance to prove how much I can handle.\n\nWhen we got there, we had some Pilsners from the tap. Light beer before wings. Boy was nervous. But Mark, the sweet bartender with the burning man mustache, said the wings were fine - spicy, but tasty. That was enough for me. But then the OTHER bartender (Mack?) was all, \"You guys are insaaaaane!!!\" And then the dude sitting next to me at the bar was all, \"I've never seen anyone do this.\" And then boy was freaking out and wouldn't order because he said he didn't think I could do it and didn't want me to get sick. And then they all (not Mark) started quizzing me about how much spice I can handle: \"Do you eat Thai spice?\" \"Can you eat raw chilis?\" \"Have you ever had habaneros?\" And, finally, boy went to the bathroom and I just ordered the dang wings.\n\nAnd, of course, I was fine. Actually handled the spicy wings a little bit better than boy. Ha. I told him that me and my bro used to sit around the kitchen table with one tablespoon and our stepfather's hot sauce collection playing truth or dare. We decided the wings are a 12-minute spice - after 12 minutes, the heat dissipates. The nice thing is that the pepper takes a minute to kick in, so you can taste the food as well as the spice. We each ate three wings and the Mark took the last 2 back to make them spicier. But they tasted the same to me, although my tongue was prepared. \n\nBoy and I decided that, if 10 is the spiciest thing we would eat for pleasure, then these are a 7. Mark mentioned having them be made more spicy in the future, and I kind of agree with him. If they are going to make you sign a waiver (which they do), that stuff should be insanely hot. I would be down for trying them as an 8.5 or 9. But, all-in-all, great staff, good food, fine beer, great experience. And, if I ever need the upper hand in a conversation, I know where the venue for that should be: over a plate of ghost pepper wings, because I am a ringer.", "author": "Melanie D."}

I had purchased the Living Social deal for two entrees, two bottomless mimosas, and two shots of fernet for $25.  And yet, I would give zero stars if I could.\n\nWe arrived as a group of four.  Once we were seated the waitress took our orders, served us our drinks, and then we honestly never saw her again.\n\nTwo of us had ordered sides of tater tots, and two had ordered sides of home fries.  And yet, they mixed up the order and brought three sides of tater tots and one side of home fries which they REFUSED to replace.  Why?\n\nBecause they RAN OUT OF HOME FRIES.  They literally ran out of potatoes??? What kind of restaurant runs out of food??\n\nOnce the food was set in front of us, they forgot to give us silverware.  We had to wait for TWENTY MINUTES and ask THREE TIMES in order to get the silverware necessary to eat.  So, by the time we finally could eat our food was lukewarm.\n\nIf that wasn't bad enough, after two glasses of mimosas a busboy ran over to inform us that there was no more champagne.  No other option.  No other replacement.  If you wanted other alcohol you had to pay ON TOP of the bottomless mimosas you were already charged for.\n\nBOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS = TWO DRINKS.\n\nWe asked for the check soon after and it literally took an ENTIRE HOUR to pay.  One of the four of us had paid to park, so we were honestly on a time crunch.  We kept flagging people down begging for someone to get our waitress, and finally someone took pity on us and grabbed the bill to settle it.\n\nAfter not seeing her for almost three hours, the waitress came back to say goodbye to us.

We were all very excited to try out \"Bullitt in the Mission\" and despite high expectations Dr Teeth did not disappoint.\n\nThe food = basically Bullitt food aka greasetastic hangover food.  The eggs were good, but the bacon could've been cooked a little crispier, especially since I asked for extra crispy!, but overall the food was solid.  I enjoyed introducing my British friends to the glory of the tater tot, which evidently has not made it across the pond (what a shame).  \n\nEven though we had about 20 people in our party they did a good job bringing out all our food pretty quickly and keeping our drinks flowing pretty well all morning.  I eventually booted in Dolores Park a couple hours later, so I guess you could say the bottomless mimosas were up to task.  \n\nBonus points for:\n- spaciousness\n- interesting decor, although I think they could incorporate the Muppet (and/or actual teeth...there is a weird dental poster in the back, which strangely I can see succeeding) theme even more\n- shuffleboard table\n- vending machine stocked with such gems as 5 hour energy, condoms, cigarettes, etc.", "author": "Molly B."}

With a side of tots, bottomless mimosas, friends, and free shots? It was a good day! \n\nThe service is also something worth talking about. Our waitress was so nice and chatty with us. There was a minute where we did see the bottom of our glasses with no mimosas, but it was probably because she was the only waitress in there and it started to get busy. Maybe that's something they need to work on. But she stayed calm and cool, and she also saw we needed more mimosas so she was quick to just refill our glasses and leave a pitcher on the table. \n\nStill hoping to come back here to try out the rest of the menu as well... like that jelly donut fried chicken sandwich, which sounds like all kinds of delicious. My previous visit to this place was at night, and it was crackin! It turns into a club and plays some awesome music.

The beet and avocado sandwich (spelled 'beat' on the menu--was that supposed to be a Dr. Teeth joke?) was cold, soggy, flavorless...all around inedible. And we are FAR from picky eaters.

But here we go!\n\nI've been here a total of four times and only was served once.  The first time I went was pleasant enough - some day drinking with an old friend I hadn't seen in foreverrrr, so the company was the most important part. We had the tatchos (AMAAAZING) and some fries and some drinks. Most of the time it took an act of congress to get a drink, even though we were at that long table right by the bar. Three stars for those bad ass tatchos!\n\nSo when the Living Social deal came out for brunch and Fernet shots, I was IN like sin. Went once with a group of about 6, and we sat on the patio. We are hungover and NEED brunch and mimosas, STAT. 15 minutes later, after having several waitresses walk by, look at us, and keep walking, I get up and go get menus for the table myself. A waitress immediately notices and comes by asking if we need menus. I thank her and say we have them but water would be great. She brings water.  Another 15-20 go by, with more waitresses walking by, ignoring us, bringing everyone and their mothers drinks and food while we wallow in our no-brunch sadness. WTF is going on here??? We say eff it, and get up to leave. As we are leaving the table, the waitress hurries back and wants to know if she can help us. Oh, now you want to help us. Awesome! Minus one star.\n\nI come back another weekend with a friend hoping to use my deal, but it's packed. The wait is long, so I just say eh, another time, and leave.\n\nLast and final time, its two days before the deal expires, so I like, NEED to use this bad boy. Get there before my friend, try to put my name in. It's packed, and I ask the guy how long. He said he doesn't know, at least an hour, maybe an hour and a half. I said I have my deal and it's only good till 2, and it's 12:30, so would it still be valid if the wait is an hour and a half? He rolls his eyes and says he doesn't know. Um, ok, well, can you find out? Then he gets testy and says he just doesn't know, he can't give me an answer, and I'm just going to have to risk it or come back another day. I said the deal expires in a couple of days and today is Sunday, so I pretty much can't come back. Not his problem, he says. Um, what? Again, WTF is going on here? I just want to use my freakin deal here people! He gives me some more BS about the wait and if my deal will be valid by the time I sit down, so again I say EFF IT and leave.

The drinks were way over-priced, and it was crowded, but that was to be expected on a weekend in the Mission.  But then this movie that they had been playing in the background went from stupid 80's sexual to abusively \"erotic\".  I'm all for sexual freedom (and I get that it's San Francisco and there is bound to be a lot of it) but not when it involves captive naked women forced to fight each other in a ring while men watch and place bets while being aroused. At that point it is no longer sexual freedom but sexually demeaning.  It was the human equivalent of a dog fight which most people would consider cruel and demoralizing. Yet, when people were being treated in a way we wouldn't even treat animals they were drunkenly cheering it on! The atmosphere of the bar instantly felt more aggressive and unsafe. I grew increasingly aware of how wasted everyone was and how many girls were either nearly passed out or as uncomfortable as I was.  I could no longer enjoy myself (and I could no longer hear myself over the shouting) even though I was with friends. \n\nThis was a couple of weekends ago and I have regretted not saying something sooner.

I was turned on by the name and my friends rave reviews.  Next door to Cha Cha Cha, this is a fun and funky place for an after work snack and beer.  Happy Hour EVERY NIGHT, great menu-Truffle Tater Tots are no joke and the Death Wings will make you wish you had a gallon of milk to stop the burning.  \n\nFriendly staff, great selection of yummy food, quick service with a smile.

That's right, a whole plate of tasty, flavorful, juicy, tender, and succulent chicken wings for just two dollars! It doesn't sound possible but Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem has made it possible! This bar, located in the heart of Mission, is generally packed with friendly locals. The inside dining/drinking area is very crowded and seats are scarce even on the weekdays but the outdoor patio in the back usually has some vacancies. The Bartenders are extremely friendly. There is pretty much a full bar at this location and the bartenders are able to whip up pretty much anything you ask for. There is a decent selection of beer whether if you want it by tap, bottle, or can. The prices for drinks are very reasonable so having a few extra drinks with the wings won't hurt your wallet. There is a new special every day of the week besides Saturday and Sunday.\n\nOther Specials:\nSundays - Buy a Shot, Get a Pony! (I haven't tried this yet, please post below if you know what it is)\nMondays - Burger and Beer for $10\nTuesdays - Trivia at 8PM (play trivia in a team, win prizes)\nWednesdays - Wings for 25\u00a2\nThursday - $2 Tacos, 2 for 1 Margaritas\n\nSource: http://wp.me/p2I7CM-1F", "author": "Damon F."}

You walk in and you're supposed to seat yourself, but there is nothing telling you to do so, there is a sign in sheet, but no one reads it, there is seating in back but no sign telling you so, so in the 5 minutes it takes you to gleen this information, the 3 couples that just came in behind you, took the last 3 available seats. There was an incredibly long wait for service, and for our food, and the noise level was way too high. I think it is understaffed? The decor was interesting, like a post-modern, da da, Bauhaus thing going on, like Thierry Guetta was the decorator.  The food was ok, not very hot though, and after several servers were asked, there apparently are no salt shakers in the restaurant. the Tot-chos (tater-tot nachos) were the redeemer here, very tasty and different.

We sat down at the only table that was available, which hadn't been wiped down yet. The check was still sitting there from the previous customers and there were crumbs all over it, understandable because they were pretty busy. The waitress came over, greeted us, and grabbed the check. She told us she would be right back with menus. Ten minutes went by and we started looking up the menu on our phones, because we were starting to get hungry and we thought we would be ready by the time she comes back. She finally came up to us with one less menu than was necessary, still hadn't wiped down our messy table, and explained that they were super busy. I could see that and gave her the benefit of the doubt. We ordered things like Eggs Benedict and tatchoes, things that don't take too long to make, and some coffees. She left and was totally absent for at least a half hour. By this time it had been about 45 minutes since we sat down and we hadn't even gotten waters. I had to take napkins off the table sitting next to us and wipe down our area myself. I eventually started to get worried that we had been forgotten and flagged another server down. I explained to him how long we had been waiting and that we didn't have our drinks or even our waters. I told him the description of our waitress and he apologized and came right back with waters, silverware, and napkins. Our waitress soon arrived with our coffees and put them down with a silent sneer on her face. I guess she was mad that we had said something. I work in the food industry and know about customer service. If your customers aren't happy you should apologize, explain the situation, and then make it up to them. Instead, she treated us like we were being a hinderance to her day. Eventually one of us got his food and ate the whole thing before we realized that none of us had a dish yet. We waited another 10 minutes before asking where the rest of our food was. I guess he had been given someone else's dish from another table and that he was getting another one. I still hadn't gotten my food and was starting to get hangry. By the time I got my lukewarm tater tot nachoes we had been sitting there for an hour and 20 minutes. \n\nI was pretty upset about it and hope that they learn how to be more efficient with their tables.\n\nBy the way. \nI still tipped, because I'm in the food industry and know how it feels.", "author": "Kate M."}

After another 20 minutes of waiting around, our order was taken. After another 15 minutes drinks hadn't been brought it yet, so my friend went to the counter to request our cups of mimosas/water and brought them back himself. We waited an hour for our food to come out (grabbed some bags of chips at the hot dog cart outside on the sidewalk about 45min into the wait). It finally came out and one order had been forgotten. We decided to cancel it, and they gave us a round of shots as an apology, which was nice. The food was ok (my omelette was lukewarm), but absolutely not worth such a long wait.

They're the exact ones you were served in your Middle School cafeteria. Nostalgic in the best way!\nThe service was pretty good. Minus one star because our server seemed annoyed that she had to come back 3 times before we were ready to order. My boyfriend and I are both servers and in our opinion it's common courtesy to allow guests to take as much time as they need to decide on their meals without any eye-rolling. By the third time she came (with very short periods of time between each check in), we felt we needed to order just so she wouldn't become more irritated with us. Other than this one little hiccup, we had a fantastic brunch. Our server even warmed up over the course of the meal and became much friendlier, so maybe she was just a little cranky being at work at 10:30am on a Sunday. Aren't we all.\nThis place is really creatively decorated, the menu is inventive and fun, and the vibe is nice and laid back. I hear their burgers are great too. We'll definitely be back.", "author": "Tanya K."}

I was going to a show at the chapel and it was closeby so I gave it a try. It's seat yourself, so make sure you get there early if you're hungry. It is, in my opinion, a bar that happens to have good food, as opposed to a restaurant with good drinks.. I hope that makes sense. We didn't get any drinks, (under 21) but the food was pretty good in my opinion. The burger was okay- but the tots were pretty special! I got the buffalo blue tots and I thought they were outstanding. I've been seeing people complain in other reviews about the service. But it's really not bad.", "author": "Angelo C."}

All really tasty!\n\nWe ordered the fried chicken sandwich with sweet habanero sauce - the right amount of heat balanced with sweet and a blue cheese bacon burger. For the sides, tot-chos (tater tot nachos- YUM!) and a salad. Believe the hype, these taters are da bomb!\n\nAlso, our waitress was incredibly friendly and provided wonderful service.

Tater tots were yummy, fries were good and I got a grilled cheese sandwhich with egg, crab and chicken strips. I paid $3 to get ONE lean chicken strip on my grilled cheese overall, which was dumb. Food is good, but I wouldn't agree with bars charging $10 for such simple meals. It also seemed like the waitress was pressuring me to submit an order and it was annoying.

My crab omelet was full of crab and for that I was happy. BUT my husband and sister got the Mission scramble and it was comical how terrible it was. The home fries were sooooo hard and his scramble looked like something leftover for a doggie bag.

The classic burger and the Reuben were pretty tasty, but I would only give the meatball a try one another time to see if they improve the marinara a bit. I'd ditch the veggie burger and the BLT altogether. I'd say that the BLT wasn't too shabby, but in it's place I could put more of something I love, so there you go. The veggie burger was in my opinion, inedible, so that says it there. \nLet's talk tater tots. Oh wow, my stomach just growled. They were awesome! We ordered the chili-cheese tots as they were the night's special, and we were not disappointed. This was enough food for three, easily, so split between two we actually had surplus tots and sliders. Worse things have been dragged home with me after a night out in the Mission, I'll be honest. \nThe fifth star was in order as the waitstaff were ON IT.

I was inspired to write this review tonight because I have been feeling particularly sentimental toward anyone who treats me like a human being lately.\n\nI am originally a Midwesterner and world traveller since I was a child. I am not naive to large cities, but where I am from everyone--EVERYONE, gives you a \"Hi, how the heck are ya?\" every time you interact. I miss that.\n\nA few days after I first moved here from the Midwest, I tried to help a dying homeless man and was tapped on the shoulder to be told that I shouldn't \"mind him--he's just looking for attention.\" The man died. Being in the big city for over a year now, I could walk over that man without a second thought. I am not proud of that and have been regaining consciousness lately.\n\nDr. Teeth is an above average bar with an above average menu and patrons. There is nothing particularly out of the ordinary (San Francisco-wise) about this place.\n\nBUT.\n\nThe bartenders here are like no one else in the city. They talk to you like a bartender should. Not just a \"what do you want? Here it is, give me money.\" They are outgoing, fun and not to mention easy on the eyes ;).\n\nNatalie and Mack go out of their way to make sure you are well watered and comfortable. They are my HANDS DOWN favorite bartenders in the city. (and I'm quite the bar patron)\n\nIf you want some actual hospitality, come here.", "author": "P P."}

It's a huge space but I feel it needs a little bit more uniqueness (my girlfriend would agree). YES, it draws both hipster missionites and \"others\", and YES, it plays a variation of contemporary-yet average-mainstream music (which by the way,  seemed to sound a little repressed in volume), BUT not tied-in with a rockish bar  and lights set-up that is muppetesque in distinctness and appeal, then this bar is only as good as it's weakest feature...Mind you the drinks are good (try the blackberry fizz) and the pour...GENEROUS. Foodwise - well, it's typical bar food but definitely needs SALT, especially in the mac n cheese. Final suggestion: Pump up the volume in all levels.", "author": "Claude C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-06-11", "description": "We went to Dr. Teeth after seeing a Groupon a few months ago...and were excited to try this new spot. However, when we got there for the Groupon offer, they told us it was only valid after 3pm and not during brunch - even though it said nothing like that on the Groupon or in the fine print. The manager indicated they changed their menu after the Groupon was issued. I felt like the restaurant was taking advantage of people as at least 3-4 other couples came in around the same time and experienced the same thing. So it seemed like a way to get people to come into the restaurant twice under the guise of a Groupon. We stayed and the food was actually not that great anyway. I will never return.", "author": "Eric W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-04-02", "description": "Disclaimer: neither my friends nor I are hipsters, so if you want to know about the \"hipster vibe\", you should read a different review. This is just about food and service.\n\nWe had the Groupon for 6: 6 beers, 3 baskets of tater tots and 30 sliders. That was a lot of food for 6. I guess that's the good news, cuz it wasn't a lot of money ($86.85 retail value, according to them). The other good news: the sweet potato tater tots and truffle tater tots were good. The sliders were variable: BLT - good; classic slider - horrible, a dried-up disk completely unidentifiable as beef; meatball - tasty enough, but with virtually NO sauce; I didn't have the Reuben, but one of my friends ate quite a few, so I think that means they're good.\n\nThe (other) bad news: VERY inattentive service. I had to try to shout over the music to get our waitress's attention, cuz she never stopped by, and it wasn't busy. Took *forever* to get the drink refills and water (she had to be reminded about the water). Also all sorts of weird rules: you have to order sliders in batches of 10 (can't order 12, like 2 per person, say) and each time you order, you have to order at least two of any kind you want. And I woke up at 3am with a really bad stomachache; not sure what to attribute that to.\n\nAnd oops, most of our gang didn't want beer, so we supposedly got our first soft drinks for free instead. One person had a cocktail (which he said was good). Only two of us had a 2nd soft drink, and the waitress made a big deal about having tried to verbally order some of our drinks so they wouldn't end up on our tab. But somehow the drinks bill came to $16? Just how expensive was that cocktail anyway? The waitress brought the bill in two pieces: tax on the Groupon deal ($4.61) plus the drinks ($16). So the final bill should have been $20.61, right? But no, it was $22.23. I didn't want to wait another however-many minutes or hours for her to come back and she's already told me she can't do math, so we just paid. It's probably something like tax on the drinks, but that should have been in the total before she brought the bill.", "author": "J T."}

Anyways, I went on a Thursday Night and it was pretty packed. You seat yourself so thank god my friend and I were able to find a table. We flagged down a waitress who was very prompt, friendly and helpful. She checked up on us about three times to make sure everything was going ok and to see if we needed anything. She answered all my questions about happy hour here. They moved 2 for 1 margaritas and $2 tacos to Tuesdays and they still have $.25 wings on Wednesdays (which I will check out). There is a lot of food to choose from on the menu at very affordable prices. I bought a burger with fries and a margarita for $21 bucks... And their plates aren't sparse and they pour with a heavy hand. You really get your money's worth here.\n\nOverall, I'm really impressed with this place. I love the lively atmosphere, the great service, food and prices. I will definitely be coming back to check out their happy hours and try out other foods on the menu.

True - the lighting is kinda low (as was noted in a previous review), but it IS a bar, that happens to serve good bar food. At least, I felt that it was more that than a traditional restaurant. It was like a high-end version of a place like Buckshot Grill in the Inner Richmond, but rather than more rock n roll vibe, it was sort of a Mission mishmash. The food is friggin' GREAT - and if you get one of the Tots plates, you had better bring another person with a giant appetite - they don't mess around at Dr. Teeth's on the portions! The drinks were good and strong, and not obnoxiously priced - they have a happy hour that starts later in the evening (around 10pm methinks), and the staff I met were super friendly, really helpful, nice folks. I'll definitely be going back...especially once they really expand their intriguing menu.", "author": "Marco M."}

They need a ventilation system (a/c, fan, exhaust, etc....). Otherwise, it was a blast going back in time and being around those crazy 20 to 30 somethings for a few hours.
