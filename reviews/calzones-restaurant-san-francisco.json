We started off with the garlic bread, but I wish i could have had 5 more pieces, it was incredible! The bread was toasted perfectly so it was crisp but still soft. The garlic flavor along with the herbs was spectacular, and there was also some red chili on it, which added a nice little kick. My husband ordered the lasagna calzone and thought it was delicious. I ordered the bbq chicken calzone and loved it!! The roasted peppers added a nice sweetness. \n\nThe staff was very kind and professional, and our water glasses were never empty.

I try to avoid places like these but it was late and we were getting hungry and they had availability so we were suckered right on in.\n\nThis place is like an amusement park. You get lost in the shuffle almost. It's two stories and decorated with walls and walls of all things italian and packaged, and it gets magnified and expanded through their use of odd mirrors placed in odd locations. It was more fun to be here than I originally expected, felt like a wide-eyed tourist in my own neighborhood!\n\nCan't attest for their pizzas but I can say they have an incredible operation going--the service was speedy! Normally pizzas and calzones take a hefty amount of time to prep and bake, but I felt like my BBQ chicken calzone came to me in less than 10 minutes. Miraculous!\n\nThe BBQ chicken calzone was delicious! This is definitely meant to be shared as I don't think I could down that much gluten in one sitting. They might share the same owner as the Stinking Rose because we sat up top and there were neon signs with Stinking Rose references.\n\nI learned my lesson.

I drove by this place and instantly got my attention the exterior table set up. I parked about two blocks from the restaurant (yes San Francisco parking is a headache) and walked to the restaurant. When I arrived all the exterior tables were occupied and I asked the front desk person how long was the waiting, she said 20-25 min. I decided to wait since I really wanted to eat outside. While waiting I went to use the restroom (all gender) and as soon as I got back to the bar to wait for my table, the sever contacted me to let me know my table was ready, was really fast and I was glad. \n\nObserving the menu I realized they have a decent options when it comes to pasta, ravioles and pizza. Without mentioned that drinks menu was not bad at all either. After exploring the options I ordered a glass of Chardonnay, raviolis with mushrooms and some bread. Over all bread was really good, ravioles had a very good taste and wine was delicious. I personally find it interesting stay outside the restaurant observing the people walking and the style makes you feel like you're in Europe, although in reality you're in the fog city. \n\nI recommend this place to people who likes to eat outside the box and feel comfortable eating next to strangers. That's the only reason why I'm giving 4 starts, the tables can be a little more separated from each other.", "author": "Issac R."}

We have long admired this place from afar; it has a very slick sign out front.

We were all interested in pizza and asked if three of us could share one, as they were priced at $19. He replied quite haughtily that all the pizzas were personal pizzas, which turned out to be false. We ordered two and took the equivalent of one back to our hotel. \n\nBy comparison, if we have a coupon we can get a family-size Papa Murphy's pizza for $12, and that feeds six. Calzone's pizza was ok, but not that much better than a take-and-bake, and we resented the absence of grated cheese. We had to ask for it. \n\nWe asked about bread then ordered garlic bread in lieu of a complementary loaf. Our server brought both. \n\nA Caesar salad was served with very bitter greens that left an acrid aftertaste. We appreciate the restaurant deducting it from our bill, but we won't be back. \n\nThere are some outstanding restaurants in North Beach. This isn't one of them.

Last week after a concert at Bill Grahm we were looking for a nice spot to eat dinner.  And as always I pulled up the Yelp App and I searched for a place that looked yummy and opened late.  We choose this place because it closed at 1 am and it was only 11:45 pm. I always hate showing up to places 20 minutes before closing so this was the perfect opportunity to check out Calzone's. \n\nWhen we arrived we walked inside and stood by the host area and no one acknowledged us. The bartender just stared at us. I was really confused that I even pulled up my phone to double check if the place was about to close. Finally, after about 8 minutes standing around the host sat us down outside and gave us the menu. We looked over the menu and then waited another 20 minutes for someone to come take our order and drinks. It was really strange because the server walked past us about 3 times. At this point, its like 12:30am and they finally take our order. The food came out a lot quicker than I was expecting. \n\nWe ordered the garlic bread and the Lasagna Calzone which were both very delicious. The Calzones are a perfect to share with another person. The only downside was that the food got cold pretty fast since we were sitting outside. I also liked how they provide you with a refill on the side for your soda.

Located on Columbus Ave in North Beach, Calzone's is one of those places that looks like it has been around forever and really embodies the spirit of the Italian neighborhood. Unfortunately, the food just didn't knock it out of the park for me.\n\nSince it was my first time here and the place is named Calzone's, I figured that I should get a calzone. The menu item that the restaurant is named after should definitely be the best, right? I got the roasted melanzana calzone, which contains eggplant, spinach, bell peppers and cheese. When the long and skinny calzone came out, I was excited to dig in. It was fine. Nothing amazing. The crust itself didn't taste that fresh, which I think I think took away from the overall meal. There was also no marinara sauce provided for dipping, which I personally think is a must for calzones.\n\nMaybe Calzone's has something better on their menu than calzones, but I'm in no rush to return.

We didn't even ask for refund, but he was so defensive that he didn't even apologize, offer my guest a new piece of lasagna, anything. It was handled so poorly. When he brought the bill he continued to talk and be defensive about how apparently this was our fault, the wind blew it in and I asked him to just leave us alone and that he obviously wasn't going to handle it the way a professional would. I think he ruined our experience as much as finding the hair.  We put out a credit card, he rang it up, and brought it back for signing. At this point we just want the hell out of there.  We noticed he had taken the cost of the lasagna off of the bill but said nothing to us. I was so disappointed and embarrassed for my out-of-town guests.  So he made it right in the end you could say but I felt as if he was calling us liars.  Never again will we be back.", "author": "Linda W."}

He was very helpful and accommodating when it came to making a reservation (for 12-19 people) and selecting the food items.  \n\nWhen we arrived, we were promptly seated in the mezzanine which was designed for large groups.  The restaurant have a very cool and eclectic feel to it.  I liked the outside seating area for those small groups that wanted to hang out and people watch.  Sergio and the team quickly took our drink orders.  An interesting touch was that they automatically brought out extra portions of each person's drink.  I guess that way, they wouldn't have to keep coming up to refill them.  \n\nThe food came out very quickly to our surprise; the kitchen must be running on steroids or speed for the food to come out that quickly!  We ordered calamari, house salad, margherita pizza, pepperoni pizza, combo pizza, chicken alfredo, and steak scaloppini.  Everything was delicious and prepared as expected.  We also ordered a single piece of tiramisu with a candle on it so that the girls could sing to my daughter.

I ordered a salad and discovered an 3 inch piece of tree twig in my salad. After letting our waiter know, the waiter and manager both tried to convince me that the twig was actually part of the salad...\n\nso uh no, no thanks. No more future visits for me to Calzone's!\n\nFast Forward to Summer 2015, I am back here again for a dinner date. Aside from the complimentary bread, we ordered the Caesar salad, house-made ravioli and the shellfish cappellini.\n\ncouple notes:\n*Caesar salad was a pass for me. Bland taste and I dislike the uncut appearance of the baby romaine. \n*House-made ravioli sauce had great flavor. Sadly the ravioli was not cooked long enough, it could have used another minute to boil. I still enjoyed it though.\n*Date loved the shellfish cappellini.\n* Bread was not exciting. Lukewarm and kind of tough to chew on.\n\nThe service and outdoor seating area is what separates this place from the other Italian joints in North Beach. The food here is adequate for me, but I probably should have tried the calzone or the pizza since those dishes are actually in the restaurant's title. If you want a great people-watching spot with average food, Calzone's will serve your purpose. You want authentic italian food?

Maybe It's because I've lived in the bay area for 30 years and in San Francisco for 20 of that is why I can squeeze the finest nectar from my town. Yes, that must be it. \nAs I sit like a king, reinging over my oblong plates of delicious subjects, some are calamary some are garlic fries some are arugala based indentured servants. \nI judge and sentence all of them to gastronomnomia. I've heard the garlic fries described as \"too garlicy\". I had to look that up, \"having too much of the flavor of garlic\". So I had to look that up. I still don't understand... \nSo I sit in my royal robes amid the little people that also come to enjoy Calzones offering surrounded by the classic and historic black and white mosaic decor and sentence each morsel within the Cathedrawl of delite which is Calzones. Unless it's one of those days or evenings when the sidewalk seating is more enjoyable. Either because It's warm and lightly breezy or because It's cool out and I seek the warmth of the heat lamps outside. Either way I'm greeted with a smile, seated quickly waited on, served and satisfied each and every time. The only thing I wouldn't recommend would be the decafe coffee, but you're in Northbeach in San Francisco!! and my tastebuds are trained for something freshly ground and laced with freshly made whipping cream. I don't ask or expect Calzones to provide that for me. I go elsewhere, to a place specifically focused on providing the same excellence  in speciality coffees as Calzone's provides in specialty foods.\n\n\"Too garlicy.\" I still chuckle.", "author": "Brian M."}

We sat outside which was cool assuming you don't mind all the foot traffic going by. My girlfriend ordered a salad with chicken and I ordered a calzone. Just so you know they do give you lots of chicken with your salad. In matter of fact they pile it on so high you can't even see your salad. Keep in mind the chicken is straight out of the refrigerator. My calzone wasn't so bad but it comes dry so make sure you ask for some marinara sauce or something. Calzones do provide you with complimentary bread until your meal comes. Be prepared to get a 1/2 a stick of butter still in the wrapper (again straight out of the refrigerator) if you ask for butter. Ask them to warm it up so you can actually use it. I wasn't impressed overall. Not sure I'd go back. I hope you have a better experience.", "author": "Brian W."}

Lots of two seat tables outside so you can watch all the traffic on Columbus but we decided inside. Inside the walls are covered like and Italian kitchen pantry. Very cool. \n\nI was looking for something different. I've always had pizza, calzone, and pasta. So today I ordered the vegetable sandwich which had artichoke heart, egg plant, mushrooms, and tomato with melted cheese on a toasted baguette. Really good. Just bursting with flavor. On the side were roasted carrots. Never had carrots prepared this was. Sweet and good. Downed them really fast. My wife and daughters shared a roasted chicken with artichoke heart calzone. I tried a little but of it and it was okay, but my wife and daughter really liked it a lot. Both gobbled it up really fast. My son ordered the homemade ravioli and he really enjoyed it. Inhaled it.   \n\nThe service was downright outstanding. Water cups filled on a regular basis even before the cups were only half full. Finished dishes were taken away promptly. \n\nEven though the food was a little pricy, it was really good.

I normally like to plan things out and have a place in mind before we leave my office, but today I decided to \"just go with it.\"  And it came back to bite me in the gluteus maximus.\n\nWe knew that we wanted to stop by St. Francis to talk and pray, so I suggested that we just saunter up Columbus Ave. and explore the North Beach/Telegraph Hill area.  I ended up getting overwhelmed by all of the Asian restaurants that lined the left side of the street, and all of the little cafes and Italian, Greek, Fusion-y restaurants on my right.  By the time we hit Broadway, I Yelped.\n\nWe walked down Broadway to E'Tutto Qua... closed til 5.\nLooked across the street and walked into Naked Lunch... eh, not really feeling the atmosphere (more of a post-work hangout to us). \nHeaded back to Columbus and peeped into Giordano Bros... realized we definitely didn't want sandwiches.\nWhat about that Greek place back across the street (Estia)?  Looked and saw an iron grill over the door even though it said open at 11.  Eek!\n\nMy thoughtful friend knew I was getting hangry at myself so he reassured me that it was alright, and that we'd walk just a bit further up and pick a nice place with outdoor seating.  And we did just that, planting ourselves down at a table for two in front of Calzone's.  \n\nHO-LY HEAT LAMPS!!\n\nMy goodness.  We both had to take out thick jackets off before sitting down.  It was a chilly, slightly windy 62, but we sat out there like it was almost in the 80s.  My bf asked the waiter if he could maybe turn it down, but apparently it's just ON or OFF, HOT or NOT. \n\nMy friend picked the pizza (margherita - san marzano tomatoes, garlic, fresh basil & mozzarella - 14.95) and I chose the salad (fuji apples - sun dried cranberries, candied walnuts & rocket arugula in raspberry vinaigrette - 9.95).  The waiter took our drink orders (just water) and after bringing out the water, brought us some bread.\n\nAbout ten minutes later our food came out and it looked so, SO good.  I normally don't like thin crust pizzas, but today I wasn't really in the mood for a heavy, food-coma inducing lunch, so the thin crust worked out very nicely.  I'm also not really much of a veggie person, but the salad was GREAT!  Thin slices of tart fuji apples, sweet cranberries and raspberry vinaigrette, chunky walnuts... mmm.  Balanced out the slightly bitter taste of the arugula.  I'm excited to try to recreate this at home.  That was a lie.  Who am I kidding?  I'll just come back here!\n\nThere's not much of a \"view,\" unless you're into, y'know, streets... but it made for great people watching.  \n\nService was prompt and very attentive (refilling water, checking in to see how the food was, getting our plates cleared, bringing the check).  \n\nAll in all, it was a lovely spot for a lunch spot.

If you are coming for a Mediterranean atmosphere while you eat, don't come here. Come here if you would like 1980s music to accompany your \"Italian\" food. \nSecond, the food is lacking flavor and authenticity. If you would like Jalape\u00f1os in your \"Italian\" food, you have come to the right place. The food is bland and tasteless, but comes at the price of gourmet entrees. Our group tasted the Eggplant Calzone and Mushroom Pizza. Both suffered from a unfortunate choice of flavorless cheese and could not be rescued by the toppings. To add interest, there was a change in texture with the doughy pizza crust that seemed uncooked. The complimentary bread was stale and cold. \nThird and last, we experienced subpar customer service. First, our waiter did not introduce herself. In fact, we did not have a single consistent waiter during the entire meal. The waiters spilled water on the table and splattered us each time they served our drinks. Perhaps this was due to an imperfect choice of pitchers or too much distance between the pitcher and cup, but the results were the same. When it was time to go, our requests to split the check were met with disgusted waves and wordless glares. This, we will not be returning to Calzone's and hope you won't either!", "author": "Laurenz R."}

Great food, good service, and I never stood in line to wait to get seated. I always order their Mojito because it comes with a real sugar cane stick. I dine here on Halloween nights, not because they have a night life party, but because I get to sit down outdoor, eat and watch people pass by in costumes; while I have my wine and crab pizza.

The ambiance was lively, and pretty good for some good conversation with old friends.\n\nThe waiter was very prompt with our initial drink order, but was a bit slow with our food and refilling drinks afterwards. However, once the food actually did come out, we were not disappointed. We ordered a few orders of garlic fries (slightly odd dish at an Italian restaurant), and they were awesome. Pretty strong garlic taste (you'll need mints after) and super crispy texture. However, I would stay away from the garlic bread, since it's the same thing as the free bread they give you, just with a little more garlic and olive oil, and you only get 4 small pieces. Don't know why they're such misers about the bread.\n\nI ordered the combo pizza, which had a variety of meats on top. It was a bit on the soggy side, but still tasted pretty good and was a decent sized pie. I was also able to try the original calzone, which didn't impress me as much since it was too dry, which was disappointing, given the name of the restaurant. C'mon, son.\n\nRegardless, I had a good time here, but given the number of Italian restaurants in the area, I probably won't be back.", "author": "Eric J."}

That way or the other I was extremely disappointed with my last visit here which is probably the last one.\nNext time I will stand as much as needed in the line for Tonny pizza, or chose one of the many other excellent restaurants around. The sidewalk seating does not worth it that much.\nWe waited for someone to take our drinks order way too long while sitting in the sun, we were not served the bread they usually serve as you sit down and when we finally got it, it was after we were served our entries. The bread was served without butter (they used to serve butter with it). \nI looked at the table next to us and saw they were served a half stick of butter in its original paper cover as you buy it from the grocery store - very bizarre, so I gave up asking for butter. \nThe man server insisted to speak fluent Spanish with us although we kept staring at him, telling him we have no idea what he says. I don't care he thought we're Spanish, but it should have been enough when we told him once, yet he kept speaking Spanish and only at the third time we told him angrily we have no idea what he says he switched to English.\nMy daughter ordered fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and her dish tasted nothing but disgusting! It tasted as if the chicken was spoiled!I did not finish my salad after finding a piece of plastic in it. They took it off the bill but still -yucky! I believe it came from the cover of the bacon they cut into the salad.\nThe woman server who took my salad order saw it necessary to tell me TWICE: you know Panchetta  (one of the salad ingredients) is bacon! I told her yes I know, but she repeated it slowly as if she's talking to a difficult child: panchetta is bacon you know?\n(Did I look to her like I'm in a need of a diet? Did I ask what panchetta is? Do you call me fat?!?) I ate panchetta when this server was yet in her diapers. A real panchetta. In Italy.\nI said again very slow: yes I know... But it's a good idea to leave it out of the plate since I'm trying to save calories. (Do you call me fat?!?)\nNot only the panchetta...ahm...

I get the Calamari on every visit because it's good and comes in a huge portion so I can share it with the table. The batter has a nice savory flavor and flakes off so you can tell it's very fresh. You even get some fried veggies with it. The Steak Salad was just spinach with a side of steak. It was light and flavorful and the perfect plate to share on a warm day but it was a bit plain. I usually get their low carb Mixed Grill plate and my friends love their Lasagna Calzone while Steve always gets their Grilled Salmon. The calzones are a bit heavy for a lunch meal but it's large enough to eat and save for later. The Mixed Grill has a good portion of Salmon, Shrimp and Scallops with Cauliflower. It's a healthy option compared to the pastas though the pastas are delish. They used to have an Asparagus Salmon Orzo that I loved but it's no longer available. Bring it back!!!

This was so good it was my favorite dish I almost didnt want to share!! Lol the chicken was done perfect. Not overcooked and the asparagus wasnt mushy and overcooked either. I think this is one of the main reasons I liked it so much,  because I always have bad experiences with other places that tend to overcook their foods so it just becomes one big mush.\n\nAlthough this place is a little small and crowded, the food and cute decor make up for its size! :)", "author": "Kathy H."}

Obviously, a place named after the very thing I craved must be good, right?\n\nWrong. Not only did I spent almost $70 for a calzone, two salads, and two beers (plus extra charge for marinara... Which is absurd at an \"Italian restaurant\"). But, I also got to spend a good amount of time that night in the bathroom. \n\nListen, I'm not some kind of Italian food elitist. All I was looking for was fresh ingredients, reasonable prices, and a drink. This place is a tourist trap (it MUST be), unless $18 calzones that give you diarrhea is what you're into. \n\nAnd what's with the bread with no butter or fresh olive oil/seasoning? This is some basic stuff here... Very disappointed.", "author": "Robert B."}

The margarita pizza was light and crispy, it was good as well. The chicken calzone lacked some flavor. Over all I would come back for the pasta. I do not recommend the mixed drinks. The cucumber cooler was not tolerable it had a strange taste to it, as did the sangria had a perfume type flavor. Next time I will just stick with the water.

In the heart of NB, we've passed this place hundreds of times, its neon sign is eye catching. We decided to need some visiting friends there to give it a try. Maybe our expectations were low because we thought it would be touristy, but it was fantastic. Crab fettucine with scallop sauce was terrific, perfectly cooked fettucine noodles and plentiful crab. My wife and I shared that and the crab & spinach toast. This was also delicious but very rich. It's a good appetizer if cut and shared between several people.  I wanted to try a meatball, which is my gauge of an Italian restaurant. The waiter said they didn't offer a side. So we pulled a Five Easy Pieces move a la Jack Nicholson and ordered a meatball sandwich, hold the bread and hold the potatoes.  We received an entree sized order of smallish meatballs. They were quite good, not mama's but very good nonetheless. The decor is charming, the walls are lined with packages that I recognized from my nonna's pantry.  \nAnother friend had the mussels and judging by her eyes rolling back in her head, I venture to guess they were very good. The service was outstanding as well. Our server Rigo was terrific. We'll be back and bring friends for sure.", "author": "Dar V."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-28", "description": "This s a great North Beach restaurant and a lot of fun to go to. It does get busy, so if you want to have a quiet romantic dinner, this place may not be for you. The best thing I suggest is to get there in the late afternoon. At this time there is always available tables. Overall, the food and the drinks are all fun and it is a great place to watch the San Francisco masses, (tourist and otherwise), pass-by.\n\nTo get into more detail, parking for this restaurant can be a bit of a pain. As we all understand, trying to find a parking space in North Beach can be a problem. So, if you are planning to eat at Calzone's that is the first thing to think about. If you live within walking distant or travel by taxi or something like that, eating here may become a much easier experience. \n\nOnce you are here it is essential to know that Calzone's has multiple floors. So, just because it looks totally full downstairs that does not mean that you should not ask about a table as they may have one upstairs. \n\nIt is important to note that the tables at Calzone's are fairly close to one another. So, if you hope for that old-school private dining experience this place may not be for you. It is not that they are too close together, it is just that your dining experience is not going to be all that private.\n\nThe atmosphere of this restaurant is generally crowded and noisy. This is particularly the case during the main dining hours. \n\nIn the downstairs portion they have full length windows that they commonly leave open when it is not too cold or rainy. And, you can, of course, eat outside on the sidewalk. A lot of people like this but for me North Beach is just too crowded with the walking masses who can really interrupt your meal, especially when the dirty homeless people come by asking for money. But, that's just me...\n\nIn term of upstairs dining, you don't have the large windows looking out to the street but it is nicely designed and well ventilated. So, it also a good place to eat. \n\nThe staff is generally really good. Even when it is busy they watch over their tables and take care of their customers. \n\nIn terms of food, most of it is really good. But, some of it may not be for everyone. For example, you can't go wrong with their pizzas, salads, or sandwiches. They are all individual meal size and a long as you know which one you want you are all-good. The pastas and the calzones are also good but, from my experience, you need to be careful which one you order if you don't like certain things. As an example, I ordered the roasted chicken calzone one time and inside it has all this cottage cheese stuff. I am sure some people like this, but to me it is just weird. So, know what you are ordering and if you have any questions ask your server.\n\nOverall, this restaurant is filled with the local and the tourist crowd, with emphasis on the ladder. As there are locals, and everyone known there can be some weird birds in and around North Beach, you occasionally find one of them inside Calzone's. The only time I refused to accept the table they tried to sit me at was when the hostess tried to put us in a tight corner right next to a table where a guy had one of his hands in his pants, if you know what I am talking about. So, just be prepared, you may encounter a weird customer as you are in North Beach. But, most customers are normal, nice, and are just there to have a good meal. \n\nOverall, good place to go. I eat at this restaurant quite frequently.", "author": "Scott S."}

Nice street view, and it looks pretty cool inside. ) \n\nA group of us were walking around in Little Italy and saw this place. It looked really interesting! We were craving pizza. We asked the hostess if they serve it here, and she said yes. So we decided to eat here. Our waiter was nice, and the customer service was pretty good too!\n\nBut, our food.\n\nWe thought since it's an Italian restaurant, it must have really good pizza! When we asked the waiter about their pizza sizes, he told us that their pizzas were squared and really small. We changed our minds because those pizzas were almost $17 each for such small sizes. So we decided to get regular dishes. \nWe got bread before our entrees, but it was hard to eat, and it didn't taste fresh.\nSome of the guys I was with were pretty hungry. They ordered sandwiches, and they couldn't finish them because those sandwiches were too dry. Too much bread, and barely any sauce.\nI ordered the Chicken and Asparagus Fettucine. It had no taste, no salt, no pepper, no seasonings. It literally had no sauce on it, so it was really dry! It tasted like pure water. Also, when I got this dish, it was getting kinda cold. The chicken tasted a few days old as well. This dish was $18. . . :/\n\nI was expecting this place to be 10 times better than Olive Garden, but Olive Garden is 10 times better then this place. I've made Italian dishes at home, and they tasted better then the dishes we ate here, seriously! Everyone at my table said that their food had no taste to it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-08-11", "description": "There are a plethora of Italian restaurants in North Beach/Russian Hill.  Some are authentic (or claim to be as \"Our chef is from Sicily\" proclaimed one restaurant hawker), some are trendy (to see and be seen), and some are crowded.  I found that most were terribly overpriced, and according to my wallet,  Calzone's is in the same category.\n\nSomebody has to pay the outrageous rents in San Francisco?  Might as well be unsuspecting tourists...\n\nWe were starving after a day of walking the Embarcadero, (which, in retrospect, is not the optimal time to search for a restaurant) and since Capo's was full (Yelp - you let me down: who the hell knew I needed reservations on a Sunday night???) we settled on Calzone's, judging from the amount of people.  \n\nWRONG.  WRONG.  WRONG.  Triple WRONG.  \n\nAs a New Yorker who grew up a stone's throw from Little Italy, they should call this place \"Italian-inspired\" because except for the fancy cheeses used, there was nothing Italian about it.  Period.\n\nWe sat outside to take in the ambiance, as it sort of reminded me of my beloved hometown.  Heaters outside take the chill out of the San Francisco air.  The server's assistant (I hate the term \"busboy\" because these are men, right?) was right on time with refilling our water, bread and getting us butter, but our server?  He was, most notably MIA for most of our \"dinner\" (from the portions, more like a snack).  \n\nWe ordered the roasted cauliflower colore, and except for the romesco sauce and the microscopic shavings of manchego, the dish was unremarkable.  The cauliflower was too al dente, but the flavor was...nothing.  \n\nWe hoped that they'd redeem themselves with the pizza.  Again, WRONG.\n\nWe got the cremini mushrooms pizza and this (and the server's assistant) are the reasons for two stars instead of one.  However light the crust and delicate the flavors, it doesn't make up for the fact that this is an APPETIZER not an entree.  If my fiance and I split a pizza at any restaurant, it is not only enough to fill us, but with leftovers.  I don't know how much an ounce-and-a-half of cremini mushrooms (if that much) and Chimay Grand Cru (a sweet yet intense cheese) cost, but again Calzone's - this is an APPETIZER portion.  Oblong with a very light crust (that was surprisingly good), the flavors were impressive, but not to the tune of $16.\n\nAnd our server?  He was full of smiles (when he did grace us with his presence) but was curiously absent most of our meal.  As far as I know, the universal sign for a woman's meal being done is the reapplication of lipstick.  He saw me reapply lipstick and about 10 minutes later asked \"would you like anything else?\"  It then took another 10 minutes to get our check, another 10 for the server's assistant to take the bill (not the server).  \n\nAAAAAAAAH!  \n\nCalzone's: you're a tourist trap in which we will not make the same mistake twice.  \n\nIf you're bent on dining here, limit it to a cup of coffee and some people-watching.  (Full disclosure - I don't know the quality of their coffee).", "author": "Teresa S."}

The bread was overbaked and too crisp for my liking. I've had way better. We also tried the crab crostini which came with generous amounts of crab and smoked salmon. That was probably the best thing I tried, but still it was only average. Next, we had the chicken and asparagus fettuccine which was subpar. The chicken was extremely dry and the noodles were undercooked. The asparagus was chopped into tiny pieces and was quite tender, but overall I did not enjoy this dish. Lastly, we tried the Italian calzone, which was just decent. For a restaurant with \"calzone\" in the name, I was not impressed and expected much more. Each dish was pretty overpriced, and 8 dollars for a corona is a bit much. I opted for an IPA which was the same price...\n\nThe restaurant is in a prime location in North Beach, but the food is nowhere near the quality of other restaurants in the area.

The good news is, it's only a block away from a place that really is good:  Calzone's.\n\nCalzone's holds a special place in my heart.  I forget how old our baby was, but my parents came over for the day and said, \"We'll take care of her, you two go have a good time by yourself for a few hours.\"  Something that all parents need;  this was the first time we were allowed that privilege.  I found Calzone's, probably on Yelp (before I was a Yelper, that explains why I didn't write a review then), and we went.  Dates, good for married couples too!\n\nThis is a stereotypical North Beach cafe, a European-feeling eatery in the most European-feeling neighborhood in The City.  Small tables on the sidewalk.  Small booths indoors with open windows.  Or you can sit further indoors in the colorful restaurant.  Full bar, which we of course did not do.  We both had a calzone and a Coke.  Lots of meat, not so much bread that it overpowers the entree, not too hard, not too soft, but just right.  The price was right, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was good for the heart-to-heart that we had that day.\n\nOf all the Italian restaurants in Little Italy, this is a good choice.

We enjoyed the fresh pasta and the tiramisu, not to mention the cool decor.  We always brought our family here too and in fact came here for dinner this past Friday (12/26) with my brother.\n\nNow, we always came here despite the grouchy almost bitchy hostess (a smile won't kill you will it?) and despite the sometimes rushed service and lack of attentiveness from the servers; however the complete lack of customer service from both our server AND the manager this past Friday has forever tainted our desire to ever come into this restaurant again.\n\nFirst, we asked if there were any gluten free pasta options--which they don't have.  Fine..no fault there, but our server did not even attempt to suggest a dish from the menu that would accomodate gluten allergies.  For my brother, who works on the Las Vegas Strip, this lack of customer service was atrocious.\n\nSecond, we have always ordered the chicken and asparagus fettucine, and have always asked to substitute the chicken for salmon instead.  No problem ever.  This past Friday we were wanting to have the same dish, but upon making the request, our server flatly denied us the substitution.  He said they no longer substitue menu items.  Okay...since when?  He said 6 (six) months ago.  FINE.  We asked to speak with the manager.  He came to our table, but the guy had absolutely NO intention of helping us enjoy eating in this restaurant.  He told us that they only serve what they know works and that tossing salmon with asparagus and fettucini was not an option,  regardless of the fact that we have eaten this same combo for over 5 (FIVE) years!  Again, horrible service.\n\nWe did NOT stay for dinner.\n\nIf Calzones is not willing to substitue, then they better make it clear on their menu.  IF it is already there, then my bad.  There is still no excuse for the complete lack of customer service.  Perhaps they don't give a shit as they are always busy and there are plenty of tourists to fill their tables; why bother having courteous staff and managers.\n\nIn my opionion, the chicken in the fettucine has always been poorly cooked. The salmon was always good.  I have had better chicken at Pasta Pomodoro!\n\nWe were fools to have kept coming back here. Do your research and find a better Italian restaurant with higher quality food,  ambiance and customer service!!", "author": "Ariel M."}

The music was Italian Romantic and fit the restaurant well. \n\nI had the Crab Alfredo which was pretty much the best Alfredo sauce I've had. That's saying a lot, but if you are wondering why it was so good it was the fresh crab, basil, fresh cream alfredo (not too thick) and homemade pappardelle pasta.  \n\nI also tried the Chicken Pesto Calzone, which was huge. It looked like a giant burrito. It was pretty tasty, but I have to say I was in love with what I had. \n\nI really loved the food here and will come back anytime I'm in North Beach.

My bf's sandwich was on the smaller side, but it had san daniele prosciutto, artichoke hearts & jack cheese and it was also a nice combo that's new to me.

We had been directed here to get our parking validated, and saw all the delicious food and drinks people were consuming that we decided we should have dinner here. \nThe boy and I had actually made reservations for dinner around 6pm because we thought it would get crowded after the festival, but we ended up grabbing a small table along the sidewalk around 5pm. \n\n[If you're into people watching, grab a table along the side walk.] \n\nWe ordered a spring salad and some calamari  - both were delicious and came out super fast. The calamari was not too fried, and not dough-y; it was pretty close to perfection. The spring salad was good - not too bland, and not too dressy. \n\nThe boy and I also exercised our 21-year old privileges. I was debating between a Raspberry Iced Tea (w/vodka), and a mojito. And decided to ask the waiter for his recommendation - the strawberry mojito. Boy, was he right. It was so nom-worthy, and the best part - you couldn't really taste the alcohol. My compliments to the bartender. We had also ordered a Great White beer, which was nice and cold. =)\n\nOverall, it was a great experience, and I would come back to try the calzones and the pizza, and would suggest others to order their mojitos.", "author": "Stephanie W."}

At night, with the candle lights flickering, the red glow of the interior walls and the cute streetside dining tables, it just screamed \"Delicious food. Eat here!\"\n\nOk, lesson learned: Stop judging the restaurants by the exteriors, because the food here was MEDIOCRE at best and yes, I definitely fell into a tourist trap. \n\nCame for a late Sunday night (open till 1am!) dinner and it was still very busy. Scored one of the last streetside dining tables. And actually, those tables are quite cramped! Because the tables are pushed in so close together with your neighbors and pushed back against the wall. I'm by no means a big person, but I had to take off my jacket to sit comfortably. The good thing was that the heaters worked very well. I didn't feel too warm under them. \n\nOrdered the lasagna calzone and the dungeness crab salad. The calzone was so-so. It was meatballs and mozzarella and ricotta cheese inside. I was expecting layers of pasta and meat but it kind of reminded me of a meatball sub sandwich. The calzone crust was very soft, was hoping there would be a tad more of a crunch to it. Overall I wouldn't come back and order it again. It didn't seem very authentic. The salad was ok. The crab was fresh, which I appreciated and they gave a decent portion. The salad was covered in an Asian dressing, which I found a bit weird, since this was an Italian restaurant. But I liked that it was drenched in the dressing. It had the right amount. \n\nService was ok. Found one of the waiters to be a bit snooty. But they were really only there to do the bare minimum. Get your food (which came fast!) and hustle you on it so the table frees up for the next unexpected tourist. =P\n\nSo 2 stars on the food and the service, but 4 stars for the ambiance.

There are many \"overpriced\" restaurants in this city, but Calzone's is not one of them. Friendly staff.\n\nThe reason for the -1 star, is because the outdoor seating is very uncomfortable. You are sitting on a slope, so things can slide off the table, and if you're in the seat closest to the road, you can easily fall backwards. Perhaps if the chairs were made of something more sturdy than plastic, it might make it a lot less wobbly.

Or should I say good restaurants with good bars. It seemed to be a lot of wine bars. \n\nWe were starving, and only had 2 hours on the parking meter. As I was walking by I could see the full bar through the window. I looked at the menu and it had a lot of different options than pizza. \n\nI just said, \"Lets eat here.\" We sat inside rather than outside because it was kind of chilly out. Even though they had out door seating I just don't want to be cold with strangers walking by looking at my food. \n\nThere was plenty of room inside and we still were next to the window so that we could people watch. \n\nThe menu is quite large. Plenty of appetizers, great pizza's combinations, Calzones and pasta combinations. \n\nWe had an appetizer of Mussels in a garlic, ginger and cilantro broth with Linguisa. The Linguisa was outstanding. It was my favorite part over the Mussels. Dare I say better than the Mussels. The tomato sauce was so rich and had the perfect tartness. \n\nTheir cocktail menu is minuscule. Their thing is Mojito's. I'm not that big of a Mojito fan so I steered away from it. \n\nMy husband stuck with the French Lemonade, vodka, raspberry lemonade and Chambord. I didn't think it was going to be good but I tried it and it was really good. \n\nI had a Champagne Cocktail to start St. Germain sweet bitters. I love Champagne any time. It was good. \n\nThe second drink I had was the Caipirinha--Leblon Cachaca, fresh squeezed lime juice and liquid sugar. This is one of my favorite drinks and this bartender has the hands of an angel to be able to make one so good. \n\nThis drink was one of the best I have ever had. Except for the last one I had had way to many limes and it gave me heart burn but the drink was still good. \n\nMy husband got a regular Pepperoni Pizza. The pizzas are a really neat shape. I actually make them like this at home when I make homemade pizza. I thought I was just lazy but apparently this is a good idea. He said the pizza was pretty damn good. \n\nI had the Angel Hair with Clams, Mussels and Prawns in a garlic tomato saut\u00e9. I actually took a picture of it. It was a work of art on a plate. Then added the freshly grated Parmesan. It was out of this world delicious. \n\nThis dish alone would make me want to come back. They do have a Crab Melt on their menu that I was considering getting.

They came quickly and were delicious.  For our meals, I ordered the san daniele prosciutto pizza (artichokes, mozzarella, \nrocket arugula, drizzled with red pepper oil) it was very tasty.  The mix of ingredients proved to be pleasing to the pallet.  There was a bit too much arugula for my taste, but it was easily picked off as it was not cooked onto the pizza.  The artichokes were amazing, I wish there were more on there, or I could just get a plate of them.  It would've been easily shared, much larger portion than I expected.\n\nOne of my counterparts ordered the lasagna-style calzone (bolognese meat sauce, mushrooms, spicy sausage & mozzarella) and the prawns pasta (swiss chard, red bell peppers, pancetta, garlic & basil) which both looked equally as yummy as my pizza.  They had no complaints and both could not finish their large portions.  The person that invented the to-go box is my hero.\n\nWe opted not to have any drinks, but there were many flavored mojitos on the menu that really made me want one!

He blamed everyone else- his owners, open table, me- for not having the reservation I made available. And it isnt like he said, OK no problem, 10 to 20 minutes. It was a shrug of the shoulders and a \"we have lots of people here tonight\"...\n\nRIGHT, that is why people make reservations, so that when there are a lot of people they can still get a table. That is the ENTIRE point. \n\nThe GM does not have the service skills to be a bus boy- and his staff follows suit. I wish I could have commented on the food but we ended up at another restaurant and had a lovely meal with excellent service. When I told the manager of that restaurant what had happened, he chuckled and said \"yea, happens all the time\"\n\nAVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS.", "author": "Marc H."}

The pizza was very good, though it's a little pricey for a personal pizza, still it was tasty and served in a way I've never encountered before. It comes out shaped like a loaf of bread. Kind of cool. \n\nThe lasagna was very so-so. It honestly was similar to a Stouffers frozen lasagna but much more expensive. The service was also so-so.

There food is so fantastic I brought my best Friend Rodney A. back on 08/21/11 & ventured here again in January of this year with my boy friend. Let's just say there food will have you coming back for more is an understatement.\n\nThis place  place had 1st caught my attention while me & my boy friend were venturing threw North Beach & I saw it and it caught my eye with it's neon red lights by there amazingly , adorable awnings  beautiful outdoor dinning, outdoor heating & waiter service all out doors. My eyes were glued to this place. It looked so formal & fancy. There tables & table cloths were so cure & there waiters appeared to be on top of there guest's  every need. It was Italian oh, my favorite. This place had me written all over it.I just starred in awe of this place & starting planting the seed of how I wanted to come back & try this place out. \n\nSo, finally we returned after talking about with my hair stylist & hearing how delicious there Italian Pot Stickers.I was over whelmed with anticipation & went that same day. I was not disappointing what so ever. My 1st time eating here we ate out doors & heated seating was perfect for me as I am fragile & freeze easily because I come from the warmer climate of the  East bay. I sat comfortably at our little table watching all of the people walk down Columbus in North Beach. \n\nI have also dinned indoors both 1st level & upstairs. If you sit in doors I won't lie to you the quarters are little tight . When you 1st walk in there is a  mini wooden  full bar. To the left is leather booths & some small tables.They use a lot of mirrors as wall accents & there is a lot of liquor bottles & small accent pieces over head. Upstairs is really a comfortable dinning area, as it's more  quite, intimate setting it's like your loft oasis  away from all of the chatter & noise.\n\nSo, let's get down with the get down. There Lasagna Calzone is my favorite. Its soft on the outside & you cut it open it's stuffed to the brim with:  juicy mushrooms,   spicy sausage seasoned to perfection & melted mozzarella cheese all covered with a blanket of bolognese meat sauce. \n\nAnother (1) of there enchanting  signature dishes is There Italian Pot Stickers: stuffed with  mushrooms sprinkled with ginger with garlic accents & a fabulous  mild sausage. They are divine & are so much better then Oriental Pot stickers. I can't even begin to describe how scrumptious these are. My only complaint is I wish more came in a plate. These things can be a little pricey. I could probably eat a few servings of these & be satisfied. They are every betas good as Elenie said they are. Maybe even better.\n\nI also really love there calamari as it is just right. It is not too oily, crispy & the squid is cooked just right never under cooked or over cooked. It's just as calamari should be. My only complaint is the really hard bread they serve you while your waiting for you appetizer or entree. It's too hard get some new bread guys. LOL\n\nI love them here. Make sure to make a point to order there wonderful Italian Pot Stickers. You'll love it here! There food is out of this world! Defiantly (1) of the best of North Beach!\n\n-Elena ;)", "author": "Elena A."}

It's so nice to share the same side of the table once in a while.\n\nThe artichoke was soft (overcooked) and I thought better that they should have served the butter as a dip and not puddled on top of the artichoke halves.  The bread that was served in the little Calzone bag was without flavor.  And hard.  My crab melt was served on the same hard bread, and extremely dry - I had to ask for mayo.  The garlic fries had absolutely no flavor, and very little garlic.  You know, we're all used to the garlic fries from AT&T Park or Shoreline...the ones that leave you breathing fire for an hour.

I really wanted outside but was a little chilly and I only saw tables for 2 and we had 3. (I'm sure they would have accommodated if we asked to be 3 outside) but we compromised and sat at a table inside by an open window. \n\nWe probably sat for 10 minutes without a server. Granted, someone came right away and brought us waters. There was probably 5 or 6 employees, including the bartender that were all standing around doing nothing and messing around. At this point I got up to go to the bar to ask for a server. Before I even said a word the bartender pointed me to the bathrooms. I asked for a server to be directed to our table. Sat another 3 minutes when finally someone came to take our order, asked if he was our server and said no but would take our order. You could tell he didn't really know what he was doing. So someone walked behind him and took over. We were ready to order right away so I ordered everything at once. He told me to slow down and it took about 5 minutes to get our order in on their weird little computer device. Idk, I'm from vegas so I expect good service, it doesn't have to be out of this world but at least decent. So past the service onto the food and drinks. \n\nMy bf had the anchor lager. Super good I love lagers, pilsners, and Belgian whites. So, great choice on the beer. I forgot the name of my drink, but it was a specialty cocktail on the rocks, which was super good. For food, we got the heirloom tomato salad. It had heirloom cherry tomatoes, avocado, cristini, and red onions. The cristini was really soggy and the tomato didn't taste of quality. I love every ingredient in the dish, but combined was absolutely disgusting. Now for pizza we got the artisan pepperoni pizza with some added goat cheese. I love pizza so it's hard for me to be displeased. It was very soggy and barely had any goat cheese. They charged us $2 for added goat cheese which is no problem if it had it on more than one piece.  \n\nOverall, very disappointed with service and food. I work In the vegas restaurant industry and would understand if it was crazy busy. It was not. So bummed the food wasn't better considering I was looking for 3 days for a menu that looked amazing with pizza. I was just in awe with how terrible the service was.

There is a waiter assigned to your table but there are others that bring drinks and bus dishes in between so it feels like there is always someone taking care of you.  Our favorites are the Italian Potstickers, Garlic Fries & Pork and Beef Sugo. Portions are big enough to get full and have leftovers or to share with someone else. All in all this is a place I would recommend.", "author": "Patricia L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-28", "description": "The food is damn good (at least most of it).\n\nI would recommend getting a calzone, either the Italian Calzone or the Lasagna Calzone. They were rich in taste and the dough was soft.\nThe bread they give is not warm and there's no butter automatically given--put some balsamic and vinegar on a plate to enjoy the bland bread that way.\nThe Bruschetta appetizer was also good.\n\nI would not recommend getting the Garlic Fries (our order was cold and all the garlic was on the bottom of the bowl).\n\nIf I were to go back, I would try the Italian Potstickers or the Salami Plate.\n\nI know that this is the spot to sit outside and people watch, but I was in a group of 6 people. We had a roomy table on the mezzanine. I think that if you want to sit outside (an experience that's worthwhile), then you should only come as a party of 2 and you should probably get a reservation if you know you're coming at a busy time.\n\nIt's pretty pricey here, but what can you expect at a prime location on Columbus Ave. in San Francisco.\nThe service was great and afterwards it's a nice area to walk around. I'm happy I finally got to check this spot out.", "author": "Marlon T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-12-29", "description": "The Good: Very friendly and attentive staff. Pretty big restaurant inside. Sitting outside is nice on sunny days. My 2 friends and I started with the Italian Wontons and then ordered Chicken with Asparagus Fettuccine, the Chicken and Pesto Calzone, and the Crab Melt Sandwich. The Italian Wontons are meaty and delicious with a nice soy sauce vinaigrette over it. The Crab Melt was good, cheesy, and creamy with the delicious avocado.\n\nThe Bad: We all agreed that my $15 Crab Melt Sandwich was the tastiest main dish we ordered. My friend complained that her pasta was flavorless. She would try putting salt, pepper, olive oil and whatever else in her pasta to make it edible for her. Although the calzone was large in terms of length, my friend said it wasn't as filling as he had hoped. I had some and it wasn't by any means bad, but it didn't do anything to impress me. It was very nice to sit outside, but you gamble who you get seated next to. My friends and I were fine until this large family was seated next to us and the father was rather loud and obnoxious. He never once politely asked me to move, he would just move all over and behind me and expect me to comply. Common courtesy goes both ways. This detail doesn't really knock on the restaurant, but maybe they could space their tables a little more.\n\nThe Ugly: The delicious Italian Wontons were $10 for 4 fairly sized pieces. The complimentary bread they give you to eat had a crunchy firm crust, but it was also used as the bread for my $15 sandwich. This place definitely wasn't cheap.\n\nThe Verdict: Food tasted around average, but nothing worth writing home about. Not the worst place I've ever eaten at in San Francisco, but definitely not anywhere near the best.", "author": "Corey P."}

Everywhere else was closed or looked gross. This restaurant looked very nice from the outside. There's lots of lights and there was nice outdoor dining. We parked a few blocks away. We didn't need a reservation to get taken care of. The staff was friendly. The food was prepared very fast since it wasn't very busy. I don't believe they have a kids menu. I wouldn't recommend this to families with very little kids. Keep in mind that their pizzas are kind of small so one pizza would only feed one person. There was indoor and outdoor seating. The inside was decorated very nicely and tastefully. On the outside there's a ton of lights and there's tables for two. It would be a cute spot for a date. There are outdoor heaters above the tables so you can still dine outside comfortably even when the temperatures dip down in the evening. Overall, I enjoyed my dinner here!", "author": "Julie K."}

You sit by side at a small, tiled table looking out onto Columbus, primarily staring at how few people are eating at Cafe Greco.  Even on hot days, they turn on the heat lamps here but you can definitely ask them to turn yours off.\n\nBeing that the place is called Calzone's, I ordered a calzone... the Smoked Chicken one to be exact.  Inside is pomodoro sauce, ricotta, artichoke hearts, and mozzarella.  Sauce was on the light side and ricotta is on the heavy side.  Beware if you are lactose intolerant and think you can handle this!  For some reason I was expecting a large, triangular puff of an entree but this is longer like a stromboli with dough that doesn't overwhelm you.\n\nChicken was tender but overall I found myself continuously sprinkling chili flakes on this because I wish there was more flavor or at least sauce.  This really is big enough to share so I recommend getting this and a salad.  Ultimately, I would come here more for the view and North Beach experience than anything else.", "author": "Shannon L."}

With its big restaurant sign, tables lined against the front of the restaurant's big glass windows, and the checkered sidewalk that runs along the front of the restaurant, Calzone's is as interesting looking inside as it is outside.  The decor inside the restaurant includes pasta boxes, dangling sausage and garlic bulbs (plastic i assume), sauce jars and cans, etc. that sit in the nooks of the restaurant walls. I came here during a work outing so the restaurant does a great job of accommodating large parties.  \n\nI tried their garlic bread and mussel appetizers, which were nothing special.  For my entree, I ordered the shell fish angel hair pasta which I was hoping to taste like a good frutti di mare dish.  Unfortunately, some of my muscles were still closed and the pasta/sauce of the dish was not flavorful at all.  Each person in my party was given a mini bag of bread and I was hoping to dip pieces into my sauce but given that my dish lacked overall flavor and that I didn't have any sauce to sop up with my bread, I was pretty disappointed with my dish.     \n\nOn a positive note, their tiramisu is worth trying, service here is good and their bathrooms smell like fruity pebbles.  All in all, Calzone's catchy decor does not live up to the quality of their food.", "author": "Maya S."}

My BFF and I chose a table outside and felt weird sitting side by side at the table. I guess outside is made for couples.  But, we enjoyed our time people watching.\n\nWe visited on a Monday night and it wasn't that busy in the early evening. We decided to order a few appetizers so we went with the Italian Pot Stickers (not yummy) and the cheesy garlic bread.  The pot stickers were made with sausage and mushrooms and just tasted off. It would taste better with sausage only.   Not a huge highlight.  We, of course, ordered a few mojitos ($9 a piece) and they were quite tasty.\n\nFor the main course, I tried a calzone and my friend tried some type of past dish.  I have to knock off a star for the actual service portion. The restaurant did seem to get busier, but there were times our waiter and drink orders were non-existent.  Another low point was my calzone. It literally came out about 10 minutes after I ordered it.. and it was cold. \n\nI see their technique for the calzone. Basically their flat pizza dough rolled over and baked. I ordered the chicken pesto calzone. The chicken and ricotta cheese were cold.  I tried to get the waiter's attention a few times with no luck. I finally flagged someone else and asked them to fire it again.  When my waiter finally came by and I explained my food annoyance, he didn't really apologize or care.  Sorry Calzone's.

Everything was going fine until, right when the waiter was taking our drink orders and my dad could not decide which wine to go with, the waiter just walked away. When he came back he had my drink and a glass with a splash of wine for my dad, he told me he liked it. Since my dad cant speak good English, I tried to catch the waiter to tell him to pour my dad a full glass of their house wine. \n\nOnce we ordered the drinks, we went down the menu picked out an entree and ordered, I asked the waiter what are some of their popular vegetarian options, he really pushed towards the broccolini fettuccine, it seemed to sound good so I ordered it. Once we received our meal, it was squished in a very deep small bowl, which is fine, but I suggest something more shallow and wide, especially for any time of noodles or spaghetti and pasta. Anyway while we were eating the meal I noticed the waiter kept wanting to come up to our table, but every time I turned my head he turned away and went the opposite direction. I don't know if I came off as intimidating or what...but the waiter did not look like he knew what he was doing. I do not think that he worked their long, he probably just started at that position. \n\nAs for the food itself, I felt the the fettuccine was not seasoned, the broccolini was a bit bitter, and the flavors together were not a good mix. I did not taste the freshness in  my fettuccine at all, it was stuck together, which indicates that its not fresh.  When any pasta is stuck together it means its been out for a little bit. I'm not saying it's from the previous day but it was not prepared fresh. My dad told me he liked his meal, he ordered the salmon and asparagus. Anyway, 2 stars are for the food and one star for the service and hospitality. This restaurant has potential to be better, they need to make some serious changes.", "author": "Svetlana T."}

We had some antipasti, calamari, she had wine, I had beer (Franziskanner) and everything was going as planned. It was one of the rare times when my mother and I actually get along.\n\nBut when our entree came, the pasta plates were HUGE. I had the suspicion they brought us each one of the same entree; rather than split it for us to share. I asked our waiter. He said only one entree and shared.\n\nWell, that's not what the bill said! When I asked him and pointed to him my bill was charging me for two entrees (not shared) he decided to say \"Oh, we don't do sharing here\"...\n\nWell...maybe you should have told me that when I first ordered and when I asked you the first time.

Our party of seven was seated instantly, despite the place being pretty busy.  \n\nObservations:  They have sidewalk and indoor seating.  The sidewalk is narrow and busy with pedestrians, and sitting out there didn't really seem to be much fun.  Wait and host staff were pleasant.   Initial impression of the place is the decor is, well, red.  The interior literally glows RED.   At first it was kind of fun, but after awhile my retinas were burning.\n\nAfter being seated our waiter took a while to come take our drink and food orders, but, we received our food really fast.  We all had the individual pizzas.  There are so many to choose from, and everyone thought their pizza was very good, especially the crust.  Personally, I have had better, but it was not bad.  I had the San Daniele Prosciutto.  The crust was done very nicely, but the pizza itself was a little overly salty.\n\nAll in all not a bad place for a spur of the moment choice.

There were large chunks of meaty crab and the sauce wasn't too heavy to overwhelm the light crab flavor. \n\nMy only complaint is that this is not the place for a quiet dinner.

I couldn't be happier with a seat outside underneath the heat lamps and twinkling white christmas lights. Definitely sit outside if it's not freezing cold - the heat lamps will help a lot.\n\nAll the pizzas come in one size and are $14 each. I'm not sure if it was the wine we were drinking, but I savored every bite of that pizza. Each pizza is enough for one person, maybe two if you don't eat much regularly.\n\nI had the COMBO PIZZA with eggplant, pepperoni, sausage, onions, bolognese sauceand mozzarella cheese. The crust was thin and crunchy! The toppings weren't too heavy and didn't overpower the crust. It was pure relaxation and satisfaction with a glass of Pravis, white wine. I liked that it was a little sweet and it warmed my tummy.\n\nThe PROSCIUTTO pizza included san daniele prosciutto, artichoke hearts, fresh tomatoes, and jack cheese. The flavor isn't as memorable as the combo pizza. The artichoke and the prosciutto are what makes this pizza eye catching.\n\nHow can we eat at a restaurant called Calzone's Pizza Cucina without trying a calzone? The PESTO and CHICKEN CALZONE tasted just as expected. I found it a little bland just because my combo pizza was standing tall above the others with all it's meaty goodness.

We had the calamari, shrimp fettuccine and the shell fish cappellini between us. The calamari was light and crisp, yet flavourful and delicious. The shrimp fetttuccine was the better of the two pasta dishes. It was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. It tasted fresh, delicate, well seasoned and balanced. Unfortunately, I had filled up on the bread and calamari so I couldnt finish it, much to the bf's delight as it proved to be an excellent lunch the next day.\n\nThe only criticism I can offer is that it would be nice if they provided a herb blend for the olive oil to accompany the bread. \n\nI would definitely return here.

Since we were invited today for lunch I suggested Calzone's for some Italian. Good thing my other half of the party did not show (long story, boring and not for here to be told).\n\nWe got sat immediately, in a big comfortable booth, while we waited we ordered Italian potstickers, french lemonade for the lady, and a stella for myself. I told my lady if they are not here by the times the appetizers are here, were ordering (no breakfast). When the potstickers arrived, we ordered our entrees and salad. This thing though really irked me was the lack of personality of the wait staff. I mean I don't need to be gushed over to feel comfortable, not that kind of customer. But a hello welcome to calzones, offer the specials of the day or suggest a wine? All he said was \"are you ready to order\"? I could have gotten this from dive pizza joint down the street. Also those lil PDAs they have to take a order makes it that much more cold and robotic. I coming to sit down and enjoy myself, food is always intimate especially from what I am expecting from a place like this. \n\nWell the Crab salad came, tasted good, but for $16 seemed (give or take a dollar) steep. Took a bite of the calzone (can't remember what was in it) but talk about bland. Bread was dry and never really hot or moist. Seemed like something out of a microwave (like a hot pocket).\nI had the Bolognese pasta, and yet was sadly disappointed. Did like the fat spaghetti, but the gravy (sauce) was sweet but uninspiring. I wanted some spice or some taste. I am no cook, but even I could have made this same dish, and come out the same. I expect something I could never replicate, thus me wanting to come back. Overall, everything was just bland. It seems to me that the chef or owner has left this place on autopilot and let the cooks rinse and repeat the same recipe for years, and has lost its flavor. \n\nOh I almost forgot, the prices are way steep for the two of us, $75 with a app., one round of drinks, a shared salad and our entrees.

Little disappointing, but in SF there is always a backup restaurant not too far away.  My friends then led us to this strange Italian American like establishment which I had probably passed by a number of times while passing by this part of N. Beach.  This outing was for a friends b-day in late September, yes I know I'm a bit late on many of my reviews...  \n\nAnyhow, we started getting comfortable with some melon mojitos and house wine.  I'd like to note how the french lemonade and the red russian look equally or more interesting than the mojitos.  The general dinner crowd was a lot older and more relaxed.  The place is located in a pretty busy intersection of Vallejo and Columbus so there are plenty of al-fresco dinners that like to watch pass-byers.  A lot of the staff here look pretty Italian which makes me regard the whole experience as more authentic.  I was almost going to order a pasta but then decided to try the classic Italian Calzone which seemed popular with other diners...  I mean how can you go wrong when it's in the restaurant name???  They must be known for it right?   \n\nI believe my other friends ordered gnocchett, some salad, and pizza.  The menu here wasn't really too complicated, cause it was broken down into the basic Italian food sections. My calzone was actually pretty good for $15, and it wasn't overly huge like you might find at some fake Americanized Italian restaurants.  The gnocchi I also had a bite of, kind of strange consistency in the dumping that I'm not used to.  It is nothing like that of the Asian dumplings I usually eat, but it's probably because of the use of potato.  I always hear about gnocchi but never eat it.   \n\nAll in all, this place is well located and still stays very busy.  It is classic and closer to the original Italian food establishment but is too simple and old to even earn 4 stars in my opinion.  When I go to a restaurant I want to be excited or puzzled by things that I see on the menu, and this place just doesn't do that.", "author": "Kenny P."}

I ordered the Italian calzone which  was very plain and soggy I've  had better calzones at small pizza shops my brother got the chicken alfredo the sauce was watery and the chicken was very plain not much flavor my dad ordered the roasted chicken which wasn't cooked all the way . The waiter was garbage he would bring our drinks after we would ask a second time then when we got the bill there were two mocha's on it we didn't order...

That means average to mediocre pizzas and calamari. I missed the appetizers since everyone already came, but drove straight through what I thought was a can't mess up mini-entree of calamari. The moment I put it in my mouth, I knew no amount of seasonings is going to help the mealy textured squids on my plate. \nMy company should have known that if I pass all my food to share, that usually means something ain't right. \nI tried their salmon pizza...the crust was kinda hard, but there wasn't enough salmon on the pizza to make me excited, but they had plenty of capers.\n\nLow lighting, crowded Saturday evening, service was brisk.

But I have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers about the food. Yesterday we had the Cremini mushroom pizza, the pork sugo, and calimari as an appetizer. One virgin Bloody Mary and one cocktail. $85 before tip. A small, thin, tasteless pizza with an ounce? of mushrooms and bland cheese. The sugo was not bad, but sort of tasted like ground beef & pork in a tomato sauce that my mom used to make when she was unmotivated to cook with any more effort than absolutely necessary. Pasta was cooked right at least. But overall bland. We ate maybe half of our calamari...it was ridiculously chewy & again, tasteless.

The Arugula salad was mainly just that, even though it was suppose to have goat cheese, tomatoes, artichokes and almonds.  The salad dressing tasted like straight olive oil.  The roasted chicken calzone was dry.  The chicken had no seasoning, not even salt and pepper.  It was not served with pasta sauce for dipping, we had to ask for it and we were charged an extra $1 for maybe 1/2 cup of sauce!.  In addition,my husband asked for butter for his bread and we were charge $2 for a 1/2 stick of butter with the wrapper still on it.  The beers where expensive too, $8 each (we paid $2 less the night before at a nicer upscale restaurant).  While the food was disappointing the service/buser were exceptional, considering they were asked to cover a large area and had to work their tails off. I would give the two of them 5 stars!!! \n Bottom line, It seems to me that the owners only real interest is to gouge it's customers with sub par food, extra charges for items that should come with the food and expensive drinks.

We requested to sit outside and were seated immediately.  As expected in the streets of the city, don't expect to have a lot of room to sit around the table.\n\nWe started off with the \"Italian Potstickers.\"  I usually avoid Asian fusion dishes, but this day I was feeling adventurous.  They were actually quite good; the sauce they are served in is delicious and sweet and the sausage inside was tasty.  The wonton didn't contribute much to flavor but was cooked decently.\n\nI had the pesto chicken calzone.  Despite a pretty good amount of cheese and chicken inside the stuffing it was actually quite bland and not very satisfying.  Pesto was given in small amounts and wasn't distributed well; only one in every four or so bites had any pesto flavor in it, and the ones that did didn't have very much of it.  Avoid.  I also got to try the chicken and asparagus fettucine, which was also very bland.  It took some salt and olive oil before the pasta had any flavor.  The pasta was also overcooked.  Also avoid.\n\nI got to try my friend's crab melt.  The bread they use is very obviously the same bread they serve for appetizers, and overall the sandwich was very small.  However, the crab mix packed wonderful creamy flavor and it was by far the best tasting part of the meal.  Whether or not it's worth the $15 charge I'm not too sure about.\n\nService was friendly and attentive until the place began to fill up.  We had to go in and find our waiter to get the check and we had to drop it off to someone else because he disappeared afterwards.  The price of the two good dishes, the crab melt and the potstickers, were pretty high, but the calzone and pasta were appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion: Considering the amount of competition in the area, I wouldn't bother going here again.  If you do go here for the convenience or experience, try the crab melt and potstickers.  The pasta and calzone were forgettable.", "author": "Brandon W."}

We had gone to North Beach to go to another restaurant on a Monday night (this other place just re-opened a week prior), and I don't think they were ready for the throngs of people.  That's when we turned to trusty open table, and found Calzone's had availability in 15 minutes, the time it would take us to walk there.\n\nWe walked in and shown to our table instantly.  Its a very cute, very Italian, and kinda touristy place, but the food smelled awesome, the prices were right, and we were hungry.\n\nAfter placing our order, bread arrived to the table.  It was a nice Italian loaf that was the perfect size for the two of us. My only wish was that it was warm and/or not as tough... seemed like it may have been day old? Olive oil and Balsamic vinegar was on the table already (I hate when you go to an Italian restaurant and these are not condiments set on the table).  Our appetizer of Calamari arrived quickly.  The breading on it was awesome.  The menu says semolina, but it was almost polenta/cornmeal like. A very large portion for the two of us, would have been plenty for 4.  The cocktail sauce is a horseradish ginger sauce, that I thought would be odd, but was quiet tasty.  And for my husband who hates horseradish, he loved it.\n\nOur entrees arrived which we split.  The peperoni pizza (because if Pizza is in your name, you gotta try it) and the gnocchetti which we got with the bolognese made with pork and beef sugo.  The gnocchetti was perfect.  Light and airy little dumplings that the sauce just sung with.  The fresh parma cheese they shaved on top table side was the perfect compliment.  The pizza was good, fantastic crust, lots of good melty mozzarella,  but my only complaint was it was the same bolognese used as the pizza sauce.  It wasn't bad, but having the same sauce on two dishes was a little much.  I would have preferred a marinara sauce to really just let the cheese and crust of the pizza shine.\n\nPricing was perfect, service was great, and it was the perfect little dinner in North Beach on a monday night.  They also have free refills on the diet coke, which is much needed with the carb fest we had that night!\n\nI wanted dessert, but honestly we were too full!\n\n-1 star for the bolognese on the pepperoni pizza and the bread not being the best.", "author": "David P."}

Combination was off the hook and I was impressed. \n\nCalzone is all about making customers feel comfortable, even if it is bringing a water bowl for my dog I was taking care of.", "author": "Ed L."}

It's right across the street from The Stinking Rose.\n\nI tried my first calzone. Though they had a whole list of different calzones, I got the Lasanga-Style. It was super yummy and bigger than I thought that I only ate half of it.The price is average, $14.95, not bad at all.\n\nThe only thing I don't really like about the restaurant is the interior design. I got the same feeling as I do with Bucca Di Beppo. I don't find it attractive when there's too many things on the walls, it makes me feel claustrophobic.. ehh.", "author": "Jessica R."}

While there may be the comfort of home in a NY slice, Calzone's commits the unthinkable: meaty marinara sauce. I don't think you heard me; allow me to reiterate: MEAT SAUCE on a pizza!!! =-O\n\nSo--w-w-w-wait--you're already eating pepperoni pizza (& I don't even eat \"swine,\" but this is a marriage in which there will be *NO* talk of divorce)... but then (oh, then!) there's a rich, meat sauce, adding to the amazingness. Pizza-gasms? Now if that's not proof of The Resurrection, I don't know what is. Scarfing it down to the last drop, I just feel so unworthy. \n\nThe sword in the stone, however, is the restaurant's namesake. I'm of the mind that the founder(s) settled on \"Calzone's\" because calling the place \"perfection\" would've been too cocky for SF's laid back atmos; still,  the titles are synonymous anyway. \n\nThe crust of the calzones are nonpareil; thin and crisp, w/out being hard-crunchy. Inside, only the freshest ingredients massage your buds. The mozzarella arrives daily in shady little disguised packages that would be entirely inconspicuous if not for the \"Sicily\" stamp. Okay, so that part is NOT true, but it could be, & I'd believe the authenticity. The mozz isn't clumpy or stringy, just melt-on-your-tongue-a-licious.\n\nAnd no one, NO ONE in the Milky Way produces an eggplant dish that makes you all fuzzy inside for the fact that you're actually eating eggplant & loving the sh*t outta' every mouthful.\n\nCalzone's is often crowded, & there is often a wait, but wtf did you expect? GMAB. There's a line to enter the Pearly Gates; there's a line here!\n\nPersonnel are friendly & happy to make suggestions, not that you need a suggestion; choose anything: EVERYTHING is sublime. \n\nUhhh... Do *not* roll into Calzone's with your last $20 as it will not take you far. Come on payday; bring the whole check; be darned proud that you have such a wholesome place at which to spend it. You *will* want to take something home, in addition to doggy-sacking  your in-dined mouthstuffs.\n\nPut it this way: It is St. Peter's enduring wish to be on Calzones' list.", "author": "Kali K."}

I was hungry so I \"Manned Up\" and just ate it. Small glasses for water is a tease also. Don't gimme a sippy cup size glass of water lmao. Overrated overall.", "author": "Tareau B."}

The food was to the bland side. Seem healthy, well healthier than McD of course. \nThe bread they given for free, its as hard as a rock. Well not that solid, but hard enough. Doesn't seem fresh bread. Well the cola taste, well, like cola. If they can make a cola bland, I think that would be a problem.\nAs for the atmosphere, I sat outside, not much of a view since there are cars parked up front. \n\nI am being generous right now for giving 3 stars.

I had the calzone and two of my friends had pizza.  We started with calamari it was very good.  We were given some really nice bread to start with but no butter.  My friends and I figured out that the oil and balsamic vinager was for the bread.  I think I nice touch would be having someone point this out and offer a plate to use for the oil and vinager.  Better yet the waiter could have placed a plate and started the oil dip off for us.  The little things make the difference between and good and great.  So now to calzone and pizza.  All ingredients  were fresh. The dough to my liking it was not a tradition dough and it seemed a little under cooked on both pizzas and the calzone.  The service was good and they were attentive.

Also got a small baguette in a Calzone's paper wrapper.  Was disappointed because I was hoping a) the bread would be warm and b) there would be more than one tiny baguette for two people.  I tried to flag down the waiter but didn't see him until our appetizers came and by then I   had forgotten about the extra carbs I was so eager to consume.\n\nOrdered the garlic fries.  The french fries themselves were delicious... crunchy, delicate, shoestring perfection with just the right amount of oil creating a tender balance of crisp and softness.  Unfortunately there was almost no garlic.  I found a little bit at the bottom but no where near my expectations.  And I thought Italian cuisine was quite fond of the stinking rose!  Did NOT like the horseradish dipping sauce.  Looked like ketchup but reminded me of something you'd eat with seafood.\n\nI had the san daniele prosciutto (with artichoke hearts, tomatoes & mozzarella).  The crust was a little disappointing (reminiscent of pita bread) but the subtle flavours of the artichoke and tomatoes paired well with the saltiness of the prosciutto.  Was delicious as leftovers.\n\nThe service was prompt and more or less attentive.  For two people, no drinks, just fries a calzone & a pizza the total came to around $40.

The food was always generally good from what I remember.\n\nMy long withdrawl from Calzone's ended this past weekend when I stopped by with a party of 10. Out of the ten of us, no one could rave about their food. My lasagna calzone was quite flavorless and the pasta someone else had was downright bland. The chef gave the table a round of complimentary bread that were on the brink of being stale.\n\nThe ambiance at Calzone's is great, but I can't say the same for the food. As a previous yelper had said, Calzone's menu is simply fast food bistro. My reccomendation for them is to shorten their menu and make the dishes they serve more exceptional. Really, at least their calzone should be mind blowing or they should just change their name.", "author": "Bruce M."}

I came here for a date night, and it was very satisfying. \n\nFirst off, the seating. You have an option to sit inside or outside. Originally, we opted for the outside seats. It was a nice sunny day in San Francisco, so why not? A few minutes in, we realised why not... The wind picked up, and it made it harder to enjoy the meal. Luckily, the workers were kind enough to let us switch to the indoor seats. (If you do go on a very good day, I highly recommend sitting outside. The experience should be quite different ... and it's pretty cute.) Inside, I couldn't help but adore their decor. It's very interesting, and the mirrors make it seem like it's a larger place.\n\nThe food was very good. My boyfriend ordered the chicken pesto calzone, and I ordered lamb. He loved the calzone, and so did I. It was very good, the moment you cut it open, you're simply bombarded with the smell. Simply delicious! In my opinion, it is very heavy, but he managed to eat the whole thing ... The lamb was delicious. What shocked me was that it didn't have that heavy lamb flavour that most people aren't too fond of. The sauce was good, and I liked the green, though it had a strange aftertaste ... but that's just my preference. \n\nOverall, good service (depending on who you get), and great food!

I was so excited for so long only to get turned away.

I told the waiter and he came back to tell me the hair didn't match any of the chef's hair so it must have been mine. That was rude and annoying. The customer should always be right.

I made such a sacrifice last Friday and it was so so worth it.\n\nCalzone's is situated in what I would consider (but who am I), the heart of North Beach.  If you love to people watch, their outdoor seating will become your Mecca.  Tables on the sidewalk, each adorned with an individual heating lamp so you don't freeze your ass off while you gawk ... I mean it really gets no better.  Or perhaps it does. \n\nNow before I go into what we ordered, I feel obligated to say that this was my first visit here, with friends that had been before, thus I relied on their recommendations and allowed them to take the lead when ordering.  In hindsight, and after further exploration of the menu, I would probably order a bit differently next time.  \n\nIn a nutshell, the food here is on point.  We were all wearing elastic waistbands that night so we ordered like true fat kids.  Garlic fries and a caesar salad to begin, followed by the pesto chicken calzone, chicken and asparagus pasta, and the chicken and mushroom pasta.  The garlic fries came with a tasty chipotle remoulade.  The caesar was traditional, but the dressing was a bit oily for my taste.  The croutons were actually homemade crostini which I thought was a nice touch.  The calzone was yummy but the real star of the show was the pasta.  OH EM GEE.  Homemade, like someone's Nonna was in the back rolling out da sheets a' da pah-sta.  The pasta's weren't heavily sauced and tasted very clean.  Lately I'm into clean eating so I fully appreciated the care with which the food was made.  Also, I love their pasta bowls (yes, the actual ceramic bowl).  The calzone was good, but wasn't as hot I would have liked.\n\nWe were too full for dessert, but I would love to try their tiramisu.  Other notables (based on what I saw on my fellow diner's tables) are the calamari, rocket arugala, and crab alfredo.  Good eating at this place... give it a try.", "author": "Alana L."}

I mean, who would have ever thought, mojitos and pasta? It goes SO well together! First off, the mojitos are wonderful-They actually put sugarcane in the mojito, which in my eyes makes all the difference. I ordered the crab alfredo, because I am lavish like that. My beau ordered the chicken alfredo. I LOVED the use of chard in the pasta. The sauce was light and the noodles were wide style. The crab was fresh and they gave you an adequate amount. They also put artichoke in the alfredo which is a delight. I am used to getting the same ole creamy, buttery, over-thick, alfredo sauce, so this was a sure treat.\n\nI can't wait to come back as I feel a hankering coming on for their pasta and a mojitos.

Went to preschool at the St. Francis on the corner of the street, so use to walk by this spot all the time.  We never got to eat there, because my parents were too damn cheap.  Well, now that I'm all grown up, I was honored to step into the place known as Heart of North Beach.  \n\nIt was a Tuesday night, so wasn't busy at all.  Got there early, so we went to the bar and asked, what's your specialty.  Mojito, the lady says, so we ordered a round.  Oh my, you don't even know how much I adore sweet and sour, and sure enough, it was.  It was more sour than your typical mojito, but I didn't complain.  Sucked it up dry the instant it touched my lips.\n\nWhile waiting on friends, I looked at the decor and thought to myself, is this place earthquake proof.  Walls were lined with shelves of empty beer bottles in the bar area, and old relic canned goods and nick nacks in the dining area.  They better be super glued down, because the only thing holding them back is a wire placed across each shelf.  It is a sight to see though, and a lot to admire.  Just feel bad for the person who has to dust them weekly to make sure they look presentable for customers.  \n\nNow let's move on to food and service.  There were plenty of service staff members on the floor that night.  They were pretty cool, but they all kind of looked alike, so i kept getting our waiter confused with our bus boy.  When they gave us our bread in bags, i was so hoping it was warm, but it wasn't.  Oh well.  I ordered the Caesar salad and crab alfredo.  While my friends ordered the lasagna, and lamb entree.  My salad was decent.  Not saturated with dressing, but evenly spread out.  The side of chicken for $3.95 was a little bland.  It looked like boiled and shredded chicken instead of nicely grilled or seasoned kind.  The alfredo was fresh pasta, and it was so silky and perfectly done, I couldn't believe how easily I could slurp it in.  The crab was present, but had some cartilage in there, which I am fine with.  The only thing I wished was that they didn't offer me some fresh pepper and parmesan.  Fudge, moving on.  Tried a bit of my friend's lamb and it was medium rare, so they should of asked how she would of liked it cooked, but it was still pretty good.  \n\nOverall, this place has its charm and you do feel like you're in a different place, like a little Italy.  And the food was pretty good, but it could add bonus points if rolls were warm, pepper/cheese offered, chicken looked more decent and if they added some music to the place.  I would definitely go back though, on another day that wasn't busy.  I can imagine this place being chaotic on popular nights, so avoid that if possible.", "author": "Janice F."}

My son & daughter wanted to treat me to a nice Italian lunch at the North Beach festival on Father's Day June 19th.  I suggested North Beach Pizza but we changed our minds. Columbus Ave was a mass of humanity & vendors. But we were seated inside right away.\nThat's a plus. That's the ONLY star.  We ordered 2 appetizers & a pizza.   The scallops appetizer was tasty but only 3 silver-dollar size pieces for $10. Do the math.  Overpriced for 3 small bites. The 2nd appetizer was the Italian pot stickers. $10 for 4 small potstickers.  Tasty but overpriced.  Then came the Rocket Arugula pizza. What a joke...we were shocked. It was served on a rectangular plate about 4\" x 12\",,,thin crust with NO sauce, NO cheese and covered with a 1\" bed of arugula. Why...because the arugula was hiding 2 thin slices of prosciutto in the middle of the pizza. Both ends were bare. I asked the server if that's the way it comes. He said when the chef cuts the prosciutto it falls off the knife into the middle. You have got to be kidding me.  This pizza??? cost $15. My son said it was the worst excuse for a pizza he ever had in his life.  Shopping mall pizza or county fair pizza would blow this place out of the water.  Talk about an overpriced tourist trap. I'm a SF native but would never recommend Calzone's to anyone. What a disappointing experience.  I should have demanded a credit on our tab. Maybe the manager will read this review & offer us a refund.", "author": "Robert L."}

After many years of having my mom rave in my ear about this restaurant, I came here with pretty high standards.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nBruscetta: Nice crunchy crust on the bread. However, the only thing that kind of \"grossed\" me out was that the basil shreds were pretty wilted-- meaning, it was probably made a while ago. \n\nShellfish on angel hair pasta: There were mussels, clams, and shrimp on top of nice pile of angel hair pasta. The dish was very good but a little on the small side. \n\nMargherita Pizza: this was probably the highlight of the meal. I loved how it was flat bread pizza. Perfect balance of fresh ingredients.\n\nNow, the reason why I gave Calzone's 3 stars is because of the wilted basil shreds, the long wait between the appetizer and the main course (25 minute wait) but put aside those reasons... I left the restaurant still hungry. \n\nI can totally understand why this restaurant would capture my mom's taste buds though-- it is very good.

It's become our fave place to eat in North Beach. We always sit outside and their tables seat you side by side facing the sidewalk so it's great for people-watching on Columbus. All the tables are in the sun- when it's out. We usually split a bottle of chianti and a bowl of pasta or a calzone. Service is always friendly and efficient with water glasses constantly filled and bread with oil and balsamic is served upon seating. The fresh parm grated from a wheel onto your plates is a nice touch. It seems like it's always pretty busy but we get a table right away every time. I think we've tried each of the calzones- all good and my fave pasta dish is the gnocchi in creamy vodka marinara.

Been here before and sat outside under the heat lamps watching crazy Little Italy night life of out of towners and tourists. Went there last night after watching \"Beach Blanket Babylon\" and it was literally a hop, skip, and a jump from Green street. We walked there and told them we had 6 people and even though the place was packed we were seated in a timely fashion. \n\nLet me just tell you the array of good looking men working was nice. I felt like I was in Italy. We got a cute little private table upstairs and we ordered right away with Sergio. This restaurant has hand held devices that go right to the kitchen and bar area so service was fast. I ordered the regular Mojito which was absolutely fantastic. It was just perfect (not too much alcohol or sugar...PERFECT!) Another friend ordered the strawberry mojito and she said it was good. Another friend had the Red Russian (which looked fantastic- Vodka, strawberries, cream). Honey, put cream on anything and I'll drink or eat it. \n\nWe ordered appetizers and they arrived promptly. Salad with Asian dressing, garlic bread with melted mozzarella cheese, salmon cakes... devoured by the whole table. When we ordered Sergio recommended certain things and I went with his advice and ordered the Orzo with sausage (I've never heard of that and I have food phobias...but I'm trying to be different and expand....so....I ordered it).

The fresh, soft texture, but small in size to not overwhelm you of potato-ey flavor is made to perfection.  I had the crab and fresh fettuccine dish with a garlic and grape tomato sauce...delicious.

Food is fine. We had salumi plate, calamari and shared a calzone (three of us).  For a place called calzones, I did expect better...skimpy on the meet and cheese, but i did like that the calzone wasn't as doughy as you expected...It much thinner and less filling than you'd expect. I had a cocktail to start...one of their specials. Too sweet for me (even after i asked them not to make it too sweet). After finishing it I swapped for sonoma cutrer chard...can't go wrong with that and a hefty pour, so i was happy. Again, good food if you're in the area, but not a \"destination\" or \"regular\" spot for us..plenty of other places we'd intentionally walk to.  \n\nPS-to the guy letting his dog lick his plate and eat his food at this place...seriously, come on.

The evening was mild, and perfect for strolling.\n\nWe really didn't have any lunch so we decided to stop in here for an early dinner.  There were 7 of us:  4 adults and 3 kids.  We were seated upstairs on the mezzanine, in a little alcove.  Perfect for us, since it allowed us a little close off area for the kids to roam around without bothering the other diners.  Also had a nice view of the foot traffic along Columbus.\n\nWe started with 2 orders of Caesar salad.  Didn't realize that each one was huge, but we finished it off any way.   Two older girls shared an angel hair pasta with mussels, clams, and prawns.  Must have been good, because they cleaned off their plates.  Didn't have a kid's menu, but they did make a small bowl of fettuccine with butter and parmesan for the 5 year old.  Pasta was not of the pre-made variety.  It was freshly made and cut to order.  Very good.\n\nOne person in our group ordered a calzone (can't remember which one), and his wife ordered an eggplant pizza.  My wife ordered a Hawaiian White Fish with a ginger-soy glaze, over Romaine.  Very huge piece of fish, but found it odd to be offered in an Italian restaurant.  I had a pork scaloppne with eggplant, cheese, over Swiss chard, served with a side of garlic mash.  Very generous serving, pork was tender, not dry.  Nice touch of vermouth in the sauce, without overpowering the entire dish.\n\nOverall, pretty good place, prices are reasonable considering the size of each course.

This is an obvious tourist trap, and such restaurants are always on the bottom of my list. \n\nStill, I tried to keep an open mind as we were herded through the very crowded floor and greeted by a server who looked way too busy. I was optimistic when I saw the homemade fettuccine options. I ended up ordering the blue  cheese alfredo. It wasn't that bad. The chicken and veggies were nice. But I think I only tasted blue cheese in one bite. If you're going to call your dish a blue cheese alfredo, I think you should be a lot more generous with said ingredient! Usually my complaint is too much blue cheese, because it can be so overpowering. But in this case, I felt like Christopher Walken advising Blue Oyster Cult, \"Needs more Blue Cheese!\"\n\nThe rest of my party did not do as well. The calzones were deemed a disappointment. But the real loser was my brother's chicken asparagus fettuccine. Not only did it taste just blah, but the chicken was severely overcooked. It was rubbery, dry, and overpowered by char taste. Why a line cook would serve that to somone is beyond me. It was so bad, that we actually returned it and got another order of the blue cheese alfredo. And we NEVER return food unless it's truly awful. Jussayin'.\n\nThe reason why this isn't a 1 star review is that we did try dessert and this was hands down the best part of the evening.

That being said, serendipity can be sweet, and Calzone's was surprisingly good.  I had an outstanding plate of pasta, my girlfriend loved her pizza, and the wine list--although nothing to write home about--had some nice and reasonably priced options.  The service was friendly, and the atmosphere was a relief after being trapped in North Beach with throngs of people.  You can definitely do a lot worse up there, so Calzone's is certainly worth a look.", "author": "Ty D."}

I just had a few Italian friends dine with us and kept asking for items that seemed to be commonplace with the Italian community. \n\nBack to the grit: both times I've visited, we were sat upstairs. While the bottom level seemed crowded, small and busy, the upstairs area was nice and quaint. There were only a handful of tables accompanied wuth a  gang of employees.\n\nService - there are about 3 different people per table assigned to cater to all your needs. I swear there was a water boy, bread man, waiter and busboy all within arms reach. Needless to say, the service was second to none. We were waited on hand and foot beyond the regular expectations of a restaurant. Let's be real, we all cringe when we see the 18% added to the bill when we felt like the server earned 2%. With this restaurant, I wanted to give more.\n\nFood - who goes to an Italian restaurant for pizza? I don't care if it could, would or should be better than our homegrown deliveries.

I have been going here for the last four or five years about three or four time a year.  It's touristy but the food has always been consistent, super tasty.  On my last visit a couple of weeks ago, I found that the menu options were greatly reduced and that a couple of my favorite items were gone.  I'm not sure if it's been halved but the menu really is smaller.  When I commented about this to the waiter he said they changed it a few months before.  He could not tell me why.  I used to do the Angel Hair with Marinara or the Fettuccine with Broccolini and pine nuts/garlic.  Those dishes were my go to and were the best on the menu, in my opinion, and now they are gone.  The place is largely the same, free bread is the same but without the funny little bread bags they used to include, of course there are the missing menu items, which is a real bummer and the service was never good, just ok but it's more about sitting outside and watching the people walk by and having food and drinks.  I never had a bad dining experience here, never made a reservation, my chicken fettuccine was not as flavorful as the dishes I like to order but maybe that is my perception.  I might go back again in a few months to see if they brought back the old menu items, if not, I may have to find a new spot in North beach that is not one of their sister restaurants.  Bummer.

Calzone's plays for a different league, bats for a different team, or waxes on while everyone else waxes off. It doesn't roll on Shabbas, and if it were an employee it would show up to work slightly hungover and unshaved. \n\nBasically, this place is king of the I-talian restaurants of North Beach -- the row of red-sauce spaghetti houses that give Columbus Ave. it's Disney-esque Mediterranean gusto. It's the kind of place you hit up when you want an evening in Roma without the expectations or the price tags or Perbacco, Del Fina, etc. \n\nPersonally, I love Columbus and its cafes. It so desperately wants to be Italy that it's kind of charming, or at least heartwarming. And Calzone's, in my mind, offers the right balance of good food, great setting/locale, plenty of outdoor seating, nice small bar where they sometimes forget to make you pay for your beer, and prompt service. It's the kind of  place that makes you want to do Godfather impressions, even though I'm pretty sure none of the staff has ever been to Italy.\n\nTry the pasta Bolognese, bruschetta, and of course the calzones. \n\nSo if you're on an eight on ninth date, want a casual and festive place to dine with friends, don't feel like burning through your paycheck on dinner or want a quick bite with great atmosphere before you hit the bars, head to Calzone's. And be sure to ask for lots of gravy on the noodles.", "author": "Andrew K."}

You probably avoided it thinking it was a tourist trap, but give it a chance, you may be surprised.\n\nIt's usually pretty busy so grab a drink at the bar while you wait for your table. They make great Mojitos (7 kinds). Once you're finally seated they will bring you lots of fresh-baked bread and butter (don't you love them already?) The bread comes in a funny little baggie. It's cute. \n\nThe menu is mostly Italian but with a California/fusion flare. But don't assume that all of the dishes are fusion, because they're not.

We ordered the prosciutto calzone, the waldorf salad, and the bruschetta.  Contrary to a review i read earlier, my calzone was perfect! The crust was light and flaky and it was filled with great tasting cheese and a great deal of prosciutto.  The bruschetta was very good, definitely not the best ive ever tried, as their tomatoes weren't as fresh as they could be, but overall i thought it was definitely worth the price.  The downside of our meal was definitely the salad.  The ingredients didn't look or taste so fresh, which is a big portion of why this place only got 3 stars from me.  To their credit, everything else that other people ordered around us, looked amazing!\n\nThe reason this place really got such an average rating despite their above average food is the bad combination of long lines, tightly compacted tables, and really hot and humid interior.  If you have the flexibility, definitely come early and definitely ask to sit outside as you will not only sweat inside (which is horrible for dates :-p) but you will get very annoyed by the claustrophobic feel of the table setup.  And if your unlucky enough to get seated very close to the very loud group of  drunk people, then your experience will really get ruined.  \n\nThe service here was just so-so.  While our server was really nice and helpful, we was pretty good at disappearing for most of the night as we really only saw him before and after the meal.  To their credit, the people refilling the water were very good and always around.\n\nSo in conclusion, while i do feel like that the majority of the food here looked pretty good, looks can be deceiving as this place is absolutely hit or miss in terms of the menu.  The menu is also a bit overpriced which i feel is a little unwarranted and definitely gives a touristy feel to the restaurant.  \n\nThe best way to describe this place is that it is hit or miss.

Calzone's is incredibly fast and cheap, and the portions are pretty generous. The calzones are huge and the roasted chicken salad is pretty good. Stay away from creamy pastas- I found the sauce to be watery and unappetizing.\n\nGranted, I've had much better in North Beach but whenever I have people in town they always want to be outside in the middle of everything.

Really great service here (we had a reservation and were immediately seated).  Nice view of the passer-bys on Columbus Ave. so good for people watching.  Table was on the small side, but all the dishes were served in these very narrow plates, including the Cesar Salad, which was whole Romaine leaves and really good dressing.  I had the pepperoni Pizza also served in a narrow dish.  Plenty for one, with really thin crust, almost like  a cracker, but toasted nicely, with good sauce.

I have eaten here a few times, and have never been wow'd, but never dissatisfied.  The sausage is hearty, the pizza is good, but there is nothing that really stands out to me besides the sitting area on the sidewalk.

Service was actually pretty good and attentive but it's just too bad it was followed up by food that was not very good.  The crab linguine was decent albeit a small dish, but the seafood pasta had the absolute worst shrimp I had ever tasted in my life.  It tasted like they butterflied the shrimp a year ago, froze it, then defrosted it in the microwave and threw it on the plate.  The romaine lettuce in the caesar salad was also clearly not fresh as there were many pink spots on the midrib of the lettuce.  With the pasta dishes being just south of $20 per plate it's pretty clear the cost of the food is directly related to the location of the restaurant as opposed to the quality of the ingredients in the dishes.", "author": "Erich D."}

I always try not to fill up on bread but dipping it in the fresh olive oil & balsamic vinegar was a little too addicting.  We had a nice booth inside, I prefer outside, however, it was Halloween night and the place was packed.  Our friends had the Butter Lettuce Salad and Pancetta Wrapped Scallops to start and we shared a tasty Arugula with Artichoke Salad.  Then for din-din they had Gnocchetti and Lasagna.  My Sweetie & I ordered the Orzo with Sausage and Lasagna.  The server grated generous amounts of fresh parmesan over our dishes and he was very attentive.  I liked the Lasagana but it was a little too aldente and it could have had more sauce.  Same with the Orzo, overcooked and not enough flavor.  We took the rest home and the Orzo tasted better cold the next day.  I got to taste one of the Scallops, yummy good but I didn't care for the wasabi based sauce that was pooled on the bottom of the plate.

The location is dead-on for eating al fresco and people-watching, the atmosphere aromatic and bustling.   Can it get pricey?  Of course it can - the setting is pretty conducive to multiple drinks, and let's face facts - you're in, by choice, a touristy corner of town.  For NB, a typical Calzone's bill is definitely reasonable.\n\nDon't let the name steer you only to the pizza options on the menu - the pastas are excellent, particularly the fettuccine with broccolini, and the gnocchetti have made me a recent convert to gnocchi fandom. In the tomato cream or pesto, they're fantastic.  If you're looking for lighter fare, the heirloom tomato caprese salad and crostini is a win; I was blown away by the semolina-crusted calamari.  Again, the cocktails are another Win - and I'm a former bartender - caipirinhas and mojitos for a regular night out, champagne cocktail for a celebration - also nice to see that they feature Domaine Chandon.

The waiters aren't notably warm or friendly, but that doesn't meant they're inattentive. I just don't feel making a customer connection is a priority here.\n\nNow, for the important part- the reason you dine out- the food: my steak was cooked as I ordered and well portioned (the size of my fist = perfect!), and the zucchini mashed potatoes were fluffy without being doused in much, if any, butter, but they weren't exactly ZINGING! with flavor. Which, for a bit of a foodie, is a disappointment.

I'm also not a huge fan of the bread (which isn't warm and comes in individually wrapped bags), and our starters of salad and eggplant pizza were decent but had the potential to be BURSTING! with flavor. Also, the entrees of my 4 co-diners seemed pretty basic. All got pasta dishes, and none looked particularly appetizing in presentation. As a fairly good cook, I could estimate just at a glance that I could make each dish better and prettier.\n\nI was quite surprised by the somewhat \"meh\" feeling I had after trying each course- considering the fond memories I have of sipping wine and eating lite, fresh, seafood out in the sun during the summer- but I suppose its just not the type of place that's meant to be a great foodie spot in the city. There has to be restaurants such as these: ones where you can go with a group of five and only pay $35-40 each for two appetizers, your entree, and one bottle of wine. Where the food isn't bad, but you don't feel compelled to make it back anytime soon.\n\nAgain, if you want a decent food at a cheap price point, and don't care particularly for the atmosphere of the experience, then Calzone's isn't a bad Italian option in NB. Its just not anything to write home about.", "author": "Raquel C."}

Pizzas in general there are just not as good as other things, so go for something else.\n\nOverall, though, the service was attentive without hovering over us constantly, the appetizers are always good, and I've heard good things about the non-pizza entrees.

I am from The City so was providing a \"tour\" and we ended up in North Beach and hungry.  Decided to stay on Columbus and picked Calzone's.  Most North Beach restaurants (especially those right on Columbus) tend to cater to the non-locals so I was a little skeptical.  Restaurant was busy but not crowded so I was a bit shocked when we were diverted to a table upstairs.  Quickly rectified that one by pointing to a table by the windows and moving to same.  No push back or argument from the wait staff.  Good I thought..  Appetizer of french bread, garlic and mozzarella melted.  A little institutional but plenty of garlic.  My main was lasagne and I must admit it was pretty good.  The pasta was not over cooked; the sauce was bright and there was plenty of meat.  Not overpowering on the cheese either..  Mostly mozzarella and would have like a little ricotta to go with but, still, not bad..  Colleague had the Margaretta pizza..  Not round but elongated.  Fresh tomatoes and mozzarella and basil..  Great crust..  Toppings, well, the tomatoes tasted canned and the cheese institutional.  Still it was not a bad pizza.  Skipped desert..  Full bar and quite a few wines by the glass in the $8 - $12 range.  So the verdict is Calzone's is not bad..

I was surprised how much they gave me because they poured past the \"appropriate\" line to pour wine, but hey, im not complaining! my friend ordered their plain  mojito, and it was the best mojito i have ever had. by best, i mean it wasnt too minty, or too sugary, or too limey like most other places are prone to do. it tasted like an authentic mojito.\n\nso we get seated at the table and ordered the following:\n\n- heirloom tomatoe salad: oh my god. ok, i know this sounds weird but as a child i had a semi-phobia of tomatoes. i think its because of that show i used to watch called \"ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES\". anyways, i usually get seriously nauseated when i see people eating tomatoes whole (i wanted to stone people who ate tomatoes with sugar on it... omg ew) but i can tolerate, even enjoy, tomatoes chopped up and processed. anyways, their tomatoe salad was AWESOME. their vinaigrette was not too vinegary (omg there's a swear word hidden in that word)  and i didnt know green tomatoes could taste so good! it had crostini and avocados in it too. it was so refreshing.\n\n- italian potstickers: YUM! it came on a bed of arugula which i might have enjoyed more than the potstickers bc my friends ate most of the potstickers but wow these were pretty good. granted they tasted almost like regular chinese potstickers, they were still good. italian sausage and portabello mushrooms... mmm mmm...\n\n- sausage/peperoni pizza: ok i was expecting a salty ass oily ass thick crusted ass pizza, but no. somehow they managed to make a PEPERONI pizza light. how, i dont know. but i love love love love love thin crust. and though i dont remember too much of the pizza (bc i was scarfing the salad) i do remember that it was satisfactory.\n\n- garlic bread: i was least impressed by this one, it was really cheesey which is good but not really expected of garlic bread, but hey if you garlic bread is your thing you'd probably have a lot more to write about this one.\n\n- pesto calzone:  WOWOWOWOWOW im so glad someone ordered this. ok before this place i thought a calzone was this loaf of chewy ass bread stuffed with oily ass cheese and chewy ass meat.... but i think this is what a calzone is. it's crust was so thin and light, crispy yet malleable, and it encased a gooey but NOT oily filling of fluffy ricotta and light (not too garlicky) pesto swirled with oozing mozzerella and tender flakey white chicken. i've only seen the likes of this on food network. \n\nservice was satisfactory. the place was ridiculously crowded but kudos for finding us a seat on a night where everything else was jampacked. \n\nthis was the first time i had \"authentic\" italian food, so i may be wrong, but i'm just saying i had a great time and enjoyed the food. i have yet to have a better italian meal.", "author": "Lillian P."}

So instead of dropping of the cute piece of man meat into the Castro to make us some money, we decided to play it safe and head to the oh-so-cultured North Beach for dinner on Thursday.  Hey, North Beach does not have millions of cacti and/or small desert mammals, so it was more culture than out-of-towner had ever seen.  We decided on the touristy Calzone's for it's location and price.  OK, let's be real.  We came here for the full, cheap bar.  \n\nI had a hard time deciding what to eat since there was just so much on the menu, but settled on brocollini and linguine in a red pepper oil.  The bf had the chicken calzone and the Arizonian had the ravioli and his gf had the pepperoni pizza.  To start we ordered the bruschetta and the italian potstickers.  The bruschetta was delish and I'm sure I smelled like I had just eaten at the Stinking Rose since it was piled high with whole garlic cloves.  The italian potstickers were just what I imagined.  Gross.  I mean, Italian + Potstickers cannot = good.  It was basically some marinara and chicken and cheese in a potsticker shell smothered with soy sauce.  Just as unappetizing as it sounds.  My linguine came and the taste was there, but the preparation wasn't.  The linguine was a giant clump of noodles that looked like it had been sitting there all day and reheated.  The brocollini was luke warm. Had it been prepared correctly, I'm sure it would have been killer.    The ravioli didn't even come with sauce!  I don't know if I've ever known a down-home ravioli to come without some sort of sauce.  Weird.  He ordered some on the side, but it's just not the same.  The pepperoni pizza looked pretty standard, although I didn't try any.  If you're going to eat here, just come for the namesake.  The calzone was delicious and HUGE.  Warm, gooey cheese and filling and a perfectly cooked crust made it fantastic.\n\nOther than that, it's a pretty good location and afterwards you can always walk a block in any direction to get a few drinks.

Our waiter tossed a couple of rolls wrapped in paper bags on the table as he was rushing by (kinda perplexing... and maybe a little unhygenic).  When we got our food, we all noticed the weird, rancid smell coming from the Fella's plate of pasta, but our waiter just disappeared.  Fella shared his brother's pizza because he couldn't really eat the rancid crab.

Fella said quite clearly \"there was something wrong with mine... I couldn't eat that\", but the waiter toally ignored it and said something like \"thanks for eating here, hope to see you soon\"... he obviously didn't notice that Fella's food was untouched, or hear that he couldn't eat it.  I live down the street and eat out a lot, but I won't be eating here again.\nIncidentally, Fella and I had eaten dinner at the Olive Garden in San Jose (San Jose!) just the day before and the service was incomparably friendlier and the food actually much, much more flavorful and tasty.  My thoughts... skip Calzone's and take the M out to Olive Garden at Stonestown.", "author": "Kri B."}

Around 3pm we decided to eat, so all 35 of us walked into Calzones with no reservation. The room upstairs was the perfect size for our group. I could not believe how fast and friendly the service was. We were all seated with menus and water within 5 minutes. They even brought us lemon wedges for our waters without being asked. Five minutes later we all had bread, drinks, and our orders taken. My friend and I shared the margherita pizza, which was garlicky and delicious. Everyone in our group polished off their food, so either it was delicious or we were all starving after hiking for 6 miles. Our water glasses were kept filled, more bread was offered, and the waiter didn't seem to mind the multiple checks. It was a great place for a large group, but I also hope to go back with my boyfriend soon and sit out on the sidewalk and people watch.", "author": "Melanie I."}

I'm assuming they make it fresh here, and if not, then maybe i'm even more impressed.  the fettuccine was wide, but thin, and the flavors with the shrimp made it a really good scampi (often it tastes like watered down garlic sauce, but not here).  My ravioli was my favorite because of the filling.  It was a chicken and cheese filling, but it wasn't dry (as i have often found with chicken raviolis), and the fried sage was a nice touch.  \n\nplus the decor is pretty eyecatching.  again, i doubt i'll be back before I try all the other italian places, but it was a really pleasant lunch.", "author": "Anne Marie B."}

Not to say that the food here is actually that bad, but in SF and in North Beach especially, there are so many BETTER Italian restaurants to eat at. Nevertheless for some reason, this place always appears to be packed. We went and tried this place on a Mon night because my sister says every time she drives by it, there's a massive amount of people eating at it or waiting to do so. Even so, we got seated really quickly. The three of us ordered the following:\n1. Calamari. You just have to try calamari when going to a new Italian restaurant! That being said.. this calamari was just mediocre and the cocktail sauce was HORRID!! It was so sweet, I was tempted to spit it out.\n2. Garlic bread with mozarella. Extremely greasy and not good. How can you mess up garlic bread with mozarella!!\n3. Orzo with chicken, asparagus, and mushrooms. YUMMM!! *Sigh* The saving grace for this restaurant was its ability to introduce me to orzo.. that yummy, funny pasta shaped like rice. I could have just eaten it plain and still been happy with it.\n4. 5 hour pork and beef sugo. This seemed extremely promising but wasn't anything special. Just your average extremely meaty bolognese sauce.\n5. Lasagna. Now if you don't like ricotta cheese in your lasagna and if you love meaty lasagna, you'll probably like this lasagna. It was just about right and one of the best dishes we had that night.\n\nSo with three of us sharing this meal and with each of our own glasses of wine, the bill came out to $35 each including tip and tax. That's just more than I want to pay for a place like this.", "author": "Lauren C."}

The way they positioned the table so that you can watch dozens of people fly right by you while you're enjoying the food is fun & it's a great way to practice your eye winks at the hotties who stroll by.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-05-26", "description": "After having a great meal at The Franciscan Crab House in April 2008 I was looking forward to dining at its sister property, Calzone's Pizza Cucina. We (me, wife, 8-year-old daughter) dined there on Saturday, May 23. We made reservations about a week in advance for a sidewalk table and were promptly seated when we arrived. It was very cold and windy so the heater was a must.\n\nSitting on the sidewalk has its plusses and minuses. On the plus side, dining al fresco is usually fun, especially with the people watching in North Beach. The minus is that behavior that would never be tolerated inside the restuarant isn't given a second thought on the sidewalk. I'm talking about the woman from Italy two tables over who spent 90% (I am not exaggerating) of our meal speaking loudly on her cell phone while chain smoking cigarettes. Of course, you have San Francisco's local color to fend off during your meal, too. Be prepared for panhandlers looking for money or food, and be quick to fend them off lest they break out in song hoping for some money.\n\nThe service was efficient although I would have to guess that every waiter in the restuarant is from Mexico or Central America (none from Italy?). Except for one of the bartenders I didn't see a single female employee all evening. This place turns the tables over quickly - if you don't want to be rushed through your meal you'll need to let your server know that you are not in a hurry.\n\nThe garlic bread appetizer was yummy although it was far too small. My wife ordered some kind of pasta dish (I don't remember which one) and she said it was good but a bit small of a portion. My daughter and I split a pepperoni pizza, which was very good but far too small for the money. The bottle of wine we ordered wasn't bad and seemed a decent value (although I know virutally nothing about wine).\n\nAll in all the meal was decent - I wouldn't go back because there are so many restaurants to try in North Beach.", "author": "David J."}

I will say that the atmosphere was pretty cool, as we've both never ate at a restaurant with outside seating on the sidewalk (we're new San Franciscans).  \n\nThe food on the other hand...I don't know how you can even call their calzones food.  I would say 75% of my smoked chicken calzone was uncooked and mostly doughy.  I still ate it regardless, but I normally expect cooked dough when I eat pizza or calzones.  As for the calzone as a whole, it was OK.  I wouldn't say the chicken was smoked and the sun dried tomatoes in it were crap, but overall it was alright.  I would not order it again though, and I will probably not go back to this place.\n\nAnd as for the service, it was pretty slow - it took us about 20 minutes to get someone to get us our check after we were finished with our beverages and food.  The place wasn't even very busy, and our side of the outside seating was just being entirely neglected.

I just returned from what I can only describe as an horrific dining experience.  Calzone's was the worst for food, service and ambiance that I have ever experienced in my 12 years living in San Francisco.  \n\nMy friend and I were served two appetizers and split a calzone for  dinner.  The calamari tasted freezer burned, the cocktail sauce tasted like catsup-which, incidentally when we finally spoke to the manager and told him of this atrocity, he seemed relatively proud of that accomplishment (Whaa?!), the mussels were tiny, over cooked and tasteless and the calzone was mediocre at best.  \n\nBut what finally did me in was their overt disregard for and clear ignorance of CA state law.  When I complained that the smoke from a woman's cigarette out front was bothering me, I was told that 'it was ok, people can smoke at the tables on the sidewalk',  wtf???  I said no, in fact its against the law in the state of CA to smoke within 20 feet or less from a door or window of a restaurant.  And as a manager he should know that he's putting his employees health at risk each time they are forced to serve a smoker.  The manager argued the point with my friend and I for about 10 minutes and even said that our fair city of San Francisco had issued them a 'special permit' that allows smoking on the sidewalk in front of their establishment.  He said it was posted outside (by the way....the 'permit' to which he referred was actually a warning sign that smoking is hazardous to your health and not issued by any city agency).  He must think everyone is as stupid as he.  Then he continued to argue with me that not only was this rude and inconsiderate woman free to smoke but that Calzone's encouraged smoking.  I thought he was unprofessional and dismissive.  He was more comfortable creating a scene with me in front of other diners than he was approaching a woman and simply requesting her to obey state law.  When I asked if this is how he typically responds to customer complaints he said 'well what do you want me to do?'  At that point I accepted the fact that this 'manager' did not posess the skill or intellect to resolve the color of his hair much less the ability to run a restaurant. \n\nSo if you enjoy crap food, a dining room full of cigarette smoke, worse customer service than DPT and argumentative, defensive wait staff...Calzone's is your place, enjoy!", "author": "Linda R."}

My experience with this place has never been exceptional, but the reason I continue to go back is because of the food.  This Saturday night, I had by far the worst restaurant experience that I have ever had in my entire life.  I will NEVER go back to CALZONES ever again! Let me tell you why:\n\nIt all started when I called to make reservations for my bachelorette party.  A group of 10.  I made them over 2 months ago.  Everything was fine. I called to confirm Saturday morning (the day of my bachelorette party) and the girl on the other end of the line said that they dont take reservations and that no one ever told me I had a reservation.  I told her that I have thrown 2 parties and have hosted them at Calzones and had made a reservation each time.  She said, Mam, please stop lying.  I was apalled!  I thought to myself, I dont want to give them my business, but my invitation has Calzones printed on it and it will be too hard to get in contact with everyone to change it.  \n7PM 7/19/08 we arrive at Calzones.  She tells us it will be a 20 minute wait...we have no problem waiting.  The hostess walks up to my friend and tells her to move and that she is in her way.  My friend says \"Excuse me?\"  The hostess said, \"You heard me!\"  \nFinally, 45 minutes later we are all seated.  One seat was unoccupied at the table.  The hostess comes upstairs and starts counting the number of seats.  I knew she couldnt see very well since our group was behind a wall, so I said there are 9 of us.  She replies with \"No shit, I can count!!!\" I went crazy and told her to send her manager upstairs.  30 seconds later the manager comes over and I tell him what has occured.  Please be reminded that I was at a table with 8 others.  He flat out says that I am a liar and that there is no way his hostess would ever say that.  I told him that I worked in a restaurant for over 4 years and that never in my life have I ever seen a manager take the side of an employee over a guest.  I told him that no matter if he didnt believe us, he should have apologized for the behavior of his employee.  He noticed I was wearing a bride to be shirt since it was my bahelorette party...in the middle of me speaking he turned around and began walking away....he got a few steps away and then said, yeah congratulations your marriage will never last!!! I was appalled...we got up and left.  I called this morning to speak to a manager and when I gave my name and what is was regarding, the guy on the other end of the line said \"Oh this must be the drunk bitch from Saturday night who tried to get my fired!!!\"  It was the same rude manager!!!!!!! I could not believe it!!!  It seems that the hostess and the manager must have been having sexual relations and it was quite pathetic that we recieved the service we did.  I tried to get into contact with someone higher up than them but it seems impossible.  They truly ruined my party and I hope people never go there!", "author": "Brittany D."}

It gets even better from there. . . but if you do the Calzones ask for sauce on the side or it will be dry.  The highpoint is an ultra-larder of fascinating Italian pantry items on overhead shelves througout restrained, unconvincingly, by thin wires against the eventual earthquake.

My boyfriend told me here has been here before and the food was OK. So we sat down and ordered Bloody Marys which was good. We ordered the Garlic Fries which was really good. Also ordered Bruschetta which was not that good at all. Would not order it again. The presentation was good and it looked like it would taste good but once you bite into in the bread was hard and the taste was average. I have had better. I also ordered the Norwegian Smoked Salmon which would have been very good if they did not over power the Wasabi Aioli. It was so much on there in certain spots that when i took I bite I would almost cry and it would hurt my brain.  Wasibi is strong you have to really spread it lightly on the bread. I had to take off the bread after a couple of bites. The side salad was lite and good. I ate all of that. The person sitting next to me got the same sandwich I did and I notice that she also took off the bread where the spread was on. Just shows that it was not only me. I don't know if I would go back there again because there are allot of other restaurants with outdoor sitting. if I do go back there I might just get there garlic fries and bloodymarys, maybe try there calzones. The staff was nice and fast and the food price was OK.", "author": "Ge I."}

However, it is quite the tourist trap. The service was very disappointing: unfriendly waiter and several bus boys with different tasks who apparently didn't understand requests for more water or bread. And the most pathetic wine list for an Italian restaurant. The food comes out incredibly fast, almost unnaturally. But it is quite good. The gnocchetti is fantastic and the calzones are unique on their foot-and-a-half long plate. Also calzone's is open until 2 am so after heavy drinking some quick, rich italian food hits the spot. Also tried a mojito which was delicious but seemed out of place at an Italian restaurant. I would probably go back for a late night bite if nothing else was available.", "author": "Kate M."}

Needless to say next time we will skip Calzone's and continue on to a place more like, say NOPA.  Upon  arival we were practicaly bludgened to death by the so called greeting we received from our waiter Randy.  The first thing he asked was \"Can I get you anything?\" Well certainly. \"A kettle one gimlet straigt up, a glass of wine, and  GG Martini.\" After the second glass of water of was finished, Randy decided to take our food order. We ordered and Randy discouraged me from ordering the cheese on my salad, telling me that the goat cheese would be better.  Aftger 14 years of waiting tables, I think I am familiar with the cheese I prefer.  The cocktails came.  The Gimlet straigt up was on the rocks and I pointed it out.  Randy pointed out to me that it was, in fact, a gimlet.  I pointed out to Randy it was indeed a Gimlet, but I wanted a Gimlet straight up.  I understand.  Long day. End of shift. Ready to go.  But.....if this the   aattitude you have waiting tables, maybe breakfast would be more appropriate for Randy to be serving.\n\nSo if you're reading this, Randy, now and you and the rest of the world understand the difference between 15 and 20 percent. I could go on and on until the rest of the dinner was complete, but I feel I've said enough.\n\nOn a happier note, the food was nice, and I made it to Safeway before 2:00am!", "author": "spacestarkid P."}

Its sister company is the famous \"Stinking Rose\" which is usually always busy and a long wait. But Calzones food is just as good with a fun atmosphere. The walls have hundreds of different Italian foods stored on shelves with hanging fake meats and such. It keeps your eyes busy while your waiting for the delicious food. You cant go wrong with any of their pizzas! great place for dinner", "author": "Tiffany S."}

Servers are very busy but alway get what I want when I ask for everthing from a extra parm to more bread.  They are very nice if you want a different veggie or somethig special. If you like Lamb believe me I have tasted the best and this is right up there.  It's so good I have to admit I just have to order it every time medium rare. Perfect.! Tender juicy, never over cooked and tough,  The lamb is boneless and comes with a pile of arugula tossed with a light wasibi dressing. Talk about healthy low carb and tasty.  Your really eating right in a restraunt called Calzones, The lamb has a demi glaze that is just a perfect counter point for the flavor of the meat.  Just a warning to the carb counter.  They bring thease litle loves of Italian bread in a mini black and red bags, then you can fill your sauser with good olive oil and the sweetest balsamic viniger,  But wait,  If your like me you ask for some parm,  No pre grated dry chease here. The bring a block to the table and start grating till you say stop or the plate spills over.  The price? $17.  North Beaches biggest bargen and there really nice too.", "author": "richard p."}
