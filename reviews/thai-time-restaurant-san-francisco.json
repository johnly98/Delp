This place is awesome, the spices and herbs are all original Thai cooking. The smell , and taste is awesome, simply awesome.  I've been in Thailand many times and this place authentic , too many places say original Thai but it's far from real Thai cooking. Some are kinda Chinese , Vietnamese or Laotian taste , this one is spot on. \nLittle place that is super busy, especially around lunch and dinner time so a little wait but it is worth it .  Clean with good customer service, great Thai owners , large variety of dishes on the menu , good location and authentic!  I will definitely be back and I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants original taste of Thai food.\n\nReally enjoyed this the food.", "author": "Kevin O."}

Small restaurant with small tables but it smelled amazing. Good sign so far. We waited a while for just menus and waters, but put in our order (three dishes) relatively quickly. Then waited... and waited... and waited. For an hour. I'm honestly not even exaggerating because the entire time, I had one eye on an empty table that was piling up with to-go bags and customers arriving for pick-ups. If they straight up told me that they honored to-go customers more than in-house customers, I would believe it.\n\nDon't get me wrong; the food was great. But worth waiting an hour for? Absolutely not.\n\nAs a follow-up though, I did give this another try and placed a Yelp pick-up order a few months later. My wait time? 45 mins. The food? Huge containers. It's totally worth it if you time it right. Just have a snack or two while you wait.", "author": "Lucy Z."}

Whether it's the curry, noodles, rice, or beef salad, all are very tasty and they give you large portions. Located on a side street next to a very busy and restaurant-filled Clement Street, this place is a stand out to me in terms of Thai eateries in SF. Lots of parking in the area although depending on the time of day, you may have to drive around a bit. \n\nWarning: this place is small. 8 to 9 small tables max so this place is not good for large groups. Expect a long wait during certain times of day/night. They do alot of delivery orders so if you want delivery, you have that option, although if you are eating-in, the wait for food might be a bit longer as a result.

It wasn't crowded at that time, but by the time I finished my meal around 6:30, there were a couple parties out the door. The restaurant itself is pretty small, definitely for smaller parties (2-5ppl) because there was only about 7 tables total. Anyways, service is fast, food is delicious and CHEAP. \n\nMy bf and I ended up getting 3 dishes. Each dish ranged from ~$8 - $10 which is really really good prices for quality food! We got the Thai Tea, Tom Yum Soup,  Tofu Pad Thai, and some type of garlic/basil fried rice = #66 with Pork (I forgot the name of the dish LOL). \n\nThai Tea:  It was $2.50. It tasted good, but not sure if I would pay $2.50 all the time for it. I'd rather get boba down the street if you are craving milk tea. \n\nTom Yum: I got this dish with chicken, and let me say - THEY GIVE HELLA CHICKEN. The soup tasted average, like any other tom yum soup. I don't think I'll be getting this next time though, because I was so full after eating it and couldn't finish my other stuff. It was flavorful, not spicy, had mushrooms, tomato, and chicken, really basic. But it came in a clay pot and the nice server scooped it into bowls for me so that was kinda cool. \n \nPad Thai: I liked this dish but it was little too much on the saucy side for me - which is weird because I never had saucy pad thai before. The tofu was yummy and fried and the noodles were a good chewy consistency. I also like how the peanuts were really small - so it had the flavor but not the crunch. The portion size was good for ~$8 that I paid for it. Overall, super flavorful but again the sauce made the consistency kind of slimy and too flavorful. \n\nBasil Pork Fried Rice: Really tasty!! I loved the flavor and texture of this. It really had strong basil and garlic flavor. The only issue was that the pork tasted a little off - so i just picked it out on the side. It might've been nothing, but still tasted kinda weird to me and I didn't want to take chances. Overall, still good taste and good price.\n\nWILL BE COMING BACK!!!", "author": "Anna L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-24", "description": "So when is Thai Time anyways? -- ANYTIME. All the food here is really that good, and it's literally open all day every day. \n\nAfter trying a slew of Thai restaurants around the SF Bay Area, I find most of them sufficient at satisfying my Pad Thai cravings, but the only ones that really blow me away are Kin Khao (can't argue with the Michelin star), Farmhouse (hipster setting and unique dishes), and Thai Time. While the former two are bouge and expensive, Thai Time's prices are a steal. Lunch specials are ~$7-8, and dinner entrees are ~$9 and under $15.... which in SF gets you artisan avo toast and craft coffee.\n\nThai Time has the vibe of a local small business, no-frills but clean and well kept. The setting features lots of traditional Thai decor in a cozy space. Note that with ~8 tables inside, the wait can be long. (Came at 9pm on Sunday with the wait nearly an hour; however there was no wait at 6pm on Friday.) \n\nThe menu is huge, including all your Thai food staples in addition a wide selection of unique Thai dishes I haven't seen at other places. Making decisions can be overwhelming; when in doubt, choose from the \"Thai Time Favorites\" to try their specialties. They also have a specials menu board posted. \n\n(+++) Angel Wings ($9.20): I've had this before at Cambodian restaurants, and Thai Time's version is definitely among my favorites. Not only are you amazed by the feat of how the wings are deboned (though note some bones at the tips) and stuffed with ground pork, silver noodles, and mushrooms; the delightfully thin panko crust and tangy sweet and sour sauce add nice flairs to create a very appetizing appetizer.\n\n(+++) Hor Mok Talay ($14): Looks great and tastes even better. The sauteed prawns, calamari, scallops, mussels, and crab are submerged in a delicious coconuty red curry sauce, all inside a coconut (!!) You scrape the sides to add more coconut meat to the melange, creating a scrumptious and multi-dimensional dish. Be aware that it's quite filling from all the coconut; that it's incredibly delicious and difficult to stop eating :x\n\n(+++) Green Curry Duck ($11.35): The green curry has the same aromatic coconuty tones, with more depth and savoriness compared to the red curry. We were also impressed by the seemingly endless chunks of meaty, juicy duck slices. \n\n(++) Ped Yang ($10.75): Same great boneless duck, served another way. Being accustomed to crispy roast duck, the syrupy-saucey version took a bit of getting used to. I grew to like the interesting paradox of such a thick sauce with such light flavor that physically smothered yet subtly augmented the taste of the duck. \n\n(++) Thai Rib ($10.55): A curry version of galbi. I don't know about the texture of the ribs, which were charboiled to very dry, almost like jerky. It's still quite good considering it's covered in the creamy red curry sauce for balance; just don't be expecting fall-off-the-bone braised ribs.\n\n(++) Pad Sai Roong ($9.70): There's something about the surface area and texture of the thin silver noodles that has a lighter mouthfeel than carby rice noodles, and Thai Time does it just right with a light soy sauce and a bucketload of assorted vegetables and shrimp.\n\nPortions are ginormous, but I suggest ordering more and taking home leftovers so that you can try different dishes. Not only are the portion sizes decently sized; the generous amounts of duck/seafood essentially make all other restaurants in SF look stingy.\n\nOther tips:\n*This is totally a raving review, but be careful not to hike up unrealistic expectations only to get disappointed.\n*Take-out available. May be most efficient if there's a long wait.\n*Thai tea comes with a very artistically (Instagram-worthy) folded straw wrapper.\n*We were curious about Thai Crepe and Hod Thai (pan-fried mussels), but it wasn't available on both of our visits. We were bummed, though the server explained that they take a lot of time to prepare so isn't served all the time.\n*Parking isn't impossible, just may take some circling around. There's a public lot nearby which charges the same as street meters (free after 6pm and all day Sundays).\n*Don't come in a huge group since the space is small. But do consider coming in up to 4, so that you can try more dishes. Note that the tables are compact as well, so eat efficiently to make space for the next round. \n\nTL;DR: Thai Time is one of those amazing niches that's worth coming back until you try the entire menu. \n\nGeez, this review makes me sound like a glutton, but Thai Time really is that good.", "author": "Edna C."}

The angel wings were not what I was expecting-it wasn't a sweet/spicy glazed, lightly fried chicken wing, but instead a hodgepodge of mystery meat, glass noodles, and other things in the shape of chicken wings-kind of like meatloaf, but the chicken version. I was not a fan. 1 star. The pad Thai was delicious!!!!!!! Get it! The green curry was also packed with flavor and had a nice kick to it. 4.5 stars for the both of them!

Right up my alley, right?\n\nI started with the Pad Thai, but was disappointed. I love pad thai, and it was mentioned by a lot of people. But, this one was just not packing a lot of flavor. King of Thai is definitely beating them in this item, hands down.\n\nWhen trying a new place - especially one as economical as this one - I usually try a few menu items. I got the Thai Time Noodle Special (letter E on their specials board), and man was it fantastic. I also got the rad na with beef. Delicious. \n\nOne thing I'll change next time is ordering stuff spicier. Luckily their spicy sauces are decently effective.\n\nOh and it's not just the food that's cheap - the Thai Iced tea clocks in at only $2.50, making it one of the cheapest I've had.\n\nAnd did I mention they're fast? Lightning fast. I was in and out in 25 minutes AND I never felt rushed in the slightest. \n\nDefinitely will come back, although at a more typical time (I was there right before closing), I imagine it might be harder to get a table and I'd have to do takeout.", "author": "Chris S."}

Not to mention, the ingredients are always fresh, and the portions are quite generous. \n\nGiven the small size of the restaurant, tables are at a premium, and the wait is often long after 6pm. Instead of waiting, I opt for delivery since my flat is nearby (tip: it's much cheaper to call than order through Yelp). Most estimates are 45 minutes but often arrive much earlier. Pick up is another great alternative, which typically takes 15-20 minutes for modest orders.\n\nAs for the food, I am very rarely disappointed. I recommend the Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, and Thai Time Fried Rice. The vegetable dishes are also very good, and the curries are quite popular. The duck, however, is extremely salty, so you may want to avoid it if you are sensitive. It remains an issue to this day.\n\nTo the Owners: Please extend your weekend hours at least one hour. This neighborhood desperately needs a late night option that isn't King's Thai. Thank you!", "author": "Curt S."}

The place wasn't crowded, but as the night went on, more and more people came, and the place was getting packed. Considering it is a small place, the restaurant became crowded, and I noticed that around half of the orders were take-out, which makes sense given the small venue. The wait time for our food took a while, maybe 20-30 min, and it seemed like there were only a few servers and one or two cooks. The servers did come by to refill our waters frequently though, so that's a plus. As mentioned before, a good portion of orders were take out, so the cooks were probably cooking their orders as well, making the wait time a little longer. We decided to order family style so we could try more options.\n\nFood:\n\n- Pad Thai: The pad thai was good, and the portions are decent. The noodles were nice and tangy, making it even more delicious.\n\n- Thai rib: The sauce was nice and spicy, since it's topped with curry sauce. The vegetables were decent, and I wished the meat was more tender.\n\n- Kao pad: The portions were good, and I liked how there were a lot of veggies. The curry from the Thai rib went well with the rice. The rice itself was a little salty with the flavoring of soy sauce (I think) but overall, a very satisfying dish!\n\nOverall, the food was good for the price you're paying. The downside is the small venue (not much can be done about that) and the slow service. Either than that, I would come back if I'm in the area.", "author": "Lisa C."}

From the decor on the walls to the small kitchen that you must pass in order to get to the tiny bathroom, it brought back fond memories. \n\nNot to mention, the food was as authentic as food from a street cart in Bangkok.

It usually sets the tone of the quality of the restaurant. This was just OK.  Fairly bland and again, missing the traditional pad Thai flavor.

The first thing to come out was a bowl of rice, and that was after ONE HOUR. It shouldn't take an hour to make rice. You also have to request every time you need a refill of tea which is real stupid.

I had a bomb heaping of veggie fried rice with no egg and the kitchen paid close attention to the small details. Their coconut soup was incredible and they were able to make it vegan with no fish sauce. Speaking of fish sauce... \n\nThe service was great but I am reviewing the overall business so have to knock from five stars to one for blatantly lying on their menu about the \"vegetarian\" section. All/ many (I didn't ask) of these items contain fish sauce, which would make this section pescatarian NOT vegetarian (as it is labeled). Fish sauce contains fish, it's fish sauce. Our waitress defended the menu's mislabeling so much it seemed she was told the wrong definition of \"vegetarian,\" which was more concerning. I love and appreciate restaurants that label their menu to make it easy to understand what is and isn't vegan/vegetarian but this is making me wonder if I should be concerned other labels are blatant lies. Vegetarian means no meat- a fish is an animal, not an egg or a vegetable. Please fix this, Thai Time!! I just want to know what I can actually order so I can focus on the delicious flavor and not question what I'm eating. \n\nThere is fish sauce in all of their curries so if you're vegan or vegetarian you can't have any of the curries. \n\nThe yelp label \"vegetarians go crazy for this spot\" is based off of people reading the menu and believing their huge vegetarian section is actually vegetarian. I hope yelp speaks to the restaurant to fix their menu.

I really liked the rice and pad thai noodles/the bases of these dishes. The toppings/garnish were pretty standard~ I regret not ordering their curry lmao\n\nI recommend this place if you're having a casual lunch with a few friends and not looking to spend too much money on fancy food!", "author": "Yuzuki K."}

Everything about the experience was disappointing from the delivery time to the ultimate food that was delivered.\n\nThe original estimate was 45-60 minutes, but it actually end up taking 90 minutes to deliver. They didn't include any utensils or chili sauce as requested.\n\nWe ordered the Pad See Ew, green curry and stir fried green beans with red curry. \n\nBoth curry dishes were incredibly watery. As other reviewers pointed out, it's basically a soup. The green curry just had salt salt salt flavor...no complexity that you normally taste with green curry. The green beans had no flavor (there was also no red curry...)\n\nFinally the Pad See Ew was incredibly dry with a burnt flavor and the beef was rock hard and dry. \n\nThere are too many good Thai restaurants in this city to be ordering from a restaurant that clearly does not care about quality.", "author": "David S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-04", "description": "Early this year, I set up a goal to explore different neighborhoods and perhaps eat more ethnic food. To that end, T has been helping me to accomplish this goal in a way that has resulted an unexpected consequence. Walking, as opposed to driving, we have made an imaginary circle using the apartment as the center, and as time went on, the radius of coverage has expanded, and we walked further and further in Inner Richmond.\n\nT makes suggestions. I vet it, often via Yelp, to make sure that it is to my liking. TT came about that way. It's across from Halu, one of my earlier adventures into Inner Richmond. I had no idea that it was that close on foot when you lived on 7th, and I was surprised by how sleepy this hood gets after 7:30 pm. It's a mixed neighborhood, unlike Inner Sunset, Inner Richmond is less touristy. T explains that's because there are no restaurants right by the park, one must walk a few blocks to reach the commercial side of things, so it is more residential. I have known to run into people I know whenever I'm in Hayes Valley, downtown, SoMa and the Mission, and so far, I've been very lucky to not have done that thus far in this neighborhood, which of course, is a HUGE plus because privacy and personal space are very important aspects in achieving quality of life. When you can eat in peace,  you can start to appreciate the diversity this place offers. It's not just izakaya, there are Thai restaurants too. I learned quickly that that southeastern Asia cuisine is fairly good. This place is more than fairly good. It's in fact excellent.\n\nVegetarian curry is superbly done. T knows what I like to eat by now. I don't like too much curry too much coconut, it has to be just right. There is a delicate balance to strike and Thai Time seems to have executed it perfectly. I like good chicken wings. We got that for protein. Peanut sauce covered fried wings. What's not to like? Mango salad was my contribution to that evening's dinner menu. It has shrimp and squid, and it's milder than the papaya salad but I liked it more. Garlic rice is portioned just right. Get only one bowl to share with two people, it's very dense and flavorful. If you must kiss your companion after the meal, please brush your teeth and use mouthwash first.\n\nThe restaurant is very intimate. When we arrived there were quite a few seats available,  but by 8:30 it was packed full, with a few folks waiting outside.  I grabbed the seat facing out, so I could observe the occasional night dog walkers or the drunken crowd coming out of Halu.\n\nSatisfied with the meal, we took the long route back, finding suitable and relatively new restaurants along the way for future food expedition. I leave in a couple of days for Asia. My life is decidedly different than last year this time. I have been seeking for an enthused food companion for a long time now, perhaps forever. \n\nHere is the short version of my quest for that companion: I seek no commitment nor fidelity, but you must like this restaurant as much as I do.", "author": "Victoria E."}

It's a tiny Mom & Pop restaurant with a high traffic for take-out it seemed. Don't let the outside fool you, inside lies a gem... \n\nWe were seated immediately and took a look at the specials on the menu board and decided to start with their Thai Time wings. The wings are fried and saut\u00e9ed in a red curry sauce w/ fried basil leaves on top. This was spectacular. So much flavor in each bite and not your typical hot wing... I could've eaten a dozen by myself.  We also ordered the Mango Tango curry which was red curry w/ coconut milk, shrimp, scallops, calamari, mussels, bell pepper and more basil. This too was so good and I am not even a fan of Thai curries. The fried chicken breast and Thai fried rice rounded out the rest of our meal... again, everything was terrific. From where I was sitting, I was able to look right into the kitchen, and it seemed to be one older Thai lady doing all the cooking. Just as if you were at your Thai friend's house and their Mother was preparing dinner! Incredibly authentic, wholesome and just plain delicious... I am usually on the fence about Thai food, but when it's done like this, I would say I love it!\n\nService was prompt and friendly. Total came close to $60 with tax and tip (and 2 glasses of wine).

Came here on a Saturday at 725 p.m. with 5 people and there's really no hostess. It's a super super small place. 7 tables inside that could fit at most 25 people inside. You put ur name on the list that's on the outside of the door. The wait was about 30 minutes. We got seated inside that was a table for 4 people. They added a chair to the end of the table, which barely had any moving room. We were seated and then they asked us if we wanted to move over to the next table since it was a little roomier, so we did. There's two servers. They looked super stressed out dealing with 7 tables. We had to flag them down multiple times to get our order in. We ordered our food, got an appetizer and then our main meals. We asked for water, but didn't get any water until 20 mins after we ordered. It literally took 55 mins to get our food and our appetizer came out 5 mins before that. By this time, we were super hangry and getting real irritated. When you're super hangry and then you eat any food, it's suppose to taste like the best thing you've ever eaten. However, this was not the case with our food. I got the pad Thai tofu, which was probably one of the worst pad thais I've ever eaten. Not sure what people are raving about their food, but it is not good. They use a sauce bottle that my sister saw in their kitchen for their pad Thai (since you have to walk through their kitchen) in order to get to the small bathroom.  The reason for their poor service is because the servers are too busy dealing with their togo orders that people are ordering. They put that a priority before the people who are coming into the restaurant to eat. They could care less about their customers inside the restaurant. So overall, this place is a big NO NO for me. I will definitely not be returning ever. So if you want to wait to get seated and then wait even longer to get your food and get poor service, then this place is for you. If not, there's plenty of other restaurants that are so much better that I would rather go and enjoy.", "author": "Cat L."}

However, last night, I ordered thru Yelp, and got a confirmation back that it would take 45-60 minutes to deliver.  Cool....or so I thought.  At 60 minutes I went through the Yelp online message help center and a nice guy helped me.  He told me the restaurant had said it would take 90 minutes for my food (I wouldn't have ordered the food if I knew this upfront...and....I hadn't been told this upfront).  Then the Yelp guy tried to contact the restaurant.  He told me that he could not reach the restaurant directly, or the owner of the restaurant.  By this point, we were passed the 90 minute mark, probably close to 1 hour 45 minutes from the time I ordered.  The nice Yelp guy came back and told me that without the restaurant responding at all, he recommended canceling my order altogether, and refunding my money.  ARRGGGHHH....  OK...... what could I do or say?  The Yelp guy was nice, but, now it was almost 9:30 pm and I was very hungry.  No delivered food for me last night.

Thai Time is always the right time! I recently came here after picking up my new Iphone 5 (let the bashing begin) from the Radio Shack around the corner. It was around 9:45pm and the restaurant was closing down, but they graciously sat us down and treated us like it was 7:00pm and the dinner rush had just started. \n\nThis place is small! I mean probably one of the smallest sit down restaurant I have ever been to. There are around 5 tables. The restroom is all the way in the back. Cool thing about that is, you get to walk through their small kitchen. The people cooking your food looks like Thai moms, so you know it's about to be on like tampons. \n\nIt took my friend and I awhile to order as their menu is fairly large. After the WW2 that was going on inside my head, I finally settled with the angels wings to start and i know i know... pad thai. I had to! Everyone on yelp said it was the best and might as well start with the pad thai when visiting a Thai restaurant for the first time. Am i right folks? \n\nMorale of the story is, BEST PAD THAI EVARR! It was super flavorful, fresh, and perfectly cooked. Squeeze a bit of lime on top and mix with the shredded carrots and cabbage and just go to town on that thing like an 8 year old girl at a Justin Bieber concert. This is all fairly cheap and the Angels wings were angelic. \n\nOne complaint though. The cups for water are so small. Like 2 gulps small. They do keep refilling the water, but i feel really bad having the waitress come back every 5 minutes. \n\nEnough chit chatting. Head over there for some slap yo mama type of stuff Thai food.

Delivery guys were very nice and professional.\n\nThe Food:\nThai Time Combo ($10.95)- This was probably my least favourite dish. It is A LOT of fried food and I am not that into fried food. When I say a lot, I mean a ton of fried tofu, 2 huge egg roll, 2 big fried prawn, 4 huge fish cake and 2 of Garee Puff. Out of all these appetizer I would say the Garee Puff and the Fried Shrimp are the best.\n\nKao Pad Kra Prow ($7.95)- By my standards, this is good for the price. You get a HUGE portion, I got pork and there was meat in every bite. I didn't taste a lot of that typical grilled flavour I like in Thai fried rice, but it was fine. The bell peppers and onions were fresh and not overcooked.\n\nGang Keaw Pla Guy($7.95)- This was my favourite dish of them all. So much seafood and the curry was very spicy, even though I ordered medium. I can take a lot of spice so my suggestion, if you can too, the medium is perfect. The curry didn't have bitter taste, nor was it too salty. Great creamy taste, not oily at all.\n\nPumpkin Talay($9.75)- This is the sautee dish, not the curry. This was quite delicious. I never thought about pumpkin and seafood together but this dish balanced the two well. The pumpkin was cooked to perfection, and again, so much seafood I was not disappointed. Just so you know, the scallops in this dish are the baby scallops, not the huge ones which I think makes for a better dish because all the pieces are bite-sized.\n\nI will definitely order again if they will deliver to me :)", "author": "emma g."}

My daughter and I have a standard meal we always split and then my husband and I usually try something spicy. We had chicken satay with peanut sauce. The chicken was ok, the peanut sauce was good! We also had chicken pad Thai, which is my favorite, but not this one. It had no peanut flavor at all, and the chicken texture and taste was bad. I have no idea what the flavor was, but it is not a standard pad Thai flavor. My husband ordered the lunch plate with the red curry chicken and basil chicken. Red curry chicken is my other favorite Thai dish so I tried some of his. I thought it was just ok. It was bland, if that's even possible with curry, but it was. At that point, I decided not to try the basil chicken. I had so much hope for this being our new go to Thai, everything was great about it, except the food.", "author": "Stacey R."}

After a long day of running errands, we were hungry enough to eat anything. The only thing we didn't want to eat was food with flies in it. Well that's what we got.\n\nWe ordered two bowls of soup. She found the first small fly. At first it was difficult to tell it was fly, but upon further inspecting we could definitely see the legs. It was only one small fly, no big deal. We then found multiple flies in both of our soups. We never send anything back, but were disgusted at this point and called the waitress over. We pointed out a spoon with 3 flies on it. She took it to the chef/owner and showed it to him. They didn't think the things with legs on them were flies, but didn't offer a rebuttal to our claim. We weren't eating the soups at this point and asked for the bill. Graciously, they didn't change us for the fly soup.\n\nAs we were leaving, the owner/manager told us \"don't come back\". We weren't sure if that's what he said, and asked for clarification. He said yes, don't come back. We were astounded that he would say that, and said he was upset because we complained about a fly. We responded by saying there were multiple flies, and that's not okay. After a little back and forth, we were in a yelling match!! Obviously we will not be returning.

Of course, I'm a big fan of the lime/cilantro dressing that most Thai restaurants use on their salads.  Very yummy.\n\nThe \"house\" dish that I ordered was the Yum Moo Yang.  Surprisingly, this dish had a little spicy KICK.  It was almost reminiscent of spicy sausage.  Overall, I enjoyed it.\n\nThe \"house\" dish that I sampled was the Red Tilapia.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-08-15", "description": "In the all-too-Asian Richmond, it would be easy to assume that the level of regional food would be uniformly high.  With its uninspiring interpretations of Thai classics, Thai Time proves this a fallacy.\n\nLiterally a hole in the wall with fewer than ten glass-covered tables, it is obvious that Thai Time doesn't aspire to greatness.  Rather, it attempts only to be an inexpensive, neighborhood Thai place where diners can get in, get some decent, if unimaginative, food, and get out quickly without sacrificing their entire paycheck.  In this, it pretty much succeeds.  Albeit, diners should not expect more.\n\nAccompanied by the traditional peanut sauce and cucumber salad, the Chicken satay was fine, but could have featured a more flavorful marinade.  Although hearty and warming on a cold Richmond evening, the tom yung kung soup could have been spicier.  The pad Thai, a staple in any Thai restaurant, contained a paucity of prawns, and the noodles were egregiously overcooked.  Inexplicably, there was no jasmine rice available, but at least management had the foresight to offer brown rice.\n\nService was awkward and slow.  It was quite a while before the waitress took the order, and upon doing so, there seemed to be a difficulty in \"getting it.\"  The waitress incorrectly totaled the bill and nearly forgot to include some of the left overs in the take-home bag.\n\nAt Thai Time, look only for standards--pad Thai, satays, curries, etc.  Don't expect anything bordering on interesting--mieng kum (a favorite Thai self-made snack with spinach leaves, roasted peanuts and coconut, fresh lime, ginger, onion, and chopped Thai chili peppers) or anything that would require higher level kitchen skills (for example, tom yam pla, steamed sea bass, mushrooms, and tomatoes flavored with lemongrass and kaffir leaves.)  \n\nWith straightforward food and only fair service, Thai Time's saving grace is that its prices are reasonable, even by Richmond standards.  If you are seeking greatness, look elsewhere; for a quick Thai bite, Thai Time will suffice.", "author": "CJ G."}

That's over a year+ of many a night where I have nothing in my refridgerator and am craving something hot, quick, slightly spicy, and well... green!\n\nHaving sampled all the competitors in proximity, I must say\n\n* Tawan's Thai Food green curry is less than memorable.\n* Thai Noodle Jump loads theirs up on veggies, but gives little liquid. Plus they used to steal my friend's wi-fi, who used to live upstairs.\n* Beloved King of Thai gets it WAY too watery. Sorry, but you have been de-throned, at least on this dish.\n* Be my Guest is too expensive for mediocre Thai food, in general.\n\nThai Time's green curry wins for its perfect balance of meat of choice, bamboo shoots, basil leaves, and peppers. Also the flavor is the best, with a distinct fish sauce taste but not overwhelmingly so. The viscosity of the curry is thick and creamy. And the portion is big enough to last me three evenings total of empty fridges.\n\nI might even go as far as saying it's the best green curry I've had, ever. Buuuuut I understand there is life outside of the Inner Richmond. So I won't say it... yet.\n\nStill, well worth the trek.

I love that it comes with cabbage and green beans. Everything is also fresh and crunchy which is how this dish should always be. \n\nThe first time I came I got the kao soi (basically a curry noodle dish that I've been craving since I left Chiang Mai) and this was pretty close to the ones I ate in Thailand. They even given you a side of pickled veggies to go on top. The curry was flavorful and the noodles were great. \n\nAnother time, I got the the pad see ew. So awesome because it comes with broccoli and chinese broccoli. I never like broccoli in my pad see ew so it makes me happy to get some chinese broccoli. \n\nMy husband has gotten the curry and the pad thai and he's enjoyed both.\n\nThis is definitely our go-to place for Thai food in the Richmond and the portions are huge!

The room was nearly full, which was a good sign, and there was a table open for us, which was an even better sign.  \n\nThe room was fancifully decorated with carved and painted birds and fish, and with a tank of live goldfish.  It looked like there were about 6 tables, maybe 8, and the kitchen was doing both dine-in and take-out preparation.  \n\nThe waitress kept up with the crowd, and she made sure we had everything we wanted.  As this was our first visit, we decided to get our benchmark dishes.  Was this too pretentious?  Were we to order something we didn't know, and form an opinion from that?  They do have \"People Love Us On Yelp\" stickers in their windows, after all.  \n\nWe chose a chicken satay, pad thai, roasted duck on rice, and tea, for $28 + tip.  \n\nThe chicken satay was generous, 4 skewers fully loaded, with cucumber salad and a peanut sauce that was pure peanut.  This passed our screen with flying colors.  \n\nThe pad thai had the right texture, and the prawns were well cooked.  There was a scent in it that I wasn't used to, though, and I had a hard time adjusting to that.  The flavor was good, regardless of the smell.    \n\nThe roasted duck on rice came with tamarind, which was quite tasty.  I'm not a duck fan myself, so you can guess whose it was, but even for duck there seemed to be more fat and less meat that I would expect.  The tamarind was delicious.  \n\nWe left full and satisfied, but next time we're hungry for Thai food we'll opt for waiting for a table at our favorite place.", "author": "David D."}

YOU HAVE TO TRY IT. Fantastic SOUP! I'll call it Tom YUMMY gai I don't really enjoy soup, but this soup really got me. It's so full of flavor, I was scooping the bottom of the pot looking for more. The only bad thing was the chicken was over cooked. Very tough and chewy. The taste of the soup made up for it.\n\nMain Dishes: Red Pumpkin Seafood Curry. It was spicy but bland. That's a weird one. I could tell that there was spice, but I just couldn't get any flavor from it. It had calamari, mussels, and shrimp. \n\nSauteed Deep Fried Chicken with carrots, cashews, onions, and mushrooms ( i forgot the name, but its on the main dish page) This dish was my favorite of the two main dishes. The chicken was crunchy because of the deep frying and had lots of flavor, HOWEVER I think it was the same batch as the chicken from my soup. Very tough and overcooked. Still, okay because the flavor was on point.\n\nSticky rice is only $1.50 so i got that. One serving of rice is good enough to feed one person. For women, you might have a little extra left over. My sticky rice was really sticky for some reason. I had to use my fork and my soup spoon to cut a chunk of rice off, but hey thats sticky rice for you. \n\nDessert: Mango Sticky rice for the gf.

It's not the best thai i have ever had, but it is pretty good & worth repeating!

The place was small but had a very inviting and cozy atmosphere. Cute. I went for the lunch combo that, for $7.95, came with a cup of soup, two entrees (from a list of 14), and a nice serving of jasmine rice. The nom-worthy soup featured a respectable amount of tofu, carrots, mushrooms, cabbage, and egg flowers. My two selected dishes, Pad Plik King and Pad Pak Gra Prow (both tofu dishes with assorted veggies), were also quite tasty. \n\nI also witnessed some awesome kindness on the employees' part when a (presumed) poor, Asian lady came in and offered a few bucks for some soup with minimal ingredients. I didn't see if they accepted the cash, but they did take more than a few minutes to prepare some soup (i.e. not sinkwater) in a take-out container and gave her some tea. Well played, Thai Time.

Unfortunately though, while they didn't exactly fail in any sort of way, I still left a bit disappointed by the experience.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty tight, but they manage to seat about 20 people give or take, so it's a very intimate sort of feel.  I have to admit, the menu is surprisingly extensive despite the restaurant's size.  In order to get a taste of a variety of things, our table of four decided to start off with a couple of appetizers in addition to our own plates.  The Thai Time combo was the first to arrive, and it's perfect for you if you love fried food - egg rolls, fried fish cake, fried tofu, fried shrimp roll, and fried samosas?  Yeah, definitely a fried food lover's best fried...I mean, friend.  We also got an order of Angel Wings, but it was a bit different than I had expected.  Rather than chicken wings served with a sort of glaze/sauce, it's two wings that are attached to pieces of chicken meat, and then fried.  Sort of like those giant shrimp balls you would find at dim sum restaurants.  Overall, it was all just okay - basically, just a bunch of fried oily food.  The samosas were the best of the bunch by far, and the Angel Wings weren't terrible, just not what I had in mind considering we had already gotten a platter of fried food.\n\nAs for my entree, I wanted to stick with something simple, so I ended up with the Yellow Curry Chicken to satisfy my craving.  The portion was quite generous, as it was loaded with chicken, onions and potatoes, so kudos for that.  Even more so for the tastiness.  I didn't get to try what a couple of my friends had ordered, but I did get to sneak a bite of the Pad Thai dish my other friend had ordered.  She read it was supposed to be unique since they use coconut milk (?), but I didnt really taste a strong flavor of it.  Either way, it definitely did taste different than your run of the mill pad thai, but I dont think I had enough to really say if it was better or not.\n\nThe service was rather prompt, and they were certainly friendly enough.  Overall, the food was decent and I wouldn't rule out coming back.  That said though, I'm not sure if I would make it a point to do so...not when I could just find my way over to Marnee Thai.", "author": "Mike L."}

My husband and I have been eating here since we moved to the neighborhood almost 3 years ago and absolutely loved their green curry.  We've introduced countless friends & family members to their food - you can imagine my shock and anger last night when placing an order for takeout, I verified - as I have done for every single order I've placed there - this order is all vegetarian so no fish sauce, etc, - I was told that the green & red curries already have fish sauce in them and can't be made without.  So disappointed and angry that in 3 years of ordering here, this is the FIRST time this was the answer I was given.\n\nDon't call it a \"vegetarian menu\" if many of the items on it are not.  And when someone asks you whether something contains fish sauce, if you don't know the answer, find out - and answer honestly.  Because if it didn't matter and wasn't so important, we wouldn't be asking.\n\nSorry Thai Time - you just lost some of your most loyal diners.", "author": "N. J. K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-13", "description": "Sunday was a beautiful day. Such a wonderful day to take a drive to the City and soak in the sun. My girls wanted to hit the Exploratorium. And we were hungry for lunch. After writing 13 reviews - yes, I'm just a Yelp beginner, folks - I thought , alright, I'm going to put Yelp to work finally and find good Thai. This literal \"hole in the wall\" turned up as one of three Thai restaurants in the City with a 4.5 rating. (No 5 rating places, by the way.) We actually tried to go to one of the \"other\" 4.5 places right around the corner on Geary, but lucky for us, it was closed. Thai Time did not disappoint! No way! Great stuff here folks!\n\nUpon walking through the door, the first thing I thought was - oooh, wow, pretty small. I think my master bedroom is bigger than the dining area! My wife counted enough seats for, hmmm, maybe 26 \"small\" patrons. Luckily I'm one of those small patrons - yah, right! Hah! Do I 'eat to live', or do I 'live to eat'? Uhhhhh, hmmmm, I think the latter! Don't let the small surroundings scare you away, 'cause it'll be your loss!\n\nOkay, time to order. The soft-spoken server made several recommendations, almost all of them seafood (I think they might specialize in seafood). But my family wasn't in the mood for seafood today, so we tried the following:\n\n- Satay (chicken), as an appetizer\n- Tofu Tod, as an appetizer\n- Gang Dang (beef), as an entree\n- Gang Garee Gai, as an entree\n- Moo Yang, as an entree\n\nDelightful food! The Satay was solid in taste. My little one loved it, so I think it was right on the money. The tofu was also very good, cut in a smaller, triangular 3-dimensional shape than you're used to in other Thai restaurants, and we counted this as yet another plus, because they were bite-size for the kids. Delightful appetizers!\n\nNow for the entrees. My wife felt strongly that we specify the dishes to be \"mild\", because she believes that you'll find more \"truly\" spiced Thai in the City, as opposed to Thai fare in the burbs. I think she was right. The \"mild\" Gang Dang had a tiny \"kick\" to it, but I didn't mind. I loved it. And, I usually don't like bamboo shoots, but the Gang Dang had the shoots cut thinner than usual, and they complemented my meal fine. The Gang Garee Gai is your typical Yellow Curry Chicken - delicious here at Thai Time. The potatoes, in particular, were cooked well, teaming with the onions and savory yellow sauce to make the chicken dance on your taste buds. And the Moo Yang was great too - your typical honey-grilled-pork, but satisfying with every bite. Delightful entrees!\n\nUhhhh, we're not done yet! There's dessert too. The sticky rice and mango was just right. Outside of the Philippines, I seldom eat mangoes, but the one on the plate today was sweet and enjoyable for me. We also had the peculiar \"Roti\". I was curious about this, 'cause I thought Roti was Indian, not Thai. The server returned with the Roti, explaining that this was their \"Thai\" version, and what a yummy dessert it was! Thin, moist yet crispy (on the edges) bread, covered with condensed milk and sugar. Wow! Delightful desserts!\n\nIn the end, I give Thai Time 4.5 STARS. Wonderful Thai food. Attentive service. Much better than my usual \"burb\" Thai cuisine, but then again, this is City Thai, right? Whenever I'm back in the area, I'll definitely return to sample something new from their extensive menu.

A plus is that it is pretty cheap, and they have a fairly extensive menu. We ordered angels wings, beef pad see ew, and chicken panang curry. You really can't go wrong with the angels wings, anything fried is always delicious.\nI take my pad see ew pretty seriously, and the pad see ew was fair. The beef in the pad see ew was overcooked, and  the rest of the noodle dish was ok, but lacking in flavor (nothing a little hot sauce doesn't help). The panang curry was pretty good, loaded with chicken, which was nice, but could have used some more sauce, and again, more spice (again, hot sauce helped a lot here).

First we were greeted very nicely to walk in and see a very cute small restaurant with about 10 tables. We were seated right by the kitchen and scanned the menu for a while. We ordered the Appetizer combo plate which was so yummy! Loved the deep fried shrimp, and fish cakes were absolutely fantastic, they made my mouth water for more. Everything on the plate was delicious including the sauces- one a peanut sauce and the other a hot and sour. I also ordered the gang garee ghai (yellow curry with sliced chicken and potatoes) while my boyfriend had ordered the thai time fried rice which came with calamari, scallops, and shrimp in it. We shared and were totally stuffed by the time we finished half of ours. I also had 2 thai iced teas which were absolutely delicious.

And we too had a very nice dinner there, good service, pleasant experience all around.  Large party of people, seated right away - service was prompt and attentive throughout the evening (I've never had so many tea refills!  Excellent!!)  Very small place though, a bit on the dark side, but has that quaint family comfortable feel that I like.\n\nFirst off, they have a very extensive menu that includes a lot of vegetarian options, non-deep-fried itemry, and stuff that doesn't have egg or coconut milk. For us that's a plus.  And they have hot thai tea, another big plus. We ate larb (chicken) to start, which was excellent.  Then we had the eggplant and chicken dish that included basil - this dish was good, but could have used a bit more sauce or flavor or something. Then we had an excellent dish that included steamed pumpkin with a bunch of seafood (mussels, scallops, prawns, calamari) - this one was truly excellent. Very light (it was steamed), but it had a flavorful broth. Would definitely order again.  All our dishes were reasonably priced too.\n\nWe didn't try the other dishes at the table (we don't eat red meat or big-time deep fried items, and the rest were pretty much those). Apparently the beef salad was excellent (in a lime juice that was apparently great), and the pad thai was enjoyed. One of our group got the Thai Time sampler, and that is a huge plate of heavily deep-fried food. If you're into that, apparently it's good but you might want to share with a group as it's a ton of food!", "author": "Jen D."}

There are about 10 tables in this tiny restaurant, but I never felt crowded there.  The decor is soothing and one can look out the front windows seeing the world pass by on 8th.\n\nThe food was quite good but I widh I had chosen different dishes.  Unfortunately the dishes I tried were very similar, so I'm not sure if it's the restaurant that was lacking range or my choices.  I'm willing to bet it was my choices, but I'll have to wait until I visit again before upgrading my rating.\n\nThe menu item that first caught my eye (actually my wife's eye, I liked the description) was the Red or Green Seafood Curry with Pumpkin.  I love pumpkin and thought it would be interesting with seafood.  I opted for the red curry, but wished I'd chosen the green curry later because the rest of our dishes were red curry dishes.  The dish included squid, bay scallops, two prawns and two mussels.  The sauce went very well with the seafood and the pumpkin, but I wouldn't get it again.  The squash like texture of the pumpkin didn't work with the seafood for me, but the flavors did go well together.\n\n     We also got the Crispy Tofu which was absolutely wonderful.  I've never had tofu prepared quite like this before.  The outer skin was pan fried to be slightly crispy.  The dish featured a red curry based sauce with some mushrooms and was topped with Thai basil.  This was a very wonderful dish and I'd love to have it again.\n\n     Lastly we had their red curry which was wonderful.  It was fairly representative of most excellent red curry dishes with possibly a little more bamboo shoot than usual.  The flavor was very enjoyable.\n\n     The menu has a separate vegetarian section which I like.  Unlike other Thai restaurants I frequent, there wasn't any indication of which dishes were spicy.  I usually like something between medium and hot and I found the dishes here were very well spiced.\n\n     The other thing about Thai Time is that their dishes are very reasonably priced.  Most of the vegetarian dishes were $5.95 each and the seafood and pumpkin dish was only $8.95.  Thai time has very good food and is an outstanding value.", "author": "Tony P."}

However after a rather uncomfortable and unfortunate side effect of my food one night, I stopped ordering from here. Until today...\nSo now it has been about seven years, and I finally worked up the nerve and the stomach to order Thai food from Thai Time once again. \nI really like their menu; they have a lot of tasty sounding dishes i.e. the green fried rice and the Gai Himmaparn. I decided to order the Gang Dang, no no not because it has such a rad name, but because the combination of chicken, spicy red curry, coconut milk, bamboo shoots, Japanese eggplant ,bell pepper and sweet basil...Yum. And the Garee Puff; deep-fried saut\u00e9ed sweet potato and onion; served with peanut sauce and cucumber salad... also yum. \nSo order in and excited for Thai food, my doorbell rings 17 minutes later. There's no way this could be the Tai food.....but wait....IT IS!  So for the super fast and efficient delivery of hot tasty smelling Thai food I give Thai Time at least 2 stars.\nHuge Portions of the curry dishes. The gang dang was good, spicy the way a red curry should be. The eggplant was soft and not bitter, but the chicken was not my thing. I am a picky meat eater, I like boneless, white meat chicken cooked very well done. The chicken was a lot of dark meat and just tasted like slimy chicken. So once I took out the chicken, I totally enjoyed my dish. I will definitely order tofu next time. \nAs for the Garee Puffs, they were good fried little triangle pouches with some tasty pasty insides and the peanut dipping sauce was also good.\nMy brother order the Yellow curry which he said was good but not as curry-ee as he likes. He said it just tasted watered down. \nSo now it has been almost an hour since eating and all is quiet on the western front. Should conditions change I will update this review but as for now I give Thai Time 3 stars", "author": "Kelle K."}

In some ways then Thai Time Restaurant fits this description perfectly (it's small). In other ways, however, Thai Time is not small. The dishes for example are quite large - the deep fried tofu I ordered came crashing (not literally) down on my table like an avalanche of triangles. And the follow up - a red curry boat weighted itself much like an Ocean Liner. Also not small was the flavor (a dazzling balance between just enough hot and just as much spicy) which left me feeling warm but not on fire, and the refills, which turned my (small indeed) tea cup into a bottomless well of hot (but not enough to burn) Thai tea. \n\nAdd to this the decor, which crammed as many Thai signifiers as possible into space that (as I might have mentioned) is not much larger than Thailand is when found on a map, the staff, who were super friendly and constantly appearing at my table (one of a total six) (with the refills) , and the prices: (you guess it) tiny.

I was disappointed recently when I took my girlfriend there on 2/14/12. The tofu in 2 dishes they served us was sour, like it had gone rancid.  I told the server and he went to the kitchen and came back to basically deny anything was wrong with the food. I thought it would have been professional for them to mark down the check or comp us one of the dishes.  Nope, they just  served up the full bill as they had the sour tofu. I wasn't in the mood to make a fuss, so I let it go. If they recognized me as the  loyal, regular customer I am, perhaps they would have done the right thing. But they didn't.

I live a few blocks away and got a call  as soon as I got in the door from picking up food on my second visit only to find the phone ringing from the restaurant informing me that they had given me the wrong order. I had to go back, which is understandable, but, they never apologized, said sorry for the  inconvenience or really any verbal acknowledgment what so ever!. Not even an utterance!  Even on the phone they really said just  that my order  was  still at the restaurant and that I had to return if I wanted my original food.  (Me, I would have apologized to the guest several times, and offered to deliver it, as it was the restaurant mistake).Upon returning,they just handed me a bag and I turned around and I left.  This is ok. Stuff happens. But for a second time in a row, the food was dry, had  little if any flavor and was cold, and the portions are somewhat small. The Pad Keow Mow noodles were sparse, and had no flavor. I was surprised as the reviews are all pretty good. There are so many other better places to go around this area, so think about  going to the others first. If this was just a one time occurrence I could excuse it. But it wasn't. Two times in a row? Come on, at least fake it!  So, this was my two-time experience at this  establishment. Maybe it is better to dine in? But, upon looking around the second time I went back, I have concerns about cleanliness. I worked restaurants through college and know that if the front isn't kept \"tidy\" and  neat/clean then  you really need to rethink what the back is like.

It's in my neighborhood, I've known the owner for a long time, and there's plenty more I could say about it.\n\nBUT, looking a little further a field and thinking about Thai food all around San Francisco, there are only a few other restaurants that ever come to my mind to visit. One of them, perhaps the top of the list, has to be Thai Time: 315 8th Avenue, between Clement and Geary Blvd. It's one of those small, family-run places that specialize in good service and great food.\n\nTake the fish cakes for example. To begin with, the cakes are at least 1/3 larger than what you'll see in most places. And, they're thicker than most you'll see as well. The texture is perfect with just a slight chewy-ness, but crisp on the outside. The flavor is next to none with just a bit more than a hint of seafood flavor, basil, and spices. The cucumber sauce that goes with it has just a little sweetness with medium-sized diced vegetables. You won't find a better tad mun in San Francisco! Besides the fish cakes, their Thai egg rolls are flavorful and packed with vegetables and come with a delicious, slightly peppery sauce. The chicken saut\u00e9 is tender with no skin or fat, and it comes with what my wife insists is the finest peanut sauce of any Thai restaurant in the city.\n \nFor the soup, we had a coconut milk soup with chicken and vegetables. We asked for it hot, and it came hot. REAL hot! In my book, that's the way it should be. When a person asks for hot, that's what they should get, and too often restaurants today are afraid to serve anything really hot.\n\n \nMain dishes are equally good, although they are relatively typical of what you will find in other Thai restaurants in the city. We had a noodle dish with vegetables and chicken, beef with more of that luscious peanut sauce, duck with a curry sauce and lots of vegetables, and pineapple fried rice. The pineapple rice was the hit of the evening for me with the slightly tart pineapple completely breaking through any potentially oiliness of a fried rice dish.\n\n \n\nWe were all so stuffed that desert just wasn't an option on this visit. Maybe next time, and there will certainly be a next time.\n\n \n\nGood, flavorful, and plentiful food is hard to beat. You'll get all of this with plenty of beverage selection at Thai Time. Try it soon, and I don't think you'll be disappointed.", "author": "Chris G."}

After living in Thailand for 1/2 year, I can tell you that eating at Thai Time brings me right back to Chiang Mai.\n\nThe restaurant is owned by a Thai couple; the wife is from Chiang Mai and so they have some dishes that you will not find in many other Thai restaurants.  I suggest you try the Khao Sawy which is like a curry, except with noodles and chicken in it, too.  It is a northern dish and 99 percent of Thai restaurants do not have it.\n\nOther than that, they do have anything and everything, unless it's something that just can't be found on this side of the globe.

If your a Richmonder, such as my self, or you are looking for a reasonable, cozy, and impressively delicious date spot you need to go here. Its basically a living room of an old house with only about eight tables and none of them seating more than four people. They play fairly authentic sounding southeastasian music which I appreciate since I hate going to pronpiquity specific restaurants and hearing aesthetically vacous pop music from nonrelated regions. The most impressive thing that any seafood or curry lover MUST have is the seafood coconut curry. I seriously can not stress this enough, its phenominal particularly for the low price of $11. The top of a coconut is lopped of and then the shell is filled with a variety of delicious sea creatures including calamari and the coconut curry. Then artfully arranged on the top of the beheadded coconut is an array of mussels in shell, little crab claws, and prawns. The point is it looks awesome, tastes fantastic, and its freakin cheap. The other menu items are quite good as well and go great wiith a Singha, which I still prefer to Chang, though they seem to be promoting that beer now.
