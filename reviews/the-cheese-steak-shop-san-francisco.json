Today was my first time visiting the CSS. There were two signs that indicated this may not be a bad experience. First, I saw they used Amoroso rolls. That's half the battle with making a good cheesesteak. The second sign was hearing the sounds of the cook actually chopping the steak. \n\nI ordered the classic. It's was a pleasure to eat. While it's not as good as my favorite spot back home, this place absolutely does justice to the art of making a cheesesteak. It's pretty comparable to most places in Philly if I'm being honest. \n\nDefinitely will be back when I have that urge for a taste of home!!!!", "author": "Shannon G."}

It's definitely an older casual, fast-food style place with no frills. There are a few locations around the Bay Area, though this is the only one in SF. \n\nMy favorite is the Motown Philly--the combination of mushrooms, provolone cheese, and the steak for me is a home-run. The bread is nicely soft and chewy making it easier to manage eating. Loved that my friend got the sweet peppers on the side; they were pretty similar in taste to pickles to cut through the richness.\n\nWhat's also nice is that they have a couple sides to choose from: onion rings, curly fries, sweet potato fries....have each person in your party get a different one so you can steal each other's! hehe. \n\nI'm not around this area much but if you happen to be craving a philly cheesesteak around here, it's the place to go!", "author": "Clarissa C."}

It's the kind of food that if you eat it once, you will crave it often. \n\nThe shop works as a fast-food place in which you place your order at the cashier and wait for your name to be called to get your delicious food. \n\nMy recommendation is to get the \"Guylic\" Cheese Steak with all the topping (onions, green peppers, and red peppers), with a side of steak fries. The cheesesteak is juicy, tasty, and very well seasoned. It's a party for your taste buds. The cheese is really good and the beef is just perfect, all that enveloped by a soft bun. \n\nThey have amazing sides, so if you come with someone else, try as many as you can.\n\nPortions are super big. They have a loyalty stamp card. Remember to bring it. Tuesdays and Sundays you get double stamps. They also have other deals in other days of the week. \n\nLunch hour is bit full here. The wait is not super long and it is really worth it.", "author": "Andr\u00e9ia S."}

Anyhoo, here goes:\n\n1.) \"This place is gross and dirty!\"\n\nFirst off, it's not actually that dirty. It may become dirty when it fills up with people, but right now all the tables are clean and it's about as tidy as a place like this can be.\n\nSecond off... Where the hell have you people been getting your cheesesteaks? The shop is supposed to be old and dingy. That's how you know the food is good! If you want more sparkle in your atmosphere, you may want to consider a sushi bar.\n\n2.) \"The staff are unprofessional!\"\n\nMy experience here may differ because I beat the rush, but I can't see a source for complaint here. The woman behind the register was sweet and polite. The gentleman behind the grill was a little gruff, but not rude. \n\n3.) \"There's no cheese!\"\n\nNow to be honest I agreed with this one at first, but upon closer inspection it turns out that there actually is cheese on the sandwich... It's just fused to the bread so it looks like mayo. Not exactly a defense, but at least there's an explanation.\n\n4.) \"It's too expensive!\"\n\nUhhhh... Again I find myself asking, where the hell have you people been eating?! This is San Francisco, guys. Everything is expensive here these days, and that includes lunch. I got a small sandwich, an order of chips, and a drink for about $9. That's not expensive for SF, unless you use McDonalds as a standard... And if that's your metric, for the love of all that is holy, WHY ARE YOU ON YELP?!\n\n***\n\nThat said, one thing I will agree with is that for a cheesesteak my sandwich was pretty barren. The fillings were tasty, but there was almost no cheese and... How can I put this delicately? My hands are clean right now. I can type on my smartphone and the screen isn't going berserk. That's not usually the case after I've consumed a cheesesteak. Normally there's grease, onions, cheese residue, and bits of meat all over the place. If I'm not making a mess, my instinct is to think that there's not enough stuff in the sandwich.\n\n Apparently the sandwiches were not always barren here, so I'm guessing they've cut back on their fixin's as an alternative to raising prices.

I mean, it is a business after all and focus should be on the customer)\n\n-Line forms fairly quick, especially during the lunch hours so don't expect to be in and out (25min in my experience)\n\n-During the rush it seemed like there wasn't much communication and a few staff members, 1 of whom I'd think was the manager, kept on with their conversation instead of lending a hand to help move the traffic.\n\n-Going back to the last comment - the 2 staff that were chatting while the store was slammed finally stopped whatever they were discussing when they saw an attractive woman in line / kicked out the cashier that was sweating while taking orders over the counter and the phone so they could assist her... whatever, but as a bystander it just looks bad. (unprofessional/perverted/no team-morale) \n\n-Food rocks, no doubt about it and probably is the only thing that keeps people coming back.\n\n2 stars is a fare rating - 1 for the food, 1 for the overworked staff\n\nImprovements: \n\n1. clean up the place (I did notice the scorecard with the '90' on it - definitely isn't)\n2. hire more competent staff / educate on customer perception\n3. put in a better/more efficient process for those rush-hours (will lose a ton of money by not doing so)\n4. possibly remodel the floor plan?

I know what an awesome cheese steak is supposed to taste like.. Call me a cheese steak snob, I've been THIS resistant, for this VERY reason.\n\nBut that day... I was willing to give it a chance. I mean how baaaad could it get? Boy was I wrong...\n\nBut my boss had owed me lunch and was craving a cheesesteak and asked if I wanted to try it. I had this look on my face while he tried to call the place to place an onder.. I was standing next to him and he said they told him to hold on... and he gave up after being on hold for almost 5 minutes. Hung up and asked me to call.... and the samething happened. After that, I should've taken that sign and gotten the heck out of dodge... \n\nSo I googled them and found out that they take online orders, so I went ahead and made an order online. 4 sandwiches in total, and told them I wanted BBQ sauce on the side since we had ordered a bunch of curly fries... I printed out the order and gave it to my coworker who was going to pick up the orders.... Now imagine if I didnt print out the order for my coworker... when he had gotten there, they claimed that we had only ordered 3 sandwiches... if the total was $40ish at about $10 each, how is it that I ONLY ordered THREE and NOT FOUR? \n\nOkay fine. People make mistakes.... they made the 4th one. Problem fixed.\n\nMy coworker came back and told me that my sandwich, that I had asked for BBQ sauce on the side, MAY have the BBQ on the INSIDE of my sandwich since there isnt a side of BBQ sauce in the bag... I opened my sandwich, and there it was.. BBQ INSIDE my cheesesteak UGHHH.\n\nOk now.. when you have a area on your online ordering system that says \"special requests\" and you dont fulfill such requests, what is exactly the point of having it on there? \n\nI open up my sandwich... and there is no cheese at all. Yep. They gave me a cheese steak, with NO cheese. When I ate it, it was like biting into shreds of cardboard and with half the amount of meat that I would normally get if I were to have gotten one from my hometown. \n\nPlease San Francisco and do yourselves the favor and don't think this is what a real cheese-steak is supposed to taste like. \n\nJust run... far far away from here fellow San Franciscans.

The place can get uber busy at lunch but the line moves quick.  I knocked down a 10\" King Philly with extra meat, delicious!  And some butterscotch Tastykakes finished off the meal.  As a bonus, the Cheese Steak shop was giving out free sodas for the Phillies win in the World Series, go Phils!  They've got a bunch of other steak options with grilled onions, peppers (hot-sweet), mushrooms, garlic and marinara sauce, all are ridiculously good and fattening...\n\nOutside of a cross-country trip to the City of Brotherly Love, the Cheese Steak Shop is as good as it gets in SF.

When we received our order, we got an Italian Hoagie, Zesty Veggie, Fries, and Rings.

Then as we waited longer, there was no Philly Cheese Steak - went to the pickup counter, and they never placed the order.\n\nBF gets back in line for the second time - orders Philly Cheese Steak and Hoagie Cheese Steak cause he still wants to get what he planned to order in the first place. This time, he gets the order and gets the Philly Cheese Steak only. He checks the receipt again, the cashier never placed the order for the Hoagie. Granted, we should have checked the receipt before, but we gave the cashier the benefit of the doubt.\n\nNow, mistakes are okay - we all make them, but the cashier was rude about it. She started lecturing him on how he should have made it clear he wanted two separate sandwiches, cause all she kept hearing was cheese steak and assumed one. \n\nAlready the first time around, when they didnt get the order, I feel like the guys cooking or the cashier should have done something to speed up the process for us to get back in line. My bf had to get back in line, which was long, to re order. We pretty much spent the most of our time there waiting for the food to be right.\n\nOn top of it all, our onion rings were completely burnt and all the rings were stuck together and hard, couldn't even take them apart to eat them - why would you serve it out to your customers like that!\n\nOkay, so the food is pretty good, but after this experience, we're pretty scarred.

Their cheesesteaks are kinda good but not great, but it's a couple of blocks away so it was my go-to place if I was too lazy to make food. They also have this Philly Guylic sandwich that I really like, and if you order it you get 1/2 off any side and a fountain drink. I've been getting that a lot lately.\n\nI went in awhile ago and got my usual, that combo special I just mentioned. Instead of being $10 and some change like usual, it was $13 and some change. I mention that to the cashier and he told me \"oh you only get 1/2 off on Wednesdays\". The sign for that special mentioned nothing about that, it mentions that any side is 1/2 off ALSO on Wednesdays. So I'm like \"what the hell\" and change my order to just a 10\" plain garlic cheesesteak so I'm not paying almost $14 for lunch.\n\nWhen I get my order, I ask to talk to the manager so I can ask about why I was going to get charged so much for that thing I've ordered multiple times already. Now here's the part where I got pissed. The manager WOULD NOT listen to what I was telling him, he just kept pointing to my receipt and reiterating that I ordered a regular garlic cheesesteak and not the special. After 3-4 repeated attempts to say \"I know, BUT, I changed my order because it was going to be over $13 and it's usually a bit over $10, and that's what I'm asking about\" and him pointing to what I ordered (I already KNOW what I ordered, dude) and saying it's different. YEAH, I KNOW IT'S DIFFERENT. I CHANGED IT. I TOLD YOU THAT THREE TIMES ALREADY.\n\nAfter nearly 3 minutes of trying to get him to listen to what I was actually saying I just gave up and left.

That being said, I felt the steaks were a little stingy - probably to get away with the 'extra meat' option.  You shouldn't need to order extra meat on a Cheesesteak.  A Cheesesteak should be oozing (oozing!) with gooey cheesey meat.

Some colleagues decided to call for a lunch gathering here and I agreed to join in.  I was told to be there by 11:30am because they said the lunch crowd can be overwhelming, but that was not the case yesterday.  It could be because of it being a holiday week but I understand why it could get busy because of two hospitals (Kaiser and UCSF Mount Zion) being within a few blocks, along with other medical offices.\n\nI ordered the 10-inch deluxe which, according to the menu, had a few variety of cheese and mushroom.  It was an enjoyable meal, especially with the peppers I requested for.  A colleague ordered some fries that we shared, which in my mind was nothing fancy.\n\nOverall, for under $7 before tax, I'd say if given a choice of this or a foot-long Subway sandwich this will be the choice most of the time.

After ordering, I waited on a stool right next to the counter for an hour for my sandwich.  They called name after name, but not mine.  Finally I asked them where my sandwich was, and it turned out the sandwich had been sitting right there on the counter for 40 minutes, without them ever calling my name.

Just by how quick the line got and the time that it was (around 3:00 pm) I figured this place would get a lot busier once people went for dinner,\n\nSomething told me not go get a simple cheese steak from here so I decided to get a chicken philli with bacon and steak cut fries. My friend got the regular beef cheese steak and the first thing I noticed was how small the portions were. Sure, I could have gotten the biggest size sandwich, but I thought the 10 inch would be enough... it wasn't\n\nAfter trying some of my friend's sandwich and vice-versa, we both realized the chicken cheese steak was better than the beef.\n\nJust by how full it got after ordering, I can already tell that this place has a lot of people who find it delicious but not me.. its ok.\n\nI guess I just expected a giant cheese steak that could barely stay within the buns, but not this place..", "author": "Roberto B."}

After a thrilling chase that included some impressive maneuvering (such as calling in the order and picking it up), I had lunch by the jugular.  As I waited for lunch to cool down to an edible temperature, the sandwich's pulse slowed, and eventually stopped.  Ripping open the paper wrapped tube, it was uncut.  Eff.  I had to tear it in half with my hands.  Though there was not a wounded gazelle's chance of escape, eating sandwiches half at a time makes me feel like a la-dy.  After spitting out the fiberous, chewy, woody stem sections, the rest of the sandwich was ok.  It did not have a lot of flavor.  Or I am having trouble tasting.  I added some Beliezian hot sauce which was delicious.  But the sandwich lacked a certain something.  \n\nThere is something wrong with me lately.  I don't like it traditional.  I don't like the usual.  I'm thinking outside of the box.  In some places, like Philly, I'm sure that kind of attitude could get me shot.  Or worse, I could be denied service.  \n\nToday, I did the usual thing to make sure something tastes good: I waited until I was really hungry, nearly faint from the fatigue and exhaustion.  And then I called in a order to the Cheese Steak Shop.\n\nOriginally I was going to have some pot noodles of the instant variety, with a hard boiled egg and the egg was already being de-natured.  But suddenly I realized that I had the car!  Oh joy, oh joy, I had the car and somewhat possessed the ability to drive.  As far as the state of California is concerned, I had the right to drive.  And I was going to do it!\n\nThe woman on the phone was very informative regarding the amount of meat on the sandwiches.  I think the 7\" was 3.5 oz whereas the 10\" was 4oz.  and then if you wanted to add more to that....something about being $2.50 more....Math...not my strong point.  Not something I'd like to be caught in a dark alley, alone, doing Maths.\n\nI got the 10\" Mushroom steak with onions and hot peppers.  Why is it that there are so many pepper-stem sections?  I ate at least 3 in my sandwhich.  The stem section is the slice that contains the stem-stubby bit that attaches the pepper to the plant before it was marinated and turned in to food.  The stem section is woody, fiberous, chewy and detracts from the otherwise soft, juicy, melty, gooey cheese steak.  It's like a public service announcement in the middle of church.\n\nI hopped in the car, in the rain, and made my way over there.  Luckily I found parking right off of Sutter.  The sandwich was ready.  I handed over the $1.50 off coupon and my stamp-card.  Apparently I can only get a stamp if I purchase $7 or more, but the woman let it slide this time. \n\nI skipped back to the car, drove home as quickly as I dared and sat in the living room to enjoy the kill.  \n\nAnd it was a bit mealy, floppy, gooey, soggy.  But sometimes floppy is good.  Some people like floppy.  But floppy wasn't the problem.  Maybe I didn't wait until I was hungry enough?  Maybe I don't want a traditional sandwich?", "author": "Christina C."}

The flavor of the philly was pretty tasty.  The mushrooms were a nice addition and the cheese was perfect...not too much where it overwhelmed the sandwich.  It was DEFINITELY great with the peppers...a perfect balance of sweet and spicy for me. I loved that the hot peppers were just spicy enough for a little zing and not overly spicy, where I couldnt tasted my food.  \n\nThe 7\" was perfect for lunch...and I probably could've done without the extra meat, because everyone else's didn't look skimpy, like some of the other yelpers commented about.

What's strange is that at pretty much the same time I lost my taste for it, friends of mine became obsessed.  Well, there's just some shit that can't be forgiven, such as:\n\n1.  I've ordered provolone every time I've been to the Shop.  American cheese is a Barack Obama-nation.  As I said in my old review, sometimes they would forget to put provolone on the sandwich, but they would always remake it.  Towards the end of my career eating at the Shop, they always gave me the wrong cheese.  How fucking tweaked out are these employees that they can't read a simple receipt?\n\n2.  The last few times I was there, the meat tasted really gamey.  Either it was old, undercooked, or under seasoned.  The first time I chalked it up to bad luck.  However, it kept happening again and again.  I couldn't even finish the sandwiches the meat tasted so bad.\n\n3.  This is the real kicker.  The final time I ate at the Shop, I noticed this new promotion they've got going: the King Philly.  For something like a buck fiddy extra, you get twice as much meat and cheese, or so they claim.  In reality, they reduced the amount of meat and cheese they give you on a regular cheesesteak.  So instead of just raising prices, the geniuses in marketing came up with a zany promotion so people don't realize they're getting fucked.  Real cool, especially in these times of economic crisis.\n\nAfter my final visit to the Cheesesteak Shop, I gave my stamp card, which was fully filled out, to Rita C.  I didn't want to ever step foot in that shithole ever again, even if the sandwich was free.  It's a real bummer that this place sucks now, but the universe always balances itself out.  When one cheesesteak place becomes shit, a better one opens.  Phat Philly anyone?\n\nI give the Cheesesteak Shop a fantastic score of 1 out of 5 stars.\n\nLove,\nJames", "author": "Cheryll M."}

The way it usually goes down in the northeast is that the dirtier & older the place looks, the bigger its capacity for greatness. This goes for cheese steak joints in Philly as much as it does for pizza joints in New York & wing joints in Buffalo. Establishments like these are so passionate about their particular craft that they skip right over things like spiffing up the place with flashy decorations, keeping matching/usable furniture & mopping.\n\nThe Cheese Steak Shop is like Sylvester Stallone in 'Cobra'. All they know how to do is build the perfect cheese steak, in the same way that Stallone's Lieutenant Cobretti only knew how to clean up the streets. Cobra would return home to an empty house & open the fridge to find only a beer & a jar of mustard in there...that's it. Then he would sit at a filthy table (one chair only) & knaw on week-old pizza crusts for nourishment, keeping his gun within reach the entire time.\n\nSide Note: Next time you watch '24' & wonder how Jack Bauer got to be such a badass, you can think about three things: Stallone, 'Cobra', & cheese steaks.\n\nThe Cheese Steak Shop's biggest strength is the same as their biggest weakness...they care *too* much about building the perfect cheese steak.

Initially I thought it was pretty plain due to the fact that it was during lunch break, and some of my classmates bought it to-go and brought it back to school. It was cold and kinda plain so I never really had a good experience with it. \n\nI was craving a Philly today so I decided to give this place another try due to the positive reviews by fellow yelpers. \n\nI found parking in the area to be a bit annoying but nonetheless, I found parking and walked into the place. Delicious smells and odors filled my nostrils and I looked at the huge board menu. \n\nI decided to go for a 10 inch Mushroom and Cheese Philly. The guy behind the counter was the manager apparently from the name tag. I put in my order and I said \"whiz with\" but he gave me this look and asked me \"what?\" rather rudely. I suddenly realized maybe they don't do their sandwiches here with whiz so I just said with grilled onions. \n\nI waited for my order and while I was waiting, I noticed 2 of the staff members were engaging in some sort of argument. I don't really know what about, but apparently one guy didn't like what the other guy was doing and they exchanged words and phrases which included obscenities. I was a bit dismayed by the lack of professionalism. \n\nI then looked at the manager as if to see if he was going to say anything but he was talking with one of the other employees. Eavesdropping, I heard them talking about a female patron and were saying some things about how she looks and how \"excited\" they were, if you get my drift. Obscenities were also used in this conversation. \n\nI basically had to wait about 15 minutes for my order, which was pretty surprising considering that other places have your order ready and in your hands in less than 5. \n\nI walked out of the place already annoyed by the lack of professionalism and I give it some sort of slack considering it is a 'fast food' type of restaurant and not some upscale place, but I don't give any excuse for the rude, unnecessary comments toward female patrons. \n\nI get in my car, and instantaneously, my entire car was filled with the aroma of the freshly made, piping hot sandwich. I decided that everything else can wait and I opened up the wrapping. It was nicely wrapped in a sheet of foil and then further wrapped in parchment paper. There it was, a 10 inch, mushroom cheesesteak. Looking at it was already a feast. The roll was nicely toasted and warm, but still soft and fluffy, slightly soaked in meat juices. The cheese was nicely melted and blended with the meat. Speaking of meat, there was a lot of it, and I mean a lot. \n\nAs for the mushrooms, this was where I found disappointment. I had imagined a 1:2 mushroom to beef ratio but what I found was more like 1:100. They were pretty skimpy on the mushrooms and considering the fact that I ordered a MUSHROOM cheesesteak, it was more like a cheesesteak with mushrooms that were accidentally spilled onto the grill and they just decided to throw it in. \n\nI took a bite. It was like taking a bite out of heaven. The bread was really good, fluffy and soft. The white American cheese was nicely melted and combined with the meat ever so perfectly. The meat was tender and flavorful. And well, the only thing I wished was more evident was the flavor of mushrooms. \n\nI devoured the sandwich in less time than it took for them to make it. And believe me, it gets better with every subsequent bite. \n\nAll in all, this place makes a great Philly. Granted, I've never been to Philly to try a real Philly, but since I didn't know better, this place makes one of the best \"authentic\" Philly's I've ever had. Jake's has whiz and better employee behavior, but I think I'm pretty sold on this place for a while. \n\nIt would be 5 stars, but the employee's made this place drop down to 4.", "author": "Derrick L."}

They fly most ingredients in from Philly and have a great, consistent product.

I would stick to the King of Philly with the works as smaller sandwiches may seem to lack volume and the rings and fries are good but not amazing.  But the star of the show is the cheese steak and this one rocks.  The locations are franchised but with pretty strict guidelines (the owner of the Marin location had to take down some memorabilia that wasn't local or Philly).  The ingredients and technique are handed down from the experts.  The location in Pleasanton is my favorite, complete with a guy in a Phillies hat who might have just flown in to make you your sandwich.  In any event, complaining about service, portions or parking is totally missing the point of the shop.  This is where you come to get the real deal without a bunch of B.S.

Ok...i had asked my friend (who's about 5\"4 and weighs a buck 25) if he usually orders the 10\"....\n\n\"For lunch...sure\"\n\"And for dinner?\"\n\"15\"\n\"!!!!\"\n\"They're not that big....\"\n\nNot to be outdone, I got the 15 incher myself and an order of steak fries.

I arrived at the destination and picked up the package.\n\nWaitaminute...something must be wrong....my cheesesteak....the thing....it's....it's poking out of their bag.

I've been coming to this place for years and each time I grub here, the sandwiches still taste as good as when I first tried them. The joint is a little dirty and smells like a big ol' grease market, but hey you knew that already right? It's a cheesesteak shop. What did you expect?\n\nThe Cheesesteak Hoagie (steak, cheese, lettuce, tomatos, and mayo) topped with sweet and spicy peppers is my personal favorite on the board. Paired with an order of their twister fries, it's a meal fit for a king. My only small complaint about this place is orders do take entirely too long to come out. Don't know if the bread is baked to order  or what, but 15 -20 minutes from order to arrival can get a little irritating. Oh well though, still totally worth it.\n\nFor those of you who've only sampled cheesesteaks at your local Subway or Great Steak & Fry,  stop by The Cheesesteak Shop. You will seriously be blown away.", "author": "jeff c."}

However, the cheese was barely there. I got maybe two mushroom pieces. No onions. A few peppers (not grilled).\n\nThe service is friendly if slow.\n\nWhat bumps this up to a 3-star is that you can get a non-obesity-inducing 7\" sandwich for $7, instead of being forced to order and eat some 10\" or 12\" monstrous greaseball.\n\nAnother bump up is that they wrap their to-go sandwiches quite tightly in foil and paper, so you can indeed take it safely to go and not worry about a disintegrated sandwich. The expert packing rivals that of Pancho Villa's burritos.", "author": "Rob T."}

Have I mentioned that I love this place? :)\n\nI always get the cheesesteak with sweet peppers.  It's the best combo of sliced sauteed beef, melted provolone cheese, on french roll.  So simple, but so good.  Highly recommend.  One downside is that the interior is kind of ghetto (and not in the most chic-chic neighborhood) has a funky smell to it so I usually get it to-go.\n\nTips: \n* Get both hot AND sweet peppers, you can always pick some out if they're too sweet and hot (which is what I inevitably do with the hot peppers).\n* They have a loyalty card (get 10 get 1 free) so ask for one if they don't give you one and you think you'll be a repeat customer.\n* I like to call in advance since the line for pickup is usually shorter.", "author": "Ellen C."}

Having checked out the Cheese Steak Shop the day before, I naturally chose to come here again. The shop's slogan is \"Caution: May Be Habit Forming\" and uh yeah. I came here two days in a row.\n\nI've only had the original Philly steak and it's pretty delicious--get the 15 inch if you're starving; the 10 inch suffices and I won't even try the 7 inch, that's like snack status. Steak, white American cheese, onions and sweet peppers give this cheese steak some pop. The sweet peppers offer a nice contrast that I didn't think I would enjoy. I do, though.\n\nThe curly fries taste like Jack in the Box fries. \n\nMid-meal, my friends and I discovered something fantastic: mere feet away from us was a man who looked like the spitting image of Martin Luther King, Jr. No lie. This absolutely made my day.\n\nOh I almost forgot, if you're getting a 10 inch, make sure to \"King\" it--they'll give you extra meat and cheese. Apparently, they don't \"King\" 15 inchers.

The bread was a soft, gooey mixture with the cheese and the soft meat. Yes, that's two \"softs\", but it wasn't like I was an  old man eating wet food. The bread was soft and the meat was tender and tasty. The cheese was the salty bridge to melt the two together. Very good. I got the steak fries. Twist my arm, but if it's a choice between fat potato fries and extra tasty curly fries, I'll take the taste of potato over the taste of delicious batter. Good fries, but I wish I had some ranch. That would have made it perfect. \n\nSorry I didn't take pictures of my food. I'm not quite sure how you people have the will power to not devour good food instantly. But I did take out. This allowed time for the cheese and bread and steak to melt together a little longer. Yum.

And while I have found an exception, The Cheese Steak Shop is not it.  I walked into this place for the first time when I was in the neighborhood checking out a room to live in, and have tried it once more since then.  Both times were basically the same experience: Meh.  \nMy least favorite part of their cheese steaks is the bun which is small, squishy, and tastes recently defrosted.  The meat both times was overdone and rather chewy, and the whole sandwich itself struck me as small and forgettable.  If you order peppers on your cheese steak prepare to get a soggy, canned-peppers sandwich with a bit of meat and cheese on it.\nSome of my roomies swear by this place, which I find strange since Pete's Deli, right across the street, serves up what I believe to be the best cheese steak in town!  A 10 inch cheese steak at The Cheese Steak Shop is considerably smaller than a 7 inch at Pete's, due to the small crappy bun and skimpy meat portions.\nAll in all I see no reason to go back to this place except the curly fries, which are delicious.  Problem is that Pete's isn't open on Sunday, which, come football season, means I won't be able to get a good cheese steak and watch the game.

They import the Amoroso rolls (the mark of an authentic Philly steak), the meat (east coast cows have a different kind of fat than their west coast sisters), and the Tastykake snack cakes that you will be unable to eat after finishing your cheese steak. That's because you will not back down, and you will order the 15\". Grilled onions and hot peppers on the side is my personal favorite, although the pizza steak and chicken steak are also winners. Get some root beer in a bottle as well, its a good combo.\n\nOn another note, the atmosphere of the place is about on par with McDonalds.

You'd need at least a 10\" ($6.19-$6.59) to feel satiated.  And if meat is what you desire, you can \"King\" it for an additional $2 for more meat and cheese.

I am not even going to waste my time to complain about the one in Chicago that had lettuce in it (ew!), but I WILL rave on how yummy the cheesesteak sandwich from the Cheesesteak Shop was! It had solid bread, meaning it was strong and firm enough to hold all the contents of the sandwich together, while at the same time being soft. It had a good meat to cheese ratio, and did not make me feel like crap after eating it. Two probably would have, but I decided to hold back on this particular day to save room in my stomach for a fabulous dinner. It was soooo good!\nWe didn't eat our sandwiches at the shop as we perferred to stay in, but I know for a fact that the shop is clean and is definitely not a hole in the wall place infested with bugs. I would eat in, out, morning and night from there.", "author": "Maureen B."}

Based on me and my friends nothing compares when you have the urge for something hot, greasy and super tasty. They offer some other great delicacies such as stuffed mushrooms, steak fries (which are like butter, but better), onion rings and curly fries. The people working there are all local and super friendly. They have random specials depending on the day of the week. If you don't feel like cheese steak they have an insane italian hoagie, but you must ask for it hot (else its mediocore at best). I always take people here when we want something filling but cheap. You can't beat a 15 inch sandwich for $10 bucks ^^", "author": "Mike W."}

If I could eat one of these everyday for the rest of my life I wouldn't need anything else. Just me and my cheese steak together in everlasting bliss. That being said let me give you a couple tips to ordering-\n\n1. Always call ahead. Unless you don't have a phone.\n2. Don't assume you will like everything on your cheese steak, you have to try different combinations until you find the steak just right for you. Me, I just like sweet peppers. But I had every combo I could imagine before I landed on that one.\n3. Get smalls of both fries, curly and steak. They complement each other quite nicely. And only do the onion rings if you are really feeling it.\n4. You are going to need at least two ketchups and five napkins. \n5. When i do Tasty Kakes they are peanut butter and the perfect soda is Root Beer. \n\nAnd remember, these are all over the Bay area. Each one is as good as previous so spread the love and find your favorite stop.\n\nNow punch my stamp card.", "author": "Jake S."}

I cannot emphasize enough how important both the sweet and hot peppers are to the experience. And for the love, no chicken or turkey or anything else. BEEF STEAK. After that, yes there are other tasty things here, but if it's your first time, start with this. Eating hot off the grill is good, but they are also fantastic when taken home and giving the grease time to just slightly congeal, and the flavors to mix. Plus, your car will smell amazing inside for a week.\n\nI've been going to this place for 20 years (University in Berkeley and more recently on Divisidero in SF) and it's remained remarkably consistent. They grill the meat the same way (chop it up on the grill with a pair of spatulas) and use the same authentic ingredients. I asked a woman who works there once about the meat and she said something about they got the meat from the east coast because they wanted yellow fat where I guess meat on the west coast tends to be marbled with white fat. No idea if that's still true but I do know they still get the bread (roll) from Philly, a critical component. I think maybe the cheese too.\n\nLoads of grease? Check. Calories equal to the recommended daily amount for a small village? Check. Gooey cheese and accompanying cholestorol? Check check. This stuff will kill you if you eat it everyday, but wow...so rarely have I gotten cravings so often in the middle of the night for a certain food (this along with Flint's and Zachary's).

I got bacon on it which was an excellent choice. The cheese was incredible, the meat was chopped up grinder style which at first I wasn't sure how I'd feel about but the way it was cooked gave it this almost crusty crunch on the meat that really worked well for that style. Curly fries were way good too and the buttermilk ranch was the perfect dip for those, it was rich and creamy, almost too rich! The place is hole in the wall, reasonably priced.

Comes stock with White American cheese, but you can have provolone etc if you want. Like I said before, tho, no whiz here. You'll need to go to Buster's for that. (And DO go to Busters - Columbus Ave in NB). The bread is a critical part of a good cheesesteak sandwich and this shop has the best. Slightly chewy but substantial, so it doesn't fall apart.  I always get the mushroon steak with grilled onions and sweet peppers (hard to find) and they're the only ones who put the peppers on for you, pre-sliced, instead of giving you 2 or 3 un-sliced whole peppers to deal with yourself.

I never had an authentic Philly from the Philly. But all the products come from Philly. This would have to be one choice for my last meal on earth. Its piping hot when you get it, i have never been disappointed with the sandwich. Ohhh and the Bacon Philly is on point. A must try at least once if youre visiting the City or as a reguar Frisconian resident.", "author": "Joao M."}

Stick with the original and get both types of peppers (sweet & hot) with the grilled onions. You can get hot sauce from the dude behing the counter when you pick up your order, but you have to ask for it. Tuesdays are double stamp days. The place gets hella busy during lunch hours so if you expect a long wait call in your order ahead, even if it's only 10 min before you get there.  Then you can skip the long line and save about 20 minutes of waiting.", "author": "Victor H."}

This was the first place I had a cheesesteak at and so far still the best after many other attempts trying other places throughout the years.  Cherry peppers add a great texture and sweetness to this fine sandwich and to me is a must.  I always order my cheesesteak sandwich with provalone and mushrooms. Yummy!  Their fries are actually steak fries which are thick and meaty and go well with the sandwich.  Not the cheapest sandwich shop in town, but unique and good enough that the price you pay seems to be worth it.  This place is in a decent part of town, but the past couple times I've been there I noticed a strong smell of urine, probably from some bum who likes to venture in there a lot , so dining in in not an option unless you like the smell of urine and beef mixed into one.  I now order to go and visit the Starbucks a few doors down to chomp on my jewel of a sandwich.  Good Eats!!", "author": "Adam G."}

Either they dont know this is a chain store or they have not had an authentic philly.\nthe closest thing ive had to a philly is jake's and although they are idiots and cant figure out how to deliver an order jake taught them how to make a cheesesteak before he sold the place.  and it has not changed.  amoroso rolls filled with twice as much meat as this place on divisadero and drowned in cheesewhiz.  forget about it.\nI really dont understand why this place gets better reviews that Jakes.  i think the real reason is because Jakes delivers and their delivery staff is absolutley retarded which other yelpers have noticed as well.  as for me i'm not subscribing to the retarded majority on this one.  How can you support a chain as oppsed to an independent business?  I guess i will remain in the monority on this one but i walked in having high hopes and i walked out thinking about Jake's.\nthis is a true story and i have no connection to jakes.  in fact i am blacklisted from ordering there because i yell and scream when they fuck up my order which they do almost every time.", "author": "Anthony Y."}
