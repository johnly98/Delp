I've been coming to Dubliner for years and FYI as of recently it's under new ownership and they're making the right moves forward (new beer lines, expanding drink selection, repairs, etc). \n\nFOOD/DRINK: They don't serve food, but you may find a few bags of chips. I've never seen an issue with outside food and I believe it's actually encouraged for you to deliver there. As for drinks, I keep it simple with Gin & Tonics, Tom Collins, or just Hennessey Privilege. Privilege was actually off the menu, but the owner was nice enough to add it to their selection 1 day later. \n\nAMBIANCE: The bar is shaped like a rectangle, with 1/3 of the space as the bar counter, and 2/3's for tables and a walkway. TV's are practically visible from any seat via the bar or tables alongside the wall. Picture frames take up the majority of the wall space, it's clean, cozy, and welcoming. They have an upstairs as well with 3-4 small tables and a pool table. Does it remind me of an Irish Pub? Not too sure, this is the only one I've been too. \n\nSERVICE: A clear winner here. The bartenders are amazing, Otto, hands-down is one of the chillest people out there. Someone you can talk too and give it to you straight - no censorship. The owners here are very transparent and hands-on too, I've seen them each time I was there. \n\nCREDIT CARD: Yes. \n\nPARKING: It's street parking on WP, but on the blocks that isn't too busy with restaurants (between 14th and 15th ave). If you're coming at night, you won't have a problem - don't drink and drive. ;]\n\nOVERALL: When people generally ask me, \"Which Bar should we go to?\" Well, Dub's is my answer.", "author": "Austin N."}

But I thought I'd try the place down the street because I love irish bars and I want to have many around me. \n\nI order a Guiness and then go to my table knowing that it's poured in two stages. After a longer wait than necessary I went back to pick it up and the guy still hadn't finished it (he was chatting it up.) and he apologizes explaining (twice) that Guiness need to settle before being poured. \n\nReally? Thanks, guy. I've only been drinking them for 20 years. (I told him this but he didn't seem to hear me) Oh, and I just got back from Ireland three days ago where they pour a lot feckin' faster. \nThen he charges me $7 for it. Wow and I'm not even in the Mission. \n\nThe bartender was friendly just not attentive. But it was the overall vibe that sucked. It felt like a sports bar (I WAS there to watch the Warrior's game), which is fine if I wanted to go to a sports bar.  \n\nThey do have a pool table. A bonus but not enough to make me come back. A lot of testosterone in this place (and I'm a guy who doesn't mind a certain amount of testosterone in a bar, just not frat amount). A very adorable hound was running around though. \n\nSo I went back to McCarthy's after a beer. A lot more chill vibe where I could enjoy the game. To each his own I guess. \n\nBUT, calling yourself The Dubliner is false advertising. Okay, maybe your grandfather was from Ireland but if you want an Irish bar where people who've lived there work then go to McCarthy's. It's cheaper and more authentic despite the fact it doesn't have all the Irish bling on the walls. I guess it doesn't need to try as hard.", "author": "Surrly H."}

Before I left, I decided to take a picture of the bar wall with their new little LCD screens so that I could Yelp it.  I intentionally turned the flash of my phone off and took a quick picture of the wall.  A dysfunctional woman came up to me and asked me if I took a picture of her.  I was super nice and told her no, I did not.  I also went ahead and explained that I took a picture of the wall for Yelp and showed her the picture of the wall which had absolutely no faces on it.  Tried to calm her down and showed her the picture again (which showed absolutely nobody) and  told her no big deal, I would delete it while she watched if she desired.\n\nI immediately deleted the image as she watched (which absolutely showed no faces!) and as I did, another patron, a regular there called Victoria (I will be nice enough not to put her last name) flipped out on me.  I tried very nicely FOUR times to explain to her that I will leave her friend alone and that all I am trying to do is explain to her friend that it is no problem.  When she started screaming at me and treating me like shite, I said responded and walked away.  I then told the bartender, Crystal, that out of respect to her, I am leaving because those two women are crazy and I do not want to cause her any drama on her shift.  I closed out my tab, $6.00 on which I tipped $6.00 for a total of $12.00.  I thought both of those things I did for her were beyond cool.\n\nWent to my car right out front and someone outside told me hey, you better take a look at your car, I then realized that Victoria had scratched up my car.  I called the police station and they told me to come in tomorrow to file an official report.

Stick to beer and mixed drinks. \n\nThere are 4 bathrooms here, a mens, two unisex and in the very back the cleanest ladies room I have encountered in ANY bar ever.", "author": "Amanda L."}

First off I would like to say that DISCRIMINATION is a form of racism. \n\nI came in with a friend to watch the NCAA finals to knock back a few drinks and enjoy the game on Monday 4/4/2011 at approx 6:30 p.m.. Man we made a wrong decision even stepping foot in this place. The bar wasn't packed or anything. About 12 people to be exact and there was an old man possibly the owner who was the bartender that evening, he had a real bad attitude and screwed up our order. Then he tried over charging us on our first and only round when the sign on the wall clearly says $4.00 for a beer \"ALL DAY, EVERYDAY\".\n\nI could tell that he didn't like me from the start but we sat and had our drink and watched the 1st half of the game. After wards I walked up to the bar to buy another round of drinks for us. The bar tender kept walking back and forth ignoring me for about 15 mins as I was politely standing there with a $20 bill in hand. Was I not getting something here? I'm a paying customer, I brought a ton of money to spend so we can watch the game, and I'm not getting acknowledged as a customer. Then on the other end of the bar with a simple nod of the head, a customer gets helped out and is served his drinks promptly. Then someone else is served right away right next to me. I waited for the bar tender to come back but every time he walked my way he wouldn't even bother to look at me or make eye contact. It's not like this place was packed at that moment.  \n\nThat's when I realized that he wasn't serving me because he was profiling me against my ethnic background. I looked around and there wasn't another ethnic colored person there. At first I thought, \"he'll come around and serve me\" but as I stood there waiting and waiting the bar tender never even bothered to acknowledge my presence. I felt so DISCRIMINATED against by the worker/owner (possibly) that I vowed to never come here again. \n\nThat man whoever he was, was such an @ss and refused to serve a paying customer. I have told all my friends and my contacts about this experience that I have taken it upon myself to write this review to let everyone know what happened on 4/4/2011  at the Dubliner. \n\nI ended up going to a diff sports bar that night and was able to catch the last 2 mins of the NCAA Finals game. No thanks to the Discriminating Dubliner.", "author": "Omar M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-06-02", "description": "UPDATE 5-16-07 the \"odd wall display\" TV's are gone, and smaller LCD's facing the bar have improved this place's coefficient-of-sports-bar by a two to one margin. \n\n*************\n\n\"A good businessman does not an interior decorator make.\"\n\n One look inside the latest incarnation of \"The Dubliner\" bars drives this point home.  The wood you face when you're looking at the bar is stained Oreo-cookie dark, while every other panel in the place is a-la-folding-table simulated blonde oak. The result looks more Modesto-California than Dublin-Ireland.  Televisions are present, but they're freakishly placed in discussion-unfriendly positions.  Two screens sit at the end of the bar, and one-of-two people sitting closest to a TV has to turn their head 180 degrees away from the game to make eye contact with the person behind them.  Other TV's are built into an odd wall display above the entrance to the pool table area. They're too small, too high, and too oddly located for anyone to pay attention to.\n\nThe day crowd usually has a half-dozen middle-aged men watching a game.  They're fairly talkative, but interaction between them is stifled by the position of the televisions. Sports fans tend to cramp towards the TV's at the end of the bar, and conversation amongst them can be fairly awkward.\n\nThe night crowd started off wall-to-wall on opening night, but cooled down immediately thereafter.  There was a lull for several months, but last time I popped by it seemed like the Dubliner was becoming a post-event hangout for the mid-40's sportcoat-and-evening-gown crowd.  It was around 10 PM, seating was near capacity, and  9-out-of-10 patrons looked just like they'd just gotten back from the Opera.  Several *beautiful* women were on hand...and even though most of them wore sizable commitment-rocks on their off-limits fingers, the better part of them were mature enough for a man in his 40's to admire.  And come nightfall when the lights get dimmed, the blonde oak paneling doesn't look half as bad.  \n\nT.K.'s (the previous tenant) was a gritty place that had it's problems...but it had a soul, and one that perished completely during the process of a tragic remodel.  The new bar is clean and sterile, but utterly devoid of character and decorative virtue.  Sports and decor aside, it's not a bad bar. The night clientele is mature and upscale, surrounding restaurants are plentiful, and the K,L, and M MUNI lines stop within a short walk of the front door.  Still, I've come here in search of the West Portal vibe on occasion, but always wound up feeling like a round peg in a odd-shaped hole.  I'll pop by periodically to see if it evolves....but for the mean time it's got pretty stiff competition from Portal's Tavern across the street.", "author": "Mike W."}

Really low-key place and fairly quiet except for a couple of guys who had at least two too many.\n\nI heard there's a pool table on the second floor but I didn't make it that far --- the talk of broken glass and a belligerent male gave me cause to think twice about heading up there.", "author": "Kristi K."}

The drinks are cheap, for the 4 hours we were there, we had at least 3 Irish coffees, 2 Irish Car Bombs, and at least 6 Jack and Cokes, 4 beers and our total tab was about $50.

They have a great mezzanine pool table, it is well worn but the pool is free on Sundays and I think Monday as well. You do need to be careful not to break some of the small glass panes of the balcony wall overlooking the rest of the bar; you can see where a few have been knocked out by the end of a pool cue.\nAnother plus for this bar is the happy-hours. $3 pretty much anything, well drinks and guinness etc. Where else can you get a pint of guinness for $3???\nIt is in the dive bar category and gets a bit cramped very quickly during happy hour.\nThe main thing that bugs me about this place is that they let dogs into the bar. I've been a few times where there has been a dog or two wandering up and down the room. Now the dogs are generally well behaved, well trained, but it just seems unhygienic to me. I've even seen a dog sitting up on a barstool. The bar staff did tell it to get down when they noticed, but at the end of the day, a dog has sat on that barstool.\nSo overall, not a bad pub.
