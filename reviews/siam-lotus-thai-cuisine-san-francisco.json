I frankly need to expand my taste buds and not keep ordering pad see ew, pad kee mow, or pad thai. They got some decent fried rices too though I guess that doesn't help my case much. They have more on the menu you can try! Really!\n\nAs for the food itself, it's good though not particularly overpowering in flavor though that can be a good thing for some. Adjust the spice level as you will, a medium isn't all too bad and ought to be a good level for most people. \n\nAll in all, this is an unassuming restaurant that serves decent thai food for the price you pay.", "author": "Derek T."}

This place is super good! We ordered the duck fried rice and the pad see ew. They let you adjust the spice you want to make it perfect- we went with mild and were very pleased. The oil that ends up on the food isn't so much that you feel it covering your lips as you chow down on those noodles/rice.. but it is just enough to give it taste.

We were craving Thai and this was one of the few that were walking distance from The Booksmith.\n\nI consider crab fried rice a waste of money because crab meat tends to have a subtle flavor, the flavor gets drowned out when mixed in a fried rice dish, ultimately rendering the dish into a regular fried rice.\n\nThis place, however, does Crab Fried Rice amazingly. Not only can you taste the crab, you can smell its aroma as well! Very appetizing and delicious and I highly recommend it.\n\nAnother great dish they have is their chicken wings. Perfect combo with the fried rice.", "author": "Oliver D."}

I ordered chicken satay and a bowl of tom Kha for my boyfriend and I.  When I ordered she asked if we were sharing and I said yes, assuming she meant for an extra spoon.\n\nThe food was pretty bad. The chicken satay had clearly not been marinated and tasted boiled-not at all like the flavorful meat I experience most places. The cucumber salad with it also seemed tossed together and lacking on flavor. Even the peanut sauce was sub par.\n\nThe tom Kha lacked coconut flavor weirdly and was very short on both vegetables and chicken. I believe it must have had milk since shortly after eating I got a migraine that I get when I consume dairy. The portion was large, which surprised us but we figured out why when we got the bill.\n\nThe menu says only 'individual soups' and shows the price as $5. I thought that would be perfect for a snack. It does not say any sizes or use the word 'cup' of 'bowl'. When we got the bill we had been charged $9.59. Normally I wouldn't say anything but I didn't love being charged for something we barely ate that was terrible, so we politely asked about why it wasn't the menu price and she turned incredibly rude and told me I ordered wrong and should've said cup if I wanted a small portion. My boyfriend asked her politely despite her rudeness why the menu didn't show a large size if she was charging for it, or at least didn't say 'cup' or 'bowl'. Then she said that she asked if we were sharing,so she gave us more. She was incredibly rude and kept telling me that I ordered wrong.\n\nWe both work in restaurants and know that you should never double the price of an item without informing the person. If the $9.50 price wasn't on the menu then you should ask if they want a larger portion for a higher price, not just assume that they want an off menu size and will pay for it.\n\nIt was clearly a scam, but even worse was how terrible she acted when we politely asked about it. Do not trust this place.", "author": "Alicia C."}

While I can't prove it was intentional, as you'll see below, it sure looks that way.\n\nI ordered takeout. State law says cooks don't share in tips; it was the cooks who did all the work on my order (not the servers), so I usually leave no tip or just a little one in this situation. \n\nSo I added a $1.16 tip on the $22.34 order. As you'll see in my photo (a scan of the credit card bill and the receipt the restaurant sent the credit card company), they entered this $1.16 tip as $4.00. How can that have been a typo or an entry error? Those two sets of numbers are nowhere near each other on the keypad. \n\nThe dollar amount here is small. But it's the principle. And if they did this to me, to how many other customers have they done this as well?\n\n[Update: one of the owners emailed me, apologized profusely, and offered this explanation: \"We line our credit card bills by number order and yours was most likely misplaced within the pile. Therefore a different order's tip was added to your bill.\" You be the judge, but it's always good practice to double check those credit card bills].", "author": "Tim B."}

I'm a big Thai food fan, but had never eaten here, despite it being a short jaunt from my house. Grubhub told me the veggie spring rolls and the pad thai were popular, so I got em. They're also pretty common at Thai places, so figured they'd be a good benchmark.\n\nUnfortunately, they both fell short. The spring rolls were plain, but made better with sweet and sour sauce. Still not worth it to get three small spring rolls (three!) for $8 (eight dollars!). The pad thai was a healthier portion. I ordered shrimp as the protein, which, if you've ever ordered anything with shrimp, you know they're not going to give you as many shrimp as you want. This was actually a surprising exception! However, didn't change the fact that the pad thai was not that great. While some thai noodles veer too far into greasy/salty/spicy as hell, I would have gladly taken that over whatever this was.\n\nDespite the convenience, probably won't be heading back. Stars for the quantity of shrimp/noodles and the inclusion of sweet and sour with the spring rolls. An additional half star in spirit for the ease of Grubhub, but I think Grubhub earned that all for itself.", "author": "Julien I."}

August 5, 2015. In fact, it caught my eye because I though they might be related to Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas where I've dined before. Turns out, it is not related - but who cares? This was a wonderful Thai dinner!\n\nI started with the Hot & Sour Soup and ordered it extra spicy. They repeatedly warned me that it would be extremely spicy, but I paid no heed and said \"bring it on anyway!\" Actually, they were right - it was delicious, albeit extremely spicy as they warned.....I ate it all anyway, and my sinuses were completely cleared :-)\n\nNext was the Crab Fried Rice. Just awesome. Fresh and fluffy...it felt very healthy. \n\nMy wife hadn't had Thai food before, so she ordered the Chicken Curry Butternut Squash since it sounded simple and familiar. She totally loved it.\n\nThe service was excellent too. Two ladies served us, one of which was \"Nart\" the owner. Both ladies were extremely nice and attentive.

It makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. And even when it's not perfect, it really hits the spot.\n\nMy friends and I were in need of some nourishment after (timidly) dancing around Amoeba for a free show put on by Thievery Corporation's Rob Garza. We were not shaking our butts as enthusiastically as some other concert-goers, but we were still feelin' it. \n\nSiam Lotus is a cozy little bistro in the midst of the madness that is Haight-Ashbury. It's a quiet refuge from the manic streets outside its glass window. I felt relaxed immediately after stepping inside. How very zen a place can feel upon first glance. \n\nThe food was yummy. We opted for three different types of curry. I ordered the Tofu Curry, and it was delicious, albeit a bit too mild for my palate. I like it to burn, baby, burn. I shall have to specify to make mine at least medium spicy. \n\nMy favorite part was the fresh coconut water.... served in whole coconuts! They just crack a hole in the top and stick a straw inside. Amazing! Not much actual liquid inside, but the presentation was quite standout.", "author": "Brandi W."}

I always get nervous that restuarants still use fish sauce in their vegan/vegetarian meals, but the waitress (possibly owner) assured me that she understood and that everything would be made vegan.\n \nIf nothing else, try the Eastern Thai Veggie appetizer (it will blow your mind).

However, it is evident that the chef's skill and creativity are never on realized through these limiting dishes. Imagine having a free throw contest between Lebron and the sharpshooter on your high school team - both would probably make 7 out of 10 free throws, but Lebron's prowess as an all-NBA player can never be displayed in that contest. In the same way, if confined to the same ingredients, a world-class chef and a college freshman cooking for the first time with only a YouTube instructional recipe at his disposal would produce generally indistinguishable Pad See Ew. Thankfully, Siam Lotus's Chef's Special menu showcases the limitless potential Thai flavors can present.\n\nThe Tom Yum Fried Rice's teeming bits of fried garlic and chunks of juicy chicken create a whirlwind of flavors that drive an inexplicable desire to acquire a stock-pot full of fried rice to enjoy for days on end; the Northern Curry Egg Noodle's saturated curry flavor thoroughly permeates the buoyant egg noodles; and the Golden Triangle's crispy outer shell artfully envelopes its creamy mashed potato fillings to make a great starter.  The Iced Coffee is sinus-clearing strong and water cups are never empty.  \n\nSiam Lotus is a must-try for Thai food fanatics!", "author": "Andrew M."}

He really enjoyed the uniqueness of the dish.\n\nI had the roast duck noodle soup (it's become my test the thai restaurant dish lately). The duck was well roasted - duck is already kind of a generally gummy meat and sometimes cooked to be more gummy - not that I mind, but this was actually little more tender. The soup seemed to have more duck flavor than others I've had that tasted more like duck in chicken soup. The broth was just right thickness between hearty and soupy.\n\nWe left room and ordered mango with black sticky rice because they offered it out of season. (Note to self: when you know mango is not in season, do not expect a miracle of ripe sweet mango when it's offered). They used one of those harder sweet+tart mangoes.

Really, the only thing I've had here that hasn't been the best I've had in SF is their Pad-See-Ew. (If you're a Pad-See-Ew lover in this 'hood, head to Thai Place on Divis.

I dream about it sometimes.\n\nAmbiance and service are nothing to write home about, but they work hard here and allow you to sit as long as you want without bugging you.

Soft tofu, spicy (just the right amount), fresh vegetables, and accompanied with sticky rice. Great dish.\n\n3) My Aunt ordered the something Egg Noodle dish (I don't see it on the menu online) and it was phenomenal. Special northern-style dish that was recommended... Home-made noodles with crispy noodles on top. We had it with beef.. And wow! The flavor, the texture and consistency of the noodles, the beef (my aunt said because I don't eat meat) was all amazing! \n\n3) To top it off, we had the Sticky Coconut Rice & Mango dessert. Now I am not a big dessert person, I usually never order dessert. But the Thai has got it goin' on with this dish, so I order it every time I go out and eat Thai. Ohhhhh the warm, slightly sweet, coconut drizzled rice with a touch of sesame seed, complimented with fresh, chilled mango by the slice...

I usually order the chicken in the soup. It wasn't on the menu but the waiter spontaneously asked if I wanted shrimp (on the menu) or chicken. Also he asked me if I wanted sticky rice with the larb. That's how they have it in Thailand. I knew that from a visit to a Thai restaurant in Germany, never having been to Thailand itself. No Thai restaurant in the US had ever suggested this. I was impressed. Both the Tom Yum and the Larb were excellent, some of the best I've had.\n\nAnd the service remained very good. A couple on bikes came in and one of them was putiing the bikes away.

Located right in the belly of the upper Haight. \n\nThai basil beef with mango was good - they used HUGE chunks of mango. The mango was a little on the ripe side, so after being cooked up it had a borderline mushy texture, but was still sweet and palatable with the basil and beef. \n\nThai iced tea was a delicious sweet tooth fix. \n\nGreen papaya salad was a little heavy on the fish sauce, but I liked it anyway.

My go-to here is the snow pea chicken. Especially at lunch when it's served with a simple salad with the creamiest dressing that mixes so delectably with the soy sauciness of the stir fry. It's not on the dinner menu, but I order it anyways... The tom yum fried rice is also especially delicious. \n\nThe nearby Haight sketchiness leaves a little to be desired, and the interior decor isn't outstanding.

I come here every once in a while since I work close by and always have a delicious meal. I am writing this review for the amazing staff and service. The kitchen has, I think, 2 cooks so sometimes you have to wait a little, but I really appreciate that they tell you this upfront and it is worth it. I came a couple of months ago because we needed to cater a small gathering at my work, 15 people. We showed up maybe 3 hours before we needed the food and the staff sat with us and helped us make a selection. We asked for one small modification and they let us know they didn't usually do that modification but they did it for us because we worked in the neighborhood and they have a strong sense of business community in the Haight. But please don't ask for modifications after reading this review, it was a one time deal!

Located on Haight Street, it is a great family owned gem in a diverse neighborhood.  Be aware that there are only two people preparing all the meals, which they warn about in the menu so if there's a line, it could be a wait.  When we arrived at 19:30 on a Wednesday evening and there were a few families dining and no line!  Sweet!  After having been walking all day, we quickly decided on a Calamari appetizer, the Mango Salmon Panang Curry and the Brussel Salmon with brown rice.   I'm a big Calamari fan and these were perfectly done - not over cooked or battered.    When the Mango Salmon Panang arrived, my jaw nearly dropped as the dish looked awesome.   I of course got the Salmon with brussel sprouts, something I had never seen done before now.   The sprouts were fresh and cooked perfectly - just crunchy and not mushy.   These blended nicely with the delicate salmon which fell apart easily.   My partner said the Mango Salmon was delicious with the mango being just perfectly aged.    When we asked the about which mango was used, the cook explained that it was a special sweet mango she used for the dish.    \n\nOverall, the service was spot-on and it was a nice touch for the chief to come out and talk to the patrons - especially since they were not brazenly busy.   If you are a big Thai food fan, then Siam Lotus Thai Cuisine is about as non-pretentious and down-to-earth as one is going to find serving exceptional Thai food at reasonable prices.   For me, easily worth the ride and next time I'll allow more time to wander around the Haight area after dinner. Cheers.", "author": "G M."}

That is when I first fell in love with the Fried Shrimp Rolls w/ dipping sauce.  My order took less than 10 minutes to come up, but was anything but fast food.   Crispy exterior, perfectly cooked shrimp inside.  You can't go wrong with this app.\n\nThe same day that I tried the Shrimp Rolls, I returned to Siam Lotus for my actual dinner.  Yep, I was hooked.  My guest had the Southern Thai Tamarind Pumpkin and I had Grilled Salmon w/ Pear chilli sauce.  The server actually asked us how hot we wanted our food!   We were offered a scale 1-5 to choose from.   Great food!  Loved the heat.\n\nThe most recent time that I went there, I got the Fried Shrimp Rolls, Angel Wings, and  Mahi Mahi w/ Spicy Tamarind Sauce (I split this with someone else).  I would recommend the mahi entree along with the fried shrimp rolls to new comers ($20.90 plus tax and tip).   The angel wings were a bit greasy for me.  \n\nI found the prices to be fair.

The warm, dark interior was decorated with traditional wooden sculpture.  There were five menus to read.  \"We have too many menus,\" conceded the waitress, but I don't really think so.  When you walk into a library, you don't expect to read every book, do you?  \n\nTwo of the menus were for lunch specials, good 12pm - 4pm.  We both found something we would like almost immediately.  \n\nWe started with satay chicken, and the peanut-coconut sauce had a perfect balance.  Neither flavor overwhelmed the other.  Hey, you want to share food equitably?  Feed your lover, and let her feed you.  Forget about all the emos who want you to get a room.  You'll make sure you each get a fair share of the appetizer.  \n\nThen she had coconut jumbo prawn tempura.  They came with a sweet sweet-and-sour sauce, which was a little richer than we normally find in Thai restaurants.  Again, there was enough meat on  the stick for both of us to play.  \n\nI had Thai basil crab meat with garlic and peppers.  Once more, the flavors did not overwhelm, and the heat wasn't higher than the passion in our hearts.  The white steamed rice on the plate also assured that our palates would not be overwhelmed.  \n\nShe drank tea; I drank Thai iced tea.  The whole feast for two was only $25 + tip.  \n\nWe appreciated the waitress' helpful and attentive service.  \n\nI would not recommend this place to anyone who wants to challenge me to a fire eating contest, but for an average American it is the perfect place to enjoy the spices of Thailand without the pain.", "author": "David D."}

Pretty hungry and looking for a new Thai place, the menu offered a myriad of seafood, meat and vegetarian/vegan options (which is rare because most Thai places slap tofu instead of meat and think it's vegetarian. BEWARE, almost all Thai entrees have fish sauce, so make sure the menu is designated vegetarian versus tofu as a meat option).\n\nAfter contemplating the abundance of veggie options, I decided on a classic yellow curry. This is a very typical dish in Thai cooking, but that does not mean that every yellow curry you try will be good. The hook-line and sinker to this dish was the unexpected addition of winter squash (an orange, pumpkin-like sweet squash that plays very well with the spicy curry and sweet coconut milk).  This dish was not only impressive to my Thai-food-loving taste buds, but also was satisfying to my 1/2 Thai fellow vegan foodie. \n\nShe ordered some spicy noodle dish... I can't remember the name, but I remember the dish. It was true to the spicy verses that Thai food can sing so well. Large flat noodles with lots of stir fried veggies with a sweet, brown soy based sauce.  \n\nWith an unsweetened (sorry non-milk drinkers/ lac-tards no soy here) Thai iced tea and a hot tea, the lunch that was expected to be a so-so meal turned out to be a curry-colored diamond in the rough. \n\nA caution to those of your to choose to fulfill your Thai food cravings, this little gem is closed on Tuesdays (boo, right?) and, although this may seem minor, they don't have tamarind candies.

Since we were shopping in the area, we needed to get lunch in that area; our choices were between the pizza joint and this thai restaurant. The menu out front was intriguing. So we chose this place. The inside of the restaurant looked nice too. For the appetizer, we got the spring rolls, which had a good mix of chicken, vegetables, and thin clear noodles. Yummy. We got the entree plates, as the lunch specials do not come with rice. My husband got the yellow curry dish with chicken and I got the spicy eggplant with chicken. The presentation was very nice. My husband cannot do spicy but found that it was seasoned with the right amount of  spice. He said it had a bit of zing. I tried it; it was excellent---it reminded me of our good thai restaurants back home in LV, Lotus of Siam in the Commercial Center and Mix Zone Cafe at Charleston/Rancho. My dish was spicy, just the way I like it. There was a lot of food;a  good mix of chicken, vegetables and basil. I don't think that I finished it; good sized portions.

OMG SIAM LOTUS's GREEN CURRY!!!! Here is my ode to the green curry from Siam lotus: I love that curry so much i would marry it and have its curry babies. I will also denounce my Mexican citizenship and officially become a Siam lotus national, Once you have that green curry you will never go back to that overrated marnee thai shit, moreover, i am convinced that the little thai waitresses lace that shit with crack, cause' how else u explain such devotion. \nOkay back to the story, I was soooo exhausted but i was on a mission, I decided to make the trip all the way to height street to have a taste of that succulent, chicken green curry, and so i did. It took me about 1.5 hours to get there, but at the end oh i was soooo worth it. The first spoonful of that curry was almost orgasmic, the \"spicyness\" was perfect, and yes I eat that big boy with a SPOON! cause i like to take spoonfuls of that green curry, and may i dare to say i eat it without taking a bite out of the rice! I love that curry so much I would just drink it, as soon as i started eating it my problems melted away and I forgot all about that effed up \"write the karyotype of a person with translocation on the 18 chromosome\" question.

Well, the waitress either didn't hear, or understand, or forgot my salad dish because I never got it, the entrees just came right out. Normally, I would have said something, but I decided I'd probably ordered too much food anyway so I didn't bring it up, but it wasn't very impressive that they would forget. The food was very good but since they forgot my order, had to just give 3 stars. Also, you have to purchase rice separately, even with the curry dish.  Overall, good, but they could be more attentive.", "author": "Jim G."}

The won ton wrapped shrimp and angel wings are delicious starters, along with a papaya salad. Solid curries and the basil chicken is grubbin!  The Pad Thai (new age which is saucier then traditional) is probably one of the best if not thee best in San Francisco.  One of my favorite's, which isn't always on the menu is shrimp with glass noodles (goong woon sen) in a clay pot.  You don't see this dish too often and its even harder to find someone that makes it right.  Last but not least, you can't leave this place until you have fried banana ice cream!  The bananas are dipped in batter and fried to perfection.  Glazed with honey and chocolate sauce, mmmmm mmmmm delicious!", "author": "Peter S."}

What you do is smush the squash in with the rice and then you get double starch. Yum. We also had the Spinach Imperial (Pad Mee) that was very delish. I esp liked the shitake mushrooms in it. It was perfectly cooked with a slight tinge of burntness that makes it extra yum. The service was serviceable. efficient. bye.", "author": "sambacat w."}

The food smelled good, yet unfortunately my meal would not match the aroma. I ordered the coconut soup which, in the words of Droopy, was \"wary, wary bad.\" More like, \"Tasteless,\" which is even worse. I thought I was playing it safe by ordering the yellow curry, and soon found out that no such thing as a safety net exists in this joint. The chefs here have not quite figured out how to thoroughly cook vegetables. There was also this odd aftertaste with every bite....one should not have to ponder what him/her are eating....especially when dining out. I wish this restaurant nothing but  the impending doom it deserves.", "author": "Kenny G."}

Their only drawback is the fact that they don't deliver, but worth it to pick up.  I'm a creature of habit and only ever order Pad Kee Mao, however, when I ask for medium spicy they know how to find that perfect middle range. The pad kee mao is filled with a ton of vegetables, and the right amount of sauce, and somehow they know how to not get the rice noodles to stick together in one big glop like I've had at other places.", "author": "Jasmine B."}

I really enjoy their calamari, the Chicken in Yellow Curry (although the potatoes aren't always throughly cooked & it's pretty gross eating semi-cooked/semi-raw potatoes), other dishes that have slipped my mind and ALWAYS the Thai Iced Tea. The service is good and the restaurant is pretty spacious. I must say that it's pretty tough trying to enjoy a meal when there are people outside who are hungry and are panhandling for change. Parking is hit or miss, but all of these outside elements one must be prepared for when spending time down in the Haight. Keep up the good work Siam Lotus!", "author": "Sheila M."}

Food was delicious, service was great and price not too expensive. I would recommend trying everything on the menu as I'm pretty sure it's all good from what I had so far. You should also try the dishes on the chef special menu for something different from the usual. The northern curry egg noodle (kow soi) is a must try!! It's really good and I'm from the northern part of Thailand. The tom yum fried rice is also a must!! The thai tea float is a hidden gem on the menu. If you thought the thai tea was good, the float brings it to a whole other level. I thought the Pad Thai was also very yummy and very similar to what you would find in Thailand. The Pad Thai I've had down here in LA does not compare. The larb tofu was also very satisfying. Now on to the best part DESSERTS!! If you are going to get dessert get the Rotee. Words cannot describe how good this is. You just have to try it for yourself. The mango sticky rice is also good once in a while. However, if you are lucky, they also have dulce de leche cheesecake from time to time. It's one of the best cheesecakes I have ever had, even better than Cheesecake Factory!! So ask for it and you might be in for a real treat :)", "author": "Justin P."}

Ploy II is our favorite, so far, but it's not open for lunch.  So today we tried Siam Lotus.  We started with the Golden Triangles, which were tasty, but not necessarily divine.  I had a veggie tom kha, while Sweetie had a chicken tom kha.  Mine was clearly the superior soup.  I wasn't crazy about the floating half-mushrooms, which seemed not to have been very cooked.  I like my tom kha with straw mushrooms, not button.  Anyway, moving on, their lunch specials are really reasonably priced.  My shiitake/green bean stirfry with brown rice seemed to be very overly salty, but Sweetie's into that kind of thing, so he didn't see a problem.  He ordered the Thai basil chicken with white rice, and said it was really good.  I like that they use rooibos tea, which always gives a Thai iced tea that characteristic smoky flavor.  The servers were very friendly, and the decor is cute and interesting.  We'll come back for lunch, but I'll probably try something else next time.", "author": "L. M."}
