Starting off with an aperitif, we moved on to a charcuterie platter that was pretty eye opening. Awesome flavors and variations, we scarfed it down like we hadn't eaten all day. Next was salad and beef carpaccio. The salad I could have lived without but I guess it's hard to serve an entire meal of just meat. Last we had our choice of steak or pork. Most of the table went with the steak and surprisingly to all of us, the pork actually was the star of the night. The steak has a Moroccan type of spice that most of us weren't quite expecting. \n\nService with our waiter, Will, was on point once we got the ball rolling.", "author": "Leina K."}

My colleague and I both agreed, this was one of the best Cubanos we have ever had, and totally worth the $15 price tag.\n\nAlthough our food and drinks were de-lish, I do have a few minor gripes...\n\n1) It would be nice if the sandwich came with a small salad or cole slaw or some kind of side. Hell, even a few Kettle chips would be great (especially if you're charging $15).\n2) Service was a bit slow today. We ordered our food at 12:15pm, and our sandwiches didn't arrive until 12:40pm. \n3) The cocktails, although tasty, are still a bit rich for my blood.

We attempted to go for dinner one evening about a month ago, but we had no luck getting through the door without a reservation. We were finally able to have dinner there about 2 weeks ago, with 2 other friends. We sat outside on a cool August night and it was perfect. Not only is the restaurant beautiful, but the temperature was just right. \n\nTo start we all had a round of drinks. I had a dirty martini which was delicious, however I wish they had a variety of vodkas to pick from. But they only had one type which wasn't a huge deal. Everyone else had a crafted cocktail from their menu  which they seemed to enjoy quite a bit. We all had a second and possibly third round of drinks. \n\nThe waitress that was taking care of us was lovely, attentive and helpful. Their staff is awesome and always on their game. \n\nWe started out by ordering A charcuterie plate for the table. The meats were delicious and savory and there were 2 different kinds of pate. They were both very tasty but one was better than the other for sure. I can't remember which. \n\nFor our entree, my girlfriend and I had the salmon, accompanied by fresh tomatoes. It was exceptional. My boyfriend had the short rib, which was our favorite! Unfortunately they only had 1 order of short rib so he was the only one that got to enjoy it. I had a bite and loved it. I believe my other friend had some sort of lamb dish, but I could be mistaken. The food overall was above average. Every plate had different taste and was cooked to perfection. \n\nOverall we had an amazing time at Trou Normand. We will definitely be back, but probably when we're celebrating an occasion since it is kind of pricey. I would recommend Trou Normand to anyone who appreciates perfectly crafted meals and don't mind paying for it..", "author": "Tati C."}

I am definitely not a connoisseur when it comes to drinking but really!?  You literally served me a ~$15 cocktail...\n\nSecond, the food was expensive and not the best.  We ordered a spicy steak on the dinner menu, and it was salty at best.  I know the ingredients are fresh but it definitely didn't seem like that when it was served.  The cheese plate was also disappointing, as I had expected a good amount of cheese for the 30 something dollar plate we received... eh.\n\nTwo things I will say is that 1) their bread was great!  But then again, it was Acme bread, so when is that ever not great (the answer is never).  This could have also been toasted a little bit, so we didn't have to eat cold bread in wintry SF.  \n\n2) The outside patio provides a very nice space for large groups, and they can enclose that space if it gets cold at night.  This made the dining experience better, but the food was definitely lacking.\n\nOverall, I would skip if you want better cocktails and a more decent price.

At around $56 for 3 meats and 3 cheese, I expected more.\n\nAs for the empanadas, it was just ok. Really good chimichurri sauce; but a sauce alone wasn't enough to win me over in this case. Wouldn't recommend.\n\nFor dinner we shared the $95 30oz bone in rib eye. Lacking in flavor once again. Meat wasn't totally tender for a rib eye. Plus for presentation. Would not recommend either.\n\nDessert- strawberry powder donuts. This I do recommend. Sweet and delicate.\n\nHouse made strawberry soda- absolutely fantastic! \n\nOverall for $300ish for 3 people with only 1 beer and 1 cocktail. I would skip.

Trou Normand was actually not even on our bookmarks but since we were in the yelp building (next door) and we were starving for lunch, of course we yelped it and this place was the closest! \n\nWhen we walked in, we were immediately greeted by the hostess who showed us to our table which was outside.  I lost my husband along the way - well, specifically he went missing where the meats are being butchered and prepped.  You have to walk through this area to get to the outside seating.  Of course I knew exactly where to find him, salivating over all the yummy raw animal flesh.\n\nThe menu is not boring and is in fact, exotic.

The meats and cheeses were tasty and not too funky - same with the pate - really good rich flavor without being overwhelming.  \n\nI was a little bummed when I received the sparkling water I ordered because it had left over \"muddle\" of something from the previous drink. Yuck.  I brought it to their attention and it was righted real quick! In fact, the bartender himself was serving drinks and his apology negated any bad feelings about it. Sh*t happens. \n\nWe should have sat at one of the booths inside but it was a beautiful sunny day in the city so we decided to sit outside and ended up regretting it.  Our server knew we were getting kinda miserable toward the end of our meal, and he helped hurry us out of the hot sun.\n\nThe atmosphere here is casual.

Great food, great drinks, and great service and, unlike many bars in the neighborhood, it isn't jam packed with the after work crowd. \n\nMy wife and I popped in around 5.45, after giving up on getting a seat at Novella. We had no problem getting seated, even though it's a fairly small space. \n\nIt's also a very interesting space, less than 15 feet wide, including the bar, but close to twice as high, with cool artwork and warm lighting that help it feel chic yet comfortable. \n\nIt's not just the ceiling that is unusually high: the prices are up there too. So much so that I'm glad we just had the sumptuous charcuterie and not a three course meal. \n\nBut it was fantastic food. We got the chefs choice, with three cheeses, plus salami, pate, duck terrine, and more. It was all delicious. I don't think I've had Brabander cheese since I lived in Holland 20+years and I certainly don't remember it being so good. The meats were the highlight of a great plate. But Even the bread and mustard were a cut above. And the olives were amazing. \n\nThe cocktails are equally high quality and high priced. While I was complaining that they don't have beer on tap, my wife got me a monkey gland. A rather macho name for a small pink drink. But it was delicious. I don't know what was in it, but I'm guessing gin, absinthe, and grapefruit juice. Whatever it was, it was subtle yet strong. \n\nService was unobtrusively attentive and swift. In other words: perfect.\n\nThe space was filling up when we left a little after 7. If I were to plan on dinner there I would definitely book ahead.

I'd already eaten a normal-sized dinner, but thought I could sneak by with a cozy glass of wine, just to be social. That was before they ordered half of the freaking dinner menu and an $80 charcuterie plate. Holy sh- this place is not messing around; if you're looking for a solid place to bring a date or see where veganism goes to die, get yourself a table at Trou Normand and roll with where it takes you. \n\nAs someone who grew up on a diet heavy on your Czech staples (kielbasa, meatballs, and head cheese), I was delighted by the cured meats, mortadella with pistachio, and (yep) the head cheese (Classic head cheese is made by boiling the head of a pig, and eating all the bits that come off of it that have congealed in the natural collagen of the head. I think they call it head 'cheese' just to screw with people that are already grossed out by the concept). The meatballs were outstanding, and the grilled pork chop had a rind of incredibly melty fat on it that put all of my week's worth of dieting to pathetic shame. \n\nThe wine list and vegetables had a hard time holding up to the meat entrees and charcuterie - our small plate of asparagus was fine, but let's not kid ourselves here, no one was going after asparagus when they walked in the door. We had a couple bottles of French reds, which were both fine, but neither particularly complemented the food we had. Oh well. \n\nIf you're okay with shelling out a bit of cash for a solid meal, Trou Normand is definitely worth a visit. A word from the newly wise, however: Don't go here on a full stomach, and pace yourself - 1 entree, 2 small plates and some wine are a great to start between 2 people.

We got reservations the night of, which was actually pretty surprising since the restaurant seemed packed. We were seated outside in the garden/house area which was well-lit and really nicely decorated.\n\nThis restaurant focuses on whole animal butchery (not sure if that's the correct terminology but basically they don't waste any animal byproducts). You can tell that they put a lot of effort into setting themselves apart from other restaurants. However, I just wasn't very impressed by the food itself.\n\nWe had excellent service the entire evening, which was a pro. We ordered a plate of charcuterie (you can't choose which meats you'd like, it comes pre-set), beef short ribs, pork chop, fruit + whipped cream dessert, and a bottle of Syrah ($88 - all of the wines are quite pricey ranging to ~$200+). The charcuterie was pretty good, but the pork chop and beef short ribs were more on the dry side. Maybe we just ordered the wrong entrees? The whipped cream and fruit dessert was very fresh - I'm normally not the biggest fan of whipped cream but I couldn't stop myself from eating it. Portions were decently large, I remember not being hungry for a few hours after the meal.\n\nThe meal was pretty pricey at ~$100 per person with drinks. Overall, nothing out of the ordinary for me.

The leg was better, more fatty and tender. They sprinkled a bit too much rock salt, so the sodium was real.\nMashed Kabocha Squash brussels sprouts, gremolata: My favorite out of the whole dinner. This was a side dish, but the squash and brussels sprouts were so good, great combo with the hint of lemon!\nCharcuterie: We did a combination/small for this, you can think of it as a omakase, but charcuterie. We have various of meats and a rabbit p\u00e2t\u00e9. It was OK, wasn't too crazy about everything. The rabbit p\u00e2t\u00e9, I personally didn't like it, my boyfriend thought it was decent. I prefer duck more.\nSoft eggs with trout: Pretty good, you can't wrong with this combination\n\nOverall, OK good, great environment and good place to sit down with friends and enjoy some drinks and small dishes!", "author": "Natalie L."}

They try to have really good service like they are on the refilling the water but lacked the communication.  We were sitting at our table and received the request if any drink orders then it all slowed down to finally they did come to take the dinner order which we had a long wait for our food - this is where it was a shame as they finally brought loaves of phenomenal bread for us with olive oil or Sierra Nevada butter (phenomenal).  They brought us more bread as we were still waiting for our food. \n\nAt first I had hoped for the black cod but it wasn't on the menu this go around so I heard they butcher their own meat so I asked meatballs or sausage.  She said sausage (but after the fact, I wish I'd done the meatballs).  The sausage was good but really rich and overcoming so I could only eat so much of it.  Someone else had the pork chop which was disappointing as it was a dry pork chop.  The lamb shank was beautiful and I wish they noted in the menu that it should be shared as it was massive.  The lamb shank was shared but not communicating that makes me wonder if many don't order it as it's pricey but not if its shared.  \n\nTo make up for the delays, they comped us beignets and a little sparkly drink (can't remember the name).  \n\nIt's a trendy spot.  The bar drinks were interesting and really good as I had the Wildflower.  Inside was booth seating and small then you head out to the patio which was nicely covered for SF but chilly.  And someone mention communal seating where it's long tables and you may end up sharing with someone on another end.  \n\nI think communication is an issue there as they are really trying to succeed but you waited really long not knowing; I asked to take the rest home and had no idea what came of it but she said it was on the side waiting for me which was a nice touch but I didn't know. This means like other places did it get tossed by accident?; it was a relief to receive bread which was phenomenal but it was so delayed.  There's just something missing.", "author": "Denise L."}

I had the fried chicken, which, even though it was a starter, was really tasty. The breading was panko or something similar and had the perfect amount of crispy juicy and salty. They were paired with beans (?) and an herby sauce. My fiancee got the persimmon toast with fresh ricotta and we split an avocado/artichoke salad. The salad was good, but they went a little high on the oil so by the end everything was just kind of swimming in a pool of oil.\nThe amount of time it took to get our food was excruciating, which is why the rating gets knocked down.", "author": "Samir K."}

The bar boasts high ceilings, dim lights, plush leather booths to cozy up in and a cool eye-catching mural on the wall.  We were able to score the last two seats at the end of the bar by the server station and were immediately greeted by the bartender who gave us a cocktail list to look over.  \n\nCocktails are all priced around $13 - $17, glasses of wine are $12 - $18 and draft beer is $6 +.  We were in the mood for some nice cocktails so we started with the Daiquiri ($12) and Brown Derby ($14).  The Daiquiri was so refreshing with the mint and lime, I could have drank this down wayyyy to fast, but thankfully I only took a sip of my fianc\u00e9's and was able to enjoy my Brown Derby.  The brown derby was a nice bold bourbon drink that was simple and smooth.  Round two we went for the Single Village Fix ($14) and the Corpse Reviver ($16).  The Single Village Fix was a tart mescal drink, but very well balanced and also very drinkable.  The Corpse Reviver (I have had some other variations on this classic cocktail) was an interesting twist, my fianc\u00e9 sore it tasted like apply juice (in a good way), but I felt it had some nice citrus notes and paired perfectly.\n\nWe didn't grab food here but what I saw the others at the bar getting looked good.  The service was excellent the whole time we were here.  The bartenders made it a point to chat with us, talk about our plans for the night, etc. making this a better experience than some places where they just give you a drink and walk away.  By the time we left the bar was completely full and there were a lot of people sitting down and enjoying dinner for the night.

However, we were heading to the SF Symphony with some friends and they chose Trou Normand as our pre-Symphony stop. I trust their judgement in all things, so away we went.\n\nMy friend had made a reservation for us, so I assumed it would be a busy place. Imagine my surprise when we were the only people there! I'm glad he made the reservation though, because within 30 minutes the little place had filled up. So Yelpers, take note: it IS a busy little place - make the reservation.\n\nFor me, the stars of the show here are the cocktails. They are strong and they are delicious. We all tried each other's drinks and enjoyed each one. I really liked the Mescal Daisy. \n\nFor dinner, we ordered a couple charcuterie boards and an entree each. I opted for dessert for dinner which was a great choice! I had some sort of berry pie with fresh whipped cream which was next level good. The charcuterie board was generous and my husband especially loved the blue cheese stuffed figs.

Service was friendly, lovely, and attentive. \n\nWe chose to share a small charcuterie board as our appetizer. We shared our main dishes with each other as well: a Pork Sausage Tartine and a Lamb Shank dish. \n\nThe small charcuterie board allowed for four options so we chose Sofia goat cheese, salami, beef bologna, and a spicy spread I forgot the name of. It also came with a few pieces of epi bread, mustard grains, and a small side salad of what I think was parsley and fennel. Everything was great though I loved the Sofia cheese the most (and not because of the name). I'd recommend the salami over the other choices of meat we selected. \n\nThe tartine we ordered was delicious! The toast had a great hearty crunch to it that you can only get from a good quality bread. The greens added a brightness while the sausage added a sweet and savory, juicy flavor. The avocado was creamy and really added texture while bringing all of the components of the dish together. The egg...was amazing and really added a satisfying lusciousness to the whole thing!\n\nThe lamb shank was tender though the surprising favorites were their tomatoes (bright and juicy) and the beans which added a hearty comforting feel to the dish. \n\nLovely though a bit pricey, I would say this was a good experience.", "author": "Sofia R."}

Some Four Barrel coffee to round things out.\n\nTrou Normand is around the corner from the entrance of the new SFMOMA (you can cut through the alley and you are there) so this is a well placed pre-museum brunch stop.

Mourad flanks the office entrance on the right while Trou Normand is to the left.  \nComing mid morning, I found parking on 2nd Street, just a block away.  I bumped into my cousin walking there so, when we entered, we were led to a large table under their greenhouse outdoor dining area.  It was mostly full and packed by the time we left.  \nAfter a quick menu study and some discussion, here's what I tried:\n\nShared\n1) Charcuterie board (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1-jevt-NqsrkgufRFcm9tQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - My cousin chose the eight item combination for our party of six and we barely finished it.

They had the rabbit and enjoyed mine more.\n\nThe breads, which I believe came from Acme, were delicious and fresh, perfect accompaniments to their breakfast menu whether it was the prosciutto, salumis, or just to sop up runny egg yolk from their dishes.  Our waiter was efficient and very precise in pointing our recommendations to us.  Prices were average for the area especially being a newer entry to this booming neighborhood.  I didn't know the charcuterie price, which was not cheap, until reviewing their online menu.  The diners were a mix of 20's to 30's groups outside and couples and tourists inside; if you're dining alone, you can sidle up to the bar.\nThanks to my kind and generous cousin, we enjoyed good food, service, and, of course, company.

Every place we went in was so loud, there was no way we could've had a non-yelling conversation. Trou Normand was the closest thing we found. The bar is very small and all the seats are reserved for dinner guests so we didn't think we'd be able to stay. But it was early so I told the concierge that we would only be an hour and he let us sit in one of the booths. \n\nI didn't feel like spending time deciding on a fancy cocktail, so I just ordered a vodka martini with olives. The waiter literally said \"we don't do olives\". I was so shocked that I couldn't say anything for a moment. Then I said, \"what?\" Its a policy. They don't have olives in the bar and they don't do olives in drinks. Dumbfounded, I meekly asked if I could have a twist, and he said yes. \n\nAfter he left, I noticed the cover of the bar menu; an illustration of an olive branch with olives on it. Hilarious!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-11-15", "description": "Trou Normand is an ok brunch place -- I've definitely been to better brunch places in the city that are also not as pricey. The restaurant itself is pretty small, and you would need a reservation to guarantee that you can have a table to sit at because there are so few tables. However, the space doesn't feel small because the ceilings are very high and the door frames are also very tall and exaggerated and the two walls facing the street have long built in windows to allow in lots of natural light. \n\nNormally this is something I wouldn't comment on, but I found the paintings in the restaurant to be quite distracting. There were lots of paintings of naked women around the restaurant and while the artwork was tasteful, I also found it to be, well, odd. I'm not sure what aesthetic they were trying to go for with the theme they chose, but I personally wasn't a fan. \n\nThe service was also a bit spotty, but I don't think it was our server's fault necessarily because I think he was spread thin, having to serve many tables at once. An example of the spotty service was that when I had arrived a few minutes after my group who had already been seated, the server did not provide me with a plate or cutlery even after our appetizers came out until I had asked him to do so, and even when I did, I had to ask him again for a napkin. Normally a customer shouldn't have to ask for these things -- it should be provided automatically, but again I think our server was spread too thin.\n\nNow onto the food and drink!\n\nAPPETIZERS:\n\n1) Apple pop tart with bourbon caramel - This was a meh dish because while the tart itself was crispy, the apples were too finely chopped and had no real flavor and the bourbon caramel was a little too bitter from the bourbon for my liking.\n\n2) Grilled fuyu persimmons - This dish had two pieces of bread lightly toasted with butter, a slice of the creamiest goat cheese that spread like butter on the bread, and two grilled persimmons which were so incredibly juicy and being grilled really brought out the sweetness of the fruit while giving it a soft and warm texture. This was my favorite dish of the morning and I highly recommend it!\n\nMAIN COURSE:\n\n3) Scrambled eggs with trout - This dish was the most disappointing for me as I didn't think there was anything particularly special or amazing about it. The scrambled eggs weren't transformed in any way, and the trout and cream cheese were kept on the side of the scramble. None of the ingredients were transformed or even enhanced in any way, and I honestly felt like I could have prepared this dish on my own with items in my fridge currently. \n\nDRINK:\n\n4) Supreme cocktail - This cocktail has calvados, lemon, orgeat, grenadine, and it was really delicious and complimented the meal well. The drink was semisweet and pretty strong, so I'd recommend this as a dinner drink rather than a brunch drink. \n\nOverall, I think if you are a meat lover, you may really enjoy this restaurant, but as someone who is a pescatarian, I expected a lot more, especially given the price point. I do not see myself coming back to Trou Normande again as there are much better brunch places out there!", "author": "Pooja M."}

We dropped in on a Sunday and were seated right away and the meal only got better from there.\n\nWe started off with a chef's selection plate and a cheese and we enjoyed all the choices.

The goat cheese was a bit strong by itself, but I loved mixing it with the dates we had on the plate. \n\nAnd, the entrees were great too! I was trying to find the exact names of what we had, but apparently the menus change daily according to their website (that means I definitely have to go back!!).

Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning and ordered the small Charcuterie Board Chef's Selection. This one came with four selections of 1) the Duck Pate which had figs and rosemary 2) the Pork Pate which had fennel and thyme 3) the Cayenne Salame with garlic and white wine and 4) 19 MONTH PROSCIUTTO. I also added the Brunet cheese, which is pasteurized goat's milk from Italy. Got to have some cheese with a Charcuterie Board!\n\nWhat I loved was the Duck Pate, the 19 MONTH PROSCIUTTO and the Brunet cheese. All were delicious. The Brunet cheese was so soft, rich and buttery, and I loved that they serve local Acme Bread! The downside was that they only gave me two pieces of bread to start (Which really equated to ONE piece of bread cut diagonally in half.) so I ordered four more pieces of bread thinking it was part of the Charcuterie Board. Turns out it's $2 for two pieces so I ended up paying an extra $4 for BREAD. I was so upset. Anyway, I really did not like the Pork Pate at all. The texture was a bit stiffer in a weird way and stringy. The Cayenne Salame was alright, nothing special. \n\nOverall, Trou doesn't have much in terms of selection for brunch. Hence - The three stars. I think that's why I ended up ordering a Charcuterie Board. There seems to be a lot more selection during lunch and dinner so I would love to come back and try Trou once more.

I returned with a large group in early March.\n\nFood: The charcuterie program is the best! The empanadas are amazing. They really like to use salt. Our group dining included really great salads, but it is a really meat-heavy menu, so vegetarians beware.  The menu is trying to be Euro-inspired California cuisine. The server kept talking about the owner's passion for telling stories with their menus, but this story needs a good editor. \n\nAlso... the thing about open kitchens is, if you have a chef that's going to be screaming at the servers and cooks, it's on display for everyone to see/hear. I know chefs typically have big egos, but this food is good not great.  He could stand to eat a slice of humble pie, (maybe he could add it to their lame 2 item dessert menu).\n\nDrinks: Their specialty cocktails include ingredients I had never seen before, but it was all great. When I came in with a big group the service was still fast considering the recipes they're working with. \n\nService: We had the same server, Cat, on both occasions. She was friendly and knowledgeable about the food and beverages. She spoke well about their butcher/charcuterie, and general mission of the restaurant. Her service was attentive and warm. We could tell she is really passionate about their ingredients, and really won me over to why I should be happy to pay as much as I did for ok food. \n\nAll in all it's pricey place, but if you like to support slow food and their whole mission of using the whole animal etc, the service and drinks are good and it's definitely worth a visit.", "author": "Nb P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-08-01", "description": "Let me preface this review by saying that I have worked as a server in the past. Actually I worked just down the block from Trou Normad. \n\nWe were a party of 7 on Sunday after the SF marathon. We were seated almost immediately. Tables were filled, but it wasn't exceptionally busy. Guests looked like they were mosey-ing brunch at a very comfortable pace (and so were the staff).\n\nThe food was mediocre.  I ordered \"crispy duck confit\" and got a whole golden potato, 2 poached eggs, on a light \"sleeping bag\" of what appeared to be collard greens, 5-6 shreds of duck, all slathered in hollandaise sauce for $23. Safe to say I was disappointed. The flavor doesn't make up for it. Also, it took 30-45 minutes for the food to come to the table. The kitchen was slow, which was fine, but the service.... \n\nThe service was horrendous and, dare I say, discriminatory. I hate to pull this card, but after a day I can't shake the feeling. We were a table of multi-racial individuals from age 25-45. \n\nWe were seated and then promptly ignored without greeting or water for at least 15 min. At which point we had to flag down a server.  Our server had the most blaz\u00e8 attitude toward our table. I ordered an iced tea and asked for a pitcher/jug of water for the table considering the water glasses were basically shot glasses and I saw other tables have a large container of communal water. I asked twice, she said yes, nothing came. When she did refill our glasses, I asked for a larger glass, which she filled halfway. I know we're in a drought but come on this is ridiculous. We sat for long periods(30-45 min) with empty glasses at the table. \n\nI get it, a table of 7 sucks. But it's Sunday brunch, it happens all the time. Our server barely did the minimum: took our order, brought our order. \n\nWe saw a surprising increased response rate from the server when our seemingly white male friend was at the table for a portion of the meal.  When he left, the service deteriorated. \n\nOur check took forever to come. It took 15-20 minutes to then process our payment, which was NOT hard because it was cash and a card.  \n\nWe were in Trou Normad for a total of 3 hours from start to finish. And this is after the marathon, which some of us ran, we inhaled that food.  Most of the time we were waiting. \n\nThis is the first time , ever, I did not leave a tip.  And I frequent hole-in-the-wall Asian restaurants with horrendous service.  But at least at those establishments we got what we asked for at least. Again, I was a server before. I get that servers NEED to be tipped at least 15% for bare minimum service. This place was awful. I don't understand the good reviews it received.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

I waited tables and bartended for over a decade and I get it. \n\nFront of the house. \nBack of the house. \nLiving wage. \nThe struggle is real. \n\nHaving 20% included on everything doesn't bother me at all - in fact, I think it'll save me some scratch since I'm an over-tipper given my history in the service industry... but what does bother me is that the prices at Trou, a place my colleagues and I were regulars at, definitely went up closer to 30% than 20% with that change and the service 100% went down. \n\nIf it was just the 20% I'd let it slide because good or meh service, I still tip at least that always, but 30% more for everything + now you're being taxed on the tip amount as well + it feels like the servers/bartenders now just know they've got theirs coming so there's no point in really offering much service, which was absolutely the case on what was possibly our last visit. \n\nIf I'm paying $18 for a single glass of wine on the low end of the menu, I'd like just a little bit of cordialness to come with it.  \n\nI know everyone loves their cheese and meat plates and all that jazz but I just think they're aight. We would come a lot for lunch and you'll see a pretty typical SF style menu with carefully portioned ala carte plates and privileged lunchtime diner prices, which is expected for a place with as nice of digs as Trou has, but I've never been wowed and I've never left feeling like my food was more than a healthy snack. \n\nI mean, now I don't really have to worry about it because we've pretty much been priced out of coming here... at least when I know Mourad is just 2 doors down, with what is now very similar beverage price points and much higher service quality... and gladly tip on top of it. \n\nAlso, to be fair, I've never had their breakfast sandwich (which I've heard is on another level) so maybe I'll be singing a different tune some other time, but with so many places to spend what little extra payola is left after rent, I just don't think I can justify the jump in price and drop in customer care. \n\nIt's still a beautiful place and if you're going on an expendable business account or are taking home one of those SF tech money paychecks it's a totally decent place, I'm just in a bracket where I need my money to work harder than that.", "author": "Candice G."}

It was good, but it didn't make my eyes roll back in my head.   At $24, it was the most reasonably priced item that we ordered.\n\nBeef Shank Tagliatelle - $28!??!   Seriously?   It was a relatively small portion of pasta, and although tasty, it was really nothing inventive enough to justify that price point.   To put things in perspective, when were at Octavia last month, we ordered an exquisite papardelle appetizer that was totally unique and delicious....unlike anything I had ever had before.   It was only $14.   But that was only an appetizer, you say?   Yeah, about that......at Trou Normand they were offering a side of Chard for $15.......FUCKING CHARD!!!!!   \n\nThe most mind boggling thing was the price on the cocktails.   They were clocking in an average of $15 and trust me when I say, this was NOT, in any capacity, a cocktail that was worth $15.  I would have been happy paying 10 or 11 tops for that.   It was a gin cocktail that was good, but there wasn't anything about it that was special.   I feel like I have had that cocktail 15 times before.\n\nThey seated us out in this enclosed patio area that is actually pretty cool.   It is a glass enclosed greenhouse like space and you can see all of the buildings above you.  The problem is that the sides flap open and it was really windy.   There are heaters inside over all of the tables, but unfortunately the one above ours was not working.   We asked to be seated elsewhere or even down at the end of the the table (tables are all communal) where there was heat.   The waitress came back and gave us some bullshit about how every other table was reserved and that there was nothing that she could do.......there was literally one other table that had people at it in this area.   Apparently at this establishment, walk-ins are seen as lesser-thans in relation to those who have made a reservation, and are, thus, the ones deserving of being subjected to the cold.\n\nI just read in another review that they had switched to the gratuity included model in their pricing.   If that is the case, then I am even more infuriated, as this was not clearly worded on the menu, was not told to us by the server and, when the bill arrived, there was also no mention of this, and there was even a line to enter the tip amount, which we did.\n\nSo yeah, take your money elsewhere.

Everything was great, but the ciccioli was the highlight, with intense porky flavor.  I got the lamb for my main, which was perfectly cooked, although the sauce was not especially exciting.  Compared to the other mains I saw at other tables (and their prices on the menu), it seemed like the lamb was certainly the best value.\n\nOverall, the charcuterie was awesome, and the atmosphere was great.

I had reservations and we were seated promptly when we arrived. All of the seating in communal, which I don't like but I don't hate. In some places it is fine, but here it was really annoying. We sat between two other couples.\n\nThe menu is interesting. They have some entrees and small plates but what they're known for is their charcuterie and salumi board. We got one and it was good, but nothing to rave about. We were squished between two couples at this table with a giant cutting board full of charcuterie. It would have been impossible to eat an entree as we were too squished in between the couple to move. The servers kept putting bottles of water on the table, which is great, but it took up too much room. It was really awkward.\n\nThe drinks were really good. The owners are the same as Bar Agricole so it has a similar feel and similarly inspired menu.\n\nThe service was strange. We ordered our drinks from one guy and literally 30 seconds later a woman came to take our drink order. At one point we ordered the arancini and we were corrected that it's pronounced \"air-an-chee-nee.\" Ok, dude, I get it. That's not how the Italians pronounce it, but we're not Italian. You knew what we were talking about.\n\nLuckily I had a feeling what the Norman Hole would be like so I made a reservation at Dirty Habit right after and enjoyed myself immensely there.", "author": "Ryan L."}

I would need that corporate expense account to woo clients with fancy booze!\n\nAs sister restaurant to Bar Agricole with a fantastic bar program making them a James Beard nominee, it was no surprise that I adored their buzzingly strong cocktails at Trou Normand. I had the Demsey: gin, calvados, grenadine, absinthe ($12: http://bit.ly/1nMV5kY) and the Plaza: gin, italian vermouth, pineapple ($12: http://bit.ly/1u3e51A). There wasn't much of it but do they pack a big punch. \n\nAlong with your buzztastic cocktails, their charcuterie menu is not to be missed. Not only are their charcuterie made in-house but there are over 20 selections a day; the most I've ever seen for a restaurant. It doesn't come cheap though. Make your own combo with selections that range from $6-$12 each or choose a chef's platter for $21 - $63. We decided to make our own with dry cured belly, lardo sumac, chicken pate, dry guanciale & headcheese ($42): http://bit.ly/ZY8njl. Everything was top-notch but the dry cured belly and dry guanciale were my favs. Skip the chicken pate, it wasn't rich nor creamy; more like a chicken meatloaf. I wish they threw in some pickled veggies and cornichons to help cut through the salty richness. \n\nUnfortunately, the praise stops here. \n\nTheir entrees are ridiculously overpriced for mediocrity. Over $30 for an entree with no sides? Their menu changes regularly but you can skip their Roast Pork ($32): http://bit.ly/1rHO3JD if it's on the menu. I was hoping for a crackly skin but it was just incredibly sinewy and flabby. The Pappardelle w/ braised pork shank ($17) fared better but wasn't spectacular: http://bit.ly/1oVr7MD. I wish the noodles had more of a bite to it but it was a bargain compared to the other menu items.  We also ordered the Arancini ($7) which were like bland balls: http://bit.ly/1xAhrpC. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered a slice of Mission Pie's Banana Cream Pie but it was an obviously old slice of pie ($8): http://bit.ly/1yGwwax. Our waiter took it off the bill but my picture of it was flagged and removed (by management?) on Yelp several days later for \"misrepresenting the restaurant\". Umm who served the old pie? Not moi. Shady. *Tsk Tsk*\n\nEqually unimpressive was the hipster 'tude service. The staff was absolutely wonderful at Bar Agricole; they were welcoming, attentive and swift. Did HR fall asleep at the interview table?\n\nWith the exception of the busboys, the hostess and wait staff weren't at the least bit friendly and service was slow as molasses. We had to ask the busboy several times to chase down our waiter because he was MIA or too busy chatting with other servers at the corner. What annoys me is Trou Normand (along with Bar Agricole) will now be charging an 20% auto-gratuity on ALL bills: http://bit.ly/1zesKYV. We always tip a minimum of 18% but a tip should be earned NOT demanded. Besides, you guys aren't the French Laundry or a Saison nor is the service even close to that caliber.\n\nDon't get me started on the communal seating (no individual tables).

I came here for a company event that had the whole back room reserved with an open bar and a small buffet of dishes (mostly appetizers that are typically served here). Overall, I was extremely impressed by the quality and deliciousness of both the cocktails and the food.\n\nFrom the bar, I started with a cocktail called the Brown Derby, made from bourbon, grapefruit, lemon, honey, and aromatic bitters. I'll admit that I'm no expert on cocktails, but this drink was very delicious and was the perfect mix of sweet, tart, and slightly bitter. I went on to the buffet of appetizers and was extremely impressed--some of the standouts to me were the duck pate and rabbit pate (which both had extremely distinct flavors characteristic of the two meats), the arancini, which was creamy and smoky with a distinct flavor from the anise, and, my favorite by far, the pork meatballs. \"Meatballs\" was a bit of a misnomer, as this dish consisted of chunks of ground pork that were grilled, sliced, and served over an absolutely wonderful, savory tomato-based sauce. Towards the end of the evening, there were a plate of cookies put out on the bar as well, and I absolutely loved the peanut butter and the chocolate chip cookies, which were chewy, soft, and buttery!\n\nOverall, Trou Normand was a fantastic venue for our company event--though I didn't have a typical \"dinner\" here, the flavors of the dishes and drinks I did try were all unique and delicious, and it would be a fun experience to return!", "author": "David K."}

Drinkswise, since everyone was hungover still (except me), we didn't end up getting drinks.  I ended up ordering the poached eggs with corned beef hash and we shared a plate of the pork belly.  The pork belly was nicely fried and oh so tender. \n\nHowever, I had to come back another night to try their charcuterie board. I came in on a Friday night and there weren't too many people. They had a few seats at the bar so I sat down and ordered a drink and the small board. The drink I got was the Hawaiian.  It was good but by the end of it, I felt like I was drinking the alcohol and not the mixers. \n\nThe charcuterie board was great with the 4 choices - the dried cured belly, rabbit pate, salami, and mortadella.

It has been a long and arduous journey, my friends.\n\nYou should see how many times bartenders would stop and think whenever I request for a mocktail. Or the numerous times when I just had an \"OK\" mocktail and I shake my head because I'm wasting calories on something that doesn't even taste good.\n\nTrou Normand blew me away. Coming from the Bar Agricole team, I knew they'd have top notch bartenders. But she made me a mocktail with pineapple, ginger, lime and a touch of cream at the top. I like the foamy presentation! And the best part? it actually TASTED so, so good. For a MOCKTAIL.  Can you imagine what she could do with the real thing?!  I'm in LOVE already.\n\nI'm also in love with the beautiful space. It's very New York: high concrete ceilings, exposed brick, roomy leather tufted booths. Modern art on the walls. Sexy, minimalist space suited for the after work crowd in the Fidi. \n\nThe charcuterie selection is very impressive. With over 20 housemade concoctions, I had a difficult time narrowing my choices to just 6. The duck galantine with pear, rosemary and cinnamon was the standout of the crew. Others we tried were mortadella, lardo, porcini/anise salami and duck pate. Ask for plenty of pain epi acme bread to go with it. \n\nThe entrees were all equally good and well prepared. Lamb ragu, the lamb 3 ways, Petrale sole and roasted pork coppa.  However, the price point (it didn't include sides) is very expensive. Separate charges for sides? come on, this isn't a steakhouse.\n\nDepending on the mood, the \"European style\" service might not be for some and towards the end we had to flag her down for our check. The good thing is, they will not kick you out of here no matter how long you want to stay at the table.

But with high ceilings, of course (it's SoMa after all), and its setting in the Pac Bell building gives it an appropriate retro-vintage vibe that makes it a magnet for hipster foodies (photo: http://bit.ly/1nVJQW9). It's no surprise that Yelp has moved into the classic Art Deco building, and this makes an ideal happy hour destination if you can manage to grab a seat at the bar. You can eat here, and a lot of the small plates looked delicious as they whizzed by, but be forewarned there are only five booths and a community table in the back. Jamie W. and I came for the cocktails, and we weren't disappointed.\n\nBefore we ordered, we couldn't help but notice the large sketch of a naked woman in repose on the wall. Despite the scale, the approach to the drawing is quite minimal, somehow suitable for the casual ambiance (photo: http://bit.ly/1lyU0WK). Similar to Bar Agricole, Trou Normand offers a seductive mixed drink selection, and the bartender helped us sift through the choices. Jamie settled on the $11 Hawaiian, a tantalizing tropical mix of Calvados, chartreuse, pineapple and lime, that had nothing to do with a Blue Hawaii. I went for the slightly more urban $11 Brandy Scaffa, which blended raspberry and chartreuse into the cognac (photo: http://bit.ly/1jI4bGE). The combination packed a subtle wallop that lured me into ordering another.\n\nAlthough the $27 Grilled Pork Chop and the $38 Charcuterie Plate looked worthy enough for a satisfying meal, we had just eaten at Henry's Hunan across the street so we were in no condition to gorge. But something sweet was not out of the question, and they offer a couple of desserts. We decided to share a $9 slice of the Apple Rhubarb Mission Pie a la Mode (photo: http://bit.ly/1t4tpGL). Sure, it was tasty but hardly reflective of their kitchen, I hope. Anyway, timing is everything if you plan on coming after work or on the weekends. We got lucky since we got the last two available seats at the bar, but others were hovering quite a bit before giving up entirely. They should just relax and have a couple of Trou Normand shots to neutralize their Type-A personalities.\n\nFOOD/DRINKS - 4 stars...I can't go by the pie alone, but the cocktails are easily on par with the ones served at Bar Agricole\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...small as it is, I like the casual vibe in here\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...the bartenders are stellar here\nTOTAL - 4 stars...would definitely like to come back for a little pig, a little salumi and a whole lotta cocktails", "author": "Ed U."}

That's right, we're big risk takers. \n\nWe were greeted promptly at the door by a cheerful host who informed us that the wait would be 30 minutes. My buddy was less than pleased--but I don't think she was within her right on this one. If I go to a restaurant such as TN without a reservation, I don't expect that I'll be seated promptly. It's all about managing your expectations, after all. At any rate, I'm okay with that, however, as I use the extra time as an excuse to imbibe a few extra adult beverages. \n\nMy friend and I both ordered champagne. I note that TN has an impressive cocktail menu, although you'll also note that my days of \"craft cocktails\" are pretty much over. I don't like waking up with fried rice in my hair. At all. \n\nWe were sat at a community table, much to my friend's chagrin. Having spent many years in the People's Republic of Berkeley, I am less abject to community seating, although I admit that I don't love it. It wasn't that bad at TN, but please be advised you're going to see a big hipster factor. You should prepare accordingly. \n\nOnto food. We ordered a side of broccoli, a side of peas, and a side of polenta. All three of these dishes sound pretty boring, don't they? Not a chance. All three were slammin. Whatever sauce those peas were in? Yes, please. Pretty expensive for a side of veggies - noted for the record. \n\nWe ordered apple rhubarb pie with ice cream for dessert. I've never had anything rhubarb before, and this was a pleasing introduction. It was decent, and definitely satisfied my seemingly unsatisfiable sweet tooth. \n\nOverall, TN was a pretty good experience. Brace yourself for hipsters. Enjoy a few drinks at the bar.

We had to wait a tiny bit, but it wasn't too long before we got seated.\n\nBetween the 6 of us, we ordered the following:\n1) MEDIUM CHARCUTERIE + SALUMI BOARD: 8 items. I can't recall what we had exactly, but I have to say -- everything on there was just top notch. My favorite was the chicken p\u00e2te\u00e9.\n2) BUTTER LETTUCE: Very good -- the ch\u00e8vre complimented the strawberries excellently.\n3) SUMMER SQUASH: I love squash. I love pesto. However, the dish was slightly underwhelming. Would skip.\n4) ARANCINI: This was so good that we ordered TWO of them (it was also because we had 6 people and it only comes in 4). But damn, it was hella good. I was trying to consume it as fast as I can despite the fact that it was burning hot from the kitchen. haha\n5) PICKLES: Pickled varieties. Great little starter.\n\n6) GRILLED PORK CHOP: MAN. This was hella good. I loved it. Would definitely recommend!\n7) TAGLIATELLE: We were all definitely amazed by this dish. We were all super impressed and very happy with the pasta.\n8) HALIBUT: I didn't have much of this, but wasn't amazed by this dish like how I was with the rest of the entr\u00e9es that we orderd.\n9) PORK MEATBALLS: Maybe I'm a sucker for meat in red sauce. This was REALLY good as well.\n\n10) GRILLED CORN: Didn't have much of this -- just had the corn and no padrons. I think I could've passed.\n11) JAPANESE EGGPLANT: Surprisingly not bad. The lamb panchetta with the eggplant and the yogurt complimented each other well. I was a little worried at first, but dannnng - it was good. \n\nAND THEN WE ORDERED DESSERT:\n12) SEMOLINA CAKE: The strawberry sauce was just SO GOOD. This is a great cake for those who like something light.\n13) MEYER LEMON TART: I'm usually a big fan of lemon tarts, but I think because the other two desserts that I had were SUPER sweet that this tasted WAY too sour. Wish I had this before all the other desserts.\n14) CHOCOLATE POT DE CREME: I'm usually not a big fan of chocolate-related desserts. However, this was AMAZING. The toffee crunch was just the cherry on top.\n\nDRINKS: We all ordered something different. I, myself, had the Brown Derby. Definite recommend to those who like something a little sour.

The burger did not come with any sort of side and they did not deduct it from our bill or give us a discount, even after the inconvenience. I eat a lot of vegetarian dishes, and pretty much the only options in that regard were the salad and the French toast. The French toast was good, but it was not worth the price.

Currently, mixed drinks are $15, wines are mostly $15, and beers start at $9 for a Stiegl (which sells for less than $3 in a store). Last year it was already steep given the mixed drinks are in smaller-than-average glasses, but $15 is just too much; even at Valencia street's or the Embarcadero's fanciest restaurants (or Mourad, in the same building!), the cocktails are $11-13.\n\nI love the house-made charcuterie and staff revenue-sharing concept, the latter of which I understand usually raises the price of an average item. But it was already expensive before, and they've always included service. This latest increase just felt excessive without any discernible value-add.\n\nAs for the space itself: the design is lovely-looking, but there's hardly enough room between the bar and the tables. When I was seated recently, the host interrupted a group who'd been sitting on the edge of what became my table, but she didn't wipe it down. Those people continued to hover next to the table because there wasn't anywhere else for them to go. Not good for groups if you're just getting drinks without a reservation (we made one for precisely this reason). Additionally, because of their limited tables and permanent booths, smaller parties are often seated at the same table as other parties. \n\nThere's nothing terribly wrong with the food, service, or drinks, all of which are enjoyable.

After having a fairly quiet day to myself, it was nice to gather a handful of my friends together for something I had been waiting a long time for: Trou Normand's charcuterie and salumi board.  Being the classy people that we are, we ordered the Large board and the cheese plate almost right away as we sipped on various wines and bubbly. Everyone, including our token Frenchie who we consider an expert in wine, cheese and cured meats, was impressed with the delicious p\u00e2t\u00e9 options and absolutely amazing charcuterie.  A few favorites were the rabbit p\u00e2t\u00e9, the chicken p\u00e2t\u00e9, and the pancetta.  The cheese plate didn't get as many rave reviews, and most of us considered the cheese plate to be mediocre relative to the charcuterie and p\u00e2t\u00e9 spread.  Things were winding down on the meat and cheeses when our true selves were revealed: we were still hungry.  So, in perfect form, we went with two orders of the Aracini after we perused on Yelp what else we should get, and also two orders of the pork meatballs after being recommended by our server.  I'm so glad we did, being proper and wanting to just eat meat and cheese for dinner is, well, overrated.  Those fried balls of risotto hit the spot, and the meatball, while lacking in presentation, made up in taste. For dessert, we all shared the chocolate pot du creme, and because it was my special day, we were also given the Meyer Lemon tart.  Both were delicious, but neither were outstanding.\n\nI absolutely loved celebrating my birthday at Trou, and I would strongly recommend that you come here when you have a large group.  I concluded that if my husband and I were to come here by ourselves, we'd be leaving either hungry, unsatisfied, or both.  So, if you need a great place for a small and intimate group of friends, I definitely recommend Trou Normand!", "author": "Lisa I."}

I highly recommend checking out their impressive charcuterie board that's made in-house.\n\nPATTY MELT - Can't really go wrong with this! It was a little on the saltier side for my taste, but it was by no means, a bad patty melt. \n\nWill I be back to Trou Normand? Maybe.

There's no doubt about it. It's expensive.  I don't care about that, if it's good - then charge whatever you want. Mostly it wasn't good though and the portions are tiny so it's worth mentioning upfront that this place is $$$$$$. \n\n2. No one knew anything about the wine list. I asked about a $65 bottle of Chardonnay from the Jura. The server said he'd never tried it but heard it was good. I asked for more definitive information.  He came back and said that he'd asked two other staff and they said they also \"liked it\".  I find it hard to believe there were no other notes from the sommelier (or the wine rep!) that they could have shared. Or even made something up! This seemed slack and what I'd expect in a basic chain restaurant. \n\n2. We split a mixed charcuterie plate to start. It was delicious. Condiments weren't right for the dish though. It felt incomplete. The meats themselves seemed good. It was really pricey for tiny thin slices of cured meat. We had to ask bread which seemed stupid. \n\n3. Our main course - the pork chop special and a side of asparagus - came before we had finished our appetizer. I asked if the chef was in a rush and the server asked if I wanted him to take the food back to the kitchen. I said no, but it seemed a bit amateur that it was sent out in the first place. \n\n4. The asparagus was tiny. And $18 (I think?). The point is it was very small and very expensive. It was also too heavily seasoned meaning way too salty. \n\n5. The pork chop was under cooked. I don't care if the chef disagrees pork should be mostly opaque the whole way through and slightly pink in the middle. It was translucent and could only be described as rare. We only ate half of it. We let the server know and he took it off the bill which was not expected but a nice gesture. \n\nSo in a matter of about 45 minutes we had dessert menus on the table and we were ready to leave! The server offered us a complementary glass of calvados, the essence of trou normand. Too little too late! \n\nAvoid this place for now. They have a lot to figure out. It has so much potential though! I hope they improve!!", "author": "Luke S."}

Reservations are recommended (open table) but not required. My husband and I dined here for brunch the day before the SF Marathon and were surprised by how many open spots there were. Meter spots in the area still run on Saturdays (not on Sundays) so we parked near Yerba Buena Gardens and walked over. Inside seating offers bar or tables and they do have bar hooks for the ladies :) the brunch menu is ever changing so keep that in mind if you book your reservation more than a week out. We started with a goat cheese and pepper jelly on toast for an appetizer and it did not disappoint. My husband ordered the braised pork with lipstick peppers (not spicy) and a fried egg and was completely blown away by the depth of flavors. I ordered the scrambled eggs with beans and edamame and cheese and it was light and delicious and the eggs were the best scrambled eggs I have ever had. It's not an hyperbole but rather truth. The eggs were moist and airy and just delicious. I could have ordered more but the $20+ price tag definitely held me back. If you like meat order their charcuterie, it's what they are famous for, but... If you are a meatless eater like myself, order the eggs :) oh and make sure to Yelp this place afterwards.

That's what the dessert menu is for!\n\nTheir brunch and cocktail menus look amazing, so I'll definitely have to come back for both of those. Actually I vaguely remember having a strong cocktail (must have been the Jersey City one) but I'll have to drink it again to confirm. Being located in such a prime area, I'll make a reservation to Trou Normand next time, though we were able to seat six people without a problem late in the evening on a weekday.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

Once we got to the front of the restaurant to pick up the leftovers, they told us the food \"accidentally got taken by the party before us.\" When we inquired further about this, they told us that we \"already got complimentary dishes on our bill, so this isn't a big deal.\" \n\nI'm never one to complain about things like this--- I get it, stuff happens that's out of your control.

As we entered the restaurant, and took our seats at the bar, the bartender (mid 20's, caucasian, male, lip-piercing) greeted us at 10:30 pm by looking at his watch in such a way to suggest they were closing soon. Trying to be polite, I asked if they were wrapping up the night (not wanting to stay if they were) and he said \"I guess not.\" I haven't felt so unwelcome in a space in years. He then ignored us for several minutes until finally he asked what we would like. After ordering, he left the bar and returned a good five minutes later and in a very brash and rude way, asked for ID's. The negative vibes continued until we finished and left.\n\nAs two people who pride themselves on providing excellent hospitality, this was an absolutely terrible experience.

Service was on point and our server made sure we were well taken care of. On top of the items above, we had 2 bottles of wine and ordered a few cocktails, and we paid around $50 each.

I was surprised to find a reservation very easily at the last minute during OpenWorld and stopped by for dinner. The menu is VERY limited (there are about 5 appetizers, 5 mains and 5 sides), with a strong focus on charchuterie. \n\nIf you're hungry or vegetarian or trying to go no carb, I would not recommend Trou Normand. It's ideal more for 2-3 people to catch up over a drink and charchuterie. \n\nDRINKS:\nPreviously I had tried their cocktails, they look pretty but I prefer Novela for something nearby. Their wines by the glass are fairly limited and from what I recall mostly Italian. I enjoyed the Nebbiolo but it was a little steep ($15).\n\nFOOD: Tiny portions, expensive and limited in options but packed with flavor. \n\n* LOBSTER SAUSAGE ($22?) - 3.5 STARS:\nPork casing with egg whites, lobster and fish on the inside, served over buttered greens), I think this was like $22 and it was slightly bigger than an Aidelle's sausage. It was pretty good, interesting and very different than anything I've ever had. It sort of reminded me of a better quality Chinese fishcake. \n\n* SHISHITO PEPPERS ($7?) - 4 STARS:\nAmazing shishito peppers mixed with sauteed peppers, eggplant and a side of creamy yogurt sauce. This is one of my favorite shishito pepper dishes but it felt like there were literally 6 shishito peppers on the plate. \n\nSERVICE:\nWell it was atrocious and slow.

Yelp buddy Janice C. and I met up for lunch here the previous week.  I've had it bookmarked for quite sometime and glad that she suggested TN.  I love the decor of the restaurant..and yes the huge painting of the naked lady's backside..but I hate the whole big booth table seatings and seating in general here.  Janice and I shared the smaller table with another couple, and it wouldn't have been so bad if we had to sit facing them, but we had to sit next to them in the same side, same booth..it was just a little awkward.  The bar is the only seating where if you are a small party of two you could probably get away without any awkwardness.  \n\nAnywhoo started off with the arancinis ($6), and shared my tagliatelle ($14) and her sandwich ($10).  The arancinis were fried to a perfect golden brown.  The balls were perfectly sized (that's what she said..hehehe..) and had the right amount of yummy ground meat n them, not overly cheesy either, well balanced.  Next came our main courses.  I loved my super fresh tagliatelle!  The noodles were cooked perfectly, the pork red pepper ragu was so flavorful and they put the perfect amount of parmesan cheese on top.  The dish was a little bit salty and I tasted more tomato sauce than any red pepper but it was still a very good pasta dish.  Her sandwich was a salami and coppa.  Again, the meats were excellent as they were very fresh and not too fatty or overly salty.  The bread was nice and soft and filled with lettuce, however, it seems that they like to put mustard on a lot of their sammies (not my thing but it didn't ruin the sandwich for me).  The sandwiches look so lonely on the big plate they are served, so I think a small side would be nice or even for them to include a pickle for pickle lovers on the side (again, not my thing, but just saying).  \n\nI enjoyed my lunch here with great company.  I would love to come back after work sometime for a drink and to share a charcuterie plate..or perhaps an entree..meat, more meat, this girl loves her meat!

This is a hogs heaven, and no other restaurants in San Francisco could compare. I traveled in time: at a distant past, I had arrived in Amsterdam with my French travel companion, from there I met up with a tall German boy from Dusseldorf, we smoked at the coffee houses until wee hours, and then stuffed ourselves with Belgium waffles after posing in front of the Sex Museum. In the morning, we rode the train to Bavaria, and from there I headed down south on train to French country, picking up some fresh baguette, and duck liver pate. I then continued my journey to Italy, in Rome two different Italian men approached and asked me out for dinner on different nights. In Florence a boy lived in Telegraph Hill backpacking in Europe knocked on my hotel door. A foreign land induced romance ensued. We took strolls in Florence and extended our journey to Venice where an older Italian woman at the farmer's market slapped my hand for touching her grapes before paying. That was a very warm late summer. I was barely 25, carefree and reckless, and at age 26 I had a quarter life crisis that changed me forever. At the time, I had not realized what life was about and what food, especially good food, could do to one's soul. \n\nThe euphoria one achieves from having a satisfying meal at a beautifully decorated building, must be what Anton Ego felt after having ratatouille at Auguste Gusteau's restaurant cooked up by Remy, an anthropomorphic rat who was exceptionally talented at cooking.\n\nFood, perfect food, does that to one's body and soul. It transforms you, it takes you back in time, traveling through foreign land where food and people appeared in fragmented memories, unwarranted and unfiltered, they competed for your attention while you sipped coffee and drank water with gas while calmly chatted away with your new friend in the city. Such was a Monday afternoon where time had played a trick on me, all because of the fresh charcuterie served with crispy epi baguette.\n\nI had never been this impressed with charcuterie served in any restaurants on this side of the pond; it's not just that they served exceptionally good quality ones, but they are more diverse than Perbacco had to offer, which was centered around Italian style charcuterie, whereas here at Trou Normand, it had Italian, French and German. \n\nI wanted to try the cocktails, dine in the backyard courtyard, sample their dinner menu, and grab a cup of expresso while leaning against the counter. Yet I had no time to accomplish it all in such a short period of time. \n\nLardo. Headcheese. House Cured Ham. House Pickles. Those are the must tries. \n\nI invited a friend for an afterwork cocktail this week. I'm having a bit of nostalgic moment. I miss France and Germany. This is as close as it gets.", "author": "Victoria E."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-11", "description": "A wine & restaurant professional recommended Trou Normand, and her's was a spot-on suggestion. My highest recommendation is the charcuterie/cheese board - the meats are house cured and beautifully prepared. Let the chef make the choice (sort of like charcuterie omakase), and make sure to order a board slightly larger than what you are normally comfortable with - because it is just that good. \n\nAll of the proteins on the menu are fantastic, but the pork burger (at abut $20) is a stand-out. The burger can also be ordered with their different rotation of specialty meats, sometimes lamb, beef or pork. Go back and try them all. \n\nThe Lardo Toast with grilled greens, chili, anchovy, garlic and capers ($14) is so good I wanted to roll around in it. Don't skip. And the grilled pork chop ($30) is moist, briny, sweet and savory all at once. \n\nThe wine list is solid, with choices that the professional crowd and San Francisco friends alike will appreciate.  The cocktails are also worth a try - each takes a little time to prepare, but the quality is worth the wait in the end. \n\nIMHO the bar is the best seat in town, but there is also a back room great for groups and a really cleverly situated covered patio (with very effective heaters). Service is on point as well as friendly. No one hovers, but you're never ignored, either. The ambiance is bit cool, but mostly a light, easy and comfortable spot for a friendly group gathering as well as a date night. \n\nThis said, it IS small, so don't get grumpy if you show up with a group and have to wait. \n\nThis is a fun, upscale and very relaxed spot with a great-quality-for-the-money menu and a lovely bar full of excellent options for every taste.

Located on the first floor of the Old Pac Bell art deco building on New Montgomery, this place is great for a mid-afternoon espresso or tea (I suggest trying to loose leaf lychee--delicious) or an evening cocktail (their old fashion is one of the best I've ever had, it isn't sickeningly sweet nor jammed with a ton of muddled fruit, and the huge square ice cube is always fun to see spinning in the glass as the bartender mixes) or for a lunch/dinner of meats, cheeses, or gastropub fare. You can build your own charcuterie and cheese board, or order the chef's selection that day. Starters are great to share tapas-style, the summer squash with parmesan and butter lettuce salad are refreshing, the arancini are so-so, nothing too impressive flavor-wise. The chocolate pot de creme with chunks of toffee and topped with whipped cream is incredibly decadent and denser than I'm used to, so it's definitely an after meal good-to-share-have-a-few-bites item. Some menu items change daily, so it's good to go in with an open mind. A smidge on the pricey side, but it's SoMa, and the chemistry of flavors in their dishes really works well. Who knew squash, cucumbers, and parmesan could taste so good when tossed in a pesto basil dressing? Seating is a little communal, so if you're with smaller parties of 2-4, you will probably have to share table space both inside and in the back patio. I adore how you can pass by the butchering table on your way to the back, and see the chefs doing their prep work in the open.

The cherry is what made the drink, and it was deliciously deceptively boozy which is why I recommended it to my buddy who had to study for a final exam that same night. :)\n\nI also tried the Bombay (armagnac, vermouth, curacao, absinthe), which was good but not as memorable.  The El Morocco (armagnac, port, lime, pineapple, bitters) was also good but you have to like the sweetness of the port (it's not for me personally.)\n\nOverall I consider Trou Normand's cocktails to be well-balanced and well-crafted; every single person in my large party received a very well-made drink.  But because most of the ingredients are standard, there's only so much complexity to each drink.  The cocktails are $12, plus they charge tax at the bar even if you're standing and didn't order any food, which is one of my pet peeves.  So if I'm just looking for a drink, for $13 before tip I'd much rather go to a specialty cocktail bar that has house-made infusions and bitters.

I got tickets for me and my husband at Eventbrite and, boy, were we glad that I did that!\n\nWe just fell in love with Trou Normand.  This special event was held at their outdoor patio.  It's such a cool place.  Six large communal tables made out of polished stone sat under a plexiglass(?) canopy, so you have this nice open feeling, but you're protected from the elements by the roof. The sides are open and flanked by tall plants on large pots, and there are space heaters above your head to keep you warm on those chilly San Francisco nights.  I can just imagine how fun it'd be to have breakfast and lunch out here on nice, sunny days. \n\nThe weather couldn't have been more perfect though that evening, as it was still in the high 70s when the event started at 8 pm.  The bartender mixed up a Brown Derby for each of us and poured it in a beautiful mini Coupe glass.  Yum! Love the bourbon, grapefruit and honey combination.  It's a strong drink, so I had to order some food to balance out the alcohol/food ratio in my stomach. We had not eaten dinner yet, so we ordered the Pappardelle with Braised Chicken Ragu. Pasta was perfectly cooked and the Chicken Ragu was delicious!  We were also impressed by the charcuterie platters, salumi slices and arancini plates they brought out.  I just had to have another drink to keep the ideal alcohol/food ratio in my tummy. I ordered the Delores Garden Swizzle. This concoction of Demerara Rum, Lime, Creme de Cacao and Four Barrel Cold Brew was poured in a Collins glass and stuffed with crushed ice.

While the wine and cocktails are a bit pricier than most places around the city (about $15 versus the typical $12-13), they are still enjoyable.  Maybe not worth the price, but not NOT worth the price, either.  Their charcuterie/salumi/cheese selections are fantastic.  Not only do they have amazing, all house-made meats, but the combination boards come with unique and delicious accompaniments - pork aspic, fennel salad, and a delicious jam.  The have a house-made 'nduja on the salumi menu right now that's out of this world.  There aren't many places in the U.S. that make 'nduja - really, just one in Oakland and another in Chicago - and I would say theirs is better than both of those.\n\nLast night, I came back to Trou Normand for dinner and loved the food, the cocktails, and the overall experience.  For our meal, we had a combination board (get the pork pate and the 'nduja!), the summer squash appetizer with pesto and basil, the tagliatelle with pork bolognese, and the grilled corn side with hen of the woods mushrooms and padrons.  Everything was incredibly fresh and flavorful.  I also appreciated the simple, rustic presentation of all the dishes.  We basically licked our plates clean.  For dessert, we had the butter cake with roasted strawberries.  I was a little nervous when we placed the order - I expected it to basically be an angel food cake with strawberries - but I was amazed at how delicious it was.  The cake was very dense but still moist and luxuriously buttery.  A Paula Deen dream-come-true, basically.  The strawberries offered the perfect level of acidity to balance out the richness of the cake.\n\nWe ended up eating at the bar and having a great conversation with the \"bartender\" (really doesn't seem like a fair description for his role) about all the small batch liquors they offer, sour beers, terroir, and other interesting alcohol-related topics.

Their claim to fame are their charcuterie plates - cured salumi and p\u00e2t\u00e9 made in-house while providing an excellent selection of artisan cheeses. However, everything else from their starters to their mains are very hit or miss. Unfortunately, it was more of a miss. \n\nLARGE CHARCUTERIE & SALUMI BOARD ~ $78 ~ 4 stars: Littered with several types of salumi, pork p\u00e2t\u00e9, duck p\u00e2t\u00e9 and several other heavenly cured meat items, this was an excellent item to share amongst eight people. My favorite was the pork p\u00e2t\u00e9 - rich, deep flavors and dry. Everything else was ok to great. I personally prefer going to Whole Foods and building my own board at home but this didn't disappoint. Was it worth $78? Probably not but it wasn't too bad. \n\nCHEESE BOARD ~ $22 ~ 3.5 stars: The selection of cheese was good but it didn't blow me away. My favorite was the La Marotte raw sheep's milk cheese but even that wasn't worth writing home about. \n\nARANCINI ~ $9 ~ 4 stars: Delicious fried balls of rice and cheese. If you've never had arancini, try to imagine a glorified fried mac 'n cheese ball. However, Trou Normand makes it light, perfectly seasoned and very crispy. \n\nPICKELS ~ $6 ~ 3 stars: Just an assortment of pickled carrots, cauliflower and something else (can't remember). Nothing special but it was necessary to cut through the meat, cheese and arancini. \n\nLACINATO KALE ~ $12 ~ 4 stars: Kale cooked like creamed spinach. Awesome side although a little on the rich side. \n\nBRAISED ARTICHOKE ~ $16 ~ 4.5 stars: Excellent. Very tender, creamy and flavorful. Out of all the sides we got, this was the best. \n\nCARDOON & POTATO SALAD ~ $13 ~ 1 star: Atrocious. Do not got this. \n\nGRILLED BEEF CHOP ~ $66 ~ 3.5 stars: HUGE! It was seared perfectly and cooked very well. However, it wasn't close to the $66 price tag. \n\nLARGE GRILLED PORK CHOP ~ $48 ~ 5 stars: ALSO HUGE! Hands down the best pork chop I've ever had. I can't begin to tell you how amazing Trou Normand cooks their pork chops. Seared to perfectly and completely moist & juicy in the middle. The strips of fat were beyond tender and added excellent flavor. Do not waste your time deciding on what to order as your main. Go with their pork chop. In my opinion, it sits in a league of its own. \n\nSAUSAGE PLATE ~ $28 ~ 3 stars: Don't remember what kind of sausages but it wasn't great. You get two standard size sausages, each coming in at $14. Not worth it. \n\nTAGLIATELLE ~ $26 ~ 2.5 stars: Ehhhhh. Good past but not great. Pass. \n\nOLIVE OIL POACHED BLACK COD ~ $36 ~ 2 stars: I can't believe how small this portion was. The piece of cod we got provided four people one bite. It wasn't any bigger than a standard size burger patty. To be honest, the spinach served with the cod was the star. \n\nWe were fortunate to sample almost the whole menu. One of the benefits of dining with a large group. After trying a little bit of everything, I have to say I would never go back to Trou Normand for two reasons. 1) The overall menu didn't wow me and 2) Other than the pork chop, I don't believe anything is worth its ticket price. Go to Trou Normand with low expectations and you might, and I stress might, be pleasantly surprised. However, I highly encourage you to go elsewhere.", "author": "Bruce C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-08-25", "description": "I'd be happy to give Trou Normand a rave if it weren't for two very troubling aspects.  The food was very good.  The Pork Ragu Taglitelle I woofed it down in no time.  Yum.  Arancini, delicious.  Cheesecake with plums and Chocolate Toffee Pot De Creme - yeah!  Love them.  Butter cake with strawberries - a bit dry.  \n\nOverall, the decor is tastefully modern, not stark.  The back patio with the greenhouse was lovely.  The tall, tall ceilings in the main dining room were a beautiful nod to the building's history.  Very well done.  I loved the view into the kitchen so I could see the young, fun chefs.  No stuffy chefs in there.  I thought the hostess was very sweet and the sommelier was a hoot with her very spiky bleach-blonde hair.  Give me a break...I was in Paris in June.  None of the waitstaff over there looked anything like these guys.  I enjoyed the modern staff at Trou Normand.\n\nProblem points:\n1) Until we actually handed money and a credit card to the our server and the credit card tag was returned, did we realize that there's a built-in 20% service charge.  It was actually also at the bottom of the bill as a tiny black bar with reversed, white writing.  A little tough to see or pay attention to when they've already served you a few drinks.  So, I went back to the server and asked her to bring our entire payment back because she was about to get an enormous tip on top of her built-in 20%.  She didn't even know the amount of the markup until she went and asked her manager.  More on her later. \n\nNOWHERE else on the entire menu was the 20% mentioned.  Not on any of the menus, not mentioned by the server, nothing.  So, the whole thing ended up looking shady.  My friend had selected the restaurant for her birthday and she hadn't even seen anything until I flagged it.  Trou Normand's prices are certainly inclusive of the 20% markup but many items seemed inflated already.  $24 for 3 item cheese plate.  The cheeses were puny with some bread and a few wine grapes.  All the entrees come with nothing on the plate but the entree.  Sides are extra.  $26 for the taglitelle, $24 for lamb duo.  Again, good food.  It's hard to parse out if that service markup makes their prices in line with comparable restaurants or not.\n\n2) And, the service really stunk.  Three times I had to get up from the table to let our server we were ready to order.  I eat out enough to know what good service and pacing look like.  This wasn't anything near it.  I wish I could remember her name but I can't.  I can't figure out if she was new or what.  But, the normal amount of checking in and inquiring about our dishes didn't happen.  Frankly, I think the disincentive is the built-in tip.  I don't need service like Gary Danko or a two-star Michelin Paris restaurant.  I just needed to not have to get up to flag a server down for ordering a main course, a dessert or the bill.  I appreciate letting a table have a leisurely dinner but I've seen it done well many times.  This was not it.  The only explanation I have is that the servers just aren't motivated.  \n\nWill I be back? Maybe.  Not sure if the food and service are commensurate with the price.", "author": "Anne K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-10", "description": "This was pretty disappointing. Part of the disappointment was simply the feeling of experiencing hype and not meeting my expectations. The rest is detailed below.\n\nFirst, the good - I enjoyed a good and reasonably-priced cocktail, as well as a good and market-priced lamb steak. I say market-price because it was OK but not great. I will detail this further below.\n\nNext: the bad. I was severely disappointed by the wine recommendations here. The atmosphere here is also seriously lacking. Dining is an intimate experience, and while the staff were nice enough, the patrons that Trou Normande attracts were not very cool.\n\nWhen I arrived at Trou, I sat at the bar and was greeted by a nice bar tender. I asked him to recommend a drink that had light aromatic qualities and the drink I served footed the bill. I hung out for a while, and then ordered dinner. It was around this time that things started to break down.\n\nFirst, I was dining alone at the bar; I had the impression that the company at this restaurant tends to be pretty lame. While I was dining, two parties of vapid, not-nice people sat down next to me. While not necessarily the fault of the establishment, it certainly is worth mentioning if jerks sit next to you in unusually high proportion. I recall one group babbling mindlessly about how to abuse local tech employers and how much the group despised their own employers. Hearing people squawk about this is just stupid and annoying.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, this restaurant also has a major problem with red wine. I asked for a pairing with my meal (red, full bodied; similar to most cabernet sauvignons raised in Sonoma) and was initially given a taste of a very thin, lame foreign red. I asked for something different and was presented with several inadequate options. I would have described the best of them as \"thin and spicy, appropriate for barbecue pork and grilled fish.\" Certainly not for the lamb I was eating. \n\nThey just didn't really have good wine pairings on hand for their food, despite the fact that there's some awesome wines raised on their doorstep.\n\nLastly, I was never offered water and their food was pretty salty. Seasoning heavily is forgivable (who doesn't like salt), but it is a crime to only offer booze when your food is pretty salty.\n\nI probably wouldn't bother to come here again. Despite the service quality, (which was good) the food and drink is kind of meh. Especially given the price. And the atmosphere came off stuffy and unsophisticated.", "author": "Ed K."}

It took a while to get the drink, which was puzzling, since the bar wasn't busy. My companion arrived and we were seated at a table in the front (the patio is much quieter, by the way).\n\nWe ordered lardo with radishes (which came with some rosemary-infused lard). The cava was tasty and pricey. The next course was taking a long time, and we must have been eyeing every plate that passed with obvious longing. The server came to say that he had checked on our dishes, and they were being plated \"right now.\" Since another ten minutes elapsed, I assume he was humoring me. Well, they should have taken another five minutes for the sausage plate - as late as it was, it had what otherwise would have been a lovely, dill-laden, rabbit boudin blanc, disagreeably raw in the interior. That was a major turn-off, hard to recover from, and following on the heels of the waiter's aspirational proffer made me regret that I would not be able to show displeasure by reducing the tip. My companion's braised veal and agnolotti were good, but the agnolotti were on the crunchy side of al dente.\n\nWe asked for water (\"still or sparkling?\"), twice, and when none was forthcoming we flagged down the hostess - who brought water, along with a lecture about how one must specifically request it. Now, I am sure hostesses aren't hired for talent or brains, but a modest amount of hospitality is always good for someone in that position. I explained that we *had* asked for water, *twice*, so if she detected impatience and entitlement in my tone, she was correct.\n\nOkay, Trou Normand, I gave you a try. I am not inclined to return. I am enormously sympathetic with the trend toward service compris, or a fixed service charge, but it's clear that there are occasional downsides to it. Apparently a cultural shift is required - not just on the part of patrons, but staff as well.", "author": "Michael S."}

We didn't read up about the restaurant further than being a sister restaurant to Park Tavern (or something similar) as to not ruin the surprise. So, we booked a table for two for Valentine's Day (+ celebrate our first month of marriage) and it was... Somewhat of a disappointment. Here's why:\n\n1. Trou Normand has communal seating. Even the intimate booths inside by the bar housed 2-3 couples. \n\n2. It was a set menu. No 2nd option or option to sub something.\nThe food that we liked was really good, like the entr\u00e9e (lamb three ways - roasted was far best) and dessert. (Chocolate pot du creme is fairly hard to fuck up though, but the toffee crunch was a nice touch.)\nBut... We're not really fans of 3 courses as it's always too much. And to tie in to the communal seating - when the main comes with three sides, you're literally sitting on top of each other. (One dude even dropped his plate in his lap because there weren't room. Trou story - pun intended.)\n\n3. We didn't know how much the menu we didn't want cost until the meal was over. It was $110/person. (+ \"Service included\".)\nWe got a LOT of food, but we didn't finish ANYTHING and we definitely didn't like everything. Not a bad price at all for the sheer amount of food we received, but I would've rather not wasted 40% of it.

(Shame on us for not reading about it beforehand.) \n\nWorth to mention is that we booked through OpenTable who didn't mention there was going to be a set menu on the particular day.

All Trou Normand I had in my life were served with apple sorbet in a brandy glass.\n\nYesterday Trou Normand was served without sorbet in champagne/dessert glass.

The coppa was good - could definitely taste the red wine and had a kick from the black pepper. The pate was interesting. I can't say I unequivocally liked it, because it was not as soft as I expected, and the flavor was jelly-like and tasted a bit like leftover meat bits.\n\nFor the main we had a roast chicken to share.

Every time the door was opened, a really cold breeze made us shudder. I suggest the restaurant think about using an archway or some kind of shield to mitigate the wind tunnel.

Instead, let us enumerate things which one has no choice but to love.\n\na) The cocktail list. Friends, there are ten bazillion craft cocktail bars and/or restaurants with high-end craft cocktail/spirit programs within spitting distance of my house, and while many are good, there are a lot of places recycling the same tired list that's been making the rounds since 2008 (maybe infused with something new & trendy). Not here. The list is fresh & original, with many offerings that highlight the brandy theme of the restaurant.\n\nb) While we're at it, the brandy library. Seriously. If you like good spirits but don't know much about/haven't had a lot of good brandy, ask your server for recommendations & try a few things. They are very knowledgable & apparently have procured a lot of one-of-a-kind selections that you might not be able to get anywhere else.\n\nc) The wine list. = curated. Not huge, but some very unique & fun offerings at reasonable prices. (We went with my bf's wine educator parents, & they were impressed. Like they say, it's not about how big it is; it's what you do with it.)\n\nd) Charcuterie. Such unique! So choices! Wow. Seriously, just get a giant board & let the chef pick out a bunch of stuff. Eat the pig jelly.\n\ne) All-inclusive gratuity. This is just so much easier for everyone, all the way around. The only trick is to keep in mind as you peruse the menu & prices that the tip is already accounted for, so if things seem 15-20% more expensive than you might expect, that's why.\n\nf) Great service (lest you fear that e) has resulted in apathetic waitstaff). No, it turns out that establishing what people are making for a night's work ahead of time actually does *not* cause them to do crappy work. On our second trip, we had particularly excellent service.\n\nHonestly, unless you don't eat pork/beef, you should really just go. It is awesome.", "author": "Angela B."}

It's the most over-priced restaurant I've been to in my nearly three years living in SF. The vibe is strange, service is aloof. It took our party of eight 30 minutes to get our first round of drinks. (And the very large restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived at 6:30 pm on a Saturday night, so being busy or understaffed was not an excuse.) While the waiter was not rude per se, the quality of service did not at all match the price. Further, it was difficult to track him down for ordering additional drinks or getting help making sense of the minimal menu that placed far more emphasis on design than content.\n\nIt's more of a small plates restaurant with charcuterie boards, cheese plates that leave something to be desired, and overpriced cocktails (mind you, they advertise as a \"cocktails\" bar, but were missing some basic accoutrements, like olives and cranberry juice). Here's the problem: the small plates are priced like entrees, and the waitstaff did not provide any help with ordering. Even if they DID, though, this place is so not worth it. A plate of \"meatballs\" gets you two meatballs sitting in red sauce for the low price of $24. Yes, $12 per meatball. AND NOTHING ELSE. A side of cauliflower for $16 gets you approximately 4 tiny florets with some chanterelle mushrooms. It could barely be considered a side for one person - and for $16, we were expecting it to feed 3-4.\n\nThe entire group of us left so underwhelmed, still hungry, and paying more than 2x what we would've expected. I'll happily spend $100 per person on a wonderful meal, but this was so far from that. None of us will be back.", "author": "Erin H."}

The front room/inside room of the restaurant was completely empty except for one other couple at a booth that could seat four people. The host tried to seat us at this booth with these strangers - what were you thinking?! I politely asked to be seated at a separate table, given that there were 5 other tables open PLUS bar seating. She made a big deal about there potentially being other reservations, etc, and another waitress came by and questioned why we didn't want the original table. Rude, much? I want to enjoy my food without bumping elbows with a romantic couple, thanks. Also, I made a reservation and I think I deserve a table as much as the other reservations. Also, at least you could have offered us bar seating??\n\nIn terms of prices, let's look at our menu selection:\n\n- Small Charcuterie Plate ($21): To be absolutely fair, the charcuterie here is quite savory and comes with a good variety of cured meats and pate. I wasn't exactly sure which meats were in the small combination, but both of the pates were excellent. Charcuterie is an expensive affair, and the variety makes up for the price here, but let's talk about the prices on the next item...\n\n- Sausage Plate ($22): This is very literally 2 sausages on a thin, sparse bed of squash shavings. Think about it - that's $11 for a sausage! Not even a large or particularly good sausage! The waitress warned us that the plate doesn't come with any sides, but it IS listed as a main, so I would expect the plate to be able to stand on its own.\n\nTrou Normand made a bad first impression, and it just kept getting worse throughout the meal.

With that said, everything doesn't quite fit together.\n\nThe back room is beautiful, but large common tables at this price point doesn't sit well with me.  If dinner is going to be North of $100/pp I don't want to be seated with strangers.  The service doesn't match the price either, too over the top and forced; a well practiced welcome and introduction speech from our server at a mile a minute is just annoying. I appreciate the effort, but a little restraint  would go a long way, but maybe it was just our server.\n\nFor the price I expect more elements or sides to be included with an entree order.  We ended up sticking with charcuterie, small plates and sides because the entrees seemed like an afterthought.  If your'e going to charge $20-$40/per plate for an entree  it should be a composed dish with more to it.\n\nI'll be back for a Tru Normand ($6!!!) and charcuterie, but the service, seating, and composition needs to improve before I'd make this a place to eat a full meal on a regular basis.\n\nLot's of things make this a worthwhile place to check out, but for me, it's just a bit presumptuous and rough around the edges at this price point.  Also, for a place with a French name that specializes in charcuterie allot of the menu reads Italian.", "author": "Alex H."}

So I emailed the restaurant asking for a refund of my tip. They kindly emailed back, saying that tipping was reinstated on 12 October 2015, and that therefore no refund was due. Fine. Also meaning that the tagliatelle with tax and tip was ~ $33 on 16 October.  \n\nSo then I wondered if they'd lowered the price after they brought back tipping. Looking at the entry for 12 September 2015 on the Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org/web/20150317125632/http://www.trounormandsf.com/menu/) I see that the tagliatelle was $20 -- and included tipping! Instead of lowering prices to reflect the re-introduction of tipping, they raised prices.\n\nAnd checking the menu for today, the tagliatelle is now $28, or about $36 with tax and tip (ok, it's with braised lamb shank today).

We were seated on the patio, which was heated (great since today was chilly), and were immediately greeted and given some complimentary sparkling water.\n\nOur waitress came over immediately to ask for drinks, and the three of us ordered cocktails (we all settled on the Sleepyhead -  armagnac, ginger, mint, cava). \n\nA few minutes later, we ordered our main dishes - which were sandwiches split among the table, and then a side of salt and vinegar housemade chips. The charcuterie plates looked amazing, and if I return, I'd for sure add that to my meal if I had more time.\n\nI was super disappointed when our sandwiches (which were warm) came out before our drinks, since I love being able to sip on a cocktail and enjoy some conversation with friends while I wait for my meal to arrive. The waitress apologized and was polite about it, but in my opinion that's kinda similar to serving an appetizer after a main dish arrives, something just isn't right!\n\nThe sandwiches (I split one roast pork and one pork patty melt with a friend) were delicious and well portioned for a lunch menu, and pork in its many preparations seemed like the star of the menu as a whole. No complaints there!\n\nAfter we finished eating, we ordered glasses (alright, a glass and a half each) of wine, since we didn't get that experience of having drinks before the meal arrived.

So what turned this place south?  Service.  Let's start with our dippy waitress/hostess.  First thing she explains citrus to us.  I'm sorry do I look like I or anyone in my party of sophisticated foodies needed an explanation on how citrus works?  Seriously my dogs know this.  We order appetizers which come out before our carefully selected cocktails.  We had to ask where they were.  Then some doofus clears my drink but fails to ask if I'd like another.  Hello do you not want to make money?  We order wine and drinks and get no drinks.  Main course comes and still no drinks.  We had to beg for them.  The food was excellent, inspired even but decimated by the incredible indifference we were subjected to.  The icing on the cake is service was included.  I hate that with a passion.  I'm not a cheap tipper but being forced to subsidize a no nothing slacker just because burns me to the core.  How else can you express displeasure for bad service other than letting someone know that in the worlds of service I've had better at Taco Bell.  So in short never going back ever!!

One single door next to the Yelp HQ lead to this very fine restaurant. As we were lead to the patio, we passed by where the meat was being prepared and it looked great! As we pondered what we were going to order, my director ordered us some sparkling water. Took me a bit to finally decide what I wanted to try: Lamb Sausage under the sandwich part of the menu. When it came out, I was surprised to see it on a hotdog like bun. First bite: delicious! The sausage was a good portion but eating it was a challenge. The broccoli fell off but it was nice to have a fork to help the cause. The mustard was also a great compliment to the bread and overall taste (coming from a guy who dislikes mustard but this was GOOD). We had a shared plate of potatoes (which I thought was per plate but ended up only one plate *myself and our vendor ordered the same plate*).

The calvados is supposed to keep your appetite or digestion in a favorable disposition.  For me, this tradition is really more an excuse to extend a wonderful meal or evening.  So while I'm not sure if my digestion was improved, I can say visiting Trou Normand after dinner made me feel joyful and happy to be out late at night. 11 pm on a Thursday, the vibe is relaxed, not pretentious.  \n\nThe space is tall ceilinged (spacious), simple, warm, and minimally elegant.  The touches are all there: the carefully laid wood floor, a feminine but not sexual form that maybe picasso could have scrawled there after a free drink, the stools (please put purse hooks!) and booths with city street lights pouring down upon them.  For me, I wouldn't say this place reminds me specifically of New York, but it is elegantly art deco. Good spaces draw good social interactions. So be ready to have a nice time here.\n\nThe bar staff were all straight-out knowledgeable--they knew precisely where everything was sourced (which is important for a bar like this)--not intimidating or annoyed, but slightly formal and warmly friendly.  There was great care in all the bar items--the barware--you will love touching and sipping from it--even the thick cylindrical water glasses (filled with surprisingly cold water).  You can even appreciate the ice, which comes in beautiful blocks that are hacked away into precise chunks that chill your beautiful cocktails.  We had tastes of Calavdos (am I wrong to think $5 is a good deal for this?), a whisk cocktail containing Calvados (wonderfully smooth), and samples of cognac and armagnac (you can finally figure out which one you like more).  If you are open, why not resist the temptation to order the same old glass of wine?  Try some of the rare and carefully obtained brandies they have worked so hard to bring to you, practically halfway across the world.  Have a sip of the old world, in an art deco bar, in one of the most technologically advanced cities in the world.\n\nAfter a drink, If you sneak past the bathrooms, things are still under construction.  There is a beautiful city courtyard--a space surrounded by tall, brick walls to form a protected area.  It's still under development, but you can see the continued care and investment Trou is making here.  They seem to be planting citrus trees, herbs, olive trees, maybe a ginko tree?--all practical, producing elements that I imagine will be used in their drinks and food one day soon.  You will think:  I never imagined being in the middle of the city, there'd be a space like this...\n\nFor now, on its opening, I'd say it's a spectacular start.

First and foremost, I want to give them credit for working with us on the reservation. I initially made it for 6:30 for 5 people on Open Table. When I remembered we had seven, I had to change us to 8:30 to get the larger table. That change didn't stick for some reason, and when they called to confirm and I told them it was seven and not five, they worked us in at the original time of 6:30. That's much to their credit and we appreciated it. On the downside, that may be what put us at a table large enough for 10 or 12. In a noisy place like Trou Normand, that meant that we were often shouting across the table at each other. Another downside was that this made it difficult to do the family-style sharing that they promote. While we still had a great time. this bothered my wife a lot and she swore she'd never go back because of it. \n\nThe food was excellent. We started with the large charcuterie platter, which was phenomenal. Do not miss this stuff if you go there, whatever else you order. \"Chicories\" and carrot salads were very good. Other stuff we ate included the pappardelle (excellent, and very rich), turnips, the porck chop (also amazing), and the rutabaga gratin. The gratin was the one food item that was not perfect, as they sent it out a bit on the cold side. That's a misstep that shouldn't happen at a place like this. We ordered one of each of the three desserts and all were good (but I'd put the ice cream sandwich at the top of that group). Between the seven of us, we ordered several cocktails and glasses of wine. We ordered our wine by the glass, and the list is short but well put together, with some really nice selections (the rose was great). House cocktails were balanced and well made.  Our server was friendly, loose, attentive, and knowledgeable. The room is stylish, but WAY too noisy. \n\nSo to sum it up, great food (except for the cold rutabagas), very good wine and cocktails, bad table, excellent service, too noisy.

We were even treated to a tour of the kitchen and facilities after our meal, which was really eye-opening. They butcher all of their meat and do all of their curing on site. The server mentioned this beforehand, but it didn't really sink in until we saw their walk-in, curing, and aging operations. Every single piece of prociutto, salumi, mortadella, etc was not only butchered, but seasoned, cured, and aged on site. They use top quality, Northern California pasture-raised animals, and it is clear how much intention and skill is used to highlight the ingredients. To me, that justifies the cost. Sure you can get cheaper cured meats elsewhere, but they are not going to come close to having this much care and consideration put into them. They aren't just cutting up prociutto here, they are making it from scratch.\n\nThe cocktails were good, but were pretty standard for the SF cocktail scene. The arancinis, avacado salad, and fava beans were all pretty out of this world. The lamb duo was delicious, and the pork meatballs were insanely good (though borderline salty for me).

Two Calder \"The Circus\" style pictures greet the visitor upon entry.  The greeting hall includes an espresso machine, presumably for those who need a quick fix as well as the hostess stand.\n\nThere was a sprinkling of art throughout, all with the theme of nude women.  Above the bar, in the same style is a mural by New Bohemia Signs of an Ebecho Muslimova. I overhead the diners seated next to me at the bar commenting that they found it \"unusual\".  One painting appeared Picassoesque, another, adjacent to the bar, as an \"Endless Summer\" style reclining woman painting.  All were either pointing to the heavens, or to the admirer, although not to those seated next to me.\n\nTo begin my dining experience at Trou Normand, which refers to a customary spot of brandy by the French, I ordered the chicken pate, which was more country style and a touch on the dry side, than traditional.  While I enjoy both preparations, I wish it had been noted as such on the menu, as I would have opted for an alternate starter.  The country pate came with a side of epi bread.  For a moment, by heart stopped, thinking it was from Bouchon, but it did not have the same delicious consistency as the Keller epi.  Grain mustard and a consume style gelatin accompanied my starter.\n\nMy main course, which was not timed well, as it arrived after only a few bites of my starter, appeared.  The Mortadella Sandwich was simple, but the cuts of meat were delicious.  I enjoyed each bite of my sandwich while admiring the vintage Infinity SM 115 speakers that filled the space with soft music. The charcuterie plates are the standout at Trou Normand, which is brought to us by the same owner as Bar Agricole, Thad Vogler.\n\nWhile I enjoyed both items ordered, New Montgomery Street is fairly congested with sandwich shops of all varieties, from the line inducing Sentinel to the more simple The Melt.  Outside of the decor of Trou Normand, I didn't find the any of the items significantly worthy of a return lunch visit, although I would like to see the space at night and will return for dinner.", "author": "Rafael R."}

No way! \n\nI had a 5:30 reservation, got there a bit after 5, pouring down rain, obviously not going to stand outside! They were open and said of course I could get drink and snack.\n\nSomething I did not know was that they have communal seating. Problem for a number of reasons. I like dining solo, I know a lot of people don't, but I do. A lone person at the end of a table with a group is definitely odd. Also, I'm a TERRIBLE mixer. Some folks, put them with strangers, in 5 minutes they are BFF. Put me with strangers, I want to hide in a corner. Also, when I dine solo I bring a book, hard at a communal table. And finally I have severe fragrance sensitivity; when I make Open Table reservation I always ask for a table off in a corner. One person at the table wearing scent and I have to leave.\n\nThey have outdoor seating, with a roof. Not real popular considering the weather so I sat there, at the end of a long table I had to myself. Even with space heaters it was cold and chairs uncomfortable. I wish they'd mix it up, have some small table and some communal for diners to choose from. \n\nOK - food! I got the Sleepyhead because others at Yelp recommended it. Bit too strong for me; I'm not much of a drinker. Should probably stick with kir royale or other milder drink; I could not finish it. Got the duck pate to eat with it. Duck pate was fabulous, practically a meal. Came with very spicy mustard, bread, and pork aspic. I'd seen and heard of aspic but never tried it. Nothing ventured, right? Turns out it was rather bland. \n\nFor dinner got citrus salad, lamb, side of roasted asparagus and Swiss chard. Everything was good. Salad had a variety of citrus, very refreshing, paired with avocado, drizzled with yogurt. Perhaps a tad too much cilantro. Lamb was really good, especially the grilled porterhouse. I ended up gnawing the remains off the bone (sorry, Miss Manners!). Vegetables, generous enough for two, both favorite vegetables. Lamb could have used something to soak up meat juices, polenta, potatoes, pilaf, etc. \n\nDessert - I would probably have gotten the ice cream sandwich except that I was already cold, so got the \"country pear square\". This was warm, in fact hot, and ironically I was thinking it could have used a scoop of ice cream on top.\n\nSo: Drink B, duck A, salad A-, meat A, vegetables B+, dessert B\nNot bad but definitely high price (OK, I did get a lot) but $100 before tip!!!\n\nI had thought of making a lunch of salad and charcuterie some day, when weather is better, but then outdoors will also be crowded and frankly I am just not hot for communal seating.", "author": "Carol S."}

Although we were happy to get seated early (we arrived 1.5hrs earlier than our reservation time since we had hoped to hang at the bar but it was full), we were not too thrilled to be sitting in a table scrunched in between a party of 2 and another of 4 in the outdoor glassed area.  We have no issues with communal tables but this was too tight of a squeeze. First of all, parties like to try things and they tend to order multiple dishes at once. Well there is hardly any table space for that. Secondly, it's sooooo loud outside. Between the # of people, the music and the bar action out there, my husband and I found ourselves yelling most of the time in conversation. Perhaps the same table should only fit 6. Less people, more table space. \n\nService was a bit slow. They unapologetically forgot our lardo toast starter then gave it to us after our mains arrived. I bet the server didn't hear us order it cuz of the noise.  Sadly, we did not like the toast when it arrived.  Greens sandwiched between thin layers of fat on toast is just not our thing.

The signature cocktail here is similar to what Bar Agricole has to offer, but a tad more sophisticated. \n\nSpace/layout ***: Layout is a questionable here, you walk into a small space where the receptionist is, then that lead you into the L shaped bar/booth area. The high ceiling and the lack of soft material made this a terrible place for conversation. Then you will stop at a couple of high communal tables, then through another room of booth seating before landing yourself in the open patio/rear bar area.

I'd say come for the pork, stay cause you've had a few too many.\n\nWhist Cocktail--too dry and too boozy\nSleepyhead--winner, bit lemony (despite lemon not being listed in the ingredients) and very drinkable\nHawaiian--my drink was a delight: strong, sippable, not too sweet, sour or boozy, with a nice little bitterness.\n\nThe Medium Charcuterie plate quietly disappeared into our four mouths with melty delight. There was nothing we didn't like, even the rosemary scented aspic, but the Dry Pancetta was the favorite.\n\nWhile the lardo was deep & earthy on it's own, the Lardo Toast made better use of it's fatty qualities. Dripping warmed lardo under sweet tomato salad, made me forget that I was in public as I made war on the sinewey meat.  Too much pure fat to eat on your own...but almost impossible to share because you can't really cut or bite through the stuff.  To be shared with good friends with clean hands.\n\nThe Tagliatelle with braised duck was too salty.  The duck was moist and made a perfect ragu, the pasta was chewey, but the overload of salt made it less than perfect.  Similarly, the creamed corn was sweet, fresh and tender, and so salty that I wanted to pick out the pancetta.\n\nAnd the pork chop. I'm a little conflicted about the pork chop.  I'm not sure that I've ever had pork that was more moistly pink, more caramelized on the outside, with more sop-worthy sauce.  But for $22, I'd like a pork chop that is at least 50/50 Meat to Fat.  Not kidding, there was about 2 inches of pure snowy white, lip moistening, gut loosening fat around the pork chop.  I think they could up the ratio a bit without losing quality. We already had the lardo--for the entree, we thought we had ordered the meat.\n\nWe were seated outside, where it was much too windy for the heat lamps to keep us warm (they're putting in a retractable wall in 6 weeks). They were accommodating enough about moving us inside.  Another blip in the service was that our waitress got progressively more spazzy throughout the night.  She started out friendly, maybe a little eager, a little quirky. Progressed to saying how caffeinated she was...and finally, simultaneously apologizing and calling attention to the glass of Calvados she had given each of us at the end of the meal. Bringing it up again as she brought the bill, and the receipts for signature.\n\nIf you like fat, and a strong cocktail to cut that fat, get some hedonistic friends together and see if you can get a booth.

Our waiter was nice enough though the service was mediocre at best. We were checked on at 25 minute intervals.  Basically, everything was overpriced.

Forgettable. And the salt. The. Salt.  Too much - in everything.  My husband's sausage was ok.  Dry. No accoutrements. After everyone had a glass of wine and a main dish we were at $400.

Not exactly something I enjoyed at all #barfbarf, felt like I was eating spam.  But they were extremely polite about taking it away from me and off of my check.  Word of advice... if you're thinking of trying the pate, save yourself some money and pop some bologne in a blender, same thing.  However they're quit proud of their charcuterie so be kind spitting it into your napkin.\n\nI then ordered the grilled pork chop with some sweet peppers as a side.  Very surprised after my experience with the pate (I can't let it go), the pork chop was probably one of the better tasting pork chops that I've ever had outside of my own.  The cook definitely knew what he was doing.  None of the herbs applied to the rub were charred nor burned telling me they were using delicacy with the open flame grilling which eliminating almost any bitterness you tend to find in grilled food.  Good flavor and texture.  A bit too much fat but it's pork so there you have it.  I didn't like the peppers, wont get into that so I'll just advise you to order the potatoes instead.  The young ladies sitting next to me started conversation with me and offered me some of their potatoes in exchange for my peppers.

Yes the Charcuterie was good, but for $26 you get very very little. Would not recommend it unless you have money to blow. The brunch entrees were entirely unimpressive, about $25 each, including a pork burger that you could get for $10 elsewhere. Brisket was decent, but tiny and unsatisfying - for $25, I expect a lot more. AND the worst part is that the food took over 45 min when the restaurant wasnt that busy. The server was nice enough in the beginning, but didnt check up on us at all in the 45 min we were waiting to let us know it was coming or anything. Will not be coming back or recommending to any friends.", "author": "Jason K."}

The space is surprisingly small and feels very bar-centric but has a great vintage feel.  There literally are only 5 booths in there (I hear they're communal), so definitely make a reservation.\n\nThe menu changes seasonally but was very meat focused with charcuterie, salumi, and mains all directed towards carnivores.\n\nDrinks were well crafted, and my favorite was the boothby: bourbon based with a slight hint of citrus and bubbles. In between courses, you have to go with their namesake, the Trou Normand, as a palate cleanser.  Added bonus: house sparkling water.\n\nFood:\n1. Charcuterie plate: big plate with pork belly and various other meats. It comes with an epi baguette (acme?) with a strong stone ground mustard that I loved\n2. Lardo with carraway: melts in your mouth, nice carraway flavor\n3. Porcini salami: subtle, great with mustard\n4. Finocchiona: wild fennel pollen sounded pretty amazing, and this was also a very well seasoned meat\n5. Arancini: 4 freshly fried balls of rice, not as cheesy as I would like\n6. Lamb ragu: tagliatelle with a slight hint of mint, lots of pecorino, and a lamb ragout, probably my favorite of the night\n7. Asparagus: thin, roasted with brown butter, tender. A tiny portion but really good\n8. Sausage plate: Merguez was very flavorful, but I loved the currywurst. It had lots of great curry flavor and was balanced nicely by the mustard and sauerkfraut\n9. Lamb mixed roast: various lamb parts with great textures and different preparations. The entree portion is great for sharing\n\nDessert:\nAffogato. Done. $5. Amazing espresso and vanilla ice cream, probably my favorite simple dessert.\n\nIt's not exactly vegetarian friendly, but you could probably figure something out with a combination of sides. We definitely went protein style, but the epi baguette was a nice surprise/accompaniment for the meats. The meat heavy menu goes well with the cocktails, and I loved that none of them were too sweet.\n\nTrou Normand has a very unique feel and a really nice addition to the Financial district.", "author": "Marilyn T."}

Came here with the lady on a Monday night (reservations are a plus) and enjoyed the small charcuterie plate and some cheese. Really flavorful, and good variety, and well priced for the quality (guanciale was my favorite, followed by the pate). Also got the pork chop and a side of polenta, which were decent. Now the only complaint I have there is the pork chop literally comes as a pork chop. No sides, no fuss, but I sort of wish there was a side that came with it and I didn't have to pay extra for my side. That, and the pork chop, while it was cooked to perfection and had a great flavor profile, was just a bit too salty for me (and I like salt). That is probably the only knock I have on the place, and the only reason it is not 5 stars for me, as I paid like 36 bucks for a pork chop that was just too salty.

The food was mediocre - the cod was dry and lacking flavor, the charcuterie and salumi were average - not remotely like what we expected from the glowing reviews.  The service was terrible - highly inattentive.  The best part of the meal was the guitarists who did a great job despite the intermittent roar of municipal trucks - we were seated in the covered patio at the back.

It's not so much that the staff was mean but I have never felt so ignored or forgotten when I have dined out. It would be one thing if the wait staff did not come by to check in but they DID ask multiple times if we were okay or needed anything and we did ask for items (the first time our waiter came by 30 minutes after we ordered and was surprised our food hadn't come out yet- instead of following up on this he disappeared. A separate waitor asked if we needed anything and we asked for more bread for our charcuterie board-he disappeared and never came back. When I flagged a third waitress down she brought our bread in 5 minutes and mumbled something about being busy). For a $200+ dinner I honestly expected more. My sister and mom were visiting from out of town and we wanted to take them some place nice. Unfortunately we all walked out disappointed. The biggest joke was on us as the gratuity we thought about reducing was automatically added in to all bills regardless of party size (we had 4 people) so there was no accountability or reason for them to provide good service when they were getting a full tip anyway.

A very original idea, cured meats are the star of the menu, but I would have liked too see a larger selection. The sample menu on-line seemed to have a greater selection than the Monday I was there for lunch. A lot of the food is small so you have to order several items. The prices were good for a upscale place located in the famous old PacBell Skyscraper. I think it would have been cool to have it open to the lobby, but I don't own the building so..... Very unique place. I'll be back someday. p.s. free sparkling water was a plus. Valet parking would be nice. Had to walk a ways.

Also, it is pretty amazing that the booze comes from barrels handpicked in France specially for them meaning this is the only place your gonna have that specific alcohol.\n\nWe started with the  large  Charcuterie plate: tongue and cheek (amazing), rabbit pate, mortadella, ham, and ciccioli served with spicy mustard. \n\nHands down favorite of the starter was the pork belly confit with orange and cilantro, but the salad with both roasted and fresh carrots, dried apricots and almonds is also a must. \n\nAfter our Trou normand, for the main course there was grilled pork chop (juicy and flavorful), rabbit legs (my favorite), polenta, roasted asparagus with brown butter and lemon (tasty), grilled spring onions with sherry vinaigrette. All very good.\n\nAs for dessert we only had a choice between banana cream or strawberry rhubarb pie from Mission pies.  \n\n My only complaint was that the drink menu leaves something to be desired-focused on Armagnac, Cognac, and Calvados, lots of old fashioned type cocktails I guess to be expected from a restaurant theme based on the tradition of drinking calvados between courses.\n\nI also liked ambience,  the communal seating at the tables and want to check back when the climate controlled outdoor seating opens.", "author": "Amy M."}

The service is really where it suffered. We made our reservations 2 weeks in advance coming from out of town.  Upon arrival the host was kind and seated us almost immediately.  We were seated at a community table which i thought was a little weird but still fun.  Our waitress came over shortly after to take our drink order.  Poor girl looked like a deer in headlights when we asked her about the different cocktails and what she recommended.  Drinks came about 20 minutes later (i understand they are \"craft\") didn't mind the wait.  Really my issue is that the menu has about 8 items on it, and she was pretty clueless about all of them especially the Charcuterie.. we ended up ordering the chefs choice mainly due to her lack of knowledge.  The busser/food runner delivered the food but did not explain what was on the board.  This was chefs choice so we had NO idea what we were eating.  Everything was pretty tasty but still felt like a guessing game with each bite. Fast forward 25 minutes, the host (manager?) came by and we were able to order another drink from him.

A chef's selection of 4 scrumptious salumi and pates with amazing bread. I would've preferred some cheese to the animal fat gelee that they offer as an accompaniment. It would also be nice to pick what you get, but it was all still very delicious. Our braised pork pappardelle dish was also tasty, but could've arrived more hot than lukewarm. There are no sides and it's a decent sized portion for $18.00. I wasn't impressed with the red wine selection by the glass. I also was less than impressed by the snooty hipster vibe that pervades at this restaurant. It was less than friendly, laissez-faire and chilly service. Literally chilly, since there is zero space inside the restaurant so you're stuck outside on the back patio at a communal table freezing your buns off. It was a very pretty atmosphere and they had two talented guitarists strumming some of our favorite gypsy guitar, but we weren't comfortable and were very cold. Our heating lamp was out and one of the servers made one attempt to fix it and then never came back or tried to remedy it. I probably won't be going back.

First off, it is pretty difficult to find as the restaurant's signage is so minimalistic. If you blink, you'll miss it.  However, once you step inside, it's spacious and beautiful.   I loved the decor as much as I loved the food.  We started off with a medium sized combination charcuterie plate, which was amazing.  They brought out an additional baguette for us, which was quite helpful since the portions of toast that accompanied the dish weren't enough.  Their coffee was rich and delicious...not sure of the brand they were brewing, but I'm a fan.  My fiance ordered an old fashioned and he said it was one of the best he'd ever had.  I was in the mood for a non-alcoholic beverage and they recommended a house-made ginger beer drink.  I wouldn't recommend it as it was overpowered by lemon.  Not sure if that's my taste or if the bartender  went a little heavy on the lemon.  Either way, I was still super happy with my Chicory Salad and  Arancini snack - SO GOOD!!!  He had Eggs Benedict, which we believe was a special, and he LOVED it.  I tasted it and had order envy, myself.  Next time we're in that part of town, we'll definitely stop by for another meal.

My husband and I went here last night for his birthday dinner. We were very excited due to all the reviews and articles on this place. We started off with the sage salumi and Arancini. Both were incredible. The Arancini had a sausage or some pork in It but not overpowering. We then had a mixed green salad grilled peaches and almonds. So light and refreshing. The dressing was a very faint vinaigrette which was perfect on that hot night. Next up was the trout, pork chop and squash with pesto. WOOOWWWW everyone needs to order the Pork Chop. I am not one to order this often if ever and I was blown away. The seasoning and light broth sauce on top was so rich. The meat was tender and juicy. The trout was delicious too. Not fishy. My favie was the squash. The pesto they make is addicting. We ended it all with two pies from Mission pie, the Peach Raspberry and the famous Banana Cream.

The concept is a good one, but that's about all it is--a concept.  In reality, it's extremely noisy, very crowded [almost all communal tables, which doesn't sit well with my friends and me], and quite pricy for what it is.  Now, I realise that there is no tipping at Trou Normand, and that the higher menu prices reflect that, and that's the way the restaurant business is heading.  However, I really bridle at paying $15 for a cocktail (OK, so think $12 + $3 tip) that's barely two or three swallows.  As for the food, very tasty, no complaints there, but again: $30 for a (beautiful) pork chop, but that's all that's on the plate...one pork chop.  Everything else is ordered as a side dish.  I think for $30 a chop could come with at least a few green beans or mashed potatoes.\nI'm glad I went, I glad I tried it, but probably won't go back again anytime soon.

My friend and I were escorted to the insulated back patio and seated at a sharing table beside the bar.  Please keep in mind there was no one else back there.  We ordered wine and appetizers and my friend moved to sit beside me as we were both freezing under the heat lamps.  Well you would have thought she had asked to sit and eat naked.  There was another larger party of 6 seated at our table and for some reason our seating situation was a problem for the hostess so they all stood around staring at us.  They were finally seated.  The wait staff/hostess came by literally every 5 min to ask if were were finished and you just got this sense they wanted us out.  We ordered salads as an entree and I asked for fresh pepper.  The attitude and smart response back from the waiter was the final straw - asking sarcastically \"is there anything ELSE?\"  Give me a break - you serve wine and salami and cheese- get a grip.

The recommended pea side was a surprise hit with our pea-hating friend and the rest of the table. The menu seems limited to what is good now, so will not be the most extensive menu you have seen.

They brought us warm water without ice, and told us to move to the end of the table so that a party of 6 could be seated at the same table as with us. I've never been to a place that people were forced to share a table. We each ordered a cocktail. I ordered the tequila cocktail for $12. It was in a normal sized glass, but when I pulled out the huge ice cube from the glass, there wasn't even a full shot left in the bottom. As far as the menu went, there were only 6 entr\u00e9es to pick from ranging $20-$40. The sides were ordered separately, and ranged $10-$20. Nothing looked appealing, so we ordered 2 appetizers to share. So $60 later, we left still hungry and without even a buzz.

The main courses we ordered were just OK - nothing worth coming back for especially for the price. On top of that - you have to order your sides separately - which in other restaurants cost as much as a main! Why not just serve it together?!? I would've given this place 1 or two more stars except for the final part of our experience - which in my opinion was rude and unlike anything I've ever experienced. We passed on dessert but we were actually going to order a bottle of bubbly except the woman at the front came up to our table and asked if we were going to take any longer because another party needed our table.
