Beautiful views of Twin Peaks, Sutro tower, and the city all in one glance. \n\n- Visited first time on a weekend afternoon. It was a hot day in SF (T-shirt/ shorts type of weather ~ 73+ F) however, walking up towards the hill, under tall trees, it became chilly. Wearing layers (a light jacket or long sleeve shirt) will do.\n\n- The hills are not steep, but rocky. The rocks are in various shapes and size, which makes the path unpredictable. One of us slipped & fell due to the crushed stones & slippery dirt. It's helpful to have a trekking pole, and wear gripping, hiking shoes. \n\n- There are plenty of spots to take photos along the hike. But the most beautiful is on the top, where you can get a 180 degree panoramic of the city. \n\n- The cross is very interesting, esp during sunset the sun streaks shine through. \n\n- This place is dog-friendly (on leash) and overall a very down-to-earth ambiance.

If you follow Yelp's directions, it will lead you to one of the entrances of the park. There is plenty of parking around the entrances. Don't be discouraged by the narrow path, you will know you are on the right path when you see the SF Recreations sign a couple steps in. I believe it is 1 mile round-trip hike. The first half of the way up is a bit steep, but not bad at all. For reference, my 60 year old mother in decent shape was able to reach the top, being only a bit out of breath. \n\nAt a crossroad, you will see one flatter path, and another path with stairs. For a challenge, go up the stairs. There will be a bit of an incline on a dirt path after that, so make sure to wear shoes with good traction if you opt for that route. Both times, I've gone with the flatter path, which loops around to the top. Make sure to go on a clear day! You won't see much at all otherwise. Check out the huge cross at one end, and walk down to the large tree on the other. You'll be able to see the people on Twin Peaks, granted they will look like ants.

As a potato, this was a nice place to walk and get a nice view of the city. At the entrance, there were 3 walking sticks, I'm assuming, that were left by previous hikers which made me think this would be a difficult hike. I took one with me just in case, but did not need it because the hike was so easy peasy. Walking up and down the hill took me less than half an hour at a slow, comfortable pace.\n\nI came here on a sunny day and didn't need any layers, but I would recommend still bringing a light jacket just in case Karl the Fog comes around plus you are shaded by trees. Some of the ground was wet and muddy so be aware of where you step. \n\nAt the top of the hike, you could see a grand view of downtown, Sunset district, and Bay Shore which was breathtaking. There is a dead tree that you could climb and take rad pictures!! There is also a big cross that several people were hanging out and reading books. \n\nDefinitely coming back here again!!", "author": "Cindy M."}

Be careful on the trails as the rocks are a bit slippery at some points. There is a nice tree on the top of the hill for pictures. Climbing the tree is easy but getting off may be a bit tricky. In my experience, the best way is to slide it down. Yes, slide down the tree. It may sound a bit crazy, but it works. Above the hill with the tree is the giant cross. This hike has several trails that all lead to the top. If the path splits off and you are not sure if it is a trail then do not go on it. It will most likely lead to a dead end and you will have to go back. DO NOT go off the trail and try to create your own shortcut. There are a bunch of thorns everywhere and you will only be hurting yourself and nature. I had a friend who did that because he went off on a trail that led to a dead end and tried to make a shortcut back to the main trail. He came back with cuts everywhere. Overall, an easy hike if you stick on the main trail and always go up. Also, this hike could definitely benefit from having signs.", "author": "Dang L."}

The entrance that we started from was Rockdale and Myra. There are stairs in the residential neighborhood that lead up to the trail. It is a bit hard to notice initially, but look for the cobble step stairs. There is plenty of parking near the entrance in this area. Initially when you hike up, the trail is very narrow and you brush against the bushes, but the trail widens as you head in. This a fairly easy hike and not too crowded of a destination. The trails in this park are not marked, but you can figure out your way with Google Maps. It took us maybe 15 minutes to get to the top. The two main locations that people tend to go to on this hike is the giant cross and vista viewpoint, which was where we hiked to. The cross is humongous, over 100 feet tall, one of the tallest crossest. Mount Davidson is known as the highest point in SF, so naturally, there are amazing views here. For the view, head over to vista viewpoint, which is very close to the cross. There is a fallen tree in the viewpoint area, where many people like to take pictures. It can get windy, so bring a jacket. It is definitely worth it to go to the vista viewpoint and it wouldn't take you long at all.", "author": "Julia K."}

It's hard to believe we have this gem right in the middle of a bustling city! You'll traverse through the 'forest' for about a mile, slightly inclining as you go, until you exit the forest and are rewarded with gorgeous sweeping views of the city, as you wrap around the mount, the view reveals more neighborhoods. You can really take a deep breath and appreciate the beauty of SF here! Hike another quarter mile and the incline picks up a little more, but not much farther, you've made it! \n\nThe cross atop the mount is a nice landmark. It looks a little eerie on a foggy day for sure. There's a decent area to walk around and appreciate the city before heading down.

From there it was about 1.5 mile walk to Mount Davidson. The walk there in itself is pretty good workout. You're walking up hill almost the entire time and can turn around and catch some pretty amazing views from atop streets like Teresita and Buena Vista on the way up.\n\nOnce we got to the park, we took the first trail up that we saw, which wasn't that strenuous of a climb. We took in the bay and downtown views as well as the great views of the Sutro Tower and Twin Peaks. Fortunately it was a crystal clear day so that made it all the more glorious. Still feeling like walking more we took some of the trails that wind down through the forested area and once you reach a certain a point, you forget you're in San Francisco-quiet and green with small winding trails. Then you turn a corner and you can see the houses below. Back up again towards the top wasn't that challenging but got a little bit of a glute and calf burn. That with the fresh air and sunny day just was perfect.\n\nThe cross itself, I felt, was pretty awe inspiring. I am not religious in the sense of organized religion, but thought it was a pretty magnificent monument. Surrounded by the trees, I did feel a certain reverance for it. Any naysayers of it just let it be. \n\nI wouldn't drive out of my way JUST to come here, but recommend you make an urban hiking day out of it and include this destination on your itinerary. The views are slightly different than up on Twin Peaks and the location itself is off the beaten path from the typical touristy SF areas. \n\nLots of friendly people with their dogs and children-the paths were moderate enough where we saw some 5 or 6 year olds clamboring around with no problem.", "author": "Jennifer N."}

Davidson I'm surprised that no one (yet) knows the background of the cross on top. It was *not* placed there by the Armenian community, although they currently manage the immediate grounds surrounding it. \n\nThe cross -- of which this is the fourth version -- originally served two purposes. The first was to show the religious roots of San Francisco -- the city of St. Francis. The second was to serve as a navigational aid to ships off the coast. If you imagine the mountain without any eucalyptus trees -- grrrr!, invasive species!! -- you can also imagine how visible the cross was to offshore vessels. Thus, whether you were on land or at sea, you knew where you were.\n\nBecause Mt. Davidson is owned by the city, there was a long debate concerning the cross itself. Is it civic? --secular? --religious? Finally, in the early 1990s, several institutions jointly sued the city in order to force the issue to a resolution, which was to auction the footprint of the cross itself to the highest bidder. A collection of Armenian Christian groups from NorCal won, and paid the city 26K for the right to privately manage that footprint. They then installed the plaque which many Yelpers have noted.\n\nI live on Mt. Davidson and love the area and the park. Why the 4 starts? Bcs the eucalyptus trees need to go. They occlude the view both of, and from, the top, and have completely changed the flora & fauna of the undergrowth.", "author": "Kern T."}

Like, you could be feeling like total crap, but then you arrive at this place, or some place finds you unexpectedly, and then you feel that much better.  The power of place.\n\nThis is one of those places.\n\nI've only been here once, but that experience was good enough for me to write a review praising this place.  \n\nIt was at least five years ago; I was silly, young, bright-eyed (well, not that I'm not still those things, but I think less so than before) and was packed in a car at 3am in the morning with several other silly, young bright-eyed souls.  Ready for something amazing.  \n\nI don't find myself in this area of the city often, so when the leader of our pack drove us here, I was excited, curious, and as always, ready for a new adventure.  \n\nThings quickly turned sour when we got here, and I realized that it was pitch dark and we'd have to climb through a literal jungle to get to the top.  I started complaining about how ridiculous it was; how it was so dark and late and we were blindly trying to find our way through bushes and twigs and trees to get to lord knows where.  It was all uphill too, and I was getting dirty and couldn't see my way.  So, needless to say, I was not a happy camper.\n\nBut.  We eventually got to the top, and here's what I mean by \"mood-changing.\"  \n\nI immediately forgot about how annoyed and irritated I was during the climb.  \n\nBecause the view was gorgeous.  I could see EVERYTHING.  All the lights.  The entire city of shining lights against the backdrop of the piercing black night sky.  It was breathtaking.  I couldn't believe we were here, lucky enough to take it all in.  Lucky enough to live here.  You just stand up there, shivering in the cold, but warm from those bubbles that come out of you when you're amazed or overjoyed.  \n\nI've never been up here during the day, but I imagine it's just as awesome.  But I am a fan of the night and the dark and the lights that come with it all.

There are a couple of short staircases but generally it is a short, relatively accessible walk. Parking is very plentiful in the neighborhood.\n- While this is not challenging, I disagree a little that this is super-easy, absolutely no problem, etc, like many of the reviews say. We had no problems being youngish fit people with an active nimble doggy, but an older person could easily fall on the loose rocks in places. There are no handrails. At the end to get up to the cross, it is a somewhat steep incline on loose dirt. However if you stay on the major trails it's one of the less challenging nature hikes in the city. Wear close-toed shoes since there are little rocks in parts of the walk.\n- Dogs have to stay on a leash. Why? \n- The grass and trees are very high on both sides of the trail. So for long stretches you are just walking through high greenery, which does feel very much like being \"in the forest\" but there's no city view and little variety. Bernal Heights is rocky and dry but the walk is more interesting because the views are spectacular all around. \n- No water fountains and very few picnic or sitting areas. So all there is to do is walk through the high grass/trees and then turn around and walk down.\n- Some people are into viewing the cross. Being Buddhists, the huge cement cross with sun rays shining down on it kind of freaked us out. This is a purely personal thing. \n- There should be some trash cans and dog bag stations. We saw a couple of large poops that were not picked up. Dog owners, pick up the poop!\n- Doggy enjoyed it a lot but I think she's had a little more fun elsewhere.

Not as good as from nearby Twin Peaks, but very good nonetheless (and at least also minus the crowds).

Well, I can't tell you that...but my ears did pop climbing up the hills!   There are views of SF here like no other...beautiful at sunrise, gorgeous at sunset!! A phenomenal place to take the dogs for a walk and forget all of your troubles!!   AND its famous for housing the giant  103 foot tall cross as well as the memorial to the Armenian genocide.  (growing up in SF, they used to light the cross up every night!!)  It can be rather muddy up here so wear some shoes with good traction. (there are so many trees that when the ground gets damp from the frequent fog it never really gets enough sunlight to dry out= muddy paths!)  Also, some of the hills are so steep that when you are moseying back down the hill you may want to bring a walking stick or a sturdy  pal to latch onto (yes, the hills are THAT steep...like the Alps of SF I tell ya, I half expected to find some goats and the Ricola guys tucked away up there!)\n\nIf you want to take in some great views/ local history, get a bit of cardio and don't mind journeying \"off the beaten path\"  pay a visit to Mt Davidson Park!", "author": "Karen S."}

THAT'S ABOVE SEA LEVEL! \n\nI WISH they would CUT DOWN THE TREES at the top of Mt. Davidson because they obstruct what could be a stunning 360 degree view of the bay area. As it is, the dense eucalyptus trees obstructs views toward the Pacific Ocean and Golden Gate Bridge. I can't see the sea for the forest. The view would be SO MONEY if they'd at least thin out the trees. \n\nFurthermore, those menacing tall trees also muddle the silhouette of the 103 foot concrete cross when viewed from far distances across the city. Perhaps if they MAKE THE CROSS BIGGER then it wouldn't be an issue. The monument resides on a portion of land that the City auctioned in 1997 to the Council of Armenian-American Organizations, and has since served as a memorial of the 1915 Armenian genocide. A 160-pound bronze plaque commemorating the genocide was once displayed at the base of the cross, but it was discovered missing in 2007. \n\nFrom bottom to top, Mt. Davidson is more of a casual stroll that a hiking place. You can ascend to the peak in 10 mins if you walk very slowly. On the clearing, you have a view from SF's downtown to the Oakland ship yard to San Bruno. Easter sunrise services have been held at this site for many years, I think since 1923. \n\nI'm awed when I look up at the towering cross. The view companied with the solitude and spiritual overtones, yields a good place for some quiet reflection:\n\n\"...am I a good person....\"\n\"..........will I make a difference.........\"\n\"......where will I be in five years......\"\n\"...can I get cell phone reception here....\"\n\".......I wonder if this place has been yelped yet.....\"", "author": "Teddy B."}

It's only about a mile if you just do the loop, but the landscape is very damp and cool, and can even be a bit muddy when there is consistent fog. It seems like it would be a nice escape on a hot day in the city. You'll see alot of ferns, blackberry brambles, wild strawberries, and ivy everywhere. \n\nFrom the top, on a clear day, you can see San Bruno. \n\nAn interesting tidbit: Although the park is owned by the city of San Francisco, the top of the mountain was sold in 1997 to the Council of Armenian-American Organizations of Northern California because of the 100 foot Cross on top, which is a memorial to an Armenian massacre in 1915. \n\nThe sale was to make a clear separation of church and state, which I think is fair, as I do believe strongly in separation of church & state, but I also support freedom of expression. \n\nThe quote at the bottom of the cross reads in both Armenian and English: \"If evil of this magnitude can be ignored, if our own children forget then we deserve oblivion and earn the world's scorn.\" Avedis Aharonian (writer and educator, 1866-1948). \n\nA suggestion: Stand at the foot of the cross in this open space among all the trees, slightly shrouded in fog, meditate for a second on the efforts of all the people involved in erecting this monument, and look up to the top of the cross. It's a moving experience (and I'm not even Christian). Some seem to think it's an assertation of Christianity, but it's obviously simply a memorial to people who died in a massacre.", "author": "N B."}

Gorgeous views of the city. \n\nThe only bad thing that kind of took away from it all was the fenced off areas along the trail and part of the peak. I guess if we came up from the other side, it would have been easier to get to, but we maneuvered our way between the bushes and the chain link fence and made it to the cross. \n\nIt's such a humbling experience to see that cross looming over you, and it's so very peaceful up there.
