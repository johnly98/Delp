We have been coming here since Melinda used to work behind the bar  and might I add she was the most personable bartender there by far. Aside from the Manager of course, Ethan who is always very friendly. The owner as well, Andrew is super nice as well. Some of the new employees are nice too like the Latin guy, I believe by the name of Uriel. It's always nice to come in and they know who you are and what not.\n\nHowever, tonight I came in, it's Monday night, September 11th, 2017 about 6:30pm and I came in craving a glass of wine. The bartender (older short, balding with a scruffy face) or who ever was working behind the bar tonight did not seem like he really wanted to be there or did not seem like he wanted to serve me a glass of wine. He was not very nice. I don't know who he is because I have never seen him before, maybe he is new. But he was not so pleasantly inviting like everyone else. \n\nI sat at the bar first, thinking hey I'm by myself, why not just grab a spot at the bar. He was very particular and wanted me to sit on the bar stool all the way to the right because \"he was closing the left side of the bar area\" so then okay, I decide to to just sit at a round table behind me. Then he comes up to me to tell me to ask if I can sit somewhere else at the other side of the room, \"he was also closing that area of the glass tables down\" where I decided to sit after he was so picky of where he wanted me to sit at the bar. So I look at him and say, okay thank you and walked out. Who is this guy?!?!?!\n\nNever have I ever walked into Blanc Et Rouge and asked not to sit here or not to sit there. I don't know if he was just being very particular or maybe he took one look at me and thought that he didn't want me there or he did want to serve me a glass of wine. Never have I ever experienced any of the the employees there telling me where to sit. Usually you come in, find any spot to sit and order a glass of wine. Pretty standard practice, so I don't know what this guy's problem was.\n\nPaul (Mr. St. John \"You're so fierce\") and I love coming here and the owner, manager and a few of the employees there are really nice. Except this guy.   I don't have any personal issues with him or have never met him, but it sure did feel like he had issues with me. Or at least issues of where he wanted me to sit. His customer service skills, subpar.", "author": "Mr G."}

Everyone has something specific they are looking for when they head out for a beverage after a long day. But let me be super clear that if you are in the financial district EVERY bar fills up to the gills. It baffles me beyond belief that individuals come into a bar at 5:30p and expect super fast service all while they walked in with several other parties all at the same time. \n\nThis is a SMALL wine bar; it's chill, it's easy. If you want fast service minutes from sitting down, go to Schroeders or the Royal Exchange across the street - to an actual fully staffed restaurant. From the several visits I've enjoyed here the staff works hard and actually have personalities (they don't mind getting to know you - unlike other bars in the city who just want to pour you a drink). \n\nSadly the cons of this place are the rude clientele that sometimes frequents the place and the lack of management supporting the staff.

We were there on a Tuesday(!) night. While seated at a table with no menu or anything, I waited for a waitress for about 15 minutes. Nothing. Finally I went to the bar. It was difficult to approach the bartender because there wasn't really a place to do so without impeding on the people sitting at the bar. Finally, I caught her eye, but she looked me in the eye and kept walking. It was pretty obvious what I was standing there for as I read the menu. After about 10 minutes of watching the two women behind the bar appear to have no idea what they were doing or care if they sold anything food or beverages, I got aggressive and requested service. The woman said she would bring it and the bill to my table. So I finally got a drink. Also, one restroom for all patrons seems paltry when people are drinking.

We arrived before 6 and found a table for two no problem, and our server was quick to help us and advise we had 10 minutes to take advantage of the happy hour items.  You don't have to tell me twice!  I ordered up a glass of the happy hour Cava, my friend went with a Willamette Pinot Noir, and we shared their Croque Monsieur and Baked Brie.  \n\nThe cava was lovely and served up generously, and was of course a fabulous pairing for our cheesy eats.  The croque was nice and cutting it into bite-size pieces made it very bar friendly, but since we didn't wolf them down, as they got cooler they got a bit chewier.  So don't hesitate with those bad boys, inhale them!  The baked brie though - heavenly.  A reasonable amount of cheese wrapped and perfectly baked in layers of phyllo, paired up with pecans and dark cherries, resting in a pool of a flowery honey with lingering flavors of baking spices.  All those notes mixed together, with butter topping it all off (I don't know where they were hiding it - from the phyllo?  Blended with the honey?  Who knows, what I DO know is I was happy it was there!), it was just a divine dish, and a perfect decadent food to pair up with a light crisp wine.  The menu did say it would be served with figs, which would have been preferable and would have elevated the dish even higher, but I was still very happy with what we received.  \n\nService became quite slow after our first round and food arrived, I was surprised that servers at a packed wine bar in the FiDi weren't hovering over us to re-order $14 glasses of wine every other minute!  So while I appreciate a low pressure atmosphere, we could have used a smidge more attention.  \n\nOtherwise, I very much enjoyed my visit!  A lovely environment, and despite what others have said I found the douche factor to be quite low, although we did visit on a Tuesday.

I met a group of 8 other professional women for happy hour here after work last night. At first things were great. Our server was nice and very attentive the entire time, and I immediately recognized the manager from another restaurant I had attended with a colleagues about 2 months ago. He was also very attentive to our party and engaged us with the same enthusiasm and respect as he engaged my colleague and I in when we met him in May.\n\nThe bartender, however, had a HUGE issue with us that I noticed from the moment that I sat down. I had a clear view of the bar. He repeatedly looked over at our party any time that we laughed out loud, continued to engage his colleagues in conversation while peering over in our direction, and at one point even mocked our laughter.\n\nUnfortunately, I wasn't shocked when he approached our table. I was shocked, however, that he approached our table and asked us all to leave because he had lost 5 tables due to the raucous that we were causing. He went on to say that we he \"gave us a chance to quiet down by lowering the music so that we wouldn't feel as though we needed to scream over it\". We asked him why he didn't come over earlier and explain this to us- why wait until 5 tables leave? Why not approach us after 3 tables left? He didn't have an answer.\n\nThere was a couple sitting right next to us that was sitting there the entire time that we our party was present and they said we didn't bother them at all. In fact, when they overheard our conversation with the bartender, they, too requested their check and left.\n\nWe were a large party of (professional) women of color who were enjoying each other's company. When one of my friends brought this to his attention, his response was \"Don't try to play the race card. This isn't about race. I have a son that's Black and Japanese and he has an afro.\" In a later conversation, he also asked 3 of my friend if they'd ever been to a quaint wine bar.\n\nWe'd already asked for the bill and we paid our share and tipped our waitress well because she was great, but I will never recommend that any of my friends and family even stop in for a drink at this establishment after the treatment that we received.

Surely I can't be the only that mistakes this place for the one on Grant next to the Hotel Triton. I could see myself texting someone to meet me here and then having them show up at the other place leading to an extended period of passive-aggressive silence where I talk smack behind his back and then there goes the friendship. Thanks a bunch, Blanc et Rouge, for destroying a relationship that took hours to ferment. Y'know, I actually haven't been here after work with besotted colleagues. I came here at lunch and found it eerily quiet as everyone else was buzzing by on the sidewalk (photo: http://bit.ly/1bZ91PM). Did I make a mistake?

A glass of wine for lunch? How bourgeois. Now the special applies to the sandwiches and the Quiche Lorraine, but the salads are a dollar extra. OK, so I ordered the Tuna Ni\u00e7oise Salad with a glass of the House Ros\u00e9 (photo: http://bit.ly/1bbxO5s). The salad itself was pretty good - butter lettuce combined with  hard-boiled egg, cucumber slices, fingerling potatoes, green beans, cherry tomatoes, and Ni\u00e7oise olives drizzled in a sherry vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/1aFZxay). I was a little bummed that they used a canned tuna instead of fresh ahi, but it wasn't offensively oily and there was a lot of it. The Ros\u00e9 was nothing special, just a refreshing chaser at a time of day when I probably needed the respite. Now where's my friend (looks at watch)?\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...a good Ni\u00e7oise in need of real tuna\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...it's a wine bar alright...and very quiet at 1PM\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...thought the waiter was quite attentive considering I was his only customer for a good stretch of my meal\nTOTAL - 3 stars...a little faux-French experience in the middle of the workday", "author": "Ed U."}

Yelp is a useful tool; however, it also has the ability to not only damage a business but the also damage the hard working employees with the click of one \"Post Review\" button. Please realize that a moment of frustration can do irreversible damage to a business. And attacking one individual repeatedly on a public forum only meant to share information about a business is completely unprofessional. \n\nI am a regular patron at Blanc and have experienced many lunch/happy crowds at this establishment. Unfortunately, I have often witnessed at Blanc the trend of at least one individual/group who believes that the wine bar and staff are there for only their personal needs (If you have ever worked in restaurants before you all know the attitude I'm referring too).\n\nRegarding the recent event, I was present for part of the interaction and wanted to share another perspective. I was already seated at the bar around 5pm when the happy hour crowd started to completely filling the space. There were several large groups and the noise level was boisterous per the norm. There is typically one or two groups that eventually escalate their volume above reason to be heard during the rush as they often do during happy hour at most bars in this area. However, even though the volume was high, there were several voices on this particular evening from a group against the wine wall that pierced through it all. They even made me turn several times in amazement at the piercing loud laughter. Again regardless of your perceived volume, if an employee of the establishment makes a request such as \"please try to be considerate of others in the space and lower your voices\", this is not a personal attack against you in any way. They need to keep all clientele comfortable, and might adjust the room as needed to allow for this to keep the business running smoothly/avoid loss of business. The mature reaction is to be considerate of other patrons and realize that you might have misjudged your own volume. \n\nAs a regular I have witnessed Ethan ask - only when needed - a variety of groups/individuals to be conscious of noise volumes so that the whole community of patrons can enjoy their experience. He has always been incredibly inviting/welcoming to those who show respect for the business and for the staff. Those who want to just enjoy a delicious beverage with good friends and unwind. To echo a prior review: \"I think this was a very unfortunate experience and do not think that the reviews here reflect what happened or how the bartender handled the situation.

Horrible hospitality and customer service. Would give zero stars if possible. Recommendation: dont waste your time- you'll never get it back.", "author": "D. W."}

We also shared the Proven\u00e7al Flatbread, which was just enough for three people to split. \n\nI'd love to come back here and try a flight.

This is a lounge type of place more than a wine bar. There are a lot of seating, tables for two, tables for six, wine barrels cut and flipped as tables, leather ottomans even. Each are separated enough if you want privacy or don't want your group bothering others. Capacity is approximately 50, maybe more. A bit pricey (a glass of wine was $9-$24), but you can buy by bottle for a group. And, bottles of wines are 30% off if buying to-go.", "author": "Peter L."}

The situation seemed to have been completely out of control and I figured there would be some negative reviews today. I was not wrong. \n\nI arrived at the bar at 6pm, it was very crowded and very loud.  As someone who has been to this bar before, this noise level was not surprising. As the night wore on, people began to leave and the level of noise decreased, except from the one particular table who continued to carry on at a higher than need level. They were distracting and I noticed patrons, including myself glancing over at the commotion. I even heard a few tables get their tabs and mention they could not stay because it was difficult to carry on a conversation. One person came in, heard how loud they were and just left. The staff turned off the music hoping that the loud table would realize that they did not have to compete with the music. Finally, the bartender went over and talked to them. Immediately they seemed to take issue with him and could be heard arguing and asking why they were targeted. At that point the bar had only a few tables were left.\n\nThe bartender then came back to the bar to continue working, and the table could then be heard complaining about him and making sure that everyone in the bar was aware of how they felt. At one point a couple of them got up and approached a table next to them to share in their complaint.  After a few minutes they called the bartender back over and proceeded to argue with him for about 20 to 30 minutes. During this time some of them stomped out of the bar while others continued to engage him in a discussion.\n\nI have to say that it seemed that this issue was completely driven out of proportion.  I have been out with my friends before having a great time and not realizing, as we are excited, that we are speaking at a volume that is not appropriate indoors.  When staff has had to come over and ask for us to quiet down, we take it as mature adults, lower our voices and then continue on with our night. It does not matter who you are or what you do, if you are being rude and disturbing other patrons, or causing the staff to lose customers, which affects their ability to make a living, it is then the staff's responsibility to address this. All they had to do was lower their voices so that it was not so distracting to the other customers. Instead they choose to get pissed off and make a scene. \n\nWhile looking at the reviews left by those at the table, it seems one, their stories do not align and two, at times makes it seem as if the situation was something other than it was.  They were simply asked to quiet down.  They were not asked to leave and they even got another round of drinks after he first spoke to them before he was called back over by them. The bar was not empty at any time they were there.\n\nI think this was a very unfortunate experience and do not think that the reviews here reflect what happened or how the bartender handled the situation. It was simply the staff at Blanc et Rouge responding to complaints/loss of business and attempting to ensure that everyone, including the said table, continued to have a good time.", "author": "Meredith A."}

Blanc et Rouge has not changed the space terribly much--wine to take away or drink there still covers one wall, but there are now more seating options with a couch, some standing tables, and some low tables in addition to the bar option. \n\nThe wine selection may be a little bit cheaper, but just as diverse and well chosen.

Another employee frowned at us, \"No, those seats are reserved!\" We pointed to the cushioned seats by the side wall, \"No those seats are reserved too\" So I asked what tables exactly were available. He pointed hurriedly to one sad table near the back, \"Oh, I guess that one...\" and just walked away. So here's the problem with management. If you are going to turn over your whole venue to a private party put up a sign that the place is closed for a private event. Or if you are staying open then have one side of the place reserved and the other open for walk-ins. Or, even have better customer service.

Granted the St. Patty's day event was going on a block away from the wine spot, this does not count for an excuse for horrific service from the manager himself. Being a wine fanatic and growing up surrounded by my family winery I was always tempted to pop into this place when passing by on my way home from work. I entered with 3 other friends and browsed  the menu before deciding on what to order, the manager asked for our id's and we carried forward into our order. Since we had to go up to the bar to order a bottle of wine, we figured there is no need to leave a large tip, all he did was uncork the bottle of wine. We sat down and poured wine then noticing that one of the glasses had a crack down the middle, I went to exchange the glass out with a new one and this is when the manager stated he would not change out the glass because we did not tip him. These were his exact words, absolutely UNBELIEVABLE and completely unacceptable!!! I travel to various areas in California for wine tastings and have visited various wine bars in SF and I have NEVER experienced such horrendous service from anyone, let alone a manager.

Either way, someone else had chewed up something and put it into the food I was eating.\n\nI was not going to eat any more olives, and thought about not eating the rest of the salmon with crackers ($9 for a tablespoon of salmon), but he brought more.  As he set it down, he said \"I found out who's pit it was, and don't worry--their mouth is clean.\" Then left.  WHAT?!  That really wasn't the time to be making a joke when the cleanliness of the establishment is up for debate.  I thanked him anyways and moved it to the side of the table.  Kept talking and finished up, determined to get out of there.  Wine was good, great selection but now I was curious about the kitchen.\n\nHe returned to the table, noticed I was not eating the olives, and said \"You aren't eating them?  They are clean.\"  I thanked him but said no.  \"I already took them off your bill, so whatever.\" and he took them away.\n\nWOW.  I give them stars for being a great looking joint and having a very nice wine selection, but I will not go back, at least not for food or customer service!  On his defense, he apologized and changed the bill, but was still not really as disturbed as he should be.  What a shame. . .", "author": "Karebear R."}
