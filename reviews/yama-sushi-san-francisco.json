This might be attractive in a time of famine but at this point instant miso soup out of a packet would be leaps and bounds above this swill. \n\nEnded up dumping both the ramen and miso soup after a few sips.

The reason for my review is to share my story with their customer service rep, Grace, which I'll do at the end. Not too epic, but I'm very, very thankful. I never write reviews, so this is how thankful I am.\n\nFood: So, let me start by saying how much I love their fried foods (the chicken karaage and gyoza are my ABSOLUTE favorite and as a picky eater, that must mean something)! Perfect texture, seasoning, sauces; overall, delicious. I've only had one bad experience, which was when they gave me reeeally old versions, aka not crispy and had a really fishy smell/taste.. So, order by delivery at your own risk. It's been about 90% good fried food via deliveries for me, though, so I'm up for the risk.\n\nMoving onwards... Sushi? Unfortunately I'm not a fan AT ALL. I've eaten sushi almost all over CA, and this place disappoints me. The rolls are soooo tiny, and the taste is really old... Everything smells like old fish and tastes that way. The texture is also really chewy, so I stopped ordering their sushi after two tries... Noodles? Meh. No flavor. Rice dishes? No flavor. Vegetarian dishes? According to my brother, he loves it and goes here with his friends occasionally, so I'll say it's a thumbs up for you vegans/vegetarians out there. As for me...yeeeeah, the only thing I order is their fried foods lol.\n\nPrice: Really affordable and reasonable for what they give.\n\nCustomer Service: Here we go. The main reason for my review... It's a Friday before a holiday and unfortunately my order got horribly delayed, so I called the company. I spoke to Grace, who was very sweet and honest, and she told me it was very busy, so I told her I'd wait little longer. I ended up calling back after another hour and so of waiting (Seamleas said they closed an hour ago), and she apologized and realized they missed my order... Two people started chatting with her in Mandarin or Cantonese and they sounded like they didn't want to deal with me or something... After listening to their conversation, Grace was able to not only help me receive my order fresh with a free side dish, but also even delivered it to me herself! She even promised me a discount on my next order. At that moment I really wished I had cash on me because she deserves a reward for excellent customer service. I wrote a bad review about their food a month ago, but Grace made me really want to continue to order at Yama Sushi again. I hope they are treating her well!

Please do not order from \"Yama sushi\" or eat there. Worst food and customer service ever. I ordered from grub hub through Yelp and put in my order for pickup asap because the system would not let me place the order for pick up btwn 6:30 -7pm. I received an email stating grubhub received my order and is now confirming my order for take out within 60-70 mins and to keep your phone handy we will be in touch if any issues. I never received a confirmation that my order is being processed or ready for pick up through the app, email or text. Since 70 mins had passed I decided to call the restaurant if they had gotten my order because I was ready to cancel and just eat out. When I called a guy picked up and said my order had been ready for more than 30 mins. I told them i never gotten email, text or any form of notification that my order is ready. I asked the guy if he can remake the food since I had order karaage, meat, and sashimi. The guy said no and told me I can microwave it. I told him I never got any notification or call from them that my order was ready. I even checked the app and made sure all my notifications were on and there was nothing. All this time I had been wondering if they gotten my order. He said it's not their responsibility as I ordered from grubhub, I should notify grubhub. So I called grubhub and grubhub spoke to the owner to see if they can remake my food or partial refund, however, the owner refused. Grubhub tried second attempt of negotiation and the only offer the owner gave was 10% off discount for next purchase. I declined as I was not going to go back ever again. So, grubhub gave me a $10 off  coupon for next purchase that's valid for 30 days.", "author": "Stanley L."}

I've always gotten my sushi delivered because driving by the place and seeing the lack of people gets me a little unsettled so sometimes I rather not remember that part when I order. I live over the hill (literally 2 minute drive from the place) so I don't expect the food to turn bad by the time it gets to my house. The miso soup was still boiling hot when I tried it so why can't the sushi be of same quality?\n\nI just came back from a trip and wasn't in the mood to cook. Since I live in a neighborhood where there aren't many restaurants around to deliver in the first place, I was already limited in my options. I was feeling some sushi so i thought I'd just try Yama again since last time wasn't so bad.\n\nWrong.\n\nThe order was on time (how can you mess that up, I ordered before they even opened) and the driver was friendly. As soon as I opened up the sushi, I could already tell this wasn't going to go well. The artificial crab was nearly gray. I was straining my eyes to try to find the red specks as part of the crab but the whole thing looked bland. That was already a red flag. I took the first bite and it was hard to swallow. The rice was not soft, it was 2-day old rice at least. Very dry and stale. So California Roll was already a bust. I also ordered the Peacock Roll but that didn't go well either. The fish was so not fresh or even satisfyingly edible so I gave up. I wanted to finish my miso soup but once it cooled down that didn't taste as good either.\n\nYama lost another customer today. Why buy cheap seafood when you lose money from your customers anyway? Up your sushi game, Yama or you probably won't stick around for much longer.\n\nOH & shoutout to Eat24 for refunding my whole order without any hassle. At least I know if I order through them, my money isn't completely lost if things go awry.", "author": "Cathy N."}

I was a customer for many years. Tonight I ordered delivery and had ordered some uni nigiri in addition to other items. When I opened the bag, I'd been given unagi nigiri instead. There's a difference in both what these things are and price as well. So I immediately called the restaurant. I tried to explain what happened and then was put on hold for two minutes. Then I had to repeat myself about three times about what happened. It's not the first time or even second time I've gotten wrong things from them but have let it go in the past. Third's a charm. The woman on the phone told me the manager would refund my credit card. I said \"fine\". About an hour and a half later they called me back and accused me of lying about the order. Who does that? They argued with me that I had really gotten it! And that I was making it up! It was a real wtf moment. I told them that if they wanted to lose my business over some uni that they were welcome to do so. But that they were the ones making things up. She actually yelled at me. Then also in a very angry tone said that they'd credit me for it. That remains to be seen. But it doesn't matter,  I won't be back there anytime soon. It's too cray-cray for me!

I am a sushi snob that usually only orders sashimi and nigiri, if I was in a much higher end sushi restaurant.\n\nYama is for ordering quick take-out/delivery rolls and bento boxes. You can even sit there (especially during Happy Hour specials!) and enjoy a Kirin and slowly pass your time by with meh-tasting sushi rolls. It's what they're for!\n\nThe SO lives walking distance from here so we decided to partake in their happy hour. Meh, it's just ok. It's nice though to be in a pretty quiet, nearly empty restaurant to relax and eat a little bit. After a small discussion, we decided not to waste our money on nigiri and sashimi, that can be for days we're at a nice sushi restaurant.\n\nInstead we spent our money on Kirin, a Black and White roll (Tofu and Eel, deep fried), rock and roll, Saba Shioyaki/Beef Teriyaki Bento and Baked Mussels.\n\nWe paid Happy Hour prices, which made everything decent. The BW roll barely had any eel. Saba/Beef and Rock n Roll, normal fare. The bento boxes are not bad for $9 at all (Come on this is still SF!)! Baked mussels, do not bother ordering these. MEH. A kirin, sapporo and hot sake. Our total was still under $40.\n\nNot too shabby! So again, don't order sashimi/nigiri, don't bother with anything that is super exotic or difficult to make. Save all of that money for a nice high-end sushi restaurant and you will enjoy having it much more. Bento boxes, easy to make rolls and cooked food items. Sure.

My order arrived with cold almost frozen in the center Gyoza, Cold Steak Terriyaki, and warm almost hot sushi that all the fish was dried out and inedible.  The sushi rolls tasted and looked like they were made hours prior and they just sat out on the counter.  They actually had a funky taste to which made me hesitant to eat more then one piece, fearing I may get sick.  Why would you mess around with raw fish and risk it.  The fish on one of the rolls was a powdery consistency and was hard like cement on top of a roll.  \n\nHaving just spent $60 on this order I contacted Grub hub seeking a refund on the ground that my meal was inedible and they tried to talk to the restaurant to get a refund after explaining to them the situation.  The restaurant said no so I spoke to them personally.  They refused to refund me money claiming they do not have any money from my order and all they could offer me was a free roll. (as if I would ever eat from here again)  I explained to the restaurant that i had tasted one of the rolls and immediately felt sick and couldn't eat the meal.  Their excuse was \"It was hot today\", mind you I ordered at 7pm and it was 65 degrees outside- how is that relevant?  The restaurant ended up telling me \"they would refund my money if they had it, but grubhub keeps it\"\n\n\nSo I tried again with Grub Hub and told them that the restaurant said they would approve a refund if they had the money, just as the restaurant had told me.  Grub Hub spoke to them and tried to get authorization... but the restaurant said no they would not give me a refund because I ate the meal!  CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT!\n\nThis place not only makes dangerous food, they even lie through their teeth.   They should not be in business.\n\nTo top it all off I ended up getting sick later that night with stomach cramps which was because of their nasty dangerous sushi (I ate nothing else that night).\n\nSo do not order from this place unless you want to risk getting sick from bad fish and wasting your money and being lied to.\n\nI intend to file a formal complaint with the health department regarding this restaurant and it is entirely the restaurants fault because of the way they handled the situation.\n\nIf a customer complains to you, you should do everything possible to make things right.", "author": "Shawn A."}

Despite the mixed reviews and personal thoughts that this might be a bad idea, my craving and my willingness to try a new sushi place overrode any doubts I might have had. Well, lesson learned.\n\nI ordered online so the only customer service I experienced was from the delivery guy. All of that was fine. He was at my door at the time promised and courteous enough. I was just glad he was not late (as other reviews suggested may happen) because I had to go to work.\n\nThe sushi, however, was what merits this 1-star review. As soon as I opened the clear plastic container, I could just see the poor quality of the fish. The color was just a bit off. It didn't smell especially bad, but I could tell it wasn't as fresh as I know it can be.\n\nEating it became a challenge. I ate exactly half of my two rolls and two pieces of nigiri before I had to give up and throw it away. When sushi makes you gag, that is a really bad sign. It was very disappointing.\n\nIt looks like others have had good experiences here, and maybe I just ordered the wrong thing on the wrong day.

For starters, the meal arrived late. Once I opened it up, everything seemed ok, except I didn't see the salmon skin roll. There was instead something that looked like a roll filled with tempura batter, which I can't eat. I decided to try the spicy scallop roll, which is usually my favorite, but it was completely inedible -- I actually spit it out. A few of the other items were disappointing, but edible. I don't usually do this, but I actually called them and let them know the salmon skin roll was missing from the order.

I said it wasn't, unless she meant the tempura batter roll. She said yes, they tempura fry it. I told them that, had I known that, I wouldn't have ordered it as I can't eat that. I've ordered salmon skin rolls from dozens of different places and it is never tempura battered. She said that is how they make it.

No one expects to bite down on a roll and get their gums and the roof of their mouth get pricked and jabbed with fish bones. That shit better be cleaned and deboned thoroughly. Instead, I'm the one picking out bones and chewing with extreme caution. This, to me, is simply unacceptable for a sushi place. Especially since people, especially KIDS, who haphazardly eat everything when they're hungry might actually choke.\n\nI'm probably done giving the local neighborhood joint more chances.

I was craving seafood and nothing else was close and from the outside Yama looked like a better bet than anything else in the neighborhood. The restaurant was almost empty and I ordered three small dishes - hamachi, oysters and a fish katsu. The service was quite slow considering the staff outnumbered the diners 6 to 1.\n\nThe kitchen staff, sushi chef and one man who I believe was an owner were bickering very loudly in Mandarin during my entire meal, so loud that I could hear every word of their conversation, even from the folks all the way in the back of the kitchen. The whole experience was unnerving and exactly the opposite of the quiet and relaxing atmosphere that most Japanese restaurants try to evoke. I even heard the owner mention something about MSG - which, from the context, seemed to indicate that they were using it in at least some of their food. This would come back to me in about an half hour when my head and body started to feel slightly off- my typical MSG reaction.\n\nThe fish was not absolutely terrible - not inedible - but there was something about it that felt cheap. What was certain is that it had none of the mildly salty and earthy oceanic flavors that I've experienced with places that carefully select the seafood they offer. What I had here tasted like it was sourced from whatever  wholesale fish vendor was cheapest.\n\nThe strangest part is that the whole meal left me with a feeling of heaviness and indigestion. I guess I am to blame to going to a random sushi joint for my fish fix.", "author": "Alan S."}

This is your average run of the mill Japanese restaurant. I've had their udon, a couple of their rolls, and some of their boxes. Nothing on their menu has jumped out at me or made me want to crave their foods.\nThe service was good considering every time I go, it's never busy.

No, of course you wouldn't expect an \"authentic\" Japanese owned and run restaurant around here, where the population is mainly Chinese and Black. Yes, I can probably get better Japanese food in Japantown and Japan itself.

Yama offers the typical dishes and sushi/rolls, about a buck or two cheaper than most places. Their fish has been fresh every time I go.\n\nService is usually pretty on-point. I like to go in the downtime (like early afternoons, right after the lunch rush) so the employees are usually sitting down to eat, but they never fail to bring me water or refill my glass when it's empty.\n\nThe chicken and beef teriyaki is cut very thinly, which is personally preferred. Not a fan of putting big chunks of meat into my mouth that takes five minutes to chew.\n\nAll in all, I would go back, simply because it takes me less than two minutes to walk here.

Yama makes an extremely weak effort to give off the vibe of ~Japanese~ when you are there, you are very aware you are in a Chinese restaurant disguised as Japanese. Esp the service! You feel like you are in chinatown! Being ignored, waitresses hustling and bustling, no check in's to see if everything is ok until they give me the check without asking if I wanted anything else.  \n\nFirst off, happy hour sushi is cheap... Approx 1.25 for nigiri; BOGO 1/2 price on a large selection of rolls, nice bento box lunch specials too around $6-7, a few other things too\n\nMy boyfriend and I get sushi very often, plus I used to waitress at a sushi restaurant, so whenever I try a new sushi restaurant, I know what to look for. I order a few things to sample their happy hour menu, 1 sake nigiri; 1 spicy tuna hand roll; 1 philly roll. Total was around $9\n\nNow QUALITY.... Sake nigiri was the best out of the 3; only because of the fish itself. The craftsmanship of the entire sake nigiri was not well done. Salmon to rice ratio was off, too much rice. Salmon cut poorly around the edges, as if the chef just thought, \"let me just chop this piece of fish into a rectangle\". \nNext, the spicy tune hand roll.... My GAWD, already soggy when it arrived. I know the seaweed on hand rolls can un-crunch quickly, BUT NOT THAT QUICKLY. I already know that crap was constructed at least 10 mins prior to giving it to me. So either they gave me a pre made HR, a HR sent back from another table, or the sushi chef doesn't know basic sushi/seaweed science!!!! HRs are either sent as soon as they are made, or the very last thing created and put on the plate before delivery.... Now to continue with the HR, spicy tuna was an more orange color instead of read, wasn't very good. Also had too much rice.\nFinally, the philly roll. I'll make this quick; salmon was meh, they used avocado instead of cucumber which made the roll extremely mushy. Individual attributes of the roll did not stand out, all mushed together in over cooked rice and soggy seaweed. \n\nDid I mention that everything came to me at room temperature! That's such a pet peeve of mine when it comes to sushi. You want sushi (the fish) cold or at least slightly under room temperature!!!!\n\nOverall, I would not come here if I wanted to *enjoy* my sushi.

I came in for dinner to go and ordered the rock n roll and the chicken katsu entree. \n\nChicken katsu: Came with a salad, rice, and the katsu. \n\nstrike 1: salad dressing was like water. Nuff said. \nstrike 2&3: chicken katsu: sliced so thin it was basically made of batter and ultra deep fried-edness. Ultimate weak sauce. \n\nand forgoing standard baseball rules:\n\nstrike 4: miso soup was apparently made out of packet. Now often times preprepared miso paste will be used sure but two things I noticed: 1) the tofu were little blocks that I know from experience (college student!) came out of plastic packet freeze dried. 2) the nori had little to no substance indicating (again) that it most likely came out of a packet. 3) miso was not miso paste: there's an innate quality that miso paste has that this soup basically lacked. It was all grainy and such. \n\nThe rock n' roll roll....well, again I've had better sushi but for like....4 bucks it surprisingly was enjoyable versus the main course. \n\nKatsu: 8.95 \nRoll: 3.95 \n\n15 bucks (with tip) \n\ntl;dr: the katsu was mediocre as was all the offerings that came with it. the sushi was alright. \n\nIn short: Essentially not good, essentially not worth it. \n\nGo to K's kitchen up in Glen Park: smidge more expensive but with more attention to detail and far far far far more delicious. \n\nLast 15 I spend at this place.

But even 3 weeks later, I'm still disgusted from it. Seeing the good amount of options and decent reviews, and I love sushi, I ended up ordering food here at 6:00pm online on the website listed here on yelp. 7:30pm rolls around, and I think, \"alright they must be busy, let me call them to confirm they got my order.\"\n\nI called and asked them if my order was on its way, they asked for my address, which I gave to them, and they said that it should be there in 15 minutes. I waited another 30 minutes before I started getting very angry. It's 8:15 when I call them again, this time furious, demanding why it is taking so long for my food. This is a different person I am talking to at this point, and I tell her everything up to this point. She says her system didn't get my order. But I don't understand why I was told it was on the way when I called the first time. I then proceeded to ask for a refund, but she says I would have to call the website I ordered from. I've been through this issue before with other companies, and would rather just get my food than having to deal with this mess more, so I asked them to just send the food. I had to reorder everything, but it's been 2.5 hours by the time I put in the initial order and do not remember what it was, but eventually found it online. \n\nI thought it was pretty convenient that my order never got to their system, but after my 2nd phone call, I got the order confirmation. When everything was said and done, it was 9:00pm by the time I got the food. They apologized, told me their system was broken (although I think the real reason was they got super busy and forgot to confirm), and gave me two free Temaki sushi for my troubles\n\nThe sushi was delicious, I really wanted to not give this place 1 star, but 3 hours for food is unacceptable. Also, I heard them speaking to each other in Chinese (cantonese to be exact), but the voice they imitate on the phone is very stereotypical Japanese. On any other day, it would be a 4 star review, just not today.", "author": "Phan H."}

It used to be a soul food joint called Miya's Place which was not welcoming when it was open. That has changed! \n\nThe owners of Yama Sushi greet you with smiles and the \"Hello My Name Is\" name tags mounted on their Japanese service robes - it's a cute touch. The place is not a trendy spot with smart design, a DJ, or themed sake cocktails - yet. In fact they do not have their beer/wine license now but they plan to load up on sake and beer to go with the very generous portions. We ordered a few things from the extensive menu: udon noodles, hand roll, sashimi, dragon roll, and green tea. \n\nOther than the kitsch fish plate the sashimi came on, the dishes looked and tasted good. VERY fresh fish with good density without being tough. The udon was good but they messed up on an order then dropped the wasabi on the table. It all fits with the \"cuteness\" of the place and Jeffery behind the sushi bar loves to talk. \n\nYama Sushi is a surprise in this neighborhood that has their share of freaks and sketchy characters hanging outside the liquor store at the corner. If you want a beer or wine with your meal you will have to go in this liquor store. There are some above-decent beers and wines that will do just fine for Yama Sushi - but bring your own until July/August when they can sell alcohol. \n\nThere are NOT a lot of sushi options around this area so I hope they keep the quality and portions consistent. A great value! Two people can feast for under $50 including tip. The massive Sashimi Plate is $22 and that is all I should have ordered. Normally that is a starter at most places.", "author": "James T."}

Not my thing. \n\nPros:\nSomewhat cheap.\n\nCons:\nAtmosphere: sort of cluttered and ramshackle for my taste. I am used to sushi places being pretty clean and clutter free in terms of the kitchen area, but not this place. \nAlso, the  whole wait staff took their dinner break while we were there at. 6:30.  There were six customers and then four or five staff all around us. I don't mind that they did that per se, but the fact is these ladies had some nasty table manners. One girl was talking with food in her mouth and chewing with her mouth wide open the whole time. Her companion, who was the sushi chef, was actually spitting little bones onto the table on a napkin and leaving them there. Behind me, one was smacking her food like she was chewing on a whole pack of gum. Now, I'll be the first to admit that I am somewhat grossed out by watching strangers eat in general, but this was just too much. I was a server myself and I remember taking quick meal breaks in a corner of the dining room. But this felt like I was the one who was interrupting, and mostly I hate bad table manners.

As soon as I was served I could tell that their fish wasn't fresh. I enjoyed the Godzilla roll just because of the crunch, but the 3 Amigo tasted like I bought it at a grocery store. The tuna was very light colored (definitely not how it should look), and unfortunately it tasted as bad as it looked. Usually I do not need to use soy sauce for my rolls but these were very bland. I had to lather them with soy sauce and wasabi. \n\nHappy hour (1-5pm) is nice though...buy one roll get the second half off, 1 pc nigiri for $1, 3 piece roll for $1.

There's a lot of young Asian girls working here (and they are pretty!), but they are a bit unfriendly. I don't think I've seen them smile before...\n\nSushi's are pretty cheap in retrospect. The quality is average if not below average.\nI had low expectations anyways, so the place met up to it.\nThe fish taste \"once-frozen,\" and sometimes it could have bones in it.\nI guess you get  what you paid for!\n\nThe last two times I've been here, it's been mainly to just drink a few sakes and beers along with some sushi and appetizers. Their sakes are cheaper than some other places in the city, and their beers are priced at $4.50 so at least it's not over priced.\n\nIn the end, if you'd like some cheap but meh sushi with some Japanese beer and sake, then this place isn't a bad choice.\nI wouldn't go out of my way to drive here from some where else though.", "author": "Rei O."}

The 3 Amigos Roll was what hit the spot and made Yama Sushi a winner for me.  The raw fish on that roll looked and tasted so so so fresh!  \n\nThe prices are decent...about the same as you would expect, but I think you are getting more than what you pay for in terms of quality.\n\nA plus about this place is that they have GOOD WATER.  I am VERY picky about my water.  If it has that tap taste, I cannot drink it at all.  And you will drink A LOT of their water because it is extremely hot in the restaurant.  No AC at all!

Fine, provably they were surprised. So I left with the menu and also asked before hand if they would deliver if I lived about less than 2 blocks away. They said yes! Because of this I'll give them another star. I had a stomach ache the whole day and I really needed food. So I ordered a sashimi appetizer (which I regret paying for even though it was only 7 bucks), a philly roll (it came in smoke samon but upon my request to change it to raw I had to add 50cents which is still a good price! Although no avocado), a Alaska roll (nothing of a wow) and a oyaka don (seemed like a Chinese dish more than a Japanese dish. This I will not order again) came to a total of 27 bucks? + tip. Expensive for something I didn't finish and tasted bad. \n\nFirst of all the sashimi was... Not fresh and warm. I had a stomach ache the whole day and was debating if I should throw it out to keep eating. Enough said. My favorite of all time is a Philly roll, and theirs were not a wow but it was okay for something that cost about 5 bucks. Although it doesn't have avocado which is a minus. The Alaska roll! Nothing of a wow but it was alright, just alright. The oyako don? Horrible. \n\nMy lesson learned, go elsewhere if I'm really looking for authentic Japanese food. But Yama is a pretty chill place, I will consider going back. \n\nFirst star: they have Philly roll for 5 bucks, yum cream cheese!\nSecond star: they deliver to my house! 2 blocks away!

But on three separate occasions, one or more of us got sick at Kamakura, so we stopped going.\n\nWe just got back from Yama.  The prices are great for what get and some of the dishes are pretty tasty, particularly the house salad and the sunumono.  The quality of the fish is mixed, as you might expect for the price.  The hamachi on our rolls was excellent, but the piece on the nigiri was a little old.  I had one piece of very good unagi and another that was so fatty that I gagged.  \n\nThe atmosphere is not much to speak of. It's small (Occupancy 34).  They pump the radio through the speaker at low volume.  It's got kind of a dressed up diner feel with some tacky Japanese flair thrown in.\n\nThis is a good, not great, sushi place.  We will go back there because we can walk there.  If you are feeling like sushi, don't want to spend too much and are tired of We Be, it's a good, slightly pricier, alternative.", "author": "John G."}

It's never been the best food, but they deliver and it's been fine for lunch ... until now. About a month ago, I ordered some sushi and two seaweed salads. When the food arrived, the salads were yellow (not green as they should be) and smelled bad. They were not edible. I called and spoke with a woman on the phone. I had paid cash and she offered to give me a credit for the salads the next time I ordered. Frankly, they should have given me a free meal (delivering bad food is dangerous and just bad business). But having been a regular customer for so long, I felt it was fine to cut them some slack. My mistake. When I made my next order, there was no \"record\" of the credit and rather than take my word for it (a long time customer) they refused to give me credit for the bad food that they delivered. It was my mistake to order from them again. Clearly, they don't care about the quality of their food, or the experience of their customers. Go anywhere but this place!", "author": "Laura C."}

It's a small yet comfortable size restaurant; very high ceiling and large windows.  However, they should purchase new window treatments that actually fit the window size. I know, not important, but things like that stick out to me. The location isn't that bad either, although it probably can be on the wrong day.  Anyways, here's the 411 on our rolls:\n\n49er: Love it! The fish was fresh and marinated tastefully. I liked the fish on top (I think it was tuna) with the avocado.\nVolcano: Similar to a Lion King roll, but without the mayo sauce on top. Warm and tasty, but the salmon on top was a little dry.\nSuper California: Just your typical California roll with avocado on top that didn't wow me in any way, but it wasn't nasty either.\nSpicy tuna: Good and mildly spicy, probably could've \"kicked it up a notch.\"\n\nIt was great to eat sushi at a place that knows how to cook their rice; it was light and fluffy vs. very hard and unappealing to my mouth. We also ordered the Poke (raw tuna marinated with sauce) which was also very tasty. I think I could probably make it myself because the \"secret\" ingredients tasted like soy sauce, sriracha (Asian hot sauce), and sesame oil.", "author": "Kimberly H."}

Only when I moved out here to New York did I realize how spoiled I was for having Yama Sushi right by my house.\n\n1) Their California Rolls use legit crab. We've all probably grabbed one of those plastic to-go trays from the mall food court, or out of Safeway, only to be disappointed at the way the imitation crab left you wanting more. That issue does not exist here. Boy are their California Rolls delish.\n\n2) The green tea ice cream is the best I have ever (and may ever!) have. While I am no ice cream connoisseur, I know that the fact I can taste the swirl of the caramelized sugar crystals means they make this homemade. When I went to school around the block, I'd often come here just to get the ice cream as an afternoon snack. Their fried bananas also do not disappoint. Tempura + fruit = my fave.\n\n3) The service, though sometimes slow, is always fantastic. The shy little girls who probably go to State are always very sweet and polite. And because my family and I come here so often (you'd think we have a tab here), the owner never fails to greet us, even if it is at the Balboa Bart Station.\n\n4) It's inexpensive. And as I mentioned earlier, now that I'm in New York, I know just how high people will rack up their prices, despite having only mediocre sushi.\n\nThe only downside (and deduction of a star) comes from the fact that parking is a pain, and the service can be slow on a hectic night.\n\nJeez I can't way to go home! ;)", "author": "Morgan Ashley C."}

Now with the not-so-great. The chicken karaaage had an aftertaste as if the chicken, batter or the oil used to deep-fry was old. It was also not authentic: the chicken is supposed to be marinated and then coated in potato starch (or substituted with cornstarch), not have a shell of wet batter (which means chicken dipped in egg wash and then floured). Upside: good amount of dark meat sans the fat. My mom got the bento box and there was something wrong with each item: the tempura batter was bland and underseasoned, and it didn't come with tempura sauce; used dry chicken breast for the teriyaki; beef teriyaki wasn't sliced thin and the meat tasted closer to a roast beef; and the broccoli, although still crunchy, was old and showed yellow sprouts. The dressing for their salad was weird -- it wasn't thousand-island style nor was it like a vinaigrette.

I proceeded to order 3 sushi rolls, miso soup, tonkatsu curry, and gyoza. I waited for an hour and 10 minutes before I realized the delivery was late.

The food arrived 2 hours and 16 minutes after ordering. The sushi was warm having been place under the miso soup, potstickers, and curry. The curry was cold and did not have the tonkatsu that was ordered  the pot stickers and the miso soup were cold as well. Apparently delivery took around 20 minutes because I contacted Eat24 to have them see where the food is. When eat 24 contacted me, they said the delivery had just left about 3-4 minutes before the 2 hour mark. Obviously, the restaurant manager is lying saying that the food had gone out almost an hour before. If it had, why was the sushi not packaged separately from the hot food? Why did the tell eat24 it left 20 minutes before it arrived to my place? How can a restaurant be satisfied sending out poorly prepared food like this?  I don't recommend this place. It's got tawdry customer service, poor food preparation/presentation, and just was utterly disappointing. The only bonus was that the restaurant credited me 30% of the order cost (roughly $19 for $30 in sushi).

The thing that piqued my interest most was the nigiri menu, because they sell singles as opposed to pairs of rolls.  This is good if you are on a budget or need a cheap lunch.  Most of them are $1.00 to $2.00, average $1.50.\n\nI had the nigiri combo (sushi combo E), though, as it had a good selection and i was in a hurry to get some sushi, and i also wanted the miso soup that comes with it.  It cost $8.95 for 8 pieces of nigiri and soup.\n\nMiso came quickly, was good.  The sushi came quickly as well, before i was done with my miso, even.  It was well worth the money.  The fish looks really fresh, and really nice cuts.  The rice is very well-made sushi rice.  The arrangment and plating were very simple, but the meal looked very appetizing, simple yet elegant. \n\nHot tea is complimentary, but as has been said before here, it is very, very bland.  It's essentially hot water with a tiny bit of flavor.  I don't really mind that though, just a minor drawback, since they also have a semi-full bar, with sake.\n\nI wish I could have had more to eat, as I LOVE sushi, but it was time for me to leave. \n\nThe interior is small, but doesn't feel crowded.  The waitresses are very good about not bothering you when you're eating, and coming quickly when you aren't eating.\n\nI will be going back here, as it is so close to where I live, and it has good food for a pretty good price.  Check it out.", "author": "David P."}

I love their fresh fish, this is so important to me because I usually only order sashimi and I like it to be fresh.  The rolls that my buddy orders are really  beautiful and she is always happy.  I think that the service is great and the prices are fair.  I like going here because it used to be a candy store when I was a kid growing up in this neighborhood and it just makes me happy that I am about to put something really good into my mouth.

The food on the other hand not so much and, I reluctantly have to agree with Nobu K's review. Japanese food is one type of food that one should be picky about due to the delicate and potentially dangerous outcome if not prepared properly! I had read Nobu's review but decided to try it anyhow as it is the closest Sushi restaurant in my area. On having read his review my fiance and I decided to opt for cooked options and both got bento boxes. Everything was wrong in the texture and flavor. What a dissapointment! The miso soup was off, the rice was soggy. My beef dish was a pile of thinly sliced fat. Our tempura was overcooked, soggy and the batter was obviously fried in dirty oil. The tempura sauce was overly salted and more like watery soy sauce. The chicken teriyaki was not grilled, it was obviously baked and the teriyaki sauce was watery. The teriyaki salmon was soggy as well, the salmon of poor farmed quality tasting muddy. Even the salad was soggy, the veggies old and the dressing simply thousand island. I will definitely not be going back to even give this place a second chance as, I repeat..... every single dish was off!!! Japanese food is one of my absolute favorite cuisines when prepared properly and this was absolutely not!!", "author": "Out O."}

Sadly, he never went there because he moved back to Boston soon after.\n\nThat was in spring of 2006 soon after they opened. I actually found out about Yama opening because I had a job working with a commercial corridor revitalization project on nearby Ocean Avenue. Residents that I knew in those neighborhoods told me how businesses at the corner where Yama is have always had trouble lasting very long and I'm really happy to hear that it's still around - and people spreading the good word is great. The corner is kind of an odd spot - technically it's the meeting point of 3 neighborhoods - Ingleside Terraces (west - more expensive), Ingleside (east - more towards middle class) and Merced Heights (south of Holloway).\n\nThe owner (Jeffrey - in the picture) is extremely nice and so is his staff. Jeffrey wouldn't have it any other way. \n\n've been there multiple times - it's always great. Simple ambiance with great food and extremely reasonable prices.", "author": "Emmet M."}

Because the nearest decent sushi restaurant is a 15min drive, whereas Yama Sushi is 1.5 blocks away.\n\nI've tried just about everything on their menu. They seem to use soy sauce in most of their dishes, including the sushi - I rarely taste authentic Japanese flavors. Their donburi and noodle soups are pretty much Chinese-style. The miso soup is bland. I would say the fish is fresh less than half the time.\n\nThe prices are average compared to other Japanese restaurants, but a bit high for the quality of food (I am willing to pay this slight premium because if offsets the time and gas I save going to better restaurant). Customer service is better than the typical Asian restaurant.", "author": "Ruth T."}

Probably the most disgusting sushi I have ever eaten. I couldn't make out what fish I was eating in most of the rolls. The salmon on the Volcano roll was almost all of the brown part of the salmon, you know, the fat/blood filled part. So disgusting. Don't eat here. Ever.

The only reason I signed up for a Yelp account is so that I could write a review for my favorite sushi restaurant. That restaurant is Yama Sushi. So yes, I am giving it 5 stars.\n\nWhy do I love Yama Sushi? Here are my top 10 reasons:\n\n1. Best and most fresh Hamachi Sashimi I have ever had. Seriously.\n2. Spicy Tuna hand roll. Oh. My. Awesome. (If you are feeling brave order our special little creation, The Scotty Roll - make sure you are hungry!)\n3. Some pretty sweet classic Chicago tunes playing in the background. \n4. We are on a first name basis with the owner, Jeff, who always greets us with a smile (maybe he is faking it, but we feel welcome). All the waitresses are very nice.\n5. They never judge us for coming in two days in a row. Or three.\n6. They never turn us away when we show up at 9:29 PM and they are closing at 9:30 PM.\n7. My cup of hot green tea never gets low.\n8. Baked Mussels appetizer. I'm drooling on my keyboard. Do it. You will thank me later.\n9. We can order fried prawn heads even though they are no longer on the menu.\n10. Affordable.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-08-29", "description": "Food is a little better than OK, prices reasonable, service absolutely adorable and attentive, and compared with the rest of the neighborhood this is the \"fancy\" restaurant. \n\nYama Sushi took over for a BBQ place that was in that space for years. I love soul food, and yet as much as I tried I could either never find the place open or it was open but looked sketchy and uninviting. The Yama mamas took over, painted it up and strung a bunch of knick-knacks around (including over the fire extinguisher!) and the place is really a happening joint now. I don't eat a lot of raw stuff, but the maki I've had has been very passable when the guy makes it, and a few notches down in size and taste when the new girl rolls. Bentos are usually generous portions and tasty enough - the sukiyaki is outstanding, fried stuff is edible but I recommend against it.\n\nThe servers are all cute, plentiful and friendly, well-skilled at refilling your green tea so that you can maintain the third-degree burn that you received on your first attempted sips. It's not one of the \"best\" Chinese-operated Japanese restaurants in the City if based purely on food quality - it probably bounces around \"average.\" But for the surrounding neighborhood choices, plus the attentive and friendly service the food becomes much more delicious and for that I am as generous with the stars as they are with their delightful miso soup.", "author": "Zen T."}

'Went there last night and it was obvious from the moment I walked in that something had changed.  The place looks run down, the floors needed a good wash & litter picked up, & dead flowers removed from the table.  They were heavily staffed with 6-7 people behind the counter but I was the only customer until half way thru my meal when someone else wandered in.  The food was a big disappointment.  The miso soup was lacking in taste, the bento box was sub-par, greasy tempura, odd tasting chicken teriyaki, sloppily made California rolls.  While I was having my dinner several of the staff were having theirs, standing behind the counter eating their bowls of soup ... very unprofessional.
