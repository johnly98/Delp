You will be asked by them if it's your first visit.  If so, they'll explain the ordering process to you.\n\n* Given its location at Mission and Spear, near many office buildings in the FiDi, the line is usually out the door around lunchtime.  Get here around 11:30 if you want to get in and out quickly.\n\n* After you place your order, you'll be given a pager which will go off once your order is ready.\n\nMy chocolate-dipped cone was excellent.  Definitely make sure to have plenty of napkins with you.  You'll thank me later.\n\nThe burger was, sadly, a little flavorless.  However, I'm willing to concede that I screwed up by ordering it well done (only did this because undercooked ground beef gives me an upset stomach) and because I ordered it without the eponymous super sauce.  Parts of the burger had burnt edges.  Next time, I won't make the same mistake.  The garlic fries were great.  I'd like to see Super Duper open up shop to sell garlic fries (and other stuff too) at AT&T Park.  They'd probably put the other places that sell garlic fries there out of business.\n\nThe pricing isn't the cheapest out there, but it's San Francisco.  Will I be back again?  I don't see why not.\n\n4 stars", "author": "Michael F."}

There's a sign outside that says \"5 to 8 minutes\" and I waited exactly 5 minutes. Maybe it would take 8 if there are only 2 registers open. Then you have to wait a few minutes while they cook your burger. That's a good thing. You know it was made fresh when you ordered it.\n3rd - I have to tell you about this Sir Kensington's ketchup. I order a side of fries every time because I love this ketchup. My grandmother was a big-time gardener and she cooked her own recipe of ketchup.

However we took a chance and im sure glad we did.   The place was packed even after the normal lunch hour.   We got there around 2 and still had to wait a bit in line.  They have wine and beer on tap at very reasonable prices.   Since I was on vacation i had a glass of Pinot Noir and it was good for its price.  The tap probably kept it fresh.   The burger is a smashed flat top style.  Crunchy outside and thinish.   Singles or doubles are avail.  As you can see by the picture I had a double.   I'm sure they use 80/20 or similar.  The burger was very juicy but in very good way that makes you use a napkin and keep diving in.  My son and I both agreed it was an excellent burger.  There are a ton of topping options.  We also combo'd our meal with fries.   The fries were very good as well.  Thicker than an In-N-Out but just as crunchy.   The ketchup and mustard tasted more homemade than from a commercial source.    Great tomato flavor that shined through.     \nAll in all- we will be back to SDB.

Still as good if not better than when I had them a long while back at Metreon's location.  I usually prefer to have my burgers medium rare but with Super Duper I'll make that exception.  It's amazing how juicy it is for a medium well burger.  Plus, their Parmesan garlic fries are still epic!\n\nIt's also been a great stop for breakfast.  I've had their Egg Sandwich twice, once with Bacon & Avocado (http://bit.ly/2f3428C), and once with Sausage (http://bit.ly/2IRsbj8).  Both are really solid sandwiches and very filling.

They're the perfect size and they have a great light crisp outside and soft chew inside which is expected since they're made hot and fresh.  They're just perfect!\n\nSo yeah!

Needing a quick dinner before a nearby event, it was a perfect time to check out this Super Duper.  This is a fairly large restaurant with many interior tables as well as a large patio.\n\nHamburgers come in a 4oz single patty or 8oz double patty with secret sauce. Cheese and bacon are additional cost add-ons.  For toppings, \"Everything on It\" includes lettuce, tomato and red onion. Additional free toppings include jalapenos, grilled onions and pickles. They do have chicken and vegetarian burgers and salads for non-beef eaters.  Combo specials are the Mini or Super which comes with fries and a fountain drink. \n\nWe got a single and a double burger with an order of fries. As stated on the menu \"Our burgers are cooked medium and are very juicy...could be messy business!!\"  Yes, the burgers were juicy or was it grease. The juice/grease from the burger made the wrapper a little wet. The beef is daily ground and 100% vegetarian fed. Grass fed beef does have a certain taste to it.  The all natural Kensington ketchup and mustard were self-serve and were nice quality. \n\nOverall, good burger burgers. But at $5.75 for a single and $8.25 for a double, they are pricey in comparison to two top burgers, In-N-Out and Habit. The fries were good, but the portion was small relative to the price.  \nBut I might be back for their Happy Hour of $15 for a pitcher of beer which comes with three orders of fries.", "author": "Al L."}

Cheese oozing out at every possible exit point. Damn right, that's a good burger.\n\nIn search of something to eat before going to the Exploratorium's After Dark event (a must if you're nerdy like us and dislike going to museums because of the unruly kids running around), we landed here. It wasn't too busy and we got our orders within 10 minutes, a real achievement at prime dinner time. \n\nMy significant other got a super burger combo with fries and a soft drink, while I got a four cheese super burger, resplendent with blue cheese, jack, cheddar, and aged white cheddar. Both burgers were immensely satisfying. Despite having smaller parties, both were juicy and the cheese incredibly melty. The four cheese burger in particular left cheese strings all over my face, and all four cheeses worked cohesively -- even the blue cheese, which I normally hate. They were happy to customize the veggies to our liking, too. \n\nThe patty was a smidge too soft. No crust formed, and while there was still some of that broiled flavor, it lacked the external structure to hold it all together. This was strange to me, since I thought their burgers were made on a flattop. If it had more of that char, this would certainly be a five-star review. Aside from this, though, everything was fresh and wonderfully prepared, from the romaine lettuce to the ooey-gooey cheese.\n\nOur extras, the fries and drink, were pretty good. They have that perfect fry in between shoestring and steak, for one. It was a little undersalted, but that was easily fixed. The ketchup here is from what seems like a third-party vendor, and has the texture of tomato pur\u00e9e, not Heinz. Also, is it just us, or does all Coke taste way better in a glass? Theirs certainly does.\n\nBring some wet wipes. I swear it took me a solid five minutes at a sink to scrub off all that delectable meat juice and grease.

I've tried their donuts in the morning, super duper burgers, fries, and milkshakes. \n\nOf course first I would say that their milkshakes are DELICIOUS. My favorite is the Cookies and cream one. They regular sizes are more than enough and their small sizes aren't satisfying enough. If only they could have an in between size, that would be perfect. I've also had the alcoholic milkshakes here before and they are basically milkshakes with soju. I thought it was good because it was unique to me but I didn't like that I couldn't taste that there was enough alcohol in there. The last time I've gone, they also included fries with a purchase of an alcoholic beverage so that was pretty cool! (Probably during their happy hour) \n\nBurgers. I got the super duper four cheese burger. HOLY MOLY that burger was way too much for me. It's 8oz if meat (two patties) and loaded with CHEESE. Don't get me wrong I LOVED everything about this burger but I felt like I was going to get a heart attack or something because 1. It was way too much food for me and 2. It was very oily. I would highly recommend getting a mini burger if you know you can't eat that much.. \n\nFries. Were great! Love all the different dipping sauces (additional $1.50 I think) but I'm biased because I love fries of all sorts! \n\nDonuts. I got it one morning with my coworkers and they sell three different flavors (chocolate, vanilla and plain/glazed?). These are mini donuts that are 3 for $2 I believe.

We decided to put some chipotle sauce on the salad to spice it up a little, but it still wasn't great. There was more lettuce than ingredients, and after awhile, only eating lettuce got tiring. We also decided to order the garlic fries because we were looking for something with a little flavor after our disappointing meal. This was instantly a huge regret. We ended up waiting another 10-15 minutes for fries, and when we finally got them, they were soaked in grease/oil from the cheese, that was melted on top.

But I got impatient at the slow moving line, peered into Super Duper Burger and was pleased to see that they served Chicken burgers as well. So I called the missus over and we both got chicken burgers with cheese. We ordered garlic fries as well to share and decided to stick to water.  \n\nIt's very apparent to me that SDB uses quality ingredients. The veggies like the tomatoes were fresh and tasty. I lifted the bun up and was pleased to see two nice and thin chicken pieces. Notice I didn't say patties. I was apprehensive that I'd get one of those Costco or Mega conglomerate Food service type chicken formed patty, but not so.\n\nThe taste?  Hmmm. I wasn't in love but I didn't hate it either. I thought the sauce didn't really enhance the flavor but kind of muddled it for me. The bun...not sure what it was but something along the lines of a ciabatta. My expectation was that they'd use their burger bun but that wasn't so. Maybe next time lll ask if they could do that for me. Which is to say I really didn't like the bun. But again, everything in between was pretty good. \n\nAs for the garlic fries, they were good but personally I think I am fine with just their regular fries. \n\nWe both agreed that we liked their burgers better and will probably stick with them next time.

The burger was okay: the meat patty had a juicy flavor and they also added a little bit of lettuce and tomatoes to go along with the meat and cheese. However it was a little tad too oily for my preference, the bun was not that memorable, and the portion size was quite small for the price (~$9). The side of fries (~$3) was okay but also not quite memorable.\n\nLocation of this branch is very convenient, about a block away from Embarcadero BART station.

You can't go wrong with Super Duper. \n\nFOOD (4/5) \nTheir veggie burgers are pretty big and filling. They have a really good combo of toppings, BUT you do have to add cheese (!!) and avocado for an extra price (and you definitely should as these make the burger infinitely better). In terms of the veggie patty, its not my favorite.. it has a lot of corn, sprouts and other different vegetables fused into the patty. However, I like that they are creative and make a pretty unique patty rather than the usual bean or portobello options. Also, it looks pretty healthy! Fries are very tasty too - not greasy at all and always taste fresh! \n\nDRINKS (5/5) \nGreat wine options, also have a selection of beers and normal fountain drinks, etc. Not a place to turn up... more to like casually enjoy a drink with your burger. \n\nICE CREAM (5/5) \nDon't leave without saving room for some soft serve!

For an additional $1.50, you can add Cambozola blue cheese to your burger here, but the last thing it will ever be is SAD!!\n\nHow do you make a hamburger laugh? PICKLE IT!! This place is known for having the most delicious (complimentary) pickles. Grab a few while you're near the drinks/condiments station to munch on while you wait for your food!!\n\nI can see why this chain is called Super Duper Burgers. IT'S SUPER DUPER!!\n\nWhat I've had:\n- Veggie burger ($6.75): The first time I had the veggie burger here, I REALLY didn't like it...by default, it comes with hummus, cucumber, and Super Sauce (a mayo-based sauce with other secret ingredients). I LOVE hummus, but idk it wasn't really doin' it for me on the burger. One day, I decided to give it another another chance. The second time, I got it without cucumber and hummus and added avocado ($1.25), roasted portobello ($1.25), and jack ($0.50) for an additional price. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY FRIGGIN DELICIOUUUS. BEST VEGGIE BURGER I'VE EVER HAD. I usually never really go for a veggie burger wherever I see it because more often than not, it resembles something you can find in the frozen food aisle of your neighborhood grocery store...BUT THIS. From the picture, you can see that it ain't your average veggie burger. You can taste the bits of vegetables in the patty, and overall, it tastes REAL\n\n- Garlic fries ($3.50): I am on a mission to find the best fries in the area, and so far, Super Duper is winning!! The garlic fries here are made using fresh garlic and 6-month aged cheddar. The texture is usually nice--crunchy on the outside but soft and mashed potato-like on the inside. They literally come loaded with a MOUNTAIN of cheese and the perfect amount of garlic sprinkled on top. There have been a few times when the fries seemed a little too burnt, but usually, that isn't the case\n\nBottom line: AHHH I LOVE YOU, SUPER DUPER!! Kinda pricy...but you can definitely taste the quality. The ketchup they have here ain't your average either, and they have pickles that people rave about!! I'm not the biggest pickle fan, so I'll let you decide for yourself on that...they have soft serve too AHHH!! If you're in the area and looking for a bougie burger that ain't so bougie that it's extra, head on over to Super Duper!! Your tastebuds will be elated", "author": "Kithumini J."}

The kid behind the counter asked if it was our first time, and when we told him it was at this location he welcomed us and told us where we can find the condiments. \n\nWe both ordered a mini burger. Like five guys, when you order a mini or \"little\" burger what they really mean is it's a normal burger with one patty. The super burger comes with two. I can get past the fact that they charge extra for cheese for two reasons: 1. The cheese is Cheddar, so it's good quality cheese, and 2. It's only an extra 50 cent charge, so it's nothing. The burger came out amazing. For fast food, it's amazing how juicy they can make these burgers, plus mine was a little pink in the middle (how I love it), so clearly the burgers are freshly made. \n\nWe split an order of garlic fries. The fries were crispy and seasoned well. But the garlic and the cheese that just envelops these fries is what it's really about. If you ever wanted to know what heaven smells and tastes like, this is it. \n\nAt the condiment station they have ketchup, mustard, etc., however, they also have homemade pickles.

I wish we had one of these places back home! It would be my go-to spot!

It's unsanitary, could eventually get someone sick, and the company doesn't seem to want to do anything about it. They allow pigeons to fly around the restaurant interior and even get close to the kitchen. All it would take would be someone at the door to shoo the pigeons away before they come in, but they don't seem willing to do that. (See reply below.) It's not rocket science. \n\nI'd hate for such a great restaurant to have a Chipotle moment, but they seem to be blindly heading in that direction.", "author": "Al S."}

Breakfast sandwiches, hash browns, donuts that are probably some of the best out there, annnnddd freshly made orange juice?! \n\nMy visit to SDB was the morning before SF Pride to fuel our tummies for a day of celebration, resistance, and a showing of love and equality. SDB sure did show us a good time before the parade! \n\nLet me take you for a trip down the menu of that day. It was booked for our Glamazon parade participants, so it was a limited menu that morning, but from what I sampled, they have definitely gained my future business.\n\nFirst off, those donuts are freakin' addicting! I had 2! Well, 2 and 1/2. That's a pretty big compliment considering I eat a donut maybe once a year, and it has to taste like a unicorn looks for me to fathom consuming all those sugary calories. Bravo and hat tip to the creator of that sugary beast of fried dough. Mmmm... Mmm... Mmm.\n\nNext up? Their take on an Egg McMuffin of sorts. I've never had a traditional one from McDonalds, but I know that they exist. This little sandwich was quite filling, and came with an egg, cheese, and avocado. Delicious. I will be back for you one day little sandwich. Hopefully sooner rather than later. They also have others that come with various meats, but I don't partake in those types of choices. \n\nLastly...The hash browns. Super fresh out of the fryer and pipping hot! Yes! Crispy delicious on the outside, and soft in the middle.  \n\nBeverages? I washed it all down with some freshly made orange juice. I don't even like pulp! I did that day since it was so good!\n\nOh and not only do they know how to make some good grub, they employ some pretty nice people. Super sweet service. \n\nAlthough this was a pre-fixed menu for our Glamazon group, I did notice that they have quite the selection of menu items. Many options besides just breakfast selections. \n\nThank you Super Duper for making our Pride morning go so smoothly, and not leaving our tummies growling. You have gained at least two more loyal customers, that cannot wait to sample some more of what you have to offer.", "author": "Alexandra F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-12-26", "description": "This Super Duper Burger on Mission in the Financial District is an establishment that manages to be at once comforting and 'trendy'.  The comfort is in the lay-out and the food: delicious hamburgers, veggie burgers and chicken sandwiches (not as good as the burgers) served with fountain drinks, shakes, french fries, salads and/or beer.\n\nYou enter and are directly in queue for the register, where you order from a wide menu above while a cashier walks you through the process step-by-step with an impressively authentic level of enthusiasm.  You are given a drink and a buzzer to notify you when your food is ready for pick-up.\n\nIn this sense, Super Duper is a classic burger joint.\n\nHowever, the aesthetic is a bit different.  Solid plank tables and counters of polished wood adorn the interior dining room.  An enormous wooden effigy in the form of a bovine silhouette dominates a wall, paying homage to Super Duper's most beloved ingredient: tender beef patties.  Extensive outdoor seating is available and channels the atmosphere of a German biergarten, despite being at a busy intersection and under frequent assault by those charity-seeking San Francisco flying rats, also known as pigeons.  \n\nThe only downside of the design is that there are no restrooms.\n\nThe common thread between the cuisine and the atmosphere is refined casual simplicity.  It's classic at heart, but classier and trendier than most traditional burger havens.\n\nYour buzzer chimes and you get your food with the herd from an expo counter that faces the main dining floor and provides a glimpse into the kitchen.  After you receive your victuals on a tray, you may choose to stop by the condiment counter and soda station.  The unique touch here is the jar of complimentary sliced pickles and Super Duper's ketchup, which is more thick and tomato-y than traditional Heinz.\n\nI got a mini burger (4 oz of beef) with lettuce, tomato, grilled onion and super sauce (their take on 1000 island, I believe), as well as a Racer 5 and a side of fries.  The burger was fantastic; meatier and heftier than your average In-N-Out burger.  The patties are cooked thoroughly, but retain a soft buttery texture.  The produce is fresh and tasty.  Although it's not fresh-off-the-vine bursting with flavor, it's leagues better than the watery, lifeless, nearly colorless toms you often get at a greasy diner.   Kudos to the whole wheat bun as well, which is sturdy and courser than your usual burger bun.\n\nOverall, it was everything I want from a quick burger.\n\nThe fries are good, but not extraordinary.  They are somewhere in between soft and crispy.  Again, I was reminded of In-N-Out, who's fries I don't much care for unless they are buried under a heaping pile of special sauce and grilled onions, which I don't think is an option here.  Honestly, Super Duper's fries (plain) are a step above, having more flavor and body than those of the California classic.  The ketchup might not do it for some people, but I didn't mind it.\n\nOverall, this Super Duper is solid.  The cuisine is classic but higher quality, and the atmosphere is simplistic and comfortable.  I recommend Super Duper to anyone who is downtown and craving simple, classic fare.  They make a damn good burger and it's a good location for either solo-dining or a casual lunch meeting.  The service was friendly, fast and professional. \n\nPlaces like Super Duper aren't going to revolutionize your palate, but they hold down and even slightly elevate an American culinary standard.", "author": "Max T."}

It's screams fun and satisfying. \"Let's all go to Super Duper Burger\" \nI was strolling through SF on an 80 degree Saturday, and the kids were starting to get hangry. \nThe menu had various sandwich options and veggies burgers too. \nSuper Duper Burger began to get popular as we waited for our food, but the line moved quickly. \nMy hatchlings (along with my Super Duper Husband) had the mini burgers - plain. \nThey thoroughly enjoyed them. My husband said the seasoning on the burgers was quite tasty. The buns were toasty and also got 10 thumbs up from the crew. They complimented the fries as well. Speaking of fries- the man one table over from us had garlic fries, they looked so scrumptious. They had parsley and aged cheddar melted on top. They looked like golden garlic fry perfection, I had serious fry envy. I snapped a pic,for your viewing enjoyment, while he was looking away. \nI wasn't hungry, so I just had some of their pickles. They were spicy and reminiscent of the pickles that my Grandma used to make in her cellar. Meaning- those are some delicious pickles! \nI heard the woman behind me us say \"Holy Crap this is delicious\" that's an exact quote. She was eating a chicken sandwich. Good to know :)\nThe staff were friendly, they came around sweeping also collecting trash, trays, etc. and kept the outdoor area nice and tidy. There is an awning and umbrellas, to provide shade- thanks. The bright orange color impressed my little people. It was pretty warm inside, so the outdoor seating was a far more comfortable option. \nI definitely recommend giving Super Duper Burger a go. One warning: the outdoor benches are very lightweight, and they will tip if you sit on the far end of one. Our daughter is a super lightweight and she accidentally tipped it like a teeter totter! \nI hope you Super Duper like this place as much as we did.\nThe ice cream looks like a whole lot of cool and creamy delightfulness- I don't care if that's even a word. I totally want some.", "author": "Kimberly T."}

I don't often eat beef, so I found the reviews very compelling. \n\nI ordered the mini-burger with all the usual fixings, plus an egg and bacon. Also a freshly made order of fries and fresh lemonade. Overall, I was most satisfied with the burger. It was juicy, hot and had just the right amount of secret sauce. Though I did add some ketchup. The bun was toasted just right and didn't taste like something overly processed you'd purchase in a 7-eleven :-0\n\nSadly, my fries were warm, not hot and crisp. I tried adding salt, pepper and ketchup to them, but it was already too late to bring them back to life. So I only ate a few.\n\nSurprisingly the \"naturally sweetened\" lemonade was not bad. Not as sweet as I'd like, but not sour either. It was a good alternative to the fountain soda. Kudos to S-D for that option.\n\nPros:\n- quick service\n- easy to understand menu\n- pretty fast turn-around of the food\n- good fast-casual option in the Mission District\n\nCons:\n- the fries may be hit or miss, so I'd suggest tasting them ASAP to determine whether they make the grade", "author": "J W."}

We had our heart set on Super Duper, but thought it was only near the Metreon and on Market. Turns out there are *four* lovely downtown locations for burger goodness, and this one is a special gem. Aside from being super-close to the Embarcadero, there is easily double the seating of other locations, both indoors and outdoors. On a lovely spring night, it's hard to beat chilling outside with a beer and a Jenga tower. They keep baskets of the blocks on most tables, and it's a great time-kill while you wait for them to page you for your order. \n\nThe folks working here are super-friendly, and the line was non-existent. Those of you who try to maintain a healthy diet during the work week, take note. ;-) \n\nFrom M-F until 7 pm, a $15 pitcher (or any alcohol purchase) gets you free fries! Even garlic fries! This is a great place to start a mid-week bar crawl, or to simply park yourself for an hour or so as you enjoy their incredible Burgers and Chicken Sandwiches ($7.50 / $8 with cheese). I can't get past the chipotle sauce on those - lots of subtle, wonderful heat. Load up on the free pickles! \n\nIf there must be a flaw, it's that there is no on-premise bathroom, which is definitely a bummer. We were told \"it's a bit of a trip\" to get to, so we just ended up heading back to the Ferry Building. Oh wells. Also, there are several intrepid pigeons who will think nothing of lunging at your fries while you're actively eating them. Clapping and yelling will only make you look like an idiot. If this bothers you, best to sit inside. \n\nAll said, this is a great stop, especially if you're looking to save some coin and recover from the sticker shock of Gott's.

I didn't want to leave a bad review, but this place have the worst customer service. \n\nIt was my first time here. It was a Saturday, so I'm not sure if Saturdays are more chilled and relaxed for the workers here. They seemed to not care at all. The place wasn't really busy; they had a few people dinning there. I ordered a burger to go and it took about 25mins. JUST for 1 Burger! No fries, no shake, no extra item. I went to the condiment bar 3x to get pickles while I was waiting for my burger. \n\nI can see the cooks from where I was waiting and one guy kept looking up and smiling at me and laughing with his co-workers. I was getting annoyed because I had to be somewhere at a certain time and I couldn't believe why it was taking so long to make my order. A customer came in 15mins. later and her order was up before mine. ??!! Wow...\n\nWhile I was waiting, I saw the cashier go and clean underneath the condiment bar and went back to the register without washing his hands. He was on the floor cleaning Underneath the soda station. And I also saw the guy behind the counter who calls out the order and gives you your food, wipe his nose with a napkin and Didn't wash his hands after. SMH....\n\nI heard a customer asked for a restroom and one of the workers said they didn't have one. So she told her friend that she needed to go across the street to Walgreens. Wow!! Again! For a place this big and in This location, I Really think they need to have a restroom. \n\nAfter 25mins. and 3 servings of the pickles, I finally got my order. I left and halfway to my destination, I noticed there was No bacon on my burger. I paid an extra $1.50 for the bacon, and it was not in the burger.

(We're located Downtown.) That is, until they called the location on Mission at Spear. On Thursday, March 17th, we order lunch for pick up to celebrate St Patrick's Day.\n\nSince I'm not eating red meat for a while, I got the Chicken Sandwich: 100% natural free range chicken breast with chipotle aioli with with all The Free Stuff: Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onions, Jalape\u00f1os, Grilled Onions and Housemade Pickles ($7.50), add Jack cheese (+$0.50), Roasted Portabello (+$1) and Organic Egg (+$1.50). I love Super Duper's burgers, but I can't say I feel the same about their chicken sandwich. The chicken was dry instead of being moist and tender. It may have suffered a bit from transit as the cheese had also hardened and the egg didn't provide the soft runny yolk I love. The pickles don't actually come in the burger, but Super Duper was nice enough to pack a to go container filled with pickles on the side.\n\nI did love the Garlic Fries: Fresh garlic & 6-month aged cheddar ($3.25) as usual. Though they did get a little soft and soggy in transit, I loved the garlicky and cheesy flavor. I decided to add Three Dips: Super Sauce, Housemade Mayo, Chipotle (+$1.50), but that may have been too much as the dips are very creamy and I believe mayo based. A touch of ketchup seemed to cut into the garlic fries better.\n\nI'm so glad this Super Duper was able to accommodate our big office order, but I found myself wishing I had ordered a burger instead of a chicken sandwich.

The kids size for the shake was so cute too! \nI realized that they make FRESH mini donuts in the AM so I knew I had to visit again. I came back the next week and ordered 3 donuts (vanilla, chocolate and cinnamon sugar) and a sausage, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. The sandwich wasn't too oily and it was made to order. The donuts were a perfect size too! They were definitely not mini, maybe like a medium. So not too big and not too small. You can't beat 3 donuts for $2 though! \nA week after my coworker brought in a dozen donuts and I was not mad about it =))", "author": "Nari M."}

Once on line, I saw the manager come out with french fry samplers for those waiting in line - wow! you just don't expect that level of consideration and service at a fast food chain. \n\nFurther down the line they had a small post sign that gave you an estimated wait time to order at that point - nice touch. They're pretty efficient as it didn't turn out to be too bad of a wait even with all the people. Once at the register - they were quick with the order and offered me water while I waited for my to-go order without me even asking. The orders also came out fairly quick - whatever they're doing works - they got a good system going on. \n\nFood wise - the garlic fries ($3.25) are amazing. The burger is pretty good for the value ($5.50 small) but mine came out a bit dry. Perhaps it was b/c of the lunch rush. The homemade pickles are ok - I liked that it had a kick to it but I prefer sweeter pickles - this was pretty salty. \n\nOverall great experience - highly recommend if you're looking for a casual lunch/ burger joint in FiDi.

Actually, might even be my favorite compared to traditional restaurants too.  Their burgers are delish and filling and reasonably priced (for San Francisco).\n\nSausage, Egg, Cheese Breakfast Sandwich: Like a fancy and tastier version of the McMuffin.  Since their burgers are amazing, you can imagine how good their ground sausage patties must be.  The eggs are somewhere between a scramble and an omelette with many thin layers folded on top of each other in a nice square.  They put real cheddar cheese on *both* sides of the bread!  And their English muffin tastes fresh... though I do wish they'd toast it a bit.\n\nSuper Burger w/ Cheese: Better than In-N-Out.  Umami Burger offers more complexity, but Super Duper has a classic taste in a good portion.  Though, ultimately I prefer a Shack Stack (from Shake Shack) over this.. but that is not an option in this city.  Something about the sear of the burger patty that just tastes awesome, even on the section that isn't covered by fixings.\n\nFrench Fries: Decent.  Some are crispy and some are limp.  Better to have decent fries than no fries I suppose.  It pains me to say it, but few trump McDonald's fries.\n\nPickles: Yas!  I love me some fresh sour pickles (...sorry nasty bread & butter).  I find that a bite of pickle after each bite of burger is a perfect way to keep my mouth from going into greasy overload.  It's like the pickled ginger to my sushi, helps cleanse my palate so I can appreciate each mouthful of burger.", "author": "Adam B."}

Absolutely love their burger with super sauce. My go-to meal? Mini burger with garlic fries. The garlic fries and be a hit or an almost-hit. They sometimes go a little bit overboard with the garlic sauce and the fries has a garlic-spicy taste. But most of the time, they're very excellent. They got great proportions on their burger, just the right amount of meat to bread. Not a huge lettuce fan, so I usually just get mine with cheese, super sauce, and tomato:) Their chicken sandwich is also very excellent, but the burger is my go-to.\nIf you're feeling extra hungry, they also serve amazing milkshake and ice cream.

Nonetheless, they take orders pretty quickly, and you can get through the line in about 15 minutes. \n\nI ordered the mini burger, which is just under $5, and I added an egg (they cook it sunny-side up) for an additional $1.50. I also couldn't resist an order of fries for $2.25. Even though I came during prime lunch hour, it only took about 10 minutes to receive my food. My burger, with egg yolk running down the sides, was juicy and delicious without being overly greasy. Next time, though, I'll skip the egg; besides the extra wetness it gives the burger, I can't actually taste the egg. The fries were comparable to In-N-Out's fries in terms of texture, as it's on the softer side, but they are a little larger/fatter.\n\nOverall, Super Duper is one of the better chain burger joints.

A burger and fries will set you back about $10 which seems like a pretty good price in the FIDI. I get the mini burger (one patty) and ask them to put on grilled onions and jalape\u00f1os. I also always get the garlic fries which come sprinkled with a LOT of mild garlic, parsley, and cheese. I wish the burger was a little bit less wet/greasy and it would be nice if the fries were a little more crisp, but they're both delicious. If you come during their happy hour, (4-7 pm on weekdays and ALL DAY Saturday) I think beer and wine is something like $5 and you get fries thrown in for free? If you're paleo or low carb, you can also order the burger without the bun and they will carefully wrap it in huge, fresh leaves of lettuce (no pre shredded crap here).", "author": "Cat M."}

Super Duper makes the kind of burgers that you don't hate yourself after inhaling because they use such fresh ingredients. On top of that, you can go all out and add an egg, avocado, and all the works, while grabbing as many freshly homemade pickles as you can possibly handle. Ugh I die. Garlic fries are a good share item - while the garlic/cheese ratio is pretty solid, but sometimes the cheese clumps up on the top. \n\nTIPS: This place can get crowded especially during weekdays around lunch time.

I had the veggie burger with avocado, pickles, and fries.

However, I do enjoy the food, which is why I still eat here every so often. Sometimes they have free deals and if you're one of the lucky visitors who get there early, you'll get whatever free food they're offering. Recently, I got to enjoy a free mini cheeseburger, fries, drink, and soft serve cone. The burgers are cooked well (not well-done), though sometimes can be on the greasy side. There's various locations all around San Francisco, so take your pick. I've been to the one on Market, which can get crowded (and seemed to be the most greasy). The location near Metreon isn't too bad, but I think so far I like the Financial District location best (by Spear Street) as there are plenty of seats and usually isn't packed.", "author": "Becky C."}

It's not quite at 5-star level, though.\n\nWhat is it like?  Not too bad, one of the better burgers.  The meat is cooked well (actually medium well).  You can get either 1/4 pound for regular-sized stomachs, or 1/2 pound for big tanks.\n\nThis is a great choice for cubedwellers.  It's just south of Market, so it's good for lunch hour, although it's a longer walk if you work near Montgomery Street.  A few places to stand and eat, outside tables are an option.\n\nMy story:  I'm no longer a cubedweller in the Financial District.  But we were going to a book signing at the Ferry Building, and I had a hunch that the line would be long (It took us 3 HOURS from getting in line to getting Nerdy Nummy Ro Pansino's pic and signature), so I was looking for some place, ANY place, to get good inexpensive food at night.  I knew the pickings would be slim, I didn't realize how slim they were.  Super Duper Burger was one of only six kid-friendly places within four blocks that was open past 5pm.  It was only a three-block walk for me and the 8-year-old, the hunny held our place in line.  The girl and I both got 1/4 pounders with cheese, I included bacon, and we ordered a chicken sandwich with jack cheese for the hunny.  I thought it would be Monterey Jack, but it was Pepper Jack;  my wife doesn't handle hot food well.  But we ate while waiting in line, we all got all of our food down, and were all pleased with what we had.  If we had time to sit down and eat, Super Duper Burger is a clean, well-lighted place for burgers - and it's open after the offices close down and the parking meters stop working.  Friendly staff that's good with kids.\n\nI'm sure there are better burgers in the Financial District;  I've had better burgers before.  I remember one in the food court below Nordstrom that was better, albeit more pricey.  But you can certainly do worse.  Again, Super Duper is not a 5-star burger, but a solid 4;  great eats for such a hokey name.", "author": "Ron L."}

They were very nice though and gave out samples of french fries and one of their dips to patient customers waiting in line.\n\nI think I liked Super Duper more the first few times I've had it.  They still cook a great burger for the price and their fries are spot on too.  I didn't have to wait that long for my burger and fries to go after placing the order.  I felt that the burger was a little dry until the last 3 or 4 bites though.  The fries were still just as crispy and seasoned perfectly.  \n\nFor the most part the Super Duper chain remains consistent cranking out good food at great prices.  The portions are generous too!

My coworker mentioned that she'd heard they had a breakfast sandwich meal deal with a mini donut and a coffee. Hmm sounded appealing so I made my way through the streets peeking my head in to a few of the dozens of available breakfast choices along my walk. Coffee Roastery looked ok but was gonna be $11 with coffee, Sweet Joanna's didn't entice me, Working Girls cafe was busy, put it on my list. Stopped in Rincon Place and stark Eatsa was empty for their new breakfast offering and the Taqueria inside had very poor breakfast burrito offerings. I had now made it through the gauntlet of choices and wasn't enticed enough to be diverted from Super Duper. it was 8:45 and their large patio glowed orange in the warm morning sun! Despite being surrounded by skyscrapers in the cold SOMA streets, Heaven's Halo was shining down warming up this burger joint! \n\nThe Food- I walk inside to a moderate crowd eating and no line. I see a large sign promoting the breakfast special my coworker had mentioned. \" Organic Egg Breakfast Sandwich -  Donut - 4 Barrel Coffee- $6\" This seemed like a great deal! You can add cheese for $.50 and/or Sausage for Bacon is $1. i promptly ordered, but the cashier informed me that the sign was outdated and the price had changed..... now the special meal deal was $5.50! I was the definition of a Happy Camper. Max the cashier was super sweet and friendly, extremely rare service in this neighborhood of high volume food service. They give you a buzzer, so I took the 3-4 minutes of waiting to soak in some sun their Heaven's Halo patio. I forgot I had put the vibrating buzzer in my pocket and when that thing vibrated I was pleasantly startled. I walked up and the young girl handed my my bag with the biggest smile and said \"enjoy your food Giovanni\". \n\nConsumption- I'll keep this paragraph short and sweet. Four Barrel coffee was nutty and had a slight bitter but pleasant bite. Donut was not mini, I'd say 3/4 scale and super delicious. Chose the glazed and the glaze was perfect not runny, hard or sticky. The donut was light not chewey or cakey. It was perhaps the best donut I've , no exaggeration. The breakfast sandwich was on a soft moist english muffin. I had the very tasty sausage and it wasn't salty and the egg was cooked to perfection. 5 Super Duper Gold Star breakfast!", "author": "Gio D."}

I came here looking for some sweet potato fries only to find out they did not have any. \"Okay, cool,\" I thought. I love all strains of the potato, so I decided to go with their garlic fries. \n\n\"Cheese, garlic, french fries, and parsley. How can I go wrong with that?\", I thought.\n\nI kid you not, after about 45 seconds after I took a seat upon paying, my order was complete; out and ready to be consumed as indicated by the employee yelling half way across the restaurant.\n \nReferencing to the opening line of my review, this place ain't shit. They are incapable of even frying French fries. My French fries came out heavy and soggy. They tasted as if they had recently been thawed and immersed into the deep fryer. Personally, I like my fries crisp. I like them light and airy, to which this establishment failed to meet, tremendously. You can do better, Super Duper Burger. Try for making them in house, or switching up the technique or timing. Actually immerse the potatoes into the frier upon, you know, receiving the order. If it takes an extra five minutes to issue them, so be it. Don't compromise speed for quality and taste. \n\nThough I did not have the opportunity to be be disappointed by their alleged \"super duper\" burger, I can sure as hell tell you I won't be so much as paying them a visit next time I'm up in Northern California, because what's a \"super duper\" burger without an equally pairing side of potatoes?\n\nIt ain't shit, that's what.

The cashier didn't deduct for the happy hour special and when we asked, she insisted that it's already deducted. Sorry not sorry but you're wrong, lady. You deducted one HH special, not both. And I have the receipt to prove it.\n\nThere's no bathroom here either but they have moist towelettes if you ask. The bathroom is part of the shared building and if you come here after building hours, you need to get the key card and walk half a block to get to the door and find the bathroom in there. Meh.\n\nAnd there's only 2 beers on tap: IPA and Pilsner. So yeah, sure, this Super Duper has the HH special too but no bathroom and limited beer choices steer me away.

I ordered the Super Duper with cheese and everything on it (lettuce, tomato, super sauce, onion) and even the bun tastes good. That's saying a lot for someone who usually orders protein style at In-and-Out.  The double patties are juicy and beefy, which sounds silly, but they smell good and you can tell they use good beef. Cheese isn't too salty and the vegetables are fresh. Add a little ketchup and I'm a happy camper. Soft serve is also rich and delicious. I work a few blocks from here and the cone doesn't make it back into the office!\n\nI've also tried a couple breakfast items here. The egg sandwich is a little small but I like how they fold the cheese into the egg so it's part of the egg. I've also had it where the cheese is just layered on top of the egg, but I prefer the other way better. Bacon is nice and crispy, but not too dry or burnt. Their donuts are just okay - a little too dense for my liking (I'm a Krispy Kreme girl all the way). I was happy to receive one of their free coffee with purchase cards but I just can't get behind Four Barrel coffee, which is way too sour/acidic for me.

I always get a super burger with everything, grilled onions, super sauce, a sunny-side egg.  Sometimes I'll get a milkshake.  Sometimes I'll get fries.  Sometimes I'll get pickles.  Sometimes I'll get a 2nd burger.  Whatever I choose, I always come away satiated.\n\nSure, the wait can be long - 15-20 min is pretty long for a burger + fries, but it's still much better than waiting 3 hours for, say, a street food ramen festival.  There's no bathroom, which can be annoying, but it hasn't affected the taste of my food yet.  Overall, I will happily come back again for their juicy, happy (the sauce comes in a happy face) burgers.", "author": "Josh Q."}

I travel frequently and often enjoy watching how businesses operate. I can think of three times in the last decade when I've come across someone who made me think, \"I would hire that person for anything.\" I thought that this evening at--of all places--Super Duper Burger in San Francisco. I needed a quick and inexpensive bite, they were open late-ish, and I was surprised to see that they had something from Bear Republic (a favorite brewery) on tap. Sold! I enjoyed the beer. my veggie-burger-with-everything, and some nicely-done, house-made pickles. What really struck me was the fantastic person who took my order and made the quick meal memorable. As I sat in the corner and watched the evening crowd, I noticed the person who took my order did something similar with everyone else who streamed in: she looked people in the eye, had tremendous energy, and sent everyone to the pickup counter with a huge smile--over and over . . . when she wasn't zipping around attending to other details. She checked out for the evening just before I left. When I exited, I mentioned to the manager what I had observed, and she said, \"That's Tashia! She is fantastic. Mention something on Yelp.\" So . . . here I am. In any role, in any profession, it can be difficult to fine someone who cares and to makes a difference. Tashia is one of those people, and she is hiding out at Super Duper Burger. Employers of San Francisco: your best potential people are not always the one currently eating your free snacks in the third-floor lounge or loudly ordering martinis after work. I sat next to some of them this evening before heading to the real world at Super Duper Burger. It turn out to be the biggest flameout ever, but I would place a very large bet that Tashia is that person who not only needs her next big break, but who would also help you make that same strong impression. Apologies for the weirdest restaurant review ever, but . . . wow. Don't overlook the unlikely places. Don't discount the people behind the counter. There's some latent talent out there ready to break out.", "author": "Paul G."}

On the way out to the bathroom my buzzer went off and upon  completing the bathroom journey I returned to a lukewarm burger.  The cashier had forgotten to ask me if I wanted fries too which I did.  \nThey advertise that they cook the meat to a well done level but my burger was totally pink in the middle, definitely like a medium tops which I don't care for.  However I was hungry and ate it and it was just ok.  Definitely not better than others this time around.  \nI'll give them another try seeking that first delicious burger and hopefully they will come through.  \nThe restaurant however is beautiful with floor to ceiling windows all the way around and beautiful decor but I don't get the higher height of some of the tables(chest level)!\nSuper Duper, you have a good thing going.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-22", "description": "I'd never eaten or been to Super Duper before, smelled other people's take out from there (and drooled; people ought to be a little more considerate by  NOT bringing deliciously aromatic food onto a bus or train unless they are going to share with everyone) so it was someplace I knew I needed to get to someday.  I'd only discovered this shop by accident while continuing on my #6 bus which has been detoured while they fix Spear St.  Saw it through the windows but never stopped in.  One excessively stressful and hectic Thurs, I fled out for a late lunch at 4-something and was walking around, decided to see what 1 Market Plaza had now since I hadn't been inside for years now, found you can't walk through the lobby from Market to Mission (at least not right now while they too do some construction stuff in there) so had to walk allthewayaroundthewholebuilding and since that ticked me off so much, I decided now was the time to stop for a burger.  First, there is way too much on the wall menu to be able to figure out what to eat, I don't even think I got beyond the milkshake list.  Oh, there was no line and only maybe 5 tables of people already eating so I'd probably avoid this place at the high noon lunch hours when most offices let their peons out to feed.  I was lucky that the guy taking orders guided me very nicely through.  I'd have loved to have breakfast (love breakfast) but figured since I still had to go back to work and put in another 5 hours of work and then it's a 1.5 hour ride home, I needed more sustenance so a mini bacon & cheese burger (which is actually a regular sized burger with 1 patty--normal for a lot of us but I suppose in these days of supersizing everything, it may be considered a \"mini\") with the works, side of fries.  Those alone cost over $10 when you add on tax.  And I got some of their pickles.  My review:  burger was delicious, had that nice flavorful greasy that makes all the difference (yea, I noticed this years ago when my doctor said I needed to stop using 85% ground beef and buy the 95% instead, might be less saturated fat but the flavor also diminished; my solution is to buy the 85% but just eat it far less frequently, I mean, why bother eating if the food doesn't taste like anything).  It was just the right size for me too (I have no idea how much \"bigger\" a super burger is there but I'll see next time I go, even if I can't eat it all; it's nice to have enough money to experiment like this and I shall miss it when I retire).  Fries were delicious too and they don't give you too many, just enough.  Pickles were awful, too sweet or they tried to combine kosher with garlic  with sweet pickles and it just didn't work, flavors were conflicting so after one bite, I dumped the rest.  Next time I go (which may be tomorrow), I'm getting the bigger burger, fries, and a strawberry shake (I just want a sip or two, can't handle much more before my gut begins to churn but I just need to taste it, I'll give the rest to one of the boy at work).  And someday I'll stop in for eggs--I wonder if they'll put a fried egg on a burger (one of my favor eats, burger, egg, bacon, cheese; it's like the perfect breakfast sandwich).  This place is smack in an area that is basically populated by businesses; after hours and weekends it's REAL dead (who wants to be downtown on a weekend working if you can possibly avoid it) so I'm a bit impressed they even open on weekends.  Most eateries down that way tend to open at about 10:30a and close by 3p on a workday, don't bother opening on weekends at all.  I've had burgers at Ziggy's and Bistro Burger and Buckhorn and at the Hyatts and at a few other places and although most of them are good, Super Duper out does them all (must be the grease, grease is the word).", "author": "Kai T."}

It was really good. Ordered the mini burger with cheese, bacon, grilled onion and avocado. And to be clear, their mini burger is not small! Hubby got the super burger (which has 2 patties) with bacon and blue cheese. He absolutely loved it. We also ordered the garlic fries to share. I'm usually a little hesitant ordering this coz usually it's just too garlicky... But on the menu it said something about some aged cheese on it.. So I was sold... The cheese made it so good! Next time I'd want to try the milkshakes especially the fresh strawberry one. I'm giving it 4 stars because it's not necessarily the best burgers I've had but in this neighborhood... Nothing is ever open on weekends let alone a Sunday night. I took out a star coz I think it's pretty expensive for a semi-fast food chain... It's not a fancy place. It's no mcdonalds but it's also not a Hubert Keller burger bar. More like in & out but more expensive. For example their milkshakes start at $4+. But with that said, their burgers are good, they're a block from my place and their open on weekends... I'd come back!", "author": "Cherry S."}
