My friend and I tried the coconut egg puff and lemon sugar crepe. \n\nThe coconut egg puff had the perfect amount of coconut flavor and coconut bits. It was subtly sweet.\n\nThe simple lemon sugar crepe was not what we were expecting. We thought it would be a smear of lemon reduction or jam, but I think it was literally lemon juice dusted with powered sugar. We made a mistake. The flavors did not go well together at all. The crepe itself was okay. It was a little thicker and not like other Japanese crepes I've eaten before.\n\nI'd probably stick to the egg puffs and try one of their over the top crepes next time.\n\nThe convenience store sells a bunch of Asian (Japanese, Thai, Chinese) snacks too!", "author": "Marilyn T."}

The green tea ice cream was creamy and authentic-tasting; and I liked how they layered the red bean paste within the folds of the crepe.

The warmth and crunchiness of the crepe complimented the coolness and smoothness of the ice cream well. \n\nLet's talk about the location. It's near a bunch of great restaurants and a farmer's market was wrapping up when we stopped by on Sunday. Perhaps a bit ambitious, but my fam and I walked to the Conservatory of Flowers after stuffing ourselves with crepes. If I'm ever in the area again, I definitely plan to try one of their fruit crepes! The only downside is their ambiance.

My point being, the crepe was fresh, not dry nor too crispy, the vanilla ice cream was creamy and not too icy, and the strawberries were freshly cut; All of which produced a product that screams I will come back for more.\n\nYou order and pay at the front counter and immediately adjacent, is the kitchen counter where they grill your crepe, slice, dice, and assemble your order.

If you been to Tokyo, this place is better than the crepe places in Harajuku. Seriously!!! \n\nWhat makes Genki Crepes better than Japan? Well the crepe is hands down better. It has a light vanilla taste and slightly crispy and crunchy.  The japanese crepes in Japan are flaccid and soggy.  Dessert crepes in generally should be slightly crispy in my opinion. Why? well if you slathered a soft steamy crepe with nutella, ice cream and fruit, it will just melt into a nasty, soggy mess.  The slightly crisped crepe seals in the moist ingredients while providing a wonderful contrast in aromas, flavors and textures.  This why Genki is superior to most other Japanese crepes out there.

Be prepared to circle around for a little before being able to find parking (giving 1 less star for this). \n\nAt first, I thought this place was overhyped, but after trying it, it definitely lives up to it! Not what you would imagine traditional crepes to be since this one comes super crispy & wrapped around an ice cream flavor of your choice + 1 free topping. I got the vanilla ice cream with strawberries which is so basic but honestly, paired really well with the crepe. The combination of the subtle sweetness of the vanilla ice cream, tartiness of the strawberries, & crunch/texture from the crepe is heavenly. My friend got the green tea w/ cheesecake bites which was really good as well! The cheesecake bites were actually decently-sized. They accept card but only for minimum purchases of $10.

My crepe consisted of matcha ice cream (always my go-to), lychee, and whip cream. They have their crepes on lock - it is light, soft, a little chewy but still has a crunch to it. My ideal crepe for sure! I also had a few egg puff pieces from my friend. You can't go wrong with that choice either. So, sooo good! \n\nAlways worth the trip to Inner Richmond for this.", "author": "Emily M."}

You can see them make the crepe fresh right in front of you which is cool too.

I'm always down for dessert so I was quite excited to try it! I didn't quite know what to expect when we arrived at what appeared to be a small convenience store/supermarket but from the long line that was formed inside, I could tell it was definitely a local hot spot! \n\nThe store sells lots of Japanese/Asian snacks and miscellaneous things like beauty products and cute Pop! figures etc. It was fun to browse them while you're in line! The smell of the freshly made crepes was very distracting though, and I spent most of my time trying to choose the type of crepe I wanted! They have sweet ice cream crepes, savory crepes, and snack crepes. Our group tried their ice cream crepes, which are available in pre-fixed fruit and ice cream combinations and customizable. Friends had the red bean ice cream crepe with banana, and the vanilla ice cream crepe with Nutella and banana. \n\nI had a strawberry ice cream crepe with Nutella and banana (I'm a sucker for Neapolitan haha) and it was just AMAZING. Way better than I could have ever expected and I was blown away by how much I enjoyed it! The crepe was made fresh and it hot and crunchy! It's a different texture than the pancake-y thin and flimsy crepes that I'm used to. I definitely preferred this one more! The ice cream, Nutella and banana is a classic combination and the flavors were wonderful--I was so greedy I almost wanted to order another one! \n\nInstead, we got some of their freshly made eggins instead, which are a Hong Kong snack that I adore (a bit similar to a waffle). I haven't had the opportunity to find a good place down here in Orange County that makes it, and seeing it on the menu made me so excited! I just got the original vanilla flavor, and it was perfect. It was made to order, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside--perfect in every way. \n\nIf you're lucky enough to live in the area, or the SF Bay Area in general, do come and give this place a try. You won't regret it! ;)", "author": "Krystyl C."}

It's part crepe shop and part Japanese mart so you can get your Pocky, your Ramune drinks, and random Japanese knick knacks here as you wait for your crepe. \n\nThe crepes here holds together very well. They aren't too crispy to the point that it breaks and crumbles easily and they aren't super soft where it gets soggy from the ice cream. It's the perfect balance of crispy and soft and the ice cream just sits perfectly in the center and never really causes too much of a mess since the crepe holds it all in.\n\nCan't go wrong with the dessert crepes, especially when it's ice cream dessert crepes! I haven't tried their savory crepes so I can't comment on those. I think their egg puffs might be worth a try too since they have a lot of different flavors to choose from such as blueberry and sesame. \n\nThere seems to always be people here no matter what time or day I come but it never gets too crowded. I think the fact that it is part mini mart means that there is no tables to sit at so no reason for people to overstay their visit too long. There is a long bench by the wall that you can sit on to eat your crepe but that's about it. \n\nCredit card minimum is $10.

But the majority of the people there were definitely there for their desserts--they have egg puffs, crepes, pearl milk tea, smoothies, etc. If you need your Japanese snack craving, they got your back.\n\nI tried the mango ice cream crepe with strawberries (#6 I think?). While the mango ice cream was spot on, the crepe was not. I can't tell if it was because they were super swamped that night and maybe they were making their crepes too quickly, but the crepe itself was terrible. The skin was super tough and crunchy... almost like a fortune cookie rather than a soft layer of dough that it should be. There are much, much better crepe places in the area. \n\nWhat didn't suck, however, was the egg puffs! My friends and I tried the red bean egg puff and the regular one. Honestly the red bean was hardly noticeable--there are just some red beans sprinkled into the dough, but the egg puffs were so good!!

It was my first time coming back to this place in about 5 years since I moved away for college. This used to be my go-to place for crepes in the city. I ordered my usual (number one), which is a crepe with strawberry or banana, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream. \n\nThe crepe itself was very crispy. I usually prefer my crepes to be on the softer side. But it wasn't a big deal... UNTIL I bit into and it was burnt! :( Luckily the flavor of the ice cream covered that burnt taste up a little. \n\nI liked that this place accepted card (because it seems like everyone relies on cards these days)! What I didn't like was there was a minimum of 10 dollars that you have to purchase in order to use that card. Luckily, I had some other people who came with me. So I just paid for their crepe. But if you come by yourself, you might have to buy a few extra items to reach that limit. But with such an abundance of asian snacks and drinks, it shouldn't be too hard. If you ever do need to reach that 10 dollar limit with your crepe order, I suggest the aloe drink, some pocky sticks, and shrimp chips! :D \n\nParking is a hit or miss depending on what time you go.

Best crepes in SF and yes it's a minimart with cute little toys too, bad for me cause I have a soft spot for all those cute things and makes me spend more money while I'm waiting in line and waiting for my crepe.\n\nThere's usually a line, but it hasn't been too bad every time I go around dessert time (9pm). They're pretty fast and you should have your order ready by the time you're at the cashier.\n\nTheir crepes have a good flavor to them with a hint a vanilla and not too sweet (reminds me of a pancake). And perfect texture, crispy on the edges but still soft near the center, but it also depends who makes it, some of the workers might undercook it or overcook it. It's also been perfect every time I've been there, but I've seen some where the crepe was extra crispy. Plus I LOVE ICE CREAM and having ice cream in the middle of my crepe....mmmmm.....heaven. Their nutella crepes are also something you can never go wrong with if you're not feeling the ice cream. They also have ice cream flavors like green tea, red bean, and lychee. I'm not a fan of whip cream so I always ask for no whip cream. You can also substitute things if you don't like their combos (basically build your own crepe).\n\nI have noticed they don't stuff it as much as they used to :(. Less fruit and less ice cream (guess they're trying to do me a favor). But still good.\n\nI haven't tried anything else like their savory crepes or egg puffs. I definitely do want to try their egg puffs.\n\nThey do take card but minimum of $10, but 1 crepe is about $7 so if you aren't planning on treating or getting two or buying some extra goodies, you should bring cash.\n\nThey also don't have tables and chairs, but they do have two benches one inside and one outside where you can sit and wait for your crepe or eat it.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

The crepe skin is pretty crispy and thick, you definitely want to eat your crepe fast before it gets soggy/drippy. I got a turkey, cheese, and avocado crepe and it was pretty good. Lots of cheese and they weren't stingy with the avocado slices either. My friend got a lychee ice cream crepe with \"custard\", but the custard was just condensed milk drizzled on top. I wouldn't complain, since I think condensed milk comes straight from the breast of God, but my friend was pretty adamant that he wanted real custard. \n\n0.5/1 Stars for Value --\nAround $6 for a dessert crepe and around $7-8 for a savory crepe. Not bad, but consider that you are essentially getting two scoops of mediocre ice cream in a giant cone for $6...\n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service -- \nThe cashier was real patient even though my friend and I took forever to decide what we wanted.

Once I got there, the store was closed knowing I looked up the hours saying it was open. I think the owners were outside sitting on a bench and just lounging. It would've been a great common courtesy to tell me it was closed before I tried squeezing my way in behind a bench they blocked the door with. The store looked like it was open because of all the lights on and my friends and I took us 30 minutes just to be disappointed when we got there.

It is in a supermarket and it reminded me of Matsumoto Shaved Snow in Hawaii because it is a combo of a supermarket and dessert place. There was no line at around 7pm on a Saturday.\n\nMy two friends and I first shared a savory crepe. You can make your own which is great because you always want to personalize your crepe. We got chicken, mozzarella, mushrooms, and avocado. That is the best combo ever! You have to get the mushrooms and avocado for sure. It filled us up but we had to try the sweet crepe as well. \n\nOur sweet crepe had nutella, peanut butter, vanilla ice cream and bananas. It comes with whip cream but we opted without it. We were already full but we had to get a sweet crepe! It was actually a bit disappointing compared to our delicious savory crepe. The peanut butter was too thick and it made the crepe a bit too much. The ice cream started to melt and the outside crepe was getting soggy. Next time if I get a sweet crepe, I would for sure get nutella and banana and add strawberries and red bean. Ice cream would be optional depending on my mood.\n\nBack in the south bay, Banana Crepe would be like Genki and Matsumoto in one!\n\n**TIPS**\n1) Split with friends because they are pretty big and it's great to try different flavors. \n2) There is a credit card minimum so most likely you will have to pay cash if you are buying one.\n3) There are preset crepe options but you have the option to make your own.\n4) Enjoy!", "author": "Amy H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-02", "description": "Honestly, I have never seen so many Japanese knick-knacks in my life. The store is small and quaint, but it is quite entertaining. There are tons of Japanese drinks and snacks. On the day that I went, the ramune prices seemed pretty decent. Coming from Denver, a bottle of ramune usually averages around $1.99. At Genki, they were selling ramnue for $1.49. That's a pretty good price savings in my book. \n\nAfter Yelping several crepe stores in my area, I stumbled upon Genki. On my way to this place, I saw a fairly large group of people standing out front. Obviously, this means that Genki is popular. This totally fueled my excitement! Upon entering, my original goal was to try a crepe. Actually, I was very excited to try one of their ice cream crepes. But, something else caught my eye. I became really interested in the little Hong Kong Egg Puff dessert. I hadn't seen anything else like it, so I had to try it! I ordered an original (vanilla), while my friend ordered a strawberry order. I also ordered a pina colada blended drink. Since this place was actually popular, there was a pretty long wait. So, please come patient since there tends to be a lot of customers at night (I assume). But, if you order the Hong Kong dessert, you need to be extra patient since our dessert took much longer to cook than the crepes. Thus, there were people behind us getting their orders first.\n\nThe dessert was actually quite pleasant. It comes to you piping hot in a ventilated paper brown bag. Although the exterior of the dessert is very soft when its hot, it will harden as it cools. But, the inside will remain spongy and soft. If you've ever had taiyaki, I relate it to this dessert. Just imagine the taiyaki without fillings though. Personally, I was not a fan of the strawberry flavor. The strawberry flavor had the same crunchy exterior and soft inside, but the flavoring felt very artificial. These little egg puffs were really fun to eat in my opinion. It sort of reminds me of popping a bread bubble into your mouth. Maybe I'm not making any sense to you, but you'll just have to try it yourself. It's a pretty pleasant experience. I definitely recommend the original (vanilla) flavor. \n\nAs for the blended drink, it did taste very good. It was sweet and cold. But, the pineapple in the pina colada was pretty overpowering. I like the flavor of bananas and coconut, so I definitely missed though flavors that were supposed to be present in the pina colada juice. Also, I sort of thought that the juice would be more fresh and taste less artificial. But, I guess they didn't blend the drink with fruit. I think all the fruit on the counters went to toppings on the crepes. Although I didn't get a crepe, I saw others get them. While you think of the crepe skin as a very thin and soft like a pancake, the crepe skin here was more liken to a thinner fortune cookie. Rather than soft, it seemed quite crunchy. Although I'm sure it tasted swell, I look for traditional French crepe skins when I crave crepes.", "author": "Stephanie N."}

Rapid discussion amongst staff, confusion, inability to find my receipt, despite me saying my partner and I clearly recalled both asking for and paying for nutella (this crepe was almost $9 bucks), total disorganization as the line got longer and longer and I felt worse and worse at raising simple concern I hadn't gotten ingredient I paid for. They insisted I hadnt paid (despite not being able to find my receipt and me clearly remembering the additional cost). They ended up holding up the line trying to sort this all out which I offered a very simple solution for, find the receipt or just give me a side of nutella, you dont need to re-make the crepe, its fine, all good. Except it wasnt. They refused, asked me to pay for nutella which I had both asked and paid for. It was all so frustrating I left. \nIt's just nutella, except its not, its the one ingredient I got in my car for, its the line of tons of people not getting attended to, and being made to feel like It was my fault. Really, really negative experience all around.\n\nAlso, canned mango? Awesome. Super happy I wasted $9.", "author": "leandra l."}

I thought the puffs would be hollow, so it was a pleasant surprise to find it filled with a chewy, mochi-like, blueberry-muffin-like filling: what a great addition to the already tasty crispy, freshly browned batter.  \n\nWhat makes Genki Crepes even more awesome is the mini-mart are aisles of Japanese paraphilia complete with red bean buns (Doraemon's favorite), matcha Kit-Kat (bonus points for the Engrish \"macha\"), men's hairstyling products, and more.  \n\nConclusion: Solid crepes, HK egg puffs, and mini-mart--how else could I write a detailed review based on watching a friend eat a crepe, stealing bites of HK egg puffs from another friend, and browsing around the store.

But basically, they gyped us and OVERCHARGING  us for things that they cannot put in the crepe! \n\nShe should tell us what they can add and what they cannot. Did no do anything to compensate that the fact that the overcharged us. Granted, it was only .85 cents but honestly, it's NOT the money but the principle.  Her crepe in total was 7 bucks and honestly, no worth it. This place just completely irked me the wrong way with people not knowing what they were doing. I ordered a green tea ice cream crepe with nutella and banana. When I got my crepe, the unhappy girl says \"Vanilla crepe\"...I got..uhhhh, I wanted green tea. IF in fact that it was a vanilla ice cream, I'd make them make another one. Once again, not a big deal but it's the principle that counts!\n\nOn the other hand, the crepes were really good. Crepe was perfectly thing and crispy so I've got to give them kudos for that, hence the extra star. But honestly, the service just rubbed me the wrong way. Would really rather try another crepe place next time than this place. I know they have a fan base, but I'm def. not one.", "author": "Denise L."}

Now I've successfully completed both college and grad school and it's still around! Amazing--since most stores open then pick up and leave within a small time period in the city. Genki has a variety of Japanese candies, chips, drinks, make-up, toys and accessories. The selection is overwhelming and I feel that the store has become more cluttered over the years. It's nice to look around and see what you can find in the sea of merchandise. I usually come here for the crepes when Japantown is closed. This time like every other time, I ordered the mixed fruit with green tea ice cream and my sister and her boyfriend ordered the green tea ice cream crepe with red bean. I don't know if it's me being away in LA for too long but when I kindly asked the cashier to have both nutella and whipped cream in my crepe (because I love to indulge!) she rejected my request. I was willing to pay more for it but she said that it would throw the chef off. It was either one or the other.?!?!?!?!?!?!?! I'm still alarmed by her comment. It doesn't take a genius to add a spread of nutella to the crepe, scoop a scoop of ice cream, top it with some mixed fruits and spritz some whipped cream on the top. But rules are rules and in this case, they weren't meant to be broken. I didn't want to make a scene and delay the long line behind me so I decided to go with the whipped creme. My crepe was a little naked. There was an inch of unfilled crepe crust spewing from the top. But all in all, it was a mediocre crepe. My only complaints were: the whipped creme tasted funny and the bananas were 2 inch long (not bite-size).

When you look inside, you'll see that most of this place is a little Asian marketplace filled with a bunch of asian snacks you could find at 99Ranch, so that was unexpected. Multi-tasking, I see...very nice. Genki Crepes is at the front, next to the window. They had one cash register for both the little market and the crepe area so I can see how that could be a pain if I just wanted to buy one thing from the market and there were a bunch of people standing around waiting for crepes or to order. \n\nI got the Lychee ice cream crepe with custard and whipped cream on top and honestly, it was just okay. I've tried crepes in a lot of places, and I mean it did satisfy my cravings but it was pretty ordinary. I appreciated all the different choices though! I will definitely come back and try other things, both savory and sweet. The crepe itself was crispy on the outside edges, which I love because you get two textures and not just a floppy soft crepe. But what I was a little surprised by was the fact that the crepe by itself was definitely salty. I could TASTE the salt....and crepes usually have a hint of sweetness. It was interesting...but I think I would prefer a sweet crepe covering instead to complement the sweet ice cream, custard, and whipped cream inside. \n\nBut do get the whipped cream! It wasn't too sweet and was really good.\n\nTip: when you get the crepe, it's basically a cone....so to get the most out of it, press down on it with both hands so that it's a little bit more flattened out. You can now bite into it like a sandwich! If you try eating it as is, around the edges as you would an ice cream cone, it'll get super messy and you won't get enough crepe per bite!", "author": "Kelly T."}

Inside, they sell japanese/korean imported beauty items, lots of good Asian snacks, some random household products, cold drinks, and many more. \n\nJust go for the dessert crepes! I love to customize my own crepe like usual, so I get the original batter with strawberry ice cream, strawberry fruit, mango fruit, whipped cream, and nutella. One thing I did not like was how they just put the entire half of the strawberry in which made the crepe collapse faster due to the weight of it. My total came out to be $7.22 (including tax).  However, if you dont know what you want just choose from their set combinations on their menu, which might be a little cheaper than customizing. They also sell snacks like egg puffs here which I find pretty tasty! They make it on the spot so it's very hot and fresh. \n\nDown side is they dont have seats, but they have one bench inside, which is not great when you have a group and even worse when theres a bunch of people there, you will definitely not find seats.

This place is average; there is nothing that really sets this place apart from other crepe places.  It is clear that this place gets business because it is in such a good location.  There are a lot of surrounding restaurants that are open late.  The actual crepe making area is rather small, being enclosed by a sort of small junk food mart.  I would assume that most people wander around the store while their crepes are being made.  \n\nThe GF and I ordered a dessert crepe with kiwi, mango ice cream, and whip cream.  The crepe was made in a few minutes.  The presentation was as one could expect from an average crepery.  The crepe itself has a slightly salty taste to it.  Usually the dessert  crepes I have eaten are sweet and soft.  It did not bother me too much though.  The ice cream was the star of the crepe.  I absolutely love mango ice cream.  \n\nThere are some benches to sit on while eating the crepe.  Other than that, there is nothing much to say.

With all the hot gossip bouncing around here and there, I had to put Genki on bookmark for my places to hit up in San Francisco!\n\nMade weekend plans to come here with hood rat Amy W. for dessert! The sweet smell of crepes that greets you definitely works up your appetite. I had the mango ice cream with strawberry crepe and Amy had the green tea ice cream with lychee crepe. The total came out to be $10 plus tax, which isn't bad for crepes!  There's a $10 minimum for debit/credit purchases, which worked out perfectly! We get our number, wait about 5 minutes for our orders, and were on our way. Besides a bench, there isn't much seating, but the place is meant more to grab-and-go.\n\nThis has got to be the most memorable crepe I've ever had! From start to finish, the crepe didn't fall apart or get all sloppy like other crepes. If it's one thing that I distinctly remember, it's definitely the crisp and the warmth of the crepe against the ice cream. The whipped cream had a nice delicate fluff and the ice cream had the perfect texture, all evenly distributed so that you get a bit of everything with each bite. They're also very generous with the ice cream! The strawberries were fresh, but overly sour for my taste. It could've just been the time of day, but the overpowering sourness became too distracting for me to enjoy. Don't worry about having ate all the fruit on top - there's also fruit at the bottom to balance things out.\n\nGenki is also a supermarket that sells all sorts of Asian goodies and cutesy knick-knacks. I like how they sell certain things in bulk because I can never have enough of my favorite munchies!

There was surprisingly no line when we arrived. As we browsed the menu I noticed that the dessert crepe items were already matched together for the combinations. I really did not remember this detail, but since I knew I was going to get green tea already, I asked to try the red bean ice cream. It was not bad at all. I would say that next time I would consider that if I did not like green tea more. Anyway, my sister stuck to her usual cheesecake and chocolate ice cream crepe and I stuck with my green tea lychee crepe. \n\nMy little sister's crepe came out first and boy was it full. She started to eat hers and a few minutes afterward, my crepe was finished. I looked into the crepe and everything was sunken in. It was a measly amount of food compared to my sister's. As we left the store and as I was about to dig in, I notice an eyelash in the fold of the crepe. I go back and the girl apologizes and remakes my crepe. The new crepe was not as sunken but still had a small amount of filling. The ice cream was almost room temp, and so were the lychee and whip cream. The only thing I enjoyed about my crepe was the crepe itself. It was warm, crispy and sweet.

In the mood for green tea ice cream and a crepe, I trekked down to Genki. \n\nThe prices here aren't bad -- $3.95 for strawberry Nutella; $5 when adding green tea ice cream. Service was pretty slow and there were about two guys working the back. I walked around the shop too; interesting products but no matcha powder. Oh well. \n\nI was looking forward to my crepe- and quite frankly, it's REALLY difficult to screw up a crepe. Unfortunately, mine was completely overdone. The crepe was overly crispy and brown that it was impossible to eat especially with how wide they serve their crepes in a cone.

I am not sure if you can customize the ingredients, but it wouldn't hurt to ask. Street parking was very limited; we had to park and walk two blocks, so be prepared to walk.

The crepes here are just too good. This place masters the art of making crepes that are crispy yet chewy at the same time. It's crazy how these crepes aren't overly crispy, yet they also don't get soggy. How do they do it?! Maybe it's the batter or maybe it's the workers. I will never know, and I'm perfectly okay with that. Without a doubt, this is the first place I go to whenever I want crepes.\n\nThis place isn't just known for its crepes though. You've got to get their egg puffs as well. Not too many places in the city sell egg puffs, and of the ones that do, few (if any) make them as well as Genki does. Just like the crepes, the egg puffs are made to have the perfect chewy texture while having crispy edges. Pop one in your mouth and it just melts. I love it. No other place makes eggs puffs as good as these ones. That's a fact.\n\nThe line here can tend to get pretty long, as the line extends back into the store. It's almost as if it's all on purpose though. Standing in line causes you to end up looking around the store at the different toys, candy, foods, and drinks they sell there. Aside from the desserts they make, the mart itself is actually pretty neat. It's definitely fun to walk around looking at stuff as you wait for your desserts to be made. \n\nCome here whenever you're craving some yummy dessert!

We ordered our crepes pretty fast since we already knew what we want. Then we wandered around the shop and found lot of amazing things! There were Japanese drinks, GLASS BOTTLE sprite (is that rare? I don't see it often, so I found it rare...), miso, candies, etc... There was no eggs though (me and my cousin were shopping for eggs for dinner, so yeah). \nFinally, we got our crepes after wandering around for 5-10 minutes. I think my green tea ice cream with red bean paste crepe without whip cream was pretty decent. The green tea ice cream was amazing! Except that I kept dropping the ice cream as I bit the whole crepe. So try not to eat the crepe too fast, or the stuff inside the crepe might drop. \nUm, my cousin didn't like her green tea ice cream with lychees crepe as much as I did. She said that the crepe itself was crispy but kind of salty... But she loved the green tea ice cream and lychee. She kept saying the ice cream didn't taste artificial and the lychees were so good even though they were canned lychees. \nThe price is not that bad, crepes are kind of expensive overall. It costed $10.77 for two ice cream crepes. \nOverall, if you don't mind cold and a bit salty crepe, you will enjoy Genki's crepe like I did. Because my cousin's comment, I subtracted one star.

The shop itself is set aside as the front half of a little mart that sells various Japanese and Korean goodies, and offers up a an extensive collection of sweet and savory crepes, as well as a variety of egg puff flavors. With my friend getting their chocolate cake and Hershey's sauce crepe, I opted for a simpler sesame egg puff.\n\nAnd boy, I wish I'd gotten a crepe instead. The egg puffs aren't bad, with the sesame flavor being quite distinct, but overall, a fairly underwhelming pastry. The chocolate cake crepe, on the other hand, was amazingly tasty - they certainly did not skimp on the chocolate sauce or cake. Served on a crispy, thin crepe, my only complaint was that the entire crepe was not crispy - understandable though, given that the sauce and whip cream are bound to soften it up.\n\nIt can be a bit of a wait (~10 minutes) until your order comes out, especially on busy days, but it's well worth the short wait.

The busy shop is also a grocery store that sell imported groceries. Although with the pretty good selection of imported goods, the store's money-maker is definitely the fresh crepes. \n\nI went straight to the menu posted on the wall and ordered the #25: the mixed fuit crepe.

Man, I wish I had this stuff when I was younger. Now I know what was I missing for the past thirty-something years. After that crepe, I felt like a kid again. Even my wife and kids had this unique treat before I did.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/83dXgt2nG98JJG2F7ai8AQ?select=CrH-XBvIB_cEe6p0Ob5f7g\n\n\"Where have I've been?\"\n\nI paid my treat in cash.

If you've got an Asian snack/product/toy from your childhood that you've wanted to get your hands on, then this mart has got it in stock for you!\n\nI would say that the crepes section of the shop is $ while the mini-mart section is $$. Because everything from the mini-mart is imported, it will be on the pricier side. But sometimes, that Asian candy/snack is worth it! My boyfriend loves Kit-Kats and he loves coming to Genki to buy the different flavors that are available (sometimes, Genki stocks different flavors of Kit-Kats. Their usuals are the regular chocolate and dark chocolate flavors. So far, I've seen strawberry, green tea, and milk chocolate). I also like to occasionally buy aloe jelly drinks from here. They've got a wide variety of brands and sizes in stock.\n\nI personally most frequent the crepes section of the store, which serves both dessert and savory crepes. I like buying their dessert crepes with ice cream and my favorite is the strawberry ice cream with kiwi fruit. Their crepes are very large and very crunchy and can get a bit messy if you order the dessert crepes with ice cream. The size of the crepe is large enough to share between two people, but the way they serve the crepes makes sharing difficult (the crepes are served wrapped in an ice cream cone-like paper, so you'll have to hold it upright.\n\nOn a side note, this place does not accept card for purchases under $10 so why not buy your favorite childhood Asian snack to go with your crepe?\n\nThere isn't very much seating around the area so you may end up standing around outside. There are a few small benches inside and outside of the store, but they're usually taken up by other people. I always see customers in this store, although it's never overly crowded.\n\nI love to take friends here for dessert after a dinner out. I always have fun walking around the mini-mart and looking at all the imported Asian products. Overall, it's a great place to end the night or to end a meal date. I would recommend stopping by if you're ever in the area.", "author": "Nirel R."}

It's hard to avoid it and 99.9 % of the time, you will walk in even without knowing. I think i come here more for the candy and snacks than the crepes itself.  This place sells crepes and other surprises.  But since this place is called Genki Crepes, let me start out by reviewing their main sale item.   They have a huge selection of crepe, but I never like having ice cream in my crepe, so I usually stick to my Nutella and banana crepe.  I normally don't have to wait too long for my crepe, it's just finding a place to stand in the crowd as you wait that's the problem.  I like how my crepe was crunchy and the ingredients are fresh, but I really wish i had a place to sit down and enjoy it without all the customers looking at me.  There's only one bench there, but i guess that's because they don't want to convert this place into a sit down cafe. \n\nThe snacks and goodies is worth exploring here.  You will be surprised by what you will find.  They sell hair and body care here from Asia, but it's almost double the cost from asia. I saw some items that was double the price of what i bought it for in Hong Kong.  I guess it makes sense because they might ship the items over.  It's hard to walk away from their snacks section, they have lots of green tea and matcha snacks here, so if you are a fan you are pretty much screwed, because you want it all.  Don't be surprise if you walk out of here for bags of delicious snacks!", "author": "Belinda C."}

Better than the crepes in San Jose. \n\nI usually go for something with nutella in it (can't go wrong with nutella, according to a friend) and/or ice cream and fruits with whip cream. They definitely need one of these in San Jose. \n\nIt's awesome, but I would avoid night times since it's usually when it's the most busiest or avoid weekends, too. Even so, they're pretty fast with taking orders and getting the food out. \n\nLove the mini market that's within. Highly recommend coming here if you're craving for some good, low-priced, and freshly made crepes, if you're in South San Francisco area.", "author": "Josephine C."}

Everything from overseas candy and games, to trinkets. Their need to be a one stop shop definitely works if you're into that kind of Genre for toys or trinkets.\n\nIt was a real battle on figuring out whether it's a four or five star review and I decided on four only because you can get lost in the store just wondering through everything they have.

I picked out some of the melted gooey-ness.\n\nThe crepe counter was near the cashier by the door in a little cramped convenience store that sold little Japanese snacks and goodies. You line up in the store to place your order. There's no seating but 2 benches: one in front of the ice cream display where all the customers walk in; one in front of the store. We ended up eating in the car since there were no seats (plus or meter was about to expire).\n\nWhile waiting for the crepes, I overheard that they make their own lychee ice cream!! Yay for us ordering it.

I made an hour-long voyage to SF today from Oakland (yay for slow public transportation on Muni and Bart!) just to have a crepe from Genki today. They have a great variety of both sweet and hot crepes to try out, but my favorite one of all has to be their Green Tea with Red Bean. The red bean paste they use is definitely high quality and they do not cheap out on the portions there. The whipped cream that comes with it also acts a great complement. \n\nCustomer service is great here; definitely service with a smile. There was quite a number of people waiting for their crepe as I ordered mine, but my order was completed in less than 5 minutes. Only drawback folks is although they do accept debit/credit cards, there IS a $10 MINIMUM. So bring that cash unless you plan on buying more!  \n\nAlthough Genki is a little further out than the popular Sophie's Crepes in Japantown, I would say that the extra 15 minute bus ride on Geary Blvd is worth it.

What makes Genki really good is that their crepes aren't soggy from the start. It's crunchy at the top and soft on the bottom, the way it's suppose to be! They also position the crepe holder so that when your ice cream drips to the bottom, it stays in the holder rather than all over your clothes (a messy experience I have personally witnessed.... HORRIBLE!).\n\nIn terms of seating, to the side is a bench that can sit about 6-8 people, and outside is a table that can seat another 6.

Me and my wife came here around 11 pm on a Saturday night and the place was packed. We ordered the most basic combination available on the menu which is strawberry, banana, nutella and vanilla ice cream. Both of our crepes came out within 15 mins and we were delighted. Unfortunately, our order got mixed up. Instead of the vanilla ice cream, they put green tea ice cream. We asked the lady at the cashier if they can change it. She said yes, and so we both gave our crepes back, she offered her apologies and told us that she will take care of it. \n\nWhat happened next was utterly unbelievable. As we were watching from the side, she handed our crepes to the other lady and began scooping out the green tea ice cream, banana and strawberry out of our crepes and into the chopping board. Then she started to weed out the banana and strawberry from the rest of the green tea ice cream, forked them up and placed them back in the same crepe and then added the vanilla ice cream. I was mind blown! LIKE WTF, THAT'S WAS FREAKIN GROSS!!!\n\nWe really don't care if we have to wait an extra 15 mins as long as they get it right. We told the cashier that the way our food was handled was so unacceptable and unsanitary. In return, the cashier just rolled her eyes and yelled to the other lady telling her to make us a new one.

The vanilla ice cream was very soft and tender.  Strawberries tasted fresh and how can you go wrong with nutella...you just can't!  Whipped cream has the right amount of sweetness which is just right for your taste buds.  The crepes are freshly made with each order and made right in front of you too.

It's about $4.95 for an ice cream crepe and it is LITERALLY just a couple scoops of ice cream on the bottom, dotted with some fruits on top and a dollop of whipped cream to finish it off. When you get to the bottom of the crepe, you're basically only eating ice cream. There's not much to it. \n\nIn my perspective- you can spend $2 to buy your own tub of ice cream, cut up some fruit and all you'd be missing is the crepe skin.\n\nOther than that, the store was actually pretty cute!

Usually for milestones, I'll pick something special, something sentimental, something memorable. \n\nFor this review, I just took the next business on my review list. For those who know me, I love anything sweet, be it candy, donuts, pies, mochi, ice cream, yogurt, malasadas, chocolate,...... \n\nSo happens this next business was of the sweet variety.\n\nFull from dim sum at Tong Palace (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tong-palace-san-francisco#hrid:wrWhg-VMQqvkH7LGX6_DZw/src:self), my daughters wanted to know what we were doing next, or just go home. I told my oldest that heard about this place about 5 blocks down on Clement street that makes dessert crepes. \n\n\"Did you read about this in Yelp?\" she asked. \n\n\"Yep,\" I said. \n\n\"I should have known. Sounds good let's go, but could you drive down?\" \n\n\"Nope, were going to walk off lunch first\" I said. \n\nAfter a nice stroll for 5 blocks, we arrived at the store. We studied their menu on the back wall, then placed our order. While we were waiting for our order, the kids browsed the inside of the store, oohing and ahhing the Japanese stuffed animals, toys, and snacks (ended up buying some of these goodies for them as well). \n\nFive minutes, our orders were ready.: \nchocolate egg puffs \n\n-Nutella and Marshmallow Crepe (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/83dXgt2nG98JJG2F7ai8AQ?select=I92LpezSoRIV13itV30GbA): My oldest saw this on the menu an had to order it. She said it was like eating a S'more, but instead of Graham Crackers, it was neatly wrapped in a crispy crepe. \n\n-Mango ice cream and strawberry crepe (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/83dXgt2nG98JJG2F7ai8AQ?select=uhyGipT557R7WVI6wn7Qsg): Crepe was crispy at the edges, and slightly chewy and crispy towards the center. Just enough to hold the ice cream, strawberries, and whipped cream together. Quite good and refreshing, even for a cool day like that day. \n\n-Chocolate Egg Puffs: Fresh off the waffle iron and hot. As far egg puffs go, these were OK, but my youngest was happy because it was chocolate. \n\nKids liked it so much, we returned the next day, with my oldest daughter's friend, after spending the afternoon in J-Town. \n\nThey had: \n-Strawberry Nutella Crepes: What goes well with Nutella, but strawberries. We order one each for the older girls, and they must have enjoyed them because they were pretty quiet while eating them. \n\n-Chocolate Milkshake: This was for my chocoholic youngest daughter. Thick and creamy. She liked it as well, but couldn't finish it. I did my fatherly duty and helped her finish it. \n\nOn both days, we enjoyed our crepes and other snacks while sitting on their wooden benches. Not much room to sit, but enjoyed looking at the foot traffic coming into and out of this store. \n\nGlad I finally made it here.  My daughters can count on me to find anything that is sweet, and love to try out these places with me.  It was a perfect afternoon break on the two days we were in the area.", "author": "Steve L."}

There was Nutella smeared on my chin, like a blob of it.  Shook my head in complete embarrassment.  Either he was really nice and didn't want to say anything to embarrass me or it was dark in his car and he didn't notice it at all.  I never asked him about it and he never mentioned it afterward.  Therefore, it never happened in my book.\n\nI absolutely adore Genki Crepes.  Sure, there's usually a line but it's worth the wait.  There sweet crepes are a lot better than the one in Japantown.

Genki's batter is similar to pancake batter with a hint of vanilla. I love the texture of the crepe...crispy on the edges and soft in the center. After cooking it to order, it's generously slathered with Nutella and topped w/ a scoop of Mitchell's vanilla ice cream, folded, placed in a paper cone and topped with whip cream. The first bite is always orgasmic...all sorts of flavor and texture combos: the warm crispy crepe w/ thick, ooey gooey chocolately hazelnut spread, and rich, creamy vanilla ice cream!

It's has just a touch of sweetness to satisfy your sweet tooth. \n\nBesides Genki's staple items, it's also a Mini-Snack Mart with a variety of bottled drinks (aloe vera, green tea, yogurt drinks, asian sodas, etc), Asian hard candies and gummies, dried snacks (chips, jerkey, cuttle fish, prunes, ginger, etc), and even has bath and beauty products (face blotters, pluckers, soap and hand lotion). \n\nBeing that it's in the heart of the Inner Richmond with no shortage of restaurants, it gets very busy at night after 8 PM from nearby diners. But, service is always fast and efficient b/c they normally have 3 employees making the crepes, egg puffs, and drinks. \n\nI've always recommended to Genki to friends and others and they have never been disappointed.

Fantastic topping choices, from staples like nutella and whipped cream to Japanese favorites like red bean paste. Delicious, perfect, hot, sweet, fresh crepe wrapping it all up. And the bliss? That's the harmony of enjoying it all in one hand-held dessert, AND knowing that there are (thousands? millions?) of possible flavor combinations just waiting for you to try.\n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, your indulgence isn't cut short by Genki closing -- they're open pretty late and normally stay open on holidays. You may have to be patient for your creation, but fortunately there are shelves crammed with Japanese imports to peruse, and a large bulletin board filled with strange postings. The only downside is a lack of indoor seating upon which to savor your just-made scrumptious treat, but those witty people at Genki knew that your joy was likely to cause oversight in your normally perfectly clean and tidy eating habits, leading to all kinds of goodness spilling onto the sidewalk on Clement Street, instead of in their tiny store and cafe.\n\nThey do actually offer many options for savory crepes and even other food categories, but who are you kidding?

What's odd is this crepe spot is located inside a small convenience store. \n\nI ordered the #5 mixed fruits w/ Nutella. I also added ice cream.  The total came up to $8.10.  To me, this was a lot for a crepe but if it tastes good then it'll be worth it.  So I waited patiently while the lady made our crepes.  The lady who made the crepes seemed to have a rude attitude.  She did not look like she enjoyed her job at all by her facial expressions. I even saw her punch her fist on top of the counter :(\n\nWhen I finally got my crepe, it looked appealing.  The crepe was crispy.  One bite of it and pieces of the crepe would fall off.  It was good but not $8 good lol\n\nI highly doubt I will go back.

So my boyfriend and I drove around trying to find a place that was opened and looked appealing.  We saw a crowd in front of this place and thought that it had to be good.\n\nSo we parked and walked on over.  When you first walk in, it can get a bit cramped since that is where everyone is sitting/standing just waiting for their order to be called out.  After you get through the crowd there is a line at the other end of the counter.  If you walk past the counter you then walk into their little Asian Market.  They have a wide variety of items, from toys to drinks to foods to personal care items.\n\nAfter placing our orders, I had a great time looking around at all the interesting things they had.  I feel like this place could be a one stop shop for all your basic Asian needs (i.e. stationary or face blotting pads or even some mangos) and still grab a nice little dessert, drink or coffee on your way out.\n\nIt took about 10+ minutes for our order to come out, but there were so many people that I didn't really expect anything less.  I ordered a Crepe with Strawberry Ice Cream and real Cheesecake.  The crepe itself was good ... the top part is sometimes made a little to hard causing to be more crunchy then soft, which I did not care for(-1 star).  But as I got closer to the middle of the crepe it was perfect -- and so were my fillings.\n\nThis place brings a smile to my face and is worth the wait.  They have such a wide variety of fillings to chose from that the combinations seem endless.  So if you are ever craving crepes, make a stop here and they'll satisfy that craving for you.", "author": "Pia V."}

When our friends brought us here they had asked us if we liked the crunchy kind or the soft kind of crepes.  I was like crunchy-wha??  Sure enough, they make these crepes to have a crunch to them and a very very thin layer of softness in between (which is hardly noticeable because they're already thin as it is).  And to top it off, you can choose it with filling or with ice cream (bummer that you can't have both, though).\n\nI chose the chocolate cake, whipped cream, and melted hershey one and it wasn't sweet at all.  I was soo good and light but it was pretty damn filling.  It's conveniently folded into a flat cone and placed into a custom made paper cone thingy.  My boyfriend ordered the nutella one and added peanut butter and whipped cream.  That was my first time trying nutella and I don't know if it was the crepes or the nutella flavor but I can tell you one thing:  From now on whenever I eat nutella I'm going to expect an orgy in my mouth!  Haha... sorry if that was too vulgar.  Seriously, though!  Holy cow!  Nuff said.  He bit into the little piece of parchment paper wrapped between the crepe and inside the paper cone.

If you've never seen it, go ahead and watch a professional in progress.  For some reason, it looks like it's been the same group of guys making the crepes for years.  \n\nThe wait time for your crepe depends on how busy it is.  Wait time may be up to three minutes or so (from my experience at least).  Don't fret though because this place also has a mini mart full of Asian snacks and knick-knacks to browse through.  My sister brought this to my attention recently, they have these bags of seaweed chips (forgot the name) that have a variety of flavors like tempera and spicy.  I would recommend if only I remembered the name.\n\nAs far as your choice of crepe, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  For me, if there's nutella in it, I'm set.  Nutella is the key.  Usually your favorite fruit in the crepe will make magic for you.  If you're not a fan of fruit, just have it with ice cream and nutella with some whip cream.  \n\nThe crepes come in a paper holder and a spoon.  The holder is merely for hygiene purposes in my eyes.

We had evidently ordered the exact same crepe as our first visit - strawberries, custard, no nutella??!, lychee ice cream, and whipped cream.

Overly crispiness could have probably been remidied with some vocalization and monitoring... but that what switched me off from Genki - though my boyfriend loved it! The lychee ice cream was overly icy and left me longing for the gelato from Sophies. The custard was also more like the cream on top of asian fruit tarts than egg pudding - which was what I was expecting, though I guess thats not something to knock them down for? IDK; maybe my expectations were too high... but I think I prefer Sophie's Crepes to Genki's... not to say I won't stop by again the next time I make my rounds at Burma Superstar.\n\nWorth noting, my boyfriend says he likes Genki's better than Sophie's... so I guess its all down to preference.", "author": "Lana N."}

They serve ice-cream crepes (featuring red bean, lynchee, mango, green tea ice creams), savory crepes (like ham, cheese, salmon, wasabi), and my favorite, snack/dessert crepes (example: cheesecake, blueberry sauce).  \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the #21, nutella and banana crepe ($3.95) and the strawberry egg puffs ($3.25) to share.  Since we went around 2:00 p.m., there wasn't any wait.  We ordered our snacks and explored the shop while we waited, which was only about 5 minutes.  \n\nThe crepe was done first and it had a decent amount of both Nutella and bananas.  The bananas were thinly sliced and evenly distributed around the cone shaped crepe.  The crepe was made just right where it was crispy but not overly flakey.  You could take a bite of it without squishing all of the filling to one side, or having it fall out in a mess.\n\nThe strawberry egg puffs were pretty good, but didn't really seem like anything special.  They were crisp on the edges and easy to break apart, while being soft/chewy-ish on the \"puff\" part.  My boyfriend definitely liked the crepe better.\n\nFor those not in a crepe or egg puff mood, they also sell blended drinks for $2.50 and milk shakes for $3.95, featuring flavors like taro,  giner, papaya and sesame.  \n\nOverall, I'd say Genki Crepes is about a 3.5, but I'll round up because they have such a wide variety of offerings. \n\nNotes:\n-There is metered street parking right in front, or go around the corner for free 2-hour parking and use the change you saved to buy some Asian candy inside.\n-They have a few benches for you to sit and enjoy your crepes.", "author": "Samantha L."}

Hmmmm, another long line but we didn't mind since we were full and blissfully wallowing on the few pounds that we gained. \n\nFirst thing I noticed was the smell of crepes permeating in the area. It's a nice aroma and someone should bottle it and sell it as a perfume. This ought to attract some attractive people. Just like the Axe commercial; just spray some on you and watch the ladies go crazy. OK...enough of my delusions of grandeur. \n\nMy youngest son and I both ordered the Vanilla Ice Cream, Bananas with Whipped Cream. My oldest ordered the Chocolate Ice Cream and Cheesecake with Whipped Cream. The wifey ordered Vanilla Ice Cream, Strawberries, Nutella with Whipped Cream. I also ordered a Cantaloupe Milkshake for the road.  \n\nWhile waiting for your order, you can look around the store. This place also doubles as a mini mart and they sell Japanese knick knack toys to different kinds of Pocky, the Japanese Snack Food. OK, it's junk food but I happen to like them. Of course we couldn't resist on stocking up our pantry. What started as a dessert trip ended up being a shopping spree. \n\nWe finally got our order and couldn't wait to chow them down. The Vanilla Ice Cream was good as it had a nice sweetness and texture. It definitely wasn't your plain ole vanilla like the ones at your local Safeway store. The Whipped Cream was creamy and delish. I just wished they had more slices of bananas in there. Of course I also sampled my wifey's and son's for comparison. I should've gotten the Nutella as well.\n\nOverall, it was good...but not as good as Sophie's Crepe in Japantown. Even though the crepe was thick and crispy, it was a tad on the salty side for my taste. I would normally finish the whole thing but I couldn't get past the saltiness of the crepe.

I've never had crispy crepes before but they. are. delicious. it's like having thin waffle cones that are just soft enough so they don't cut up your mouth and melt as soon as you take a bite.\n\nAvocado shake = I could not taste any avocado no matter how hard I tried. this is basically a vanilla milkshake with green coloring. the tapioca balls were perfectly cooked though.\n\nI'm taking off a star because of the disappointing avocado shake and because the store has nowhere for people to stand in line and nowhere to sit afterwards. It's just a huge mess of people in the front of the store and standing outside while eating an ice cream crepe or milkshake really isn't pleasant (especially when it's so cold and windy...and this is Summer!).", "author": "Amaryllia L."}

There's got to be something to it, a secret they hold that brings in their loyal fans in hordes and droves at nighttime. However, I just don't get it.\n\nClement street is a food haven indeed. With P. Orgasmica on your street, you'll be salivating to eat more after a dinner experience within 4 blocks of every cardinal direction of Clement. I just don't understand why Genki picks up the dessert seekers?\n\nIt feels like a sweatshop here. I feel like the cash register chick is useless. It's like if you get creative on the cash register chick, she shuts down. I wanted a milkshake that was Nutella in origin, and she just said \"it's impossible\". I thought that was funny so I said \"your staff is incapable of making it...or?\", she says: \"Yes! That's what the problem is, it's impossible.\"\n\nMany's the Asian that this place attracts. I know Asians love to eat. But I'm afraid that just because there are throngs present doesn't mean the food is good----just that they all followed each other to the same place with little individual opinion or will to contradict what the group has decided to do. I suppose it's a cultural idiosyncrasy, and we all have them, no? But, I feel like, if interrogated individually, most of the Asian patrons might say \"I honestly don't really get why my friends go bonkers for the Denny's style desserts served here, but I just want to hang out with and chill with my friends, so it's fine.\"\n\nI've got to give it three stars though, because I enjoyed a pretty tasty mocha milkshake and was highly amused at the lack of space to queue up inside, as well, of course, as the robotic cash register chick. It's worth it to look through the convenience store, though.

It was good, but definitely needed more Nutella and bananas. Not sure if there weren't too many because we came close to closing, but the crepe would have been much better with more filling.

What a mistake.\n\nFirst off, let me say that I have been here before several times, just never got around to reviewing the place. Fully intended to make good on previous promises to review Genki crepes and give them five stars. Was so dissapointed I could barely give this place two stars, and almost gave it one. I mean, I'm ok with a line of people waiting to get delicious crepes. I'm ok with the crepes being a bit more expensive if it is delicious, freshly made, and filled with deliciousness. But as I stood there watching them make crepes, my heart sank. They weren't using the full crepe cooktop, so they were making crepes like 2/3 the size they normally do. They didn't use the little wooden paddle to spread the batter out correctly and make the crepe crispy and delicious (instead, it was thicker and slightly chewy). The lady working the egg puff station had a poor additude, and kept telling us to wait 5 minutes for our egg puffs (it took twenty). That, and the egg puffs were so poorly made they were doughy, chewy, and overall not good eats.\n\nMaybe it was just a busy night, or maybe the quality of this place has just gone down.

They did a pretty good job; if their was a gripe, then that it would be that they didn't have as many toppings to choose from.  Otherwise, my crepe with mango ice cream and strawberries with whip cream was just peachy.  The crepe skin was warm and crisp and the mixture of the ice cream, whip cream, and fruit blended so well together with each bite.  I wish they were more generous with the strawberries, but it was still adequate enough.\n\nTaking a quick glance around the store, it really is a convenient store with the Asian flare to it.

That's my theory of why Genki Crepes exists.\n\nHaving just stuffed ourselves over at Burma Superstar, my friends and I walked over to Genki Crepes to further stuff ourselves with crepes.  Ok, I'll admit I was actually the only one who did the further stuffing of self with a crepe.  And not with a thin and wimpy crepe.  I had an ice cream crepe, and it was big.\n\nGenki Crepe was pretty busy when when we got there.  It seems at least some of the people there had the same idea of getting dessert at this establishment after having dinner at Burma Superstar.  I also talked to some people who made a trip to the neighbourhood specifically to have the crepes there.\n\nI had the vanilla ice cream crepe with nutella and strawberry.  Ice cream + nutella.  That's genius and makes so much sense!  On my next visit I think I will have to try the red bean ice cream crepe, because red bean is one of my favourite ice cream flavours.", "author": "Radford T."}

(which is quite often). \nThey've got all kinds of goodies that whether or not I end up buying anything, it always gives me a reason to smile about. They've got a pretty good Asian candy, snack, drink, noodle, cosmetic/make-up and beauty selection but they also sell some cool/cute random knick-knacky Hello Kitty/Super Mario Bros type things that remind me so much of the stores I frequented while on my recent trip to China, Shanghai and Hong Kong. \n\nAs for their desserts, I can only speak of their sweet/dessert crepes. \n(I have yet to try their boba drinks, ice cream or savory crepes.) \nOverall the portions aren't as big as I've had at other places like Crepevine but they're still very good b/c they're freshly prepared, warm, flaky and consistent. Every time I've visited this place I know exactly what I'm getting and its a definitely something I appreciate.\n\nThe down side to this place is there isn't any good place or much room for sitting. You usually see people tightly seated next to each other on the 1 or maybe it's the 2 benches that they have inside the store. The other patrons just have to stand outside in the cold to enjoy their treats. \n\nAlthough writing this review didn't really do much for quenching my crepe craving, it was nice to think about the yumminess that I'll soon reward myself w/ once I reach my desired fitness goal AND keep me occupied at least til they close shop before I succumb and submit to satisfying my sweet tooth craving...

So I took my first bite of the apple, cinnamon, brown sugar crepe **CRACK**  M'Okay that was a little crunchy like a waffle cone.  Took another bite.  Same thing.  What is this?  I have never had a crepe this crunchy and the filling this dry in my life.  Two bites were enough for me.  My crepe was so dry and crunchy it tasted like a fortune cookie *hah, I made a rhyme* \n\nSo why was my experience at Genki so disappointing?  Maybe it was an off day?  Maybe I didn't add ice cream?  Maybe I should've ordered one with whipped cream?  Maybe I should've ordered the honey, banana, almond crepe or the cheesecake whipped blueberry crepe?\n\nI really don't want to give 2 stars to Genki but I could not come up with a good enough \"Maybe\" to change my mind.  Genki is known for their crepes so I expected their crepes to taste just as good as a standalone regardless of the additions of ice cream or whipped cream. \n\nI won't go out of my way for Genki again.

I've come here several times for the crepes and the quality really depends on the person making it. I've had great fluffy crepes and then I've had extremely dry thin crepes that break apart. So, every several months or years when they get new people, the crepes change again. I suggest you get the ice cream crepes because they usually are alot better than the ones with just fruit and a random topping. They used more batter for the ice cream crepes so it can hold together, so you usually don't end up with that super thin crepes.\n\nThe grocery store portion of genki's is awesome. They have all these asian snacks and even cosmetics.", "author": "Cecile S."}

I will give this place 2.5 stars. \n\nAfter our little Asian adventure to My Tofu House, my friend and I were driving through Clement Street and saw a fairly large crowd gathered outside. She mentioned that she read that this place was highly reviewed for its crepes, so being yelp snobs, we decided to immediately park and check it out. \n\nWe both were craving green tea ice cream, and ordered a plain crepe with just the ice cream. I figure, if the place is THIS good, it should be able to perfect the crepe.\n\nFirst of all, there were many people that got their complex orders of nutella, banana, caramel, nuts, whatnots before we did, even though they ordered long after us. What the heck is up with that? I just wanted a freaking scoop of green tea ice cream in a crepe. Is it that much to ask? At least there were a bunch of asian things that kept me occupied while we were waiting for our order. I completely forgot about all these Asian snacks that I used to eat as a kid--this place brought me back to my ROOTS. \n\nAnyways, our crepe and ice cream combo finally came and they placed it in a to-go cone shaped paper concoction. Aren't crepes supposed to be soft? Well it was crispy, and it almost felt like I was eating a taco shell. Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating regarding the taco shell comment, but this ain't RIGHT. Ice cream was delicious. Definitely hit the spot, but for such a highly reviewed crepe place, one would think the crepes would be amazing. However, it is not.

Being the dessert person that I am, it was a must to grab something sweet after dinner at King of Thai.  We decided to try Genki Crepes, which was just a few doors down.  I soon realized it wasn't a very bright idea to go there late on a Friday night as the line was out the door and wrapped around the store, but I figured it must be worth the wait... and boy, was I right.  \n\nI ordered a vanilla ice cream crepe topped with strawberries, bananas, and their home-made whip cream.  The first bite was orgasmic.  The softness of the ice cream and fruits balanced out the crispiness of the shell (the bottom gets a bit soggy as the ice cream begins to melt, but is still delicious) and the whip cream had just the right amount of sweetness.  The best part is that they put the fruits at the bottom as well (but it seems as though they have been a bit stingy with their fruits recently). \n\nThe portions are definitely worth it for the price of about $5.  The ice cream crepes are big enough for two people to share, especially after a filling dinner.  Be sure to bring cash because the store only accepts credit cards for purchases over $10.  The only other downside is that there is no place to sit besides a bench inside and a couple of chairs outside.  We found ourselves having to stand up and eat. \n\nLiving in San Francisco for the past two years, I have never been let down by the crepes at Genki.  The only suggestion that I have is to ask for a sample of the ice cream before they put it in the crepe.   I must have had a bad batch of the vanilla ice cream because it tasted more like yogurt.  Definitely recommend this to any one have a craving for sweets and are in the Richmond district.  You will not be let down.  Oh, and don't mind the line... just have someone wait in line for you, while you browse through the yummy Asian snacks =)", "author": "Mary Rose L."}

I got the crepe with vanilla ice cream and strawberry and nutella. \nThe crepe was delicious... it was a perfect balance of chewiness and crispiness in the crepe, plus a very generous amount of fillings. I like that they weren't stingy with the nutella like some places can be, so it was extra hazelnutty. (: I think it was better than the crepes I had in Harajuku earlier this year.\nThe only thing I thought was kinda gross was the fact that the cashier was using Elmer's glue to glue the paper cones that hold the crepes. Ugh... at least it's non-toxic.", "author": "Jen T."}

We waded through a group of asians to get to order and wuickly decided on a crepe with mango ice cream, strawberries, and whipped cream. We also ordered peanut butter egg puffs which came out to just about $9.  We walked around the cute little store while we waited for our food and  after about 10 minutes we were walking out with a nice warm crepe and a bag full of egg puffs.  \n\nMy gf and I started eating the crepe as we walked along Clement and the first thing i noticed was that the edges were super crunchy and not in the good crispy way,  but the burned crunchy style.  I figured that it was okay since the center was my favortie part anyways, but when we got to the center the crepe was too soft.  It felt like it was undercooked. Oh well i thought i still have egg puffs.  I opened my bag and I felt as if i must have wronged the people making my food because the egg puffs were horrible. Not a single one had the egg shape and they were all burned.  The \"eggs\" weren't even closed and the center was hard and crispy. It was like eating a fortune cookie, a tasty peanut butter fortune cookie, but a fortune cookie.  \n\nMaybe we just went on a bad day, but Genki you really need to teach your workers to not burn everything they touch. And to whoever i angered at Genki's I'm sorry for whatever i did just please don't make me eat anymore of your burned desserts, I promise I'll be good.", "author": "Domingo D."}

If you've never had a crepe fall apart in your hand, imagine watching your life's work splatter all over the pavement and your shoes. Then imagine stepping on your dreams.

You can get fast and delicious savory and sweet dessert crepes here and while you wait, you can also browse and shop for more delicious Asian treats in their grocery aisles!\n\nMy fave savory crepe has got to be the turkey and spinach with jack cheese and to satisfy my sweet tooth it's got to be the ice cream crepe with vanilla ice cream, nutella, and mixed fruits (bananas, strawberries, and pineapples) topped with fresh whip cream made in house! I also request that they add almonds as well. Just typing this up is making me want one and I just had one over the weekend.\n\nParking sucks here but I always somehow end up finding a spot--near or far, I don't mind the trek for that crepe!\n\nWarning for those that have never eaten a crepe by hand--it can and will get messy! The savory crepe tends to leak their juices at the bottom of the paper holder so I tend to fold the point up and wrap it with a napkin. And as for the ice cream crepes, I suggest you grab more than a few pieces of napkins and attack the filling first with a spoon. Once you've gotten deep enough, it'd be safe to finally take a few bites of that crunchy crepe smothered in Nutella! This is wisdom I've acquired after years of practice at Genkis.\n\nI've been so consumed by my obsession of crepes that I'm ashamed to say that I've totally neglected the rest of the snacks they also offer which include egg puffs and tapioca milk tea and then some. Something that a large group of people ordered simultaneously the last time I was there was hot milk tea which sounded really good since it was a really cold day. So I've decided to try something new next time I visit which won't be far from now.\n\nAnother tip, if you really need to use the restroom, the staff there would be nice enough to let you use their private one. not many grocery or corner stores would be that nice!

I love sweets and I love crepes, so I was pretty excited about getting Genki since I tend to really love Japanese interpretations on foods (check out Mochilato in Irvine I think... Halo Halo and Shaved Ice are dunzo)\n\nOverall, I thought this place was OK. The service was insanely fast, which was impressive considering the line was long but the turnover was quick. \n\nThe Lychee Custard was OK. The custard provided an extra creamy contrast to the ice cream... though I think I would rather get Lychee Ice cream from Polly Ans or Mitchells. They don't give you much. \n\nThe Vanilla Ice Cream w/ Nutella was good. Lots of Nutella, but not too much ice cream. Again, BiRite, Humphry Slocom, or Mitchells would have been a better option.\n\nThe Cheesecake was meh. If you want a cheese cake, get a cheese cake... it costs the same per slice. The novelty of this wore of quickly. It was nice because it was portable, but its not like I'm going to eat cheesecake on the run.\n\nI think what failed me was the crepe batter. It was thinner than I am used to and was too salty for a dessert crepe (and I like salted caramel and bacon chocolate). I liked how it was crispy on the edges, but it was overcooked throughout. It was almost like eating a slightly soft but salty fortune cookie.

They have crepes and eggettes in the front and in the back is a tiny little Asian 7/11 with snacks, drinks and toys. I go there not to shop but to eat some crepes. The dessert crepes are good but can be a little dry and crunchy if you get them by themselves. So what you need to do is get the ice cream with it to counter balance the dry crepe with some creamy goodness. Eggettes were a little crunchy and hard here as well, maybe it has something to do with the batter they use or how long they cook the food but regardless its not good that way. Haven't had a savory crepe from here but maybe if I go back I'll try it and see if its better but I've definitely had better.", "author": "Jeromy G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-22", "description": "I've heard lots of good things about Genki Crepes, but I have to say I'm not impressed. I'll admit their dessert crepe is tolerable but definitely nothing special.\n\nCONS\nOverall, I have more cons about this place than pros. For one thing, it's so hard to find parking on Clement St. (even at night). Second, the line for Genki Crepes is extremely long. Third, even though the line moves at a decent pace, there's only one bench inside to sit on (seats about 3-4 people) and has no other tables or chairs to use to eat. Not only is there no sitting space, there's hardly any standing space as well. Everything in this place is so closely packed together that waiting customers have to stand outside in the cold. When the line gets long, people start waiting in the aisle space, making it all the more difficult to walk through the already narrow aisles. Fourth, in terms of the crepe itself, it's very tough and difficult to eat--I was literally gnawing on mine like a beaver chewing wood. \n\nPROS\nEven though the crepe itself doesn't taste good, at least the ice cream and toppings are good. My crepe was very simple and only had vanilla ice cream and bananas inside (can't go wrong with a classic, right?). The ice cream tasted fresh and so did the bananas. Another good thing about this place is that even though customers have to wait quite awhile for their crepes, at least there's aisles full of little goodies and trinkets to look at during that time (items that look like they belong in a $0.99 store but are items that people actually use or eat). I found some Ramune drinks in the food/drinks aisle, some velcro patches for hair (used for bangs) that I actually currently own, some bathroom towels/shower caps/soap/etc., some deep conditioners and shampoos from Asia (a couple of which I own as well), and a myriad of other things. These items are priced about the same as any other place that would sell them, so there's no dire need to buy any the non-food items there.\n\nSUMMARY:\nIf you can, go somewhere else to get your crepe (like Sophie's Crepes in Japantown!). I still have yet to try a savory crepe from here, but I have no inclination to ever come back here.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

The crispiness of the crepe paired with the smooth texture of the 3 fillings was amazing, and the light sweetness of the custard coupled with the creamy caramel was fabulously decadent. I was nervous that they would put too much custard in (which makes me feel fat for eating it) but it was perfect. \n\nThe only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there's not really any place to sit besides a couple of benches that are often crowded by people standing and waiting for their crepes, and one time they forgot the caramel.

Well if you are in San Francisco's Inner Richmond District definitely wander into Genki Crepes. We've been snacking here since it opened and the sweet crepes are good. We enjoy ordering a mix of fruity (lychee, stawberry, kiwi, bananna, tutella, ice cream) crepes. Genki Crepes are particularly enjoyable on a sunny day wandering Clement, Golden Gate Park, and the Lake Street areas. \n\nADVANTAGES:\n+ Quick turn around time. Less than ten minute wait (good) and you can peruse the marked up Asian goodies available if it tickles your fancy.\n+/- Portions are decent but not great. This is not a meal and only a snack/ desert, so the smaller portions is acceptable. \n+ Crepes are crispy and lightly golden brown. Depending on how much you customize your crepe (e.g. filled w/fruit or ice cream) it can get really soggy fast, so plan to eat quickly too.\n\nDISADVANTAGES:\n- Prices need to be more competitive especially since for the same price down the street, you can get a meal. If you are on a limited budget reconsider visiting often because this is definitely a luxury.\n- Does not accept credit cards for purchases under $11. This practice is actually illegal.\n- Crowds happen on weekends especially at night. Plan visits accordingly.\n- Extremely limited seating. For people who need to sit while eating, there is only a bench inside and sometimes a table w/chairs outside.\n\nFinal 10 cents: Genki Crepes is a nice to have \"treat\". Very tasty and a nice desert or mid-day snack to cheer you up. Portions are decent, but watch your wallet; the costs keep creeping up w/all the \"extras\" especially if you have a major sweet tooth.

I'm from Austin which has a lot of crepe stands/trailers..but Japanese crepes is where its at! and none of the places in Austin have the Japanese-style ones :(\n\nand I have to say, the Crepes here are soooooo good..my fave kind to get is one with Nutella, bananas and whipped cream..mmmm....\n\nI actually went to Tokyo recently, and had a couple crepes there, but even though they were much more elaborate than the ones here at Genki, I actually enjoyed the Genki ones a little better because of the consistency of the crepe itself, which is more crunchy, the Japanese ones I had were much much softer, and once the crepe got colder, eating something cold and soggy isn't as enjoyable as something not so soggy. I like crunchy..if you prefer super-soft crepes, Genki may not be for you..also, I really like Nutella..that hazelnut chocolate spread is much tastier than just regular chocolate syrup, which is what the Japanese ones used. So its really more about personal preference.\n\nThey also have pretty good bubble tea..Avacado Milk with pearls is delicious..so creamy and avacadowy....\n\nSo if you are in the area, and are craving a good Japanese crepe check this place out!", "author": "Alex L."}

When you've had authentic French crepes straight from France, you'll have a hard time comparing. \n\nConsistency, consistency, consistency. I think what sets Genki's apart from other crepes I've had is it's crunchy texture. My sister and I agreed that authentic crepes are doughier. Taste wise (crepe dough), I'm not a fan. If anything, it's their ice cream and various toppings that will have me coming back. The vanilla ice cream is bomb. I have a thing for ice cream that keeps its consistency. Genki's ice cream does just that. I tried the chocolate cake crepe and the vanilla ice cream and strawberries crepe, topped with fresh whipped cream. Pretty good toppings! Chocolate cake is delicious! One good thing about the crepe, it kept my toppings in-tack (mess free!) I look forward to trying their savory crepes on my next visit. Prices of the items on the menu are pretty affordable. Lastly, they have boba drinks on their menu. \n\nGenki's is a crepe place and Asian mini-mart. They have loads of quirky Asian things. When there's a long time for crepe orders, strolling the aisles for hi-chews, every Asian drink, candy, chips, etc. you can think of, passes the time just fine. There isn't a lot of seating (tables & chairs) but just benches up front. It gets packed and movement inside can be impossible.\n\nParking on Clement is a pain.

I chose lychee because for some reason, the thought of a tortilla with a spread of pinto beans popped into my mind when I thought about crepes and red beans. So, lychee it was.\n\nThe crepe came out perfect! For those of you who likes crispy crepes, Genki is THE place for you to go. The crepe itself was thin and crispy from top to bottom, whereas some places the crepe gets all soggy by the time you reach the bottom of it. I've had better green tea ice cream elsewhere and they only gave me 3 lychees. Pretty skimpy if you ask me. \n\nService was ehhh, ok I guess. I asked the lady at the cashier if I can substitute the ice cream and she flat out said no with a \"don't fcuk with me\" look on her face.

This turned out to be much too sweet for my liking and was a great crepe shell, but a store-bought inside with canned pineapple and ice cream.  However, for the price and the satisfaction of the bf, it must've been OK or better.\n\nThe stars come off for my drink.  I understand this is a crepe place, but the drink menu does take up half of the menu board, so they should be decent... even the most obscure of choices.  I choose a green tea latte milk shake.  This turned out to be a light green, slush-like, non-sweet concoction of chalky milk powder-tasting something or the other.  It may have been my choice of drink, but others in the store did seem to like the drinks they'd ordered --I saw a coffee/mocha milk shake and sesame one which did in fact LOOK like a milkshake should.  Probably should ONLY stick to the crepes here.\n\nOn the other hand about atmosphere, this place offers other trinkets (cell phone accessories, car air fresheners I thought I only could buy in Japantown, convenient store merchandise, and a WIDE assortment of Japanese snacks).  Service is quick and polite --there are a lot of workers (counted 6 in the rather small workspace on a Friday night around 9:30pm) to help expedite the food delivery.  \n\nSo finally, after some contemplation, I'll have to put one star back on for the crepe itself.

Genki provides all the necessities: crepes, egg puffs, boba, all kinds of cutesy Asian snacks, and lots of cold drinks. But don't try to buy the mushrooms, eggs and other produce at the corner of the refrigerated section. Those are for the crepes. Good to know they are using fresh ingredients! \n\nSo the Genki crepes are not the soft, fluffy kind which is what I prefer but they're still delicious in its own crispy, fresh, made to order way. Yes, there are places that pre-make their crepe skins. Blah! I think the prices are also very reasonable. You could be paying a lot more for a crepe that's half as good. Our late night munchies were:\n\nLychee & nutella crepe ($3.50) - Sweet on top of sweet. Give it to me! \n\nCheesecake, whipped cream & blueberry sauce crepe ($4.75) - The cheesecake slices aren't super thick so you don't just get a mouthful of cheesecake. These aren't original flavors but in crepe form, they're somehow tastier and even more fun to eat!\n\nWe finished those pretty quickly and started eyeing a savory crepe... Okay okay, just one more and we'll make it healthy. One spinach, mushroom, & cheese crepe ($4.75) coming right up! What I love about Genki is that they always make sure the placement of the ingredients are well spread out so you always get a bite of everything when you chomp down.

It took no longer than 10 minutes for my group and Me to get our orders, and we happily made our way to the sidewalks of Clement Street to avoid the never-ending line that formed outside of this mini-mart..that sells crepes. Munching on our tasty Nutella-filled desserts, which by the way are messy but in a good way, we watched the employees of this mart make more crepes as we looked in from the outside. \n\nThey also sell fresh smoothies and snack crepes, which are crepes filled with real food such as chicken, beef, or whatever you choose from their list. \n\nAbsolutely messy, absolutely delicious, and absolutely worth it all.

We stopped at Genki Crepes in the Inner Richmond to satisfy our craving.\n\nThe scene:\n\nGenki Crepes is a mix between a grocery store and a dessert spot. They have a little something for everyone - crepes, boba drinks, egg puffs and ice cream. They've got an impressive assortment of imported chips and candy from all over Asia. I copped a few unusual flavors of Kit Kat bars that I've never seen before. The packaging is completely in Japanese, but it looks like the flavors might be coffee and chocolate mochi.\n\nThe food:\n\nFor egg puffs and a crepe, the total came to $4.50.\n\nLemon Sugar Crepe - I wanted something light, so I overlooked the chocolate ice cream and cheesecake crepe for the lemon sugar. The crepe was thin and crispy, but soft enough so it didn't crack and fall on the floor. It was very lemony and it had just the right amount of sweetness.\n\nEgg Puffs - The egg puffs were much different that others I've had at other dessert places. Usually, each egg puff has a huge pocket of air, but not these. They were dense, chewy and crispy. The only downside was that it was a little cold by the time we got it.\n\nI'm definitely coming back to try their other crepes. The cheesecake one sounds delicious, but I'd probably have to skip dinner to eat that one.", "author": "Sam L."}

Rush up to the counter and get ready to dig into the delight. Crunchy on the outside with all the goodness packed in. Went the standard strawberry, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream route. They make the whipped cream fresh and get their ice cream from elsewhere. \n\nNothing like the pleasure of crepes on a cold night. Price is right, and you can always eat more than three.", "author": "Ryan G."}

I like my crepes crispy on the outside, not soft and that is surprisingly difficult to find. I really like the Nutella and Vanilla Ice cream crepe. However, if you ask for strawberries as an extra topping, prepared to get 1 strawberry cut into 3 slices for .50 cents.

From candy to snacks to sweets to little keychains/toys to spices/sauces to drinks. So cute, I wanted to try and buy everything! But I only came here for one thing, and the only thing that I've been longing to try here...Crepes!  \n\nStrawberry, Green Tea ice cream, and Nutella Crepe: Under ice cream crepes, they only had mango ice cream and strawberries (I wanted this fruit only), which I substituted the mango ice cream for green tea. Added nutella and asked for my crepe to be extra crispy. The crispy crepe was indeed crispy like an ice cream cone, which I liked. I hate it when my crepe becomes a soggy mess towards the end with crepes from other places. 3 halves of fresh strawberries were on top and I found more thin slices on the very bottom covered in Nutella. \n\nThe only con that prevented me from finishing my crepe to the end was there was too much Nutella to the point where it was delicious at the beginning, since it was warm and gooey. With the ice cream and extra crispy crepe, the nutella morphed into a hardened mess. Which I had to sadly say Bye-Bye to for my bottom half of my crepe. The BF's strawberry ice cream and kiwi nutella crepe was good too, but he ended up tossing the bottom of his too. I think it's a sign that I sadly need to SHARE a crepe. No way!  I'll just make sure to say less nutella (drizzle instead of spreadin' it, fo shizzle!).\n\nP.S. They sell Smart Water here too. My savior from being like the peanut butter licking dog in the \"Got Milk\" commercial, but in my case...substitute it with NUTELLA! My crepe was pretty damn good though.", "author": "Tracy T."}

My favorite is the #1 snack crepe with strawberries, whipped cream, vanilla ice cream and nutella. It does not take long at all for your order to be prepared. The look of the crepe is very appealing and the taste is even better. The shell has a nice and crispy texture, the whipped cream and nutella are put in different places, and it is all wrapped up nicely. For me, it gets better as I finish because the bottom becomes soft and rich with whipped cream which adds even more flavor to the amazing crepe.\n \nGenki is a great store to grab a quick and filling dessert.

The gelato? For Crepes I like to go to French places and for gelato to italian places... if not for any other reason, but that it's just higher quality. Put low quality ice cream and low quality crepes together and what do you get? Nothing of note. \nThe flavors are original (at least compared to french and italian places), and it's a nice pit stop to stock up on haichu after a big dinner at Brothers Restaurant, but it's not really worth it just to go there.

However, to my disappointment they've been shut down now for some time. They also had a small convenient store with your typical asian drinks, snacks, and treats.

What makes Japanese-style crepes different from French crepes? I don't really know - it wasn't me who had them in Japan. But from what I can gather, the primary difference, aside from different types of fillings, are that Japanese crepes are crispier, and possibly less spongy and eggy.\n\nI had the beef sukiyaki crepe and the cheesecake and blueberry sauce crepe here. I really enjoyed the beef sukiyaki crepe - I found it very flavorful and unexpected. However, what I didn't love was the cheese to beef ratio - it was too cheesy, which I didn't feel went well with the beef. An easy solution though, next time I will just ask for little or no cheese.\n\nI found the cheesecake with blueberry sauce crepe delicious as well. However, the reason this review gets a 4 star review is because in between the ordering of the beef sukiyaki crepe and the cheesecake crepe, a massive line formed at Genki. The crepe dude got really overloaded and was very inconsistent with the amount of time he let each crepe sit on the heat. I was watching him make the crepes through the window, and when our crepe was cooking, he took the opportunity to wipe down the other crepe machine and do a bit of cleanup. It was probably no more than 30-60 seconds extra, but it caused our crepe to be WAY too crispy, especially in comparison to our perfectly cooked first crepe. The edges were cracker-crispy, and I could only think of how much more delicious it would have been had the crepe been cooked properly.\n\nI will definitely go back, but will try to order at a less busy time!", "author": "danae c."}

It had over 400 reviews so I figured this had to be the spot. It was a block away from where I was eating dinner. Perfect!\n\nWhoever thought up the idea to eat ice cream from a crepe shaped like an ice cream cone is a genius. I love the selection of crepes - ice cream, savory & snack crepes. They also have tons of drinks. This place also happens to be a Japanese mini-mart full of asian snacks, candy and stationary. SCORE! If I lived near here, I could see myself hitting this place up when I have the \"munchies\". LOL. This is a stoner's paradise.\n\nI had the red bean ice cream with banana and my partner had the lychee ice cream with red bean paste.

(note to self: next time at the asian grocery store, buy lychee ice cream)\n\nI'm glad I don't live so close to this place or else I'd really be a fat ass.

When asked about the price, I was given a nudge with no price change. As for the banana/nutella crepe, it's usually a crepe slathered with nutella, folded with ice cream and banana barely thrown in the middle. Half way through the crepe, there really isn't much to look forward to. At time, whoever is working at the register has the worst mood.

So good that I used to double park my car (when I had one; I could deal with having a car when I lived out in the sunset) and risk getting a ticket.", "author": "Natasha P."}

As soon as I some some guy holding a giant crepe in his hand scooping chunks out with a spoon, I knew what I wanted for dinner. I was in the neighborhood after visiting my preferred Chinese Doctor to buy food for my wife's lunch tomorrow at King of Thai Noodle House. After ordering her ground pork Larb, I rushed over to Genki Crepes next door to see what they had to offer.\n\nWhen I used to drive up to the Clement area on a regular basis to visit my grandma and run errands, I always walked pass Genki Crepes and smelled the crepe aroma from the walkway. I never had the urge to pop in as I did today. There were a lot to choose from including Sweet, Savory, and Ice Cream crepes. Since I was yearning for something simple, I picked #12: Ham, Pineapple, and Mozzarella Cheese Savory Crepe for $4.75, $5.20 after tax. While freshly made to order, it took at least five minutes to make. As I was waiting for them to call up my number, I took a look around the store in the back and saw a lot of Chinese and Japanese candies and snacks. I know my wife would go crazy here and buy one of each of everything. I'm glad she wasn't with me today. Whew!\nWhen they called my number, 32, I got my crepe and it was huge! I could clearly see Ham and Cheese poking out of the crepe. I'm used to eating crepes in a restaurant and this was a new concept for me. It was like holding a flat snow cone because the thin white cardboard was in the shape of a snow cone but maybe five times larger. Sorry I couldn't take a picture, but it was almost pitch dark in the streets  =(\n(Next time!) With my crepe in hand, I went back to the Noodle House and retrieved my take-out order. When I walked in, virtually everyone was staring at me, not just because I was a dashingly handsome guy, but because I was holding this absurdly large crepe in my hand. I grabbed my food and left in a hurry. \nYou really can't go wrong with a Hawaiian style crepe. The crepe was crispy on top and juicy inside. The only juice that squirted out was towards the end when I took it out of the cardboard shell and proceeded to finish it off. Luckily, the cardboard opened up to make a nice little flat dish for protection from unforeseen mishaps. Ham, pineapple, and oozing cheese in every bite. To make this crepe more authentic and perfect in every way, I would suggest a marinara dipping sauce. Totally Delish and definitely a Quick Bite! \n\nGenki Crepes is truly recommended if you're on the run, want to devour a good tasty crepe, and comes with a really affordable price. I can't wait to go back and try something different soon!", "author": "Hogan W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-18", "description": "Good Lord, I had such a massive sweet tooth today. I had literally texted 10 friends inquiring about any local hole-in-the-wall that offered chocolate desserts, with generous portions, and at a reasonable price. One of my homegirls referred me to this spot. I live on the southern tip of the city, mind you, and this place is located aalll the way on the other side of town. I knew I was about to have one of those \"Harold and Kumar\" moments, except not as dramatic nor such a lengthy, hard toiling odyssey.\n\nIt took me approximately an hour and a half to get there (this is within San Francisco on Muni and Bart so it's not that bad). I took the 14 up Mission, sitting at the back of the bus with the local \"wanksta's\" giving me the casual mean mug. A normal person probably would've been sweating his thighs out due to paranoia or just the simple thought of the person next to me, whose all tatted up, concealing a glock nine or how the Nortenos call it, a \"filero.\" But no, not on this day, not at that moment, surely not with this bold, salivating man on a mission. I just looked at the fellow, gave him the samoan eyebrow raise and turned my eyes towards the window, deciding to enjoy the view. Hahaha, lil kid. Next...\n\nSo I finally end up at 24th and mission, and quickly paced pass the panhandlers, the homeless, and the druggies and dashed down the escalators towards Bart. Hop on Bart, doze off a lil bit, and hop right off at Powell Station. I walk up the escalators right in front of Forever 21, and WHOA, whaddya know, there's some \"turf\" dancers who came aaalll the way from Oakland just to perform their lil' sideshow for all to see. What a treat. I showed some love by dropping a dollar in their money box, HOLLAAAA!!!! Btw, if you're into seeing this young kids showcasing their amazing talent, be sure to walk through this area. Anyhoo, I proceeded towards my goal as I walked up a few blocks to Geary. Waited a a few minutes for the 38, hopped on, and headed westbound towards my heavenly destination.\n\nThe 38, smh, is always crowded. Folks rubbing up on each other heck you don't know whose hand is rubbing your butt on this line, lol, yes that's how crowded it is. Yet all I can think of was my blind date with this mysterious crepe. So I didn't mind the unintentional back rubs (at least I hope they were unintentional eww). 20 minutes pass and I hop off between 4th and 6th. Anxiety-stricken and my heart rate rapidly increasing with every step I made up the block towards Paradise.\n\nAs I approach my destination, I see two asian cats eating what looks like waffles cones with blobs of ice cream on top. I'm like, \"Hell yeah, this must be it.\" I walk in to Genki's and am suprised to find that it's actually a market of some sort but the crepery is at the entrance on your left. Funny thing is, I pratically bogard my way past folks to get to the cashier hella hyped and abruptly startled her saying, \"I'd like to order please.\" She saw the urgency and so took my order, \"Yes, a chocolate cake crepe with ice cream and throw the hershey syrup on top.\" \"Are you sure?\" she asked. \"That's an additional 2 bucks for what you're asking.\" I gazed at her with the eyes of a tiger as if I've never been so serious in my life, \"Just throw the damn thing on there will you!\" I shouted. Nah nah nah, Hahaha just joking. I was nice, no seriously I'm a nice guy folks. She completed my order and I sat on the bench against the wall, number in hand, patiently waiting . Finally, she calls my number, and my date, this chocolate cake, soft, hot, vaniila filled, wet hershey syrupy crepe makes her entrance and I'm just salivating, anxious full of anticipation. I grab her with ecstacy and just lay my fat samoan lips on her as we make out for the first time. I don't want to go into any more intimate details, all I have to say is that I walked out that day devirginized. Lol. Mind you, the cashier who took my order was staring at me the WHOOOOLLLE time either because she's never seen a Samoan, never seen anyone eat so enthusiastically (or with a countenance that conveyed a near orgasmic experience), or just had never seen a Samoan or anyone for that matter devour a crepe cone so fast. (I downed this baby in 2 to 3 minutes, no lie, yes it's huge but that's how excited and hungry I was lol) I just told her, \"Hey, it's my first time here.\" She gave me that, \"you're weird,\" look hehehe. I felt like saying, \"Well, welcome to San Francisco baby!!!\" \n\n I fell in love with this place and highly recommend it for not only all you crepe lovers, but for dessert lovers as well. Oh and just for the curious mind, they do have other desserts on the menu besides crepes. Meat lovers as well.\n\n The ride back home was great and satisfying. Oh, and remember, leave the car at home, ride public transportation on your way here, you never know who or what you might run into on your way to Paradise.

I had the mango ice cream w/ strawberries and no whipped cream (dammit I should've disregarded my cough since whipped cream on top of what I was having wouldn't have made a big difference anyway). Maybe it had 3 half strawberries 5 years ago as well, but either way, they should have more!! There was a little slice at the bottom though. \n\nBut besides from them being stingy on the strawberries, they were quite generous on the ice cream part. And the flour part of the crepe was good and crispy! \n\nThis place was effin jam-packed on a Friday night. I'm guessing that's how it usually is as well, because I've seen people standing around and occupying the inside multiple times before.

You can sit at one of their lovely wooden benches (but usually these are taken) or take it out and be on your merry way. \n\nThey have other crepes - like savory ones filled with spinach, mushroom and cheese, ham and cheese, etc. (I think these are all under $5) but I always like my crepes for dessert here.

Gigi described as \"it's like a puffy crepey dough thing, perfect!\"  They also have ice cream and tapioca drinks and juices.  Genki not only sells desserts but also is a type of high end mini-mart for mostly Japanese items, like 50 SPF Shiseido sunscreen and miniature hello kitty sets, giant Pocky and the occasional bag of wasabi shrimp chips.  One more honorable mention for the crepes, my friend A. got the crepe filled with whipped cream, cheese cake (large giant triangular pieces), and blueberry topping which was fabulous and I only had one bite.\n\nGenki Crepes really hit the spot!  You might have to wait in line and wait for your order, but time passes quickly when you're trying to figure out what the new savory snack is between the Indonesian Shrimp Chips and the Toblerone in the last aisle.\n\nI love Genki Crepes!", "author": "Betty L."}

Genki is interesting with all the overpriced Asian knick knacks (seriously, go to May Wah or Ichibankan if you're craving Pocky) but I feel like their aisles of stuff is taking up precious floor space. Sure, you can wander through the aisles until they call your order number but they don't call your number very loudly. Customers usually end up crowding around the order counter and they aren't always courteous and you have to shove past them to order.\n\nThe crepes are great though. The crepe is usually crunchy around the edges, which I like as the texture contrasts with the semi-soft ice cream. I find satisfaction in crunchy food. The sound gives me a little happy rush. :P You can get a crepe with whatever ice cream flavors and fruits they have; I usually get Nutella and vanilla ice cream.

Little did I know that it wasn't what I was expecting. I ordered a hot milk tea tapioca and my date got the strawberry banana tapioca, we shared honeydew egg puffs. I put the straw in the coffee container (since the item was hot) and started sipping but ended up sucking on the straw of course to only learn that one of the tapioca balls must be stuck. So I did what most people would do, take off the top and fix the straw but as I did this I discovered there was a tea bag (chinese if that helps) that had broken inside the cup, this would explain the leaf-like material when I drank from the straw. After this scenario I went up to the girl who made the drink and asked her if the tea bag is suppose to be broken, in broken english she said \"yes, it's like that\" I begged to differ but put the top back on my cup and drank the milk tea some more, I swear it was not normal to be consuming tea leaves in this manner. \n\nGenki Crepes seriously needs new staff or changes in the way they make hot milk tea. How the hell do you expect me to drink the tea bag along with my tapioca drink?? I think the girl lied. Not to mention the egg puffs which came out deformed looking and tasted like they had been left out all day on the counter. \n\nAlthough the crepes are good, the one in japan town is still my favorite.

Judging by all the previous 4-5 star reviews, maybe I just ordered the wrong thing at the wrong time.\n\nLast night my friend took me here and hyped it up a lot beforehand.\n\nToo bad I pretty much had the worst crepe and green tea of my life. No joke. The actual crepe had a weird flavor and was very cardboard-y. I had it with green tea ice cream and strawberries. The 5 slices of strawberry were good, however the green tea ice cream was frosty and tasted like it had been sitting there for a looong time. It wasn't creamy at all, just crunchy and icy; it also didn't help that it took up 90% of the crepe. To compliment my lousy crepe was a lychee green tea with tapioca pearls that tasted like it was made from dirty tap water. \nAlso, since it's also something of a little market, there wasn't that much room for seating so we had to walk back to my car to eat.\n\nI don't see myself coming back here again, at least not by choice.", "author": "Micaela G."}

I ordered chocolate ice cream &cheesecake crepe, while my friends ordered the blueberry with cheesecake crepe & the mixed fruits crepe. They were all delicious. Way better than the other creperies I've been through. Crepes I've had before were all soft, however, Genki's were crispy &really delicious. I like how Genki's is also a mini mart with toys & treats from Asia. But I really wish that they have a bigger seating area; there's only two benches inside & a bench outside. Overall, I will be coming back to try the rest of their menu.", "author": "BrendaJoy G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-09-15", "description": "Being the mother of an eight year old son is, in many ways, like being a factotum to a slightly potty dictator.  One must cajole and coerce Number One Son to do most anything not Star Wars-related (slowly slowly catchy monkey).  Now, I am not of the type that bribes (or gives in), but I do understand the benefits of well placed \"incentives\" in running a home as befits my high standards of grace and elegance.\r\n\r\nOne of the chores of life is the weekly shop.  I hate the weekly shop or, rather, I hate dragging Number One Son along with me on the weekly shop.  I hate the whining for sugary snacks and Lunchables (a pox on Oscar Meyer) and soda pop and other nasties, I hate it very much.  So, usually, we do not go where those things are sold---or at least, not in their recognizable form (see, eg, New Way Mah review).  \r\n\r\nNow, Number One Son is sometimes recalcitrant even after the promises of seeing live fish and frogs and re-upping our stock of Pocky; it is at these moments that I bring out the big guns, I bring out the Genki Crepes. \r\n\r\nThe smell hits you first-- if you are lucky it will drown out the funk from the herbal medicine/root shop---about a block away.  Like little fingers stuck inside one's nostrils pulling and pulling you inside with the delicious smell, the Genki aura is a seductive mistress... and an easy one, too.  For a nominal amount, one can have crepes most every way---thin and crisp and yummy.  Number One Son likes the Nutella crepes, I prefer the Nutella/Strawberry ones.  But Genki goes all ways---sweet and savory.  And there's more!  The egg puffs are also delicious and disappear quite quickly from the lickle paper bag they are served in.  The various juices, soda pops, candies, stickers, shampoos are fun and useful and colorful---I go here to pick up stocking stuffers and gifts for those living in less civilized areas.  The staff is helpful and friendly, the store is clean.  On a sunny morning, I love sitting outside and enjoying my crepes and, of course, Number One Son.", "author": "Nicola F."}

Once in the door you realize that it looks so busy because the counter is right inside that door and there is a wait around the counter for the crepes as this little crepe counter is in the front of a ghetto supermarket or junky looking dollar store type place. My SIL ordered an ice cream crepe and I got a sweet crepe (ok- 2 but only because my first one was so gross it got tossed and I had to do a redo thinking it must have been a one off due to all the positive reviews. I was wrong all 3 got dumped not even 1/3 through. We couldn't figure out what the draw was. The crepe itself had no flavor at all and was so dry it was almost as though the burned it on all 3 while the fillings were also bland other than the little bit of Nutella in one we had.

The green tea ice cream was rich and delicious. It tasted like the authentic green tea ice cream that only Japanese Sushi restaurants serve. My friend ordered the mango ice cream with strawberries which was even better! The mango flavor was very distinctive, you have to try it for yourself to know.

Ever since my discovery of the fact that ice cream can be put on desert crepes, I have been nearly obsessed with Genki Crepes. Nutella, Crepe, and Ice Cream are all you need for the most standard of Genki Crepes. At a price of around 5 dollars, this freshly made desert, that opens at night, is the perfect after-dinner desert. The crepes are all very good, but I would recommend nutella and ice cream to anything. Genki also offers savory crepes but I would read someone else's comment for a true review on that option. The only draw back to the crepe is that their apple cinnamon crepe does not have the option to add ice cream on it.. no matter how much you try to bribe the crepe-maker with lint from your pockets. har har. oh well. other than that, crepes combined with the option to buy a buncha teen asian candies + drinks make this place totally deserving of 5 stars.", "author": "simon k."}

My friend had lychee and green tea. \nLastly, I think am gonna bring my entire family here because their crepes tasted good and it was so affordable - $4.25!

The boba smoothies are great, thick and cold and richly fruity with perfectly chewy tapioca in the bottom.  The crepes are nothing special, but by their crepey nature are naturally delicious.  I do think Genki Crepes charges too much.  The tapioca cost extra; the crepes are around $4.  Some are more expensive.  It costs $8 to get my favorite crepe and a smoothie with boba, and that's not counting the tip I leave for quick service at a busy shop.  I still love you though, Genki Crepes!", "author": "elizabeth o."}

People are waiting outside and inside to place/pick up their orders.  I've only tried the blueberry cream cheese crepe here, but it was delicious!  The crepe itself is fluffy and crisp at the same time and everything else was not too sweet.  I gotten a hot horlick drink here before but it was tasteless, I had to add a lot more sugar to it myself.  I love coming here to stock up on Hi-Chews, the ever so addicting chewy fruity candy and seeing what new stuff toys they have.  I am obsessed with what I like to call \"tofu babies\" and anything else in its family.

Anyhow, I have noticed many people writing rave reviews of this place and I have spoken to people personally about this place etc etc. The fact that it was this place was close by, I had to try it. Yesterday, perfect day (maybe alittle chilly) walked there with my couz. I did know what to get, my mind was elsewhere and there were numerous choices (also, suffering from massive hangover did not help me decide on something). Getting back to the story, i went with the chocolate icecream/cheese cake one. Yes for those of you healthies out there, this is not the crepe for you.  I honestly did not know what to expect, i've had crepes before, but with all of those ingredients, I simply couldn't picture it. For the price it was great, this thing was f-ing huge. Tons of cheesecake, good amount of icecream and whipped cream. In all honestly maybe it was my condition, but this was overwhelming. I kind wish I had gone with a plain crepe with nutela (spelling???). Another note, I thought that this place was going to be a straight up crepe place. It's kind of a bit of everything, Walgreen's, specialty weird Asian gifts, it kind of does not know what it wants to be. Anyhow, this is just  a first review, I am assuming one more star will be added on the next time around...", "author": "Cameron R."}

That being said, this place is pretty good. I also liked the fact that you can shop around the mini market (mostly Japanese products) while waiting for your order. There are no tables to eat your crepe but you can  walk around the block and grab a decent cup of coffee at one of the nearby coffee shops.", "author": "Diana B."}

After all, I've been dying to try this place after hearing all you yelpers rant and rave.  Yelp hasn't failed me tonight.  The girl in the front took my order right away.  I opted for #24 which was a strawberry with either whipped creme or nutella.  I indulged myself by telling them to put both and it cost me $4.61 total - not bad.  There were a few folks in front of me but I got my crepe quick and I finished almost quicker.  It was pure ECSTASY!  I shall be back for sure.

It smells like warm sweet crepes and I always avoid going there because I'd rather watch people stuff their faces with crepes than eat them myself but tonight I was feeling daring and bold and so after dinner, I walked past Genki and saw the egg-puff waffle iron and decided that it was egg puffs for dessert! Walked inside and saw that there were flavored egg puffs (I've only had plain and red bean-filled) and decided on coconut. I walked around the store as I waited for my number to be called and was just admiring all the japanese snacks and gatsby hair waxes. at least this store is open  relatively late.

I was honestly surprised that anything was open that late on Clement. I just moved here about a month ago from sleepy Berkeley, where pretty much everything closes by 9. This place is fantastic! First of all, I love pretty much anything Asian, I mean, my boyfriend is half Taiwanese, and I'm hoping to produce a few quarter-Asian babies some day so that I can start identifying with my Asian roots. This place is awesome. I got a cheese and onion crepe and it was DELICIOUS. People are right about the crispiness of the crepe. So ideal, so French (although I've had much worse crepes in Paris), and from an Asian convenience store! I'm looking forward to trying the Red Bean Paste crepe next time. I also bought Red Bean ice cream, some White Peony tea, and some honey ginger crystals- all of which are delicious.

Yes, the store has all kinds of Asian imported snacks, toys, etc.,but I'm here to savor a crepe. I've tried Genki Crepes a few times, and I think it's fair to say that I don't like it. The savory crepes are too salty. The only crepe I might get again from Genki are the ones with ice cream in it - and that's if I'm in the area, with the munchies. Unlike Crepes A GoGo, I will not go out of my way for Genki's. The chicken and cheese: chicken is Salty; nicely made, but salty and the chicken doesn't taste fresh.  Tastesllike chicken that's been salted for a longer shelf life. I couldn't help but read the reviews but whatever, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I only waited to write up this review because I tried Genki's one more time before I finalized my opinion. FAIL. I don't think half of these people have ever been to a true, crepe joint. Maybe this store is in a convenient area, but i don't care; I much rather go further to get something worth the same price - and a true crepe.
