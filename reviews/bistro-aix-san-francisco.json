We were able to find parking right in front and we also got seated right away. The restaurant is casual but feel free to dress up a little if you're on a date. The restaurant has a darker lighting in the room at the front. So it feels like a candle lit dinner! Very cute! \n\nMy group of 5 was led into the room in the back. It was much brighter because they had a tree that had lights wrapped around it. Also very cute! \n\nI believe the menu changes every so often. When I dine with my grandparents, we usually share so we shared all the dishes that we ordered. \n\nSpecial menu: Foie Gras on a bed of risotto (5/5) - 5 of us shared the whole dish and we pretty much licked the plate once we finished. The foie gras was seared and just enough for the 5 of us to share. It was also very rich in flavor, I would recommend this! \nTempura Fried Calamari - (4/5) The red curry aioli was a great compliment to the calamari but I didn't realize it was curry until I re-read the menu! The asian slaw was really tasty, sweet and savory sauce in the slaw. Compliments the calamari! \nGrilled Ahi Tuna (4/5) - I really enjoyed this dish. I normally don't like Ahi Tuna but surprisingly I thought it was very good! I did think the mashed potatoes in this dish didn't complement it. The two separately were good but together is sort of weird. \nGrilled Flat Iron Steak (2/5) - It wasn't the best steak and I probably wouldn't ever get it again. This cut of meat is definitely not my favorite but the execution was good. We all definitely enjoyed the shoe string fries and even dipped it in the bearnaise. \nTagliatelle Bolognese (5/5) - MUST GET. Fresh pasta ALERT! I love fresh pasta and they did really well with this dish. The meat sauce was perfect and lots of great flavor. The amount of sauce and pasta was just enough.\nBurrata Cracker Crust Pizza (3/5) - Execution, I think was great. It's really a crispy pizza with cheese but I wouldn't get it again. It's too dry and I wish the Burrata just wasn't as good as I expected. \nCreme Brulee (5/5) - Super rich and creamy! This was not too sweet! My family loved it. \nChocolate Lava Cake (5/5) - Surprisingly my grandparents loved this too! The chocolate was a dark chocolate and it wasn't too sweet which we love! \n\nOverall, it was a great experience!

When we walked into the restaurant, there was no host or any staff available to help us. We stood around for 15 minutes, along with other groups of people, not knowing what to do. I tried to get a server's attention and she cut me off, saying that we need to wait for the host. \n\nFinally we got seated in the back patio next to the beautiful tree. I was a little sad that this place does not serve any cocktails - only beer & wine. The server also informed us that they were all out of tagliatelle and steak. Boooooo...that was literally what we were planning to order but okay, shit happens. We decided to order the tomato cracker crust pizza as an appetizer and the squid ink spagetti & pork chop as our entrees. \n\nThe tomato cracker crust pizza came out in a timely manner and IT WAS DELICIOUS. While waiting for our entrees, I asked for bread since I saw other tables eating it and they were all out of bread! At this point I'm annoyed because why are you all out of your food on a Saturday night? Poor planning on their part. We waited for around 40 min and still didn't receive our food. We were literally about to just walk out of the restaurant when they finally brought the entrees to our table 1 hour later. Totally unacceptable and we had to bring it up with our server. We finally received an apology for SOMETHING and he gave us 2 complimentary glasses of wine. Fine effort to make up for everything that went wrong. Squid ink pasta was super dry and tasteless.

Usually, this dish is a tad too overwhelming for me because of the copious amounts of butter (and sometimes cream ugh) other restaurants use to add \"flavor\" to the dish. What those other restaurants don't realize is that a good shrimp scampi is all about simplicity: well-cooked pasta, nicely sauteed shrimp, some olive oil, a little bit of butter, and an excellent white wine reduction. And Bistro Aix does this perfectly. It's rich in flavor without being rich in body. I could eat this everyday. \n\nAlso had the chance to try their Braised Duck, which was extremely tender and juicy.

Which was especially frustrating as we had tickets for a show afterwards that we now had to rush to make, despite allowing for 1.5 hours for dinner when we made the reservations. We were also hosting family from out of town celebrating my sister's graduation for her master's degree. We were all looking forward to a nice relaxing, delicious meal.  \n\nWe let the waiter know that we had an hour left for dinner. Somehow the entree portion was still served 45 minutes after we were seated (we ordered immediately upon sitting). And strangely the meat entrees (steak and burger) came a few minutes before the gnocchi dishes. We ended up rushing through dinner and paying our check as we were still eating.\n\nFood wise, all appetizers were delicious. The salads were especially great; we ordered the Little Gem and the Butter Lettuce with Goat Cheese. The guys loved their meat entrees; the Kobe Burger and Steak. \n\nMy sister and I both ordered gnocchi and it was terrible - the broth was super watery and it had no flavor. Truly, none. After dousing with salt and parm I finally sent mine back. It was also pretty disappointing that we were given a list of about 7 items that were sold out as we sat for dinner. All pizzas were sold out and they were out of french fries for the burger. Plus a number of other items that thankfully we hadn't planned to order.\n\nWe were never offered the fresh bread baskets that we noticed at every single table inside as we left the restaurant. I didn't see these at any of the back patio tables where we were seated. The patio seating is generally lovely, but this time it was a total disappointment, as we rarely saw our server, despite it not being very busy. \n\nI do want to add that the host was genuinely fantastic. He was positive and professional and helpful all around.", "author": "Lorri H."}

I find that it's usually too 'saucy.'  The octopus appetizer was excellent.  You can never go wrong w/ the ahi tuna (appetizer), but it's nothing extraordinary.  The calamari was pretty good.  \n\nI thought their fries was really tasty.  I had the halibut, it was quite good.  For dessert, I recommend the first item, the tart with the creme fraiche (sp?).  The panna cotta tasted like a breakfast yogurt - I wouldn't get that again.\n\nIt's not a cheap place, but then again, it's in-line with what other French restaurants of this caliber in SF charges.  The service is very friendly.  I don't like how they tack on a 3% surcharge for the Healthy SF (for employees' healthcare).  I don't see why that charge is passed on to customers rather than the employer (restaurant owner) paying it all.  I guess the alternative is to just increase their prices without having that extra 3% charge line item.  But this is a separate complaint; nothing to do with the food here.\n\nOur party of 5 was able to walk in on a Tuesday night around 7PM and get seated right away.

When the food was brought to the table, it seemed like the waitress served the wrong order.

I highly recommend the Smoked Salmon Appetizer and the Octopus Appetizer.  As far as entrees go; everything was wonderful.  I suggest the Chicken Breast which was so tender.  My husband had the Ahi Tuna which was good, but had a kick due to the wasabi flavored mashed potatoes.

I moved here in February from London and have tried a lot of restaurants around the city but nothing compares to here! I was walking past it in the Marina and we had to go in. There were no tables available so we were offered to wait or to sit at the bar. I do not normally like sitting at the bar but this one is great! The bar was larger than normal so you had space between other people and you can see the chefs in action cooking on a fire pit. The bar man was so nice and helped us choose our options on the menu and told us about the wine list. We had the octopus and potatoes to start and it was the best food my boyfriend said he has ever had in his life. We then had a steak and squid ink pasta, delicious! As we were sharing they split it onto two separate plates and made sure that they did not all come at the same time. There is a back room which use to be a patio but is now covered and it's gorgeous, we have already booked dinner there for next week!

I had the salad special to start -- baby kale and arugula, asparagus, marcona almonds, and goat cheese. Amazingly refreshing and a perfect portion. Veal osso buco for the main - fall-off-the-bone tender in a glaze that hinted of cherries and wood with a flavorful and simple risotto with asparagus, mushrooms, and carrots. The wine selection was great and quite reasonably priced.  The staff seemed to love their jobs and know the people who came in as often as they didn't.

My wife, myself, and another couple were roaming around the Marina sans-reservation looking for a place to eat.  After repeatedly being told of 1hr to 2hr waits, we came across Bistro AIX.  It actually looked quite busy inside, but luckily, they had an available table for 4 in the front portion of the restaurant.  (I was told that there was a large back portion but did not venture there).\n\nUnfortunately, when placing our orders, there seemed to a decent number of items that were \"out\".  I think it was 5+ items, including the Chicory Salad that our group was eyeing on the menu.  We noticed that there was only one Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e dessert remaining, so we placed an unorthodox dessert order first so as to reserve the item.  Clearly, we are big Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e fans.\n\nFor appetizers, our group shared Calamari and the Fuyu Persimmon Salad.  Both of these dishes were really good.  The Calamari stood out for me as it was served in a slaw with a drizzle spicy sauce rather than a normal serving of bowl of just Calamari and a side dipping sauce.  The combination with some veggies was great.\n\nFor mains, my wife and I shared the Gnocchi and a special for the evening, the New York Strip.  I liked both of these dishes as well.\n\nFinally, for dessert, we received our aforementioned Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which certainly lived up to all the build up that I've provided throughout this review.

We ordered two appetizers to share -- calamari and grilled pear. Both were good, though the pear felt a little skimpy. The portion of the calamari was great but I felt the taste was just ok. The kids devoured the spaghettini. I believe I heard my son say it was the best spaghetti of his life. :)  I got a tiny taste before they finished it off and it really was delicious.

We were able to enjoy a bottle of wine that we brought and the service was great. \n\nKiddo tip: As I mentioned there were other families dining during the earlier dinner time (we were there at 6pm).

Probably won't get it again. \nPork chops - came with mashed potatoes and fried kale.

While the food has always been lovely, the service has often been a mixed bag... until today.   Today, my wife and I took my father here (he was visiting from out of town).   While our own server was lovely, the restaurant got busy and we found it difficult to get her attention for some additional needs.  We finally managed to flag down a different server, but she was actively rude to us.   She repeatedly informed us in a rude tone that she was \"not our waitress\" and expressed clear annoyance that she was burdened with having to help us.  That was bad enough, but when we pointed this out to our server, there was no response by the restaurant.  No one came to our table to apologize.  Nothing.   Save yourself the frustration.  If you want a nice evening, do not dine here.  The food may be good, but it does not make up for the pattern of bad service.  Clearly, management at this restaurant does not make customer service a priority.", "author": "Jeff M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-13", "description": "Absolutely love Bistro Aix! Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco.\n\nIt's truly a hidden gem in the Marina. You can sit outside and people watch when the weather cooperates, dine at the bar, or enjoy the back atrium with table and bench/booth seating around the beautiful olive tree.\n\nThe food is fantastic - fresh, consistent, delicious, perfectly cooked, and really offers something for everyone. I highly recommend the beet salad, spaghetti, risotto, steak (substitute the fries with mashed potatoes, you won't regret it!), cheese plate (either for dessert or as an appetizer), and the tarte tatin for dessert. \n\nService is always great. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, and not too nosy or talkative. We've dined there with groups of 2 all the way up to 12 and have never had any qualms about the service, getting orders wrong, or things taking too long. They're always accommodating too and I usually have no problem getting a table for 2 as a walk-in on busy nights (Thu-Sat).\n\nAs for price, Bistro Aix is honestly quite reasonably priced for the food, service, and atmosphere that you get, especially vis-\u00e0-vis other restaurants in the neighborhood like Delarosa and A16. Dinner for two can range from $50 to $100+ depending on whether or not one orders appetizers, drinks, and or dessert.\n\nLastly, the atmosphere is really what makes this place. It's always busy but never too noisy, cozy but not cramped, romantic/intimate but not dark, and the decor and design are beautiful.\n\nOverall Bistro Aix is fantastic - great food, atmosphere, service, and value. 5 stars.\n\nA few other tips and notes: while it's always busy, reservations and walk-ins aren't too hard to come by, no matter the size of the group, they don't take Amex, they're closed on Sundays, and if you're looking to have a nice, relaxing dinner away from the trendy, crowded, Millennial-filled restaurants of Chestnut and Union then Bistro Aix is a great option.", "author": "Brendan C."}

Romantic, warm and a bit modern.  \n+  Wine list.  Superb.  Entre Deux Mers for $7.50 a glass?  Dope.  They even had two decent beers on tap (Radeberger Pils and something local).\n+  Menu - Diverse, creative, and interesting.  It made it hard to pick what to eat.\n+  Service.  Our server was awesome.  Friendly, helpful and let us take our time.  Awesome.\n+  Grilled Octopus Appetizer - $14  Boom, Pow, get in my belly!  It was wonderful, had a nice texture and wasn't chewy at all.  The roasted potatoes and arugula worked well with it.  Damn fine.\n\nThe Good:\no  My grilled leg of lamb had great flavor but about half the pieces required some serious chewing.  At $22 I was happy with the amount of lamb I received, and the potatoes were tasty, but I would have hoped for a bit better slicing.  The grilled outer marks had a nice crust and were the highlight of the meal.  \no  Seating.  We sat at a tall two top, which is fine, but I feel bad for the 4-top that got a direct shot of my ass the entire meal (one poor lady's head was about 12 inches away from my arse).

Pretty full (we had a reservation so no problem) and were seated on time.\n\nAmbiance was great for what the place is.  Very friendly and I ended up knowing several people there outside of the group I was dining with.\n\nThe menu looked good, reasonable prices and good selection.  However I didn't see anything on the menu that shouted \"French\".  Not a problem, just an observation.  \n\nI had a piece of grilled salmon, which I asked for medium-rare.  My t-shirt clad waiter replied that they normally cook it medium.  I politely said again I would like it medium-rare to rare.  Another person at my table also ordered the salmon and she wanted rare.  Our waiter again said they normally cook it to medium.  It was clear he really didn't want to ask the cook to go from their norm.  I find these days that saltwater seafood is pretty regularly ordered and/or cooked rare or medium-rare.  It was cooked properly and tasted good.  At $24.00 I was surprise at the portion (good) for San Francisco.\n\nEveryone's meals were good.  That's a good thing because our waiter never asked until he cleared our plates.\n\nWe ordered several desserts to share and that was painfully slow.  The ice cream and creme brulee were brought out first, but it took 10 minutes for the last item.  By that time the ice cream was pretty soft.\n\nBig selection of wine and we are winos, but we felt they were a little too proud of their wines (ie. pricey) and concluded even with corkage we'd be much better off in quality of wine for the price bringing our own.\n\nMy only real complaint and it isn't big was I'd like my waiter/server/waitperson/person to wear something besides a wrinkled t-shirt.  Okay it was gray, but still.  I can get a waiter and a cook in t-shirts in a diner.

We were initially disappointed to find out that they were out of quite a few items- bread, one of the entrees, and one of the bottles of wine we tried to order. In fairness, we did have a 9:00 pm reservation, so we were eating kind of late. I can understand running out of an entree or wine, but bread?! How does a restaurant run out of bread?\n\nAnywho, overall the food was good. As a group we ordered a few small plates, but I only tried two- the tempura fried baby artichokes, and the shishito peppers. Both were really good, especially the peppers! For an entree, a friend and I shared the crispy chicken breast, yukon gold potatoes, and green beans. The entree was good, but nothing great. I probably would order something different next time. No one else really raved about their entrees. Of course, we had to have dessert- the creme brulee and crepes. Both desserts were delicious!\n\nIf I was just grading on the food alone, I'd probably be closer to 3 or 3.5 stars. However, our waiter was great. I know it probably was annoying to wait on a group of 9 women who were coming from a booze cruise. He was super patient with all of our questions about the menu, and most importantly he kept the water and wine flowing all evening. I don't think either of my glasses went close to be empty.\n\nWith so many amazing restaurants in San Francisco, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here.

The Manager did reply to me that it is written on the bottom of the menu that you have to ask for their homemade bread, but it is complimentary.  She also wrote that maybe they were busy and ran out of bread?  No, at 5:45 pm, they were not busy as only one other table was seated in the back area where we were seated.  Definitely not too busy that the waitress could not bring us the hot water we asked for either!\n\nOK, it was our own fault for all 8 of us not seeing the fine print that you have to ask for the homemade bread!

In addition to that, there was truly a squidy tinge to the flavor - it was clear that I had transcended towards seafood heaven. \n\nThe risotto took my date back to her New Zealand days with its refreshing, oceany taste. Although she found the dish to be quite delicious, she was unable to wipe the plate clean, so I gladly devoured the rest of it.

The woman on the phone said of course and then thanked us for letting her know. Being nice is not lost in San Francisco. \n\nAfter we finally arrived, we were asked where we would like to sit. I thought that was nice. My friends and I all got the leg of lamb with the potatoes gratin. It was so delicious. The meat melted in your mouth and the potatoes had a great flavor to them with a crunchy top. We all inhaled our food. \n\nI didn't get our server's name but it was a nice woman with red hair. She was helpful when my friend asked for her opinion about entree choice and she was attentive without being overbearing to our table. \n\nFor dessert we got the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and chocolate pudding. Both desserts were amazing. I'm used to creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e being a little thicker than creamier, but I understand that various places make it differently. I loved the chocolate pudding! The chocolate pudding tasted more like dark chocolate than milky, which I don't normally go for. However, this one was the perfect topper to our dinner. \n\nOverall, we had a great experience and would definitely come back to try other entrees and desserts!", "author": "Chantalle B."}

Was looking for places to eat and Yelp steered me towards Aix.\nI went in at around 7PM on a Saturday trying to just get a table for 4, but looks like they were busy that night and had nothing until at least 8:45. I was about to give up, until the hostess said we could eat at the bar and there were two people who were about to leave which opened up 4 seats. Score! \n\nAlthough this place is labeled as a \"French\" restaurant, I do see some Italian dishes and influences. Pastas like a spaghettini and squid ink spaghetti.\n\nWe started with the tempura fried calamari served with an asian slaw. The slaw reminded me a lot of vietnamese pickled slaw and was tart and refreshing. The calamari was crispy and went well with the slaw. \nMy wife ordered the squid ink pasta and I opted for the burger. \nThe squid ink pasta was flavorful and briny, but it is on the salty side. My wife couldn't finish the whole dish because it got a bit too overwhelming. It is good, but maybe a dish to share or at least have some bread with.\nThe burger was served naked, with the lettuce and tomatoes on the side. I got the burger medium rare and they cooked it to the right temperature. It was maybe a slight bit too charred though as I tasted some of that bitterness from charred meat. Sitting at the bar, I could peek a bit into the kitchen and saw they use a wood fire grill for at least some of the dishes. \n\nThe spaghettini looked delicious and I want to try it the next time I come back.", "author": "Lan N."}

We had the grilled octopus with garlic, shallots, citrus and yukon potatoes for our starter. This was the best octopus dish I've ever had and I'm glad that we asked for recommendations on what to order because it was well worth it. For our main entrees we had the top sirloin with bernaise sauce, salad, and shoestring fries, and the seared ahi in a spicy port sauce.

We waited a few moments, just starting to wonder where our server was and then the waiter appeared, he immediately apologized for being late. Nice touch. We ordered two glasses of wine, two appies and a main to share. The waiter recommended having one appy, then the second with the main as the flavors complimented each other, we agreed to his strategy.\n\nWithin minutes the first appy (and highly recommended on yelp) of Calamari (tempura battered & served with Asian Slaw) arrived and it was excellent. Tender calamari, crisp batter, with a hint of spice and fresh slaw underneath - wonderful.\n\nAt this point my wife hit her wine glass with her elbow and knocked over half the glass onto the table, the waiter quickly arrived with towels to help clean it up. He immediately asked if she would like another glass - she declined.\n\nThe mains arrived moments later and both were fantastic. The Potato Gnocchi with Chanterelle Mushrooms, Peas & Sage Brown Butter was sublime and the Zucchini Flowers with herbed Ricotta, Fava Beans and Tomato Sauce were exceptional but the portion size was a tad small. However, the waiter was right, these flavors really complimented each other.\n\nFor dessert, my wife ordered the Blueberry & Peach Pie with Vanilla Gelato, it was okay but I am not a fan of peach pie, that aside, the fruit was fresh, the crust was flaky and the gelato was tops.\n\nAt the end of the meal when all was said and done, the waiter arrived and informed us that my wife's wine had been removed from the bill - another nice touch!\n\nOverall an excellent meal accompanied by excellent service. Bistro Aix made a great first impression and I look forward to another meal there soon.", "author": "G C."}

I highly recommend making reservations in advance, especially for large groups (though I think they refuse to accommodate any group larger than 8-9). \n\nAs for the food, I'd have to say everything I tried was superbly cooked and had great flavor and texture. I got the leg of lamb and it was absolutely DELICIOUS. I'd definitely recommend that to diners. Others at my table got the New York Steak thinking that would have the most portions, but I think my lamb wins in terms of quantity and quality of our dishes. I also got a taste of my friend's scallop dish and though the scallops were perfect, I had the same complaint that I always do with any scallop dish at any restaurant--there wasn't enough of it!\n\nI'll wrap up my review with one note about their service. Though we had reservations for our party of 8 and we arrived right on time, our table was not ready for us, and to apologize for the 20 minutes that we had to wait, the hostess gave us all a free glass of champagne!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-10-08", "description": "I was a bit disappointed at this place compared to few other bib gourmand restaurants I've been to. \n\nMy date and I were not extremely hungry so we skipped out on appetizers and went for entrees, we didn't see anything that looks amazing from the appetizers. I ordered the paccheri with Maine lobster since the Hawaiian ahi and my second choice of lamb were sold out. My guy went for the his staple, steak.\n\nWhen our entrees were served, mine looked dinky. Luckily I didn't have much of an appetite that night, otherwise I would be raging. I saw more sauce than pasta or lobster itself. I probably ate like one claw worth of lobster meat with about ten pieces of paccheri pasta. But I was more disappointed about how boring the taste and how poor the presentation were. With such large sized pasta, I would expect the lobster bits and the pancetta to be stuffed inside, so that each bite would capture the taste of its ingredients. The most I could grasp with my fork was some sauce and maybe one piece of pancetta on top of the paccheri. The sauce was pretty decent though. It did bring out that sweet flavor of lobster and adds a tang to the dish. \n\nI've also tried a bite of my date's steak. It was a bit overcooked for medium rare, which made the steak extremely dried. $20 steak? I'm not really expecting much from the steak itself than from the Chef's ability to turn his ingredients into a piece of delicious art. \n\nWe ordered desserts instead, since we skipped out on appetizers. I had the vanilla bean creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and he had the strawberry sorbet. My creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was just at the right amount of sweetness. I do taste the hint of vanilla without it being too overwhelming like next doors at Isa. Taste wise, this one is solid. Presentation wise, again I was disappointed. I was browsing the yelp pictures and saw the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e served with three star shaped cookies and some mint for decoration. I told my date, this is cute and I'm getting it! When my creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e came, it had no mint, two unequally sized star cookies with one looking normal and the other looking like Patrick from SpongeBob that lost weight in his legs. My date's strawberry sorbet looked more pleasing. It's actually pretty good. Very rich in the fruity flavors, paired with pear bits for greater texture. \n\nWith the goods and bads in the foods, I would rate this place as 3 stars. I'm dropping one for the service. My server was not necessarily rude, but emotionless and not quite helpful. He doesn't check on our table, we were out of water halfway through the meal and he doesn't seem to notice at all. Many times servers would ask if I would like a recommendation or needed help in deciding on what I want, the server doesn't really interact with us too much. Other than \"may I take your order\" and \"would you like the dessert menu?\" He's got the basic lines down but hey, if you don't appreciate our business, we're glad to bring it elsewhere.", "author": "Connie C."}

We saw Bistro Aix, and it looked inviting so we went in. We did not have a reservation, but they weren't that busy and they sat us in the back. Here's the short version:\n\n-As soon as we sat down, we noticed the few other occupied tables being waited on rather attentively by the other staff. We sat there for exactly 10 minutes before we were even offered a drink or any water.\n\n-Our drinks finally came, and we observed our waitress visit the table adjacent to us at least 3 times for things like topping off glasses of champagne, bringing the bill, discussing how to spilt the bill 5 ways because everyone was probably paying with daddy's credit card.. anyway, obviously long wait to take our food order.\n\n-So our waitress finally comes floating over to take our food order. Great. Someone else shortly after brings our food. That is all the service we had for the next 30 minutes. No, \"can I bring you another drink\" \"how is everything tasting/looking/....\" \"would you like more water?\"   Nothing.\n\n-When we were done I finally had to flag her over to ask for the bill. I sarcastically said \"I though you forgot about us..\" she said, \"oh, no, I though you were still eating....\" OK.\n\n-We paid. good thing I had cash, so we didn't have to wait. \n\n-On our way out, we observed the manager/owner/entrepreneur/boss warmly thank a party that was walking out in front of us, and wish them well. Then, he saw us leaving and not as much as a smile or anything as he looked at us and quickly looked away. Nice guy. We left with a bad taste in our mouths. \n\nSo much for the short version.", "author": "Anthony M."}

Then there are legitimate first dates.  And then second dates.  And then eventually, you realize it's getting sort of serious, and then it is time for the time honored, coming of age, \"wake up dude, you gotta do something classier than cider bar crawls and Jurassic Park 3D!\" date.  And this, my friends, is what Bistro Aix is made for.\n\nIt's equal touches whimsical (\"oh look babe, a tree is growing in the back dining room, lololol\") and romantic (I mean, the place serves red wine, does it not?).  And it's really, really, really good.  We shared the lamb in a red wine sauce (insane!), and the chicken (really solid), and some desert that I've since forgotten, but it was good.  The service was really, really awkward.  But that is basically on us, since we completely misunderstood where we were supposed to sit, and threw the entire evening's worth of reservations off.  If you have even adequate social skills and directional comprehension, you'll be able to avoid that pitfall and I am sure they will love you.\n\nBut ultimately, this is a great hidden find.

I have never been disappointed with the quality of their food or service. I recommend making a reservation to be seated in the rear dining room. The dining room has a glass roof, not a skylight but a glass roof that is the light source for a thriving Olive Tree growing in the middle of the dining room. It is so rustic and peaceful to be dining next to a large olive tree. We began our meal with a basket of warm focaccia and sour dough bread, and Burrata Salad. I always order the grilled lamb. My guests ordered Squid Ink Spaghetti , Spaghettini, and Grilled Salmon. The servings were ample enough that we all were able to sample each others entree. The presentation of my grilled lamb was fabulous. A bed of deep-fried spinach was garnished over my medallions of perfectly medium lamb in au jus with Au Gratin potatoes. The crusted cheese of my Au Gratin made every bite heavenly. Each bite of my lamb was so flavorful and tender. I could taste the slight mesquite wood smoke from the grille. I told our wait staff that one of our party had a birthday. We decided to share a serving of peach pie ala mode. Our server brought our dessert out with a lit candle. Our birthday guest was very pleased with the extra touch. The wait staff is attentive, and helpful making recommendations or describing the entrees. I would not hesitate to recommend Bistro Aix to all my friends for an enjoyable dinning experience. Parking is not easy to find so allow yourself extra time or catching a taxi or public transit. The 22, 28, and 30 buses will bring you almost to the doorstep.", "author": "Kailey W."}

Aix is is pronounced as X so that was good to know.  We were with four people and we shared everything we had all night long.  We started with the blue shrimp and butter lettuce salad.  Four our main meals we shared the ahi tuna, crab spaghetti, halibut or trout (I forget) and beer sausage.  Everything was pretty tasty and my favorite was the crab spaghetti.  As sides we got the brussel sprouts but I was too much of a fan and the red mashed potatoes but they actually weren't red at all.  For dessert we had the tartin and chocolate cake.\n\nThe atmosphere was pretty cool and had a bigger back area than I would have though.  Our service was so-so though.  We had to ask multiple times for bread while others tables were just given it without asking and our waiter never came around to ask about a second round of drinks.

When we arrived at Bistro Aix there was a line out the door. After connecting w the hostess she seated us right away in a table in the back room(this is only where you want to sit to dine in my opinion) w the tree of life. We opted out of the calamari even though every table seemed to be feasting on it. We had the cheese plate w 3 different cheeses, apple & pear & the most delicious warm nut bread that had honey dripped upon the whole plate. We also got the smoked salmon on croquettes - I felt the croquettes were too crunchy but my foodie teenagers & husband disagreed. The duck confit was absolutely devine w delicious spices - I licked the dish clean. Husband's squid pasta was spicy & truly eye appealing - squid was fresh. My boy had the lamb cooked to perfection & daughter had the gnocchi which was tiny gnocchi w sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and a light sauce. Wine selection was great w CA, Spanish & French and reasonable. Chelsea was delightful as our server, knowledgeable and friendly even in the rush. She too, kept a smile at the beginning when she had to let us know all of the menu items that they were out of - she continued the list & even longer to the table next to us when they sat.

My trust in my fellow yelpers led me to a gem. \n\nI don't think I have ever been to a restaurant that had such amazing food for such a great value. I was so happy with the food that if the bill had been twice as much I wouldn't have thought twice about the cost (which I never find myself saying). \n\nFor starters, I had the house focaccia. AMAZING. It was so good I had 3 helpings of it. I asked and they told me they bake it in-house. Damn, I wish they sold it. \n\nI had the Mesclun Green Salad With Tarragon Vinaigrette (with Warm Breaded Goat Cheese). The salad was good but it was the breaded goat cheese that made it spectacular. I swear I almost asked him to round up five more orders of the goat cheese. \n\nFor my entree I had the  Grilled Top Sirloin with Maitre 'd Butter, French Fries and Watercress Salad. It has been years since I have had meat this good for such an great value. I had it medium well and it was perfect. The portion was medium sized and it only left me wanting more. Simply amazing. \n\nFor my dessert I had the Tahitian Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee with Aniseed Cookies. I wasn't fond of the cookies (which came on the side) but the creme brulee was very good. I can't say that I can tell the difference between average and great creme brulee, but it was definitely tasty. \n\nThe tab for two with one glass of wine was around $80. \n\nI definitely suggest the $23 prix fixe menu. \n\nI can't recommend this place enough.

I have noticed over my last few visits that there is a strong \"regular\" presence which obviously speaks to the staff and the owner. Servers are chatty, friendly and knowledgeable and the attitude is casual yet professional.\n\nAs far as food goes, it's great. Simple, sophisticated and fresh. I have yet to have something that I didn't enjoy.  Some of my favorites are the roasted chicken and the halibut with the corn fondue. On top of the food, if you are at all interested in wine, you have to check out their list. It's incredible, totally reasonable and has tons of French and European bottles. \n\nI've noticed a few scathing reviews of this place, and to be honest, I don't get it. It's a small, bistro-style place with great food and friendly people. I guess if you're expecting something different then you would be disappointed, but if you come in wanting to be treated like a friend, then that is what you will get.", "author": "Emily G."}

Disappointed that the back patio was reserved for a party that night. We declined the initial table and said we'd wait for an actual one.  \n\nSoon after we were seated and immediately ordered drinks. The waiter was great offering suggestions on how to pair wine with our dishes, but the service was off throughout the meal. Had to ask for the infamous bread after our first app had arrived, and the waiter basically asked me if \"decided?\" from the bar where he was standing (a solid 5-6 steps away from our table.) He seemed really short and somewhat cold with us unless talking about wine, almost like he couldn't be bothered. \n\nThe timing of our food was really inconsistent too, we got the first app right away and then waited a fairly long time before receiving the second, and then again for the entrees. \n\nThe burrata app wasn't as exciting as I had read it would be. The pizza however was delish! Piping hot, thin crust with great texture, and a great showcase of cheese.\n\nThe salmon was also an evening favorite, the corn risotto makes me want to whip out my arborio and chicken stock.

We sat out on the back porch, which is cozy and intimate - perfect for a birthday date. \n\nWe enjoyed a bottle of wine, and started with the asparagus and fennel salad. I thought it was light, fresh, and very tasty, although not something I would necessarily rave about. For an entree I ordered the squid ink spaghetti, which I really enjoyed. It was unique and flavorful, but I can't accurately describe it beyond that. Try it for yourself! We finished off with an order of creme brulee, which also did not disappoint. \n\nThe service was ok, but not fantastic. This seemed to be a common theme on my trip to San Francisco, so maybe I'm just used to servers being a bit friendlier and attentive. Of course I don't want someone checking in and interrupting my conversation all the time, but an occasional \"how is everything?\" is generally appreciated. \n\nLastly, I found the bathroom setup a bit strange. There are individual toilets and communal sinks located in the walkway between the restaurant and outdoor patio. (If you have to fix your makeup or pop a zit, do it at home!) To me this felt a bit more like a club than an upscale restaurant. \n\nOverall, this is somewhere I would recommend for a nice date.

But this isn't about the food. \n\nThe problem was the service. \n\nAfter our entrees, we had dessert, coffee and after dinner drinks. The bill was promptly delivered and paid (around $300). We enjoyed the glow of good conversation with coffee and dessert for about 10 minutes. Then (while we were still finishing our coffee) the maitre de came to the table. She didn't exchange any pleasantries, but instead got right to the point: she grabbed a few pieces of silverware off the table and asked us \"do you need anything else?\"\n\nWe got the message -- she wanted us to vacate immediately. So we left immediately. On the way out I asked her why she rushed us.

I realized that I'm not a huge fan of Paccheri in generally though so my judgement may be swayed by that, but the dish overall just wasn't that memorable and only had a few small pieces of lobster.\n\nThat being said, the lamb was succulent and tasty as was the potato gratin that accompanied it. The salted carmel shishito peppers side dish and the bacon brussel sprouts were the stars of the show though! They were both awesome, be sure to try both if you come here!\n\nFor desert we had the chocolate cloud cake and the strawberry sorbet which were both also excellent. Looking at it go by to other tables I was worried that the chocolate cloud cake would be too heavy, but it was anything but.

While the front is dark, romantic, yet tight; the back is bright, airy, and open. The back dining room has a sunroof that lets in a lot of natural light, plus they have a tree in the center so that it almost feels like a patio. Background music plays at an average level however the overall volume is never loud.\n\nThe food is Californian with some pasta dishes. You can easily share the pasta as an appetizer or eat it primarily as your main dish. We had two salads, two pastas, and calamari for appetizer. The appetizers are good, especially the calamari. The pastas are good, cooked al dente.\n\nThe mains are properly cooked and well seasoned, but perhaps just a slight much salt. I had the lamb served over risotto. I felt the risotto could have been cooked slightly more but nothing to really harp over. There's just something missing. I don't know what it is. Perhaps a special sauce to tie everything together?\n\nI was so full from the rest of the meal I didn't dig in with the desserts. My family chowed down the desserts in no time so it's easy to recommend them. The desserts are much prettier than the rest of the food.

My fiance and I went on a weekday for dinner.\n\nThe restaurant definitely did not stick out. It was dark and did not have a huge sign up in front, so look carefully. When you go inside, it's dim as well, but not too much where you are unable to see your food.\n\nWhen we got the menu we were a bit confused. Appetizers and salads are listed under one group and we were not sure whether a salad could be eaten as a main course or was just vegetables prepared as an appetizer. The server was very helpful in guiding us through the menu, giving us recommendations and estimating sizes. We decided to do some things tapas style, which worked out well. \n\nThe appetizers were decently sized for two people. They even split the dishes without any extra cost. The menu is seasonal, but we had the octopus and fava bean/arugula/goat cheese salad. Both had excellent taste. The octopus was not chewy at all. \n\nWe also split the squid ink spaghetti, which I thought was wonderful, and the ahi tuna with mashed potato and spinach. The flavor of the spaghetti was delicate, but the texture is what made it amazing. Some sort of panko/garlic crumble just made it mouth watering. The tuna was a bit overcooked (technique is always hit or miss with tuna), however the mashed potatoes were creamy and I believe the spinach was deep fried, giving it a good crunch.\n\nLastly, we had the sorbet with creme fraiche, almonds, and cherries. Honestly, I was a bit disappointed that my fiance chose this as dessert because I always go for whatever chocolate cake there is... But OMG I AM SO GLAD HE CHOSE IT BECAUSE IT WAS AMAZING! I had expected it to be super sweet, but it was very well balanced and worked very well with the nuts, cherries, and creme fraiche. One order was perfect for two people.\n\nOverall, my fiance and I had a wonderful night out to dinner here and are so happy we came across this gem.

My dinner companion saw that as an opportunity to send the server away with his Visa card and she complied. I did not want to cause a scene, but my internal reaction was...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-04-12", "description": "This place was very disappointing, especially since it had so many good reviews.  \n\nFirst off, there was no host at the front door to greet customers, and the waiters simply whisked by us without a word.  We stood awkwardly in the doorway for about 5 minutes before we could attract someone's attention.\n\nWhen we did get seated, we ended up waiting quite a long time even for our salads to arrive.  For the price, the salads are certainly not worth it.  I do not understand how you can charge $6.50 for a plate filled only with 1/4 of a head of butter lettuce and maintain a straight face, or how you can call something a \"beet salad\" when it has less than one entire beet in it.\n\nThe tagliatelle with coq au vin was so dry that it was almost inedible.  When we informed the waiter that the chicken was overcooked, he said \"that's how all of the chicken for that dish has been cooked, so it's all going to be the same.\" ... so clearly these dishes are not made-to-order.  He replaced it with a slightly less dry, plain chicken breast... about 30 seconds later, so obviously those were pre-cooked and just sitting in the back for who knows how long.\n\nThe Ahi tuna was marginal.  While the plate was piping hot, the actual food was lukewarm, which only makes me think that this dish was also pre-cooked and carelessly warmed up in a microwave. \n\nThe waiter tried decently hard to make up for the sub-par food.  While this is appreciated, a good restaurant would not serve such low-quality product in the first place.  The one star is for the waiter, who at least understood our disappointment and provided pretty good customer service.\n\nFor these prices, there are certainly better places to eat in San Francisco that really take pride in the food they serve.

The second time (most recently) gotta give it 2 stars.\nReally rude, dark-haired hostess, who despite our reservation sat two tables of four in front of us that were walk-ins.  When I questioned why this was happening she told me we would have to wait and that the people who came in after us who said, \"Four please, we don't have a reservation...\" had a reservation and that is why you sat them all before us.  Makes a lot of sense.  If you make a mistake, apologize; don't get pissy with the customers you a.) are making wait, b.) just flat out lied to.\n   Here's a tip, if your host area gets crowded, as you walk over to perform your job ask: \"Does anyone have a reservation?\" Undoubtedly, those that took the time to call and make one, will pop up and you can sit those people first instead of making them wait 30 minutes. \nBoth times we have come here the servers all act very surly.  I don't know what it is...\nI am more of a service with a smile kinda guy as opposed to service with a side of hipster smug.  Dudes, it is a restaurant - you're not curing cancer. \n\nThese traits aside, the food is very good as is the atmosphere.  Service really screams a 2 or a 1, but because the manager was so nice the first time we went there and because of the food and vibe, it gets 3 stars.\n\nTry the squid ink pasta.", "author": "Alex A."}

The mushrooms were so yummu and flavorful. \n\nLeg of Lamb: so juicy, cooked the way I like it, flavorful. I kept finding my fork gravitating towards this plate. \n\nNew York Steak: again, just like the leg of lamb, it was cooked to my liking (medium rare). Decent\n\nThe only thing is that the portions are not as big as I would like (maybe this is why America is fat? I'm used to large portions. Thank God I work out I guess). \n\nAll in all, good food.

We ordered a nice bottle to start, and it wasn't inexpensive, and yet we were still charged the steep $25 corkage for having our own burgundy with us to enjoy after we finished the wine from Bistro Aix.

The hostess then ran out and told us that she could squeeze us in between two reservations, if we promised that we'd finish eating in an hour, and would that be ok? Most definitely! Just for her accommodating attitude, I'm adding a full star to my review. The food itself was fairly unremarkable--think Italian approach to pasta coupled with French approach to braising meats and creating sauces (think: lots of cream) and you've got the fare here. \n\nOur table ordered the farm fresh tagliatelle with coq au riesling, pumpkin ravioli, and sage brown butter sauce gnocchi. The first was very heavy, in terms of the cream sauce, but the coq was very moist, fatty, and tasty. The pumpkin ravioli was only mildly sweet, slightly spicy, and just very pleasant. The gnocchi was nicely chewy, but the sauce was a bit too oily for my taste. \n\nIn short, you won't go terribly wrong by ordering a pasta dish.

I was entertaining some older family friends, and one of them had somehow found out about this place so I went with it. We had the Asian-inspired fried calamari appetizer, which was really good. \n\nI then had the sliced steak, which was also very good I admit. The problem was the other stuff on the plate. It came with this dry leafy green, like fresh spinach or arugula. I like those but not dry and undressed. \n\nMore annoying than that was the french fries it came with. I was about to get the seared ahi, because it sounded better as a whole but my wife wanted to try the steak and order the sole for herself. So I got the steak. \n\nThe fries did not work for me. Not that they were bad but like I said, the meat was very good and the dish could have been much more memorable with maybe scalloped potatoes, mashed, or roasted red. Just something more on par with good quality meat. The fries were shoestring style and similar to what you'd get at In N Out. They weren't bad, they just didn't fit the dish. \n\nI liked the fact they had some cool beers, but only a couple are on tap. The bottled beer was going for $6-10 apiece, which is just too much if it's not fresh. Chimay might be the exception but not the others. Our waitress was also absent at times. She'd check on us and then disappear for long stretches of time. She asked us if we wanted to look at dessert menus. We said sure. They came 10-15 minutes later. Not a big deal but why not just bring them right after you ask?\n\nAlas, we are from Berkeley and have our own foodie excursions to keep us occupied without trekking this far. This place was an occasion for guests, and it went over well. It exudes that yuppified vibe of the Marina and this place caters to those folks. Fair enough. It's not a place I feel destined to return to, but I had a nice time still.", "author": "Sherry G."}

Both are interested in getting you the food for your mood. \n\nThe food:  My favorite dishes so far: Beet Salad and Tagliatelle (sp?). \nThe greens are so fresh and clean they feel like they are squeaking on your teeth.  The beets and goat cheese are equally fresh tasting.  It's a gorgeous and simple dish ala the slow food movement - local, fresh, highlighting the ingredients without over seasoning, saucing etc. I do not think I asked if they were local, but it tasted much like the greens I'm getting from my yard.  \n\nThe tagliatelle is home made, but it was the chicken on top that made my eyes roll over.  Warm, tender, with a slightly crisped skin.   Definitely a young / small chicken where you're getting the best flavor from the meat.  A bite of meat on the fork, swabbed through the pasta with a bit of artichoke followed by a swig of interesting wine (I haven't even talked about the by-the-glass selection, but trust me it's good) while seated at the marble bar and enjoying the company of friends and bar mates is...well....it's why I'll keep going back and sending others.\n\nThe Mood: The restaurant's face lift and attitude adjustment seems to go from the back of the house, through the kitchen right up to the moment you walk in the door.

If Yelp would give us half-star options I would give Bistro Aix 2.5 stars as its one note-worthy element is its rear atrium that has a great sky-light that gives the room an outdoorsy feel.\n\nThe food at Bistro Aix is okay - not poor nor grand but squarely in the middle of both categories.  It didn't help that on my most recent trip there the kitchen was out of a couple of menu items by the time my party was seated at 9:30 PM (we had late reservations).  The house cured salmon on potato galette with dill cream & baby greens would have been really good but for the fact that the dish was way too salty.  The baby beet salad with goat cheese is a common dish done all over the city but in this version the flavors did not seem to harmonize.\n\nFor my entre I ordered the grilled Sonoma leg of lamb with the potato gratin.  The gratin was good but the lamb was served a bit cold.  Thus, meat that was cooked perfectly medium-rare was a bit tough and rubbery.  I also tried the ahi tuna with mashed potatoes and was disappointed by the blandness of the dish.  The spicy port sauce accompanying the dish was anything but spicy.  For dessert I played it safe and got the vanilla ice cream with chocolate fudge and toasted almonds.  The safe bet turned out to be pretty good but nothing that one would hope for from a fine dining establishment.  \n\nBistro Aix has an extensive wine list and is good for groups as I was able to get a last minute reservation for eight people on a Friday night.

During this said trip to the bay area, I was with a couple friends just trying to eat at as many Michelin-starred and Bib Gourmands as possible. Bistro Aix just happened to have open reservations the night we got into the city.\n\nThe ambiance:\nWe arrived for an extremely early dinner. I think we were the first people in at 6pm when they opened dinner service, so given that, the place was quite empty and we had the entire place to ourselves! We opted for the seats in the back, per everyone's suggestions on Yelp. The decor and atmosphere was gorgeous. The sun was still out since it was 6pm and it just lit up the room marvelously. People began trickling in and it also helped brighten the room up. I was a big fan of the overall atmosphere.\n\nThe food:\nWe had a three-course prix-fixe for $25 (I believe that was how much it cost; it's been a while!). I remember ordering a soup, but forget what it was. It might have been a split pea soup or something similar, but I remember it being okay. It didn't rock my socks off, which is probably why I don't remember it well. The entree was delish -- my two friends each ordered the steak option, but I decided to go with the halibut, which was served atop a fennel broth with some potatoes. It was perfectly flaky and full of flavor; it also had the added bonus of being one of my lighter meals that week, minimizing my diet-associated guilt! Dessert was forgettable, but I'm not much of a sweets guy, so that's to be expected.\n\nThe service:\nI think it had something to do with us being the only party there for a good half hour, but service was great. No complaints.\n\nIf you're in SF and want a great contemporary and reasonably upscale restaurant to try, I'd highly recommend Bistro Aix.

As it was a chilly night we all had the french onion soup.It was wonderfully rich and not dripping with cheese. Instead a small cheese crostini floated on top. I chose the steak frites and my friends both had the chicken. Both the steak and the fries were perfect. However, the glass of wine I had tasted a bit like it had been opened several days earlier. Drinkable but definitely feeling the effects of the air. \r\n\r\nWe rounded out our dinner with three desserts --- the panna cotta, the apple pie and the creme brulee. I would order the panna cotta and the creme brulee again but the apple to crust ratio on the apple pie was a bit off (too much crust, not enough apple).\r\n\r\nWe spent two hours in total because we were having such a wonderful time. Never once were we rushed. \r\n\r\nExcellent service, great food and good value I'll definitely go back.", "author": "Miriam W."}

After endless yelping for places that were both friendly to vegetarians and close to the place where one of them worked, I settled for Bistro Aix. \n\nWhen I called for a reservation I got the voicemail and left a message. I didn't expect them to actually call back within 20min but they did. The man, Steven I think, was very friendly and even said that they could change the prixe fixe menu to accommodate the difficult to please vegetarians. \n\nWe ended up getting there almost an hour before our reservation time but we were seated right away anyway. The bread really was fantastic and it was hard to stop eating it. We looked at the prixe fixe menu and realized that the price had been raised to $23. Furthermore, it didn't have a vegetarian option. The prixe fixe included an appetizer and an entree. If you wanted something that didn't have meat in it, you could actually order off the normal menu and add an appetizer for less than the prixe fixe menu. But there only about 3 vegetarian options to even chose from. \n\nI had the pulled beef ravioli ($20), which was very good. It has an incredibly full flavour but, at the same time, wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be. For dessert I had the Chocolate Cake ($7.50), which I thought was fantastic. It was flour-less and thus basically a brownie, and came with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce. \n\nIn summary, it was good, but not mindblowing. I was a bit disappointed with them saying that they could come up with something interesting for the vegetarians over the phone, and then just pointing to the menu when we were there.", "author": "Mariko F."}

As soon as we sat down, we ordered appetizers for the table - a basket of fries and some calamari.  The appetizers came out quickly and while I didn't try the calamari (just wasn't feeling the squid that night), the fries were tasty. When we settled in, we learned they were out of a couple of dishes - the gnocchi and another one - which was a bit disappointing.\n\nWe ordered our entrees and more appetizers - a few beet salads, and I had the steak (after I was advised by my friend to not get the lamb which she had ordered on other occasions). The beet salad was fine, though it definitely erred on the side of more goat cheese than beets (I prefer a beetier salad than the tiny bits that were included in this salad). My steak was a small but good sized portion, though it was a bit rare for medium. The flavor of the steak was fine but definitely average. Instead of the fries (which I'd already had as an app), I got the haricot verts (they were out of the potato gratin) which were tasty. All in all, the food was average.\n\nThe service, however, was bad. Our waitress was surly from the start - not a smile not once, nothing. We are a fun, friendly group, and she mostly just frowned at us. While she was pouring wine, she also poured wine on my friends shoulder. Luckily (I suppose?), my friend was wearing a sleeveless top so the wine didn't get on her clothes, but no apology from the waitress. My other friend wasn't so lucky. When they were clearing plates from another table, they dropped a bunch of the plates and spilled ketchup on her white jacket. She was trying to be nice but she was mortified; at least in this situation, the waiter apologized profusely, tried to get it out with soda water and also told her to come back if she had any problems getting the ketchup stain out of her jacket. \n\n'Tis true, it's a nice spot to dine outside but so are the other places on the block. I found Bistro Aix to be overrated for its prices, service and quality of food. One day I'll try Bistro Aix again but probably not again any time soon.", "author": "Wendy L."}

Rose and I sat in the front of the restaurant, close to the bar (just where we're supposed to be!).  Close quarters. I think we were just about a foot away from the diners to our left and right. It was fun to spy on their orders and make our decisions. It can get a little noisy, but we could still have a conversation without yelling.\n\nWe each had a different salad and I remember both of us loving each of them.  A fan of beets - Rose had that salad. I tried the greens with salmon and a very thinly sliced potatoes.  It was a perfect combination of salty with lightly dressed greens.  Rose had that pasta I now want.  Lucky for me - she gave me a bite.  I was jealous the entire meal, but I had the lamb steak, which was also delicious. I couldn't be a complete pig and order the pasta too.  Trust me - it crossed my mind.  \n\nPrices for the food were very reasonable.  The wine list was a little on the pricey side.  My only problem with the restaurant is that we had a car. Parking was horrible.  But instead of doing what I did, which was drive round and round and then find the metered parking garage (very expensive!). Go to the restaurant's website and read their recommendations on parking.  That would be the smart way to go!", "author": "Doreen E."}

We sat in the front portion of the restaurant which based on the prior reviews was not the best place for ambiance. We ordered the butter bean soup which had fresh butter bean and corn in a lightly flavored white/clear broth that we thought was okay. We also got the heirloom tomato panzanetta, which had fresh tomatoes that were popping with taste in a slightly over salted, citrus-y dressing. We also got the burratta with eggplant appetizer which was basically a grilled eggplant topped with burrata and a thin slice of roasted bellpepper - the burrata was soft and fresh and the veggies were roasted perfectly: everyone liked this dish. We got the burrata, kale pizza which featured a thin crust cooked well in a brick oven, topped with delicious dino kale, fava beans and burrata cheese -- the burrata was not as tasty as the burrata on the appetizer. We also got the spaghettini which ended up being everyone's favorite dish because the sauce had the most unique flavor (oregano, chili oil, basil). We got the risotto which was bland and very forgettable.\n\nOverall the meal was average and the service was solid. We probably won't be coming back but it is a good option for a crowd with mixed vegetarians and non-vegetarians looking for a restaurant in the Marina.", "author": "T K."}

What carries through is the very good, friendly service and relatively fair prices for some pretty good food.\n\nBeet salad with greens and cheese was nice as the beets were not over-marinated.  Better still was bucatini with pancetta.  The bucatini was chewy, the panetta a bit gamey and the tomato sauce assertively spcied.  In fact this was one of the best pastas I have ever had, as good as what you get at Perbacco or Delfina.  Bouillabaisse was nice but could only be a letdown after the pasta.  The broth was nice, the shellfish and potatoes likewise, but the fish a bit dry.  \n\nBistro Aix is a nice alternative in the Marina.", "author": "David D."}

Came here on Friday evening and were welcomed warmly and seated immediately.  The restaurant is beautifully designed and laid out, and it just has a great aura about it. \n\nFor dinner, I ordered the gnocchi and BFF ordered the roasted chicken.  Probably the best gnocchi I've had in some time.  It was super rich without being too much, and the English peas were so fresh I wouldn't be surprised if they had been picked that day.  BFF ate all but two bites of her chicken (and we also try not to eat more than half of what we order in one sitting.)  If that doesn't speak volumes, I don't know what does.\n\nThe service was excellent - friendly, efficient and not bothersome at all.

They have an outside covered patio area with lots of heaters, but it was still a little chilly on a December evening. Six of us were seated outside with a few other empty tables around us on a Saturday evening. Their wine list was longer than their food list! But we finally decided on two appetizers, the fried calamari and their bacon and leek pizza. The calamari was quite tasty; it was really tender and came with this lovely \"asian slaw\" as they called it. The pizza was on a thin crisp crust and was quite enjoyable. Most of us had the ribeye which was topped with garlic butter and accompanied with fries and some greens. The ribeye was tender and cooked to order, but oddly was sliced for you, rather than served as a complete steak. I enjoyed the gnocci, which they gladly replaced the brussel sprouts with spinach for me. The gnocci was a little firmer than I'm used to, but was still tasty. It was served in a butter sage sauce, which made the dish a bit heavy/greasy and salty. One of us had the smoked salmon salad, which was nicely prepared. The smoked salmon topped a thin layer of some sort of cream cheese and julienne cut and fried potatoes, which was quite tasty! It came over some fresh greens. The last entree we had was the sole, which was topped by an olive sauce. We all agreed that we never thought something that wasn't an olive could taste so...olive-y.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our meal, the service was attentive, and the atmosphere was cute. We had a good time, but nothing stood out enough for me to come out of my way to find myself back here again...but if in the area, I might stop by again.", "author": "Christine L."}

While everything was really good, I wasn't totally blown away by the food.  I had the ahi tuna with mashed potatoes and fried baby spinach.  The thing I discovered about fried baby spinach is that, while it sounds intriguing on a menu, it is actually a boring, and slightly annoying way to prepare spinach.  It didn't really have any flavor, and the texture of the spinach was thrown off to the point where it just sort of stuck to the front of my teeth.  (This phenomenon could be entirely my fault, however.  Anyone who knows me will recall that I have an uncanny ability get food stuck in odd parts of my teeth.)  The rest of the meal was tasty, though, and the bread and wine before the meal was great.      \n\nOther factors that give Bistro Aix a four star rating:\n1.  This is a pricey restaurant, but it does not necessarily have to be.  They have a few options that are around $10 (instead of $20 for the entrees) and wallets always appreciate that.\n2. The service is excellent.  We had about three different people from the wait staff helping our table at one point or another and they were all friendly, helpful, and attentive. \n3.

If it wasn't for the bitchy lady sitting next to me, complaining about EVERYTHING, I would have had a perfect streak at Bistro, but I won't blame this on them.  Reminder, part of this establishments name is BISTRO, so do not expect a Gary Danko experience.  Actually, this is meant to be a compliment.  You will find SIMPLE, beautifully prepared, delicious food at Bistro Aix - along with wonderful, perfectly laid-back staff.

We also had really great service. The food was pretty good, but there was nothing that really impressed. \n\nTo start we split the smoked salmon on potato crisps and the salad with warm breaded goat cheese. Both of them were solid choices and we enjoyed them, but we weren't \"wowed.\" The salmon was good, but I suppose one grows accustomed to great lox when they live near Sables in NYC. I felt like I could make the goat cheese salad at home - it wasn't special enough. \n\nFor our entrees we shared the pork chop and the leg of lamb. The leg of lamb is served sliced and needed more seasoning. It tasted a bit bland and I would have preferred it more rare. My fiance's pork chop was very good and super tasty. \n\nThis is a great place to come if you live in the neighborhood. The food was high quality and the service was great.

Either the establishment is a tourist trap in an ideal location or it serves good food.  Bistro AIX has been satisfying my tummy for years, so I guess this means it serves good food.  I have never been disappointed by a meal here.  \n\nMake sure you start your dinner with the calamari appetizer.  (I have no idea what the hell Asian Slaw is, but the squid is damn good.  The only slaw I know comes from Cole.)  Be careful with the delicious bread they put out.  You could easily spoil your dinner appetite by chowing down on the foccacia.  (Just like mommy always says.) As for the calamri, I think I have had this every time I have gone to Bistro AIX, and it has satisfied every time.  \n\nThe dinner selections are excellent.  The fish is consistently good.  On my most recent visit I had the gnocchi special.  Gnocchi is always a tricky gastronomical exercise.  It tends to fill the stomach to the exclusion of all other food.  Bistro AIX serves a perfect portion with peas and brown butter.   DEEEEELICIOUS.  I also poached some of the nettle risotto from my girlfriend's plate.  I would rank it as some of the best I have ever tasted.  \n\nThe wine list is extensive and it caters to a multitude of tastes and prices.  The servers are always very friendly and well informed.  My only knock on the place is the desert menu.  It falls a little short.  We had the blueberry pie special.  When I have blueberry pie, I want to taste the blueberries.

The food perhaps a 3 star.\n\nI always like to explore and try new things. I ventured to the City to celebrate and take my friend out for his birthday. Reservations recommended for sure. Parking is an issue since it's street metered parking and residential permit parking on some streets. We circled around a lot before we found a parking lot on Chestnut street. Give yourself at least 20 extra minutes to find parking if driving into the City. Also, bring quarters! We were about 35-40 minutes late for our reservation but the hostess was very understanding and nice. \nThe ambience is nice, however the service was a bit lack luster. It could have been an off day for our server that evening... I say this because (1) our table was set for only 4 when we had 5 in our party; we had to ask for another setting (2) He never asked us for drinks or told us his name (3) When one of us asked him for a drink, he didn't think to ask the rest of the table so he ended up going back and forth bringing the drinks one at a time 3x (4) He forgot to bring Balsamic Vinegar upon request 2x (5) He exclaimed \"Boy you all must be hungry\" when we asked for more bread -- which you HAVE to request otherwise they will not bring you bread. (6) He never asked us about our meals or came to check on us.\n\nApart from the poor service that we experienced the food was good. It's not sharing portions but very fresh and delicious! \n\nI would still give the service another chance, it could have just been an off day for our server in particular. I made my reservation through Open Table and also called the restaurant to let them know it was a birthday, but nothing special was done, nor a Happy Birthday said by the wait staff or management. hmmmm. Makes me wonder why one should even mention \"a special occasion\". We opted out of having our dessert there and took our sweet tooth else where to celebrate the birthday portion of our evening.\n\nFrom the looks of other reviews it's most likely we just went on an off night.

And honestly, Bistro Aix knocks the socks off A16.\n\nBetween my boyfriend and I we had the crab cakes, butter bean soup, a pizza, the halibut, and a polenta berry cupcake for dessert.  Yes, we ate a ton, but it was the food's fault - it was so good we just couldn't stop.  We ate there a week ago and I still can't stop salivating over the halibut.  It was quite possibly the best seafood dish I have ever had.  Bistro Aix reminds me why I'm a pescetarian and not a strict veg - seafood can be effing delicious!!!\n\nFor the Marina haters (and there are plenty of you for good reason), this place is worth venturing into the Marina for.  All pretentiousness is left at the door.  Our waiter was great - attentive, enjoyable, and honest.  I appreciate a waiter who doesn't llllove everything on the menu, but is actually willing to correct potential selection mistakes.

It was pretty simply prepared in what the called a tempura batter, but seemed more like you standard Calamari batter. The alioli and the slaw were mixed in below the calamari. The flavors were very good and the dish and the calamari itself was a tender.\n\nThe pizza was just so so. I liked the thin crust but the ingredients seem cheap. The cheese was very bland and the sauce was a bit sweet. \n\nMy friend's Oyster's where good, but there was very many. The corn dish that accompanied the oysters, was a bit odd, it didn't work that well.

When i eat out, i am hoping for a good experience with good food all around and similar service to boot. My friend Diana had wanted to try this place out for a while so we double dated (as we usually do) with our significant others! So read on for the nitty-gritty...\n\nHighlights:\nIll start with the good... Server was definitely knowledgeable as far as options on the menu, mentioning items that were sold out for the night, and was very good with the wine selections/recommendations.\nFor apps, we had the cured salmon on potato galette and fried calamari. We ended up ordering an extra order of the cured salmon... the combo of the texture and taste of the salmon on a crisp potato hash was delicious. The calamari was decent enough... not overly battered or salted which some places do to hide the un-freshness of the calamari.\nFor our mains, my wife had the cracker crust pizza with applewood bacon, leeks, rapini and gruyere while i had the Kobeburger and Fries. The pizza crust was as advertised... crispy and crackly to the max! The flavor of the bacon really came through as did the copious amount of leeks. The rapini(a leafy broccoli of sorts) added some texture and color to the dish. My burger which was served on sliced focaccia was medium rare like i asked for, and was tender, juicy and flavorful. The fries were sliced both slim and thick with skins, just how i like them. These are both must try dishes at this restaurant!!\n\nLowlights:\nSmall pet peeve was that one of our glasses for drinking water had stains all over it including prints and lip gloss... i generally assume that this should never happen at any establishment that is presenting itself as $$ and shooting for 4 stars on yelp. What really drove me to give Bistro Aix 3 stars was the quality of the 2 other entrees ordered by my friends. Diana ordered the duck breast and her BF Will ordered the crispy roasted chicken leg. I found it amusing that crispy roasted chicken breast was also on the menu, redundant to say the least. The duck breast arrived overcooked, dry and was a tiny serving in general. Presentation was also lacking. The chicken leg was the same; the meat was dry and chewy. Not what we expected at all. Will kept complaining about the price as well $22... when he could get a better tasting and filling chicken at Costco for much less. \n\n3 stars for large disparity between items.", "author": "Denny C."}

That's how I actually found this great french restaurant.\n\nIn case you didn't know, my first experience with French Restaurant was surpass horrible. I was a little sceptic of trying a french restaurant again, that's how bad the first time was.( It scarred me!)\n\nExterior:\nThis is  definitely a lil-cute place, that you wouldn't notice from walking by. Plenty of different variety of restaurant on the block, sushi, streak house, chinese, sandwich cafes, and wine tasting. Plenty of people but \"not so plenty of parking\". Few shopping stores around the corner, gap, starbucks, chocolate shop, walgreen, bars, movie theater, and a few other little shops.\n\nInterior:\nDefinitely a quite, romantic, candle light, atmosphere. Clean, simply, and nice for a conversation.\n\nServices:\nThe guy who sat us, was super nice. He try to get us in as soon as possible even when we were late to our reservation. The waiter was awesome too, super nice and courtesy.\n\nFood: The best part!!!!\nEvery night they offer a different menu. The menu was sooo delicious, every thing sounded so good. It was sad to only have two of people. \nWe had the Pan-fried Pork chop, and the Bouillabaise Halibut. Omg, delicious is just putting it lightly. It was surpass delicious. We love the Pan-fried pork chop most. The waiter actually recommended to us, and everyone in the restaurant too. (He was selling that pork chop. hahaha)The flavors, the plating, the flavor (needs to be said again) everything was all there and on time. It was great. Loved it!\nThe bread and extra-virgin olive oil was a nice touch. (But don't fill up on bread, best is yet to come!)\nDessert: We had the Creme brulee, and a Tarte tatin. The tarte tatin is like a hot apple pie with whip cream, nice after dinner.\n\nPrice:\nI wouldn't believe it if we didn't look at the receipt. Price was fastastically cheap, for a french place with great food. Two people, with dessert not one but two dessert only $60. French baby, French!\n\nMy Overview:\nI am definitely going back, plus I will bring more people and sing about it to everyone. I'm no longer scarred by the mention of french restaurant. I'm cured! LOL!\n\nOne Look Out Point: No Parking Available Anywhere, go early.", "author": "Paulie L."}

I did a little research to find out where might be a good place to eat in the marina, and it looked like Bistro AIX was the winner.\n\nI got in soon after opening, and it was pretty sparse. I had my choice of sitting at a table or the bar, and I chose the bar, because really, why bother with a table when you're eating alone if there is a bar to choose. I had the Prix Fixe (available Sun-Thur) which for $19.95 comes with a choice of soup or salad, and one of three entrees. I chose the soup, some sort of cranberry bean deal, and the roast chicken breast.\n\nThe soup was quite lovely - a smooth puree with earthiness from the beans, and some sweetness. It was garnished with a dollop of sour cream and some croutons, which really helped bring the soup together. The main course, a roasted chicken breast served with green beans and red potatoes, was also great. The chicken was juice, and the skin was crisp. The veg and potatoes were great too, but quite buttery, so how could they not be? Honestly, on the basis of the Prix Fixe menu, and the main food, this place is 5 stars.  I also had a glas of their Pinot Noir which was quite good, although not fantastic.\n\nWell, it being the day before my birthday, I decided I would get dessert too, pretty much blowing the \"holy cow this is not expensive\" aspect of the Prix Fixe. I decided on the Creme Brulee, which I honestly thought was just average. The carmelized sugar top was a bit thick, and they got the creme part a bit melty from carmelizing it. Honestly, my gold standard for creme brulee is my own, which when it is on, is phenomenal, and when I goof up, still great. So really, their dessert is about a three. \n\nTo sum this up, I highly recommend this place Sun-Thurs for the Prix Fixe menu. I am pretty sure their normal menu food will be great as well, and their prices are quite fair. But the prix fixe is a fantastic value for your food dollar. Their dessert is a bit lackluster, and it is because of that that I am knocking it down to 4 stars. I wish I didn't have to do that, but I wouldn't be honest with myself.\n\nI'll go back here, if I am in the marina. If that happens, expect the rating to possibly go up, especially if the pre-dessert portion of the meal is as good as my first visit.", "author": "neil c."}

It looked reasonable enough so we thought we'd give it a try. Weren't expecting anything amazing, just a decent dinner.\n\nWe got so much more. We arrived around 6 on a Friday and the place was nearly empty. As a result, we were ushered to the back patio, which was already feeling pretty magical with the white christmas lights and heat lamps. They had just washed down the floor (which they do every day) so they gave us a table for 3 so we'd have a chair to put our bags on (including my hefty backpack). I was definitely not dressed for the place, but I was never made to feel like I'd shown up to the wrong place.\n\nThe service was wonderful. Our waiter was knowledgeable, humorous, and cute! He suggested a Spanish white wine by the glass for me (wish I could remember the name) and it was exactly what I described wanting (and was the cheapest on the menu - no pushy folks here). He also accommodated the allergies at the table by switching the cheese in our heirloom tomato salad (which was fantastic - a new twist on the traditional flavors with cucumber and olives).\n\nThe hit may have been the ahi tuna we shared. It was a simple dish, but the flavors really popped and the mastery of the cooking was evident. The spinach was delicate and flaky like seaweed, which in combination with the light and creamy potatoes and the gently seared ahi, was a comfortable, but decadent main course.\n\nCouldn't skip dessert.

The texture of the galette was nice and crisp, but overall, the dish was too salty.\n\nFor our entree, my friends and I all ordered steak.  I ordered mine rare, because I always figure rare at a restaurant really = medium rare ever since the ecoli outbreaks.  Um, no.  Rare = rare here.  It tasted good, but it was mooing and I definitely paid the price.  Quite literally, I got physically ill from it. \n\nWe shared the chocolate cloud cake, which you would think would be either a molten cake or some sort of mousse cake.  It was neither: more of a flourless, dense cake with a crusty top.  It wasn't bad. \n\nBut what I appreciated the least was the snotty look the waiter gave me when I asked for a nonfat latte with my dessert.  \"We don't serve nonfat lattes,\" he replied.

Looks like you can order full menu at the bar though as an option.\n\nThe wait staff was excellent, attentive but not overly so. The waiter recommended 2 wines for us and brought us tastes. We went with a Joel Gott Cab and it was perfect. We brought a bottle as well and I don't believe we were charged a corkage fee since we had purchased a bottle, not 100% on that as I didn't get a close look at the bill.  We liked our busboy so much, who opened our 2nd bottle (a good Jarvis cab) that we offered to share a taste with him. \n\nAll the salads and entries were solid, not spectacular but the quaintness of the restaurant really adds to the experience.  The only thing I wouldn't order again was the 'apple pie' it was not a true apple pie it was more like sara lee apple dumpling, heavy on the crust and light on the apples.", "author": "Sarah B."}

They make classic dishes outstanding with fresh ingredients and perfect seasoning. The atmosphere is relaxed and the meal is not served at a frantic pace so you are able to actually enjoy the amazing food. Every time I am there the waiter makes excellent suggestions of wines that compliment my food beautifully.\n\nNow for the important part: the food. The beginning of the meal starts with high quality buttery olive oil and bread that is baked fresh daily. The delicious combo of bread and olive oil is just a preview of the quality meal to come. The bread alone is worth dining at Aix. In my multiple visits, I have tried both the Mesclun Green Salad with Tarragon Vinaigrette and the Butter Lettuce Salad with Fresh Herbs salad. Both salads are delicate but incredibly flavorful. The herbs are vibrant and the lettuce is so fresh. Few restaurants can compete with Aix's simple green salads.\n\nEach time I return to Aix I can't help but reorder what I got the first time: the spaghetti. Hands down the best spaghetti ever. The sauce has the perfect amount of garlic and is full of fresh basil and olive oil. I am always surprised by how good it is every time I order it. My meat eating dining mates have always been blissed out by their entrees as well- especially the Crispy Roasted Sonoma Chicken.\n\nWriting this review reminds me that I need to go back ASAP.", "author": "Molly S."}

I was upset and surprised when the hostess seated a group people ahead of us that had arrived at the same time without reservations. When we were finally seated, there were multiple open tables at which we could have been seated earlier. \n      I can't help but wonder what the point of making a reservation is when you are still treated as a walk-in customer and made to wait 35 minutes. The food was great but the over all experience was far too fouled by the unnecessary delay. In my experience, any decent manager or host would offer a complimentary drink, appetizer, or desert in a situation like this but no such accommodation was offered. No effort to make things right.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-05-23", "description": "I first noticed Bistro Aix when i was on my way to dinner at Isa a few doors down on the recommendation of some friends. I was curious so i looked it up on Yelp and found out about the two course tasting menu which is now down to $19.95 (from $23), you gotta love that. Shortly thereafter i saw that it found its way into the SF Gate Bay Area 100 list. I had to check this place out. Since moving to the Bay Area about a year ago, my girlfriend and i have found it hard to come up from the peninsula and really explore San Francisco just because there are so many options. Lately we've been hitting the Marina a lot and i've been pretty impressed. \n\nAnyway, i was a bonehead and decided we should go there on a friday, meaning that we missed the 2 course tasting, but fear not, we will be back. We ended up at a nice table for two on the patio right under a heater (which my GF appreciated). The patio was really neat, i thoroughly enjoyed it. We then got a basket of bread which was INCREDIBLE. There's a bread thats great with a hard, tough crust, but the gem of the bread basket is the super soft bread that soaks up olive oil like a sponge. It was hard not to fill up on bread. I also really liked having the euro style cool (but not cold, definitely no ice) water in a recycled, label-less bottle that we could pour ourselves. Its not huge, but it was a nice touch that i liked. \n\nOn to what we came here for: the food. \n\nWe started with the mesclun salad with breaded goat cheese. It was really good, but didn't blow me away. The goat cheese was obviously the star of the show. The crust was nice and crispy while the inside was soft, warm, and gooey. \n\nNext up was a special of roasted rabbit with carrots and morels. I think it may have been the first time i've had rabbit since i started really caring about food. It certainly tastes like chicken, though it has a more intense flavor and is a bit fattier. It was delicious and perfectly cooked. We got several pieces with the bone in, which made getting all the meat off without looking like a neanderthal a bit of a challenge, but i was up to it. The reduction sauce and the morels that the rabbit was served with were also incredible. I'm a big fan of morels. To me they have all of the good qualities of mushrooms (earthy flavor, etc.) and none of the bad (that gross spongy texture of your run of the mill supermarket mushrooms). Okay i guess they still look kind of funny, but i can get over that. The carrots were also incredible. \n\nLast up was their most popular dish, the crispy roasted chicken breast with red baby potatoes, haricots verts and jus. The chicken was roasted perfectly and was tender and juicy in the middle, but the skin was left on (and maybe it was broiled for a few minutes at the end?) that gave it this incredible and flavorful crunchy crust. It was easily the best roasted chicken i've ever had. The potatoes had kosher salt sprinkled over the top which created a kind of interesting (in a good way) crunchiness to them, without a dominating saltiness in the flavor. \n\nI was hoping for the apple crisp dish that i saw pictures of on Yelp, but it wasn't on the menu. Its okay though, we were full anyway. We will definitely be coming back though. I want to do the tasting menu and try a few more dishes that intrigued me. The burger looked incredible. The fries looked like they were super crunchy on the inside and soft and hot on the inside. It took lots discipline not to get a side order of fries. The steak frites also looked out of this world. The table next to us  got an order of calamari that also looked (and sounded) like it was great. I will certainly be back. \n\nGiven the quality of the food, you can't really beat in terms of value.", "author": "Travis D."}

Some of us got there early, and the waiter was very kind as he waited for us to all trickle in.   We sat in the back patio, which was nicely lit and somewhat cozy.  I ordered the chicken breast with potatoes and found it to be only O-K.   It was nothing special--not too dry but nothing extraordinary.  I guess it's just chicken.   I also tried the steak dish and my experience along with others who had it thought nothing great about this dish.  Meat was not tender nor was it very tasty.   By the end of the night, i felt our waiter was also losing his cool.  He was snappy when we told him how we wanted the steak cooked, and he was rude to my friend when she had asked for something.  \n\nOverall, a cute little restaurant in the Marina.

It's one of those awesome neighborhood restaurants that offers quality food at affordable prices.  \n\nFood:  5 stars.  Come between 6-8pm on Sun/Mon/Wed/Thu to take advantage of the $23 two-course prix fixe menu.  Unlike some restaurants, Bistro Aix is willing to offer some of their best dishes as choices on the prix fixe menu.  As appetizers, we had the asparagus soup, which was creamy and lick-the-bowl delicious, and the mesclun green salad with tarragon vinaigrette, which must be paired with the optional ($1.50 extra) warm breaded goat cheese.  For entrees, the grilled top sirloin with maitre'd butter was perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy with flavor.  The accompanying french fries are better than McDonald's, but the dish didn't need the watercress salad.  The crispy roasted chicken breast is a standout - it's so juicy and delicious.  I finished every bite, including the equally delicious crushed baby red potatoes and the haricots verts that came with it.  For dessert, the chocolate cloud cake is fantastic.  The cake has the texture of a light brownie and pairs perfectly with the coolness of the whipped creme fraiche.  \n\nService:  5 stars.   Service is polished, professional, and friendly.

Last year, we were blown away by the waitress and the event planner and how great they were at accommodating us. This year, not so much. The waiter was frazzled, and they were downright rude in general to our group. They weren't apologetic when they were out of things and made substitutes - when we'd confirmed our group size prior and had narrowed down their menu with them per their requirements to only 3 appetizers, 3 mains and 2 desserts. They cut the alcohol and tried to kick us out immediately after midnight when last year we were okayed to stay until 1 or 1:30. Some guests didn't get dessert at all. The food quality had gone down - the chicken I raved about last year was dry this year and I heard the steak meat quality was very poor. \nI don't know what's going on with this place but they need to get their act together. Maybe they changed ownership. We had 27 disappointed people who paid $80 a head for a nice NYE. We won't be back and next year we'll be taking our group elsewhere.\nI should have seen the signs between our contact leaving and the wine list changing 3 times over the month or two I was planning the event - every time I submitted my sparkling, 2 whites and 2 reds I was told the wines were no longer available - but there wasn't anything I could do at that point. I'm disappointed for my friends and encourage you to take your large group elsewhere.\nI'm sorry to report that our experience this year wasn't so great.  The waiter looked unhappy and stressed.  I don't blame him since they ran out of everything - we had an agreed menu selection - but were not able to get everything on that menu.\n\nAppetizers - they couldn't handle all the requests for the calamari - so some of our guests didn't get it eventhough they requested it read more \u00bb.  Also, we had some late arrivers, and they didn't even get an appetizer - they were told they ran out.\n\nMain Course - Steak was really fatty - heard that from several of the guests.  I heard good comments about the Tuna.\n\nDessert - I was very disappointed.  Me and my husband ordered the Creme Brulee - I was looking forward to it all evening.  When the desserts came, they plopped down a bread pudding which was not even one of our menu choices, and looked like a afterthought dessert - a cupcake with fruit on top.  They didn't explain to us at all why we didn't get what we ordered - they just plopped it down.  Needless to say I complained to the poor waiter and he said they ran out.  A few of the other guests didn't even get dessert.  I ended up getting the chocolate cake which was flavorless and dry....left half of it on my plate.\n\nI heard about some other mishaps, but can't elaborate on them since I don't know the details.\n\nMy only guess to our poor service and quality of food is that they have either changed management, chef, or just were not organized that night.  \n\nFor $80 a head, it was a real disappointment.  We will most definitely be changing venues for our next year event.", "author": "Sarah R."}

Service was great, the food was delicious and tasty, and the wine was good.\n\nI started with the baby beet salad, which is served with spinach and goat cheese.  Good sized salad, you could easily share with another person for appetizer.  Then I had the cod, which had olives, tomato, pasta, etc. in a soup-like consistency sauce.  Light, warm, comforting.  My sister had the gnocci (vegetarian), and that was delicious as well.  My date had the grilled Hawaiian ahi tuna which is served with garlic mash and fried spinach; and to me, this was the best dish of the night.  The ahi was \"cooked\" perfectly- very rare, and the ahi was very good quality.  I would definitely order this if you love ahi.  For dessert we had a persimmon chocolate bread-type-pudding dessert.  It was interesting tasting (I had never had persimmons before), light, served with freshly made whipping cream and honey.  We also had a chocolate brownie served with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce- excellent, addicting, and super chocolate-y.  \n\nOur server, Brandon gave excellent service.  He was attentive, kind, and fun.  His recommendations were awesome.  Great place to take a date or go with a few girlfriends.", "author": "Sarah F."}

My husband and I stood around awkwardly for an unacceptable amount of time before the host arrived. \n2.) He sat us at a crappy table that got a lot of foot traffic and was right next to this tree in the middle of the back patio. The tree was surrounded by four blinding lights that were really distracting. I could understand if this were the only table available or if we had not reserved, but there were easily six other two-person tables open, and we had reserved. They did move us after we asked nicely.  \n3.) The menu did not match the one online, and the one we were presented with was significantly inferior to what we were expecting. \n4.) My husband attempted to order an Heirloom tomato salad with mozzarella, and they were out--it's tomatoes.\n5.) We ask for bread and were 2/3 though our appetizers before it arrived. Meanwhile, we watched a basket (ours) get delivered to the table next to us who was already paying its bill. \n6.) I ordered a glass of wine. They forget. I had to ask again. \n7.) My duck was way undercooked in relation to how I ordered it. \n8.) I found white plastic wrapping in the duck. It was obviously the type of wrapping that comes around all meat purchased at a butcher shop, but it's pretty unacceptable that the chefs would overlook that.\n9.) We ordered one dessert. The waitress even made a point of telling us it's her favorite. The runner brought us an entirely different dessert. \n10.) Regardless of the plastic wrap in the duck, the rest of the food was average at best. \n\nMy husband is French. We lived in Paris for several years. We are, admittedly, rather harsh critics when it comes to French cuisine. That does not mean, however, that one cannot find good French fare in SF. We have had good experiences at Chapeau, Chouchou, and Fringale.

The salad was good, but that pumpkin soup was wonderful. Lucky for me we shared a bit. For entree he had the chicken and even though the menu said no substitutions the waiter agreed to do double green beans and no potatoes. The slightly crispy skin was just right, not like eating deep fried chicken by any means, just roasted to perfection. I had the bouillabaisse, which was amazing. Even more amazing is the fact that I kept it off my silk top, but that's just me. I expected the mussels to be the shining star of this dish, but the huge piece of sea bass hiding below the broth and other goodies was so delish, I might have to declare it the winner. I had a fantastic glass of wine (the malbec) and he had the amber ale. We passed on dessert in favor of grabbing a chocolate around the corner, but the flourless chocolate cake sure looked good! \n\nOverall this was a big win in our books.

It was like visiting an old friend who just had a face-lift; everything was the same, only better. The interior layout and dimensions are the same, but all upgraded materials and fixtures, giving it a bit more luxe feeling. \nI snagged my usual single seat at the counter and was waited on by the competent, capable, and rather good-looking bartender who was more-than-multi-tasking with food and drink orders as well as handling the door and a few other things. He allowed me to taste a couple of wines before deciding on the \"right\" one. My counter seat afforded me a great view into the compact but bustling kitchen, whence great food continues to come. \nAs I was going to a movie nearby I opted for a lighter meal; the first course salmon on latkes over greens was a delight, followed by tagliatelle with lamb meatballs in a light but spicy tomato sauce and an unusual mint addition. \nI couldn't've asked for a tastier meal to send me off to the movies in comfort.

Back story...I made a reservation for Saturday night for 7 people at 8:30.   They called me day of to confirm the time and the party size.  We show up at 8:30 and the \"friendly hostess\" tells me they are backed up and it will be an additional 30-45 minutes.  ARE YOU F'ING KIDDING ME?  If we eat any later they might as well bring out the breakfast menu.  I had a reservation and they even called me to confirm.  I felt like I was in a Seinfeld episode.  At first, we were fine with the \"mix up\" and went across the street to Izzy's for a drink.  For the hell of it, we asked Izzy's if they could accommodate a party of 7 and we sat down in 10 minutes.  If you want my opinion, forget Bistro AIX and go across the street to Izzy's...better food, better atmosphere and you get less of the stuffy Marina crowd.

My boyfriend and I split the crab cakes, and then I got the chicken and he got the steak. Our original intent was to split but we both loved our meals so much we didn't want to in the end!  As great as the food was, the service was even better.  Our waiter was one of the best we've ever had and he gave us excellent food recommendations and wine pairing.  We had such a great night, and if we ever take the trip from Chicago to San Fran again...we will definitely come back!", "author": "Samantha K."}

The menu isn't anything special, but the pizza and the tuna are good.  Decent wine list, but no hard liquor.  Like any slightly overpriced restaurant in the Marina, it gets pretty busy later at night.", "author": "Ian C."}

Went last night and had their hamburger on Foccacia with Gorgonzola.  Outstanding burger.  Cooked perfect, great flavor, generous portion.  Have eaten their Grilled Lamb Steak, chicken, and pasta/all very good.  Service could have been a little better but overall very good. I will be back.", "author": "Wayne E."}

Pushed tables together to make it work.  Every dish was spot on.  Let's see, we ordered the escarole and potato soup which we passed around; everyone had a spoonful.  Multiple salads, including the chicory/radicchio caesar, the pear/arugula, and the mesclun with goat cheese, were all fresh and perfectly dressed.  The marguerita pizza, the fontina cheeseburger, the hanger steak, the bouillabaisse all marvelous.  My husband was served the ahi tuna by mistake, but he ate it anyway because it was so good!  And finally, the best for last.  The gnocchi with spring peas and chanterelle mushrooms, just like the soup, was passed around for everyone to try.  Tarte tatin and chocolate cake-yum!  Warm bustling atmosphere of a well-loved neighborhood haunt with perfect food.  And that parking spot half a block away on Chestnut St. was the good omen for the evening.  For all you Marinites, it was 25 minutes door-to-door including parking from Larkspur!", "author": "Alison K."}

We were seated quickly and the service was very good. We both had excellent glasses of French wine. The food was above average and well priced. We will go back if we are in the neighborhood.", "author": "One tough customer M."}

And the warmed goat cheese over butter lettuce is amazing.  The wine list is great and Stephen has always been very engaging and friendly.  This place has consistently stood the test of time.", "author": "Brian L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-02-25", "description": "Great place to dine with tasty specials and a warm cozy atmosphere; very collegial and active crowd but not so noisy you can't hear yourself talk.  Solid wine list.  Great desserts.  Grilled Lamb Steak with Rosemary Jus & grilled Rare Ahi Tuna was done to a turn.  Service was just right especially on such a busy Friday night.  Have a reservation or get there around 6:00pm if you don't want to sit at the bar or in the back patio.", "author": "Tom C."}

We shared all our dishes and so they placed the plates in the middle of the table and gave us small plates to eat off of which was very nice.  The portions were quite big too and made it easy to share. In fact there was so much food we did not finish everything.  For appetizers we started with an Heriloom tomato and mozzerella di buffula salad that was basic but flavorful with purple & red tomatoes.  We also had salmon with creme fraiche and crunchy potatoes that was very unique and quite good.  Lots of flavors melded together and the crunch of the potatoes strings was a nice contrast to the dish .  Our main courses were gnocchi with sage butter, fava beans and pancetta,  a nice medely of flavors and also herb encrusted lamb chops cooked perfectly with crunchy artichokes and potatoes placed underneath the lamb and topped by a very tasy sauce.  For dessert we had the chocolate dream cake topped with Tahitian Vanilla ice cream it was very very rich.  We brought our own bottle of Bourdeaux and the corkage was $18.  Very good food and service.  We sat in front and so people waiting for tables were standing close to our table which I did not like.  When I go back I will try to sit in the back patio which had a nicer atmosphere than inside", "author": "Melanie -."}

It had been years since I had been there it was busy and lively but not packed. We were starving and saw the cracker crust pizza when we walked in so ordered up the basic one with tomato, mozzarella, fontina and parm. Nice light with good subtle flavors, great to munch on while we perused the menu. I got the Special Pork Chop with Apricot glaze. It was perfectly cooked, nice crispy sear on the outside, tender and juicy inside. The potatoes and greens were ok but it was definitely the meat that starred. My friend had the the steak with fries and said it was great. We matched it with a reasonable priced Priorat that went perfect with our food. Our server, wish I knew her name, was attentive and fun to banter with. All in all a good experience, I should go there more often.", "author": "Brad G."}

OH and i must mention the THIN CRUST PIZZA. it was amaaazing. we ordered the pizza on the special menu - it had bacon and spinach. oh my god. (and i actually dont even eat pork). we also ordered the grilled local sea bass and the crispy chicken breast (sorry im forgetting the proper name). the chicken wasnt that great... i wish i had ordered more appetizers (they ran out of duck confit when i went). three people came out to $70 (including tips) so its really not bad for good french food in the marina. yaaaay. im coming back!", "author": "Judy L."}
