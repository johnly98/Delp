He helped guide us through a tasty evening. I hope you experience his service, he made us feel comfortable during our first visit.\n\nWe started with the home made bread & butter. It was freshly baked and the olive butter was a delicious pairing.\n\nWe followed that with the heirloom tomato salad. Organic hand picked tomatoes, feta cheese, cucumbers dashed with a red wine vinaigrette.\n\nThe pork ribletts were a great compliment to the salad. They were so juice and fall off the bone, it was out of this world \n\nWe chose a medium sized and full plate entree to round out the meal. The lamb dish had a tasty chutney with some spicy peppers that added some heat to the meal.\n\nThe half oven roasted chicken dish with French fries and aioli was something I saw on check please. Wow, it was good. When I come back next time, that is a definite must. If a chicken has a nice flavored, crunchy crust and moist white meat inside, it's an A+ in my book.\n\nNext time we will be having a seafood dish, I spied from my table that the sea bass looked amazing.\n\nDesert was on point. \n\nI left feeling satisfied and not too full.

When he found out about this restaurant, we KNEW we had to try it; we popped in right before we went to watch Les Mis.\n\nWhat I love: the decor. Omg. The lighting, the airy feel, and those Portuguese tiles sent me over the moon! I left wanting to tell my interior designer that I needed Portuguese tiles for my backsplash in my kitchen.\n\nThe food: this is a gourmet approach to authentic Portuguese cuisine, and we loved it.\n\nWe got several items, and I think we got too much! We got the caldo verde and our waitress brought it out in two bowls for us. I thought the caldo verde had great flavor and I loved the oil. The shrimp turnovers were YUMMY. My husband got the polvo (octopus), and he thought the cornmeal crust was a nice touch. It was light and not overbearing. The presentation of the polvo was outstanding. The bacalhau was different from what we'd eaten in the past, but we enjoyed it. We liked how the olives were minced and not whole. The piri piri chicken was grilled/roasted to perfection, the side salad had GREAT, light dressing, and the french fries were phenomenal.\n\nWe had a great experience here, and we can't wait to take my husband's mom and dad here!\n\nObrigado, Uma Casa!", "author": "Chandra D."}

When a Portuguese colleague let me know Uma Casa existed--woo hoo. It's a great take on upper scale Portuguese food. If you haven't tried it before, its like Spanish only spicier.\n\nOverall a great place and experience.  The pluses:\n1) The shrimp: GAMBAS MO\u00c7AMBIQUE.  Outstanding, they use the malagueta pepper which imparts a unique and amazing flavor--and heat. A very nice variation on a traditional dish.\n2) Shrimp turnovers:  On the heavy side, but very nice flavor.\n3) P\u00c3O COM MANTEIGA: Chorizo and olive butter on the toasted, house made bread--very nice flavors.\n4) Service--our waitress was attentive, knew the menu and rolled the food out at a nice, controlled pace.\n\nMinuses:\n1)  Normally I like Vinho Verde.  They had \"high end\" Vinho Verde here, about $60/bottle.  I sampled a few of the Vinho Verdes here. At home, I drink Vinho Verde for its light fruitiness, the wine here tasted like it was mixed with Chardonnay.  I'm not a Chard fan so for me it was a let down. (The next day I got a $9 bottle at my local wine store and it was better.\n2) The calamari/cucumber salad as a miss.  Squid was chewy and not pleasant.\n3) OK, not a complaint about Uma Casa: we were seated in between people who were on the phones the whole time.  WTF?  I don't get it. Leave your phone at home--talk to each other.  Communicate. We're people.\n\nNote that I went all seafood so no comments (yet) on the meat dishes.\n\nOverall, I'll be back and encourage anyone try Uma Casa--but without your phone.", "author": "Rob R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-04-28", "description": "I was surprised that my boyfriend and I managed to be seated right away at 7:00 pm on a Friday night, given that Uma Casa has a reputation for being packed. A woman who was seated next to us mentioned the same thing as she sat down, but it didn't take long for the place to get full. Be prepared to yell across your tiny table to have a conversation here.\n\nIt took a while for our waitress to come around after we were seated, and when she finally showed up she was acting like she had something better to do than wait our table and sullenly asked if we wanted still or sparkling water. She never welcomed us or even told us her name - she was just the sulky brunette with the nose piercing. She brought out some complimentary house made potato chips and an amazing dipping sauce, which I believe was the house piri piri sauce. Spicy, bright, with just a hint of citrus, I wanted more chips so I could continue to eat it.\n\nWe started with the pasteis de bacalhau (salt cod fritters with cilantro mayo) which were an immediate disappointment. While the outsides of the fritters were crispy, the inside was a little chewy and pasty. Not good. The cilantro mayo was underwhelming and tasted little of cilantro.\n\nNext came the caldo verde, which was a marked improvement above the fritters. Unlike some recipes, which call for chunks of potato, Uma Casa's caldo verde incorporates potato into the soup as a thickener so every spoonful tastes of potato. The linguica was meaty and the collard greens were cooked perfectly.\n\nIt took quite a while for the next dish to come and I thought our waitress forgot about it. We finally got the pao e manteiga (house made bread with olive and chorizo butters), which was a simultaneous hit and miss. The bread was fantastic, served warm from the oven and slightly toasted. The olive butter was a fruity, creamy spread that I kept reaching for, but the chorizo butter was really not working for me. The first bite I took tasted like plain butter, but on the second bite I got distinct chorizo flavor and wasn't a fan. Maybe it was the thought of mixing meat and butter into a paste, coupled with the fact that the butter was so room temperature it was almost warm, but I prefer to eat my chorizo as a solid meat rather than creamed into butter.\n\nAgain, there was a lengthy wait between the bread and our main courses; while waiting, the woman next to us ordered a steak but the waiter informed her they were sold out. Her husband asked why they were sold out of steak at 8:20, mirroring my thoughts exactly. The polvo dourado finally came out: an octopus tentacle, lightly breaded in cornmeal, curled in the middle of the plate with greens, a single radish slice (yes, one), and three stalks of asparagus, in a sauce that may have been piri piri. This was some of the best octopus I've ever had, so tender it almost melted in your mouth and paired really well with the asparagus and greens.\n\nThe frango piri piri (chicken in a piri piri sauce with greens and fries) was a sizable dish that was shareable among two people. The chicken was incredibly tender and married perfectly with the spicy flavors in the piri piri sauce. The acidic vinaigrette on the greens was a great pairing with the heat of the chicken, and I used the piri piri sauce we were given with the chips at the start of the meal to dip the chicken in for some additional flavor. The thin cut fries were fantastic and soaked up some of the juices from the chicken.\n\nOur dinner plates were cleared and our waitress came by with dessert menus; it's rare that I don't want to look at a dessert menu so I was grateful she brought them, but also took notice of the fact that she didn't ask if we wanted dessert, she just dropped the menus in front of us and left. We shared the tarte de chocolate with spiced cream and espresso gelato. Very little about this dessert was good. The gelato - the best part - was the tiniest serving of gelato I've ever been served, while the spiced cream spread over the entire tart completely overwhelmed all the other flavors on the plate. I couldn't fully appreciate the espresso flavor of the gelato, and had I been blindfolded I might've thought I was eating pumpkin pie. Hardly any of the chocolate suffocating under the cream came through, and the crust was way too hard to cut into with a spoon.\n\nAfter dessert our waitress dropped the check on the table and left without a word. She didn't ask us if we'd like anything else, didn't do a final check in to make sure the meal went well. She also never thanked us. That's wait staff etiquette 101.\n\nThe meal was pricey. Before tip it came out to $107, but I didn't enjoy the food enough to feel it was worth it. Weird waitress, pretty out of the way (had to take BART and then MUNI), frustratingly slow service (I don't want to be rushed during a meal but I also don't want to be held hostage at my table for 2 hours with little interaction from any wait staff). I wouldn't return even if I were in the area.", "author": "Angela M."}

You're probably wondering how a food review could possibly have anything to do with sentiments, but I promise I'll tie these two together shortly.\n\nThe story takes place during every Yelper's favorite time of the year - Restaurant Week. My friend had a reservation for two to try the Restaurant Week menu at Uma Casa, but on the day of, her mounting foodie excitement was cut short when she was abruptly laid off from her job with no notice. When the restaurant texted to confirm her reservation, she asked to cancel given her recent job loss. Uma Casa responded back in the most generously compassionate manner inviting her to keep her reservation and dine on the house. \n\nFrom the minute we entered, we were warmly greeted by the ebullient Luca, who was full of encouraging, positive energy. Even though Luca was not our waiter, he continued to check in on us periodically throughout the night and pretty soon, his infectious personality had evolved my friend's dejected mood into lighthearted optimism. \n\nThe restaurant itself reflected Luca's affable nature - even though the decor was classy, it didn't lose its intimate, personable feel of dining in a comfortable, welcoming environment as we were surrounded by boisterous laughter and conversation in a dimly lit space. We sampled several dishes from the menu, but the standouts would definitely be 1) the salada de mariscos, a ceviche like cold dish packed with shrimp, octopus, squid, and beans, and 2) the bacalhau gomes de sa, a baked salt cod dish with perfectly balanced flavors.\n\nThank you Uma Casa, and Luca, for filling our bellies and warming our hearts!", "author": "Jenni H."}

The food was fine (other than dessert which was bad to the point of almost inducing spontaneous vomiting), maybe even better than fine, but overall a miserable experience. Probably half-full but only one waiter and he was very much overtaxed. Actually, back to food, it's just a few days later and I don't remember anything we ate so maybe that says more about the food than I thought.\n\nThe space seems to be unsure of itself. Seemingly a lot of holdover from restaurants past in this location. Not combining into anything in particular decorwise though.\n\nIt was FREEZING. Note: a waiter apologizing does not fix that. Everyone was sitting with their sweaters or winter coats on and still very cold. \"Well, it's so rarely this cold in SF so the owners didn't want to spend the money to address the draft\" is not valid. Close if you don't want to fix it. At least close on nights where it's too cold. It's nice that you brought in a space heater for the guy at the front desk (or otherwise he probably would've frozen) but bring in a few more or something for the guests. \n\nMy friend and I were going to suffer in silence but then the two separate groups next to us complained which let us all then commiserate. \n\nThe location: not enough of a draw. Not sure why there is anything in this space. Neighborhood dead, so remote, not easy to see what it is. This isn't going to be the NOPA that brings up the whole neighborhood - it's a location that will just continue to shut down whatever opens there. \n\nWon't ever be going back, can't recommend anyone else giving it a try.", "author": "Ryan B."}

Great space, lively ambiance and a solid menu, but the execution of the food was disappointing. I really wanted to like the dishes but most everything was heavy with salt. Maybe Portuguese food is supposed to be that salty, or maybe I just came on a bad day, but I unfortunately wasn't impressed enough for a return visit. The restaurant does get very busy so I'd recommend making reservations if you plan on visiting.\n\nThe menu has appetizers, small plates and large plates and is meant to be shared. For 4 people, our waiter suggested ordering about 3 appetizers and 2 large entrees. The only thing I'd recommend from the main menu is the Polvo Na Chapa (octopus).

Decently sized, and soft and moist on the inside, but I was hoping the outside would be crispier. A little too salty for my liking, but better with the salsa they had provided with the chips at the start of our meal.\n\n* SARDINHAS ASADAS ($14 for 3 pcs) - 3.5/5\n[grilled monterey sardines, caramelized onion, egg]\nThe sardines were large and meaty and had a nice grill to them, but otherwise also a little on the salty side and lacking any other flavor. The caramelized onion helped balance out the salt for the most part, but even some parts of the onion had a heavy dose of salt.\n\n/ / /  PRATOS PEQUENOS / SMALL PLATES  / / /\n* POLVO NA CHAPA ($18) - 4/5\n[pan seared octopus, fennel-bean puree, roasted cauliflower, green beans, pickled gypsy peppers]\nOnly had 3 pieces of octopus, which made it hard to share between 4 people.

At Uma Casa, every single dish was delicious and on point!!  I've already asked that we return for my birthday because I find it's so rare for a restaurant to deliver outstanding dish after outstanding dish.  Also, the restaurant is gorgeous, while our server was very attentive and knowledgeable about each dish.  \n\n\nBelow is the FOOD ORDER for 6 people, which was just the right amount\n\nSalt cod fritters [1]- Similar to crab cakes with very good fish-to-breading ratio\n\nHouse Bread [2] - There were 2 types of bread, one was corn and another was a traditional Portuguese bread.  I personally liked the oil spread\n\nGambas [2] - Definitely had a kick!  Omg sopping up the extra sauce with the bread was sooo good!\n\nOctopus [1] - Only came with 3 pieces, but only 4 of us ate it.  We made the mistake of eating the gambas first so the spicy taste overwhelmed the octopus, which unfortunately means I can't comment on the flavor.  I can say that the texture was good, not rubbery at all.  Lesson learned....next time, eat the less spicy seafood first.\n\nHalibut [1] - YUM!! We also ordered the braised short ribs, which you'd expect would overwhelm the halibut....but this fish stood its ground.  I actually want to come back for the halibut.  The sauce was excellent, and the fish was the right amount of flakiness.  \n\nRed wine braised short ribs [2] - Perfection.  The meat was cooked just right, and it pretty much fell apart when you touched it with your fork (but in a good way).\n\nBoth the Halibut and Braised Short Ribs came on a bed of veggies, which were really fresh and cooked well.  Those were gobbled up too.\n\n\nSo... this sounds like a lot of food, right?  And you'd think we'd all be rolling off our chairs in a food coma at this point.  Oh no, we stepped up and ordered 4 DESSERTS.  The apps/entrees weren't huge, and we shared family-style which I think is the only way to get the most out of eating at Uma Casa.

Uma Casa isn't the type of place I would recommend if you're in a hurry, but if you're looking for a slow leisurely dinner with delicious food and wine, then this is the place for you!\n\nI came here with 2 other friends on a Thursday evening. We made reservations two days in advance through the Uma Casa website and there were still plenty of times available. We arrived a little before our reservation time and was immediately seated since our table was ready.\n\nOur server David was very helpful in providing suggestions on their popular dishes and what to order. None of us were super hungry, so we ordered only a couple items to share:\n\nPasteis bacalhau ($10): salt cod fritters. These were good but saltier than I was expecting. I wish there was something to eat them with, like rice or bread\n\nSalada de atum ($16): raw yellowfin tuna with quail egg and onion puree. I liked this dish, the yellowfin tuna was very fresh and went well with the complimentary potato chips\n\nPolvo na Chapa ($18): grilled octopus served with a selection of vegetables. My favorite dish from the night as the octopus was unbelievably flavorful and tender. I wanted more!\n\nCarne de Porco a Alentejana ($24): braised pork and clams in a tomato-wine sauce. This dish fell flat for me a little bit, as the braised pork was a little tough and dry. My favorite part of the dish was the clams and also the thick slices of bread served with the dish. It was great dipping the bread into the tomato-wine sauce.\n\nOlive oil and lemon cake ($10): we ordered this because I was curious about the use of olive oil in the cake, but (luckily?) I couldn't really taste it over the lemon flavor. The cake was served in a couple of separate pieces and plated very colorfully with breaks and flower petals. It was just sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth without being too sweet; and I thought the firmness was perfect as well.\n\nMore so than the food, what I really loved about Uma Casa was the service. Our server David stopped to check in on us every so often but never too frequently to be annoying. He always seemed to have an eye on our wine glasses and would be right there to inquire about another glass. The restaurant was completely full at one point with some people waiting at the door, but we never felt rushed to make room for other diners, and were able to take our time catching up over the course of a long 2.5 hour dinner.\n\nI'm not sure if the kitchen was extremely busy that day and running behind, but our food came out at a slower pace than I am used to. Of course, we were all completely okay with this as it allowed us to take our time and enjoy the food while still catching up.\n\nI took muni here from downtown, but in this area parking is all street. I can usually find parking in Noe Valley pretty easily.\n\nWe ended up paying about $65 pp after tax and tip since we had some drinks with dinner as well.", "author": "Dianna H."}

Great drinks, authentic and flavorful food, and fun ambience.\n\nMade a rezzo for 5:30pm on a Saturday. We were one of the first tables seated, though by the time we finished around 6:30 it was a full house. We ordered the warm olives, house bread, and shrimp turnovers to start. Skip the olives unless you're an olive fanatic, they came out a bit mushy. The bread was good, interesting that it was served with olive and chorizo butter. The shrimp turnovers were outstanding.\n\nWe also had the baby gem lettuce salad, gulf shrimp, and octopus. The salad and octopus were excellent. Octopus easily the top 3 I've had in SF. The gulf shrimp was a bit different than I expected, a bit spicy in a tomato based sauce.

I'd definitely come here again the next time I'm in San Francisco! Easy reservation through Resy! Overall rating: A\n\n\nIt was me and my friend's first time trying Portuguese cuisine. Generally, I'm not a seafood fan but they really impressed me here. Everything was superb. They serve each dish as it's ready. Everything was well paced. They don't change your plates between dishes unless you request it. (I needed to do so because the first dish was spicy and I didn't want to alter the following dishes' flavor profiles.) We split a couple dishes. Here's what we got:\n\n-Complementary homemade potato chips with a mild pureed tomato sauce(?): Delicious!\n\n-GAMBAS MO\u00c7AMBIQUE small plate (gulf shrimp, garlic, white wine, olive oil, malagueta): Spicy sauce and the shrimp was perfectly cooked! The sightly charred bread to mop up the sauce was a great touch! A+\n\n-POLVO DOURADO small plate (cornmeal crusted octopus, roasted pepper emulsion, summer squash, corn, watercress salad): The octopus was nice and tender! Very good! Only thing I didn't like was the surprise celery in the side salad. I hate celery. A\n\n-CARNE \u00e0 JARDINEIRA large plate (braised beef short rib, english peas, carrots, green beans, fingerling potatoes): This was more like a stew. You could tell this was cooked for a long time. The flavors all really melded together for a hearty dish! It could've easily been bland but it really held its own. The short rib was fork tender. A+\n\n-PASTEL de NATA dessert (Portuguese egg custard tart): My first time having the famous Portuguese egg custard tart! I've only had Chinese and Macau egg custard tarts before. This was actually my least favorite version. Online photos show the tops as almost bruleed and a lovely spotted brown. Ours came out pale. When I bit into the tart the custard came spilling out. It tasted undercooked to me. This was the most disappointing part of my meal, which is sad because I love dessert so much! This needs improvement please! B-\n\n\nMy friend got a sherry based cocktail (Adonis) and I got a Portuguese beer (Melo Abreu Especial bottle). Both drinks were just ok. I love that their drinks are Portuguese! Very authentic! There are no prices on their online menus annoyingly. FYI we paid a total of about $95.00 (before tip) for 2 small plates, 1 large plate, 2 alcoholic drinks, and 1 dessert. This is great for a nice romantic/slightly higher end dinner than your everyday restaurant. I miss this restaurant now that I'm home in NYC. Hopefully, Uma Casa will be around for a long time so I can return here in the future!", "author": "D D."}

It started out good, then half way through the meal we almost became an afterthought to the server's larger surrounding tables. It took 15-20 minutes for our entree to come out after our small plate was consumed. We waited an additional length of time for our entree and finally our dessert plates to be cleared. After the completion of our meal, we waited for 10 minutes until he finally dropped off our check and then never bothered to pick it up even though he walked by three times. I eventually had to give it to the host who gave it to the wrong server to ring up. Our server eventually came back only to drop the check off again! Obviously, he was not paying attention. We finally got our check after a 20 minute ordeal. I commented to the host when we left that the food was amazing, but the service was horrible.

I had been back for a day and half from a timezone that is 15 hours ahead of here, thus my comprehension of food and time were a little mixed up. However, I knew one thing - I wanted a cool place for a meal. I wanted something not Asian because I go to Asia on a regular basis now for work. \n\nFunny enough, Uma Casa means Grandma's House in Portuguese and one of my new favorite restaurants (not the one by the West Lake but near my hotel) in Hangzhou is called Grandma's House and it had the best begger's chicken. So I knew whatever it had, not going to get chicken. \n\nShort ribs was a much safer bet. Really wanted a salad after a week of no salad (can't trust such things even though it's probably okay in Asia), so the arugula salad came to the rescue. Had also the pickled veggies. Then the shrimp. All very good.  Dessert has a few things that seemed decent and we had the berries pie.\n\nAll in all, a decent meal. It's not Fernando's, which is a beach front restaurant in Macau, and it's not Europe, this to me is a very Americanized version of it, and for what it is worth, the price is very reasonable and the food very good. For quiet Noe, this spot was hopping. \n\nGlad that I was able to check off this April edition hottest restaurant list. So good to finally have a Portuguese place to serve the ever so demanding, food culture centric society that is called San Francisco.", "author": "Victoria E."}

Definitely more of a European vibe, as the wait was a bit long even though the place was empty. We stood at the front for awhile without any direction before a hostess came. No big deal, service was still really friendly! We ordered the salt cod fritters, the cauliflower soup, the octopus, and the ribeye. Our waitress recommended that we order 3-5 dishes, but we ended up ordering way too much! The cod fritters were pretty good! Super salty- but it was not dense and potato-y like I thought it would be. It was in fact mostly shredded fish inside. A good fried crisp on the outside. Defitely would skip the cauliflower puree- this had no flavor to me, other than a bit sour. The octopus was delicious! The cornmeal batter is super light so you can mostly taste the tender octopus and the salad that it came with as very refeshing with the corn and squash. The ribeye was ok, but we were so full by then we could barely eat any. It was a bit too charred for me, but the leftovers the next day were good. Overall- a fun place to dine, food is not bad.

For the most part, every dishes that I had here were pretty good.\n\nWe started with the salt cod fritters. I enjoyed this dish. It was fried nicely and it had a nice texture (soft on the inside crispy on the outside). I thought the mayonnaise that came with it could use some acid or it needed some kick.\n\nNext we had the gambas (aka shrimp). This dish was pretty good as well. It had a bold onion, garlic flavor, and it was pretty spicy, not sure what type of peppers they used but I liked it! The dish came with some grilled bread to soak up the sauce.\n\nOur next dish was the grilled chicken wings with piri piri spices. They were grilled to perfection. Nice charred flavor, and the piri piri spices were tasty. It wasn't that spicy.\n\nFor our main courses, we had the pan roasted sea bass and the braised pork with clams. The sea bass dish was just okay. I think the fish was slightly over cooked although I really liked the condiments that came with it: some dices tomatoes and red onion salsa with some saut\u00e9ed greens and garbanzo beans. It was simple and light. The pork dish was okay too. Pork was tender (pretty lean), the clams tasted fresh, and the sauce was delicious. \n\nDesserts were just okay so not worth mentioning them.\n\nOverall I had enjoyed my first Portuguese dining experience although I didn't have anything that blew me away. Service was friendly and attentive, and that's why I decided to give this place four stars.

Our server was David, he treated us right, and was very knowledgeable about the Portuguese wines, as well (we shared a bottle of the \"Foz de Arouce Beiras Baga Beira Atlantico 2012\" on his recommendation and it was great).\n\nHere's the stuff we had (uh, yeah, it was a lot of food for the 3 of us, but there weren't any leftovers!!) I was running 30 min late, but my friends had got there on time, and, thankfully, got some awesome food recommendations from the barkeep (thanks, guys!!). Using those as a base, we added a few things of our own, and here's all the stuff we came up with:\n\nAZEITONAS - warm olives, olive oil, lemon, garlic, herb\nP\u00c3O COM MANTEIGA - house-made bread, chouri\u00e7o butter, olive butter\nPASTEIS DE BACALHAU - salt cod fritters, cilantro mayo\nSARDINHAS ASADAS - grilled monterey sardines, caramelized onion, egg\nSALADA DA TERRA - roasted beets, butternut squash, farro, cumin-honey vinaigrette, radish\nPOLVO NA CHAPA - pan seared octopuses, white bean fennel puree, roasted cauliflower, green beans, pickled gypsy peppers\n\"SOPAS\" - braised beef short rib, bread base, marble potatoes, cabbage, carrots, mint\n\nI also tried the \"Low Groan\" cocktail (their take on a Negroni) in the beginning of the meal, as well as one of the Madeiras, the Rare Wine Co New York Malmsey, at the end - both were awesome.\n\nEverything was superb, and it was an amazing night out - very much looking forward to the next time I can make it - kudos to the staff & to David!!", "author": "Jesse E."}

We came a few weeks ago the day after the opening and were blown away. We didn't think to make a reservation but we were able to snag one of the last spots at the communal table to begin our meal. Neither A nor I had ever had Portuguese food so we didn't really know what to expect. Our waitress was able to make us a few recommendations. We decided to split a snack, a small plate and a large plate. I also ordered a glass of Vinho Verde ($9) which was the perfect compliment to the meal. \n\nWe ordered:\n\n-Rissois de Camaro ($8) - This was our \"snack\" and were described to us as Shrimp Turnovers. They were scrumptious. Honestly. I could have had 3 of these plates for dinner and been content. Very satisfying.\n\n-Codorniz Vinho De Alhos ($15) - This was our small plate and it was AWESOME. We wanted to order the Arroz de Pato but they were out and honestly, I am happy we had the chance to order this. I normally do not love fried food but this was delightful. I wish they served this in a bigger plate portion because I would be all over it.\n\n-Alcatra ($26)-This was our main and was delicious. Very hearty. Great flavors. Would order again and would recommend.\n\nOur waitress misheard our order initially so we were brought the Caldeirada ($28) as well. Once she realized the mistake, she generously left it for us to try while they prepared the Alcatra and removed it from our bill. We were really happy we got to sample this as well. If you're into seafood, this dish is meant for you. Neither A nor I eat a TON of fish so this may have been our least favorite.\n\nThere were a few hiccups in service while we were there but that is to be expected since they are so new. It seemed like the runners did not know which table was which but usually, it was close enough that the party who ordered the food could figure out it was theirs. Our waitress also dropped the free chips and sauce when she was bumped into but she took it in stride and didn't even let out a single curse. I know I would have :) I cannot wait to come back. This place is amazing and honestly, a place that is worth traveling to even if you're not in the Noe/Mission/Bernal Heights area. It was a real treat.", "author": "Carrie W."}

You know, the \"I'm Chinese so I know what good Chinese food is...Fat Kok has the best and most authentic egg rolls ever!\" Hmmm, except Chinese people don't really eat egg rolls. I'm 3/4ths Chinese so I know 75% of the time of what good Chinese food is. I'm kidding, I don't but I can appreciate a good egg roll. \n\nUma Casa is the first Portuguese restaurant in San Francisco that opened in the former Incanto/Porcellino space, and we visited on the third opening night. The closest I've come to Portuguese food in the city is faceplanting into a bowl of Caldo Verde Soup at Grubstake...at 2 am. Naturally, I'm going to turn to yelpers who are of Portuguese decent and it was kind of mixed for Uma Casa (granted, there weren't that many). \n\nThe menu is fairly extensive with a lot of seafood options. They have snacks ($5-$21), raw seafood ($3-$15), soups & salads ($9-$12), small plates ($12-$16), large plates ($20-$28), and desserts ($4-$9). Small wine and beer list. Low abv cocktails available. \n\nOur dinner started out strong but went downhill after our apps. \n\nWe started with the Past\u00e9is de Bacalhau: Salt cod fritters, cilantro mayo ($10): http://bit.ly/2jlk8L8 which were fantastic. The golden brown pouches were wonderfully crisp and filled my lots of minced salt cod (a staple of Portuguese cuisine). Get these! \n\nThe Gambas Mocambique: Gulf shrimp, garlic, white wine, olive oil, malagueta ($14): http://bit.ly/2j9UoCc. The shrimp were huge and perfectly cooked - firm and tender in a robust, garlic wine sauce. The accompanying grilled bread was the perfect vessel for sopping up all the sauce. \n\nThe Codorniz Vinho De Alhos: Fried, marinated quail, squash pur\u00e9e jus, pearl onions, herbs ($15): http://bit.ly/2iW09FZ was a very well balanced dish - savory (sauce) and sweet (squash) with a good punch of acid from the dressed microgreens. However, the quail didn't taste very marinated as it was a bit bland. Also, the quail could have been crisper.  \n\nThe highly anticipated Alcatra: Red wine braised short rib, sweet potato, braised greens, gremolata ($27): http://bit.ly/2ivNhTM was utterly disappointing in flavor, texture, and execution. The short rib was very tough, dry, and bland. Seems like there wasn't enough braising liquid and the short ribs weren't cooked long enough to break down the connective tissue. I like collard greens and sweet potatoes but in this dish, they were an unappetizing sour and sweet mush.\n\nI love Past\u00e9is de Nata and grew up eating them (my mom is from Macau). After seeing them at neighboring tables, my friend warned me, \"I hope you don't expect them to taste like how they're supposed to!\" Maaaan, why you gotta say that? Well, my friend was right. The Portuguese Egg Tart's ($4) non-flaky crust was really oily and there was a super thin layer of cloyingly sweet custard: http://bit.ly/2iaErNq. So disappointing that it made me want to drive to 85\u00b0C Bakery afterwards. \n\nAs for drinks, usually low abv cocktails can either taste like cough syrup or taste super bitter but I decided to try one any way (in hopes that I'll find the unicorn of low abv cocktails). The WPT ($10) tasted like a sweet carbonated sangria: http://bit.ly/2jv88uH. Unfortunately, I could only manage several sips because it was too sweet. My friend ordered a glass of wine that went undrunk. \n\nI'm very understanding and patient when it comes to grand openings but I felt like we were being rushed out of there. We weren't even there for an hour, when our bill was plopped on our table without asking if we wanted anything else like dessert. My friend looked into the waiting area and there was no one was waiting for a table. We had to flag down our server and let him know that we had wanted to try their dessert.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, we noticed that some tables had some delicious looking chips and dip on their tables (not on the menu), and some didn't. I later found out these were complimentary. I'm not the type who goes to Costco with an expired membership to fill up on all the free samples (if you are, shame on you), nor am I out for freebies but please be consistent. Every table should get the complimentary snack, yea?\n\nThe busboy and food runner were super nice though so kudos to them. \n\nThe former Incanto/Porcellino space has been brightened up with royal blue walls and beautiful rustic tiles. I like how they added a seafood station in the bar area. Unless you go on a weekday or have a 5 pm dinner, I don't recommend it for a quiet date. There was no sound dampening - with the loud music and nearly packed restaurant, it was deafening. I had to read my friend's lips and shout across the table. \n\nParking is relatively easy in the area. \n\nGo to Uma Casa for the snacks and small plates, that is all. Oh, and bring a bottle of wine with you. Sa\u00fade!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The meat was on top of a tasty bed of bread that soaked up the sauce.\n\nThe portion sizes were pretty big, as we had half the short ribs left over between the two of us.\n\nOur waiter was friendly and knowledgeable, but it felt like the place was severely understaffed.  In fact, this place probably had the slowest service of any restaurant I've ever been to in the United States (e.g. 20 minutes to get seated for our reservation, 20 minutes for drinks to arrive after ordering them, 30 minutes between appetizers and entree, 30 minutes with our credit card on the table waiting to pay with nobody picking it up).

My last job took me to Portugal several times and the food was always amazing. So I was really happy with the menu, even happier with our selection of dishes. We had \"Polvo Dourado\" (octopus) appetizer - excellent & highly recommended, crispy on outside and tender inside; the \"Mariscada\" (seafood stew with halibut, scallop, mussels, clams, shrimp, tomato-saffron broth, potatoes, grilled bread) - very good, halibut, shrimp, clams, and broth were my faves; and \"Bacalhau Gomes de S\u00e1\" (baked salt cod casserole, potatoes, caramelized onion, parsley aioli, crumbled olive, egg) - this is a very traditional dish and executed well. Between the two of us, these three dishes provided a pretty filling meal. So we only had room for a \"pastel de nata\" for dessert.  We were tempted to have a glass of Porto but we were stuffed! Really wonderful and attentive staff. Unassuming on the outside, beautiful and warm on inside with contemporary furnishings. Reminded me of being back in Portugal. We highly recommend this restaurant tucked away in the neighborhood.", "author": "Kelly W."}

It was the most affordable bottle on the menu. Understandably so - it was light but I wasn't blown away by the flavor. \nCod fritters - excellent! There were four fried cod fritters placed on some green (cilantro?) mayo. There was a lot of cod inside the fried batter, which was awesome. \nSardines - a little bit less impressed with this dish. There were three pieces of sardines (and they were pretty big) but there was nothing particularly outstanding. Watch out for the little fish bones! We spent a lot of time picking the fish from the bone. I liked the very thinly sliced eggs. \nGamba (shrimp + bread) - the shrimp were plump and juicy! And the bread was very fluffy and chewy. You can dip the bread into the tomato sauce, which had a spicy kick to it. Very good dish. \nSeafood risotto - I loved the arborio rice. It was cooked just so that it wasn't too soft, and it still had a little bite to it. The seafood in it was excellent as well - some squid, clams... but the saffron rice was the star of this dish. \nPortuguese tarts - very underwhelmed. They tasted soggy, and the crust was not flaky at all. The top was also not caramelized. They were still yummy, but only if they were not advertised as Portuguese tarts.", "author": "Julianna K."}

The massa malagueta (hot pepper paste) was ok, but was served with your regular good ol' American potato chips???? When normally it's served with cheese & bread in Portugal. And there was pickled carrots & onions? Not like Portuguese cuisine at all.\n\nCaldo verde (green soup with chorizo) was meh, a bit too salty and the chorizo was cooked in a way that was too soft, and tasted a bit strange, not like chorizo at all.

We opted for the prix fare meals with the wine for about $60 a person.  This we felt was a good deal.  We had the Bolas Bacalau, Sardines, Bacalau a gomes sa, and frango com batatas fritas.  All was delicious except for the over salted problem.  This time it was way too much like Portugal where the dishes can be too salty that they become too much to finish.  I was saddened that last time it was not overly salty.  Please cut back 3/4 of the salt as it was the only disappointment this last visit.  (end of update)\n\nThis is a great addition to San Francisco that many of us Portuguese have been waiting for,(saudades) but for many of us we need to be aware before we go that this is not our grandmothers cooking, presentation, and nostalgia we are used to or in Portugal.  This is San Francisco's version of that and if you go with the expectations of delicious Portuguese food you will get just that delicious Portuguese food and wine.  I found many of the tastes and textures different from what is traditional, but every bite never disappointed. \n\nWe started with the Pasties de Bacalhau which did not disappoint even though the texture is more smooth than what I was used to growing up and quite delicious.\n\nThe Grilled Sardines were cleaned and grilled to perfection and almost reminded me of the ones my grandmother would grill on the open flames.\n\nThe Mozambique Ship was delicious, but I think the version I make at home is a little bit better.  \n\nExcellent Service and we hope to return soon.

I came here on a date and we had a wonderful time interacting with our man, who flitted in and out and made our dish decision making easier. \n\nFood: a. m. a. z. i. n. g. \nPesticos (appetizers): we ordered the rissois de camar\u00e3o (shrimp turnovers). the breading and dough was very chewy and gooey, but the filling was just alright. \nPratos pequenos and pratos grandes (main dishes): \n\nyou MUST order the \"ervilhas com chouri\u00e7o\" (lamb chouri\u00e7o/chorizo) if you're a lamb lover. the lamb bits were incredibly flavorful and tender, and the other ingredients paired with it (snap peas, soft boiled egg with runny yolk) were fantastic texture/flavor contrasts to the meat. \n\n2nd MUST have: the Linguado (pan roasted halibut, fingerline potatoes, beans, peppers, cherry tomatoes). oh my lord. the fish was tender on the inside and just lightly crispy on the outside. i think the best part of it was the slight vinegar taste in the light watery sauce - the light sourness paired very nicely with the white fish and veggies. this was the star of the meal.\n\ndessert: sadly i don't remember the name of the desert, but it was a berry tart with pistachio gelato. classic good ol' berry goodness soaked into the buttery, crunchy crust wonderfully concluded our meal. don't forget to get a little scoop of the pistachio gelato for some good creamy balance. \n\nInterior: true to Portuguese style, in my opinion. I really loved how they used an actual stamp to brand their menus, which gave the restaurant a Portuguese rustic feel. It's also on the quieter side. Granted, I came on a Tuesday night. \n\nParking/location: Noe Valley, and therefore quiet and easy to find parking. \n\nTakeaways: if you're looking for a good date spot and a creative, fresh, and light take on Portuguese food, definitely stop by Uma Casa.

Don't allow people to make reservations at 9:30 if you're going to treat them like they are a burden. Let me start this off with the fact I was a pastry chef for 5 years; I would have to stay later than anyone in the kitchen and people were sat until 10pm in many cases. Late seatings suck, but never, ever where they served sub par food or made to feel that they were inconvenient. \n\nWe sat at 9:40 and upon asking the server how he was were told \"I'm alright\" and told immediately that the kitchen was going to close. I get it, the restaurant closes at 10pm. You allow reservations at 9:30pm. You can tell me the kitchen closes 10 mins before it does...not right when I seat. It was a cold greeting and set the tone for the meal. \n\nWe then went to order drinks about 5-7 mins later and were told that the bar was closed and that it was only beer and wine at that time! Another rushed, cold response from this restaurant. Why would you allow reservations at 9:30 if the bar closes then? You should not allow reservations that late if your amenities will be less than standard. \n\nThe meal was underwhelming.... my short rib was lukewarm in the middle because the kitchen was rushing... the quenelles on the dessert were sloppy and made just of whipped cream. Either that's a poorly composed dessert or they put whipped cream on it instead of ice cream because they had put the ice cream away for the night. It was literally plain cake, strawberries and whipped cream. The cheesecake was lumpy because the cream cheese was improperly blended too...  We even made sure to order dessert right after we got our first starter plate to make it easier on the kitchen. \n\nTo add the cherry on top, my birthday candle dessert was brought out while my best friend was in the bathroom.

We started with the salada de mariscos which was a cold dish with shrimp, octopus, squid and garbonzo beans. The sauce on this dish was amazing. I loved the WPT White port cocktail. It was light and refreshing and paired wonderfully with the seafood. The Caldo verde soup was so good with leeks and linguicia- there was a slow heat that built up. Polvo Na Chapo was next and the pan seared octopus was amazing! Perfectly tender in a delicious sauce. Caldeirada was a delicious mix of shrimp, halibut, muscles and a delicious broth served with bread to sop up all that deliciousness. We ended with a pistachio ice cream on top of a peach tart.

They get the modern aspect but completely miss on the authentic Portuguese cuisine. Being Portuguese, we wanted to love this so bad! Walking in the atmosphere seems nice, decorated with a small Portuguese touch, the tile on the walls gives it a great vibe. However, brunch was a complete miss. Walking in, we wish there was more Portuguese, the waiters were very friendly and overall made our experience better but they didn't really know Portuguese or what to recommend. The owner was also roaming around but went to his favorite tables literally every 10 seconds, why not greet everyone if you're doing that? We're all giving you the same business. Favoritism doesn't bring back new customers.\n\nWe tried a variety of plates on the menu, yet the \"family style\" options were still very small.\n\n\nOverall, I honestly don't recommend this place, you can find better, more authentic  Portuguese restaurants.

Many couldn't pronounce the Portuguese words on the menu. \n\nAs for the Sangria - White was not good too fruity with the passion fruit, Red was much better \n(DID NOT REPRESENT THE TRUE PORTUGUESE WINE WE ALL KNOW) The Portuguese are big on their wine so this was a big fail.\n\nFrom the plates our table shared, the Arroz Doce was the best.\n\nWould have like to see more upscale Portuguese art from Azores/Portugal to make it truly feel inviting.\n\nFor non-Portuguese customers the menu is difficult to visualize as there are no pictures of the plates. This did cause confusion to a table next to me where the customer expected one thing and got another and had to send it back.\n\nWas expecting the food to be more traditional with a little twist on Azorean and mainland food but was disappointed.

The venue is large with immense windows that let in plenty of light.  Tiles on  the walls throughout the place give the restaurant a slight Moorish feel, which might not be inappropriate for a Portuguese restaurant. Service was friendly and relatively efficient although it took some time for food to appear from one course to the next.\n\nSalada de rucula was composed of an immense portion of fresh arugula, sliced pears, cheese, and almonds.   The salad wasn't overly dressed and the vinaigrette wakened the appetite.  Lovely.\n\nSeafood salad contained shrimp, octopus, mussels, and garbanzo beans.  Unfortunately, I was only able to taste the garbanzos as the assertive dressing simply overpowered the seafood.  This was an appetizer sized disappointment.\n\nThe shrimp in the seafood stew called \"caldeirada\" was fine whereas the sea bass was badly overcooked and dry.  The mussels in the stew had a slight taste of fishiness rather than a light briny taste of the sea.  The caldeirada was another disappointment to me.  \n\nBy the time that I left the restaurant was near full and there was an up-beat energy to the room.", "author": "David D."}

UMA CASA is a well-needed restaurant in the city.  \nPeople ask me if these restaurants are the BEST representation of the Portuguese cuisine?  Probably the answer is NO but they are doing the BEST to exhibit the Portuguese cuisine and the culture.  We need to understand that the Portuguese cuisine is local traditionalist.  It will be impossible to have a restaurant that can represent the full spectrum of the Portuguese cuisine from Douro, Estremadura, Alentejo, Madeira, Azores and other regions. PLUS, the main ingredients cannot be found or import into the USA due to USDA restrictions in imports.  This means that chefs need to be creative and improvise the traditional dishes.  These changes are creating a new twist to the Portuguese cuisine called New Portuguese Cuisine or Ultramar Cuisine.  \n\nUMA CASA is a GOOD example of  New Portuguese Cuisine.  The New Portuguese Cuisine utilize local ingredients to replace the original homeland ingredients by creativity and improvisation.  UMA CASA's food and ambient are REALLY good.  Portuguese restaurants are loud and full of energy.  If you go to a local GOOD restaurant in the Baixa, downtown Lisbon, o Porto this is what you get, busy, noisy social people.  If you plan to have a ROMANTIC, kissy-kissy, dinner, maybe this is not the place for you but if you announce everyone will cheer you up.  Sorry, they do not pay your bill.\n\nTo all my Portuguese countrypersons, we should support the Portuguese restaurants because they are promoting our culture and roots that is locking in the Portuguese community in the USA.  Because the food that you see in these restaurants does not look like your mother's or grandma's food, does not mean it is not GOOD or is not Portuguese food.  Remember, most of these chefs know what they are doing, of course, ones better than others.  Maybe the problem is that you do not know what Portuguese food is ... or your mother's or grandmas cook a variation or improvise recipe or a personal interpretation of the food ... or maybe they did not how to cook at all ... but not be criticizing something that you do not know and least you have the opportunity to put a foot in Portugal AND ... live, eat, drink and speak the language.  If you have done that, maybe you can criticize. \n\nIn conclusion, we must support no only UMA CASA but all Portuguese's restaurants.  They are doing the best they can and we should be PROUD of these entrepreneurs.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS", "author": "Joe C."}

They also seemed to have a fair selection of Portuguese wines on the wine list as I recall as well, which is a nice touch, Portuguese wines are great. (yeah it's California, yeah, we have wine country, get over yourself and experience the world of awesome wines...)\n\nThe four in our party shared two glasses of port and the restaurant kindly split them across two glasses each so we didn't have to share.  I love it when they do that, it makes me feel welcome.\n\nThis place is a delight!

We've visited Portugal and the first thing that hit me at Uma Casa was how come we didn't find any restaurants as good in Portugal itself? Probably because we went all banal with tired traditional restaurants. Not that there might not be any hipster places there; but if there are, I'll bet they're every bit as unholy and disgraceful as the absolutely fabulous food coming out of Uma Casa.\n\nEverything we ate - short ribs, sardines and onions, green pea falafel, salad - was fantastic, and added to our go-to list.\n\nNext time I go back, and I will be going back, if it delivers like the first time, I'm upping my review to 5 stars.", "author": "Bib G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-19", "description": "Made a reservation over a week in advance for a 6:30p reservation on a Sunday. Arrived early at 6:15p, there were 2 women working the hostess stand and they said it would be a 15 min wait - no problem - and if we wanted a drink, we could go to the bar and order while we waited - also, no problem. \n\nWe did order drinks; however, when it got to be 6:45p and the lobby was swamped with people with reservations, we began to get concerned. We had to check in with the hostesses and they said our table hadn't ordered dessert yet and we would need to wait another 15 minutes or more, I suggested they buy us a cocktail, which the manager did allow. \n\nThroughout our time at Uma Casa, it's extremely clear that the hostess team and manager do not know which tables are turning and how they relate to the incoming reservations. Throughout dinner, we saw the manager walking around the restaurant with the reservations iPad, looking around like she was completely befuddled as certain tables cleared and others were full.  Therefore - diners, beware - the restaurant does not know how to turn tables and it's curious that they have three people who are in charge of this who are totally clueless.\n\nThe free cocktails we had were very tasty (Zsa Zsa and WPA). Definitely worth trying an interesting cocktail - well executed. The food - we started with the cod fritters were tasty, served the right temperature and were good. Next, we had sardines - nicely prepared with balance achieved from the acid on the sardines. We then shared a bowl of caldo verde - awesome - definitely order this Portugese specialty. Fantastic blend of kale, potato, and linguisa. The large plate we shared was sea bass with garbanzo beans, potatoes, and salsa - nicely balanced with the fresh salsa. We ended with the Portuguese tart, impossible to cut with a fork in the small plate that it is served in, definitely pick it up and take a bite.\n\nLong and the short of it - the restaurant does not know how to book and turn tables and what is particularly frustrating is that they have three people who are not communicating with their customers. A lot of this could be alleviated if they had their hostess and manager communicating with waiting customers and proactively serving up drinks to ensure that the rocky wait is worth the wait. If you decide to try this restaurant, do not be on a schedule and be prepared to ask for free cocktails as you wait...they won't be able to figure out that they need to do that proactively as they are looking around trying to figure out how the tables turn...\n\nThis is one of those places that could be a huge negative from the moment you walk in the door. This is unfortunate - the food is good. But if they can't up their service, we can all get better service going up or down the block in the neighborhood.", "author": "Nancy M."}

I REALLY wanted to like this place, but there is work to be done before I return.\n\n- Loved the facelift given to the space (former Incanto).  Lovely Portuguese beach town-like colors and materials.  Lots of light wood and blues.\n\n- Service was friendly, but definitely sophomoric.  It's a new place and the team is still finding its groove, and it shows.  Multiple servers coming to our table asking the same questions, wanting to take our orders (even after we had already ordered), coming back because they forgot our order, etc.\n\n- The wine list is very limited and the choices available are overpriced for the quality.  I buy a ton of Portuguese wine and I am familiar with a good portion of the selections on the list.  My guess is that it might be difficult to source better stuff in the Bay Area, but the mark-ups on what they did have seemed just a bit higher than usual.  I'm talking $15 wines going for nearly $50.  What disappointed me the most was anybody new to Portuguese wine would get the wrong idea from those selections!  Portuguese wines are much better than what was on the list.  However, the Port and tonic cocktail was great and very authentic.  We should have stuck to them.\n\n- Finally to the food...  I am not going to dissect each dish we had. The menu itself was very traditional, which is a blessing and a curse.  I was happy to see familiar dishes but I also knew how they should be prepared.  I would grade each dish from a B (pork Alentejo style) to C (cod cakes).  I felt there was a general lack of seasoning and subpar execution (calde verde soup was very bland, cod cakes were bland and dry).  My sincere hope is the food will improve and evolve with time.  \n\nThe custard cake for dessert was a crime.  Having just eaten numerous \"pasteis de nata\" while in Lisbon (and even in Macau back in November) I know a good custard tart (and my waste shows it).  What Uma Casa is serving bears no resemblance to the Portuguese custard tarts I know and love.  Next time I would try a different dessert; they looked much better.\n\nI'm going to give this place a couple of months before I return - it has promise.", "author": "B M."}

We came pretty late (around 9:30pm) on a Saturday night and the place was fully booked. Luckily we got a seat at the bar wishing about 5 min. \n\nWanting to try everything, we ended up ordering the first four dishes off the small plates menu (spicy shrimp, chicken wings, polenta with mushrooms and duck with risotto) to share between the two of us. The shrimp came out first and they were BOMB. The spicy, slightly sour sauce they were cooked in was amazing! I wanted to drink a bottle of it and slather it on everything I owned. The waiter brought over extra bread for us to finish up the sauce with, unfortunately our other waiter took our plates away (to my protest!) before the bread came out. \n\nThe other 3 dishes were good, but not as memorable. Maybe because I was still thinking about those shrimp. The wings could've been cooked a little longer to get that char grilled taste. The duck with cherries was good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the risotto cake on the bottom. Polenta is normally one of my favorite foods, but the mushroom sauce was just a little too rich for my liking. \n\nI will definitely be back for the shrimp Mozambique though! They have a pretty good wine selection too.", "author": "Trena M."}

This latest is, in my estimation, the best.  Though I've eaten a good deal of Spanish food, I've never had purely Portuguese, so I was looking forward to trying it.  The new d\u00e9cor works very nicely as they've replaced the heavy wooden furniture with a sleeker seating and painted the ceiling a mixture of blue and white creating an airy inviting vibe overall.  \n\nService was great as our waiter and support staff were never far not that we needed much.  \nWe began with the RISSOIS DE CAMAR\u00c3O (shrimp turnovers) that were quite good, crunchy on the exterior with a warm and tasty interior.  For our main course, my partner ordered ALCATRA (braised short rib) and I opted for the BACALHAU GOMES DE S\u00c1 (salt cod and potato baked in a casserole) which is very similar to a Provencal brandade. We each enjoyed our choice very much.  \n\nI was a bit surprised to read that some reviewers found the portions on the small side as both of us (and we have healthy appetites) left quite full.  In fact, I suspect two people could share the bacalhau.  We had no room for dessert, but the list was enticing.  As to wine, we chose a bottle of Quinta de Chocopahla Castelao that was quite good and paired well with both of our entrees.  We shall definitely return to Uma Casa. \n \nOne final note:  we reserved at 6:00 and thought we might have an empty house around us.  However, that proved a misguided assumption as the place was hopping by 6:30.  So be sure to make a reservation especially if you want to visit on a weekend.", "author": "Nigel P."}

The restaurant entry way is warm and inviting. The tiles and the music all add to light hearted atmosphere. We shared some olives which were pretty standard mix of black and green olives, nothing distinctive. Then we shared bread with butter, and their specialty butters were yummy, but kind of expensive for what it was. Then we shared the octopus which was pretty tender and flavorful. We finished with the caldeirada. That stew was fantastic, extremely rich with lots of delicious seafood inside. My favorite part of the whole experience was the port here! Generally the portions are a bit small and the prices expensive for how much you get. The port though made the whole thing worth it, it is so amazing and you have to come experience of nothing else.

Had the pleasure of tasting the absolute treasures produced from the kitchen. There is a lot of heart and passion that went into each dish that shows the chef's love of Portugal.\nFood: I can't say what exactly was my favorite since it was all good. Uma casa shows their love and respect for seafood which is often hard to do! the bacaloao was extremely tasty. The team was able to embrace the freshness of the fish even after frying it. I'm pretty sure I could live off the shrimp croquettes and be set for life. Also another bit of magic by producing a fried item that tastes incredibly fresh (and lemony!). The ahi tuna was cute and prepared perfectly and we thoroughly enjoyed the bite of olive in the mix that provided the perfect amount of salt. I can't wait to return to spend an evening by the oyster bar. The non-seafood bites were equally scrumptious. The duck/risotto filled ball has a nice subtle duck flavor amongst creamy risotto and the Kale/mushroom empanada had a great filling and an absolute perfect crust. I adored the filling but I could have had the crust alone and still be happy.\nDrinks: Delicious punches and a great wine selection\nScene: the restaurant is gorgeous.

We started with a fresh cheese and chorizo butter spread, accompanied by Acme baguette, and it was a delicious beginning.\n\nThe first official course was a grilled octopus salad, with corn and tomatoes and a few other things. The octopus was not chewy at all, and the whole salad was a variety of different colors and textures and flavors. It may have been my favorite dish. The presentation, like all that was to come, was beautiful.\n\nNext up was a salt cod dish, which was also memorable for unique flavors and presentation. Everything worked together and was just wonderful. The entree of pork tenderloin with tomato-chorizo sauce and clams was just as good as everything that came before it. I can't keep using the same adjectives to describe dishes...just know that everything was awesome.\n\nFor dessert, it was a lemon-verbena custard with some time of shortbread-y cookie, gelato and figs. I am not a fan of figs so it was the only thing all night I left on the plate when I finished. But the rest was fantastic and not too sweet, and made for a great ending to the meal. \n\nChef Telmo was talkative throughout the night, and explained a few dishes to us as they were brought over.

I was looking forward to having the Sardines... they were out.  I was looking forward to trying the Polvo... it is no longer on the menu.  So we chose a couple of other appetizers.  The cod fritters were good, so was the drink my wife ordered.   Then things started to fall apart.  The arugula salad we ordered came to the table missing the cheese it was supposed to have.  We had to ask for it, nonetheless, it was ok.  Kitchen mistakes are common in new restaurants.\n2. Both my wife and I ordered the Bacalhau a Gomes de Sa.  Both dishes took 45 minutes to come to the table.  The server was very attentive and apologetic, but still, 45 minutes is a bit much.  \n3. We tried to be very understanding because the restaurant is new and is clearly still trying to find its pace.  But once we got the dishes, mine was so overcooked that the dish was pretty much  \"cod flavored mashed potatoes\" (like a cod Shepherd's pie). I could not identify a single piece of fish or potatoes, it was all mashed together along with a lot of onions, I mean a lot of onions.  My wife's dish was a little better, you could see a couple of pieces of potatoes and some small pieces of fish, however she found a hair in her dish - yes, a hair - (which she didn't tell me about until we left), so she could not eat it.  \n4. For dessert, we had the pastel de nata.  It tasted nothing like the original.  What was supposed to be a flaky dough was a caramelized shell I could not identify...what was supposed to be a smooth, creamy custard, was a lumpy super sweet egg filling of some sort. \n5. I also found the wine list to be very limited.  I tried the glass recommended by the waiter but didn't care for it, so I ordered a diet coke.   They don't have any diet/light/sugar free sodas.  Most restaurants in Portugal will have \"coca light\".\n6. The music was loud and \"pop like\" and the space was super bright which I found to be very at odds with the concept.\n\nWell, maybe I had the wrong expectations.   On a positive note, the staff was very friendly and responsive and the flavors are there.  They have a lot of work to do though when it comes to training the kitchen staff.", "author": "R X."}

Have to say, the waiter was great about the wine rec cuz I was clueless about Portuguese wine.  Shrimp cane first and was solid. Salad was sublime. Dunno if they added sugar to the dressing but the full tilt sweetness counter-balanced against the bitterness of the arugula was amazing on top of the pears & cheese. \n\nDuck never came so can't comment on that.

We had an early Tuesday night reservation and were seated timely and served a bowl of home made chips and pepper sauce that were delicious.   Sadly, that and the wine was the best thing we had all night.   I ordered a Salada de Rucula that proved to be a large plate of arugula with a few apple slices, cheese and almonds.   It would have been fine for a lunch, but the amount of arugula was simply too much to balance out the other ingredients and to serve as a starter.   That was followed by the Salada de Mariscos that was a few octopus bits, a mussel, a shrimp and a lot of garbanzo beans.  This dish was simply too salty to eat and my dinner companion and I both passed on it.   We then split the Robalo and the fish was beautifully cooked.   Unfortunately, it was also served with a whole lot of garbanzos that were quite hard.   I  thought maybe i just didn't know how they were supposed to be eaten but when my diner companion bounced two off the table, we gave up on them.   Still being hungry, we ordered the Portugese custard tart for dessert.   It was baked to within an inch of its life and so tough that it could not be torn apart, much less cut.  \n\nMy rating would have been two stars had it not been for the extremely nice and competent staff.   They took the Robalo off the bill because of the hard garbanzos.  Whether it is an inability to deal with the sudden popularity and crowds or just an off night I can't say.

The staff is amazing and helpful and the food is delicious.  I loved the citrus salad with beets and parsnips - really amazing and so beautiful we took a picture (which I never do). The atmosphere is welcoming and bustling but quiet enough to have a conversation.  I will definitely go back!", "author": "Sandy B."}

I haven't been to Portugal yet so I was unfamiliar with the menu and cuisine but I am a believer now, I may even have to add Portugal up on my travel list. We had the duck rice(I forget the actual names) and fish stew, both were amazing! Our waiter Pablo was so welcoming, funny and attentive!  And the chef/owner even stopped by our table just to say hi!  Super nice guy and a great chef! We will be back!", "author": "Eric S."}

The inside is beautiful but that's just the beginning. Ordered a couple of appetizers (you CAN'T miss the shrimps) and a main course and as a Spaniard it made me travel back to the Iberian peninsula. Definitely coming back!", "author": "Z W."}

The appetizers were well prepared and presented beautifully. The seafood salad with white beans was loaded with flavor as well as the beet salad. The salted cod baked with onions and potatoes and egg slices on top was beautifully presented and the dish came together perfectly. Good atmosphere, able to talk w/o shouting. The only complaint was the stools at the community table...very uncomfortable!!! Definitely would go back. Want that salt cod recipe. Amazing!", "author": "Jean E."}
