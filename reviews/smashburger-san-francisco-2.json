That is it's high quality fast food (e.g. In-N-Out) rather than slightly more refined \"fast casual\" (e.g. Super Duper).  Don't get me wrong, I'm totally loving it as a fast food burger contender.\n\nClassic Smash: I'm a huge fan of the Maillard reaction, so can totally appreciate a burger patty that tries to maximize it.  It's  patty that is literally smashed so it has as much crispy surface areas as possible.  The umami crunchy goodness from the patty dominates the whole burger experience, in a good way.\n\nFried Pickles: These were great.  Not too much batter and not too little.  The pickles were nice and crisp, not limp and soggy.  A nice tartness in each bite to contrast the rich deep fried coating.  A creamy dipping sauce to add another flavor dimension.  The only complaint I'd have is that an order is way too big for one person.  The sodium heavy nature of the pickles makes it hard to get through more than half.  Kinda wish they offered a half-n-half with one of the deep fried potato options as the other half.", "author": "Adam B."}

It's a fast-casual place so is ostensibly slightly higher-end than In and Out, but in my opinion does not quite rise up to Five Guys or Super Duper levels of quality and scrumptiousness, even though it has a far larger menu.\n\nI found the food at this location to be OK. The large BBQ bacon and cheddar was fairly priced given its size and quality. Tip: if you're hungry, go with a large instead of a regular. Meanwhile, the onion rings were OK, sort of like diner quality, and indeed the entire experience felt like diner fare dressed up in a standardized venue as opposed to a retro, independent one.

I told the girl who took our order that I ordered a burger with BBQ sauce but the cooks forgot to add it. She looked at me like I was being difficult.

I got a regular sized Club smash burger with sweet potato \"smash fries\". Smash fries are just regular french fries that are tossed in olive oil and Rosemary. Tip: don't order things that are fried and then tossed in oil -_-  I really didn't like the rosemary flavor  & these fries were just dripping in oil, it was REALLY unappetizing. I didn't finish the fries because they were really grossing me out, and the words \"I didn't finish the fries\" has never before been uttered from my mouth so....\n\nThe burger was just OK. The meat was flavorful and crusty, the way you'd dream a smash burger to be. But the couple thin slices of brown avocado hurt my feelings and the greasy fast food style bacon left a lot to be desired. \n\nSo then I ordered another burger  the truffle mushroom chicken was HELLA good. But so tiny guys srsly wtf. This burger was 3 bites, literally less substantial than a McD's cheeseburger. The regular smash fries (don't ask how I know this) were less gross than the sweet potato ones, but EVEN GREASIER and still gross and the portion was less than half the amount served with the sweet p'tates.  So all kinds of fries were left behind, never thought I'd see the day.  So I'm driving home and all the sudden I just feel super green. Good news is that I didn't throw up. Yet. But I'm positive I will before the night is over and that's why I should have just thrown my $25 in the toilet and saved myself some time.  \n\nSo, probably the better idea is to order the large size burger instead of being like me ordering a regular size burger and then realizing it's not enough food. I can't attest to whether a large burger would be enough but this place is super overpriced and it was annoying to me to see things like digital menu screens when they should be saving their money on those frills and offering bigger portions. I came in here at 7 o'clock, peak dinnertime hour, and the place was completely empty. \n\nI also didn't like how I could see the cashier pre-scooping the metal milkshake containers full of ice cream and then putting them back in the freezer to wait for somebody to order one. It takes five seconds to put ice cream in a cup so why would you pre-scoop it and then just let it sit in the freezer to get freezer burn? She was making like six or seven of them & the place was totally empty. I noticed that she was weighing the ice cream, so I imagine that's why she was doing them ahead of time, so that her stingy boss doesn't get mad at her for putting a teaspoon too much ice cream in somebody's milkshake. Smash burger: that's a bad idea, don't do that anymore. \n\nAnother thing: this cashier was handling money and then scooping ice cream with no gloves on and she also had her long curly hair in kind of a wild ponytail and when she would lean over to scoop the ice cream, her ponytail would slide off her shoulder and into the freezer. This is why you shouldn't have people who are trained to be cashiers handling food.\n\nOkbai.", "author": "Emma H."}

Very clean interior space and it reminds me a bit of a Shake Shack. Definitely check this place out especially when they're offering BOGO promos.\n\nSMASHFRIES\nBasically super thin shoestring fries. Delicious with the herbs dusted on top but extremely oily and greasy. The highlight really is the ketchup because I noticed that it tasted slightly sweeter than the regular Heinz ketchup and then I checked the bottle at the table and saw that their ketchup was made specially for Smashburger. I actually like their secret brand of ketchup more so than regular ketchup. \n\nSPICY JALAPENO BAJA \nBurger presentation is pretty fancy as you get it in a metal tray basket lined with their Smashburger wrapping paper.

So let me break down everything, the food, the restaurant, the service.\n\nThe food, 2 burgers, the original smash burger served with smashed 6oz or 8oz patty with red onions, tomatoes, lettuce and slightly toasted bun, add your own condiments, grade B- despite it being oily, the burger was good, good meat to bun ratio, not super heavy almost light burger again minus the dripping oil from the burger. The BBQ Bacon & cheddar burger, if you have had carls jr big western, this is the same exact thing, only difference instead of onion rings here it is lightly battered onion strings, the bbq sauce is prominent on every bite 6oz or 8oz is offered cheddar slice is heavy, even ordering an 8oz barely tasted the meat grade for this burger C, copy cat burger, oily, could not taste the meat even though it was an 8oz. The fries offered are the regular thin cut type fries deep fried and seasoned with salt lightly, the other is the smash fries, garnished with olive oil, diced garlic and rosemary; splurge on the smash fries, the vanilla shake was heavenly, heavy froffy, delicious so bad for diabetics haha if you can sample their shakes\n\nThe location is in the protrero area in the city, odd choice for a burger spot but I guess it works since the next closest location is in Alameda, very clean inside, very polite staff.

They took over 20 minutes to remake the burger (why couldn't you just slap 2 pieces of bacon and call it a day? Were they getting that bacon fresh from the pig?!).

Oh wait, here I go... \"Pooh-pooh!\" There, I feel better now. I am, however, willing to take exception for Smashburger because I frankly never heard of them before they decided to take over the old Blockbuster Video space at the Potrero Center where I go to the Safeway anyway. I go to I Luv Sushi & Teriyaki, too, so I'm no food snob, y'see. And besides, Jamie W. misses going to Wendy's when there used to be more of them in the city. So I'll just keep my 'pooh-pooh' to myself in the privacy of my home where I can roll my eyeballs as much as I want.\n\nWe came here one Sunday evening when we needed a burger fix and was surprised how empty it was. There are all sorts of instructions on the wall that you're supposed to follow. But we're guys so... I just went up and kept looking at the overhead menu until I was ready to order as the cashier heaved a series of sighs to hurry me along. I went for the $7.39 Bay Big Smashburger with Truffle Mushrooms and Swiss Cheese along with an order of their Smashfries and a 22-ounce Diet Coke. It added up to a bit short of $13. The burger was a wide, flat patty, rather greasy as the cheese was epoxied to it with the mushrooms melted into the cheese (photo: http://bit.ly/1wT8Mgj).\n\nIt was OK but nothing that would worry In-n-Out in my book. The Smashfries were strangely thin like potato sticks but flimsier and greasier with a bit of seasoning on them (photo: http://bit.ly/1tS487g). I frankly think I would have preferred some White Castle krinkle fries instead because I like the bulk. Jamie did a switcheroo on me and went for a Spicy Baja Jalape\u00f1o Smashchicken. Whatevs. So we came back just recently feeling like I should eat a little lighter. Where else should I go but Smashburger? Am I right or what? This time I ordered the $5.99 Baja Cobb Salad with fresh greens, sharp cheddar cheese, crispy Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes, onions and quite inexplicably, a fried egg.\n\nWithout knowing the egg was coming, I also requested the Grilled Chicken for $2 extra. It was all excessively covered in a spicy chipotle dressing, and the mix of egg and smashed chicken was too much for me (photo: http://bit.ly/1yr1mmb). I hate having the parent-child poultry together if you know what I'm saying. I skipped the Smashfries this time in favor of the $2.99 Veggie Frites, which are green beans and thickly julienned carrots combined together and flash-fried (photo: http://bit.ly/1CPYzYI). Oily, very oily. Nice attempts at some different things you wouldn't expect from a fast-food chain, but it just didn't quite come together for me.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...the burger isn't bad but kinda greasy and overpriced, the salad's a  better deal but a bit overdressed...they do give you plenty of choices\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...fairly spacious for a fast-food space and never that crowded when we're there\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...a weak area but it is a franchise after all\nTOTAL - 3 stars...fast food joint with bigger aspirations but still middling in execution", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-07", "description": "With a recommendation from a trusted co-worker, we were off to the Potrero Center in search for a burger. For years I've driven past their location in Novato but never had the opportunity of trying their food until today. Smashburger is a fast-casual eatery, similar to Five Guys or Chipotle. As I walked in, you're instructed to grab a menu as you make your way to the front counter. Even with 5 of 6 customers in front of us, the line moved rapidly giving me just enough time to look over the menu. \n\nThe menu is broken into two main sections: burgers or \"smashburgers\" and chicken sandwiches, appropriately called \"smashchicken\". Whether you're in the mood for beef or poultry, you have plenty to choose from with roughly 7 or so sandwiches to choose from or you can create your own. Additionally fresh salads and a kids menu are also offered. A variety of french fries are offered from traditional to spicy, as well as onion rings, fried pickles, or a side salad. Of course a burger shack isn't complete until shakes and malts are involved.\n\nI settled on ordering the Spicy Jalapeno Baja grilled chicken sandwich. The toppings sounded too goo to pass up: guacamole, pepper jack, lettuce, tomato, onion & chipotle mayo on a spicy chipotle bun. The sandwich was priced at a more than reasonable $7.29, which led me to add a side salad for only $2.99. After placing your order, you're given a number and can seat yourself anywhere.\n\nLess than 10 minutes later, my order was delivered to my table. The tray of food not only looked great but healthy and fresh. I was a little perplexed because the chicken was paper thin, making me think it was an egg, but after looking at it closely, it was the all-white grilled chicken. I took a few bites of the sandwich without altering the taste with any sauce or condiments and it was downright tasty. The baja flavors really worked well and had plenty of heat with the jalapenos and chipotl mayo. I added a bit of yellow mustard and it was a surprisingly tasteful sandwich packing plenty of flavor.\n\nI ordered my side salad with their house vinaigrette which was better than most placed. Sure, the fries my co-worker was enjoying looked better than my rabbit food, but maybe next time. All in all, the side salad was a perfect combo to the otherwise healthy lunch. Once I had finished my meal, I was satisfied; was I stuffed? No. But it was just the right amount. Overall, not only was I impressed with the quality of food Smashburger delivered but also the value in an otherwise pricey city.\n\nAmbiance/Decor: 4/5\nFood: 4/5 \nService: 4/5\nPrice: $\nOverall: 4/5\n\nPros:\n+ Beef or Chicken, your choice smashburger\n+ 7 or so specialty smashburgers \n+ Salads, fries and sides also available\n+ Fast, fresh and tasty food\n+ Reasonably priced ($11 for a chicken smashchicken and side salad)\n+ Fast and friendly service\n+ Local beers available\n+ Ability to order online for pickup\n\nCons:\n- Chicken was a little on the skinny side, beef it up!", "author": "Alexander E."}

However, I was able to enjoy a few Smashburger gift cards given to me for my birthday. This allowed me to give the place a fair shot at the competition. I've been here several times so I'm going to condense my experiences into one review.\n\nI have tried several of their burgers, notably the Truffle Mayo Smashburger, Classic Smashburger, Avocado Chicken Club (crispy), and the Smashchicken Spicy Jalapeno Baja burger. They advertise a gourmet burger and are higher end compared to most fast food restaurants. They make the chicken super crispy which is a reason why I like it so much. It's probably slightly healthier too but that's debatable... Definitely get Smashfries with that. They are drizzled with olive oil and garlic! The potatoes are sliced super thin (almost like a shoestring). You'll also need to wash that down with something cold. Get a vanilla shake with that and you'll be leaving in a wheel barrow. The shake is delicious with whipped cream on top. Do it. Thank me later.\n\nBless the workers that put up with indecisive people. I was literally next in line but the large group people in front of me spent 10 minutes trying to get an order right. It was the worst experience ever... It also didn't help they all paid separately.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-15", "description": "I was excited to discover that there was a Smashburger in San Francisco. I lived in Denver several years ago, and there was a Smashburger by my office -- I went frequently for lunch and have nothing but fond memories of how high quality and delicious the food was.\n\nMy recent experience at the San Francisco Smashburger proved otherwise; my burger and haystack onions arrived *barely* warm, if even hot at all. It was obvious that it had been sitting under a heat lamp for more than 10 minutes as the oil on the burgers had started to curdle and congeal. The haystack onions were far too salty, and again, were at room temperature. The meal I had there lacked the freshness and flavors that I fondly remember from my Denver days. I ate half the burger and only managed a couple of onion rings before I pushed the entire thing away from me. What a waste of food and money.\n\nTo top it all off, I'm pretty sure that the poor quality of food was a direct result of our less than stellar customer experience. Although the restaurant was empty, and the person working the register was experiencing issues with entering our order. He tried to enter it multiple times, and we were stuck having to give our order over and over again. During that time, however, it appeared that our first order had registered after all, but proceeded to sit under the heat lamp for a good 10-15 minutes until our register had officially gone through. \n\nAdding insult to injury, the ladies bathroom was filthy; one toilet was clogged with poop. \n\nI'm extremely disappointed in my experience. I've been such a big fan of Smashburger for so long, and was one of the chain's largest advocates, telling my friends that it was far superior to other beloved chains like In N Out and Five Guys. Guess I was wrong, because I've never had the terrible meal and experience that I had at Smashburger at either of those places.", "author": "Michelle L."}

The word \"smash\" had me thinking this place was a gym. But \"burger\" clearly implies this place serves food. And to top it off, the font reminds me of GameStop.\n\nAt any place that specializes in burgers, I always order a beef patty burger. (Chicken burgers and salads? No thank you.) So far, I've tried the avocado bacon burger, truffle mushroom swiss burger, and BBQ bacon cheddar burger. All of them were very filling, but very greasy and heavy. The avocado was a skimpy portion, and the truffle-infused mayo was very strong and pungent. The meat patty was cooked medium-well to well-done, but it's unmemorable and not very juicy.\n\nThe sweet potato fries were very fresh and crispy, but lacked flavor. However, I do like the smashfries, which is thin-cut fries tossed with olive oil, garlic, and rosemary. It's very flavorful and delicious. Incorporate herbs into fries and I'm sold!\n\nSmashBurger is a huge step up from McDonald's across the street, but still not worth going across the city for. I do like how you can customize your burgers here. You can choose between a 4oz or a 6oz patty, select different toppings (add a fried egg!) as well as choose your bun: egg bun, wheat bun, or spicy chipotle bun. I highly recommend the egg bun--slightly sweet and very fluffy. The service is very friendly and quick. But as mentioned, it's not worth going across the city to eat here.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

Yummy burgers, clean interior, and best of all...the staff. I swear every single cashier I've encountered here is friendly and genuinely seems to care about your experience. I was there last weekend and thought it was 'business as usual' when I saw a friendly older man, 60+, at the register taking orders, a total straight shooter, friendly but not in a cheesy way, told customers \"you can have your burger any way you like\" and you could tell he meant it. Old school good customer service, I like! Well, turns out he's the General Manager (Tom) so of course I had to pay him a compliment, and it also prompted this review.\n\nBecause of the experiences I've had here, it's tempting to stop by anytime I do my grocery run at the Safeway there. Again, odd location (and wish their fries were fatter,) but definitely check it out when you need a fix. You won't regret it.", "author": "Jen E."}

The location for instance is a bit odd, its a strip mall where you find big box retailers like Ross, Office Depot and a Petco. Sort of unsuspecting to find a great jem hidden between these types of businesses. \n\nI had the pleasure of trying everything and I can tell you that everything is delicious. The burgers and sandwiches are all totally different from one another and this alone makes it possible for everyone to find something they are going to like. \n\nFor me personally the Classic burger was one of my favorites. It's got a classic flavor that should make any burger lover take note. The way the cheese melts with the meat is so so gooey. It's got simple and clean flavors of charbroiled goodness that pair with french fries really well, it's a classic!\n\nThey have a Truffle Mushroom Swiss, that's a lot of truffle mixed with the perfectly gooey cheese. It's not overwhelming but it has a lot of flavor.  \nThe Bacon BBQ is my second favorite, it's not over the top but has that simple and clean taste. I think for me the thing it might have been missing to make it my favorite was just a bit more sauce or something to moisten it up.\nThe other burgers and sandwiches are all amazing. They have a regional burger (the bay burger) with fresh local flavors. The chicken club has bacon and chicken, so so good. And they have a vegetarian option, not my favorite but it was great. \n\nHere is the reason they are so good, it's all fresh,mostly local and they smash the burgers on the grill, they call it MEAT CANDY, how can that not be amazing? The burgers are way better than any mainstream chain. I love smashing things.", "author": "Ben M."}

I'm glad I was finally in the neighborhood, having bookmarked this place for over a year, to finally try it out. \n\nEach location apparently has its own burger to reflect the city and thus my original bookmark was for the Bay Burger - arugula, portabella mushrooms, swiss, and truffle mayo between ciabatta. I totally forgot that was on the menu and got the truffle mushroom swiss burger instead. Overall nice flavors - the truffle flavor was really faint so you could taste the juicy burger and earthy mushrooms. I also ordered some Smashfries to go with my burger and if you like crispy shoestring fries, these are totally up your alley accept kicked up a notch with olive oil and herbs. All in, not too shabby for under $10.\n\nService is decent here but I must add that they actually do seem to enjoy being at work with lots of friendly banter between the staff and that totally rubs off on you.

Then I found this one. I usually start with the ambience then the service then the food but today I'll start with the good. \n\nFood; \nI got the Spinach, Cucumber and Goat Cheese big burger with a side of fries and let me say it was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. I've been to many places but this combination by far is one of the best, companied with the thin fries it's awesome. Like I said on my tip always try a different burger when you come both beef and chicken. You want regret it!\n\nAmbiance the good:\nWell located with plenty of parking. The restaurant is big with plenty of seating and even a waiting table for orders to go. The decor is modern and funky with darker tones that are inviting and soothing at the same time. \n\nAmbiance the bad:\nSo let me tell you I walked in and placed my order and when I went to look for a place to sit I found plenty of tables. The problem was that about 10 empty tables had not been picked up so I had to pick one and clean it my self. I grabbed a napkin and some water to clean the table and put the dirty dishes on the side. 3 other groups had to do the same. \n\nCustomer Service the good:\nThe young woman that took my order smiled and was engaging. I have nothing bad to say about her. They need more people like her in this place to bring it up more. And let me say the back of the house did an awesome job with my food. And they really work I could see them moving and getting things done asap.\n\nCustomer Service the bad:\nThe rest of the front staff was lazy and just acting dumb in a corner. Not smiling crossing their arms as they take customers orders. Not inviting at all. They need to replace a few employees in my opinion or give them additional training on customer service.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nSo the reason I don't give them a 5 was because of the bad service and having dirty tables over 10 dirty empty tables. But I will keep coming because of the food.", "author": "Victorino R."}

Get the crispy chicken version of whatever burger you want. I don't know if all smashburger locations make it the same, but that piping hot, crispy, juicy chicken is so worth it. Most of the time the chicken is twice the size of the bun. Way better than the beef burgers, not to mention a little bit healthier. \n\nI do have one \"constructive feedback\". Is that ok?\nYour fries are... not great at all. When it's fresh and hot, it's ok, but really you guys need to do something about this. I am an avid fries lover and.. I'm going to say it.. even fries from jack in the box, mcdonalds, burger king and that random mom and pop burger place down the road all have better fries. Make it a little thicker, a little more crispier, a little more salty and I know you could improve.\n\nBut hey, that burger.. wow that makes me forget it all.\n\nAlso love how you can customize your burger by adding and subtracting things.

For instance in San Diego it was a avocado topped burger with fresh cilantro, pepper jack cheese, sour cream and chipotle mayo with a wedge of lime on a telera roll. Now that was a great burger! \n\nHere at the SF location it's called the Bay burger and its topped with baby arugula, crimini mushrooms, swiss and a truffle mayo on a ciabatta bun. Also good but not sure if it screams Bay Area. Also on the menu that's not at most places are their Rosemary, garlic and Italian olive oil tossed fries aka smashfries.

Which I will henceforth assume is a result of them using their heavily touted \"burger smasher.\"  Which, according to their plentiful burger smasher marketing materials, is shaped like someone made the pentagon out of play dough and then squished it until the 5 corners became rounded.\n\nAnyway, the BBQ Bacon Cheddar smash is excellent as is the \"original smash\" which is basically a cheeseburger.  Their \"smash fries\" are also a winner; they're just regular french fries with enough olive oil and rosemary to make you feel like you're dining in San Francisco.

But, overall, everything they have to offer is pretty solid, from their various burgers, to their sides, to their shakes (which are made with Haagen Daz ice cream!). Fantastic, they are not, but solid, they are, falling somewhere in between the fast food world and the fancy burger world, in the same tier as, say, Super Duper.\n\nSome interesting tidbits: they're named what they are because they take fresh meat (ground beef, chicken, etc) and smash it into a super hot griddle, which simultaneously sears, steams, and quickly cooks the meat. Also, while they have set items on their menus, their burgers are actually customizable, for those who like playing with their food. And with the variety of buns, proteins, and ingredients to pick from, there's plenty of combinations to come up with!\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Spacious venue, with a combination of inaccessible counter height tables, and lower standard height tables and booths.\n\nBathroom - Didn't check them out, but I imagine they're okay.", "author": "Johnny W."}

The menu was simple, yet full of choices... there was honest tea at the fountain and a few select beers... the layout was attractive as well. \n\nI ordered a chicken club with a side of bbq sauce on a wheat bun, side of sweet potato fries. To be honest, I am still trying to figure out what I thought. The chicken was paper thin, there were 3 small slices of avocado, and single strip of lettuce. Wasn't the most elegant or juicy chicken sandwich I ever had. It didn't really fill me, but the flavor sure was delicious. I was a bit disappointed with the portions. \n\nOverall... for the cost, I think there are better places to go. I know that \"artisan\" and unique burger joints are on the up and up, but the most important thing to me is a good portion for the cost. For the $11 I spent, I excepted more than what I got.

Although the burgers are a bit salty, it's everything you want in a burger place.\n\nThere seems to be a new trend with burger places that allows you to build your own burger and enjoy fresh ingredients. Although it comes at a higher price tag, it almost guarantees you to have the exact burger you want without any skimping on the trimmings taste. A real bonus is everything made here is cooked to order. Unlike many fast food chains which have them cooked and then place them under a heat lamp to keep em warm. By doing that you take away the texture and natural flavor of the meat patty and replace it with a rubbery feel and leaves it with a Spongy taste to it.\n\nI ordered the BBQ bacon cheeseburger. It's served on a golden brown egg bun with huge cuts of hickory smoked bacon. Combine that with a half pound party and Swiss cheese. I took it a step further by adding an egg on top to complete this massive meal of perfection. Although it was a bit saltier than expected, the burger was excellent. It was juicy, it was runny, it was messy but more importantly it was tasty.\n\nThe fries were average and I was a little disappointed because there was so much emphasis made about these fries and how much better they're supposed to taste. I've heard it placed higher then other chains like in & out and McDonald's. But I will say this the venue is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside and the staff was cordial. The only downside was the loud conversations they were having that everyone in the smash burger could hear. Of you know you're at work and have a. Open kitchen, be aware of what you're talking about because it can sound extremely unprofessional. \n\nBut other than that, I feel as an all around burger place.

My bf got the Bay Burger (Baby arugula, saut\u00e9ed baby portabella mushrooms, aged Swiss, and truffle mayo on a ciabatta bun). Avacado Club was good, but I was disappointed in the lettuce; it was just one thin piece. I did like the multi-grain bun since it was different and made me feel good for eating \"healthy.\"  The Bay Burger was super good though - can't go wrong with that truffle mayo. \n\nFries were alright; really thin shoestring variety. I was hoping for thicker fries. The fries were also pretty greasy...but still good. At first we ordered one to share, but then I ended up wanting to get one for myself since I didn't feel full yet.  Best part, I went up to order the fries. The manager asked, \"Do you want free fries? Fill out the survey on your receipt and you can get them free!\" Awesome. Made my day.\n\nGreat service...good food. Will be returning.", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

I must add \"Linda\" one of the servers was so so so sweet and friendly! She was very attentive and such a sweet lady. \"Tom\" the general manager was also very delightful and you could see he was managing and maintaining the whole joint without any issues or Complications. Tom was very attentive to every person walking through the door even with splurges of people coming and going. The food was delicious and FRESH. YOU COUKD TASTE THE FRESHNESS in every bite. I really liked the variety they offered on their menu, not too much but different from other burger joints. They also thanked me for coming in and gave me a free cup with some free coupon flyers to come back again! This place is definitely on one of my new favorite places to go!

One of the shakes wasn't the right flavor, and one of the burgers had incorrect toppings.\n\nOne a previous visit, with 2 burgers, one was lost somehow after being made.  They score half a point because they offered to remake both.\n\nAnd on another previous visit, items were not made to the order.\n\nThe food is pretty good, but considering the time this location has been open, you would think the kitchen would be onto the game.", "author": "Michael G."}

Both were disastrous.\n\nThe fries are shoestring, but are cooked as if normal cut, hence they're overcooked and crispy. If you like them this way great, I don't.\n\nThe shake was watery, not much creaminess, and the nutter butters added precious little flavor. The ground cookie bits were also very soggy, far too soggy for the cookie to have been added fresh, so I wondered whether they're using nutter butter ice cream. I doubt it, so the soggy cookie is not easily explainable, unless nutter butter get much soggier than Oreos very quickly.\n\nIf the goes-withs are this bad, I can only imagine the food, so I won't bother trying it. They go on and on about Certified Angus Beef, but at the end of the day this is just a brand that doesn't tell you anything other than the ranchers are part of a large coalition that uses a common logo to promote their product, much like how BBB or Diamond Certified works.\n\nAnd the music is WAY too loud.\nIt's a cheap joint for a snack, not a discotheque.", "author": "Rob C."}

The fries at the latter don't even compete;  In N Out's fries are a disgrace.  It's the burger.  The meat at Smash Burger is simply the best flavored of any I can think of---better than any of the burgers I've had at some rather posh places (and at posh prices) where I'd prefer not to see burgers, and even some out of state efforts, at chains practicing on a similar level of quality, like Cascade.\n\nEven more annoying than the ridiculous spread of the burger among restaurants (not to mention mac-n-cheese; flank steak; and fish tacos) is the fact that almost all of them, even with purportedly fine quality beef of the most contented bovines, have so little flavor;  the beef itself isn't particularly exciting, and the seasonings seem timid.\n\nHaving found the beef so delicious, it's only reassuring to find the fries are just as good.   I can't say they're the best, but they are very very good, and consistently so.  There have been a couple of places where I went bonkers over the fries on the first visit, only to have the second visit provide what appeared to be twice cooked scraps.\n\nAnd they serve beer and wine.   \n\nIf I happen to go to In N Out more often (which isn't very often at all----say once or twice a year tops, vs once---maybe twice a year to Smash Burger;) it's because I'm more likely to head towards the water, towards Irish Coffees, than I am to head to a part of town that is, let's be honest, butt ugly, and with nothing else to recommend it, once you've taken the trouble to get there.\n\nSo, when I'm in the Legendary Burger Joint, I'm not only denouncing the fries, I'm eating the burger and thinking \"Nice, but not a Smash Burger\".  When I'm out of town, I'll be looking for Smash Burgers.  I'm a loyal person, but when someone else does a better job, you have to reward them, not just hang on to what was...", "author": "Paul T."}

They ask how the food was, they ask if they can refill your drink or if they can get you anything else and they offer to remove the basket as soon as you are done eating so it's not in your way. I've never experienced such high customer service at a burger joint before. The only con I have is when you order the big size for my burger it means the patty is bigger while the bun remains the same size. As a result it was very messy to eat because the patty kept falling out of the bun, but they have forks and knives and plenty of napkins.

OMFG, this place is off the chain Super high quality ingredients, decent prices, even the serving dishes which hold whatever free condiment you want that the staff bring to your table are silver. Living here, you almost get used to even casual restaurants being overpriced and precious. Yet, Smashburger is the exception.\n Great burgers on cibatta buns, truffle mayo (oh yes) arugulla, fresh haystack onions, applewood smoked bacon, matchstick fries with rosemary and garlic, shakes made with Haagendass ice cream. Most toppings are complimentary! Even a meatless burger freshly made with black beans for when my veggie best friend comes to town. No gimmicks- most burgers are $6-7 for a very rich satisfying experience.", "author": "Antoinette S."}

Never heard of truffle mayo before until this place and it went so well with my burger. The sweet potato fries were good as well. Nothing out of the ordinary but nothing bad either. Granted I did order for take out so everything probably would have tasted better if I had eaten there but nonetheless, the food was still good :) \n\nOverall, I think this place is great.

Great vegetarian options. But, over the last 6 months they genuinely seem like they are trying to fuck up. The man and I often order the Spinach, Cucumber and Goat Cheese salad. I cannot honestly remember the last time that it was correctly made - either they forget the goat cheese, or the pumpkin/sesame seeds, or it's drowning in dressing. The french fries or the \"Veggie Frites\" (deep fried sticks of carrots and green beans) are COVERED in grease, to the point of needing to wipe them off before eating. Their fries are good, but somewhere the process is falling apart - lots of other fast food restaurants seem to understand how to make french fries.

There are three options for fries, all done properly as well. \n\nThe one fairly small thing I'm not fond of is the lack of a good iced tea.

Ive been here a few times since they opened with some co workers, but never with her, and wanted to go someplace casual and not so expensive.     \n\nThere is a bit of an illusion that this place is very health concision, being it's right next to a vitamin store.    Even though the food is good, and the place is very clean, i didn't think its all that much healthier then any other bacon cheese burger could be.   But the service is fast, the staff is polite and even though the price point is a few bucks more then you'd normally pay for a good burger, you do save on the tip, and they still bring your order to your table.   One big plus was the nice server girl when she brought the food to the table asked if there was anything else we wanted, and she was happy to get us a side of ranch.   Not something you'd expect at a fast food place of this nature.   Pig ups to the staff there.   \n\nThe regular fries are nice, cause they are extra skinny, so that makes then very crunchy.   She had the Baja chicken and bacon with fresh avocado ... it was very tasty.    Of course I ate all her bacon.   I had a very juicy bacon cheeseburger with onion crisps on it.   It was delicious.   the buns are yellow and very yummy!     Despite the bit of excess grease, the bread stayed together very well.   That's always a good thing.    \n\nParking is convenient, but in the worst corner of that mall... so watch out backing out... all those nutty people that go to Ross don't drive so well.     I'll likely go back, cause the place is extra clean, and the staff is very nice, and the food is good.   $24 for 2 people for lunch with 2 burgers, drinks and sides at a decently healthy place for fast food is a very fair deal considering the convenience of the parking.

But, sadly, it IS true.\nI haven't eaten a hamburger cooked past medium since I was 12, and certainly have no intention of doing so now because this fast food chain doesn't care to train it's cooks well enough (or pay them enough) to do so.\nI left.\nThere are plenty of SF places to get a great burger.  Smash Burger is not one of them.\nThe Super Duper burger local minichain serves an excellent organic burger here in SF (also smashed and crusty on a homemade bun), and will gladly have their better trained and paid cooks prepare it to the temperature you request. At a lower price. So save your hard earned money while satisfying your gourmet burger jones there. \nSmashburger is just McDonald's disguised low pay no service product model with more PR attitude designed to fool the consumer.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-06", "description": "My son and I were on our way to Togo's to have lunch between jobs when I saw this eatery. Let me start by saying that I NEVER order a burger when we go out, I typically do not like burgers. \n\nI asked a couple of people in line if they had been there before and it seemed like everyone in front of us was there for the first time. \n\nI ordered a large buter (I was hungry and for $1 more, seemed logical) with grilled onions, chipotle bun, and chipotle sauce. My son ordered a jalepeno burger and we shared an order of smashed fries.  My burger was perfect in every way, I was pleasantly pleased. I didn't care for the fries however. I love garlic fries but this had hints of this and hints of that, not quite enough of anything to make it outstanding. My son pulled all the sliced raw jalepenos out.\n\nThe first time we were asked if everything was ok, I was impressed. The second time we were approached by a different worker, I said \"wow, what service\". ok, enough already, we were there about 1/2 an hour and by the 10th time, I was beyond annoyed. There's good customer service and then there's irritation. This was the part that took a star away.\n\nI got home & did the online survey and conveyed this very annoying point. I went back a second time with my husband and other son and the burger was still good. Consistency is a good thing. This time we didn't once get asked by anyone if everything was ok. Being that it is not a table service place, I actually don't mind. There were enough employees roaming around that I could've waved someone down if I needed something. \n\nI think it was the same employee that took my order at the cash register. He was not too bright but his friendliness made up for it and they got our orders right both times.", "author": "May G."}

Not as expensive as the other HOT burger joints and just as impressive. I even heard the secret sauce they use has tears of angel or something like that. I am not sure since it is a \"secret\". Anyways, get the burger with bacon and cheese (or if you are a snob, its called a bacon cheese burger) because you will die. Yes because its good but because its also packed with high saturated fat and salt. Remember that no one lives forever so live with style (and ditch your girly Prius).

If you haven't figured it out already, the meat patty is \"smashed\" and flattened. I wonder why they do that...it's good nonetheless. I have gotten the cheeseburger and the club burger (I wouldn't recommend that one).  We have tried both the regular and smash fries, I prefer the regular fries because the smash fries are a little too oily for my preference. The best part of the meal is the Hagan Daaz milkshake!!!!! I love Hagan Daaz ice cream and having it in milkshake form is heaven. Can't go wrong with any of the flavors.  I'd come here solely for the milkshakes.", "author": "Kristina N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-10", "description": "The Bad:\nSome people only eat burgers medium or rare, so just know that at SmashBurger they ONLY cook them well done. \n\nSome people want table service and for the same price as Mcdonalds...this is not a place for table service. \n\nIf you order as I did without reading the menu, you may get a burger without garnish, now I'm sure that is somewhere on the menu, but when a person walks in for the first time and there is no wait and tell them it's your first time, that should be explained. That's because the menu behind the counter is for 2020 vision and not everyone has 2020 or wears glasses or contacts. But from reading another review I see it was mentioned that there are laminated menus just left of the door when you walk in, but who looks there? As you walk in you're looking at the counter and that's where you would go.\n\nThe large burger kind of hangs over the small bun (not a bad for me cuz I don't need a lot of bread).   \n\nSo that is the bad as I see it all wrapped up.\n\n\nThe Good:\nThe burgers ARE juicy, just not medium or rare. They will make the burger to your specifications, but only well done. \n\nThe burger that I had came with truffles, mushrooms and swiss and was highly seasoned which I like (that may be a bad to some people who hate salt). There is a choice of regular or large size, I had the large. \n\nThe SmashFries are seasoned in Rosemary and dipped in an oil, which I forgot which oil, but they are delicious. (If you don't like oil, then you should know not to get these).\n\nThe Excellent:\nThe service was better than I have experienced in most restaurants at any price. The staff was nice and seemed very friendly. I was asked 3 times how everything was and did I need anything else which may have been a little overkill, but understandable for a new place. I'm sure this will not be the case after the top staff completes the training of the locals and move on. By that I means that there probably won't be an over abundance of staff around, if they are going to make a profit.\n\nOverall:\nIf you're looking for the \"dream burger joint\" this ain't it. But it beats Mickey DD's, BK and Jack in the Crack anyday.  It's clean, friendly and tasty.", "author": "Jim L."}

I answered, \"either one works.\" He responded \"you can't go in the women's if you're a man\" pretty loudly. My first reaction was to laugh and brush it off my shoulder. But when I came back and he handed me my food there was no apology, nothin. I asked why just the womens room was locked, and he explained that he was trying to prevent harrassment of women. I told him I didn't care what he said but someone else probably would have, the way he put attention on me the way he did. Then he got awkward, started cleaning the tables next to me and mumbling to himself how he doesn't judge anybody, and that he was \"blessed\" to mind his business.
