According to his roomie, it's authentic Indian food at a great price. While I don't know what authentic Indian food tastes like, I can say all the items we ordered at Saffron were very delicious and yummy. \n\nMy boyfriend and I got delivery through Yelp, so I can't really comment on service or atmosphere. I will say their Tikka Masala is one of the most flavorful ones I've had yet. There were huge chunks of chicken in our Tikka Masala. We also got the Lamb Korm which tasted a bit plain in comparison to the Tikka Masala, but still tasty nonetheless. You will definitely taste the lamb in this curry. \n\nGlad my boyfriend lives so close to Saffron. I can definitely see us ordering from here again and again :)", "author": "Angela W."}

And you have to trust me, since I'm from New Delhi. We reached the place at 7:30 for dinner, placed the order in by 7:45 -- all nice and smooth till this point.\n\nAt around 8:15 I started to get suspicious: the restaurant was super crowded and almost everyone who came in after us had either already picked up their order, or had their food out. I spent the next 15 mins trying to get attention of the two servers, almost comically at times, till one of them finally obliged. I asked her if there was any hope the food will come out soon, and well, she asked me to repeat the entire order. My suspicion is that that's when the kitchen finally started preparing the food, and it took another 20 mins for it to come out.\n\nIn a nutshell, they got so busy getting the food out to uber eats and doordashes that they just threw our order slip away, and made us 3 hungry innocents wait over an hour. I've never left a zero tip in my life, but I guess there's a first time for everything.\n\nPS: in case you were wondering about food itself, don't bother. It was cold, the naans were cold and hard, and it just seemed like the tray got put in a forgotten corner in the kitchen for 45 mins before someone found it.", "author": "Anant J."}

The food was generally wonderful, although the nan that we ordered occasionally came a bit burned. After enjoying take-out for so long, I decided to check out the real restaurant. We ordered the chicken tikka masala, white rice, and the garlic nan and were pleasantly surprised when we were given a chip-like appetizer (maybe poppadum?) with sauces. Everything was absolutely delicious, even more delicious than we expected, and the chicken tikka masala was to die for. The only thing I might complain about was that the soda was bottled and not on tap. \n\nThe service was great and the restaurant seemed very personal: there was only room for maybe 30 people to sit. \n\nLastly, the prices were super reasonable.

I've never actually finished my food), and always-hot-and-fresh-and-delicious-and-perfect garlic naan.

Since I had a disappointing lunch, I decided to get my comfort food for dinner. Indian! I ordered delivery through UberEats on Friday, April 14th at 7:33pm. It arrived at 8:13pm. I live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Vegetable Samosa: two pieces, puff pastries filled with potatoes, sweet peas, herbs, and spices ($6.75)\n*Garlic Nan: fresh chopped garlic layered nan ($3.50)\n*Chicken Tikka Masala: boneless chicken in a moderately spiced, garlic, and tomato base sauce ($13.50)\n\nThe samosas were good. Soft on the inside and crispy outside. I enjoyed them with the mint chutney. The chicken tikka masala had a nice consistency. (I had a super thin curry earlier.) But I wanted more heat and flavor. I had noted extra spicy with my order and it didn't have much heat. The curry was creamy, but where were the levels of flavor? I found it very mild and one note. The garlic naan had a good amount of garlic, but it was too thick and doughy. I prefer my naan with more of a chew. This was very soft.\n\nOkay place to get Indian for delivery, but I found them too pricey. Almost $7 for samosas and $14 for curry?! No thank you! Glad I checked another place off my list, but I probably won't be ordering from them again.", "author": "Elena N."}

Got the butter chicken, malai kofta, naan, and raita. \n\nI loved the butter chicken, raita, and naan combo and would absolutely order it again. Be warned though- the butter chicken is more tomato-y and chunky than creamy and is on the sweeter side. Personally I really liked this and it was one of my favorite indian dishes I have had in San Francisco. Would absolutely order again. It has a good amount of chicken and while it didn't look huge, ended up being almost 3 meals. Definitely get the raita with this- the yogurt compliments the tomato nicely and it's a delicious combination. \n\nThe malai kofta was less enjoyable- I found it a bit too spicy and I have had much better versions of that dish for sure. I would avoid this in the future myself but people who like spicier food might like it. \n\nDelivery was on time and food was packed nicely and labeled.

Sad to say, saffron grill was quite disappointing. The prices are fairly steep and the quantity is below average. For comparison, if you order a rice with a standard curry, you will not have enough curry to finish the bowl of rice. In terms of the food itself, I got the malai kofta and it was subpar/OK at best, the koftas felt frozen and as if they were just tossed into the mix.

Take it from me because I sustain on restaurant bought Indian food that their food tastes authentic! We had asked the lamb achar to be spicy but my cousin found it too spicy for her so they offered raita without additional cost! The saag lamb was thick but not too creamy sweet and despite the heat I could taste the spices and flavors of the achar lamb very well. The owner's wife told us that they cook in small batches and we could tell that the food tasted fresh and was not just seeped in oil to cover the staleness as many restaurants tend to make it. I am always surprised at how restaurants get naan wrong despite using a proper tandoor but their naan was on point! We finished off with gulab jamun on the house for my birthday which was a very sweet gesture!   \n\nService: We came in around closing time but they happily took us in on a Sunday night and even started trying to help us with our tricky parking situation. The staff worked well with each other (seemed like they're treated well by the owner and this is important) and we chatted quite a bit with them too about different Indian and Nepali pop-ups and festivals.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-02-16", "description": "I first tried Saffron Grill during one of the Giants' World Series games. My friend and I couldn't get into any sports bars, and we were hungry, so Indian food it was.\n\nI think the best way to describe the restaurant is \"charming\". It's a small, family-run place where (I think) the dad cooks, the mom manages, and the daughter is the hostess. This might have changed but that's the impression I got. And I'm going to continue to mention them as such because I like the idea of a family owned and operated business.\n\nMy friend ordered some food (it doesn't really matter what), and I ordered vindaloo, asking for it \"as spicy as you can make it\". The waitress/daughter asked if I was sure, and I told her emphatically that yes, I want it to be as spicy as possible.\n\nThe food came, and it was good. Maybe 3/5 to 4/5. Nothing crazy, but very solid and if I recall correctly we were a bit tipsy. The main point though, was that it wasn't that spicy. The manager/mom and waitress/daughter seemed a little amused and promised if I came back, they would make it spicy.\n\nFast forward a year, and I live nearby! Amazing. I came back with two friends and asked \"hey, do you remember me?\" They did! And they said they would make something spicy for me.\n\nI'll quickly wrap this up - they made it MORE spicy, but not what I consider spicy. I told them this, and this time they seemed a little perplexed. Whatever, I know that I don't look like someone who can handle high heat, but I think they got the idea that medium spicy was mild for me.\n\nNow fast forward a month. I come in, and as soon as they see me, they say the chef/dad is going to make something special for me. Yay! My friends order normal food.\n\nThis time, I got a little scared. I could hear the chef/dad coughing, a lot, as he was cooking. My friends were also joking about this being my last meal.\n\nThe food comes out, and for the first time the chef/dad comes out too, and he's looking at me. The manager/mom and waitress/daughter sit down a few tables away, and they are looking at me too. In addition, the waitress/daughter brings out a small plate of dark red powder, and says \"this is from the chef in case you want it more spicy\". Was this haba\u00f1ero powder? Ghost pepper powder? Something else? I don't know, but it had a brownish-red color that looked pretty evil.\n\nI take my first bite, and realize that these people now meant business. My head started sweating, my nose started running, my eyes started watering, and I could feel the heat even before the spiciness hit. Which it did, pretty hard.\n\nNow, I can handle spicy food. Better than most, and I only say \"most\" because while I logically know that there must be some people who enjoy spicier food than me, I haven't ever met them. On my scale, I would say this food was 4/5 spicy. I've had hotter food, but this was definitely in the \"pain is pleasure\" category, and I couldn't taste anything besides heat.\n\nSo the whole family is watching me take a few bites, my faithless friends are waiting for me to cry uncle (as opposed to just crying, which it probably appeared like I already was). What do I do? Start spooning in the hot pepper powder of course!\n\nSo basically, once food gets this hot where it hurts and you're basically having an endorphin rush, a little extra heat isn't going to do much. And I was not going to let this family think they had beat me, nor give my friends the satisfaction of seeing me leave the plate unfinished and curl into a ball with a gallon of mango lassi.\n\nI ate every drop of the curry, and I used the entire plate of powder they gave me. The family looked incredulous. My friends shook their heads, in what I will call amazement.\n\nSitting there afterwards, feeling proud of myself for tolerating what would kill most people (that's how I choose to think about it), I couldn't help but feel an intense satisfaction. Because I am masochistically addicted to spicy food, I guess.\n\nTo conclude though, I have eaten non-spicy food here, and it's good for Indian food. The place is clean, the service is good, and the people are nice. And it's family run! Or again, at least that's how I choose to think of it. And any place that will risk killing someone just to satisfy a patron's bizarre love of painfully spicy food deserves an extra star in my book. I don't live nearby anymore so unfortunately I can't visit, but anyone in the area definitely should check them out.", "author": "Sm L."}

It's a solid Indian food joint with very authentic food.

I got the medium hot tikka and it was plenty spicy for me and I can handle spice. My boyfriend on the other hand got the regular tikka and was dying of heat - to each their own :)\n\nI took a bite of the chicken (no tikka) masala and it had great flavor too. Not as hot as the tikka. \n\nI did get an awful stomach ache after this meal. I don't blame the meal preparation, I believe it was a combo of overeating and spiciness.

We also ordered naan (flat bread).\n\nAt pickup, the food was piping hot. Every dish was absolutely delicious, a perfect mixture of flavor and spiciness (all dishes ordered mild). Oftentimes, bean dishes at many restaurants are either under- or over-cooked. Saffron Grill's chana and dal were cooked to perfection!\n\nTotaling $60, the four entree dishes and three (large and delicious!) pieces of naan (plus rice I cooked at home) fed 4 hungry adults and 2 kids with leftovers.

Thier  Baingan Bharta (daily special) was very bland, and quite slimy and absolutley no smoked/roasted flavor on the eggplant. This is one of my usual favorite dishes but not here.. like others have mentioned they seemed more focused on their brisk takeout business than thier dine in guests.  We orderd a large beer with the meal to share which was poured incredibly sloppily, and the server almost walked off without even giving us the last quarter of the bottle. After beer was served we didn't get any further service untill we had to shout into the kitchen to ask for the check.  Overall very mediocre food combined with poor service means we wont be back.

The waitress & waiter took my order and told the chef/cook in the back about my request and...it's not clear too me if the chef/cook refused or they didn't have the spices to make it spicy because there was some yelling in the back.

I've definitely seen places charge like $15 for curries.\n\nThe mango lassi was a good flavor (although a bit warm).\n\nThe lady recognized regulars and was really friendly.\n\nGRIPES:\nWell this place is extremely tiny so I would recommend not bringing more than 4 guests total.\n\nThe navaratan korma didn't have enough sauce. Also it was obvious that they used the frozen vegetable medley of green beans, corn, and carrots. Also the korma I like tends to be orange while this was a bright yellow. I think I wouldn't have minded as much except there really wasn't any sauce.\n\nThe lamb vindaloo was spicy to the point that my tongue was numb. Others at the table felt the same. I like spicy but then this was maybe a bit too much and caused the rest of my food to not taste like anything.\n\nAlso, they charge extra for rice.

For a Sunday evening, my wait of 12-15 minutes wasn't bad.\n\nThe flavors of their dishes were intense and rich, definitely the spiciest of other Indian restaurants that I've frequented in the neighborhood (I ordered the channa masala, \"medium\"). The portions were small, typical of the other Indian restaurants around Lower Haight, and the taste was certainly memorable. The service was fine, but our waitress kept apologizing for her \"OCD tendencies\" and moved around our plates, table, and dishes a lot--causing me a bit of diner's distress.\n\nThis place was a-okay, but I'll probably stick to scoping out other spots in these parts.", "author": "Angel V."}

I've been here a handful of times (at least 10) and everything on the menu is delicious. My favorite is the salmon tandoori. It's a big portion and great to share with the table. The chicken korma is also very delicious (not too sweet) and the roti is a must. The staff is always friendly and attentive providing excellent customer service.

Service was ok, I ordered to go, the waitress seemed very pushy on items I wanted to order. While I was trying to make up my mind between two dishes she was trying to tell me to order a different item. I don't like places that try to tell you what to eat. Other than that spices were delicious and the food was not heavy on grease. \n\nTiki Masala was very good. Chicken was tender and had authentic taste. Only disapointment was it just was not as spicy, I ordered medium spice .  \n\nChicken Tiki kabob was very good and worth the price. Again chicken had great flavor and was juicy and tender.\n\nVegi Samosas were great as well crisp outside, but flavorful and soft potatoes on the inside. Worth buying.\n\nLast, is Vegi Biryani, I was not impressed at all. I had better. This lacked flavor and the rice was a little undercooked. I think this is what made my meal 4 stars other than that I would have gave this place 5 stars for its flavor & presentation.\n\nFyi: this place is small ; tight seeting, probably can only fit 12 people max. Also if you are ordering to go make sure to ask for the sauses that are supposed to come with your order. If I did not ask if my sauces were inside, I would not have the sauces for my samosas or the yogurt that came with my meal.", "author": "Andrea R."}

My wife and I were very excited to go here because we love Indian food and this restaurant is very close to our home.  While the restaurant location is nice and convenient, that is about all it had going for it.\nWe ended up ordering a Pakora Appetizer along with Chicken Korma and Navratan Korma entrees.  The Pakora ended up being very salty and overcooked.  Both entrees were pretty bland and unappetizing.  None of this food had the spicy kick or flavorful qualities of typical Indian food.  It was very disappointing.\nOn top of all of this, I ordered a cup of chai to go along with my meal.  It ended up coming out lukewarm.  When I asked the waitress for a hot cop of chai, they simply microwaved it and handed it back tome.  Chai is not very good microwaved.\nOverall this restaurant was a huge disappointment and I don't think we will be returning.", "author": "JD R."}

The dining area is like a converted living space.  Small and intimate.  And I was greeted with such a warm welcome!  We were seated promptly as there were many tables available.\n\nMy roommate and I ordered veggie samosas, chicken tikka masala, chicken vindaloo, basmati rice, and garlic naan.  The veggie samosas were really good, especially with the tamarind sauce.  The chicken tikka masala was for me, and I thought that it was small at first.  I was wrong about the third piece of chicken in.  So wrong.. And mind you, I was starving before I entered the restaurant.  I ended up devouring the entire thing, but I really could've stopped at that third piece.  The masala was creamy and savory with a hint of sweetness.   I also really liked the garlic naan.  It was soft with a hint of garlic.\n\nThe wait staff were really friendly and attentive.  We were going to get two orders of basmati rice, and the waiter said one would be enough.

Definitely the best Saag Paneer I've ever had...most places it looks like cheese globs floating in creamed spinach. Here, it was lighter, with more texture and distinct flavors. Very good. The Korma was of the same ilk - a light cream sauce with tender, but crisp vegetables.\n\nI'm giving them five stars because of the way they treated my family. We have a 13 month-old daughter and dining out can be a challenge sometimes. We often feel self-conscious and rush through meals to avoid an...incident.\n\nFrom the moment we came in to Saffron Grill, the hostess was not just personable, but genuinely friendly. She immediately started playing with our daughter and brought her an electric candle to play with. The chef sent out a dish of peas for her to munch on while we waited for dinner. The meal was a dream - our daughter was content, loved the food, and we enjoyed a leisurely meal. A rare treat with a small child.\n\nI actually teared up a little bit writing this review.

Food arrived promptly, in 20 minutes instead of the indicated 45.  But the food was TERRIBLE.  This is the first time Yelp has been so far off the mark.  Part of me wants to think San Franciscans just don't know good Indian.  But there are plenty of poorly reviewed Indian places too, so this place must be doing *something* to warrant the four star reviews??\n\nMy family is from North India, I've spent 8 years in Delhi and 16 in the UK, so I know good Indian food. This was not it.  In fact this was probably one of the worst Indian takeouts I've ever had in any country.  I even stuck with the popular dishes: chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, basmati rice and garlic naan.  I have a bottomless appetite when it comes to Indian food but tonight I had to stop eating, un-full simply because I was so put off.  \n\nExtremely bland, flavourless and the curries were just wrong.  The saag paneer didnt appear to be made from spinach -- it wasnt creamy the way spinach gets when you cook it down, rather it looked / tasted like parsley.  The CTM was terrible.  The colour was all wrong (a pale orange instead of red), no spice and no tanginess to it.  I couldnt taste any garam masala or really much of anything.  The naan was dry, thick and paper like, which sure after a 10 minute bike ride, I dont expect it to be pristine but naan holds up longer than that.  Also garlic? I could go on a kissing spree right now and no one would detect a thing.  Worst of all, the food had no aroma.  Anyone who knows good Indian knows it fills the air with a rich strong fragrance that spurs on the appetite needed! \n\nDunno if the delivery is drastically different from the eat in experience but I strongly suggest you avoid.", "author": "Tash P."}

How hooked are we? We have been there 4 times in 2014 alone and January isn't even over yet.\n\nSaffron Grill is the kind of restaurant that I knew almost immediately would be good. You walk in, and it's busy and cozy....but not the kind of busy that feels frantic or claustrophobic...the kind of busy that feels like other people know what's up and are choosing to wait there because it's good. The staff is super attentive - which is important when the place is busy. They lock eyes immediately as you walk in, and communicate how long the wait is and what you should do. This detail makes all the difference in the world, and on our first visit (a Friday at the prime dinner hour of 7 PM), this was a good, early indicator that it would be a pleasant experience. \n\nThe wait has never been more than 10 minutes - and the food is well worth it! Some of the freshest, most delicious, flavorful Indian I have ever had. It truly tastes like home cooking...if your home was in North India, I suppose :) We have had multiple lamb and chicken dishes, and been pleased with them all. My boyfriend also loves their Mango Lassies. \n\nWe will continue to go back, and sooner than later because even typing this review made me long for some Vindaloo and Naan!", "author": "Serena Q."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-12", "description": "Remember this day: January 12, 2014. Today was the day that I had the best Indian food from a restaurant in. my. life! Wow! Where do I begin? My friend wanted to go out for dinner and when she mentioned Indian food, I was a little disappointed because being Indian, I am privileged to have the best cooks right at home. And now that I am far from home, it's nice to try Indian food, but then I just feel disappointed, and with heart burn. But this place was different. \n\nI enter and it's a nice small, quaint restaurant with great art work and ambiance. We sit down and I get a little nervous because I don't see anyone Indian, but then I have to remind myself that all the Indians in the Bay Area are mostly in the Silicon Valley. We get seated and they serve me my favorite beer, Taj Mahal. Our server (I think she is part of the family business) asks how spicy we want our food and my friend said \"medium\" and I didn't feel like ordering a separate \"spicy\" dish so I just went with medium. She asked again, \"Are you sure?\" Girrrrrrrrl please, I'm Indian. \n\nWoah. WOAH. Holy woah! We ordered the sag paneer, chicken tikka masala, and garlic naan. They also served us spicy papad with the green chutney. It was the best Indian meal I have ever enjoyed at a restaurant. I think I will be having dreams about this restaurant. I wanted to hug the owner (and touch the owner's feet - for all my Indian homiez). I even wanted to cry tears of joy and tears of spiciness! I can't wait for my mom to try this place! Hell, I can't wait for every Indian I know (all three of them) to try this place! It took a long time to get the food, but it was worth the wait. \n\nThe food is spicy and they could care less if you are Indian or if you are a cute little southern girl, they will bring it! They serve room temperature water which I love, but this time, I was craving ice. The food wasn't overly oily and overly \"masala-y\". I don't know why some Indian restaurants pour oil into their food and think that's okay. OR, they put every Indian spice that exists all into one dish and it's like a cardamom explosion in my mouth. \n\nWe didn't have any of the desserts but I think all of their heart and soul goes into their regular food. It would be nice for them to have homemade desserts too but that is very laborious. I was a little disappointed because they didn't have Bhindi (okra) but it's because their ingredients are all fresh and sometimes it's difficult to get fresh okra. She also told me that if I ever have their bhindi that I won't ever enjoy it anywhere else. She's right. Except that now applies for every Indian dish I order from now on. This place ranks up there next to my momma's cooking and my grandmomma's cooking! (They are a North Indian restaurant so no idli or dosa). \n\nSO DELICIOUS! MmMmMmm! And they have supari (it's like a post dinner minty kind of thing) :) \n\nPS... My mouth is still on fire.", "author": "Leena B."}

The lamb and chicken achar are my favorites. \n\nThen to add to that is RITA!

There was a man and a woman working, and there seemed to be confusion between them.  We were given someone else's check soon after we sat down, which was just odd because the table next to us had clearly just finished, and we hadn't yet ordered.  Honest mistake, but the place wasn't crowded, so I didn't think it was a hard thing to mix up?  I think it was just weird because they didn't apologize... just took the check away and bickered with each other quietly.  The waitress was really quiet, but made good recommendations on food.\n\nThe vegetarian dishes were good!

Opened the door of what looked like a house to enter a cute little restaurant smelling of yummy curry and spices. I will say it was like a sauna in there! The place is really small without many windows so I can see how it gets so hot. It wasn't uncomfortably hot but between the heat and the spicy food I left the restaurant gleaming a little. The service was fantastic! Our server was sooo cute and friendly! I didn't catch her name but she definitely made the experience with her sense of humor and recommendations.\n We came right  from a sushi restaurant where we didn't get full so we didn't order much at Saffron. For my two friends and I we shared the garlic naan and chicken tikki masala. I was sold when our waiter asked HOW SPICY I wanted my masala. Yaassss. I love that question at a restaurant. We got the medium spicy which was perfect! Just enough to give it that kick! The masala was quite tasty and not as creamy as other masalas I've had. I really enjoyed it. I would recommend getting three dishes for three people but because we weren't very  hungry this did the trick. The garlic naan was perfect! It's sectioned off into 4 pieces making it really easy to share amongst the table.\n\nI would definitely come back here, especially on a day when I'm super hungry so I can feast on multiple dishes. Also if you're dying for dessert afterward there's a Bi-rite market/creamery right down the street! Enjoy!", "author": "Jessica B."}

Flavorless and missing most of the tasty ingredients that make both dishes great.

In authentic Indian food terms, spicy means an the right blend of lots of different spices. Spices other than just red chilly powder. This is the second Indian restaurant I've tried in San Francisco. I was looking for something close to me, and after reading reviews I asked them for medium spicy food. The food was definitely hot. If you wanna be cute and say you've had \"spicy\" Indian food, this place is great - medium spicy will make you sweat. But this is not authentic Indian food.

Freshly made curries in a family-run cozy environment.\n\nWhen this place burned down a few years ago I was sad. They had a sign saying they would open soon, but I was worried. Every once in a while I would call their main number and hope that they would pick up. One day they answered and I headed straight down!\n\nI almost always get the lamb achar, which is tangy and a spice level that can be modified to taste. In general they are spicier than a typical indian restaurant. \"Mild\" would be a \"Medium\" in most other places. So if you want \"Mild\" you probably need to specify that you don't want much heat at all.\n\nI however love heat, and when we first went there years ago, I jokingly asked the lovely waitress to \"go to the kitchen and slap the chef and say that I don't believe he can make it too spicy\". She replied that was her dad, so she wouldn't slap him, but would relay the information. He didn't disappoint. Even though it was really spicy, and my face flushed, it still tasted great. Which some chili heads will understand that takes skill to walk that line.\n\nI try to go back at least once a month, and I hesitate to give them such a good review, as their restaurant is not that large, and I don't want to have to wait forever for a table.

It was excellent and just confirmed to me how much I love this place.  I had Saag Paneer, Samosas, Rice, Naan and Riata.\n\nAgain, the paneer was super fresh and the saag was really different than I am used to.  Not as creamy and the ingredients tasted more distict than most paneers.  Loved the onion in it.  \n\nNaan cooked to perfection and fresh raita.  They give you a lot of rice so that you can make 2 or three meals out of your one entree.  The food tasted even better the next day.\n\nEverything was nicely packaged and ready to go when I got there.\n\nPlease Saffron Grill.... Add Paneer Tikka Korma to your menu and I'll never go to another Indian restaurant in the city.  Or offer it as a special and let me know.  I'll be there.", "author": "Cynthia R."}

The waitress asked us if we wanted it spicy, and upon saying yes, this is one of the first times in a while that I can remember getting Indian food where they really did properly spice everything.  The fish masala was wonderfully moist and tender, while the chicken vindaloo made you sweat just the way you expect.  The only negative comment came from my friend who felt that the spinach in the saag paneer came from a can, but honestly I thought it was quite tasty (he's a bit pickier than he should be).

I think the maximum capacity is about ten to twelve people for the whole spot, but as you walk in the spices in the air seduce you. \n\nIt seems like it's a family run business which is aces with me, and they are very friendly and welcoming. I tend to like my Indian food on the spicy side so I was extremely happy that out of all the different dishes we ordered there wasn't a single one that was bland. \n\nAgain, it does get a little crowded in this closet of a space, but the food makes it a delicious little whole in the wall spot.", "author": "Beth M."}

I think their selection is actually on the limited side as far as curries go, but the usual staples are just so good it doesn't really matter. The pricing is relatively average, maybe $1 or $2 more than I'm used to seeing, however the portions were pretty generous. I ordered the chicken saag and some naan (their naan was fresh and had just the right chewy consistency).\n\nI usually have a problem with ordering indian food because sometimes when I ask for it spicy, it doesn't turn out as spicy as I would have liked. Luckily, Saffron got it right when I said \"seriously, make it spicy\" and delivered the perfect amount of spice (enough to keep you going for your water, but not enough to kill you...).\n\nOne thing that Saffron does better than most is service. Their staff and genuinely friendly and try their hardest to be accommodating, even when the place is packed. I forgot my waitress' name, but she was a sweetheart who kept joking around with us. I've been to Indian restaurants where the waiter hasn't said more than two words to me, so a little goes a long way. \n\nThe only downside to this place is that it is TINY. Seriously, so crowded! I ate here on a Friday night and I was literally back to back with the table behind me and there is only a narrow walkway from the front of the dining room to the back. There were also like, five babies eating there when I went, so the noise level is a little high.", "author": "Sabrina M."}

My favorite Indian dishes are the super-creamy (korma, tiki masala, and saag paneer, which I could eat every day for the rest of my life), but Saffron Grill prepares them light on the cream and oil, but heavy on the texture and flavor.  Each dish packed a punch of spices--not hotness, but flavor--including delightfully surprising chunks of fresh ginger.  Yum!  This means I can eat Indian food more often...and I'll try the butter chicken for dessert!\n\nThe naan was the best I've ever eaten: soft, yet fully cooked; lush flavor with almost no grease.\n\nWhat makes me love this place more is that they delivered to me via the Divisadero 24!

We wandered to some random organic sushi place the name of which eludes me, but the wait was over an hour.  We tried Little Star, but the wait was still over 1 hour.  So we randomly wandered into Saffron Grill and were hella not disappointed.  Then, many months later, which is to say, last Friday, we intentionally wandered into Saffron Grill and were once again pleasantly impressed.  \n\nFirst, and amazingly, the waitress who is like a super waitress pro, a paragon of waitering, remembered us.  She particularly recalled that we tried to order too much naan, she told us not to, we ordered it anyways, and then didn't finish it.  This time she was like, hey, you didn't finish it last time, don't make the same mistake.  We did not make the same mistake.  By the way, the naan is tasty, even though it comes cut up in a basket.  \n\nThe curry itself is of course where this place shines.  It is much richer and perhaps a bit more tomatoey than I am trained to from my countless trips to Naan and Curry or Pakwan, but that just makes it tastier.  It is also significantly less greasy, which means I feel less gross afterwards.  The variety is exactly what you expect of curry places, plus one or two dishes not usually present.  Also, be sure to ask for the specials, the eggplant special I had was frigging ridiculously good.  So was the giant tandori fish Julia Z ordered.  Crispy on the outside, juicy and meaty on the inside.  \n\nOf course, along with the quality of both the food and the service comes a price, in this case, the fact that unlike Naan and Curry or Pakwan, dining here will cost you $20 a person.  Maybe more when you order drinks.  But who cares, when the food is that good, a couple extra bucks is worth it, no?", "author": "Leon K."}

I wanted to give him a gentle American introduction to Indian food. I chose a chicken tikka masala - who doesn't like that? - and the waitress recommended a lentil dish off the mythical vegan menu that she didn't bring us and i don't see on their website. The chicken tikka masala was great as always, but we weren't the biggest fans of the lentil dish.\n\nBoth times, after stating in no uncertain terms that I wanted it very spicy, they did a pretty good job and gave instructions on how to juice the chiles in the dish to add more heat if desired.

Where else am I going to get Nepalese food?\n\nI came in here expecting the new owners to have improved on Kathmandu Cafe's thrown-together decorations, but apparently, Saffron Grill's owners are either really into minimalism or are really cheap.  The place is spartan inside; the walls in my room have more art on them.  (OK, so that probably doesn't tell you much unless you've been inside my room, which you haven't.  I have one thing hanging on my wall.)\n\nThe food is good, and the service is attentive.  I like how when you sit at the table against the south wall that you can literally reach out and grab more utensils and napkins if you need them.  You can also grab the place's business license and pass it around the table, although I don't encourage this practice.  The menu's got all your favorites, and everything's just as spicy as I like it.  My main problem with Saffron Grill, though, is that the portions are pretty small.  \n\nSaffron Grill is definitely an able replacement for Kathmandu, although if I had to choose one I would take the latter.  It is nice, though, to have a more traditional Indian restaurant in the neighborhood.  (Kathmandu had some Indian food, but it wasn't as spicy as I like it.)

The butter chicken is delish and the lamb coconut curry is also very good. However, at most other places coconut curry is usally a little bit creamy, I don't know which way is the \"traditional\" way, but both are good. The samosas from Saffron are the absolute best I've ever had. The filling is really moist! \n\nSaffron is a little pricey but the quality is slightly better than the places I usually go to.

Early days yet but I may have found that essential of life, the local curry house.\n\nIt's a small, family run place that's low on decor but high in other areas. I tried the combi lamb curry deal and was favorably impressed. \n\nThe opening papadum was well done, with a couple of dipping sauces; one good, one not so good. A decent amount of rice and a pot of lamb achar went down very well - it's about five hunks of meat in a  rich tomato sauce. The accompanying nan bread was fresh and crisp too. \n\nPortion size was smaller than I've seen in other restaurants but certainly more than enough for me. Decent beer selection at bar prices.\n\nThe rice pudding to finish is, however, fantastic. It's sweet and savoury, and is perfect for cooling a hot mouth. \n\nSo I'd give it four and a half stars, since the only complaint could be that it lacked atmosphere.", "author": "Iain T."}

The style is North Indian apparently. The father/chef made familiar dishes with exceptional skill in adding spices, making each dish truly unique and flavorful.\n\nAlso, importantly, they get the significance of atmosphere, something that is nearly always lacking in restaurants. The lights were dim, there was art on the walls, and soft Indian string and drum music played in this intimate setting of about 6 tables.\n\nWhile I was eating someone had come from across town to pick up an order, so things are looking good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-06-22", "description": "Really disappointing experience with Saffron Grill tonight, and I am seeing that the reviews have dipped in the last few months, so perhaps I'm not alone. We've come here to eat in and get take out on several occasions over the past couple of years. It's always been flavorful, friendly service, and reasonably priced. The place had a fire about 18 months ago and we eagerly kept track of its progress to reopening. We enjoyed a great meal a few months back after they got back into business.\n\nTonight, though, the food was supremely disappointing. We called ahead for a to-go order, were told it'd be 15 minutes, showed up when predicted, and the food was definitely not ready. They must have neglected to even make it, cause we had to wait for about 15 minutes to get it to go. Got it home, and opened our containers for Coconut Chicken Curry and Navratan Korma, which we'd had before and loved. This time, instead of the creamy, orange-colored, smooth sauce enveloping chunks of well-spiced vegetables, the dish looked like a package a frozen vegetables got thrown into some light cream, with some cursory spices sprinkled on it. The veggies were mushy and the sauce bland, bland, bland. And, instead of being suspended in the delicious spicy cream goodness, they were just kind of falling apart out of the sauce. The Chicken dish was fine, but the garlic naan, too, was so subpar. Dry, with no whiff of garlic, hardly any butter, close to zero flavor. I've had the naan in the restaurant and take out several times, but this was like someone had sprinkled two shreds of cilantro on a pita and wrapped it up to go. Severely disappointing all around.\n\nI used to love this place, but this was like 3 strikes all at once (lost our order; crappy navratan korma; a joke of a garlic naan). Not sure I'll be going back after this sorry excuse of an Indian meal from a place I know has done better.", "author": "Nika T."}

But now we have Saffron Grill ... a pretty sweet spot for those times when you just want to roll out in your PJs for a low-key, tasty meal served by low-key, nice people. \n\nThe menu is quite extensive, the portions are fair, and the small space is bearable as long as there aren't too many people. We went all out (by our standards) and had 3 beverages, an appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 naan, and 1 rice for $50 including tax and tip. At first I thought the entrees were too mild, but I came to appreciate the subtle flavors and remembered that dishes don't all have to hit you over the head to be good!

I grew up in a family that ran Indian restaurants, so I know a lot about how they are run and what a good curry is. That said, I was super disappointed with Saffron Grill. \n\nWe waited 35 minutes for a table, which was to be expected, but once seated it took them another 20 minutes to take our order and another 50 minutes after that for our food to come out. They didn't check on us--it seemed like more of an avoidance tactic given the tiny size of the place. There was a point where no tables had any food on them and people were complaining, yet they were bringing tons of food out for delivery. Eventually I saw that tables that came in 15-20 minutes after us were receiving food, so I asked about our order and the waiter seemed very confused and without checking said \"another ten minutes\". Of course, 30 seconds later our food came out. \n\nOverall the food was fine to good, but not worth the $2-4 extra per item you pay here compared to other Indian restaurants in the city, especially given the super slow service and the nasty unkempt bathroom (just a new coat of paint would help!). I think if people are looking for non-creamy Indian restaurants they should just look for north Indian (vs south Indian) spots and they'll see there is a lot of better Indian food out there.", "author": "Sara W."}

Also, the portions were so small that any thought of leftovers was quickly forgotten when I finished the last of about 5 small chunks of lamb in my korma. Especially for the prices!! Ohmygod were the prices high for what you're actually getting. Now, I'v been to other high-end (almost fine dining-like) Indian places with prices that high, but you have food for 3 days left over!

On the bright side, it was immediately clear that the setting remained more or less the same the very moment I walked into Saffron Grill. But honestly, how can it not? The space is pretty tiny.\n\nOur waitress was friendly & affable & full of giggles, so immediately the mood was friendly. We ordered a lamb dish & a chicken dish, BOTH were superb, although the reddish color of the lamb gave me a moment of pause. After a quick meeting on the mound with our waitress, she assured us that it wasn't undercooked.

I usually prefer frequenting Indian buffets for ~$10-12, but this place really makes me reconsider since you can actually taste the superior quality of the dishes. We came here around 8:30 PM on a Thursday night and the restaurant was nearly full. We were promptly seated and served complimentary papadum (thin slightly spicy Indian crackers) with two different chutneys (one sweet one spicy). We shared the chicken tikka masala (boneless chicken in a garlic and tomato sauce) and lamb korma (boneless lamb in a creamy cashew, raisins and saffron sauce), with side orders of garlic naan and rice. Wow you can actually tell they use high quality ingredients with a specific emphasis on tenderness and freshness. The chicken and lamb were extremely tender while the curries melded perfectly with the rice and naan. I especially loved the creamy cashew sauce in the lamb korma and couldn't get enough of it! The portion sizes were definitely generous enough to share. Service was very attentive without interfering with your conversation. Lastly, remember to make reservations if you plan to come with a larger group since it doesn't look like this place seats more than 20-25. All in all, the prices are on the higher side for the typical SF Indian restaurant, but I would consider returning here every once in awhile for quality Indian food.

I guess it was Rita (from other reviews) who served me and yes, she was very friendly and bubbly without being at all annoying.  I told her what type of dishes I liked and she recommended the house specialy, Chicken Achar, describing it as \"tangy\" and that it could be cooked as spicy as I like.\n\nI was served a pappadum with both the tamarind and the cilantro sauces and honestly they tasted a bit more homemade than usual, especially the cilantro sauce was much spicier than any I'd ever had.  My main dish was served literally within about 4-5 minutes of ordering.\n\nI had asked for \"medium\" spicy but found the dish to be a little hotter than anticipated.  It would probably benefit and allow more of the subtle flavors through if it was ordered mild.  Regardless, it was a somewhat tangy, tomato-based curry that was pretty good/average but also seemed to get better as it cooled off temperature-wise.  My rice could have been fresher but since I had come in so late....The garlic nan was also fairly typical but with turmeric added to the butter to add some flavor and color.  \n\nOverall the food was very solid and typical Indian food, of an acceptable portion and helped along by friendly and attentive service.  The price is right but once you add some tea, nan and the annoying charge for rice it is no longer super-budget., but still reasonable.

You don't have to get anything spicy at all (they custom fit it for you), but I like to know that they can turn it into overdrive for me.\n\nThis place is not much for decor, and it's pretty small so you'll be enjoying everybody's conversation and you'll be stared at by the too many employees.

The rice was perfectly prepared - I tasted it by itself and a few forkfuls later it rested my fork - savory and delicious. I ordered the Fish Masalla \"Mexican spicy\" (which I assumed would be a bit less than \"Indian hot\")...It was so perfectly prepared, and indeed was quite spicy hot, but only within the context of its delicious flavors. I took the rest home, and just this morning had the rest. I know, not exactly breakfast fare, but even the garlic nan held up well in the microwave.

We got wholewheat roti, warm, fresh naan and white rice.

Being a lover of Indian food I stopped in one day to give it a whirl, and I'm glad I did. I came back about once a month for the year or so I lived in SF. It's one of the few things I miss about San Francisco, actually.\n\nHere's the thing: yes, Saffron Grill is a bit more expensive, but it's for a reason. The food is fresh, delicately flavored (but not at all bland or weak), and the ingredients are high quality. This makes a totally different dining experience than the quick and cheap places, although Saffron Grill is still quick when it comes to take out. The food tastes great and doesn't leave you feeling gross or comatose either.\n\nThe other reason I became a devotee is the service. Even though I was only in there about once a month, the family that runs it recognized me. I was always treated as more than just a customer or a walking wallet. They were friendly, curious, and made me feel welcome. Most of the time I'd get my food and we'd end up chatting for a while longer. That's my kind of service.\n\nThe bottom line is this: if you want cheap food, counter-service, and oil, go to Naan N'Curry, Pakwan (although see my other review on that place), Al Hamra, etc. If you want high quality food, friendly service, and to feel that warm, fuzzy feeling that comes after a healthy, flavorful meal, try Saffron Grill.\n\nIt'll cost you another couple of dollars a plate, but you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Nick H."}

I'd been intending to try Saffron's predecessor, but being that they seem to have disappeared...  All this is quite ok by me, Saffron did me nothing but right!  The tamarind & mint sauces that accompany the while-you-wait cracker are clearly homemade, and I also sincerely hope they start bottling that stuff... that part alone gets 6 or 7 stars in my book!  The mint sauce has a bit of kick to it, the tamarind was tangy and sweet all at once... heavenly.  Truly.\nThen came the totally unexpected samosas, which - yes - heart attack on a plate, and FREAKING TASTY.  I mopped up the remaining mint & tamarind sauces with mine.  Can't waste that stuff.  And I was tempted to ask for more sauce to go with my meal, but mattar paneer has lotsa sauciness already rocking for it.  And a rocking mattar paneer it was, too.  I could definitely taste the depth of spices, and was about ready to lick that bowl clean, too.  At last, Indian food that doesn't have a pool of grease floating atop!  Spinach naan to accompany my meal, and my date had chicken korma with kabuli naan.  He was less impressed with his meal, and that - coupled with the bizarre on-and-off attentiveness of the waitstaff, which I'll attribute to our 5pm seating - are the only things prompting me to knock off that 5th star.

There's always been a wait for tables here and that's understandable during peak hours, but one way to alleviate this problem is to get the dishes out in a timely manner to promote turnover.

Blah, blase, boring, bland, and tasteless.  We ordered three dishes and all of them were dead on arrival.  The missus kept pouring samosa sauces on each of the dishes to give them some semblance of flavor.  The samosas were good, but samosas do not make a restaurant.   Skip this place, folks.", "author": "Mr. V."}

We went in around 10:00pm and even though we were the last ones there, the staff was very kind and didn't make us feel rushed. The sauces were delicious and well executed. It's the kind of place you hope stays around for a long time.", "author": "Anthony C."}

Between me and my companion, we had the paneer shashlik and the prawns masala. The paneer was out of this world and very well made. The spice level was just perfect for us with the paneer being extremely soft and moist. Shrimps masala was also extremely well made, the shrimps were juicy and the curry tasted like it had been freshly made. All in all, a great experience and am sure to visit this place more often.", "author": "Pri S."}

A friend who's from India recommended that I try this place.  He raves about the food here, so I figured it got to be good.  Cheeze, was I surprised, this place is not only good, it was the best Indian food I had in my life.  We ordered Chicken kabob, Onion Nan, Roti, Butter Chicken, Pawns Masala.  Rice pudding and mango smoothie completed our meal.  Everything was delicious!!! The friendly service makes it a perfect evening.  Saffron will be our place for Indian food from now on......", "author": "Kevin T."}

Ever since moving from the South Bay I've thought that a relative lack of good Indian food was just about the only downside of living in SF.  Well, for me anyway, Saffron Grill takes care of that.  If you're looking for some tasty samosas on a random Wednesday night, and you're around Alamo Square or Divis, this is the place for you.", "author": "Conor S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-04-03", "description": "I loved the service, but the food is really, really bland. If you enjoy spicy Indian food, I would not recommend this place. I grew up eating Indian food and lived in India for a year, so I know I'm biased, but this food was seriously lacking flavor and spicing. We even ordered our food spicy, and I thought the fact that my boyfriend is obviously Indian (I'm half, don't look like it tho) would add some weight to our preferences. I can enjoy Indian food without it being spicy as long as there is some kind of flavor. Our vegetable biryani and saag paneer were cooked very well. No pools of oil, ingredients were fresh, colors were vibrant. The quality of the ingredients and how it was cooked made the fact that the food didn't taste like anything even worse. It could have been so good, but ended up failing. Prices are a little high, but I don't mind paying more for quality food. Next time I want more fancy Indian food, I'll stick to Sultan.", "author": "Rekha S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-08", "description": "Like everyone else who reviewed, I live in the neighborhood and enjoyed KC while it was here.  But to be honest, I much prefer Saffron Grill's menu over KC's due to the better vegetarian options (ie. paneer).  We've eaten here twice and the food has been good both times.  I love the fact that they serve Flying Horse beer, because it is by far the best Indian brew that I've found to date.  And the friendliness and sense of humor of our waitress this past visit made the meal that much better.  It is clearly a family run business, which is exactly the kind of business that I like to support.  During our most recent visit, my gf ordered malai kofta and asked for it 'extra spicy.'  The waitress gave her a crooked smile and a look that said \"I like a girl who can handle her spice.\"  The outcome was perfect...much like someone else said...left you wanting more and calling uncle at the same time.  Support this local restaurant.", "author": "Lee M."}
