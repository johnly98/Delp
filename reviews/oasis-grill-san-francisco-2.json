It's not the best Mediterranean food I've ever had, but the gyros, Shawarmas, and falafels here are legit.\n\nOn my most recent visit, I ordered the Chicken Shawarma, which is like a Mediterranean burrito served in Lavash bread. Although the meal was tasty, the chicken was a bit sparse and dry... and the whole thing could've benefitted from a bit more spice. But then again, it was 10pm on a Monday night, there were no other fast-casual spots open near my hotel, and I was hungry/bordering on \"hangry.\" So when you take all of that into consideration, Oasis Grill was pretty much Shangri-La.\n\nI'd definitely give them another shot.

Noticed Oasis on our way in and decided that would be dinner. Reviews were middle of the road in my opinion, but I said heck why not, I'm tired and hungry so let's give it a whirl. The other reviewers were right in terms of customer service, absolutely no violins with the cashier. She acted like our questions were slightly bothersome (it was crystal clear this was our first dining experience), annoyed look on her face, and she'd rather be doing anything else besides helping hungry folks get some grub. I ordered the lamb and beef gyro which was delicious. Too much lettuce and not enough meat, but it was dee-lish. The pita looked more like a tortilla so I was worried the gyro would disappoint, but it had amazing flavor. Hubby ordered the lamb shawarma, and it knocked my flavor-meter out of the park. Uhmazing taste, I immediately regretted my yummy gyro and wanted a shawarma lol. The sweet potatoes fries (barely a shareable portion) for $4.99 was just plain unacceptable. Not lightly salted, not crunchy (too much oil) which was fine, the price point was out bounds, add some potatoes or reduce the price. Sandwiches were great, totally worth returning but we will not, due to our cashier experience. My hubby who never comments or complains, even mentioned his unwelcome experience with her, so it's pretty bad if he comments lol.

It was on \"lavash\" bread instead of the more common pita that other spots in the city often use and therefore was HUGE - bigger than 90% of the burritos you can find at any of the taquerias in the city. Inside it had just the right ratio of filling to sauce (tzatziki aka white sauce + hot sauce aka red sauce + hummus applied directly to the lavash). In addition to the falafel there was lettuce and lettuce plus some tomatoes and onions. I saw that they also had a vegetarian mezza platter with babaganoush which I absolutely love and asked for a side fully expecting them to charge me for it but they happily gave me a small container of it- note for next time to ask for it in the wrap while ordering.\n\nI will definitely be back and will be exploring more of the menu.

It's clearly not going to blow anyone away, but if you're in the area and have a serious hankering for some gyro wraps?  Not too shabby, friends.  Not too shabby!\n\nA mini-chain of sorts, Oasis Grill has five different locations in the Bay Area, though they're mostly concentrated around downtown SF (there's one in Berkeley).  While this particular one has a relatively decent amount of seating, they're primarily a grab-and-go type of joint.  However, the food is better than just convenient, as it more than satisfied my cravings both times I've been here.\n\n-- BEEF & LAMB GYRO WRAP and CURLY FRIES...$8.49 and $4.00, respectively\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oasis-grill-san-francisco-2?select=GmwXMMVzicuI_MxYSStQ6A)\nOn the one hand, this really hit the spot.  Not only were the veggies super fresh, but the cuts of lamb and beef were quite flavorful.  At the same time though, I wish it had more meat!  As for the fries, they tasted fine, but it's hard to say just how good they were since they were a bit soggy by the time we got back to my friend's place.\n\n-- MIXED GRILL PLATE - Beef, Chicken, and Kefta (Ground Lamb) Skewers with sides, including Rice, Hummus, Cucumber & Yogurt Salad, Green Salad, and Bread...$16.99\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oasis-grill-san-francisco-2?select=ACXAkXxyrIzwOpFyPrvFag)\nThe price is somewhat hefty, but it's both filling and a great way to try several things.  All three meats were pretty good, but I liked the kefta the best - kind of like a lamb burger patty and not at all gamey.  As for the sides, some of them were actually pretty interesting, especially the rice (it tasted like buttery popcorn...).\n\nAlthough Oasis Grill is a solid spot for a relatively quick bite, coming here should really be a result of already being in the area.   Street parking is at a relative premium and, while the 5th and Mission Garage is just a block away, this probably isn't/shouldn't be your ultimate destination that'd you be willing to pay by the hour for.

Didn't really pay attention to the atmosphere or any of that junk. I walked in, ordered at the counter. Waited for my food to be prepared. Then ate it. \n\nOasis is a chain. They're all over. It's also like most Greek shops with falafels, gyros and dolmas. I got a shawarma wrap this time around. It was good. Very solid spot to get a Greek fix when you're in a pickle, but you will pay a little extra since it is SF. Not a top must visit since it's a chain.

I assume this location, formerly the gawd-awful Jollibee's, is related to the original one on Drumm Street across from the Hyatt Regency on the Embarcadero. \n\nI like the original place, this one not so much. The cashier really seemed bothered that I wanted to order anything, but I persisted and asked for a $7.75 Kefta Kebab, a grilled lavash wrap with a combination of ground beef and lamb, lettuce, tomatoes, and doused with tahini sauce (see photo). What was tasty at the original location came out as dried-out and nearly inedible at this one. So disappointing that I couldn't finish it - which as anyone knows me, almost never happens. Jamie W. was similarly unimpressed, and neither of us were happy that the tables didn't look like they had been bussed all day. I wish I knew to bring my sponge and Formula 409. \n\nFOOD - 2 stars...a kebab that went kaboom \nAMBIANCE - 2 stars...anyone know where I can get a mop? \nSERVICE - 1.5 stars...some vocational guidance may be needed here \nTOTAL - 2 stars...think I'll need to haul my butt to Baladie if I want quality lavash wraps", "author": "Ed U."}

Instead of the radish and red onions (among other ingredients) listed on the menu, they threw in olives, along with red and green bell peppers which appeared to be a part of one of the salad mixes in the bins.

I think that a wrap should be able to be consumed without using a plate, or 75 napkins, but the minute you bite into this wrap, the sauce gushes all over the place and the wrap starts falling apart.

The prime location across from Moscone Center has allowed the service and food quality to be sub par. It's too bad  because this cuisine is fairly easy to do and really tasty when done right. Everything costs $ 9-12 ( that's about 4 more than other mid east places) and it's essentially a take out  joint.\nThe girls working there must be sedated , you know that distant stare and your order comes out without the hot sauce you requested, plus they don't even offer you a drink? That's what greeted us, even before the lunch rush on a Wednesday.\nThe food was slim ( as in small portions) even the server could not tell the falafel wrap from the lamb. The wraps are thick with carb laden lavosh bread and thin with fillings.\nThe real crime is the old and soggy baklava. Fresh baklava is a sublime experience, with crispy filo & layers of nuts, honey and pure yumminess. Avoid their impotent soggy bottom triangles, It's an insult to good pastries everywhere.\nThese guys should to step it up a lot, but with all the visitors walking by who will never return, there is no real incentive.

I was iffy about the spot walking towards it, but I must say I was happy.  The food was authentic and tasty.  The workers were nice and very accommodating.  I got the gyro meal and it was worth the 8 dollars i spent.  I've been to other places that served Mediterranean food and it was just over priced and not good at all!

The interior is bright and open, though it is not big. The floor layout is a bit odd. I ordered the Kefka Kabob plate. Ordering was a breeze. The attendant is attentive and friendly. I did see him help the next customer figure out coin denominations. The cook staff was not very fast and tended to get distracted. Maybe it was because it was the end of their night? I got my meal it was in a portable plastic clam shell. The meat was served on a bed of veggies over rice. A cucumber yogurt, red cabbage slaw and hummus accompanied the plate. In the center there was pocket with a generous portion of sirracha/hot sauce.  The portions seemed good. The kefka was delicious, moist and spiced nicely. The rice was tender and tasty. The hummus was good. I am not much of a humus nut, but enjoyed with the pita. It did seem zestier than most others. A very tasty satisfying meal.", "author": "Angel B."}

The food is of great quality, and well priced in the middle of the business district of SF. The owner Hisham was on top of everything, lunch time when hundreds of people were looking for lunch, he was taking care of everybody. The line was down the street and he was running between all people taking their orders so you don't wait too long.\nNow the food, get the plates not the sandwichs, there is lot more value in the plates and you get Hummus, salad, Tabbouleh, rice and much more. Hisham was very nice he offered my elderly dad extra rice and pita bread. The grilled mix is absolutely worth it and the Mezza plate (has falafel, hummus, etc...) a veggie plate is an excellent choice too. The meat is tender and delicious, the falafel is amazing too.\nThe prices ranged from $8 for sandwiches to $13-17 for the plates, but it is absolutely worth it.\nI will go back there again for sure", "author": "M A."}

But the food itself was not good.  We ordered two greek salads with gyro meat on top.  The dressing had no flavor at all and the gyro meat tasted and looked like something you would get from a mall food court - not freshly carved from the rotisserie.  The feta was so mild that it was almost flavorless as well.  There was really nothing I liked about the meal and at $28 for the salads an Orangina and a bottled water, we were very disappointed.  We won't be back. (I guess I am a little spoiled - we have a fantastic greek place closer to home and everything is compared to it.

Here in SF I decided I'd give this place a try, not once, but twice. Each time I've reminded myself not to go back.  For $9 I got the beef and lamb gyro. Last time I had the chicken shwarma...not good. The meat used is precut, grabbed from a container and reheated on the grill. It's tasteless and has similar texture to a garden burger, and tastes just as bland. What saves the gyro (wrap) from complete failure is the sauce, but in terms of value and taste $9 is steep, and it's not even downtown. The gyro needs to be bigger, and have more taste, before I'd really want to shell out $9 again. Staff also seems more preoccupied with personal matters and chit chat amongst themselves.", "author": "Marcus C."}

The park is close so you can go eat there, or the peir...\nAnyway, I ordered the Maui? something? it was $10... I thought it was a bit pricey but it says half chicken with rice and salad, so I gave it a whirl thinking I'd share it with my 16 month old. \nI was asked if I wanted is plain, a little spicy, or really spicy. I chose \"a little\" and it was perfect. Even my 16 month old had some and it was fine for her too.\nThe chicken was a little dry, but thats what happens with cut up chicken right after it's cooked usually. Veggies were mixed in a bit over done, but still good. I chose the greek salad and tabouli salad to go with it. The tabouli went well with the dish (cooling when the spice started adding up) The greek salad was just salad with tomatoe and bell pepper and olive oil. :-/ They should take out the bell pepper and add feta cheese and olives (thats GREEK salad!)\nOver all it was still pretty good. I ate it ALL. It was a lot of food! The chicken and rice part reminded me a bit of chicken cacciatore, minus the tomatoe sauce of course.\nI'd gladly order it again.\nMy husband ordered a chicken shawarma and said they suck at making them. He said it wasn't even close to being a shawarma and that they added the tabouli salad to it when he asked for the greek.\nI would of taken another star off for his experience, but I was too busy stuffing my face with my chicken cacciatore...er...maui something or other...\nThis place is also Halal :)", "author": "Crystal C."}

It was the rudest service I've ever received at a halal restaurant in my life, and was treated different from the other customers. When I ordered they didn't bring the food to my table or call my name. It wasn't until 15-20 minutes of me waiting did I walk over and ask where my food was and they said it was sitting there--no longer hot by then. Thinking it was my fault for not hearing my order being called I took it and said nothing. Then I noticed the employees delivered the food to the tables of all the other customers. My boyfriend noticed it too and asked the employee if they brought food to the customers when they ordered...he said they did and did not answer him when he asked why we were treated differently. Right when that happened I noticed hair in my pita bread then threw it in the compost bin in frustration. The most disappointing thing was that I really wanted to support this restaurant and have them cater events I organize but I guess that won't happen.", "author": "Catherine M."}

Salt, garlic and onion - don't be afraid of them! Cucumber salad was completely bland - could have used lemon juice and salt AND olive oil. Kefta Kebab Lavash Wrap had flavors of tahini sauce, grilled lavash bread, fresh crispy romaine and tomato - and halfway through the wrap the meat vanished.\nNow for the meat:\nI got the PLAIN Kefta Kebab - no \"hot sauce\". The Kefta Kebab is missing the flavors of a seasoned meat - such as garlic, onion or even drippings of beef and lamb. It tasted sauteed not grilled. Where's the flavor? Fat? Richness?\nI can see plenty of chopped parsley, bits if red and the meat is soft and finely ground. yet it is neither pink nor brown - neither tastes cooked or raw. I do however get large bits of gristle throughout. Also, the meat is distributed at the ends and is missing from the middle. I'd put up with all of that if it just had great flavor. How about salt and garlic?\nHowever the pre-packaged \"nut bars\" in front of the cash register, especially the sesame bars, are spectacular - soft and chewy, for $2 apiece.\nI could have gone to Ayola on 2nd for a really flavorful \"kebab\".", "author": "Nan L."}
