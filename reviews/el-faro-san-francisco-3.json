I ordered a Super Steak Burrito and received it in less than two minutes at $7- the only positive about this experience.\n\nHowever, I quickly regretted my lunch choice after taking the initial bite. I have NEVER had a worst Super Steak Burrito in my life. And I'm Mexican. The steak didn't resemble steak, it was like a \"carne en su jugo\", or a meat stew, watery and flavored like meat stew. This taste of this \"meat juice\" was so overpowering too. \n\nSuper Steak Burritos are supposed to have a bite and be somewhat chewy, with a wonderful creaminess to it due to the crema and guacamole. This burrito had no bite, no substance, it was a watery, mushy, flavorless mess. You could literally drink the inside.\n\nThe rice was also over cooked and watery, the tortilla was too thin to hold it all, and the size was more like Child Size than a Super Burrito. This experience was utterly disappointing. Even the salsa that the counter boy snuck me couldn't have saved it.", "author": "Itzel R."}

I was told about this spot by my boss on how they have the \"best breakfast burritos\". I love breakfast burritos so I was challenged to try this place out. Their breakfast burrito is OFF. THE. HOOK. It's very tasty and is better when you get the salsa on the side so you can control how much is put in there because sometimes too much salsa can ruin a burrito, but the eggs, the beans, the chorizo and cheese was just too heavenly of a combination to pass up. \n\nThe ladies behind the counter are very fast and very hard working and I have never been disappointed by a burrito they have made for me and I've been coming back almost once or twice a week now. The only real downside this place has going for it is the fact that it does feel unorganized where you have to stand in line to order your food then take your food to another line to pay where, get this, it's cash only. Oi! As someone who doesn't carry a lot of cash around with them, if at all, it would be wise to at least keep an emergency $10 bill handy just in case you're feeling hungry and want a breakfast burrito. This isn't directed at El Faro specifically but this is the year 2015 and there are still cash only establishments around? Weird. \n\nBut anyways, the breakfast burrito is great.

No choice of beans if you order a burrito - seems to be canned refried by default. The choice of meats is laughable too - literally \"pork\", \"chicken\", or \"beef\". No carnitas, no al pastor, no pollo al carbon. Too confusing for their insulting caricature of White People I guess. Instead you get what appears to be pork or beef roasted with absolutely no marinade or any kind of special preparation whatsoever, and chicken that looks like it's also floating in the Campbell's Soop. Way the hell too much salt in everything too.\n\nA \"baby burrito\" is $4.75 after tax and you only get the crap rice, refried beans, and meat. If there's not even at least pico de gallo in it there's not even a point, it doesn't even qualify as Mexican food. Oh, no free chips/salsa with anything either. And the serving ladies talk shit if you take more than 0.5 nanoseconds looking over the menu. I guess they have a point, they've dumbed it down so much there's nothing to think about - pork crap, chicken crap or beef crap are your choices.\n\nI don't mind being cruel, this food is overpriced garbage and I'm insulted that someone actually thought people would want to pay for this.

In my last breakfast burrito review I said that of utmost importance was that none of the ingredients be microwaved which spoke to the quality of the contents.  When I walked in to El Faro and saw an actual griddle where they were cooking eggs I nearly leapt for joy.  Here is the breakfast burrito I have sought lo' these many weeks.  Finally, I thought, a replacement for the Foccacia cafe' breakfast burrito.\n\nMy first indication of trouble should have been the spoonful of runny refried beans they glopped onto the tortilla....I think a prior reviewer said it looked like runny baby goo.  I second that very descriptive and unfortunately accurate depiction.  I ended up not paying too much attention after that, so engrossed was I in the book that I was reading that the next time I actually saw the contents of my burrito was when I took my first bite.  Scrambled eggs, cooked to order mixed with cheese, churizo, ham (I think) and bacon (I think) and topped off with a very runny weird tasting red sauce.  Hello, El Faro, meet potatoes.  They belong in a breakfast burrito. Enough said.  \n\nHad I spent my Thursday night out at a bar doing car-bombs or shots of Jack Daniels I may have given the burrito an extra star as a hangover cure, greasy as it was.   Then again, the consistency of the contents may have also driven me to dash for the nearest restroom and they may still, based on the composition which for the record was about 84% grease.  \n\nSufficed it to say that while the people there may have been tolerant (if not nice) and the eggs were cooked on a griddle rather than microwaved, this sad excuse for a breakfast burrito comes nowhere close to the quality or the deliciousness of that served by the Foccacia cafe.  Although my search for a good breakfast burrito continues my hope wanes that anything of quality will be found before our move to 50 California, where I can be reunited with the wonder of Focaccia cafe once again.", "author": "Joshua F."}

It's 6 bucks for a breakfast burrito, but it does taste decent. Not the best deal in town. No chips to go with it either. If you want chips it's another 1.50 or salsa is another 1 something. Nickel and dime everything which makes people consider other places for lunch.", "author": "Allan T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-08-22", "description": "For an El Faro, this one is so-so. The burritos are fine/ok/average, but when you walk out with a burrito and a can of coke, you flip out even more when the staff... fills a salad spoon's worth of meat, yet seems to generously fill their mitts with lettuce. Yeah, it's downtown, but even if this place was on the corner of Montgomery and California it'd still be the biggest Mexican rip-off in SF.", "author": "K B."}

I ended up giving three because although El Faro sucks slightly, I keep coming back.  That's gotta mean something.\n\nI have read others' reviews saying that they do not like the red sauce on top of their burritos.  I however love it.  I find their food to be inconsistent.  Sometimes the rice is undercooked, sometimes it's overcooked.  Sometimes the carnitas is tender and other times it seems dry.  They always put guacamole in my burritos (I have witnessed it each and every time), and somehow when I cut into my lunch I never see or taste the guac.  I hate their chips.  I am shocked to read that anyone would pay for them.  I also feel like the burritos are expensive and I don't think they're very big at all.  I am a slender girl with a very normal appetite.  I can finish a burrito from El Faro easily when I can not finish one at most other places.  I ordered a baby burrito once ($5) since I wasn't that hungry, but I regretted it.  It was truly a baby burrito.  I ordered a super burrito today ($6.35) and did not think it was much bigger.\n\nSome days my food is inexplainably good.  Other days it is inexplainably bad.  I can never figure out what makes their burritos good one day and bad the next.  It's weird.", "author": "Kandi K."}

When a friend recommended this place, I decided to venture in and try it out.  \n\nI had a tamale and two crispy tacos.  The tacos were horrible, greasy, full of weird chewy bits, and had a very peculiar tasting hot sauce.  The tamale was microwaved with a styrofoam container (is that safe?).  mMMMmm, no.  Actually, it tasted alright though, but definitely isn't a way to win a regular customer.  And I was quite surprised to find that there wasn't any hot sauce on the tables to use (but there was salt and pepper).  Who puts salt and pepper on their mexi-food?  \n\nNot horrendous, but definitely not good.", "author": "Eric T."}

A friend of mine were looking for a place to eat lunch and popped into this place. I haven't been in here awhile. It's nice to know that 1) the place and decor have NOT changed, 2) the service from the entire staff is a dismal to the say the least if not terrible! and 3) the food may be cheap, but you get what you pay for. I ordered a simple Super Burrito with no beans.  As I paid for both my meal and my friends, we sat down and were ready to chow down.  Halfway towards the end of my burrito I noticed something. I looked at my food and noticed a long dark hair .  At first I thought it may be mine until I realized it was all the way inside of my food.  I immediately was turned off.  Picked up my plate and set it in the bucket for removal.  Why didn't I tell the staff?  With a wonderful personality that they all had, do you think I would even attempt it???", "author": "O .."}

He needs to dramatically expand his walkable range if this indeed is the case.\n\nUltimately, the burrito itself surprised on the upside after the grim experience of viewing its assembly:  soupy beans, a teaspoon of crusty carnitas scraped from the dregs of a dodgy chafing dish, \"spicy sauce\" languishing in the tepid range clearly proscribed by public health code.\n\nWalking back with bag in hand, I chastised myself for ignoring the mass of yelpers and following the lead of a single coworker.  Yet once unwrapped and in my mouth, the salty, slightly spicy goodness that is a carnitas burrito tamed my ire.  \n\nThis was an OK burrito - no more or less.  I'll keep looking.", "author": "KJ B."}

By the time I peeled off the foil the tortilla just ripped apart all over the place because the refried beans were so runny.\n\nI thought I would go another time to try the enchiladas, what a joke.

But when I'm ready for some Mexican cuisine indulgence, this is a great place. You can't beat the value, especially in downtown SF. I gave it four stars because the food is good (from my experience), but the service isn't always the best. One time I stood in line for a million years and waited to order from the person my friend ordered from, which turned out to be a huge mistake because I somehow kept getting passed over to order. The other times I've been it's been fine though. I'm kind of scared reading these other reviews; but I feel like, hey, if you're paying $5 for a burrito, get over the fact that the establishment is not high class. Last time I was there I ate the Acapulco burrito, which is loaded with shrimp and which I highly recommend.", "author": "Lisa F."}
