I'm a die hard See's Candie's fan and don't often venture away from the tried and try nuts n' chews bow. Finally ventured in last weekend with friend and glad we decided to take the leap!\n\nThe service was impeccable! We got to try a sample of their chocolate and learned a lot about how they are made-most are hand painted!!! The chocolates really are gorgeous and well made. They also taste amazing! I got a box of four and a turtle (dark chocolate with chili and sea salt). My sampler included an earl grey ganache, sea salt, passion fruit and a coffee flavor. \n\nThere's a very cute lounge to sit and enjoy your chocolates. They serve drinking chocolate as well and will try that next time. Definitely would recommend and would make a unique gift for anyone not from SF.", "author": "Semuteh F."}

A friend gave them to me on Friday, September 7th a little before 6:30pm.\n\n9-piece Chocolate Collection:\n*Bananas Foster: bananas and caramel flambeed with rum\n*Fleur De Sel Caramel: caramel infused with grey French sea salt\n*Lavender Caramel: caramel infused with French lavender\n*Vanilla Bean: caramel infused with Madagascar vanilla beans\n*Champagne: milk chocolate ganache blended with French champagne\n*Butterscotch Bourbon: aged Kentucky bourbon blended with a brown sugar caramel\n*Strawberry Balsamic: caramel made with fresh strawberries and aged balsamic vinegar\n*Kalamansi-Lime: milk chocolate ganache infused with fresh lime juice and fragrant kalamansi\n*Fresh Lemon: fresh lemon marmalade and lemon infused white chocolate ganache\n\nI've had their chocolates before and they are indeed fancy. I'm not huge on milk chocolate, but I don't mind a piece of very dark or white from time to time. I'm a big fruit person, so I tried the lemon first. It had a nice tartness to it. The banana one had a strong rum flavor which surprised me. Normally alcoholic chocolates aren't that spirit forward in taste. I do like my liquor, so I didn't mind this.The vanilla one was simple. Vanilla and caramel. Who doesn't like that? The lavender caramel one was a little too floral for me. Almost like eating perfume. The rest, I have yet to try, but I'm looking forward to sampling the remaining chocolates.\n\nA lovely birthday treat.

Indeed, I'd recommend going out of your comfort zone and trying flavors you might not normally pick. You might be as pleasantly surprised as I was with taking the risk.

We ended up going with the hazelnut drinking chocolate made with water instead of milk, as she explained that it would be a bit too rich with milk. I was glad we listened to her, as our drink was absolutely perfect the way she made it. \n\nUpon ordering, Amanda asked us if we wanted our drink to be topped with a marshmallow or whip cream. We got ours with a marshmallow, which even I surprisingly liked (I don't like marshmallows, but my boyfriend does). While she was ringing us up, she told us that if we drank a bit off the top, she would top us off with the remaining liquid chocolate she had, which was super sweet. \n\nOur decadent drinking chocolate, which satisfied both of our chocolate cravings, came out to $4.50, a fair price for what I believe is the best \"hot chocolate\" I've ever had. The gift items are also fairly priced, so I would definitely recommend checking them out.\n\nThe individual chocolates are a bit pricey, coming in at $2 a piece, if I remember correctly. However, Christopher Elbow chocolates do a great job fusing chocolate with art, as each piece is beautifully crafted. \n\nThe shop's decor is also very modern and inviting. The back section of the shop, which is very well lit and comfortably quiet, is open to customers to sit and enjoy their purchases. However, if you're planning to come here in a big group, I would suggest taking your chocolate items to go, as the space doesn't have very many seats. \n\nI would definitely recommend giving this place a try if you love high quality, artisanal chocolates.", "author": "Janelle C."}

This is where I come to veg out after a day of eating, hoping, wine drinking on Hayes. This is where I come to grab my pretty boxes to take home to and give gifts to. This is also a place I always stop by on my way to the airport and nearly missed few flights back home. \n\nWhat can a girl do in such amazing shop except squeal and marvel??! Ahhh! Luckily, they are not in Seattle. Or unluckily since I have to make a trip  three times a year just for this.

All the prettiest of the pretty artisan chocolates in all different shapes and colors. They are on the pricier side but have you seen the details on them?? Seriously! They look like jewels. So beautiful and so tasty!\n\nVenezuelan spice hot chocolates- super rich but the spice is tasty. \nFav chocolates- Spiced Orange ( beautiful!) , Passion Fruit Caramel, Fleur del sel caramel, Lavender caramel, Bana Foster( with rum!) Champagne! Ahh so many favorite flavors.\n\nBoxes are $32 for 16 pieces and $42 for 21 pieces. I also love their drinking chocolates to go. As well as their Dark Spice and Dark ginger bars! Overall, this is a modern day chocolate factory.  \n\nIt is simple, cute and small-ish place covered with amazingly stunning and tasty chocolate pieces calling your name. I can NEVER go in here and not buy myself a box or two. I can always get it online but where's the fun in that?! Walking in here , smelling , tasting and picking the perfect pieces out?

Rich, creamy caramel with a good amount of lavender. Lavender is really hit or miss with most people but I like lavender a lot and I really liked this piece.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-10-31", "description": "Christopher Elbow is my second favorite chocolatier with a shop in the Bay Area -- and that's saying a lot. His boutique shop in Hayes Valley is a must whenever I'm in the city, and I always get his boxed sets as gifts for family and friends.  Here are my chocolate notes:\n\nThe fruity series\n\nFresh lemon\n- very refreshing, with the tart lemon providing a nice balance to the sweetness of the white chocolate \n\nPineapple\n- milk choco ganache blended with pineapple, in a creamy milk choco shell. Not too sweet, just right amount of tangy flavor with sweetness. Edges out the fresh lemon. \n\nStrawberry balsamic\n- a novelty piece: strawberry with aged balsamic vinegar wrapped in white choco. However, I would rate it better if they changed the white chocolate shell to dark or milk choco\n\nFresh raspberry\n- A piece that is characteristic of Christopher Elbow's whimsical take on chocolates: sweet raspberry pate which matches well with dark choco. \n\nMango basil\n- dark chocolate with mango pate and basil ganache. Sounds good, but tastes just ok.\n\nFig and port wine\n\n- this complex chocolate blend is truly unique and a cut above the rest. It does need an open mind to appreciate it. It has fig jam with the sweet strong taste of port. An acquired taste, but I personally like it. \n\n\nThe nutty series \n\nMacadamia praline \n- Dark choco shell. milk choco ganache with caramelized mac bits and sea salt.\n- I have nothing to say other than this is my fave piece of his selection!\n\nCaramel pecan marzipan \n- I'm not a big fan of marzipan, but this one really works for me -- pecan marzipan with salted caramel ganache.\n\nPeanut praline\n- this is a nutty and crunchy piece compared to the peanut bonbons at other chocolatiers, which is perfectly fine by me ;) \n\nCitrus hazelnut praline \n- Did I say the macadamia praline was my favorite Christopher Elbow bonbon?  Move over, because I think this one is!\n- caramelized hazelnuts with milk choco, and tinge of orange zest.  refreshing and nutty at the same time. Love!\n\nCookie butter \n- it's not a praline, but it feels nutty and it's got crunch!\n- if u like crunchy speculoos, then this is that wrapped in dark chocolate \n- not my fave, but I like it!!\n\nThe caramel series \n\nFleur de sel \n- caramel wrapped in dark choco. Nice slightly salty aftertaste but the caramel is too liquid. I like Michael Mischer's version a little better\n\nVanilla caramel \n- almost like the fleur de sel.  caramel infused with madagascar vanilla bean, wrapped in a dark chocolate shell. \n- a bit sweet but still tolerable\n\nPassion fruit caramel \n- slightly better than Chocolatier Blue's passion fruit piece. \n- I love passion fruit. This one is with a white choco shell. I don't normally like white choco, but I'll let it go for this piece. It's a good mix. \n- a must have for me when at Chris Elbow's. \n \nRosemary caramel\n- novelty piece: herb and chocolate blend done right. subtle with creamy deep milk chocolate. \n \nBanana foster\n- a little too sweet for me\n\n\nThe hockey pucks\n\nDark hazelnut\n- almost as good as Nuubia's hazelnut bar. \n- hazelnut ganache with crunchy nutty bits wrapped in dark chocolate \n- one upgrade would be to add caramel, but I think that's what the turtle puck is for. \n\nDark Venezuela chili spice\n- if you like it spicy... \n\nDark turtle (sea salt caramel + nut)\n- most popular puck. Rightly so! Must have. \n\n\nThe bars\n\nHe had several different flavors, but my faves are:\n\n71% dark with toffee and Hawaiian red salt\n\n71% dark with pop rocks\n \n\n\nOverall verdict and what to get:\n\n- citrus hazelnut praline,  Mac praline, cookie butter, caramel pecan, peanut, passion fruit and hazelnut puck\n\n- Overall, Christopher Elbow has a great location, cool vibe and artsy/refined chocolates that are as good as it looks.  His pieces have a lot of character -- I almost feel like I know Christopher already just with a bite of his whimsical pieces.

(some people have cookie jars, I have a chocolate jar)\n\nI look forward to friend's trips abroad because it's guaranteed that I'll get chocolates, but the ones I'm really excited about are chocolates from Christopher Elbow.\n\nPriced at $2 each, these little delights are elegant to look at and taste like it too.\n\nThe Venezuelan Spice is a dark ganache infused with a chili spice blend. It is melt in your mouth good.\n\nThe Banana Rum is a milk chocolate with a rum liquer center. It is heaven in a box good.\n\nThe Fleur de Sel is a soft caramel ganache made with French sea salt. Oui, oui. It is finger lickin good. \n\nBy far, Champagne is my fave flavor. Coming from a girl who likes bubbly, how can you go wrong with this flavor?!  Moet and Chandon champagne blended with milk and dark chocolate into a creamy ganache.  It is, SERIOUSLY, make me want to drop my panties good!

Carrying a wide selection of goods, they had everything from fancy decorated truffles in their display cases, to some 15 varieties of chocolate bars on the shelves, as well as liquid chocolate and more.\n\nOpting to stick with the basics, I picked up a Venezuelan 70% and Fortunato No 4  truffle at $2 a piece, as well as their No 14 Dark 85 Chocolate Bar (an 85% cacao blend) for $7. And, while I can't say I was particularly impressed with the two truffles I had, their No 14 bar was spectacular, with a flavor profile more akin to that of a low 70-some% bar than that of the usual strong, bitter 85%.\n\nSo, while their truffles alone would only land them a two star rating, that chocolate bar easily makes them a four, so, let's split the difference shall we?", "author": "Johnny W."}

The chocolates are like little jewels displayed in the store, they look pretty and they taste even better. Their caramels are so smooth and creamy, buttery and salty. The best I have ever had. Loved the nuts too, works well with the sea salt. The only fruit flavor I tried was the raspberry and again it was excellent, very fresh rich raspberry flavor. They are a little pricey but no more so than any other chocolate of this kind, but for the taste quality and presentation I think these are worth it.I have added photos.

I hated assorted chocolate\n\nI grew up on Sees candy and other cheaper boxes of assorted chocolate. I rarely ever ate the entire box. I also hated biting into a mystery chocolate only to find out I didn't like it.\n\nFor Valentine's Day I researched chocolatiers. Christopher Elbow popped up. I called his website store to order, apparently the website is connected to their Ohio(?) location. The promo shipping code I got was only for Ohio residents. I mentioned I was in CA and they shipped me a box with a lesser shipping and gave me the coupon discount. They wound up shipping from the SF location. I told them the date that I would like them to arrive, the Friday before Valentine's. Friday rolls along, BOOM there's my chocolate packed with a cooling bag.\n\nWhen we opened up the package, there was the salted caramels, the assortment box, and 2 different bars.\n\nMy SO and I would eat half and share the other with one another just to try all of the flavors. AND WOW! Literally, everything I tried was PHENOMENAL! The flavors just burst into your mouth with such intensity and subtly at the same time. All of the flavored chocolate that sounded like strange things to have, in a chocolate nugget form, was amazing.\n\nYes, the chocolates are expensive. But for fresh ingredients in your chocolates and the handcrafted designs.

My friend T. handed over a simple beige box tied up with a chocolate brown ribbon and bow. Unbeknownst to me, the understated box was really a treasure chest that contained tiny jewels of chocolate nirvana. I consider myself a chocolate connoisseur but after one bite of CEAC's chocolate, I humbly acknowledge I was a chocolate Philistine. \n\nI tried my first chocolate just before the curtain rose. It was the Passion Fruit Caramel. As I broke into the thin outer shell of chocolate, I was hit by an intense blast of fruit that segued into the deep caramelized sweetness of the liquid caramel. \n\nI was hooked. I next tried the Coconut Caramel. I enjoyed the concentrated coconut flavor but I didn't care for the texture of the dried coconut flakes. It interfered with the smooth perfection of the caramel. I consumed my third chocolate during intermission. The Fleur de Sel Caramel was a perfect blend of salty, sweet and bitter. \n\nI bit into my last chocolate, the Lavender Caramel, with trepidation. Adding lavender to food is a tricky balancing act. You want to add enough to taste the ingredient but too much and it can taste like you are eating soap. CEAC accomplished this tricky maneuver with ease. No soap in my caramel today.\n\nIt is commonly said that we eat with our eyes. If so, CEAC chocolates is definitely a visual feast. However, people tend to be swayed by the pretty packaging but are often disappointed by the lack of flavor once they taste their food. Well I can safely assure you that CEAC is not just pretty packaging. There is substance behind all that beauty. I can't wait to stop by their store and try all the pretty chocolates.", "author": "Cece E."}

It was really good. Usually some places have this whipped/buttery texture, but not here. There's also a thin wafer at the bottom giving it a small crunch. You can choose milk chocolate or dark chocolate. \n\nRussian tea bon bon - not fragrant enough but still good nonetheless. (Go to cocoa bella for the jasmine tea instead)\n\nSpiced honey bon bon - very good. A very good mix of honey and chocolate, with a very slight hint of spice. \n\nThe mocha was really rich. I was afraid that it will taste like other regular mochas from starbucks or whatnot, but I was pleasantly surprised. The mocha was much more rich, much more chocolatey and there was a slight tangy taste I don't know how to describe. Because the chocolate was so rich, I could only taste a hint of espresso. I actually really liked it.   \n\nCoconut curry hot chocolate - the chocolate was too thick and I couldn't taste the difference of the coconut milk, but the curry gave it a little kick after each gulp which was interesting. I would choose the mocha over this though.\n\nPassion fruit caramel bon bon - it had a very strong passion fruit taste mixed with caramel inside a white chocolate shell\n\nBanana foster bon bon - is sorta like banana pudding inside a chocolate shell. I'd rather get an actual banana pudding.\n\nOverall, Chocolate at Cocoa Bella's a wee bit better and they have more selections to choose from.

Following is a piece by piece account of what I tried and my opinion of each.\n\nDark Milk (http://static4.px.yelp.com/bphoto/Ojhmf9f89KERQMWWIJ4IuQ/l) - Thin dark chocolate shell.  Firm, creamy and smooth dark milk chocolate center.  Delightful!\n\nFresh Lime (http://static2.px.yelp.com/bphoto/8EXd5zns-GIdNH3hEY1VcA/l) - It's a tasty piece of chocolate, but the lime flavoring just isn't there.  Flavored with fresh lime juice the thick, creamy ganache is wonderfully chocolatey, but offered nothing to please the lime lover in me.\n\nHazelnut (http://static2.px.yelp.com/bphoto/Wdglf08JuOoaj6vqGKRJjA/l) - The milk chocolate shell was creamy but what I like most was the gritty, slightly crunchy filling of crushed hazelnuts.\n\nJamaican Rum (http://static4.px.yelp.com/bphoto/i_jyzR3NhOldcHa2K1UqtQ/l) - White chocolate shell with a thick dark chocolate ganache flavored with Jamaican rum.  I didn't taste the rum.\n\nMint (http://static4.px.yelp.com/bphoto/4Ac-MENYV4ytQYhW-rbOAw/l) - I consider mint to be one of the most basic flavorings for chocolate, and I was really excited about this one until I bit into it.  This was a huge disappointment with not even enough mint flavoring to leave a cool taste in my mouth.\n\nPassion Fruit (http://static4.px.yelp.com/bphoto/eB1HYJJvSFnm926C7nDXeg/l) - The white chocolate shell was somewhat gritty, but the passion fruit laced caramel had good passion fruit flavor to it.\n\nRaspberry (http://static3.px.yelp.com/bphoto/ffmqh_27u3RdWHwcxsDDrg/l) - Thin dark chocolate shell with a dual layered filling of smooth dark chocolate ganache on top and what seemed to be a thin raspberry gelle on the bottom.  The raspberry flavoring wasn't as defined as I would have liked.\n\nSpiced Caramel (http://static2.px.yelp.com/bphoto/rhdCHRyLWkOM2Qr-cfG9Dg/l) - Outstanding center combines a bit of salted caramel mixed with chile and spice.

The thick dark chocolate shell actually ruined the overall presentation.\n\nStrawberry (http://static1.px.yelp.com/bphoto/blw4WCj6lOpwuuxeOMg8sg/l) - Similar to the Raspberry with a thin dark chocolate shell and a dual layered filling of smooth dark chocolate ganache on top and a strawberry gelle on the bottom.\n\nStrawberry-Balsamic Caramel (http://static2.px.yelp.com/bphoto/BSkedeKLgA7PQQn2VBiQcw/l) - The liquid center had a very good balsamic vinegar taste to it, but the strawberry flavoring was too subtle.  The outer shell is dark chocolate.\n\nVanilla Bean (http://static4.px.yelp.com/bphoto/7hJM0ecOAMQwLdycR_1gWg/l) - Dark milk chocolate outer shell with a liquid caramel center.  The vanilla flavor was there but very lightly.\n\nYuzu (http://static3.px.yelp.com/bphoto/vX6bQlR1nDFa30gMqF-zVw/l) - The thick, creamy ganache had a nice citrus flavoring that is comparable to the preserved citrus rinds often used in Asian cooking.

Having read about and seen the American born chef's work at such fine retailers as Dean&Deluca DC, Trotter's to Go Chicago, and Le Chocoholique right here in Columbus but having never decided to indulge previously I decided to stop in to browse and having experienced some of the better chocolates here in the United States as well as in Paris I can say without a doubt that I'm glad I made that decision.\n\nWith the store itself rather minimalist - tablets, bars, and cocoa powders on the wall with a case of truffles and chocolates at the room's center - I was greeted by a pair of young ladies while two couples sat in the small Jacques Genin-esque tasting room to the left chatting and enjoying their selections.  With ambient music playing overhead and the store quite serene I took my time making my decisions and while browsing was offered first a piece of the Dark Almond No 7 \"61% with ground roasted almonds\" bar and then a $2 \"Extra Dark - Bittersweet dark chocolate ganache\" - both intense, smooth, and with deep floral notes giving praise to the cocoa's Venezuelan roots.\n\nContinuing to browse as a pair of young ladies stopped in to pick up some pate a fruit and chocolates to go I eventually made my decisions - 4 chocolates and a \"liquid chocolate\" to be enjoyed while I flipped through my e-mail via the store's free wifi.  Beginning first with the chocolates my selections included Tupelo Honey, Bananas Foster, Port Wine and Fig, and Caramel Fleur de Sel - the first two part of the summer seasonal collection and the second pair part of Elbow's signature series - and each was wonderful, a perfect balance of the expected chocolate tones and the high quality ingredients contained within.  Difficult to decide which was my favorite I would lean largely to the boozy selections as the rum and the port both really highlighted the nuances of the chocolate while still allowing the fruits to shine.\n\nMoving on to the \"Liquid Chocolate\" described as Cocoa Noir 71% with milk (also available with water or as a white chocolate) with a thick spongy marshmallow on the side this $4.75 selection was equal to or better than the outstanding chocolates and with rich bitter notes punctuating the low cocoa tones the flavor reminded me very favorably (again) of Jacques Genin in Paris, though not quite as rich, creamy, and throat coating overall.  Comparable to the dark chocolate hot cocoa at Cambridge stalwart LA Burdick and vastly more dense and nuanced than the raved versions Recchiuti I'd strongly recommend giving it a try because whether native to the area or not San Francisco is lucky to have one of only two Elbow storefronts and the style, service, and quality are every bit worth the price.", "author": "Michael U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-03-24", "description": "Got a little bored today, so late afternoon, decided to take a little wander out of the Castro and ended up in Hayes Valley.  Of course, first stop was the Blue Bottle kiosk, where even though it was a standard cool windy SF day, I picked up a New Orleans iced...mmm, chicory and coffee.  Kept wandering around Hayes and passed Elbow's, which I have seen many times after dinners in the area, but when they've always been closed. Chocolate, coffee...are you thinking what I'm thinking?\n\nThe service: I didn't get quite the attitude that some of the other folks have received, but I didn't get quite the most responsive service either.  Sure, the girl was helpful in describing some of the chocolates in front of me, and offered up a sample of the butter pecan truffle, but despite mentioning that I was having coffee, and was contemplating what would go with it, I never got the suggestion of \"Oh, X pairs wonderfully with coffee.\"  I ended up having to make my own observation that most of the flavored truffles probably wouldn't go with the coffee, and I just got a non-committal stare.  Really?  C'mon, chocolate and coffee, this is one of the perfect pairings and one any good chocolatier would seize upon to at the very least upsell me on some psychotically expensive single-sourced dark.\n\nInstead, I found myself having to ask specifically about their plain chocolates, and was just told at most the percentage of cacao in each of them (because Madagascar 64% wasn't obviously 64% cacao...).  No description of flavor profile or anything like that.  In the end, thinking I'd want something to help balance the chicory of the coffee, I went with the Madagascar 64%, and picked up a milk chocolate hazelnut disc for later as well.\n\nI took my purchase and left, thinking that maybe I was getting attitude for bringing other food into the store, and sat down over on the Octavia median.  I will say, the truffle melted pretty well and was darn delicious with the coffee - and as I predicted, the extra milk helped balance the bitter of the chicory and highlighted some of the bright notes in the coffee, while the darker tones of chocolate stood out to me.\n\nI just devoured the hazelnut disc, which was also pretty delicious, with little flecks of crunchiness in the truffle.  One thing I noticed with both chocolates though was that the exterior enrobing chocolate doesn't really like to melt in the mouth.  WIth the Madagascar, I assumed it was a combination of being a cool windy day and a cooler mouth due to the iced coffee, but I noticed the same with the hazelnut.  I know that the darker and more pure cacao a chocolate is, the less it will melt as opposed to dissolve, but I would hope that the milk at least would do so.  Not quite so much.\n\nSo ultimately, the chocolates themselves get a 4.5, while the lackluster (but at least not downright rude) service gets a 2 in my book.  I think 3 stars is a pretty decent compromise.  If you're going to sell me fancy $2-a-pop one-bite truffles, at least be willing to know and react to what people are eating/drinking/asking for.", "author": "Mark C."}

I think the Midwest gets a bad rap sometimes.\n\nA visit to Christopher Elbow Chocolates is like going to the jewelry store. The chocolates are glossy and enticing, laid out like gold. I sampled the Venezuelan Spice and not only was it delicious, it was beautiful! I bought my friend some chocolate. She only wanted one piece but one chocolate is sad, so I bought her two. I'm a big spender. I also treated to a round of liquid chocolate. To my surprise, the hot chocolate wasn't as thick as i thought it was going to be. It was drinkable.\n\nI chose the coconut curry hot chocolate. It was amazing like a trip to the Far East. It definitely smells like curry and is even sprinkled with curry powder on the top. I was a little afraid of my first sip but the smell and taste actually worked itself out. The smell is pungent and the taste is earthy and divine. I think the coconut milk has something to do with it. It's richer than whole milk. Anyhows, it was a five star drink. My only complaint was that it could have been served in a nicer cup. The paper cup cheapened the drink. In any case, whatever variation of hot chocolate you order, it is made with more care than any world class cup of java.\n\nThe seating area is amazing.

These designer chocolates are so effen good that it will make every one of your senses tingle.\n\nI've passed by CEAC many times while having lunch in Hayes Valley and it wasn't until yesterday did I finally pay a visit.\n\nUpon entering, my eyes were fixated at the glass cases filled with miniature pieces of chocolate art and my head became discombobulated on what to choose. I opted to get a 9-piece box and choose the following:\n\n*Champagne: An alcoholic's delight; rich and smooth w/ a velvety ganache center and a prominent Champagne flavor. \n\n*Fleur De Sel: OMG--YUM! When you bite into it, the caramel flows like hot lava on to your tongue and melts into your taste buds. The sea salt highlights the caramel flavor and leaves an ever so light salt flavor on your palette. \n\n*Hazelnut: Heavenly! The hazelnut ganache is velvety smooth w/ hazelnut tibits for a slight crunch. Sorry, Ferrero Rocher, CEAC has you beat!\n\n*Cappuccino: A dessert perfectly matched for a coffee addict. The cappuccino chocolate has a light, airy, and smooth ganache center w/ a strong espresso bite to it. \n\n*Wildflower Honey: OMG, how is it possible that something can change flavors? Upon biting into the Wildflower Honey, you can taste the strong honey smell and as it melts in your mouth, the \"honey\" transforms to a creamy sweet caramel taste. DELISH!\n\n*Ghana: For dark chocolate fans; the Ghana is rich, velvety, w/ a slightly bitter after taste. \n\n*Macadamia Praline: YUMMY! The caramelized macadamia nuts are blended w/ silky chocolate ganache for a perfect blend of sweet, nutty, and buttery taste.\n\n*Venezuelan Spice: MUY CALIENTE! At first, the Venezuelan Spice taste like the regular CEAC ganache; rich and velvety, however as it melts away you can feel the spice catch up to you as it leaves a fiery kick on your palette. \n\n*Dulce De Leche: Creamy, milky, and sweet. If you like flan or are a Vietnamese ice coffee fan, you will like the Dulce De Leche as has a taste very similar to condensed milk.\n\nAlthough CEAC has about 25 different flavors to choose from, each with its own unique flavor profile and taste, the quality for each is very consistent. Whether the star ingredient is champagne, honey, chili, or a nut, its taste is prominent and shines through the velvety sweetness of the chocolate ganache w/o overpowering it. CE definitely did a superb job of matching chocolate with different ingredients that work in harmony with one another. \n\nThe chocolates are beautifully boxed and a picture brochure is included so you can differentiate one chocolate from another. \n\nCEAC are a bit pricey at about $2/piece, but are worth every penny considering the quality and care it took to make these exquisite culinary miniature delights. \n\nWe all know all the money in the world can't solve our problems, but chocolate can (well, at least in my book it can). So, if you're in the doghouse, do yourself a favor and pick up a box of CEAC for your significant other b/c nothing says \"I Love You\" more than a mouthful of cavities. \n\nAnd, to the men who need a helping hand w/ their women *AHEM*, bring your lovely lady some CEAC and problem SOLVED!

My friend and I came in around closing time and there was no one else in there. They have a nice selection of hot chocolates to try. My friend opted for their original hot dark chocolate while I decided to try their coconut milk curry spice hot chocolate. The interior of the shop is so clean and the display of chocolates is so seductive, but they're $2 a piece.\n\nAll of their hot chocolates are priced at $4.50 which is kind of expensive for me, but totally worth it. My coconut milk curry spice hot chocolate was so good, I've never experienced these flavors together before, but it was awesome. It was like the curry flavor hits your taste buds first, then it's followed with a deep dark chocolate that is just delicious. My friend really enjoyed her hot chocolate as well and we had the chance to just chill inside their store for a little bit even though it was past closing time.\n\nWe had a good experience with the workers; they didn't rush us at all and were very hospitable.

Its on a busy corner so walk there. \n\nThey have a great lounge so you can sip your chocolate and read a novel, catch up on your newspaper or just sit and watch the world go by. Its a peaceful respite in that bustling 'hood. It'd be a great place for part of a date: different, romantic and somewhat reassuring.\n\nAmanda is a great lady behind the counter and makes learning about chocolate a ton of fun. They even have a discount card. \n\nIf you want to impress someone in love, business or for Mother's Day, get Elbow Chocolates. The boxes are as artfully prepared as the chocolates. There is so much old world care & beauty mixed with nouveau charm its an intoxicating mix.\n\nAfter working in the area for most of 2015, they came to know me by name and, were even kind enough to make me a sipping chocolate to purchase and pick up! I just had to call ahead. What great old fashioned service!!! I'd be running late to work and would zip in, pay and waltz off with my cup of energy in hand. Marvelous! \n\nAnd, if you want to pay it forward, and sneak to pay for someone else to surprise them and make their day, they will do it. Its fun to treat total strangers who will never know you and make life sweeter for them. Christopher Elbow chocolates make the world a better place.", "author": "F M."}

I think we paid about $15 for the six of them, which sounds like a lot, but really, if you knew how big they were, you wouldn't think the price was that bad. Loved the caramel and nuts but what really did these turtles an honor was the sprinkling of sea salt on the top that really contrasted nicely with the chocolate and caramel (and I'm not usually a sea-salt caramel top of gal; I don't love it when it's heavy handed.) \nIf I was back in the area I'd go again to grab a box of these for a special occasion.", "author": "Rachel B."}

He still has to compete with my Swiss chocolate taste which I acquired from birth living near Switzerland.\nForget about the paintbrush markings. Personally I find those rather distracting from the taste of the chocolate. [Think about it. Most wine bottles and wine stickers are very low profile.]\nI tried all of their confections and they pack it in a nice box. This is good to very good chocolate. \nThe only two objections I have is that it doesn't fully cater to my taste and what I am used to but they are also too creamy. Personally I find a creamy quality as sign of pretense, just like the airbrush painting. It takes away from the real taste of the chocolate ganash and find flavors. Creamy is like flushing it all down at once. It's like a small fireworks but too much to take it all on at once. So what is left is the last color/taste you have experienced. The best of chocolates I can keep in my mouth for 1-2min and each second a different flavor develops and plays with different previous flavors. CE makes very good chocolate.

Now, that's some fun chocolate.\n\nChristopher Elbow is the newest purveyor of handmade, artisinal chocolates to grace our city of chocolate-lovers.  In the space formerly known as \"Friend\", the modern aesthetic has been preserved and freshly appointed in deep red, bright white, and, of course, dark chocolate brown.   I don't know if it's because of the company's Midwestern roots, but the environment feels very laid-back and grounded, which is not always the case in similar high-end stores.\n\nThe corner location works well for the set up of a pristine chocolate counter, with an ever-so-clean display of the chocolates.  It's extremely easy to shop, whether you just want a few morsels or a gift box.  There is also a wall filled with chocolate bars and other products like pate de fruit.\n\nThe flavors are interesting and tempting, from the comforting (bananas foster) to the exotic (strawberry balsamic caramel).  Someone in the kitchen definitely has an appreciate for alcohol (someone after my own heart, clearly), as there are confections which contain everything from wine to scotch to absinthe.   Colors and shapes are artistic and interesting - I especially liked the jewel tones of the lavender caramel and absinthe chocolates.  If you like fleur de sel, you can find it on turtles and in caramels.\n\nThey also offer drinkable chocolate, in an impressive variety of flavors.  And one thing that really sets them apart from other chocolatiers is that they have a chocolate lounge - so that you can take a seat, flip through a magazine, and sip or eat your chocolate in a relaxed environment.  \n\nI indulged in a cup of hot chocolate with passion fruit - so rich, so creamy with just a hint of passion fruit flavor - it was silky and delicious, and if I had to make any improvement, I would add more passion fruit for an even stronger bite.\n\nEach of the chocolates I have tried so far has been delicious - Fresh Lime, Strawberry Balsamic Caramel, and Macadamia (I think) with Pop Rocks.  I love their tiny size and concentration of flavors.  \n\nBe sure to stop by Christopher Elbow next time you are in Hayes Valley - and for you chocolate connoisseurs, it is worth a special trip.

I've become cynical about things named \"Artisanal,\" it's often code word for expensive crap, but this place makes Artisanal proud. The chocolates are like jewels, it's hard to eat them because they are mini-artworks. I tried the Venezuelan chocolate, it was rich and satisfying. Got the turtles to bring home, the Venezuelan had a delicate cinnamon flavor, the Fleur de sel was perfection, the caramel was so rich and had just the right amount of salt. I also got a caramel with salt individual chocolate, which melted in my mouth and left me wanting more. It's expensive, but the product is worth it, the quality is outstanding.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-11-21", "description": "I live in Hayes Valley and to me, chocolate falls into the \"major food group\" just like veggies and fruits.  Money is no object when it comes to chocolate -- I take it very seriously.  So when Christopher Elbow moved into my neighborhood, I was more that thrilled.  This review will be based solely on their chocolate creations.  I have not yet tried their chocolate drinks (no particular reason, I just haven't done it yet).\n\nThey have a fairly large selection of beautifully designed creations, each one is a piece of art in and of itself. There's no question that each piece has been meticulously conceptualized and artfully executed.  I'm a marzipan lover but the only thing close to marzipan that he has is the Maple Walnut piece which was delicious -- except all I could taste was the maple -- it overpowered the walnut flavor.  The champagne piece is delightfully designed and quite tasty.  The Rosemary Carmel was delicious also but I could only taste the Carmel and it only barely hinted at Rosemary.  The Vanilla Cognac was also really really good.  The Dark Chocolate Madagascar was sinfully delicious.  \n\nThe current menu at Christopher Elbow has about 2 dozen different creations.  Seven of these are caramel based which to me creates an imbalance in their otherwise unique and tasty inventory.  I love a good caramel but with almost one-third of the choices being caramel based, it's a little limiting IMHO.  It is nice that they have a seating area where you can sit and enjoy your purchases right then and there -- which, if you're like me, I would do.\n\nThe products are great to give for any occasion -- packaging and presentation are all beautiful and elegant.  The gift of a box of Christopher Elbow chocolates immediately announces that you paid through the nose for these chocolates.  \n\nMy critical chocolate loving palate has a couple of complaints but keep in mind that everyone has their own tastes and to enjoy these chocolates requires a fairly sophisticated palate.  I eat a lot of chocolate.  I keep my cardiologist in business because of my love of chocolate.  A few cons:  As earlier mentioned, too many caramel based items; some of the pieces are waaaay to sweet -- so sweet in fact that in some cases you can't even taste anything except sweet.  There are better chocolates in town that are just as good or better but aren't quite as pricey as Christopher Elbow.  Although money is no object for me when it comes to chocolate, I do believe that there is such a thing as \"overpriced chocolate.\"  I don't want to give the impression that these creations are anything other than top of the line excellent but...too sweet can be a deal killer in my book.  They have some really nicely packaged gifty kinds of things (see my pics) too which would make really nice gifts.\n\nWhen Christopher Elbow first opened shop, service was rude, inefficient and made me feel totally unwelcome.  Thankfully, this attitude has changed and the staff is now much nicer and much friendlier although I still get a sense of snobbery going on behind the counter.  To me that's a HUGE turn off, even if it is for chocolate.  The Cocoa Bella store in the Westfield Shopping Center downtown also carries Christopher Elbow chocolates, so if you don't come out to Hayes Valley, you can go to the mall instead.  \n\nDon't give these to anyone who eats Hershey Kisses, M&Ms or Dove bars. Just don't.\n\nI want to give 5 stars but the fact that there are too many caramel pieces, too many overly sweet things and the snobbery thing going on, I'm afraid I can only give 3 stars.", "author": "Paul N."}

Christopher Elbow also sells their chocolate confections through numerous other retailers nationwide. Since the quantity of resellers vastly outnumbers the boutiques run by Christopher Elbow, the focus of the business may be on a mass distribution of a high end chocolate to retailers rather than making an outstanding experience for the customer.\n\nAt the entrance of the store, individual truffles form an inviting field of colors and shapes like gems under glass. The colorful candies come in traditional hazelnut, trendy flavors like carmel with salt, and unique products like the Yuzu with Japanese citrus. On my visits, the store always had a wide variety of truffles in stock.  \n\nThe drinking chocolate has a technically well executed taste. Smooth, not bitter, consistent, easy to drink. Unfortunately, it also lacks complexity. That's not to say that it's bad, I just felt surprised by the simplicity. It has no citrus finish, no hints of coffee, no earthiness. I expect more from my chocolate. \n\nThe bar of 70% chocolate tastes like the solid form of the drinking chocolate. It may be that the base chocolate is the same for the drinking chocolate, the truffles, and actually very simple in flavor. That works well when chocolate is the base for serving other flavors, but less interesting when wanting to really taste chocolate for its own unique qualities.  \n\nThe boutique has clean lines, polished glass, and white surfaces. The store also includes an LCD monitor flashing the current information about various products. This modern approach to the store manages to give it a slick appearance and at the same time manages to lack sophistication, subtle, and nuance.\n\nThe staff had the nearly ever present disaffected San Francisco attitude.

It comes down to personal preference.  Ok, enough babble about that, lets go on to rating the chocolate!\n\nEver watch Spongebob Squarepants?  Ok, indulge me here just for a minute or skip over if you have no idea who Spongebob is.  \n\nIn one episode Spongebob and Patrick want to be entrepreneurs.  In their quest for this high living they decide to sell.....yes you guessed it (or saw the episode) chocolate!   One of the first customers they try to entice with a  velvety smooth chocolate bar gets a glazed looked in his eyes (not hard for a fish) and gets to screaming \"CHOCOLATE!\"  While trying to catch Spongebob and Patrick.\n\nWell the point of that is, Christopher Elbow Chocolates put me in the same state of mind!  \n\nWith over 50+ years of sampling chocolate for me, CB chocolate is simply heaven and dare I say it, orgasmic?  Might as well, Spongebob sure can't say that :)\n\nSome don't care for the exotic flavors or think that a Rosemary flavor center is not suitable for a chocolate.  Personal preference once again comes into play here.  Personally I adored every flavor with the exception being Marzipan however I always preferred Marzipan without chocolate.\n\nThe chocolates (in case you don't know) are not made with any preservatives or additives (another plus)!  So these are best consumed within a two week period.  I can't see these lasting anyone a week let alone two :)\n\nThe dark and milk chocolate is just exceptional!  A thin chocolate shell with the right amount of snap to it.  A lot of the centers are liquid which is just phenomenal to my taste buds!  I love liquid centers.  The favorites so far are: (not in order of preference)\n\nChampagne\nVanilla Bean\nVenezuelan Spiced Caramel (I could eat an entire box of these alone)\nCaramel with Fleur de Sel (Can I just order a full pound of one flavor?)\nCabernet Caramel\nLavender Caramel\nRosemary Caramel\nBananas Foster (again lets order a full pound of this)!\nGrand Marnier\nCitrus Caramel\nYuzu\n\nI order  these three to four times a year online in the 21 piece collection (glad there isn't a CE locally, really I could not control myself if there was).  When I order them I always get a box of them for Mom.  Mom has been a chocoholic for 88 years so I know where I inherited that trait :)\n\nMom and I sit and open the leaflet and decide which flavors to try first and marvel at the artistry of each piece.  Mom confesses, they are without a doubt the best she has ever had and won't even give in to buying her old time favorite, Helen Grace (no comparison of course,  it would be like comparing apples to oranges).\n\nSo Mom waits ever so patiently for the times during the year that I order her a box, Christmas is coming soon Mom :)\n\nPrice, ok.... yes very expensive!  Worth it?  To me yes they are worth it and my Mom also agrees.  Course she says I should not be spending my money on her but sure won't refuse that box of Christopher Elbow chocolates.  Every time I hand her a box her eyes light up and she asks....\"Is this that Chocolate you bought me before?\"\n\nYes Mom, there is a Santa Claus!", "author": "R W."}

Location.  \n\nI walk in, after my lovely haircut appointment, because I am a sucker for jewels... well, not REAL jewels, but jewel-shaped CHOCOLATES!   Chocolatiers are becoming smart... looking into the psychology of chocolate marketing: 1) find who the most avid consumers of chocolates (women); 2) find out how to market chocolates to avid consumers by looking at packaging and presentation (make chocolates look like jewels and put them in jewelry boxes, tie with fancy ribbon).\n\nThese *sosyal* establishments looked too rich for my blood, and it kinda was (2 pieces, 1-inch in diameter, for $5; 9 pcs for a dub, a small 8oz cup of hot cocoa for $4.50... wow! ang mahal!)... but I had to at least TRY IT before I knocked it.  \n\nThe chocolates are all laid out on a counter (which is probably marble of some sort to keep the chocolates intact) looking like polished JEWELS!  Oh I LOVE IT.  It's a way to this girl's heart.   They also taste gloriously wonderful and sinful at the same time.  The chocolates are mostly dark, encasing some flavored caramel.  I got 9 different ones to share with my dinner party later in the evening.\n\nOn the other side of the establishment are lounge chairs with mini counters. While the layout and design of this lounge area (and the cool bathroom sink) are nice, i think it's a waste of space, but justifies the exorbitant prices of the goods.  Okay, I'm an asshole for saying that... this feature is somewhat nice if you just want to take a small pause in your hectic, fast-paced life to enjoy the traffic in front of you, while you sip your hot cocoa (and you HAVE TO SIP IT because it is very richly sweet and hecka mad expensive to just slam it... so yeah... slow.down.turbo! sip it. just. sip it.) and nibble (savor it please) on your fancy chocolates.  They have newspaper racks on the side too.... suggesting, \"hey! you may as well take a paper and relax!\" says Frankie.  I thought it was quaint that there is a copy of The Onion hanging on one of the dowels. \n\nSo far I had the strawberry balsamic one and the absinthe caramel (very \"absinthe-y\" flavor according to salty balls).  Sweet enjoyed the orange blossom honey caramel.  Salty popped the bananas foster in his mouth, as if it's a mere peanut m&m.

Guapo had the passion fruit caramel, because he's full of passion, ladies.  Husky  opted not to have any because she just doesn't like chocolates at all, but supposedly makes \"panty-dropping\" carbonara, fellas.\n\nCall me anal-retentive, but I really scrutinize how the customer service reps handle the chocolates (edible consumer item) while also trying to package the goods and ring up the customer's wares.  They do wear those latex gloves in one hand to pick up the chocolates, but still somewhat touch the chocolates while putting it in the box.  Now, what is the point of wearing a glove in one hand when you're still going to touch the chocolate with your other naked hand?

I'll pass.\n\n::HOT COCOA::\nAnother place that tries to administer so much chocolate power that it becomes more about the power of the chocolate than having a proper balance with the milk.  Not a fan of this method.  Still, lots of interesting flavors to try.\n\nHad a few of the funky ones (not the 5 spice, need to try that) and they were okay.  Again, not a great balance with the milk, and flavors are interesting, but more \"interesting\" than tasty.  \n\nPEPPERMINT\nIt's a regular one with about 5 sprinkles of peppermint on the top.  Hence, two sips later, it's just  a regular hot cocoa.  Uhhh... hello?  What are they thinking?\n\nWHIP\nThey use real whip in the cocoa!  Meaning, they whip it in the shop (no can action).  Doesn't look like top quality creme... maybe it is, but it didn't appear to be.  Still, beats canned by a mile.  \n\nTAKE HOME COCOA\nThis allows you to do a proper milk to cocoa ratio.  Still, wasn't terribly excited about this cocoa.  Haven't wanted to go back to buy more.\n\n::BARS::\nHad a funky bar (can't recall) that was pretty good.  Again, wasn't feeling like I wanted to go back for more.  There are a few I might pick up in the future... ?\n\n::STAFF::\nSame guy at the counter the last two times I went.

My BFF, who is doing the low carb thing, bought the praline pop rock candy bar, saying she'd eat it after said diet was over.  Which initiated the following conversation:\nFriend 1:  So are you going to eat your chocolates on the way home?\nFriend 2:  No, I'll just eat them tomorrow.  I don't want to eat them in front of you, since you can't eat yours now.\nFriend 1:  Well, you can eat them while I drive and describe each taste in detail.  \nFriend 2:  Isn't that kind of like asking someone if you can watch them masturbate?\n(Thoughtful pause.)\nFriend 1:  No, it's absolutely nothing like that.  \nFriend 2:  You're right, I can't believe i just said that.  \n\nWhen i did eat the chocolates, yes alone, they were quite good, though a tiny bit sweet for my taste.  The fleur de sel turtle was my favorite.  So, while I'm still a #1 Recchuitti fan, C. Elbow chocolates are especially beautiful and they offer a plethora of interesting flavor combinations.

The Pieces in there are gorgeous, they almost look like little plastic replicas of chocolate pieces with the whimsical designs stamped on them and all.\n\nPrices are very high, on the order of $2 for a 1\" square of chocolate-y goodness.\n\nChocolate was tasty enough, but probably not up to what I was hoping for considering the price.  I guess one must always consider the cost of the LOOK of these chocolates, since they do look stunning.\n\nWord of warning, when I went, which was the first day they were open, the attendants behind the counter didn't seem to know anything about the chocolates besides what they had read from their cheat sheets.  They could offer few to no opinions, and at those prices, I expect them to act like a fine sommelier and convert my sugar induced rantings into a proper selection.\n\nAh well, hopefully they'll improve as time goes by...looks like a great place to buy a Valentine's Day gift though.", "author": "Eric M."}

After a lovely brunch at Absinthe, I stumbled upon Christopher Elbow's which was kiddie corner from the restaurant. This shop has been on my bookmark list for at least a year and even though it was 90 degrees out in SF and the lifespan of my chocolate would be at risk, I decided to check it out anyway. \n\nChocolates are a crazy world of their own these days and it never ceases to amaze me to see what exotic flavors chocolatiers come up with next. This shop was no exception and carried an unimaginable collection of flavored caramels that included Passion Fruit, Rosemary, and Strawberry Balsamic. In addition to the above, I tried the Banana Curry chocolate. Overall, the texture of the chocolate is its strongest trait. All the pieces, as well as the bars are super smooth and have quite a luxurious texture that all chocolate should strive to have. They are the true definition of melt in your mouth. Flavor wise, I thought the variety was good, but I think I might have appreciated less of a caramel selection in the case. The caramel was delicious, but seemed to mask over the fruit/herb/spirit flavors that I wish would have come through more.", "author": "Christina N."}

The shop was empty while I sat in the lounge area and I could hear the two counter people playing I Spy (\"aww, you're cheating!\" \"no, i'm not!\" \"you said it would be in the shop!\" \"it is!\"). It was the cutest thing EVER! \n\nI think sometimes gourmet shops get bad raps for having snooty or indifferent customer service...but this is definitely not the case here. They were helpful and the shop girl happily answered a customer's questions about Christopher Elbow (where the main store is located, where the chocolates are made, when they opened etc.) \n\nI bought four chocolates:\n\n- strawberry balsamic caramel (yummiest)\n- rosemary caramel (yummy...boyfriend was partial to this one)\n- absinthe caramel (too strong a flavor for me...I'm a wuss)\n- peanut butter with pop rocks (makes me feel like a kid again)\n\nI normally prefer bars to filled/flavored confections but it's always a treat to buy a few to savor every once in a while. I highly recommend the strawberry balsamic (not really a strange combination...try Bi-Rite's strawberry balsamic ice cream for more of this flavor EXPLOSION)\n\nAs for the hot chocolates ($4.50), they have 14 flavors to choose from! I decided to have the european style (dark chocolate with water) and my boyfriend chose the coconut curry (dark chocolate, coconut milk, and curry powder). \n\nBoth were piping hot, rich and extremely creamy. (The dark chocolate flavor comes through better with water, IMO.) Though the with milk version must be even more decadent. The coconut curry tasted like a chocolate curry with a hint of spice. Very, very rich. I would like to try the hazelnut next time.\n\nGive CE a try if you're in the neighborhood! You'll feel happy after. :)", "author": "Nathalie L."}

My close friends' two cats passed away recently and they are having a hard time. This btw is one of the reasons I'm afraid of getting pets myself, even though my apartment has a policy almost as liberal as the Zoo when it comes to keeping them.\n\nIn any case, notable Yelper Liz S. http://lizs.yelp.com has been going on a chocolate tour d'excellence lately and because of her advice when I found myself fortuitously in Hayes valley I dropped in.\n\nSomething in me changed over the past couple of years when my brain became a little more insane, and the notion of paying over two dollars for a truffle became reasonable. This temporary cocoa crazy can be the only possible explanation of why Teuscher gets so much of my greenback.\n\nWe opted to compose a 16 piece giftbox mixing in the poprocks infused pecan, wacky but intriguing strawberry balsamic and a host of other delicately painted truffles that I would never get to taste - because it was a gift.\n\nMy girlfriend and I did however get to taste, in my opinion, the litmus test of all fine chocolatiers - the champagne truffle. Overall there were a couple of problems with it - the outer shell was too dense, almost waxy. It needed to be broken down by chewing rather than the heat of your mouth. The creme interior was rich and delicious, but was made like a sloppy yet chummy bartender - too much booze. I also was unsure why the outer service was so bumpy, I like my truffles smooth and sexy. To its credit the finish and after taste was long and luxurious. \n\nI'll let you know later if my friends enjoyed them and it made them feel better. One other note: Elbow chocolates have been sold for a while in SF at Cocoa Bella. They are flown in from Elbow's factory/store in Kansas. Apparently the SF store, which just opened, is a test before opening other stores in the US.\n\n*chocolate isn't the only cure, we got them some Cowgirl Creamery cheese as well. http://www.yelp.com/biz/cowgirl-creamery-artisan-cheese-san-francisco#hrid:uIJEO8_SrLjSOKItCfg7XQ\n\n3.75 * stars", "author": "Brady K."}

But then again I think Mr. Elbow does the world a favor by slowing it down and easing us back into a leisurely MO.  There is some fine craftmanship here and the subtle inflections of flavor and texture on the palette deserve no less than reflective consumption.\n\nNow when you walk in if you are nervous and end up being intimidated by what you see or just have sticker shock, then buy a $4-5 pre-made Pop Rocks chocolate bar, head round the corner to Blue Bottle Coffee for an espresso, then hit the Octavia park and bask in the sun with your li'l treasures.

So over the $7 single origin bars with a hint of secret Venezuelan spice.  Not feeling the \"drinking chocolate.\"  Skeptical of the undeniably gorgeous truffles and caramels artfully arranged in the pristine glass case in front of me.  \"Yet another artisan chocolatier charging $2 for a one-inch square of rosemary infused caramel?\" I wanted to say.  \n\nBut despite my worst instincts (and clearly I was unusually crankypants to be unmoved by chocolate) I was won over.  First of all, the two guys -- bearded, hip, and a little earnest -- were not only friendly and eager to make suggestions, they really knew their chocolate.  Second, the chocolate was really, really good.  By the time I left, I'd tried a venezuelan chocolate truffle (lightly spiced, with a lingering slight smoky burn), some insanely delicate and subtly moving tea infused thing, and an absolutely amazing chocolate turtle dusted with salt.  Amazing.  I went from being a hater to being a winner.  I bought the $32 assortment and was scarcely deterred by the fact that I couldn't select my own chocolate for the box.  \"We select the chocolates and assemble these each morning,\" said my bearded NBF.  \"You picked out the chocolates?\" I asked.  \"I totally trust you.  I'll take it.\"\n\nThe one slight (slight!) disappointment was the drinking chocolate.  Having just returned from Paris where I had savored the absinthe of hot chocolates, this was a little bit thin and forgettable.  But still delicious.  I will be back, this time for the $7 chocolate bar.", "author": "Kathleen G."}

The fancy chocolates looked so amazing under the glass case and I didn't want to just look, I wanted to taste dammit!  The guy in front of me picked out four that were put in a pretty little box with a bow and was charged ten dollars.  So I thought I'd do the same so I picked out four, Passion Fruit, Bananas Foster, Lime and Cabernet Caramel.  I was only charged eight dollars because I opted for a cellophane bag instead of a fancy box.  The Passion Fruit was my favorite, white chocolate painted pink with a soft-liquidy center.  I loved the lime as well - more of a solid yet decadent chocolate with a hint of lime after it's been in your mouth after a few moments - what a nice surpise because I expected to tase lime and it came after all, like a drink that hits you after.  The others were good but I ate them too fast (in the theater) because the show was about to start so I didn't savor them.

Read about this gem in a \"The Top 3 Hot Cocoas in SF\" article, and it definitely deserved its spot on that list! It's more of a chocolate shop/boutique (duh, it's a Chocolatier--but thought I'd throw that out there). They have a long L shaped booth separated by cubes that serve as both arm rests and side tables, but it has a more of a modern rather than cozy feel. Although I personally prefer a cozier atmosphere, the layout of the place was very \"sexy\" (yes, sexy chocolate), trendy, and cool. Definitely a unique experience. The chocolates themselves are adorable (e.g., they had pumpkin flavored and SHAPED chocolates), and the PEANUT BUTTER HOT COCOA I had was AMAZEballs. CREAMY, RICH, THICK hot cocoa with a large square marshmallow floating atop. lskdfjskdf. Drooling on my keyboard. They also had other interesting flavors like the Venezuelan Chocolate (if you don't like mixing spicy w/sweet, I wouldn't recommend it. But I tried a sip of my friends and enjoyed it). Pretty pricey for hot cocoa at $4.50/cup, but I'd highly recommend this place if you want a special cup of cocoa. =)", "author": "Diane G."}

The flavor was overly acidic (cheap balsamic) with almost no depth of flavor.\n\nThe banana foster tasted like a bad version (if possible) of one of those radioactive looking, styrofoam feeling Brach's circus peanut candies. The finish was of cheap, harsh rum.\n\nThe rosemary was over-extracted and just tasted bitter, bitter, bitter. At this point I started wondering, \"why all the caramel, because it is cheaper than ganache?\"\n\nI tried several other pieces as well, that peanut butter pop rocks thing, just a bad version of Oriol Balaguer's hazelnut pop rocks thing, not the least bit creative or avant garde.

I've made them and compared side by side with William Sonoma's fancy drinking chocolate, and hands down no competition, Christopher Elbow's hot chocolate wins, and warms my heart.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nthe pieces of chocolates themselves are small - a perfect mouthful in my opinion. you can taste all the combination of ingredients in it. i've had\n\nthe Banana Curry\nthe Yuzu\nthe Pineapple\nthe Strawberry-Balsamic Caramel\nthe Venezuelan Spice\nthe Vanilla Bean. \n\nBy the staff's recommendation, i've also had the Tanzanie and Venezuelan Dark side by side as comparison... they were both dark chocolates, but the origin really does affect the taste - the Venezuelan Dark is smooth, slightly toasty flavor, the Tanzanie is very fruity and a more raw edgy flavor.\n\nthey also have comfy leather seating on the side of the store for hanging out when you enjoy the hot chocolate - excellent for people watching as the traffic crosses in front of you in Hayes Valley. they never hurry to get you out of there or pressure you to buy anything - bonus points!\n\ni am glad to be living 50+ miles away from this place or else i'd be a big fat cow having this much chocolate... this place is such a treat, and it's made it on my list of 'must visit' when friends come into town. did i mention i absolutely love this place? :)\n\n \"you had me at chocolate...\"", "author": "amy c."}

It was a very thoughtful gift as I do love chocolate. \n\nAesthetically, the chocolate is beautiful. The pieces are impossibly smooth and shiny and decorated with intricate patterns. You can tell a lot of thought goes into each type and I was very impressed. \n\nAnd then I tasted a piece.....SOUR. The chocolate was sour. I hate hate hate sour chocolate. I tried other pieces and 6 of the 9 had a distinct sour taste in the chocolate. It was very disappointing. \n\nWith the fillings, Christopher Elbow will definitely give you flavors you have never experienced in chocolate before. Rosemary, bananas foster, cabernet, are just some of the flavors encapsulated in these chocolates. I will give them credit; the flavors did accurately match their descriptions (i.e. the bananas foster flavor really did taste like bananas foster.) So while flavor fidelity is nice, it can be distracting. Frankly, many of these flavors just do not play well with chocolate and should stay in their own neighborhoods. As I tasted them all, I found that several of the combinations just had no reason to exist. Just because you can make chocolate taste like locally grown rosemary does not mean you should.\n\nChristopher Elbow likens itself as a chocolate artist. Unfortunately, like many artists, they get enamored with their materials and talents and forget their audience. So, rather than creating universally revered masterpieces, their work is rather masturbatory.", "author": "Matthew C."}

I kept avoiding going into Christopher Elbow for that very reason- the space is very wide-open and I couldn't hide behind a display anywhere while I browsed their wares.  So I've got issues, but I finally decided to go in because I just couldn't resist the lure of their chocolates anymore.\n\nLike a lot of the artisanal, high-end chocolate stores through San Francisco, all their chocolates are displayed on a pristine white table behind glass, like little pieces of edible art.  I liked that they have samples- in this case, I think it was the Venezuelan spice.  They were generous in their sample too- half a truffle, rather than a measly quarter.  That allowed you to get a nice mouthful of chocolate and to get a great sense of the actual taste and texture.  I've never particularly liked spice in my chocolate, but this truffle wasn't bad- there was a low level of heat at the back of the throat once you finished the chocolate but it wasn't too intense.  After that taste, I decided I'd try some of their other chcoolates.  The first chocolates that caught my eye were the fresh lime, which sounded interesting, and the yuzu, which sounded even more interesting.  I decided to go with the yuzu and also the Hawaiian macadamia with sea salt, which the salesperson said was the staff favorite.  Both were amazing!  I really wished I had got more, but at $2 a pop, I couldn't afford to try each and every last one.\n\nI also saw that they have a dark chocolate drinking menu as I was paying for my chocolates.  It was too warm an afternoon to indulge, but many of the items sounds really interesting.  Chinese 5 spice and chocolate?  Sounds a little odd, but the salesperson assured me that it was actually good.  It looks like I'll have to make another trip back to Christopher Elbow and try their drinking chocolates when the weather cools a bit!", "author": "Angela H."}

And I especially love wacky chocolate creations, which there certainly not a shortage of at Christopher Elbow. This trendy new chocolate bar fits perfectly into the Hayes Valley culture- where particularly well crafted and expensive food seems to rule.  The space is quite large, for a chocolate bar, in addition to the room with a huge counter holding the myriad chocolate gems, there is a lounge area where you can sit and sip their specialty hot chocolates. It is a given that I will come back to sample the hot chocolates, but for the time being, I am can only review the chocolates which were actually given out as samples for free! Russian tea and the Ecuador were among the sampling varieties. Not only did they look gorgeous (finely painted designs decorated these beauties) but the taste was exotic and sophisticated. I didn't actually purchase anything here, but flavors I will try in the future include the passionfruit, lime, Vietnamese cinnamon, and Venezuelen spice (with chili). Yes, I am in love with this place, and it is probably a good thing that I don't live nearby, otherwise I would be here every day.", "author": "Kate A."}

I prettyy much like all of their chocolates, but the standout is the rosemary caramel, which is almost as good as Christopher Michaels in Newport beach, down south. I have always order my chocolates via their online store, but stopped by their San Fran shop and picked up some Chocolates & liquid chocolate. I do have one complaint though. Their hot chocolate was not warn enough and was kind of gritty. The hot chocolate aside, I really enjoy these chocolates.", "author": "john s."}

Not only will it be hard to find this type of selection elsewhere, but what other chocolate store serves up espresso and has an area to lounge? Okay, maybe there is another and I don't know about it. But if there is another, I doubt it's gonna be cheaper, most chocolate stores are the size of the counter and then you are enjoying your chocolate on the street or have to wait to get home.", "author": "Lex m."}
