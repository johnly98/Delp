I was not ordering a sandwich or slicing, so apparently they have no process for ringing you up if you just buy something from the case. No one at the register, no numbers. They just ignore you while they argue with the customers ordering sandwiches.\n\n I've had bad customer service experiences here before (being told to wait to pay while the only guy there called in tomorrow's bread order, again after waiting a long time. Looking for burrata and being handed one that was expired with a shrug and an explanation that the dates don't really mean anything). It my fault for coming back. It is a cute shop and I want to love it but the guys who work there are obnoxious.\n\nLuckily Luke's down the street had the same burrata for $2 cheaper.", "author": "Nicole M."}

The store is small but bursting at the seams with incredible cheeses, meats, wine and candies.\n\nAfter our first visit, we left dreaming about the sandwiches. I quickly scanned the menu while we were inside and couldn't wait to return and order one (we unfortunately came right after getting lunch elsewhere).\n\nThe wait was worth it.\n\nI got the Black Forest Ham on wheat with Mendocino mustard, cambazola cheese, arugula, tomatoes, onion and pickle - WOW. Wow, wow, wow. (There is no better word for the food here, sorry.) It was absolutely divine.\n\nMy friend got the Rosemary Smoked Ham on wheat and was just as thrilled. The sound effects from both of us while we were eating were hysterical. There were many \"mmmmmm\"s along with \"Oh my gosh...\" and \"DAMN!\"\n\nBoth sandwiches survived an hour-long drive to Mt. Tam plus two hours of hiking - bouncing around a backpack - before we stopped to devour them.

It had an ample amount of prosciutto but was also kind of dry tasting. I'd add avocado, olive oil, aioli or something for better texture. I ate half right away and I think the other half I had later on actually tasted better. One of those \"leftovers win\" scenarios. \n\nMy boyfriend had the roast beef w/ cheddar ($11?

I'm not sure why I didn't expect a cheese shop to have a rather pungent aroma, but it does.  This may bother some people, but after my initial shock, I kinda got used to it.\n\nBut if your nose was too sensitive for that small barrier, then it's certainly your loss, since you miss out on both the daunting selection and superb service.  I admit that I am not cheese aficionado at all, so I was really intimidated when I saw the varieties that they had available.  Maybe Say Cheese recognized that other people were similarly paralyzed from the realization of their own ignorance in the face of decision and choice, which may have led to their policy of letting people try out whatever cheeses they damn well please.  This includes people who were just waiting in line, since the cheese had already been sliced, so why waste it?  \n\nWhat I really noticed was not only how knowledgeable the staff was, but how passionate they were.  Their enthusiasm for cheeses was really infectious, which is fantastic for business since I'm fairly certain I bought about 150% more cheese than I actually intended when I went in.  And it makes me want to come back for more, since really, those cheese I bought were absolutely delightful.  \n\nAnd I'm only going to briefly mention their salami and wine selection, which are likewise great.  If only I had the opportunity to indulge in all three, but alas, it was late enough in the day that I couldn't justify a sandwich.  But there will be other days and other opportunities, and I hope that Say Cheese remains where it is for a long time.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I think I feel a heart attack coming.

In a big city where there are so many choices for good cheese shops, and businesses in general, you would think that shop owners would at least try to be polite to their potential customers.\n\nThis guy does not.\n\nThe other morning, my husband and I got our coffee at Tully's down the street in Cole Valley, and then strolled back to our car.  We popped into Say Cheese just to check it out, because we're always happy to learn about new cheese shops.  We went up to the counter of this cramped, non-wheelchair accessible shop, looked at the various selections (which were on the slightly pricey side, based on my experience with other locally owned cheese shops in SF), and were about to ask the man behind the counter for some assistance when he started berating us for our Tully's coffee:\n\n\"Instead of buying your coffee from Tully's, which is a big chain, you should go nextdoor instead.  Tully's always burns their coffee anyway, and nextdoor they serve the same kind of coffee Thomas Keller serves at French Laundry.  It's much better.\"  (Note:  I'm paraphrasing, since I didn't tape record the conversation...but this is pretty much what he said)\n\nBaffled and taken aback by this man's brusqueness, I stammered out that we enjoy our Tully's coffee, which doesn't taste burnt to us, and I enjoy the mochas I get there.  Why I felt the need to rationalize my purchase to this acrid man is beyond me.  I was just so shocked that he would be so rude.  \n\nHe proceeded to tell me that he's the owner of that coffee shop, Reverie, as well as this cheese shop.  He then launched into a tirade about how I should try the \"bacon bar\".  When I asked what that was, he repeated himself loudly and rudely, sounding out eat syllable slowly, as though I was stupid: \"BAY-CON BAR!!!\"\n\nWhat a rude, rude man.  I don't care how good he thinks his bacon bars are (which he said is a chocolate bar with bacon in it, ICK, and \"the next big thing in the food world\"...as if!), I wouldn't buy one from him if he was the last person selling chocolate on earth!!!  At that point, my husband and I, who'd been about to buy cheese BEFORE this venomous man opened his sanctimonious mouth, locked eyes with one another, and just walked out.  We'd had enough.  \n\nI've noticed a lot of rudeness and snootiness from shop owners in Cole Valley overall (noteable exceptions being Tully's, which is why I will always get my coffee there when in the neighborhood), but this really takes the cake!!  \n\nIn the future, I'll go back to my beloved Cheese Boutique on the corner of Irving and 12th, where the woman who works there is always polite and kind to me, patient and respectful of my choices, and VERY reasonably priced.  I'll also buy my cheese from Country Cheese Co. on Divisadero, Cowgirl Creamery in the Ferry Building, and basically any other place where I can get good cheese from a nice, decent human being who doesn't verbally assault me!!\n\nI sincerely hope that this man reads my review and realizes that maybe he should be a little more polite to patrons in the future.  But I doubt he'll do either.  So, instead, I can only hope that you, dear reader, will be able to make your own informed decision about checking this place out before subjecting yourself to the potential rudeness you might encounter inside this store.", "author": "Amy L."}

Just off Carl and Cole there are some good restaurants that we planned on checking out before we made our way to Haight. The place we planned on eating at wasn't opened yet, and we needed to find an alternative. While walking down the street I peeked in Say Cheese, and after looking at the menu, it looked like a good affordable place to eat. \n\nBesides buying cheese, wines, deli meats, and other kitchen accessories, you can choose from a variety of sandwich themes, or create your own. We decided to get a vegetarian and a chicken sandwich, then split them between ourselves. The bread is a circular roll, maybe 6\" and just the right size for a sandwich. The vegetarian had goat cheese, tomato, sprouts, and olive tapenade. The other had roasted chicken, sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil, pesto mayo, and jack cheese. \n\nThe thing about these sandwiches that makes them so amazing, besides the high quality fresh ingredients, is the amount of each item that was put on the sandwich. The vege had just the right amount of goat cheese and did not compete with the olive tapenade, all while the sprouts and tomato rested between the center of the two. The roasted chicken was amazing, and pesto mayo was creamy and not too overboard. The sun dried tomatoes were the best I have had. They didn't have that odd taste that most sun dried tomatoes I have eaten had, just a subtle flavor that worked well with the pesto, fresh basil, and chicken. \n\nOverall, the price was great and we left full but not stuffed.

He'll return all jauntily from a visit here with all sorts of plastic-wrapped, smelly, flavorful, bundles of fat.  And normally, I don't partake because I'm acutely aware of how many calories are in 2 cubes the size of dice (I was an Atkins follower before I turned South Beach and ended in vegan-land).  \n\nToday, was like no other day.  I'd just been horribly disappointed with the pate at Cafe C.  You know that feeling where you ate a substantial amount of something not very tasty but hoping that it'll get better with each bite, but it does not so now you are bloated, big, malnourished but still craving something?  This was me.  Normally I walk by this place and I think, FAT.  Today I walked by and the word Charcuterie caught my eye.  That instantly got translated in my brain as \"Meat and PATE!\"  You will never see a small Asian girl scuttle so quickly in here as I did that day.  You'd have though Brad Pitt was giving away hugs.  \n\nInside, the person behind the counter barely let me ask the question, \"which pate do you prefer?\" before he answered, \"truffle mouse.\"  he said it in the same solemn, near-religious, assertive, knowing, matter-of-fact way that people answer factual questions.  \"what time is it?\"  \"it's 1:30.\"  I probed a little more, because the foie de canard looked like a glistening block of love, a caramel-topped tub of i-want-to-rub-it-all-over-the-cracker, a plastic enrobed invitation to just use your hands.  \n\nHe gave me a little taste of it, and I was sold.  I bought about 1/2 inch thick slab.  He wrapped up my precious addiction and I paid for it.  it cost EONS less than the pate i'd just choked down at lunch ($4).  I was able to chose my method of transportation (Boulange's mini baguettes), and the manner (secretly, on the couch, before the BF gets home), and the frequency.  \n\nThat is control.

It has been around longer than I have, and while keeping to its mom and pop roots, it has also kept up with the times as evidenced by its slick website and ever impressive selection of local gourmet foods and locally produced eggs from organic, free range chickens.  Intimidated by the depth of the cheese menu here (and lacking in sophisticated cheese knowledge), I did not visit Say Cheese for the longest time.  But cheese neophytes need not fret -- the sandwiches here are excellent and you can opine on the quality of sandwiches without being a cheese expert.  The sandwiches are surprisingly good, given that they seem like a side note unless you set foot in the store.  The sandwich recipes are tried and true; the bread tastes oven fresh and the balance of ingredients is perfect.  We had the calabrese salame (with roasted red pepper, provolone, dijon, EVOO & balsamic, salt & pepper, $8.50) and roasted chicken (sundried-tomato-garlic-pesto aioli, jack, fresh basil, $7.50).

There aren't enough of these little shops  in San Francisco. More than likely it will remind you a little of New York.", "author": "Ben H."}

Meanwhile my buddies are watching this awkwardness ensue and not saying anything. Great friends. This exact same man pitched his photo shoot to me at the Folsom Street Fair back in 2005 (I was eating watermelon at the time). I mean, shouldn't friends intervene here? I guess it was flattering and all, but come on... Perhaps he is a world famous photographer, but he just came across as a creepy old man with a fetish for redheaded boys.\n\n2. The second time I went there, my buddy Nick chatted with the main cheese man and scored us some uber-salty Greek cheese named Haloumi. Wow. It was the best cheese I have ever eaten in my life.

It comes with shredded lettuce, so um, sold. \n- The variety of deli staples - the tiny, red piquillo peppers, olives, and balsalmic-y cippolini onions are never missing from my dinner party cheese plates. And usually always stocked in my fridge for snacking. \n- The lightning speed with which they make my sandwich and the fact that it's always made perfectly, meaning I never have to disassemble it and reorganize things on the bread so each bite is well balanced in order to appease my food OCD like I typically do when I order a deli sandwich. \n- The bargain cheese bin - A little basket of the sliced off ends or leftover tiny bits of what was once a giant old round or slab. I love the idea behind it - that these snippets of cheese are just too precious to do away with and I seriously love the tiny price tag on what will become a perfect portion of late night snacking cheese in a variety I wouldn't want to pay full price to try for the first time.\n- The curmudgeonly old owner. Yeah, sometimes I don't look him in the eye when I pick out a cheese, for fear he may snap at me for doing it wrong, but this also means that when he does approve, I leave there feeling like my old, cranky grandpa who hates everything and everybody just snuck me one of his prized werther's originals. \n\nThe only negative thing I can muster writing about this beloved spot is that I never leave without spending at least $45.

The guy who works there said \"I don't have any eggplant.\" So I hesitated to choose another item for fear that they may not have it also.  He continued to suggest that I may be interested in the vegetarian offerings (I didn't really say anything, but was in quiet deliberation) and said that the most popular vegetarian sandwich was the fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil.  So I said, \"alright, I'll have that.\"  He asked me to choose which bread I want, so I said, \"i'll have it on multigrain.\"  He quickly snapped at me saying that my choice was a bad idea since he will drizzle olive oil on the sandwich and the multigrain bread would get soggy.  I had my eye on the panini... since he said \"choose something with a hard crust\".  I swear I said \"panini\", but he didn't hear me and suggested that I have my sandwich on a ciabatta roll.  At this point, I just conceded because everytime I am presented with what seemingly could be a CHOICE, he had already made the decision for me.  I was actually surprised when he asked me if I wanted a bag for my sandwich... since he was giving me, yet, another chance to make my own decision.  Finally I did, and said \"naww\".\n\nI never left this place disappointed.  My first experience here was actually to use up the nifty gift certificate that my coworkers gave me for my birthday.  The fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil in ciabbata roll turned out to be one of my best lunches.  Their cheeses are freakin good (don't be afraid to ask for a taste... but be warned because you'll most likely want to buy the delectable cheeses so have some money for the trade).  They also carry Schmidt chocolates, wines (for cheese pairings), different deli items, chips, bottled drinks, coffees, etc.   In the words of Ariel, the Little Mermaid... \"Look at this trove, treasures untold!\"", "author": "Grace M."}

There was a quite atractive young woman in the store and the young sales kid was totally into her. Unfortunately, you have a cantankerous bastard like me also there.. When I noticed that he had no desire to help me, I did my best to annoy him. I started asking about their sheeps milk cheese and the differences between it and the cows milk. Then I asked about the different meats and what are better choices for sandwiches vs antipasto plates. He got more and more annoyed with me as the minutes ticked..

That's not what you go to a hole in the wall sandwich, meat and cheese shop for, is it? And after a while, once you've been in enough, you either forget the unpleasant atmosphere or the guys start to loosen up and actually talk to you (I like to think I fall into the latter position).\nThey have an amazing vegetarian sandwich selection compared to many places close by my hood, which automatically gets an A+ from me. And a belly-filling sandwich for $6 out the door? Sold.\nThe sandwiches are all amazing, they sell bacon-flavored chocolate (you know, if you're into that sort of thing), and have a good wine selection to boot.

We noticed a wine with a posting from the shop that said it had received a 99 rating from Wine Spectator.  It was a 2005 Chateau Le Pape Pessac-Leognan (a Bordeaux) and was selling for $40. That is most definitely on the upper end of my wine buying range, but we'd never seen a 99 rating before, and the proprietor said it was a real steal.  Also, they only had one left.  We decided to grab it.  As I was standing in the check-out line -- and, by the way, I waited for 30 minutes on the single line that fills cheese orders, fills sandwich orders, AND rings up simple items, even though there seems to be more than one register -- the proprietor actually tried to hawk the wine to the guy in front of me, not realizing I had it in hand.  The guy ahead of me lamented that it had already been taken.  Apparently, this was an AMAZING wine.\n\nWhen we got back home and did a little research, we found that not only did this wine get an 89 -- not a 99 -- rating, but I also find an online retailer selling it for $27!  We were quite disappointed.\n\nWhen I took the wine back to return, first, all the guys behind the counter were like, \"return...?\"  as if they'd never heard of the concept.  They deferred to the apparent head guy, who asked me what my concern was.  I showed him the bottle and explained myself.  He said, \"Oh, no...the 99 is just the vintage.\"  Hello??  I may be gullible, but I'm not THAT gullible.  It says 2005 on the bottle!!!  I pulled him over to the shelf of wines, where there were now several more of the same that I'd bought, and the same posted note.  I pointed out that it said \"99 Wine Spectator.\"  He conceded that the sign might be \"misleading\" but that he didn't write it up.\n\nLet's just hope that was a mistake.  The proof will be to see if they do change that sign....", "author": "Stacy R."}

The sandwiches, however, are reasonably priced and if they have not run out of the bread you like, can be very good. I come here pretty regularly and have never had a terrible experience with the food, although I must say that twice when I bought the raw italian sausage (to cook later at home) I wound up questioning how fresh it was. There is no expiration date and it definitely tasted funny both times (but it's really good normally). If they are not diligent about throwing out food past its prime and the \"funny tasting\" sausage tasted bad because it was old, then I think that is really unethical. The problem is, I'm sure they'd never admit it if I asked whether or not the sausage was old. I know they are a small place and products may not move quickly, but selling expired/old sausages would be really messed up. I am suspicious....\n\nMy main complaint, however, is that sometimes certain employees can be really unfriendly. I know some yelpers have said that expecting someone to be nice is being too \"sensitive,\" but when you work in customer service, it is your job to pull the stick out of your ass and at least fake being nice.

The guy with the ponytail will talk on the phone for 10 minutes while you just stand there, waiting to be helped. OOHH, that's right, I forgot, you have so many important things to be doing running this cheese shop and all! Take your time, I'll just stand here!\n\nI think when you are working at a gourmet deli, the vibe should be relaxed, ALL people should feel free to ask to try things or ask for suggestions, and your customers shouldn't be consistently and in large numbers complaining about how unfriendly you are. If you want to muse over what cheese would go best with what wine, etc., this may not be the best place for you because on average they won't be helpful and you will feel rushed. They will look at you like you are an idiot, choose one cheese, and pressure you to buy their selection. \n\nOh, and allow me to be specific if I am going to say they are unfriendly. There are two older men with beards; the taller skinnier one is not very socially adept and can come off as rude, although he is more talkative than most of the employees and feels like he has a lot of knowledge to share with you (condescending and offensive sometimes, useful other times). The guy with the ponytail is almost always unfriendly. He gets the award in my mind for the most unpleasant employee to have help you (if he ever actually acknowledges you before someone else does). I just don't get it...", "author": "Amanda C."}

I went to this cheese shop one time and was treated so rudely that I would never go back. They had a stack of boxes of wine inside the store. I saw that it was a wine I was familiar with and had enjoyed many times so I wanted to check on the price. I looked at the bottles and found no price tags so I asked the man behind the counter how much the wine was. I don't remember more than one other customer being in the shop but perhaps I was disturbing the man in some way because he responded, \"Can't you read the price on the bottle\". I was so taken aback that it took me a moment to respond, \"There isn't a price tag on the bottle.\" He may have told me the price after that but I don't remember because I was so angry that I stormed out. How dare you treat a potential customer in that way! I wouldn't touch this place with a ten foot pole.

And my neighbor had a similar negative experience -- she went once and never went back.  But the worst thing is the creative accounting.  I live in the neighborhood and used to go there every week. When you buy multiple items, they write the items on a paper bag, or on the back of your wrapped sandwich, for example.  But the last 3 times I went, I discovered that the amount they ran through on my credit card was much higher (by as little as $2, and by as much as $5) than the amount that you added up from all the items, even taking into account an 8.5% sales tax.  And of course they never give you an itemized cash register receipt, just the credit card slip. Having that happen once, I could see as an honest mistake.  Having that happen three times in a row... that makes me wonder how much they've bilked from me over the years....", "author": "Kris A."}
