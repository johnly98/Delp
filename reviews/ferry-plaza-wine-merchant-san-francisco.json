I don't think I could ask for more than Cowgirl Creamery's Mt. Tam, cured meat from Boccalone and Prather Ranch; satisfyingly complete with a glass of wine ... or two.\nThis adorable little liquor shop includes a bar and just a few high-top tables for patrons to enjoy drinks and relax.\n\n$31.75 Italian Salumi & Cowgirl Cheese Combo - 5 oz. half round of Mt. Tam,  Prather Ranch Soppressata, Boccalone Lonza, Prather Ranch Country Ham, w/ Boccalone whole grain mustard, olive mix, Acme Epi baguette, McQuade's Celtic Fig & Ginger Chutney:\nMy friend and I shared this platter along with a couple glasses of white and red. I don't remember which wines we had, but they were delicious.\nOur waiter recommended us some excellent choices.\nIt's been a while since I've had Mt. Tam triple-cream cheese. It is just as smooth and buttery as I remember. The Acme epi is one of my favorite breads as well, as it is wonderfully fluffy with a soft chew. It really is an excellent combination.\nThe soppressata had a chewier texture, while the lonza was more delicate, and the country ham was sliced super thin. The fig and chutney were nice accoutrements, but I usually don't feel the need to add on. The bread, cheese, and meat are already so good together. \n\nI'm sure I'll be back to enjoy more wine in the future. Perhaps next time I'll try the burrata as well.", "author": "Joy W."}

Full discretion: I've been thinking about those olives since. \n\nThis was my second visit to this wine market and bar located in the middle section of the ferry building. I have to say, I was super impressed by the Sunday afternoon energy you'll find throughout the entire market. It appears that everyone in San Fran loves to drink and eat ice cream on Sunday afternoons. I can get on board with that.\n\nI was nervous about lugging my laptop on the bar and wanted to make certain I was \"earning my time and spot.\" I ordered a full glass of a Californian wine (5 oz. pour/loved it/forgetting the name but remembering the price of $13.75), followed by the green olives ($7- generous serving and so damn good) and a white wine sample. I know, my wine prowess is sounding super elementary right now so do me a favor and focus on the fact that I loved the energy, what I sampled and the atmosphere.\n\nNote that this is part bar and part shop so you can pick up chilled bottles or join their rose club while you're there as well. The bar space is on the cozy (aka small) size but it does the job. I'll certainly return during my next work trip.", "author": "Brittany S."}

I had a dry, fruity Spanish white followed by a fruity, metallic Spanish red. Nothing exceptional, which is why I didn't note the names, but I appreciated the experience. I also ordered some of the Mt Tam from Cowgirl Creamery, which came with Acme bread and a raisin and fig compote. Simple, predictable, but well-done and delicious.\n\nGod bless tourists, but I think we can all agree that milling groups do not make for a chill and sophisticated ambiance.

Ferry Plaza Wine Merchant is located in, you guessed it, the Ferry Plaza building in SF.  In addition to wines, WM also offers local beers, meat from Boccalone, cheese from Cowgirl, and bread from Acme:  What a great way to enjoy all four vendors at one location!\n\nWe ordered the Boccalone salumi and Cowgirl cheese ($29.95).  The charcuterie also came w/ Acme bread, olives, and peach chutney.  First of all, the salumi was outstanding!  The flavor of Chris Constantino's craft salumi shined:  5 Stars.  In addition, the creaminess of the cheese contrasted nicely against the salumi:  5 Stars.  Acme didn't disappoint either, and the bread was crusty on the outside, and chewy on the inside:  5 Stars.  Lastly, the olives and chutney were also very good.  The only downside was the plate needed more mustard, and I asked for no chutney, and replace w/ nuts:  4 Stars.  To drink, she had a grenache from France ($10), while I had a schiava from Italy ($8.25).  The grenache is a little heavier and it was exactly what she was looking for.  The schiava is a lighter wine from a thin skinned, larger grape.  It was perfect for me on a hot day:  Both 4 Stars.\n\nThe ambiance is very nice.  In addition to the retail store, there are a few seats at both sides of the bar, some high seats facing outward, and a few high seats along the main part of the Ferry building.  The only downside was there wasn't a smaller charcuterie plate:  It was a lot of food for two people:  4 Stars.  Regarding the service, there was room for improvement.  The bartender was friendly, but he took a while to acknowledge us.  In addition, our food came out after another couple that arrived well after us.  Lastly, the bartender didn't give her a place setting:  3 Stars for the bartender, 2 Stars for the kitchen.  \n\nI would have rated this place a 4, other than the fact that I met a Korean girl here.  We had met the night before (Valentine's Day), and promised each other that if we showed up here the next day, we would exchange numbers.  Well we both showed, and I couldn't have had a better time.

I live in Texas and among the many lovely idiosyncrasies of the Lone Star State is the one about people sending us booze.  There's all kinds of laws and prohibitions and rules so most places won't even fool with it to start.  In fact, entire states just can't or won't.  If you filter on winesearcher.com for \"ships to Texas\", you get three hits.  \n\nFerry Plaza however, not only ships to Texas, but if you buy 12, you get the 10% case discount.  Which you should do anyway cause the only drag about having wine delivered to your door is you must be there to receive it, so it's cheaper by the dozen in both dollars and cents, like pa\"tience\" for waiting around for the UPS person...If you only ordered 6, you'd have to do that twice as often.  No, thank you.\n\nNow, the reason I had the privilege to speak to Carter today was that one of the wines I'd ordered to round out my mixed dozen was actually sold out and rather than miss the one day a week \"ship to Texas\" special delivery window, he figured I probably really wanted the brut rose that I'd ordered 9 bottles of and didn't really care about the rando other whites I'd chosen so round out the dozen, so he nixed the out of stock bottle, kept the discounts, and my birthday rose is on it's way to me as we speak!  Fabulous!\n\nIn addition to great customer service in a clutch, I really like their website.  They have this handy trademarked Wine Profile tool that you can use to search for wines based on six characteristics: type, sweetness, intensity, body, wood, & farming.  And the profiler explains what each characteristic is and the different levels in each.  I found some of these align to my De Long's Wine Grape Varietal Table, but some, like farming and wood, are unique to FPWM's site.  You could also look up wines you like on their site and see what the values are then do a search based on that (what would be cool is to do a backwards search from a wine you already like that has the same values, it would save a step, but not a big deal either way).\n\nThere are also many other ways to search and filter, and they have different categories, like \"New Arrivals\", \"Wines Under $20\", and \"Merchants Picks\" although I think I broke the website looking for still wines from Hungary...  Plus they have a monthly wine club and events and a wine bar on site.  FPWM is tops and eventually, I'll have a happy, sad, or regular face in every square of my De Long's with FPWM's help!", "author": "Melissa A."}

They even have nonalcoholic drinks but you have to ask the server about it. On the back of the menu they have foods to pair with your wines. Meats, cheeses, bread, etc.\n\nI love the sweet stuff, and moscato is one of my favorite kinds of wine, so I got the Centorri Moscato ($6.95 for one 5oz glass). I really like this wine and how it's kinda like sparkling cider. The alcohol is there but it isn't too strong and it's bubbly to the throat a bit.\n\nI also got a small Italian meat platter ($8.95). This came with slices of salami and mild coppa with olives and mushrooms drizzled with a Italian dressing. I actually like how well this platter paired with the moscato. I like that combination of salty and sweet, and the Italian dressing really made the sweetness of the moscato pop.\n\nOf course, wineries are always expensive, but this is a fun experience if you're down to try a simple glass or two.", "author": "Jerianne G."}

After several minutes he finally looked up and I asked him about how the tasting worked and he wasn't helpful at all.  I felt I was intruding on his buffering time.

So I there I stood in the middle of the shop seeing at least 5 employees that were wearing logo zip vests, two were in a  conversation near me in front of the refrigerated champagne selections, another talking with a friend.

I couldn't figure out where the Spanish Reds were located so finally my coworker asked a employee if we could have some help.  She said,  \"of course and that there were several employees that could help us\" as she directed us to the Spanish Reds.

We ordered a Boccalone salumi platter that's on the Ferry Plaza Wine Merchant's menu. It came with capocollo, prosciutto, soppressata, olives and cheese. We enjoyed that... They encourage their customers to bring back goods from the other businesses in the Ferry Building to have with their wine... I dig that. In fact, they give complimentary bread from the Acme Bread Company down the way.\n\nOur waiter was really cool. He was patient with us and attentive enough but not bugging. He had some good suggestions and my friends were pretty receptive to them. We brought food from Boccalone and Cowgirl Creamery cheese. It was a good few hours spent. They have tables that accommodate 4 to 8 people. We were on a high table for 4 and it was just right for our group. The bar seems to gets pretty packed with the after-work crowd. Looked like they offered tastings... Overall, we had a really good experience here. I highly recommend it.", "author": "Chuck D."}

Lured in by a white cotes du Rhone by the glass listed on the menu outside, the bartender apologized that they had just changed the menu and had replaced it with a Macon chardonnay. Would I like that instead? Sure, a nice crisp white Burg sounded fine. Not what I was looking for, but it would do. \n\nThat's when it started. Digging in to the menu, I realized I was in a by the glass wine geek's paradise. A Coravined wine section? Yes, please. I finished the refreshing Macon and asked for a glass of the '12 Didier Dagueneau Silex sauv blanc. Knowing full well it needed a moment to wake up, I sipped a tasty German riesling in the meantime. During my interlude,  the bartender (Jason I think? Bad with names) found what was left of the white Rhone I was looking for initially and poured me a couple ounces. Nice touch, and much appreciated.\n\nHungry now, and wanting food to go with the Silex, I almost ordered the first cheese plate that struck me, but Jason steered me towards a massive hunk of Vermont goat cheese that paired perfectly with the incredibly intense, funky sauv blanc. And I'll be damned if that wine wasn't everything I wanted it to be. At $35 a glass, it's certainly not a bargain, but totally worth it for a wine that I've been wanting to try but not drop the 120ish for a bottle. It was an hour and a half of sheer bliss.

I am a native San Franciscan and always seem to get excellent service most places that I go. For some reason, every time I visit this place I have the impression that the bartender absolutely despises me. They always ignore me when I sit down and take forever to say hello even though they are standing right in front of me. Then when they finally do stop to ask me what I would like to order they seem to have complete distain for me as though I had poisoned their pet poodle in some previous lifetime. Once again, I ordered a glass of wine and it seems that they found some ancient bottle that had been open for about a month and turned to vinegar. The wine they served me was hideous for that reason. As usual, I did not drink the wine that I ordered, paid my bill and left a standard tip. All very expensive following the standard SF model. It may be that I remind the bartender of someone that he hates. I have no idea, but I will never waste any more of my time or money in that place again.

We went in today about 15 mins before they closed (which was 5pm on Sunday). While someone in retail was helping my friend choose a wine, I walked up to the counter with a beer in my hand with the sole purpose of just asking the bartender if she could throw it away for me since there was no trashcan around. She was bending down behind the counter and said something to me, which I did not understand seeing as how she did not even have the decency to stop what she was doing to address a possible customer. I said, \"I'm sorry what?\" And she replied by saying that if I wanted to purchase something it needed to be done at the retail counter, which I already well knew. And I said oh no, I was just wondering if you can take this piece of trash. And she said yeah just set it on the counter so I did and walked away. As I walked away, she said \"there's no need for an attitude, I just saw you walk up with a beer\". I didn't bother to turn around to get her name or ask her to repeat herself, as it was the end of my day and I'm sure the end of hers as well.  \n\nThat type of response is unacceptable to a customer or a human being,  seeing as how I was not rude to her in slightest bit, and I certainly don't need to explain my natural demeanor to someone who's only job is to give someone decent service.  \n\nWe are regulars at this shop, but thanks to the woman working the closing shift at the bar this Sunday, you will never have our money again.", "author": "Alana W."}

Come here mainly if you like wine.  It's perfectly OK to bring food from one of the many awesome food places elsewhere in the Ferry building and order their wine at the bar or a table.  But if your idea of a great meal is wine paired with great cheese and maybe some fine meats, then look no further than their own menu, most of which comes from their neighbors in the ferry building anyway.\n\nWednesday nights are wine maker nights and you can meet local wine experts - a great day to hang out and talk wine with people in the know.  You can talk about the smell of damp earth, or a taste of chocolate and berry, or whatever it is you think you perceive in the wine.", "author": "David L."}

I was really impressed by the lack of oak in the chardonnay.  I honestly haven't tried that much California chardonnay in the last few years because I can't stand the oak.  So as the server said, this one is good because it sits on the fence between steel and oak, which happens to be like the French chardonnays that I love - the ones that are aged in old oak so that they don't pick up too much of it.  I also liked the pinot.  Both I would buy, particularly for their price. \n\nMy husband had the specialty flight, and it helped us to find a lovely red from Portugal.  We split the charcuterie plate - delicious, except for the prosciutto, which had gotten soggy from the olive juice or something.\n\nMostly, I was impressed by the regulars who seem to know all the wines there and the servers who know exactly what to offer them.

We made sure we looked at the website to look up the business hours and we even called to confirm. Their website states that on Sunday their store and wine bar hrs are from 10am-7pm.  So on Sunday we arrived at 6pm thinking we have an hour before closing to relax and sip on wine. As we walked up, the bartender didn't wait to say hi or greet us, he just simply did the hand motion \"throat slash\" that basically states \"we are closed\" We found this to be very rude. We continue to walk up to the bar and the bartender said the bar closes at 6pm and the store opens till 7pm. Well this is not what is stated on the website, not to mention the bar had plenty of customers. If the bar closes earlier then they need to include this on the website. All in all, we were very disappointed on how this situation was handled. We walked over 2 miles from the hotel and planned on arriving at 6pm!  My husband and I are both in the service industry, and understand that this is unacceptable. Good customer service=repeat customer=word of mouth=free advertisement. Do you agree? We will never return to this place again! What a shame!", "author": "Cecillia N."}

I had no real intent on doing a tasting the other night. I went in to the Ferry Building to try Blue Bottle Coffee, and I leave tasting 5 different wines, and a bottle of a 2001 Brunello di Montalcino, rumored to be one of the best vintages in a long time. We shall see. \n\nI sampled 5 different kinds of wine that night. Every two weeks or so, the Wine Merchant has a tasting of one particular winery. You are given a place mat where all the wines are placed. I learned it's best to sample one wine at a time, staring from the lightest, finish that glass, and proceed to the next wine. Let's just say, I got schooled. \n\nAlong with wine, you may have several kinds of cheese from Cowgirl Creamery, oddly, which you know is also in the building. That along with Acme Bread, you can have a great meal. Salumi plates from Boccalone are available as well. I was alone, and didn't want all that meat and cheese, so I stuck with a baguette and a bowl of nuts.  The nuts were nothing special, perhaps just a bowl of Costco brand.\n\nThere are lots of bottles to choose from, and you might find a good one.  Price is quite a bit higher than Hidden Vine.  The tasting of the night cost $40, but some of the glasses have prices of $180 for the bottle, so I assume depending on the winery, the price would be less.  It gets a bit noisy, but I think that was because of the bi-weekly tasting.", "author": "Michael M."}

I've been to one so far and while the premise was interesting and the wines were good, I felt as if the service level wasn't what I expect at a tasting event.  In their defense, it was insanely busy but we really received no information about the wines beyond the little notes with the flight.  I would come back for a drink with friends or to buy a nice bottle but that is really it.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nThis place gets five stars for their eclectic and unique selection (small production, hard to find wines - yay!) but I dropped stars for two reasons:\n\nFirst, I've had two bad experiences coming to pick a wine - one staff member actually rolled his eyes when I asked for a sparkling wine that was not Brut (I don't like the super dry champagnes).  Most of the time I get excellent service and I do keep coming back, but if the snotty attitude comes out again I'm moving permanently to K&L.\n\nSecond reason - high priced specialty tasting flights.  On many an occasion I have wanted to come try the special flights with the guest winemakers, but $75??  I just can't do it, and I think it's overpriced.  I know, they are limited production wines but still...\n\nSo, overall - a great place to find that wine nobody else at dinner will have, but I do not vouch for consistency of service.", "author": "Suzanne B."}

These guys are the real deal: at the bottom of the label, you'll see a tiny \"RM\": this means \"recoltant manipulant\", and indicates they grow the grapes for their champagne.  Sounds like not-a-big-deal, but over 90% of champagne houses don't do this.  I love exclusivity!\n\nI also love finding similarly obscure white burgundies that taste as if they cost three times their very reasonable price.  But I don't love not being able to find that same bottle two weeks later.  Wait, did I say I love exclusivity?  Not that much.

It took forever for the server to even greet us, and honestly that was the extent of our interaction. I don't know if he thought we were \"too  young\" or thought we wouldn't tip well off the bat or something, but I am a discerning foodie who frequents restaurants quite often. He acted bothered when we ordered food, and it got to the point where, when attempting to get his attention to order more wine, he simply glanced over his shoulder never stopping or uttering a word. He did, however, pay attention to every other table than ours--it is worth mentioning that they were hardly busy, and not as crowded as others have described. It ended up another staff member who took our second order, and again another to finally bring our bill after motioning several times to get the attention of our original server. I mean, I'm not picky but not once did he ask how we liked anything. Now this friend of mine was in town visiting, and can you imagine my embarrassment at having been treated so poorly?\n\nFighting every urge to give this man the worst tip possible, we very graciously gave him a generous tip along with \"Thanks for the great service!\" written on the bill.

I grabbed some fresh bread from Acme and two semi-firm cheeses from Cowgirl to accompany our wine foray. The Ferry Plaza Wine Merchant has a decent handful of cheeses on their brief menu, but I was in the mood to try something new. I love that FPWM welcomes outside food. Our waiter saw the bag and brought us a cheese board and knife right away, great service. \n\nWe created a few different flights with the intention of buying a bottle to enjoy at the wine bar. Our tastes included the following: 2 oz pours of the Bodegas Matilde Totus Tuus Cava and Pierre Moncuit Grand Cru, 2008 Domaine Moreux Sancerre Chavignol, 2007 Brooks Janus Pinot Noir, 2007 Daedulus Labyrinth Pinot Noir, and the 2006 Tolaini Valdisanti Toscanna Rosso. After tasting the Sancerre, I was certain that's what I wanted! It was perfectly crisp, with subtle citrus (ie not overbearing melony fruit), minerality, and a clean light finish. My tasting partner was in the mood for red though. At this point, I noticed that despite sitting amidst the retail bottles watching people scurry by in the ferry building, FPWM had a good buzz about it. Many seats were full and everybody was having a great time even though it was mid-week. My main complaint is that the stools are not very comfortable, in fact they are down-right uncomfortable. Otherwise, I think we would have been willing to while away the entire evening there. However, we opted to grab a bottle of the Brown Estate Napa Valley Zin (with the scarab on the label) and finish off the night at home. \n\nAside from the stools, FPWM gets a thumbs up.

Growing up Italian and with connections to the Gallo family, the best we ever got was Turning Leaf, but we usually had some variety of table wine.\n\nNow that I'm grown up, I want to have wines from all over the world, not just the central valley of california. This is the place for it, you want German or Austrian they have it. Try the Vertliner, while I can't tell you what varietal it is, I can tell you it's a white and very good. I can't say the same for the Italian Dolcetto, which means sweet. I've never had a red dessert wine, and I probably never will again. A flight runs about $8 for three tastes.\n\nI'm also a proponent of tastes verses glasses of wine, and most of their tastes are under $5.

Last call is around 7ish, however, so the drinking is short-lived (not a bad thing).  Since it positions itself more as a wine merchant than a wine bar, you shouldn't expect great service. Our waiter was neither knowledgeable nor helpful, and a bit unfriendly at times. But I assume that might be an isolated incident.\n\nThis place offers a range of wines, which is either a good or bad thing depending on your knowledge of wine. They also offer some cheese and cold cuts to snack on which is nice. The bread is super yum - so yummy that the snack can end up being your dinner for the evening.

My GF and I went to the Ferry Building on 3/24/12 around noon and after checking out all the vendors, we decided to stop here for a drink.  The place was very busy, but we saw a sign that said \"please seat yourself\" and saw two open tables.  We went to sit down at one of the tables and one of the employees, male in a red vest with a neatly trimmed beard and short spiky hair told us \"Other people are waiting, go get in line\" (this is verbatim).  Not even a \"please\" or \"sorry for the confusion, we are a little busier than normal today\".  I mentioned the sign that said seat yourself and asked if that was the case.  He then said \"just get in line\" (verbatim again) and walked away.   This normally would have caused me to walk away, but my GF really wanted to try the place out so we got in line.  While we waited in line, the guy in the red vest came up to the line and said \"You all need to move over and keep this area clear for me\" then walked away again.  As a former waiter, I know everyone has bad days, but you cannot let your foul mood effect your work and rub off on your customers.  Thankfully, we did not end up in this employee's section.\n\nWe did end up with a wonderful server who took the time to recommend some wines from the wine list and told me about the Pilsner on tap was from a European brewer who scoured America looking to expand, but found that the water in Berkley (for some reason) was the only water that could re-create the proper flavor and taste of the beer they brew.  I wish I got our servers name, because he was that amazing.  \n\nFood & Drinks - They have a huge wine & beer selection so there is something on the menu for everyone and the cured meats we got went really well with our drinks.  I could have spent the day there drinking my way through the menu.\n\nAtmosphere - Fantastic.  First, you have to realize that this place is in the Ferry Building which is a very busy place, so if you are looking for quiet and relaxing, this isn't it.  But, it is an awesome place to people watch and drink the day away.\n\nRecommendation - Definitely try this place out.  The beer and wine variety alone are reason enough to come here just make sure you don't get the server with the neatly trimmed beard and short spiky hair.", "author": "Matthew D."}

I saw a few gems in the higher-end section, and I do appreciate that they carry a ton of value wines under $20 for those looking for that sort of thing. But of all the wines I looked at, I only settled for a 2009 bottle of Barbera d' Alba for $24...just because I was intent on bringing home a bottle of wine from my trip. Ironically, it was an Italian wine so the novelty of bringing home a California red sourced so close to Napa was a fail. With ACME, Cowgirl, and Boccalone next door though, this is the perfect place to pick up a bottle of wine and pack a picnic basket. 3 Stars for their service and selection.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-10-08", "description": "My wife and I went to the Wine Merchant  after celebrating our 20th anniversary with dinner at Michael Mina, an overnight stay at the Hotel Vitale and lunch at the Slanted Door. Before we left for home we strolled over to the Ferry Plaza and enjoyed a couple of tastes and glasses. The woman behind the wine bar was great and a lot of fun. I can't remember what we ended up buying but  we enjoyed our purchases and the day was fun. \n\nPart of my infrequent mass transit commute days usually include a stop at the Wine Merchant. You see, I commute from Alameda to Menlo Park and that involves CalTrain and a ride on the Harbor Bay Ferry. Well, the timing of these connections normally leaves me with about 45 minutes to kill at the Ferry Plaza during the evening commute home. By the time I get there it's just before 7PM and most of the places in the plaza are closed, except for the Wine Merchant and the indoor/outdoor bar whose name escapes me. So, since I really like wine it's the perfect opportunity to browse. The wine bar's usually crowded so I just look over the cases and shelves for something interesting. Last week I happened upon a bottle of  a \"Neal\" cabernet. It was a huge bottle and I didn't want to buy that much since I didn't really know much about \"Neal\" wines. So, I asked if they had a more normal sized bottle. They did and it wasn't cheap but it didn't scare me enough NOT to buy it. So I did. I haven't tried it yet as I'm saving it for, well, I'm not sure yet. She (\"She\" being the woman that has helped me on a few occasions there. I'm bad with names.)  assured me it was good and I believe her because she's been good to us so far. Maybe I'll let you know how right she was.\n\nI've enjoyed my visits to the WM and I must say the good folks that serve you there are quite helpful and friendly. That's been my experience anyway. Looking forward to my next commute through there.\n\nUPDATE: Stopped in there Friday evening while waiting for the HBF to arrive for the final leg of my commute home. It was crowded but I found a SRO spot near the register. I didn't have much time so I did a speed tasting of some PInot's on the list. One full glass and one taste.\nBoth were good but then the guy behind the bar brings me a generous taste of a another Pinot that was really nice with a very generic label. I bought a couple of bottles and headed to the HBF. Now this review wasn't about the wine but just the cool extra pour and the story of how they got the wine. That turned out to be my favorite of the three. If you want to know what it was let me know. I don't have it in front of me to write about it. C'mon I'm at work!\n\nYet another update!:\nWell, you're probably of the opinion that I stop in here frequently. OK, I confess, every time I ride the HBF I roll through there. My excuse(s)?\n1) I have time to kill and by the time I get to the ferry plaza everything else is pretty much closed EXCEPT the FPWM.\n2) I like wine.\n3) Both 1 and 2.\nThis update is basically that I finally ran into the helpful \"she\" that \nI mentioned before and asked her name (for the fourth time probably).\nHer name is Dina and she's great. I was in a hurry my last pass through, well sort of, I didn't have time to enjoy a glass before the last ferry left. So, Dina recommended a nice inexpensive bottle for the ride\nhome and told me that I would be calling her to thank her.  It was great and I shared it with a couple of folks on the ferry home. I will thank her when I stroll through there again.\n\nLast night I stopped in to browse and found a bottle that sounded interesting and wasn't too expensive to gamble on. Although it was probably a safe bet since the FPWM review was favorable. However, as usual I was running up against the ferry schedule. I was in line to purchase it but the register malfunctioned briefly while serving another customer. I had to make a decision, miss the last ferry or hang around and buy the bottle. Well, couldn't miss the ferry as that would have been really inconvenient. I'll be back soon anyway.  2005 O'Neil Pinot.", "author": "Neal A."}

We were hoping for a glass of water but it was never offered, and we were unable to get his attention until he finally noticed that the wine glasses were empty; at that point we ordered the water with no second glass of wine, which seemed to be an irritation for him to accomplish.  We finished the water and pulled out the credit card, the international behavior for \"Yes, we would like to pay now,\" but our waiter was way too busy carrying on a long conversation with another patron, then clearing dishes from another table, then going back and standing in the bar....after waiting about ten minutes, we got up and went to the bar and paid the tab there.

The wine bar is great, opens early for those looking for some bubbly to go with the fresh shucked oysters from Hog Island Oyster Co.  \nAnd, the wines by the glass change often, so you want to go back and try more!", "author": "Megan C."}

The Chard is unoaked and crisp...served chilled by a great staff for $15.00 a bottle. The other wines are great and it's hard to beat the \"people watching\" factor of the Ferry Building. I will go again and again..note bring lots of quaters for parking.", "author": "Kim F."}

It's always packed here and it was the first time my bf and I actually sat down for drinks and lounge there a bit.  They had a lot of wines I haven't seen before on their list and their system was nice and handy to figure out if you'll like it but I kinda miss the descriptions I would recieve at other wine bars I've been to...however, a friendly question and recommendation from the bartenders there are so incredibly helpful.  Everything he recommended that night to my bf and I were good.  We ended up having 2 glasses of wine each and a gruyere and tomato olive tapanade.  AND he gave us a complimentary tasting of pinot...yums...You can't go wrong w/ cheese and wine.  We lounged there for awhile and just hung out.  Although it was crowded everyone was nice and friendly.  I do recommend sitting right at the bar so you get the bartender's attention and faster service although they still do pretty well for a packed place. *happy thoughts*", "author": "Kim D."}

Prices and selection are usually above par and they carry one of my favs. Although I don't frequent it quite enough to want to write a stellar review. Unfortunately after my experience tonight I felt the need to write the opposite. It was a casual Friday so I was in jeans, hoodie and carrying my backpack with my gym clothes. Immediately this time upon walking in a middle aged woman with bob-cut hair sized me up. It wasn't until she informed another employee to watch the small bottles because they disappear into people's backpacks that I got the feeling she was referring to me. I shrugged it off as a random comment but when she followed me around the store straightening bottles that were perfectly fine, it drove the point home. So I left feeling a dark cloud over my head. And all I wanted was my Bedrock. Anyways, an employee is the face of the company so that's why I give the worst star possible. Because bad service is one thing, but making a customer feel like a bad person for being in the store, that's a whole other ball game.", "author": "W Z."}

They have a sign that says \"seat yourself\" so I figure they are going to look for me not the other way around. After a few minutes waiting (long enough to go through the binder on the table) I decide to go up to the counter and ask for help. Finally this guy comes up and I ask him how it works. He indicates the binder as the menu. I'm thinking \"this place has dozens of bottles where is a nice list of wines by the glass\" To my mind they don't have very much listed. First he tells me we have to buy a bottle cos it's Wednesday. Apparently that's what passes for a joke there. Then he points out the pitiful list of wines by the glass. Ok so we go pick a bottle. No prices of course. Then half a loaf of 2.00 bread from acme bakery and half a small Mt Tam cheese is 12 bucks and 12 olives are 6.50. What a rip off! Oh yeah we ask for water and he automatically up sells us with a bottle of still water that we have to buy instead of tap. God I hate places like this. I don't care if the who's who of winemakers are here it's not the kind of place I like. Typical elitist place. I cannot recommend the service or the prices.", "author": "claire k."}

HOWEVER, I went in last week to buy a bottle of sherry, after not having been in for quite a while.  Not only did several staff walk right by me, even though I was clearly not seeing what I was looking for, but when I had decided on a bottle and the guy behind the register was ringing it up, he was tres rude.  I asked him about where he might suggest I look for a particular label/style I had liked when I visited Jerez, Spain (the sherry region), and it was seriously ALL he could do not to roll his eyes.  As he answered me (telling me I should try BevMo or Safeway for something like that) he kept looking over my shoulder.  I actually turned around, wondering if there was someone he was making eye contact with or to see if I was holding up the line.  No.  He was just DONE with me and my silly question.  I almost walked away from the purchase, but really wanted the bottle.  I will never purchase from here again.  I hate to do it to a small business, but one bad customer service incident really can make the difference.", "author": "Kathryn F."}
