Since there was a wait when we got in, the server suggested that all three of us be seated at the bar so that we could get faster service.  How could we say no?  \n\nWe were seated within 5 minutes and dinner was served.  I ordered the Spicy Miso broth with the Kobe beef.  The broth was just the right amount of spicy and I ended up adding more hot sauce just for my own tastes.  The beef was perfect-- tender with great marbling.   After adding in all the fixings with their peanut sauce, hot sesame oil, and veggies, we were good to go.\n\nI love how the stoves would intermittently boil and then stop boiling just to keep the broth from burning and or evaporating.  Genius idea!  \n\nWhy did I take off one star?  The service was a little lack luster.  Not once were our waters refilled without having to flag one of the servers down to ask.

The meat quality here is fantastic (the marbling on the kobe beef is beautiful) and the service is great. The menu isn't as extensive as some of the other nearby hotpot places like Grand or IPOT but I'm a pretty simple hotpot goer. All I need is good beef and vegetables. If you're simple like me, Shabu House is the place go. Another plus is that if you're not feeling the need to stuff yourself, you don't need to do AYCE ($35).

To give you some perspective, shabu shabu is Japanese-styled hot pot where thinly sliced meat and vegetables are cooked in a flavored broth and then dipped into a sauce. In this case, Shabu House offers soup bases like traditional water (Don't get - it's just boiled water), spicy miso, and ginger chicken. You can order all you can eat ($34 per person) and/or drink ($46 per person) or individual entrees in regular or large in American Style Kobe Beef, Lamb, Kurobuta Pork, or a combination of the meats. Regular entrees are 20.99 and large is 23.99. Both options come with assorted vegetables (like cabbage, spinach, mushrooms, tofu, carrots), udon, rice, and ice cream (green tea or red bean) for dessert. There are also sauces (one peanut and one ponzu) and other condiments to add to the flavor. I typically like to add more garlic for extra flavor. \n\nWhen I come after work with friends, I usually order a large beef entree with half spicy miso and ginger chicken as soup base. It's the perfect portion size for those who want to be full but not too stuffed. I personally don't think all you can eat is worth it; there's enough meat in the large entree to be pretty content. The beef quality is good. I appreciate that the beef slices are not too thick in texture. Prices here are pretty standard for shabu. I just wanted to highlight that there's a happy hour for 15% off your entire bill from 5-6pm. \n\nGet here early for no wait, happy hour, and easier parking. I usually park on blocks past Clement where parking is not metered.", "author": "Michelle L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-15", "description": "Have you ever walked out of a movie feeling so conflicted? Maybe the movie was pretty good, but there was something about it that just turned you off. \n\nWell for me, I experienced that \"movie\" through Shabu House (I hope that metaphor makes sense for y'all). Yesterday, my girlfriend and I stopped by Shabu House after a long and eventful adventure into Mendocino county. Even though we both really wanted to enjoy this restaurant, we simply couldn't; despite serving decent food, Shabu House disappointed us with its remarkably poor service. \n\nShabu House is a decently sized restaurant that's located in the heart of San Francisco's Inner Richmond district. For those of y'all who don't know, \"Shabu\" is a Japanese style of hot pot where customers get to boil a variety of ingredients in a steaming bowl of broth. Usually, this experience is accompanied by a variety of different sauces and condiments. \n\nIf you're a big fan of simple menus because you like to make quick decisions, this restaurant is for you. Shabu House only has 3 types of soup to choose from (Spicy Miso, Water??, and Ginger Chicken) and 3 kinds of meat (Kobe Beef, Lamb, and Pork). I was a bit taken aback at the lack of options, but hey quality over quantity? In terms of sizing, you can either go regular (~$20), large ($22), or All You Can Eat ($34+). The prices seemed pretty fair in our eyes, considering the fact that every meal came with ice cream. Yes, that's right. Every meal comes with a small bowl of ice cream.\n\nMy girlfriend and I ended up splitting a Spicy Miso with lamb and Kobe Beef. Here's what we thought of the experience:\n\n-- SATISFYING SHABU -- \nIt's been pretty tough for me to find a hot pot restaurant in the Bay Area that doesn't charge through the roof for decent food. But overall, Shabu House was surprisingly okay for the cost. First off, the soup. Although the broth didn't pack much heat, our spicy miso was very savory and wasn't too salty. Throughout, we kept dipping our spoon into the pot to drink the soup! \n\nWhen it came to the protein, I thought both the beef and lamb slices were well cut. Each piece was chewy and not too fatty. Plus, they weren't stingy on the portion size. As for the vegetables, I thought the quality was slightly lacking. For example, I felt like the cabbage slices were a bit old and I thought they could have given us something other than spinach. I have nothing against spinach, but I find it to be a cheap, throwaway excuse for a vegetable. Furthermore, they gave us four baby carrots?? Most people might not care, but that's my opinion. \n\nBut, the sins of the veggies were somewhat forgiven because of ICE CREAM. We asked for green tea, and it was not bad! Very refreshing way to end a filling dinner. \n\n-- INCREASINGLY BAD SERVICE -- \nHow do you take a fairly good meal and flip it upside down? Throw in horrendous service to the mix! From the moment we got seated to the second we left, the service here was SO BAD. For one thing, it took FOREVER for the workers to bring us anything. They forgot our rice, never gave us condiments, AND they asked us TWICE what soup we wanted. So much for coordination. Furthermore, they didn't even care to clean up the table next to us. I joked to my girlfriend that I could've taken the veggies that the customers next to us left over and no one would've noticed. UGH! The only redeeming moment was when one waitress seated us at a table instead of at the counter when a spot opened up. Except, that's what we ORIGINALLY ASKED FOR! BTW, 15% tip is already included in the charge - probably their precaution in case service is bad! \n\n-- CASUAL, BLAND ATMOSPHERE --\nIf you're looking for an intimate environment, Shabu House is probably not a good option. Nothing really stood out to me about the space, as it was quite dreary. At least it was spacious, but I'd come here purely to eat, not to relax.\n\nWhen you're planning a trip out here, I recommend taking public transportation since the parking situation can get pretty bad at night. Besides, there are plenty of bus stations around the area. The nice thing about Inner Richmond though, is that the neighborhood is much more peaceful than say the Sunset and so traveling here should be pretty smooth. \n\nIf I had to judge based on food alone, I thought this restaurant was quite decent. Even though the options were limited, and some of the ingredients were questionable, the Shabu here was good. Especially with the price ($26 with tip), I was pleased with the taste, portion size, and ICE CREAM. However, the service and atmosphere definitely left a lot on the table to say the least (no pun intended). Speaking of which, the workers probably wouldn't clean that up either. If you're craving Shabu Shabu and are in the Richmond area, this isn't a bad place per say. Just be prepared for meh treatment. All in all, I give Shabu House a \"Tolerable, sufficient for sustenance\" rating. \n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

It's my sister and brother-in-law's favorite shabu spot in the city, and I can see why: broth! freshness! AYCE!\n\nWe recently came here for my brother-in-law's birthday with a mixed group of his car friends, our family, and some family friends. Everyone enjoyed their meal. We had vegetarians who got the $24 AYCE veggie shabu, while everyone else opted for the traditional $34 meat shabu, which happens to come with a huge plate of veggies regardless. There's options to make your meal AYCD as well, which can get dangerous! Since it was a Monday, we opted for sake bombs and beers instead of the AYCD. Still fabulous. \n\nTHE FOOD\nThe broths are all delicious, but my favorite is the spicy miso. It's got so much richness and just the right amount of spice. I am not a vegetarian, but I ate vegetarian today (gotta watch that cholesterol, cuz steak :| ). I felt ok doing this because I knew that broth was going to be THAT good that I'd not feel like I was missing out. And I didn't at all! The chicken ginger broth is a little sweeter with more mild flavors. Also delicious, but spicy miso is where it's at for me. And there's a traditional hot water broth if that's your thing. You can see how huge the veggie plate is for vegetarians in my picture. I could not finish at all and ended up giving some to the meat side (even though they get unlimited veggies as well) so as not to waste it. If you do get the beef, you can choose between lamb, kurobata pork, and american style kobe beef. The kobe is delicious and so fresh. When you're done, you get a complimentary red bean or green tea ice cream -- perfect end to a wonderful meal. \n\nTHE SERVICE\nServers were friendly, attentive, and fast. They asked if we wanted more meat and veggies many times, and refilled our broths multiple times. Waters were refilled quickly too. They even brought out a candle for my brother-in-law so we could sing him into his mid-30's. \n\nOVERALL\nGreat place, great quality broth and ingredients, and great service.

It's true, Yelpers, Shabu House's AYCE deal is totally worth it. I went with a buddy who never had hot pot or Shabu Shabu in his life and even he was impressed with the food there. What I thought was great was that, unlike any other AYCE Shabu/hot pot places I've been to, our table's order of the meat isn't combined into the same collective tray. In other words, both my buddy and I got our own indivisible meat trays for our orders. I opted for the spicy miso broth while my friend got ginger chicken broth. Honestly, I wasn't too impressed with the taste of either since I thought they were too bland. The meat cuts were pretty thick and given in generous portions though. I absolutely loved the Kobe beef since the marbling was amazing through and through. In fact, I loved it so much that my dinner there kept me full for the entire day and a half afterwards. I even woke up in the middle of the night feeling like a cow was about to escape out from my mouth but it was so worth it.

On this evening, we waited 45 minutes for our table. The long, vertical interior included moderate lighting, TV, and a number of tables stacked against the wall to face the semi-open kitchen. Despite the presence of a dinner crowd, the atmosphere was casual, quiet, and subdued.\n\nWe first shared the large Beef and Pork Combo ($21.99) that came with our choice of spicy miso broth, thinly sliced beef and pork, cabbage, tofu, spinach, shiitake mushroom, enoki, udon, and steamed rice. The spicy miso broth was smooth and delicious. The meat was nicely marbled, and the sesame dipping sauce was a factor in layering the spicy, savory, and nutty flavors. However, the cookware took too long to heat up, which prompted the meat to take longer to cook for our super hungry dining companions. The veggies were also not neatly chopped or plated, and could come with more udon and shiitake mushrooms. \n\nWe also had the large Lamb and Pork Combo ($21.99) that came with our choice of ginger chicken broth, meat, assorted veggies, udon, and steamed rice. The ginger chicken broth carried a milder flavor and didn't offer the type of depth that was experienced in the spicy miso. The lamb was my favorite meat of the night. It was flavorful with a nice chew, and best to accompany the rich sesame sauce and sharp ponzu. This broth only started to taste better once it was cooked for an extended period of time.\n\nBy this time of the night, the cookware had started to overheat, giving us a different set of problems that took time to resolve at the table. Since service was absent, everything seemed very haphazard from start to finish.\n\nOur dinner also included a scoop of Green Tea and Azuki Ice Cream. The ice creams were smooth, creamy, with spot on flavors, but the scoops were also hollow and poorly presented. \n\nOur server initially underestimated the wait, and it was strange that we ended up getting a table that had been available the entire time we had been waiting. Additionally, service lacked attentiveness, and the overall quality of the food was not as compelling and precise as the other two locations.

I was visiting my boyfriend Robby in SF, and I'd never tried shabu shabu before so I insisted on going to Shabu House even though we weren't that hungry. The interior wasn't particularly impressive, but it was busy nonetheless so I had high hopes for the food.  We ended up ordering all-you-can-eat, and it included a giant platter of veggies, udon, rice, and ice cream.  For those of you interested, there's an all you can eat + drink option as well for an additional $12 per person, and it includes soft drinks, beer, sake, and more.\n\nThere were 3 soup bases total (traditional water, spicy miso, and ginger chicken), and the pot was split into two sections so we got to try two.  Traditional water sounded bland to me so we went with the spicy miso and ginger chicken.  Both were really yummy, but I definitely liked the ginger chicken better!  Robby enjoyed the miso more though so it worked out well for us, ha.\n\nOur waitress then brought us a nice assortment of veggies (carrots, napa cabbage, spinach, enoki mushrooms, and udon noodles) and we placed orders for meat, while waiting for our broths to boil. There were three meats available (American Style Kobe Beef, Lamb, and Kurobuta Pork), and since we got AYCE, we decided to try a plate of each.  They were all super delish, but I definitely enjoyed the lamb the most.  \n\nThe meat was sliced hella thin so it cooked quickly and was ridiculously tender.  Note: the AYCE special comes with unlimited rice, but I recommend passing on that and saving room for more Shabu. Oh, and out of the aforementioned veggies, the enoki mushrooms and napa cabbage were the best!  I definitely could've done without the spinach and carrots, but that's just me. \n\nIce cream was the perfect end to our nomtastic meal!  We got a scoop of green tea and red bean and shared between the two of us.  Both were solid choices - if you want something sweet, go for red bean.  If you prefer something creamier, go for green tea! BTW, gratuity is included so you don't have to worry about tipping unless you want to leave extra $$ for service.  Definitely check this place out if you live in or are visiting the Bay area! You get a lot of bang for your buck, and the quality's really quite good.", "author": "Kimberly K."}

I believe they have 3 (one of which is water). Water is what is traditionally used for Japanese shabu shabu, but I never get it here, because I'm afraid they won't use good konbu dashi or any at all. I usually stick to the miso or ginger chicken.\nFor people who say it's too expensive here, have you ever been to a Japanese supermarket? For the amount of meat I can consume here in one meal, I'm actual saving money. Yes, I do have to come hungry, but isn't that the purpose when you're looking for good ayce? Quality of meat is very nice here, no complaints at all.\nBoth dips are good, but I prefer the ponzu dip. Sesame dip is a little too sweet for me, that's just my preference though.\nThe only minor issues I've had here is that the servers sometimes forgets our order and we just have to ask again. I think one time, they came out with double the order, but we finished it all with no problem. The other issue is that if you try to raise the temp on your pot, the circuit breaker cuts off, and the server has to go to the back to turn it back on; just leave the switch as it is.\nAll in all, the place deserves a solid 4 star rating.\nTrust this Japanese dude here.

They also serve white rice as well that obviously pairs perfect with the meat.\n\nThe prices aren't bad and they also have an all you can eat option for $33.\n\nYou get either red bean or green tea ice cream as a dessert at the end of your meal if you get either the all you can eat option or entree.\n\nI would definitely come back again.", "author": "Garreth G."}

The servers here are also super attentive and nice -- Katie is my favorite!\n\nLike I said, this location is pretty good for parties of 2 as they have a ton of 2-seaters (which I think they can covert to 4-seaters with an extension thing). They also recently opened a tapioca place inside the restaurant, and you can order that to go with your meal if you'd like. I've yet to try the tapioca but have heard good things about it. There are plenty of TVs inside, so you can watch the game and enjoy your meal.\n\nMy go-to order is: spicy miso soup (you HAVE to get this) and a regular order of beef. The beef is always \"fresh,\" nicely marbled, and sliced super thin. If I'm feeling extra hungry, I'll go for the large. The lamb is also really good here -- it's never too gamey and the texture is never grainy. I've never had the pork, but my friends like it. If you like kabocha squash/pumpkin, you can ask for it!

I recently went again courtesy of a dinner Janice C set up.\n\nWe all toyed with the idea of going for the All you can eat option. It turns out I'm not the only one who can never eat enough to make AYCE worth it, so everyone decided to order their own plates instead.\n\nWe started off with some appetizers:\n-Agedashi tofu ($5.50)\n-Chicken kara-age ($5.50)\n-Carpaccio ($10)\n\nAll the apps were okay. I waited too long to try the Agedashi tofu so it got soggy sitting in the sauce. The Chicken kara-age was standard. The Carpaccio had too much going on for me. Too many toppings. I wanted it to be a little simpler.\n\nFor the main event, I went with the Large American style kobe beef for $20.49. Every plate comes with a side of veggies with udon, a bowl of rice or udon and green tea or red bean ice cream at the end of the meal. The kobe was well marbled and tender. Only about 5 seconds of swishing in the broth and you're good to go. Out of the two sauces, I like the ponzu doctored up with lots of green onion, garlic and daikon. I'm not a huge fan of sesame sauces and shabu, so I stuck with the ponzu.\n\nI also got a side of Enoki mushroom ($3.50) because I love them so! And Peter L got a side of Shiitake mushroom ($3.50). It's actually a good thing we didn't get AYCE since I only finished half my plate. I was happy that Rodney H was there to help me out. Thank you Rodney!\n\nSince Peter was there with me, we also ordered some sake. The \"Masumi\" Mirror of Truth. It was $39 for a 720ml bottle. The description of the sake said smooth and confident. I'd say that was very accurate. It went down smoothly. And with enough alcohol, you gain confidence, right? All kidding aside, I liked it since it was crisp and dry. :)\n\nI've always like the Shabu House on Geary, but it can get loud and crowded. This one's more quiet and low key which I like.

You know, the next morning when you see that your checking account has dwindled to $.01 or worse, you wake up next to a Ron Jeremy's doppelganger. All that double fisting at the bar didn't seem like an awesome idea after all.  \n\nOn Friday, I had the awesome idea of going to a charity happy hour on an empty stomach for a quick and cheap buzz. I ended up scurrying across the way to Safeway and came out with 2 corn dogs and 2 girthy taquitos...ALL for $2. YEEEE! I was stoked and was drunkenly told Mr. NSS, \"SEE! I know HOW to be frugal!\" He took a bite and said, \"WTF is this...the end of the week special?!?!\" Hey, I tried ok! Apparently, I'm banned from ever going to any store by myself when drunk. =X \n\nThe next awesome idea I had was for us to go to shabu after the charity HH. \"Let's go to the new Shabu House on Clement!\", I slurred. \n\nJust 3 weeks young, Shabu House on Clement is the fourth location of this SF Peninsula mini-chain. Parking is the worst at this location so come during non-peak dinner hours. \n\nI've been to all the other three locations. While the food is the same, the service and ambiance is not.\n\n*Geary street location (original): Always busy and consistently good.\n*Burlingame location: Spacious, hella youngins, and hella loud = drunktard central.\n*Ocean street location: Service is SO slow and it's hella small; it's their worst location. \n\nOne thing about Shabu House is despite the plethora of other shabu joints opening up in recent years, they're STILL the best when it comes to food quality. The meats are NEVER frozen and consistently top-notch. G-Cube in Outer Sunset use to be my second fav next to Shabu House on Geary but the last time I went, quality has went way down. Their meats broke into pieces upon picking up (pre-sliced and refrigerated). UGH. \n\nAt Shabu House, All-You-Can-Eat is $31 and All-You-Can-Drink is $42 (includes beer, house sake, and sodas). If you have a large appetite, the best deal is AYCE because Regular is $17.49 (+$12 add'l plate) and Large is $20.49 (+$15 add'l plate). You have a choice of Traditional Water Broth, Ginger Chicken or Spicy Miso broths. ALL MSG-FREE unlike other shabu places that use MSG. I always go with the Spicy Miso as it's flavorful with a nice kick. \n\nFor meats, they have American Style Kobe, Kurobuta Pork, and Lamb. All three are great but the Kobe is the best: http://bit.ly/1aHY4Sf! Intense marbling that just melts in your mouth after several swishes (no longer than 5-8 seconds) in the broth. The accompanying sesame and ponzu sauces are robust and a nice accompaniment to the meats and veggies.  \n\nTheir newest location didn't disappoint. Not only is the dining room huge and there's a plethora of TVs around for you to watch the game, the food is just as good as the Geary street location and the service was very attentive. The complimentary ice cream (choice of green tea or red bean) at the end was straight nasty though so go to Genki's down the block for dessert. However, what I loved about this location is it's not as busy at all. Either that or it was just slow on the night we went since everyone and their mama, baby's mama, and baby's daddy was and still are at EDC in Vegas. I'm guessing the latter. \n\nOf course, it was my awesome idea for all of us to do AYCE (if one person does it, the rest of the table has to), only we ate one plate a person and was forcing ourselves to finish our second order: http://bit.ly/130bCH5. Oppsie, I guess my eyes were bigger than my stomach. It was a bit of bill shock when it came out to $46/person after tax and tip. Not cheap for shabu but hey, you gotta pay for quality right?

We weren't super hungry so we opted for the non-AYCE (I believe it was $22) option, and it was just the right amount of food for us. However, if I was super hungry, I don't think this would've filled me up. I got the lamb w/ Spicy Miso, and the spicy miso base was yum! Usually I think shabu broth is really bland compared to Chinese hot pot bases, but the spicy miso base was pretty flavorful! The lamb was also really good. Seemed like great quality, and I liked how you could see them slicing the meats in the back.

Basically, there are 2 broth selections. How appetizing does traditional water sound? Ginger chicken and spicy miso were ok. They were good but not overwhelmingly flavorful. The restaurant does keep give you sides of the sesame dipping sauce and ponzu. They also supply each table with extra flavor adders like garlic, minced diakon, pepper oil, tamagari, and green onions.\n\nThe service was ok. Nothing extraordinary but nothing terrible. But get this, they offer a 15% discount only to add it BACK ON as a SERVICE FEE. When asked about the service fee, they said it's their tip.\n\nHere are my thoughts on tips. I am all for restaurants doing completely away with tips and just charging more and everyone gets better pay. But since this restaurant isn't one of the new waves than TIPS SHOULD BE EARNED. Now I was planning on tipping the standard 15% anyway but what grinds my gears is they gave me NO OPTION for deciding how much I wanted to tip nor did they give me an option to decide whether they deserved one or not. Not only do they charge you 15% for tips but they have the audacity to still ask for tips in the form of a gratuity line. So you can tip MORE just not less than 15%. And don't bait and switch me with the BS of a 15% happy hour only to charge it back in a different shape or form.\n\nFor the dishonesty of this establishment and workers, they get 2 stars.

I go in on a tuesday evening during happy hour and there were about 4 other parties throughout our meal. We ordered one large beef and a regular lamb with ginger chicken broth.\n\nWasn't too impressed by my cuts of lamb. Almost half of it was fat and there were splotches of round shaped blood vessels. The udon was also getting old or too frozen. I'm not sure how they get their udon but it's usually already cooked and refrigerated but my udon was soggy to the point where when I put it in the broth, I couldn't leave it in there for more than 5 seconds and even then, it tasted mushy and overcooked (without being hot). The lettuce was also pourly cut and served. Most of my end pieces had black dirt specks (which I don't mind too much eating since it's pretty impossible to cut those out but couldn't they have not served those pieces?).\n\nThe bar seating tables had really annoying boilers. I don't know if it's to conserve energy but it seems to higher itself so your broth boils and then 5 seconds later, lower the heat so your broth is completely still. I prefer my shabu to have a nice simmer or low boil at all times (is that too princess like?). \n\nService was good maybe because we were sitting at the bar and right in front of the register where the employees like to hang out to check their phones/schedules/register.", "author": "Lauren K."}

For the broth, I shared a 50/50 pot of spicy miso with ginger chicken broth.  They both taste very different but if I were to come back, I'd go the ginger chicken broth because the meat and veggies cooked in there tasted cleaner and I could taste the meat.  They also give you ponzu and a peanut dipping sauce for your choice.  My coworker actually mixed the two together to make a ponzu peanut sauce...crazy but she's got her system and who am I to judge right?\n\nThe service is not too attentive since usually we are busy just cooking the food, eating the food, and repeat.  After a while, I learned that it's easier to pick meat from the top and not the bottom and that you have to take inventory of your stomach space before eating another plate.  Because food doesn't so great when you are trying to finish your plate of uncooked meat and your stomach is already maxed out.\n\nI wasn't sure if my sweats were the dreaded \"meat sweats\" but I did leave satisfied and happy.

Only three waitresses covering a giant resteraunt but still kept up with my every need!\n\nAshley, Michelle, and Shelly were their names, which i asked for because they just need the props for managing the hailstorm of customers.\n\nThey were very friendly, always smiled and were very polite despite the obvious rush they were constantly in.\n\nOh, the non meat items are great too. Super high quality udon that was very springy, and well soaked shiitake mushrooms that are practically fresh. (Hell they might've been) \n\nOverall my gf and I had a great time here, 10/10 would come again.", "author": "MingYang L."}

I love both the sauces here - I let the meat/veggies cool a bit in the ponzu sauce, then lightly dip it in the sesame sauce. DELICIOUS.\n\nNot the best shabu shabu I've had, but I LOVED the service we had here. I made a reservation for 8 for my boyfriend's birthday on a week night. We brought in our own cake - a lot of places charge for that. I don't really understand how some places can charge $3+/person for bringing your own cake, but Shabu House doesn't charge at all! Anyway, I called ahead to ask them about their cake policy, and they asked me for so many details! Ice cream/regular, when to bring out the cake, who the birthday boy was...I loved it. I knew it would be an awesome experience already.\n\nGreat food, great service, and so accommodating. They checked on us several times, ignored our annoying sake bombs, took a couple group photos for us, sang Happy Birthday, and cut the cake for us. Our whole group was thoroughly impressed by how great we were treated. Thanks, Shabu House!", "author": "Lisa N."}

The cuts of the meat were fantastic. The food came with two dipping sauces. One was a soy based sauce and the other was some sesame sauce. Both good. Our meal came with a choice of red bean ice cream or green tea ice cream for dessert. Perfect way to end a great meal.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant for great shabu.

Interior is clean, and the tables are pretty spaced out so you're not bumping into surrounding tables like the other location.\n\nI always go for their spicy miso broth, which is just the right amount of spicy for me: a little kick, but not to the point where I'm coughing. As for the meats, I can comfortably finish the large portion of meat, but cannot possibly stuff myself enough to justify doing the AYCE. For people with a larger appetite, their AYCE probably a cheaper way to go. Their veggies are plentiful, much more so than a lot of other shabu places.  AND you get noodles AND rice. Of course there's always room for complimentary dessert, and you have a choice between green tea and red bean ice cream; I suggest getting both.\n\nStaff was very warm and welcoming.

The Kobe Ribeye is by far the most mouth watering meat they have, after a minute or two in the hot miso broth of your choice, it melts in your mouth! It's endless veggies and meat until your stomach can't take it! They give you a side of rice and have freshly chopped garlic and green onions on the table for you to spruce up your broth.

Actually, it is the worst I've ever experienced.\n\nI ate in with two more friends. FYI, there were only another one table of two people and 4-5 people at the bar to take care of (there were 4 waitresses working tonight). We sat and ate there for over an hour and never got any attention. When we needed more napkin, spices, or water or even to order something more, no waitresses came by to take care of us. We needed to look for them and very quickly waved once someone    got to walk close by and beg for the service. I think it's ridiculous if you sell the food this pricey and will have no service at all. It's even worse when you see that the waitresses were busy chatting to each other. \n\nWe eat here often and this place is always the first choice for us to have Shabu. Also, we usually tip not less than 20 percents.\nBut from now, I need to think again about going to this place or I might need to pray before going there  just so I might get lucky enough to have service from them.\nThis visit, we thought about giving 3 cents to them but couldn't do that. We still gave them almost 20 percents of the price for that bad service because we still love them. Even then, when we were getting out of the place, no body paid attention at us. We didn't get any \"thank you\" from anybody. Hmmm.. maybe it's our false to expect too much from you guys.\n\nTo the owner, \nWe love your tasty and high quality of the food but if you let the service continue to be this bad, actually worse than cheap Chinese restaurants, it will gradually destroy your business.\nThere are more new Shabu restaurants opened up down the streets.

When I knew I had a short work day, I made plans accordingly with my family and messaged everyone that we are going to Shabu when I get off work.  When we got there it took us one round to find parking and it was about one block away around 7pm.  The place looks clean and trendy and the server was normal, not out of this world great but not bad either.  They automatically add gratuity to parties that are 5 or more which when I was a server back in the days was not really legal, you can suggest it but I'm not sure if you can really automatically add gratuity, well we usually type 20 percent and they just added 15 percent so I guess it's fine.  So we got the all you can eat and the food was really good.  The sauce went well with the meats and vegetables.  We probably did two rounds of meats and veggies and then we are until we couldn't move.  It was very satisfying.  The meat tastes fresh and the vegetables were nice and fresh as well.", "author": "Austi And London's Mommy N."}

At the best, I enjoy eating meat from Nijiya and enjoying shabu shabu in company of guests, with my own eclectic array of soup bases, vegetables, and other extras. At the least, I like shabuway with it's clean soup and solid quality meat. \n\nCame here due to the great reviews on yelp, and instantly dived in with an all you can eat. Had the ginger chicken broth, which was decent. But the meat quality that they served was terrible. Sadly, they have a policy that everyone at the table had to eat all you can eat. I had confidence that I could eat both plates, but with the quality of meat that they serve, I had to force myself to even eat half my plate. \n\nThe waitress was extremely gracious enough to offer a \"cut of meat\" that was their best. The thing is, they only have 4 meat types. So where did this magic meat selection come from. My suspicion is that for the AYCE, the meat quality was specifically bad just to maximize their profits. AYCE is $32 per person, for that price I could have enjoyed good food at many other options out there. \n\nIt's a shame. This place had great spacing, good seating for large groups, friendly waitresses, was clean, and I was hoping to find a place to host some event dinners, but this place's food was beyond terrible. \n\nTL;DR: the meat here is terrible.

In the end, we only ate the portion of two large. All in a nutshell, we paid the price of two AYCE when we ate the portions of two large. I think a better tip would be to inform the customers on how big the portions are before they order so they won't regret it like me!  \n\nThe food, on the other hand, was good! The meats had the fresh taste. I especially liked the lamb. \n\nDespite that disappointment, I had two flavors of ice cream! (Thanks to the guy, perhaps he might have been the manager?)

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-17", "description": "This is the best shabu place in the city that I've tried so far. It's delicious, spacious, and the service is fantastic. \n\nMost of the times I've gone - even on nights on the weekend - we haven't had to wait for a table for two. For the times we did have to wait, we only had to wait about 10 minutes when we got there just around the start of dinner time. Usually when we finish, there is a sizeable group of people waiting, so I'd suggest going a little earlier, like maybe 6:00 or 6:30. Unlike the original Shabu House on Geary, this place has plenty of tables for small and large groups. They also have a bar facing TVs - perfect when you want to enjoy some shabu while you watch a game.\n\nThe service is super prompt. They put down the sauces and everything even before you sit down. And the broth comes out right when you order it, so by the time the meat comes out (which is soon after), the broth will have gotten going and you don't have to wait too long for it to boil.\n\nThe food is great - super fresh and delicious. They don't have a whole lot of options, which is maybe why some people don't like it, but the limited options allow service to be quicker. And the quality is so good that I can't really complain. I always get the ginger chicken broth. It's super tasty even when you drink it on its own. And on a cold night, it warms you up perfectly. I've tried the regular beef, lamp, and pork and all were great. They're thinly sliced and cook in seconds. They taste fresh and clean, unlike some other shabu or hot pot places where you feel kind of nasty after eating it. All the dishes come with a standard vegetable platter with napa cabbage, enoki mushroom, udon, and spinach. I've also had the vegetarian option, and I really enjoyed that too. In addition to more napa cabbage and enoki mushroom, they also have pumpkin. It doesn't seem like a lot of food, but in the end you will be STUFFED.\n\nThe only sauces they offer are ponzu and peanut, but I like mixing those together with the sesame oil, green onions, and garlic that they have. It's still not too heavy, but adds a lot of flavor.", "author": "Jamie C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-12-09", "description": "I have been a fan of Shabu House for a really long time; had my first try at the Geary location many many years ago and loved it. Then, started going to the Ocean location and again, loved it. Never ever had a bad experience. Last week was my first time at this new Clement location. First of all, I went with a group of 22 and next to us, was a group of at least 15 and we were all friends. That's 37 people's business this restaurant is having in one sitting! At $31 a piece, if we only ordered the all you can eat part, that'll be at least $1,147 worth of business, before tax and their 18% tip. With that said, let's just say, about 35% of us ordered all you can drink as well. \n\nNow, here's my problem: they decided to charge us for 4 extra all you can drink. Actually, they first walked over to us when we were about to pay and told us, we have cameras and we saw 2 people drinking, who shouldn't be drink, so we're going to charge you 2 extra. We asked who it was so at least they would know to pay the extra. They pointed out 2 people, that the entire party can vouch for, that absolutely DID NOT drink one drop. One of them did touch the bottle though and help pour the shots, just because he was done eating, but again, didn't drink 1 drop, but OK, fine, we'll comply because we don't want an extra $22 (SERIOUSLY, $22) ruin our night. We drank and chatted some more and the bill comes back and they actually charged us 4 extra. FOUR. You had said TWO! Mind you the extra all you can drink is an extra $11 per person. This is an extra $44 that this restaurant is willing to lose everyone's business for. Seriously? I mean, ok fine, those who didn't pay shouldn't have been drinking in the first place, but at least, be nice about it and inform the group, OR those who were actually drinking when they shouldn't be and say, we saw you drinking so we're going to charge you for the all you can drink. DO NOT just surprise us with the bill. \n\nWith all that said, I agree that some of the people in the group are at fault, but I am very surprised at how management had handled this. I'm pretty sure we were not the first group to have people drink when they didn't order the all you can drink. This will definitely be the first and last time I'm going to this Clement location.\n\nP.S. -and if you must know what I thought about the meat, it was nicely marbled. It wasn't melt in my mouth delicious, nor was it sliced as thinly as I wanted, but it was decent. Spicy miso broth was alright, not as flavorful as I wanted. I can barely eat spicy so I was pretty wary about it, but this was not spicy at all. On top of that, the broth quickly lost all its flavor after about 5 pieces of meat was put into it. We asked if we could just have the spicy miso powder/stuff so we can add more flavor to it. They said the soup's all pre-made. I won't deny you that it's pre-made, but I am positive you've got some spicy miso powder/stuff in the back. Your soup wasn't made at the Geary location and then shipped over here was it? They did change out our pot of soup though for a new pot, but same problem, 5 pieces of meat later, it just became another meat juice tasting pot of liquid.\n\nP.P.S. -we were trying to take a group picture at the end and one of the waitresses kept jumping into our picture. SERIOUSLY. You're a waitress. Do you job. We're not friends. Go away! Now, my friends' birthday group photo has her face in it and we are NOT happy!\n\nP.P.S. -excuse my super long essay.", "author": "Jessica L."}

Also, I triple checked this was the right shabu house.  \n\nI've been here before so I know the food is good, but they've done this twice now.", "author": "Jordan L."}

The vegetables and meat always  fresh and the service is great as well. I confident this place will always deliver a great shabu shabu experience!", "author": "Esther K."}

The spicy miso broth is also great, though I wish it was a little more flavorful. Each dinner entree comes with the standard vegetable platter. The service is also great. I had a great meal here (with complementary green tea ice cream), and would come back here whenever I visit SF again.", "author": "Alan Y."}

Our kids loved the shumai and we ordered the lamb with spicy miso broth and ginger chicken broth every week (no joke).  We're really going to miss this restaurant as there is no Shabu House in San Luis Obispo.", "author": "Lena E."}

BIG MISTAKE.\n\nWe were greeted as we went in and the place was fairly slow. Sat down and looked at the menu which was the same as the Ocean and Geary locations nothing special. We ordered all you can eat shabu. Despite the place being empty, service was slow. After we finished the beef, we requested for more and the waitress asked would we like some vegetables also. Sure why not, it comes with the meal anyways. Waited 10 minutes before the vegetables came out but no beef. I gave them an additional 15 mins before asking again and the waitress said they were still cutting it. After waiting for a total of 30 mins to bring out 1 plate of beef, I was already getting full from the vegetables. The meat quality was not very good and tasted old. Kind of reminds me of clothes in the closet that you never wear. Looks like it was pre-cut and put back into the freezer then brought back out to thaw. Hence the long wait times.\n\nService was mediocre. The employees was inattentive to customers after they seat you. Took a while before someone took our orders. Maybe they were busy playing with their smartphones.", "author": "EvoPowers M."}

Not just because I love shabu, but they have great quality meat and great service also. It also includes ice cream of (usual) two choices. The waiters paid a lot of attention to what we need while me and my friend were having dinner, Highly recommended.", "author": "Sherly T."}

But this location has excellent meat I had both the Kobe and Pork and both were fairly thick and well marbled. The sauces were very good and surprisingly the service was spot on. I've read complaints in which some people said that they were given attitude for eating too much during the 2 hours, but I didn't experience that, I could have kept ordering but after 3 plates of meat I was full! I hardly touched the rice or vegetables and crammed it all in. I'd definitely will go again.", "author": "N A."}

The broth tasted different.. Service was horrible. It took them awhile to take our order, but the food came out quick. But why wouldn't it right? It's not cooked, just sliced up. Getting our check took FOREVER, seriously. We were sitting there for so long trying to wave down the waitresses who were all looking away. Finally got our check, waited another 5 min for THE MANAGER to come and pick up our check, then even longer to get it back! It wasn't even busy. Never coming back. I will stick to the ocean or Burlingame locations.", "author": "Jane C."}
