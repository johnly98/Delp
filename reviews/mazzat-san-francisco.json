The food is amazing I have had a few of the apps and the wraps are always a very great and filling bet. \nThe haloumi cheese appetizer is probably my favorite and really like the hummus with it as a complement. \nI also really like how nice the people are here. I left the 2nd half of my wrap in the to go container and forgot it on my table. I was a few blocks away when I realized and ran back but they had just thrown it away.

We came here on a whim and will easily be adding it to our \"nah, let's go somewhere we know an love\" list of San Francisco restaurants.\n\nThe Mazzat Platter (as other Yelp reviews will tell you) is the way to go, and takes your dollar the furthest. You can select three cold Mazzat of which I recommend:\n\n1) the Hummus Harr - delicious homemade hummus with a little something extra;\n2) the Labne - cheese with incredibly zesty zaater; and\n3) the Babaghanouge - roasted eggplant with tahini, garlic, and other flavors.\n\nAnd you can select three warm Mazzat, of which I recommend:\n\n1) Fatet Batinjan - my goodness, this is amazing. The pita croutons give this fried eggplant an extra crisp to it. If I could, I'd order three of these;\n2) Foul Madummas - fava beans with garlic and olive oil; and\n3) Halloumi Cheese - who can say no to Halloumi cheese?\n\nBut, to be fair, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The Zaatar Pita (Thyme) is also a delicious entree choice, as well as the lentil soup (made for vegans!)\n\nI cannot emphasize enough how much I love, LOVE, that Mazzat has so many options for vegetarians. Come here for date night, come here with friends - this cozy and adorable restaurant will fill your soul and fill your stomach.", "author": "Sejal D."}

He made reservations for 8 of us at 8 PM on a Saturday night - it was a good thing he made reservations, as the place was packed. We were seated right away and the service throughout our way was phenomenal. \n\nWe opted to do their $20/per person special which included our choice of 3 hot and 3 cold dishes for the table to share (every person at the table must agree to do this deal or else you can't do it). The best part: they scale their portion size for the size of the party. Although there were 8 of us, everyone got to try every single dish and there was enough for seconds (and even thirds!). \n\nAll of the food was outstanding. I don't recall every dish we ordered but I remember loving all of them. The fried cheese and hummus with beef were two of my favorites. And the servers kept bringing fresh, warm pita when we ran out. The whole experience was tremendous. I only wish I lived closer to Mazzat to come to eat here more often.", "author": "Courtney P."}

The menu is really expansive as well with options that are both vegetarian and carnivore friendly. \n\nThe staple that we order every time is the batata harra (these spicy fried potatoes that are meant to share but I can totally finish by myself). It's a huge hit with anybody I go with! The classic hummus is also great, and it comes with a super fluffy pita that rivals Oren's Hummus Shop down in South Bay. \n\nThe staff is also so cheery, and the service is quick.

It's a cute little place in Hayes Valley that serves delicious Mediterrean food.  There is a sampler for $20 a person where you can choose 3 hot dishes and 3 cold dishes.

Vegetarians would go nuts for this place as most dishes offered are vegetarian and even though I am not a vegetarian, I would totally consider it after this place.  Warm pita is served with the dishes and serves as a wonderful vessel for all the wonderful food.  Would highly recommend the egg plant with fried pita chips on top, so flavorful and probably my favorite dish.  There is a hot potato dish that was delicious, had a little kick but not too spicy.  Would recommend the olives and pickled veggies as it added a nice crisp coolness to everything else we were eating.  Honestly I don't think you could go wrong with any dish here, I hope you like egg plant because most dishes are egg plant based.  I think 4 out of the 6 dishes we ordered were egg plant!

My entree was quite delicious, chicken thighs were moist and well seasoned as well as a nice rice medley. However, my boyfriends Bamia was actually quite bland.

The spicy hummus harr was smooth and tasty (though a bit on the watery side), the labne (yogurt cheese) was thick and creamy, and both of these went so well with the basket of pita bread on the side. The ouzi was a delicious rice dish (with a yogurt/cucumber sauce on the side) mixed with ground beef and lamb, and it had a very distinct cinnamony flavor from the spices. I was a big fan of the Mazzat salad, a simple combination of feta, parsley, and tomatoes. The fatet batinjan (fried eggplant in yogurt sauce with pita croutons) I found rather flavorless, and the arnabeet (fried cauliflower) was unfortunately soggy and overcooked.

I liked it even though a couple of the 6 Mazzats sampled weren't very good and the other four were only decent.  I liked it regardless of the fact that there wasn't a single thing I (or anyone at my table) raved over.  \n\nThat's saying something.  \n\nWhat I liked about it - and why I'd even return to it - is this:\n\n*  A $45 bottle of Lebanese red wine was quite perfect\n\n*  The Mazzat Platter ($20/person) was a nice shared dish that allowed us to sample 6 different menu items (3 hot/3 cold) of our choice.  I like trying a lot of things. \n\n*  Though the food wasn't best in class I found it both satisfying and well-priced.  \n\n*  The service was mellow and excellent.  On a weeknight three of us walked in and pretty much held down our table for the entire evening with no pressure to move along or purchase  more.  \n\nHey look, you didn't even need to read between the lines.  \n\nMazzat is a good place from which to enjoy wine and food, less a destination restaurant than one that's good enough for a weeknight with friends.  It's a bit away from the crowds of Hayes Street but near enough that it wouldn't be a bad place to dine before or after a Civic Center event.  Add it to your list of \"maybes\" for those times you're in that area looking for something that's good enough.", "author": "Tracey A."}

The place is smaller and we knew we'd have to wait for a table but because we didn't have a reservation and didn't want to sit at the bar (after we were asked to), we felt we were treated slightly rudely, like an inconvenience. We were a party of 3 and squeezed into a 2 person table, had to wave down a server to take our order, and didn't receive any food (which I believe this mezze type should come out in waves) for 25 - 30 minutes. Then the cherry on top was \"we'd really appreciate if you can pay in cash.\" \n\nFor our meal, we ordered the following: \n- hummus, large portion, very tasty;  \n- Fatet Batinjan - eggplant with yogurty sauce and fried pita chips - really recommend and again really nice portion for 3 - 4 people to share; \n-  fried cheese - 3 square pieces; not my favorite as I liked more the melty cheese but just a preference. It worked nicely to cut into chunks and put on pita with some dip; \n- Mazzat Salad - parsley, tomatoes, and feta - tasty and refreshing - recommend \n- Falafel - Five nice size pieces, tasty and perfectly fried. One of my favorites and I recommend. \n- Chicken shwarma - We really wanted some meat and didn't realize this place is mostly vegetarian with a 2 ground beef/lamb dishes which my friend isn't a fan of. The shwarma is really big and unfortunately (service related) came out at the very end probably 15 - 20 minutes after our other dishes so by that time we were full and didn't really have room so we ended up taking home. \n\nOverall, with an $18 corkage fee and lots of food, the total bill was $80 which we were shocked by so for the price point I couldn't have asked for more but the service I just felt didn't warrant a great review.", "author": "Aryn C."}

Yeah I know that's wrong in so many ways, but it just comes out of my mouth without warning much like everything else I say. However, my malaprop didn't dampen my long-standing desire to try this unassuming place on the corner of Fell and Laguna because I'm always on the lookout for interesting Middle Eastern fare in this city. Tuba and Anar are good, so is Wally's Cafe in Emeryville which serves Lebanese specialties, too. I didn't know Mazzat was owned by the same folks who own Mazza Luna on Van Ness, which was too dark and clubby for my taste (review: http://bit.ly/1Qv2i0Z).\n\nMazzat is also on the dark side but with a bit more family-friendly vibe given the diners I saw when I entered the place early on a Thursday evening. Usually it looks packed in the compact space, but it was more inviting with just a couple of tables occupied. I was seated closer to the back where it was pretty quiet, but that didn't stop the server from being quite attentive. there were a lot of appetizing choices in the menu though it was a bit pricier than I expected. I started modestly with the $8 serving of Lentil Soup which was rich and delicious, almost like a cream of mushroom soup but purely vegan (photo: http://bit.ly/1TwnPvr). It came with a generous supply of grilled pita bread that I found hard to resist (photo: http://bit.ly/1RYkntM).\n\nFor my entree, I went with the $18 Bamia, which was a velvety-looking stew with sauteed green okra and bits of lamb swimming in a shimmering, darkened tomato sauce mixed with fried garlic (photo: http://bit.ly/1oEmXdb). It was tasty though probably more saucy than I was wanting for a main dish. It was helpful that it came with a good portion of jasmine rice on the side, which I promptly scooped up and dunked into the stew in spoonfuls like it was a Japanese curry dish (photo: http://bit.ly/1Qzc74d). It was solid country-style food nicely presented though nothing that fancy. I'd definitely recommend it those on the flexitarian side who don't want a lot of meat for dinner but plenty of familiar Middle Eastern flavors.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...tasty, unadorned Lebanese dishes for a hearty appetite\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...comfortable enough when they aren't busy but kinda dark\nSERVICE - 4 stars...quite attentive considering the other parties were high maintenance\nTOTAL - 4 stars...OK, I'll stop calling it 'Hazmat' now", "author": "Ed U."}

As most people seem to do here, we had a combination of hot and cold appetizers-- hummus (duh), fatet batinjan (SO GOOD), tabouli (generously and rightly seasoned with lemon), and batata harra (just really good potatoes). For main courses we tried the lamb and the vegetarian one. The only thing that was only ok imo was the vegetarian main course-- most of the lentils had soaked into the rice so and we wanted more lentils!

We went at around 6:30 and were seated instantly, since it seems to be a small corner restaurant. There were some people inside, but it wasn't too loud, and I liked that the ambiance was close and warm :)\n\nBased on a lot of suggestions, we got the Mazzat platter, which is a set of 3 Hot and 3 Cold dishes. For two people, it was a lot of food, and we had plenty leftovers to take home....we also got extra pita because we ran out of bread before running out of anything else, so I guess it was a decent price at $20 per person. \n\nHot Dishes:\n1. Hummus with Beef: The hummus was pretty good, and I liked that there were full chickpeas and pine nuts in it, although now I kind of wish we had gotten the Hummus Harr instead. I found it to be pretty standard, nice hummus.\n2. Fatet Batinjan: This was surprisingly my favorite hot dish by far, especially considering I am usually a very carnivorous diner.... The croutons were sooo good, and the crunch contrasted well with how soft the eggplants were. It was seasoned nicely and really hit the spot for that burst of unique flavor that I was craving.\n3. Ouzi: This was okay. It wasn't that much rice, and I think it was pretty soft and flavorful, but it wasn't mind-blowing. I usually don't like lamb because I find it gamey, but there wasn't anything about this dish that bothered me either, so I guess that was a plus!\n\nCold Dishes:\n1. Tabouli: Um....I don't remember this one super well.....so I'm assuming it was neither amazing nor distasteful, but there was a lot going on that platter, and my focus was definitely directed at the Fatet Batinjan and the Shankaleesh, really...\n2. Mutabal: I think this was pretty good. It was a unique, fruity-sweet flavor and added a nice contrast to the mostly savory dishes we had on our platter. \n3. Shankaleesh: I was surprised that this was my favorite cold dish! It was pretty salty, but sooo, soo good. I think this one was one I might crave in the future. I just liked how all the flavors matched so well together, and it balanced nicely with the pita.\n\nThe pita, by the way, was awesome. Served nice and warm, they were cut in to wedges, and kind of chewy when biting in to them. I get a little hungry when I think about it.", "author": "Diane J."}

Butchering through your order order because you don't know how to pronounce the names of dishes.\n\nMazzat has a good selection of interesting Lebanese/Mediterranean food--beyond the usual hummus-kebab-wrap into the realm of multi-dimensional spices and herbs.\n\nAfter scrutinizing the menu and thinking through several family style ways to order, we concluded the most cost-effective option was the Mazzat platter, which gives you a choice of 3 hot and 3 cold mazzat (appetizers). At $20/person, the Mazzat platter is on the upper end of the price range for a standard dinner but is a great way to sample all their creations. (Also, it abides by the rule of thumb that you can't go wrong ordering what the restaurant is named after.)\n\nThe spoils:\n\n3 cold mazzat:\n(++) Hummus harr (chickpeas mixed with garlic, lemon juice, chili paste, tahini, topped with fried pine-nuts): Pretty good hummus, made even better with the toppings. Has a kick from the chili but could use more spice.\n(+/-) Makdous (tangy stuffed eggplant with walnuts, red pepper, garlic and olive oil): Fascinated because I've never seen this before. The eggplants and walnuts make an interesting combination but was very very salty.\n(++) Warek enab (grape leaves stuffed with rice cooked with olive oil and lemon juice): Nice robust, pungent grape leaf flavor.\n\n3 hot mazzat:\n(++) Mosaka with beef (eggplants topped with homemade garlic tomato sauce): Probably the least adventures, but hearty and satisfying.\n(++) Arnabeet (fried cauliflower topped with garlic and lemon juice): Reminds me of fried bar food, but the garlic and lemon juice are a great addition.\n(++) Ouzi (jasmine rice cooked with ground lamb and beef in special spice blend, topped with pine nuts and almonds): Mmm, aromatic goodness. The spice blend is borderline rogue, the pine nuts and almonds add an extra layer of nutty earthiness, and the soft ground lamb and beef in rice are pillow-soft. Odd description, I know, but perhaps that's why I'm a self-proclaimed Yelp food blogger rather than an actual food critic.\n\n(+) Complimentary pita: Fresh, warm, and soft. I recommend mixing and matching! Well... except maybe for the grape leaf wraps would not fare the best with pita. Otherwise, pita + hummus + other mazzats are DIY fun (sort of like charcuterie board finger food) because you never know exactly what to expect.\n\nService and ambiance were good, not too busy on a weekend night even at peak dinner time. Mazzat definitely satisfied my curiosity and I would recommend it for any foodie's SF bucket list, though for my everyday, peasant-level Mediterranean food staple I think I will stick with simple shawarma wraps at local delis. Then I can save $ and splurge on more fancy new places :3 Hehe, life of a foodie on a budget.", "author": "Edna C."}

While ordering we made the server aware of our opera time constraints.  We were assured that nothing we ordered would take too long.  Indeed we had plenty of time to enjoy the good food before having to be back at the Opera house for the 6:30 pm pre-show lecture. \n\nThe menu is very interesting, but was intrigued us was the combination appetizer platter.  If everyone at the table will order the same thing, it is a good deal for $20/person and gives you a choice of a total of 6 dishes (3 hot and 3 cold).

Our bill was over $60 for two people and it was SOOOOO not worth it!\n\nBecause the server was not candid with us, we over-ordered and could not take leftovers as we were not going straight home. What a waste of food and money!!\n\nOk, now that I have described the bad experience, let's get to the food. The food was mediocre. There's a much better middle eastern restaurant in Walnut Creek that you could feed 6 people for the price we paid for one dinner here AND the food is much better. \n\nWe got the mazzat platter with hummus with beef, cauliflower, falafel, baba ghanoush, stuffed eggplant, and stuffed grape leaves. The hummus, cauliflower, and baba ghanoush are the only items I'd get again - they were pretty good. Here's why I wouldn't get the other 3: the falfel was a little stale and chewy (yuk!), the stuffed eggplant is pickled and WAYYYYY too salty - so salty I couldn't finish it, and the grape leaves were decent - I might get them again, actually.\n\nWe also tried the kefta - don't waste your time. It's bland and not a big portion size for $18. \n\nThis restaurant must have high rent and not enough customers to charge the prices they do.\n\nSo, the takeaways: try this place if you want (I am not putting my seal of approval on it, hence the 2-star review) but don't let them scam you with the mazzat platter! If you do go, try the hummus (I liked it with beef), baba ghanoush, and cauliflower (and maybe the grape leaves).", "author": "Jess A."}

I would recommend a reservation even for 2 people. I think that the Mazzat Platter is a great way to sample the menu the first time. It is $20 per person, the entire party has to get it and includes 3 hot items and 3 cold items with no exception. We had kebbeh, mosaka and arnabeet as our 3 hot items, and rahib, Mazzat salad and kabees as our cold items. We enjoyed all of our items and it went well with our low carb diet.

My fianc\u00e9 and I arrived with no reservations at 6:30pm and was told that it would be a 45 minute wait. Not too shabby since we wanted to walk around Hayes Valley beforehand. We came back about 20 minutes when the waiter saw us waiting outside and asked if we were okay with the bar seating. Sweet - so we took the offer, but noted for next time, to call and make the reservations.\n\nInterior: The inside of the restaurant is pretty small - about 10+ tables and a bar counter that seats 4 people. The kitchen is so small and viewable (next to the bar).\n\nFood: We ordered the Mazzat platter (feeds 2 people at $20/person), which came with 3 cold and 3 hot mazzat of your choice and served with hot, fresh pita bread. For cold, we ordered the Hummus Harr, Babaghanouge, and Shankaleesh. For hot, we ordered Halloumi Cheese, Batata Harra, and Falafel. All was delicious! My favorite was the Hummus Harr, Batata Harra, and Shakaleesh! Surprisingly, when I first saw the basket of pita bread, I thought that it wouldn't be enough. But no, this restaurant already knows how it works and provided the perfect amount of pita bread. The Mazzat platter did feed for 2 people exactly and had us walking out of there happily full and satisfied.\n\nDrinks: I had their Mint Lemonade and it was refreshing and delicious. Next time I would love to try their Lebanese tea with mint.\n\nThe only thing I would give feedback to the restaurant is probably to have more menus. It took a good 10-15 minutes after we were seated to get them. I think it was because everyone at other tables were taking their time looking at the menu so there weren't enough for everyone in the full, packed restaurant. However, the bartender was great on serving us water right when we sat down - so points on that.", "author": "Kelly T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-03-26", "description": "The food was okay. The one star is really for the service that we experienced while dining here. I walked in around 6:30 and didn't have a reservation. The hostess I spoke to pointed to a table for 2 and told me that we could sit there, if we would be able to leave at 7:45. That was over an hour away so I figured that was doable -- yes, it was strange to me that she put a time limit on my dinner but I really didn't want to have to wait for another table. So I sit down and my friend arrives shortly afterwards. We placed our order and proceeded to chat, order and eat the food (which, might I add, took quite a while to arrive). At one point I realized that I hadn't been checking the time, and looked at my phone. It said 8:00 pm, so I mentioned to my friend that it was past 7:45, but since no one had approached us about finishing up, it must not have been a big deal.\n\nFast forward to us ordering some Turkish coffee to wrap up our meal. We are drinking out of our little cups when suddenly our whole table is cleared and we are left with the check. They took the coffee pot, which was still half full of coffee, away from us while we were still drinking it! It was so bizarre and we called over the hostess from the beginning to ask her if they could bring it back, since we weren't done with it. She responded with, \"We don't do to go cups for coffee.\" I explained to her that we weren't asking for to go cups... we just wanted it right now at the restaurant. After she repeated her reply a second time, it dawned upon me what was happening. She was passive aggressively letting us know that our time was up (no more end-of-dinner coffee for us, yikes!!) and that we should leave the restaurant. She then turned to me and said \"I told you that you had to leave here at 7:45. You are still here.\" I couldn't believe it. She was punishing us for not obeying her orders? My friend told her that she could have reminded us once it hit 7:45 (I promise we are not bad people -- we would have left at that point if she had reminded us. We honestly just forgot, and when it didn't come up again, we didn't think anything of it). She turned to her to say, \"Well, I told your friend 7:45 at the beginning,\" and then turned back to me and said, very rudely, \"Did you not say 7:45?\" \n\nAt this point I felt so attacked by her rudeness that I simply apologized. I did genuinely feel bad if I inconvenienced her by forgetting to leave her restaurant at EXACTLY 7:45 pm, but honestly I've never had a hostess act like this towards me before so I didn't really know what to say. At this point, my friend tells her we're leaving and she walks away. I have never felt so anxious and attacked at a restaurant before. The passive aggressiveness really was unnecessary and I wish that I had just said no to her when she told me we needed to leave the table at a specific time.", "author": "Maheen S."}

Since she knows much more about Middle Eastern food than me I'm deferring to her opinion. She said she felt sick after the meal. \n\nThe tip off that it wasn't going to be a great meal was walking in to a bad smell - couldn't tell if it was cleaning products or mustiness but it was not the smell of great food cooking.Seems like either they cook at a different location or have it all made up and microwave each order. \n\nWe ordered a combo where you could select 3 hot and 3 cold mezze for $20 person. For two people the portions are smaller that the regular order but you get to try six items instead of four. \n\nWe had what they called moussaka that was fried eggplant chunks in tomato sauce. I didn't think it was great but my wife said that was one of two that she would order again. We had the Mazzat salad which was ok but had too much parsley for me. The labnah was tasty but one can easily buy it in a middle eastern grocery and add olive oil and zataar. The fatet betinjan was one of my favorites, another eggplant dish with pita croutons but my wife disliked this one. She had the ouzi- a rice dish with lamb and reported it was ok. The final dish was mutabal on the receipt but the waiter had recommended one called rahib- we both thought the mutabal was one of the better dishes so it was just as well the kitchen made a mistake. \n\nI was going to have a birthday meal here but so glad just the two of us popped in for a preview. Going to cancel that reservation now. \n\nAnd a pet peeve - please buy a larger toilet seat that fits the fixture.

I found a ton near Paddington Station and one near Sherlock Holme's residence. Ever since then I've been on a look out for authentic Lebanese food. San Francisco, for all of its food diversity and snobbery, lacks decent Lebanese food, (or Moroccan if you ask me). There is zero Alsatian restaurant here either, which is just about my favorite type of food on earth (combining German and French food, sort of my version of heaven!) But I digress. \n\nMazzat is a Lebanese restaurant. It has extremely wonderful selection of mazzat, which is basically tapas. My favorite is kebbeh, and followed by hummus with beef. get ouzi: rice and lamb never tasted better. For cold mazzat, of course babaghanouge, mutabal, and labne. Kabees is colorful but too salty (yes it's pickled veggies but I was hoping for something resembled the stuff I get in London!). \n\nIt also had a very cool cave wine from Lebanon. They poured generously and it made me extremely happy. I'm a light weight so I usually have a sip and then pass it to my date. This was no exception. \n\nFood aside, this is a great restaurant for catching up. N8 and I had a lot to catch up. Last month has been a whirlwind for me and him. I felt that I'd gone into the tunnel and out on the other end, and now I'm an entirely new person with absolutely zero short term memory. I gave N8 a run down of my ever so chaotic life, and he gave me his (not chaotic but eventful nonetheless). We could not stop eating. The food was absolutely delicious and the pita bread was warm and refilled often.\n\nTo cap the evening we ordered a lebanese coffee which had more cardamon, otherwise like Turkish coffee, and simply divine. One pot was too big for one person, best to be shared with your friend. \n\nThis was an intensely amazing meal with things you'd not often get in San Francisco. By the end of the meal we were all caught up. We synched our calendars to schedule in our next outing, while waited for check to arrive. Now that I've finally had my Lebanese food fix, I wondered what other Middle East restaurants I'd drum up for the next adventure food outing.", "author": "Victoria E."}

The space is warm and quiet and features comfortable lighting. It's a nice place to have a comfortable casual dinner where actual conversations are possible. We ordered the fatet batenjan, haloumi cheese, hummus with beef and kabsseh. We really enjoyed eating the fatet batenjan with a bit of the haloumi. I imagine it's not how it's meant to be eaten but the contrast in he flavors complimented each other really well. The hummus with beef was as expected - I don't think I've ever met a hummus I didn't like. Serving for the kabsseh was very generous - it felt like it was good enough for two even if we hadn't ordered other small plates. The flavors felt warm but well balanced and never overwhelmed. The food itself had a subtle but palpable homemade/family recipe vibe. Overall, a very good experience. Looking forward to the other things on the menu.", "author": "Isabel R."}

This was on a Saturday evening.  We did not have reservations so we were happy to sit at the counter, where the service was perfunctory, but OK.\n\nI ordered the Bamia and Maureen ordered the Kabsseh. I was attracted to the Bamia by the menu's description: \"Saut\u00e9ed green okra cooked with tomato sauce & tender lamb topped with fried garlic, served with jasmine rice\".  When the dish arrived, I saw chunks of lamb in a stew of brown gravy.  I did not perceive the okra or tomatoes.   I stared at the dish, waiting for the okra to arrive.  When nothing came, I asked the waitress, who told me that all of the veggies were in the gravy.  Indeed, the veggies were there, albeit cut up into tiny pieces and cooked until mushy.  I admit to being a Lebanese cuisine newbie, so I can't complain.\n\nLet the eating begin!   The lamb was tender and moist and the sauce was fragrant and delicately and deliciously spiced.   It was very good for a stew.   Maureen's Kabsseh, (which arrived about 7 minutes after my dish was delivered), was visually attractive.  I sampled her dish, and found it to be delicious.  The texture of the Kabsseh is not a stew, like the Bamia.  It contained a generous portion of dark meat chicken on the bone, served over basmati rice cooked with green peas, onions, carrots and raisins.  Very tasty.\n\nIf we dine at Mazzat again, I'd choose the Kabsseh.", "author": "Jeffrey F."}

Tried a couple Lebanese red wines and one was surprisingly tasty and full bodied. \n\nThen everything went downhill. The hot hummus with beef came out room temperature. Halloumi cheese was mediocre. When our entrees came out, I was still excited because I basically lived on kafta when I lived in Turkey and was curious what the Lebanese twist (if any) would be. Too bad Mazzat's were barely edible. Super dry, unseasoned, with what tasted like tomato sauce straight from the jar (and not even Newman's Own standard).\n\nHere's the worst part. After only a couple bites of my entree, I looked up at my fiance in complete panic. At the beginning of the evening, I explicitly told the waitress that he's allergic to nuts and yet she forgot about the almonds in the jasmine rice. My fiance, not knowing any better, was already 4 bites in, before feeling his throat close up. He ran home, while I stayed to take care of the bill.\n\nWhen I told the waitress, \"Ahem, there are nuts in his rice,\" she responded, \"But those are almonds.\" Lady, if you don't know almonds are nuts, you should not be working at a restaurant! Worst of all, she didn't take anything off the bill, even though he ran out of the restaurant after only a few bites. \n\nI'm only giving 2 stars because when I explained the situation to the manager, he took both my entree and my fiance's off the check.

One of the staff came by and said it would be out shortly. \n\n2.  Cold food. I had ordered a lamb dish that was a stew that came with a side of rice. It Came out cold.  I brought this to their attention and my dish was whisked away without much comment and reappeared also without comment 5-10 min later. \n\n3. The food itself was just ok. Surprisingly lacking in the spices that I associate with Lebanese food. It was a lamb stew with okra. Maybe a little salty and a little sweet but without much flavor. Same for most of the other dishes at our table. \n\n4. Worse of all was that we felt that we were forced to overtip. For a table of 4 or more they automatically add on a 20% tip which is normal. But they add on the tip before the tax so you're taxed on that as well. So really it was 21.8% mandatory tip for terrible service.

Why should overpriced boutiques and uber-trendy schnitzel-shops that I can't get into (YOU know who I'm talking about) shift my thoughts to grape leaves, olives, and flatbread? I don't know. I'm a complicated man. Let's move on.\n\nMazzat (like mezze) means \"appetizer\" and that is what you should order. The menu is decidedly anti-entr\u00e9e, burying a handful of dinners near the back. Some were even crossed out on my visit. Instead, you should trust the overture of mazzat options: they are helpfully divided into hot and cold. These run about $8-10 each, but a sampler platter gets you 6 (3 hot, 3 cold) for $20 per seated diner. \n\nMe and my two dates (a \"tripoli\" if you will... eh?)  shared a few items. The hummus harr is a spicy hummus topped with fried pine nuts. I loved it. The baseball-sized portion never seemed to disappear no matter how much toasted pita I threw at it. And I went hard. We skipped the halloumi (though tempting) in favor of the labne: creamy kefir topped with olive oil. It tasted like zesty Greek yogurt and that is more than acceptable. We also gave some Lebanese \"pizza\" a try. Basically it's flatbread topped with zataar. Not bad, but I think sticking to the mazzat menu is the way to go.\n\nI left stuffed and I would definitely return.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: ZAT's all folks!\n\nMenu Readability: Blech. White centered sans on a black field topped with a strange almost oily header typeface. Pregnant with typos. \n\nNeed to mention: They have some Lebanese wine on the menu if you're into that kind of thing.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: When a $800 sweater rubs me the wrong way, I can find peace in the Middle East.", "author": "Vivek S."}

The smoky eggplant was covered in pomegranate molasses (uncooked) so it was extremely sour and our table did not finish it.  \n\nThe menu you see online is not the menu you get, with about 40% of it being blacked out with a marker.  Additional items are also unavailable, for example, they were out of chicken (!) when I went on a Thursday night.  I could not order the chicken schwarma.   I got the falafel wrap and it was the driest wrap I've ever had.  It had not tzatiki or tahini or tomato or anything with any juice or liquid whatsoever.  It had tabouli in it, which I've never seen.  We asked for tzatiki and received it.   Did not finish this entree due to it being bad.\n\nWe ended up going somewhere else and eating more food.", "author": "Kelly M."}

With its mood lighting and candlelit date-sized tables, this intimate restaurant is a great option for a classy dinner with a friend or a nice date. The restaurant serves wine and has a cozy bar area as well.\n\nWe ordered the Mazzat platter, which comes with your choice of 3 hot options and 3 cold options (2 person order minimum). If you're a first-timer at Mazzat, I'd highly recommend going the platter route, just so you can sample a little bit of everything in case you want to order a whole plate of something on your next visit. It was a reasonable price for a great selection of food, and we were both full by the end of our meal. \n\nWe ordered the following: \n\n1. Kebbeh (fried beef balls)- hot\n2. Fatet batinjan (fried eggplant with yogurt sauce)- hot\n3. Ouzi (jasmine rice with ground lamb and beef)- hot\n4. Hummus harr (hummus with garlic/lemon/chili paste)- cold\n5. Tabouli (wheat with mint and parsley in lemon juice/ olive oil)- cold\n6. Mazzat salad (feta and parsley)- cold\n\nMy personal favorites were the hot platter options, especially the fatet batinjan and the ouzi. The fried breaded part of the eggplants was complemented nicely by the yogurt sauce, and the jasmine rice, although a bit bland, was a good offset to our cold platters. As for the cold dishes, I thought the tabouli and Mazzat salad were slightly too lemony for my taste, but the hummus harr we had on pita bread had a full-bodied flavor.\n\nThe service was cordial and helpful. We sat at the bar, and both our waitress and the bartender were patient in explaining the dishes we weren't familiar with (i.e. most of them). Though I don't think I'll be splurging very often on Mazzat, it was a wonderful dining experience and I look forward to going back!", "author": "Esther W."}

This  place with it's dim lighting and friendly waiters seemed very inviting.  There was no wait time, although  it was quite busy.  The ambiance was great.  The noise was medium,  so we had to raise our voices, but we didn't have to shout. \n\nThe food was good, without being anything extremely special.  I loved the warm pita and eggplant appetizer.  My husband took shwarma and I had a bite of it and it was pretty good.    Also, we had fried cauliflower, and it was ok.  The green beans could have been much better. \n\nOverall we had a very pleasant experience.

I told my guy that I was okay to go!\n\nPrior to catching a movie at Japantown's Kabuki, I wanted a homey, feel-good date night dinner. All I wanted was just some plain comfort food. And I took a chance when I found Mazzat on Yelp without having any idea if this was a dinky or not so pretty old cafe. \n\nMy guy and I were pleasantly surprised when we saw a cozily lit little place on the corner of Fell.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Lxb2mz0Yay7y8HSmvJ7dmA?select=ml3AweHp31JVirVZVb4EkQ\n\nMazzat is a cafe. A small cozy and contemporary cafe with glass cabinets filled with mouth-watering mediterranean meat pies and desserts.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Lxb2mz0Yay7y8HSmvJ7dmA?select=Yo2yUmFTQDQKWK-WCeMg7Q\n\nThe far-end wall is a floor to ceiling wine cabinet. Little tealight candles add a touch of a little romance on each table. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Lxb2mz0Yay7y8HSmvJ7dmA?select=JNpQdOgZhw7OqV2pZs3WDA\n\nThe young Lebanese couple who own and run the place were very friendly and welcoming.  Mazzat is newly opened 5 weeks ago.\n\nDINNER: And for $49 (a glass of wine, Diet Coke,  after taxes and before tip) my fiance and I ate well with plenty of leftovers for later. We had:\n\n6 hot/cold Mediterranean tapas for $25, an order of the meat pie to go and Kasbah rice dish. Mazzat's menu is extensive and mouth-watering. They came with a basket of hot buttered pita bread.  It was hard to pick ONLY 6 dishes but we chose: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Lxb2mz0Yay7y8HSmvJ7dmA?select=KgqvjGS8UxWR5wwoWyQ28w\n\n1. Chicken Pita http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Lxb2mz0Yay7y8HSmvJ7dmA?select=bODAAT6FxmoyOAJroZA_VA\n2. Baba Ganoush\n3. Fried Halloumi\n4. Falafel\n5. Hummus\n6. Moussaka\n\nAll of the above dishes were generously served and tasty. However, our favorites were the halloumi cheese and the moussaka. The moussaka was extra tasty with lovely spices and great for eating with the pita bread. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Lxb2mz0Yay7y8HSmvJ7dmA?select=C8myE-G6kr-FMUoehuTzNw\n\nThe real star of the show was the KABSA ($10). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Lxb2mz0Yay7y8HSmvJ7dmA?select=meeB53zP1PA6_ERCfsih8w  The female owner asked us if we wanted to try this rice dish of pine nuts, raisins and exotic spices. She told us that she wanted our honest opinion because she wanted to know if she should include this rice dish as part of the regular menu. The rice was cooked for 5 hours and the spices were from abroad. According to her, Kabsa is not Lebanese by origin but this dish has become popular among Lebanese folks during the last few years. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabsa\n\nWe were wowed! The  Kabsa  was very delicious. So full of spices and we devoured the whole thing. It came with nice chunks of lamb which my guy happily obliged to eat by himself.\n\nThe $5 generously poured Chardonnay was nice and crisp, and paired well with the dishes. ($18 for a bottle of either their white or red.)\n\nWe left Mazzat full and satisfied vowing to go back again and again.\n\nMOVIE:  Fifteen minutes into the \"Green Hornet\" the theater started spinning. I excused myself and found myself parked inside the bathroom throwing up x3.  My guy got worried and looked for me.  He drove me home at the back of his car without us finishing the movie and losing our 3D tickets.\n\nA week later, we were both still in bed recovering from 102 fever and respiratory stuff.\n\nMORAL OF THE STORY:\n1. Do not go on a date night when you are sick.\n2.

Or well, at least for me. I finally had a chance to last Friday though, but I was a little disappointed. I liked the decor though, and the ambience was nice, kind of date-sy. My bf and I sat on one of their high tables in the front, one of the things I liked about the restaurant. \n\nWe decided to order the Mazzat platter ($18/person), which includes 3 cold dishes and 3 hot dishes from their menu. They have plenty of choices from each side. For the cold plates, we ordred the halloumi cheese, hummus, and yogurt sauce (forget the name). The halloumi cheese, or \"grilled cheese\", was squeaky white cheese and included 3 pieces of it; that was pretty good. Hummus was okay; I've had better. I liked the yogurt sauce the most; it was light and minty. Also, their pita bread came out warm and fresh. For the \"hot\" dishes, we ordered falafel, tangy eggplant, and ouzi. Falafel dish came with 2 pieces, which were not even hot; actually, they weren't even warm, which bothered me. Isn't falafel supposed to be deep-fried?? The tangy eggplant was WAY too tangy. We just  tasted it and could not eat any more. For the ouzi (ground beef and lamb rice), I asked for no lamb because I'm not a huge fan, but they couldn't do that. So I assume their rice is pre-cooked... We also ordered the Kebbeh, which was pretty much ground beef in a deep-fried ball of bread. That one was good.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive, but unfortunately, the food won't be bringing me back here.", "author": "Stephanie G."}

Located on the southwest corner of Laguna and Fell St.  Just looking at this place, it was very inviting and the same as I walked in as the sweet Lady behind the counter greeted me. \n\nI new this place would have a variety of small dishes/mezze like tapas, and that was exactly what I was looking for, an array to choose from.  They had a great selection/assortment from your cold/hot mezze.  I already knew what I wanted and ordered the:\n\n- Kibbe - a torpedo-shaped bulgur shell stuffed with a savory filling of   spiced meat that's fried or baked until golden brown\n\n- Halloumi - Delicious fried cheese served with their pita bread\n\n- Meat pie - a savory meat filled pastry\n\nTheir Kibbe with the nice bite from the bulgur shell and tasty meat filling was really good.  The Halloumi (fried cheese) did it for me =) I love cheese and all that salty goodness which went perfect with their warm fresh pita bread.  The meat pies are awesome so flavorful, savory like Empanadas...what's not to love about tasty meat filled pastries.\n\nI enjoyed everything I ordered.  It was absolutely delicious and full of flavor.  Great friendly service in a nice cozy, intimate atmosphere.

The space is a bit small, so any group over 4 would probably be a bit much.\n\nWe decided to do the dinner platter for the 4 of us (3 hot, 3 cold dishes) and it was definitely more than enough food to feed everyone. We got eggplant, fava beans, hummus, lamb and rice, roasted eggplant and cheese. Because we chose the platter, the portions of the food are a bit larger. We actually had a lot of each dish left over once we finished dinner.\n\nIf you're a big meat eater, your best bet may be to order a completely separate meat dish, as most of the smaller dishes don't carry much meat at all. Of all the dishes, I would probably say the hot, roasted eggplant was my favorite because it carried the most flavor. I was a little underwhelmed by the lamb and rice. It smelled great, but there really wasn't much flavor in the dish. Overall, though, I was really satisfied with the quality of the food. I do wish they gave more pita bread to start though...\n\nThe service was only OK - I would say maybe just 3 stars for that... We did find ourselves waiting around a little while to get things like another menu, order another drink, or more water.

Their Baba Gann[insert some letters here like ouj or oush or uth] is perfectly smoky and creamy, just like it should be.   And that's good, since Baba is how I judge a middle eastern place like this.  \n\nWaitstaff is friendly enough, though they can be a bit harsh about not letting you combine certain dishes in the platters.  This is not because they don't want to make additions, but because they don't think they will taste good together. They are generally right though, so I can't really complain that they are trying to help me.  Still, it is a bit funny to be told you can't order something because you are wrong, think Tony Shaloub in Big Night, if you know what I mean.\n\nMy only real complaints are the price, which feels just a bit more than I'd expect for this fare, and the oiliness, as it seems many of the dishes are swimming in (delicious) olive oil.

The Spanakopita (spinach pie) was large, fairly dense with a very nice flaky wrap.  One order of the meat pies gives you 4 decent sized pies -- easily feeds two diners as an appetizer.   The tabouli was fresh and tasty.  The ambiance of Mazzat is a little dull and uninspired but the fast and efficient service makes up for it.  They appear to have a decent selection of wines (see my pics) although since neither I nor my bff are drinkers, I can't really comment much on their wines.\n\nPrices are surprisingly low for Hayes Valley.

Open a tad later than other Hayes Valley restaurants, though by no means a night owl haunt.  I appreciated them taking this cuisine up a notch on the fancy scale (since ordering a falafel doesn't have to mean sitting in a chair with duct tape), but the food was just ok.\n\nMeat Pie: I was envisioning something more like a lahma bi ajeen where the meat is spread out open on a flat bread, but got some of those mini-empanada looking meat pies.  The minced meat was a bit dense and lacked any vibrant spices.  Was one of those things they probably warm up in a microwave so wasn't a fan.\n\nHalloumi Cheese: I'm a sucker for halloumi.  Gotta respect a cheese that can take an intense grilling and not melt away.  Crispy outer edges and firm inner cheese.  A pita was served with this that appeared to be freshly baked, a very impressive offering since most places use those pitas from a bag that have the dry inside.  This one was moist and chewy and warm!\n\nLamb Shawarma: I hate when places use the word \"shawarma\" but really mean bits of meat griddled or pan fried.  Isn't a real shawarma supposed to be thinly shaved from a large spit where one side of the shaving is super crispy and the side, which wasn't exposed to the flame, super moist?  Also breaking from tradition was panini pressing the lavash bread so the sandwich is a sealed in one large rectangle which is then cut in half.  I kind of liked that since it gave a crunchy texture and added structural integrity to a wrap that often falls apart.  The fillings of hummus, cucumber salad and fried potatoes were quite nice leaving me only the lamb to complain about.\n\nChicken Shawarma: Same aspects as the lamb shawarma, but with chicken.  The chicken too was in bits and not real shawarma shavings.  Was decent.", "author": "Adam B."}

My boyfriend and I got the mazzat platter, which allows you to choose three hot and three cold dishes that they combine in a large platter. It comes with fresh, toasted pita for a really complete meal. We went with the spicy hummus, roasted eggplant, and tabouli for cold dishes. All were obviously made with fresh ingredients and lots of amazing Mediterranean spices. The hot dishes were just as good, and I highly recommend the rice mixed with beef and lamb for something heartier. We also tried the chicken artichoke pizza, which was basically thick grilled pita with pesto, chicken, and artichoke. The pita made for a great crust, and the toppings were all of my favorite things on a pizza! The best part is when you finish a huge meal and don't feel an ounce of guilt because of the quality and care put into the dishes.", "author": "Ashley T."}

We decided to head inside because it looked like a cute ambiance and who doesn't love hummus?\n\nWe tried--\n1. Fatet Batinjan which is fried eggplant with garlic yogurt sauce, croutons, and pine nuts: This was a very unique dish and nothing like I've tried before. The eggplant was softer than we expected but the yogurt sauce and the crispy croutons complimented it well. \n2. Hummus Harr- this was a winner. I was a little skeptical about just getting hummus with so many other enticing options on the menu, but trust me, this is something you don't want to miss. The hummus was the smoothest I had ever tasted (sorry Trader Joes) and also so flavorful--not bland, but very rich, slightly spicy and perfectly seasoned. Think I hate about 10 pieces of bread through the night to finish the hummus. \n3. Zataar Pita- total letdown. Basically a open faced pita with tomatoes and olive oil. Might have been more to the ingredients, but tasted like just that. Wish we had gotten something more flavorful instead. We had to douse this dish with hummus and ask for hot sauce to even finish it. \n\nAdorable ambiance. Cute, intimate and a nice place to have dinner. Food is only so-so overall though but I would say come for appetizers, a glass of wine, and a nice ambiance. \n\nOther tips:\n+Only wine/beer here. No other hard alcohol and pretty limited selection in terms of their wine list. \n+Can be a wait because it's a pretty small place. \n+Not the best for big parties, more intimate and good for smaller groups.", "author": "Anu P."}

The \"sweet cheese\" was tough and dry, no taste.\n\nAlso, there's no kitchen. I saw that in one of the Yelp reviews before we went but gave them the benefit of the doubt. There's a convection oven (like the kinda at Starbucks where they warm your sandwich), a panini press, and a counter-top deep fryer. The latter making the entire restaurant AND YOU reek of rancid grease.\n\nService wise, the owner was our server and was pleasant. But when it came time to split the bill on two cards, he mixed up the amounts charging the wrong cards the wrong amounts. No big deal, my friend and I can work it out. Except when I got home and randomly checked my bank account, he had made BOTH charges to my card.\n\nI was testing out the place as a possible birthday dinner spot; definitely not happening.

I checked the menu and it had all my favorites.  Sounds great, right?  Unfortunately not. \n\nI ordered the mujadra and the fattoush salad.  I should have known better when I read the menu and saw that the fattoush salad was made with a pomegranate dressing.  Pomegranate?  Really?  Not very traditional.  The salad came out and it was ok, but not lebanese at all.  Where is the lemon?  Where are the olives?  Radishes aren't typical lebanese.\n\nThen the mujadra came out and I was soooooo disappointed.  This is hands down my favorite lebanese dish.  Similar to Dahl at an Indian restaurant Mujadra is a staple that always changes yet always has certain distinctive flavors.  Well, let's say this one was extremely lacking.  \n\nA great mujadra is about half lentils and bursting with flavor.  This one was 90% rice with a few lentils scattered in, and absolutely no flavor.  Completely bland.  So sad.  And it cost $10... for what amounted to a small side of rice.  \n\nIt's too bad, I really wanted to like this place as it is so close to my house.  I doubt I'll be back.  \n\nAre the owners lebanese?  I can't imagine they eat this stuff themselves.", "author": "Evelyn N."}

Particularly interesting were the Arnabeet - a tangy fried cauliflower dish, Eraydiss - not the greatest shrimp dish ever, but the eggplants were exceptional, and Mutabal - a very different, somewhat sweet eggplant spread.\n\nThey have some great Belgian and Belgian-style beer on tap ( four taps, no less, Chimay, a couple Ommegang products ) as well as bottles of a Lebanese lager I had not seen before, and some Lebanese wines of which only a white is available by the glass.  Their pours are generous.\n\nUpon reflection, $36 seemed a bit much for the reasonably large platter that came complete with some wonderfully soft flatbread.  It was all very good, but a lot of money for what amounts to a light lunch of salads made from relatively inexpensive ingredients.

Although service was excellent, the two entrees were terrible.\n\nThe meal started out promising. We had the Grilled Halloumi salad and it was delicious. But again, it's pretty hard to mess up Halloumi. It's always delicious. Then, everything was downhill from there.  \n\nI was shocked when I received my entree and received 3 small pieces of Kafte. 3 measly pieces of Kafte for $18?! I thought that maybe they were small, but they were going to be amazing? I was also wrong. I love Kafte, and I order it whenever I see it on a menu. This was the worst Kafte I've had in recent memory: tough and chewy. The sweet tomato sauce and rice did nothing to salvage the dish for me.\n\nJust when I thought the meal could not get any worse, I tried my boyfriend's Chicken Schwarma. I bit into the wrap and immediately thought, \"That's weird. It's lukewarm and the meat tastes chalky.\" I had never tasted a schwarma like it and trust me, that's not a good thing. I kinda gagged, the texture of the meat and fillings were that bad. My boyfriend likened it to what he thought cat food might taste like. My boyfriend forced himself to finish it only because it was so expensive.\n\nEven now, we feel cheated knowing we paid about $50 for such a disappointing meal.

I also had the tabouli, something I've never had before, and it wasn't what I thought. I expected more of the bulgur wheat, but I learned that the dish emphasizes the veggies that go in it. It was a very lemony, light and healthy. I had a few bites of the bf's kafta and that was delicious! Loved the complexity in the tomato sauce, and it tasted especially good sopped up with pita.

The Tabouleh used curly (Chinese?) parsley - the parsley is the key ingredient and using curly parsley changes the texture/dish completely. The Hummus with Meat used ground beef, instead of chopped lamb as the meat, and the hummus itself was over-garliced and lacked the appropriate seasoning.  The Kefta meat was overcooked and dried out.  And the Halloumeh is supposed to be grilled, I have no idea what they did to it but it didn't taste right.  The ful was actually ok.

I wondered what the empty room meant about the restaurant, but sure enough, the place filled in 10 minutes after we sat down (we got there around 7:15PM).  \n\n~ Food ~\nSoooo yummy.  We didn't have to wait long, either.  It was our first time at Mazzat, so we weren't positive what to order, and there was a nice selection of hot and cold mazzat, meats, wraps, salads, soups, wine, etc.  Our friendly and attentive waitress pointed out the dine-in-only special - a platter of 3 cold mazzat and 3 hot mazzat, plus all the warm pita bread we could eat.  YUM. We ate that shit up.  Aaaand we still had leftovers. Personally, our favorites were the tabouli, hummus, labne, and mujadara with cucumber yogurt sauce.  We also had the mini meat pies and eraydiss (also very tasty).  Didn't order wine, so can't say anything about that, but everyone around us had a glass or two.\n\n~ Service ~\nOur waitress/hostess was very welcoming and attentive throughout our meal.  Unfortunately, we didn't catch her name, but she got a nice tip!  I think she's the main waitress.  (Hopefully we won't run into that credit card overcharge issue another Yelper mentioned.  I doubt it.)    \n\nOverall, great place. Quality food. Romantic atmosphere. Attentive service.", "author": "Karina C."}

Ten minutes after ordering, we received our entrees. Ok......where are our appetizers? We told him we never got our apps and he looked at us with a blank stare. He opened up his notepad to check the order, and I noticed he never even wrote them down. He apologized and put in our app orders. Doesn't do us much good since our food had already come, suspiciously fast might I add.\n\nI ordered the kafta and was disappointed to see that I got three measly meatballs and a heap of rice for $18. The kafta was decent, nothing to write home about. The apps were actually pretty good. We ordered hummus, dolmas, and a rice with lamb in it (forgot the name).  \n\nI woke up around 4am the next morning with terrible stomach pains. I spent the next few hours puking uncontrollably. After puking up all my food, the stomach acid came next. I thought the worst had passed. NOPE. Next came the endless waves of diarrhea.

Their falafel had very obviously been sitting for a while or reheated...it was just chewy and dry.\n\nI also had the mujadara, dolma, lebne, couscous salad, meat pie.  All were also just okay and did not compel me enough to want to go back.  Sorry....I just didn't get that \"yummmm\" feeling while eating the food here.   There aren't that many great middle eastern cuisine spots in the city, so I think if this place took it up a notch they would be super successful !", "author": "S G."}

We had the chicken/artichoke/feta pizza, the hummus, the fried cauliflower and lamb meatballs. The pizza was by far the table favorite: generous portions of toppings with clean, distinct tastes of super ingredients. The hummus was also popular. It sounds simple but the few ingredients were balanced perfectly and the grilled flatbread was awesome. We used our leftover bread to dip in the meatball sauce. Nice relaxed but attentive service, casual atmosphere. I will definitely go back!", "author": "Greg J."}

I went for the first time last night and was delighted by how cozy and tasty it was. \n\nAmbiance: 3 stars (while the ambiance is just fine, it's not where its strengths lie. they've redone the space, but it's sort of a hodgepodge between upscale deli and casual restaurant. a bit random, but it works for a functional lunch or dinner.)\n\nService: both of the owners are so warm. their mom makes the lebanese food from scratch every morning, and you truly get the sense that this is a family enterprise. they're attentive and conversational, good people. \n\nFood: 4 stars \nLentil soup- a-mazing. really delicious, comforting soup, just a tad lemony, spiced well. one of the best lentil soups i've had.\nSpanokopita- i've had better. the filling is good, but the pastry isn't all that great. overall, it's a bit clumsy, so i would skip this next time. \nChicken-artichoke pita- this is a good--not amazing. the chicken, haloumi cheese, and crust are really wonderful here, but the wilted spinach between the crust and toppings tastes exactly as such--wilted and tired. interestingly, i would order this again, because despite the wilted spinach, it's pretty good. \nBabaganoush- yum. it's a lemony mixture of roasted eggplant, tahini, and spices and it's served with hot grilled pita triangles. it tastes like it's made with love, and can easily feed 4 as an appetizer. \n\nOther:\nWine- the wine list isn't extensive, but the pours are big (and cheap)-- about $5 per glass\nPortion size- much bigger than we anticipated! We got the above four items, but could have easily done with three. I would advise on starting with fewer and ordering more as needed. They also have a wonderful option of ordering 6 hot/cold tapas for $25 (serves 2). This is a great deal, especially considering the portion size. I'll definitely try this option in the future. \n\nWill be back again. I live around the corner, and it might be one of my favorite casual dinner options in Hayes Valley yet.", "author": "sfgal g."}

The falafel wasn't as good as I imagined, a little dry and not very flavorful. But the kibbe (ground meat, in little balls) was very tasty. The babaganoush was very good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-19", "description": "Last Saturday evening, my brother and I found ourselves wandering in Hayes Valley, looking for a place to eat dinner and catch up. After being quoted long wait times at the neighborhood's trendier venues, we stumbled upon Mazzat, a new Lebanese restaurant and wine bar on the corner of Laguna and Fell. We were enticed by the offerings listed on the menu in the window, and were sold when a group sitting at a table inside made eye contact with us, pointed to their plates, and gave us the thumbs up.\n\nUpon entering, we were kindly greeted by Manuel, both the host and our waiter. The restaurant was clean and modern inside, yet cozy with dark, wood-top tables, dim lighting, and candles - great ambience for a date or a nice dinner with a small group of friends. It was also quiet enough that my brother and I could talk over the extensive and delicious options on the menu, plotting our gastronomic plan of action.\n\nYou see, Mazza are the Arab equivalent of Tapas, so my brother and I decided to forego the more traditional dinner options (which included Lebanese rice dishes, wraps, and pizzas), and opted for the Mazzat Meal Platter ($18 per person). With this we could choose three hot and three cold mazzat dishes, which would be served family-style with warm pita bread. We were happy to find many vegetarian options (neither of us eat meat), though with twenty-nine mazzat dishes to choose from, there were plenty for the carnivorous crowd, too. We finally thought we had decided on our six dishes, but just to be sure, we asked Manuel what he thought of our selection. He suggested we try a few mazza we had initially written off as not quite our style, but my brother and I decided to trust his expert opinion -- especially when he said that he'd bring us our original selections if we were unsatisfied with his recommendations.\n\nBut not a bite went back once the plates came out. Elegantly served on a family-style platter, all the dishes were full of flavor, a reflection of both the freshness of the ingredients and the delicate balance of spices, herbs, and mints used in their preparation. My brother and I both agreed that the best of the six was the one we were most wary of, the Fatet Batinjan. Manuel recommended this dish of fried eggplant topped with garlic yogurt sauce, pita croutons, and pine nuts. Definitely not your standard hummus or tabouli, this dish was the highlight of our dinner. I also enjoyed the Mujadara, a lentil rice dish topped with grilled onion and served with a side of cucumber yogurt sauce. I'm usually not a fan of cucumber yogurt sauce, but the cucumbers were so fresh and the yogurt so light that I used my last piece of pita bread to clean the inside of the cup. In fact, there wasn't a crumb left on the entire platter when my brother and I were finished with our meal. Alex, the owner, came to clear the plates and told us that nothing made him happier than to see a platter as clean as ours. Such personal service made the dining experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nI washed my meal down with a glass of cabernet ($7), while my brother had a pint of the Ommegang brew they had on tap ($8). And finally, although we were stuffed from the generously portioned feast, we couldn't say no to dessert since dinner had been so delicious. My brother got the Namoura ($3), a Lebanese pastry made with semolina, soaked in sugar syrup, and sprinkled with pistachios (although the menu said almonds). I had two delicious forkfuls, and would recommend it as one of the best Middle Eastern desserts I've had. \n\nAll in all, Mazzat is a classy and delicious spot for dinner, especially for a special date night. Alternatively, it'd make a great stop for just a small plate and a glass of wine before a night out. Given the high quality food, the impeccable service, and the trendy area of town, the prices are fair (though not cheap for those of us on a student budget).", "author": "Theresa P."}

This may have been an off night but TERRIBLE service, at least on Friday December 5. Lots of wait staff but all huddled around the bar talking to one another and acting busy, not attending to the room, at least to us. Place was empty for a Friday night (I understand why now). We were sat and then ignored, till my friend went up and asked if we could place our order as we were going to a show. Owner must have hired all his friends and relatives (young and inexperienced); no one here seemed to really understand service or what it meant to be competing with the tons of great places to eat just around the corner.\nFood was fairy good (warning..beef is the only non vegetarian protein on the menu..no chicken, no fish, which is kinda wierd); good vegetarian options tho. I wont be going back. Too many other great restaurants with great food and good service... If I were the owner, I would get involved in the operations. You are losing money!", "author": "Mischa M."}

I've eaten a lot of Mediterranean food in my day, and this place is just not great.  I feel a little guilty that I'm giving them a bad review because the staff was super nice and friendly, but . . . well, first of all, the meat pie.  The dough used for the pie was dense and dry.  The halloumi cheese should be avoided at all costs.  They were basically congealed, waxy slabs of plastic and nearly inedible.  Fatet betinjan - merely okay.  And when eggplant is merely okay, I get suspicious because I love eggplant in all its varietals.  If you're somehow forced to eat here, I would go for the babaghanouge or couscous - those were both pretty decent.  But Jannah on Fulton or even Ziryab on Divis are both substantially better, and there is no way I'd waste any more precious food calories on Mazzat.", "author": "Jenny R."}

The decor is quiet and unobtrusive, lending itself to a feeling of calm, privacy and cozy intimacy. \n \nWe ordered several items from the \"Cold Mazzat\" menu: hummus, babaghanouge, and eggplant pomegrante.  Having lived in the mideast, I am used to being disappointed by one or more of these dishes.  Not so here:  all were excellent. The hummus felt home-made, from the kitchen of a friend. The babaghanouge had a just-right smoked flavor.  The eggplant pomegrante was new to us, and we loved it.   \n\nWe also ordered one of the main house salads, called Faloush.  It is one of the very best salads l've ever had.  The pomegrante dressing was to die for.  I would go back again and again for this dish alone. \n\nSuzi, one of the owners, was there each time we needed her, and consistently went out of her way to make our visit perfect.  For example, we were having trouble fitting our cups and saucers on the table.  She whisked them away, replacing them with lovely tall tea mugs. \n \nThe menu is fairly extensive.  In future visits, we want to try:  Lebanese wines, wraps, and main courses (especially a chicken dish with jasmine rice, veggies, raisins and pine nuts). \n\nI'd advise calling ahead if you have a party of more than 4.  We were there on a weekday; it might also be a good idea to make a reservation on a Friday or Saturday evening. \n\nFinding a parking space in this area might take of time; we found a parking space quite easily, but I think it was sheer luck. \n\nHowever, this same location has an added benefit we didn't realize beforehand:  Mazzat is on Fell Street, one of the \"inner highways\" of San Francisco, this one leading toward the ocean.  Thus, if you live in the Haight, the Richmond, the Sunset, etc., or - if you live north of the city (Marin or Sonoma), or if you're heading to Highway 280, Mazzat it an excellent choice since you just drive up this inner highway and you're well on your way home.", "author": "lahni d."}

First off the menu is not user friendly.  The wait staff was not the most attentive as it took awhile to take our order, the waiter did not check in to see how the food was either.  Now on to the food.  We ordered the eggplant mousaka and falafel for an appetizer.  The mousaka was quite good, but the falafel tasted as if they were not fried, but baked.  Not good at all.  We both opted for trying shawermas.  We ordered one lamb and one chicken.  Both of them were SOOO DRY it was horrible.  There was no barely any tahina in the wrap, it was down right awful.  Neither of us barely ate half our dish.  I decided to tell the waiter as he could see neither of us finished hardly anything.  He acknowledged that he knows their shawerma is on the dry side.  He asked if we wanted anything else instead and we opted to get out as soon as possible.  The waiter showed up with a complimentary dessert which was mediocre.  We ended up spending over $50 for really bad food.  At the very least we would have hoped the owner would have apologized and comped one meal as most gracious restaurants would do, but they did not.  This is a true sign of the kind of establishment this is.  We were not looking for a free dinner by anymeans, but as a business owner there is a right way and a wrong way to deal with customers having a bad experience and this was the wrong way.  Now I am so upset I am writing this negative review and will tell all my friends NOT to go here.  Being Lebanese this was a true insult to my culture. \n\nOH WELL!

We enjoyed our dinner and would very happily eat here again.\n\nMy wife and I were in the area to attend a concert at Herbst Theatre. We discovered Mazzat on Yelp and since it  was a short walk away we decided to give it a try.\n\nAs another reviewer mentioned, the menu is essentially hot and cold Mediterranean tapas and some salads. There aren't really any formal entrees. However, you can share some number of dishes family style for a set price. In our case, we shared 6 dishes for $25, and also split a salad.\n\nWe chose falafel, babaganush, pickled vegetables (anti pasta), couscous with feta, spanikopita, and a chicken, artichoke, and feta \"pie\".\n\nThey were all delicious and freshly made. The couscous with feta was tasty and filling -- pretty much as it sounds. The spanikopita was a bit too rich for me, but my wife loved it. I loved the babaganush, which had a great texture and just the right amount of lemon. It was outstanding.\n\nThe chicken, artichoke, and feta \"pie\" wasn't really a pie but an open-faced pita, and it was generously topped and flavorful.\n\nThe spinach and smoked salmon salad with grape tomatoes and onions was served in a light dressing. We probably didn't need -- the platter was plenty for us -- but it tasted great and definitely filled out the meal. We didn't have any room left for dessert.\n\nWe had a glass of the house merlot, which was a very nice table wine. \n\nThe service was extremely friendly. We lingered a bit over dinner and were there for about an hour and twenty minutes, and the owner (who was also our waiter) couldn't have been nicer.

Friday night around 730 there were only 2 seats at the bar, which I happen to enjoy but I'd suggest making reservations as it seems that's what most people have done and they're busy. Food was much more interesting than the menu suggests. Ask for the eggplant dish that is their best seller--I will go back specifically for that. Really liked the fava beans as well as a rice and ground lamb (I think) that had a great cinnamon spice. Our service was attentive and friendly yet I never felt rushed even on a busy night. Definitely going back.", "author": "Shari D."}

In any other city, I'd give this place a 3, but considering the arabic food landscape of SF, it gets 4.  I am on a quest for good shawarma and this place had a decent one.  We had a pretty in-depth conversation with the cook about why she uses this type of bread, that type of sauce, her spice mix, and how she puts the shawarma together.  \n\nGood things:\n- cute ambiance\n- hummus (i think it had a tad too much tahini, but my Arab accompaniment though it was great)\n- friendly cook\n- meat pies were decent\n- shawarma.  this is some good, some bad.  \n  *i'm not a fan of lavash, but evidently the reason all the Arab places in this city use lavash is b/c the good pita bread is not easily and freshly available.  \n*  chicken- seasoned well but a bit too dry for my taste.\n*  other fixins- good mix, good taste.  sauce was good.\n\nThings that could change:\n- they were cleaning the kitchen with some pretty strong chemicals while we were eating.  it made it difficult to enjoy the food.  then they opened the windows and door...and wow, did it get cold in there!\n- the menu is pretty limited.  they know this and are expanding it.  they hope to have an expanded menu within a few days- something to look forward to!\n- kibbe were a little soggy, but tasted really good\n\nI'll keep my eye on this place as it expands and will definitely give it another try.", "author": "goph s."}

I'm almost positive it was frozen pre-cooked shrimp or something you'd get from a Safeway deli tray. The edges all smooth and the texture hard.  Its better to say you're out than serve terrible product. They also said they were Jumbo shrimp and they were really small (36/40). We ordered the platter so tried six dishes total.  Hummus- decent but runny. Maybe that's how the Lebanese like it?  Eggplant w/yogurt- very good, eggplant with the \"shrimp\" was pretty good (if you're a fan of cinnamon) sans the shrimp, fava beans - gross- I've only had canned fava beans that tasted like that.  Labne was good but how could it not be? Its just strained yogurt.  We got the pickles and vegetables which were pretty good too.  But I won't be going back because of those shrimp.  I don't trust the person cooking/buying who serve pre-cooked shrimp. And honestly I didn't see or hear a kitchen. Just one guy behind the counter cooking? Microwaving? Not sure but super quiet.  Without those shrimp I'd give 3 stars for food, 4 stars for ambiance and for our waitress who was very nice.", "author": "Sarah A."}

The falafel was totally dry with very little tahini sauce to go with it, the red wine was too warm, the salad was wilted, and the spanikopita was not made of the flaky filo dough you would expect.

Mazzat's version of moussaka is very different from the Greek but even tastier, and almost velvety in texture.\n\nCombined with cool, dry Lebanese white wine it was truly a meal to die for.

Have these folks never had Lebanese or Middle Eastern food before?  One review talked about the amazing Mousaka. Cut up pieces of eggplant with tomato sauce is a far cry from what I know Mousaka to be. They sure keep to their 10 pm Saturday night close. We were seated at 9:40 pm and at 10:10 asked to lift our legs for them to sweep.  I am NOT exaggerating. I want to love this place so bad - it's 2 block away from my house.

So we walked one block to Fell street looking for a place to munch and saw a sign on a corner of Fell & Laguna for Lebanese cousine. It looked attractive inside and we decided to check this out. We were not disappointed. The owner greeted us and explained what she has on a menu; we opted for a plate of 6 appetizers - 3cold and 3 hot for $30. I eat a lot of Middle Eastern Food but I must say this is one of the best prepared dishes I had in a long time. We tried hummus with beef, fried salumi cheeze,babaganush,dolmas, egglant with yougurt and tabuleh. All were very flavourful with elegant hint of lemon and spices.. Eggplant with yougurt had a fantastic crunchy taste to it. All dishes are freshly prepared on premises by owner. We completed our meal with two cups of excellent turkish coffee each and could not escape a tempation of a slice of a fresh baklava that was not one of too sticky variety but just right - lightly sweetened with a layer of tasty chopped nuts.

I mostly come here for business group meetings, every time with new clients, and they all always love the experience. I came here also with some Middle Eastern friends and they also loved the Mazzat experience. It's hard to find a place that will make you feel as if you're really dining somewhere in Lebanon. The owner Adam and his staff are warmly welcoming from when you step in until you leave. Generosity is felt all the time at this restaurant. Almost every time I've been here (7-8 times), Adam offered us either wine, or some fresh appetizer, or a desert for FREE. Super generous spirit that makes you feel at home. The food at Mazzat is always getting better every time, keeping in mind that they are the only Lebanese cuisine in the area...I can see here on yelp some people criticizing their food, and I am Lebanese myself and grew up eating this food. I see that their food is authentic and has definitely gotten better and better every time, so I am sure that at one point they will be the most authentic Lebanese cuisine in the Bay area. But the most important thing is not only the food, it's the entire experience you feel since you step in this warm ambience. You feel so welcomed and well taking care of, something that everyone wants to feel when dining out. Every one of my customers and friends that dined at Mazzat shared similar opinion about the Lebanese experience they all have here. And not to mention, their Lebanese wine takes me back straight to the green mountains of Lebanon, absolutely the best!

For those that don't know, the tastes and spices used to prepare dishes vary wildly across Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food.  Moroccan, Lebanese, Turkish, Iranian/Persian- (and shhh..Greek- but don't tell them that, it's a sore spot from the ottoman empire) can make a huge difference- even in foods with the same name, like kebabs or kufte or baklava. The place is quaint and the service was excellent with a family relaxed feel- as opposed to high end being catered to.

Best of all for me was that this small attractive restaurant had quiet lovely background music from the Middle East and was quiet enough for comfortable conversation (a rarity in San Francisco) despite our presence there during the center of the lunch hour.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-09-18", "description": "Two friends and I had plans to dine before a concert on Saturday night, and Mazzat was close to the Herbst Theatre. The three of us were seated at a table that was approximately two feet by two feet, i.e. it was basically a cocktail table.  we were constantly juggling dishes throughout the meal.For a restaurant that serves multiple small plates to have such small tables displays poor planning.  The waiter was not able to tell us anything about the two Lebanese red wines, other than one was more dry than the other. We had a bottle that was decent, but tasted similar to a Sangiovese that one can but at Trader Joe's for $3. This bottle cost $40. I'm prepared to pay a mark-up for wine at a restaurant, but this was beyond reason. The fava bean preparation may have had too much vinegar, as it tasted almost as if it had been left in the back of the refrigerator for a week. The grape leaves were passable, but again, no better than other preparations that I have elsewhere enjoyed at a lower price. The eggplant in pomegranate sauce was mushy, and almost devoid of flavor. The chicken shawerma was little more than cubes of chicken rolled up into a pita, and toasted. It was dry, and again had no discernible flavor. Finally, we were constantly being interrupted by a staffer asking if things were alright. I can understand making the effort to ensure that customers are happy, but after eight times, when conversation was repeatedly disrupted by someone not waiting for at least a pause in our talking, it was pretty annoying. I don't think that I'll return.", "author": "John S."}
