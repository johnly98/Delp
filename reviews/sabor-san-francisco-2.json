My partner and I went there for a much needed dinner without kids and had a wonderful time. The restaurant itself is beautiful and intimate with bright colored walls and great natural light. The food was absolutely incredible. Homemade, unique, and delicious! We got the Guatemalan Salad, the Sabor Sampler and the plantanos and everything was incredible. With 2 glasses of wine, the bill was less than $50, which this working mama greatly appreciates. Lastly, the service was fantastic. Our server, the daughter of the owners was incredibly warm and told us the history of the  restaurant. I recommended it to my dad and he took a friend yesterday and they both loved it.  Go to Sabor de San Miguel! You will not be disappointed!", "author": "Caya S."}

There were three tamales with a side of beans and cream. They were delicious, plus el agua de horchata was the best, its on the sweet side but i love sweet so I loved it.

It's hard to find good quality tamales at restaurants because they're very time consuming to make, and most restaurants just produce very simple tamales without putting a lot of effort into the tamal making process. These ALMOST taste like my aunt's tamales... ALMOST, which is pretty amazing!\n\nThe Pipi\u00e1n is also excellent, also try the rellenitos!\n\nBy the way, Latino food is not limited to Mexican food!

I don't mean the food is stuffy-it's exactly the opposite. But someone really thought about the flavors and took care to make them interesting and sometimes unusual.\n\nGot the pepian, two pieces of chicken (not one, unlike Jason B's review) with seed sauce, cilantro and veggies. Not sure what the seeds were made of but this was served in a shallow bowl, stew consistency, and sufficiently delicious that I used the tortillas to get as much of the sauce as I could. (The sauce goes well on a tortilla with the salsa, by the way. The salsa is, as warned by the waiter, extremely spicy so a microscopic amount goes a long way.) This is pure comfort food.\n\nThe hot chocolate had an unusual taste, although an agreeable, slightly fruity, one. A sprig of something showed up on the spoon. I asked the waiter, who explained that they make their hot chocolate with cinnamon and (I forget the name of the herb but it begins with a 'c' or 's' and wasn't cilantro).\n\nFor a place with so many items on the menu, they only have three desserts, all based on plantains. Two involve frying, so I decided to try the third, plantains in mole. I got the description from the waiter, who told me the mole was slightly spicy. If I had ordered from the menu, where it says the mole sauce is sweet, I would have been shocked with what I got. As it was, I found the dessert an acquired taste that I was part way to acquiring. The sauce was excellent, chocolaty and assertively spicy with sesame seeds on top, and I could taste the sweetness of the plantains through the spiciness of the mole. I would say that if you are adventurous, like spicy food, and are looking for a barely-sweet dessert, definitely try this. Still, be warned that the spiciness outweighs the sweetness.\n\nService is friendly with no language barrier. The waiter (waiter-chef? he was also doing stuff in the kitchen) is happy to describe the dishes and came by to check my tortilla basket and again to see if I needed anything.\n\nTV was playing Latino music videos (marimba bands and similar) at a reasonable volume.\n\nFascinating wall display of photos and paintings of Guatemala. A couple plants for greenery (although one of the fronds need to be trimmed so it doesn't brush the customers' head).\n\nClean.\n\nOne vegetarian option, the Plato Vegetariano, which doesn't seem to be shown on their website. Haven't tried it yet.\n\nCheck it out.", "author": "Charles B."}

So in case you don't know where Guatemala exactly is, don't worry, there is even a map to show you the location.\n\nThe food is pretty good. The tostadas with shrimps are deliciuos! For main course I tried the churrasco guatemalan style, and my gf tried the chicken mole. The churrasco was good, different to the Mexican style. The chicken mole was different alright. It tasted more sweet, like it was made out of chocolate. At one point it was to sweet that my gf couldn't finish all of it. The service is pretty good. Maybe because the place is small, they tend to give more attention to the costumers. \n\nThe bad about this place is that it doesn't accept credit cards. So bring cash or you may have to step outside and cross the street to the BOA and use their ATM. Another thing is finding parking. Since it's right on Mission, it is pretty hard to look for a good parking space.\n\nSo overall...\nThe goods:\n-Good food\n-Prices are not expensive\n-Good costumer service\n-Nice place to see a bit of culture of Guatemala\n\nThe bads:\n-Don't accept credit cards\n-Hard to find parkings\n\nIf you don't mind paying only with cash, and giving time to find parking, then this place is pretty cool!", "author": "AL N."}

After years of living in the lower pac heights/J-town area, it's like being a new city! And a new city means a whole new slew of restaurants. Including San Miguel, where I had eaten once prior with friends and now know is only a 5 minute walk from our apartment. \n\nAfter that long (somewhat uninteresting intro), I have to say that I wasn't sure what to expect from Guatemalan cuisine. I have never been to Guatemala, nor do I know anyone Guatemalan. I was very pleasantly surprised. We shared chicken tamales as an app, which came with crema and black beans - delicious. For my entree, I had the tostadas, which had a great crunch and savory quality to them. The boyfriend loves the steak entree (has ordered it the two times we've been there). \n\nThe service was friendly and always persistent in refilling our waters. One of my favorite qualities. \n\nIf I rated restaurants based on the quality of their restrooms, this one would not do so well, with a hole in the floorboard and one of those old cloth towel dispensers on a wheel for drying your hands (needless to say I used my jeans instead). But I don't generally take it into too much consideration because what I care about is food & service, which were both great.", "author": "Carissa R."}

I looked forward to eating the food from my homeland and was impressed. Over time, however, I've been disappointed perhaps because I compare what I order with my mom's or Abuelita's dishes, or just because I no longer enjoy what I order because things are always too salty: the beans, the sauces, the mole, longanizas, etc. Today, unfortunately, was not any different although I was hopeful.  I ordered the soap de gallina criolla (hen soup) and barely touched it because it was too salty!  The same thing goes for the soap de pata, which my husband order; and even after adding hot water to our soup bowls to cut the salt we couldn't make any progress on it.

They ordered the sopa de res and were pretty happy with it and they have discerning taste for that sort of thing. I decided to try the mole and it wasn't very good I'm sorry to report.

I was born and raised in Guatemala, and have had these dishes all my life both at home and outside.\n\nIn my opinion, the 'caldo de res' (a simple but really tasty beef stock with beef chunks and vegetables in it) is 5 stars, and the 'caq-ik'  (Q'eqchi language name for the dish) is worth 3 1/2. I am not used to having the caq-ik broth be this thick.  As far as I am concerned caq-ik is meant to be just like caldo de res in terms of consistency, but perhaps this varies. Either way, I think I remember a more intense flavor. \n\nRellenitos de platano (mashed plantain paste filled with fried beans and then itself fried) were awesome and unhealthy as expected. \n\nTheir menu could be richer. I don't think I saw 'pollo en jocon', 'saq-ik', 'caldo de gallina', 'salpicon de panza', and such things. It would also be great if they had thick, handmade corn tortillas, but these hardly appear anywhere I go so I cannot hold it against them. It would be also nice if besides rellenitos de platano they also offered simply sliced fried plantain with fried beans on the side as well, or fried banana. All of it may seem redundant but they are good in their own special ways.\n\nService is friendly but slow, they will take time to bring the beer (they have some of the Guatemalan beers there, for the curious), the food and the bill.  They do check on you to see if you are missing tortillas for your meal, and they also offer a couple of courtesy melon slices some times.\n\nFinally, the thing that really goes against them is the aspect of the place. Poorly lit, smells like fish (hopefully from the fish dishes they serve), somewhat shabby. They could improve a lot on this and that would get them 4 starts. Don't be misled, the fishy smell at the entrance has very little relation to how good the caldo de res is.

Salpicon Beef.  mmmm.  It's basically a cold beef salad with orange juice, mint, onions, cilantro and onions and  served with soft and crunchy tortillas, rice and beans.  It was perfect with the HOT salsa.  We also tried the chilitos rellenos and plantanos.  everything was great!", "author": "Erick A."}

I made a mistake and ordered the fried chicken things instead of just the open taco's and for the main dish I ordered the chicken (and the person I was with wanted it fried) and we got it without.  I think the key is to be able to speak spanish.  My spanish is pretty bad which is why I messed up ordering.  Careful of the hot sauce, it's muy picante!  The decor is pretty cool and they are very friendly.  I'd definitely give it a try if you're in the neighborhood.", "author": "Mitch A."}

I emigrated when I was 22 so I still have a very good memory of what the Guatemalan seasoning is. \nI unfortunately did not like the place. It reminded more of a \"comedor\" where most people eat daily during their hour lunch break. The food is not entirely bad but is more like bland home meals. Like I said not the kind you get at a very \"comida tipica\" place in Guatemala. I would also like to see more indigenous plates like subanik or authentic Guatemalan tamales or cack ik.", "author": "Joseph B."}

This was my first venture to a Guatemalan restaurant so I can only judge on the flavors of the dishes, which were ordered semi-randomly.  Tried the shrimp appetizer -- the shrimp came in a overpoweringly sweet tomato-based sauce, which was a bit better with addition of the side dish of volcano hot sauce.  Tried two types of tamales -- the banana leaf variant with chicken and olives was not flavorful, being accompanied by a thick gravy, but the other cornhusk tamale was excellent.  Pork adobado was the star of the night, juicy and flavorful.  Prices were reasonable and the service excellent.  I'm willing to try it again and see what the other dishes are like.", "author": "Dave S."}

I recently came back from a month in Guatemala and was seriously missing plaintains, refried black beans, and Guatemalan fresh cheese, and was quite happy to see them at San Miguel Restaurant in their \"Plato de San Miguel.\"  Now, the beans and plaintains were not exactly as good as they were in Xela, Antigua, or even touristy Panajachel, but they were more than good enough.  (The people next to us had a plate of \"tostadas,\" which are actually called \"tacos\" or \"enchiladas\" in Guatemala, I've already forgotten which, which looked pretty good.)  They also have actual Guatemalan beer there -- including the omnipresent \"Gallo\" beer, which is called \"Famosa\" here to avoid confusion with a certain line of cheap wines.  Unlike another Central American restaurant in the Mission, Poc Chuc, San Miguel is very down-home, folks from the community eat there, and the server spoke Spanish to me even though I don't exactly jump out as looking like a Spanish speaker -- which is great, since I need every chance I can to work on my marginal Spanish.", "author": "moosedog i."}
