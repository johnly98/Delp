This is such a whimsical piece of art designed by married couple, Claes Oldenburg & Coosje Van Bruggen!  I was fortunate enough to view three of their works of art in three cities in a span of three weeks without even realizing it until I looked up their other works!\n\nYou can find Cupid's Span along Embarcadero, in Rincon Park, just south of the Ferry Building.  It was installed in 2002.  The Bay Bridge is highly visible in the background.  Coosje van Bruggen decided she wanted the front of the bow downward and the feathers of the arrow in the air.  I read that the feathers really do move in the wind, how cool!  Coosje said it could also be interpreted as a tightened version of a suspension bridge, and that seemed to be perfect for the pair as they continued with their plans.  It is huge at roughly 60ft tall!  It is definitely visible from afar!\n\nThis sculpture is listed as one of the 15 Most Beautiful Places To Get Married in SF!  Not sure I would choose this place, but I guess others have!\n\nIt is worth having a look at and taking pictures.  I'm glad we could incorporate seeing this in our busy day of sightseeing with my friends!", "author": "Alana M."}

I'd advise to go with someone to help you take those fun photos. I tried doing some selfies but couldn't get the right angles or get in the right position to take a fun shot. I looked like a weirdo out there trying to take some photos that didn't turn out to be posting worthy.\n\nThis gardening around this huge bow & arrow is well maintained. But if you get a bit closer to the bow & arrow itself, it needs a little love. I remember seeing something stuck at the top end of the bow, a balloon I think. And with the \"friendly\" seagulls, there's massive amounts of poop all over the figure.\n\nIt does add to the character of the area. A random, huge bow and arrow by the bay shore is pretty interesting. And as I mentioned early, photo worthy for your social media addiction.", "author": "Antonio L."}

He looked at me and said we've driven by it a few times. Hmm...\n\nWhen we finally parked at a metered parking right in front of it and preceded to head towards the Ferry Building was the only time I've seen it up close. Apparently I didn't know how big it was and frankly baffles me how I missed not seeing it. The huge sculpture depicted a Cupid's bow and was situated on a lawn with bay & city views. The backdrop was the Bay Bridge. It is a great spot for photo ops. People were relaxing on the grass enjoying the Bay views and some even waaay too relaxed as I could smell weed when I walked by a couple of young folks who were apparently enjoying smoking it. I'm not sure if Prop 64 includes smoking it in public. Meh, Bay Area pot laws are confusing to me.  \n\nThe sculpture was placed on a hill, where the arrow was sunk under the surface of plants and prairie grasses. So big and colorful that hubby had to cross the street to get a full view and get a good shot for me. The sculpture is the centerpiece of Rincon Park and it is on a nice spot. It's no wonder Cupid chose this very spot along the waterfront to shoot its arrow. Glad I finally got to see it.\n\nReview #0926", "author": "May A."}

I don't know if the first thing that comes to mind is Eros when mentioning San Francisco as that should be Las Vegas, IMHO. I can see if this was The Castro and it would make perfect sense, but I still like the piece, regardless. The first rendition of the sculpture had the arrow pointing towards the sky, but they had structural challenges so they decided to point it downwards and making the feathers as the focal point. \n\nThe object of an art piece is to evoke an emotion - whether good or bad, it's very subjective and open to interpretation to the individual. You either like it or you don't, and you surely can't please everyone. I happen to like it as it blends quite well and also stands out within the surrounding location. You can also view it from different angles, backgrounds and different perspective at different times and gives you something different every time. \n\nI also find it appropriate that it's pointing down towards the heart of San Francisco, where many people have left theirs.", "author": "John G."}

I don't understand why people think it's okay to climb on sculptures.\n\nMore fun facts: Since San Francisco has the reputation as the \"home port of Eros,\" artists Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen decided to use Cupid's bow and arrow and created it to look like it was shot into the earth. It is made of stainless steel, structural carbon steel, fiber-reinforced plastic, cast epoxy, and polyvinyl chloride foam; then painted with polyester gelcoat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-04", "description": "Coosje van Bruggen and Claes Oldenburg created the infamous sculpture called Cupid's Span through the commission of the founders of Gap, Donald and Doris Fisher, with the intention of connecting the sea and land to an intangible form called love. To them, it was inspired by San Francisco, known as the city of love and sexual freedom personified by the Greek God Eros and the love between the married artists.  Due to the location of the sculpture, passengers can view it from the Bay Bridge when driving, and it is easily accessible from the Embarcadero BART Station. It's in a location that profits the GAP headquarters as well as the BART community.\n\nMany synthetic materials were used to create Cupid's Span, located at Rincon Park. The two artists had used vinylester resin, E-Glass, PVC core, steel armatures for the shape, and two types of gel coats. Van Bruggen and Oldenburg were influenced by the idea and theme of love Since San Francisco is the city of sexual freedom, they used the form of Cupid's weapons to recreate the physical manifestation of Eros. The colors of the entire sculpture are very saturated and warm. The bow is a warm tanned brown color, while the shaft is colored as stainless steel. The fletching is probably the most distinct part of the sculpture for the very distinctive saturated red color. The red tip of the fletching is the symbol of love, while the arrow, being at a diagonal view towards the ground, symbolizes fertility. The surrounding nature is healthy and Cupid's Span emphasizes fertility, love for the community, and finding love within the city.\n\nIt is important to understand the intentions of Oldenburg and van Bruggen, which were that their idea of love has been manifested into their sculpture. They also wanted to show how fertile the land is and to give back to the earth. They made the sculpture pointed downwards towards a small puddle of lush green grass in Rincon Park, adjacent to the GAP Headquarters, instead of being right side up with the arrow pointing towards the sky. According to van Bruggen and Oldenburg, their intention was to create a sculpture that symbolized \"romantic nostalgia\" due to the rich history of sexual freedom in San Francisco.  Both couples had been married for a long time, so the sculpture symbolizes the marriage of the Fishers as well as the married artists themselves.\n\nWhen writing about the relationship between the accessibility of public space, art, and money, Boris Groys's article called \"Art and Money\", states, \"... art installation ... builds a community of spectators precisely because of the holistic, unifying character of the space produced by the installation. The true visitor of the installation is not an isolated individual, but a collective of visitors.\"  By placing Cupid's Span adjacent to the Gap building, the headquarters is able to take advantage of visitors and market their brands, Gap Inc., Banana Republic, and Old Navy, to those who do not know the fashionable brand. By marketing brands, this ties in with David Harvey's \"Right to the City\" article which states, \"the quality of urban life has become a commodity for those with money, as has the city itself in a world where consumerism, tourism, cultural and knowledge-based industries have become major aspects of urban political economy.\"  The Fishers are able to take advantage of promotions by creating a public space where any social class can gather. Janna Malamud Smith's article \"the Importance of Public Space in a Fractured World\" states, \"...the poorest visitors and the richest to have the same sense of belonging.\"  Tourists and locals are able to visit the sculpture, admire it while taking pictures, and provide their personal opinions about the value of the sculpture. \n\nWhen I observed the sculpture, my first opinion was that it was really clean and well-maintained. The grass and shrubbery were well-nurtured and there was not a single piece of trash to be seen, despite the abundance of visitors. I interviewed several people who were walking around the park with their kids, or taking photographs, about their opinion on the sculpture. According to a couple who had paused to take pictures, they said the sculpture was a symbol of love. Another person said it was an ugly piece that did not fit with the environment and blocked the view of the majestic buildings behind it. Another keen observer said it looked like a ship on land, due to the way the bow and shaft were angled. To that observer, it depicted an outline of a ship with a vertical mast with no sail. In my opinion, I now see that resemblance, but only after that observer pointed it out and I found it quite fitting since it does overlook the San Francisco Bay.\n\nThe theme of love is said to emerge from Cupid's Span, a sculpture commissioned by the GAP founders, the Fisher family. Both the artists, Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen were able to take the theme further to create a physical embodiment of fertility, freedom.", "author": "Theresa C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-03-25", "description": "I like art. Any art. Or  maybe more accurately, anything that is designed to provoke the senses. Toward that end, I think \"Cupid's Span\", a 2002 sculpture by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, fulfills that purpose.\n\nWhen I first saw the bow and downward-pointed arrow, I immediately thought it was a response to Tony Bennett's \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\". I just figured Cupid must be this gargantuan being flying among the Skylab debris out in space trying to shoot arrows at Tony's heart. I don't find it ugly...I just find it amusing much like the Doggie Diner Head out on Sloat. It ain't Michelangelo, but we ain't Florence either.\n\nWhen the sun beats down on it, you can try lying down where the arrow's shadow falls, though you will be moving like a clock hand to keep up with it. Of course, you also have to worry about fecal matter, whether it's canine or otherwise. Apparently it's good enough for young newlyweds since they have their photos taken there, but I wish people would stop treating it like a climbing apparatus. I think it's pretty shameful how thos hooligans climb it for kicks and deserve a few cracked ribs for their impertinence.\n\nI still think Chicago has the right idea with their big bean in Millennium Park (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2DfcXGtDv7T_rnvl4lHzaQ?select=Tesh_WSkrUQZrl8L8TI6_Q). It's also a big outdoor art sculpture, but it feels more interactive, and the reflections are cool because it makes for fun-house images of the skyline. I just wish future art pieces in San Francisco could take into account the city's beautiful skyline itself as part of the art.

It's a jumbo-sized bow and arrow aimed at the ground, in the same vein as the world's largest thermometer and a gigantic ball of twine. \n\nI don't know. Trying to dig up any information on the statue I come up with the same quoted phrase every single Google hit: that the statue \"was inspired by San Francisco's reputation as the home port of Eros.\" \n\nNo further explanations. \n\nBut who calls San Francisco that, though? And why IS it this so-called \"home port of Eros\"? \n\nAfter consulting the artist's website, they reference a myth about Eros/Cupid shooting the earth to make it fertile (another story of which my searches for it are turning up fruitless). \n\nIt's like they offered these semi-poetic answers and we're just supposed to blindly go, \"Oooooooh, I get it.\"\n\nReally this just seems like a joke. Someone made up a couple Eros-related references telling us it's this fine, expensive cloth that only the most sophisticated of us can see. Then they went so far as to make elegant robes of this otherwise invisible cloth, figuratively, by actually constructing \"Cupid's Span\" and sticking it on the waterfront between the Ferry House and Bay Bridge and keeping it there permanently.  \n\nI'm not saying that public art should always be serious, and that it can't be fun and whimsical, but it's pretty tragic when you've got this expansive, kitschy eyesore out in the open while the Gandhi statue (http://www.yelp.com/biz/gandhi-statue-san-francisco) is being hidden away in a parking lot, donor-related controversy or not.", "author": "Christine A."}

I almost have to take a picture every time I walk by it... but none better than the night shot I found online and added to the gallery.", "author": "Derek K."}

It is so much fun to see how it is used on a daily basis.  Kids play on it, the homeless recline near it, but the very best is when the wedding parties pull up with their photographers.  There is such a sense of joy when these groups make their way around the large piece of public art to get just the right picture.  Then that sense of play carries over and they just have some fun hanging around until it's time to move on.  Thank you, San Francisco, for this great piece.", "author": "Delaine Z."}

Other than the obvious bay waters, it's the closest thing to nature around where I work.  Of course, nature doesn't have cupid's arrow, so that makes it more fun.  It makes it seem like I landed in the right place at the right time....or....like I just barely escaped with my life. \n\nAs a tourist, I saw it from afar and wondered \"wtf\" is that?! It really, really, is an arrow in the ground.  Really.  Still don't know why, but that's probably not the point.\n\nDog friendly.  Lunch friendly.  Quiet reading time friendly.

It may even be my favorite sculpture in SF, period. \n\nI adore Claes Oldenburg's interpretation of Cupid's mythical bow and arrow of looooooove with this oversized piece. I know it's Oldenburg's schtick to transform everyday items into oversized and colorful pieces, but this sculpture has such a playful sense of humor to it - I always smile when I pass it. \n\nEven though the bow is stuck in the hillside, it's in action to me....infusing love into downtown SF.", "author": "Laura G."}

But this absurd bit of hokum is just too lame for me. It neither reflects on the space it resides in, nor the city which it claims as home. The grounds around it, however, are a marvelous spot to stop for a bit in the windy sunshine on a nice day, to have a coffee or lunch or people watch. But egads, folks: this is tackiness taking on new heights! Imagine in 30 years what this behemoth of a slightly shiny pop-art relic will seem in the eyes of passersby.\r\n\r\nA bow and arrow with the tip and arch just barely buried underground? Would that the whole damn thing were just a bit deeper. Like, say, completely underground. An open vista out toward the bay would be nice, or maybe a new bench.", "author": "sascha b."}

It's an interesting piece of San Francisco that I hope will be here for a while.\n\nSometimes I wonder if the bow has landed in San Francisco and that is why we are so full of love in this town. It's just seeping all of the magic from Cupid's bow into our town...seeping...that's a good word...\n\nRegardless, I love the overall size of it.
