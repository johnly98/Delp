Many good choices there but enough already. Let's venture out Mom. Why eat delicious tried and true next door when you can drive 20 minutes across town, do the loop-de-loop looking for parking, and hear your kids make fake upchuck sounds when they see the caviar or tongue at this Russian restaurant?\nColor your palette. My 2018 mantra. Even if you need an aspirin accompaniment. \n\nWe ordered the beef stew with noodles. The noodles were a bit over-cooked, the meat tender but not flavorful and the sauce flavor was good even if the texture was gloopy. The black bread we ordered wasn't up to my Polish mother's standards as she noted oh 3-4-10times and the stuffed with meat cabbage did not have that hint of sweet as her preparation does so, she nixed that too. I thought it was proper and fine. The fresh cucumber salad with dill was delicious. \nWe had too the chicken which was all thigh and moist but had a slimy mouth feel as if a minute or two more on the grill top would have helped. The stuffed dumplings with potato were good, and had been nicely saut\u00e9ed post boil. \n\nI can't say we were wowed in any way. They were as well doing some sort of construction during the dinner hour and they actually at one point started drilling something. Wow that was disruptive. \n\nThe service was terrific and the staff were friendly. They did however bring out our dishes one at a time thinking we were going to share each one. A miscommunication clearly. \n\nI still am glad to have gone. I think all experiences are somehow beneficial. I know that sounds odd but it's how I feel. The food was pretty good, the atmosphere pleasant and being fortunate enough to be together with my family when time is precious as we all lead such busy lives; I just felt grateful. \nMaybe if they'd have poisoned me I'd not be.", "author": "Peddie A."}

There's nothing about any of that which brings me joy or happiness while pretty much every Russian thing I consumed at Red Tavern did just that.  \n\nOur party of 6 dined here in the sleepy Outer Richmond, sating ourselves with too much food and ample good cheer.  This restaurant, with dishes that harken back to a time pre-dating the small-plate craze, is proof that San Francisco is not 100% overpriced food from which you leave hungry.  Perhaps we over-ordered (we did), but I took home leftovers equivalent to an additional two meals.  This is hearty fare.  \n\nIn a perfect world, every meal would begin with a Blini Tower.  For $38.50 (serves 2 - 3), this tower comes with crepes, sour cream, caviar, smoked salmon (wrapped around thinly sliced-lemon), and another wonderful fish.  We shared two towers between 6 people and it was adequate though I'll admit I'd probably be happy with a single platter to myself.  Pure deliciousness.  \n\nA Russian amongst us explained that we must get \"Olivie\" ($8.75), an authentic  concoction akin to both potato salad and egg salad.  Filling and satisfying, I liked that too.\n\nDumplings (Pelmeny) excited me less than Stuffed Cabbage Rolls (Golubtsy) which were ample in portion and quite good.  Short Rib Beef Stew excited me more than the pastry puff-topped Beef Stroganoff (very good as a leftover) though that enticed me a bit more than the Chicken Shashlik which tasted like a grilled chicken I might make at home.  Even ranking the food in order of like to like-less however, I come away with a single conclusion:  I basically liked it all.\n\nWith a most reasonable $12 corkage fee and hearty entrees running $17 - $22 Red Tavern feels like a bit of a throwback.  The interior is nicer than that of any restaurants in the surrounding blocks (not a high bar to scale) and is comfortable, not fancy.  \n\nWith one exception, I found Red Tavern to be a perfect place for a group gathering as well as a fantastic spot to sate my hunger:  The obvious accompaniment to that Blini Tower is a shot or two of Russian Vodka, not sold here at Red Tavern.  Just as Trump is overlooking the recommendation of additional Russian sanctions, I was able to overlook the missing accompaniment.  And just like that, it didn't make me happy, but life continued.  \n\nRed Tavern is quite good.", "author": "Tracey A."}

Our party of 6 ordered a variety of meals and shared them to get a sample of all the offerings.  I've eaten Russian food before so there were no surprises.  I did enjoy some of the dishes and got some ideas on how to make my own cooking a little better.  Here's my impressions:\n\n- Beef Stroganoff: Came in a bowl with an impressive puff pastry top and kasha (buckwheat).  I think the trick to make great beef stroganoff is to have the beef come out full of flavor and tender.  This beef was thick, lacking flavor and not especially tender.  The gravy was good though, so ignoring the meat, it was good.  The kasha was not so good - it was rather bland, though it had caramelized onion in it which was good. \n\n- Olivie : a traditional Russian potato salad was good with bits small pieces of grilled chicken in it.  Great idea!  Grilled chicken in the potato salad!\n\n- Russian Blinys Tower: This was our favorite and will always be on order when we visit Red Tavern!  Caviar was salmon egg and the smoked sturgeon was everyone's favorite.  Very nice.\n\n- Siberian Style Pelmeny: I liked these - though they are usually served with a bowl of vinegar to dip into - the vinegar was missing.  Sofie thought the meat could have been spiced more.\n\n- Short Rib Beef Stew: everyone enjoyed this.  It comes with noodles.  The beef had flavor.\n\n- Chicken Shashlyk: grilled chicken was tender and tasted grilled.  Probably the same chicken in the olivie.\n\n- Golubtsy - Stuffed Cabbage Rolls: After the Blinys Tower, this was the best in my opinion because it is distinctly Russian and very tasty.\n\n- Blueberry: a blueberry port wine that was interesting, but not really amazing to me.  Reminded me of Mogen David wines.\n\n- Saperavi wine: A Georgian wine that they have been drinking for 6 to 8 thousand years.  Dark and earthy tasting.  If \"rustic\" has a taste, this is the wine that would taste \"rustic\".\n\n- Corkage is $12 if you want to bring your own wine.\n\n- Want vodka with your Bliney Tower?  So do I, but they don't have it because they don't have the license to sell hard liquor.\n\nThe Red Tavern was packed out on the Friday evening we were there.  Service was good!  The Red Tavern has an interesting device on the table that we used to get service.  Just press the button and they show up.  The device looks a little cheesy - but it works quite well!  Press the button and the server shows up in less than 30 seconds!  \n\nNext time we eat at Red Tavern, we will have the beef tongue.", "author": "Steve S."}

We arrived at the restaurant at 12:50 and we were not allowed in until one. The place was empty although eventually about three people came in.  The restaurant is dark, a bit formal looking and not terribly inviting.  \n\nThe four of us ordered cabbage rolls, meat blintzes and pork loin schnitzel, as well as pickled vegetables. The food was good, but without the flavor one expects ( maybe incorrectly?) of Russian food. The cabbage rolls were bland - not bad, just bland. The schnitzel was the best of our items - freshly fried, with a cabbage side. The pickled vegetables were very tasty, but the meat blintzes were also just ok. The borsch was good, not great.

Most of them suck. Unless you are in Brighton Beach or want to spend too much. \nOf course there are some exceptions and it was nice to add this place to that list. Went with my sister on a weeknight. She's spoken highly of this place, since she's been there several times before. Nice atmosphere and very good service. Since I am low carb right now, I am only going to judge by what I saw and ate, which wasn't enough probably to fully judge. I am sure I'll be back at some point and might edit my review. \nHad a glass of Saperavi, which is a dry and fruity Georgian wine. I've actually have never had it before and it's awesome. I consider myself a wine drinker and I was impressed. We basically just ordered a few dishes to share. There was black bread and butter, which I was told was very good as it was tauntingly eaten in front of me. We didn't get Olivie or blini with caviar, which I know is strange. I mean, you gotta get at least one of those, neither seems like a crime; at least a misdemeanor. We did order Borsht. I kinda wanted Salyanka, maybe I should of had both..hmm. Good flavor. I liked that there was meat in this one, but I felt like maybe it took away from the natural sweetness a little bit. Sour Cream of course is a must and it was a satisfying dish. Also ordered the herring. This is another classic Russian offering. Onions and some oil. This was good. I wouldn't say it was anything special or I haven't had a better version, but it was good nonetheless. Now, I wanted to get the lamb kabob, but my sister insisted we get the beef stroganoff. I am usually not a fan, but this was well, just ok. Served like a breadbowl, you have to peel off the little bread hat. Nice pretty presentation, but I thought the beef was a bit dry and it wasn't creamy enough. That's all we had, so I do feel like it just wasn't very much. I want to come back and get a bigger sample size, but I did want to write a review since there just aren't enough decent Russian places. 3.5 rounding up to 4 for service, atmosphere, and wine selection.", "author": "Boris S."}

With Kathy A. from the 808 (https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=OTA-qLc1v4M9hA7rJXiCTQ) and Al L. (https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8qpFUPR1wd3uz8N1QaWj_A) (keep writing Al, hopefully you'll get that 2017 badge), you knew Yelp would come up since it was our first common bond in meeting in over a year.  Being in our fare city, Kathy kindly invited us to join two relatives for a midweek dinner.  Here's what we shared, family style:\n\nAppetizers\n1) Grilled beef tongue and horseradish (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pvWQmutSS3KeCKWWs_av8A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - I've had Chinese versions (five spice seasoning), lengua (Mexican or Spanish cuisine), and now this version.  Surprisingly tender and clean tasting.  Great with the red horseradish sauce.\n\n2) Olivie (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1D9HIvwFfzhqMriEvyL_jQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Subtitled \"Russian famous holiday salad\", think potato salad with a mix of ingredients that included eggs, beef, carrots, and green peas.\n\n3) Potato Zrazy (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XvN8YhGfuNCpoozcWY2-tQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - These packets of goodness (filled with meat, think thin skinned piroshky) went well with the sour cream dipping sauce.\n\n4) Mushroom Julienne Cocette (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lEpgeHjdA8GJ289dD5uZiA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Touted by many diners here, probably one of the surprising favorites of everyone at the table. Though the portions are on the modest side (we ordered two of these), the tins were empty after we polished off the last drops with our bread.\n\nEntrees\n5) Beef stroganoff (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YI2cnvf8OiKHjd-3o6SSqg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Apologies for not taking of picture of this deconstructed.  The creamy rich sauce went well with the pastry puff and reminded me of the tomato soup as Jeanty at Jack's.  Not for someone watching those calories or carbs.  The saut\u00e9ed cabbage was a nice complement.\n\n6) Pork loin schnitzel (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SBsbH182U3YyGXnouuDc8Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Pan fried nicely and not overly greasy.  Paired with a simple mashed potato for a basic comfort food plate.\n\n7) Golubtsky, cabbage rolls (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=einugXhwUn1Tv720PNk2sw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - These were tasty but didn't really wow us.  A good change of pace from everything else we ordered.\n\n8) Beef Sashlyk with cauliflower (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bR9DnHrEKb-wi_clIJ76EQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) and with vegetarian rice (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ygksNyRu6fKF396Oma9ayw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - The beef was unanimously the least favorite entr\u00e9e as it was very plain and lacked character as well as flavor.  Not a good sign when the protein is unfinished while the sides are gone.\n\nDesserts\n9) Napoleon (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nKAGrEWPNZ1XGq5FPkn2sw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Our host's must-order, this did not disappoint.  Served temperature cold, the creamy filling felt like soft serve ice cream.\n\n10) Russian Syrnikis (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OKu6j3Absef1v-GfKoK-Rw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - A bit rich for my palate but, if you are a cheesecake fan, you'll like this especially with their house made blueberry sauce.\n\n11) Russian blinis for two (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=B7Jg3rgUzRLWqSdF0Bb6vw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Similar to the Syrnikis, the lighter skin was crepe like and went well with that sauce.\n\nAl and I arrived right at 6 pm and our host and her friends arrived early due to the unpredictable traffic conditions in SF these days.  We were glad that they had a  head start on wine and appetizers as we didn't have to wait to chow down.  Walking in, we observed the dining room to be darkly lit but bright lighting under each table, giving an intimate cozy feel.  Seated against the right wall, our party of five was a bit away from the other diners who came and went as we caught up with each other's schedule and plans.  We may have even convinced two non-Yelpers to sign up for accounts... just spreading the word, you know.\nOur waitress did a good job in filling water bottles and removing plates despite being the only person at the front of the house.  The food was a four plus as our gracious host wouldn't allow us to fight for the bill... are you Chinese?!  Big thanks to Kathy for her graciousness and generosity.

Being a newbie to Russian fare, I was looking forward to this dinner.\n\nMike C and I arrived at 6pm and met Kathy A. and her two family members. They were enjoying a nice bottle of red wine and a couple of appetizers, Grilled beef tongue and Olivie, a Russian potato salad. I'm not a beef tongue fan since it's usually tough, but this was nicely grilled and was very tender. It was like a nice cut of steak.\n\nWe checked out the menu and each of us were tasked with choosing a main course. With each entr\u00e9e, you select an accompanying side dish of saut\u00e9ed cabbage, vegetarian rice, grilled cauliflower, buckwheat, mashed potatoes or garlic potatoes.  \n\nBefore our entrees arrived, we indulged on two additional appetizers that we had ordered.  The Mushroom Julienne Cocotte was so delicious. It was a mixture of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, grilled chicken that was baked in a three cheese blend. You spread some on the toasted French baguette and it was wow. I could have eaten the whole order on my own. Potato Zrazy - potato pancakes that were wrapped with sour cream, butter and feta. Different take on potato pancakes.  Very tasty. \n\nBeef Stroganoff with saut\u00e9ed cabbage - a nice presentation ala pot pie. The beef, mushrooms in a cream sauce were in a casserole bowl capped with a golden brown puffed pastry.  Beef and mushroom in a tasty sauce?  Yes, delicious!\n\nAn order of Beef Shashlyk with buckwheat and one with grilled cauliflower. Like the sides here more than the beef.  Beef was cooked well and was on dry side. \n\nPork Loin Schnitzel with mashed potatoes - having had Schnitzel in German restaurants, I was curious how the Russians made it. They used a light bread crumb coating and it was cooked to a golden brown.  Pork was light and tender.\n\nGolubtsy - stuffed cabbage rolls. A unique looking dish.  Stuffed with beef and rice and veggies in a tomato based sauce, it was tasty. \n\nNapoleon Cake, a famous Russian cake with vanilla cr\u00e8me in between layers of flaky pastry.  Delicious. \n\nRussian Syrniki - fried cheesecakes with sour cream and homemade blueberry preserves. \n\nRussian Blinis - crepes served with homemade blueberry preserves and cr\u00e8me fraiche.

When they are of the Yelp Elitists category, have an adventurous palate, it's even more fun.\n\nMet up with Bay Area Yelp foodies Mike C and Al A and along with a family duo we were a party of five agreeing to meet up at 6:00 for dinner reservations.  Since the drive into SF from Berkeley is always an experience we went over the Richmond Bridge, then over the Golden Gate Bridge, through the Park, arriving at Red Tavern half an hour before our allotted reservations time.  The plain exterior is not an indication of what to expect.  Open the door and you are greeted to an astonishing room filled with white tablecloths, red napkins and elegantly set dining spaces.  \n\nBeing the dedicated foodie that I am I just went with the flow...wine that is, a delightful bottle of 2010 Luigi Bosca Malbec.  The beautiful server brought a basket of bread, an order of Beef Tongue and the Olivie potato salad with the ordered wine.  Need I say we were starving as we anticipated this dinner for months!  First the tongue.  I do believe it was the absolute best plate of fork tender tongue I've ever eaten.  It was served with a small dish of beet colored horseradish, not hot, just flavorful.  I could have eaten a plate of only this but soon our SF buds arrived so we ordered another appetizer plate of the tongue, hey it was a shared appetizer.  We also ordered the Mushroom Julliene Coquette, another outstanding choice served with toasted baguette...one of those dishes you wish you could pick up the bowl and lick the remnants, the flavors were so good.  Also the Potato Zrazy was an incredible choice.  Two blinys stuffed with a yummy potato filling, sour cream with dill on the side.\n\nWe decided to each order an entree and share family style.  An order of Glubosky, aka as stuffed cabbage, simmered for hours in tomato and dill.  Pictures do not do the dish justice it just reminded me of being in my Nana's kitchen.  An order of Vienna Style Pork Schnitzel was served with fluffy mashed potatoes, very tasty.  Two orders of Beef Shashlyk, one with mashed potatoes and one with toasted cauliflower.  I wasn't a fan of the Beef Shashlyk and would try again but with lamb.  Probably the most dramatic dish served was the Beef Strogonoff.  A casserole of beef and mushrooms in a sour cream sauce topped with puff pastry.  Elegantly beautiful and tasted as delicious as it looked.\n\nWonderful entrees all consumed we were brought dessert menus.  One of everything was my first thought.  We shared two Napoleons, my favorite.  A plate of Blinys served with sweetened creme fresh and a berry preserves, my favorite.  Also Russian Syrnitki, a fried cheese cake served with Sour Cream and berry preserves, again my favorite.  \n\nOverall this was a fantistic dining experience.  The atmosphere, my dining companions, the food.  I'm planning a return visit sometime this year and will return to Red Tavern to enjoy the dishes I didn't try or forgot to order.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-11", "description": "The old, ethnic neighborhoods of SF are no more, even Chinatown is diverse.  We were told there is no such thing as a Russian sector like we remembered, and it is just as hard to find a real Russian restaurant.   Our attempt to visit a unique one in Jenner, Russian House #1, had failed this trip.  A matter of bad timing and loosely structured hours of operation.  But I do not accept failure easily, so I turned to the advice of a dear Russian lady and friend who gave us one name, Red Tavern.  \n\nIn typical SF fashion, we found Red Tavern snugly wedged between other tiny neighborhood businesses.  None were Russian, but rather Mexican, Chinese, Italian, and who knows what else.  I was totally not prepared for the elegant interior with white tablecloths, red cloth napkins, sparkling wine glasses at each table setting, deep red and gold walls with dark mahogany wood.  The real shocker was, there were two very large parties taking up most of the tiny restaurant and one smaller party of 7.  Humbled, I had forgotten to call for reservations.  Thankfully, the wait was minimal, perhaps 20 minutes.  We got lucky and got the sole table unreserved.\n\nThe menu consisted of a one-page listing that even included their beverages.  \n\nFirst came our bowl of Borscht.  I expected something different, more beet and beef tasting, less cabbage and too light a broth for my expectations, but it had an intensely beautiful color.  A plate of their almost cake-like, dark Russian Rye and butter was a big hit and complimented the soup.\n\nSecondly, came the Olivie Salad.  So glad we tried it.  This was basically a Russian potato salad, but the kicker was the chopped beef and other vegetable ingredients, topped with one olive and fresh dill leaves.  I would definitely get this again.\n\nEven though I was tempted by rabbit stew, various lamb dishes, Goulash, or even Shashlyk, it was the Golubtsy (cabbage roll) that ultimately won.  There were two huge rolls of delicious ground beef and rice, exotically seasoned, topped with a chunky tomato sauce and sour cream, sitting in a well seasoned broth.  Each was quite large, and so I happily saved one for another day.\n\nI had stressed to Mr. B about the reviews that recommended the Beef Stroganoff, and he easily caved.  Bite sized slices of lean beef in a sour cream gravy, it was a surprise to discover it came topped with puff pastry.  It was a showpiece and it was excellent.\n\nOur grand finale was a slice of Napoleon cake,  a multi-layered flaky pastry with whipped cream.  It was simple, but elegant.  With such a filling meal, most of that was relegated to a box to bring home.\n\nThis was a most satisfying meal and a rare find.  I would love to experience this again. Worthy of a strong 4.5 rating.", "author": "Wendy B."}

The three of us ordered different meals and shared them family-style. My favorite was the stuffed cabbage rolls - very meaty and the sauce was just right. The pork lion schnitzel was very tender and cooked perfectly. The side order of cabbage was also good. The third entree was potatoes filled with meat which was rather bland for me. \n\n Good selection of wine and the male server was professional and courteous.  The prices are also very reasonable.

We came 20 mins past our reservation time. When we arrived, the place was empty, only 3 tables were being used. I called at the time of our reservation and then again after 8 mins to make sure if it was still okay to come as we were running late due to traffic in downtown San Francisco. This whole time I'm assuming the place is packed and I need to come on time, if not, inform and get approval. She said it was okay to come on the phone even though running late. But somehow after a whole 40 min drive from union square to Richmond, she decides maybe they won't like us to eat there anymore. 20 mins isn't that long, we called twice to get permission, Place was empty, reservation was totally not needed that day. Like, seriously? We had to beg to sit. Still don't get what had happened. \n\nBad start.. I know. \nWe ordered like there was no tomorrow. \n\n2. Food:\n- Borsch: good, simple \n- Olivier: my favorite in general and they did good! I hate soggy ones and they really did a great work!\n- cucumber salad: great! Simple ingredients, magic result \n- red cabbage salad: I don't like cabbage, so I am biased. \n- grilled beef tongue: I can eat it for the rest of my life! \n- Baltic herring: was good!!! \n- Siberian pelmeni: highly recommended \n- lamb: they can really cook\n- Blinis: I never get it for dessert, so it was new and I loved it. \n\n3. Service: \nThis part is really related with part 1 pertaining to the reservations. The waitress is angry. Just have minimum contact and eat your food. You'll be fine, but definitely not your cozy and friendly service. But will bring your food on the table fast. \n\n4. Atmosphere: \nThis place isn't that cozy.

The good thing was they were right about the food although I think the prices are more in keeping with current San Francisco trends than the motherland. I went with a friend who is game for anything and like me their eyes are bigger than their belly so we tried lots of different things. \nWe stuck to a traditional path starting with Olivie - 9.75, a russian potato salad often made with beef but this was chicken.\nthen we had the blini with caviar which was actually salmon roe not sturgeon roe. Russian Blinys Tower - 39.50. It also came with smoked salmon and a luncheon meat as well as bini of course. It was disappointing to not have sturgeon roe.\nWe also had the Grilled Beef Tongue - 12.95. I love beef tongue but this had a bitterness I am not used to in tongue and didn't care for.\nOur final savory course was the Beef Stroganoff - 23.50 which was a real Russian stroganoff meaning meat in cream sauce served with a dough crust over it and no noodles. It was delicious!\n\nWe finished with Sour Cherry Dumplings 15.95. The  Vareniky were expensive but delicious. \n\nWe drank the non-alcohol root beer which was a bit too bitter for my taste.\n\nThe atmosphere is actually more modern than the Russian restaurants I've been to in NYC, Toronto and places with large Russian populations. There were three tables that were not Russians but we were treated just as nice as the Russians. All the dishes added up so it's not a cheap meal but I think it's probably a good place if you want to eat good authentic Russian food in a comfortable neighbourhood setting.", "author": "DeathandFood H."}

We checked on Yelp, and Red Tavern came up as highly rated. What better snack food than Russian food. We had the pelmeni (meat filled dumplings), beef tongue, and mamaliga (ukranian style polenta with cheese and butter). We were also asked if we wanted some fresh bread with the beef tongue, and said yes. While we were there, a local brewery delivered a quarter keg of fresh brewed beer. These might have been the best pelmeni that we've had, even better than the ones we make ourselves at home. The mamaliga was a huge portion, enough for all three of us. The beef tongue was tender, excellent, with good flavor. Even the bread that came with it was good.

We also ordered the cherry dumplings and the lady strongly suggested it was more like a dessert even though it was in the dumpling section.  We wanted it to come with our meal but she frowned upon that.  I liked the doughy taste of the dumplings.

Our server, the only one we saw all evening, was more than a bit taciturn.  Reading other reviews here I have to wonder if that might be a cultural thing.  My beloved and I are both on the wagon for health reasons, but I did notice quite a selection of wine and beer available.  We ordered iced tea.  \"No iced tea.  Only hot.\"  We were both sort of taken aback by that.  (We had water.)  \n\nI had the borscht and he had the cabbage salad.  My soup was good, but salty, and not quite to my liking (not their fault--I make a mean borscht and that's my standard). Beloved loved my borscht.  It was a generous helping and contained a lot of meat.  He loved his cabbage salad, too, and I liked it, but it was dressed with a healthy portion of sesame oil.  Odd, at least to my palate, but that's just me.\n\nWe each ordered the mushroom appetizer, which was insanely good.  The portions were teeny-tiny, though.  The server correctly insisted that we each get our own order, but at $8 a pop, it was pricey for a soapdish-sized portion of shrooms with melted cheese and two slices of grilled bread.  (Still crazy good, though.)\n\nBeloved's Beef Stroganoff was a show-stopper, served in a deep bowl with a huge dome of brown, fragrant bread covering it.  (No noodles.)  My lamb was odd and kind of sad.  I should have asked them how they prepared it--my bad--but they were gray and just...sad.  They were served with a tomato/cilantro salsa--I kid you not--and angel hair cabbage that had been very heavily cooked.  Not bad, but not great, to my liking.  I would never order the lamb again.  I wondered if it had been cooked and reheated.  (Is cilantro a Russian thing?)\n\nWe shared an order of blintzes for dessert, and they were simple and very delicious.  Tip:  get an entire order for yourself.  I ordered coffee with cream and sugar.  I was served, halfway through our dessert, a cappuccino, with a packet of sugar and a packet of Splenda on the saucer.  As the server set it down, she announced \"Coffee with milk.\"  I didn't feel like arguing, especially since she was serving the entire dining room and trying to clean up the beer an exuberant patron had accidentally swept onto the floor.  A man who I presumed to be the owner sat in the corner with a handful of people, pouring drinks from a fancy round bottle of something that looked expensive.  I think if he'd at least made motions of helping clean up that spilled glass of beer and replacing it I would give this place an extra star.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, good but odd.  We may go back, if the proprietor will let us, for the mushrooms and the blintzes.", "author": "Earline A."}

We arrived at 7 pm this past Saturday, still hadn't had our entrees by 8.30 . The restaurant had two other large parties (we were 8) who appeared to have eaten their mains by the time we were seated- so that shouldn't have held up our food but something did. The appetizers were tasty but overpriced- $13 for two blini pancakes and $10 for a delicious but small mushroom appetizer with ONE piece of bread? We ordered more bread- $3.75 for a bowl of sliced rye and sourdough, enough said.\n\nI had heard from a friend the stroganoff was great- alas i can not confirm- they were out of stroganoff- we found this out when we were trying to order- my friend and i shared the goulash- i think cost more than $20, tasted okay but meat a bit tough, not at all tender. It came with a plate or rubbery dry noodles. We were so hungry at that point we tried to eat some- but it was pretty disappointing. Also entrees according to the menu come with a side dish- which when i tried to order mine was told  'it comes with noodles' . Sure- but i want the garlic potatoes anyway. When these didn't arrive with the entrees i asked again and was told 'You can't eat potatoes with goulash' Oh really? the potatoes were reluctantly brought and were actually very good, a good substitute for the terrible noodles.\n\nMy friends had the lamb sausage- not terrible but not that good. One of our table choose the cherry dumplings- like having cherry pie for diner- was too sweet, a very strange dish. It also arrived maybe 15 minutes before the rest of the entrees.\n\nIt appeared that there was only one waiter, who wasn't too focused on our table.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-24", "description": "Brought my son here for his graduation dinner because he wanted Russian food and the restaurant near us in Walnut Creek was closed for dinner. I'm very glad they were because I would never have made the trip in to the city otherwise. I was in Kazakhstan for 3 months adopting my son (the one who graduated) and ate out every day at local places throughout the country.  Going to Red Tavern is as close to being back there as I have found anywhere.  I could seriously have been back in Almaty the minute I walked in the place.  For the reviewers upset with the seemingly aloof servers, I must agree with several others in saying that this is just authentically how it would be if you were in Kaz or Russia. We in the US are very used to constant customer service and interaction, but that's just not how it is.  In the words of ex girlfriends everywhere, \"it's not you, it's them.\"\n\nThe Good:  As authentic Russian food as I have found anywhere.  We basically sampled everything that looked good between the 7 of us, so we had a good cross sampling of the bill of fare. Oh and the bread is awesome - great rye bread.  Loved it!\nWe started with the soups, and we really liked all 3 that we had.  The borsch (beet, cabbage, and beef) was a thinner broth style but still had great flavor. The Solyanka (smoked meat soup with pickles) had deep smoky meaty flavor just like I remembered it from Kaz. And the Kharcho (Hearty Lamb and beef) had great flavor as well.  You really can't go wrong with any of those.\n We tried several salads including the Olivier (Holiday salad with eggs, potatoes, beef and peas) reminded us of a classic potato salad with a couple twists.  Not one of my favorites, but still very authentic tasting.  The Bulgarian salad (tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and feta) reminded me of a Greek salad with Persian cucumbers with a lighter dressing.  I actually enjoyed that one very much. The last salad was the red cabbage with raisins and sesame had a very light dressing of sesame oil and almost no vinegar.  Oddly enough it still worked well and was a hit with everyone but the kids.\nAppetizers:  Zucchini pancakes with salmon tartar and cr\u00e8me fraiche - Most people liked this except that the salmon in this was smoked which most of the sushi tartar people were not expecting.  Not bad, just different. The meat blintzes had perfect pancakes with a ground meat filling.  I thought the filling was a little bland but loved the pancakes.  My son thought this was the highlight of the night. The pan fried potatoes home style was awesome. When we ordered it the server hesitated a bit and said that there was garlic in the potatoes which we were fine with.  When they came I realized the understatement she had made.  Huge garlic flavor on thin sliced potatoes with light oil coating.  Well seasoned but strong.  We love garlic so this was perfect for us.  If you're not into strong garlic flavor you might want to pass on this.\nWe then moved on to the Siberian pelmeny (tortellini like dumplings filled with seasoned veal).  This was very good as always, but I like pelmeny.\nFor the main course we shared the tavern meat platter including rack of lamb and  chicken and lamb kebabs.  These were cooked well and served with a choice of sides - we had the fried cauliflower and it was delicious.  There was nothing particularly outstanding about the flavor of the meats, but they were perfectly prepared.\nWe finished up with desert consisting of the cr\u00e8me puffs and Napoleon Cake.  Both were very good.  \n\nThe bad: Need to move the restaurant closer to my house in the east bay!\n\nthe mediocre:  Not a gourmet wine list, but not a bad one either. Prices maybe a little high, but not unreasonably so.\n\nOverall:  I have to agree that this may be the best Russian food I've had in the US. Very quaint d\u00e9cor.  Felt like I was back in Kazakhstan.  If you haven't had Russian food or want to revisit tastes from a previous trip you couldn't do much better.", "author": "John G."}

Red Tavern has been in business for 6 months and the place looks very nice inside. Bathrooms are well kept and so is the restaurant itself. Onto the food, my party and I ordered the beef stroganoff, rabbit stew, meat dumplings, zucchini pancakes and the entrees came with a side of pickled vegetables and potato wedges.\n\nThe beef stroganoff was my favorite as in arrived in a ceramic pot with a puff pastry topping. After you crack the puff pastry, steam puffs out of the pot and the beef smells really good. The beef is tender and the sauce is creamy just like how stroganoff should be. The meat dumplings with dill and creme fraiche is another favorite of mine. It reminds me of wonton dumplings but without the broth. I highly recommend those dishes at Red Tavern. The rabbit stew wasn't really a stew as it was more like a stewed rabbit entree. If you're a fan of Russian food or have never tried Russian food, I do recommend this place.

We ordered the borsch (always gotta try this), summer salad (love the excessive dill-- and would expect nothing less), baltic herring (oh yeah, full on), zucchini pancakes (good, but not our fav), beef tongue (fantastic dish), and the beef Stroganoff (best one I've ever had) with garlic potatoes. Pitcher of Czech beer and some phenomenal bread for dipping. I can't wait to come back here. Parking was easy on a Thursday night, a rarity on the weekends.", "author": "Brian J."}

But I loved everything I tasted. \n\nThe first visit, my friends (no pictures sad face) had the bitcochek, the fire-grilled chicken (can't remember that proper name) and the rabbit stew while I feasted on their chicken a la tapers, a garlic marinated and (pressed) roasted Cornish game hen. The first time we weren't asked about sides so they all came out with the tavern potatoes. I tried everything and was amazed at how moist and just packed with flavor everything was. The pork was juicy, the fire grilled chicken was like BAM! and my garlic Cornish game hen had the best crisped skin while still keeping moisture and not being so dried out like typical chicken. The rabbit stew was out of this world, but it is rich and there were lots of bones so beware. \nWe all couldn't stop raving about the freaking potatoes, I mean how do they do such magic to something so simple as potatoes. Moist and soft and fluffy, yet crispy too. ALIENS! Ha\n\nThe second visit I brought two new guests, they ended up both getting the cabbage rolls as they had had Russian style cabbage rolls in the past and loved them, while I picked out the bitcochek (marinated, breaded and fried pork loin). To be honest, I wasn't as wowed with mine as I was with my friend's the first visit , but it was still very moist and flavorful, but this time I felt I could taste the grease more I guess. The cabbage rolls came out in a sauce which my companions had said they weren't expecting but let me tell you, did in no way distract from the flavor. We also mixed up the sides this time, I tried the garlic potatoes, almost scalloped with a creamy garlic sauce, I wasn't much of a fan though. And we did the fried cauliflower, which I really liked. Along with the standard tavern potatoes. \n\nI did try the Russian root beer which is kvas, which reminded me of kombucha, a fermented tea thing, normally I would have drank it and I tried it a couple times but I'm immune compromised now and realized that probably wasn't te smartest since I didn't know much about how sanitary it is. \n\nWe also got this appetizer called the Mushroom Julienne Cocotte ($7.50) which was mushrooms and chicken baked in 3 cheese blend. The size was kind of humorous but we all agreed we would eat the crap out of it, they need a bigger portion. \n \n\nThe rabbit stew was the most expensive at around $21.95 or so, while the rest were between $14.95-$16. We felt a great value for the flavor. The service is cold and distant, like I would expect I guess, so don't expect smiles or friendliness or a loud voice. I didn't hear half of what the server asked haha", "author": "Tabitha E."}

Twice for my birthday with a large group and once for regular dinner.  I've been to many Russian restaurants (mostly in NY) and have to say the food here is spectacular.  It's like home cooking elevated to a higher level.  The ingredients are very fresh.  Everything is perfectly cooked and seasoned.  You can't go wrong.  I even approve of the borscht, which is frequently too sweet in other restaurants.  The ambiance is nice.  Service is good, but better if you're a Russian speaker (or have one in your group).  They have a beer and wine license, so if you bring your own vodka they will pour it into an unmarked container and provide you with shot glasses.  \n\nPS.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-09", "description": "I bit over a year ago, I went here with all intentions of trying the place because it is in my neighborhood and it has great reviews. \n\nThrough OpenTable, I was able to book a reservation for me and my boyfriend (at the time) really easily; however, I found out once we arrived that they were fully booked and they said they canceled my reservation right away (5-10 minutes later). Um, hello!! Not everyone has their OpenTable notifications and/or emails linked to their phones, so a phone call saying you canceled my booking would have been nice. \n\nAlso, if the place is fully booked, make sure people can't make reservations on the server you are using!! For this alone, my review is not a happy one as I was rather disappointed with their level of service. \n\nToday, I walked in with my friend for lunch. We stood by the door next to the wait to be seated sign, and no one even greeted us despite the fact that staff continued to walk in and out of the back (some even right pass us to go in/out of restaurant). After quite a while, we were seated and began to look over the menu. It takes a while for the food to come out, but we assumed it was made fresh - over salted in my opinion but that may be how the Russian cuisine is compared to what I am used to. \n\nThe bit that irked me and my friend was that the kind server suggested/asked if we would like bread, which we opt for. What we weren't told, was that there was a charge for this - most places we've been to that ask \"would you like to try our bread\" usually mean it's on the house but we want to see if you want the extra carbs. \n\nAnyway, overall, I don't think I would go here again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-17", "description": "I am of Russian origin and this is one of the best Russian food venues I have been to in the US. The beauty of the menu is that it has the old time favorites with a modern twist. \n\nAbout the food - everything I have tried has been very fresh, with delicate flavors which are not overpowering and certainly none of that grease from a village restaurant in Russia. It seems that the owners take pride in the ingredients they use just like I do at home, so the flavors are quite similar to my own cooking. \n\nCertainly a go-to place when I am in the city and don't feel like cooking. Some of my favorites are the blini platter with smoked fish and salmon roe, beef stronganoff, lula kebob, pan fried potatoes with garlic and dill are to die for! And of course the dumplings with sour cherry. Although they have a separate dessert menu, I prefer this dish for dessert with it's sweet/tart flavor. They also have an incredible selection of european draft beer and some really nice georgian wines (they have a bit of sweetness to them, similar to red zin, so likely not to be enjoyed by strict pinot or cab lovers).\n\nLast, but not least, I enjoy the fact that tablecloths are real, not paper and the place is very clean and comfortable. It is a very versatile venue that can be formal or casual, depending on your mood.\n\nDefinitely a good choice, especially with how reasonably it is priced (on average $6-10 appetizers and $15-25 entrees) \n\nSide note: In reading some of the other reviews I found that people are generally disappointed with the service. From my perspective - the waiters here are trained to serve, not socialize. They don't take extra time to make suggestions or check on how you are doing multiple times throughout your meal but they bring your food, clear the dirty plates and glance at you from the corner of the restaurant to see if you need their attention. I did not by any means find them to be rude and if they appear this way, it is probably something that is lost in translation. If you need them, just make eye contact and raise your index finger - they will get the message and come over!", "author": "Victoria G."}

I was the only non-white, non-Russian speaking patron here for dinner. Red Tavern is nestled in a block full of Asian restaurants in the Outer Richmond. A rather quiet restaurant with a somewhat romantic decor. Only one party of two were dining when we arrived for our 7pm reservation.\n\nWe knew we were in for a hearty meal so we didn't order too much food. So many things I wanted to try on the menu but ended up with:\n\n*Borsch: how can you not try borsch in a Russian restaurant? Flavor is not as strong as I anticipated, and could be thicker. Cabbage very well cooked with a piece of beef cheek.\n\n*Beef Stroganoff ($18.75):  saut\u00e9ed pieces of filet mignon with mushroom served in a sauce made of sour creme in a puff pastry. I could smell the dish as soon as the pasty is cut open revealing the piping hot beef. \n\n*Beef Cheeks Stew ($18.75): Okay. Americans would consider beef cheek a cheaper cut of meat, but to us Asians and the Russians, this is delicacy. Cut in cubes and textured like bavette steak, it's slow-cooked until beef is so tender that melts in my mouth. Flavor is very strong, hinting herbs and wine. It's served in a metal bucket with a lid.\n\nEach main course is allowed a side dish, which is predominantly potato. The beef cheek stew is served on a bed of potatoes. I should have picked fried cauliflowers.\n\nThe dining experience is good, although service can be slow (one server). Toward the end of our meal in walked a big party of 12, all speaking Russian. I can tell this restaurant is legit consider the exclusive patrons. I would definitely return to try the pelmeni (dumplings), the cabbage wrap, and the potato vareniki.", "author": "Matt Y."}

Hawaiian. Oriental (I'm not a freaking rug or vase OK!). Half Caucasian/half of all the aforementioned. \n\nOne time I was at my friend's house and her brother was having a party with 20+ dudes. One asked me, \"Are you Russian?\" to which I responded, \"Dude, do I look like Olga?!?!?\" WTF. No offense to the Olgas out there. \n\nThat was my only experience with Russian culture (not really an \"experience\" though), other than eating Pirozhkis at my high school beanery. Talk about needing to be cultured. \n\nEnter Red Tavern. \n\nQuietly opening in July 2011, Red Tavern took over Sadko which was also a Russian restaurant in San Francisco's Little Russia area (Outer Richmond). Finding street parking is a biatch in the area but there's a parking lot across Red Tavern that charges $3 for every 30 minutes. \n\nCombing through all the reviews, I was a bit scared before coming to Red Tavern. One star reviews mentioned being yelled at and being refused service. None of my Yelp friends had reviewed the place which made me even warier. I don't doubt the one star reviews. Service was as scary (in the beginning) as when I did something naughty as a child and had to face the wrath of my Chinese pitbull mom. *Hides in the corner* There's only one waiter and he is cold and brusque as can be which means I had to be on my very best behavior aka NO alkie for Cherylynn. BOO! At the end, he did warm up when I tried to make small talk with him so it's really just a cultural thing so don't take offense (just like rude service at Chinese restaurants). \n\nDo note that service is S-L-O-W. Don't come during peak dining hours or you'll be doing a lot of waiting. It took us 25 minutes just to pay the check and our reservations were at 5:30 PM. Yah, we eat dinner like old farts.\n\nOh, and don't be surprised when you walk in to have ALL eyes staring at you. A-W-K-W-A-R-D. We were the only Asian people in there amongst all natives which is always a good sign with any ethnic restaurant. \n\nCulturally impersonal and slow service aside, Red Tavern is a great neighborhood restaurant serving delicious Russian eats in a surprisingly upscale atmosphere http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iQEbftkjbnP3QrvHLhJaAg?select=tOs1W-4JvGcmPGxPWtVZIw#am3w0cH3gQHb3qdx3cUYjA. \n\nAs my first \"real\" experience with Russian cuisine, I found it to be most similar to Greek and German cuisine with things like Zucchini Pancakes, Schnitzel, and Kebabs on the menu. We started with the Zucchini Pancakes w/ Salmon Tartar & Sour Cream ($8.95) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iQEbftkjbnP3QrvHLhJaAg?select=tOs1W-4JvGcmPGxPWtVZIw#tOs1W-4JvGcmPGxPWtVZIw which were delightful (no comparison to Kokkari's though). The pancakes could have been crisper but they were delicious nonetheless with the silky smooth smoked salmon, \"salsa\", and creamy sour cream. As one of my favorite offal meats, our second appetizer of Grilled Beef Tongue w/ Creamy Horseradish Sauce ($9.50) didn't disappoint http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iQEbftkjbnP3QrvHLhJaAg?select=tOs1W-4JvGcmPGxPWtVZIw#3u3VcwzRs6vvTooH2p4YFg . The tongue was so soft and tender with a slight bite to it. The grill marks added a lovely smoky nuance. Carniwhores would rejoice over their Meat Platter of Rack of Lamb, Chicken & Lamb Lula ($42) for 2-3 people; 2 people if you're dining with a dude or 1 Mr. NSS who ate 3/4ths the platter and would have eaten the whole thing by himself if I wasn't there. MEAT HOG! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iQEbftkjbnP3QrvHLhJaAg?select=tOs1W-4JvGcmPGxPWtVZIw#TJ_oJAJanLz5PO_w0ZUtPg. The trio of meats all were wonderfully seasoned and grilled to a nice tenderness and served with a homemade sauce similar to a BBQ sauce but with a HUGE punch tangy piquancy. The Lamb Lula (kebab) was my favorite as it was rich and fatty with a mouth-watering earthy spice blend. I didn't touch the accompanying potato gratin but the grilled zucchini, bell peppers, and onions were al-dente with a delicious garlickyness. \n\nRed Tavern is definitely worth a trek to the Outer Richmond to get your Russian carniwhore eats ON.

There was a banquet table full of people speaking what sounded like Russian when we came in (looked like a birthday party), which was a sign of delicious food to come. \n\nService was a bit slow, but friendly enough. Our waiter seemed distracted by the large party, as did the rest of the staff. But the owner came over and apologized for the distraction, so we didn't  mind. Plus, the food more than made up for it.\n\nHere's what we got (all SO GOOD):\n\nBorsch: Loved it. Rivals NY's fancy schmancy Russian Tea Room for my favorite borsch. Quality sour cream as well.\n\nPotato vareniki: Another huge hit. Half-Polish boyfriend was in heaven with the pillow-y Russian-style pierogi.\n\nZucchini pancakes: Also really delicious. The salmon tasted extremely fresh.\n\nGrilled beef tongue: If you don't like this, then you just don't like tongue.

The stuffing was moist and dense, but it didn't overwhelm the cabbage. And the tomato sauce? I'd drink that. \n\nIf this sounds like a lot of food for two people, it was.

My recent evening here, however, showed genuine promise. The staff is determined, the food is great and it's only a matter of time until this becomes a destination restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant was alive with Russian families celebrating with Baltika, Georgian wine and Borjomi. The food was fresh and well-prepared, featuring items like rabbit and sturgeon. The waiters were literally working up a sweat serving a packed house on Friday night.\n\nStandout dishes include the Russian Bliny Tower, featuring fresh salmon roe, sweet crepes and smoked sturgeon. The rabbit stew has an rich cream sauce and falls off the bone. And I'd recommend two orders of the smoked herring--firm, moist and packed with flavor.\n\nThere are a few areas for improvement. With only two waiters, orders and dishes require patience. The kitchen produces quality food, but it's not quick. We waited about 40 minutes between starters and mains. These problems, however, are common with new restaurants and should resolve over time.\n\nAnd yes, they could use a liquor license. I imagine vodka sales would dramatically improve their bottom line and bring in riotous private parties. For now, however, enjoy some quality seafood and discover the bounty of the Outer Richmond.", "author": "Karl H."}

I ordered the mushroom julienne (diced mushrooms, cheese) also, which complimented the  potatoes perfectly.  I also loved the potato vareneiki, which reminded me of my grandmother's!

The restaurant was half empty, which meant we were promptly seated. The ambiance was nice, not too casual or overly stuffy/upscale. For most of us, except for a friend who has Russian family, this was our first time trying Russian food and it was glorious. \n\nThe waitress started us off with complimentary fresh bread and butter.\n\nThe dishes:\n\nBorsch (served with sour cream on the side)- Lightly sweet from the beets. There's also nice chunks of tender beef.\n\nSolyanka (served with sour cream on the side)- A hearty soup for the chilly SF nights. A nice smoked meat flavor and they don't skimp of the meat. \n\nCombination of Pickled Vegetables- consisted of pickles, pickled cabbage and cherry tomatoes. Very refreshing to eat between heavy meat dishes. The veggies were lightly briney.\n\nBaltic Herring- served with thinly sliced, pickled red onions, olives and slices of lemon. On my first bite, I was surprised at the intensity of fish's flavor, which was very briney and salty. I guess I expected this dish to taste like smoked herring. This herrings' \"fishness\" flavor was very concentrated. The intense flavor complemented nicely with the more subtle ones of Pan-Fried Potatoes.\n\nPan-Fried Potatoes Home Style- thinly sliced potatoes panfried with garlic and dill. Some parts were crispy and others were more lightly fried. A variety of friedness for everyone. So delicious, I kept munching on these even after I thought my stomach would burst from all the food. \n\nSiberian Style Pelmeny (with veal) - My favorite dish of the night! Good god, these dumplings tasted like little pillows of heaven. The dough had a little bite to them. The meat filling is so velvety, unctuous, juicy. Put a little sour cream over them. These are so decadent that you don't need to eat much of them to feel satisfied. \n\nCabbage Rolls- My least favorite dish of the night. I'm not sure if I'm into the ground meat rolled in cabbage combo. There weren't any flavors that really stood out to me. But my friends really liked this dish.\n\nOverall, the food was well prepared and delicious. The flavors were simple but memorable. Our dishes came out quickly, within 5- 10 minutes.

We also ordered the French Coffee Glasse for dessert. \n\nWell, the beef tongue came out first, the BF LOVED IT, but I thought it was just ok.\n\nThen came our main courses. The BF enjoyed his schnitzel but was expecting it to be crispier.  I found the rabbit stew to be very creamy but nothing spectacular. It was under-seasoned in my opinion. \n\nThe zucchini pancakes never made it to our table. Sigh. \n\nThe French Coffee Glasse was good but you can't really go wrong with an affogado, can you?\n\nSo the overall experience is somewhere between 2-3 stars but I decided to give it 3 stars because the first waiter/host was very cute.

We found Red Tavern on Yelp and into the GPS the address went.  When we got to the restaurant It turned out it was all booked for the night.  Calling ahead is a good idea sometimes.  So we made a reservation for our last meal of our vacation at Red Tavern the next day.\n\nLet me start with the bad.  There was only one waitress and apparently only one cook working.  So even though the restaurant was relatively empty(14 customers at four tables) they struggled to keep up.  In general the service was slow.  Our waitress was very friendly and apologetic about the slowness.\n\nThat being said when our food did arrive we completely forgot about the slowness.  \n\nTo start we have the smoked fish platter.  In the interest of full disclosure I really like smoked fish and theirs did not disappoint.\n\nWe choose the pork schnitzel and the Beef Cheek Stew for dinner with the Tavern Potatoes(I like Dan Q's spelling), Kasha, Fried Cauliflower, and Garlic Potatoes.\n\nThe Schnitzel was great!  As good as any I got in my two years in Germany.  The Cheek stew tasted like it had been slowly cooked for hours imparting all of its' beefy flavors in the wonderfully caramelized sauce.  We both agreed the Kasha and the Garlic potatoes would have been great except they were so overshadowed by the Cauliflower and more so the Tavern potatoes that by comparison they were almost  pedestrian.  If you go you must try the Tavern potatoes.

Probably the best was the zucchini pancakes, cabbage rolls and lamb... Schnitzel was great but nothing fancy while the mushrooms/cheese mix was smaller than I expected and nothing to rave about.

That fateful day has gone down in history as one of the worst dining experiences either of us has ever had.\n\nWe arrived in the mid-afternoon and the place was about 1/4 or 1/3 full, certainly not busy. We were seated promptly and then BLATANTLY IGNORED. Every other table was attended to except ours. Two other groups arrived after us and their orders were taken and drinks and bread served before we could get the waiter's attention. Each time someone came out of the kitchen, we tried to signal that we were ready to order, but the waiter's eyes were downcast and averted. We resorted to waving our arms and saying loudly \"Excuse me!\" but no luck. After a while, a lady customer on the other side of the restaurant made eye contact with me, and when the waiter returned to her table, she informed him that we were trying to get his attention. Only after this were we on his radar.\n\nAfter some more waiting, our food arrived (we ordered the zucchini pancakes, which were quite delish, and cabbage roll, which was like someone's mom's mediocre meatloaf with a single leaf of cooked cabbage around it), and we ordered a tea service for two to follow our meal. While we ate, a TERMINIX EXTERMINATOR walked in the front door with his equipment and went straight into the kitchen. He left and returned with additional gear, again entering through the front door and walking across the dining room in full view of the customers. This did in fact happen, and we have photos as evidence. Neither my companion nor myself have ever seen an exterminator in a restaurant. Why didn't he go through the back door? Why didn't he come while the restaurant was closed and there were no customers?\n\nMy companion and I decided to cancel the tea service that we had ordered because we wanted to leave after seeing the exterminator. After a few more attempts to summon the waiter, we told him that we no longer wanted the tea. Somehow during that brief and straightforward exchange, there was a miscommunication and he returned with two large white mugs. We were left scratching our heads because 1) he didn't understand our request and 2) other customers who had ordered tea were served lovely delicate china teacups and teapots.\n\nThe terrible service, the exterminator, the fact that we were undeniably treated differently from and poorer than the other customers -- it all amounted to a horrible dining experience.

And what's better on a cold, rainy date night than steamy solyanka! So to Red Tavern we went. \n\nThe food was divine. In addition to the solynaka (just as heavenly as I remembered), we got the summer salad, the potato vareniki, and the rabbit stew. With the breads, it was A LOT of food! And all of it was perfect and delicious and most definitely worth returning for. \n\nSo why only three stars, you ask? I'm glad you asked. The service was sssslllloooowwww. Like slowsky slowosky sloskiski slow. Close to 2 hours slow. It was also really, really cold. Clement Street is cold--there's no way around it. Most restaurants accommodate for this by curtaining off the door area from the rest of the restaurant. I strongly, strongly encourage the new owners to do this. There was no getting away from not only the draft from the door every time it opened (and really, even when it wasn't opened) but also from the chain smokers who smoke right outside of the door (yes, nasty). \n\nI'm delighted that I have a place to go for heaven in a bowl again, and that the rest of the menu is just as great.

It's been probably a month since we had a dinner here but my burning desire to put a review down have not left me still- so here it is. \nI honestly think it was the best Russian food I had in San Francisco so far. Better than Katya's, Cinderella, Fandorin or Red Tavern horrifying precursor Sadko.  \nWhy 3 stars? Because it's very unbalanced. Our waitress started off really well- she was smily, very attentive and enthusiastic- and that along is a great achievement if you know how Russian servers roll. It all began falling apart when we ordered bottle of Georgian wine- she brought it out being all fancy, with a white cloth, -explained grape and vintage etc, opened a bottle... and just put it next to Mr.  I mean, why to bother starting all strong with all the explanation if you are not planning to pour a taste?.. or ok, if no taste, -just pour it in my damn glass! There is wine etiquette for God sake. You either follow the rules or not. I actually wouldn't mind her bringing it out and putting in front of me in a pure silence. \n...i don't know why I am making such a big deal out of this wine situation, it just felt very odd, abrupt and amusing. \nThen restaurant got filled super fast and she never stopped by ever again.  \nHowever- food was great. Borsch was hearty, polenta was creamy and huge, plov was well seasoned and super greasy (the way its supposed to be),  my only disappointment was stuffed cabbage- it was cold. They obviously microwaved it but center did not get heated. Too bad since it had great potential and i still ate it all. (Noone bothered to ask how we were doing anyway.)  \nThe best part of whole experience was people watching. Table next to us had very eclectic group of 3- Asian man straight from his home country, clearly on a business trip, Russian lady and Hispanic lady (both looked pretty raunchy). You could tell they all just met and it was awkward for them to hang out.....\n I feel that this is how most Russian places are- they either ignore you entire time and act like you owe them something or give you super cheesy sugar coated service. No middle ground. You just have to take it and roll with it. \nStill haven't decided do I love this restaurant or its gross.", "author": "Liza B."}

I made the reservation on open table, called the restaurant and told them that I was running late and I wanted to make sure that I could order food and still make the movie.  Never been to a Russian restaurant before (unless you count Moscow Restaurant in Beijing and Haerbin, China), so it was quite an adventure. The lady of the house made sure that I got sat right away, told the waiter that I was running to the movie and had 40 minutes to eat. Asked what was authentic, and quick. She recommended a few things but I am an adventure eater. I went for the rabbit stew and beef tongue. Well.. Rabbit stew, a total hit. Beef Tongue, way better than others. It's late and I'm writing a review and I'm craving, all of sudden, rabbit stew again. I'm a fan. Impeccable service. And judging by the fact that I'm the only Asian and everyone else is Russian in the restaurant, I think for my first venture into Russian cuisine, this is a pretty hard place to beat for first timers. Yes the fried, or roasted cauliflower, is a definite hit. I will for sure come back to try their pile of meat. Couldn't be happier with their service.", "author": "Victoria E."}

According to all the reviews, this restaurant is a good place to try Russian food and it's our first time ever trying Russian food. We gave it a try. It's a nice restaurant. The food was good but the service here is quite not what I'm looking for. \nFirst of all, servers are not speaking english very well, I'm not annoyed by that since I'm a foreigner also and got used to that fact. Negativity for menu knowledge, our server took forever to get our order and drinks. He forgot to put in our appetizer and main course. After waiting for over 30 mins, we decided to ask where is our food, the answer we got is \"I'm sorry, we kind of forgetting about your food\" WTF is that supposed to mean? There are 2 tables in the whole restaurant and they forgot about us? It's quite upsetting. They tried to compliment us with free wine and beer but never came back to take our free drinks order.. Luckily we didn't want any alcohol other wise we will have to wait for an hour for the drinks to come out. \nOther than the horrible service that we had today, Everything else is worth the try. I hope the service will get better for other people.", "author": "Thao P."}

We were a bit hesitant about the atmosphere because there was a large (25+) group of Russians having a private party (there's only one main room in the place) but this turned out to add to our enjoyment of the dinner.  (Thankfully there was no music or dancing!).\n\nWe started with the Zucchini Salmon Tartar appetizer, two large patties with delicious smoked salmon 'salsa' although the zucchini patties were limp not crispy so that was a little disappointing.  The two soups we ordered were large portions and very hot.  I loved the borsch (one of the best I've ever had - rich broth, lovely vegetables, perfect consistency) but my friend thought the matzo ball soup was a little bland.\n\nThe pelmeni were nice (little meatballs that get dribbled with sour cream) and very authentic.  There is a small selection of house wine that come with a nice big pour.  Our waiter was very attentive and the space is warm and inviting.  This is a really nice addition to the Outer Richmond, particularly if you're looking for something other than Asian food.", "author": "Andrea J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-03-25", "description": "So my first experience here was terrible and I was very close to writing them a horrible 1 star review, but for some reason I held back. My family and I made a reservation for 50 people for a wake. We asked the owner if a banquet of $50 a person (with our own alcohol and beverages), she said that we will have plenty of everything and not to worry about order a more expensive menu. So we didn't.\n\nWell...we aren't sure if trusting her was the best idea. The appetizer were spread across the plate and we didn't have 50 people we ended up closer to 40 and there was not enough (they didn't even serve everything that was listed on the pre-fix menu). The hot food didn't come out for 2 hours..yes, 2 hours..and lot of our party had already left. It really sucked considering someone had to go rush them to serve the food already and they abruptly apologized and went to speed up the process. Although scarce, what they did serve was very tasty.\n\nNow..you're probably wondering why 4 stars? Well we accidentally went back here for a smaller birthday celebration, because we were in the neighborhood and it was much cuter than any of the other places in the neighborhood. 3 months later and we were blown away! They got rid of some of the waiters that really had no idea what they were doing and got much better, quicker waiters! Although we are russian and most russian restaurants don't serve good, authentic food...this place is really good! \n\nPros: \nTasty food\nTrendy & Warm decor \nFast service\nA great, comfortable atmosphere for a quick bite or a celebration. \nAffordable\n\nCons:\nQuestionable pre-fix menu (you may or may not be pleased)\nUnreliable based on our past experience.\n\nWill we back?

Since this place changed ownership, it has turned into a gourmand's Heaven.\n\nI've been to the old restaurant a few times, and was not impressed. The new owners have a wizard in the kitchen, and the atmosphere is quiet (except for an occasional jolly group of patrons) and tasteful.\n\nFirst time, we ordered Romanian polenta appetizer (delicious), Beef Stroganoff (not the best of their dishes... but then I'm spoiled by home cooked Stroganoff) and fried cauliflower (excellent).\n\nThe second time we visited, we didn't even get farther than appetizers and soup - there's just too much to sample. \n\nZucchini pancakes with salmon were out of this world - pancakes were mild, light and fried in a way that kept them as oil free as possible, diced salmon of excellent quality, and the spices and sauce made me want to commit crimes for the recipe. \n\nWe also got Romanian polenta (again, it's that good) which is fluffy and firm, with melted butter and feta cheese flakes, and grilled tongue. You have to try the grilled tongue. Slender, melty soft slices are juicy inside, and perfectly crispy in the right places. No description does it justice.\n\nBorsch was heavy on beets and light on cabbage, served with thick and fresh sour cream, and better than my mom made (sorry, mom). Lobster bisque was extremely creamy, and, while there wasn't too many lobster pieces, tasted as it should - of lobster. In fact, this is the lobsterest lobster bisque I yet had in San Francisco.\n\nI always order a pitcher of fruit compote flavored with raspberry juice  - you can have beer or wine anywhere, but this is their own specialty and well worth passing booze for.", "author": "Sandra B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-09-03", "description": "This place is OK. \n\nI've been to Red Tavern twice in the past couple of weeks. Once for lunch with my co-workers and once at a friends birthday party for dinner. \n\nThe Lunch: \nThe menu is limited, but everything on it was available . We were the only ones at the restaurant so our waiter handled our party beautifully. Overall, everyone had a positive gastronomic  experience and it was fun. \n\nThe Dinner: \nWe had 20-25 people, and one waiter. I felt really bad for the guy. He was really trying hard to keep up, but, he was only a man. He gave it his best but ultimately kept failing. One of us was always waiting for something or he would spill, ice the wrong drinks or do a number of other things a failing waiter would.  (We still tipped very generously -- it was not his fault.)\n\nThe food overall:\nThis is the main reason that i am rating at 3 stars.  \nThere are a few staple dishes which every Russian joint on this side of the Atlantic serves it's customers. These dishes make up a hybrid cuisine -- \"emigrant food\". There are Russian, Ukrainian, French and Central Asian dishes which have found its way onto the same spread. \nRed Taver's kitchen puts out average food and if you are not of post-Soviet heritage or don't have a mama or a babushka at home cooking for you its the close to the best emigrant food you are going to get in the city. For those of you who eat Olivier salad which is finely chopped and is not swimming in mayo at home; Red Tavern is going to be a disappointment. Go for the Greek salad.   If you are used to your buckwheat to be fried with onions, again the Red Tavern is probably going to come up short. Go for the deep-fried potatoes with essence of garlic -- pretty good and standard. \nThe meat, a central Asian specialty, has its hits and misses. The lamb is over marinated and overcooked. You cant even taste that its lamb. Some people like that i guess -- I don't. The filet let me know right away that the chef does not know that meat needs to be aged before cooking. Sure; it was properly seasoned and grilled, but, it tasted like nothing.  The chicken a-la Kiev and pan fried game hens were good. The soups taste great, but the chef has to skim the fat. Small droplets pooling separately are OK in hearty soups, but a thin layer which is connected all around is not.  \n\nIn order to compete and survive Red Tavern is forced to take a more aggressive approach in their menu and their staffing. Both need work. \n\nIn my opinion, if they would do Russian dishes extra well and someone brings it out as ordered and on time my review would be a 5-Star. Or things can just be left as is until the next re-brand/remodel.\n\nI cant wait to come back and taste the change.", "author": "Leo S."}

Looked it up on yelp and the reviews were good, but I should have known better because that doesn't mean nothing. Walked in with two friends, and it was freezing cold and windy that day. Thy have one of their menus posted outside but like I said, it was way to chilly outside to willingly stand there, so we walked inside and asked to see a menu and the waitress gave us a snotty look and pointed outside to the one that's taped to the window. Like duh, were not stupid. We told her it was effin cold outside so she went to bring us one. Moving on....we started to order. Heard the zucchini cakes were their specialty so we asked for an order. The waitress said they don't have any yet because the kitchen isn't done making them. I WORK IN A KITCHEN AS A CHEF FOR A LIVING. If the food prep is not done when you open then you pretty much failed that day. Period. Next......we blow it off and ask for the fried calamari. She gives a weird look and says she thinks they don't have any so she goes to the kitchen and checks and sure enough, they don't. Her excuse is \"most people don't order seafood here so we don't carry it.\" WTF???????? So, you basically just insulted us on our choices of food and gave us a crappy excuse at the same time. Why the hell is it on your menu!???? So dumb. Onward.......even after her whole seafood thing we ask if they have the prawns in garlic wine sauce. She gives a terrified look and says she has to check in the kitchen once again. Wow. We should have just walked out but she comes back and says they intact do have the prawns and On top of that, the zucchini cakes are ready. We order one of each. The prawns were cooked to chewy oblivion and the zucchini cakes were ice cold and soggy. FML. Afterward our entrees came and after an annoying mix up on what potatoes go on who's plate (waitresses fault of course), we start to eat. The beef stroganoff I got was soooooooo chewy and dry and my friend got burned puffed pastry on hers. Hahahahaha. It's just funny now. Lets admit that.

We also had blini stuffed with meat which are a signature dish at this restaurant because I have never had anything like that in any other restaurant. Other people at our table had dumplings stuffed with cherries and ordered second portions because they were just that good and the rest of the table had to have a tasting. It was a perfect blend of authentic russian food, which brought back a lot of nostalgia from my childhood and my grandmothers famous Russian dishes. \n\nThe waiters and all the service were really great, we got our food VERY fast, didn't have to wait long (which is a pet peeve for me b/c I don't like waiting at restaurants to get my food)!

I am very glad we made the exception.\n We started out with a small bread basket that was a bit disappointing, given the proximity of a superb Russian bakery. The basket contained some dark caraway-laden rye and two white rolls.\nWe ordered the mushroom julien, harcho, and a salad to share. The red-cabbage salad was a huge portion of yummy, flavor-packed crunch. The waiter knew we were going to share the salad, and placed the plate between us, but did not offer appetizer plates. My DH's soup came out quite a while before my julienne,  and the julienne serving was much smaller than other dishes we saw. It was certainly a sufficient and a delicious portion, just disproportionate. DH loved loved loved his harcho. He also loved his hen \"tapaka\", and the lamb plof I had was deathly good. They also have the most amazing Kvas - not overly sweet or artificially carbonated - but hubby never got his \"kompot\", which he ordered in a fit of nostalgia.\nWe had to pack half our main course to go, so we didn't get to try dessert, but another disappointment to me was seeing the lipton tea bag served to the guests at neighboring table. It really killed the wonderful \"podstakanniki\" presentation.\n\nClearly, lots of little things that could be fixed, but I can't wait for an excuse to go back!", "author": "Lighty L."}
