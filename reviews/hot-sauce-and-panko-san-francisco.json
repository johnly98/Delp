The Chicken on its own was delicious. Good pieces of meet, great fry, and most importantly...good taste. \n\nFried Chicken Sandwich: Taste-Good. Practically-No. It was delicious and had a nice kick with the cole slaw and siracha. Now, it is probably one of the hardest things to eat since it essentially just falls apart. Worth trying...but eat in the company of close friends. \n\nStore: Super small with around 2 small tables to sit and an outdoor bench. So to go might be a good route to go. Now what is great is they have an amazing selection of hot sauces to purchase and something you should definitely do before leaving. \n\nDrinks: Some drink for purchase. As a note, water is bottle purchase only. \n\nGet here: MUNI, Cable Car, or Rideshare. If you dare to drive, it is street parking only", "author": "Chris O."}

It's a chicken wing to-go shop and a retail store selling an impressive number of different hot sauces! There are only two tables to stand and eat at, but no seats. No restrooms either. While it's a no frills kind of space, the food is definitely something to write home about! They make their wings in small batches, and they are made to order.\n\nI had Ultra Goliath Waffle Sandwich, which contained fried chicken, cabbage, and sriracha-sushi sauce. It definitely had a kick to it, but it was really flavorful! The waffle can get a little soggy after a while, so try to eat it while the waffle is still hot and crispy! I also tried the Panko Parmesan Wings. These were one of the wings on the menu that are not eligible to be made into a combo. The wings were doused in sauce and definitely finger licking good!

I like crispy wings, no sauce usually, but these wings had sauce on it and they were still crispy and that's crazy to me! Sauce and not soggy?? And the chicken slid off the bone easy! This is the perfect wing experience. We also had the waffles which were delicious. They also sell hot sauce (some seen on Hot Ones which is v cool). My fave wing flavor was Honey Salt & Pepper. We also had some molasses parm one, pad Thai and buffalo. All amazing. There's not much space to sit and eat but who cares when the wings are that bomb. I love you Hot Sauce and Panko.

EVER!!!\n\nRight on Hyde in Nob Hill, this wing spot is hands down one of cutest eateries on the street. Not very accessible by public transport, and kind of poop for parking...but this spot is definitely worth the trek. \n\nWhen you enter, you immediately notice the open kitchen in front of you. As you approach the counter to order, you'll spot the large wall of 300+ hot sauces for purchase. This is definitely a take out spot, seeing as there is literally one table in the front left window with no seats and it's pretty cramped, having space for maybe two or three people. If you're lucky enough to eat in there, they have really funny and witty decor. But if you plan take this to a park or eat outside, make sure you have some hand wipes handy! It gets messy real quick.\n\nThe menu is definitely Asian inspired. There are so many different options; it can be overwhelming. Pick a couple back ups because sometimes they run out of stuff over the course of the day. I've been here several times and can't think of one thing I didn't LOVE. I highly recommend getting a waffle with your wings as well, and definitely say yes to the whipped butter. I'll definitely return until I've tried EVERYTHING.", "author": "Navila H."}

I ordered Chris's - honey salty pepper and Garlic - Parmesan and bacon. Each order came with 6 wings and they were cooked to perfection. I wish I had ordered more since they were so tasty!\n\nThe last time I came here was when they were still located in the Richmond district. Parking was easier at their old location.

We contemplated making them spicy but decided that, for this first time, we would have them \"original style\" (our term, not theirs).\n\nWe were not disappointed. The wings had a lot of flavor and were crispy without being dry.

The wings itself was very juicy and tender, what a great plus am i right??? I got the bacon bourbon wings and yaki wings. I like the yaki wings a lot, the bacon bourbon wings were really good as well but i do wish the bacon was a little more crispy, but the wings compensate itself for being so tender and juicy!

Sooo naturally, when I found out about Hot Sauce and Panko I bookmarked it right away and was intent on having bite once I was in the city.  \n\nWhat caught my eye initially was the cheese buldak -- the KJU (aka Kim Joon Un - It's Buldak) and then I looked at the rest of their amazing menu that offers truly unique wing flavors I've never tried before like Ramen, Old Bay, Bacon Wrapped Bourbon Molasses, Pad Thai, etc. Wing selections start at $6.89 for 6 pieces (reasonable for SF if you ask me!) and they also offer sandwiches, fish n chips, tempura wedge fries, and waffles for those that want to go the chicken & waffles route. \n\nI went semi safe with my choices:  Teriyaki, Garlic Bacon Parmesan, and Kim Joon Un. I would've ordered more, but it was just me doing the eating.  ALL flavors were really good, but my favorite had to be the Garlic Bacon Parmesan, OMG yum!  The teriyaki was so delicious too.  My tolerance for spicy is weak, so I was only able to get through 2 KJU's before tapping out.  I think it would've tasted even better though if it was hot & fresh with the cheese still melted.  I had my order delivered to my hotel so by the time the KJU got to me, it wasn't melted anymore ;(\n\nIn any case, I love that they offer the delivery option via Postmates & Caviar.  Definitely convenient if you are staying further away and don't want to make the trek like me!  It allowed me get a taste without having to leave my hotel.  \n\nI would've ordered again, but they were closed the last 2 days I was in the city.

Crunchy skin, although a little drier meat than the other two wings given the thinner / lack of breading. 4/5.\n\nAlthough I can't say I loved the ramen wings (very unique idea!), it felt like  there was a puffy layer of air between the wing and the meat, which really added to the mouth feel. You can really taste that jalapeno in their sriracha. 3.75/5.\n\nMy foodie experience wouldn't be complete without at least one type of wing of the store's namesake, so I got the parmesan panko. The parmesan was visible, but I couldn't taste it. Good texture, but probably my least favorite of the three. 3.5/5.\n\n--\nEdit: My coworkers were lovely enough to let me get a taste of the green, sticky, and Korean wings! Maybe it's my stuffy nose, but they weren't as good this time around. The Korean wings were covered in a thick gojuchang sauce, but otherwise were somewhat dry. The sticky wings (a combo of parmesan and garlic) were sticky, yes, but also a bit dry. The green wings were my favorite of the 3. My coworkers still liked the Chris wings the most.

To me it tasted as expected... nothing particularly distinctive here.\n\n2)  Korean (Gochujang) - whoa, not like bulgogi sauce at all... this one's got a medium kick to it and a sweet and pungent flavor.  Winner.\n\n3)  Chris' (Honey Salty Pepper) - wow, this is complex.  You taste the honey and salt first, and then the pepper, and then the pepper heat... there's a real progression of flavors here.  And then you want the next one to figure it out.  I also thought this was the best pairing of the three with the waffle and maple syrup.

We traveled about 10 minutes to a park nearby and quickly devoured the wings. The waffle tasted good but was just soft and spongy by the time we opened our food container. Also - no syrup. Do we need to ask? The fries, however, remained crispy on the outside and were thoroughly delicious dunked in the siracha ranch we ordered on the side for 25 cents. The KJU definitely tasted like kochujang. Both wings were meaty and scrumptious. We are looking forward to coming back to try more wing flavors!", "author": "D Q."}

With over 20 flavours of wings that all seem pretty awesome (and some component of heat!) at a reasonable price, Hot Sauce And Panko doesn't fail to deliver. \n\nAnd deliver it does, and super quickly too: took roughly five minutes to get my order. With a constant flow of people coming in and out, they're probably constantly frying up batches of chicken. The restaurant is super crowded, with only two standing tables, and two benches outside. They'll give you a little beeper to let you know when your order is ready so you make your way outside for the shortest wait for wings you've probably ever gone through. I'd suggest heading to a parkette (or home if you're from the area) and chowing down, as the inside of the store gets super hot on warmer days. \n\nIf you're on the lower side of spice tolerance like me, I'd recommend the Chris's (Honey Salt and Pepper) or Green (Cilantro Jalapeno Ginger) which is what I got on my first visit.

And it's not like you're ordering sides and a ton of other things so totally worth the price in my opinion. \n\nSERVICE/WAIT: Staff was extremely friendly and there was no line when we went. One man ordering ahead of us but that's all. They're quick even with people trickling in constantly. \n\nATMOSPHERE: This place is a hole in the wall.

The waffle wasn't anything special but it's good to have dessert on hand.

My friends and I shared Chris', KJU, Pad Thai, and Garlic Bacon Parmesan wings which were all so unique and flavorful. \n\nOur favorite was the KJU which is a mix of Korean (Gochujang) and Chili Crunch. I highly recommend! Chris' is a honey salty pepper wing which is kind of like San Tung's, but next time I will try Chase's since it is the spicy version. The Garlic Bacon Parmesan was surprisingly good because it had REAL BACON BITS and you can taste all of the distinct flavors. Next time I will try Serg's GBP since that is also the spicy version. The Pad Thai Wings were unique and had a sweet tamarind taste with chopped peanuts that is very iconic. \n\nWith over 30 different wing flavors, waffle chicken sandwiches, and a variety of hot sauces this place is just amazing!

Don't eat it there the place is too small and it gets super busy...go to a local park to enjoy these delicious wings. \n\nOur Favorites:\nGreen (my favorite)\nYaki\nMango\nPad Thai Wings\nGarlic\nPanko\nSalt & Sichuan Pepper Wings\nBacon wrapped Bourbon Molasses\nGhost Petter\nRamen Wings\nFried Chicken Sandwich\nTempura Wedge Fries\n*Wings and Waffle Combo special is a must\n\nBest wings in the city.

(except for Santung, I still really like Santung). Holy crap, I've been wanting to try this place since forever, I kinda regret not going there earlier. I should be going here ALL THE TIME! They have a bunch of flavors, and I mean.. TOO MUCH. YOU NEED TO TRY THEM ALL!\n\nTheir wings are perfectly crispy, perfectly seasoned. Very well done overall. They make the wings to order so you usually have to wait 15-20 minutes. EAT THEM RIGHT AWAY or they'll get soggy and cold. The restaurant was so tiny that you have to take it to go, so I ate it in the car on the way home. LOL. Which was a good choice because by the time I got home, the wings were already cold. \n\nChris's honey salty pepper 5/5\nMy favorite as of now! I love the honey and the pepper together. I'm not a fan of really sweet stuff and I think this has the perfect amount of honey. SO GOOD! MUST GET!\n\nRamen wings 4/5\nCrispy in its own way, I really enjoyed the crushed ramen batter. The first couple of wings that I had, it wasn't very very seasoned. Only after eating a couple did I realized that the seasoning (probably ramen powder) wasn't evenly distributed, so some wings were very flavorful and others weren't. But for the ones that did get coated, it was good!\n\nPad Thai Wings 3/5/5\nTastes like pad thai, they did a pretty good job at nailing the flavors. Except... Why did they have to put those fried uncooked rice pieces in there? It does nothing to add to the flavors, and are extremely uncomfortable to eat. It keeps getting stuck in my teeth and they're super hard! They should remove this from the wings and it'll be great. \n\nI feel like they're constantly changing the menu and adding/removing flavors. Which is great, I can come here and try different things all the time! Shoot, I'm so sad. Because as I'm writing this reviews, I kinda wanna go get some. But they're closed on Monday and Tuesday. Sigh. I'll wait til wednesday. Oh, and you gotta go here before 7pm. They close super early.", "author": "Yen P."}

I was hoping for more seating in the restaurant, but turns out they have even less seating now. A friend and I stopped by after our hike in the morning for some wings - we got an order of Chris's wings (honey, salt, pepper), an order of Korean wings (gochujang, which is like a red chili paste sauce that is savory, sweet, and spicy), and an order of Tempura Wedge Fries with Sriracha Ranch sauce. The sauces were great, wings were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I'm not usually a fan of super-saucey, so the wings were a little heavy for me. The tempura fries were good too, I like the use of tempura batter. Overall the food was great, 12 wings and fries were perfect for the two of us, we were stuffed.", "author": "Elaine N."}

Go their today around 12ish and their was no line!! GREAT! Decided to get 4 different wings. Garlic parm, Chase double hot, Korean and Red rooster. \n\nFor starters I wanna say the Korean was a disappointment. I read all these fantastic reviews about the Korean and that these are the BEST wings here. In my case that wasn't true the Korean wings were mediocre. \n\nThe GARLIC PARM was our ultimate favorite the BEST WINGS out of all four!! If you don't get these then you are really missing out! \n\nMy next favorite was the chase double hot! That pepper flavor was delish but it could use a bit more spice, it was as spicy as I would have liked them but they were goooooood! \n\n\nThe red rooster the best way to explain these are your typical frank red hot wings. So good  but typical. We added extra spicy sauce to these wings to add more flavor. \n\nIts so many wings on the menu that I will be back to try more but every time I go I will always order the garlic parm with no bacon wrap!!!", "author": "Dorothy M."}

Under the flavorful layer of crispiness, the chicken remained moist. My personal favorite is the Green since I'm a cilantro lover. The Chris's had a good balance of salty and sweet without being too saucy. The waffle sandwich was just ok too me, but probably would have been better had I just gone to the location and ate it on the spot!

I've been to the Clement location before it moved and have also ordered via Caviar to my workplace to share with some coworkers.\n\nYES to:\n- Chris' honey salty crispy pepper: most comparable to San Tung wings! I thought these were the crunchiest ones we ordered. Not sure why but the flavor combo was delish!\n- Korean/gochujang: I love gochujang so these were the ones for me! A little hard to pick up and hold because they were slippery though haha.\n- Lime: love the fish sauce!! Super flavorful!\n\nPass on:\n- Green: these were sort of bland for me, the only thing I tasted was cilantro. Could have used a little more seasoning!\n- Ramen: these don't look like the article you probably saw on thrillist SF.

Coming here, I was not expecting much. In fact, when my friend suggested this place I wasn't too excited about it. Don't get me wrong, I love chicken wings. It just didn't seem too appealing to me at the time. But boy, I was blown away! The moment I bit into the chicken wing, I fell in looooove! Since there were 5 of us, we were able to try a few different flavors. We got 2 Belgian waffles, one order (6 wings, no splits) of the Green, Chris's, Hot, Korean, and Yaki. \n\n+ Green\nThis one is my FAVORITE! Clearly, there is a reason why this one is one of their best sellers. They top their crispy wings with cilantro, jalapeno, and ginger. I don't know if it's just me but it somewhat reminds me of the green onion sauce for hainan chicken. YUM!\n\n+ Chris's\nFor those of you who like that sweet and salty combo, this is the one for you. It is a honey salty pepper flavor and it has a great balance between being tangy and savory.\n\n+ Hot\nNeed I say more? HOT! It was pretty spicy at first but you get used to it after a few bites. Now, I can't speak for everyone because personally I love spicy food. One of my friends did say that it was too spicy for her liking but that's up to you to decide.\n\n+ Korean (KFC)\nI  gotta say, this is my least favorite one. This is made with gochujang, which is a Korean fermented chili paste. It has a mixture of savory, spicy and a hint of sweetness to it. It was still good but just not on the top of my list.\n\n+ Yaki\nMy feelings are neutral with this one. The teriyaki sauce was great but it wasn't the best. \n\n+Belgian Waffles\nTheir waffles were so warm and fluffy! You can eat it with the wings or if you have a sweet tooth, they have maple syrup and Marion berry syrup for you to drench it in.\n\nEach order of wings is about $7 but I recommend getting their wings & waffle combo for $10.99. It comes with one order of wings and a waffle, which I think it's a great deal for $4 extra. \n\nThere is one tiny flaw to this place and that is its size. It is a very and I mean VERY small place with only 2 tables (standing only). This place is mainly for take-out orders and definitely not suitable for groups bigger than 4 or 5. \n\nHot sauce and panko, I will be back for you!", "author": "JoJo C."}

It seemed to have been severely watered down by the restaurant!\n\nI could drink ranch out of a fondue fountain I love it so much. But this was utterly disappointing. If you are not going to supply free ranch or other condiments with your wings then you should at least have the wherewithal to supply quality ranch and blue cheese for your $0.50 surcharge; not this watery junk that is no doubt the cheapest ranch available in the contiguous United States of America.\n\nI am generally a positive guy and have never left a bad review or customer complaint.

I don't need to go over to Berkeley for a good fried chicken sandwich anymore!\n\nOf the wings, tried these:\n\nHot - it's as the name says\nLime - fishy and saucy. \nGreen - dry rub green. Not too spicy but just right. \nRamen - my favorite. I have no idea what they do but it was yummy. Deep fried and coated. With a great dipping sauce. \nSalt and Sichuan pepper - not super spicy or out there. Just a good simple crunchy wing. \nBBQ -  it was a little more dark and smoky BBQ. I was hoping it was more the sweet and tangy BBQ \n\nI was surprised how good the wings were for delivery. Nothing was soggy or messy. It was absolutely great. The packaging of the wings is neat - if you order multiple types they might combine in one container so if you are particular with how you want it packed let them know. But they out foil under the lime one cuz it was liquidity so that it wouldn't make everything else soggy. \n\nI have no idea how small the restaurant is but I can tell you the food delivered by Caviar was yummy and quick delivery!", "author": "Traci H."}

Chile lime was a bold mix of sour and spicey that needed no dipping sauce. The ramen wings were an unusual treat, as the wings were breaded in what appeared to be noodles that were broken into a fine powder and seasoned with miso. They weren't too special on their own, but when combined with the sirachi dipping sauce and lime juice provided, they just popped. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the chicken at Hot Sauce and Panko practically fell off the bone, something I've never encountered with chicken and felt so satisfying when I bit down on each wing.

I've never purchased a bottle, but reading the comically amusing names on the bottles helps the time pass by while you wait for your order. \n \nHot Wings in House Buffalo Sauce:\nspicy, buttery buffalo wings, yum.\n\nRed Rooster (Sriracha Lime Cilantro):\ndelicious, but all the spicy wings were making my mouth go numb. After a few wings, I couldn't tell which was which.\n\nThai Sweet Chili:\nMost of the flavors are spicy, but of the spicy ones, this one seems to be one of the milder ones. Or perhaps, my mouth was still numb from the previous flavors, so I couldn't tell.\n\nPanko Parm - panko crusted parmesan with srirancho dip:\nThis is one of the only non-spicy flavors of the menu. Thoroughly coated and fried in panko, and lightly dusted with parmesan, they also come with a sriracha/ranch dip. As tasty as all the options are, this one is my favorite simply because I can chew on the chicken without taking swigs of milk every other bite. \n\nI'd try some of the other flavors if they weren't so spicy. I just can't seem to handle spicy foods as well as I used to.\nEverything is very affordable, around $6-$8 for an order of wings. If you're in the neighborhood, it is definitely a great place to pick up a few orders of wings to go, or get a large catering order, or a box of wings to to enjoy in the comfort of your home, in sweatpants, in front of the tv.", "author": "Joy W."}

Not sure if it was true or not, but the yelp account for the old location said they used to only open two days a week 12-6pm. Who actually has time for that?! Anyways, I've heard people mention this place here and there, so let's see what the fuss is about. \n\nCame here around 5:30pm, and I expected it to be on the front of a busier street. Nothing much around except for a Craftsman & Wolves 2 blocks down. It's a corner shop with literally no seating. There's two small high tables inside, but they're more for customers to chill and wait for their order to be ready for pickup. A really small store means it's more of a to-go type of business, but seriously, where is there to go nearby except for a couple of alright cafes?  Service is quick, and what's unique is that they give you a toy block instead of a number. So cool! They even advertise a lot of bottled sauce on standing racks to the side, assuming they use a majority of those in their recipe. 6 wings for about $6 a set. Must order each flavor as a set of 6, no adjustments.\n\nFOOD\nKorean: (5/5) These wings were tasty! Wasn't spicy really, but they're better than a lot of wings out there. I like the fact that they garnish with a dash of sesame seeds on top. Makes it look a lot more appetizing.\n\nChris: (5/5) MY FAVORITE WINGS. SWEET AND SAVORY. The sauce is light and peppery, and I just couldn't get enough of these! These are on another level away from San Tung's, so it's not really comparable. Get these!\n\nThai: (5/5) These were really good too! I love the sweet and sour chili sauce taste with a heavy scent of basil.

Hot sauces galore if you are looking for some heat to take home.\n\nI ordered the RAMEN wings and KJU with cheese and they were both delicious but I will admit I did enjoy the ramen wings more.

The cheese was caramelized on top and it was just perfect.

We also ordered the Goliath waffle sandwich. \n\nMy favorite was the panko parmesan hands down. It was so good because it also came with a dip that went great together. I also liked the green which had ginger and cilantro. I do wish that it had more flavor to it though. It would've been a lot better if it was a little more salty or something. The Korean was also good. It had a nice sweet and spicy flavor. My least favorite was Chris's and that's surprising to me because the workers told me that it was their most popular flavor. I just didn't think the honey and salt and pepper worked well together. \n\nAnd lastly but sadly to say, both my boyfriend and I thought the sandwich was not good at all. At all! Maybe it has to do with the fact that we brought all the food home, and during that card ride the waffle of the sandwich got really soggy.

(Disclaimer: I don't have the cilantro-tastes-like-soap gene, so my recommendation should be taken with caution for that sub-population) It reminded me of the ginger steamed chicken Chinese dish, except a bajillion times the guilty-pleasure factor due to the fact that it's fried chicken wings.\n\nMANGO HABANERO: Didn't expect mango and habanero and wings to go well together but it was great--very saucy and succulent with a layer of freshly fried crispy goodness. I tend to not be a fan of fried chicken because it's dry and can almost make me feel like I have a sore throat, but all the mango habanero sauce fixes this. (And FYI, this is not spicy despite the habanero in the name)\n\nAlthough most chicken wing places are Korean, I think HS&P may be Chinese-owned because I heard them speaking Canto, and that would explain why the green wings reminded me so much of the Chinese chicken dish.\n\nAmbiance is very mom-and-pop with limited hours and a hint of quaint cutesiness like how they give you a wooden alphabet block for your order number. They mostly take to-go orders because there's only one table inside; however, Yelp tells me you can take the food to nom on next door. Also, they do have plastic forks but it's somewhat hidden by the register. I hate eating with my hands (yes I'm high-maintenance like that), and struggled holding chicken wings with napkins that kept soaking through in sauce before I was able to find the forks.

Any time I can try a new wing place or just wings in general I most certainly take advantage of it.  Now with that out of the way, this place has the best wings I have ever had.  You're probably thinking that's a bold statement but after trying his place several times this place has become my all time favorite place for wings.\n\nThis place is a super hole in the wall place with tons of different sauces to try but being that I love spicy things I went with a 6 piece mango habanero.  It's no where near as spicy as the mango habanero from Buffalo Wild Wings or Wingstop, think more along the lines of Dominos.  It's has a nice kick, but really captures the sweetness from the mango.  I definitely recommend this if you want a less spicy flavorful sauce.  But besides the great sauces, I've tried a few, the wings are so tender that it blows my mind how wings can be so delicious.  I've honestly never had wings even remotely close to the consistency as the ones here.  \n\nAlong with wings they also have friend chicken and waffle sandwich.  Yup, it's just as delicious as it sounds.  For $7 you're getting your monies worth.  Inside of it comes with some coleslaw, Sriracha, a huge piece of fried chicken and some syrup on the side.  The fried chicken is nice battered, but doesn't crumble and make a mess when you bite into it.  \n\nIf you're a fan of wings they you seriously have to try this place.  Already looking forward to my next SF trip so that can come back here for wings.", "author": "Jesus H."}

I stumbled upon this place while walking around SF when I saw an Australian man scarfing down some wings, so I asked him about it and he told me, \"I can't even explain it, just try them.\" So I did. The wings are a great fusion of Asian taste on chicken wings. I had the Mongolian BBQ and was blown out of the water. There's just the right about of sauce, the outside of the wings are crispy and the chicken is perfectly moist. They also do an interesting waffle and wings creation that I saw someone else eating. \n\nThe only downside is that this place is small (only two tables) so it's not the best for inside eating.

It was good but Chris' nailed it even I love waffle so much.\n\nOverall, it was tasty... I might come back again if the wait time is shorter and if I can find a parking near by. Originally we wanted to get the Ramen Fried Chicken because it was sold out last time we visited, however they took it down from the menu.

Geebuz. The store itself is really small and there isnt a place to sit. They have a standing table or two for people to eat in, but not much room to stand in to wait either. They will instead give you a buzzer when your order is ready. \nI got the thai and sticky wings and they were both super crispy and juicy wings with good seasoning/sauce!

I got to try Green, Korean, and Pad Thai and all 3 were so good!! My favorite would definitely be the Korean one, they say its comparable to San Tung Wings, but for me, San Tung still wins haha.

Once you get a taste, you can't stop and they they definitely don't skimp out on the bacon bits in the bacon garlic parm wings and they won't over fill it with parm and garlic either. It's a happy medium of all three favors. \n\nThe wait isn't super long either and their store if filled with all sorts of hot sauce, that was the first thing I noticed.

I've been meaning to try this place for a while and I finally had a opportunity to stop by one afternoon. Decided to try out four flavors:\n\nLime: 5/5. Fish saucey-limey goodness. Being from Thailand, the spicy/sour/tangy/umami taste really hits home for me. This was my absolute FAVORITE by far. I will come back just to have this again. It was pretty much a flavor party on my tongue. If you're into sour-tangy wings I'd highly recommend this.\n\nChris's: 4.5/5. This one was pretty simple. A honey, salt, & pepper mixture that had a great balance of sweet and salty. Also a must-try.\n\nFried garlic: 4/5. For all my garlic lovers, this is the one for you. Fried with a garlic-crisp exterior, these wings come with a special dipping sauce. I was unsure what kind of sauce it was but it tasted chipotle-y (?) Super noms with the sauce though.\n\nGreen: 3/5. This is a crispy fried wing with a blended cilantro/jalape\u00f1o/ginger mixture on top. Its not bad, but my least favorite in terms of flavor. You definitely need a bite of those greens to enhance the taste.\n\nOverall, it's a cute and tiny spot that serves a variety of wings that are far superior to places like Wingstop or BWW. It's definitely worth a try!", "author": "Marny N."}

You can't sit there if you order to-go, but I typically just pick up my wings, and walk (ok SPRINT) home.\n\nMake sure to try the ramen rings. Although the coating of my ramen wings weren't to ramen noodle-like, they were the perfect, dry exterior to counterbalance the juicy moist interior. \n\nMust try!!", "author": "Michelle L."}

There was no line and maybe one group was waiting for their grub when we got there. The place is tiny and there is barely space to walk in and maneuver your way to the register. I can only imagine how cramped it is when there is a line! I felt like I was going to knock over everything while wearing my backpack. Directly behind you, as you pay at the register, there is the wire shelf of hot sauces that so many others mention in their reviews. I didn't give it too much attention, I had no plans of drowning the flavors I ordered. The cashier was pleasant. \n\nAfter paying, I maneuvered my way to one of the two tables available to wait for my order. I noticed a sign on the table that you're not allowed to eat there if you got your food packaged to go. I was starving and thought it would be silly to enforce that with hardly any other patrons in the shop. My food was ready pretty quickly, it felt like five minutes but I wasn't really keeping track of time. At the moment, I was just a starving pregnant woman wanting her wings asap. I decided not to test the wrath of the supposed Wing Nazi and took my grub for a ride. \n\nWe ordered the Korean fried chicken (an order for each of us), the lime wings, and the chili crunch wings. My aunt got a couple of sides of ranch for the road. Before leaving, I checked my bag and noticed no napkins were packed. We maneuvered our way back to the register to pick up some napkins because we were eating wings, duh! Overall, the in-store experience was fine but I can't say it would be the same if there were more than six other customers there. \n\nFor my two orders of wings with no condiments, I paid about $15 & change.\n\nOnto the wings! \n\nWhen I read the description of the lime wings, I was imagining a Pok Pok style chicken wing of super stickiness. These are not that but are still delicious. I love the tangy combination of the lime and fish sauce. It is definitely a saucy wing with less crunch but I think it is so yummy. \n\nThe Korean fried chicken flavor was sooo good! It had the crunchy texture and so much flavor. I got full on my lime wings that I ended up saving my KFC wings for later. I focused on finishing my lime wings because I didn't think they'd be as good as leftovers. Well, the KFC wings still had a crunchy texture a few hours later.  \n\nI sampled the chili crunch wings from my aunt. They had the same great texture as the KFC but they were covered in clumps of red chili flakes. The flakes alone tasted great! \n\nI mentioned my aunt got ranch dressing on the side. You really don't need it but I tried it with my KFC and chili crunch wings and it really makes it taste even bettttttter!!\n\nWould I come back? OH YES! Would I come back during peak hours? Likely never. Dealing with crowds deters me, BIG time. I'll miss you HS&P, until next time I'm in SF.", "author": "Krisell C."}

The Chris's is a bit variable on the spices but nevertheless fried to perfection and covered in sticky sweet and peppery goodness. The parmesan panko is breaded with... parmesan and panko.

You can't go wrong with most of the flavors, they all have a unique and different sauce/taste. For about $6.49 per order of 8 you get either wings/drumsticks. The size varies but are decently sized with a few that are plumper than others. The one thing I like about here is that whichever wings you order they all have a different taste/sauce. As opposed to other wing places that have wings that look like they were dredged in the same sauce and you can't tell if they are different flavors. \n\nI got to try the Chris wings which reminded me of a honey glaze that was nicely battered. It had just the right amount of sauce on them and wasn't too messy.\n\nThe Lime wings were based of a lime fish sauce lime garlic roasted chiles. These were my favorite and I don't usually like fish sauce but I could not detect any fish sauce which was a bonus. These were also the messiest and resulted in a nice finger licking sauce due to the garlic roasted chiles.\n\nLastly, the garlic bacon parmesan wings which were just ok to me. I couldn't really taste the bacon but it still had a great crunch to them. After picking up a few of the pieces I saw the leftover oil drippings which was unpleasant. \n\nOverall, this is a great place if you love chicken wings sauced in different ways!

After doin some Yelp recon before the trip, Hot Sauce and Panko was definitely one of the places we were most looking forward to. Unfortunately of all the restaurants we wanted to check out while in SF, this was the most out of the way. It was a hell of a trek to get out here, basically the middle of a residential neighborhood with nothing else really around it. It was definitely the most expensive Uber ride of the trip, but I thought it was worth it. \n\nThe place itself was pretty tiny. There was maybe one table inside and then a few countertops outside in front of the store. You order and then they give you a toy wooden block as your order ticket. Our wings came out in batches as they were done cooking, so they were always fresh out of the fryer. Each order pretty much came with at least 6 wings. \n\nSince it was already our 3rd lunch of the day (good ol vacation diet), we unfortunately only had enough appetite to try 3 flavors. We ordered Chris's wings, Korean, and Old Bay. Maybe it was just our imagination but I swear for each sauce they had a different cut of chicken wing that best highlighted each flavor. We might've read too much into it but it seemed like each wing was customized to have a different size, texture, and overall flavor profile. \n\nChris's - This was the most similar of the group to just ordinary wings you can get from Bdubs. It had that classic sweet Asian glaze with a sticky, crunchy texture. The wing was very sweet for the most part but you can definitely pick up hints of that peppery taste. From a size standpoint they were pretty standard. Overall, a pretty solid wing.\n\nKorean - This was the closest of the 3 to a traditional Korean wing. They were bigger than Chris's wings and wasn't as saucy. The skin was crispy and it was super meaty, cooked to pefection. The sauce almost tasted like straight up gochujang paste with not too much spin to it. There wasn't too much unique about this one, but it was just a tasy, well-executed wing.\n\nOld Bay - This was our wildcard order. The menu described it as a Sriracha caramel flavor, so I was expecting that sweet/spicy combo going on. First off, these were enormous and by far the meatiest of the 3 orders. I have no clue how they get their wings so big. The texture was so good. It was the closest I've seen to the NYC Bonchon wings with their super crispy, thin/smooth skin that had a layer of air between the meat and the skin. The sweet caramel flavor was infused into the skin itself and then a Sriracha based sauce was poured on top instead of having the wings tossed in it. This was spiciest of the 3 but also the most unique.\n\nOverall, Hot Sauce and Panko lived up to my expectations. I just wish I was hungrier when we came here so I could have tried more of their flavors. Judging from other pics on Yelp, each flavor definitely varies in the skin texture and sauciness so my theories may be correct haha. Definitely check it out if you're craving some legit KFC.", "author": "Mike M."}

Since I was feeling a little experimental, my buddy & I came here to feed our greasy food needs. They sell wings in 2 sizes: small w/ about 7 wings & large @ about 11 wings. \n\nWe ordered 4 smalls of: \n\nKorean wings: our favorite. perfect seasoning, the perfect flavor. subtle sweetness & slight kick at the end\nGreen wings: slight Asian flavor from the ginger & sesame oil. not bad but not the best. \nMango Habanero: expected to have plenty of heat from the habanero, but mostly sweet. again, not bad at all but we missed the kick.\nGhost Pepper: we were warned this would be an inferno, so we had our ice waters ready, but it was more like a small candle. th spices and flavors all worked well together, but no heat, no burning of the tongue & no sweat dripping down our necks (which could be a good thing) \n\nThough some of the flavors lacked what we were expecting, they were overall delicious. The 2 of us polished off 4 orders (roughly 28 wings) and next time I'm in town, I do plan to go back and try the other flavors & waffles. \n\nnotes:\n\n* This place is very small, 2 tables inside & a standing table outside. If a table is available, take it before someone else does. Or ...grab a box & go to the beach.\n* Parking on Clement isn't the best, avoid meal times for better odds\n* They sell a sh*t load of different hot sauces (thus the name)\n* There's a bar next door, if you want beer w/ your wings.", "author": "James L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-08", "description": "Ordered 5 variety of wings to share with a friend. That's a minimum of 35 wings as Hot Sauce and Panko has a guarantee of at least 7 wings. And we actually came close to finishing, but ultimately could not - but both of us are very happy that we have leftovers for later. All the wings here were super tender and flavorful...and just ugh, so good.\n\nWe tried the following varieties:\n\nGreen - Excellent flavor. The ginger is subtle but goes well with the house spice. It's not spicy, but does have quite a bit going for it. Plus, the jalapeno/cilantro topping makes for a great eye-catching garnish. Within minutes of receiving this order, I had 3 people stop to ask what variety it was. (5/5)\n\nRed Rooster - This was probably one of the biggest letdowns. Sure, the Sriracha coating made for good heat, but the single wedge of lime didn't add enough tang to this dish. It's probably best considered a buffalo wing, Asian style. (3/5)\n\nChris's - Very basic, but classic. You can't go wrong with salt, pepper, and honey...you just can't. This proved to be a pretty good wing to eat to reset our palate between some of the bolder wings. (3.5/5)\n\nKorean Fried - The gochujang actually wasn't spicy and it had this sweet undertone. Add in the nuttiness from the sesame seeds and this wing easily proved to be an immediate contender to the Green for best flavor. (5/5)\n\nOld Bay - Old Bay is a mix of 18 spices. The dry rub definitely made this wing the crispiest of them all and was super yummy. The Sriracha caramel added this sweet undertone that also definitely cut the salty factor typically associated with Old Bay spice which was a nice change-up in flavor. (4/5)\n\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Hot Sauce and Panko. I left very full and very sedated on chicken, and I hardly consider that a problem. Also, for a Wednesday, they had a continuous crowd to serve - very impressive.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

With just a few tables available, getting a seat can be hard when they're busy.  However, what might be even harder is choosing which of their dozen or so varieties to try!  Across the board, the wings have come out terrific - perfectly cooked, piping hot, and, most importantly, intact.

Rather, it just felt similar to others I've had at Korean restaurants.  The gochujang didn't have a ton of heat (it's more sweet than spicy), but it creep up on you with each wing you eat.\n\n-- CHRIS'S HONEY SALTY CRISPY PEPPER WINGS...$6.49 sm / $9.49 lg\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=-bzDggcsALHixgrG18a6_g#HOK0f_hAJ-eKHSWabZQHHA)\nThe concept isn't as unique as my favorite two, but it's still really good.

Quite simply, the sauce is amazing - a subtle mix of flavors from the spices, ginger, and sesame oil (the cilantro and jalapeno weren't too potent, but in a good way).\n\n-- RED ROOSTER WINGS - Housemade Dry Rub, Sriracha, Lime, Cilantro, Aioli...$6.49 sm, $9.49 lg\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=-bzDggcsALHixgrG18a6_g#qHm8ojY5RJrwBWSBFE7s6Q)\nThe Green Wings are my favorite, but this is a close second (despite the cilantro!).  The aioli was pretty good, but the wings are great on their own.  The dry rub is really flavorful and the citrus from the lime really perks up the flavors.\n\nBesides the thickness of the waffle (again, just a preference), my only quibble is with the size of the wings, which I don't even hold against them.  How can you when (A) it's more of a supply issue and (B) smaller wings actually taste better.  In fact, I only bring this up because I wish there was that much more for me to devour!\n\nDespite how they may be pricier than chains like Wing Stop, Hot Sauce and Panko is so much better.  The flavors are much more unique in comparison, and the food is so good that it's worth any difference in price.  Plus, you get to support a small business, which is never a bad thing.", "author": "Mike L."}

My friend always stops here on his way back from long rides, so we went along with his tradition and enjoyed our late lunch here!\n\nPanko has a nice deal with the spot next door. You can get beers and sit at Chomp 'N' Swig, order your wings at Panko, and they'll actually deliver your wings over to you. Beer. Wings. Sun. Can't beat that! And at 4pm on a Saturday, they both had a good crowd going, though we got one of the few tables outside easily. \n\n* Korean Fried (house gochujang korean hot pepper paste, sm $6.49, lg $9.49) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=zfl35bGXpnJ3HK045FBRRw#plCQNeJBZ-URekX-LogC4Q\nThe sweetest of the wings we ordered, but not overly so.

This was lightly spicy, the lime flavor specifically wasn't as intense as I'd hoped, and overall it was pretty light in flavor compared to the others, but the crispy skin and lighter flavor was a nice contrast to the others we got. \n\n* Red Rooster (sriracha lime cilantro, sm $6.49, lg $9.49) - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=zfl35bGXpnJ3HK045FBRRw#H_u1BwAoLVlEyx-fb_v4NQ\nThe messiest one, and the spiciest one! It's good that it comes with a yogurt-like dip to neutralize the spice, but this also had the most sauce. Good to have in the mix for the biggest kick in flavor, but it definitely was spicy so be prepared!\n\n* Waffle Sandwich: Ultra Goliath (chicken karaage cabbage kewpie mayo sriracha caramel $6.99) - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=zfl35bGXpnJ3HK045FBRRw#EOhWfBjXumFEoP3VwpR5pw\nGood if you're craving Waffle Fried Chicken.

Oh hell yes. \n\nProbably one of the finest combinations there can be--salty, spicy, savory wings and fluffy waffles topped with sticky, sweet syrup. A meal fit for the gods! And Hot Sauce and Panko do it up right. 11 different wing flavors that do change from time to time and vary from suuuuper spicy (ghost pepper) to less so (the honey, salty, pepper \"Chris'\" variety). My friend and I got the Chris' and the Old Bay (sriracha caramel) and a couple of waffles. The perfect amount of food for two for lunch. The Chris' had no spice but was a nice mix of sweet and salty that went well with the waffle. The Old Bay was fantastic also. I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to heat and these were fine for me (the caramel portion really tempered the spiciness). Want more kick? They do have hot sauces you can smother on. Like the sauces? You can buy them! \n\nNot feeling like wings? You can get plain, blueberry, raisinettes, or chocolate chip and cocoa powder waffles on their own. Also on the menu? A rotating selection of waffle sandwiches. For example? Black forest ham and mac and cheese. Oh emz. Next time, Hot Sauce and Panko. Next time!\n\nThe spot is tiny tiny tiny.

I'd say the KFC and lemongrass were the best and the Goliath was pretty good too.  I would definitely skip over the fries. They looked pale, freezer burned, and weren't even hot when we got them.

To compensate, we ordered a smattering of other wings instead, with myself coming again the weekend after that. All in all, I ended up having tried their:\n\n* Chris's - The one flavor I tried both weekends, though not because it was my favorite, by any means. The seasonings on this one provided a nice contrast of sweet and savory, although the honey becomes a little too sweet if you have too many of these in succession.\n\n* Green Wings - For something with jalapeno, these were surprisingly mild wings, with fairly nuanced flavors. While you shouldn't expect any particular flavors to really stand out, it was pretty good as an overall package.\n\n* KFC - Easily my favorite seasoning of them all, and, while similar to the spicy Korean fried chicken you'd find at an actual Korean joint, still different, with sharper, brighter flavors.\n\n* Red Rooster - Despite the dry rub description, these wings are actually covered in a wet sauce. Like the green wings, these weren't nearly as spicy as one would expect, but, also equally enjoyable.\n\nFlavor differences aside, all their wings were prepared just right, with the bones coming out of the wings very easily, and the meat deliciously juicy and tender.\n\nUnfortunately, HSP itself isn't an ideal venue to be consuming your wings: with a table that fits four inside, and four outside, you'll find seating to be bit lacking. My advice? Call in your order, pick it up, and grab a seat and a few beers next door at Chomp n Swig.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Not exactly accessible, having a single, small, but uneven step at the front entrance. With a little help, one can surely get in, but there's little reason to, given the lack of seating here.

My friends suggested we try this place for lunch and got excited just from perusing the menu. I nearly walked past the location on Hyde Street, but herded into the small joint by my friends. We went on an off hour on a Friday and able to walk up to the register and place our orders. We even snagged one of the two standing tables to enjoy our food. \n\nI opted to try the Korean and Thai Wings, while my friends tried the Smoked, Green, and Teriyaki wings. We went all wings and no waffle, as my friend who had been there prior said he waffle was good, but my time would be better spent on trying different wings. The Korean Wings were topped with a spicy sauce and sesame seeds that had some kick but I could still feel my tongue. The Thai Chili Wings were my favorite, as they had a spicy sweet that was more interesting and intense than the Korean. The Smoked Wings took a little more time to prepare, but looked very good. The Green Wings were very tasty as well, topped with a little bit of cilantro and jalape\u00f1o that gave them a very nice flavor. I didn't try the Teriyaki Wings as I was enamored with my own selections, but I am sure they were just as good as everything else we tasted. As another yelper noted on here, they wings were cooked very consistently, with an even crispness on the outside and juicy on the inside. The individual wing size themselves were fairly generous, so I didn't leave feeling hungry still. And when our hands were covered in sauce from devouring our wings, they have wet wipes and hand sanitizer available to clean yourself up. \n\nThe interior of the place is pretty kitschy, with many Seinfeld references/quotes framed on the wall.

At the cross streets of Hungry and Nauseous, I felt the urge to stop for even the least of tantalizing cuisines.\n\nI took a random guess, and I stumbled into an unassuming wing shop, Hot Sauce and Panko.

The interchange of the softly baked waffle and savory, breaded chicken was met with an Asian-style slaw that dripped down a sweet and spicy nectar.

Panko 2.0 was super crunchy and when dipped in the tonkatsu sauce, perfection in your mouth. OLD BAY? EAT AWAY. My favorite of the day for sure. I mean these wings are drenched in sriracha caramel! How do you go wrong with that??? You can't. I could eat them everyday. \n\nLast but definitely not least, the ultra goliath chicken waffle sandwich (chicken karaage cabbage kewpie mayo sriracha caramel) was everything I have ever wanted in a chicken sandwich. The perfect amount of sweet and salty. I don't usually like mayo but I apparently the mayo in this sandwich was some sort of magic. Try it with a little bit of syrup from the condiments bar if you're feeling extra sweet. \n\nDo yourself a favor and GO TO HOT SAUCE AND PANKO. Now.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

When i walked in all i could smell was sweet n salty fried goodness. Keep in mind there is only 2 small tables insode for seating, and a couple of tables with no chairs outside the front. For some reason i thought this place was Korean, but it's actually owned by ma people (Chinese). None the less, they make some bomb ass chicken! The shop owner is super nice. My cousin and I wasn't sure what to order, because we wanted something non spicy and also another order of something spicy, and he actually really helped us out. We ended up ordering the Satay and the Chipotle with avocado pesto cream sauce. I really liked the satay. sweet, salty, & peanuty. The chipotle was okay. It was way too spicy for my liking, so all i could taste and feel is a fire pit in my mouth. it overbeared the pesto cream sauce they put on top :( \n\nIt's no bonchon or gangnam chicken, because the chicken wasn't as moist, it was a little bit on the drier side, but the flavor is definitely there. and for less than $7 for a box of 6, i really cannot complain.

Found this hidden gem on Yelp and decided to give it a try.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n\n1.5/2 Stars for Taste --\nWe tried the Thai Sweet Chili, Chris's, Green, and the Bacon Garlic Parm. Chris's was hands-down my favorite. The perfect blend of savory and sweet, a nice sticky coat over crispy fried chicken. YAS. LAWD. My mom's favorite was the Green, which had a nice aromatic cilantro/ginger infused sesame oil over it. They definitely didn't scrimp on the bacon for the bacon garlic parm, but the parm was a bit much for me. The Thai sweet chili was a little too sweet for my tastes. We also ordered a waffle on the side, which came with a huge hunk of butter. The waffle was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, yum! You could get some syrup or berry syrup on the side for dipping...or drenching.\n\n0.5/1 Stars for Value --\nYeah, you're going to pay about $1 a wing, which is pretty steep. If you split a couple orders amongst friends, I'd say you would end up paying about $10 per person? Also, because of the drought, it's BYOW -- bring your own water -- which seems kind of ridiculous to me.\n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nAs you can see from many of the signs around the store, the owners have a pretty great sense of humor. Our orders came out quick and the man behind the counter made sure I had enough napkins to tackle our sticky feast. Also, they provide hand wipes and hand sanitizer for post-carnage cleanup!\n\nBonus star because I would definitely come back to try some of the other flavors.

We spent 30 minutes just trying to find parking and we found one about 7 blocks away.  This isn't really their fault, but location is kind of important.\n\nNext, the line was pretty long, we came here on a Sunday afternoon, around 11:30 PM and noticed the line even before we found parking.  They also don't have that much seating inside, only 2 tables and 2 tables outside, but my friends and I got lucky because a party left as we were ordering so we were able to sit down and enjoy our meal.  We also got to gaze upon the thousands of sauces sitting on their shelves which was pretty awesome!\n\nThey have pretty interesting and cool flavors, but I got an order of the green wings and lime wings.  My friends got the korean fried wings and something else.  They cook their wings VERY well, better than most places.  The exterior is crunch and crispy while the inside is still moist and juicy.  However, aside from the exterior, the interior had almost no flavor, despite being well cooked.  Both my orders of chicken had mild flavor outside, but once you got to the inside, it was bland, which was very off putting for me.  The Korean fried wings had some more flavor than my orders, but was still too bland for me on the inside.\n\nAll in all, parking makes me never want to go back and despite being very well cooked in terms of textures, there wasn't enough flavor.

Definitely crave worthy.\n\nThey have 10 different flavors of the wings, (Korean Fried Chicken, Lime, Old Bay, etc.) So many choice that I just let the cashier pick for me. She picked Chris's special which were these salty, sweet, peppery, honey, make you wanna lick your fingers twice wangs. Damm good. $7 for 8 wings, $10 for 12.

Each time I see it on a menu I always order it. I was ehhhh on this version.  \n\nUltra goliath chicken and waffle $7. \n\nYou get this fluffy thick waffle, what tasted like frozen chicken strips, a thick tomato slice, and this Japanese mayo siricaha slaw.

And although I can honestly say I could determine that the wings were prepared with ghost chili pepper (my lips could feel a slight burn) the wings themselves were not nearly as hot as I expected them to be.  \n\nAnd maybe it's just me and my taste buds are out of whack.  Problem is I cook with and eat spicy food all the time whether it is at home or out (my friends always tell me my food is spicy to too spicy).  Several neighborhood restaurants (Thai Spice and Dar Bar) know I mean it when I ask them to make my order spicy.   So it really could be me 8^)  \n\nLastly and more importantly is, in addition to the sparing amount received was the size of the wings -- they were incredibly small, perhaps this is another reason I didn't feel the burn of the ghost chili pepper on my taste buds.

The Outer Richmond location was a tough one to get to but now that it's smack dab on Hyde & Jackson, it's become a regular haunt. \n\nMost of the flavors are wildly inventive and embrace fusion like no one's business. Think ramen-encrusted, sriracha, pesto, gochujang, etc. If you're \"waffling\" (har dee har har), you can't go wrong with Chris's - honey black pepper, Green - jalapaneo & cilantro, and Lime - caramelized fish sauce. They're on the smaller side as wings go but they pack a mighty flavor and are always beautifully crispy and juicy. The waffles and fries are more of a very quiet sidekick than anything else. \n\nTips:\n- Order in via phone so it's ready for you when you get there.

I used to reside in the Presidio and I noticed that there was always a line outside when I drive past. I didn't get a chance to try because I was practicing vegetarianism and I was influenced by my 2 hardcore vegan roommates to steer away from eating meat. Then Thrillist wrote an ungodly delicious article about them http://thrillist.com/eat/san-francisco/the-richmond/ramen-wings-at-hot-sauce-and-panko-thrillist-sf which kick-started my enthusiasm to rebel against vegetarianism. Plus I've moved out from the meat-free household. I was enticed and deprived so I caved in. On /2/6/2014, I began eating meat again. After my first meal, I was craving for some chicken wings so I headed down to Hot Sauce and Panko in a heartbeat.\n\nI chose the Green Wings and Chili Crunch Wings. I was excited to be there. Few minutes after my order has been placed, one of the ladies removed the wings from fridge and placed them on the fryer. After it was done, the male chef generously threw in the sauces, mixed the concoction and finished off with his magic touch.\n\nThe product? Was delicious! The Green Wings were mouthwatering and moist. The cilantro-jalape\u00f1o-ginger were fresh and goes really well together IMO. The Chili Wings were crispy outside and tender inside. They were sizzling hot, saucy and topped with sweet crunchy chili peppers. Everything was perfect as I remember and I loved it! \n\nThe seating situation here is like every typical SF hole in the wall but no worries--it turns quickly and there's an extended outdoor lounge for nature-lovers. Despite its fast-paced environment, the owner and ladies were super nice and friendly. What's more, they take credit cards and gives out free waffle every Thursday! How awesome is that?! Everything here is awesome! I can't believe I've been missing out all these years. Hands down the best chicken wings I've ever had :-)", "author": "Sarah P."}

Don't do it. \n\nSo here's the setup: \n1. Get in line - you'll probably encounter one. Bring a friend who can snag some standing space at the tables outside, or if the odds are in your favor, the tiny two-seater inside. \n2. Pick up a menu floating somewhere around the vicinity and peruse the options. Each regular order comes with (at least) 6 wings, plan accordingly. \n** Treat the Wing Menu like preliminary rankings for the Olympics - the top seeds have delivered consistently throughout the season and chances are, they're going to be winners. I'd stick to the first two sections of the menu for at least 75% of your meal, and the waffles if that's your tune. \n3. Wait and watch the cooks dash around each other in the cramped kitchen. Send your friend to get water and napkins. \n4. Order. We were only half-ready and the lady who took our order didn't rush us at all, but the people behind you definitely will. \"For here\" comes in a plastic fry basket, \"To go\" comes in a paper box.\n5. Pay - Square has your cards covered. After you order, you'll get a wooden block with a letter on it. \n6. Wait some more. Browse the wall of hot sauce. Someone who works here has a sense of humor so you'll see funny homemade posters all around.\n7. Listen VERY CLOSELY for your letter. English is not the native language of most of the staff so half of the letters will sound the same.\n8. Get wings. Devour.\n\nWe got the Korean Fried Wings from the top four list, then went bold and tried the Sizzling Rice Wings and Panko Parm Wings. Frequenters of HSP will know that the Korean Fried Wings were by far our favorite, requiring no dipping sauce to enhance the fiesty gochujang coating. I love anything with crunch, but the Sizzling Rice was actually too hard on the wings and they had no flavor on their own. The citrus ponzu sauce didn't help. Panko Parm was just weird. With the sriracha dip it's a little better, but would not order again. \n\nSuggestions for the Wise Reader: Chris's Wings (Honey Salty Crispy), Sticky Pepper Garlic Wings, and Fried Sambal-n-Cream Wings.

Going through 19th Ave and Geary can be a pain esp during after work traffic hours, so make sure to plan accordingly as they take the last order at 6:15 pm.\n\nI like how they're very transparent on their website when it comes to 2 main things to know: parking is super limited (as it is in the Inner Richmond neighborhood area) and they are a small spot with limited seating inside. I luckily found parking around the corner, otherwise I would've had to double park with my bf waiting in the car.\n\nWe came close to closing time so there wasn't a crowd waiting and we were able to put in our order right away. We ordered a smalls of the Chris' honey salty crispy pepper, Kentucky-yaki (Kentucky bourbon and teriyaki sauce) and red rooster (sriracha lime cilantro). Each of those orders came with at least 7 wings. There is one small family style table inside that can probably comfortably sit 5 peeps tops since you'd need your elbow space to get down on the wings. If you don't mind eating outside, there's standing tables right in front of the store. While we waited for our order, we scoped their wall of the huge, interesting hot sauce collection.\n\nOur order was out within 15 mins and we took it to go. They wing portions were pretty meaty, juicy and flavorful. The Chris' and Kentucky-yaki wings were very saucy and distinct in their own flavor. The red rooster sort of tasted like regular buffalo, but still good. We probably didn't get to eating it til about 20 mins or so after, but I could imagine it tasting even better right when they're freshly out the kitchen.\n\nIf I'm in the area or craving delicious wings, I'd definitely want to come back to try their other flavors like the panko-parmasean, old bay sriracha caramel, Korean fried chicken, mango habanero, and the cilantro jalapeno ginger sesame...they all sound mouth watering good!", "author": "Georgina G."}

A group of us traveled far and wide in search of the dopest wings the Bay Area had to offer, and we were brought to the Mecca that was HS&P (which was located in the Richmond back in the day). Fast forward to today in their new location in pac heights, and nothing has changed: the interior looks the same, with quirky decor, they still have a huge selection of eccentric hot sauces for sale for the connoisseur, and most importantly, the WINGS ARE THE BEST WINGS I HAVE EVER HAD. PERIOD. \n\nThe wings are cooked to sublime perfection, moist and tender on the inside, crispy panko crunch on the outside, and the flavors are genius. In particular, the old bay siracha caramel wings are perhaps the dankest thing known to man - if you only get one wing, I would get this. Other notable delicious flavors include the garlic parmesan bacon, and the bacon wrapped buffalo. Even something as simple as buffalo sauce gets elevated to new heights here, as the buffalo here has an element of creaminess without being heavy that is just insane. \n\nOn my most recent visit a few weeks ago, I also saw the most delicious looking waffle fried chicken sandwich being made, and I will definitely be back on cheat day to try it.

You have the fusion of hot wings and soul food waffles, added with a bunch of Americana decorations including a bunch of Seinfeld memorabilia, and finished off with an entire wall of quirky hot sauces for sale. There isn't much room to eat. I believe there's two standing tables. Perhaps about eight people can eat here at any given time. Most orders are for takeout.\n\nI went with the Korean hot wings and waffle. They asked if I'd like butter with my waffle. I obliged and received a huge spat of butter (that I loved but quickly regretted). My wings and waffle are hot as heck fresh and tasty. Although I've had better wings and waffles, you can't beat the immediate self-indulgence of the fresh wings and waffles.\n\nWhile eating you should definitely observe the mostly silent family operation at work. Each person is diligently working their station all in effort to churn out as much food as efficiently as possible. Business is rockin'.", "author": "Michael H."}

Though the place itself is quite small (two tiny tables and a tall standing table for 2 indoors and 2 small tables outside) it makes up for it in flavor! The first thing you notice when you enter will have to be the hot sauce wall. They probably have every hot sauce in the U.S. on that wall, and I could probably spend hours going through them all. It was pretty fun to read all the random wacky names people came up with for their hot sauces!\n\nAs for the food, my friend and I split two orders - 1 order of the green wings (cilantro, jalapeno, ginger, sesame oil, house spice, etc.) and 1 order of the KFC/goju wings which was more like korean fried chicken topped with sesame seeds. Both orders were equally delicious in their own ways, but I think I favored the green wings a bit more since it packed a spicy punch! The goju/KFC wing was also great though, just on the sweeter end. Two small orders (~8wings/order) was more than enough for us, but they also have larger sizes (~12 wings/order) for $3 more. \n\nAnd I definitely appreciated the wet wipes and hand sanitizer on the side table!", "author": "Kim D."}

It's an odd duck of a store that still looks like the Chinese herb-and-massage parlor business it once housed. As a matter of fact, the first time I passed by here I was wondering why so many hipsters were hanging out at an Asian grocery store. It wasn't until I read about it later that this was a place to eat chicken wings.\n\nWhen a friend of mine suggested meeting here last weekend for a catch-up, I said to myself why not. It's on a quiet, mostly residential stretch of Clement Street, and we met up right when it opened at noon. That gave us some time to study all the host sauce bottles and finally the menu of wings available. Since we were both neophytes, we decided to split two eight-wing baskets for $5.89 each, a pretty good deal if you ask me. The first was their signature KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) which was liberally coated with a red chili paste mixed with ginger and sprinkled with sesame seeds (see photo).\n\nAlthough quite sloppy, it was quite succulent with the chicken skin quite thick and the meat surprisingly tender. I was wiping my fingers a lot since I was trying to alternate them with the Green W(a)ngs which were not coated but seasoned with cilantro, jalapeno, ginger, sesame oil, and their special spice mix (see photo). I definitely had a preference for the green this time since it wasn't quite as overwhelming, but I would kick either one out of bed. There were about a half-dozen sauces on the condiments stand, so we doused a few pools for dipping. I honestly preferred the wings naked as they were flavorful enough for me.\n\nOne funny thing happened when the owner inadvertently thought we were using the sauces off the shelves. He snapped at us and was immediately corrected by the girl waiting on us. He immediately rectified the situation by serving us both cups of free vanilla soft-serve ice cream (see photo). It was refreshing, but it came in the middle of our wings fest, so now we were alternating two different wings and ice cream before it melted. By the way, I don't know where the panko part comes in since I didn't see any panko-fried wings on the menu, but the reference does make for a catchy name.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...better than Wing Wings with a certain freshness to the chicken\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...funky with a sense of humor, crowds quickly with very limited seating\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...despite the false accusation, a nice crew\nTOTAL - 4 stars...living on a wing and a prayer", "author": "Ed U."}

This probably happened to me 4 or 5 times. Is it a sign that I'm never meant to get a taste of those panko wings?! Never! I refused to accept defeat!\n\nSo when I found out I was coming home yet again and that they would be shutting their doors soon, I looked up their schedule. A 1 day window before they close for winter break?! Yes! I just had lunch with friends but I headed straight to panko after. Just 2 1/2 hours before they closed, I stepped in and ordered myself the Korean fried chicken and the chris' flavored wings. Each order comes with 6 wings. You can't do half flavors so I happily went with 2 orders. I took one step out the store and didn't even wait. As I walked back home in the rain, I gobbled down each flavor. Holy crap... it's like crack! The Chris had a sweet home glaze while the Korean had a nice spicy kick. I wouldn't say I have a huge spice tolerance... I have been building it up though. However, it was the perfect amount of spice. And they were so fresh and crispy! I managed to restrain myself from eating them all before getting home. \n\nTomorrow is another day and panko is closed until the new year. I can now say I will never live in regret, knowing that I was able to get a little taste of panko's wings. I hope to be back when they are open again, even if it takes another 2 years... I'll be back.", "author": "Jessica Y."}

Here's what we got: \n\n- Panko parmesan wings: These were great, nice and crunchy with parmesan on top. But the BEST part was the sri-rancho dipping sauce that came with these wings. After the wings were done I wanted to put the sri-rancho dipping sauce on everything, it's just that good. \n- Honey pepper wings: If you want a sweet wing with an afterbite of black pepper, these are for you. They are also fresh and crispy but definitely sweet!\n\nWill definitely come back and get more flavors. Sri-rancho dipping sauce on everything.", "author": "Alison G."}

This place has got character, it's quite entertaining with witty little pictures and statements all on the walls which makes it exciting to enter.  The place is mainly to go with two tables to stand at, and eat again, I repeat stand at. It seems a bit overwhelming at first with all the wing flavors, but we wound up choosing the Sriracha Caramel wings and the Thai flavor. Six wings a portion so about a dollar a piece. Can't say I was blown away, or would be running back for these specific wings it was more Siracha and then crispy caramel. The unique sauces they toss them in which I was eager for, are not necessarily bursting with flavor. Could of captured the same flavor profile as any normal wing house selection.

I felt that their Chris's special was SUPER delicious and I was about to order another one before the boyfriend stopped me. They come in pieces of 6 which is awesome if you have more than 2 people so you can share and try different flavors. We also got the spicy korean wings and those were good as well. The ramen ones were only ok, which is for the minus .5 stars because I had high expectations. The chicken wings were different because they were super fatty and juicy. The health factor is probably a zero due to all the fat on the skin but if it's a once-in-a-while treat, I'd def. come back and indulge!

We downloaded the full menu online and put in a phone order with an ETA of 20 minutes for pick up. \n\nTHE SHOP:\nQuaint spot on Clement at the corner of 17th;\nMixed Residential/Commercial area with parking not too hard to come by (at least not at the time of our visit);\nA dedicated wall lined with shelves offer a plethora of hot sauces from around the globe, sprinkled with cool toys and kitschy signs / stickers (including their infamous display-only urinal by the front door).\n\nTHE SERVICE:\nOur order was practically ready upon arrival.\nLove the welcoming atmosphere of this family-owned business.\nThe Mr. ran the back of the house with precision while the Mrs. ran the front of the house with smooth operation.\n\nTHE WINGS:\nGreat-sized, juicy, cripy wings.\n\nWe tried the following four sauces:\n 1.] KFC (korean fried chicken) - garlic ginger soyu gojujang vinegar sesame oil blue agave coated and triple-fried:\nI was craving the crunchy-sticky KyoChon-inspired KFC from SoCal and this version was not what my tastebuds had in mind. Nonetheless, they were delicious - the kick from the gojujang was awesome.\n\n 2.] GREEN - cilantro jalapeno ginger sesame oil house spice mix:\nThis was my family's least favorite flavor but personally I found the golden outside and juicy bitefuls enjoyable.\n\n 3.] BUFFALO - based loosely on the buffalo wing from Buffalo, NY (choice of: hot/ medium/ mild/ hot sweet) not coated:\nIt was average, if I was driving all the way to the Richmond for chicken, I'd go for the more exotic flavors, as you can get regular buffalo wing practically anywhere. However my plain Jane child aka picky eater loved the Mild Buffalo.\n\n 4.] BULGOGI - korean marinated bbq sweet soyu sauce + coated and triple-fried:\nThis sweet savory mix was my FLAVORITE. The sauce was awesome, as was the crispy texture of the triple fried wings.\n\nVERDICT:\n3 stars for great service and flavors\na 4th star for the deliciously awesome homemade-to-order waffle. \n\nWe can't wait to return & try the other varieties they offer (and of course to get another waffle).", "author": "Geminyna J."}

So fresh, hot and crispy my fingers are burning and my mouths watering.\n\nI came on a Thursday and it was not busy.  THURSDAYS are free waffle day with a purchase of small wings and a check in with the app Spot On.\n\nSmall orders of wings consist of 5-6 pieces and large orders 7-11. The wings are a very good size, not small and shrunken in like wing stop nor humungous like they have been injected with hormones. Wings are cooked just perfectly crispy, juicing at every bite.\n\nThe menu selection of wing flavors are so uniquely named and flavored, from green wings and ramen wings to sticky pepper garlic wings. My friend and I ordered the lime wings, sticky pepper garlic and ghost pepper  wings. We were very dissapointed with the sticky pepper garlic because we expected it to be sweet and spicy, instead they were very salty and not spicy at all with just some garlic powder on top that we saw but couldn't taste. I beleive the stickiness was oyster sauce, that's why it was so salty? The lime wings were bomb, it is made with fish sauce and I love those 2 combos. Finally, ghost pepper wings, Cheeses!!!!! They were spicy, but so flavorful! !!! I can't handle more than 2. Usually any type of spicy wings like habanero or ghost pepper items are just overwhelmingly spicy with no flavor, but these were flavorful.  I like this place because everything's crispy and even though the sauce is wet, it is still somewhat dry but still has enough sauce to it. I personally do not like wet sauce wings. To go with the wings I bought their ginger ale bottled drink, I had pomegranate and my friend had green tea. It was all natural and very delicious with bits of fruit pieces and ginger floating at the bottom. Definitly helped with the ghost pepper wings.  \n\nThe place is small, not good for big groups or families. Definitly not to dine in at least. There are 4 seats inside and 2 tables about side to stand at. Take it to go or stand around and eat it. Prices are reasonable, around 6 bucks you can get a small order of wings! And a couple bucks more for double the order! Will be going back to try more flavors on another weekday for no line!", "author": "Jessica W."}

(This is not a Limerick so remove any expectation of rhyme or rhythm for what's next.) She lives in the East Bay and when I told her where I Iive in SF  she asked if me if I had tried the place that sells chicken wings and hot sauce on Clement Street..  Yes, of course I had been there. \n\nShe is a graduate of Cal Berkeley who majored in Chemistry. She said she tried one of the hot sauces that was so strong (in a good way) that it nearly knocked her off her feet.   I asked her if the sauce might have been derived from the Indian ghost pepper, which packs a punch from its extra high concentration of capsaicin. She said (insert Indian accent here): \"No I surely would have been prepared for that.  This was something else altogether.\"    \n\n\"So what was the name of this sauce?  Did it have a label?\"  I asked her.  \n\n\"It was Da Bomb,\" she replied.     On a recent visit to this wonderful place I found \"Da Bomb\" on the shelf and read the fine print on the label.  It is actually derived from Indian Ghost peppers.

We were getting our drinks at Sharetea's grand opening on Geary and needed to think of a place to get lunch to go nearby.  So, we called Hot Sauce & Panko while leaving Sharetea.  Yes, Hot Sauce & Panko was the place that used to serve ramen wings, no I never wanted to try it, though a ramen burger is another story!  Anyways, he was in the mood for something spicy we chose to share a small order of Red Rooster Wings ($6.49) and the Ultra Golaith ($6.99) .  Our order was done in about 15 minutes.\n\nTheir storefront is small, with only like two tables tucked towards the front for eating at, so definitely a to go place.  If you love your hot sauce, they have so many different kinds for you to check out and buy.  When you buy a small you're told that you would get at least 8 pieces, we got 9.  The Red Rooster was a Sriracha lime cliantro sauce.  I couldn't quite put my finger on what the dipping sauce was though..perhaps some kind of light ranch with a hint of sriracha?  The wings were nicely fried and I liked how they weren't drenched in sauce.  It had some heat, but the really spicy thing was the waffle sandwich that was the Ultra Golaith.  Like it's name indicates, it was a huge construction of thick Belgian waffles sandwiching big chicken katsu pieces with a cabbage mix, kewpie mayo and sriarcha caramel sauce.  I loved the thick Belgian waffle which still had semi crispy edges and the hint of vanilla in the batter.  As I mentioned though this was really spicy.  The middle started to fall apart too due to all the sauce.  Other than that it was a pretty good and unique sandwich.  \n\nHot Sauce & Panko has many creative wings on their menu, such as the proscuitto wrapped one & pad thai ones.  While I still love me some SO wings, I can tell that they crank out wings that will satisfy anyone.  I think we'll back to try out another type when the craving for wings come back.  3.5 stars for now, rounded up.", "author": "Cat C."}

As a father I asked everyone in my family to pick a food and we would yelp a place and go get it while taking in the sites. My oldest said he wanted wings and he was shocked to find out that someone created a bacon wrapped wing. He said we had to go so I called in a 5 piece order just in case and also he is on a diet for football so just a taste for him. Well that was my worst mistake not ordering my own and letting him makes this his only meal for lunch. So as we arrive there is street parking which is limited but we found one quick. We noticed people outside and how small a location is so I would not recommend dining there unless you want to eat standing up. But locations that don't have seating usually mean that they are going to be extremely delicious if it has a crowd outside. \nLocation:  Don't be shy you will see a crowd in front of the counter and a dining area big enough for four people. You will have to make your way to the register that is on the left and then squeeze to your right to pick up your order.\nStaff:  Very friendly and informative and even with a huge crowd they were engaging and courteous. \nTHE WINGS: (Bacon Wrapped wings with a bourbon molasses sauce) 5 piece for $7.49 as of 08/20/2015.\nThese wings were scrumptious and simply perfection in a small to go box. My son's eyes nearly fell out after waiting to eat all morning and his first bite made them roll back and see the back of his skull. Of course mom and I each tried them to make sure they were safe for consumption and they were amazing. The sauce was sweet and tangy with a small bite at the end. The wings were big and juicy and they had a slight crunch from the bacon. I would not wait to take this home I would just sit on the curb and eat them in order to not lose the crunch of the bacon which adds to the texture. \nMy verdict: this is a must try stop and get enough for seconds and don't plan on sharing.", "author": "Gary M."}

Wayyy better than Wingstop!\n\nThey were out of Old Bay and Panko that day, so my group and I sampled the Green, KFC, Chris's, Sriracha Lime, and Thai Ketjap.\n\nGreen: the most \"Asian,\" like salt and pepper wings. Topped with cilantro, jalapeno, and ginger tossed in sesame oil. \n\nKFC:  typical Korean Fried Chicken sauce. \n\nThe last three were sweet and savory flavors, each different in their own way. \nChris's: the crispiest of the 3 with the least sauce.\n\nSriracha Lime: more acidity to it (but not sour or overpowering).\n\nThai Ketjap: the sweetest with the most sauce. Covered in thai sweet chile sauce, topped with Thai Chiles. \n\nBy the time we were finished eating, they were out of the Green, so get here early!\n\nHole in wall joints like these are my favorite.\nWill definitely be back whenever I'm in the area and want a quick meal!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-01", "description": "I haven't been logging into Yelp as much as I've liked in the past year, and one of the consequences in taking extended breaks from Yelp is not knowing what new restaurants are out there and in this case (literally) what is hot so let me start off this review by thanking my Yelp friends Luis C and Mike C for putting Hot Sauce and Panko on my radar.\n\nWhen another Yelp friend Earl G called me out recently about my unmanly appetite I took exception.  I know he was kidding, but I wasn't about to back off of a challenge like that.  I just happen to love chicken wings anyway so giving the chicken wings at Hot Sauce and Panko a try was inevitable for me.  I visited the little restaurant on Clement Street just days prior to the Christmas holiday.  \n\nI had a 50 mile race staring me down for the holiday weekend, and in training for this feat I found that no matter how much food I consumed my training runs just burned off everything I ate.  Perfect!  I called the restaurant in advance to make sure I could put in my order since I had read postings on their website of days when they had to close early because they sold out of wings.  On their online menu they state that one can order up to three sauces on their 1/2 pans of 25 wings so I decided to order two.\n\nTwo 1/2 pans that is!  Not knowing what to expect in terms of flavor I chose two flavors listed as \"best seller\" on their menu, and I put the trust in my fellow Yelpers that this place was legit and created delicious food.  \n\nWhen I stepped inside the restaurant to pick up my order I saw the lady inside creating one massive sandwich for another customer.  \"Oh heck!  Why not?!!\", I thought to myself so I ordered up one of their signature \"rrbblt\" sandwiches in addition to the wings.  My pan of green wings (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NwqdohySKrDnK0RsAde9UA?select=qe9W9hoocHvABwuu78dD4A) was ready to go warming under a heat lamp, but the gentleman of the kitchen was busy at work preparing the sauce for my second pan of bulgogi wings (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NwqdohySKrDnK0RsAde9UA?select=6KTztgFMnncUI_7ndyOhkA).\n\nThe short wait gave me a chance to pay for my food and check out the shop's extensive selection of truly unique hot sauces as well as some of the fun and gimmicky d\u00e9cor that other reviewers had mentioned in their reviews.  Once all of my food was ready to go I took it home to devour.\n\nThe wings were still hot and even sweating a bit from the long ride home.  I grabbed a bottled water from my refrigerator, sat down and enjoyed.  There was a good mix of actual wing pieces and drummettes, and each were cooked up plump and juicy just like I had read on some of the other reviews.  The sauces were definitely tasty, and I love that the flavor of the sauce in most cases permeated into the meat itself.  Nothing peeves me out more than when a marinade flavors the outside of the bird but not the inside.  I'm glad that wasn't the case here.  I thought the bulgogi sauce was very good, but I loved the seasoning on the green wings.\n\nI'll be honest though.  Those 50 wings filled me up pretty good, and I had to wait a couple of hours before I could dig into the massive \"rrbblt\" sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NwqdohySKrDnK0RsAde9UA?select=jcUKkD7MFJltHdB5DVcjyA).  I wrapped it up in foil and heated it to the point where the bread became toasty and the meat and cheese warm.  Amazingly, the spicy slaw remained fairly cool and stayed very crisp.  The sandwich itself was very good.  I loved that the crisp bacon was separated from the roast beef for I thought this helped to differentiate the two flavors.  The spicy slaw while refreshing lacked the spice I was seeking though, and I never did find those fried onion rings that were supposed to be included within the sandwich.\n\nRegardless, I'd give this place a solid 4.5 stars, and yes, I will definitely return to give other chicken wing flavors a try as well as their great looking waffles.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

Yes, I would subject myself to all the laughing and pointing after slipping on my ass or face planting onto the floor....ALL in the name of wings. LOSER.\n\nMy obsession with chicken wings started 3 years ago when I first tried the Bon Bon Korean Fried Chicken Wings in NYC. Since then, I've been hooked on the cluck cluck fried crisp deliciousness lacquered with varying tongue tingling sauces.\n\nHot Sauce & Panko is one of the two non-chain shops in SF that specializes in gourmet chicken wings. Wing Wings in the Haight is the other place but they do not do this highly addictive snack justice. Link to my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/wing-wings-san-francisco#hrid:OPQVyk16POSOiQ58lnaJmg \n\nWhat Hot Sauce & Panko lacks in size, they make up in flavor. The store is tiny with a small counter, a condiments table, a wall of hot sauces for sale and two small tables for sitting.\n\nAfter running a bunch of errands, I came to Hot Sauce & Panko for a late lunch last Friday. I went for the 5-piece KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) Wings, one of their best sellers (Green is the other) and made it a combo with a Belgium Waffle for $5.99.\n\nBoth cooked to order, the KFC wings were some of the best I've had. The meaty, succulently juicy wings were fried to a tantalizing crispness before bathing in the luscious sauce of chili, garlic, sesame oil and agave. Since they're non-battered, the wings aren't as crisp as other wings but they were still crisp around the edges. The sauce was a winner, winner chicken dinner, infusing an addicting savory, garlicky, nutty and fiery kick with a subtle sweetness that  set fireworks off in my mouth. \n\nAs the waffle was cooking, the light aroma of vanilla wafted into the air and intoxicated my senses. The hot waffle was crisp, soft and ever so fluffy. The whipped butter along with the maple syrup created for one HELLAVA waffle. \n\nBy the way, they also have gift certificates available for Wing Lovers. Christmas may be over but I will happily accept these in any denomination all-year-round. :D \n\nCLUCK CLUCK WINGS FOR THE WIN!!!! *SHUFFLES*\n\nOTHER NOTES:\n*WING SAUCE FLAVORS: Naked (no sauce), Buffalo (mild, medium, hot and xxx hot), Pure Capsaicin, Honey Mustard, BBQ, Soy Dijon Blue Cheese, Brown Sugar & Ham Glazed, Proscuitto Wrapped, Green (cilantro, jalapeno and ginger), KFC (chili, garlic, sesame oil and agave), Gringo Bandito, Peruvian Aji Limo Rojo, Habanero, Bulgogi, Thai Peanut, and Miso. \n*Two new flavors will roll out tomorrow: Wings Katsu (panko crusted) and Filipino Adobo\n*SANDWICHES ($5.99): Fried Chicken, Roast Beef BLT, Smoked Salmon and Spicy Chipotle Black Bean\n*BELGIUM WAFFLES ($1.99-$2.49)\n*SIDES: Fries, Onion Rings, Clam Strips, Potato Salad, Macaroni Salad, etc.\n*Catering Available: 1/2 pan (25 wings-$19.99) and whole pan (50 wings-$39.99)\n*Natural drinks like unfiltered Gingerale available (perfect for relieving sore throats)\n*Moderately difficult street parking\n*CC's accepted", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

You'd never know from looking at it that this place has got some serious wing skills. You walk in and there are many shelves full of hot sauces on the left and a small counter in front of you. The menu has some interesting options on there, but the litmus test for wings are the classic buffalo wings. Sadly, they were out of those, which threw me for a loop. They also have something called Beer Wings which have buffalo sauce in them with BBQ but they didn't sound spicy enough. Went with the Red Rooster wings instead and they were awesome!

Small: At least 8 wings)\n-Ultra Goliath Waffle Sandwich (Chicken Karaage, Cabbage, Kewpie Mayo, Sriracha, Caramel, $6.99, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=nnnjP0TZnXJhcKXINjx8qQ#nnnjP0TZnXJhcKXINjx8qQ): Just ok. The waffle to chicken ratio was off, so some bites would have no chicken and some bites too much chicken. I couldn't taste the caramel at all, and thought the Kewpie mayo overpowered a lot of the other flavors. However, the waffle itself was pretty good, so I would consider ordering a sweet version of that but wouldn't get the sandwich again.\n-Goju (The Wing Formerly Known as KFC/NOT Bonchon!, Large, $9.49, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-sauce-and-panko-san-francisco?select=nnnjP0TZnXJhcKXINjx8qQ#_m0NbMeogKN1a89FU_4JBw): Just ok- I didn't like the flavor of this version of goju and felt I've had better versions at other Korean restaurants.

I wanted wings!\n\nFor the people who complain about the owners. I really don't know what you're talking about because they're really nice. If you're wondering why the man in the back doesn't talk to you or look at you, it's because he's focusing his attention on your food as he is cooking it. And the lady at the front is super sweet too! \n\nSmall place, but I saw that they made some changes. They added a bench and a table inside and some chairs/tables outside. Convenient change! \n\nOther changes: they added more things to the menu! Of course I was stoked to try them. We had three orders of Thai BBQ, Spicy Chili, and 10 Spice. My friend ordered a fish sandwich for himself. We bought sodas too. They have an interesting array of canned drinks though not as vast as the collection of novelty hot sauces they have against the wall. \n\nIt took a while to get our wings, but there was a star next to some of the menu items warning me so. Again, small place! They only have two fryers! I wasn't complaining. I ate the complimentary waffle they gave us while we waited. \n\nAbout their waffles: Free waffle Thursdays! So fluffy. I topped mine off with chocolate sauce, caramel sauce, and Marion berry syrup. I tasted the bacon syrup out of curiosity. It tastes like smoke. Waffles are only free when you buy their regular (5 pieces) or 8 x 1.\n\nSandwich was given to us first. Meaty fish, small-ish sandwich. Tasty. \n\nWings came in plates at a time. Thai BBQ came first (with vinegar sauce) and then 10 spice (with chili sauce). Thai BBQ has a nice flavor. Juicy. 10 spice was my favorite because they're crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. And not drowned in  sauce. You add the chili sauce on your own. DELICIOUS. Recommend. \n\nSpicy Chili came next. It's actually really spicy but it hits you slowly and you burn from the inside out. They were nice to me and gave me pickles and a cup of milk to ease my pain. \n\nSo delicious. I like this place a lot.

I wonder if its possible to get that one with my sandwich?  Why no butter on the sandwich? I had to steal butter off my bf's waffle to put on mine. The chicken strips with the sandwich are really good. The first and second time trying it I feel that syrup is better than gravy.

I was lucky and found one a few blocks away, and I totally didn't mind the walk after those delicious wings.  The second downside would be their seating.  There's basically only one table inside that seats maybe 4-5 people max, and then a few tables outside for 2-3 people each.  Amazingly, both these concerns are actually highlighted by the restaurant itself on their website, that's what I call great transparency and attitude!\n\nAs for the food experience itself, it was amazing.  I had the Panko Parm, which are lightly crusted fried chicken wings with crumbled parmesan cheese on top.  I came in when it was a little crowded, but the guy at the counter was extremely polite and apologized for the 10 minute wait for my food(which really seemed like nothing).  In fact, waiting for the food gave me an excuse to dig through their shelves of hot sauce.  They have everything from the most well known hot sauces to miscellaneous novelty ones.  It was really cool being able to look through them, and I'll definitely pick some up on my next visit.\n\nOverall, it was an amazing hole-in-the-wall chicken wing place, and I'll definitely swing by the next time I'm in the area!", "author": "Andrew T."}

This all changed recently when the owner went berzerk on me, verbally abusing me and mocking me in front of his other patrons for trying to get a bag to take my leftovers home.\n\nI spent $28 on food and tipped an additional $3 for wings, which I ate there.  There were a lot of leftovers so I asked for a bag to carry the multiple boxes of leftovers in, and was told I needed to pay $0.10.  As I had no cash, I pulled out my CC but was told that they wouldn't accept it because they would be fined if they didn't charge me.  I tried to tell the owner that one of the exceptions to the ordiance is if the bag is to pack up uneaten food (i.e. doggy-bag) and that he wouldn't have to risk being fined.  \n\nThis is when he started going crazy and screaming at me.  Another patron, wanting to avoid the drama offered me $0.10 to pay for the bag.  At which point the owner said 'charge that asshole $5.00 for the bag'.  \n\nOn my way out, he started yelling at his other customers telling them how stupid I was. \n\nIndependent of  all other factors, this is now how you treat a customer.  Not accepting a CC for the $0.10 makes no sense as they use square and square charges a flat percentage - no transaction fee - so there was no reason for them not to accept my CC.  I physically had no cash and there were no ATMs nearby.  I physically couldn't carry the leftovers home (walking 3 miles) as a stack of boxes.  And if you look up the ordinance, it clearly states that a bag for leftover food is not subject to a $0.10 minimum fee (http://sfenvironment.org/article/prevent-waste/checkout-bag-ordinance).   \n\nTo be treated in such a horrible way is just not right.", "author": "reza n."}

I got my wings pretty quick, and if you like your hot sauces there are shelves full of different types and flavors you can purchase.\n\nNow let me explain to you why I had to pull back from the 5 stars.\n\nFirst, service is absent. I wish I had known this before tipping, because I ended up wiping down the table myself. \n\nSecond, lets be real guys. These wings are straight from Costco. If you are too lazy to go to Costco and buy the back of hot wings and make them yourselves for so much cheaper, this is your place then. \n\nThird, be ready to get to go. This is not a place you want to eat inside (they have tables outside for standing). If you do decide to sit, you are either wedged right next to the door (where a crazy kid and walk in and punch you in the face without you even knowing), or you ware wedged right next to the shelf with hot sauces for sale. If somebody wants to buy a hot sauce, they are reaching over your table. If there is an earthquake, you will die from falling glass hot sauce bottles.\n\nWhich brings me to my last point: how did this place pass the safety inspection? You can literally see the chaotic work station behind the cashier counter. If this place doesn't close before someone getting salmonella, it is going to close because of a failed SFFD inspection.

They have fish sauce for dipping which was a MUST. Ugh it was so good. The only thing that prevented me from giving this 5 stars was that it might be a little TOO crunchy if you don't use the sauce. Kinda on the hard level.\n\n--Ultra Goliath Waffle Sandwich ($6.99): that first bite was orgasmic. This sandwich is so bomb!

Everything tasted so good together. The waffle added a nice hint of sweetness, while the chicken added a awesome CRUNCH! I especially liked the cabbages they used because it was refreshing and it really balanced out all the crazy flavors of the waffle sandwich. \n\nMy coworker had the KFC (korean fried chicken), Bulgogi wings, Lime wings, and the Green wings.

So today we went and I was pleasantly surprised by how much improvement they have made. \n\nToday we came in and looked at the menu. Apparently they added sandwiches more importantly WAFFLE sandwiches. We ordered the Ultra Goliath waffle sandwich which had 2 pieces of boneless chicken kara-age, cabbage, mayo, sriracha and caramel and Chris' honey salty crispy pepper. \n\nThe Ultra Goliath waffle was a great combination of sweet and savory. The chicken kara-age was crispy while the waffle added the perfect amount of sweetness, it wasn't crispy enough to make the right substitution for bread. If it was in the waffle maker for another minute it would have been perfect. \n\nChris' honey salty crispy pepper was a bit different from how the name sounds. You can taste the honey, a little of the salt, definitely crispy and a mellow taste of pepper. It was such a great sauce that covered all of the wings. (I have been to places that add the sauce last and you have to evenly distribute them yourself) \n\nA couple other things to note, they don't have a bathroom for you to use and it is a smaller place with about 2 tables and 4 chairs inside and out so you may need to eat in your car. Also they have a great selection of hot sauce. (I know this should be obvious but I almost went into a salon that was named after a candybar.) I am scared of all things spicy so good luck with that.

But in this case, wings it will be!  If you live in San Francisco you have to know what Hot Sauce and Panko is!  Hot Sauce and Panko is a small, hole in the wall Korean friend chicken spot that serves one of the best tasting fried chicken in the city!

Now that we go often and visit Hot Sauce and Panko, we always get our favorite flavors.  I would recommend anyone trying the Goju Wings, Chris' Honey Salty Crispy Wings, the Sriracha wings, and the Garlic Parmesan and Bacon wings also.  All the flavors I would say are worth trying because they are all so different compared to other Korean restaurants like Toyose, Wing Stop, or basic Buffalo Wild Wings.  (I even feel bad for comparing Hot Sauce and Panko to Wingstop of BWW lol.) \n\nAt Hot Sauce and Panko right when you walk in, you will notice it's a very small shop that is mainly based as a to-go restaurant.  Their purpose is not to have people sit, eat and enjoy, but their main purpose is just to sell amazing wings!  They also have a wall of hot sauces that you can pick from.  it's a really interesting shop, very unique also.  Like who would have thought to make a quick to-go Korean fried chicken spot that had a wide variety of hot sauces that you can't get in the grocery stores!? Such a brilliant idea! =) \n\nAlso, watch out on Superbowl Day, they will not sell wings unless you call ahead about a day to place an order, or choose to buy their 30 wing combo pack with only certain flavors to choose from; just a heads up!", "author": "Rachel V."}

I must have hit a lull in the middle of the day, because it only took me 15 minutes to find a parking space, and there were only three people in front of me in line.\n\nI ordered four different types of wings and took them home for dinner.  I was expecting that they wouldn't be as good after the drive, but in spite of the minor wilting of the crispiness that they originally must have had, I enjoyed all four flavors.  \n\nI think the two things that stood out most were the plump-and-juiciness of the wings (not typical of deep-fried wings), and the fact that even though I ordered everything from honey-sweet to what I assumed was blazing hot, everything was edible, not only to me (a chili head), but to my partner as well (who thinks mayonnaise is too spicy).  Of course, I used some recently-purchased hot sauce on mine to give them a bigger kick, but even without the added Schoville units, they were really good.  I would take them over Original Buffalo Wings, Wing Stop, or Buffalo Wild Wings any day.\n\nThe place is dinky, but some of the best places are.  It appears to be family-run.  The cook had all the focus of a Cordon Bleu chef, and clearly took pride in what he was doing.  The counter person lacked a bubbly personality, but she was nice enough and very efficient, but was probably tired after a long day.\n\nAll in all, it was a good experience, and worth the total of six attempts it took to finally get in the place and try it out.  I was ready to upgrade my review to five stars--that is until I read the owner's response to my first review.  He seemed miffed and defensive, and if there was any doubt that he lacked customer service skills, the last line in his response cleared that up:  \" ...please don't bother updating your review as I will not serve you.\"\n\nReally?  \n\nFirst of all, business owners don't get to tell customers what they may or may not write about them on Yelp.\n\nSecondly, the owner may be riding high right now because his place was featured in the Chronicle, resulting in a sudden surge in business.  Maybe that has gone to his head, and he thinks that the popularity of this place will keep riding that wave indefinitely.  \n\nBut, as they say, \"what goes up, must come down.\"  Eventually he will not be on the point of the hipster spear.  And when that happens, he's going to have to rely on the quality of his product--and the good will of those customers who don't just move on to the next popular fad, but with whom he has built lasting relationships.\n\nAnd telling customers that he will not serve them is not the way to build relationships.", "author": "Nickolas M."}

Nonetheless, I liked browsing through the museum of hot sauces. We got a few good laughs, some of my favorites including \"ass reaper\" and \"colon cleanser.\" I don't think I'd be able to put down a hot sauce lending itself to emptying the bowels of its consumers, but to each his own. \n\nI also loved the fact that there were several hot sauces to try in the condiments section ranging from an exotic ketchup to ghost chili hot sauce. They also have bacon syrup which is a must try if you get a waffle, wings with bacon syrup actually don't sound half bad either. \n\nAnyways, got the green wings and found them salty and a bit too crispy for my taste. Lots of wing meat but very crispy casing. Also the \"green\" is more like a seasoning rather than a sauce so this is a dry wing. The flavors were unique, full of spice and reminiscent of green indian chutney. Small mom and pop shop, two people behind the counter making the wings to order so expect to wait at least 10-15 minutes.

(and open til 8PM)\n\nHot Sauce and Panko is truly a neighborhood gem! It's a very small family operated grocery store that (only) sells an impressive array of various hot sauces from all around the world, and also specializes in cookin' up all things spicy; in this case, bomb-ass chicken wings! \n\nGreen Wings  + KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) - http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=NjO83KcGv4bGX8_FexVCag&userid=5jUlCtMCI9Z7poi1vHq6cQ\n5 wings for $4.99 or 10 for $9.99 (it's the same thing but you get the point). I opted for the Top 2 best sellers; Green Wings (a concoction of green peppers, chilies and spices) and the KFC wings (kimchi flavored with various chili spices as well). The green wings were extra crispy and set off a good heat in my mouth but I would have to say I loved the KFC more. For one, the KFC wings are noticeably huge-er and the savory sweet sauce that coated the succulent plump wings was amazing! \n\nKeep in mind that there are also dozens of available hot sauces to try out at the counter for your pleasure! Sweet, I mean.. Spicy!\n\nOn a side note, the lady that took my order was very silent and never smiled at all.. however, when I received my wings from the gentlemen in the back, who is the master-chef of these delicious winged concoctions and remained hustling to knock out numerous orders in a timely manner, he gave me the biggest sincere smile that simply showed how much he loved what he does. I couldn't help but to smile back. \n\nOh, and yes, I didn't forget to grab my bottle of Sriracha too, and at $5 for the large bottle, what a bargain!", "author": "Albert L."}

There was neither a place to sit and wait nor a place to stand in the restaurant so I just went next door to Chomp N' Swig and ordered fries so I could sit comfortable and wait for my food. The lady who finally gave me my order shoved the two boxes in my hands that were wide open and left. The boxes they serve the chicken in CANNOT be closed. I ordered these wings to go by the way. The boxes are WAY too small to hold a SMALL order of wings. They also didn't give me a bag, napkins, or any utensils (if you need them) so go figure.

Sorry to everyone who are affected by it. What did I do for the business to decide not to have ramen wings anymore? I'm just reviewing in my opinion. Don't put the blame on me where you couldn't supply such a famous demand and just decided to take it off your menu. Now my reply to the blogger from their website. Where is your professionalism in telling me to go to hell? Clearly you DO NOT know how to run a business especially with that attitude expecting people to still come to your place. I'm not telling you how to run a business, I was stating my opinion. Customer experience is a big factor and you just made it worst. Everyone, you still choose to come here?\n________\nThis place is so popular, but I want to know why they only have ONE guy and ONE mixing bowl for all the chicken wing flavors??? Inefficient. \n\nThey became more popular because of their ramen chicken wings so I decided to come here on a Sunday at 1pm. They open at 12pm and when I went to order the ramen wings...they were sold out! In an hour?!! They probably didn't have any even if we came at 12pm because apparently, they said someone phoned in yesterday to pick up for today. Should that be a sign for you to stock up on your ingredients? For a business to run efficiently and profitably, there's definitely some work to do on improving.\n\nSince we already made a trip here, we shall order.\n\nGreen - I liked this flavor the best.\nBulgogi - sweet and tangy flavor\nRed Rooster - sweet and tangy also?\nWaffles - soft and warm. It was pretty good.\n\nThe order took 35 minutes to make but luckily there is Chomp n Swig right next door where we can hang out at.\n\nOverall, it's an OK place.

Go next door for garlic fries (much much better).\n\n\n\nPortions were beyond TINY. PETITE. XS. BORDERLINE UNBELIEVABLY MINUSCULE. At almost $1/wing, at least have regular sized wings. Waffle was standard size. I have never seen a more stingy amount of fries - it barely filled 2/3 of the container that it was given in.... I really think they made one order of fries and split it into two containers. (Hint: go next door for the fries). Thanks for the portion control but if you're going to give me a kids meal, please don't charge me the full price. On the bright-side, the profit margin must be pretty high.\n\n\nWaffle - 30min wait. Wings ~45min wait. Luckily, the bar next door let us sit there, order food and beer and later bring in the wings (FYI, grapefruit beer was really good).\n\n\nBottom line: It felt like the owner was overall a stingy old man. Rent a small place to save on rent (1 stove?), give small portions of wings and fries, make people wait for +45mins. Run out of ramen wings less than 1hour of opening. Did I mention that they stopped taking any walk-in orders 2hrs into the workday?

I came here believing in the hype, with the hopes of anointing this place as the chicken wing mecca that others have proclaimed it to be.\n\nThis place is very unassuming, sitting on a very quiet block on Clement, looking more like a random novelty shop since the walls are covered with plethora of different kinds of hot sauces together with a bunch of Star Wars figurines, and there is minimal seating. That's kind of a good thing, cuz I could imagine how horrific the wait for wings would be if this place was actually trendy. The lady at the register was very nice and she delivered all of the food to our table even thought we sat right next to the counter. The wings are actually fairly small, which means an average guy can polish off at least 2 small orders on his own. You serve your own water (nice) using small jars as glasses (not so nice, went back for 5 refills). To the food items:\n\nThai chicken waffle sandwich: Fried chicken is well prepared, with refreshing raw cucumber and pickled(?) jalapenos that gave the impression of the pickled daikon/carrots found on banh mi sandwiches; in fact, they could use some raw carrots or bean sprouts to give this sandwich more crunch. The waffle itself is a little on the flimsier side as it is thick and airy, it would be much better if you ate the mess on top of the waffle as a knife-and-fork job. They are surprisingly skimpy on the peanut sauce as compared to the picture on the website, but thankfully they provide extra sauce free of charge.\n\nPanko 2.0: Their namesake. This order comes out smoldering hot, beware the juices that are released with the first bite. It's essentially delicious chicken katsu with chicken bones to hold so you don't need a knife and fork. Innovative and excellent.\n\nChris': My friend's favorite. It provides a nice crispy texture, a little peppery kick, and well-balanced flavor. It's essentially a much less saucy and floured version of peppery orange chicken.\n\nGreen: A very \"Asian herby\" mix of flavors, unfortunately the cilantro is a little overpowering. If you like your chicken wings to be \"refreshing\", then I guess this is as close as you'll get without throwing them in the juicer with some beets and kale. An intriguing flavor that I am going to have to be in the mood for to truly crave...I'm just not sure if I will ever be in the mood for this flavor again.\n\nKFC: Bonchon, you most certainly are not. For those who have experienced Korean fried chicken in NYC or elsewhere, this is does not even come close. First, there is no double-fried crispy goodness that is the hallmark of true Korean fried chicken. Second, the flavoring is predominantly sweet and almost reminiscent of ketchup, offering none of the tanginess or heat that serves as the follow-up punch in the typically delicious KFC 1-2 combo. In fact, a closer flavor profile could probably be achieved by mixing the flavor from Chris' with jalapeno pur\u00e9e. Considering this was the first order that came to our table, we went from unbridled excitement to instantly crestfallen.\n\nI would give this place a 3.5 if possible, in part because they serve a variety of ginger beers (I had the ginger jasmine tea, quite good) and because the absolute lack of fiber somehow did not result in GI distress later that night. I'm still looking to try a bunch of their other chicken wing flavors, and I'd much rather get a waffle on the side, but my expectations will be significantly tempered when I return.", "author": "Gene C."}

And apparently I got the 2nd to last slider bun as I hear the cook guy tell the cashier guy \"only one more slider left\"\n\nWe got 2 chicken sliders, Sweet potato fries, and 1 bulgogi beef slider (which, when I asked what it was - the flavor was explained as a \"korean beef\", which didn't really help -- but I was game to try it)\n\nThe \"sliders\" are actually decent size - certainly not  regular slider size - probably double slider size.\n\nThe bulgogi was our favorite, a wet teriyaki flavor with a real sesame oil scent.  The chicken sliders were \"eh\" not very hot and not very crunchy - which is really the whole game of a chicken sandwich.\n\nHERE's WHERE I WENT WRONG - seems like the WINGS are really what to order here.

Great deal considering the quality.\n\nThis place is basically a takeout place, though you could eat here if you really want to since they have a bit of space on the sidewalk.

The KFC wings were subtly sweet and I don't know... a bit tangy? The menu says it has blue agave in it, which I have no idea what that tastes like, but it was good. The coating was thick and crispy. It was quite a new experience for my tastebuds; still, I liked the garlic parmesan wings a bit more than the KFC wings. They were delicious, but rather buttery. It left my lips drenched in a slippery mess. (That's what she said.) They were generous with the parmesan cheese - the wings were covered in it! For a cheese lover like me, that ain't a problem at all.\n\nI would come back again. Parking can be a pain in the ass though. And be prepared to wait at least 15-20 minutes for your order.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-10-07", "description": "\"Hot Sauce and Panko.\" When I first heard this name I thought it was a super hero duo. A crime fighting pair ridding a city of evildoers. And, yes, that's exactly what they are. A city of the evil of a lack of great wings. A paucity of sauced poultry, if you must. And Hot Sauce and Panko are warding off that evil to deliver the best wings in the city. \n\nYes, like everyone else seems to have experienced, I thought I could arrive on a 49er playoff gameday around 5pm to pick up some wings. I should've paid attention to all of their updates on their site & the reviews here as I went home without wings. I really don't think that situation warrants all the negativity here. It's pretty clear they run a tight operation and when they run out, they run out. I think in a lot of cities this is true, whether it's a soup nazi or Una pizza in Soma or Swan oyster, or Capo's pizza in North beach. I mean, haven't you gone to a bar where the beer was so delicious that they've ran out? It's a good problem to have. \n\nSo last week I stopped by at 430 on a Thursday. No line. Plenty of wings. There's nothing worse than overfried dry wing, even if it's sauced well. These might have been the softest wing I've ever had. From what I could tell the fryers were small, and they're paying close attention to fry time. I had an order of the KFC, and I asked what the closest would be to the traditional buffalo, and it was a nice twist of cilantro and lime with a sriacha dry rub. And thanks to their incredible selection of hot sauces, they had a Defcon competition sauce, which I'm not sure how blasphemous it is but I tossed the dry rub wings in that. \n\nThe service was attentive, fun, kind and quick. Being freshly fried & tossed wings makes an enormous difference. Being the small batch spot for wings is a lot different than your traditional giant sports bar wings. Wings are better at home anyway. To me this place is worth the trek west, worth the wait, worth the hustle of calling ahead or planning in advance. In a city that's dubious for being derelict in its wing duty, Hot Sauce and Panko saves the day.", "author": "Jon A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-08", "description": "I missed this place on my previous tour of San Francisco, and as luck would have it, I was back this past weekend and they happened to be open. I had to get a little creative with the parking since the kitchen was about to close, so my suggestion would be to plan ahead if you are one of us idiots that actually drive around SF.\n\nThe place was barely big enough for the 5 people behind the counter to work. There were a couple of (occupied) tables inside and honestly they don't look all that comfortable so I would recommend getting the wings to go if you can. The cashiers were quite friendly and are quite helpful especially with the massive selection of hot sauces on the shelf, most of which contains names that reference doing things to my rear end that I often hear from playing against 10-year old kids on Halo.\n\nWith the wings, if you are the picky type, I suggest calling ahead to see if they have what you want available since they run out of stuff from time to time. I ended up getting the Korean Fried and the Old Bay Sricha, both of which had to sit agonizingly in my passenger seat for 20 minutes before I can navigate my way back to Noe Valley.\n\nThe Korean Fried was good, though I would imagine it would have been far better had I eaten it when it was fresh and hot from the kitchen as with my experiences with other Korean-style fried chicken wings. The sauce is on the thicker side and tended to stay on the surface of the wing, so there is quite a deep and sharp taste to them as when they are hot.\n\nOn the other hand, the Old Bay Sricha wings were great after they have had a little time to cool down, as the sauce got deeper into the wings. Normally I just prefer good old fashioned hot sauce instead of Sricha since I am not a hipster/foodie/terrible person looking for an ethnic hot sauce experience, but in this case it worked beautifully with the Old Bay seasoning and I am still not sure why. It's just a weird combo of flavors that works together.\n\nAll in all, I was just glad my car was still there.", "author": "Ian L."}

We ended up with 3 choices of wings, and one of their ham, mac'n'cheese waffle sandwiches.  Lucky for us, we were able to grab one of the small tables and squeezed ourselves in.  It seemed most folks ordered to take out or were picking up phoned in orders.  Just as we began to make fun of the various patrons including the marina wanna be couple next to us, the almost hipster 20 somethings, local ABC kids, grandmas, a grumpy but oddly friendly lesbian, and even ourselves, our first order was up.  \n\nOur entire order came in quick succession and we got down.

The outside is so unassuming but I should have known better...never judge a book by its cover, so true when it comes to fabulous places to eat in our fair city.\n\nI got three types of wings to start:  goju, kentucky-yaki & old bay.  I love spicy, but the chidlers can't handle it and the kentucky yaki were right up their alley.  The old bay were amazing, as I had heard...spicy, sweet with just the right amount of sauce.  The goju were a take on traditional kfc with a little pepper kick that really made them and a slight crunch, despite the bit of sauce (just the right bit!)\n\nAnd, because I just HAD to, I ordered the ham macaroni and cheese WAFFLE FREAKING SANDWICH!  I mean, come on!  It was awesome...the mac and cheese itself was perfect and the waffle had just the perfect amount of sweetness.  Definitely recommend this one.\n\nNext time I will try their kaarage chicken waffle sandwich and possibly (probably) one of the sweet ones too.\n\nSuper friendly service, didn't take too long (though if you are in a hurry I'd recommend calling in ahead) and if their teeny tiny \"dining room\" is full, I heard you can go next door to chomp n' swig (another review in the writing!) and eat your wings with a beer.\n\nThe only sad thing, they are only open until 6:30.", "author": "tanuki c."}

The last time I tried to stop by in July, during their normal business hours, I got greeted by an unexpected sign saying that they're sorry but they're closed that day, which sucked a bit, since it took about 40min to get here after work;-(  So this time around, I wasn't taking any chances so I called to confirm that they were open and since they were and now that I'd gotten a person on the line, I went ahead and placed my order for pick-up.  I ordered the Red Rooster and Chris' Honey Salty Crispy Pepper Wings.  \n\nWhen I got there, my order was in the midst of being made and after a few minutes wait, they were ready to go.  There were about 5 customers eating/waiting when I got there around 6pm on a Friday.  It is a tiny place, so unless you come at the right time and the 2 tables inside are not being used, you'll definitely have to take your order to go.  I caught a glimpse of their few hundreds of bottles of hot sauces which was awesome, but couldn't really get a better look at them, since I was short on time and there were people right in front of the that area during my brief visit, so next time I'll have to make time to check that all out.\n\nThe employees working there seemed nice and attentive and the lady that gave me my order told me what each order was, which was well appreciated, instead of other places where they don't even bother telling you what they're giving you and they just stuff your order in a bag and give it to you.\n\nBoth of the orders of wings I tried for the first time were great choices as they were delicious:-)  Highly recommended and definitely, right next to San Tung's wings, these are the best wings I've ever had in SF.  The Red Rooster came with a side of sauce and a lime wedge and that definitely made the wings taste even better and the tastes all harmonized and went very well together, in my opinion.  They did a great job with Chris' Honey Salty Crispy Pepper wings too, the combo of ingredients in this one was excellent and I loved how it had a crisp to it on the outside, yet was still juicy and moist in the inside. They have a bunch of different varieties of wings and I'd love to try the Ghost Pepper and Green next time around.  Even though unless you happen to live around this place, it may be inconvenient to get to, I'd come back here whenever I can as their wings are definitely worth the trip!", "author": "Kahanalei M."}

I can honestly say I'm straight up addicted to this place. Nothing even comes close to their selection of wings. Most places, you'll find the same thing: garlic, buffalo, thai, etc. Here, every wing they have is a flavor you have never had before. And it gets better: they switch them up all the time! One time they had a flavor with chopped mangos on it. I can't make this stuff up.\n\n... HOLY BALLSACKS!! I just checked out their menu as I'm typing this.

Mhmm. \n\nI came her and placed an order, since there is no menu online. I had to wait... 20 min? This place was busy with lots of to-go orders and I was amazed with the amount of people that came in specifically for hot sauce. haha I didn't know there was a niche for this. Awesome though. This place is a super tiny hole in the wall, there's nothing really near it so it's not like you can just walk to other stores. \n\nOwners seemed pretty friendly and were chatting with the customers and some regulars. I love seeing that. \n\nI took 2 orders of wings home for me and my hubby to eat at his parent's house. So we ate it pretty much right away. And it was a slight disappointment. The chicken seemed VERY fatty. That kinda turned off me and my husband right away. I'm tempted to give them another try because maybe it was a bad batch of chicken wings or something. Stay tuned.\n\nUPDATED EDIT #2: \nSince you're putting this review on your business's website/blog and have closed the comments there, I wanted to make a revision of what I said. And since you stated on there, \"FOLKS, I'M GETTING SICK AND TIRED OF REVIEWERS WRITING BELATED REVIEWS OF THEIR EXPERIENCE IN 2011 AND PUBLISHING IT IN 2013.\" Just for the record, we came in November 2012, less than SIX months ago. \n\nUPDATED EDIT: \nOwner is critically fighting back, so here is my rebuttal... \n\nSo I forgot to mention that I came here about a year ago(?) something like that and the website did NOT look like that at all. It was a BLOG at the time and did not have the button \"MENU\" before. I remember coming into the restaurant and asking for a paper menu and the kid cashier said they don't have any printed ones but gave me a strip of paper that listed the website. That was all. \n\nSecondly, I did NOT complain about the wait. Did I say the wait sucked?? I just said I had to wait 20 min, nothing bad about it. So why is the owner being this defensive about my comment for the wait. Yelp reviews are more useful if they're more detailed. \n\nOh and the wings were fatty whenever I went. My husband didn't care for it because of the strip of fat under the skin. Brining doesn't give a layer of fat, it just helps moisten the meat. Can you confirm 100% that every piece of chicken that you cook and send out is perfection? No, which is why I said I would give it another chance. And it's not like I gave a 1-star review?! Settle down.\n\nOh and by the way, there's no need to be bratty about it. Telling me how to click on the menu button, really?? If the owner is this condescending, I don't want to go here anymore and am tempted to lower my review to a 1-star but I'm not childish like he is and don't want to stoop to his level.

They also sell pretty much every hot sauce imaginable. \n\nWe went with 2 different kinds of wings. The Korean Friend Chicken wings and the Old Bay with Caramel Sriacha wings. Both were fantastic! The breaded wings were nice and crispy, and the sauce on both was AMAZING. Neither were too spicy, but had just enough spice to add really good flavor. They seem to rotate our flavors weekly, so make sure and check the website. Although, I doubt you could be disappointed with any of the wing choices. Skip the fries though. I would want to try the house-made waffle. \n\nThis place is extremely efficient. They use an ipad ordering system, which is actually really quick and easy.

Normally, I wouldn't eat it, but it really taste too good to pass up.  They have your standard syrup, strawberry syrup, and blueberry syrup (unless you want to put the various hot sauce on it).  Most of the opened hot sauce bottles were empty, boo hoo.  One hot sauce had scotch as an ingredient.  The KFC wings (5) were crispy, mildly sweet, and too mild to be hot.  They were very meaty for wings any way. Now, I have to go back at least 10 more times to try other wings and other sandwiches.  \n\nI don't understand why all the reviews commented on the cashier.

I don't know what they do to the wings to make them perfectly crispy, none like I've ever had anywhere else. I can really explain the texture, but it is perfect. Back to the sauces..most have like a korean/asian twist or flare and all the others just sound amazing enough you'd want one of each. I personal favorite is the Korean sauces, it is basically a Gochujang or spicy BBQ almost, but not overly spicy like some habanero sauce would. You can really taste it. I've had about 5 other sauces and each with its own flavor/spice/pop/deliciousness. Never was I disappoint with anything, each bite takes me into Wing Bliss.

With over 10 types of wings to choose from, you're bound to satisfy your chicken wing craving AND THEN SOME. And if you're in the mood for some novelty hot sauces, there's a whole wall of them for you to browse and buy.\n\nWent here on a Friday night around 6:30pm with friends, and the place was still bumpin' even though it was going to close at 7. The shop closes fairly early everyday (between 5:30-7pm depending on the day), so make sure you plan ahead! \n\nWe ordered four different types of wings, and they all had very distinct flavors, each of them very enjoyable. The wings aren't huge, so no harm in ordering a few flavors! Here's what we got:\n\n* Lime (4 stars): The sauce for these wings was made from fish sauce, lime, and garlic roasted chilies. These wings were super flavorful and had a nice sweet, sour, and spicy tang. These were my favorite wings of the night!\n\n* Green (4 stars): These wings were coated with a cilantro-ginger sauce. I hate ginger, but the combination of cilantro, ginger, and jalapeno really balanced each other out to create a unique savory flavor. My second favorite wings!\n\n* Panko (3 stars): Though this flavor is mentioned in the name of the restaurant, I thought this was the least unique. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad. But it basically tasted like your average chicken/pork katsu but in chicken wing/drum stick form with bones! If you're craving something that's panko crusted, just get some regular boneless katsu chicken or pork instead so you don't have to deal with them bones.\n\n* Ghost Pepper (3 stars): Whoooo-weee.. talk about SPICY. I usually brag that I can eat really spicy food (I really can!), but damn, this shizzz was spicy. At first bite, it tastes like you're eating a dry, cajun-spiced chicken wing. But as you take more and more bites, the peppery spices start kicking in and burning your tongue and mouth. Unless you don't mind sweating and being in a slight bit of pain while you're eating this, I'd stay away. I took 3 bites, and I was done. Not bad tasting, just spicy.\n\nWe also got an order of fries, which was pretty standard. Good for dipping in the leftover sauces.\n\nDefinitely worth a try if you're around the area!

The restaurants decor comprises of a wall of different hot sauces which can be purchased. The seating area is also the waiting area; it is small and can be easily crowded.

My friend got the \"KFC: Korean Fried Chicken\". I am not a big of gochujang sauce, but it was okay in my opinion. If you like the sauce, I'm sure it would be tasty too. The wings were saucy, and topped with sesame seeds. My friend got 8 wings, although her pieces were bigger than mine. \n\nThe small order of wings cost $6.49 with tax it totaled to $7.06.

My favorite being in the order of... 1. Chris's 2. Lime followed by Green. \nBoyfriends favorites in order... 1. Green 2. Lime and then Chris's... which says this place is pretty consistently good. I'd be down to try all of them (minus ghost pepper due to weak stomach) eventually but would probably insist on ordering Chris's every time. \n\nI love the honey chicken at 99 and was anxious to see how this would compare...and surprisingly I enjoyed the flavor of these wings more than over at 99! They were almost perfect..a little crispy but juicy due to the honey but not overpowered with sweetness (which can happen at 99) because of the other spices. Only thing is at 99 the drumsticks are bigger and are GENROUSLY dipped in batter giving it a more perfectly crunchy texture that I love... however the flavor on hot sauce's rendition was superior in my opinion.\n\nDespite my initial intention to... I did not order any waffles, will have to next time because they have a perfect little waffle condiment station to the right that included both maple and chocolate syrup (and I think I saw whipped cream as well?) :3\n\nThe only 'drawback' for us was that we personally prefer big drumsticks over the little wings..which really isn't a drawback haha. And although flavors were on point we still preferred the texture over at 99... but still CALLING ALL CHICKEN LOVERS you need to try this joint out if you haven't ;D", "author": "Melissa C."}

Better than San Tung, or any other place you can think of (though do check out scisso, it gets close).  These are korean style wings mainly, but they have about a dozen different varieties, so you can pick your fancy. The hot chili crunch is my favorite, the traditional KFC is really good, too.  I'm still working  my way through their menu and enjoying the process.  \n\nI think it's run by a father and daughter team who are super cute.  Their small scale and large pickup business for gamedays and such can lead to some periodic slow downs in getting your order, so if it is gameday, and you are headed out to the Richmond solely for the wings (they are worth the trip), you may want to call ahead to make sure they aren't too busy filling party orders.  \n\nLike people mentioned, there are only two tables there, so you can always head to Mountain Lake park a few blocks away to the north (the southernmost edge of the presidio) to eat your wings at the benches by the pond/lake there.  Apparently, this is where Spanish explorers spent their first night in the city, before ditching the fog and finding warmer climes in the Mission.  \n\nOr you can eat in the car like an animal, whichever.", "author": "Jim M."}

For a Saturday afternoon, we were able to find parking shortly. Hot Sauce and Panko is a hole-in-the-wall with meager seating. One high chair table, a four seater near the window, and a four seater for outdoor seating. Its more of a order to-go type of restaurant.  \n \nThe store itself have shelves lined with different types of sauce with funny cartoon animations and names like \"Ass on Fire\" and such. Reminds me of the sauces they sell at Alien Jerky in Baker, CA on the way to Las Vegas. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the theme of the store and was excited to devour some wings.  \n \nWe ordered: \n \nKFC (Korean Fried Chicken): The wings were covered in a red sauce like buffalo wings, but tasted like sweet and sour sauce.  \n  \nLime: This is actually my favorite of the three that we tried. Taste like the sweet fish sauce mix that you receive at Vietnamese restaurants to dip your spring rolls/egg rolls, or to sprinkle over such dishes like bun thit nuong (vermicelli) dishes. That sweet fish sauce is made with lime and chili, and sugar. Bold flavors for wings.  \n\nKatsu with tonkatsu sauce: They literally breaded the little wings which I thought was mind boggling and ingenious. Surprisingly, the wings were still crispy and perfect.  \n \nOverall, the wings were not heavy after devouring x amount. Although, it would be nice if the wings were a bit bigger. They were baby wings. \n  \nIn comparison to some chains like wing stop and buffalo wild wings, I like the idea of Hot Sauce and Panko spinning different new flavors and concoctions for wings that are out of the norm that may be more of the adventurous side - its different.", "author": "Becky Q."}

The guy behind the counter who make these delicious chicken wings are absolutely UH-MAY-ZING! I don't know how he does it, but whatever kind of science, magic, or whatnot...one word: phenomenal!!\n\nMy SO was telling me this who-ha deal about this cool chicken wings place in SF and read it somewhere on Yelp that we HAD to go check it out for ourselves. Thanks to him, this is by far, my favorite spot to cure my fried chicken cravings!\n\nSmall spot and minimal places to sit down, we looked over their one page menu figuring out what to order. I suggested we start off the first two, so our next visits we can work our way down the listed items. So far, we've tried the following:\n\ngreen (cilantro, jalapeno, ginger, sesame oil and house spice mix): I love the hint of jalapeno and cilantro mixed into their house spice mix. Mild in flavor so it's not spicy as you may think because of the jalapeno. This is my favorite!!\n\nkfc (Korean fried chicken: garlic, ginger, soy sauce, gojujang, vinegar, sesame oil, blue agave, coated, triple fried): I love the garlic and sweetness flavor of the chicken with the right crispiness after my first bite! Not bad for all the fixin' flavors mixed together.\n\nbulgogi (Korean marinated BBQ sweet soyu sauce, coated, triple fried) I'm not quite a fan of this one in particular. It didn't come out as I pictured it in my head. I may have to try it again to give it another go. Seemed a bit similar to KFC but completely drenched with the sauce so I couldn't get the crisp texture when eating the chicken all the way through.\n\nten-spice (used 10 spice instead of 5, garlic, ginger, coated, triple fried resulting in a \"pomme souffle effect\") Another favorite of mine! I sure love my chicken wings spicy! This wasn't fiery and flaming-hot-in-my-mouth kind of chicken so I'm still working my way down the REAL hot sauce chicken wings. However, I enjoyed the little hint of spiciness and garlic resulting in a \"fro souffle effect.\" \n\nskinny fries: nothing but average fries. You can't really call it anything special.\n\nBelgian waffle (whipped cream): we had the choice of whipped cream or butter. Of course, we went with the sweet tooth craving opting for whipped cream. I tried a small bite of the waffle without drizzling nutella hazelnut chocolate, boy-oh-boy....soft, chewy, and deliciously sweet and tasty with a little bit of crunch from the outer part of the waffle! Goes great hand-in-hand with the chicken wings! FYI: Free waffle on Thursdays!!\n\nAll mentioned above, this is only the beginning. I'm still working on the rest of the menu. I'm coming back for more! The owner and cook is super sweet and funny! I love their SpotOn app they use too. Check-in and earn a small pan-size of chicken wings after a couple of trips here! You can't help but look at the galore of hot sauces shelved around you! I spotted numerous amount of hot sauces including sweet and garlicky sauces. The wait time may be 10-20 minutes but that doesn't stop me from coming back. Well priced for the amount of chicken wings you get. They're not your typical small wings you get at BWW or Hooters. This is WAY better than those chain spots!\n\nI'm a fan!!", "author": "Fraulein C."}

This was very similar to a sauce Janette's cousin makes in the sense that there's cilantro and lime with a good amount of heat that's more for flavor (its not hot at all, but the slight burn really opens up your taste buds). Perfectly fried, all the pieces were very juicy\n\n10 Spice: surprisingly the more spices you add, the milder it tastes... not quite as overwhelming as 5 spice can be (its as if the star anise gets subdued by the other spices). this actually worked great. Again, perfectly fried and just salty enough to get the juices flowing... very good.\n\nWaffle - very good... i typically don't like big squared waffles, but this was perfect for a few reasons... 1) it was not sweet at all, so all of the sweetness comes from the syrup if you add. 2) since it isnt sweet, you can add the wing meat and make a sandwich with it, which is really good, and since it isn't salty at all, you aren't really impacting the flavor of the chicken, and are instead creating an envelope of awesome. 3) with the butter and syrup, this is super good...  and I would rate this waffle at the same level as Little Skillet's\n\nA little pricey for wings but given the amount of flavors and specialization, and real estate for storage, it evens out... not to mention they're so good, that I'm glad this place is out of the way... because I'd probably be fat and broke.", "author": "Marc T."}

For me it's perfect since I like my savory food a bit sweet.  The Bulgogi sauce added tons of flavor to the wings without making them soggy.  The coating kept the wings crispy outside and tender and moist inside.\nGreen wings: I've had it twice. Somewhat unique flavor. I like it but wouldn't crave for it.\n\nService - 3 star (according to Yelp's rating definition)\nNot long after the shop opened, I had a not-so-pleasant experience.  I went in one day within an hour before they closed and was told they had run out of wings.  While I could blame myself for not having checked in advance, the response I got was less than desired - just that \"we have no wing left\"; not a single word of sorry or offering a tip how to make sure I get my wings next time.\n\nMy recent experience with the staff was definitely better but nothing special.  For a small neighborhood shop, I would expect the staff to be a bit more friendly.  They were indeed nice to some regulars as far as I've seen but I haven't experienced that myself.\n\nTips: a) if you go near the closing time, do check first just so you don't leave empty handed; b) wings are made fresh, meaning the wait can be long.", "author": "Elaine H."}

One saucy variety, one sauce-less variety. Phew--all 14 wings, gone!\n\nThe house sauce on the KFC wings was tangy, spicy, Korean-y and perfect with rice. Size-wise, the chicken wings were \"normal\" compared to the \"monstrously mutant\" wings you'd find elsewhere (7 of Wing Lee/San Tung's wings =  10-11 wings from here). I didn't seem to mind this so much, since I've always wondered how full of hormones those unnaturally giant but oh-so-tasty wings could be filled with. Crisp-factor was perfect. Not over-fried, not under-fried. Juicy in the center.\n\nCHSCP wings were good, but they didn't knock my socks off. The sweetness from the honey was a little too faint. Seasoned well..yes, but they may have been even better with a bit of roasted chili powder or some other dry-spicy-kick-in-your-pants (jalapeno peppers?).\n\nOverall, I can never say no to good chicken wings, and this place definitely has some good ones!

Normally, most chicken and waffle places skimp on this aspect, making the waffle really soggy and bland but THIS waffle. man. It's crispy, warm, fresh and although I have yet to try the whipped cream, the butter makes it so nice on top of that syrup.\n'DAT. WAFFLE. mmmmm. \n\nBUFFALO wing After trying different types of wings, getting the buffalo chicken is pretty much my staple whenever I need to get a H.S.A.P fix. It's not your typical crispy buffalo wing but there's something in that sauce that gives it a nice kick and a pickled taste, which if it weren't for the hot-ness, I would instantly devour them quickly like the cookie monster eating cookies. Really. \n\nKFC wings: A mildly spicy wing with some sweetness because of the agave. It definitely reminds me of the sauce used in many korean dishes and it's finger licking good.\n\nBULGOGI Wings: Very crispy wing with a side of the bulgogi sauce that you can use to dip or completely drench the wing in. The one thing I really like about this wing is that it's very well made. Often times, chicken wings are either too crispy to the point that the meat is really dry or that the fryer was not hot enough so the skin is just mushy, oily and just. gross. (This is why I'm so picky with eating chicken skin.) This place has the PERFECT balance. \n\nHABANERO wings: unfortunately, it seems like this wing has been discontinued but asides from the buffalo, it was actually my favorite because it had a really good balance of tangyness and spice. Perhaps one day they'll have it back up. * hint hint* :)\n\nGREEN wings:  A dry spice rubbed wing with cilantro, ginger and jalapeno. It's really good and the jalapeno gives the wings a mild flavor, which is good for those who don't really like wings that are too spicy. \n\n\nAhhh the best part about this place is that it's right in my neighborhood.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

We had a party of 4 that was joining us for dinner that night so 25 wings was what we needed. We go in we see one other person in there, good this will be a fast order, NOT!! So we see a sign NO walk in 1/2 pan orders (25 wings) WTF!!! Umm it was our first time there, HOW WOULD WE KNOW?? So I asked the lady well should I walk outside and call in to place the order? She was SO RUDE and said well then you will be waiting an hour and a half before we give you your order. WTF!! SHE IS RUDE AND A LIAR!!! I have NEVER been to a place where they did not want to sell us food! So my friend and I try to figure out how to feed 4 people enough without being denied! Here we go...\nWaffle and 5 wing combo (Bugolgi wings)\nOrder of 15 wings (Buffalo sauce, and Korean sauce)...\n15 minutes later after putting our order in I'm thinking there is NO way 15wings is enough for 4 people!! I get up to order 10 more curry wings and she hands me my bag of already done food. (Keep in mind 15 wings in 15 minutes!).\nThen she gives me attitude for ordering 10 curry wings and says to me it will take 40minutes! I said that's fine, I knew she was lying! I timed it, took 15minutes! \nTHAT was the WORST customer service ever, she could of saved us all some time and took my half a pan order of 25 wings that I ended up getting anyways! She just wasted containers which is MONEY for the company and wasted My time ordering 2 times and pissed off a potential client who would of came back multiple times if she wasn't RUDE! By the way the guy who was the cook was VERY NICE, he made me feel a little better with his positive attitude, got some of the sour taste out of my mouth. If you are the owner dude, you need to get rid of this lady or train her to be NICE. \n\nSo now on to the food- Bugolgi and Korean was our favorite Buffalo was ok and Curry was over battered and tasted blah. Waffle was tasty and syrups were good too, just wish I ate it before it got a bit soggy. IF I were to go back Bugolgi is what I would get the most of. Chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy in the middle.\n\n(I just read the note from the owner to me and I FEEL Threatened and disrespected just because I am a yelper and stated the facts about my experience there. Yelp is where I found out about your business in the first place, I saw the high ratings and the photos that made your food look good. I don't typically read a restaurant's blog before going in so I had NO CLUE about any threats that were placed against the owners, which is very sad and unfortunate, sorry for that. But you can't blame all yelpers or all of your clients for others mistakes. Maybe think of a solution to why customers are unhappy and try to fix it. Hire another staff member if it's becoming too overwhelming, but it's not cool taking it out on your clients who are not threatening you and just there for some good food. And to top it off post these comments on my wall threatening people they might end up buried in your backyard, I don't think I feel comfortable walking into your business again even if I think those bugolgi wings are good. Sorry for your misfortune and good luck! )", "author": "Karen T."}

Bulgogi was good, but a little too sweet for my liking. The KFC had a nice spicy kick to it. But when I saw \"korean fried chicken,\" I was imagining something like San Tung's dry fried chicken wings. So I disappointed myself when it was nothing like it. The sweet potato fries were pretty good. They're more waffle shaped then fries shaped though. Some pieces had a little too much salt on it too. But overall, it was a nice meal.\n\nCame back the next day to try their fried chicken sandwich but they said they weren't making it that day (why put it on the menu if it's not a daily thing?). So I had their bulgogi slider instead and was a disappointment. Nothing special about it. Tried their Green chicken wings too, and that was unique.

I think a wild, medium sized tree blocks this location from being seen by the rest of the world. har har har. But im kinda glad that it is because then i dont have to wait. this lil gem of a store has some of the best, and also cheapest waffles available in the city. When you walk in, you can instantly smell those sweet sweet waffles being made on the insta-grill; they are constantly made on an infinite basis. Supply and Demand. It'll take about 5 minutes a waffle, but be patient, you will not be disappointed. Panko momma and Panko poppa have gotchu covered.\n\n5 star waffles, whip cream over butter 5 out of 7 times a week. ~4bucks each\n\n4 star green chicken, interesting flavors and I appreciate how its not soggy even tho take out. ~7bucks\n\n3 star fries, reminds me of mcdonald fries but they wilted quite quickly. \n~4bucks\n\nHot Sauce and Panko also has an app that lets you build up check-in stamp cards via app. I think if you check in 10 times u get some free chicken wangs, and a hot sauce off the wall of fire if you check in 25 times. I think u can just come in everyday and buy somethin small til u make it to the rewards, but only if u are a fan (u would have to spend basically 250 bucks worth of waffles for a ~10$ bottle of hot sauce; even banks have better interest rates than that!)

Did not know it existed but I went for Pho to my fav place and it had closed on me.  I was heading back to the other pho place and drove past HotSauce and Panko.  I was intrigued.  \n\nSmall place, four seat inside, four outside.  If they were smart they would purchase the parking space in front of their store, set up an awning, an outdoor heater and more tables.\n\nI ordered the KFC wings (Korean Chicken Wings) and some sweet potato fries.  It was only me so I just got one.   I was surprised at the price.  I thought they were very expensive.  I'm not sure if they were going for premium price or just trying to make their money back, still... I'm a sucker for wings.\n\nIt did take a while.  I know that it takes time to cook food good.  I didn't mind in the least.  \nThe owner, working the fryer, was intent on his work but when I cracked a joke he had an easy laugh.  I was able to make him laugh a few other times too, though he did not say to much.  The young man working the register was sweet and attentive.  The shop interesting with all those bottles of hotsauce.\n\nI sat down at a table, right next to a couple of guys in tats (and clothes) getting their banquet order of wings.  The tables were just close enough to feel a bit uncomfortable but I just put that out of my mind (not because of the tats, but just cause I felt like I was joining their party)\n\nThe wings were amazing!!!  Large, succulent, crispy and juicy inside. That sauce was spicy and sweet. I thought it might be a bit too spicy, but after a few bites the sweet won out over the spicy.  It was wonderful. Best wings I have in a very long time.  They keep this up and they are going to have to move to a larger place.\n\nThe two guys next to me were getting ready to leave and offered me a taste of their wing choices.  So I got to taste the green wings and the buffalo too.  The green wings were amazing.  I am going to order them next time. Buffalo, their way, was too hot for me.\n\nThe sweet potato fries were just, OK.  They were a bit soggy and were probably frozen.  They might look into double frying their potato product because I've seen a few dis'es about the fried potatoes on here.\n\nOver all:  I can't wait to go back.  This could become my fav binge place.

The place is a little small but it's has a comfortable and homey feel to it. \n\nI love the owner! I'm not sure what his name was, but he loves recommending his favorite sauces, as well as which ones pair well with which flavor of chicken you order. I even asked him what his personal favorite was one day and he personally put his favorite hot sauce on my table and let me have a taste! They have a huge selection of sauces, but if you love heat and are up for the challenge try a teaspoon of the Ghost Pepper on your wings, I swear it'll make you sweat!\n\nThis place is a great place to go if you really want a quiet but friendly atmosphere. There's free coffee and water (no Starbucks, but hell its free). Also they have condiments for waffles such as caramel sauce and... BACON flavored syrup :] \n\nThe wings are a little pricey, I think you average around $1 per wing but you definitely get what you pay for. I've tried all of their wings so far and my favorites are the Green wings and the Bulgogi. \n1. The Green wings have a great mix of cilantro and jalapeno flavor with just the right amount of saltiness. They're crispy, tender and moist! They're great for people who want dry wings, rather than having something lathered in sauce. \n2. The Bulgogi wings are saucy, but they still have a slight crisp to them, which gives it a great texture! The sauce is delicious (it's a mix of Korean hot sauce, sesame seed oil and magic) :] This is really good for people who want some Asian Persuasion on their wings!\n3. The other flavors are worth a try (only if you're up for the challenge and have the budget) (another favorite of mine was the Thai-Peanut sauce wings)\n\nIn general this is a really great place! The wings are delicious, the atmosphere is great for casual dates and hang outs! The owner is amazing company! The sauces are exotic and amazing! \n\nSo take a ride on the wild side!

I died a little eating them.\n\nKorean fried wings - What's the difference between Bulgogi and Korean style wings, you may ask? The red paste.

Not my favorite of the bunch, but still good.\n\nHave you seen the machine they use to make wings? Apparently it was transported from Canada (ey). Well, more wings' places should think about investing in one of those babies if they want to have such delectable treats. And if you love wings, get the bulgogi ones.

The bacon was soggy and obviously cooked in the microwave several hours before.  The bread was stale and bland.  The coleslaw had no dressing and no flavor.

In a nutshell their wings are pleasantly plump, tender, crispy when needed, and always delicious.\n\nTheir website, and social media outreach is superb with their quirky sense of humor, and their consistent unrolling of a new special weekly.\n\nI have yet to try the famous and tantalizing-sounding Ultra Goliath Chicken Waffle Sandwich, because every time I go in I just go for the waffles and chicken wings. But will update this review, once I try their waffle chicken sandwich.\n\nThe classic Belgian waffles deserve an easy 5 out of 5 stars. They are the perfect companion to any order of chicken wings. Their fries are delicious as well.\n\nOf the wings I have tried here is a basic scorecard:\n\nGreen: 4 out of 5 stars, as the name gives away - not very spicy in comparison to its neighbors on the menu.\n\nKFC: 5 out of 5 stars. Unique and bomb.\n\nChris's Honey Sal+y Crispy Pepper: 5 out of 5 stars: The honey glaze makes for a cripsy and exquisite outside coating to the perfectly spiced wing.\n\nRed Rooster: 5 out of 5 stars. Again with a crispy, but flaming hot coating.\n\nThe folks that own and run this place are very polite and let you know that they appreciate their business. The free waffle Thursday is also very popular, and worth the trek out to the Richmond for a order of wings and a waffle any day. It was not uncommon during the NFL season for the wings to be completely ordered out, and for them to close early. This just goes to show that they are doing things right, and that the diverse palate of San Francisco finds it to be a \"Must-Try\".", "author": "Caleb M."}

A hole in the wall amongst many others in San Francisco, this place was a find that had many people coming in and out and thankfully, there is no line. \nWith very little seating(four chairs?) inside, you pretty much go in purely to buy hot sauces that are lined up on a bookshelf to your left, and to order your wings. There are tall tables outside to eat your wings, but you have to stand. Not really an issue I think. \nOrdered the KFC(Korean fried chicken) wings, panko parm wings, and a waffle. All were very delicious, my least favorite was the Korean fried chicken wings, not because it was too spicy or anything, but it tasted like wings dripped in srichacha, and I've never been a fan of srichacha.

I've tried their chicken sandwiches, slaw (very unique and tasty), and wings, of course. I really think their wings are out of this world. I never have been a huge fan of buffalo wings because they usually consist of as much skin and bone as they do of meat. At HS&P, that is never the case! The wings are always very meaty and tender. If you order the panko (or bulgogi - sorry, I forgot which - check the menu), you receive a special sauce that the owner makes. It's not too spicy and it's very tasty. Add Sriracha or any of their other hot sauces to it if you want some more heat. I love how they consistently experiment with new kinds of wings and foods, always adding and subtracting their experiments to the menu while keeping the standards. It definitely makes it more interesting than your standard fare. \n\nThe only reason that they did not get a five star review is that they sometimes run out of food, which can make customers disappointed. Many a day I will be jonesing for some HS&P and see that it's closed when I go outside my house to check if it's open. My advice to them: find a way to stock up to meet the demand.

However, the flavors were definitely there, you can tell they really take the time to perfect the sauces that they coat the wings with. \n\nThe prices were fair, i spent $10 on about 12 wings, two different flavors. I also slid my card through an Ipad and then signed with my finger which was amazing to say the least.  I also don't think the wings here are cooked to order, i wouldn't mind waiting a few extra minutes for really hot wings that were just made. The wings could be a bit more savory, and maybe an option to have them deep fried? Sometimes I crave a nice fried crunchy greasy wing.  But anyways, 5 stars nonetheless, Hot Sauce and Panko is a great fresh concept, and a nice addition to the neighborhood.  If i'm not back here to try some of their crazier creations, i'll definitely be back to buy some of the dozens of hot sauces they sell in store.", "author": "Randy N."}

Bacon syrup, need I say more? \n\nRecently I decided to venture off into their wings. Half my family is vegetarian (but I'm not) so I didnt think much about their wings before. Then one day I wanted something savory too because a waffle just wasnt enough to hold my appetite and noticed they have the wings + waffle combo for about $6ish? (I forgot how much but it is relatively that cheap/around that ballpark!) I cant decide on what flavor I wanted so I went with the regular. Even with the regular, I was super content! Yummy!\n\nHowever, I noticed they have unusual flavors. Flavors you dont normally get at your average wing place! \n\nBut most importantly, aside from the good food, the couple who owns the shop is super nice. I'm a talkative person (as evident here), so I like to strike up conversations. It's nice to meet people who are friendly and dont mind conversing with you.

DAMN! the chicken is thrown in a mix of lime, fish sauce, blue agave, and red pepper flakes and the dipping sauce (wow!) was a mix of orange, garlic, ginger, and chile that was other worldly! though we lost out on the majority of our sauce due to my son wanting some so bad he knocked it over. however our couch and rug smells awesome right now!\n\ni also got a 50/50 (fries and onion rings) that were also tasty. fries could have been cooked a little longer but were salted up perfectly so ill still 5star it.\n\nPLUS, they have about 20 different sauces sitting out on the table that you can cup up and bring home. along with a wall of bottled sauces you can buy this is a one stop for everything HOT related.\n\nlastly, with my hands full (baby and bottle), the owner(?) grabbed my bag of wings and helped me out the door to my car. now THATS service. \n\nanother run for some of those delicious wings is a definite! looking forward to trying more flavors and trying the waffles next... oh yeah... did i mention that they ALSO have waffles? much eating to do... gotta go!", "author": "Justin T."}

And repeat. \n\nThe flavor and texture combinations for all their offerings are total genius.\n\nIt's enough to make me forgive their somewhat erratic business. Sometimes they're open, sometimes they're not, and they seem to change their hours at whim. If you're coming from far away, definitely call first to ensure they're open.", "author": "Aiko S."}

I fucking LOVE Korean-style fried chicken, and I'd had some fantastic ones in the South Bay, so needless to say, having something near my apartment was a revelation.\n\nIt was a bit cold to sit outside, and the inside seating was taken, so I figured I'd bring them home on the 38. Easy, right?!\n\nThe ordering part was a snap: I got a single order (5 wings) of the KFC. The smells coming from this place was amazing; I was standing near the doorway, and at least twice, groups of people walking by were pointing into the place and saying \"OMG that's the chicken wing place! That smells so GOOD!\" ...and they were right.\n\nSo I got my wings, and the guy thanked me for waiting. It's no problem waiting when I know I'm going to be receiving quality product. I began my walk towards the bus stop, back up 17th Avenue.\n\nThe bus was arriving in 4 minutes, which was perfect. I arrived at the stop, the bus pulls up, and there's a woman trying to get off the front because she was obviously a senior. This bitch cuts her off and gets on before she can get down the stairs; I want to slap people like that in the back of the head. It's just fucking rude.\n\nThe bus starts on its way. The smell of these wings is driving me NUTS, but I can't chow down on them on the bus because they're messy. Hella messy, even. As the bus rolled down Geary, I was worried that the wings were becoming exponentially less crispy as I waited. I was terrified. Scared. \"Oh noes, I will not be able to judge these wings properly when I arrive home and stuff them down my gullet!\"\n\nFINALLY, I arrive at the 28th Ave stop, run to my apartment, and take off my hoodie and wash my hands. I'm salivating and my hands are shaking...I cannot take my eyes off the container of wings.\n\nI dig into the first one, which was a wing (as opposed to a drummette)...PHENOMENAL. Holy shit, they were still just that perfect amount of crispy. The Korean paste mix on the outside is absolutely perfect: not too thick, just spicy enough, and just absolutely delicious. I had 5, and had eaten before this whole adventure, but I wanted TWENTY MORE.\n\nSeriously, if you have the means and the (one?) friend to share with, go ahead and call in an order of the 1/2 pan of KFC wings. They're that amazing.\n\nI will be back for KFC wings + waffle combination...more than likely with another side of 5 wings of a different flavor. I wanna try the curry ones!!", "author": "Cody K."}

It felt like we were eating wings in a hot sauce shop, but that doesn't mean they weren't good.\nMy friend got 5 KFC (Korean fried chicken) and 5 Fiery Hot (?) plus a waffle. I got 5 Bulgogi and a waffle.\nBecause they're made to order, the wait was a bit long, but that gave us time to look at the different hot sauces and sample a few too. But it was nice knowing that our wings weren't pre-fried and sitting under a heat lamp. \nMy Bulgogi wings were pretty awesome. Saucy, but still crispy with a bit of savory/sweet. I didn't try the KFC, but the fiery hot were pretty spicy. \nMy only complaints would be that my friend's wings (but not mine, oddly) had a slight freezer burn taste since the wings ARE frozen. But it wasn't enough to detract from the crispy wings. Secondly, there's not much area to sit. We sat on the window sill with mismatched tables. There were also tables outside, but it was a typical gloomy and cold SF day. So I definitely want to return to try their other wings, but I personally wouldn't plan an all-out meal here. \nBut fried chicken wings + waffles... always a good thing.\nI also heard Thursday is free waffle day?!", "author": "Jen T."}

The block has only been strengthened by the existence of HS&P because, in my opinion, hot sauce and homebrew go hand-in-hand.  (Lots of passionate people excited about creating something legendary for the tastebuds)\n\nI'm looking forward to going back to try the sandwiches and waffles.  So far, I have tried the following wing flavors: XXXHOT (BEWARE wow super hotness), KFC (their #1 seller, Korean Fried Chicken...nomnomnom), green (cilantro, garlic, etc), habanero (delectable habanero citrus vinagrette), brown sugar ham glaze...lots of others that are escaping my memory right now but they're always changing it up which is awesome.  Suffice to say, this place inspires me.  I want to go there just to drink real ginger soda to cool my tastebuds and hang out at the hot sauce bar...a cheap date for a Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe owner is always willing to give suggestions regarding his favorite hot sauces.  And he definitely has good taste which is reflected in the options in the menu.  Together the owner and his wife make me feel welcome every time. \n\nOverall, given all the positives, the only negatives are that seating is cramped and there are no bathrooms.  And the joke non-functioning mini-urinal on the wall when you walk in doesn't really help when nature calls.\n\nThe neighborhood is out of the way but parking is usually manageable...I find that I am starting to crave this place when I am nowhere near the neighborhood...for good reason.\n\nKWB", "author": "Kate B."}

That is if you don't miss it, literally!  The entrance of this establishment is very inconspicuous, not resembling an eatery but perhaps a personal residence or small business office.  However, the food is DELISH!\n\nTheir menu features a large variety of wings, sides, waffles, and sandwiches.  A single order of wings consists of 5 pcs for about $6, but a better deal would be the 8X1 (8 pcs with one sauce for about $9).  The wings are good sized and are meaty, tender, and moist.\n\nI tried 3 different types of wings with a waffle:\n\n*  KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) Wings - A mildly spicy wing (not fried with a batter) covered with a sauce of chili paste, garlic, sesame oil, and agave.  They had a unique flavor with the little kick from the spiciness.\n\n*  Green Wings - A very tasty wing dry fried and covered with a sauce of cilantro, ginger, jalapeno, sesame oil, and a dry spice blend.  Great tastin'!  The jalapeno is not overpowering but provides a flavorful mild blend.  YUM!\n\n*  Bulgogi Wings - OMG!  My favorite!  A dry fried wing drenched in a bulgogi sauce with the perfect blend of sweetness and tanginess.  One bite and I was in heaven!\n\n*  Belgian Waffle -  For about $3.50, this is one of the best tastin' waffles I've ever had.  Not one of the small miniature-sized waffles, but a large 7-8\" round Belgian.  The consistency is light and fluffy, and it's cooked to a perfect golden brown color with edges that have just the right amount of crispiness and crunch.  Topped with a delicious scoop of whipped butter and a choice of maple, blueberry, or strawberry syrup and you have one AMAZING waffle! \n\nThe place is very clean and the main decor is a wall displayed with about 100 different types of hot sauces for purchase.  You also have an extensive choice of hot sauces to try with your wings.  Being rather space limited, with only about 2-3 small tables, this is more ideal for take out.  If you do decide to eat there, be sure to empty your bladder before arrival since there is no bathroom. \n\nI had one great, satisfying meal and it was a bargain!

The KFC sauce that everyone raves out is pretty good, tang with a hint of sweetness. I'm not a fan of sweet with my spice, but this was pretty tasty. The wings, however, were not \"fried\". Still yummy but I do like the crunch. The buffalo sauce was pretty good, it leaves a nice burn... but it wasn't spicy enough for me.

I was the only one there though so that probably played a factor. \n\nThey also have the frequent buyer cards near the cashier register. Cleverly hidden on the back of their business card...

I've always been the type to keep on checking out new places while only occasionally coming back to a few places.  This is all going to change due to this place.  I am going to eat everything on this menu in the next 30 days.  Why when I have so many more restaurants in my neighborhood I haven't been to yet?\n\nObviously the food: So far I've ordered the Bulgogi wings and the Korean Fried Wings.  The Bulgogi wings had a good sweetness to them that sort of reminded me of street food in Bangkok.  The Korean wings were pretty delicious although I would have appreciated some extra spiciness.  I also tried one of my roommates Brown Sugar and Ham Glazed wings.  Also, very tasty although I would never order them over the KFC wings.  Plus when I arrived to get my order while my wings were ready they didn't cook the waffle until I arrived so it would be fresh.  I really appreciated it and made sure to drive fast and take chances on the ride home so it would still remain as fresh as possible.\n\nThe Prices:  I could eat here every meal without breaking the bank.  Definitely a plus.\n\nSo far we have some pretty delicious food at a great price.  A solid four stars.  But they take things here to the next level to get to that fifth star.\n\nThe Hot Sauces: It's not just that they have a huge selection of hot sauces here.  It's that it is a selection of hot sauce built by someone who loves their hot sauce.  If you are looking for a hot sauce especially for a specific purpose talk to the owner (the guy cooking up all of your food) and he will rain down on you with some hot sauce knowledge.  Also, they have a ton of hot sauces that you can throw on your food to give it some extra spice or just sample to see what you like before you buy a bottle of the it.  Some people I've told about this did not seem impressed but to me this is nothing short of amazing!\n\nSome Other Stuff:  Super nice staff.

That Ghost Pepper wings though and I think I've said enough about those.  Got fries for my son and they were good too.  Don't know what that Hugo V. was talking about.  Of course he wants to be a food critic.  What he is, is a joke if you ask me.  The wings here are the best I've had since I've had wings at the Chieftain Irish Pub.  I think they are far above everyone else.  They care about the product they serve and that's what you look for at eateries.  It's about the integrity of the product being put forth and not the quantity.  I feel people get that misconstrued just like Hugo V.  Anyways, can't wait to make a trip down there.  It is worth the trip for some of their chicken wings.  Hot Sauce and Panko, keep it poppin' down there in the Richmond District.  Y'all doin' a great job!", "author": "Papa S."}

This particular creation supersedes San Tung's wings (albeit they are outstanding too) by introducing the honey glaze - it perfectly coats the wing and when cooked, caramelizes just perfectly to give it a uniform \"crust/crunch\" that is so wonderfully juxtaposed to the soft, rich, juicy chicken meat you take in with each bite - by adding in the salt and pepper (so simple, and so good), you get a wing that has just the right balance between sweet and savory, crispy and juicy, and you just can't eat one - take my advice Terrance, patent this recipe and enter it into any chicken wing competition!!!!", "author": "Richard D."}

After banging my head against the door one last time I resolve to come back the next day during business hours.\n\nWednesday: My lover gets off work. We bundle up and run towards Clement street. The door to Hot Sauce and Panko is open. Running....running...we skid to a halt as some turtle slow pedestrians with a fraction of my spice craze crawl their way into the store. No biggie. This gives me time to salivate over the plethora of \"tester\" hot sauces available to try with tiny plastic sporks. I start to twitch. I start to itch! Where is it? Where is it? Yes! I see it. The Ghost Chili sauce! The unassuming bottle doesn't leave my peripheral vision as we order six buffalo hot wings, a side of potato salad, and a HUGE crispy salty chicken sandwich on a fresh white roll with american cheese, jalapeno coleslaw, and avocado instead of bacon.  Grand total? $11 something. Bargain. During the eight or ten minutes it takes for them to make our food I try eight or ten different hot sauces. I start out with some simple jalapeno/habanero sauce and then move towards brick red dollops of Dave's Original Insanity and Dave's Ghost Chili hot sauces. Aghh...delicious smoky pain. The man behind the counter flashes me a huge smile and tells me to drink some chocolate syrup. The folks working in the shop seem very passionate about chili's and are willing to talk to you about culinary pain-if you can manage to move your swelling tongue in conversation. \n\nWe take our picnic meal to the freezing bay to watch geese poop and peck while we suckle our juicy hot wings. In my opinion the wings could have been a bit crispier but I thoroughly enjoy the peppery punch that accompanies their spicy and tangy flavor. I wonder if they would toss your wings in some Ghost Chili sauce if you asked them to. I wonder if they would give you an ice bath afterwards. No no, just jump in the icy bay. In my pained stupor I forgot to grab some to-go sauce for the chicken sandwich but it was delicious, ridiculously filling, and well lubricated on its own. I will most definitely be returning tomorrow to purchase some hot sauce to carry in my backpack for emergencies-or maybe I'll use it to make some home made pepper spray. Just kidding. Thank you for existing Hot Sauce and Panko.", "author": "Caity F."}

Anyways I decided to check this place out on Yelp while I was at work. To my surpise, this place has 4.5 STARS!! After reading the reviews from my fellow yelpers I asked my friend to get me a sandwich and some chicken wangs...this was before 3 o'clock because after that all the sandwiches would be sold out according to the reviews. \n\nWell it turns out that they don't make the buns, but they do however make the sandwiches! yea pretty weird.\n\nAlright so after seeing the pictures on Yelp, I asked my friend to get me the \"rrbblt\" sandwich and the \"green wings\" but of course I can't eat it until I get off work (bummer)! So I thought of course the sandwich and the wings won't be that good after just sitting in my friends car for a few hours, but whatever I wanted to try it out anyways. After I got off work, I met up with my friend at home and I just threw both the wings and the sandwich in the microwave, took it out and took a bite of the sandwich....MMmmmMmm I'm in sandwich heaven, the thinly sliced roast beef was cooked to perfection. The sweet savory cole slaw complimented very well with the roast beef ! What more could I ask for? All in all I give this sandwich 5 stars! The wings on the other hand were not only a bit salty, it was also a bit oily, other than that it did pack some great cilantro and jalapeno flavor!! YUMMMMYYYY!!! :D 3.5 stars!\n\nI will for sure go back and visit and try some other sandwiches and perhaps some other flavored wings! \nDo I recommend this place to anyone you ask? Oh HELL YEAHHH!!

Go to this place, give them your money, do it now!\n\nI saw a blurb pop up about this place on the Richmond SF Blog, and knew I had to go before it blew up.  Then two days later it popped up on the Thrillist blog.  And it needed to be done.\n\nWe tried going Saturday evening after a mid-afternoon kegger and were dismayed to find them closed (7 or 8pm on a Saturday night?).  But not ones to be shot down easily, we returned for lunch Sunday.  And it was everything we'd hoped for!\n\nThere are places that aspire to be something cool, or trendy, or have the new big thing, and then there are places that just rock, that do exactly what you hope and do it right.  This is one of those places.  The banner out front is unassuming, the decorations inside are clearly there more because the owners find them entertaining than to purvey any attempt at trend or style.  The shelves after shelves of hot sauces for sale make me want to come back and try a new bottle every week.  The tasting bar of sauces came replete with obscure sauces and genuine tasting suggestions from the owner.  And a serious range from ass-in-the-tub light your face on fire sauces to milder flavored sauces, in addition to classic habanero lime flavors and your tame Tabascos.\n\nWe ordered a half pan between three of us ($7 apiece, easy).  Something like 35 wings? Just the right amount.  They split the pan into sections and served out...\n\nThe Buffalo Hot Wings (good, standard, but paled in comparison to the others),\nThe Brown Sugar and Ham Glaze (mother of sweet baby Jesus who knew brown sugar on wings could taste so good? Protip: pair these bad boys with the Louisiana Swamp Scum sauce), \nAnd the Korean Fried Chicken (I'm starting to believe these HS&P folk can do no evil).\nThe girlfriend is vegetarian, and was way stoked that they serve MorningStar artificial bacon (but that shit's for heathens, so that's all I'll say on that).\n\nI hope for the best for this spot, and that they don't fall to the quick turnover that plagues restaurants in this city.\n\nA couple kinks to work out:\n-Seating: there's a bench inside and a small table outside.  We found ourselves stuck at the decision to take the wings home and sit comfortably vs eating there and enjoying the wings hot and the tasting bar to accompany our meal.\n-Hours:  I don't know anything about time/money management, but I'd bet this place could make mad bank if they stayed open a little later, at least on the weekends.  Wings are drunchie heaven.\n-Delivery: awww that'd just too cool.\n-Menu: A little more clarity on what you're ordering.  I.E. descriptions of what the sauces are, or what goes into the different sides, and how many wings are included with different orders.  Also, plug for catering on the menu, I could see hiring HS&P for a party without a doubt.\n\nKeep up the good work, best of luck guys!", "author": "Josh T."}

Besides the standard offering of sweet, medium, hot, and xxx hot - hot wings, they have an extensive menu of other styles of chicken wings that I just can't wait to go back and try.  Korean fried hot wings.  Mexicali fried hot wings, Brown sugar and ham glazed wings, Kuzu salt and pepper, thai peanut sauce, XO sauce; so many to try!  They also had a few sandwiches and they do chicken wings and waffles; with torani bacon syrup!  There is an impressive selection of hot sauces you can both purchase and sample/use at the condiments station.  The couple that run the place are very nice.  \n\nComments list.\n* Strictly Take out.  Grab a pan and go picnic in the park or just eat on the curb.\n* The meat was good, tender, but didn't slide off bone cleanly (like it does in *perfect* wings).  That's ok because I haven't seen anyone in SF get their wings like that.\n* Spice on the \"hot\" hot wings was great.  My scalp was radiating sweat and capsaicin stimulated endorphins.  While I am guessing xxx hot is probably outside of my comfort zone, I could foresee it as not being spicy enough for some of the hard core chiliphiles out there; the ones who can EAT habaneros, but again, there is a great selection of hot sauces at your disposal to up the ante so it's probably an unnecessary point to make.  Not sure if the Ghost Chili hot sauce they sell was on the condiments counter.\n* I would have liked for the wings to be crispier.  Do people double fry wings like they do fries?  Not sure how some places get them extra crispy.  That extra layer of crunch makes hot wings so much better.\n* ok value?  hooters sells hot wings at 10 for $6.79.  but that's hooters =P  San Tung at ~12 for $9.00.  HS&P 5-6 for $5, or 10-11 for $10.  Not bad but they are also not at San Tung's level of crackilicious in my opinion, but those are altogether two different types of hot wings.\n* Speaking of San Tung, they need (if they don't have it already) their version of San Tung dry fried hot wings.  Crackilicious!\n* They have a \"buy 9 or 10 orders of hot wings get one free\" stamp card.\n* You can call in and order giant pans of hot wings ($19.99 and $39.99) for parties or football games.", "author": "Nat L."}

Two on the inside so you can fit maybe 6 people and then a four person table on the outside. So take these to go because eating there will make you feel large and cramped. You order at the counter and it's cool they have a little shelf with different hot sauces and it's a neat little selection of funny sauce names, hottest sauces you've ever had and stuff of that nature. We got 4 different types of wings, they either come in 6 piece or 12 piece orders. We got 12 each. We got the korean fried chicken ones, bulgogi flavored wings, green onion, and sriracha ones. They were all cooked well and the sauces were all amazing. My favorite was the green onion. They are great, small wings but the flavor more than makes up for it. We were good afterward, splitting 4 orders of 12 wings between 3 people. We were content, not full to the point of dying but not hungry either. Good wings to get to go, my friend lives down the street from here so we walked and picked them up at ate as his place. Hot sauce on them just makes it better as well.

My buddy introduced me to this place a few months ago when we went to brewcraft next door.\n\nI had to try the XXX hot sauce, but the owner/sauce-master adviced to try stage 1. I tried it and it kicked my tongue's ass! Now whenever I bring people I peer pressure them into trying X1 as a hazing ritual. I downgraded to HOT, which in my opinion is the best flavor for the wings. I don't know how he does it but the homemade hot-level sauce has this nice sweet-citrus flavor along with its kick.\n\nMy favorite of the open hot sauces (at the \"flavor station\") is the Holy Jolokia. But, I would just put that on some mild wings, bulgogi wings, or on a sample spoon because, honestly, this man knows how to brew up a fantastic adventure for the taste buds.\n\nI go for the wings and waffles every time. The sweet potatoes are also quite good. The last time I was there a guy asked me what was good on the menu. I do not regret my response, \"Everything.\"", "author": "RC K."}

I'm an avid wing fan, as is she, and so we mainly went to wing places. I have to say that this place was great. I really like that you can get a waffle with your wings to kind of counteract the spiciness of some flavors, and believe me they can get spicy. I didn't try all of their wings, but I really liked the 1x hotness, it wasn't too hot and but it still left a burn. Got to check it out", "author": "Arrash D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-09-04", "description": "I love the food here.  Good wings places are solely lacking in the Bay Area, and this place definitely delivers.  I tried two kinds - the \"hot\" buffalo wings (you can choose from sweet, mild, spicy, and xxx) and the korean fried chicken (the menu said these were their most popular, so it seemed like a good bet).  Both were very tasty and nicely spicy without being overwhelming.  If you do like your wings super hot, there are about 20 hot sauces you can sample and/or add to your food.  I also tried the belgian waffle, which was a standard but very tasty waffle - although obviously regular fried chicken and waffles are the more standard pairing, I thought this pairing was excellent too.  There's also a selection of sauces for the waffles (syrup, caramel, a few fruit sauces, chocolate, etc.).  The prices seemed very fair, and the food was totally fresh (each item made to order) and delicious.\n\nI'm docking a star here because of the hours.  It's hard to catch them for weeknight dinner after work (they close at 7), and to me at least, dinner isn't really even prime wing time.  I'd love it if this shop could extend its hours to evening/late night since that's really when I tend towards a chicken wings and waffles craving.\n\nEdit - today tried the peanut-ginger and mexi-cali wings.  The peanut-ginger were awesome! Maybe my fav wings here - tasted just like the peanut sauce you'd get with chicken satay, plus lots of scallions. The mexi-cali wings were super hot, but flavorful...yum!", "author": "Sara C."}

There's a bit of heat to it, but it's manageable.  Ordered it with a waffle, because I LOVE a good fresh off the iron waffle with all my meals.  The sandwiches were huge, but the FC in it was a bit on the dry side - maybe because I need either more sauce/mayo or more tomatos.  Service was painfully slow because there's only ONE guy taking your order and he's the one making it too.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-02", "description": "Really, really shocked that there is anything less than a 4 star review for this place, and that there are complaints about how terrible customer service is.  I love, love LOVE Hot Sauce and Panko -- it's one of my favorite spots in the city.  I've had out-of-town visitors trek across town and friends drive in from the South Bay for their wings -- they are that good.\n\nIf it wasn't so far away from my home, I'd be in serious danger of becoming obese from chicken wings.  I try to stop by every time I'm passing through the neighborhood, though I do try to exercise some restraint from time to time.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n- Tiny, hole-in-the-wall mom & pop shop -- but maintains quality and cleanliness!  (I hate when mom & pops think they can be dingy and subpar just because they are a mom &pop.)\n- Owner is friendly, approachable and genuinely enthusiastic about hot sauce and wings.  The selection of hot sauces is personally curated, and he can/will tell you about whichever one interests you.\n- Mouth-wateringly delicious wings.  The plumpest, meatiest, juiciest wings I've had anywhere.  Mmmmm.  My favorite are the green wings (which have just a hint of spice -- and I usually don't like non-spicy wings)!\n- If you're a serious chile-head, the hot wings are actually HOT.  I mean, really hot.  I'm no spice wimp, but the 'hot' level is about as much as I can comfortably handle.  (Levels of spice go from 'hot' to '3X.')  I've had two wings at the 1X level - it took me about 20 minutes and a half gallon of water to get that much down.  Would be a fantastic place for a hot wing throw down with some buddies!\n- Fantastic selection of hot sauces.  I've yet to buy one but have eyed them longingly every time I've been in...\n\nTHE BAD:\n- Limited seating because it's a hole-in-the-wall.  Call ahead and get your wings to go if you live close by.\n- Only open until 8pm -- sometimes you just have a late night wing craving, but my guess is the location's not conducive to late-evening/night hours.\n- Re: complaints about long waits and timing of the orders -- I've never personally had a problem, but I can see where it might be an issue.  It's a small operation, and I think they haven't been able to scale up production to meet the demand since they've become so popular.  But cut the man some slack -- I think he's been open for less than a year!  I think they'll fix the kinks as time goes own; I'd consider the inconvenience of waiting the growing pains of a burgeoning, popular business.  It's the price you pay for the best wings anywhere.\n\nTo all the haters who are complaining about how rude and uncaring the staff are:  I was in the shop one afternoon when a bunch of 12 year old boys came in and ordered the 3X with a lot of bravado.  They grabbed their wings and went outside, and one took a whole wing and gobbled it in about five seconds to show off to his buddies.  He immediately turned red with tears streaming down his face and started gasping for air.  He could barely talk; I think his tongue was numb from the spice!  Various staff members and the owner came out and made sure he had enough water and chocolate syrup (no milk around I guess) to try to help him cool down over the next 20 mins.  They really tried to take care of him -- I mean, you could have just shrugged and said, too bad, no one told you to order the 3X!\n\nIf you love hot sauce and/or hot wings, this is a MUST SEE & TASTE.", "author": "Coco L."}

The KFC is really delicious. Don't like the name which gives me a greasy feeling. Green wings are also good. The habenero is never around, he sells out of the stuff which makes Lisa want it that much more. She likes hot stuff so I'll wait for her opinion. In the meantime the Thai curry is a bit too creamy for my taste. Just scarfed down the roast beef sandwich which was good enough but could use more MEAT. YK had the fried chicken sandwich was a bit dry but after she put on some of the Georgia Peach sauce and it rocked! The guy is super nice, very helpful and friendly. It's like going to your friend's house for a snack but your friend is a hot sauce fanatic and has his own deep fryer and he can't afford any furniture for you to sit down and his bathroom is so messed up that he won't let you use it.

Just like Ike's, they suggest you call ahead and that WILL make your visit here five stars.  I ordered a half pan (19.99) + Belgian waffle 45 minutes ahead of time, went to pick it up and it was ready to go and when I got home, it was still hot.  so 23 dollars for a big lunch for two people.  definitely worth the price. Ordered the KFC, bulgogi, and green wings.  all delicious.  The bulgogi was my favorite.  sweet and spicy.  I'll be back to try more wings.   Best wings I have ever had, and I'm not usually a wing person.  You can either take that as I don't know good wings, or my personal belief -  that I've just never had any that were so good that I will go back for more :)   And the Belgian waffle was good.
