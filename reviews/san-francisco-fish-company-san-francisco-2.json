My son and I were walking along the front and stumbled into the Ferry building and came across to the San Francisco Fish Co. The menu for me was like a sea food candy store . So many choices to choose from. Crab Cake Sandwich, Shrimp Po Boy, Scallop Fish and Chips etc. \nWe settled for the traditional fish and chips. For the price of $15 you get 6 nice size pieces of moist and the tastiest fried fish and chips I've ever had. Not knowing before hand what kind of fish we had eaten my son asked what kind of fish it was, our server said it was catfish. If I new that before hand I would have never order it because I had catfish once before and hated it. Thought it was gamely and very oily. So this was shocking to me. Even the chips (fries) were crisp, tasty and plentiful. \nI know there there are a lot of choices like I've said earlier but San Francisco Fish Co. would be the place I would \" RUN\" to the next time I'm in town.", "author": "Alan L."}

Then when I paid, I gave him a $20 and he only gave me $12 back even though they are only supposed to be $2 each (so $6 all together.) I told him he did not give me the correct change and he kept asking if I was sure and acting like it was my bad...\n\nBasically he tried to give me 2 oysters for $4 each... hella shady.

Luckily for us, San Francisco Fish fits the bill just right.\n\nThe establishment is small with only three tables for dining patrons. The menu is variable, not only offering typical lunch items, but also fresh oysters for $2 each and fresh cuts of various seafood. \n\nFor our lunch, we ordered the fish and chips as well as a pint of New England clam chowder. The chowder was tasty with a strong aroma of herbs and fresh clams. Although, one complaint we would make is that the chowder did not have enough potatoes, eliciting a runnier texture than we would have liked. As for the fish and chips, it came out piping hot, a clear sign that it was made in house. The fries are cut on the smaller and thinner side, giving it crunchier bite, unlike the batter of the cod that veered towards the softer side. But at least the fish itself was tender. \n\nPrices are reasonable considering the area (this is SF after all!) and portion sizes are quite generous. Overall, San Francisco Fish is a decent spot for a quick lunch, earning a solid three stars from us.", "author": "Quyen L."}

They were huge and super tasty. They are a little bit gritty, but not too bad. I highly recommend!\n\nThe soft shell crab was perfectly breaded (not too thick) with a fragrant crab taste in soft acme bread. The fish from the fish and chips was also lightly breaded and the filet was fluffy and flakey. \n\nI would 100% skip the clam chowder. That tasted so weird.

It had a perfectly fried soft shell crab on a soft bun with a leaf of lettuce and some dressing. It was minimalistic but good kind of way.

To me, these looked and tasted pre-made as well.\n\nNormally, pre-made frozen coconut shrimp are pretty good, as the quality is maintained by the freezing process.\n\nUnfortunately, 2 of my shrimp had a slight iodine smell indicating that they had been thawed too long.  On top of that, all my shrimp were overfried, and basically dried out.  Hence the 2 star review.\n\nIn the future, the restaurant should monitor how long the shrimp stored, and fry them less time.\n\nOn the fresh fish side, I was shocked to see that they carry Escolar which is banned in Japan.

As a result, one of the things I love about my frequent visits to San Francisco is going for sushi, fish, oysters and more... \n\nSo on Saturday morning, when looking for the perfect fuel for my hiking and yoga adventure departing from the Ferry Building, the sign for SFFC's breakfast burritos drew me in right away.  A breakfast burrito made with fresh shrimp or crab?  Yes, please!\n\nLuckily, Andrea R, my partner in crime for the day, was agreeable and willing to go for a breakfast burrito also.\n\nWe both ordered the Crab Burrito and had no regrets... even with the $14 price tag.  It was so worth it! Made fresh to order, this filling breakfast has it all: egg, cheese, guac, and of course, fresh crab... Served steaming hot within about 8 minutes of ordering, we were in burrito heaven as we sat and ate our burritos, pretty much in silence, so we could relish every bite.  Add a little hot sauce if you're so inclined and thank me later for the rec.  \n\nTo note: the burritos are large portions, but not crazy huge; sharing is definitely an option if you're not super hungry.  \n\nI will definitely be back to SFFC... hope to go for some oysters next visit!", "author": "Gabi M."}

Last week my cousin and I met for lunch at the Ferry Building and he suggested this place.  So glad he did, because so many of their menu items sounded so good: scallop and chips, crab cake sandwich, prawn quesadilla, etc.  I ended up getting the scallops and chips, because it was so unusual.  Now, I do love scallops, when they're cooked right, but this is why I don't order them out so much, because half the time they end up coming out rubbery.    \n\nWe met up at 11:30, and the Ferry Building was already bustling, most likely due to the Farmer's Market.  There was only one seat available after we placed our order, however, luckily, when we got our food about 5 minutes later, a group of 4 was leaving.  I got 7 decent size breaded scallops with a heaping amount of fries served with the tartar sauce and cocktail sauce ketchup, and both were golden brown (love it).  The scallops were very hot as I bit into them some oil oozed out.  They were very fresh and cooked just right; I loved the breading as well.  I thought the scallops were going to be bigger, but glad they gave me 7 as I was expecting less.  Fries had some crunch to them, though more potatoey.   His soft shell crab sandwich looked great as well.  I totally didn't mind sharing my fries, but felt that for the $11, his sandwich should have included a side of fries, or perhaps a small portion of coleslaw or something.  \n\nI didn't have a reason to eat seafood at the Ferry Building because I don't do oysters (Hog Island Oyster Co.) and am slowly getting into fishes, but now that I know about San Francisco Fish Company's menu, I will definitely be back to try out that crab cake sandwich..or perhaps more scallops and chips!  If they offer those breaded scallops a la carte that would be amazing!  Come visit their storefront to get some fresh delicious seafood.", "author": "Cat C."}

There are other options but I had the blue crab po boy. It was soooo good.

He was right. I loved it. The other person in my party had the shrimp po boy and I tasted that too. That was tasty as well.\n\nI must admit eating in San Francisco can be quite pricey.

Unlike many other shops in the Ferry Building, they also have an L-shaped counter for dining in, with about 10 stools available.\n\nThe fish tacos, 3 to an order for $11, had sizable chunks of lightly fried, flaky, fresh fish and topped with shredded lettuce, red cabbage, onion, and a light salsa verde.

Mind you these are simply my taste buds and palette talking so for anyone else it may be simply average.  I can comfortably say in my heart of hearts San Francisco Fish Company makes the best Fish in a Fish & Chips I've ever had in the Bay Area. On it's own the fish is perfectly made with just the right amount of seasoning in the breading to pair with the perfectly flaky cod. When showered with the proper amount of vinegar it takes on an entirely different personality. An amazing one at that. Sadly the Chips don't hang with the fish at all.  It would be cool if they would ramp up the latter end of the dish to really make the Fish and Chips experience that much better. \n\nThere are other positive to the Fish Co. like the rotating fresh oysters and clams served as you walk by.

It's nice and rich! Good for starting your day.\nMy husband got his whiskey sage sausage burrito and was a bit hesitant at first because he saw the amount of avocado that was in it. (He didn't know it has mashed avocado since there wasn't really a description of every item in the menu). He doesn't really like avocado, at all. But I was surprised when I saw him finish all of it when I'm just half way with mine (I am not a slow eater. But to be fair, I'm the only one who ate the clam chowder). He said that the proportion is just right and the avocado didn't bother his taste buds at all. \nFor the Dungeness crab burrito, well... to be honest, I was still hungry for the chowder. If I didn't ate all the chowder, I might say that the proportion of my burrito would've been just right. But then again, I was still eyeing for the fresh oysters (Yes, I really love seafood). I didn't really taste the crab flavor, but it's probably because of the chowder. I loved the avocado. The taste of freshly squeezed lime on it  is just spot on! (I was actually grossed out of the taste of avocado since I was little. But when I moved to California from Philippines, I just had to try to like it. Almost all the asian menu here has avocado. Especially the California rolls which is my favorite back in the Philippines, but instead of avocado, we put mangoes. And since the mangoes here doesn't really taste good, I started learning how to appreciate avocado. And guess what, now I an avocado lover. Haha) I wish there was cilantro in it. Or if there was, I didn't taste it at all.\nOverall, crab burrito is okay. It probably contains at least 3 eggs which is cholesterol overload. It would've been better if they had half sizes, they would sell more of their other menu items.\nFresh oysters. Mmmmmm. One of my seafood favorites!\n$2 each and it is worth it! The sweetness and freshness of it made me want to order more. (But I didn't because we're just about to go to the Food Festival a few hours later. And my husband said that I shouldn't eat too much since there's going to be more food to try later on)\nIt's comparable to Hog Island Oysters.

Reading other reviews about the portion led me to expect a baby-sized sandwich, but it came out a well enough size with a generous amount of crab. Currently priced at $12.95 for just the sandwich, I wasn't too surprised just because you're in a tourist area - everything's gonna be a little pricey. Ordered a side of fries with it, an extra $5, came out overly salted. I would recommend to order it with no salt & salt it yourself. \n\nThis company also sells fresh seafood to take home & other lunch items like fish & chips, different versions of po'boys & oysters that they prepare for you to eat with all the condiments. It all looked so yummy. \n\nI specifically went here just for the crab po'boy sandwich & did not leave disappointed.

I had never been to San Francisco and went to the Ferry Building to check out the center and walk the piers.  Hog Island Oyster had a long line that you had to wait outside in, meanwhile this place had no line and was indoors.  It meant I had more time to peruse the other shops, so we went with this place.  We ordered the specials of the day, as we figured this meant the fish was fresh.  My mom purchased the swordfish sandwich with pesto and I had the sea bass sandwich.  We split a cup of crab gumbo as well.  The Allagash Pale Ale we split was smooth and perfect with the food.  It was a brand we'd never had, so we gave it a whirl.  The crab gumbo was spicy and rich, and though there wasn't tons of crab in it, it was flavorful as it was.  The swordfish sandwich was stacked with filets and the fish was so fresh and tender, the pesto a perfect topping.  My sea bass had a great sear on the edges, crispy and flavorful.  Their coleslaw side is nothing to get excited about, but it was good, too.  Not too watery or peppery or bland. The buns they put their sandwiches on are kind of like a torta bun. It was chewy and a little sweet, with a golden-brown smooth gleam on the top.  It was held up well to the weight of the fish!  I was extremely happy with this place.  There weren't many places to sit, but we got two bar stools and were able to people watch for a little bit.  The oyster bar was extremely popular as we saw, but we didn't try them.

We walked the whole length of the building before finally deciding to nosh on lunch here shortly after our arrival into town.

He asked if I wanted ice in the bag and I acquiesced, thinking it might be a good idea to keep the fish cold.    He goes to the back room and comes back with a plastic baggy full of ice.   As he readies to put it in the bag, he says, \"Oh, I better staple it,\" so he goes off to the cash register to staple my plastic baggy full of ice, comes back, and throws it in the freezer bag before sending me off on my not-so-fucking-merry way.\n\nI get home.   The fish stinks.   My wife's a chef and says immediately that fresh halibut is not supposed to stink this bad.   Within minutes, our house is infested by sick noxious fumes emanating from this piece of fish.   Reluctantly, she still cooks it, making sure to cook the shit out of it.   She makes a beautiful white wine sauce in which she slowly simmers the fish.\n\nLong story short:  took one bite, spit it out.   I got ready to throw the whole piece of fish out but my wife stopped me saying that our cats might enjoy it.    We put a little bit of fish in their bowl and they both ran away screeching.\n\nThat, my friends, is the San Francisco Fish Company.", "author": "David O."}

It took him almost five minutes just to TAKE my order because he was at a loss as to how to ring it up, so instead he set about erasing the posted chalkboard price and left me standing there, wallet in hand.  When he finally got back around to ringing me up, I asked if it came with anything and he said (verbatim) \"a tiny thing of cole slaw.\"  Wow, that really pumps me up.  So I also got a verrrrrrrry small container of seafood orzo (which turned out to be delicious, but sheesh, THREE BUCKS?!).\n\nDespite the expense and unpleasant service, the food was good enough to lure me back for a second visit, but I think that's it for me.  I had the sole sandwich special and--whew!--the posted price of $7.50 was actually the price I was charged.

I do like the fish. Sometimes Whole Fish looks a little past prime, however I have yet to receive a hunk of flesh that has crossed the line of odor and slime (the bad kind). Which is a weird way of saying the fish is pretty fresh. The Escolar is one of my favorites here. Also live Lobster and Crab.\n\nAlso, cool pluses include Squid Ink, Whole Crawdads, Frozen Crawdad Tailmeat, and a couple of good guys behind the counter. Two of them.\n\nNow the flipside. I too have gone in to buy and been ignored -- and would take my business elsewhere. Their loss. I was given some indignant gruff when I asked to smell a product I was going to buy. It didn't look 'right,' and so I asked. You'd think I had just insulted his madre the way he reacted. Oh well.\n\nSometimes the selection is limited, and sometimes they have some stuff that you just don't see without a special order.\n\nYes, I will continue to shop here on occasion as necessity and convenience dictate. And yes I would come back to purchase on a personal basis, too. Might I check elsewhere first.... Quite possibly.\n\nAlso, they do prepared foods, too, though I haven't indulged in any of those.\n\nCheers!", "author": "Ryan F."}

They had a pretty good looking menu, crabcake sandwich, award winning gumbo (they claim), many different types of fish sandiwches/po boys.  figured i'd try the swordfish sandwich with pesto aioli since it was a special, my friend ordered the crabcake sandwich.  Once we sit down and open up my lunch...i wasn't impressed with the size.  all there was in the sandwich was the fish, piece of lettuce and very little pesto, or not enough flavor in the pesto.  i could barely taste the pesto aioli.  the swordfish was good, moist, juicy, good flavor.  but there was nothing in the sandwich that screamed at me to \"EAT ME\".   although you aren't suppose to eat alot of swordfish in one sitting, i feel like they could have done more to it to make it look more attractive like add more garnish or more pesto aioli.  My friend wasn't impressed with the crabcake sanwich either, she said it had too much filler, not enough crab taste.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-07-14", "description": "This is one of my favorite places to buy fish and seafood (the other being Sun Fat in the mission, but for different reasons). The food however is another story. This will be a hard review to write because the two aspects of SF Fish Co earn different stars in my book. First the fish: \n\nThe thing I love about the fish and seafood here besides it's obvious freshness is the great variety and availability of certain items in their natural state. Here you can buy sea scallops in their shell with their scrumdidlyuptious roe intact. Never seen that at any where else: not Monterrey fish in Berkeley, not whole foods, no retail store of note. You could brave Chinatown but that's so much WORK. You can get whole fish like Dorade, Mullet, Sardines, Salmon and Snapper here. Giant razor clams, live and moving slow mo in their shell make an appearance. There's fresh crab, lobster, king crab and sometimes spider crabs in the tank. This is where I come when I need high quality seafood when I'm cooking! Five Stars. \n\nThe food: recently I came in to the shop to pick up some seafood to prepare risotto with later that night. I was on my lunch from work so I decided get there to go. I ordered the fish and chips. I waited a long time (I'm not good at that!) even though the place had only me and two other customers. When my food arrived I thought the portions looked small. Back at my desk at work my fish n chips were really nothing to write home about. The kitchen committed a french fry crime in that they were soggy and not crispy at all. They needed 1 more minute in the fryer  to crisp them up to a golden brown, these were pale and soggy. That really bothers me 'cause it's so hard to mess up fries, especially for this reason. The batter on the fish was very greasy and the portion of fish small. Deep frying isn't that hard and I felt they didn't do it well. \n\nSo...I give the retail part of the place Five Stars and the Food Two Stars. I am going to split the difference and give San Francisco Fish Co 3 Stars but emphasize that it rises to Five if you don't eat here.\n\nUpdate 8/15/07: I accidently gave this 1 star, so now I've bumped it up to 3 like I meant to do.", "author": "Jordan N."}

They didn't seem to have strong signs of life, but I'm not sure how much urchins really move on their own; in any case, I was eager enough to try this that I bought them anyway. I was able to buy two for 18.50.\n\nThe first yielded about a third of a typical Japanese supermarket tray's worth of uni, and was spectacularly fresh, if mild. The second gave off a mild stink when opened, and had significantly more goop (though it also yielded much more roe). Slightly wary, I was still excited enough to try this one, as the uni still looked beautiful and was more orange - I figured that the flavor would have been stronger. It tasted of rot. I dumped it immediately.\n\nAfter the effort involved in opening them and in cleaning the sink afterwards, and considering the price paid, I was sorely disappointed after being assured at the store that the urchins were well and alive.

However, I would wonder about some advice they gave me about keeping lobster more than a few days, and I haven't tried the clam chowder which I use to gauge seafood respectability.  The prices are high cause of the ferry building loc so, really, get over it, and if you're from the East like me and like your talk a bit salty, there's nothing with the service either.

I like this place simply because it is almost the only place close to my work where I can get fish.  I tried some of their cooked entrees but feel they are overpriced (for the tourist trade) and nothing very special.  I do like the prepared salads since I can get my crab louis fix almost year 'round (and I'm willing to pay the $10--which is too high but when you've gotta have it and there's no where else to go that's quick...).  I also got some Hawaii poke seasonings for my brother (I'm hoping he'll take the hint and make poke at some point for me).  And they sometimes have fresh mackerel which I am finding hard to find elsewhere.  I love looking at their fish and sometimes even buy some (but having to keep it in the work refrig until I can go home gets to be a project since the frig is overloaded already).  The guys always are very nice and patient.  Prices tend to be slightly higher then at my regular fish store but we're in the FiDi so I expected that.  Yeh, and they had a very very leggy [Alaskan Snow?] crab live in the tank--I've never seen one alive (can you say War of the Worlds?).", "author": "Kai T."}
