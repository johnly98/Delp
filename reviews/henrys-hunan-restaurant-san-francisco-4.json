All my team mates are vegetarians and they really dig this place because of there fried rice. We went around 12:30, the place is huge and was semi packed. It a two story restaurant, we were 6 people and the gave us a table upstairs. \nThe server started by serving us green tea and handing us the menus. After scanning through the menu I picked Kung pao shrimp and my team mates picked fried rice without egg.\nI was hoping to get rice with the shrimp order but there was nothing on the side. The shrimps were nicely cooked, spicy, tossed with onions and bell peppers. \nFried rice were just like any other fried rice with chopped vegetables, I felt they could have made it more tangy or spicy. \nOverall, I don't see myself going to Hunan again. There are many other Chinese restaurants in the city I would wanna try !!!", "author": "Simran K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-08", "description": "When coming here for Chinese food, you have to keep in mind the style of cooking it is. This is not the typical saucy, less oily Cantonese food you're probably accustomed to in this area. As their name suggests, this is Hunan cooking which is more oily and the spicy level is not as hot as Szechuan cooking. With that being said, Henry Hunan's serves pretty good Hunan Chinese food. My office will occasionally order take out from here if we want to change it up. The Spicy Rock Cod, Chicken Chow Mein, Marty's Special, Kung Pao Chicken, Shrimp with Tofu (has ground meat unless you specify not to add) and the Pork Dumplings are our favorites. If I could just eat Dumplings and Chow Mein, I would be set but that doesn't bold well for a low carb diet. For the vegetarian selections, we get the Egg Rolls, Country Vegetables which has some tofu and clear noodles, Vegetable Chow Mein and Stir Fried Green Beans. If you don't want any spicy or hot, their menu does offer a few dishes. They use a lot of garlic in certain dishes so I hope you like garlic. As I mentioned, this type of cooking is oily so don't come to this type of place wondering why. It's the spicy oil they use and the way it is cooked in the wok that causes it to be more oily than other types of Chinese food. It's not what you'd call \"stir fry\". I only know the term for this style of cooking in Chinese and I don't have a translation. This location is small but it's open really early so that's a plus for those working an earlier shift or those wanting to drop off an order earlier for pick up at 11:45pm.

The crust has a croissant, thin, crispy, buttery layers. It wasn't a real pie-pie when you can hold it and eat it. Imagine two layers of burrito-like wraps but opened up. First layer sits in the box as the meat filing is generously spread across layer one, followed by another generous layer of shaved fresh lettuce. The final 'layer' then goes on top. It's cut into quadrants, so if you picked it up, some meat could fall out. I found having a fork+knife handy.\n\nOverall, i would eat it again, only issue with it is the MSG.

When I was an innocent babe in the big, bad corporate jungle of this city, I used to go to either the Sansome or the Natoma location to get a wedge of the Diana's Meat Pie, a heaping helping of Henry's Special, a fiery mouthful of Kung Pao Shrimp, or the cooling peanutty goodness of the Chicken Salad. Sure it was a ton of food, but I was ready, willing and able to cope with indigestion back in the office.\n\nMy cholesterol count doesn't allow me such indulgences anymore, but I still have a craving for Henry's now and then. This location is a lot smaller and probably the most low profile of the four locations in the city, probably because they're not open on weekends or in the evening. Make no mistake that this is a lunchtime hub of activity for the working drones in the area, and this drone is just a few steps away from the place. Even with a second floor of tables a precarious climb away, it still gets packed pretty fast at noon. I usually try to come after the rush if I'm not drowning in afternoon meetings.\n\nWhat does strike me most is how much friendlier they are here versus the other locations, especially the semi-surly staff at Natoma, and I've been trying other things on the menu. Recently, I went for the $6.25 Noodles with Pork Meat and Special Hunan Sauce. Honestly, it was like a bowl of Chef-Boyardee Beefaroni, but it did hit the spot in a greasy sort of way. With a vegetarian colleague, I went for the meatless version of the $7.50 Sauteed Eggplant and the same-priced Country-Style Vegetables. Both were tasty and more than filling.

I have been eating here for going on 6 years and it's nice to have people remember you.  The staff/owners are exceedingly nice and they are always quick, efficient, attentive and awesome while I sit at the countertop and read something boring like the Wall Street Journal. \n\nWhile sitting at the counter you can stare at all the workers preparing food and you can see for yourself that this is a clean establishment.  The woman in front of me is always patiently making by HAND dumplings which are so super tasty. That and those DAMN pork pies that make me weak in the knees.  \n\nMid week I usually get a chicken/broccoli or a beef/broccoli craving.  Broccoli is very good for you, so I use that excuse every time I power down a plate of this goodness.

But when you go to his restaurant now, and ask for some Harvest Pork that'll light a fireworks display in your mouth, you're served a dish with barely enough fire to light a match.\n \nSure, now they might be reaching out for a new customer base that doesn't like starting a 4 alarm fire in their mouths, a more sane customer that probably tips better, and is classier.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-10", "description": "A great lunch spot with some addicting dishes that have me returning fairly often.\n\nCome early, especially if there are more than 2 of you.  There's typically a line out the door by 12:05 during the week.  Don't let the line intimidate you - you never have to wait more than 10 minutes or so, usually closer to 5.  Sit upstairs if you can, it's a little more relaxed.\n\nAfter spending the last few years trying other dishes there, I keep going back to the same impressive ones.   \n\nAs an appetizer, the \"Meat Pie\" is awesome.  It's a fried onion cake with what I believe is ground beef and pork  in a spicy sauce, topped with shredded lettuce, topped again with another fried onion cake.  While very different in taste, it could best be described as like a tostada.  If having as an appetizer, order one for every four people.  It can be a bit heavy as a starter if you wind up having two wedges of that (1/2 the \"pie\").\n\nThe single best entree they have originally sounded (to me) as the least appetizing (yes, even less appetizing than meat pie).  The Smoked Ham with String Beans is pretty incredible.   The smoked ham itself is more or less a kind of bacon.  It's smokiness bleeds into the balckbean sauce that lightly covers the entire dish.  These are probably some of the most satisfying green beans I've ever had.\n\nI'm also a fan of their Hunan Shrimp.  It's not amazing, but it's very good.  The sauce, whatever it is, complete it.  Bamboo shoots are cooked enough to avoid the stringiness.  The onions are rich in texture and work very well with the spicy sauce.  The carrots and bell, frankly, are forgettable.\n\nThey don't get the full five stars because they could improve upon their consistency.   For example, some days the green bean/ham dish isn't amazing, but just good.  Also, service is more miss than hit.  Finally, it's a damn madhouse in their.  They should really let you pay your bill through your server, but you have to go to the tiny counter with all the other people waiting to pay and waiting to be seated.", "author": "Dave H."}

While the menu may look the same or similar, the way they prepare the dishes varies by location. \n\nIn my opinion the Sacramento Street location is BY FAR the best one that I have tried and the Battery Steet location is the worst. The SoMa one is my second favorite location.\n\nThis review is based on the Sacramento Street location since that is the one I frequent. \n\nFirst off - Meat Pie is a must order. Now, I know that some of you out there are saying to yourself \"Meat Pie sounds gross - I'll pass\"  \n\nBig Mistake....it's addicting and delicious - try it and you will like it.\n\nOther dishes that are good: Kung Pao anything, Shrimp with meat sauce, Henrys Special (Chicken, Prawns, Scallop), Hot and Sour anything, Chicken with Black Bean Sauce, Beef with String Bean\n\nThe deal with Henry's is that all of the dishes are infused with a smoky chili flavor that is not commonly found in most chinese restaurants. It's unusual and delicious. \n\nSome days the dishes are hotter than others, it's not exactly health food either, and you better buy some POWERFUL gum or breath mints if you plan to take Muni home from work after eating Hunie as I call it.\n\nMy wife can tell 6 hours later that I had Kung Pao from Hunie and she won't kiss me either....but it's still worth it!\n\n5 stars since it's my fav chinese spot in the city but it ranges from 3-5 stars on a given day. If you are not thrilled the first time, try again because when they are on it's sublime.\n\nBusy on weekdays for lunch, large take out contingent as well.

The kitchen area looks fine-ish but the floors are pretty messy.  For the love of god, don't ever look inside that dumb-waiter that they use to shuttle food upstairs.

After feasting as I just did, I feel like it should be the weekend, or time to go out to a bar or show; not back in front of the computer in the middle of the day, middle of the week, staring at a desk full of papers.  I guess what I'm getting at is this lunch was too good for a Tuesday 11 AM meal.\n\nThe food here packs a punch.  I recommend Henry's shreaded pork, which comes with a mix of spinach and scrambled eggs and a nice combination of spices.  If your taste buds are craving flavor, this dish will not disappoint, and all for under $9.\n\nThe building itself is not the cleanest, fanciest establishment.

They usually serve unauthentic and uninspired \"American Chinese food\" like Orange Chicken (nasty) and General Tsao's Chicken (double nasty).  So when I walked in to this restaurant located in a dark little alleyway and sat down next to tables of (no offense) white folks without a single Chinese customer in sight and given an all-English menu, I  was already very very weary of this place.  \n\nBut much to my surprise, the food is actually pretty good!  Granted it is not 100% authentic Hunan food, I mean where are you going to find that in the Bay area anyway?  You're better off going to NYC or LA, or better yet, China for truly authentic dishes.  But that aside, the flavors are surprisingly good and strong.  I ordered a curry beef with green peppers dish and it was a huuuge portion with a mountain fo sliced beef in this kind of satay curry sauce.  Another spinach, egg, fungus, and pork dish was very good as well.  It was simple but very comforting, not at all like a dish you would serve at a restaurant, but rather reminds me of a home cooked dish my mom used to make.  Maybe because I had very low expectations coming in, but the tasty food was definitely a pleasant surprise.  \n\nThe prices are reasonable and on par with other Chinese restaurants around the area.  Portions are huge!  I suggest coming here with a large group and order tons of dishes to share family style.  That is, after all, the way Chinese food should be eaten :)", "author": "Nancy J."}

Henry's cake is kind of expensive, about $4 for one cake cut into 4 pieces, whereas Satay House gave at least 3 thick cakes worth for about the same price.  \n\nFood-wise, back when I ate meat, it was all about the Marty's Special, but *only* if we were dining in rather than taking out.  For some reason the takeout version is lackluster, but when we dine in, the smoked ham isn't overwhelming with salt, and the veggies are perfectly tender and flavorful.  It comes piping hot, which is how I like all of my hot food.  The dumplings are actually a satisfying, hearty appetizer that didn't leave me wondering if I'd be sated enough with just my entree.  The fried rice is just OK; no real flavor to mention unless it's the smoked ham.\n\nI'm a fan of the dry-sauteed string beans, though.  Those are just the right amount of spicy and not teeming with sodium.  Not soggy, just crispy enough but not raw, either.\n\nWould give another star if the dishes were more consistent when ordering takeout, compared to how good it is when I dine in.

Needless to say, I haven't been back. There are several other locations, and the original started almost 30 years ago. Apparently popular with the lunch crowd for its gigantic portions and cheap prices, the unpretentious and possibly sad no-frills interior aren't really made up for by the food. This is one of those places where they charge you for extra rice and so you have to make do with the measly little bowl they give. Rice is cheap, it should be free. Any decent Asian restaurant will give you more rice without charging for it. Service, needless to say, is not so great either. For these prices, Great China in Berkeley is better.", "author": "Hao L."}

Well people in my office order from them at least twice a week, and sometimes 3 times on a good week.  Definitely try the dumplings, chicken with string beans (or any meat with string beans), kung pao chicken, beef and broccoli, hot and sour beef, marty's special, henry's special, and the Diana meat pie.

Even for an honest, quick lunch place, there are much better places in the area.  We ordered the Henry's Pork, which is basically a spicy pork and cabbage dish.  The pork tasted old and musty and it was greasy. Flavor was basic, it was missing the bean paste which is kind of the signature flavor of the dish, plus WAY too many onions. My friend had beef with green onion (scallions). Horrible quality beef (marinated in tenderizer) and the whole thing was swimming in oil. Not alot of flavor because they used adult scallions rather than tender green onion shoots (what you are supposed to use). The fried rice at the next table looked ok, and some other lady's rice noodles looked decent as well, but nothing amazing.  I must have not ordered well, but at the same time what we got was pretty standard.  I much prefer the little Thai place right next door for the same price.
