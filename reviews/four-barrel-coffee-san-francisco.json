I had a tea and he had a latte. The atmosphere was really trendy; the crowd is cool and the whole experience was fantastic. \n\nBUT WHAT WILL STAND OUT IN MY MIND the most is the experience that I had when I was there. There was a 24-26 yr old red hot Asian chic standing in front of me in line. She was wearing a very short skirt, high heels and a trench coat - not an uncommon look for San Francisco. When she got done paying for her coffee she dropped a 2-1/2\" roll of $100's on the floor in front of me. There must have been at least $5000 in that roll. I picked it up and walked over to her at the coffee station and said, \"Excuse me, Miss, you dropped this...\" She reached out and wrenched those bills out of my hand, stuffed them into her raincoat pocket and bolted out the door!\n\nWe were howling! Not even a \"thank you\". My partner suggested, \"Maybe she's prejudice?\" Who knows? It certainly was something that I won't forget. \n\nI really enjoy this neighborhood (SoMa) and I liked this coffee shop. Trust me, try it - you'll like it.", "author": "J K."}

Why make a place unpleasant to pass off as a quirky hipster hangout?\n\nAlso baristas seem moody and in desperate need of some caffeine to perk up their moods. \n\nThis place could easily become a coffee hub however overall customer experience is not great anymore. So sad to see my favorite coffee shop struggling to achieve what used to be a first-right-time coffee, all the time, everytime. Now the coffee is always a hit or a miss. Either the temperature is not right, or the espresso is pulled too long, or it tastes burnt, or it is way too strong. I don't know - super disappointing to give this place several chances to improve itself. however, there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nOh and what's up with the cookies and pastries - I can almost always spot flies in the food display (note health hazard!). and they cannot even warm up a cookie - which is overtly sweet and all the food seems like it was picked up from the day-old section of a next door bakery. \n\nDon't care about standards anymore four barrel?", "author": "Raj R."}

Trendy coffee shops like Four Barrel Coffee, Blue Bottle, Philz Coffee, Sightglass Coffee, Ritual Coffee Roasters, etc. are all considered a part of the \"Third Wave\" coffee shops (canned coffee like Folgers = first wave & Peet's / Starbucks = second wave). Currently there are two Four Barrel locations in SF and Four Barrel is also in partnership with The Mill (a bakery shop in SF). They offer cupping classes (free - every Saturday & Sunday from 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM), 3-hour espresso + milk preparation classes ($200 per person), and 90-minute better brewing at home classes ($35 per person). I didn't get to try specialty coffees at the \"slow bar\" (pour over style) and I just ordered at the front counter.\n\n***\n\nPecan Muffin ($4.50): Cold muffin, but still tasted pretty good (not overly sweet).\n\nLatte ($5): It had a pretty balanced steamed milk & espresso ratio. The drink didn't taste too diluted and latte art was nice.\n\n***\n\nI personally still prefer Philz Coffee because Four Barrel is missing the \"it\" factor, but Four Barrel serves a good cup of coffee.", "author": "Luke L."}

This unassuming hipster coffeehouse had no signs up top but Siri guided us here! I noticed their cool unorthodox bar seating outside. Gosh the Yelper in me was slipping bc I forgot a pic.\n\nThey had a full window of baked goods. Croissants & donuts looked yummy but we passed this time. You also have the option to purchase their coffee beans by the pound. Their source? From Latin America, East Africa & Indonesia.  Four Barrel included quite a large bar with open bar seating in the back area. \n\nWhen you first enter on your left you can see a separate area of pour over coffee like another trendsetter coffeehouse. There was a line there but somehow we figured out to stand at the longer line down the center.\n\nLuckily someone was leaving so I grabbed their table inside to enjoy our coffee drinks. We were very lucky as it wasn't too packed inside for a weekend Saturday morning. Our barista was quick to making my great tasting plain latte. Their latte art was cute though I've had better back home in Sacramento. \n\nHowever I did appreciate the pretty intricate artwork inside Four Barrel coffee cafe. I thought it was quite beautiful and dressed the walls gorgeously. Just wished no one was in there bc I would have taken way more pictures but I didn't want to be obtrusive or annoying as some photographers can be. It's too bad bc it appears they change their artwork every so often.\n\nWould we come back? Maybe. We did walk over a mile to get here & a mile back to a confirmed appointment. We  know those San Francisco hills were great for exercising! Thanks JC for the artisan coffee recommendation! Maybe next time I will have to try their affogato where they add two scoops of delicious Frozen Kuhsterd ice cream to their delicious coffee. \n\nNow that would be: absolutely. divine. dessert. coffee. heaven. enjoy.", "author": "Karen K."}

The man-bunned, necktie-wearing specialist at the pourover bar appeared deep in conversation with a fellow coffee snob.\n\nBut the coffee itself was blargh.

I searched Yelp and a couple of short blocks later we were in attendance. The coffee shop is a neighborhood favorite it seems because it was busy and full. Luckily, we were able to grab 2 chairs at the back table near the bathroom. Outside of the crowd of people inside, the second thing I noticed upon entrance was the rustic decor. All of the tables and chairs are made of wood. The vibe is calm. Definitely a chill place to relax, study, and meet deadlines. \n\nThe coffee shop is a short walk from the Clarion Murals. \nThe negative is there are no outlets for charging. The main reason for stopping through was to grab a charge for my phone and I was left unable to utilize modern day technology. \n\nWhile people watching, I decided to grab a coffee. I went up to the counter and noticed cookies and instantly changed my plans. I ordered 2 walnut chocolate chip cookies and a hot chocolate (the wind has been blowing). I watched the barista make the hot chocolate and I thought it was pretty interesting. However, my tastebuds thought otherwise. That was the most non chocolate tasting and disgusting hot chocolate. It was pretty in appearance but offensive to my mouth. The hot chocolate costed $4 and the cookies were $1.39 each. \n\nFree water is provided and can be found on the counter inside a metal pitcher. The coffee prices are quite affordable. The space is quiet and has lovely black, abstract art filled walls. There is only one bathroom but it is gender neutral. The back half of the coffee shop has an industrial feel  with a workshop and I am assuming is where they produce and package the items sold in the shop. \n\nThe coffee shop in itself deserves 5 stars. The staff is friendly. The 3 stars is because of the horrible hot chocolate and the fact that I can still remember the taste.", "author": "Latrunda S."}

And one of these addictions is terribly obvious and it's coffee. I told myself that to have less clutter in my life I would make my souvenirs from San Francisco caffeine. I am allowed two bags of coffee. \n\nAnd one of the best coffee spots is Four Barrel. I heard there was some recent events that were negative but now it's back on track with female heads. This makes me very happy. \n\nI jumped around a lot while I was in San Francisco/Oakland. On this day I had to drag a suitcase with me. This made it difficult to read all the descriptions of the bagged coffee. I lean on the nutty and sweet flavor palette. My bag did serve as a placeholder on the long line but I constantly had to run back and move it. After I finally made my selection I got back in line. The treats looked amazing but on this visit I was focusing on coffee. \n\nI asked the lady working where the best place to plug in my phone in was. According to the clerk there are no places to plug in. Ouch! Double ouch when you're traveling. I had no intention in making this place my home office but a little juice goes a long way when you have to walk and need directions.\n\nI ordered my latte anyway. $5 for the latte and an additional $1 for oat milk. I will say that this was more than NY in midtown. When I'm on vacation I have addictions and would pay top dollar for these activities. They did serve my latte in a stunning mug that looked super handmade pottery style. I also enjoyed the fresh flower arrangement while ordering. And in the corner of my eye I noticed the coffee shop's record collection. \n\nI enjoyed the large art pieces against the walls. It is always a treat for me to sit and sip a perfectly made caffeine drink from an actual cup. Vacation life, I could get used to this! \n\nI will add that they have a bathroom. And I appreciate a place that serves coffee and knows that a bathroom is essential. \n\nI love seeing the back area with the giant coffee roaster machines. I'm weird. Something about that machinery creating something I love so much brings me joy. \n\nThe name of my coffee purchase is \"Nicaragua - El Diablo\". Something wicked this way comes! Beware coffee pot!

How does my hair salon and gym offer wifi but Four Barrel doesn't???\n\nI visited Four Barrel because it was on my check list of hipster coffee shops to visit in SF. While I'm not a fan of paying for overpriced coffee, I am a fan of people watching because it's my favorite spectator sport, but while I'm at it I usually like to crank out some work. Came with my laptop in tow only to find that there's no wifi. So I sat there with my tiny cappuccino to soak in the ambiance. \n\nFour Barrel is located on Valencia and occupies a huge piece of real estate. The place is large and like any SF coffee shop, there's plenty of wooden paneling throughout, hipster plants here and there, and plenty of patrons conversing while sipping on caffeine.\n\nI should have just ordered a regular coffee because my cappuccino was lackluster. It lacked depth and body. It was flat in my book and not only that, it took 5ever just to make. They had about 4-5 staff members manning the counter but none of them seemed to be making any drinks. \n\nThe music here is super loud, making holding conversations very difficult. If I wanted to scream to get my point across I would have gone bar hopping to Zeitgeist nearby. \n\nI'll be harping on the fact that I still firmly believe coffee shops should provide wifi access.

I was really looking forward to trying four barrel out, but unfortunately, my experience was slightly underwhelming. Also, it's price skyrockets out of the warehouse and seating is rather limited. \n\nEnvironment:\nThe lighting is dim and the seating is limited. There are only a few tables on the right side of the place. There is a large roaster in the back and a taller table with stool for more seating. The ambiance I felt was more of a cold one. People that came here to order coffee seemed like they were grumpy and in a rush to get somewhere. The place is a mix between a museum and a warehouse. \n\nLatte (4/5): \nThe latte ($5) was pretty tasty, but just ok. The milk was very fresh but heavier on the milk. I did like the frothiness, aromatic, and tangy taste of the coffee though.\n\nService: \nAgain, I feel the baristas were very unwelcoming. When I arrived, the cashier looked unmotivated and tired. I initially first ordered a vanilla latte, but they had run out of vanilla already. I ended up opting for a regular latte, which I didn't mind. The latte was made pretty slowly and people waiting seemed very impatient as well.\n\nLast Thoughts:\nThe latte wasn't bad, just nothing special. Not a fan of the interior or the people working here. Also, the prices are higher here...The utopia in this reputable coffee shop will shatter once you see the prices. The cups aren't that big at all and the wait is quite slow as I only observed one barista making drinks. The verdict? This location is too overpretentious and overpriced for me. There are a lot of places around the SF Bay Area that serve Four Barrel coffee, at much more reasonable prices, so I would suggest hitting up those spots instead.", "author": "Rebecca C."}

This is a no-nonsense coffee and bakery that serves the basics like lattes, capuccinos, etc. without flavored syrups (unless it's a special). The focus is on their coffees and the wonderful quality of their pastries. We got:\n\nLatte (with alternative milk): Smooth, mellow, and inviting. It was a nice and slow pick-me-up that gave me a lazy smile and gave me enough energy to waddle my way to brunch. You can tell that they make their espressos exactly as it should.\n\nEspresso: As I said, you know it's done right. It comes with that almost milky appearance and goes down nice and smooth. Hits your gut and BOOM! I'm awake! They gave us a cup of water, but it's really not needed if you love your coffee.\n\nAlmond cake (GF): A tiny bit on the sweet side, but that's what coffee is for! There's also a very rich, almond flavor that most pastries tend to lack, but this is definitely an almond party in your mouth! The cake was perfectly moist and had just the right texture without being too crumbly or too sticky. Amazing.\n\nBreakfast muffin (GF): Honestly I forgot what this muffin was called, but it was gluten free and had some dried cranberries in it. This was actually my favorite of the two pastries, as it was just the right amount of sweetness (the dried berries give it that extra zing!) Once again, baked to perfection. \n\nAs I said, this is a wonderful place with crazy amazing quality foods. The latte and 2 pastries alone almost came out to $15, so expect to empty the wallet for this one--or is this normal in SF? Either way, I recommend you try it at least once before you run away from the prices.", "author": "Monica L."}

I went with a friend at 11AM on a Tuesday. Parking was a bit hard to find (usual for the most parts in the city) but it wasn't impossible; only took 5 minutes to drive around.  \n\nHUGE HUGE HUGE beautiful space with a backside where they roast and coffee taste the beans. Super interesting and cool.  \n\nCleanliness (5/5): Everything was stocked and clean. I didn't see any dirty cups or plates left on tables so in addition to customers returning the cups, the staff must be on top of cleaning tables. The organization of the space helped to give that really clean feel. The retail walls (every bag of coffee was in perfect line and stocked), the pour over station, the pastry case, the roastery area, and the espresso bar areas were all organized. \n\nCustomer Connection (5/5): cashier/barista greeted us right away. Even though we were still undecided on what to try, he was really welcoming! I walked away after I ordered by my friend and he talked for 1 minute or so, and she said it was a good conversation. We mustve interacted with at least 3 team members and they all were nice, friendly, and thanked us. I felt appreciated! \n\nService/Product Quality (5/5): My friend ordered a macchiato (and the speck and manchego croissant) and I ordered a latte. I like the fact the barista asked if we wanted it for here or togo. Sometimes I want a drink for here but forget to ask - I think that shows great engagement on their end. My friend said she liked her drink and croissant. My latte was good - I could taste the sweet caramelly and smooth notes of the espresso. The for here cups are in ceremic mugs.

I do eat croissants and end up at (Four) Barrel when my usual neighborhood spot is out of them.  \n\nThe last time I went, I asked what kind of croissants they had and chose the one they said was filled with cheese.  What they didn't tell me is that it was also filled with meat.  Not just meat, but prosciutto - ham - pig meat.  You'd think they would mention this given that many people have a \"no pig eating\" policy.  Once I picked out the prosciutto and the prosciutto-tainted cheese, the remainder of the $4.00 croissant (pretty much just crust) was ok.  \n\nThis morning, when my usual spot and my back-up spot were both out of croissants, I ended up at (Four) Barrel.  I went up to the register and the barista (medium blond, septum piercing) was painstaking making some sort of toast. It looked like maybe nut butter and jam and boy was she being though. Spreading the ingredients just so, making sure to get them allllll the way to the crust and evenly across the toast.  Topping it with just a smidge of ground salt.  Carefully placing it on a plate.  Putting the plate on a back counter.  \n\nThe whole endeavor took several minutes and at no time did she even acknowledge my presence.  I made eye contact with the other barista (very short brown/black hair also pierced) who was busy making coffee and she offered nothing.  No \"Good morning,\" no \"We'll be right with you,\" not one word.  As I'm standing there, ready to pay a ridiculous $4.00 for a roll, I start to wonder . . . who is that toast for?  It was for her!

On a regular afternoon finishing up the day from a long day of work. I never thought I would think to say that working in a coffee shop was more productive than my apartment, but with my significant other with our MacBooks is an excellent place to get some work done while always enjoying each others company.\n\nI will have to admit coffee shops on Valencia tend to blend in with the vibe, but this one had a bit of personality that makes it a little different. Walked into to the coffee shop was a location that provided ample seating with two public parklets outside the shop. Greeted inside was some more room and the open space that brings the place to life. In the shop, there was a lot of character that the place provided. There is a nice whiff of coffee. From the coffee bags and coffee apparatus sold. The animal heads on the wall, the vinyl records that were put up are and played through the duration.  Presented is the counter with an open view of the coffee making. Around the place you see was there is some pretty spectacular lighting which makes the place kind of feel like a cabin in the evening. From the local art on the wall to the coffee bean making it is a pretty spectacular place.\n\nGoing up to the counter service is quite good. The menu is straightforward and concise, and the staff is pretty friendly. From ordering the coffee was made on the side while prices seemed to be pretty typical and in-line with expected. \n\nFrom the place, we ended up ordering the Affogato. Mixing espresso and a scoop of vanilla ice cream it reminded me of my visit to Fob Kitchen I wanted to re-visit and try it again. Upon receiving the drink, there was a beautiful aroma from the freshly brewed coffee. It is welcoming and just something that reeled you in. After taking a spoonful of both, it was a kick in the face of flavors in your mouth. The coffee just feels empowering. The presentation is great with softened vanilla sticking out of the cup and coffee drizzling down from the pour from the brew. The cup and the saucer is a fine clay like material which is felt different and quite nice.\n\nThe one caveat I would say here is the lack of Wifi. Understandable for the costs it makes it a little hard to work having to rely upon other services such as a personal hotspot or somebody else's wifi connection. Not a deal breaker but something to consider.\n\nOverall I would say this place is a good place to grab a coffee and do some work. The atmosphere feels great, and the coffee is also good and will give you a jolt. Also, a nice place to just sit down and chat as it is not too loud either. I would rate this place a good 5/5 for what it does best. Coffee.\n\nTips:\n1. Get the Affogato or even any of their coffees it smells fresh and is great\n2. Come here on Saturdays where you can to see get some fresh grinding of coffee\n3. Not a bad place to bring a date\n4. Bring your own Wireless Hotspot of some sort.", "author": "Frank O."}

If I lived in the Mission, i would be here often.", "author": "Diane V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-05-08", "description": "I was excited to try one of SF's most reputable coffee shops, but unfortunately my visit was very underwhelming... And this is coming from a craft-coffee-loving, cool-space-hunting, hipster-wannabe, Instagramming millennial -_-;;\n\nYes the coffee is good, but not mind-blowingly better than all the many choices for artisan coffee around SF. The menu is simple, with coffee and espresso essentials. \n\nBut the utopia in this picture-perfect coffee shop shatters once you see the prices, which skyrocket out the (warehouse) roof. I got a mocha, which was a whopping $5.75, AND tax was not included (it was $6.22 total), AND it was served in a tiny cup that looked like a sad 8oz., AND they pretentiously only offer whole milk or housemade almond/macadamia nut milk (extra $1). So if I had been lactose intolerant, I would have to pay over $7 for a small mocha! \n\nThe mocha itself was quite good, blended with quality Dandelion chocolate for deliciously bitter, dark chocolately notes layered over freshly roasted espresso. It was complex and delectable and all, but overpriced at the end of the day. (Would rather grab some tacos or a bowl of noodles at Yamo in the neighborhood for about the same price)\n\nOther observations:\n- The wait is also quite slow; for all the profit that they make, I only observed one barista making drinks. \n- Note that there is no wifi, so it's not meant for getting work done. (I dislike how customers' coffee shop uses are sacrificed for better turnover and more profit.)\n- The ambiance reminds me a lot of coffee shops in Portland, with a roasting section in the back, wooden stools and tables, and exposed beams. The industrial vibe is photogenic, but not really unique in its own right as it looks imported from Portland.\n- Parking is actually not impossible, at least in the mornings. There are plenty of metered spots, with free parking a short walk away.\n- If you are going to splurge here, be sure to get your camera phones ready. The latte art is noteworthy and they serve drinks in beautiful stoneware, which I believe they rotate (though when I went, the fancy saucer was a hue of beige that ended up looking like a compostable paper plate in pictures).\n\n***Pro tip: There are a lot of places around the SF Bay Area that serve Four Barrel coffee, at much more reasonable prices (e.g. B. patisserie's Four Barrel mocha is only $4.75, 12oz., tax included!)\n\nThe verdict? The original Four Barrel location is a neat spot, but too pretentious and overpriced for my tastes.... it costs 2 arms and 2 legs, as if you've been shot by a 4-barrel pistol.

I asked if they had flavored lattes and was told no (but a previous reviewer said they have Vanilla Lattes?). Anyway, the quiches were cold -- coagulated, chunky bits of cheese cold. We asked if our quiches could be warmed up and were told \"they've already been warmed up.\" We had to take our cold quiches to work to actually eat them :/\n\nI thought my mocha was good, but for whatever reason, there was no hint of mocha/chocolate in the drink. The latte wasn't that impressive either, but the latte art was exquisite.

Four Barrel is the best place in SF, and maybe in the bay area, to get a latte for me. Blue Bottle and Ritual are all fine and good at what they do, but I slightly prefer the taste of Four Barrel.\n\nLet's start with the price. I pay $6 for a latte here. It's normally $5, but it's an extra $1 for almond milk (which they make in-house). I normally don't spend this much on coffee, but will make the exception if I am in the area and feeling especially tired. From what I can tell from the menu, there are no bigger sizes available, which is fine with me. I don't understand getting a large latte, because it will eventually get cold before I can finish it. \n\nService here is a fast and efficient. The baristas are not perky and outgoing like the ones at Philz, but they are nice and mellow. Depending on the time you go, it can get pretty crowded. I personally like sitting in the back and watching the roasting process in action, but it's also not a bad place to people-watch. It seems like all kinds of people come in here! The decor of this place is pleasing to the eyes too.

Lack of made-for-you-right-then coffee and potty area aside, the espresso drinks are still incredible and the almond butter toasts are to die for. \n\nIf you're a Four Barrel fan, I would recommend stopping by this location for a new experience and setting.", "author": "Lori T."}

I don't have any tattoos.  And I don't have anything pierced except for my earlobes.  So, I really didn't fit in, & consequently I didn't feel like I fit in.  \n\nBut I didn't let that bother me.  And the next couple of times I came in I forgot all about it.  I'm here for only one thing, & one thing only.\n\nGood coffee.\n\nI love that there's both soy & almond milk in the house.  I love the record player in the corner.  I love all the wood.\n\nBut, in addition to the line to order, there's always a big wait for your beverage.  The line can go quick, but there's still a long wait for your drink.  \n\nSigh.\n\nThis city is full of fantastic, artisan coffee.  So understandably it's a combination of other contributing factors that will dictate which venue you choose.\n\nIf I'm on this side of Valencia, it's fine.

I am a big coffee drinker so I am always out looking for the best coffee in the city. Walking into the coffee shop, I was shocked by the nicely decorated coffee shop. I enjoyed the big window panels by the door with tables for people to work on. On top of the tables are creative lighting that are made out of very thick ropes. Behind register/coffee area, there is a big machine and very open area. The place have plenty of seating, which is great for groups of people as well as individual that wants to come here and work. If there are no seatings inside, there are plenty of public parklets outside with tables and chairs that you can sit at within the block. The noise level isn't too loud but it isn't silent either. You can here little conversations here and there. The noise level is low enough for you to clearly hear the music playing in the coffee shop. The music is the best part. As vinyl makes a comeback, this is one of the few coffee shop that I have seen so far that uses vinyl, which gives off a nicer sound and helps people like me focus on my work while enjoying the music.\n\nAs I was waiting for my coffee, I asked the barista what kind of machine is behind the register/coffee area. The barista was very nice and told me that the machine was actually how they used to roast their coffee before opening a bigger facility in Oakland, and inform me about events that take place on the weekends at this location. On Saturdays and Sundays of every week, there are coffee roasting events where guest can go to the back and get a viewing. The event is from 12 PM to 1:30 PM. I will be sure to check it out as I really enjoy coffee and learning how good coffee comes about.\n\nComing here, I got the Affogato as I was in the mood for both ice cream and coffee. My first bite into the affogato was amazing. The texture from the ice cream mixed with mini coffee beans gives it a sweet and bitter taste, finished off with the coffee as the sauce. I enjoy my coffee very strong and bitter and the affogato definitely nailed it for me. \n\nAs far as the presentation goes, it would have given a 3 out of 5 since it is similar to all of the other coffee shops in town. However, I gave it a 4 out of 5 because if you drink your coffee there, your coffee comes in ceramic cup and saucer, which makes it very interesting and unique. The cup is round but it is not perfectly round as it have edges that doesn't give it the true round feel.\n\nOverall, I would rate this place a 5 out of 5 for the great atmosphere, good service, amazing coffee and presentation.", "author": "Chenny O."}

The reason I didn't actually drink my tea here is probably going to make my top 5 list of embarrassing moments list. So, I ordered my tea and then proceeded to go add sugar and there I was, in front of this unlabeled jar with an amber-tinted fluid and some spoons inside. I figure, \"oh, this must be simple syrup...so hipster of them!\" I then took a few spoonfuls of this fluid and put it in my tea and walked back to my table. As I was sitting down about to take a sip, I noticed similar jars on this side of the cafe and to my horror, I noticed that people would use a spoon in the empty jar, mix their coffee/cream/sugar, and then discard the spoon in the amber-tinted jar of water. I immediately looked around and realized that I did NOT put simple syrup into my tea, I just put a watered down mixture of probably hundreds of people's coffee into my herbal tea. I awkwardly sat there with my friend who was enjoying his untainted coffee while I caressed my teacup harboring hundreds of licked spoon germs. I'm going to blame my starbucks-limited coffeshop etiquette on this mistake and not the actual cafe (who maybe should label the dirty jar with something, but...I'm probably the only one this happened to [knowingly at least]).", "author": "Wade C."}

The ambiance and positive vibes were quite nice in this spacious coffee shop, as you can see people either working on their laptops peacefully or catching up with a friend, even as late as 7:00PM. However, like many other reviewers have stated, this place is definitely packed despite the large amount of space it offers - almost every table and stool was occupied and we kind of had to  stand around until a spot opened up.\n\nFor a nice coffee fix, my friend and I ordered two lattes together. She ordered a regular latte while I got a Mocha Latte. The latte art was definitely on point at Four Barrel Coffee and we received similar designs with some minor differences. As for the quality of the drinks, they were delicious as well. However, being the sweettooth that I am, I definitely had to add more creamer and sugar in my coffee, hah.

After several visits over the course of a week, plus many visits to other SF shops, I can whole-heartedly agree with the accolades.\n\nGreat coffee is the result of doing three incredibly difficult and skilled trades very well: farming, roasting, and brewing. The staff at Four Barrel leaves nothing to chance: they direct trade with farms around the world to find the best lots, the in-house roasters labor over the coffee with complete quality-control over the product, and the resulting beans are freshly brewed just a few meters away by qualified baristas that actually respect the coffee.\n\nThe result is an exceptional experience: whether an espresso, macchiato, or cortado, every drink is consistently created by the team of baristas.  For a more one-on-one approach, try out the Slow Bar near the entrance to have a conversation about their work and sample some other brew methods.\n\nOverall, put all the silly stereotypes aside and come in with an open mind quenching for great coffee.", "author": "Rob W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-30", "description": "I am a coffee drinker that is willing to go on missions or simply to the Mission District for my drug of choice. I'm in San Francisco regularly, so I've naturally already gone to two of the holy coffee trilogy (Blue Bottle and Sightglass) in San Francisco during other trips. During this last trip, it was time to take on Four Barrel.\n\nWith their wood panels, long benches, and gorgeous chairs, this is a beautiful and surprisingly large coffee shop for San Francisco. When I am in California and going for a bite to eat or grabbing a drink, I often prepare myself to walk into a room the size of a closet; Four Barrel is the opposite of that presumption. It is an expansive caffeinated space. As the coffee did its magic during the time I was there, I saw many things I missed during my first pass. Subtle things like six-foot long black rope chandeliers, giant shelves, and tall stools. Your eyes can play tricks on you here.\n\nOne of the things I didn't miss during the first walk-through was a tasting counter to the right of the door when you first walk in. This counter was run by an animated and focused barista explaining the coffee flavors in elaborate detail, like a sommelier describes wine flavors- of which, I am a giant fan.\n\nPast the expressive barista are rows of expensive little 12 oz. packets of prepared coffee goodness on the wall. For a few Hamiltons, you can leave with a couple of uniform bricks to take to your kitchen in San Francisco or to stuff in your luggage, so your t-shirts can smell like honeycomb and orange liqueur coffee.\n\nPrompted by the friendly service, I found myself ordering quickly and not being intimidated by the wonderful options. Going back a minute, the service was really great. I mean, why wouldn't I get great service? You can just tell I am an awesome person by my order: a coconut donut and a latte. To their credit, they gave me more deserved props for my mid-day donut order than most baristas would. The coconut donut I chose was light and fluffy even with its huge shavings on top and tons of sugar-loaded, decision-making validation.\n\nFrom the front door, you almost have complete line-of-sight to the back. The front area is quite open (I'm sure to help with line management when they get busy) with the back containing more sitting nooks. There is also vinyl on the wall, making the entire vibe more soulful-intelligent-artisan than dirty-snotty-hipster.\n\nOne note about coffee's ultimate counterpart: milk. Here, they only serve almond milk. Not even soy. For me, this is the perfect latte. It is how I have it at home, so I am not biased at all when I praise this decision, but (as milk-in-coffee is a polarizing topic amongst any two people) it is good to know before going to Four Barrel.\n\nSo, you have your detailed donut and your perfect latte, you find a seat and then the entertainment starts. The vintage Probat machine in the back churning coffee beans around is manned by a few lightly adorned, but serious looking guys in the back. One guy is smelling the beans from a siphon in the center of the machine that could be pulled out to test (what I imagine is) the done-ness of the beans. Another guy moves the very expensive coffee around in large Rubbermaid bins. These active coffeeologists are making decisions on a stage more public than I have seen in most coffee shops. They are concentrating celebrities with an audience literally taking notes and photographing their movements.\n\nAfter the show and before I walked out, I caught sight of the \"suck it\" mugs, which both confirmed my love of this place and were exactly what I needed to see after the day I had had.\n\nIs Four Barrel worth the stop? Absolutely. Even if you are not punching holes in the imaginary punch card of the San Francisco Holy Trilogy of Coffee, I hope you have a little time for yourself here at some point.", "author": "Erica G."}

I must say, that the black coffee was naturally at its best all by itself and the taste was simply clean!  You don't need to ruin it by adding sugar, milk or cream to it.

While Ritual Coffee down the street is running on Direct Injection, Four Barrel gets left in the dust.\n\nRecently after a great night spent in the city, we wanted a coffee pick-me-up the next morning. Since Four Barrel has been a longtime bookmark of mine, we decided to go outta our way to check it out. Despite the usual Mission parking situation, we managed to find an open metered space. It wasn't even worth the $1 or so I dropped in the meter.\n\nI attempted to order two soy lattes. Since they don't do soymilk here, we ended up with almond milk instead. While I appreciate the inclusion of almond milk as a dairy alternative, I do not appreciate the exclusion of soymilk. Almond milk just doesn't do it for me in a latte. It overpowers the espresso. The only place that does a decent job of frothing almond milk is Timeless Coffee in Oakland. Even still, I prefer soymilk or even coconut milk.\n\nThe real reason for the lowly star rating? This two shots of espresso with a layer of frothed almond milk just wasn't very good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/four-barrel-coffee-san-francisco?select=CJ-uIyDc_j2QoL6j15MQZg#YH_OiPFy2wYswt857CHDyA I could have easily downed this drink in one gulp, pinky up 'n everythang. Also for the price, you best not upcharge me on the almond milk. It's an extra fiddy cents to add a dollop of foam to my espresso?\n\nPerhaps they got my order wrong and gave us something else since I don't see how this size latte would put a dent in volume of their to go cups. However the guy working the machine said \"your other almond milk latte will be right up\" as I walked over to grab the first.\n\nTheir only redeeming quality? They have a pretty cool name and an awesome looking, quite large storefront. Although with the spaciousness, they could stand to add a few seats given the amount of hipsters standing in line. The parklet outside is a nice touch as well. That's about it.\n\nWith no Vegan pastries in sight, there's very little that would encourage a repeat visit except for their pour over coffee. Since I can get much better at Ritual or Philz, Four Barrel is relegated to the junkyard, the same way most of the vehicles that were outfitted with carburetors are now today.\n\nMy babygirl had pretty much the same impression as myself.

I picked up the espresso, affogato, and a slow pour over. I also picked up a couple of those wrapped chocolate taffy things which were excellent and went really well with my espresso.\n \nThe affogato is made with buffalo milk (wtf??? crazy) which is why I wanted to try it. The ice cream of the affogato felt creamier than any affogato ice cream I've had which was a plus. The espresso tasted like a couple of other espressos I've had before, but it's not bad.

However, I'm leaving this place three stars because of the TERRIBLE utilisation of space in this store. \n\nUpon entering, you approach a large, empty space that services two coffee brewing methods -- a slower brew off to the left, and your typical ready-to-go coffee in front. Squeezed on the right side are some pitiful seating options, along with bar-type seating in the back. But why the hell is there so much open space? You can see the back of the store, which is the same size as the occupied storefront, and it looks empty. Not a lot of items are even stored there, and a lot of space could be reclaimed for extra seating. The front area could also service more customer seating. The outdoor area is nice, but I am just astonished at how wasteful and thoughtless a space could be, especially in crowded, expensive, and environmentally-minded practicality of San Francisco.", "author": "Jenny N."}

The pour over Barista is \"usually\" friendly and a pour over lover. I always enjoy having a Barista to talk shop with. Unfortunately this wasn't the case in my last visit; can't win them all. \n\nI digress, I enjoy the outside patio facing the street and the bar in rear that gives you a view of how they roast the beans and then bag them.

I love their lattes, and was in the mood to try their mocha so i did.\n\nService was friendly as usual.\n\nI noticed the barista seemed to be having some trouble mixing the chocolate with the espresso as I saw him attempting to stir it in my cup. He added a splash of the steamed almond milk to help the chocolate dissolve, and gave it another stir. Seeming satisfied, he topped off my drink and gave it to me. \n\nIt was not very hot, which I don't mind because I can drink it without waiting for it too cool. I quickly noticed the drink seemed gritty and \"pulpy\" I got home a couple of minutes later and opened the cup to investigate, and found it swirling with a ton of undissolved chocolate, i gave it a ferocious stirring trying to settle the mess. I sipped it a bit longer, then set it aside since it wasn't very enjoyable. After a while i reheated it and gave it some more ferocious stirring in hopes of getting it mixed properly, but to no avail. Sat around for a few minutes, wringing my hands and debating whether or not I would be playing the role of That Asshole Who Came To Complain About Her Drink. After wringing my hands about it, and anticipating the Difficult Customer treatment I decided $5.50 was too much of my poor person money to spend on something that was bound to go down the sink drain.\n\nSo I went back to Four Barrel.\n\nI went back to Four Barrel and never in my life have I been spoken to so condescendingly as I was just now.

The interior of the shop is quite interesting (as most roasteries are nowadays) and out front they have a cool seating area with stools and high bars right next to the street. Not only that but it's right down the street from Munroe Motors, a sweet motorcycle shop that's fun to drink a coffee while walking around.\n\nMy only gripes are the layout. There isn't much seating and the really annoying thing is the separation of the pour-over bar and customer line from the \"everything else\" counter and customer line. It creates for crowding and confusion by the entrance. The pour-over bar also has different hours than the regular counter. Why, Four Barrel, why?", "author": "Patrick S."}

Here's why:\n\n1.  They don't have artificial sweeteners for my coffee.  Sure, I know what you're thinking:  Sugar is cool again, because, like, you know, it's totally naaaatural and stuff.  Plus, those artificial sweeteners will give you brain lesions, m'kay?  Nope, sorry.  Sugar gives me migraines and the artificial sweetener I use, Splenda causes neither brain bleeds nor headaches por moi...so, seriously, Four Barrel?  Cut the snob routine and just put out a few packets of the yellow stuff for those of us who want it, m'kay?\n\n2.  There is a SERIOUS hipster vibe here.  This is firmly established by the disaffected baristas who work here, and who will be just barely polite, but never friendly, and certainly never offer anything resembling a look of approval.\n\n3.  This coffee shop does not have Wi-Fi.  Yup, I know what you're thinking:  But, Amy, how can a super-cool coffee shop not offer such a fundamental item as complimentary Wi-Fi to their guests??  After all, even Starbucks, Peets, and even McDonalds give that to their patrons!  Nope, sorry, this place is a hipster up-scale coffee shop.  They're too good for people sitting there on their laptops.  \n\nIn fact, they really don't want you to stick around in general.  Nothing about the place feels warm or inviting, from those cold cement floors to the vacuous 1/2 mile trek from the front door to the register...you could even host an ironic square dancing party with this much space!  But it most certainly doesn't feel like a place you'd want to hunker down with a cup of joe, relax, and hang out for a while.\n\nSo, for now, 4-stars for the delicious Iced Lattes I get here.  That 5th star will remain my hostage until Four Barrel's Hipster Overlords hear my plea and put out a few lousy packets of Splenda for the rest of us plebes.  I have no hope that they will actually institute free Wi-Fi...after all, isn't that what the kids are using their cell phones for these days?!", "author": "Amy L."}

This place has a nice setup from the outdoor street side patio all the way to the inside spacious seating area. I was really surprised at how big this place is, given that this is San Francisco after all and other coffee shops would not be half this size. Hard to imagine this place would ever be short on seats, so good for groups and hanging out, yes. Unfortunately, if you plan on being productive on the computer, this place does not offer any wifi. \n\nThe entrance is a bit confusing initially when you walk in, first you see the pour over station to your left and then a register in the front serving the usual coffee's, latte's and cappuccino's etc. Since the coffee was free, I decided to try a few things from both sides. I tried an ice coffee black that was a bit weak in flavor, so I tried to save it by adding some sugar and throwing in almond milk that was readily available at the counter. Unfortunately, not much I could do to save it since I didn't want a heavy dose of sugar in my cup. I then tried a cup of cappuccino which I thoroughly enjoyed and if I do another visit, might be something I'd order again.\n\nAt the pour over station, I asked for a roast that was a bit earthy and nutty, the barista was really friendly and helpful and suggested a particular roast that was specific to my request. The coffee itself was also weak in flavor, can't help but say I was disappointed that a carefully crafted pour over didn't meet my expectation. The thing I noticed from all three drinks was their coffee was not bitter and low on acidity, which was a good thing, but as far as flavor goes it didn't really make me crave more at the end of my visit. As far as strength goes, you would think after having 3 different tastings I would be jacked up on caffeine the rest of the day, but not an ounce of jitter hit me at all. I was glad I got the opportunity to try a new coffee spot and to consider something other than my usual cup of Philz, but I won't be switching blends anytime soon.", "author": "Limuel G."}

I went to Four Barrel this past December and ever since I've been torn apart whether or not I want to write a review for this place. The reason for this is because coffee is such a subjective topic to be giving opinions on, so many people love coffee and there are so many varieties of coffee. Me personally, I'm more of a sweet-tooth coffee person. I also enjoy French-press Vietnamese style iced coffees. If you're like me, please do not waste your money here, because you will not enjoy it. Four Barrel is more for the refined coffee taster, the person who loves strong bitter coffee that's going to kick you in the face really hard. But hey, everyone is allowed to love whatever coffee they want, and this place just doesn't have the coffee for me. WITH THAT SAID, I am not basing my 3 stars on their coffee, because that would be completely unfair for their company. \n\nRather, I am basing my 3 stars off of the entire experience I received at Four Barrel, I'm talking service now. Let's be honest, the service really wasn't that great. And for a highly reviewed place like this I kind of expected a lot better. The vibe that you get from the workers here would be pretentious, you kind of get that vibe from the customers as well but the ones I talked to were all very nice. I wish I could say the same for the workers. I wanted to buy a package of coffee for my mom, and since I'm not some type of coffee wizard I felt the need to ask someone who worked there. The person I asked wasn't very nice about it and got up in my face, started asking me questions about coffee that I had no idea how to answer. When I was curious and asked more questions, it only seemed to upset the young man, it almost looked like he was in pain because I didn't look like I trusted his judgement. \n\nI also ordered a \"chocolate-claw\" pastry and they didn't even offer to heat it up for me. I would've asked, but wow, didn't really feel welcome to ask any more questions. Overall it was an okay experience, kind of seems like a place the college-version of Ted Mosby would love hanging out in. Super hipster if you're into that type of stuff.", "author": "Kyle L."}

Your best bet is trying out the more unique brews from the drip coffee station. The main barista station serves up OK coffee that's more smooth than bold. That having been said, service is always cheerful, engaging, and helpful. \n\nThe hipster atmosphere is certainly the big draw to this place, and the vibe is loud and social. The lack of power outlets and wi-fi (hint: you can try stealing free, unsecure wi-fi from the nearby public housing project) underscores the fact that this isn't a place to sit by yourself staring at a laptop screen.

The action has spilled outside, with their beautiful parklet out front (complete with bike racks), and even to the alleyway out back, if their infamous \"mucho smoocho\" sign on the back door is any indication.\n\nWhile I prefer the coffee at Ritual and Blue Bottle, I'm all for more lively, social coffeehouses, and the West Bay is blessed to have so many of these places - especially on the same street.", "author": "Vincent L."}

I used to drink Starbucks, but ever since I've discovered \"third wave coffee\" (Blue Bottle, Four  Barrel, Intelligentsia, etc), I can no longer bring myself to drink Starbucks' bitter and horrible tasting coffee. You see I like to drink my coffee black and Four Barrel's coffee, drip or espresso, can be enjoyed in its unadulterated state.  Four Barrel indeed is one of the best coffee roasters in San Francisco. \n\nI've only been to their cafe on Valencia. Have you been there? The little parklet in front of their cafe is so cool--a great place to soak in the sun while you're enjoying your coffee. Inside, it is a little dark with all that wood, but there is a lot of space for sitting and milling around, and the high ceiling helps. \n\nI've taken a \"Better Brewing at Home Class\" at their Valencia cafe. If you're serious about your coffee and want to learn how to brew it and learn about the differences in taste for each brewing method, take this class. It's an hour and a half class and their trainer will demonstrate each brewing process that you can do at home. There must have been at least 8 types that he showed us. He showed us what the grind size looks like for each brewing method because that matters and let us taste the coffee from each brewing method. Mind you this was at 5 pm, so you will come out of that class all buzzed with caffeine. Don't think I slept early that night, but it was all worth it! Out of all the brewing methods, my favorites ended up being the Chemex, V60 and the Aeropress.   The V60 produced the best cup but it is also the trickiest one.  The Chemex method is what I ended up adopting for its ease and great results.\n\nI follow Four Barrel on IG and I swear they post the coolest events there.  We went to their Cocktail + Coffee party at Trou Normand.  That was a blast! For $30, we had a number of regular cocktails and cocktails with cold and hot brew coffee.

We also paired the cheeses with Four Barrel's cold brew and a couple of their hot brew coffees. I thought the cold brew went well the cheeses. Oh, and did I mention this cheese event was free? Amazing. \n\nPeople who are passionate about what they do create great products and Four Barrel is passionate about coffee.  If you want to make better coffee at home, sign up for their class.

Pour overs are made perfectly, so are cappuccinos or really ... any coffee ordered.  We stop in during every SF visit to thoroughly enjoy the coffee and to take advantage of taking home some of our favorites.  Since I'm a decaf drinker, the decaf expresso blend is a regular choice that has elements of rhubarb and red plum.  Another new favorite is the decaf los chelazos that reflects milk chocolate dipped almonds and apricot marmalade.

My bf ordered a regular coffee and you cannot go wrong with that either. \n\nLocation: Lucky for me, they're a short walk from my bf's apartment.

Disclaimer: I am not a hipster, nor am I much of a coffee drinker. \n\nCoffee: I liked the iced mocha ($5), particularly the coffee bits at the bottom of the cup. The coffee did seem a bit more acidic and sour than I am used to; it's a much more brass taste. \n\nAmbiance: Hipster with a pinch of normcore. Very industrial interiors with concrete flooring and exposed ceilings. My favorite part was the unique array of taxidermy along the wall. Outside has cool, urban seating as well as space-saving bicycle parking.", "author": "Phoebe C."}

Good God, it makes any chain coffee shop you know look like sloppy seconds compared to this wondrous land of flaky morning treats. \n\nIt's very difficult to choose just one thing ot get, so if you're lucky, you'll come in a hungry group, or if you aren't lucky, you'll just get a few \"for later\". What I did get to try were the:\n\nBLACKBERRY PISTACHIO CROISSANT. Umm...wow. I've never had that combination of flavors in a croissant before, and it completely blew me away. The pistachio wasn't too heavy or thick, and the blackberry was a nice sweet swirl in the perfectly flaky breakfast that I had. It did get a little sweet as I continued eating it, so milk (or I guess coffee) would be a welcome companion to this.\n\nORANGE-CHOCOLATE KOUGIN-AMANN. I've never tried one until yesterday, and I clearly see what I have been missing out on. It's a complete dessert pastry, in my opinion, very sweet and buttery, but outstanding. The giant dollop of melted chocolatey ganache in the middle was incredible, and the whole thing was just a pleasure to have even a few bites of.\n\nCHOCOLATE SPICE DONUT. My friend, who raves about their donuts, walked away with this bad boy, and while I didn't try much, it's delicious - thick, not overly sweet, and with a nice bite to it.\n\nI could care less about their drinks, but be sure to try out their pastries, lovingly nestled together in their display case at the main counter!", "author": "Claire S."}

Not a single table was unoccupied, so I made a quick decision to have my beverage to-go. I scoped out their menu, which is very straightforward. It features the usual suspects: coffee, Americano, macchiato, cappuccino, latte, mocha, hot chocolate, iced coffee... that's about it. All drinks come in one size, so no need to specify how big you want it. \n\nThey have a record player hooked up to speakers, filling the patron's ears with blissful sounds. They have an impressive record collection directly above. I resisted the urge to hop the counter and shuffle through their LPs, even though the idea was mighty tempting. The barista danced around as he pulled what appeared to be a perfect espresso shot. \n\nAfter a few minutes, the cup was placed in front of me. Be still, my heart! \n\nI eagerly took a sip of my drink, and I was transported to a land of beauty. Imagine Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. However, instead of a chocolate river, there would be a river of fragrant, perfectly brewed coffee. I mentally frolicked through imaginary green fields as Gene Wilder serenaded me.

When life deals you a bad hand and you're allergic to alcohol, sometimes the comforting or enjoyable drink is coffee.  In search of the BEST coffee and latte became our mission.  Who would have guessed there are so many out there?  The usual coffee chain stores (Starbucks and Peets) have been out shined.\n\nAs any great financial advisor would tell you.  The best way to save money is to cut out buying coffee and start making it at home.  Ya ya ya...we've all heard it, but we don't listen.  Our minds still tells us we need to go to a caf\u00e9, better yet I think our lazy A$$ is the one that speaks for us.\n\nWhen Mr. BYS said there is a coffee shop he wanted to try out, I was excited.  Driving out of our way to get to this caf\u00e9 was a waste of time and gas.  We were lucky enough to get a parking two doors down from the caf\u00e9.  As we entered it was packed the line was almost out the door.  There were plenty of seats inside but was taken by hoarders laying out their newspapers and although they had no Wi-Fi connection here.  It didn't stop the ones who pulled out their laptops.  411 peeps, if it's communal seating, don't be an A$$ and take up the entire table.  \n\nOnce I found us a seat and Mr. BYS brought our lattes.  I looked at it and said...\"this is a latte\"? He even questioned it too.  Why were we puzzled...because the size of the cup was like a tea cup but smaller.  \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/four-barrel-coffee-san-francisco?select=GctXrJbV0geOK-ebfUxwxQ#GctXrJbV0geOK-ebfUxwxQ\n\nSo, a caf\u00e9 latte is 60ml Espresso, 175-300 ml Steamed Milk & 2ml of Milk Foam that is why it's called a Latte \"MILK COFFEE\"....what I got was similar to a Cappuccino which is 60ml Espresso, 60ml steamed milk & 60ml Foamed Milk.  If we have to pay an extra 50cents for Almond milk (since they don't carry soy) than give me the amount I paid for.  Don't short change me and give it to me in a \"foam version\".

At same time, it's creepy drinking my coffee as I stare at the numerous dead animal heads plastered against the walls.\n\nIS THIS LOCATION GOOD FOR \"MEET UP DATE PLACE\"?\nI would say NO!!

Based on coffee, service, and decor.\nCoffee- This one is tough. Ritual serves more of a medium roast but packs a lot aromas. Four Barrel serves a bolder coffee that fits me more but only serves drinks using whole milk or soy. Ritual has the edge just because I am use to 2% or fat free lattes but that doesn't mean I won't go in. It just means I got to break the rules.\nService- Four Barrel has a more friendly service and the staff seems more happier. Two baristas showcasing their talents. I love how they call your name then pour the milk into the espresso. 5 seconds later, edible artwork.\nDecor- Both places have an open space but Four Barrel has the edge because their roaster is on display and does both tables and coffee bar.\n\nFour Barrel is Valencia Street BEST!", "author": "Kien M."}

Is that not serious-coffee-nerd enough? I pondered this, and then thought, hey, if Four Barrel has it on the menu, it can't be THAT douchey. So anyways- I had been brunching it up in the Mission, which means imbibing on mimosas, and needed a little pick me up. I walked in Four Barrel and uncharacteristically ordered an iced mocha. I usually avoid mochas because the chain establishments that I frequent make them SO sweet it grosses me out. So why did I order one? I dunno. I wasn't in my normal frame of mind (thanks a lot Dr. Teeth!). So I got an iced mocha and a chocolate chip cookie, because obviously, I'm on a diet, and headed outside to stare at stuff. \n\nI took a sip of that iced mocha and wanted to ask the stranger next to me if he wanted a sip, because it was so f***ing good! Perfection. I have only had one mocha in my life that I ever liked, and it was in London. Four Barrel, you make snobby old London a distant memory for me. I used to tell people that the best part of my London trip were the mochas I knocked back everyday. Now I don't need to go back to London, because 4B made the most delicious mocha in the universe. It wasn't sweet. It tasted of chocolate but wasn't syrupy and cavity inducing. It was just perfect. The great taste of their coffee wasn't hidden, you could taste it dancing side my side with the delicious chocolate flavor. \n\nReaders, if  you have decided you hate mochas because they are overly sweet, but you like chocolate, go to Four Barrel and try theirs.

I'm a total noob with coffee and normally drink caramel lattes from Starbucks... but Four Barrel was such an excellent introduction to coffee. Mmm. \n\nFirst thing I noticed when coming into the place was how spacious it is. Holy crap. There are very few places I see in SF with that much empty space--which was much needed given how quickly the line reformed every minute! The decor was very hipster as everything in SF tends to be. They had some lovely hipster bike stands outside and outdoor seating.\n\nI ordered a latte and my friend ordered an espresso. As someone who has only had caramel lattes and a plain latte, the Four Barrel latte was such a pleasant surprise. I tend to lean toward sweeter flavored drinks, but the ratio of Coffee to milk in the latte was just perfect. Too perfect. The coffee flavor was plenty prevalent but the normal bitterness was balanced out with the milk. Perfection. Mr. Coffee Aficionado also raved about the smoothness of his espresso.\n\nCan we also please talk about the price here? They charge prices that are pretty much the same (if not cheaper) than places like Starbucks but clearly offer supreme quality drinks.

They offer one coffee that comes from a pot (even fewer than Starbucks), and \"other coffee drinks\". I would understand if they listed the hours for their slow pour bar online, but they don't, so there was no way to know unless I called in advance to make sure a craft coffee shop can do a pour over.

When I bring guests from out of town I take them to two places: Ritual and 4Barrel.\n\nHere's why:\nRitual has a extremely clean taste on their espressos.  Even the blends that are bright and complex, still come out clean.  Clean is good!  It's the mark of a barista that knows what they are doing.  though I must admit I'm not a fan of the Sweet-tooth sometimes.  That's more on the beans than the actual barista though.\nthen there's 4Barrel.  I'd say just as clean on the after taste as Ritual but I generally love all their Friendos.\n\n4Barrel drinks across the board are tart when infused with fruits but never sour.  The aroma is always heavenly.  The Initial taste is bold, bright and the right amount of bitter.  The after-taste varies but is consistently pleasant. \n\nthe baristas are super awesome.  just good, intelligent people who know their roasting-trade.\n\nI know taste is subjective, but 100% of the people I've brought here agree that this is a top notch roaster in the City.

Only Four Barrel, baby. From the moment I wake up I look forward to my trips to Four Barrel, where the smiling hipsters behind the counter fill my cup with their rich, strongly caffeinated delicousness and fuel my power walk through the ghetto and to my office. Sometimes when I'm feeling really decadent I'll indulge in one of their banana chocolate chip scones, and figure I'll just pump my legs that much harder to burn the calories off. \n\nThe coffee's pretty reasonably priced, though the beans and the pastries are pretty pricey. It's still a great gift idea though for the coffee lovers in your life - I picked up a few bags for Christmas and they were (for the most part) a hit. Beware - the beans range from $16-20... quite a pretty penny!\n\nOne day I'll stop by when I'm not in a rush to get to work and enjoy their nice outdoor or indoor seating.

Having walked by here a few times when visiting my sister, I have always been tempted to stop by for a drink. After hearing my sister rave for weeks about her favorite drink from here, the almond milk latte, I decided I just had to try it this past week. \n\nThe almond milk latte was everything she said it would be and more. Typically almond lattes I've had, like at Peet's, always leave a sort of odd taste in my mouth. I was worried that the almond milk would overpower this drink but I was wrong. The drink was perfect. It was smooth, creamy and perfectly made! I would have drank two if there was an option to get a bigger size mmm. I can't wait to go back and try other drinks! \n\nThe ambiance is also really nice! Sort of dim lighting, lots of open space and some small/big tables for seating. Interesting crowds and cool baristas! \n\nOther things:\n+Be prepared to spend more than your usual Starbucks/Peets bill here (almond milk latte was $4.50....$4 for the latte, 50 cents for the almond milk) \n+No tea options on the menu, only coffee/espresso based drinks\n+They have a few snacks they offer but they were wiped out when I came around 5:30 on a Thursday evening\n+No wifi\n+If you get plain coffee, you get the option of adding soy milk, almond milk, regular milk or creamer to your cup for no extra charge! Might be a better option than getting an almond based espresso drink if you're watching your wallet. \n+This is not a grab n go kind of coffee stop--when I went I think it took about 7-8 minutes before my drink was ready which is drastically more than typical coffee shops--so don't stop here if you're in a rush!

The baristas are enclosed within this glass/wood box where you can walk around it and watch them do their thing. Since I hadn't read anything about Four Barrel before, I wasn't quite sure what to order. So when I got up to the register, I just got an iced coffee and an apple coffee cake. I feel like I should also note that the cashier was also just casually sipping on a latte, hahaa. \n\nAnyways, the iced coffee - bleh :| I personally did not like it at all. To the point where I was almost about to throw it away because that's how much I did not like it! It was just really bitter and left a really bitter aftertaste. But I didn't throw it away, simply because I was just sooo thirsty from walking around all day. However, the apple coffee cake was really yummy! There were bits of apple in it and I could taste cinnamon in there. mmm.

So when I was looking to escape for a little bit and hunker down at a cafe to do some work, I was looking forward to Four Barrel.  I happened to come at a good time, as today is the day after Xmas, and everyone is in the Powell/SF Shopping Centre area returning gifts they didn't really want/need. \n\nThe line moved very quickly and I ordered a latte.  I asked the cashier if there was a password for wifi, and she informed me that they didn't have it.  DOH!  It seems they don't really want anyone camping, as there aren't any electrical outlets available to patrons, as well.  I get it, but I still needed a little escape, and was a bit bummed that Four Barrel couldn't provide that to me.\n\nI sat at a little table started to people watch and was content with this for awhile.

Despite their annoying granola hipster vibe, the coffee is seriously good and the baristas are approachable and respectful.\n\nBlue Bottle, Ritual, Sightglass, Philz (arguably), and Fourbarrel are the pioneers of Third Wave coffee and they make Starbucks/Peets look like your grandma's Folgers. Their coffee is high quality, less burnt-to-a-crisp, and generally sits well with me. The only downside attributable to these places is that the baristas treat their customers with contempt and disrespect.\n\nLuckily, I've found that Fourbarrel's staff is fairly down-to-earth and friendlier than the others. Amazingly, they're still able to make a great espresso; proving that rudeness isn't necessarily the secret ingredient of good espresso.\n\nPerhaps the biggest downside here is that their coffee is $5 a cup--which seems ludicrously over-priced. But given the average price of Third Wave coffee, that *is* the going rate so you can't fault them for it.

Between Ritual, Blue Bottle, Philz, De la Paz, Sightglass, Thanksgiving, etc... there's really no good excuse to ever get caught sipping on bland Aramark office swill ever again. While it comes as no surprise whatsoever, you can throw Four Barrel right in the mix of some of the best beans in the city, and possibly even the entire West Coast as well. Simply put, this stuff is heavenly.\n\nAside from the piquant roasts and spot on espresso drinks, you're not likely to find a cooler looking space for caffeine intake anywhere else in town. I'm usually not the type to lounge in a coffee shop for any longer than it takes for me to order and await my drip, but the minimalist, hip decor calls to me like the Sirens of Homer's Odyssey, begging for an extended romp in their massive warehouse along Valencia. Very open and airy, polished concrete flooring, enough seating to accommodate a hefty handful of the Mission's finest, an appreciation for analog with an old school turntable and stacks of records behind the coffee bar, and those contemporary rope lights that make me want to run to the nearest Home Depot to try and recreate the entwined burlap look myself.

I love blue bottle because I think it helped kick off the local and independent coffee scene in the bay area, but the coffee at four barrel is in my opinion, better.  And I'm talking black coffee...most lattes or cappuccinos can taste great with whole milk but if you take your coffee black, it's all about four barrel.\n\nBig space, great light, no wi-fi (encourage community and conversation they say).   Large communal tables, single bar seats, a few tables and some outdoor seating--seems like the perfect combo of space.  It's a great location to meet up with a friend or to ponder about life if you get a window bar seat looking out in the city. \n\nThey have a decent looking selection of pastries (which the cashier said came from different bakeries, one of which included B patisserie--pretty awesome).\n\nGot some coffee beans which cost $17.50 for a small little bag.

Not designed for a quiet date or a pram.\nAs far as the pastries are concerned they are perhaps smaller than the average size but are packed with flavour, intuitive in design and baked to a high standard.\nThe almond & Apple brioche proved a credible purchase justified by its soft and chewy texture partnered with just enough fruit on top. Second up was the bacon and cheese scone (biscuit). I'll be frank: not admired by my taste palette. Was dry and bland and didn't really shout out at me l, contrary to everything else in the store (including the four dead animal wall heads with roses stuck in their snouts). \nOverall, Sunday afternoon coffee catch up?

Don't spend all of your precious time waiting for a drink that will never come if you have yet to order.  Ask questions - \"Are you in line?\" \"no\" and move on to the front.\n\nThe staff, although well trained seem to be as clueless as the customer base with a lackadaisical approach to serving your coffee or taking your order.  I give it FOUR stars for it's hipster approach to keeping with the current city trend in beans.\n\nOne word... Trendy.", "author": "Kevin J."}

I spoke Arabic with a businessman from Egypt, talked politics with a young man from Maine, and talked to myself (of course no one cares in San Francisco). Men and women of all ages attend this place comfortably. \n\nThe Atmosphere:\nFriendly.Not a hipster only coffee house.  Take a friend to chat, or come alone and enjoy people-watching. There is always a wide-variety of people from all types of backgrounds (even religious!) who are probably willing to talk. Not the best place to study (who would want to with such good coffee!), but some people do read and study here. \n\nThe Experience:\nThere is no better place in the Bay area. If you have time, try the pour over station and order some great coffee. Once you order, the barista will let you smell the freshly ground beans. They have pour-over coffee down to a science. The brew always fills the cup up to the top, and always has extraordinary flavor. Typically there are 5 or 6 fresh roasts you can order, or you can get into the espresso line and try a latte or cappuccino, though macchiato is my favorite!\n\nMy advice: Make this your first coffee stop if you are new to the Bay area, or if you are visiting.

Four Barrel is one of the best coffee shops and coffee roasters in California, and the shop does not disappoint. Outdoor seats and tables are placed on the sidewalk for those sunny SF summer afternoons, and the inside of the shop exudes a hipster vibe with its simple wood themed tables, chairs, and ceiling. The decor is simple with some drawings along the wall and a couple animal heads along the other. Besides the typical latte, coffee, etc., Four Barrel also offers a slow roast bar, where a barista makes pourovers with different coffee beans from around the world. Sipping on my Ethiopian pourover, I was able to see the bean roasting equipment in the back, which is rare for a coffee shop. After seeing that, I knew Four Barrel is serious about its coffee.

FK asked me personally to compare their 'kuhsterd' to something I've before and not to boast their egos but it's one of a kind. The custard remains in the cup the moment you flip it over (product quality and integrity), the white chocolate is bold and mellows out with the saikyo miso as a finish. The closest thing I can do a compere and contrast would be Yogurtland's White Chocolate flavor but texturally and flavor balance it was a bit too sweet for me.\n\nDespite the long lines, the customer service was excellent seeing as one of the workers followed up with me the day before when I inquired about said highlighted flavor.\n\nIf you can overlook the long line (rainy Friday late morning-afternoon), the benefits outweigh the cons seeing you can try confectionaries from: b patisserie and dynamo donuts, this is a must stop for any coffee (or food lover). 3.5 but rounded up to 4 for quality in products and customer service.

I don't live in San Francisco anymore but frequently visit my friends and family (as I live an hour away now) and often suggest we meet at Four Barrel.  Yesterday was one of those days.  Met my aunt at Four Barrel.  Was not having a great day.  Was very excited to drink a cup of their delicious coffee and feel better...\nThen I saw the sign on the counter. \"SOY IT AIN'T SO\".  I've been vegan for six years.  This sign stated (I took a picture so I could directly quote it): \"After 4+ years of offering \"soy drink\" as a dairy alternative for all you...cow-hating hippies, we here at Four Barrel have recently decided that life is just too short to drink soymilk.\"\n...wow.  The sign goes on to say that they are now offering almond milk in an effort to make our coffee \"less...legumey\".  \nI don't eat much soy, but I do love soy latt\u00e9s.  The problem with almond milk is that it often tastes like water.  I tried not to think too much about how incredibly offensive this sign was (I'm sure they're trying to be funny, but calling me a cow-hating hippie is not a great way to win me over to your new non-dairy offering) and went ahead and ordered an almond milk latt\u00e9.  \nIt was awful.  It tasted like black coffee with foamy water.  I would have much rather just had black coffee.  Why have the almond milk if it is tasteless?  I'm sure, on its own, this almond milk might taste great, but paired with the delicious coffee, any taste it had is lost.  So now, not only had their offensive sign given me a stomach ache, but I was stuck drinking this truly awful beverage.\nNow, if they had approached it differently -- put a sign up saying \"In an effort to support small farms and avoid supporting monoculture, we now offer almond milk instead of soy\" or something...this whole experience would probably have gone differently.  I would still have thought my latt\u00e9 was awful, but at least I wouldn't have had the figurative bad taste in my mouth.  Four Barrel made it clear that they would rather not have vegan customers, and I'm ready to take the hint and never come back.  It does make me sad, though, because like I said before, I've loved this place for years.  \nLife is too short to drink soymilk?\nNo.  Life is too short to put up with condescending, snobby hipsters when all you want is a delicious cup of coffee.

In my world that typically means something with chocolate. I really wanted a doughnut but with all the doughnut shops closed for the night, I decided to settle for a mocha. Prior to my visit, I had never heard of Four Barrel, but I trusted the other reviews on Yelp and made my way inside. It was cold, barren, and the seating uncomfortable, not like your typical cozy cafe.\n\nWhile I was waiting for the barista to return to the counter, I noticed something off about Four Barrel, something you really wouldn't expect to see in a coffee shop. Much to my surprise and utter disgust, they had decorated one of their walls with real taxidermy hog heads mounted on plaques like a safari hunter's trophy-room, for  what reason I don't know. Regardless, already having walked several blocks to get the coffee, I decided to order anyway. I ordered my small mocha, which is very common and easy to make, and waited with my friends. After an unreasonably long wait, my drink was finally announced. It was very hot, much hotter than any other coffee I've ever ordered. When it finally cooled down, I was already heading for the BART.\n\nI took a sip and instantly noticed that something was off. It tasted like chemicals and was very waxy. Taking a few more sips, I now noticed just how horrible it was. I thought for a second, maybe this is some special type of coffee that tastes bitter. Nope, when I opened up the lid I saw little floating pieces of melted wax and just to make sure I pulled some out with my finger. Wow. The coffee tasted horrible and I was drinking melted wax from the lining of the togo coffee cup. $4.25 down the drain... literally. How displeasing...

I was hanging out with an acquaintance, and, with only a very short list to choose from, I got a regular latte, which led to this whole phase of I-must-learn-how-to-drink-real-coffee!! Which was mostly non-voluntary and overall very painful. (Believe me, I would have stuck to my Starbucks caramel macchiatos and white chocolate mochas if I hadn't been so desperate to look cool. Okay, semi-cool. Fine, I didn't order black coffee, I'm not cool at all.) \n\nAnyway, it was good. At that point in time, I honestly had no idea how to judge - I'm still not really sure I do. Lattes for me are either \"good\" or \"bad\" - I find no real in-between when you're drinking mostly steamed milk. But I've heard it's the favorite of some more advanced/sophisticated coffee drinkers, so I'll trust 'em on that.\n\nOther than that, there's really limited seating and only one bathroom for both guys and girls, so I'd recommend going there for a quick pick-up only.", "author": "Emily H."}

And that moment sucks. \n\nIt's the moment before NASA's Curiosity Rover landed on Mars. It's the moment before Barack Obama was announced as the Next President. It's the moment before you lace up your boots. It's the moment before Whitney sings the National Anthem. It represents what we yearn for: to wake up. \n\nHowever you get there -- love, a face splash, a jog, a morning dance with your spouse -- get there. I get there by what I love. I love the story of Earth that coffee tells. It's a deep planted passion that I've been growing into for the last 7 years. From tended, cared for land, up sprouts a plant with a cherry that holds a bean worth while enough for a person to wash, process, peel -- or not to peel -- another person to roast, brew & cup, another person to distribute, then another cadre of people to roast & then, like here at Four Barrel, one wonderful man to brew the cup in front of me. I asked for something citrus & punchy, and what he gave me was citrus & punchy in the perfect way: their current Guatemalan Retana. Brewed to precision, the cup told the whipping lemongrass tale of all that made its way to me. \n\nBe inspired by the passion that it takes for the Direct Trade farmed cherry to brewed cup -- because in your hands rests what embodies the expoobident of how we endeavor to care for another to get us to that moment after we are: caffeinated, on Mars, with The President, with boots laced, singing the National Anthem, awake.", "author": "Jon A."}

It may go out the door and onto the sidewalk but those coffee makers know how to take orders and kindly ask you which side to wait for your caffeine fix.\n+ Decor is awesome. I love the industrial feel with wood tables.Tables are built for one person or more. Yes counter seating by the window front is plum for watching the other coffee revelers sitting at the sidewalk patio.\n+ Coffee? Yes of course it's good. They roast them in the back if you want to check it out.\n+ Almond latte's made with Califia Farm. Yeah it's $0.50 extra but hey it's an option.\n+ Pastries are on par with the Grade A coffee. That means kouign amanns ($4 or $4.25 if you want that blackberry center) from B. Patisserie are stocked in the case. Baked by Belinda Leong who hails as the wondrous pastry chef from Manresa, these kouign amanns pair well with Four Barrell.\n+ Cookies by Anthony's Cookies are divine too. Grab it if you need something sweet. Love that local bakeries are being supported.\n- Caffeine is a diuretic so I got to use the bathroom--it's a nice for a restroom. I dig the powder soap and it's not gross whenever I use it.\n\nThe coffee dregs (-'s):\n- Yeah just this location in the Mission where the SFMTA meter maids are out in droves.\n\nTIP: Grab a seat beforehand while your friend waits in line if you want to chill here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-07-07", "description": "941 reviews for this place?!  I guess I'm not surprised, as the one word that sums up this third wave coffee joint is \"hipster.\"  And as we all well know by now, \"hipster\" has become the new commonplace, hackneyed term used to describe anyone living in the city between the ages of 12 and 45 who has shaggy hair, dons raggedy, \"vintage\" clothes, and is loath to make extended eye contact with anyone in his/her vicinity for fear of looking uncool.\n\nAs soon as I walk in I'm greeted by a menacing trio of boar's heads, mounted on the wall.  The roasting facilities are also in the same joint and not only are the patrons hipster, the baristas & uhm, service folks, are also uber-trendy.  The bathroom has a mural on the floor--which happens to smell like stale urine, btw--and the handsoap is some straight-up powder concoction that the proprietors of Four Barrel probably bought from some online \"vintage\" shop (btw, that lanolin-infused powder hand soap most likely has zero anti-bacterial properties.  Something that does not sit well with me as the bathroom smells strongly of pee--just sayin').\n\nThe coffee itself is fairly decent.  I got a latte (no, I cannot do straight up drip or espresso, I need dairy with my caffeine) and the latte art is quite impressive.  It's the usual \"tree/leaf\" motif with many branches, but they modify the art so that the tree \"branches\" look rounder, to match the round rim of the mug.\n\nFinal verdict: Blue Bottle is better.  Heck, I even liked the latte that I got from the Equator Coffee kiosk at SFO more (strong stuff, rounded out by creamy dairy).  I probably won't be back unless I am dragged here by my (non-existent) hipster friends.", "author": "Connie K."}

Four Barrel doesn't have an extensive coffee drinks menu like some European cafes, but their coffees are good.  Strong but not overpowering.  I think it has to do with them using Clovers diary that the cream tuned down the coffee's strong body.  \n\nThey also have a table for coffee tasting.  The staff would walk you through  how to filter coffee grinds for tasting and you can choose up to 5 coffees to sample.\n\nParking is not too easy on the busy street, but walking seems to be the life in SF anyways. \n\nThe deco tends to be in the industrial style, half of the room was used as roasting factory at the back (though I've never seen the machine at work).  There are wooden seats around the shop, but sometimes they run out of seats fairly quickly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-12", "description": "I need to preface this review with two facts:\n1: I worked in a cafe for three years, I could talk your ear off nerding out about coffee and tea and what-have-you. I've trained many a barista, I've mastered latte art, and I can disassemble and rebuild a espresso machine like it was a service rifle.\n2: In spite of the above, I am not a picky fellow. Left to my own devices, I will absolutely drink whatever fluid contains caffeine if I need a fix. Also, I'm a smoker, so I don't have great taste buds to begin with.\nSo... onto this review. This shop looks F'ing amazing. They have these weird silhouette-shoplight fixtures, there's dead mammals on the wall, the employee's are all fabulous hipsters that are just the right amount of aloof. Seriously, it's just bell-jars and upcycled hardwoods as far as the eye can see. And the architecture of the space is amazing. Floating tables bolted straight into the walls... I'm such a sucker for that. There's outdoor seating too, which I usually hate, but Valencia is one of the pockets of the city where you're not likely to see someone crapping or shooting dope on the sidewalk, which is a huge plus. Also why the entire street is out of my price range virtually all the time, this cafe included; but my poverty is my own problem and does not affect the score of this establishment.\nThe first time I went in there I ordered a macchiato, which is my go-to drink if it's my first time at a cafe. It was damned good. I only have three categories for coffee: \"This is coffee\" \"this is good coffee\" and \"this is damned good coffee\", so Four Barrel is in the upper echelon as far as my limited senses are concerned.\nHowever, I am going to avoid the place selectively, depending on who is working the bar. You see, last time I was in the barista making drinks paused after making an Americano, sipped it to assure it's quality, and then handed it directly to the customer. Thankfully that customer wasn't me. Dude either didn't notice or didn't seem to mind, so I kept my mouth shut. Now, I'm all for the occasional quality-check to make sure the shots are pouring properly, but you want to just pour one shot for yourself... not check the drinks as they go out. That's pretty disgusting, actually. So minus one star, because I doubt that was an isolated incident.\n\nEdit: Just noticed today that they do not, in fact, have wifi or even power outlets. I've noticed some places starting to do that lately... and I guess it boils down to personal preference. I understand that there's a camp of folks who want bars and cafes to be places for strangers to get together and talk to each other, and feel like other people's use of technology is alienating. I'm not changing my 4-star rating on this basis, because a person ought to run whatever kind of business they so choose, but for the record I find that attitude rather creepy and the practice silly and inconvenient.", "author": "Bill G."}

The coffee was one of the best cups I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. It was perfectly brewed. It was a bit fruity and slightly acidic, so it was definitely a unique taste. The unfinished, slate gray ceramic mug it came was also gorgeous--they have their aesthetic down. The almond cake was deliciously light and delicate.

And no, Starbucks does not count as good coffee.  Being acustomed to the likes of Stumptown and Coava Roasters, finding good coffee anywhere else has always been a chore.  My first trip to San Francisco a year ago revealed a good niche in the area, but I had yet to find something I enjoyed more than my hometown coffeeshops.  All that said, Four Barrel certainly is giving my shops a run for their money.\n\nMy first impression when I walked in was \"this place is crazy busy\" but after guessing which mob of people to line up near, I was quickly signaled toward the counter to order my drink.  The guy taking my order was all smiles and courteous as he broke down the issues with my initial order...\n\nAs a lactose-free individual, I figured I would order a small soy latte.  After all, the menu hanging above said \"soy\" quite clearly.  This is where I found my first issue.  They recently stopped serving soy, but offered almond milk as an alternative.  As that was my only option, I went with it, but think it would be good to more clearly annouce the options available.\n\nMy next issue came from the simple fact that there is only one size when ordering to-go.  A bit odd, but I shrugged it off.  Why worry about what you can't change, right?  And I always appreciate the use of sustainable materials, so the cup size was not much of an issue.\n\nSmall complaints aside, my drink was made rather swiftly and with obvioius care.  As busy and seemingly unorganized as the place appeared, i was impressed with the service.\n\nAs I walked out the door, I took my first sip and was immediately satisfied.  After trying 3 other shops in town, this has become my current favorite in town... At least for now.  \n\nLater in the day, I stopped by another restaurant for lunch and finished my meal off with a cup of simple black coffee, roasted by Four Barrel.  While I am not a huge black coffee drinker, this cup was more than acceptable.\n\nAll combined, I happy with my choice to come hereand will certainly be returning when I can.", "author": "Jason W."}

We lived in Portland and travel to Hawaii.  We've had excellent coffee many many times, whether Stumptown's best or pure Kona, but this roast was just simply average.  Not bad.  Just average.

This is one of those coffees where you do not have to add sugar or cream, yes I said it, you do not have to add sugar or cream for which any cup of coffee iced or hot, I must have cream and sugar.

You have your commuter coffee (Starbucks and Peets) that is super dark and roasted and brewed in a pot to pretty much no flavor and served hot. And then you have your extreme cutesy (Philz) with overly aromatic, more so drinking a hot blueberry rather than coffee. Four Barrel I find to be a very good balance in between. Their coffee is a a little bit acidic with a really good flavor. It's a little cloudier than other coffee I have had (like not all one black, mostly blends of dark brown throughout). Very comforting and overall easily drinkable. They have donuts here which believe it or not are sweeter than krispy kreme  (a little too sweet imo).\n\nThe interior has a rustic look to it which I like. It's a little small even though it's layout gives it the appearance of being huge. There are some outside seating/leaning area but it is usually covered with cyclists so good luck with that. There is a small coffee bar near the entrance which I still haven't tried. Seems more for fancy stuff. I wanted to try the normal first. Working my way up.

My husband said we should try this place and he heard it's better than Philz. Okay - fair enough. Let's go try it! So we headed over there after looking at their menu on yelp (which isn't updated, btw) and I picked a roast I wanted. Walked in, scoured the walls for a legible menu, offerings, selections, and found one. Kinda. Read what was available, and wasn't impressed - everything is a medium-light to medium roast. I'm a dark to dark-medium fan (I don't particularly like adding anything to my coffee and I like bold and rounded out taste). They had a French press special (recommended to me by the barista helping us after I told her what we liked) and couldn't drink it for at least 60 minutes because it was so damn hot. When I finally tried it - holy shit was that coffee damn sour. Maybe I should've gone to the pour over bar, but it's not really obvious that they serve people at that bar area, but then again, they had no true medium roasts. \n\nWe headed to the ball game after and I went into Philz and got me a Silken Splendor. Smooth and rich. Just as it should be. \n\n1 star for the barista attempting to find us something, 1 star for the baked goods and 1 star for the decor/ambience.

I'd love to just spend an afternoon inside with a good read.\n\nWe ordered an Ecuador roast, which had honey and berry flavors, and it went down so sweet and smooth, much to my liking. I would come back for this again and again and am so devastated that there isn't one much like it over here.

I was already doing my own research when, on a lazy afternoon stroll on Valencia, I found out that Four Barrel had their very own 'brewing better coffee at home' class. I signed up right away. What a treat!\n\nFour Barrel, with its industrial open space, boards' heads on the wall, lack of pastries variety and pretentious hipster crowd, is not necessarily my type of coffee shop. I am more into the cozy ones, with lots of seating and gracious baristas, where I can spend hours immersed in a book, or simply relaxing and people watching. However, when I am around that part of the Mission, I find myself lured into it and grabbing a cup of coffee to go. I do like their coffee, and I like to watch them make it so slowly and carefully, with so much reverence as if they are painting the Monalisa.\n\nThey have their coffee class once a month, on Mondays. It is a two hour class, and it goes by really fast. There were 11 people in my class (usually 10), and everyone was engaged and asking tons of questions. The instructor, Matthew, a self proclaimed coffee geek who owns 6 grinders, was very knowledgeable and kind of funny. We learned about the coffee bean, roasting, under-extraction, over-extraction, coffee ratio, types of grinders, water temperature, etc. He covered four brewing methods: French press (still my favorite), chemex, clever drip and V60. At the end we could purchase any of the tools with a class discount, and pretty much everyone in the class bought something. We were all so ready to put our new knowledge to the test!\n\nWhat makes me a fan of Four Barrel is their passion for coffee, which is reflected all the way from the sourcing to the serving. And now they are even sharing their love and expertise with us, coffee aficionados. If you are one, go take Matthew's class.", "author": "Simone W."}

I'm not 100% sure on the varietal (yea, I know, shame on me.  I'll give you some money out of my wallet) but it was bright, juicy, floral with a silky mouthfeel and a round aftertaste that stuck around just long enough.  Siiiiick.  My wife's soy cappuccino, while not the best I've ever had, was still excellent and the soy was brought to more or less the perfect temperature without a hint of scalding.  I'm thoroughly impressed so far...\n\nSecond, I also ordered a cup of the Yirgacheff Biloya, a new favorite Ethiopian varietal, and through a snafu of communication the barista thought I had ordered a bag.  When we sorted it out, i happily took my very fairly priced bag, and the barista slid my a cup of their pressed Guatemalan Antigua Pompeya on the house, which was also exceptional.  Furthermore, as I was waiting for my espresso (which was also on the house, I assume because I purchased the bag of Biloya), I was eyeballing the homemade apricot doughnuts in the case and as luck would have it, one was passed my way across the counter.

Their coffee tastes like soured pea soup.  Without exaggeration, the worst tasting cup of coffee I've ever had in my life, including the powdered nescafe you're served in India.  Bummer, because it's a cool place to hang out.\nAdmittedly, I have only tried their basic coffee, and only twice, and it wasn't that bad the first time (but not that good either).  But a friend had the same sour-pea experience on another day so it wasn't just a one-time mistake.\nAmazing that such a sophisticated-looking cafe would do so much damage to a simple cup of coffee.  Maybe they're trying too hard.\nBack to Philz and Blue Bottle for me.\n \n*update*\nI originally gave 1 star but am upping it to 3 as that was excessively harsh. I've come to realize the sour-pea-soup-tasting coffee is an aesthetic choice a number of roasters are now making (like Ritual) that I just personally don't care for. I wouldn't 1-star a good winery for their Rose just because I don't like Rose. These folks are friendly and they know what they're doing when it comes to making coffee.

If you're a coffee fanatic, there are few better places than the bay area to be living in. Four Barrel makes the cut for one of those places that every coffee fanatic should try. \n\nThe reason for it is the entire experience that you get in the coffee shop. Right when you walk in, you see this huge space which goes against the usual concept of a cute little neighborhood coffee shop. At any given point you can easily fit about 50 people in the place and not feel like it's incredibly congested. The lines tend to get long, but they move fast enough where you don't feel like you're waiting a long time. Plus there is so much to take in visually that waiting never really becomes an issue. The furniture is minimal leaving the place extremely spacious. There are also some great spots outside to sit when the weather is nice. It's difficult usually to find a spot though unless you're standing outside scouting for one.\n\nOn to the price - I honestly don't think it's expensive. I pay for the taste and experience in a coffee shop. I think that's why people go there in the first place. Not just to go in and get out. If that was the primarily goal then there are places that serve that crowd. But this space encapsulates an experience - an experience that I'm ok paying around 3 bucks for for a Chai Latte that's expertly made. Also, do try their doughnuts. I had the spiced caramel one and it was good, but the chocolate one is what I hear all the craze is about.\n\nFinally, the actually coffee is great. They have an entire counter to see how drip coffee is actually made and the staff is extremely friendly in engaging you with your questions, which I always seem to have. I love a place where the staff truly takes their time and shows that they want to be there.\n\nAnd four barrel has that in its decor, ambiance, staff, and coffee. I love this place.

He looked at me with a giant grin and proceeded to tell me that and I quote, \"we don't have wifi here. In fact, some people like to drink their coffee and read these things called books.\" EXCUSE ME?!!!\n\nI worked in customer service for 10 years before moving to San Francisco and never in my life would I speak to a customer like that. It is in no way idiotic to ask about wifi when half of the customers siting in the place are on their laptops! Are they just doing that to look cool? Like the baristas think they seem cool speaking to people with their holier-than-thou attitudes?\n\nI was speechless and just walked over to the coffee bar and grabbed my drink.

It's like I took a mini-vacation this morning, tasting out-of-this-world single-origin v60 pour-overs--the Kenya Karatina and a Colombian. The Kenya Karatina was so complex, so sweet, with stonefruit, berry, and rose flavors and great body. My favorite. In the top 5 coffees I have ever tasted in my 6 short months of daily coffee drinking. Alex Powar and Jose were at the single-origin station. Two very nice guys. I bombarded Alex with questions, and with his answers and conversation, it was clear this guy is passionate about brewing great coffee and knows his stuff. I'm looking forward to taking the brewing class led by him later in the month. Thanks to both of you for giving me a memorable experience.\n\nI also tried their espresso blend, and a Rwandan single-origin espresso. I lean towards drip coffee, so am not a good judge of espresso, but the espressos definitely opened my mind to new flavors. Solid. Also had a taste of the Bolivian Inquisivi french press. Again, solid, easily drunk black.\n\nGreat interior design, lots of wood. They are actually playing records with what looked like a tube amplifier. Good music. Smiles everywhere, both baristas and customers. Great pastry selection. The place is popular, teeming with people at times, and it's no wonder why.

Their Mistral espresso machines sit on tables that can be raised, lowered, or rotated 180 degrees depending on the height and preferred working location.  They have a dedicated pour-over bar separate from the rest of the coffee-and-pastry ordering operation.  Their roasting equipment is on site, not ten feet from the counter where you can order seriously amazing Dynamo donuts.\n\nFour Barrel embodies the \"Unplug, Drink, Go\" approach to coffeeshops recently described in the New York Times. There's seating, but it's not super comfortable. There are tables, but they're not wide enough for your laptop and books and stuff. Which works out well, because there are no outlets for your laptop anyway. What's that on the wall? That's a stenciled-on outlet. Just try to plug in your laptop.\n\nSeveral reviewers have described Four Barrel as pretentious, and that's certainly the case, but their airs are well-deserved.  Their coffee is perfect.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-10", "description": "This is probably going to be the most unpopular review for this place, but so be it. \n\nLet's start with the positive: I like their coffee. It's good, robust - excellent flavor and expertly made. The venue itself is simple, yet effective. I like the classic brick and timber architecture. I also appreciate their use of vinyl for their music source - even if the music isn't my cup of tea (no pun intended). \n\nNow let's tap in to that negative side: dude...it's coffee. Get over your pretentious-ass self. This goes out to staff and patrons alike. Enough on that tip - I don't need to go on a hipster rant here (although I may create a venue called \"hipsters\" and leave it open for comments....sounds like a great idea, actually). Customer service and friendliness get a little better the more regularly you go there...but not awesome the first couple times. Each staff member has their own personality (and coffee mug with artist rendition available for purchase) - some are friendly, some are just doing their jobs...which is cool by me as long as they're getting the job done quickly and efficiently. \n\nMore negative: the coffee is just the perfect temperature to drink. Sounds great, right? Not if I'm taking my coffee home, which I often do, it's pretty tepid by the time I get back to my place which is no more than 100 yards away. Also, they kept changing their sugars, finally landing on rock, raw sugar. That's nice, too...BUT, my coffee is already dangerously close to being \"cold\" and now I have to wait 5 minutes for this rock to dissolve and dissipate. I usually only end up drinking half my coffee due to this. \n\nThe only other problem with this place is the line that ensues from the baristas taking their time on the excellence of their coffee. I can certainly appreciate that, but sometimes I'd just like to grab a cup and be in and out the door in under 5-minutes. That's difficult to do even if there's no one in line in front of you. \n\n\nSo to recap, great cup of coffee if you're not in a hurry, are going to drink it immediately and don't need sugar in it.", "author": "Eric H."}

The decor is very nice and comfortable and it smells good inside. I only wish they utilized the space better for more seating.\n2.

They have a lot of great beans here and you could do worse in SF.  The problem is the chaos behind the bar.  I think people sometimes confuse slow preparation with quality.  The slow food movement is about taking your time and enjoying a meal and other people....not about slow preparation as some sort of independent goal.  \n\nThe two lines at Four Barrel often deliver coffee at a wildly different pace.   A friend and I recently tested this. After ordering at about the same time, his macchiato took a full 12 minutes longer to prepare than mine.  There was talking and tamping and waiting and looking and rubbing off the steam wand and more talking...and then changing baristas etc.  The result was just your standard macchiato.

Times have been tight, but I can scrape up a few dollars for a wonderfully brewed coffee.\n\nA few things...\n1. They're still on a cash system. Will this change? I'm not sure, but come in knowing this beforehand. Although I wish they'd accept cards, as I'd be more apt to treat friends, buy beans or stuff my face with one more pastry.\n\n2. People need to stop complaining about the lack of tea. Come on! I've never been to a tea place (Samovar, for example), and heard someone complain about their lack of coffee. This is a coffee place folks... not the Wal-Mart of cafes. The fact they actually focus on one thing is admirable.\n\n3. If you order the iced coffee and you need some oomph, get it with an extra shot. Better yet, try a quad iced Americano in a 16oz cup/glass packed with ice, and just a splash of cold water. That'll curl your hair!\n\n4. Yes, they only have organic cane sugar, soy milk, and half-and-half on the condiment offerings. That's fine. No matter how much you Splenda/Equal/artificial sweetener folks complain, you really need to quit that junk, or go to some other place that'll mainline it to you. I feel for your livers.\n\n5. The baristas have almost always been friendly, to the point, get the job done, etc... Some of them won't stroke your ego, which can be interpreted as snobby. I beg to differ, but to each his own. Although there's one barista, with the tie, who is so upbeat, and on top of it, he just makes my day. I always look forward to him --his eyes sparkle.

I think they could have been a lot more efficient with how they designed things. \n\n2) More food - They only have one small pastry case and most of it is just donuts and croissants. They were delicious but it's rare that when I go and get coffee on the weekends that I don't get food too and I like to see a little more variety.\n\n3) Cash only...really? It's time to step in to the 21st century.\n\nThat's all.", "author": "Julia N."}

After, my friends and I decided to try Four Barrel Coffee a few blocks away because we have heard a good thing or two about Four Barrel.  It is a very spacious and hip coffee shop with cool and crafty decor inside.  I realized I was already in Hispterdam as soon as I stepped in. The prices are on a higher end of spectrum, yet, not so overpriced. There were four baristas and they are approachable and engaging. I did not get the sense that they are unfriendly despite some people in yelp have opined otherwise. I liked their very simplistic menu with fewer than 10 options. It seemed to communicate their confidence in the quality of their products. In the end, I ordered a cut of coffee and my friends from Italy had macchiato and espresso each. I have to say I was not particularly impressed with its coffee. I usually like rich flavorful dark coffee. At Four Barrel, its coffee was very acidic, not bitter but sour and not hot but lukewarm. Both of my friends also had similar impression of their drinks. In fact, half way through, I stopped drinking it all together.\n\nOn the flip side, what I particularly like about the place is that it was full of lively people conversing with each other.  Of course, there were some people in the corner trying to read or on their laptops. Since there is no wifi or outlet to charge computers, this place is not most suitable for studying.  \n\nI would think that this place is a cool place to hang out with your friends to converse and socialize, as you are basically paying for the ambiance. We were wondering how this place came to attract such a crowd when, in the vicinity, there are cafes with better tasting coffee. I understand that people say \"to each his own\" but I am quite not sure how the hype came about. I guess it is like a group psychology where people buy into what others with similar taste are telling them. Hence, seemingly high concentration of white middle class SF crowd in their twenties and thirties. It certainly has its charm but nothing out of ordinary in my opinion. \n\nIn terms of coffee, I would not recommend it at all. They roast their beans light to medium, leaving coffee to have unpleasant acidic aftertaste. Staff were generally very nice and courteous. One warning, though is that, If you are allergic to hipters, you might get an anaphylactic reaction.  \n\nOverall, I would have to say \"Meh.  I've experienced better.\"\nBut it was a valuable exotic and cultural experience, nonetheless.", "author": "fiona B."}

One foot of the sun \nsteadied itself on a long ripple in the river. \n\nThe first ferry of the day had just crossed the river. \nIt was so cold we hoped that the coffee \nwould be very hot, seeing that the sun \nwas not going to warm us; and that the crumb \nwould be a loaf each, buttered, by a miracle. \nAt seven a man stepped out on the balcony. \n\nHe stood for a minute alone on the balcony \nlooking over our heads toward the river. \nA servant handed him the makings of a miracle, \nconsisting of one lone cup of coffee \nand one roll, which he proceeded to crumb, \nhis head, so to speak, in the clouds--along with the sun. \n\nWas the man crazy? What under the sun \nwas he trying to do, up there on his balcony! \nEach man received one rather hard crumb, \nwhich some flicked scornfully into the river, \nand, in a cup, one drop of the coffee. \nSome of us stood around, waiting for the miracle. \n\nI can tell what I saw next; it was not a miracle. \nA beautiful villa stood in the sun \nand from its doors came the smell of hot coffee. \nIn front, a baroque white plaster balcony \nadded by birds, who nest along the river, \n--I saw it with one eye close to the crumb-- \n\nand galleries and marble chambers. My crumb \nmy mansion, made for me by a miracle, \nthrough ages, by insects, birds, and the river \nworking the stone. Every day, in the sun, \nat breakfast time I sit on my balcony \nwith my feet up, and drink gallons of coffee. \n\nWe licked up the crumb and swallowed the coffee. \nA window across the river caught the sun \nas if the miracle were working, on the wrong balcony. \n\n___\n PS- This miraculous coffee caught me by surprise. Bright and Lively. Drank on a summer sandy beach or on a cold drizzling rainy night- its flavors embrace like a long missed friend.", "author": "Arissa C."}

They do not just push a button and over drawn crappy espresso comes out. They create delicious masterpieces.  As a coffee nerd, I highly recommend this place. The espresso drinks are creamy, smooth and flavorful. The shots are never overdrawn or left to sit and get sour. This place is awesome if you really love coffee. Next time I go, I have to remember to get a few pounds of the beans. I want this at home too! As far as the location, the mission is a great place to explore if you are visiting SF.

Yes, their decaf is heavenly. I usually opt for the decaf americano and it does not disappoint, ever. It's like a cup of creamy smooth goodness. It's kind of like drinking a cup of dark, dark caramel. \n\nDid I mention they don't have Internet?  Thank you!

So last week on a typical foggy SF summer morning we decided to be adventurous and check the place out. The coffee itself was great - not too acidic but still with enough character to keep me entertained. My one complaint would be that there was no skim milk option so when the cafe is fully up and running I hope the milk offerings expand. The chairs in the ally were also a nice touch - there is something really nice about being able to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee in one spot before running off about our busy days. \n\nOh and one final comment - with so many Mission coffeeshops full of people squatting hour after hour, I'd love to see Four Barrels take a different approach and create a culture that encourages patrons to use the place as a spot for coffee with friends rather than as a full-time library.", "author": "Erin W."}

The coffee is exceptional and the baristas know their craft damned well.  My friend and I were able to claim a coveted wooden booth by the wall and savored our cappuccinos.  The espresso was strong with light floral hints without a note of acidity and bitterness.  I was transported back to my days in Italy, where I drank two cappuccino cups a day.  Of course, the little leaf coffee topper enhances the experiences a tad.  The ambiance of this place is also fun - rustic and woodsy.  In addition to the mounted animal heads on the wall, booths that look like tree stumps, and forest lined wall paper in the bathroom, there is a huge roaster contraption that takes up half of the space.  Good thing the rest of the space also includes plenty of indoor and outdoor patio seating.", "author": "Pauline L."}

It's one of the cool places nestled in the Mission along Valencia.  Even before you walk in, you'll see hipsters drinking coffee on sturdy wooden stand-tables outside.  Walk in and you are in a large workshop-like space, high ceilings, open space, cool wooden furnishings.  Again, sturdy, well-spaced.  Generally crowded.  You hear music playing on vinyl records, and to one side, various coffee making machinery, and on a wall, even set of buckheads.

You can tell a lot of love went into the birth of this place--and you can tell a lot of people have already fallen in love with hanging out here.\n\nI'm not a huge coffee drinker, but it's obvious this brew has that deep headiness to it that tastes complex, but without that burnt smell to it--or the icky aftertaste. The menu is spartan. No muffins, no sandwiches, no bottled beverages. But if you're looking for an awesome cup of coffee, iced or straight up--latte, cap, or espresso--it's worth the trip.\n\nN.B.

The soy cappuccino just puts me in a good place.\n\nAlso, the baristas are nice.  \n\nThe interior is less than conducive to, like, hanging out with a cup of coffee.  I ran into a friend there once and she looked around and commented, \"Wow, this place was definitely designed by a man.\"  It's angular and there are Javelinas on the wall.

Natural lighting (I think there's a skylight) offsets the decor and the attractive staff.  It feels cozy and hip and communal.  When you're here, you feel like just maybe you're part of something really awesome.\n\nThe set-up the baristas have is in my opinion, unparallelled.  This barista watched in awe as the espresso drinks were prepared in the most efficient and high-tech workspace ever with consistently perfectly textured milk and latte art.  Literally, I almost had a coffee-gasm watching the barista work.  It's like coffee and a show, in one.\n\nOnly, I was kind of underwhelmed by the finished product.  The milk, while conducive to making great art and perfectly silky in texture, was only lukewarm when I got it.  Although it was only a small 8oz cup, and the shot was a double, the taste of the espresso was insipid and overwhelmed by the milk.  Bf's mocha was similarly uninspiring, although I love the way they prepare it with really high quality semi-sweet chips rather than powder or syrup.\n\nI've had the drip too, which was good, but not that great.

A good deal is the drip coffee, well French Press, actually... It's rich, not sour, and a pretty nice sized portion for the dollar. Their cappuccinos are also really well prepared, served at the right temperature with a delightful thick and luscious foam. Coffee is definitely 5 stars, some of the best I've ever had.\n\nTheir Valencia location is convenient, and very spacious. They could fit more tables in here though, so people can stay awhile and listen to their collection of vinyl LPs which range the gamut from vintage Madonna to Interpol to Willy Nelson (well, I'm not sure about Willy Nelson, but definitely stuff that sounded like Willy Nelson to me). A huge huge drawback is NO WIFI. I mean, what self respecting cafe doesn't have WiFi? I get that they don't want people to stick around all day, but really... \n\nThe ambiance is a mix of hipsters, unemployed artists, and mornings even see whole families (dog included!) coming in for some caffeination. The dogs are particularly cute, although not conforming to health code I'm sure. There is a massive roaster in the back and it's fun to see the guy checking the beans and the smell of course is delicious.\n\nWell, I guess the final comment would be that the 4 wild taxidermied boar heads are not all that appetizing.

My dad wasn't sure how their coffee tasted like so he asked for a sample and the girl working the counter had an irritated demeanor and had an attitude. Mind you that my dad is not fluent in English and his grammar is not perfect but he gets his points across. My dad asked her if they had any dark roast coffee, the she rudely replied that they don't have any. She didn't even care to help my dad look for a coffee blend he liked best. So my dad went to one of the baristas for help instead and all the guy said was \"huh?\" And continued on with his work. Like are you kidding me?

So why only 3 stars? Well, to start it took a while to find parking in the area on a Saturday afternoon, but finally I did find someone leaving. Since I was travelling I didn't have any quarters on me (I always keep them in my car), but she left me 18 minutes of parking time, which I thought would be perfect for getting a cup of coffee and a quick lunch to go. I was very wrong! Iget in and it isn't that busy, but not dead either. Note: there are two lines, one for espresso drinks and/or drip and one for espresso and/or pour over. There were two people doing pour overs: one apparently was giving a bunch of groupies a cupping class, and the other serving the rest of the customers. After they grind the coffee they give it to you to smell; I love a great cup of coffee and seek out 'third wave' shops when I travel, but I'm not a professional. I could see doing this for someone in the industry, but between this, the groupies, and the big shot serving the groupies it was all just over the top and snobby. This place demonstrated much of why I did not like San Fran. I also waited over 20 min for a cup of coffee when the place wasn't very busy. It took less time at Ritual with a huge line (I'm not expecting it to be right away, I mean I am ordering a pour over). The staff is very friendly, but the friendliness toward the current customer means all the people in line behind them are just standing there waiting. I couldn't see this place lasting very long in NYC, but I guess things are a little slower in San Fran. I would recommend this place for the coffee, but that is about it.", "author": "Jacob M."}

They replied they only serve coffee which I thought was very admirable, a coffee house that only serves coffee. Just like a tea house should only serve tea. I am a tea conoisseur and appreciate fine tea. I wouldn't want my tea house serving coffee also, it would show that they're not taking their tea seriously. \n\nSo I didn't order any drink but saw some pastries.

It is a warm space with the perfect amount of natural light; acoustically live enough to generate a buzz but not loudness.\n\nI also love the visual process/progression. It screams passion for coffee. Up front there is activity at the drip bar. The focal point is the espresso bar, where one can easily interact with and observe the baristas. They have the most fantastic low-profile espresso machines that almost look like giant mechanical spiders. The back half of the building has racks of green coffee in burlap bags and their vintage Probat roaster complete with belt drive (like a machine from the start of the industrial revolution).\n\nApproaching the espresso bar, the staff is friendly. We are coffee cognoscenti, so we did not make any faux pas, but they did not seem the type that would verbally flagellate a novice. Our barista made a perfect cappuccino with a crisp rosetta on top.

I think that it's every bit as good as Ritual, and Blue Bottle. Yet, they all have their differences. RItual has the clover machine madness. Blue Bottle has the pump espresso and the siphon. And Four Barrel. Well four barrel has the most beautiful Espresso Bars and luckily some Baristas that know how to use it.\n\nWhen I was there a few weeks ago they were serving this delicious Kenyan Peaberry on the espresso bar and it was smokin. The Capp's were great and so were the Latte's. My friend got a Mocha one of the times we were there and I really appreciated that they actually put cocoa beans and crush them into the drink.

They share DNA with Stumptown Roasters in Portland. I think all the reviews here may be a bit premature...Four Barrel is about to fire up their own roasting in the store.\n\nIs it perfect? No. No wi-fi. Selection of pastries, etc. is light. These are far easier to rectify than trying to make a better cup. So...if I'm gonna meet somebody for a serious cup of coffee...to talk philosophy without the need of a laptop, I'll just head to Four Barrel and leave connectivity at the door.

It functions like a well-oiled engine and feels like a natural ecosystem of its own, replete with its coffee-bean flora and hipster fauna. The outdoor structure serves as a two-in-one bike rack; the music system revolves around a vintage record player; and the baristas have mustaches, tattoos, tight black clothing, and often all of the above. Honestly, it all just kind of works well together here. \n\nAnd it gets better. \n\nUnlike many other places (cough cough, Blue Bottle), there's one barista for in-house orders and another for take-out's, which minimizes the waiting time; there are two cashiers in the middle speeding the process up; and all of the coffee is roasted on display in the back, which is just plain neat.\n\nAs far as the coffee itself, I loved my de-caf (I know, I know) cappuccino... and, as my husband aptly put it, it was overall expensive, but not overpriced. It was tough -- in fact, impossible -- to find seating indoors on this wintery Sunday afternoon, but we were content to plop down on their outdoor terrace with other fellow coffee drinkers wrapped around their drinks for warmth. It was not short of perfect, really.\n\nThere's a reason, I guess, why Four Barrel pops up (second... after Ritual, of course) as the \"most hipster coffee place in SF\" on Google.

(why are there so many reviews from confessed non-coffee drinkers?)\n\nI like the feeling of unfinished work, not left undone, just not yet finished. This place is in flux and it's fluxing forward. Exhibit A, the not-yet-working roaster that dominates the place like a Mt Fuji looming over the espresso machina.\n\nThe tables may be my favorite things about 4B Coffee, chunky, simple, narrow. But they're there aren't they? I'd love to have a desk like that. In fact, where the hell did you get those things?\n\nI also like the dueling espresso machines approach. One cashier in the middle and two espresso machines on either side. This place seems built to beat the crowds--though I didn't experience a crowd. The lines pulsed like VU meters, but never seemed static.\n\nTHE DETAILS:\n\nMy espresso, though it was served to me quickly from barrista al' izquierda was not hot. Not sure why, it just came out of the machine that way. Taste was very good. Light brown color. Good aroma. Pretense low. But the bottom line was that my first cup there was imperfect. My friend met me later, and didn't want an espresso, saying that their beans are too bitter for him. Funny, because we went there at his behest. We talked a long while.\n\nLater, I had another. This one from different barrista (a la derecha) and it was hot and good and perhaps bitter, but I appreciate a wide variety of espresso tastes--and so I did just that.\n\nThe overall vibe is relax. I still can't get over having an espresso in what used to be a war zone just 14 years ago. Even less. So, can't quite get the condos from across the street out of my head. Didn't that used to be public housing?\n\nFinally, on my way out at the end of this in came the chicks with the donuts. Smiling like they must be the most popular chicks in 8th grade with those donuts. What appeared to be pistachio covered, iced, cake, and on and on. But sorry ladies.

After reading about their high marks in Travel + Leisure, however, I knew I could no longer be the lame-o that doesn't know.\nThis place makes a fine cup of coffee (*all I have had is a standard cup; no espresso drinks). The thing that is really stand-out, however, is there treats, namely, their donuts.  They make, what I would like to call, a grown-ups donut.  Meyer Lemon, Chocolate Anise, Pear/Molassas/Guiness (yea, you read that right).  The donuts are expensive at $3 a pop, but hell, good--it keeps me from eating lots of donuts.\nThis place pretty close to \"has it all.\" Very nice atmosphere; lots of wood furnishings and old metal, high ceilings, very clean.  Neat parklets outside wear you can sit and enjoy your coffee and treats! \nAnd a bit of a cherry on top that is growing to be an unfortunate must-notation: the people here are NICE (unlike Blue Bottle, bastian of the silent judgement, or worse, Ritual, a company from whom I will not buy coffee again despite the tasty quality because several of their employees have unbelieveable problems with not being dicks).  Good service with genuine smiles and \"Hey, how's it goin?\"s......not condesending smirks and silent judgements of my clothing.\nI didn't give it 5 stars because it wasn't a life-changing experience with the coffee.

Considering past barista experiences (Blue Bottle, Sightglass, and Philz - though it's a stretch to call the staff at Philz a barista), I'm prepared to get the frustrated vibe from counter help.  The kids down at Four Barrel remained friendly and informative throughout.  At the main counter, I asked for something they don't offer.  Hey, you can always ask, right?  In an extremely friendly way, they explained I was a bit off menu, but they could work it out just for me, because I'm awesome and they care deeply.  Well, maybe it wasn't quite all that, but it was definitely friendly.  I was directed to the other counter.  This is the 'slow' order stand, where a single cup was carefully crafted just for me.  The guy working that counter didn't have the beans I wanted, but said 'no prob' and walked back to the roastery to get me what I asked for.   I love that. \n\nAs a general rule, if a place serves great coffee, plan on not being able to get a seat.  Makes sense, right?

If I'm not at home or work, I usually get my coffee at a chain coffee shop or a casual cafe... But just because I don't spend a ton of money doesn't mean I don't love coffee. I really do love it. The good, the bad, the mediocre. \nI went here and the music was really ridiculously loud. I bought a mug of coffee for $2.73. That is probably the most I have spent on coffee for a long time (maybe ever?), but whatever. I sat down at the counter facing the area that they roasted their beans in and a couple of the workers gave me weird stares. Really?\nIt was hot so I waited a minute. I was also waiting for my friend and I didn't have that much money, so I decided to let my coffee cool off. When I took my first sip, the aroma was really offputting... I couldn't tell initially what the smell and aftertaste was, but after a while I realized that it tasted like my mom's tomato soup.\nNow it would be one thing if it was like caffeinated tomato soup. That sounds really gross, but it was way better than coffee that tastes like tomato soup. It was gross, and I tried my best to finish my coffee, but a 3/4ths of the way through I just couldn't take it anymore. I lightweight wanted to puke. The aroma and aftertaste had become so strong the further I got, the more disgusted I became with myself and my need to drink this coffee. My friend had ordered some coffee too. She isn't a big fan of coffee and she could barely get through a 1/4 of her mug.\nI went over to the barista and started talking to her about the coffee. She went on to explain how coffee really comes from fruit and how tomatoes are also fruits. I knew this already, but at least she knew her stuff (kind of). She then went to say that it was from Guatemala. That still didn't explain why it tasted like tomato soup. She did say that every day they switch out their blend, which is good. She did also say that I wasn't the first person to say it tasted like tomato... Are you serious? Some people actually like this shit? She mentioned she wasn't a fan, and I appreciated her honesty. She then asked how I felt about it, and I said I thought it was gross. She then said that the espresso was way milder and doesn't have the tomato taste and offered me an americano for free because she thought I might like it.\nThat was probably the best part of this experience. The barista was nice and somewhat knowledgeable and was willing to give me something for free. She even thanked me for not drinking all the coffee. I probably would have if it didn't make me want to puke. I would have stopped earlier, but I was pretty tired and I needed my caffeine fix. \nSo I got my americano. I tipped because of my weird tipping policy that negates the fact that they had two glass milk containers stuffed with tips and really I was saying \"thank you\" for the service. I then sat down. The americano was strong and kept me up way too late... But it still kind of tasted like tomato soup. Not to the point where I wanted to puke, but the aftertaste was slightly there.\nI don't know if I want to come back here.

One of my favorite features are the rope sculptures that also serve as the chandeliers above the front windows.  My second favorite feature is the floor of the bathroom.  I love the deer and duck nature/hunting scene.  But the whole place is pretty to look at.  Lots of big chunky pieces of reclaimed wood; i love how the tables jut out of the walls and the school house chairs.  Exposed wood beam ceilings.  Ultra-cool modern espresso machines.  I like the three little pigs and bear heads on the north wall (I guess they all got theirs).  Decently interesting art on the wall.  Even the coffee manufacturing machinery in the back looks cool.   This definitely ain't no cushy couch relaxation station coffee shop, but it's a cool place to hang out for a bit.\n\nThe baristas behind the counter are pretty nice and my latte... not too bad.  Nicely roasted with a lot of flavour.  A little pricey at 3.50 a pop, but that's just compared to my standby cuppa.

The latte was smooth and had a good balance of milk and espresso.

As some people here have said, this place has a \"hipster\" vibe, but I feel like that could be said about most places in SF. The shop itself is quite unique, with wooden tables, super high ceilings and lots of space to roam and look at different types of coffee in jars.

The hipsters don't want to be left out of the strife between the nortenos and surenos.  The fixed gear skinny pant nation needs a side to cling to.  Hence, the Battle of Valencia between uber-coooooool Ritual Roasters against the wannabe uber-cooooooooler Four Barrell.  What a surprise that the new entrant in hipsterian coffee warfare seeks to define itself as just a little cooler, an espresso just a little snottier, an ambience just a little less yuppier, stump town coffee just a little more bitter.  And on and on and on.\n\nAll that being said, Four Barrell needs to learn that the holy grail of hipsterianism values supposed \"originality.\"  Thus although on its face its taken all of Ritual, put the good parts on steriods and got ridden of the baggage... its still not Ritual.  And frankly, im not a fan of the bitter espresso.  I feel its makes my cappucino taste like the proper and delicate mix of coffee and milk has not been achieved.\n\nLong live Ritual, the capital of the Mission, the mecca of coffee snot-ery.", "author": "S.

You kind of stop in, have a coffee, and move on; you don't really feel as much like you can settle in with a book, or a computer, or a conversation, as you might in other cafes with other seating arrangements.\n\nLastly, there's a feeling that the staff are *trying* to be hip and stylish. They lack charisma, frankly, and seem to want attention for their appearance. Which, for me, is an unimpressive vibe. I'm really just going in for coffee, not to have the barista looking out the corner of their eye to see whether I'm noticing them. A bit adolescent...

It's a shame, but I'm unable to tolerate their behavior toward my daughter. I was a customer for two years and I was going there almost every weekend with my wife and daughter. Today my daughter was louder than usual and screamed five or six times. At that point a member of the staff asked us if there is anything we can do to keep the noise down. When my wife pointed out that it's not easy to control a three-year old, she suggested that the parklet outside might be a better place for us. This happened on a Saturday at 5pm. When I discussed the incident with the manager, she claimed that other children do not scream and that some customers complained. When I pointed out how loud the coffee shop usually is, she pointed out that screaming is not acceptable in any space. At that point, I realized there was no reason on keep arguing. Very disappointed to see how narrow-minded these people are. Again, not because they asked us to be more quiet, but because they suggested we don't behave like all other customers.", "author": "Michalis P."}

The two baristas were very serious looking.\n\nWe got a single origin espresso (Colombia Huila), regular espressos, a machiato, and a latte. All of us had great initial experiences with our coffee. They all started out fantastic. Then they all started to go bad.\n\nWhat started out as a fantastic espresso with flavors I've never had in an espresso (granny smith apple, etc.), ended as a horrible metallic finish that just wouldn't go away. It lasted and lasted and lasted. Then my husband, who had earlier said his latte was excellent, said it had gone all wrong too. He let me have a taste and if he hadn't earlier said his was good I would have sworn I was tasting burned milk. It was awful.\n\nGreat. Now I had TWO bad tastes competing with each other and they just won't leave.\n\nAll 6 of us agreed that what started out good, even great, ended terribly.

I live here, so I've gotten used to ignoring the rude and scornful behavior.

Since it was so hot today, I figured that I'd get myself an iced coffee and top it off with sugar and cream. Well, the carafe said \"cream\" but I assume it was half and half since the only dairy accouterments were marked \"cream\" and the other \"soy\". The coffee was undrinkable - it tasted like I was sucking on a penny or a nickle, with a twangy, metallic, and acidic taste that lingered on my palate for a disturbingly long time. I took three sips and then threw it away at the next trash can.\n\nAn argument can be made that I shouldn't be basing a review on iced coffee since it is pre-made and refrigerated, but I feel confident that, on this hot day, there was enough turnover of the iced coffee that what I was getting was not stale. And why should it be regardless?\n\nLastly, I looked over the selection of whole beans and concluded that they have lost all credibility as coffee mavens after I read their descriptions of the beans.

Blue Bottle in part because their coffee is similarly delicious--my top two in the city, though Blue Bottle's actual coffee still retains a slight edge (and I always think I should get beans at Graffeo in North Beach more often but it's so far away). The two also remind me of each other for their minimalist, modern, airy aesthetic. I somehow got into the naughty habit of accidentally calling Four Barrel \"Blue Barrel,\" perhaps my fantasy of their over-caffeinated-to-the-point-of-being-sexually- frustrated love child.\n\nThe Ritual connection is easier to establish, since the owner was originally part of the Ritual partnership and broke away to start his own spin-off. But if Ritual is \"Friends,\" Four Barrel isn't exactly \"Joey.\" Rather, it is a more collected, less hyperactive, arguably more successful (not necessarily in monetary but in cool terms) version of its older half-sibling. The space is so large, and the vibe so relaxed that they can be playing an angry angry punk record, and you can still find space to be with your own thoughts (or coffee companion).\n\nSome things I love:\n- their americanos in the larger cups, really rich for americanos (plus $2 is a fun price to pay for fancy coffee).\n- sitting in one of the high chairs looking out onto the street like Poe's narrator in \"The Man of the Crowd,\" a story you should find and read right now!\n- the woodland fantasy bathroom with super strong air blower hand dryer\n- the fact that they opened their space for Obama phone banking\n- the day when I shamelessly asked what their cheapest beans were and in response to my pathetic question, the coffee man found me a leftover bag of beans they had been sampling that day and gave them to me, bestowing upon me such a boundless joy that he could never have anticipated (he also has the amazing and rarely spotted ability to flash a little peace sign as a goodbye wave in a way that is totally unforced and mysteriously unfobby--if you don't know what \"fobby\" means, ask a California Asian person).\n\nI sit in that picture window sometimes, half-reading, half-gazing at passersby while swinging my legs, and I think about what a beautiful space it is and how their employees are said to have nice healthcare benefits and livable wages, and I wonder how they can keep going on coffee alone. It seems like a beautiful dream.", "author": "Katrina D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-11-01", "description": "Four Barrel has quickly become my favorite coffee shop - and I'm pretty serious about my coffee. Highly recommended, especially for espresso lovers.\n\nIt's easy to get so-so espresso in this town, but there are few places that make a knock-your-socks-off demitasse - the kind that lingers on your tongue for half an hour and makes your mouth all happy. Even rarer is the coffee shop that's able to pull off exceptional shots with great consistency. I used to go to Ritual for my espresso, and they sometimes pulled off a great shot, but Four Barrel has much, much better consistency and overall better quality. This is _the_ coffee shop I tell people to visit to learn what really good espresso tastes like.\n\nFour Barrel also has a good selection of roasted coffee for sale, with reasonable prices and detailed descriptions. My only qualm is that the coffee on their shelves is often 1-3 weeks old, which is much older than I'd expect from such a great shop. My standards are probably a bit high, since I often buy green coffee and roast it myself at home, so I'm used to drinking 1-to-5-day-old coffee; most people probably won't know what they're missing. Even so, it's good enough that I buy their coffee fairly frequently, since I don't roast enough at home to match my consumption. Just check the roast date on the bottom of the bag and pick the fresher roasts. Their roasts are on the lighter side, so if you like your beans burnt to a crisp, you'll probably want to look elsewhere.\n\nFour Barrel's baked goods are pretty good; flaky, buttery croissants, little tart-sized pies, tasty donuts, etc. Good for a breakfast on the way to work or a midday dessert, though not quite Tartine-level.\n\nThe space is large and doesn't usually get too crazy, so it's a good place to get a little work or reading done, if the lack of power and wifi isn't a problem (that's a plus for me). I personally wouldn't try to set up camp here all day, but it's good for a few hours. They've got good taste in music (e.g. Bowie) too.\n\nOne last note, about the service: I don't understand why other reviewers are complaining; I've never had any problem here, and find the staff to be friendly and relaxed. If you're expecting subservient, ingratiating drones, I guess you'll be disappointed, but if you're a polite, friendly customer, I think you'll find they're great.", "author": "Rick B."}

But after the opening my experience has been uneven at best. The Stumptown espresso, roasted in Portland,  has been replaced by home roasted beans( weirdly enough, with a two dollar increase in price!), and the quality has fallen: the layered, bright, herbal notes of the Portland roast have given way to a tobaccoey, over cooked style  by Four Barrels' own roasters.  A real loss of quality.  Worse, many of the other region-specific brands have an unpleasant chalky notes and unfocused flavors. (I don't mean this across the board. Two months ago, for example, I drank a Sumatran blend in house. It was delicious, maybe the best Sumatran I have ever tasted). \n\nQuestion: Are they simply mediocre roasters?\n\nAs for the experience drinking there, the music is loud, the tables are hard and uncomfortable, and the space itself seems busy and grim at the same time. The addition of art will help, however.  As for the counter service, the boys and girls have been nothing but polite and charming.

I ordered the standard soy latte, this time going for a decaffeinated twist, as it was getting late in the day (and I cannot drink coffee after 1 pm if I want to get any sleep that night). The small cup soon emerged boasting a milk froth pattern rivaling and perhaps exceeding the artistry of Ritual and Bluebottle. And the taste, oh the taste. Absolutely perfect in all respects- not too strong, not too hot, not too burnt, not too bitter.....just right. It gets better though- as we sat down at the bar I noticed a huge box of scharfenberger chocolates. I asked the barista how much they cost (as these things can go for $1 a piece easily) and was shocked to hear \"free, take as many as you want\". OMG, free chocolates to dunk in this creamy frothy bliss, what could be better?\nIn summary, I found my new home away from home, even though I live just a few blocks away.", "author": "Kate A."}

Although due to the ultra fine grind and french press brewing, don't drink that last gulp. Yeech.  The pastries are also very good especially the ham and cheese croissant. They have an abundance of those crispy bits of cheese around the edges that I love. The staff is very nice and strangely soft spoken. The music is good and unobtrusive, all on vinyl (yeah, a bit of pretension). Decor is rugged and well executed (be sure to look up if you go in the bathroom). Big windows to sit at and watch the world go by. The clientele tends to be on the uppity side, the spaciousness ignites some agoraphobic feelings and the chairs are awkward and uncomfortable (certainly not a cozy, curl up and read a book kind of place) so I usually don't hang around.", "author": "Tara D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-09-09", "description": "For me there are three criteria by which I evaluate a coffeehouse: \n1. the quality of the *coffee* \n2. the customer service \n3. the comfort, functionality and decor of the *house* space.\n\nFirstly, the soy latte I ordered ($3) was priced within reason, given this is supposed to be one of thee best espresso drinks in town. That being said, the latte I received was 3.5 out of 5, my espresso was weak, did not stand up to the soy milk and it was lukewarm.  The foam was pretty damn amazing but what is good foam without a strong espresso finish? So the drink I received was not worth the money I paid. I would pay 3 dollars for a latte I know damn well is going to be good. By the time I got the drink though (as you will see) I didn't want to bother the employees anymore so I just drank and judged what I got.\n\nAs for customer service, 2/5.  There were two baristas working when my friend and I walked in. The guy barista was nice and helpful with my questions about their menu and took our order (2 soy lattes), and the lady barista got busy on that.  \nShe made 2 lattes and I asked \"are these our two soys?\" \nTo which she replied \"Ughh, F$#K\"  She begrudingly paused and continued \"Are they both soy?\" as if we inconvenienced her.  We said \"yes, sorry\" sheepishly and walked to a table while she started over.  I wasn't rude or pushy or anything about it, so why the attitude? I can understand some customers get all uppity and rude but I'm definitely not.  So I felt really annoyed and frustrated this being my first experience here.  Maybe that's why the soy latte was weak? Maybe she said 'sorry guys' when she called out the soys but it wasn't any sort of meaningful statement and I just assumed get on with my life.\n\n3. 4.5/5 on the space.  It was extremely pleasant, lots of tables to choose from, nice music and clean bathrooms. The decor is really unique and well organized.  I think the seats, though fashionable are wanting in comfort.\n\nI'd probably go back eventually but I'm in no rush. I will grant my barista may have just been having a bad day which happens but if I get another weak coffee or attitude there are plenty of other dependable coffeehouses in the city.  I'm sad, my friend hyped this place and sadly we got that stereotypical hipster than thou treatment you would expect from a hip coffee joint. Sigh.", "author": "Maryanne R."}

While four barrel cappuccinos are filigreed leaves of perfect microfoam, and their donuts are the wicked little morsels from dynamo, it's not the offerings at the counter that force me to call on my reserves of self-discipline.  Rather it's the space itself. Huh? With 280 square feet of 'wasted' space, a turntable and high ceilings, all I want to do when I walk in is dance.  Not smooth dancing (that I'm afraid is beyond me)  but crazy, just me-and-the-music, Ian Curtis-brand dancing. \n         But instead, I demurely order, get my cup of bliss and settle in at a window seat.  I look like I'm people-watching, while really I'm scheming dance parties, rounds of duck-duck-goose and live music for the center of the room.  And the standing table?  Awesome!  Nabokov wrote all of his novels standing up.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-01-15", "description": "Okay, I've been interested in trying 4barrel for a few months now, and finally found myself in the Mission AND undercaffienated. Despite the reviews I read, the hipster behind the counter was pretty cool, and took my order politely. Probably because I just smiled and ordered a macchiatto. I'm not much one for the non fat extra-hot crap, as I'm a barista, and I know how frustrating it is to have your art put to shit just because someone wants to sound cool ordering their drink. The decor of the actual shop was pretty tragically hip, but it's a coffee shop in the Mission. If you're expecting something else, this probably was not the place to find it. The setup behind the counter is probably the coolest coffee shop setup I've ever seen though. The espresso machines are beautiful, and I love the way the double bar is set up. Drinks were well put together as well. The three stars is mainly for the drinks. It was good, and they know how to steam milk, pull a shot, and put a drink together pretty perfectly. Unfortunately, the espresso was just not mindblowing. I could probably make a drink of equal caliber from any decent coffee in town. Hopefully when they start roasting their own coffee, the experience from Ritual will help them to one up their friends up the street. \nI swear to God, one day I will find a coffee shop that out does Peet's :)", "author": "Edwin M."}

And it's not that I don't like bitter coffee either ... this was just plain nasty.\n\nTo top it off, the chairs are super uncomfortable (cool style, maybe, but I'm not a big fan of the style-over-any-sort-of-substance fad) and there is a ton of wasted open space, so you have to wait for someone else to leave before forcing yourself to down your coffee. Maybe if they had an amazing product I could appreciate the style, but that's not happening.", "author": "Raphael M."}

One of the reasons I stopped going to Ritual was because every table had 1-4 laptops on it and I was tired of seeing this. Laudably, Jeremy's new place, 4-Barrel Coffee, has no wireless connection, so you are free to read a book, a newspaper, dream, or even talk to the stranger next to you. Fabulous coffee, good, funny baristas (who even helped me get my scooter started when it died), and a wonderful space without wireless all conspire to get my full five stars. The bitter coffee on Valencia is a spillover from other chain cafes, which will remain nameless, whose best idea ever was to take bad beans and overroast them to give you a \"French Roast,\" the oily black rancid coffee that most of the west coast drinks, which requires lots of milk and flavored syrup just to make it potable. To find out about good coffee, ask a good barrista here, at Blue Bottle, or at Intelligentsia, if you're in Los Angeles, or DoubleShot, if you're in Tulsa. They love the stuff and will tell you all about it. Clientele, well, there's not much you can do about that, and it's not the owner's fault, it's the neighborhood. When a thing is good, it usually takes a lot of money to operate and compensate workers fairly, this means the price is going to be higher than the 25-Hours-a-Day donut shop's coffee.
