Of course you can always go to that _other_ place down the street--the one with the 3,000 photos and 5,000 reviews and lines to match--but this is a place you can actually eat before going about your day, assuming you're on the team that eats to live and not the one that lives to eat. Although I'll admit the other place ain't bad, so go if you must. Then come here next time!\n\nI actually have fonder memories of this fine eatery when it inhabited the Loiny Loin, on Larkin Street in striking distance from law school and Civic Center BART/MUNI. They had fewer pretensions and lunch sets that would fill you up for effectively no money. Times have changed, and San Francisco as we knew it isn't coming back, which has probably been said by someone somewhere every day in the history of our fine city. I suppose I'm withholding one star in tribute to its former glory.\n\nSo it took me 2-3 visits to acclimate myself to the restaurant this became, but I'm happy with it now. The flavors in the tea leaf salad still pop, and I haven't ordered a bad salad here yet. Try the papaya salad, a fine and significantly less nuclear take on the Thai version. The coconut rice is in perfect balance and fantastic. Order anything with pumpkin. We last went with pumpkin curry with shrimp. I'm curious to try more of their vegetables. There's enough menu here to justify plenty of repeat visits. And you certainly won't have trouble finding a table. Let's keep going again and again until that changes. If San Francisco has veered sharply away from dirt cheap food, we can still vote with our dollars, and if the Burmese can be at this level, I'll take Burmese on every corner, and maybe eventually more than one per neighborhood outside the Richmond.", "author": "James D."}

So why not !!!\n\n1) signature tea leaf salad - love the peanuts, sesame,split peas, fried edamame and everything in this salad. Taste rich the way it is and refreshing when you squeeze lime to it. Don't let the size fool you. It's filling with all those nuts and beans. Got one Togo because it was so good and was offered to have the nuts separated into another bag so it won't get soggy before eating!\n\n2) combo fried platter - Burmese style falafel (lemongrass fragrance really makes this different super crunchy outside) , samosa ( best i ever had, thin crispy outside and not a overpowering flavored filling), golden tofu ( I don't know what I was eating it was damn good, good frying batter and the golden tofu wasn't any tofu I ever had, thought it was some sort of pumpkin) dish comes with tamarind dipping sauce \n\n3) rainbow noodle salad - color and refreshing . Order this with dried shrimp and that flavor really made the dish unique. When I ate it. It seemed like nothing special but that taste got me wanting more \n\n4) coconut noodle soup - coconut curry base soup. Similar to laksa is the best way I can describe it for those who had it (my brother said it remind him of Portuguese style curry that grandma used to make) nice coconut aroma. Comes with some crispy something that gives a bite eating this dish with the curry soup. Not bad but wish the flavor was stronger for my taste . \n\n5) sour leaf shrimp - was told this dish is something you won't find elsewhere and specially grown to be served here to have a taste of home(burma) . Ignoring the shrimp, this reminds me of a Chinese style dried mustard green . But this dish is made fresh with flavors of bamboo shoot and a bit of salty sweetness. Interesting to try. \n\n6) Burmese milk tea - light in flavor and 30%sweet. Not bad. But wish I got the fresh coconut instead ! Happy to have tried Burmese style milk tea still. \n\nService was really top notch. Friendly, warm and welcoming .  recommending dishes more authentic or special for Burmese food to someone who has never had anything but making sure we didn't over order. Offered to course our dishes so we can savor the flavor and take our time. The tea leaf salad was so good . Had to get it to go and was offered to place the nuts in a separate bag to prevent it being soggy incase it wasn't eaten right away . \n\nI had a 10%off from yelp app for this place but didn't use it because I was just that satisfied .

It's funny that they were so close to my office, and then they moved to my neighborhood..  I guess I was meant to dine here!\n\nMy friend from NYC never had Burmese food, so this place came to mind as Burma Superstar always has a long line, and we were already on the 38.\n\nWe started with the roti and potato curry.  The roti is so good, especially with the comforting curry.  I wish there was more roti for the price (plus there was a lot of curry left over), but that bread is pretty filling.\n\nI got the eggs in tamarind sauce, and the coconut rice per recommendation.  It was delicious! You get three hard boiled eggs in a savory, tangy curry, and it goes really well with the coconut rice.  I couldn't finish it, but I wish I did because it did not fare well as leftovers (except for the rice).  So if you order this dish, make sure you eat it there.  I would order this dish again though, because it's $8.50, much cheaper than the $13.50 for two eggs with curry I've had at another restaurant.\n\nThe food is quick, and service is friendly.  And I have to give them props for their decor.  The wall is lined with paper plates that are dyed in different, bold colors.  A good diy option for decor on a budget.  The space is small, but it's never crowded, which I like.  I can't stand having the feeling of being rushed to eat dinner.\n\nI read some of the other reviews regarding the tea leaf salad, and I will have to try that next time I'm here.

For the salad flavor here, it really doesn't compare to Burma Superstar. Drier here and more bitter with less depth of flavor than at other places, unfortunately. \n\nI really liked the milk tea I got, though it seemed like maybe it was just English Breakfast with extra cream in it and the portion could have been better for the price on this one.\n\nMy brother got the pork curry and there was so much meat. Lots of bang for your buck portio-wise on this dish. My dad and I split the Spicy Lady Fingers (okra) and got 3 different types of rices for each of our dishes. The Spicy Lady Finger pulled through with actually being spicy, which I always appreciate.\n\nWe also got a side of roti that for some reason came as we were finishing our main courses but it was really good.

Style Signature Tea Leaf Salad (homestyle with extra fermented tea leaf, fried garlic, sesame seeds, shredded cabbage, assorted peas & peanuts, $9.75): Frankly I'm not sure if the extra $2 is worth it over the regular tea leaf salad; I was just enticed by the name. It is definitely one of the most flavorful tea leaf salads I've ever had--pungently aromatic tea leaf, blended into multidimensional character with the assorted peas, topped with a flamboyant coating of sesame seeds. It comes already mixed so it may look as good as other restaurants where all the ingredients are presented in little piles, but the taste is exquisitely exotic.\n\n(++) Ong Noh Kau Swel (coconut chicken soup egg noodle, diced chicken in coconut broth, fried split peas, and hard boil egg, $9.50): An outstandingly balanced coconut soup--just the right amount of coconut without being too creamy. It could have used more chicken, but the soft noodles and overall composition of comforting ingredients essentially make this fancy chicken noodle soup.\n\n(++) Pork Curry (Pork with pureed onion, garlic, mustard seeds & spices, $8.50): The slow-cooked tender pork and housemade blend of curry make this memorable despite its plain name and presentation. I really like how the curry is vegetable based so it's satisfying but light.\n\nCompared to other Burmese places Burmese Kitchen is a little more more hole-in-the-wall, and by hole-in-the-wall, I just mean in size and fame. It's a smaller place and not as frequently discussed as Burma Superstar or Mandalay, but nonetheless a nice restaurant with a relaxing and refined ambiance (though they could do away with the collage of painted paper plates).", "author": "Edna C."}

The coconut rice is here is just amazing - it has a strong coconut scent and flavor which pairs well with almost all the dishes here, especially the Tamarind Fish. The Tamarind fish is a white fish fillet covered with a tamarind/onion/garlic puree. It's perfectly sweet, sour, and salty with a little spicy kick to it. \n\nClose runner ups:\nTamarind Leaf Salad - one of my favorite things to eat and hard to find anywhere - young tamarind leaves, onions, peanuts, and spices. It has that nice crunch and sweet/sourness that is so prevalent in Burmese food.\n\nTea Leaf Salad - your standard Tea Leaf salad that's in all Burmese restaurants. I find theirs to be less salty than the rest of the field, which is a good thing.\n\nGarlic Chicken - cooked with turmeric, lemongrass, minced garlic, bell pepper, & onion, the chicken is super tender and flavorful. Tastes great along with coconut rice. \n\nI love how this place has the local family feel rather than the trussed up western fusion feel. Also, prices are reasonable compared to some other more popular Burmese places.", "author": "Henry W."}

Burma Superstar is a bit too far to walk and I often try to avoid the cliched Clement Street anyhow. Our sushi place on Arguello is closed for a week (what?!), Cha Cha Cha is a bit far to walk and probably too crowded. In situations like this, Yelp came to the rescue. I've read about this place, it's a respectful walk of 0.5 miles from the nap joint. Decided to take a walk and give this place a swirl. Is it different from Burma Superstar and Mandalay? I wondered.\n\nIt has a lot of Indian influence. Whereas Madalay on California and 6th is more Chinese influenced. Try to avoid Burma Superstar whenever I can as I don't like waiting in line. Wiki'ed Burmese cuisine and I understood its food are influenced by both, as they boarder both countries. Tea leaf salad is great. Very protein rich even though it is vegetarian. There were a lot of different type of nuts. Most unusual is the sprouted beans. Pork with pickled mango a bit bizarre but definitely interesting. Plus the pork was super tender. Again, it felt a certain version of Indian. Coconut rice was however very fluffy and more southeast Asian.\n\nBurmese coffee was mellow with a hint of sweetness to it (tell your wait staff to not put too much sugar or condensed milk in it). \n\nThere are a number of other things I'd try off the menu. It's a good way to give your body enough of a jolt to start the evening. \n\nWe took our time to eat and then exited the restaurant as people started to drizzle in. The wind had picked up. You can hear the fog horn from afar. the sun had gone back into the cloud. A very quiet Saturday afternoon in this quiet Inner Richmond neighborhood. It's hard to imagine how many restaurants are within one mile radius from where we were.  I felt happy and content once again. This place serves yummy food. A keeper.", "author": "Victoria E."}

And they're clearly marked and called out in the descriptions!\n\nFood: 4 Stars\n1. B.K. Style Signature Tea Leaf Salad: A unique version of the ubiquitous tea leaf salad. a. The tea leaves, traditional in that they weren't diced, were extra fermented--it was more chewy than others, b. less cabbage, c. more nuts! (first time I've seen edamame seeds on this type of salad). The proportions b/w the three was different which made this TLS memorable.\n\n2. Samosas Soup: Karl the Fog visited and this soup was perfect for tonight's weather. It was hearty, warm, and spiced w/ turmeric. The soup also had well-fried falafels (which I rarely see in this soup type) and crunchy cabbage for additional texture.\n\n3. Spicy Lotus Roots: We decided on this since I've never seen it on a Burmese menu. The roots were well flavored. Texturally, I was craving something to counterbalance the crunchiness of the roots. But that's just my Western sensibilities talking! I checked and this is how this dish is usually made. Try this dish if you're looking for something different from the usual, especially since this is the first Burmese restau I've been to that serves this dish in this way.\n\nRepeatability Factor: 4 Stars\nTotally. Another win for the Burmese community. And tea leaf salads are my current comfort food.", "author": "Jay C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-01", "description": "Our first time here, and we ordered: BK Signature Tea Leaf salad, Samosa soup, and Spicy lotus root.\n\nTea leaf salad - different than most tea leaf salads i've had. One criticism is that the tea leaves did not have enough oil and was overpowered and dominated by the seeds and nuts. It was a different take on tea leaf salad which we appreciated; the roasted seeds and nuts (including edamame, yellow peas, peanuts) all tasted good and were crispy which we enjoyed, but again it was perhaps too much, where you could not taste the tea leaves as much.\n\nSamosa soup - first time to have samosa soup, which had pieces of falafel and samosas in there, along with potatoes, cabbage, yellow peas. It was an enjoyable soup with decently balanced flavor. I could have done without the cabbage though; I generally love cabbage, but it didn't add anything to this particular dish, though I'm not sure if it's traditionally made with cabbage or not.\n\nSpicy lotus root - also a different dish. The lotus root retained the soy sauce flavor well, which is impressive considering how hard it is to retain flavor with the lotus root. Caution, this was a really spicy dish. I like spicy food, and had a hard time with how spicy it was. \n\nSeveral white and red wine selections at a nice price of $6 per glass. There were a lot of vegan and vegetarian options.\n\nA solid 3.5-4 for me, and would likely repeat to try some other dishes.", "author": "Will H."}

The eggplant dish was giant slimy chunks of greenish gray eggplant and the pumpkin stew looked like baby food. They were both almost inedible. A terrible texture and very little flavor. The rest was mediocre at best. We ended up throwing a lot away because it just wasn't worth eating.\nWhen we walked in to pick up our order, the guy at the front asked if we were excited to try Burmese food. We told them that we actually really like Burmese food and his face fell. After tasting their food, I definitely got the feeling that they were trying to cash in on the popularity of Burma Superstar and Mandalay, but this tastes nothing like the food at either of those restaurants.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-04-14", "description": "We stopped by Burmese Kitchen on Saturday night around 7:30 after being told that the wait at Burma Superstar would be about 2 hours. I kind of wish I had waited, but then I wouldn't have eaten until 9:30... Burmese Kitchen is small, but bustling. It looked like a lot of other people had the same idea of avoiding the wait and getting their food NOW. \n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty small, with a signup sheet attached to the door and two extra chairs just inside, but no real designated waiting area. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated, when the first wave of diners seemed to all finish up at the same time. Their tables are all a bunch of two-tops that they can move as needed to accommodate larger parties. Unfortunately, the corner table we were given was really close to the other two-top. So close that when the hostess came by to take our orders, she had to wedge herself between the two tables. Also, when she was taking orders for the table next to us, she definitely kept hitting me in the shoulder. I think that they could make it a much better dining experience if they removed one of the two-tops from that row. \n\nAs for the food, we ordered the tea leaf salad, a roti with yellow potato curry, the mohinga, and garlic noodles with chicken. None of it was really that good.\n\nThe tea leaf salad was mostly nuts and lentils, and while I liked the crunch of it, I could tell that it wasn't freshly made because it came pre-mixed, versus the presentation I much prefer where they have small piles of each ingredient that they mix in front of you or let you mix yourself. It tasted pretty good, but I wouldn't really call it a salad given the lack of vegetables and leafy greens. \n\nThe roti and curry were good, but disappointing in the disproportionate amount of roti to curry: only one roti, though you can order an additional roti for $4. For the small size, I didn't think it was worth it. The curry was underseasoned, even if the potatoes were cooked through, they had no taste, no spice, no flavor. \n\nThe mohinga was okay, but also rather bland. The noodles were beyond overcooked to the point of dissolving in my mouth at each bite. I couldn't really taste any of the fish, maybe it dissolved as well? I did like the crispy lentil cakes, which added the only texture found in the soup. \n\nMy garlic noodles were a HUGE disappointment, so bland and fishy tasting, even though I added chicken. The chicken was old and chewy and had an off flavor, and it didn't mix well with the noodles. The noodles themselves were like thin-cut egg noodles that clumped together and had absolutely no flavor. The only texture came from the fried garlic that garnished the dish, but quickly fell off. I would never recommend ordering this to anyone, especially not at $10 a pop. \n\nI would say that we made the wrong choice in coming to Burmese Kitchen instead of waiting for Burma Superstar. $42 including tax and tip, and so not worth it. The touted friendly service never made an appearance during our visit, but maybe it's because they were super understaffed and trying to rush diners in and out as quickly as possible.", "author": "Leslie H."}

Spoiler alert: we thoroughly enjoyed their food at their new location as well.\n\nActually I quite like their new digs. The restaurant seems brighter and there's a nice ambiance to the place. Other people mentioned \"high\" prices but I found their prices to be pretty reasonable. We came here with six people and spent less than $200 including tip and $20 corkage fee for two bottles of wine ($10/bottle). Also they do a brisk take-out business so definitely not too pricey.\n\nAnyways, like I said, the food was quite good. There were a couple of misses, but their menu is extensive so that's to be expected. I think all-in-all their food stacks up nicely to both Burma Superstar and Mandalay. The standouts: the tea leaf salad (the best some of us have ever had), falafel, pork with sauerkraut (I know!), and fish noodle chowder.\n\nDownside: Service was actually a bit spotty for us.

I have had tea lead salad from various Burmese restaurants, but I like theirs the best because it is crunchier than others (they must have more nuts and seeds).  They also have slices of serrano peppers on the side, if you wanted it a bit more spicy.\n\nMy other favorite here is Pork and Pumpkin.  You may think it's weird to have pumpkin in a savory dish, but it is truly yummy with pork.  Theirs is really saucey, so try it.  It has never failed me.\n\nEvery time we go to this place, we always explore different dish as the other entree dish.  This time, we tried Beef Dal.  I am not much of beans/peas person, and it was OK.

Quaint and small eatery that produces some tasty and spicy dishes.  Started out with the tea leaf salad, it was tasty but too much chewing for my tastes. The dish contains a lot of assorted peas and peanuts, hence the chewing. We also tried the rainbow salad, it was different from other places. Not bad but it was wetter than I remembered. It was delicious though. We ordered the garlic chicken and the pork chana del for our entrees. The garlic chicken had a lot of flavor and a nice little kick to it. Chunks of tender breast meat with our cloves of garlic and lemon grass infused throughout the dish. Pairs well with rice. The pork chana del was very saucy and had a lot of yellow split peas and that dish goes well with rice also. Even though the dishes looks small when it comes out, you will be stuffed!

Both of my parents are from Burma and are pretty active in the Burmese community in the Bay Area so I'm always skeptical when it comes to Burmese food.  The first and last restaurant I went to was Rangoon Ruby in Palo Alto and was fairly unimpressed in terms of quality per dollar. So I went to Burmese Kitchen with low expectations and had them shattered.\n\nI went with three of my friends and decided to order family style.  We got the tea leaf salad, coconut chicken soup, spicy fish, chicken curry, and chin baung jaw shrimp & sour leaf.\n\nIf this isn't highlighted enough in the other reviews, the tea leaf salad was AMAZING!  I was extremely impressed how fresh the leaves were and how flavorful the marinate was.  We only ordered one dish for the four of us and it wasn't enough.  I'd recommend 1 for every 2 people unless you plan on filling up with a variety of dishes.\n\nCoconut chicken soup is probably one of my favorite burmese dishes because it's almost at every family party I've been to so my relatives get a lot of practice making it.  While it was still pretty good at Burmese kitchen, I wasn't mind blown.  But again, it's hard for me to judge.

This is definitely a dish I'd get the next time I come here.  The chicken was very tender and would fall off the bone and paired perfectly with the rice.  The fish was a little too hot for someone in our group, but if you're fine with spicy food it was this is also a must!\n\nIf you're looking for something uniquely Burmese, I'd give the chin baung jaw shrimp & sour leaf a try.  Admittedly it was a little weird for two of my friends since sour food isn't really popular in most cultures but if you want to be adventurous I think this is definitely something different.\n\ntldr; The must haves are the tea leaf salad and coconut rice with chicken (and spicy fish if you can handle heat).  \nIf you want to try something more unique to Burmese culture try the coconut chicken soup but stay safe and if you're adventurous the chin baung jaw.", "author": "Edric K."}

The chicken curry was bland and you'll have to order rice separately cause it doesn't come with any.

And don't be fooled by the small box, they fit in a lot of rice in those things. So, if you're only 2 people, it'll be too much.\n\nSamosas- my favorite of the dishes. Nice and crispy with a potato filling. The sauce that came with it wasn't too spicy either, just enough to get a kick.\n\nCoconut chicken soup- too thick and also lacked the chicken and coconut.\n\nLemongrass beef- really hard to cut, but had good flavor and the lemongrass was evident.\n\nGarlic noodles- very garlicy, and the noodles lasted well despite not being eaten for a day.  The second star of the meal\n\nPumpkin prawns- the least favorite.

My only wish is that they serve it with more roti, but that can be easily solved by ordering 2! :)\n\nTea leaf salad - When we've ordered this at the old location, it was good.  But when we ordered it this time, the flavors seemed to be brighter, fresher, fuller.  Normally when we would take friends to their previous location, we'd get this just because it is a Burmese staple, but now, I can confidently say that this is THE BEST tea leaf salad I've ever had in the bay area!\n\nMohinga - fish chowder - A very hearty soup dish that can be eaten as a main dish or shared between 3-4 people.\n\nDan Pauk - biryani chicken - My hubby's favorite and this was no exception.  The rice is cooked to perfection and the chicken  wonderfully seasoned with curry and other spices.\n\nSpicy fish - The fish is lightly fried and served with a chili/garlic sauce. If you can't handle the heat though, maybe skip this or be sure the rest of your group can.  Hehe.\n\nChicken curry - can't go wrong with chicken curry!\n\nCoconut rice - This pairs so well with the chicken curry. If you like coconut milk, this is a must try! Don't be afraid, it's not too sweet.  It's a light flavor of coconut milk that's slightly toasted/nutty.\n\nService is great.  Attentive staff without being overbearing.

It was definitely delicious, but the only thing was that it was a small portion. We ended up having to order 2 of them to have enough for 3 people. The fish chowder was delicious, was spicier than I had anticipated it would be, but was still manageable. We also ordered the lady fingers (okra), which was a nice veggie dish. Overall, this place was a pretty good Burmese restaurant - definitely a place to try if you'd like to try Burmese food and avoid the long line at Burma Superstar.", "author": "Kyle S."}

However, there were some disappointments and I won't be ordering from them again. First, they forgot one of our dishes despite us being charged for it. We had to call them and ask about it. We ended up getting a refund for that dish but it was kind of a hassle and we were looking forward to that entree :( The second disappointment, which to me is the main dealbreaker, is the portion sizes. I thought the prices were so reasonable until we saw the amount of food. Let's just say we spent $65 before tax/tip/delivery fee, and we had zero leftovers after the 2 of us had dinner. I was really surprised at the small quantities, and won't repeat business based on that.", "author": "Anna J."}

The restaurant itself is intimate, a great spot for a date night. The orange wall and clean wooden tables give it a nice modern look while still remaining comfy and welcoming.\n\nWe had: \n\nTea Leaf Salad--Best one in the city, and we've tried them all. It isn't too spicy, is a great portion, and very flavorful.\n\nSamosas--So good! Not greasy at all, and stuffed with deliciously seasoned potatoes and peas...\n\nRoti--Thousand layer bread, so delicate and flaky. mmm\n\nBeef & Potato Curry--The beef was so tender and juicy--it melted in your mouth. The potatoes were hot and perfectly cooked, and the curry spices were just right. Exactly what we were looking for on a cold, rainy SF night. \n\nTapioca Pudding--brought my fiancee back to her childhood. It was prepared just like her grandma used to make, warm with a bit of coconut/condensed milk. She was in heaven.\n\nAnd our server--Lee was very sweet to take a few minutes to chat with us about the old location and the new one. She was quick and very busy with many full tables!\n\nOverall--they prices were fair for the right amount of food, and you can taste the love and family recipes.

Although it's busy, it's still fairly new so not too many people know about it (which is great because I frankly hate waiting in lines!). Coming back here next week for round three! See below for recommended orders.\n\nWhat we loved:\nTea Leaf Salad. This is light yet hardy, fresh and delicious. \nRoti & Potato Curry: this was a wild card for us but turned out to be excellent! Very filling and flavorful.\nChin Baung Hin Yay Fish & Sour Leaf: This is SPICY and so delicious. I'm not a fan of fish soups but this was seriously so good! Incredibly flavorful, not overpowering, spicy - but just the right amount, and hardy! \nGarlic Chicken: three other tables ordered the same thing and each of us were in awe at how perfectly tender and delicious this dish was.

It's also great that you don't have to wait in line for an hour! If you're a vegetarian you will be very satisfied by the options at Burmese Kitchen: Vegetarian food doesn't get more delicious and nutritious than this! We especially love the Golden Tofu Salad, which is unlike anything we'd ever tried before. Not to be confused with standard tofu made from soybeans, this tofu is made in house from yellow beans. I'm not sure what goes into the salad (fried onions, definitely) but it is so rich and tasty I could easily eat it every day. The tea leaf salad is amazing too (order the signature one for an extra generous helping of tea leaves), as is the tamarind salad, the samusas and the roti. If you eat seafood and enjoy spice you may like the spicy fish, fish soup with sour vegetables, or fish chowder (more mild). The pumpkin prawns are good too. Because my husband doesn't eat meat other than seafood, we haven't really tried many of the meat options, though some friends did order a chicken stew of some kind that they seemed to really enjoy. \nAs a final note, we love the management here!

We started with the tea leaf salad, which was very tasty.  You could really taste the fermented tea leaves and that contrasted really well with the crispy peas, peanuts, cabbage, & garlic chips. Next we had the roti with the yellow potato curry.  We both commented that it was excellent comfort food. The bread was nice and hot, and there were big chunks of potato in the curry. The roti was pretty small, so we had to eat some curry without bread, but it was still excellent. Next came the garlic egg noodles. They weren't very special - definitely the least inspired dish, but I did like the crispy garlic in it.  Finally we had the lemongrass beef. I don't think I've ever had this dish before, so the closest comparison I can come up with is mas-su-man beef.  It was the same style of stewed beef, with a similar type of gravy on it, but with a milder flavor. \nIt's a cute little restaurant and the service was quick and friendly. We'll definitely be back and this time order two of the tea salads and two of the roti with the yellow potato curry.", "author": "Quentin J."}

But the walk was too far. We decided instead to just walk across the street to the \"grand opening\" of Burmese Kitchen. Big mistake. \n\nI didn't care for the dingy bathroom, which I had to use before lunch. But whatever...\nWhen the roti and curry arrived, I was like, 'where is the rest of the roti?'. I've NEVER been served ONE roti bread at a time. Must be a Burmese thing. Oh well... the roti and sauce was good though. \n\nI ordered the tamarind fish soup which was absolutely AWFUL. The spices didn't blend well together. I couldn't make out what was what, just a bunch of seasonings which still failed to make the dish savory. \n\nMy husband ordered the ginger chicken with fried rice. The chicken was rubbery and dry,  smothered in a dark reddish-brown ginger-ish sauce. Again, strange seasoning marinated in stale meat, equals BAD combination. Not impressed. \n\nHubby also ordered fried rice. Not impressed either. The serving was small and barely covered the plate. I guess that was a good thing, as it didn't taste all that good either. Its not your standard fried rice, it was a brownish looking rice with a few beans in it. That's it. It would help if the servers would explain what their 'fried rice' is before one orders. \n\nWe ordered a plate of coconut rice. THat was the best dish, after the roti and curry appetizer. Nothing crazy good about it, it just wasn't BAD like all the other fails. The only complaint was the scanty serving though.\n\nI didn't even go into the ditzy waitress we had.

However, Burmese Kitchen is a great place to take your friends out and try different things on the menu because hey, Burmese restaurants are pretty rare.  This place has legit Burmese food and reminds me of everything I love about Burmese cuisines.\n\nRoti and Curry - Delicious!  The roti is a thicker kind and it's delicious with almost anything, in this case, potato curry!  Vegetarian option.\n\nMohinga - international dish of Burma.  I tried this dish in other Burmese restaurants, but this one hits home.  It's burmese catfish soup with noodle and fried yellow pea.  This dish is eaten as breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner in Burma.  \n\nCoconut chicken curry (Oh nok kaw swe) - I personally prefer this over mohinga.  Both are very delicious.\n\nTea leaf salad - this dish is hyped here more than in Burma.  It's a mix of tea leaf, nuts, sesame, some veggies, and tomato.  It's fresh and uniquely Burmese.\n\nFish with Tamarine Sauce - this was my favorite dish.  The fish was tender and had the perfect flavor with rice.  Highly recommended!\n\nOther dishes to consider:\n- Pork with Pickled Mango\n- Spicy shrimp\n- Nan Ji Thok - rice noodle mixed with veggies and chicken.  This doesn't come in soup, but is still tasty!\n- Burmese tea - Burmese tea houses are big in Burma (similar to tea houses in China).

The food was Burmese allright but did not measure up to The BStar or Mingalaba. Spices were too mild. To make the experience further uncomfortable, there were too many fruit flies in our face all night..This may be a good place for take out if you like certain items on the menu but we did not enjoy sitting and dining there.", "author": "Ravi S."}

Imagine my delight when they re-opened in my neighborhood! Yay!\n\nThe food is fabulous and the prices are reasonable, this place is so much better than Superstar or Mandalay. I've been working my way through the menu (except for pork & beef) and haven't had a bad thing yet, although I don't recommend getting samosas for takeout because they get soggy when they get cold. Most things have been good, some even spectacular. I wasn't terribly impressed with the pumpkin stew but it was my personal taste, not anything they did wrong. Favorites are the tea leaf salad (always fresh & with plenty of tea leaves) and garlic noodles and potato curry and the fried combo starter. Yum.", "author": "Stacey H."}

A few years ago we traveled through myanmar together and at that moment we were craving some burmese food :) We ordered the tamarind fish, ohn noh khao swhe (spelling check) and a bowl of mohinga. Everything was fantastic! The fish was so good we ordered a second plate!", "author": "Anthony R."}

We were impressed, especially with the fish chowder noodle soup and flavorful curry chicken! We'll be going back to try other dishes. We ordered the Balachan/Malachan to go. This tastes so good just over plain rice! \nThere were eight of us. The service was friendly and efficient. Go check it out!", "author": "A L."}

I loved the garlic chicken with large pieces of chicken and garlic, and vegetables with rice that was soft and moist, and the noodles were good yet I thought that they could have some additional spice and flavor. Leigh, the owner, was friendly and helpful. My friend ordered a Tamarind salad and said she could not find this salad at other Burmese places (not sure how many she checked). The homemade iced tea was delicious. The place is casual. They moved from the downtown area and I like it better in the Richmond area. A family style place.", "author": "Donna C."}

This was the first Burmese food I've had that actually reminded me of the food I had in Myanmar. The salads are not as pretty as Burma Superstar but taste more authentic. We had the Roti, Tamarind leaf salad, tamarind fish and coconut chicken noodle soup. All delicious. The table next to us had a huge plate of biriani that looked really tasty. I need to come back!  Prices are very reasonable and beers are $3.50. There's wine by the glass for $6 but it isn't very good.  The service is well intentioned but forgetful. We had to remind them about what we ordered and they forgot a few things. But it was a busy Friday night and there was a big table of 8 having a birthday.", "author": "Priscilla C."}

There are 3 other, better (for the same price) Burmese restaurants within a 2-3 minute walk. Since they're a \"pop-up\", the place has a temporary feel and looked dark and somewhat dingy (front window was filthy). Service was mediocre. Food was ok, nothing special for Burmese.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-12", "description": "I rarely eat out for Burmese food. My parents are from Burma, so I tend to be disappointed with the Burmese restaurants out there. However, I was utterly surprised at how authentic the food is here. My friends enjoy Burmese cuisine, so we decided to come to Burmese Kitchen based off of the reviews. We ordered family style and everyone, including myself, was beyond satisfied with this decision. Like the reviews mention, the tea leaf salad is one of the best that I've had; it's just like the home-made ones. Of all of the dishes, my favorite was the fish noodle soup (mohinga), the biryani rice with chicken, and the shrimp and sour leaf. My friends loved the coconut noodle soup and spicy fish. To be honest, everything that we ate was delicious. They could not stop raving about the food and how it was one of the best they've had in the city. Also, I found out that Burmese Kitchen caters. I would definitely consider ordering some dishes for my next work potluck event. Everyone always asks me to bring home-made Burmese cuisine. I've found a place that I would be happy to vouch for as authentic.", "author": "Carolyn L."}

I went for lunch on a Sunday and had an excellent meal. The service was lovely and food was amazing. We started with the special BK tea leaf salad which is like normal tea leaf salad with extra tea leaves so it has a more intense flavor that I really enjoyed. We also ordered roti with curry, nan gyi thok, coconut rice, okra, and the pickled mango pork. Everything was great but the pork was absolutely delicious- flavorful, tender, and a tiny bit sour. I highly recommend!", "author": "Natalie G."}

The food is most excellent and there is no line to get in. I usually go with take out after work so I can't say much of the wait staff except that everyone has been nothing but genuinely nice every time I've been in. The Tea leaf salad is covered in sesame seed goodness, the Garlic Chicken is amazing with the Coconut rice.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-26", "description": "This restaurant used to be in the Tenderloin; the Inner Richmond location is new. We were greeted by a very homey atmosphere, with the music turned just a little lower than the volume of conversation, and no greeter/gatekeeper at the door. But the waiter was attentive and seated us right away. The tea was a good temperature, properly steeped, and happened to be imported from Burma. We ordered a tea leaf salad, the samusa soup and the boiled eggs in tamarind sauce. The salad cannot compare to the famed tea lead salad of Burma Superstar lore, but it was reasonably good. The samusa soup was tasty and very healthy. The boiled eggs in tamarind sauce was a new experience, and tasted much like an Indian curry. Very flavorful and highly recommended. The service was very friendly and helpful - even engaging us in conversation long after the other customers had left and never making us feel like it was time to go (despite the fact that we stayed quite late!).", "author": "Nikhil V."}
