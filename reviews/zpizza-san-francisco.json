Do you know there are 50+ locations, even in South Korea, UAE, Vietnam, and Kingdom of Bahrain?  So, no, it's not a little boutique, family-owned, pizza joint.\n\nDelivered directly thru my Yelp app on Samsung and fulfilled by Grubhub, I am full of namedropping today.  The ordering was easy, and for $23 with 6 toppings, my small pizza was delivered to my hotel room in a jiffy (okay, 45 mins).\n\nThe delivery guy was casual, and just holding the cardboard box in-hand. I was expecting it to be pulled out of a pizza warming bag, so it's received hot and steamy.  Instead, it was lukewarm at best.\n\nBut cool pizza has its benefits.  You can literally eat a whole small pizza in about 6 minutes.  No blowing each bite.  No biting small.  No biting on the ends.  You can get into trouble quickly, and I'm not opposed to that.\n\nI ordered a small pizza with Organic Tomato Sauce, Pepperoni, Avocado, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Mushrooms, Artichoke Hearts, and Caramelized Onions.  To be frank, it was quite good -- love the medium crust with quality ingredients. To be elizabeth (or insert any other name other than frank, otherwise this humor doesn't work), I was underwhelmed with the quantity of the ingredients, very sparingly done.  It's like I paid for more ingredients, but it's like the divided the ingredients to make that much less per.\n\nThere's lots more pizza places to try, but this is a good one...no matter your location, language, or country.", "author": "Randy B."}

I like the vibe in here, it's convenient. \n\nThey use fresh ingredients, but the pizza is missing something I feel like. Plus I hate how hot it is after they reheat it. Meh. \n\nYou'll have to take my review with a grain of salt because I was raised on the east coast and the pizza around here I just hate in general. \n\nHowever, I think easily if I was to think of pizza places, Tony's, Golden Boys, and Patzi all got this place beat in spades.", "author": "John W."}

I think you can buy by slice too. Several bottled beers available. The girl working up front is friendly & keeps busy cleaning when no customers ordering.  She always has a smile on her face.  She also checks on customers to see if they're enjoying their pizza. I like that whenever I've been here it's not super busy.  The restroom is kept locked. Ask for the key if you need to use it; it doesn't say that on the door. \nThey do a lot of takeout business here. \nSo stop by here if you're hungry at meal time & want to go where there's not a long line.

As a freshly transplanted New Yorker, I was hungering for a good old NYC slice, and Z delivered on that plus more. \n\nFast forward 30 years and Sid has franchised the concept, with zpizza branches sprouting up nationwide. Fortunately, it is not bad! Compared to other pizza chains it's mostly like Sbarro, but with better fresher ingredients and thinner crust cooked well. \n\nI sampled both cheese and pepperoni, my favorites, and my main complaint was a bit too much cheese, making it hard to fold. You might find that a plus and not a minus. I like that they always have a few slice choices, and of course you can always get a personal pizza exactly to your liking. \n\nCheck out the pepper infused olive oil, still part of the zpizza tradition after all these years. If you're around the 5th and Mission garage stop in for a slice and PLEASE let me know what you think. \n\nI kind of hope they get a marin location going.", "author": "Mike K."}

So, when you become Vegan, you're assumed to be SOL when it comes to having a great experience with pizza in this city. No more Tony's, no more Golden Boys (not that that was really any good..) No more a lot of things...but zpizza reopens that door for Vegans again. I mean, sure, they use Daiya cheese when they should use Follow Your Heart cheese, but whatever, I'll take it. They have a Vegan sausage crumble and it's fire roasted pizza people! Yes! So here's what I do since I absolutely hate zucchini's and refuse to order their Berkley pizza. I get a custom large (large because I feel like they pack it with a better ratio of ingredients), vegan sausage, daiya cheese, cremini mushrooms, and a side of arugula. This will run you a little under $30 for delivery. When I get the pizza at home, I'll put slices of thin red onion, and avocado over it, and toast it back for a couple of minutes...oh, and also the pine nuts because that adds a little more \"porky\" flavor to the sausage. Pure Vegan Gold. Okay fellow Vegans, have fun. This place is 10x better tasting than Patxi's.

When I went back yesterday and bought a drink, I explained the incident to Holly (she was present when this took place), and she merely gave me a blank look and shrugged.  \n\nI will never return to this restaurant again.  The customer service is horrible, and they make no effort at righting wrongs. Moreover, the pizza is absolutely mediocre.  It was cold and lacked flavor.  There are many pizzerias in the Mission and the Tenderloin.  I implore you to AVOID Z Pizza at any and all costs--go where they food is good and they treat their customers right.", "author": "Victor B."}

But this restaurant proved that it is possible to make good California pizza where the dough is still semi thick but has a very slight smoky taste to it and just the right amount of crunch that makes pizza taste so good. I got the Thai Chicken Pizza, which was made in California a f it was very good. I also really liked how you can order online and the pizza is ready within 20-30 minutes which is just enough time to walk there and sit down and eat.

It is full of flavor, a crispy crust and the right sauce and spices to make it super tasty, even if you, like myself, are not a Diaya cheese fan (under other circumstances I usually can't stand it).  I order the Berkeley with added pineapples.  My family loves to eat it too whenever they are in town.  \n\nAnother vegan option is the Yuppie Sub sandwich without cheese and adding their Diaya.  That is so good as well, especially the caramelized onions.  They have a good selection of pizzas for anyone (and if you don't like pizza, you can have a sandwich or salad).  \n\nThe restaurant itself is very casual and they tend to play good classic rock music.  The staff is always friendly.  \n\nOne thing I don't love about this place is that they no longer offer delivery in my area.  I haven't eaten at Zpizza in a long time as a result.  Customer service mentioned other delivery options but when I searched for them there was a message that the delivery was not available (this was at 7 pm).

What's more fulfilling than a four-speed vibrator with a blinking light? A thin-crust pizza, of course, with lots of fresh toppings. It's similar to Gialina's in Glen Park but more modest in execution. Jamie W. showed his resourcefulness by finding a $5 coupon online, so we went to town tonight. \n\nFrom the Classics side of the menu, we tried the $19.95 Large American Pizza, especially tasty since it was dominated by fresh tomato slices, bell peppers and red onions. It had a thin layer of organic tomato sauce and the regular kitchen-sink assortment of mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms (see photo). We wanted to try one of their zpizza creations, so we went for the $10.95 Small Casablanca, which tasted more Sicilian than Moroccan with roasted garlic sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and Parmesan (see photo). It was zingy and a tad salty, but a small one was just the right chaser. \n\nI look forward to trying more in the future when they get more into their game. Like all new operations, the staff was green and enthusiastic, and we saw them gather around the creation of our pizzas like paisans-in-training. While pizza dominates the menu, they also serve salads, sandwiches, a couple of pastas and even a Mediterranean plate. This appears to be part of a big chain with franchises in even Saudi Arabia and Vietnam. Definitely a new fast-food destination for us... if only they were a little faster making their pizzas. Open until 10PM, a big plus. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...satisfying pizza with fresh toppings and fire-baked flatbread crust \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...standard suburban mall-like look \nSERVICE - 3 stars...enthusiastic, hopefully they'll pick up the pace \nTOTAL - 4 stars...Pizza, Pizza!", "author": "Ed U."}

So far any gluten-free food I've ingested tastes like toothpaste, rubber, tree bark, or clearly didn't resemble the flavor described.  At first sight, gluten-free was my first word association with Zpizza.  \n\nI saw this particular Zpizza walking by after a night downtown.  Did some Google investigating and found out this organization originated in Southern California.  Their aim is to serve pizza with \"fresh\" and \"healthier\" ingredients.  They also have the option that I dread, gluten-free.   \n\nThey serve by the slice and pizzas by the whole, along with some sandwiches.  The feel exudes of a variant of Pizza My Heart.  Among the variety of nicknamed choices, I got a small Mexican.  The small serves one to two people, as the pizza did just that.  Satisfying wouldn't be a good word to describe it, but it filled the tank.  There weren't \"healthy\" side effects that changed the flavor.  The thin crust pizza was sliced into four quarter pieces and the ingredients appeared fresh as advertised with only the sour cream being a little suspect.        \n\nI would grab a slice from here again if I'm in a hurry and in the vicinity.  Without that statistical event involved, chances are slim I'll actually return.  Zpizza does deliver a healthier option, but there's just something about healthy pizza that doesn't cut it when appraising levels of taste.

And most of the places that offer gluten free pizza are not that good.  That's why I was a little reluctant to believe all the hype about Z Pizza when I heard they made Gluten Free Pizza and were part of a chain.  Even when I checked out the website they were pitching buying a franchise.  I was pleasantly surprised by the Pizza being as good as it was.  The pizza was fresh made where as some places that offer gluten free seem to be pre-made.  There were plenty of choices for toppings and were fresh.\n\nNow for the bad.  You can only get a small pizza gluten free and it's going to cost about $15, which isn't cheap.  We guessed one wouldn't be enough for my wife and I and fortunately we ordered two.  We ordered the American and the Santa Fe, both of which were tasty.  The pizzas were small and I'd have liked some more sauce and toppings, but they are small and that's they only size they come.  At least it's one more option for my diet and I won't be doing it all the time due to the expense, but for a once in while treat it's not bad and I'm sure we'll be back to try some of their other options.\n\nWe had the Pizzas delivered so I can't tell you about the restaurant.  Also know they charge $2 for delivery, which I didn't find out if the restaurant keeps or the delivery guys gets.", "author": "Scott L."}

We wanted to order a vegan pizza and found this place. I liked they have gluten free crust and go beyond the usual veggie pizza. \nWe were told our pizza would take about 15 minutes which we didn't mind. After almost 30 minutes I was ready to ask about the food. What my partner noticed that I didn't, was that the waiter gave two men who were dining in, OUR pizza.\nWe knew it was ours, it had the exact ingredients we ordered. When I walked up to the cashier he and the waiter pretty much knew they made a mistake.\n\nSo the two guys are busy eating OUR pizza and had already ordered TWO of their own. Honestly shows what kind of greedy fucks they are and how they are inconsiderate of other customers. To anyone that thinks it's okay to eat someone else's food, realize your selfishness is the reason they have to wait longer...pray someone doesn't slap their food out of your hand. Be considerate folks.\n\nBut since we are cool, laid back folks, we knew their mistake could've been easily resolved had the other customers said it wasn't their food. Soooooo we didn't hold it against them.\n\nWhile waiting, the cashier gave us some drinks so we were cool. We thought after an hour, let's eat here only to find they were closing. They were fine with us staying but honestly I wanted to eat home. So we left.\n\nA week or so later, we returned to Z Pizza, hoping for a different experience. Food was on time, no greedy fucks to eat food they didn't order so we went home.\n\nHere's the thing, their CRUST is too thin and flimsy. They did NOT cut the slices evenly. My pieces were too big and my partner's were too small. I've had better pizza, thin and thick. And we both felt a little sick afterwards, so based on our second experience, we will not be returning. I know there's better somewhere else. We didn't finish the pizza and gave it to a homeless woman. I am not sure if that was the right thing to do! \n\nIf you are not looking for much out of a pizza, this may be the place for you. Please beware of the greedy fucks at this restaurant and others. lol", "author": "Ray B."}

The pizzas looked great, but the taste...not so much. Despite being loaded with a variety of toppings, they were both really bland and lacked any kind of punch. On the bright side, their boxes looked recyclable; on the down side, I think they make crust out of the same material.  Really disappointed. \n\nIs it the worst pizza I've ever had? No, but it wasn't great. What's worse is that it cost me nearly $30 - for two personal pizzas! I figured for that price, these were going to be fantastic. Sadly, I was wrong.\n\nIf you're looking to try to impress an out-of-towner with a pizza place with fancy ingredients, convincing them this is how SF'ers eat, then take them here.

(We order every Friday or Saturday like the creatures of habit we are.)\n\nAfter a lifetime of living it up with the gluten-filled vegan noms, I've learned I have celiac disease with an extreme sensitivity to gluten. I'm VERY limited in the places I can eat because of contamination issues and the limited GF vegan options. I've never once had a contamination incident from zpizza (after a year of ordering weekly!), and the customer service is top-notch. The gluten-free crust is definitely made with ingredients that include refined starches, and too much of a good thing is a little rough on anyone's belly, but I've never had a contamination issue and I've learned a valuable lesson in moderation of all gluten-free treats. (Yes, I HAVE attempted to eat an entire large in one sitting because OMG GF VEGAN PIZZA. I failed, and I still ate too much. But it's delicious. I just couldn't help trying.)\n\n(Also regarding contamination: I'm not unreasonable. I expect it to happen once in awhile, if not from a restaurant then from their ingredient sources. I think going out to eat is always a gamble, which is why I rarely try new places. I'm amazed and thrilled at how conscientious the folks are here. I wish I could give you all some kind of award for your attention to detail and your interest in graciously and deliciously serving such a diverse customer base. Much respect. Thank you.)\n\nIt's definitely pricey pizza, but for something that doesn't cause me a health setback, and has a huge selection of fresh veggie ingredients, it's worth every penny. My days of disgusting $5-10 pies are over, anyway! (And I do remember how delicious Zpizza's whole wheat crust was! Well worth it whether you're a gluten-eater or a gluten-avoider.)\n\nI love that there are THREE different kinds of mushrooms. The bell peppers are always fresh. They're not too heavy-handed with the Daiya cheese (I know it's delicious cheese, but it's easy to overdo-- Z does it just right), and those magic pizza ovens melt it perfectly. It'd be awesome if they added some black beans someday (or some other beany-type higher-protein topping), but it's no deal-breaker.\n\nWe almost always get takeout, and I make my own salads at home, but whenever I've had a salad here, it's always fresh and delicious. (And I love that I can add and subtract veggies easily, especially when I order online. Ordering on the website makes it so much easier to be the picky customers we are, and more clearly explain ourselves.)\n\nZpizza is one of my favorite parts of the whole bay area. I even got my parents hooked on it out in Arizona and they visit their local locations regularly.", "author": "Jennifer A."}

You want some decent pizza and you're trying to feed 8-10 people so nothing super fancy but also you don't want takeout from the grease shack on the corner or a Domino's poop pie.  \n\nZpizza is your solution.  \n\nI ordered a Santa Fe and a Berkeley Vegan and both went over well.  It was enough pizza and much tastier than Dominos.  Most importantly, it got delivered in 40 minutes and on a rainy night.  Maybe it was a little pricey coming in at around $50 but in my opinion more than worth it to not have to lift a finger and have quality food at my gathering.\n\nOne tip; I'd definitely call in to confirm if your address is in their delivery radius.  This one is only about 10-12 blocks from me and their online system incorrectly indicated I was out of the coverage area.", "author": "Steven R."}

It's one thing to say we don't have public bathroom and another thing to say to a customer who is deciding on their food that they can't use the bathroom until they have their receipt in their hand. The restaurant smelled very bad and the floor and tables looked greasy too so the standard of hygiene is very low at this place.

I first tried this pizza on a trip to LA and was blown away by the fresh ingredients and \"healthy factor\" of  the organic ingredients, wheat crusts, and even some gluten-free options.  You can imagine my excitement when they opened up an SF location.  So psyched!  \n\nI visited their location on Mission Street, which is perfectly situated next to my unhealthy shopping habit of the Nordstroms/Westfield Mall.  We went with a group and we went \"family style\", ordering a few salads and different pizzas to sample.  \n\nThe salads are super fresh and delicious.  Typically, the salads at most pizza joints are generic & prepackaged, but you can tell that they're using much better produce here.  A great way to start it off....\n\nThen the pizzas came out and we went nuts.  You can have a fantastic traditional pizza here, but I would recommend going non-traditional with their zpizza creations and rustica pizzas.  I think we sampled all of the rusticas, and a couple creations like ZBQ and Provence.

But I finally tried it and I'm glad I did, the higher quality of ingredients and attention to making genuinely good pizza and giving customers a nice experience is worth the price.\n\nI went with a friend and got one of the specials, 2 Rustica pizzas, a healthy thin-crust piece of deliciousness made with creative and quality ingredients, each well-suited for one hungry person, and 2 fountain drinks for $17 (well, 18 something with tax). Although the service hadn't been super-attentive, when I refused the fountain soda cup the cashier offered me a bag of chips or two freshly-made cookies instead. I don't do soda or chips but those cookies got me and I could tell they do have the best intentions when it comes to the customer having a good experience. My pizza was tasty enough that I will be back soon, and not so unhealthy that I felt guilty after- the perfect combination!\n\nThe atmosphere isn't something to get excited about, but the people are chill- not always easy to find in SOMA. The pizzamaker even brought out a slice of what he was making for my friend and I to try.\n\nTo the person that thought they don't have napkins out- I did too, and when I asked the cashier for some, he politely came out right next to where I was sitting and pulled some out of a dispenser! For some reason the dispensers are kind of hard to notice, but they're there :).\n\nFor those with cars, street parking can be tough here but they're right next to a garage.", "author": "Ashley L."}

I needed a quick bite before walking among the hoards of comic nerds so pizza it was.\n\nThe interior is clean and spacious. They have two tables worth of booth seating and chaired seating enough for about 25 more. Colorful walls and hung photography give the space a cheery, although cafeteria, feel. There were only two other customers there during lunch hour. I thought it was a bit odd how empty it was.\n\nSingle slices are about $3.50 each. I had a slice of Napoli pizza; garlic sauce, rounds of tomato, mozzarella, basil, and parmesan. The pizza was brought out to my table. Nice. I enjoyed the pizza. The garlic sauce is really good. All the ingredients taste really fresh and bright. In terms of crust, it's a thin crust but don't be expecting super super thin. I found the crust to be a little odd because the bottom layer of the crust has a very crispy bottom. So when you chew through the crust it kinda feels like you're biting through a cracker. I can't make out if I entirely enjoy it.\n\nThe pizza slices aren't huge nor are they small. To make it meal you'll most likely need two to three slices. The crust wasn't entirely my thing and it's a little small for the price. I wouldn't mind paying a little more to get a bigger slice rather than getting two slices.\n\nSeveral things about this placed irked me. I needed to wash my hands before chowing down on some pizza so I asked where the restroom is. The guy told me where the bathroom is and gave me a serving spoon with a key on it. I understand why places do this but I really hate it. First of all, this spoon is going to the bathroom. Right after I wash my hands, I have to carry the spoon back to the cashier. So not only am I touching the spoon, but the cashier who is handling the food is touching it. Yuck.\n\nAdditionally, when I was given the pizza I wasn't given anything else. No water, condiments, or napkins. I was a bit annoyed about the napkins the most. I mean, it's pizza right? There aren't any napkins or condiments or self serve water anywhere. I don't mind the place has a self serve area for this stuff but there are none. Why not napkin holders at each table?\n\n_____\n\nI learned from the cashier that Zpizza is only a month old. Their ingredients seem fresh and their space is very clean and relaxed. There are many many better pizza places in SF but if you want a quick slice with a seated area this isn't so bad; however, if you can manage your hunger pains for another pizza shop do so.", "author": "Michael H."}

This pizza definitely deserves 5 stars!\n\nI actually liked it so much, I went back today to try their Berkeley Vegan pizza. That was a huge mistake! The fake cheese was simply bad.

The fake meat on the pizza wasn't great either and the vegetables weren't anything special. I would prefer my vegan pizza without fake cheese and fake meat since there are plenty of delicious things to put on a vegan pizza.\n\nI was so thrilled yesterday that I wanted to write a great review.

I wish I could catch more days when they have one of their chicken pizzas done for slices. They are the bomb. But my favorite pizza here is the Mexican. It's just one of the best combos I've ever seen.

When lunch time arose that day, I eagerly started walking toward my destination.  When I arrived, I ordered what looked to be a slice of the classic Margherita.  Upon returning to work and taking a seat at my desk, I flipped open the box and dove in.  I immediately noticed the quality ingredients.  Everything tasted incredibly fresh.  The tomatoes and sauce had a superb flavor, likely due to the use of organic vine-ripened tomatoes which is a completely different food than the conventional artificially ripened tomatoes found in most supermarkets.  As I was enjoying my slice of pizza, I was shocked to read on the edge of the paper insert the following:\n\n\"Part-Skim, rBGH-Free Cheese From Grass-Fed Cows\"\n\nThat's impressive.  Also, both the original crust and whole wheat crust are organic (I asked), and the tomatoes and tomato sauce are organic.  Every pizza I tried so far was delicious (though the \"Provence\" was my least favorite as the capers seemed to overpower it).\n\nOverall, you can't get much better than this, especially as a semi-chain, so I give this place 4.5/5 stars.  I'd like to see an option for whole milk mozzarella (\"low fat\" doesn't necessarily equal healthier, and plus you lose the rich flavor) and more information about where their meat comes from.  Yes the meat is additive and MSG-free, but this doesn't necessarily mean it's high quality or healthy.  It's also possible the pepperoni contains sodium nitrate/nitrite as this isn't specified.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-10", "description": "Delicious pizza, awesomely friendly and fast service. I am gluten-free, and pizza places are extremely few and far between (i've only found 3 others in the entire Bay Area, though i haven't done an exhaustive search). This pizza easily tops all other gluten-free pizzas i've ever had. The crust is thin, crispy, and tasty. I got the Thai for dinner and paid less than i did at the last best-gluten-free-pizza place (a place in Berkeley whose name escapes me). While i've had better Thai pizzas in my gluten-y days, this is very good. Fresh bean sprouts on top and just enough peanut sauce are high points.", "author": "Juli C."}

It's the type of pizza that's good all the way through, meaning you won't see any crusts left on the plate. Great salads and sandwiches too. This is the ideal place to grab a quick bite before (or after) a movie or shopping. Or if you work in the area, go for lunch. I had the lunch special (pizza slice, salad, and drink) for under $7. All in all, a great meal at a great price.", "author": "Curt B."}

Not sure what I was expecting, a crunchy pizza oozing with molten hot cheese?  Well friends, it wasn't that.  The crust was thin so as not to be doughy and have a raw taste to it, but it wasn't crispy.  I had to crisp up the crust myself.  The pepperoni is low-fat, which is great for being health conscious, but since when is pizza suppose to be an acceptable low-fat meal?  I think I would have been happier with the full fat pepp, a bit more cheese on the pizza and some SALT.  I thought the pizza was a little flavorless until I added some salt myself, and no I do not have high blood pressure:)\nI ate my ittty bitty GF pizza and watched the fam enjoy a cheesy original version.  I was happy to be able to enjoy my pizza along with everyone else, but it didn't quite satisfy the craving.  I'll order from there again, but I'm still on the hunt for a GREAT gluten-free pizza.", "author": "Heather S."}

Our pizza arrived at our hotel lobby on time, 30 bucks not including tip, not the kids fault. The pizza had no crispness, it folded like a wilted piece of lettuce, grease dripping down the sides.

There weren't many toppings on the pizza and those that were there were very bland.  Overall, the pizza has zero taste other than daiya cheese and the crust was soggy & undercooked.
