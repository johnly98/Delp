So this review is based off a weekday afternoon visit, in which all I ordered was carne asada super nachos (I think the totally was $8.50...). There was a lady working the counter and making the food. Luckily, no one was ahead of me, so I walked right up and placed my order. As previous reviewers mentioned, it does take a bit for your order, because this lady is running a one woman show, but it wasn't that bad of a wait (although I had no orders in front of me.) \n\nWhile waiting, you can load up on the salsas at their little salsa bar. The red and green salsas were hella good. The pico de gallo was so-so. \n\nOverall, I think the nachos were pretty damn good. They are generous with the meat and the toppings, and the portion is really big. The only small bummer is the chips they use; which is crucial, of course. They use that giant bag of yellow corn tortilla chips from Costco. If you're a Costco shopper, you know what I'm talking about. Those chips are alright, but there are so many better quality, and sturdier chips out there! Sturdy is important for all of those hefty toppings they pile on. If they upgraded their chips, these would be some 5 star taqueria nachos for sure.\n\nIf you have a craving for some loaded nachos, I think you'll be quite satisfied by what Taqueria El Jalapeno is serving up.", "author": "Liz M."}

It was the typical red and green sauces at the sauce bar, both really spicy so there's really no choice in heat. At other taquerias in the area you get a much better presentation of housemade salsas, but this place I think is serving something very similar to what you can get in a can at the grocery store. All that aside, the owner was really nice and polite, and she chatted with me in Spanish for a bit. Friendly service, quiet spot too cuz there's only one tv usually playing a Spanish soap opera, and there wasn't a huge crowd of people. If you want to avoid the crowd and just chill somewhere for a quick bite away from the city noise, *not expecting the most amazing tacos*,  then this is your place.

On the plus side, they do give you chips with your order.\n\nI felt bad for the woman working at the counter--she was all alone during the lunch rush, taking orders, turning around to stand over a hot griddle before stopping in the middle of a ticket to answer the phone, which seemed to ring every few minutes. My food took thirty minutes, and I nearly had to cancel my order to make it back to work on time.\n\nAs I was waiting, someone came in with his girlfriend and said he was finally going to show her a \"real Cali burrito.\" I don't know if I will ever understand San Francisco's obsession with and pride in their burritos. I've had plenty of mom-n-pop hamburgers that make me sneer at fast food; the best tacos I've had have always been from humble stands, usually in Mexico. But I've never been to a burrito place here or anywhere else and ordered a burrito which made me say, \"Okay, this is clearly better than Chipotle.\" Maybe that's because all you can ever do to improve a burrito is put more  things inside it and use better ingredients...texture is almost irrelevant in a burrito. Is it just because they're easy to eat while you're walking? I'll take well-made tacos, gorditas, tortas, etc. any day over a burrito.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that if your reputation is going off your burritos, there's a lot of competition in SF.

We wanted to avoid the weekday school crowds which other reviewers had complained about. The television was blaring a soccer game in Spanish.

Along the counter were a variety of hot sauces which needed to be refreshed.  Our meals arrived wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just like many other reviewers statements, the food was intermittently warm and cold.  The meat was warm, but the other additions were cold or at room temperature. It seems like they should have warmed up the entire burrito before serving.  Because of this, it might be better to take the food to go and warm it in your own oven.

The owner lady makes the best burritos. Anyone else will not do. In fact, if she is not working I refuse to come here. Here portions for meat are perfect. Anyone else will put less and your burrito will lack flavor. \n\n2) The male owner will periodically be here taking orders. Just be patient with him because he can be disengaged at times. I have ordered food here before and he has missed parts of my order. Also, he can rub people the wrong way with his attitude. From time to time he can sound harsh when taking orders. If he does do this just raise your voice a little louder and speak even more clearly so that HE understands your ORDER! Include a loud noise as well because he tends to get distracted. \n\nMy last few points:\n\nMake sure to get your chips.\nTake as much salsa Verde as you want.\n\nAs for my order today. Good.

My plate of quesadilla had guacamole and sour cream on the side as well. Their burritos, tacos and nachos are something which I have yet to try the next time I pop in for some Mexican Food.

In some cases, mom-and-pop resturants are great because of the food quality and sincerity of staff.  El Jalapeno has the latter but not the former.\n\nCoherence: I always order a simple burrito.  I'm used to taquerias differentiating  between a 'Regular' and 'Super'.  El Jalapeno doesn't, not in their menus or when they took my order.  Had I known, I would have shouted 'No cheese and sour cream', even when I order \"regular(s)\".   \n\nIngredients:   As taste would hint, I gather their food has preservatives or been idling in their fridge. Food tastes like that from a food bar at your local Safeway.  Is it digestible?  NO!   Is it delicious? NO!  Even when I'm starved, I can't finish a single order.  I've also sung it back up.  These are always clear markers that somethings wrong with the food.  Another clearer indicator would be their chips.  They're not fresh and thin but rather more like a stock you'd get from a bulk bag at Costco. \n\nPrice: Its all affordable but kinda odd.  The merging of sizes/ingredients isn't to my economical advantage.  Whether it be a 'Regular' or 'Super', the price comes out to a mid-range between the two.  This is compared to a Mission-district taqueria where a 'Regular' usually runs under $5 and a 'Super' goes for $7+.  \n\nAmbiance: Are the facilities cleanly? Fairly.  The tables and chairs don't seem like they've been wiped down after every patron but my toosh and arms weren't tainted by hidden remnants.\n\nService: Are they friendly?  Yes?  They've never botched my order and don't talk to me like one in an assembly line of customers.  \n\nConclusion:  Although its a family business; sometimes their teenage kid gets put on register duty, they're ultimately a restaurant.  Unfortunately, making my own burritos tastes better than what they sell.  I dont cook that well!", "author": "Honest J."}

I usually get the steak super burrito and use their hot sauce. I also like their super quesadilas (am I spelling it correctly? probably not, my apologies). Oh so yummy! Beware of food coma, because you WILL get it. They cook the food very fast too. The last time that I've came here, I got very thirsty after eating the salsa chips and a super burrito. Not sure if that was due to the chips or burrito, but it's a big turn off for me if I get really thirsty after eating (b/c of the salt or MSG, or both).\n\nAlso, the place has a fairly decent size seating area, but I wouldn't recommend eating here with more than 4 people if there are other people in the restaurant. \n\nOverall, I recommend this place.", "author": "Sam W."}

The guy at the counter was not very nice, but not rude..but close enough to being rude to make me cringe a little. Leo and I both felt the same about the guy...I ordered a super veggie burrito para llevar (to go). Ok, first I must say I LOVED their salsa at the salsa bar. I wish I brought more home because my burrito was pretty boring.\nAt La Corneta in Glen Park their veggie burrito is filled with all kinds of yummy veggies..zuchinni, corn, carrots, etc. But their tortillas are super doughy so that is why they have not won my heart. OK, back to the El Jalapeno burrito, my super veggie was nothing but rice and beans. Unless you count some wilted lettuce as veggies... MY VEGGIE BURRITO HAS NO VEGGIES, DAMMIT!!  I have rice and beans at my house. I could have saved myself $6.\nLeo has not eaten his yet so the jury is still out on his carne asada burrito. I am not expecting any miracles.

The burrito consisted of bland rice (no spices added at all) as well as boring refried beans with absolutely no seasoning. The guacamole was watery and tasted like it came out of a package. The tomatoes in the salsa were not even ripe yet and were mostly a pale orange or green (and the salsa was also pretty tasteless). The shrimp were the same tiny nasty shrimp you find in cup of noodle or cheap Chinese fried rice and they and the nerve to charge extra for it. The nachos were just inedible and they put all the beans on the bottom and the chips on top of them!

I read all the reviews and decided that my first burrito should come from here. No dice. I show up during the advertised hours only to find them closed. More than once. \n\nOK. I finally chance upon the place when it's open. My order is taken by a kid. Literally, he was about 10, and playing video games at the counter. But that's not where it all went wrong. He handed the slip off to a woman who started to assemble our burritos. My partner's Super Chicken was fine. My Regular Carne Asada was promptly anointed with guacamole, although I explicitly said that I want none of that. You see, I am deathly allergic to avocado. \n\nThe woman (operating with her bare hands the whole time) picked the large bits of avocado out of the nearly-completed burrito. NO! No, I scream! I am allergic, I can't have any, I'm not kidding. She picks a few more bits out. NO, I say. She plops the just-grilled carne asada onto the green mess. NO, I say, I was serious, I can't and won't eat this. She throws the burrito away and... disappears into the back room.

They covered my burrito with Campbell's tomato soup, or maybe a generic off-brand tomato soup. Also, when do you EVER put parmesan cheese into Mexican food. Yes, my wet burrito was topped off with something that you top pasta or pizza with, parmesan cheese. It's not even the packaged or shredded parmesan either, it was truly the Kraft shake bottles you buy at Safeway.

Hold on this is all going to make sense. Just give me a minute. Let's see where was I ? Oh yeah, so I was trying to make it over the bridge before traffic and I was cruising down Ocean and saw a pizza place with a parking spot right in front. This was sweet. I was damn near grinning from ear to ear. I'm not sure if I was happier about my parking spot or that fact that I was about to down a couple slices. As I stroll in I ask the guy at the counter what kind of slices they had available. Apparently I had found a slightly more upscale pizza joint that only served whole pies. My grin quickly disappeared. I thanked him and explained that I was in a rush and didn't have time to wait for a whole pie. Feeling rejected I walked back outside only to see my truck parked right in front. What a waste of my parking karma. Not helping matters my stomach began to grumble. So I had to find another place to eat. \n\nThen I looked up and dead ahead there it was Taqueria El Jalapeno. It was Glorious! The thought of pizza quickly left and all I could think about was some Carnitas tacos. I made a beeline across the street and was pleasantly surprised as I walked in to a nice clean family run place. It seemed like a couple ran it. They even had their young child hanging out in the place. I ordered at the counter and was quickly served 3 carnitas tacos. They were awesome! The salsa was Delicious. I went for the spicier salsa and that was an awesome call. I probably could have eaten 3 more. Not because they weren't filling but because they were that good! I thanked the staff as I left and my grin was definitely back. Also I still had the dope parking spot. Sweet!\n\nThis place is totally recommended if your ever in the area.", "author": "John M."}

My fiance, friends, and I have only had their burritos, salsa, and chips, but everything was so fresh and flavorful.

Also they automatically put in onions, sour cream, and guacamole.  All I can say is, \" Get over it.  If you go to Mexico, that's what you get Whitey.\"  They add in the spicy without telling you, but I'm Asian and immune, so it tastes really good to me.
