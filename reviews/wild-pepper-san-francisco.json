Good looks clean! I ordered Hunan chicken lunch special that was good. Also ordered dry braised chicken wings which was a mistake. All the braised Sauce covered up the old chicken taste. Didn't notice it until I got home later. We ate in and customer service stinks. The younger hosts served us but u can tell she was reluctant to give more than one glass of water, a little sugar for the tea and one napkin. Never offered more. I asked the male helper for a to go container. He didn't make eye contact and passed it saying here. It was dirty and I sent it back and asked for a bigger one. They gave me the same size. Lol!!! Plus I had to mix the wings with the other items. GOD BLESS THEM BUT SERVICE STINKS AND THE CHICKEN WAS TRICKY....", "author": "Ayanna W."}

From reading other reviews, though, customers seem to have the most problems with take out delivery and language barrier.\n\nI've eaten here three times now and I've been very happy all three times. Fast highlights: affordable (most dishes under $10), great portion sizes, quality and authentic Chinese dishes, no msg and food is not too oily, peaceful restaurant ambiance w piano music, dishes come out carefully and aesthetically plated, and they take good care of you in terms of service. \n\nFast downsides: language barrier. The owner, Ming, is very nice. When I asked about the menu, though, I did experience some difficulty understanding what he meant. So that can feel a bit awkward. We ended up switching to Cantonese and had no problems after that. If you don't know Cantonese, though, just try to be patient and ask Ming to speak slowly or ask for another waiter. Sure we are in America, but I think pple should try to be kind and understanding regardless. \n\nFood experience in detail:\nMy first two times I ordered the Mongolian beef with rice and vegetables, a pretty basic standard Chinese dish. It was a bit heavy with the onions, but the portion size was pretty generous and the presentation was great. I would definitely recommend this option as a fast and basic it delicious dish if you're not sure what to order. \n\nMy third time here, I brought my mom, so I wanted to pick out some more sophisticated Chinese dishes (as Asian moms are not easily impressed eating out, and my mom passes silent judgement on every dish that does not meet her expections..)\nSo, we ordered (and in order of my recommendation): \n\n1. West lake beef soup - a creamy, slightly salty Chinese soup that has some mushrooms, beef bits, and egg. It was nice and savory, and enough soup for 3 pple, definitely try this! Presentation of the soup was so pretty, it could have been in a food catalog. \n\n2. Garlic pea sprout - if you want a Chinese vegetable dish, try this! Pea sprout is usually more expensive at other restaurants but here it was reasonable. Portion size is great, not too oily, slightly salty and garlic taste. \n\n3. Vegetable spring rolls - yummy appetizer, comes out piping hot. Also I'm a sucker for spring rolls\n\n4. Wild Pepper seafood basket - an assortment of seafood and vegetables (shrimp, scallops, peas, cucumber, mushroom, broccoli, carrots, etc) cooked together and placed into a crisp bowl-shaped pancake. Best part of this dish was the presentation. The seafood and vegetables were not burnt, was tender and not dry, and just the right amount of oil. The one bad thing was it was a bit saltier than necessary. \n\n5. Wild Pepper chicken - pretty good. There was chicken, bell peppers, mushrooms, cucumber, tossed together w a flavorful slightly salty sauce. Really yummy with rice. Comes spicy but you can adjust for less or more. \n\nI'm happy to say my mom was happy w the meal (disaster avoided!!) and our total meal cost was about $50 but we ordered so much we basically paid for two dinners for us both. All in all, will definitely be back.", "author": "Connie L."}

And what's the deal with a food score of 72 out of 100 for 3 years in a row!!? That's disgusting!! Roaches in the soup, dirty bathrooms, defective plumbing, unsanitary food surfaces, improper food handling temperatures dirty walls, dirty ceilings, dirty floors and improper handwashing methods. I mean most Chinese restaurants are like that but at least they fix the problem after the first violation. \n\nAnything under 80 is dangerous! I'm saving you from food poisoning!! DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!! This is why good Chinese restaurants are expensive because the quality of food and the standards are higher. But I've even found expensive Chinese restaurants with food scores under 90. There is something seriously wrong with the Chinese food industry.

This is the only dish I heartily would advise against ordering. \nBeef was battered deep fried to a point of rock-hard unchewability, set atop a bed of blistered green beans (fine), and doused in a mysterious white sauce (mayo?).

Lots of beef and veggies but the thing that threw us off were the diced water chestnuts and the amount of ginger that was in it. The ginger was cut julienne style so tough to pick out. Lastly was the entree, the mushroom chicken. That had even more ginger julienne style and it was almost over powering the dish. We tried to separate as much as we could but it was futile.

It took an hour for my order to come. I got the salt & pepper squid, crab rangoons, potstickers, & white rice. The squid wasn't fried the way I expected it to be but it wasn't bad. The crab rangoons were delish ! Potstickers weren't exactly my fave. But it was an overall good, cheap dinner. \n\nNote: Didn't like how the guy wanted me to give him a cash tip when I could easily do it through the app. He ended up asking me if I wanted to tip 10% or 15% so he could do it for me ?

It tasted just like chicken and checked my order to make sure I ordered the \"meatless chicken\" dish. Once I confirmed that I did I just figured they did a really good job of making a dish that tasted just like chicken. I continued to eat the dish and then after taking some more bites something didn't seem right and I examined the pieces of \"meatless chicken\" come to find out it was REAL CHICKEN!!!! \n\nThis is something a restaurant should not mix up and I was devastated that I ate meat!!!! They need to be very careful what they are making and to not give real chicken when someone orders the meatless.

It's truly \"A-OK\"--how Yelp defines 3 stars.  Having said that...\n\n1. The best thing going for this restaurant:  The owner Ming Louie.  Courteous, laid-back, and I think genuinely interested in his customers' experience.  Whether or not you might have had back luck with the food or the service on your encounter with Wild Pepper that counts for a lot in this business.\n\n2. Other things going on for this restaurant:  Great low-key location near the main drag (Guerrero or Valencia), but far enough away for you to be able to enjoy the comfortable indoor setting. Great vegetarian options that are fortunately pretty tasty too.  I wish the broccoli wasn't so over-cooked on my General Tso's meatless chicken, but the fake chicken had a nice texture and flavor to it.  Not too spicy, but a present kick.  More sesame seeds please!  If you like your vegetarian chow mein to be crispy like I do, this place is it.  Great flavor and crunch I'd expect from Hong Kong style chow mein with a good amount of adequately cooked zucchini, broccoli, pea pods, carrots, bok choy, and white mushrooms.  \n\n3. Why I'm short of being a 4-star \"fan\" (for now):  There is an awkwardness about the social skills of the staff I encountered that does not match Ming, the nice setting, and the decent food.  Having noticed the poor Yelp feedback of the delivery service, I decided to phone in my order and pick it up.  The young lady on the end of the line was, in addition to being hard to hear and understand, was a little curt.  After hearing my order, no \"did I get order right;\" no \"thanks & good-bye;\"  no \"your order should be ready in about X minutes;\" no space left for me to ask a question; just \"click\" (from the phone hanging up).  \n\nFolks, as the saying goes, \"There's no second chance to make a first impression.\"  My first impression came the minute I picked up the phone for my order.  That having flown out the window, I'll still probably give Wild Pepper a few more shots, knowing that the owner is well-meaning and that his establishment serves up decent vegetarian Chinese food (albeit, slightly modified for the American palette).

It has become my favorite lunch spot based on location, price, and variety of the menu. I discovered they actually have two different types of meatless chicken. One for fried dishes, General Tso's, Orange, Sweet n Sour, etc. Another form of meatless chicken that looks like brown tofu but tastes different for the other dishes like Szechuan, Kung Pao, etc. Being a junk food vegan, I prefer the texture of the fried but the cubed chick is pretty good too. I tried to ask my Chinese buddy which dishes were fried vs non fried, but he's more redneck than I could ever hope to be. There's a good reason his nickname is \"Tex\"... \n\nI still can't give it a full 5 stars since fake chicken is the only vegan option they have so far. Although even if there was a fake beef, I'd probably still opt for the chickenish dishes. They're also not the fastest place in town. Which isn't  a problem for the most part since we usually call ahead, although I still have to wait sometimes. Also the Monk's garden Soup was not what I was hoping for. Almost no flavor at all.

We ordered General Tao chicken, dry braised chicken wings, salmon with asparagus, and garlic pea sprouts, all very delicious and highly recommend!  \nThe restaurant itself has dim lights with red/orange walls to complement the Chinese art pieces; very good choice of interior design compared to other Chinese restaurants! \nServers were quick and polite.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-16", "description": "This is one of the best restaurants in San Francisco. My rating is going to be based on four categories. Food, service, atmosphere and price. \n\nThe ingredients here taste like they were picked from a garden in the back of the restaurant. Everything is fresh as can be and the mix of flavors are some of the tastiest I've ever experienced. I like eating plant based food and Wild Pepper has textured, flavored, soy that they call meatless chicken. It is FANTASTIC!!! My favorite dishes are Wild Pepper meatless chicken, tomato beef chow fun, vegetable wonton soup, avocado spring rolls, onion pancakes (their peanut sauce is thicker and tastes much better than creamy peanut sauce), and green tea ice cream for dessert. Try the General Tsao, Broccoli beef, Kung Pao and Vegetarian Delight entr\u00e9es as well. \n\nI always tip 25% here because the service is constantly superb. Ming, the creator and owner, puts his heart and soul into this business. It's easy to tell his culinary experience by the quality and diversity of Chinese cuisine he serves plus his management experience is evident in how well the restaurant operations are run. The staff is extremely friendly and kind, always helping before I ask for assistance and listening to everything I and my friends ask for. John and Alice specifically do an exceptional job keeping me happy and expressing interest in friendship with me, which makes me very happy. The chefs always do an exceptional job listening to even the smallest of details to ensure customer satisfaction which always makes people happy knowing they are being taken great care of. \n\nThe ambiance here just perfectly brings me into Chinese culture, even though I'm in the Mission district of San Francisco. They have soft cultural music playing, historic decorations on the walls and on the floors and an exceptionally clean venue. They incorporate plants into their ambiance as well which I love because it brings a more natural feel. \n\nThe appetizers are priced around $5 and the entr\u00e9es around $10 which are extremely reasonable because the portions are HUGE!! I am a big man who eats a lot of food and I can barely finish one $10 entr\u00e9e which turns into a second meal later in the day or the next day, so I end up paying $10 for two delicious meals which I love doing!! In terms of San Francisco prices, this is an absolute jem because normally I would be expecting to pay closer to $15-$20 for the same entr\u00e9es. \n\nAll in all, I hope my review has better helped you understand why Wild Pepper is a must dine in San Francisco. The combination of high quality food, phenomenal service and ambiance as well as great price is difficult to find in San Francisco and Wild Pepper does them all and more. Thank you for reading and I hope to hear about your experience at Wild Pepper soon! :)", "author": "Allen S."}

I said I'll be back. A few days later I was craving Chinese food and decided to go back. \nAs I'm pulling up, that same amazing aroma caught me and I couldn't wait to get some food. I go inside, very clean, cute and quite but there was no host. So I stood for a second and finally this girl comes out the back and acknowledges the guys that were sitting down in the waiting area but does not acknowledge me. She fiddled around with papers and whatever else and still no acknowledgement. So I say to her \"hi, can I order some food to go please.\" She responds \"yea\" and walks off. She comes back, brings one guy his order and walks back to the back. A few minutes later she comes back with the other guys order hands him his order and walks off again. So I'm standing there and I'm on the phone with my mum whom I'm ordering food for as well. So she comes out the back again and we make eye contact and I smile at her and say hi again and she walks off again to the back. She comes out with a pitcher of water and begins to fill the guest who were seated in the restaurants water glass. So now I'm getting irritated, and the only reason I didn't leave is because my mum really wanted this food. So she comes out again and I say to her \"is there a problem?\" And she responds \"no\" and pulls her note pad out to take my order. The whole time I stood there with she seemed uncomfortable and as if I was a bother to her. All the back and forth from the back were long waiting periods. She never said thank you or anything pleasant to me. \nI finally get my to go order, make it to my mum's job to have lunch with her and our order was wrong. The Mongolian beef was delicious but my shrimp fried rice was completely messed up. I wanted no egg in the rice due to allergies, but all I got was shrimp and rice. I did want my vegetables. \nSo the food was good minus the mishap with my fried rice but the service was horrible! I couldn't help but feel a certain way as the host was nice to certain types of people but short and not friendly with me. \nIf you decide to go here it's going to be a gamble I assume.", "author": "Dion A."}

I docked down a star for the wait time on the delivery - 90 minutes from order time, on eat24, as suggested by so many.\n\nWe ordered: General Tsao's chicken, dry sauteed string beans, crab rangoon, avocado spring rolls, dry braised chicken wings, and walnut prawns.\n\nAfter 90 minutes of waiting, the food arrived tepid.  The fried batter of the rangoon and prawns had withered and cooled.  The avocado spring rolls were bland, lifeless, tasteless, with brown avocado.  The dry sauteed string beans had sat in the container for enough time that condensation had built up and made them soggy.\n\nIn terms of taste, the crab rangoon, avocado spring rolls, and dry sauteed string beans were nothing to write home about.  Pretty uneventful, soggy yet dry.  The walnut prawns at least had some sauce.  They were decent.  The chicken wings had a lovely coating that saved that whole plate.  It was ordered medium spicy but didn't taste like there were any chilies in it.  Finally, the General Tsao's chicken was the best dish of them all.  It had sauce, was at least a little spicy, and wasn't cold.\n\nI'm reluctant to reorder from here because it feels like it's so hit or miss.

We ordered the combo chow fun, which was not the best I've had. It was very dry and had no flavour. Broccoli beef was alright. Beef a little on the chewy side and the broccoli was cooked thoroughly. The honey walnut prawns which is supposed to be a chefs special was okay. It definitely had a weird taste to it but manageable if you decide to order it. Food shouldn't be just manageable though. We also got the crab rangoons which was surprisingly very good. Had flavour, well-portioned inner bits, and a perfect crunch. I'd order those again. The BBQ pork steam buns was pretty bad. The bun tasted like I was eating plastic. The pork was dry. There wasn't any flavour and it was bland. Overall I've had better. The price is not worth it. I won't be back for this place, I'll spend my $$ elsewhere, but I'm glad I gave it a go so I won't be wondering what their food is like anymore.

I see black fungus, tofu, green beans, broccoli and bean curd skin, among other stuff. The sauce is okay but I wouldn't call it \"spicy,\" as they have.\n\n4:49pm: The Szechuan Meatless chicken is exactly the same dish as the Szechuan Buddha, just with meatless chicken instead of bean curd skin and black fungus. The mediocrity of this sauce is much more apparent now. Definitely rolled the dice and lost on this one.\n\nThe meatless chicken pieces are small and lack the mouthfeel of better meatless chicken, like the kind they use at Crazy Pepper.

I tried wild pepper but it's not that great and I won't eat there again.\n\nOne measurement of the quality of any restaurant is ingredients. This is a Chinese restaurant that uses bags of frozen cubed carrots and peas in their dishes. Sauces where bland and oily. After a few bites my kids refused to eat it.. The vegetable chow main had almost no veg in it at all and the sizzling rice looked watery and clear. Lesson learned, pick up from Alice's is much better and worth the drive across town.\n\nIf you think this is great five star chinese, you need to try more restaurants. There are some great 4-5 star chinese restaurants in SF.", "author": "Jeff C."}

The prices have been fine.  The quality of service (interaction when taking the order and delivery) has always been lacking.

They also often do not speak English clearly.  When I use an app service (like Eat24), my experience has generally been better--presumably the person or app feeding Wild Pepper orders has worked out some of the interaction problems.\n\nWithin the last few weeks I have had two really bad experiences, and I think the service has gotten worse over time.

There was a little confusion with our waiter and he thought we were sharing the mango/papaya meatless chicken and potstickers, so we didnt get the general tso's chicken. Our server was very accommodating and offered to put in our order when he understood there was a miscommunication but we said, dont worry about it, because actually the potstickers and mango/papaya dish was perfect for the two of us (and keep in mind, my gentleman friend has a healthy appetite). To my surprise, the meatless chicken was great. I don't usually like tofu but the consistency was really good, as was the flavor (quality ingredients, you can tell).

The delivery can be so slow - 1.5 - 2 hours now - and the delivery person expects me to pick up the food from his car. For lunch (I doubt they're that busy at 11 am) or dinner! Last time (over 2 months ago), I tried to convince that particular delivery guy to come into the building to deliver - nope, he wouldn't do it, no matter how I argued. \n\nMaybe the restaurant needs to re-train this delivery guy. There's a nice delivery guy who was quite prompt (arriving in about 1/2 hour) and he'd deliver the food to my door and get a tip. But the risk of having bad delivery guy be the one who was sent- the one who was always super-late and never brought the food into the building - well, it just isn't worth it. \n\n\nPrevious review on food - \nAmericanized Chinese food...so yeah its greasy but at least there's no MSG.  Still, they have lots more options for vegetarians than most Chinese restaurant. \nThey have a lot of vegetarian options, including but not limited to \"meatless chicken\" (wheat gluten with a little soy) dishes. However, they have a lot of tofu and vegetable options too (lots more than Supreme Master restaurants). \nThe little veggie balls in the Monk's garden soup are tasty - and if you order the \"salt and pepper balls\" you'll get an even BIGGER container of the veggie balls, tossed in minced garlic, fresh green and dried red chili, scallions, salt, then placed on a small bed of shredded cabbage.", "author": "Joyti J."}

Come on guys! 76 out of 100 is abysmal! They also try to hide their score behind the rest of the health inspection paperwork, which I'm pretty sure is illegal. \n\nAs someone that moved from LA and is much happier in San Francisco, I hate to say this, but LA totally has SF beat in the way of health inspection rules. Restaurants are given a sign with a large letter grade (A, B, etc...) that must be visible FROM THE STREET. I never once saw anything below a B posted on a restaurant, and even B ratings were rare because most people won't even bother to walk in to restaurants with subpar health scores hanging in the window. As a result, restaurants had an actual incentive to improve they way they are storing and handling their food. \n\nIf Wild Pepper brought their health ratings back up this would be a 5 star review, and they would be back to getting an order from me on a near-weekly basis.", "author": "Leslie H."}

I've eaten a lot of Chinese food and Wild Pepper stands out far above the others in a number of ways:\n\n1) Delicious and plentiful vegan / vegetarian options including an assortment of fake chicken dishes.  General Tsao's seems to be the favorite among my friends (Yes, I know this is not \"authentic\" Chinese, but who cares?)\n\n2) A unique and creative menu.  My experience with Chinese food is that recipes have been handed down for many generations and varying from these recipes is unthinkable.  Thus, it was quite a delight to see some new dishes on the menu, which I've never had before, including sizzling rice soup, crispy vegetable balls, and avocado egg rolls.  The chef is definitely creative!  Oh, we also had a cold soba noodle salad with a peanut dressing that the chef was experimenting with when we were there.  It wasn't much to my liking, but I had to give him credit for experimenting (we were given the dish free of charge since it was experimental)\n\n3) Great prices, especially given the portions\n\n4) Great atmosphere and very clean!  The decorations are tasteful and a combination of modern mixed with classical decor.  The tables for four are a little on the small side (especially when you're eating like pigs, like our group and they bring out more dishes than will fit on the table), but that's probably one of the only complaints I have.\n\n5) Parking in that neighborhood wasn't too difficult to find either time I've been.\n\nI should also mention that they can accommodate large groups.  I noticed when we were in there they had a table of maybe 20-30 people that just stretched lengthwise along the restaurant.  It took up most of the restaurant but everyone fit in comfortably it seemed.\n\nI will definitely be back for more!", "author": "Peter O."}

I swear he yelled at me and said \"No, no, no, you cant change the lunch specials, it is what it is, you get what is there!!!!\". I responded with \"Well, it says right so on the menu that substitute plus $1-$2\", then he said, \"ok, ok\". See here is when I get annoyed, if you are dealing with the public, you have to hear them out, because in a world where Customer is King, you should go out of your way to please and besides I wasn't asking for silly request, I was just asking for another order of rice.

Originally, when I ordered delivery (vegetarian), I'd get meat or something wrong. Delivery took a while so to get the correct item, it took even longer. Recently, I've been getting everything perfectly. The reason for 5 stars (outside of the tremendous food)? When we finally dined in the restaurant, we had a great experience. The waitress was very nice and the service was great. \n\nThe food here is terrific (some of the best vegetarian/vegan Asian food in the city) and very reasonably priced. I highly recommend Wild Pepper, both for delivery and dining in. We order here all the time and we will as long as we're anywhere near SF.", "author": "S S."}

The dishes were pretty bland and unimaginative; it was a typical Americanized Chinese place.\n\nWe did famiry style. Breakdown by dish:\n\n- Volcano Prawns:  Sweet, battered and fried prawn goodness. Tasty, reminded me of Panda Express too (in a guilty pleasure sort of way).\n- Monk's Soup:  Basic savoury vegetable soup. Solid.\n- Mapo Tofu:  I had a legit Mapo tofu a few days ago at Sichuan Fusion in Richmond, and this one is probably 2 classes below that. In other words, I could have made this blindfolded from crappy tofu and packaged seasoning. Blandly spicy, poor tofu texture.\n- Spicy beef with scallion:  When I saw it, I was like WTF is this? Cornstarch sauce laden beef, peas, carrots, and onions... at least the beef wasn't stringy. It wasn't very spicy though.\n- Bok choy with mushrooms:  I liked it a lot actually. A bit too gooey cornstarchy saucey style, but the flavor was pretty good.\n\nSo, 3 out of 5. We paid $16 each for 5 people so it was reasonable, but I can't say I'd come here again.\n\nRedeeming quality: they deliver.", "author": "Ayumi Y."}

Worst case scenario, it's just another Americanized Chinese food.  \n\nQuick summary: MuShu pork was good and guess what, you can order dimsum for dinner!  (my Chinese friend swore dimsum was only for breakfast)  Oh, free fried rice (or white rice) with your order.  \n\nShrimp dumpling: especially thick skin, but yummy.  It's just really hard not to make this one right, but I loved that we could order a side of dimsum for a dinner take-out!  Shrimp dumpling to start off the meal - yay. \n\nHot & Sour soup: it had all the right \"stuff\" - the black dried mushroom or whatever that is, tofu, bamboo shoots + almost the right soup consistency, but it lacked the sourness.  I thought it was one of the better ones, but the feeling wasn't mutual. \n\nBroccoli Beef: one word - interesting beef.  Well, usually, it's thinner beef slices, but this beef was thick!  I've just never seen beef like this in Broccoli Beef, but overall, it tasted fine, very saucy (just the way I like it since I like sauce with my rice) and crispy broccoli. \n\nMuShu Pork: loved that they gave us the right wrapper for it.  The other place gave us flour tortilla to wrap the MuShu pork and if you've ever had the real Chinese food, you know there ain't no tortilla in Chinese food!  Anyway, it was good and I'd definitely order it again. \n\nChicken Fried Rice: it was free, so no complaints there. Nothing special - it was just like any other fried rice with chicken bits in it. \n\nPortions were big - I think we have plenty of left overs for two more meals.\n\nI would give it a 3.5 star, but since Yelp doesn't allow that, I guess it's more like a 4 star.  We plan to try again to confirm its star rating. \n\nSo, why doesn't Yelp allow 1/2 star ratings?  Lame.", "author": "Catherine H."}

Their \"meatless\" menu is pretty long too. The mere reason why I adore this cute restaurant - it is just around the corner, oh thank Buddha. It is comfortably tucked in between residential houses on 26th St....which could easily be mistaken as a neighborhood locksmith or a shady massage parlour, the inside decor is however feng-shui enough! Please order their Monk's Garden soup and any kinds of Chow Fun.... which is way more fun to eat than the little Mein cousin.", "author": "Jesada P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-08-07", "description": "I've lived in the Mission temporarily for a number of weeks over the past year, and as a vegan who typically enjoys spicy Asian food, I've been drawn to Wild Pepper twice, even though it's not the healthiest, and I'm not a big fan of fake meat, anyway.\n\nIn general, they leave a good impression.  The owner, though possibly a little brusque at first, is genuinely kind, and concerned about the enjoyment of your meal. Though a little oily, the veggies are not overcooked, and the portions are certainly generous. \n\nI find it a bit annoying when Yelpers give a restaurant a horrible rating based on the timeliness of the delivery alone. That isn't very helpful to readers who are interested in the quality of the food, and not just whether the meal will be brought to their doorstep promptly.  The first time I ate Wild Pepper I did order delivery -- and was not that happy with the food, mostly because I ordered General Tso's, or maybe Sesame, meatless chicken, against my better judgement, and it is basically a pile of deep fried breaded-ness.  I also ordered the soft tofu and green onion salad and similarly, it was exactly what you would expect, and not very impressive.\n\nThis time around I ate at the restaurant, and purposefully ordered way too much food so I could try a few things and have leftovers for later.  Worried that every meatless chicken dish would be like the first, but just with different sauce, I asked the owner / waiter if it was always fried, and he said I could order any of the meatless chicken dishes not fried.  I went for Szechuan since I like spicy and it seemed popular from the reviews.  I also ordered Hunan Eggplant and the Monk's Garden Soup. I had heard the Monk's Soup came with \"vegetable balls\" so I checked to make sure there was no egg and was reassured a couple times that it was vegan (in a respectful, not obnoxious way).\n\nThe soup could easily be a meal for one in itself. I thought the broth was a bit bland but the veggies were good and the vegetable balls were dangerously addictive.  The balls aren't necessarily eaten in the soup; they come on the side and are nice and crispy on their own (and there's a lot of them!). They were sort of like little Chinese pakoras.\n\nThe eggplant and \"chicken\" came out a bit later.  I was too full to eat much of them, but found them pretty good, but maybe because I didn't have very high expectations. I did think the sauces were a little similar and not nearly as spicy as I would have liked.  If you like spicy, emphasize it upon ordering--even if you say you like spicy, you should probably be clear that you like it really, extra spicy (not, you know, Midwestern American spicy). The Szechuan meatless chicken had a sort of black bean sauce with some jalapenos and came with a mix of vegetables. I found I liked the meatless chicken a lot better when it wasn't breaded and sauced into oblivion, though the texture is more like a firm tofu than \"meat.\" Though I was full, I kept snacking on the firm little cubes. The eggplant was soft, just like I like it, stir-fried with bell peppers and onions. \n\nI was satisfied with my meal, and similarly my curiosity about Wild Pepper is satisfied as well. Since I don't live in the neighborhood, I probably won't make an effort to go back--and I think Enjoy Vegetarian is better.  But it's a decent option for the Mission if you don't mind spending about $10 a person.  And with the complimentary tea, attentive service, and pleasant atmosphere, dining in is just as enjoyable as getting delivery.", "author": "Tamara F."}

Was not disappointed, after last night's meal. The food arrived in about 30 minutes, right on time, piping hot.\n\nThe fried rice with shrimp was fluffy and fresh, and served as a nice base for the szechuan  chicken, which the guy taking my order recommended. It was a pretty spicy dish, but different from my normal routine, and was thus a welcome change. Of course, it's hard to get it too wrong with moo shoo pork, and theirs was a solid version. \n\nJust a note to all Chinese restaurants in general: I will give you an extra star if you give me at least 8-10 pancakes without me asking or charging me extra. Wild Pepper came with six, which seems like about normal but come on, how is that even close to handle the large serving of pork broth that accompanies?

Skip to lunchtime....\n\nWe ordered enough food from the night before to have plenty of leftovers for lunch. My gf ate her leftover Wild Pepper lunch around 2pm and I ate mine at around 3pm. She came over after work around 7pm feeling REALLY nauseous and said that her stomach had become upset about a half hour before e.g. 630. Guess who's little tummy was upset at 730?? You guessed it, f'ing mine.. ughh... Our shizz was wrecked for about 2-3 hours and it was no-fun. I won't go into the gory details of \"what goes in must come out\" but you prolly get the idea... \n\nBottom line here is that I'm a little more sensitive to food poisoning bacteria than my iron-stomach gf so I felt bad the next morning and she didn't. When  we refrigerated the leftovers we gave the relatively small amount of bacteria plenty of time to PARTAY, make sweet sweet love and produce plenty of cute little baby bacteria that made us feel really friggin bad.... \n\nGranted, this would be construed as low-grade food poisoning but in any case it sucked-ass!\n\nI will not be ordering from here E-V-E-R again.\n\nOriginal Review - Before the nightmare began\n\nI am having a hell of a time friggin' typing n's on my keyboard b/c my pal Steve thinks its fun to punch the shit out of a laptop keyboard....If I forget any n's here, you've bee forewarned...

The food was delivered promptly and the prices were good for the amount and quality of food.\n\nI guess there was only one problem, and it's a big one for me.  The food was super-duper greasy!  I was optimistic from the reviews, and maybe my order was a fluke, but geez louise!  There was enough residual grease to deep fry an order of egg rolls.  It's the kind of grease that coats your lips and leaves a taste in your mouth after you're done eating.  I just had leftovers, and I was hoping that the grease would have magically disappeared by now, but it was still there.  I expect a certain amount of grease from Chinese food, but this was an intolerable amount.\n\nIn all fairness, the dishes were delicious and had great flavors.  The hot and sour soup was amazing and had the right amount of spiciness.  You can't make soup greasy, right?

I stayed loyal when the change happened- and I have to say it's pretty solid.  I don't think this city is very strong in its Chinese food delivery options- and I just started ordering from them because I had their menu, and compared to other places- its for sure one of the best ones I've had. I went on yelp and I just didn't agree with a lot of the nay-sayers on here. I've literally ordered from this place dozens of times- and its just pretty darn solid. Not amazing, not out of this world like many SF restaurants- but for Chinese delivery- I keep ordering over and over again. For me that says a lot.  \n\nHere are the good things: \n\n1. Their soup is consistently excellent. I've ordered the corn chicken soup when I've been really sick- and usually I don't eat meat that comes from questionable sources- but no matter- it was darn right great each time I've had it. \n2. Their delivery is really fast\n3. I always get free fried rice with my order (even when I haven't ordered the 2 entrees like they ask for)\n4. Their food isn't overly greasy - sometimes its borderline- but not nearly as bad as I've seen it from a lot of Chinese delivery places. \n5. They're really nice on the phone, fast- but nice. Like I said they've given me the free fried rice even when I didn't exactly meet the criteria.\n6. I tried another place that I found on yelp recently - which had higher reviews. I ordered from there a couple times- but for whatever reason I came back to Wild Pepper. \n\nHere are the so-so things:\n1. A couple times i ordered stuff that was just blah- but that was a long time ago at this point- and it hasn't happened in quite a while. \n2.

So after a few minutes, we decided to just sit ourselves at whatever table and they didn't seem to mind. I had the sesame chicken. with fried rice. Before ordering I asked the waiter if the sesame chicken was crispy and he said that it was fried. With most Chinese restaurants, I expected it to be really soggy. However, it came out really crispy and the taste was not overpowering, it was made JUST RIGHT! I ordered from the lunch special which comes with an entree from the list + soup+ rice, all for $7 and if you wanted to substitute fried rice it would be an additional $1. So for two orders it was only $15, not bad at all! Another thing was, the waiter forgot to add our sodas so we go ours for free, never a bad thing!!

Against my better judgment (and my distaste for those menus that are wedged in your doorway), I decided to order dinner from Wild Pepper, hoping I could get something to eat that at least wouldn't kill me.\n\nI opted for the staples: Mongolian Beef and General Tsao's Chicken. Free fried rice was included with every two entrees, a bonus that was just the beginning of what would turn out to be a great meal. Forty minutes later I opened my door to a really friendly delivery person whom I decided to give a large tip to just because he was especially pleasant throughout the whole experience.\n\nThe food was very good and was thankfully absent of the usual homogenized Chinese food qualities. As with all other freebies I expected the fried rice to come in a tiny, one-serving container, so I was very pleasantly surprised to discover that it came in a large carton instead. The portions, in short, were ginormous. Four servings worth. \n\nAll in all, for two entrees, an extra single serving of jasmine rice (I expected the free rice to be tiny, remember?), and an especially large tip I paid out $19.

The picky vegetarian in the group who claimed not to usually like eggplant did enjoy this dish.  The two shrimp dishes were practically indistinguishable except for the squid in one.  Both were tasty, although the squid was a little chewy - it IS squid after all.\n\nThe Szechuan crispy beef was awesome.  The crispy pork and wild pepper chicken were also really good.  I was a little disappointed that we didn't' get more fried rice - it seemed that whether you order two entrees or seven, you may get the same amount of the 'free' fried rice.  The veggie egg rolls were yummy, too - crispy outside and flavorful.\n\nWe all finished with the tingle of chili and white pepper in our mouths, but not so much as to be uncomfortable.  The heat on these dishes was perfect and enhanced the flavors instead of simply being hot.\n\nOverall, a really good meal, especially for delivery.  Ended up being about $9/person plus tip to the driver.", "author": "Chris W."}

Rankings\n\nJust ordered delivery for the first time from Wild Pepper. I am usually a Big Lantern girl; but heard a lot about the food at WP being as good or better. I have to say this is true - the Hong Kong Noddles were better - and $1 cheaper! - and the Gen. Taos' Meatless Chicken was as good if not better ; the balls are of a different compostion - NonGMO Soy instead of wheat Satan - and I think they will reheat a lot \nbetter.  The sauce was tasty but a tiny bit on the sticky side - still a good dish though, with very generous portions and a much better\ncontainer than BL's.\n\nI have seen some other really intriguing things on their menu that seem unique and I will try next time.\n\nThe person who took my order was courteous and thorough - and they added garlic to my Noddles for no extra charge! (Big Lantern actually charges me an extra .50 cents to do that - ridiculous!) And the food came quickly even on a busy Friday night and was PIPING HOT!!\n\nNow I want to say a word about SF Health Inspections rankings - which I check religiously before trying a place. It's true that in past years WP's ranking was not up to snuff - but the most recent one from this year 2011 is in the mid to upper 80's (86? I seem to remember)\nwhich is respectable enough, and if  you look at the specific violations they are all minor/low risk, and all 'abated' - which means it's been fixed. Nothing about 'unsafe/adulterated food' which is one to really take seriously. \n\nAnd there is confusion for many people about how they write up vermin like mice or rats - a violation that says VERMIN as the first scary word used to turn me away from a place right away! Then I discovered there were different violations (with different wording and different Code Numbers) that they used that are very confusing  and misleading to most of us.  You can click on any violation and see a more detailed description of what it actually means.  \n\nSO: the first word being VERMIN does NOT mean they are present! It actually means there are not adequete traps or precautions to prevent vermin entry. The assigned risk factor is written up as LOW.\n\nIf vemin are in fact found to be present, it is written up as:\n\"Roaches/Flies/rodents/other animals\" - and the risk factor will say HIGH.\n\nSo in the most recent Health Inspection findings, there are no vermin present at Wild Pepper, so I felt safe to try it out and was glad I did.\n\nI say this place has very tasty food that does seem lighter and healthier - at great prices - and the veggies were WAY better than BL's...so give it a try.", "author": "Auntie M."}

Not cuisine-y like Mission Chinese but also a lot cheaper. It is very reasonably priced for delivery since it comes w noodles or fried rice if you order 2 entrees. The lunch specials are obviously a great deal too. Jasmine tea was my go to for many yrs. then it started going downhill so i discovered wild pepper is also good and a bit different and though they are similar and I like both I now slightly prefer the food at wild pepper though I like the atmosphere better at jasmine tea. Also jasmine tea has a new owner who is a former longtime employee so I look forward to trying it again I have heard its like it always used to be. At wild pepper i like the pork mushu and everything else is good too such as the eggplant dishes.", "author": "Precita M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-04-14", "description": "I planned on leaving the house today.  But I did not.  I could go into detail as to the reasons why i did not but that's just really depressing so anyway.\n\nI wanted a delicious fake meat sandwich from Love and Haight and then I wanted delicious fake chicken satay from Mekong and then I realllllly wanted a peanut butter and jelly vegan ice cream cone from Maggie Mudds.  I wanted to put it all in a blender and drink it in a delicious fake meat and soy cream shake.  I know, I know, I'm turning you on.  However, none of these (wonderful) assholes deliver and I couldn't muster it up to hop on the J Church.  I am pathetic.  I am pathetic and I was starving.\n\nSo I went through all of the delivery menus in my stack and settled on Wild Pepper as I know Maria D. loves it and she is a woman of delicious tastes.  I looked at the Yelp reviews and based on Jessica T. and Kingpin's suggestions, I decided to order the Mu-shu Vegetable and Kung Pao Tofu.  I called in to place my order and then I swallowed my pride/shame/a cookie to tide me over and asked,\n\n\"I am on Weight Watchers, can I have this stuff made with very little oil and not deep fried?\"\n\nIt's a little tool I learned in Dub Dub meetings called, \"asserting\".  That's right.  You ask for what you need.  I love this tool.  I use it all the time.  I fucking asserted my ass all over the DMV the other day and guess what I got?  Almost arrested.  But that's beside the point, when it comes to food ordering, this shit works!  Double Dub (Sam Z) in ACTION, JACKSON!\n\nWoman on the phone goes, \"Oh, yes!  You are on a diet!  No oil!\"\n\nAnd I said, \"YES THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING, YOU ARE WONDERFUL!\"\n\nAnd she goes, \"You get free fried rice or chow mein with your order, which you want?\"\n\nFLABOTAGE!!!!!  (tm, mark s.)\n\nHAD SHE NOT HEARD A WORD OF WHAT I SAID?!?!  DO NOT TEMPT THIS FATTY WITH THE TWO WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE THAT WHEN COMBINED, I CANNOT RESIST, \"FREE\" and \"FRIED\".  I mean, really.  I am only so fucking strong.  I thought I would break.  I also said, \"YES!  I'll take one of each, please!\" BUT I DID NOT.  This is the new me in 2007, people.  To quote a college friend who may or may have been a straight-up anorexic making a much needed plea for help that I ignored because, What?  I'm drunk!  College RULES!, \"Nothing tastes as good as thin feels!\"  I'm fucking taking it strong this time.  So I say, \"May I please have brown rice instead?\" And she was cool with that.  We reached an understanding.  Miss Enabler on the other end of the line knew I wasn't up for her games and manipulations and \"doing her job properly whilst dealing with a crazy person\" and I knew that I asserted myself in a healthy and hopefully effective manner.  That's right.  Making strides, ain't nobody gonna hold me down.  Oh no, I've got to keep on moooooving.  Towards 78 pounds, an ideal weight for someone who stands 5'6\".\n\nThe food arrived in 30 minutes, cooked perfectly to order and still tasty despite the lack of flavorful oil and flavorful fry.  The brown rice was especially good, light and fluffy.  The vegetarian mu-shu was really good and I don't care what everyone says about mu-shu not being authentic Chinese and I get laughed at by my Chinese friends whenever I order it and I don't fucking care.  I lost your respect when I stopped eating meat.  Don't lie.  It's okay, I have a little thing called, MORALS.  at least give me that as pride and shame are clearly gone.  Oh, also, the kung pao tofu was super yum.  I would order all of these dishes again...I mean, once I get through this order which could take a year because they give you a lot.  The only thing missing was the fake meat but alas, I can go one meal without fake meat product.  Now, I know how you meat eaters feel in a vegetarian restaurant.  i'd laugh when you freaked out about having to have one meal without artery clogging cow ass or abused and shot up with formaldehyde chicken wing but now I get it.  I hate to see a Chinese menu without fake meat on it.  Call me a bigot, racist, sexist, what have you.  I am all of those things.  But I just realized why I didn't want to give Wild Pepper 5 stars and it's because they lack the fake meat factor.  Now go review Millennium with your hilarious, \"WHERE'S THE BEEF?!\" 1-star review.  I know you want to and it's so funny and original!  Hurry, do it before someone else beats you to it!  Oh, wait.  \n\n(this whole review is tm, laura b., btw.  i know, obnoxious with the tm tm tm.  don't worry, i hate me too.)", "author": "Laura B."}

This is now the 2nd time I have ordered carryout and the food has just been bad.  The first time was the day they were installing hardwood floors. Called in an order and went to pick it up.  The dining room was closed because they were literally laying the new floor...stepping over extension cords, dust everywhere...when I saw what was going on, I almost left my order and ran for the door. How can a restaurant's kitchen be open in this situation?      Food was horrible and tasted like it was made the day before.  Decided to give them another chance so Sunday 9/26/10, went back for carryout.  Nice floors...lousy food.  New Owners?  New Cooks?  Something has changed here....Please change it back!!!!", "author": "Mike M."}

I got the Wild Pepper Tofu and the Kung Pao Tofu and the Chow Mein. I thought the flavors were pretty good, but since I'm not a huge fan of pepper, the Wild Pepper Tofu fell short of my expectations. The delivery service did take a lot longer than the guaranteed 30-45 minutes; but it turned out to be worth the wait. Just a side note, I live REALLY far away from the restaurant's location, so I guess it was understandable that it took so long; I just wish someone had warned us!

Well overall it met the task of feeding us and being affordable our total was $22 \n\nWhen we saw the prawns dish we thought there had been a mistake,  it was a soup like dish.  It had a good amount of shrimps with small cubes of tofu, peas and diced carrots.  The broth also had eggs in it, ( like the egg drop soup at other rest.)  We imagined it to be more of a coral color for the lobster sauce, but it was white. \n\nThe broccoli in the beef dish was very nice.  Fresh and not overcooked it was still crunchy and green.  They were pretty big sizes of broccoli though.  As for the sweet and sour soup it was decent I was surprised to find cubed tomatoes in it.  I never had S & S soup with tomatoes in it.  It also had a strong pepper seasoning but I did not notice it after to spoons.  \n\nOverall we were pleased with our food and we will order from there again, but we will skip the prawns w/ tofu in lobster sauce.", "author": "Emperatris V."}

It is a casual place with friendly and at tentative service.  Szechwan and Hunan are the name of the game, (needless to say they have mild dishes.)  Pot stickers have crispy golden exterior that is also firm and filled with a savory mixture of pork, cabbage, and ginger and other seasonings.  Green onion pancakes are are light, crispy, and greasless with a perfect balance of dough and green onions with a creamy peanut butter-like dipping sauce.  Wild pepper chicken is the bomb with Szechwan chili pepper flakes, carrots, celery, and a sauce of chili oil which compliments the tender chicken slices and vegetables.  Lemon fish is crispy with a greasless batter and a thick but not overpowering and too thick of a lemon sauce.  Jade shrimp is succulent with fresh spinach, bamboo shoots, and fresh bean curd in a light sauce.  The house special lo mein is a plethora of ground pork, onions, and a mild brown sauce that tasted like it could have been bean sauce (what am I saying, it was just that.)  I will definitely be returning to try the won tons in chili sauce, ants climbing up a tree, and the Szechwan crispy beef.  As I say in all of my reviews, great food, service, atmosphere, and prices; what more could you ask for?!  Oh,!

Of course, she said, \"some vegetables\".  That should have tipped me off to leave and leave quickly and not look back.  But no, I wanted to give this place a chance- they have brown rice, for Pete's sake! My friend and I ordered for take out at the restaurant and spent over $70- enough to take care of several days worth of meals.  While ordering, you get a free fried rice or chow mein with 2 entrees. The waitress felt that we should each get the fried rice, cuz it would be easier for her. There is a tiny space for parking right next to the location, that seems to be reserved for employees. As we were waiting for our orders, an employee came in and parked right behind us which essentially boxed us in. We offered to move so that we would be all set to go when ready, but one of the employees said it was not a problem. Ok. Well, after waiting for quite some time for our food, we were ready to go. We remind the guy that they need to move their car. In the car, during heavy rain, we waited and waited and waited and waited and waited....I went back in (trudging through the big puddle provided by the dip in the pavement) to remind them that they need to move their car. The guy must have forgotten about us. I went back to the car, through the big puddle and waited some more. Finally, an employee comes out with a take-out order to deliver and backs up out of the way for us to leave. No sorry for the inconvenience, no nothing. At home, opening up the plastic containers - some had melted from the hot food. The food was hot. But, it could be described as pig slop, but even that would be a compliment - because it definitely does not represent what I know to be Chinese food. Oh, another tip off, the place was empty.
