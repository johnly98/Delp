One I've been wanting to dine in for a long time is Eat Americana.\n\nThe menu is standard Californian cuisine.  And they do it well.\n\nI ordered the chilaquiles, that came with pulled pork and a sunny-side egg.  The pulled pork was delicious, and I loved it in the tomatillo salsa. \n Chilaquiles is my favorite breakfast dish, and I'm particular about how it's made.  Eat Americana checked off everything I look for: crispiness of the chips, flavor, salsa type and egg.  The pulled pork gave it bonus points.  We also ordered the sweet potato tater tots, and they are addicting!  I'm amazed we didn't finish it, and I inhaled it later in the evening.\n\nThe space is a mom-and-pop diner with good service and great food.

I was really hungry so I ordered both the country biscuits and gravy and the king elvis pancakes.\n\nTho it only comes with one biscuit its a large halved biscuit topped with 2 sunny side up eggs and southern style sausage gravy. The biscuit was immaculate. Crisp on the outside and warm and soft inside and the eggs were runny and cooked perfectly. The gravy had a nice flavor but being from the south im used to it a little thicker and big chunks of sausage. Portion size was slightly light but not bad by any means.\n\nThe King pancakes were bomb. Im usually not a big pancake or elvis guy but you get 2 giant banana pancakes with the usual syrup and butter but sandwiched between them is hot gooey peanut butter and bacon. It was super filling, tasted amazing, and came with a few berries on the side.\n\nFriendly family ran spot with the chef from ricky bobbys.

It reminded me of a giant White Castle burger (guilty pleasure). The pork and cheese on waffle fries are a must order to share. I chuckled at the miniature American flag in a toothpick a top the mound of pork and cheese covered waffle fries. But what's more American than the fried chicken patty between two pieces of white bread? It needed the slaw. Nothing too special though. More like a katsu sandwich than a fried chicken sandwich.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-31", "description": "I've been spending time with family out here in the Outer Richmond, and encouraging them to get outside their comfort zone. You know--you sorta go to the same places and you get into a dining rut. So you gotta fire up the app and see what's out there. \n\nNow, I like me a funky fusion spot, or a deep dive, or a cuisine you can't find on every corner. My family? Not so much. So after some appsurfing, I settled on Eat Americana. It satisfied both of these concerns: a new place we hadn't tried, but definitely in everyone's wheelhouse. Traditional American food.\n\nWe rolled up after taking a car (this, too, was a boundary-stretching experience for them--their first time ordering one on their own) but that's not really relevant. I enter it into the record for posterity.\n\nWe rolled up late--probably around 8:30pm. There were only a few people there on a Saturday night, but it was warm and welcoming. The menu is indeed full of American traditionals, though some are regional. Wings. Philly cheesesteak, chicken parm. We orderered the latter two. Although the cheesesteak is served just a sandwich on a plate, we ordered a side salad which isn't much more than greens. You could also add fries, but you know, health. The chicken parm was dished a little more eloquently, and that's one of the things I like here--they seem to take a little more care in plating. \n\nMy chicken parm was good. Not tough, served with just the right amount of sauce, and there wasn't a gross amount of cheese. All in all, it was well put together and I liked it. But that cheesesteak was the clear winner. I only had a bite, but it was a great, soft roll, stuffed with the steak/onions/peppers, and the cheese permeated the entire thing. It was something I'd go back to order so I could have one all to myself. Prices are pretty reasonable, and service was quick. They don't seat too many people there--it's a smaller spot with average decor, so I dunno if there's ever a big waitlist or if they get swamped if they have a crowd.\n\nIt didn't change our lives in and of itself, but the app led us to an outside-of-their-routine spot that turned out to be a real winner. The measurement will not be if I go back, as I'm out of this town most of the time, but whether family grabs a car and goes back.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

(I did take and post pix, but since it was so long ago, they didn't attach to this review.)\n\nLast year, a group of us were carpooling to Sonoma to get our wine on. Since I was the last in the pickup line, we decided to grab breakfast / brunch by my house. Our group of six didn't have a reservation anywhere, so we ended up at Eat Americana on Saturday, November 19th around 12:15pm. It was a rainy afternoon, so it wasn't too busy. They sat us right away at a table in the back.\n\n*2 Farm Eggs Breakfast: fried or scrambled, served with hash browns ($9), add Americana's Sausage (+$2), Avocado (+$2)\n*B.A.T. Scramble: 2 egg scramble of bacon, avocado, tomato, cheese & scallion, with house hash browns ($12)\n*Breakfast Burrito: 2 scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, hash browns, sausage, peppers & onions, salsa, sour cream ($12)\n*Buttermilk Pancakes: 2 pancakes with butter and maple syrup, 2 fried or scrambled eggs ($10)\n*Country Biscuit Plate: sausage gravy and 2 sunny-side eggs over toasted buttermilk biscuit ($10)\n*Americana Omelet: 3 eggs, cheddar cheese, bell pepper, onion, tomato, with house hash browns ($12), add Sausage (+$2)\n*Breakfast Pork Sausage Patty ($4) x2\n*Mimosa: prosecco, orange juice ($7) x4\n*Fresh Ground Coffee ($2)\n*Barq's Root Beer ($2) x2\n\nIf memory serves, I believe I got the americana omelette. I thought it was okay. Pretty standard and nothing special. I did enjoy starting the day with a mimosa and coffee though. I think they do bottomless, but I'm not sure if we got that as it was only $7 each. I tried the sausage patty which was good. Our server was very sweet. I drink a lot of liquids, so I constantly had to ask him for more water and coffee. I know that can be annoying since how much coffee and water can one person drink?! (The answer for me is A LOT.) But he never seemed irritated. Prices were good and everything was super affordable. I think we spent less than $25 each including tax and tip. They also give you small rice krispy treats with your bill.\n\nI used to love Americana Grill as they had a huge menu and my beloved Joe's Special. It was a HUGE portion and so good! Eat Americana left me wanting more as the omelet didn't quite leave that same impression. In the end, decent and cheap eats.", "author": "Elena N."}

Everything tastes great, seems fresh, and is prepared in an elegant way, especially for being comfort food. Honestly the thing that makes me the happiest is that this is simply the way these dishes are supposed to be done, yet nobody seems to care enough to do them this well. That's what makes Eat Americana worth traveling to. But good food alone sometimes isn't enough for all 5 stars. Every time I've been the chef gives a warm greeting and a fond farewell and the owner is all smiles. \n\nTHE FOOD\n\nTonight I had the asparagus and mushroom grilled cheese with pesto and such melty Swiss cheese that each bite was like when a magician pulls neverending handkerchiefs from his sleeves. It just kept coming. My wife had fresh papardalle pasta with asparagus, peas and a cream sauce with a touch of fresh mint. It seemed super creative. Previously I've had the breakfast burrito, one of the best in town, the chicken parmigiana, which I have to fight not to get every time, the lasagna, the tomato soup, pancakes, and the biscuits and sausage gravy, amongst some others. And the menu is always changing!\n\nTHE SERVICE\n\nTop notch. The kind of place you can have a conversation with the chef while he works, and where the waiter can't stop smiling. Tonight I noticed the chef wearing a shirt from a lesser known Philly cheesesteak place my dad took me to, known to locals to be the best in the city. Chef James says his is the best in SF. Next time. \n\nTHE LOCATION\n\nBeing way out in the avenues and being pretty much diner food (although not completely) this place is too easy to miss. Don't miss it.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nComfort food shouldn't make you uncomfortable like most do in this genre. Eat Americana is fresh, flavorful, and a pretty rare gem.", "author": "David L."}

I could see the owner making these straight away in the back station. He promptly brought them over and they were quite tasty. Not too much OJ and not too little champagne. After ordering, the food began to be delivered in quick succession. I went with the Breakfast Burrito in what I had hoped would stave off some of the effects from the hearty wine tasting that was coming up. My choice was rich and filled with a nice balance of meat and vegetables. It wasn't too oily and the tortilla had the right amount of chewy texture without being too wet(or dry) from the ingredients.\n\nService was always johnny on the spot, and the owner who took care of us throughout the meal, was gracious and friendly.

We'd seen the Yelp reviews and I already knew I wanted the pulled pork waffle fries and, while everyone else was torn between other items, I knew they'd want to share.  Our clever server knew, too, and brought small plates for us to divvy up so we could taste each other's dishes.  It was the perfect dining experience for us as we are all \"foodies\" and were able to sample not only the waffle fries but also the short rib hash, crab cake, and mac and cheese with sliced rib-eye.  To appease our carb-and-fat-guilt we also ordered the grilled asparagus -- heavenly.  Everything was satisfying, with top honors going to the crab cake, asparagus and of course the waffle fries.\n\nThe owner is a friendly and pleasant soul, visiting the table to check on things, and I think it was his elderly (94!) mother who passed our table several times, beaming and wishing us a Happy New Year (it was Easter Sunday).  She was so charming that we all wished her a Happy New Year, too, many times over.  On our very first visit, they really made us feel like part of the family.\n\nGood, hearty food, attentive and friendly staff, and a charming family running the place.

I've dined here a few times and there was nothing really special; very basic American dishes prepared by Asians, so why would a well known chef want to work here?  Shrugs.  \n\nWe were seated right in front of the window next to another couple.  Our area was blocked off by the kitchen so it was very difficult for customers to wave down a server.  Service is everything and when a customer is not tended to, you take away one star but in this case, the couple next to us walked out.

Grits can be heavy and the portions are usually small but when the dish arrived, I was looking at a big bowl of soup with floating shrimps.  The texture of the grits was under cooked and it was just wayyy too much.  We saw another customer order the same dish and felt so bad that she had to eat the whole thing on her own... this can easily feed 3 people\n\nMy friend had to pop up again to ask for the check at which none of the servers noticed.

It used to be Americana Grill and was a nice little Balboa eatery that was run by a very nice Vietnamese guy. I had not been for a while and i am at the Balboa theater and see an ad for Eat Americana. Looked like a hipster diner now. \n A few weeks later myself and a few friends decided to try it out.  Judging by the reviews and all the stars I think since we came so late they let their guard down and we got to see how everything is frozen and not fresh since they kept pulling out bags of frozen food in plain sight.  We all agreed on Burgers that looked amazing. While waiting for our Burgers ( mind you, we went in at 9 and there was no one else in the place.) It took 20 mins to get 3 burgers made. Not that big of a deal. When we were waiting my Roommate noticed above the fryer was a small pan with a few pre-cooked burger patties. We all looked and the \" chef \" some white dude with a beard slaps cheese on the patties and tosses them in a toaster oven to melt the cheese. We all gave him the side eye. When the burgers came out the fries were way overdone ( due to him talking and not paying attention to the fries ) and super salty to where my lips were puckered. The burger was greasy, fries were light brown and it was about $13.00 a burger. We also noticed when they were making togo orders all the Shrimp and Chicken came out of generic restaurant supply brand frozen bags. I take it nothing is fresh here. It tasted it too. This place is trying to be an upscale Hipster destination. FAIL ! if Gordon Ramsey was here he would have laid into him.

My friends were not complaining about their Chicken Parm, Poor Man's Steak Frites, and Country Biscuit Plate. In fact, they were all saying how the price point was just right for the quality and quantity of food. \n\nAnd oh, snap, the bread pudding french toast!

Oh yeah - they serve breakfast all day and the bread pudding french toast with fruit sounded really decadent so we'll be going back soon.\n\nYears ago we tried this place and really thought the food was lousy.  I read recently they got a new chef last year and I'm just sorry we didn't come back sooner.  What a nice experience.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there's really no ambience - it's really plain. Some art/redecoration would go a long way to giving this diner-y place that extra star as a neighborhood fave.", "author": "Cassie C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-10", "description": "Americana Grill turned Eat Americana! And I'm a fan! I've always love what the chefs at Broken Record and Rickybobby do and now Americana has James Moisley at the helm! Now mix that in with the nostalgic Americana Grill and you have an inviting and delicious location! I have to say that Balboa is starting to look classy, without too much of the crazy hipster vibe.\n\nGone are the Vietnamese pho and rice plates and it took me some time to get used to the fact that I won't be seeing 100 different dining options. But quality over quantity, right? The whole menu has been revised and revamped! So what did we get? Pulled Pork Waffle Fries for starts, duh? My wife had the Philly Cheese Steak and I, after studying the menu, went for the one dish that I'm a sucker for: Shrimp and Grits (or Polenta in this case), but this was listed as Shrimp Diavolo. \n\nPulled Pork Waffle Fries: Quoting my wife, \"Waffle fries are the best; you can't go wrong with it.\" And it worked so well with the pulled pork. They also drizzle a cheese and buffalo sauce on it and makes for a good combination in every bite! Try it at least once!\n\nPhilly Cheese Steak: Okay, Philadelphia will always have the claim to the best in the nation, but I think this is pretty darn close. I thought it wasn't a big sandwich, but it was packed with flavorful sliced beef, the right amount of cheese and roasted red peppers, and all that between a soft roll. The dish was served with a side of pickled jalapenos. \n\nShrimp Diavolo: Again, I had the shrimp and grits at Broken Record and Rickybobby and both had been the best I ever had. Except, it wasn't easy to get to those locations. Now that I can order this at the one place I used to go weekly, I might have to get back to some old habits! On the menu, the dish is served with polenta in lobster broth, six pieces of plump shrimp and fried basil. If you like grits, you'll like this! If you don't, just try it. My wife isn't a fan of grits/polenta (thinks it's old people food), but she stole a few bites of my bowl before getting back to her cheese steak.\n\nNow portions are decent despite looking small than expected. Either way, you'll be fed with some of the best chow on Balboa. This is a neighborhood joint with the right upgrades and it'll be a classic if they stay as it is! To Eat Americana, I'll be back to try everything else! Cheers!", "author": "Jeremy L."}

I never liked this place, but since the menu is so big with American and Vietnamese options, I knew I could find something to eat. \n\nAlso the saying...you don't realize how much you miss something till it's gone....well...I do miss their pasta, the huge portions that comes with soup or salad and garlic bread. It's all gone. The Vietnamese side is gone too and rented out to a Ramen joint. \n\nThe remodel is nice. I was curious to try this place since the new chef came, but they redid the whole menu completely. \n\nGot the sweet potato tots off the breakfast menu. It wasn't bad. Nothing special.\n\nGot their philly cheese steak. If you want to add salad or fries you have to pay extra. I think it should have at least came with fries! The cheese steak was good, but bread was too soggy for me. \n\nHubby ordered the beef fried rice and it never came. They forgot our order. There was only 3 tables, so it's not busy. How can they forget? \n\nThe owner felt super bad, but since I had my son with me we had to leave because he didn't want to sit still anymore. He did give us the tater tots on the house. He knows my hubby has been coming here for a long time......so I have no idea when we will return. \n\nService needs to be a bit faster and they are probably working out some kinks still since they just reopened.", "author": "Karen H."}

Eat Americana is so awesome I felt compelled to write a positive review. \nI was a big fan of Cafe Americana. There basic breakfast of eggs and bacon was much more affordable than other places in area and just as good. They had amazing Loco Moco which was far superior to any of the Hawaiian restaurant chains. Their burgers were basic but better than fast food and way cheaper than other restaurant burgers. \nWhen the restaurant evolved to Eat Americana and changed the menu I was excited since I am a supporter of local businesses and I am happy to pay whatever to keep the Balboa Corridor happening and progressing to a true destination. \nEat Americana has exceeded expectations. Came here with my kids since the wife is out of town. We loved it which many parents know is hard to come by. \nMy son had pancakes which isn't that difficult to do but he has a high standard for pancakes and waffles (thanks Tyler Florence) and he rated them very high. \nMy daughter who has a more sophisticated palate had the sweet potato tater tots and the creamy polenta. The tater tots were super tasty. Great crunch with perfect texture inside with just enough sweetness. The creamy polenta was a different story. They were prolific. The cheesy goodness was well balanced and the scallions and shaved parm only enhanced the experience. This $6 starter is worth the drive out west. I have had so many exceptional polenta and grit dishes but this version was beyond perfection. I can't wait to return  to have the Shrimp Diavolo which sits on a bed of their polenta, this is a complete upscale Shrimp and Grits. \nI had the Flat Iron Pork which was also amazing. They offer it Rare or Medium Rate which might freak some but hey the farmers are much smarter now so no need to cook this meat completely through. As an entree this is one of their more high end dishes. This entree did not disappoint. The pork and sauce is comparable to any Michelin rated restaurant but the Granny Smith Apple slaw is beyond comparison. The vinaigrette sauce and potatoes are very refined but the whole dish beats out any dish that cost more than double. \nEat Americana is making great food and not charging enough. Get here before they figure that out.", "author": "Paul M."}

It is the very first stop I make whenever I travel to San Francisco.

No matter who I bring to the restaurant with me, everyone enjoys their food and goes away from the table full and very satisfied.  The portions are huge, the quality of the ingredients is superb and they manage to get the food out quite quickly which is a feat amongst itself since this is a tiny restaurant.  Jim, the chef, is very friendly and as he cooks in the middle of the restaurant, he will answer questions if you have one.  His wife greets, serves and manages to provide great service in what I would think would be quite a stressful job since the restaurant is always crowded and there are often lines out front.

The new chef was the former Chef at the beloved Broken Record and Rickybobby. Yes, the mastermind who came up with the idea of pulled pork cheesy waffle fries (with the iconic American flag sticking out of the pile of yummy goodness). And yes, that is on the menu. (!!)\n\nThey have an open kitchen. You can see your food being made if you're sitting at one of the tables near it. That, to me, is pretty awesome. I love watching cooking shows so being able to watch the chef at work is a plus.\n\nAnd oh. Did I mention that they serve breakfast all day? Their brioche French toast was some of the best I've ever had! It's served with fresh strawberries and a healthy serving of whipped cream. Oh yes, oh yes.\n\nGotta give this place a try!

After the usual back and forth (\"what about ____?\"... \"nah.\"), we randomly found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. The reviews were good and the menu looked promising, and who doesn't love a place that serves breakfast all day? \n\nWe arrived around dinner time and the place was actually quite empty - maybe 3 other tables were taken. As another reviewer mentioned, that usually gets the spidey-senses tingling, but we were undeterred.  The vibe in the restaurant is very causal. Several flat screen TVs on the walls with an open kitchen right in the middle.  I tend to like restaurants with open kitchens because its usually fun to watch and more importantly you get some assurance that no funny business is going on with your food.  \n\nWe decided to share an order of the green chili mac & cheese and the country biscuit plate, plus a side order of the sausage patty.  Everything was great. Solid comfort food. Well-executed, no frills, and somewhat elevated classics.  The mac & cheese was creamy and crunchy (from the broiler) with just a slight hint of the green chili. And my favorite, the country biscuit plate, was highlighted by some of the best white sausage gravy I've had in recent memory. The biscuit, which I assume they make in-house, was also great.  The side sausage patty, which in retrospect was probably not necessary, was also very tasty and perfectly saut\u00e9ed to create a crispy outer shell that was wonderfully addictive.\n\nProbably the only downside, which was 100% our own fault, was that we went a little too cream-heavy with our selections and felt pretty bloated as we waddled out of the restaurant. We also would have appreciated a beer selection on draft, but definitely not a deal breaker. \n\nOverall, this place was exactly what we needed. No fuss, affordable, and delicious. SF has an outstanding food scene, but there are not enough places in the City like Eat Americana.  We will definitely be back!", "author": "Kaylen K."}

The restaurant was almost full, with most patrons just sitting around and waiting for their food, while the kitchen kept turning out to-go/delivery orders. We ended up waiting almost an hour for our food, and then it all was brought to the table at once, although I asked several times that we have whatever comes out first brought first, so the kids could at least nibble on something. By the time the food finally arrived, the kids were totally starving, and they devoured the grilled cheese sandwich, but at that point I expect they would have eaten anything at all. So I didn't get to taste the sandwich, but it did not look like the best grilled cheese I've ever had. No one wanted to eat the soup that came with it, and tasted like a canned tomato soup. We also had the pulled pork sandwich, which was okay, but also far from the best pulled pork, and I had the goat cheese cakes, which were greasy and tasteless, with very little goat cheese and vegetables that looked much better than they tasted. \nSo the food was edible, although not very good, and the wait unacceptable IMO.

Price up too. \n\nI guess the owner wants a change and decided to compete with cassava. \n\nFront renovation with modern designs and bright neon lights with heater outside will attract young crowds. \nSimple pleasure has it upfront too. \n\nCassava did a lot to catch on public's attention infront of the restaurant. \n\nGood suggestion to the new owner.", "author": "Julio M."}

Their chicken pramagiana is nothing like what I've had since I've been coming here as a kid.. Now it tastes like cheesecake factory style foods. Pretty much typical food you find everywhere else. Very sad to see the culture of the restaurant has changed.", "author": "Steph L."}

The bread pudding French toast with fresh strawberries and homemade whip cream was to die for. We had the famous beef and bacon burger, with the bacon grinded into the burger patty. It tasted as juicy as ever. I'm looking forward to coming back to enjoy their dinner menu. Many favorites from Ricky Bobby are also on the menu including new twists. I will be enjoying many meals here in the future. The owner and staff were also very attentive, friendly and accommodating.", "author": "Brittny R."}

After being seated, they pretty much forgot about us; no tableware, napkins, water, anything.  15 minutes later, a waiter comes and asks us if we're ready to order.  I hate it when they ask that after making us wait a long time!  I mentioned that after the long wait, yes, we're ready to order.  The waiter looks at me like \"you have your nerve to complain!\".  I didn't take it further, as I didn't want him spitting in my food!\n\nI ordered decaf coffee with my meal, as I greatly reduced my caffeine intake.  He brought out a cup of hot water and a packet of decaf instant coffee.  I told him to just give me regular coffee instead and he insisted that I try the decaf.  After a couple of sips, I had him bring me the regular coffee.\n\nEventually, our food was brought out, but one order at a time with long pauses between each order.  My wife's order was last, and my son was almost finished with his before it came out.  For the price of each plate, I was a bit surprised that toast didn't come with the meal.  Also, serving sizes were pretty small for the price.  My son had the bread pudding French toast, and 4 small squares, each about a mouthful, came out with a lot of whipped cream.  We had 4 different dishes, and they were all okay, but not worth coming for.\n\nI know some people love this place, but we won't be coming back.  Oh well, different strokes for different folks.", "author": "W J."}

Though I will miss the old menu tremendously, the new items are pretty awesome.  Hands down, my fave were the bread pudding French toast and eggplant lasagna.  Homemade, all from scratch.  Seriously, the bread pudding was probably the best I've had.  The shrimp polenta and burger were pretty darn good too.  I'd recommend going with a few friends and trying everything family style so you can get a better taste of the new menu.  The best part is that Americana still kept everything on their menu under $20.  High quality food for a decent price.  It doesn't get any better than that.", "author": "Lusa L."}

He recognized my friend who hadn't been there in years and offered us a sample of Their pulled pork waffle fries which was delicious from start to finish. We then ordered a simple caprese salad where normally they deep fry their mozzarella..but they kept it simple for us. I then got their country biscuit breakfast with 2 eggs and gravy. Would reccomend for brunch and lunch. Cute dining experience! :)", "author": "Nerrissa M."}

I learned that there was new ownership or a new chef, so I tried it again today. The service was sssssllllllllooooooowwwwww. It took forever just to get menus, then water, then to order, then to get our food. The food was OK. Nothing to gush about, but not bad. I got a breakfast burrito, and for $12 I expected a salad or some fruit or something else on the plate. But nope. It was a giant plate with a burrito cut in half on it, making it look very small. My 2-year-old had the grilled cheese with tomato soup, which was what it was. I was going to get a hot chocolate, but at $4, I'm glad I asked if it was real hot chocolate or from a powder packet. He said it was from a packet. This city has gotten out of control with pricing. $30 for a small lunch for 1 adult and 1 toddler is a little ridiculous. The bread pudding french toast sounded good, but not sure how quickly we'll be back, unless we plan ahead and have tons of time.", "author": "Amy B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-10-04", "description": "I had a craving for an Americana burger so I call them up only to discover they've completely  re-done their menu. They still had a burger on the \"new\" menu though so I decided to give it a try hoping they at least kept that and man was I disappointed. The old Americana burger came on a french roll (it sounds weird I know....but it was actually pretty amazing) and the burger itself had so much flavor. I don't usually order burgers out as they range all over the place, but Americana never missed the mark. Fast forward to new Americana burgers....it came on a regular bun, but the top of the bun was super thick. Added to that they put some kind of sauce on it so that the bottom part of the bun became mush. And the burger meat itself....ugh that thing had no taste. The restaurant got a much needed face lift and looks great, but I wish they would have kept the old burger formula. I can't speak for anything else on the menu, but we won't be back to try it out either.", "author": "Nina M."}
