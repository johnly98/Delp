Buffalo chicken was added as well as random veggies but I chalked this fail to personal taste. \n\nToday I ordered the lasagna. \nIt seemed like a big portion but is actually swimming in sauce. Literally swimming to the point where if u try to use a fork to eat it, u cannot cut a piece since everything is just free floating around.

For those busy days where we can't seem to find time to cook dinner. Very happy that it usually takes no more than 40 minutes from order to delivery on a week night. I imagine weekends can take a little longer.\n\nAs for the pizza, we usually order a medium half Hawaiian / half meat lovers. The first time they got it right, but the second time they combined the two. It still tasted good, so I'm not complaining. I believe it's more of an issue of ordering through the DoorDash app that made the confusion. Disclaimer: the DoorDash app doesn't make it easy to choose 1/2 options. \n\nAnyways the pizza, itself was good. Yes, the crust is thick and it is greasy. Yes, you can find higher quality pizza elsewhere. But for the speed of delivery, this isn't bad and I will still continue to order from here for delivery.", "author": "Lauren P."}

Ordered delivery like I normally do and after an hour of waiting with zero updates, I thought I should call the restaurant. I did and they did not receive my order. The man I spoke with (and this is why I am giving 3 stars) continued to cut me off while I tried to provide him with more information as to where the order should be going. He said, \"Let me call my driver and I'll call you back\" to which I replied, \"Do you have my number?\" He repeats a phone number to me which is not mine. I then ask him, \"Do you know the address it should be going to?\" To which he replies an address that is not mine. The three stars is for not verifying the information, not offering any sort of apology (I understand there's not much you can do when an order does not reach your establishment from a third party) but most importantly he was impatient with me and I remained generally pretty calm until he scoffed at the end of our conversation when I asked him to clarify who I should be contacting to sort this out. (Oddly enough it says if there is a problem with your order to contact the establishment directly) I am all for waiting longer to have order be fulfilled but I am not okay with not be treated as a valued customer. I do hope the next person this happens to will have a better customer service experience than I did.

I shared a slice of the cheese pizza and it was great, in fact it was fantastic. Maybe it was the fact that pizza when drunk is one of the best things ever, in fact, it had a lot to do with it.\n\nMy second experience came on a Monday night after work, wanting a not-too-heavy dinner before a workout. They have a good menu with different options, from create your own, to signature pizzas. The only thing is, if you want anything more than cheese or pepperoni as a slice, they just add the toppings on to the slices. It's not authentically made, if that makes sense.\n\nThe guy explained this to me beforehand, and I was fine with it since I didn't want a whole pizza. I decided to go with a create your own and got mushroom and artichoke hearts. The slices are big. Though the taste wasn't great, they have a lot of seasonings that you can add to enhance flavor - pepper flakes, parmesen, oregano (I think) and even tapatio!\n\nIt was my first time having tapatio on a pizza, but damn that sh*t is good!\n\nThe pizza slice alone wasn't great. It probably has a lot to do with them just popping the mushroom and artichoke hearts on top of the pizza instead of making it together with the cheese and sauce.

I ordered our pizza and when it was delivered, the order was wrong. I gave them a call to let them know, and after a few passes of the call (i was expecting them to give me the cold shoulder), they decided to give us a whole second pizza! I know this is not the norm, and I'm not sure if the quality is the same as it used to be, but this is just a honest business trying to continue making a living.

We ordered a pizza, and it took over an hour to arrive. (We take care of our mother's home in the Sunset district, not 10 mins from them.) The pizza was wrong (wrong crust, wrong toppings) and tasted horrible, and when we called, they told us that they were putting a credit into the system for next time.\nWe called again this evening, and asked to use our credit. We were told that they had no record of our address or phone number. A little while later, we called from a different number and gave them our address for a delivery. The gentleman on the phone said \"This number isn't the phone number we have connected to this address. Isn't your number xxx-xxx-xxxx?\" That's when we said, wait a minute! We thought you had no record of our phone number or address!! He didn't know what to do with himself. and after stammering for a couple of minutes, hung up on us.\nSeriously, if you are going to provide that type of customer service, you really need to shut it down, or hire new staff...It's a shame really, because the Sunset needs more good restaurants, and is willing to support businesses.

I used to live 1/2 block from the flagship store in North Beach and whenever possible I order NBP.  I have even turned in-laws who live in Daly City on to NBP and they drive all the way in to pick-up their orders.\nOkay, on a lazy week night I decided to order in and went on-line to order up our \"usual\". A year or so ago they changed they on-line ordering option and you can not longer pay directly through the site, which is a pain, but the plus side is you can simply re-order from past deliveries.\nIf you're going to pay via credit card you now need to call and give them the information after you place the on-line order (the previously mentioned pain). I called, gave the guy my info and thought I was good to go.  30 or so minutes later the driver showed up and told me my credit card didn't go through.  Somewhat perturbed I grumbled up the stairs to call and ask why they didn't call me to say there was a problem.  Below is an abbreviated version of that conversation:\nMe - why didn't you call to say my credit card didn't go through?\nRude Guy - I didn't want to bother you.\nMe - how would that be a bother?\nRG - just pay cash.\nMe - I don't have cash, that's why I gave you the credit card.\nRG - ok, send the food back\nMe - I don't want to send the food back, I ordered for dinner!  Can we try the card again?\nRG - ok, but it failed.\nI gave the card numbers again to be told:\nRG - it failed, you don't have any money.\nMe - WHAT? The machine says I don't have any money?\nRG - no, it failed. We run hundreds of cards. Yours failed, you don't have any money.\nMe - would you STOP saying I don't have any money?\nRG - the card failed, you don't have any money.\nThis went on for a few more minutes until he handed the phone over to the \"Manager\".  When I asked why I wasn't called when the card failed and said I was appalled at the demeanor of the guy on the phone she tried to make excuses for him saying \"he said the wrong thing, people make mistakes\" to which I responded if you're people aren't trained don't let them answer the phone!  I gave the \"Manager\" another card (same account, different debit card - see I DID have money!) and went down to collect my food and tip the driver.\nI was so disturbed I called back and asked to speak to the owner and was told to call Al at the Mission Street Store.\nI called Al and gave relayed my frustration and that I was ready to pull the plug on my 30-year relationship with them.  He seemed genuinely apologetic and asked for my phone number so he could 'send me a letter\". I gave him my number but said I didn't want anything but for him to do something about the HORRIBLE customer service.\nOk...forward two weeks; I know I said I didn't want anything but I did think I would at least get a letter of apology from Al but alas, nothing.\nSorry NBP, another bad customer service move...it's officially over.  We're going to miss our thin crust, light sauce, light cheese, sausage, mushroom and onion pizzas.", "author": "Us And J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-09-29", "description": "I want to emphasize that this review is specific to the Taraval location. I've had food from other North Beach Pizza locations and they have always been solid. \n\nI don't often write Yelp reviews, but tonight was one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had with food delivery. My family just moved into  new home this weekend and we were exhausted so we ordered pizza to be delivered. Given the good experience I've had with other NBP locations I figured his was a very safe choice. I placed a relatively simple order for 3 pizzas (2 small, 1 large). While ordering the guy on the phone took his time and seemed like he was being very thorough- he was not. I should have guessed something was wrong when I had to ask him if I could give him a card number before ending the call (he never asked how I wanted to pay). \n\nWhen the driver showed up, she only had 2 pizzas and one of them was the wrong kind. I tried explaining the situation to the driver, but it took a while for her to understand what was wrong. She kept trying to get me to take the wrong order.  She took out her cell phone and made a call to the restaurant and I spoke to the man who has taken my order, Jose. When I spoke to him he seemed to not believe me that the order was wrong, but afer about  5 minute conversation he was apologizing and told me they would come back with the correct order.  We reviewed what I had ordered and he said he remembered it but it didn't match what he had in the computer. It seemed he was taking ownership of the situation (which is what you are supposed to do in a customer service situation when mistakes are made) by saying \"I've been working here 20 years and I have never made this mistake before\" (I now find that claim HIGHLY dubious). He also said that the combo pizza they had sent was the same price as the one that I had ordered and that we would keep the same bill and he would  not charge me for the 3rd pizza (a small cheese). This seemed a very reasonable solution and if they had just done that I would have been fine with them and certainly would not have bothered to write a Yelp review. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later the same driver came back, with the correct orders, and then she handed me a bill for the 3rd pizza. I was stunned. I explained to her what Jose had told me. Once again I end up on the phone with Jose. He had the audacity to expect me to pay after he told me it would be free and his explanation was outrageous. He said, \"Yes, I told you it would be free but you have to pay because I did not charge you\". No tact, no attempt to explain the situation and I felt bad for the poor driver that was stuck in he middle of it. Jose began to argue with me and I told him I was absolutely never ordering from them again at which point he finally said \"OK, just keep the pizza\". I had to argue with him to get him to honor his word. Really poor service  \n\nNow, if the pizza had been as good as other North Beach Pizza locations, I again might have let this slide and chalk i up to a bad night, but OH MY- the pizza was bland, the vegetables were just huge chunks of vegetable that hadn't really been chopped and the sauce was AWFUL. The roof of my mouth is still trying to reject the acidity of it an hour later. \n\nThe experience I had with the Taraval location tonight is not consistent with the quality of other North Beach Pizza locations, but after tonight I am more skeptical of the chain in general.", "author": "Jon B."}

Fail.  Although the sticks were still damn good, they weren't what I had been fantasizing about for 35 minutes.  But when I went and checked the menu I was less upset when i saw that they infact DO NOT have mozzarella sticks like I thought.

When you take a bite you realize oh snaps ninja pepperoni hidden under that cheese! Their pepperoni is not so tiny and puny but they are huge slices. They know what's up here. Their sausage topping is bomb diggity. I usually get pesto pepperoni. Their pesto is finger licking delicious. I've never personally had other pizzas except pepperoni, sausage, pesto, and \"supreme\". But the portion of this pizza is perfect and divine.\n\nJust double park. Who cares. It's Taraval street. \n\nPrices are normal. $10-25 depending on what size and how many toppings you get. You could get a personal pizza for $6-7. \n\nThe people are awesome.

The crust is extremely thick, but the cause is zesty and tasty.  I've only ordered slices here, which have been of varying degrees of freshness.  There are worse (and better) places for pizza, but this place will do the trick.", "author": "Matthew P."}

The pizza is delicious and hot. The garlic bread has a little too much garlic for my liking. I love the fact that they do a half and half if you want. This place is pretty awesome!", "author": "Rebecca T."}

I actually don't mind the doughy crust. I've tried some of their pasta entrees and thought it was ok. The real draw is the pizza.", "author": "chip n. c."}

BLAH time to wash that taste out with some beer. definately..", "author": "melanie t."}

And that category is pizza. If you are an east coast transplant, the quicker you come to terms with this fact the better off you will be. A few weekends ago I was visiting San Francisco and hosting some family and friends in my apartment-y vacation rental in the sunset. I had intended to cook for folks, but it had been a long day and by the time we got back to the place we were absolutely starved. The owner of the unit I was renting suggested North Beach Pizza and specifically the Pizza Verdi  which has spinach, pesto and white sauce to feed the group. I ordered two large pies. I must've been tired, and forgotten which coast I was on, because when I asked for the total after placing my order I internally gasped when I heard that it was fifty bucks.  Is this absolutely amazing pizza? No. And if you're from the east coast? Hell no. But it was delivered quickly, with the knock on our door occurring well before the promised time. And it was reasonably good pizza- not too greasy with an acceptable crust and decent topping distribution. But I second whomever it was that mentioned the lack of sauce. Good for lastminuteohgodI'msohungry grubbin, mmm hmmm.", "author": "Greycella L."}

People say it's too greasy but it's pizza and I'm sure the greasiness is half of what makes it so delicious. Their slices are good and cheap. their pasta is decent but a bit messy to take home. Their salads are good and big for how cheap.", "author": "Jennifer S."}
