The staff were friendly greeted me as soon as I entered. I was craving won ton soup so I ordered the combo which included beef pork chicken shrimp and scallops. A pretty good size bowl of soup filled with food and not just broth for 10$. The soup was hot in temperature freshly made . I got a little greedy and ordered the lunch combo orange chicken over rice for 8.50$ it came with a full plate of orange chicken Crispy and a bowl of white rice. The orange chicken sauce was a little tangy but over all good. \n\nI'm good with this spot I'll come back", "author": "Mike H."}

Their steamed fish and fish soup were really good. The best part was that it was reasonably priced. The steamed fish was very fresh, and the meat was cooked to perfection and not overcooked where it became dry. Additionally, we also ordered the steamed giant clams. When I have ordered this at other restaurants, the vermicelli noodles are sometimes very plain. The way that this restaurant prepared it was great because they had a lot of garlic and the right amount of the soy sauce mix that made the noodles perfect! The clam itself was also very tender. Another plus is that it was very affordable. We also ordered a snow pea leaves dish. Not the best that i have had, but it was not overly oily and I could tell that the vegetables were fresh as well. I will be coming back to this restaurant again soon. \n\nGreat price and great food! I also appreciated that the waiters are not pushy and try to get you to order a lot of dishes. They gave good recommendations and were able to give us the details of the different dishes when we were trying to decide what we wanted to order. \n\nParking can be a little tough, depending on what time you arrive, so I would recommend trying to find parking a block or two away and don't forget to give yourself extra time to find parking.", "author": "Lynn T."}

We finally stopped going there because there were not enough dishes that we could order and feel satisfied enough after each ordered meal. \n\nPros:\nSweet and sour pork - I'd say that among all the neighborhood Chinese restaurants, they knew how to make the pork well. The meat was soft and not hardened that you would get when it had been deep friend multiple times. The batter was crispy enough. The sauce was not overly sweet.\n\nCons:\nChinese broccoli - If you could overcook Chinese broccoli, it says a lot about the quality of the food. The broccoli was soggy. Very disappointing.\n\nChinese bacon with mustard green - This dish is a pork belly dish. I ordered this dish a number of times. The meat was freezer-burned each time.\n\nI liked the owner.

This was on a Tuesday night at 7PM with my mom. Typically when my mom and I got to any chinese restaurant for the first time, we will order two dishes to use as a reference point as listed below. Before we even went in, there was not a single customer inside and as we all know, that is a bad sign since even the caucasians knows not to go to any chinese restaurant if no chinese goes to it as that is a major No No but I just had to see if the high Yelp! ratings after multiple change of ownership within 3 years can be trusted! ;)\n\n1) Beef Chow Dried Chow Hor Fun or stir-fried flat wide noodles $6.50 - the waitress has never heard of this dish in her entire life when the waiter told her it's just Beef instead of Chicken. This should already be a bad sign. ;)  When this dish came out - it was about 2/3rd the portion size of Yan Yan and Empero Taste. There was no much beef as basically they took very thin slice of beef and cut it into pea size pieces. The flavor was average as it used too much baking soda which had had bitter taste but lacks what the chinese calls wok hei.\n\n2) Mandarin/Peking Spare Ribs $7.50 which are just a type of Sweet and Sour Pork Chops - When this dish came out, it was 1/2 the size of Yan Yan and Empero Taste as far as portion size goes. And as these are known as gwat or bone in chinese, they really defined it as basically picture it like this, they bought Pork Chop End Sirloin Chops, the cheapest type of pork chops available at the supermarket and then basically kept 90% of the meat to sell in other dishes and gave you all the leftover bones instead, similar to what the local family dog would get after the owners are finished with their meat that included bones on it. The flavor was decent.\n\nForgot to mention earlier that they provide complimentary Spanish Redskin peanuts but there is no house soup and dessert which appears to be the normal these days at Chinese restaurants. Yan Yan does not provide free house soup during dinner but they always provide free marinated chicken feet for lunch and dinner with a unlimited quantity of desserts of which you can choose from 5 different options.\n\nBasically, for the price, it is a major rip-off in another way to say it. Yan Yan is good but Empero Taste is even more gooder with bigger portions at the same price as Yan Yan as a fellow friend pointed out which was also how I discovered Empero Taste.", "author": "Vincent P."}

My credible source said this place was once better a few years back before a divorce that took place, but my visit was still marked by a very celebratory atmosphere where every table was filled, including two separate and ongoing birthday banquets to further the family-oriented vibe. \n\nThis d\u00e9cor reeked authenticity as special Hakka dishes were written on the walls with a modest layout that will take you back in time. My order of half Hakka chicken ($7.75) came with a sizable portion of steamed chicken and a tasty side of ginger sauce. The chicken was delicious but I didn't anticipate it to tastes identical to the Cantonese steamed chicken. My order of stir fry string beans ($5.95) from the wall specials was one of the better ones I've had. The flavor encompassed a generous portion of string beans stir fried with jalapenos, plenty of juicy gooey grounded pork, and a tiny spoon of red pepper to give a slight kick. I thought the string beans could be stirred in the wok a little longer for it to dry but the grounded pork was a major obstacle since the ones being served were ultra fatty. I thought their steamed rice was okay but for some reason it didn't hit the spot. \n\nThere was no noticeable difference in service as I was treated the same as any other big tables. To my delight I was given a complimentary sweet red bean dessert and fortune cookie afterward to give it a strong finish. The red bean dessert had hint of mandarin orange that I thought was interesting but still delicious. I thought the meal was a strong 3.5 stars until I discovered a $1.80 overcharge for the string beans. What a let down after a pretty decent meal! It's time to go back to Eight Immortals where authentic expressions were just as affordable and on point. 3 stars for the overall experience.", "author": "Daniel L."}

Where else are you going to find a place this cheap for a FULL lobster and a heaping plate of tasty noodles during dinner hours?  The next cheapest place I found in the bay area is $14 at dinner, but that's hard to find.  I have no clue how they can make a profit on this dish because the cheapest lobster I've seen in the supermarket is $6.99/lb and these lobsters are greater than 1 lbs., and prepared much better than you could at home.  And you know what?  The lobster is fresh and they don't cheat you.  The lobster tank is in plain view at the back and you literally WATCH them take out the live lobster.  Within 10 minutes, you will have a big plate of an entire dissected lobster on top of creamy noodles (flat egg noodles).  I also don't know how they cook it so fast.\n\nYou should also consider their crab.  I think they charge $8/lb.  Most of their crabs are probably in the 3 lbs. range or about $24.  That's pretty damn good.  Think about it.  All you 'trendy' followers love go to R&G Lounge and PPQ to get their amazing 2.5 lbs. crab for $40.  I don't know why.  Dragon River is just as good and half the price.  You also see them take it out of the tank when you order crab.  \n\nOther stuff to try\n-Remember, this is a Hakka restaurant, so they serve Hakka dishes in addition to the regular Chinese stuff\n-Salt-baked Chicken - Pretty good and juicy.  This is done exactly how it's supposed to be - plain, but tender and moist.  Use their generous dipping sauces to add flavor.  \n-Clay Pots - They actually stuff this very well and it's generally cheaper (under $10) than most places.  \n\nDessert\n-They give you a free hot dessert soup at the end, based on what they make during that day.  We've had black seasame and taro dessert soups.  Free is always great!\n\nService\n-Service might be a little slow, but that's because it's a family restaurant and the lady server has to take care of everybody.  It's not slow because she's lazy.  She's actually working 2x faster than most servers out there.  It's just a lot of dishes to bring and clean up for the size of the restaurant.  But she always brings a smile.

We were thinking at first that this place must have been hit hard by the tough economic times since for the first 30 minutes of us being there, it pretty much remined quiet.  \n\nSlowly however, folks started to trickle in, and before we knew, the whole place was packed. I'm so glad to see this place doing well, as my family and I have been coming here for years with my paternal grandma, before she passed away a few years ago. \n\nAnyway, we started off dinner with Corn and Minced Chicken Soup.  The soup was definitely big enough fro 6-7 people, but we only had 4 of us, so we had much left over.  6 bucks is insanely reasonable.  Soup was so  y u m m y, had great amounts of minced chicken and corn, and egg white in every bite. \n\nFor entree's, we ordered The Szcheuan Chicken, Steak Cube with Bok Choy, and Fried Tofu with Oysters and Pork.  \n\nEverything came out looking so juicy and appetizing...and needless to say, it all definitely was.  The Chicken was tender, and the flavor was perfectly spicy.  It also came with slices of zuccini and garlic.  Steak Cube with Bok Choy was also very good.  There was a bit too much pepper flavor for me, but overall, tasty dish.  Finally the Fried Tofu with Oysters and Pork came in a clay pot.  Tofu was cooked and fried perfectly.  I hate when the tofu breaks into pieces when  you try to pick it up, but here, it was hard on the outside, and fluffy on the inside.\n\nService here was typical of a Chinese restaurant.  No real thoughts here.  After our meal they gave us complimentery Tapioca and Taro dessert.  My absolute favorite hot dessert at Chinese restaurants.  I was so wanting more, so I asked the waiter, who as a very nice man, if I could have some to-go.  To my surprise he agree'd and gave a portion enough to feed 4 people for free.  =D\n\nEvery dish was under 8 bucks, so total bill came out to about $40.00.

Dragon River was recommended by several of the neighbors from the Park Presidio Neighbors organization whom we assisted.\n\nWe walked into an empty restaurant on a Saturday afternoon.  Greeted by the waitress we were seated at a big round table in the corner of the restaurant.  There were several fish tanks beside our table with live crabs and what looked like catfish.  We took turns visiting the rest rooms to wash the dirt and soil from our hands.  The men's room was surprisingly clean, but we were probably the first customers of the day.\n\nWe decided to eat family style instead of having each person order for themselves.  Together we ordered two appetizers being fried won tons and potstickers, and four main dishes along with steamed rice.\n\nThe service was very good.  Our waitress was very attentive, and brought us all forks in addition to our chopsticks anticipating that some of us might not know how to use the chopsticks.  I was very much thankful to one of the volunteers who stepped up to take care of the ordering process because he spoke Mandarin fluently.  As the only Chinese person in the group I was nervous about using my \"toi san\" with the waitress.\n\nOur fried won tons were pretty much what I expected.  The deep fried crispy won ton skins with a smidgen of pork filling were accompanied by a sweet and sour sauce, a red pepper sauce and a green pepper and garlic sauce.  The potstickers were big and plump with a juicy filling of pork and cabbage.  These came with a dispenser of white vinegar.  Both were okay.\n\nThe first of our main dishes was the Mu Shu Pork which came with six thin pancakes and hoisin sauce.  I was pretty wiped out from our project and didn't even focus on what I was eating.  I recall there were tender strips of pork mixed with shredded cabbage and strips of mushroom.  It's a dish I would probably never order for myself, but it tasted pretty good.  The clay pot dish with braised chicken, Chinese sausage and mushrooms was excellent.  There weren't enough pieces of the sausage to go around, but the dish was seasoned very well, and nobody really seemed to mind that the chicken pieces all had bones attached.\n\nDo not ever order the Curry Chicken with Green Peppers and Onions.  I simply did not understand this dish.  Am I correct in saying that chicken is a tender meat?  Has anyone ever bitten into a thinly sliced piece of chicken only to encounter a super chewy piece of meat?  With that in mind I was quite baffled as to why they add baking soda to their chicken slices.  Many restaurants use baking soda to tenderize meats.  Why in hell would you need to tenderize chicken?  It just made the chicken really slimy like.  The bright yellow curry sauce had very little curry taste.  This was a truly disappointing dish.\n\nOne of the volunteers insisted on ordering a baked crab, and we left him with the entire crab and the $30 price tag that came along with it.  I'd be willing to come back and try some of their more traditional dishes as the clay pot dish was very appealing, but for what we ordered I'd give this restaurant a very average score.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

It had lots of ingredients that I wasn't familiar with, but it was good. The Hot & Sour Soup that I'm used to has bamboo shoot, black mushroom, tofu, and egg. The one at Dragon River also had shrimp, pork, and daylily buds. I also really like how they weren't skimpy on the ingredients AND the soup didn't have a layer of sesame oil. \n\nThe Peking Pork Spareribs was good, too. The portion seemed smaller compared to most Chinese restaurant I've been to, but I guess it was justifiable for its price. The pork didn't have a whole lot of bones, which I think makes it even more worth it. \n\nTwo tables down, those people ordered the Walnut Shrimp and Chicken with Green Onions and Oil which looked and smelled very delicious. I would like to try those next time. \n\nThey have a vast selection! My boyfriend was a little disappointed that they didn't have General Tso's Chicken. :( \n\nThe place was kind of dirty.

Despite this joint being empty and not a soul in sight, I acquiesced because the fellow did a quick scan on his iPhone and per Yelp (yes, you heard that right) the reviews for the other place was slightly mediocre.  Ok.  I swallowed my breath and we walked in.  Hmmm.  Cantonese/Hakka cuisine.  I was intrigued.\n\nThe take-out menu here was immense.  So much so, that even this Asian was totally lost and the fine print became smaller to escape detection.  I usually go with a noodle dish with a meat dish and then balance out the salty with a sweet dish.  \n\nDespite my craving won ton soup, we decided to get the House Chow Fun with steamed bok choy and lots of stir fried beef, drizzled with gravy.  The meat dish was to satiate his inclination for anything ginger and instead of beef (I'm not too happy about the kind of beef utilized in many a Chinese restaurant.......the wrinkled slices seem to resemble the mixed hapa child of Arby's and the local Korean beef dish) so I slipped in my two cents and we had it upped to pork instead.  This dish was so gingery I almost passed out: hot peppery slices of fresh ginger, zinged with bits of sweet pineapple.  Pretty impressive and the fellow was delighted, even when I was throwing the extra slices of ginger onto his plate.  In addition, I've tried their standard chow mein here and it was chock full of vegetables and thick slices of char siu, just the way our Chinese neighbor use to throw together and bring over for NYE.  \n\nIn all, decent prices and everything for around $25 or so.  Then, they pulled the typical move on me.  Every time I hit a Chinese restaurant and the person I'm with is not Asian, they forget to throw in chopsticks.  FAIL!  I had to request chopsticks for the both of us, although I'm not really one to assume anything.\n\nAnother plus?  They deliver.  That's right!  Minimum order is $15 but they deliver, woohoo!

So, of course, we went to Ton Kiang, but after looking at the menu, we realized they did not actually have a lot of dishes that were considered authentic (even the waitress noted that they took a bunch of items off the menu due to lack of popularity).  Yelp mobile helped me find Dragon River, just a few blocks down the way.\n\nWe were a little apprehensive walking in, but then saw a fairly full restaurant. with lots of Asian families.  We ordered a bunch of dishes and they were all really really good.  The service was not as speedy or attentive as Ton Kiang, but the food was fresh (get the salt and pepper shrimp and the oysters with black bean sauce) and the prices much more reasonable (bill for 5 people ended up under $60 without tip).  This is definitely more of a homestyle type of place, but that is how I like my Chinese food.\n\nDon't be intimidated by the Chinese menu items on the wall -- the written menu includes pretty much everything on the wall (at lease that is what my aunt and uncle said) and is very extensive (and filled with regular Chinese food items).", "author": "Mitzi C."}

The food here is super cheap & good . We got the $38 combo written on the wall in Chinese . It consisted of 8 dishes . What a steal !! The soup was a seafood soup which was really good but contained too much MSG which I didn't really like because it made my tongue very dry afterwards . The shrimp & walnut was good and flavorful . I liked how they made their shrimp and how they didn't put too much mayonaise . The clams in black bean sauce was GOOD & very flavorful . The chicken was okay .. tastes like Chicken from Safeway . The fish was good and flavorful . I liked the texture of it . It was very smooth . I didn't really like the vegetable dish .. it was too salty . I didn't like the last dish either .. it was some kind of fatty meat . It tasted very weird .. esp. the sauce it came with . Only complaint I have is that the food took WAY TOO LONG to arrive . It took 30 minutes for the first dish which was the soup to arrive . It took like an hour for all of the dishes to arrive . I'm definitely coming back .", "author": "Eileen L."}

This Hakka restaurant is essentually as good as Ton Kiang, only barebones and cheeper.  The staff is very friendly and you cannot beat the rockbottom prices.  For truly authentic food, stick to the chef's recommendations and Hakka specialties sections of the menu.  The pot stickers are big and crispy golden with a juciy, well seasoned ground pork, cabbage, and ginger filling.  The salt baked chicken is supurb with tender bone on chicken with a biting and savery ginger garlic sauce.  The wine flavored prawns with pickled greens are suculent with a sweet wine sauce and sweet and sour-like pickled greens.  The steamed rice is firm and fluffy.  For dessert, the red bean pudding is very flavorful with fresh red beans in a naturally sweet broth.  Round the meal off with a Ching Dao beer and you will not be disappointed.  I am deducting a star because they do not give the wine by the glass, only by the liter.  But, none went to waste as they let my mother offer customers a glass; I even ended up having the last 2 /2 glasses.  It was either a red or white sparkling wine which was kind of sweet which is what I like, considering I seldom drink wine.  I will definitely return again to try more dishes.  So, for excellent Hakka cuisine in a barebones but clean atmosphere with friendly service at rockbottom prices, Dragon River cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}
