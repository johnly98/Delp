We'd been missing it recently and stumbled upon this absolute gem. If you are looking for authentic Mediterranean food in the Bay Area at a reasonable price, this is your place! \n\nTuba is tucked away on a quiet street corner in the Mission District and possesses a fantastic staff that demonstrates extreme attention to detail and is generous with their bread! The hummus is fresh and tasted fantastic next to the bread. The Kuzu Sis was perfectly cooked and the Musakka was extremely wholesome. \n\nOverall, a fantastic restaurant with great food and great service. Well worth the visit!", "author": "Taimur A."}

Our large group was packed in with a ton of other large groups. The place was pretty loud and you definitely felt like you had to head out and get a breath of fresh air once you were done eating. I will say the service was pretty solid for how packed the place was and the menu had a ton of tasty options.\n\nNot surprising the appetizer menu here is hard to narrow down. So much deliciousness! While the grape leaves weren't my favorite I did enjoy many of the other dishes the table ordered like the hummus and falafel. Our table was pretty split in ordering the lamb or the salmon. I opted for the salmon and was super happy with my choice. The fish was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The creamed spinach that came along with it-- I could just eat a quart of it easily. It was really delicious. \n\nOverall a great place for dinner, but maybe not so much for a large group.", "author": "Holly K."}

The restaurant has a nice homey feel, coincidentally 2 birthday serenades took place tonight that made the place feel warm and welcoming! We ordered three entrees: Sarma beyti kebab (beef wrapped in bread with tomato and yogurt garlic sauce), karniyarik (eggplant with ground beef), and the manti (hidden menu item of beef dumplings and yogurt garlic sauce).\n\nThe manti was delicious, handmade garlic and beef dumplings with enough sauce to dip our complimentary fresh baked bread.  The sarma beyti kebab was filling and perfectly edible with each bite size gently wrapped in a type of bread that absorbed the tomato and yogurt - it had a very slight spicy kick. The karniyarik eggplant + beef dish was reminiscent of a Mediterranean take on chilli. The rice pudding dessert was a perfect finisher.

Tuba did not disappoint. My friend and I were the first to arrive, and we were deciding between the two ros\u00e9s on the menu, when our server offered us a taste of each - very nice! We opted for the drier of the two, which was served in chilled glasses which I thought was an awesome touch. Nothing better than a super cold glass of ros\u00e9, in my opinion. \n\nWhen the rest of our group arrived, we ordered a selection of appetizers. Hummus, falafel, and a baked shrimp and feta dish were just some of the dishes among many we shared. This was a great start to the meal and everything I tasted was delicious.\n\nThe chicken dish I had my eye on wasn't available that night, so I opted for the baked salmon with creamed spinach. My other thought was to go for the off-menu dumplings in Greek yogurt sauce, but I will have to try those next time. The salmon proved to be a great choice - a nice mix of healthy and rich/savory on one plate. \n\nEveryone was stuffed after their meals and we skipped dessert. It's worth noting that service was excellent and the staff worked together so you could make eye contact with any of the servers and they would be right over to help (usually just for another glass of wine since they were so on top of everything else, including water refills).

One bite of the FALAFEL and we realized that our 40 minute was completely worth it. It was the perfect flavor-packed fritter with a crisp cover. The bed of Hummus on the side was also delicious.\n\nWe also got the SIGARA BOREGI which was basically fillo dough stuffed with potatoes, feta cheese, parsley. It was a slightly on the blander side for me but my husband loved it.\n\nAnd since my husband is a vegetarian, we got the MUSAKKA to share. It was unlike any of the Musakkas I've had so far. Eggplant stuffed with the holy trinity of potatoes, zucchini, and mozzarella cheese and topped with b\u00e9chamel sauce - this dish was a showstopper! The rice and salad served on the side went perfectly well with the eggplant.\n\nNot to forget, the complimentary BREAD PLATE served in the beginning is really good too!\n\nI am definitely going back to sample more dishes from their menu.

Located in a somewhat residential part of Mission district, next to a couple of other restaurants, it's small, nice and dark, and basically non-descript.  It could be a steakhouse or a Z Gallerie exhibit, it didn't ring anything resembling Turkish.  Bottomline, it didn't transport me (and that's what I liked most in ethnic dining).  No music, no dancing, and no special d\u00e9cor.  So food, service, vibe, and energy is what's left to enjoy, and judge further.\n\nService\n=======\n...is a high-point.  Our waitress (didn't catch her name, and it wasn't listed on the receipt) was pleasant, helpful, and very nice...despite how over time, the restaurant became more and more busy.  She didn't change negatively or rushed at all.  She took her time to answer questions, and recommend.

We elected to try the Sampler Plate (\"Tuba Meze Taba\u011f\u0131\"), an 8 item cold meza plate.  Expensive, but it went very fast with 4 hangry folks.  All was good, but my favorite was the Cevizli Ezme, mainly a mixture of walnuts and red pepper paste.  [$25, 4.0 stars]\n\n2.  I vacillated between 3 entrees, so the waitress was nice enough to recommend the Adana Kebab.  Wrong choice!  One kebab, well done, tougher than wood.  Seasoned nice and slightly spicy, I liked the rice\nand charbroiled assortment of vegetables.  But was too pricy for one kebab, and really not good.

A dish of flatbread arrived with a delicious butter, a few olives and a little feta. After we polished that off we were both almost full. Then the entrees came. I had the mousaaka which my wife adored. I've been eating low dairy and it was a bit rich for me. She had the eggplant stuffed with meat and enjoyed it but liked mine better.

We enjoyed sampling everything, with our favorite being the Patl\u0131can Salatas\u0131 (pureed eggplant, very much like Baba Ganoush with a smokey flavor). This was way too much for the two of us so about half of it ended up in a to-go box.\n\nFor the main course I ordered the Tavuk \u015ei\u015f, a tender chicken skewered chicken.

One of those dishes we decided to order: \n\nH\u00fcnkarBe\u011fendi\nPureed eggplant with mozzarella cheese and garlic, topped with leg of lamb chunks in red sauce. \n\nThis was NOT a mistake by any means.

For me, mozzarella and Turkish didn't really compute. But when the dish came to the table and I got to taste it... the likeness worked it's math like a mathematician at a trigonometry convention. \n\nI also got to try the 3 day marinated legs of lamb. Flippin delicious.\n\nThese were the stand out dishes. \n\nI also did get to try the \n\nIcli Kofte\nThe Falafel\nShrimp Entree\n\nThese were less standouts than the aforementioned dishes. Fried items like the falafel and Icli Kofte tended to be a bit drier than I'd have hoped. \n\nThe Shrimp entree was good (Shrimp were cooked very well), but in comparison to the lamb chops or eggplant dish, which were so incredibly strong, paled peripherally. \n\nWouldn't hesitate to make my way back.

I was there with a relatively large group, so we ordered a bunch of appetizers to start with: stuffed grape leaves, hummus, falafel (served flattened rather than in balls, which was interesting -- still good!), a shrimp dish, and a fried ball with meat inside... I can't remember the name. All was very tasty -- I liked that the grape leaves had a touch of sweetness, and while it's relatively difficult to mess up hummus, Tuba's is smooth and creamy and tahini-y and scrumptious.\n\nFor my main, I had trouble choosing between the salmon and the lamb chops, but ended up getting the latter and was very happy with my choice. It was excellent -- they didn't actually ask how I'd like the meat cooked, but it came out as a perfect medium/medium-rare which I was very happy with. Super flavorful -- I was literally sucking the bones to get as much meat off as I could. It was served with a handful of roasted veggies and some rice on the side, which tasted good but I thought could have been a little more robust in portion and presentation.\n\nOverall, an excellent experience at Tuba! It's clearly the place to be, I even ran into someone I know from back home in Northern VA -- totally randomly! -- while there.

We we're pleasantly surprised how delicious the food was from start to finish, and the impeccable service (harder to come by!) myself and my boyfriend dined here on a Saturday night and it was packed! I would make a reservation. \n\nThe complimentary bread is delicious it comes with a few small sides (olives, feta, oil) delicious to use for your appetizers too. We ordered the red pepper cold meze it's true signature dish. We found it to be delicious! Very different and unique flavor and veggie friendly. Can easily be shared among 2-4 ppl. We also ordered the stuffed beef shells, which were also delicious! Cake with 2 and they can easily be halved and shared. The flavors were scrumptious. \n\nFor or main we shared the Adnana beef kabob. It was absolutely delicious! It's perfect to share given all the appetizers, bread and shareable food. I'm sure this could be eaten solo but with two of us sharing so many items this made sense. The kabob was juicy and flavorful! Highly recommend.\n\nWe were so full we passed on dessert but did order the Turkish tea. We have an awesome Turkish server, she was so friendly and kind she actually brought over a baclava and ice cream. It was ever so sweet and perfect amount to share. We were blown away by her service and we rarely see this sort of service at all so all in all we found this to be w highlight.\n\nDefinitely come here it's amazing and affordable with options for everyone!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-06", "description": "I made a reservation here at 6pm on a Sunday through Yelp (which by the way is super convenient). That probably wasn't so necessary as the restaurant was still quite empty at 6 and there were plenty of two-person tables. The place did become quite filled by the time we left around 7pm. It was muggy outside and the heat carried into the restaurant which unsurprisingly does not have AC. SF is not equipped for this kind of weather. It thankfully cooled down as the sun set. \n\nThe flavors of the dishes we had were all delicious but the amount of food felt incredibly small. Portion control, I guess. The service was excellent. The complimentary flatbread they bring out was yummy and perfect for eating with the accompanying seasoned butter, olives, and feta as well as the cold mezes. We also used the bread to pick up the oils from the mezes. The waitress brought us another basket presumably after seeing us wolf down the first plate of bread.     \n\nKIZARTMA (Cold Meze)\nThis appetizer came in two mounds of pan-fried eggplant, bell peppers, and zucchini topped with tomato sauce. (Both mezes came in twos actually.) I loved the natural sweetness of the vegetables (technically fruits but you know what I mean). And they were chopped and cooked to perfection. The small scoops left me craving more. \n\nCEVIZLI EZME (Cold Meze)\nA mix of walnuts, Turkish red pepper paste, tomato paste, fresh garlic, olive oil, and cumin, this  signature meze had incredibly deep flavor. It was a wonderful blend of sweet and savory. The walnuts added a nice, nutty texture. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this combination of ingredients. I also appreciated the bed of spinach.  \n\nADANA KEBAB\nA succulent kebab of spicy ground beef with lamb mixed with green and red bell peppers. The meat was very tender and easy to chew. I didn't think it was spicy at all. The portion was extremely small and probably not worth the price. It did come with rice and grilled and pickled vegetables which took up most of the plate.  \n\nKARNIYARIK (Signature Entree)\nMy favorite out of the two entrees. Even though there was half of a whole eggplant, I wished there was more of it. The baked eggplant was wonderfully tender, but its subtle flavor was overpowered by the ground beef, tomatoes, onions, and chopped parsley stuffing which was exceptionally seasoned. The flavor was very rich and deep. I could see it pairing quite well with pasta. Although I appreciate leafy greens, the salad was a bit boring. \n\nAll in all, I had a very enjoyable and hearty meal here. Everything was so flavorful and aromatic. \nI noticed that prices have gone up by $2 for the Cold Mezes and $3 for the Signature Entrees based on the menu posted in 2014 which is somewhat more reasonable than another place I went to that started raising their prices within a month. If you checkin with Yelp, you can get $5 off your tab! This restaurant also partners with Delta and every dollar spent earns you Skymiles!", "author": "Lauren H."}

It's been on my list of places to try for quite some time now, so my friend and I decided to check it out. Looking at the menu beforehand, I was excited to try new Turkish dishes in an authentic atmosphere. However, when I walked in, the vibe felt a bit stale and generic. We were sat at a very wobbly table, which our sever fixed after we pointed it out. Less than five minutes after we got sat, our server asked us what we wanted to order. Our menus hadn't even been opened! \n\nWe asked for a few minutes, and then decided to share: \n- Haydari: Cucumbers, mint and dill with creamy thick garlic yogurt. This was by far my favorite dish that we ordered. Creamy, refreshing, with a ton of flavor. They also brought over some really good bread.\n\n- Peynirli Karides: Prawns saut\u00e9ed with tomatoes and garlic in pepperoncini sauce and topped with feta cheese. Very disappointing dish. A few very small shrimp in a watery tomato \"sauce\". Had little to no flavor and maybe five small pieces of feta.\n\n- Falafel Salatas\u0131: Falafel stuffed with goat cheese, served with mix greens, cilantro, basil, red onions and orange vinaigrette. Big bowl of mixed greens with three small falafel. Tomatoes and cucumbers were nice, but otherwise just a basic house salad. No added herbs or flavors.\n\nAll in all, the food did not seem authentic. No spices, no heat, just very basic stuff. Service was basically nonexistent and we had to ask multiple times for extra bread for our first dish. Prices reasonable for SF but steep for what you get.", "author": "Regina L."}

Located near the corner of Guerrero St. and 22nd St. , Tuba is an upscale Turkish restaurant. Nice ethnic Turkish decor. The restaurant is very busy and probably best to have reservations as I saw some walk in customers get turned away. The menu has the popular Turkish items and that night had a special lamb shank, which was the best dish of the night. It was fall of the bone tender and full of flavor. Our table had the Adana Kabob, Musukka, Lamb Chops, and Karnyark as our entrees all were good. We wanted to order the fish that was in the pictures but they were out of that. The appetizers of dolmas and the pureed eggplant were meh. Service was excellent and attentive.  The minuses are the menu is very pricey for what you get with entrees starting at $24 . A minor observation was the plating of each dish was almost like a cafeteria tray without the dividers.  I am not sure if that's the Turkish style of food plating but it was odd. \n\nParking is hard in the Mission but I was able to find a spot a block away.

For folks traveling or thinking this is amazing food based on other Yelp reviews, go read the negative ones first. Either I'm very fortunate to have had AMAZING middle eastern food or other folks haven't been exposed to real authentic food and service. Trust me, there's way better food out there. I really wish I hadn't come to this place. \n\nFood: Portions are amazingly small, rice tasted bland with no color or flavor (other places I've tried have \"jeweled rice\" or at least it's flavorful). Their Chicken dishes were burnt, bland, and dry. The very few vegetables I got on my plate looked more like decorations rather than part of my meal. Hummus was okay, but their bread came out cold. We tried Baklava for dessert...disappointing to say the least so we didn't finish it. I've had much better and authentic in the Bay Area. \n\nService: Restaurant is overwhelmingly understaffed and they don't know how to manage the restaurant. Don't expect the multiple hosts to tell you the truth about wait times. The night we went had no host so different servers had to fill in. That's crazy for a busy weekend. SEVERAL parties outside (in the cold) had \"reservations,\" yet no tables were available for even a small party. They kept telling all of us waiting that the people inside were \"taking too long to finish.\" The restaurant needs to honor reservations or else state it's walk-ins only. \n\nAmbience: WAY too SMALL space, crowded, too loud of music, and worst of all, table set up is horrendous!! I know SF is tight in space, but man this was disappointing based on the pictures. The restaurant staff was assembling tables like a jigsaw puzzle to make people fit into unimaginable spaces. No one could walk comfortably, much less get out if needed for an emergency. At some point the middle walkway was blocked! This was just an uncomfortable situation.

This is a really good restaurant for regular dinner, a celebration, or a family meal.  The restaurant offers a selection of hot and cold mezes, soups and salads, entrees and desserts.  Let's not forget the specials of the day (these are specials you really want to pay attention to). \n Many of of the items are vegetarian and/or gluten free.

On the night of my visit the specials were lamb shank and sea bream.  The fish was really fresh.\n\nWe started our meal with an order of their signature meze, the Cevizli Ezme, which is a dip made of walnuts, red pepper paste, tomatoes and various spices.  It was thick and creamy and the perfect start to the meal when spread on bread.\n\nFor the entrees we shared the Adana kebab and the roasted sea bream.  The single kebab was described as spicy but I didn't find that to be the case.  However, it was flavorful and moist.  The dish came with some vegetables, pickles, a yogurt sauce and rice.  The fish was delicious, fresh and perfectly cooked.  They offered to debone it for us but still presented it as if it were whole.  The sea bream came with a salad, vegetables and pickles.  \n\nCups of turkish tea and a plate of Kunefe, sweet cheese coated in shredded phyllo soaked in syrup and nuts rounded out the meal.  The dessert wasn't too sweet or too rich and paired well with the earthiness of the tea.\n\nThe portions sizes were just right and I felt the prices were fair for the quality of the meal.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The restaurant was full the entire time of our visit and service never lapsed.\n\nThe restaurant is located in what I regard as the quieter section of the Mission such that parking was fairly easy (okay, I really lucked out).

As soon as we ordered the appetizer platter, it was out in less than 10 minutes. We decided that we were trying the Tuba Meze Taba\u011f\u0131, which was a combination of all the cold appetizers. We definitely didn't go wrong with this choice, because each item on the platter was incredible and absolutely delicious. \n\nFor the entrees we each ordered our own. Some of the items that we tried were the Karidesli Salata, Karides Tava, Tavuk \u015ei\u015f, Adana Kebab, H\u00fcnkarBe\u011fendi. Each item had its own peculiar taste and was exceptional. For the chicken and ground beef and lamb kebobs I expected their to be at least two skewers, so the portions were pretty small. The eggplant entree was absolutely mouthwatering and the lamb chunks were super tender. Overall it was a great experience. \n\nOne minor thing that was slightly annoying was that it felt like we were being rushed the entire evening.  Every time that we sat back and conversed amongst the table, the host/hostess assumed we were finished eating and would come up and start clearing our table. Other than that, the service was great!", "author": "Julia K."}

Falafel and humus are the two items that I would say are more middle eastern in general rather than really Turkish, but that depends a little where in Turkey you are from. \n\nThe dishes we ordered tastes all really good even though some deviated a little from how I know the dishes in Turkey.\n\nI only wish that they had some more options on their menu (I appreciate that this isn't that easy unless you have a much larger restaurant & kitchen). I would also recommend them skipping some items like the peynirli karides which I never order in Turkey either as it really isn't the tastiest dish (especially if you are dealing with a crowd in SF that can get great shrimp dishes with king/tiger shrimp in other places). \n\nAnother thing I missed is Raki. I know it's a licensing issue but would really love to have seen this on the menu. The availability of the Turkish wines (made from Turkish grape varieties) definitely made up for the lack of raki though.\n\nOne of the best Turkish meals I had outside of Turkey and can really recommend highly for those that want to taste Turkish food for the first time or those missing the food from back home.", "author": "Larry S."}

To give you an idea, I usually scarf down my food; a minute or two and even the largest plates are empty. Tonight I wanted every bite to last forever. The service is impeccable too - every server was polite, extremely attentive, friendly and informative and not to mention: beautiful!\n\nWhatever your fancy, you just must try the red lentil soup and the falafel. At first bite, the soup left me wanting ; I was waiting for a kick or a spice. At second taste, I was pleasantly overwhelmed at the texture and the layer of ingredients melded together. This was comfort in every bite; this was a rainy night, post breakup, cold season, long day bowl of warm hugs. Am I exaggerating? I felt better about humankind when that bowl was empty - 15 minutes later. My eyes and hands worked my way in circles around the table in every effort to make that soup last. \n\nAnd to my delight, there was so much else to pique my interest. The falafel was the best I've ever had. I'm not an expert in falafel but I've never met a falafel I didn't like. If it's on the menu, I will order it regardless. This wasn't your average falafel though. If there is a falafel heaven, Tuba's is falafel god. The texture was perfect - a slight crunch and flavor that made my tongue dizzy. Butter it up generously with hummus and you don't need anyone else to make it a date.\n\nAnd then came the entree. Our server used the word \"juicy\" twice in her description of this chicken dish served - in laymen's terms - in tomato sauce and a medley of mushrooms and other accompaniments. She could have used it thrice over and it still would have not sufficed. This chicken is to die for. Every morsel was like reuniting with a long-lost lover. I couldn't finish it. Shock and horror, but I didn't want this night to end! So the friendly girls wrapped it up with some salad (delicious) and bread (divine) and I sauntered home with my meal that would last all night long.", "author": "Obichang O."}

The restaurant's elegant appearance and welcoming staff contributed to our positive experience, and ultimately provided the ideal ending to a fun day of hiking and sightseeing.\n\nAll of the mezes we ordered were delicious, but the falafel was the most memorable by far. It was served on a bed of hummus, and paired perfectly with their complimentary warm bread. The falafel wasn't greasy or overly dense, and the spices in each piece were very pronounced.\n\nThe fried eggplant in the K\u0131zartma was fresh, and the dish contained a relatively even amount of eggplant distributed among the bell peppers and zucchini. And while the portion was small, it was still satisfying.\n\nI can't speak for the meat dishes, such as the \u0130\u00e7li K\u00f6fte, but I can say that all of our plates were polished off by the end of dinner. Visually similar to breaded meatballs or rice balls, the \u0130\u00e7li K\u00f6fte were stuffed with spicy ground beef and crushed walnuts, covered in bulgur wheat, and pan-fried. The meze includes two big pieces, which doesn't look like a lot, but is sufficient for a couple of people to share.\n\nBy the time we left Tuba, we were stuffed.

I ended up going for the item on the specials menu lamb shank, tender cook, nice tasty sauce and the shank was huge. Dinosaur bone style!\n\nI pretty much cleaned my plate and was super full. I liked it, but my meal and the beer came out to $45. Yikes.

First off, our complimentary bread was not served; despite seeing the table next to ours (they came in way after us) enjoying theirs. It wasn't until our food arrived at the table that I had to flag our server to bring us bread because we never got ours. As I should of read from the other reviewers, \"service was non existent\" seems to be quite true for this restaurant. \n\nOne of the primary reasons why we wanted to go there was because of the Manti. We saw great reviews and photos; however, when we got there for our 6:15 pm dinner, it was not available. \"Sold out\" was what the server told us. Ok, a huge disappointment, so instead of deciding to order an appetizer to share and then main entrees, we decided to share a few appetizers. We decided on a few options, Turkish cigars (Sigara Boregi), zucchini fritters (Mucver), meatballs (Icli Kofte), prawns with in tomatoes, feta cheese and garlic in pepperoncini sauce (Peynirli Karides). I specifically asked if that was way too much for us in which our table server responded \"that's good.\" Not once did she tell us it was way too much food for two. Unlike other restaurants, they'll straight out tell you if you ordered way too much and then it's up to the customer to want keep what they have. However, a couple of disappointments led us to a bad experience. Our food came out all at once in tiny small table that could not accommodate all our food. We had no room to eat since the table was jammed packed with four dishes. Given that it was all hot items, we would of enjoyed it if they brought out 2 dishes at a time so we could enjoy it while it was hot, but that was not the case, despite me asking our server if she could possibly not bring it all at once. \"Too late\" was her response. \n\nWe didn't even get to enjoy our hot food since it quickly got cold before we could move on to another dish. Not only that, my bf who is Turkish was not impressed with the food. All the dishes were mediocre and nothing beyond fantastic. My bf even made a joke about Michelin recommended huh? \n\nLooking over the table next to ours, who got there complimentary bread and olives with their appetizer order; their main entrees took well over 45 mins to arrive. At one point, I heard the couple asking the same server about their main entrees. Now I'm not sure, but this restaurant doesn't know how to service or they don't get their food timing right.

Being from Los Angeles myself, I made sure I visited Tuba Restaurant the next time I came to San Francisco. \n\nI called and booked ahead of time. Reserved a table for a party of 9 people. I told them over the phone that I was from Los Angeles and how excited I was about trying their authentic Turkish cuisines. \n\nAt first glance, the restaurant is chic and cozy, on a cute little street. Street parking was hard to find. \n\nOnce we sat down, with my American family, I introduced myself to the server and told them that I am Turkish and that I am very excited to be here. I told them about how much my friends had raved about their food, and thus, I brought my whole American family from San Francisco to try their food. \n\nWe decided to eat family style, with lots of big dishes to share. At first we ordered a bunch of appetizers. \n\nSo here is the part that drops the stars from 5 to 3: \nThe first combo appetizer plate we get, I take a bite off the spinach dip and there is a hair in it! Immediately I spit it out, quietly, and drop it off to the floor so the rest of my party is not grossed out. But I am now very grossed out and dissapointed. \nI then call our server and tell her, quietly, in Turkish, that I got hair in my food. \nShe looks at me in disbelief, and instead of apologizing, grabs my plate and brings me a new one. I decide that I am not going to ruin my whole family's experience so I tell no one. \nAfter all the appetizers are finished and we move on to the entree, the same server comes back and asks how everything was. I tell her the food was good, and then she says, \"well I hope the good food made up for the bad start\".  I tell her \"yes\" and we continue to eat. \n\nWe order: \nappetizer plate\nsigara borek\nseveral plates of lamb, several plates of combination kebabs, \nManti\nTurkish wine, \nVarious deserts: Kunefe, baklava, helva, chocolate pyramid\nTurkish coffee and turkish tea.\n\nOur bill is $500 plus tip.\n\nSo here is my verdict: \n\n1) Although they had charged us 20% gratuity, they never told us so my husband ended up giving them an additional 20% tip on top \n\n2) Even though the food was great, the hair in my food at the very beginning was a big buzz kill. What was even more annoying was at no point did they attempt to apologize about it. She just kind of looked at me in disbelief. What I expected, instead, was for them to apologize and perhaps bring a desert as a gesture for apology. Generally, in such establishments, that is the right thing to do. Especially for a table this big, who just dropped almost $500 for food, the least you could do is take out a desert or two off the bill as a sweet gesture of apology. \n\nYes, the food was good and the ambiance was lovely. But I wish they had better courtesy.", "author": "Sarah S."}

My brief take of the ambiance inside was it's comfortable, not too dark or pretentious, nice pixel art work.\n\nBread - Four pieces of a soft flatbread with sesame.\n\nMucver - Three little patties of zucchini fritters. I thought they'd be more latke like consistency but they were pillowy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Cheese mixed into which were little pockets of flavor with each bite. Yum, these were my favorite part.\n\nChicken Kebab - Perfectly done kebab, the meat was was tender coated in a flavorful, slightly sour yogurt marinade, meat was juicy inside and not too dry. The grilled vegetables had a nice crunch and had just the right amount of slight charred from the grill. Tzatziki sauce was incredible as well. Portion size a little small (~5-6 chunks of meat). The chicken also came with a cucumber and carrot salad that was a little on the wet side but well seasoned.\n\nKofte - Four smallish patties of beef grilled. Flavorful and smoky but a little too dry for my taste. I added on a lot more tzatziki and to balance it out.\n\nThe food is really good, the kebabs are among the best I've had.

The waitress recommended the shank over the chops so shank it was. The portion size was huge. The lamb was tender and the sauce was fantastic. It wasn't too gamey which I was a fan of. My meal was good. My hubby ordered the beef/lamb kebab which I thought had pretty good flavor but again the high price tag on it makes you question it's value. Also I'm a little surprised it was a ground beef/lamb combo in the kebab as mediterranean food is heavy on the lamb. \n\nAmbience was nice. The chairs were comfy. I didn't feel cramped at the table. The service was interesting. Four of us got there first and about 2 minutes after we sat down the waitress was there trying to get our drink orders. We told her we needed a few minutes as we hadn't even looked at the menu yet and she went on to list the drink menu for us trying to get us to order - it was pushy.

We ordered a few things to share, the food was superb but well, we did not know that it was a modern Moroccan and I kept on holding out for a tagine dish that was never on the menu.\n\nWe made sure that we studied the menu on Yelp before coming here this time. It was Turkish and it is said to be authentic according to its description. Tracy A came here and wrote a nice review on Yelp. I tend to follow her around these days - perhaps our dining choices are starting to collide. \n\nG promptly guided me to another spot. He was way off. I should never trusted his sense of direction. We arrived 15 minutes later than expected but it was still early and they gladly took our call and said that the table was waiting for us. Nice!\n\nIncoming the free and tasty warm house made bread with three dipping sauces. The one thing I did not like Seattle eating scene is that they charge you for the bread, even those terrible ones that I won't even feed the pigeons with. I don't understand it. I like a place that makes yummy authentic Turkish bread and serve them with three kind of dipping sauces. All free of charge. And they did refill and the refill was a basket of warmer breads. Can I just eat that instead? \n\nOf course not. Ordered their signature cold meze which is called Cevizli Ezme. It's a big portion and very flavorful. Then for a hot meze we did \u0130\u00e7li K\u00f6fte. It's impossible to pronounce so of course it's deliciously foreign and exotic. Stayed away from the salad based off Tracy's review. Because our last North Africa + Californian expedition ended with lamb at Aziza, we decided to go with Sebzeli G\u00fcve\u00e7, which is stewed lamb cube served on a iron pan to continue our tradition.  Superb.\n\nG is an excellent runner. I often get my running tips from him. We also are friends and we took the opportunity to catch up: I updated him on the revolving door part of my life (because the rest of my life is insanely boring), and he debriefed me on his comings and goings. We concluded that I must lay off running until I'm all healed fro the annoying back injury. I sort of want to kick him because what am I if I'm not a runner any more? The meaning of life is contemplated over a cup of warm Turkish tea. \n\nDark no-running cloud hovering my heart. Just then, he said, when you get better, we should try that Egyptian place in Outer Richmond. \"Remember that place?\" Yes indeed. We ate dinner after running once by there. Perhaps the purpose of eating at this restaurant is a way to tell me that I will get better. I will run again.

In the grand scheme of things this is not a bad obsession to harbor.  \n\nTuba, a romantic, lightly lit, quiet Mission District restaurant is an imperfect response to my quest for the great meze platter or Mediterranean plate.  It's imperfection is mostly due to its prices, which sit a bit above what I consider \"well-priced\" though not hugely out of line for the ambiance provided. \n\nTuba's lovely \"Tuba Meze Taba \u011f\u0131\" (which the menu described as \"a taste of all cold mezes\", $25) was accompanied by fresh, warm Lebanese bread and made a perfect starter.  With some wine (Jade Mountain Cabernet, $9/glass), this appetizer, and a shared entree as an accompaniment, a party of two would be well satisfied.  Because we were a party of three, we added (in order of preference): \n\n* A tasty Adana Kebab \u200b($18); skewered spicy ground beef with lamb mixed with green and red bell peppers & special seasonings);\n\n*  A mild-flavored salad, the sumac-dusted Falafel Salatasi ($13; falafel stuffed with goat cheese, served with mix greens, cilantro, basil, red onions & and orange vinaigrette); and\n\n* a forgettable, tepid soup, Mercimek \u00c7orbas\u0131  ($8; red lentils, spicy pepper paste, tomato paste, onions, mint, garlic, cumin).\n\nTuba is not the answer to my quest but the food is good and the ambiance is special.  The Yelp Weekly recently featured \"Dining Out on a Third Date...Wink, Wink\" and it strikes me that Tuba would be a perfect addition to that list.  \n\nAdditional info:\n\n- Entrees are priced from $18 - $26.  A \"$5 off\" with Yelp check-in can help bring those prices down.   \n\n- Extensive wine list (including Lebanese wine and generous pours); corkage fee runs $15/bottle.\n \n- Reservations accepted but didn't appear necessary, especially on a weeknight.\n\n-  Street parking in this part of the Mission District was also easy on a weeknight.", "author": "Tracey A."}

Super friendly, and efficient, making sure all felt like family.\nWe wanted to sample a couple items, so started with their signature appetizer (Meze). Cevizli Ezme - Walnuts, Turkish red pepper paste, tomato paste, fresh garlic, olive oil, and cumin. Wow, this was excellent, and fresh, served with a home baked bread\nSecond, we had Peynirli Karides - Prawns saut\u00e9ed with tomatoes and garlic in pepperoncini sauce and topped with feta cheese. This dish surprisingly was rather boring for me. Not sure where the flavor went, given the ingredients.\nFinally I had the Musakka - eggplant stuffed with potatoes and zucchini, topped with bechamel sauce, this was served with rice and salad. I was again rather unimpressed with this dish as well. I had such high hopes I guess for such traditional Turkish dishes. I am sure we will return to try some other dishes.", "author": "Greg S."}

I am giving Tuba 5 stars based on the type of dishes/style, pricing and service, the balance between all three aspects. We were a group of 5, and ordered 4 main dishes to share, Adana kebab, lamb kebab, moussaka and beef with eggplant. For appetizer we had meze sampler. \n\nAll dips were excellent, and were flavorful and light. I am very familiar with Turkish food, so I will admit that the dips were all very authentic, with warm bread served it was heavenly.\n\nAll main courses were good as well, nice presentation. The danger of ordering lamb kebab is that it can be dry, but this one was perfectly cooked. This is not some intricate creative upscale cooking, but good solid Turkish food, prepared with love.\n\nMost of their wines are from Turkey. I didn't care for red wines (sampled one), but the white wine we had was excellent. \n\nWe also ordered kanafee for desert, and I must say, it was the best one I've had in a while (and the capital of best kanafee is Nablus, Palestine, and thought Tuba's was better). Perfect temperature, often it is too warm or too cold. \n\nService is outstanding. \n\nThe only recommendation is perhaps to play more subtle music, folk music, instead of loud Turkish pop.", "author": "Meerim I."}

We particularly loved the Cevizli Ezme, walnuts, red pepper and tomato paste with herbs made into the consistency similar to a tapenade and eaten with their fresh bread.  And basically all the mezes are gorgeous.  You could easily order just mezes and be completely stuffed.  I also recommend the Haydari, cucumbers, mint and dill, to accompany your richer dishes like H\u00fcnkar Be\u011fendi, pureed aubergine with leg of lamb.  The last time we dined here, we went with our veggie friends and decided to go vegetarian with them for the evening. This proved to be very easy as many of their dishes, especially the mezes are vegetarian.  Our friends said it was possibly some of the best food they've ever had.

They took a really long time to make the first check-in at our table, but once our server came around that first time, he was pretty accessible. I was a little sad to realize later than when he packed my Sarma Beyti leftovers, he barely included any of the sauce I'd carefully make sure to leave plenty of on my plate.\n\nTHE COST: About $100 total for a 3-course dinner for two. Yelp check-in gets you $5 off!\n\n* Free flatbread - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tuba-restaurant-san-francisco?select=zUeTTskaHaF-_I6B3vbrOw#w7tJAY4p7uYw83CnC-Q39w\nThis is one of the nicest complimentary dishes I've every received. The flatbread was fluffy with a good crisp. It was topped with sesame seeds and other tasty spices. And it came with three dips. This was great to have with the Ezme! \n\nCOLD MEZES\n* Cevizli Ezme (walnuts, turkish red pepper paste, tomato paste, fresh garlic, olive oil, cumin. $9) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tuba-restaurant-san-francisco?select=zUeTTskaHaF-_I6B3vbrOw#4RXKqseRAzOMqDdsmoHQ7g\nVery flavorful! I love the texture too. The dish was smaller than I thought, but it was more than enough to go with all our bread, plus we had leftovers. \n\nSIGNATURE ENTREES\n* Sarma Beyti Kebab (adana kebab wrapped in lavas bread, broiled, topped w/ homemade tomato & garlic yogurt sauce. $20) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tuba-restaurant-san-francisco?select=zUeTTskaHaF-_I6B3vbrOw#bE-KpN3-zG9ZRfeVPOrxrA\nVery very tasty. The lavas bread was soft and had a great consistency, but held together well. The kebab meat was dense and full of flavor. The sauces were fantastic. This came with a big slice of roasted green pepper (very spicy!) and tomato, which were a little out of place as you had to go out of your way to cut small pieces of both and mix it in with a bite of the sauce and the meat/bread.\n\n* Karniyarik (eggplant, stuffed w/ ground beef, tomatoes, onions, chopped parsley, then baked. rice & salad. $18) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tuba-restaurant-san-francisco?select=zUeTTskaHaF-_I6B3vbrOw#Ebl4uCw0CmeJya3CvqypAg\nThe ground beef mixture was really great! However, I wish the flavor had soaked more into the eggplant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-02", "description": "Is 'Tuba' a Turkish word? I typed it on Google Translate under Turkish, and the English translation came out, get this...'tuba'. Then I Googled it as 'Tuba Turkey' and found out it was either a scientific organization ousted by the current administration, the Turkish Academy of Sciences (T\u00dcBA), or the first name of a Turkish supermodel. Something tells me I've been over-thinking this one, but I will say I like finding good Turkish restaurants in the city. Alongside Machka in FiDi and Troya in the Inner Richmond, this one may be the best of the bunch.\n\nLocated next to the far trendier Beast & the Hare on Guerrero near 22nd, it's as dark as a sultan's private tent, but I guess it's all part of the exotic mood they are trying to evoke. Of course, a loudish work party of fifteen wasn't doing anything to enhance the mood. I was seated at what appeared to be part of their take-out table next to the register. I didn't mind since I was there on my own to try some of their food. First came the complimentary Homemade Grilled Turkish Bread with three little dishes - a whipped hummus, a couple of olives bathing in oil, and a crumble of feta cheese (see photo). It was nice and warm and probably too much for one person, but who's complaining?\n\nAs a starter, I decided on the $9 Tuba Salad, quite a large plate of freshness with chopped hearts of romaine, tomato and cucumber mixed with some Turkish touches - cranberries, pita-based croutons and a sprinkle of paprika (see photo). It was a bit like a Caesar in a whirling dervish. My entree was the priciest thing on the menu, the $23 Grilled Lamb Chops. I was feeling cocky since a Yelp deal popped up with my check-in which gave me $5 off my meal. It was a quartet of nicely charred lamb chops artfully arranged with a scoop of rice, a ramekin of yogurt sauce, and saut\u00e9ed vegetables - a seeded pepper, a grilled half-tomato and a pile of julienned carrots and mango (see photo).\n\nIt was deliciously savory, though as I always feel when I eat lamb chops, I found the quantity of meat a bit skimpy to the critical point where I need to decide whether I pick up the bone and gnaw. I was alone, so of course I did. And yes, I had dessert. Go ahead. Mock me. I've tried K\u00fcnefe at Machka and knew it would be too overwhelming, so I went with the very satisfying $5 S\u00fctla\u00e7, a small crock of oven-baked rice pudding with a layer of burnt milk skin on top (see photo). This was good stuff just like I remember when I visited Constantinople in days of yore...I mean Istanbul, not Constantinople.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...another great Turkish find in the city\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...dark and busy on the quieter side of the Mission\nSERVICE - 4 stars...definitely attentive, not too talkative\nTOTAL -4 stars...Turkish delights come in many forms", "author": "Ed U."}

We got the Sigara B\u00f6regi, which is fried fillo dough wrapped around potato and some other fillings. It looked like an egg roll. The palate came with 4 pieces and yummy garlic yogurt sauce, which was enough for two people as an appetizer. \n\nFor the entree, we shared the Tavuk Sis. The chicken was the perfect consistency, buttery, and melted in my mouth. The plate also came with garlic yogurt sauce in addition to a grilled pepper, bell peppers on the kebab stick, carrot slaw, rice, and some pickles. It's something where if you want to eat all the components separately you can or you can mix everything together which is the method I preferred. Our friends got the doner kebab and k\u00f6fte (beef patties). Although I didn't try it, they kept reiterating how delicious their food was. \n\nDidn't get to try the dessert this time because we were both full with our food and wine, however the menu looked good and we will try something next time.

Ordered lentil soup and lamb adana. They brought out the soup shortly afterwards with fresh bread and a set of cottage cheese, olives, and some type of good butter. Lentil soup was really really good as they say \"Best in Town\". After a bit, the main entree came out. The Lamb Adana was amazing, spicy, fresh, and long (giggity). The rice was a good amount, the pepper was a pepper, and the salad was whatever. \n\nAccording to Yelp a lot of people loved their desserts but again I had to wait 10 minutes or so for someone to ask if I wanted dessert. I got the chocolate pyramid and the chocolate creme brulee. Both were really good, and a perfect way to end dinner.

The dish is surrounded by a yogurt and was a good combination (much more tasty than a falafel as it was primarily meat and was very warm once you broke the ball. The eggplant entree we got is just eggplant paste. Don't expect an entire eggplant!. It had some lamb as well. Overall if you are looking for a lamb dish, I wouldnt' choose this one. It was primarily eggplant puree and some lamb. The dessert! We wanted baclava, but decided to try something new.

All of the staff in the dining area appeared to be genuinely Turkish people.We ordered wine from Turkey and surrounding countries. Elena had Pinot Noir and I had Pinot Grigio. Both glasses were excellent. I ordered a prawn dish as an appetizer. It was gourmet and top 1%. I was dazzled. Elena had lentil soup. She liked it and she is an expert on lentil soups. For the main course I had meat patties.They were superb. There was so much food that I couldn't eat it all. Elena had a vegetarian dish and took some of it home to reheat for lunch today at work. The bill came in at $100. This is not expensive for a San Francisco restaurant. We also saw some criticism of service. They stay full and busy so sometimes things take a little longer.

My brother and sister-in-law were in town from the East Coast, their first visit here, and I wanted to bring them to an interesting restaurant near my house. The reviews for this restaurant are quite strong, so I felt confident booking a reservation for us for 6:30 seating on a Wednesday night. The restaurant was pretty much empty when we arrived. The woman who was our waitress was a Slender Woman with curly dyed blonde hair and a very Stern expression. She did not greet us but asked us if we were ready to order. As it happened the fourth member of our party had not yet arrived. He was 5 minutes late. But she was insistent in standing over us waiting for us to order, so I rescued the moment by suggesting that we have some drinks and order appetizer. She did not say those words; I had to tell her that we could proceed that way. No sooner did the appetizer arrive, and we began sampling it, she came up again with a Stern demeanor, an impatient facial expression --- no welcoming, no warmth---really a cold person---and asked us to order our entrees now. I asked her are you in a hurry? And she looked at me with no change of expression very cold and said no, and then continued standing over us. So we interrupted our appetizer and figured out what we wanted to eat and took care of her needs. Not ours. Not our needs at any point in this meal. We were still finishing our food, and let the busboy know that we were not ready to have him clear. But he went ahead and started anyway. And I looked at him and said no! I had to raise my voice to get him to understand that we weren't finished, we still wanted to have our plates. So this was terrible really. I've never had such an aggravating embarrassing and really kind of humiliating experience in a restaurant before. It was made worse by the fact that I was trying to show my guests a good time, and we had the opposite of a good time.  Everybody agreed it was terrible, deliberately rude service.  The female server was by far by far the most offensive and quite calculated in doing it.   We are friendly,  polite people , and in no way deserved such cold, rude treatment.  The two stars are for good food, but it in no way compensates and I will never return to that restaurant under any circumstances that's how strongly I feel about the experience we had there. It was awful.", "author": "x v."}

This time we thought ahead and brought a friend. \n\nTuba has a $5 off check-in offer, but the waitress forgot to include it in the bill after she had me mark it as used. Maybe a free appetizer or drink would have been easier to remember?\n\nWe ordered an appetizer, but bread with herb butter and feta also came, which negated the appetizer. And at $12 for two meatballs (essentially) it felt overpriced. \n\nThe entrees were large (dumplings and kalides tava- saut\u00e9ed shrimp with rice and veggies) so we were stuffed. Yet we still shared the signature dessert. This probably isn't what the restaurant was going for, but it reminded me of a frosted mini-wheat as a dessert...if it were larger, baked and stuffed with honey. Don't get me wrong though, it was delicious!\n\nAfter the entrees came it felt like we got less and less attention-- still the minimum, but forgetful (like a longer wait for water and dessert, and the check-in offer not being reflected in the bill). \n\nThe food was filling and flavorful, but on the pricey side compared with the service, which was good before it got crowded.

Well, I'm glad to say I was wrong - Tuba is fantastic. We had the meze taba\u011f\u0131 (appetizer sampler plate), which is well worth the $25 and is a great starter for 3-4 people. Everything on it tasted authentic, from the patl\u0131can ezmesi (roasted eggplant) to the red pepper paste and the cac\u0131k (garlic-mint yogurt.) The bread was nicely toasted and came with olives and turkish cheese.\n\nIt's also really in the details, like the fact that there is kekik and sumac (two common turkish spices) mixed with salt dashed on top of certain dishes and on the corners of the plates.\n\nKarn\u0131yar\u0131k (roasted eggplant stuffed with meat, tomatoes, and spices) is by far my favorite dish in turkish cuisine, and Tuba's is excellent. Hot, very savory, and very filling. They did not skimp on the portion size as I find some restaurants do with this dish.\n\nFor dessert, we had the irmik helvas\u0131, a semolina-based dish over ice cream. It was really great. If you haven't had k\u00fcnefe, and have room in your stomach for a slightly heavier dessert, I would try that instead / as well.\n\nThe only thing that didn't quite live up to expectations was the sarma beyti kebap. While the meat was (as in the karn\u0131yar\u0131k) delicious, the tomato sauce was a little too sweet and tasted like it had a tomato paste base instead of a fresh tomato base. However, this one small thing wasn't enough to make me consider giving anything less than a 5 star review.\n\nThe service was also excellent. If you know even a little turkish, be sure to try it out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-13", "description": "Usually a few months after an international trip I'll locate a restaurant here at home that serves the cuisine of the region visited and reminisce through food. Istanbul was the destination in January, and I have lovely memories of the city's abundant food. On Istanbul's Asian shore there were terrific fish markets, with typically a small cafe in back popular at lunch time where one can eat well and cheaply. This experience prompted me to select the sea bream, one of two specials offered us at the outset of a recent dinner at Tuba, not necessarily expecting a mirror recreation of what was made available in Turkey but curious nonetheless what the local chefs might make of the dish. My girlfriend ordered the karniyarik eggplant off of the menu. \n\nAs the food began to arrive the server asked if we intended to share our dishes, which is certainly feasible given the ample portions delivered and perhaps is the answer to one of the few repeated complaints on Yelp (the price per entree, that is). I think the entrees are meant to be shared. If/when we return to Tuba we have decided we will order one entree and augment this with mezzes. I think this will work very well. My sea bream was tasty but I'll likely choose something different next time. Ayran appeared on the drink menu, which thrilled me because we had tried the salted yogurt drink while on holiday and liked it a lot. I had to order it at Tuba, and it tasted very similar, just as refreshing paired with the food. \n\nWe had actually made a reservation for early in the evening, then canceled because we weren't ready to eat yet and ended up going later just ahead of the dinner rush. We had a pokey little table pushed against the wall near the wait station that I was prepared not to enjoy but that turned out fine. The high-backed, cushioned chairs were extremely comfortable and ticked up the enjoyment scale. There appear to be a lot of people on hand to wait on the hungry at this establishment, translating to warm and convivial attention. We got to blab about our visit to Istanbul to a young woman who wasn't even our server but that had approached us anyway. The maitre d'hotel complimented me on the scarf I was wearing, and later held the door open for us to exit. I remember a similar warmth and hospitality extended to us in Istanbul, so experiencing it here was a sort of special confirmation of something that I won't preach about on Yelp. \n\nWhat a nice experience, though.", "author": "Brian G."}

I hate when dolmas are served so cold you know they were just pulled from a fridge. These had a delicate texture, flavor and came at the right temperature. They were also served with a small green salad.\n\nThe Bread plate: which they give everyone is really nice. I love the spreads that came with it.\n\nLentil Soup: It seemed to me in Turkey every restaurant had just amazing amazing soup. This red lentil is a great representation of that. It had a nice amount of pepper in it that I appreciated and I felt it unnecessary to add a squeeze of lemon (which came with it). \n\nFalafel Salad: The falafels were a little to firm for my preference but they were delicious just the same. The salad was an excellently priced and healthy option your vegetarian friends and friends on diets will appreciate. \n\nStuffed eggplant: My friend doesn't like bell peppers so she picked them out of it but she enjoyed the dish. (We went to Tuba because she was missing a Turkish friend's home cooking). \n\nRice Pudding: I thought it would be served hot because of the description. It was served cold and was really good.\n\nKunefe: is a sweet cheese wrapped in shredded filo dough, baked, drizzled with syrup and sprinkled with pistachios. I'd never had this dessert before but I would tell anyone going to Tuba to order it. \n\nTurkish coffee: They asked how sweet I wanted it. I told them to serve it how they would in turkey and they gave it to me \"only a little sweet\" because I was having it with dessert. I'd seriously go back just for this. The presentation is very cool as well.\n\nService: very attentive and friendly without being too in your face. \n\nSo as you can see the two of us had quite a sampling of the food.

There are a few stand-outs like Kokkari for Greek food, but other than that I've been left wanting.\n\nAuthenticity is the first word that comes to mind when I think about Tuba. While there are certainly a number of blanket \"Mediterranean\" dishes on the menu, there are other things that I'm not sure you could find elsewhere -- the Kofte Kebab is not the kind you might get at a Pakistani place -- not mild, but complex in flavor and not overpowering. Their lamb was expertly cooked -- not tough, not too gamey -- and we were very pleased away by the solid wine list including a good number of imports and locals.\n\nI think the portion sizes were more than adequate -- my partner and I both walked away feeling full and satisfied. That said, the shrimp dish we got was a little overdone, and it did feel like something they just grabbed from Greece or Eastern Italy.\n\nOur service was quick and attentive, but no-nonsense either, which is fine by me, but a turn-off to some. That said, the menu (with the exception of the desserts which were mostly philo-based)  is *extremely* gluten-free friendly, which is wonderful for me...

I have already heared of Tuba, but wasn't sure it was worth the trip, eating Turkish food outside the Middle East is hardly ever a mind blowing experience! \n\nUpon a closer look, we quickly realised this wasn't your average kebab spot. It was beautiful and effortlessly exotic. I was looking quite shabby minus chic having been out all day backpack, tights and trainers. The lady at the door caught us as we were about to walk away, she said I look fine sit down and enjoy your time. Everyone was dressed up nicely though, just so you would know! \n\nThey are mainly indoors but they have about 3-4 tables sitting 2-4 people outside on the street. The street itself is quite and suburby looking so it was very pleasent. \n\nThe food is incredible!!!! They seem to use different spices and herbs, so don't expect it to taste familiar. We ordered: \n\nHummus for starters (delicious) comes with their complimentary bread ( also white cheese crumbles, olives and a butter spread).\n\nAdena kebab, a large minced meat skewer (spicy) sereved with rice (I would come back for the rice alone) and salad. \n\nEggplants and  mozzarella mash topped with a red beef stew (Amazing). \n\nFinally Kunefe and tea. We had no room for this at all but it had to be done judging by how great the meal was. My +1 the kunefe expert says it is one of the top in the world. Too sweet for some but the tea cuts through it well if unsweetened. You could maybe ask for the syrup on the side too. The kunefe comes with mildly chewy vanilla ice cream. \n\nI am declaring my love for this place right now! A beautiful place, brilliant ( and I don't say this often) warm service and just great food that makes you really happy.", "author": "Nora B."}

The ones that I enjoyed were the grilled eggplant puree (Pathcan salatasi grilled), Piyaz (white bean salad), and Ezme (a tomato paste with walnuts).  \n\nMy entree was the mixed grill. Served with chicken and lamb shish, kotfe, adana, and lamb chop, it was a lot of meat.  I substituted my rice for more saut\u00e9ed vegetables, which was a good choice.

There were only two tables until 6pm, so service was super attentive, but judging the staff it seemed like it would be like that anyway. \n\nFood was so tasty, actually using spices and herbs rather than dumping it with too much salt.  None of it was spicy, just super flavorful.  We did the app that let you try all the cold appetizers, and shared all the dinners-keftka, kebabs (lamb and chicken), dumplings that looked like someone pinched them with the tiniest fingers ever, and  salmon w/ yogurt sauce, And for dessert it would've been easier to tell them which ones we didn't want since we ended up ordering all but two items.  Rice pudding and their house specialty (listed as such-name escapes me) were table favs.  \n\nSo nice to try something outside of our normal routine of sushi, Italian, and burgers and pizza (thanks to kids!). \n\nHighly recommended!", "author": "Susie M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-09", "description": "Authentic Turkish Cuisine is served here in an elegant ambiance. Ezme, Manti and irmik helvasi dessert are traditional fare that many places don't offer and those three things were some of the most memorable and tasty eats I had while visiting Turkey. I know everyone thinks kabobs when they think Turkish food but there is so much more to the cuisine than meat on a stick. \n\nThe Ezme was something I had from a street vendor in Istanbul. This was the cart that the locals lined up for. The Ezme paste of crushed walnuts, tomatoes and spices were slathered in a lavash style piece of bread and then whole leaves of romaine lettuce were placed on top and rolled up to be easy to eat as you roamed around the city. At Tuba they present it a bit more elegantly with the paste prettily plopped on a plate and the bread broken into pita chip like pieces to scoop it up with. \n\nThe Manti is similar to beef ravioli but the sauce that tops it is a yogurt/tomato sauce. This is good stuff. The creamy , tangy yogurt sauce is incredibly addicting. It's also pretty to look at with the contrast of white and red swirled together and not completely mixed. \n\nThe irmik helvasi is a semolina flour desert that I stopped a passing boy in the Grand Bazaar to try. In Turkey, the ice cream was encased in the flour mixture but here it's served on the side. The slightly gritty texture of the moist semolina tastes heavenly with the cold smooth accompaniment of ice cream. \n\nTuba restaurant is a great find for authentic Turkish delights here in the states. Now if they served Salep(a warm horchata like drink made from the tubers of an orchid), and Dondurma(sticky ice cream) I'd be in Turkish foodie heaven but alas, the special orchid flour that is the main ingredients of those two things are a rarity outside of Turkey.", "author": "Oulie T."}

I had enough time to squeal out, 'There it is!' before we hit the end of the block. Hubby dropped me off, as we were running a tad bit late. Successfully securing our table, I perused the menu and knew we were gonna have to make some tough decisions.  We settled on: \n\n* The Hot Platter - the sampler platter of their hot appetizers. Loved the falafels and deep fried cheese (who wouldn't?!) \n* H\u00fcnkar Beendi, which is pureed eggplant with mozzarella cheese topped with lamb cubes. You'd never know it was eggplant; the texture was silky smooth.  Paired wonderfully with the tender lamb cubes.  Mmm.. I almost couldn't share it.. \n* Chicken dish that had tomato sauce and onions & peppers.  \n* K\u00fcnefe - One of my absolute favorite desserts.  We order it at almost every Greek festival we go to.  It's layers of shredded fillo dough filled with sweet cheese, baked to perfection and served with homemade syrup and pistachio nuts.

We came for a friends birthday party and I had no idea what type of food we were getting. The place is small and long. It's unfortunately really loud too, even without a ton of people in it. \n\nThe ordered the Shepherd salad, which wasn't at all what I was expecting. I was expecting some lettuce with my veggies, but I misunderstood the concept of a Greek salad I guess. It was pretty good but I had cucumber burps for a few hours afterwards.

Not telling me where we were going, I had no idea what sort of food we were getting...but hey! Tuba was definitely a pleasant experience!\n\nHe made reservations at 6pm. We arrived late due to traffic and walked in at 6:15pm. Parking wasn't bad, but you definitely have to look.\n\nThe restaurant only had 2 other tables when we sat down. This place is very quaint. Dim lightening, colorful decor, and a special scent within the restaurant. It was relaxing, yet very classy. We were than greeted by a waitress that handed us the menu and poured us glasses of water. Being the very first time of having Turkish cuisine for both of us...we needed some time to digest the menu. \n\nMomentarily, this gentlemen came over and asked if it was our first time. We later on figured out his name was Burke. He gave us recommendations and was very personable. As my boyfriend butcher the names of the dishes, Burke was so nice to tell us that it is pronounced the way it looks. We decided to go with:\n\nAppetizer: Cevizli Ezme Walnuts, Turkish red pepper paste, and tomato paste with fresh garlic, olive oil, and cumin. SO GOOD! The bread was fresh and delicious. The red pepper paste really caught Mr.MC's attention. It complimented the bread very well. It was tasty.\n\nFor entrees, we went ahead and ordered two to share:\nSarma Beyti Kebab\u0131 -  Adana kebab wrapped in lava\u015f bread, topped with homemade\ntomato and garlic yogurt sauce. VERY saucy. If you are not someone that likes too much sauce, you might not like this dish. However, this dish was very flavorful. The garlic yogurt sauce was just right. It wasn't sour or anything. It was a generous portion.\n\nMant\u0131 - Dumplings stuffed with ground beef, topped with garlic yogurt sauce,\npepper flakes and dried mint. The dumpling were tiny! They were bite-sized! But the meat within was very fresh. The ground beef was a tad bit dry, however, it didn't both us because it paired well with the the sauce as well. \n\nBread and water were refilled without request. We were able to eat the bread with the yogurt sauce as well!\n\nAt the end, we were stuffed but we HAD to order Pyramid Noisette Chocolate to satisfy my sweet cravings and 2 orders of the Turkish coffee. I am a coffee lover and I approve! Turns out Turkish coffee isn't in a cup or glass, it actually comes in a super tiny small mug shot. Very strong.\n\nBurke was very helpful and personable throughout our whole dining experience. He definitely made our first Turkish cuisine an awesome one!

Mine tastes like mud compared to theirs- holy cow, it was so delish I could have taken the whole tray and just had that with bread for dinner.\n\nWasn't a fan of their crushed walnuts dish; ezme but if you love nuts and tomatoe paste, you may be more keen to it than myself.  Enjoyed the refreshing shepard salad with abundant cucumber and the icli kofte had a wonderful thick and crispy bulgar shell encasing a spicy ground sirloin.  That was much smaller than I expected, as the icli kofte was basically two small oval, the length of an index finer and a couple fingers thick.  The salad on the other hand was much bigger and probably would have been too much for just two people if they didn't cucumber.  \n\nTheir kabab was delicious and had so much flavor.  Also big portion!  Ours was a bit dry but I think it's because we took so long eating everything else they had to keep it waiting for us.  \n\nPyramid Noisette Chocolate with hazelnut mousse and chocolate mousse sounds like something I would love, but it fell short.  It didn't taste like it was made with quality and care as I would have wanted it to.

In my opinion it's the best Turkish restaurant in the Bay Area.\n\nOn my last visit we had the icli kofte appetizer which is ground beef mixed with walnuts, rolled into a ball, covered in breading, fried, then served on a bed of yogurt. How can you go wrong. Other menu standouts I've tried include beyti kebap (kebap wrapped in lavash bread and topped with tomato and yogurt sauce), manti (meat dumplings served in yogurt sauce--I guess I really like my dairy) and Adana kebap. The Adana kebap is different then those I've had elsewhere (and from what I'm told more authentic). The meat had a softer texture and was a lot spicier, so keep that in mind. I find most Turkish food pretty heavy so by the time I'm done with an entree I feel like I'm going to die and therefore too full for dessert. If you don't have that problem I'd suggest the kunefe and or irmik helvasi.\n\nThey have a nice selection of Turkish beers (gotta love Efes Dark) and wines. I had the red Kavakl\u0131dere which was like a pinot noir and very good.\n\nService is friendly, but that may be because I always come with native Turkish speakers.

The only downside about the restaurant was the Chocolate cup creme brulee. We ordered three of them-- two of them were frozen on the inside, and one was soft and melting. We assumed there was something wrong with the melting creme brulee and complained to the waitress.

The service and the food was nothing special and I will not be coming back. \n\nLet's start with the service. As soon as my friend and I entered, we got a bad taste in our mouth. I made open table reservations for 5 people and at the last minute, another friend of mine decided to join. I forgot to update the open table reservation, but didn't think it would have been that big of a deal. When I mentioned that there will be one more person joining us, the man who greeted us did not look happy. He was snappy with me and told me that they have a table for 5 already set up with us but he \"guesses\" that he can sit us at a larger table. Sorry, I didn't realize adding an additional person was going to be that big of a deal... I'll go on --- when our waitress asked my friend if he would like a recommendation of their Turkish wine, she recommended the most expensive glass of wine on the list. It's not as though my friend had a problem paying for it, it was more principle and a bit shady. Our water glasses were never refilled unless we asked. Also, I noticed that the same man that greeted us, rolled his eyes at one point when he walked by our table for no reason at all. I understand that our party may have been louder than the rest of the parties (we like to laugh and talk and not just stuff our mouths - sorry), but we do not deserve to have somebody who works there roll their eyes at us. In fact, I believe that man is either the owner or the Manager. \n\nAs for food... nothing special. Their hummus was probably the only decent item from everything else we had ordered. The only annoying thing that happened (and never happens at other restaurants) is that my friend has an allergy for gluten and asked for cucumbers instead of their bread for the hummus. Although they were able to accommodate her, they charged her extra for 8 slices of cucumbers. Again, it's not about the money, it's the principle. For my main dish, I had their shrimp. The shrimp tasted extremely bland and they had no Turkish feel to them whatsoever. It came with plain rice and some veggies. I could have made it at home and saved my money. The rest of my party were also not thrilled with the food. \n\nAll in all, I don't recommend this place.

All for these were delicious. The moussaka, karniyarik (stuffed eggplant), and manti (small meat-stuffed dumplings with yogurt sauce and spices) were all delicious! There's a wine list with a variety of Turkish, European, and California wines, but we found we got something better when we asked what they had that was NOT on the list. This place is definitely worth a try if you already like, or would like to try, Turkish food.", "author": "David K."}

I was pleasantly surprised that, instead of being a zoo like some Mission restaurants, it was quiet and mellow. It felt like we had found a fantastic secret!\n\nGreat food! All things you'd expect from a Mediterranean spot - there were these zucchini fritter items that were positively divine, and the flatbread that came before our meal was irresistible! We took our server's advice and tried a Turkish wine. It was quite good - maybe not what I want every day but a really nice pairing for the food. Nice to try something new. I had lamb on a bed of eggplant melted with mozzarella (don't ask me the official name). The eggplant shocked me - it was so unctuous and creamy. My Mom's dish also used eggplant as a base. I honestly have never seen the ingredient used so artfully before. Well priced for quality food in SF. \n\nThe service was superb. Everyone who helped us was kind and, always a good sign, actually Turkish. The owner started chatting with my Dad and told us he and his wife had recently taken over the restaurant, maybe 2 months ago, although they had helped found it and have been involved since it opened.

Our server and the entire staff was incredibly friendly. Her suggestions for Turkish wines were great and we enjoyed the 3 varieties that we tried. \n\nThe food was great! We started off with the Mucver, which is pan fried zucchini patties with fresh dill. We then ordered 2 entries, the Beyti and the Adana Kebab. The Beyti (adana wrapped in lavash bread served with tomato sauce and yogurt) is somewhat like a pasta dish and was super rich!! The Adana Kebab (spicy ground sirloin and lamb) was perfectly prepared and paired with grilled vegetable and rice. Both entries left us very satisfied.\n\nAs we ordered Turkish coffee we noticed a familiar face. As it turned out it was the owner, who we knew from Park Gyro (@ 9th and Irving). He stopped and talked to us for awhile and let us know about how he took the place over and how basically everyone who worked their was Turkish and that the chef recently arrived from Turkey. He ordered us a dessert on the house and thanked us for our patronage. The dessert, which was the K\u00fcnefe (two layers of kadayif  filled with sweet cheese, baked to perfection and served with homemade syrup and pistachio nuts) was a great end to an awesome meal.\n\nOverall our entire experience was great and memorable and we will definitely be back again!", "author": "Dean B."}

The bread that comes with it was not your standard pita halves.  It was clearly made on site and was more delicate and flavorful than standard pita.  We also ordered the cold meza,  Turk Salatasi, a health salad, which is a mixture of cucumbers, tomatoes and onion with lemon juice and a bit of Olive Oil.  I thought the splash of lettuce greens was a nice touch.  Finally, we ordered the signature dish H\u00fcnkar Be\u011fendi, which is pureed eggplant with mozzarella cheese and chunks of lamb floated on top.  Since it was eggplant, I was expecting something along the lines of a baba ganoush but it was far better.  The flavor was more complex but subtle.

One word of caution is if you don't like hot or spices in your food than this isn't the place for you.\n\nAs for dessert, I'd recommend the kannefe with unsweetened turkish coffee...though I thought the coffee was on the milder side.

We had the lamb shank which we both loved, the walnut red pepper spread which we also loved & several other dishes.  A nice extra was that they gave us a free desert and a gift certificate for $20 off for each of our birthdays.  The owner also stopped at our table  to help us select dishes.  We went back for my birthday on a Monday night & were both disappointed.  We learned that they only have lamb shank on the weekends so we got the seafood special.  It was good, but not as good as the lamb shank. We also got the filo appetizer with a potato filling, which was greasy.   And we got the walnut red pepper spread again but it just tasted hot with almost no walnuts.  We returned it & got a salad instead which was not bad. But the waiter didn't tell us that both the filo appetizer & the entree came with salad so we had a huge amount of salad left over.  They also didn't give us a free dessert or a gift certificate.  Very disappointing.", "author": "Joanne C."}

All staff members were more than willing to describe the menu and help us decide what to order.\n\nFor appetizers we tried the: \n1) Ezme - crushed walnuts, pepper paste, tomato paste, garlic, cumin \n2) Crispy Falafels - drizzled with tahini sauce\n3) M\u00fccver - pan fried zucchini patties with fresh dill  \n\nFor our entrees we had:\n1) Adana Kebab spicy ground sirloin and lamb\n2) K\u00f6fte Kebab ground beef and lamb, fresh herbs\n3) Manti (some kind of meat dumpling)\n\nFor the appetizers, we all liked the falafels but none of us enjoyed the Ezme. The fact that it was a cold appetizer didn't help either. I didn't try the Mucver, but my boyfriend said he wasn't a fan. Our friends seemed to enjoy it though.\n\nFor our entrees. I had the Adana Kebab while my boyfriend had the Kofte Kebab. Both were alright but we have had better. The meat was well cooked and everything but I just didn't get nearly as much flavor out of it as I wanted to. My boyfriend felt the same with his Kofte Kebab. \n\nOur friends had the Kofte Kebab and the Manti.  I tried the Manti and it was good but I wasn't crazy about it. This dish was one of the restaurant's specialties. \n\nOverall I think the ambiance and service is good, but the food is lacking. I can tell they have put a lot of effort into their food and while the quality is great, the flavor is just not enough. The pricing was fair.

Very nice dish. I had the Karides Tava, which is shrimp saut\u00e9ed with wine, garlic asparagus, olive oil, and lemon juice, and was lovely. Very light, very flavorful. My husband had the Sarma Beyti Kebab\u0131 -- Adana kebab wrapped in lava\u015f bread and topped with tomato and garlic yogurt sauce -- also wonderful and flavorful. And we capped the meal with their signature dessert: K\u00fcnefe layers of kaday\u0131f (shredded fillo dough) filled with sweet cheese, served with homemade syrup and pistachio nuts. You can have it with ice cream, we opted to leave it plain. It was delicious as was the Turkish coffee - I asked for it not to be too strong and medium sweet and it was PERFECT.\n\nIt's a wee bit crowded, the tables somewhat closer than I like, but the atmosphere overall was very nice and relaxed. Our only quibble was the service was...strange. A waitress appeared almost immediately after we were seated to tell us the specials and then asked to take our order - being new to the restaurant, we needed more time to look over the menu, but she never came back. The owner/manager came over, asked if we wanted wine - we didn't - and then hovered a moment, so we figured he wanted to take our order, so we gave him our appetizer order and he said, \"I will let them know\" and left without taking our entree order. The appetizer arrived very quickly, but no one came back to take our entree order even though we still had the menus on our table. We were busy eating the appetizer and almost done with it by the time I realized our entree order hadn't been taken, so I told said something when our water was refilled and we finally made our order. The dishes arrived pretty quickly, so it wasn't like we were waiting forever for our food, but it was still strange. And the couple who was dining next to us had to ask repeatedly for a sharper knife to cut the lamb he had for an entre - the butter knife just wasn't doing the job even though the lamb was tender. \n\nSo....great food...the service was strange for us, but not to the point that we wouldn't go back there again since we got our food in good time and it was all delicious (which is why we go to restaurants in the first place).", "author": "Venice G."}

Good Turkish food makes me homesick for my home away from home.  And Tuba Restaurant, because of its owner/chef Ali Yaldiz, is a place to go for real home cooked Turkish food with a twist.  Ali is Kurdish, as are many of the best Turkish cooks in Turkey, and since he originally hails from the SE of the country, his specialties represent some of the oldest foods in all of Anatolia.\n\nAli has recently added a new addition to his comprehensive menu, PIDE, a delicious baked item that is a favorite with Turks, Kurds and visitors alike. \n\nPIDE begin as hand made dough, rolled thin, filled with an assortment of fine dry cured meats, special cheese varieties, vegetables and spices, crimped along its edges by hand, baked to perfection until just crisp around the edges but tender underneath, and served piping hot.\n\nPIDE is the quintessential Turkish menu item that is served at small cafes, large hotels and in famous restaurants throughout the whole of Turkey, along the Aegean, Mediterranean and Black sea coasts as well in large cities and small villages all over the interior.\n\nPIDE at Ali's Tuba Restaurant is as good as PIDE gets.  He uses the finest ingredients, as he does with all of his menu items, and prepares what may be the best PIDE that I have ever had in all of my years of experience with Turkish food here and in Turkey.\n\nIt is no wonder why PIDE is such a favorite of Turks young and old, because when it is done right, nothing is so sublime.  Ali and Tuba Restaurant really offer guests a chance to enjoy this secret specialty without the travel and without the jet lag.  PIDE at TUBA -- It doesn't get any better!

I adore the mezes, the salads, the kabobs. I've had great Turkish food at many restaurants, in many cities (though never actually in Turkey).\n\nTuba was ... just fine. \n\nMy husband had an interesting and unusual dish that was basically pureed eggplant with cubes of lamb on top. That was the only dish that stood out - the rest was fairly lacking in flavor or anything to distinguish them. \n\nI ordered the stuffed eggplant, which seemed to be stuffed with the same frozen peas, carrots, and corn medley that I buy at Trader Joe's. We started with the cold appetizer sampler which, again, with few exceptions, tasted like it could have been assembled from the TJ's dip counter. The humus was a big disappointment and just tasted like a can of chickpeas had been pureed with some garlic.\n\nThe good stuff: the restaurant has a great, cozy, romantic atmosphere. The waitstaff is friendly and attentive. That eggplant/lamb dish was yummy. I would go back to sample the kabobs (which many other yelpers rave about), but with so many other fantastic Turkish/Middle Eastern restaurants in SF (A La Turca, Troya, Fattoush) I'm in no hurry.", "author": "sarah b."}

I happily traveled my way through this country several times, meals scattered between hair raising taxi rides, stimulating public bus transportation and nonstop encounters with friendly, inquisitive Turks eager to feed me. This comfortable restaurant is fine, but for its price it fails to introduce its guests to the best addictive and unique culinary experience that Turkey offers. We sampled the meza so we could sample all of the cold appetizers. The Hummous and grape leaves were no better than those available elsewhere.  However, the Cevizli and Kizartma (eggplant) were delicious. In a traditional Turkish neighborhood place, you would be invited into the kitchen to view and sample. The special of the evening was leg of lamb; two of us ordered it. Others ordered the Mussakka, saut\u00e9ed shrimp and stuffed eggplant.  The lamb special came was well received (I didn't sample it). The saut\u00e9ed shrimp , Mussakka and stuffed eggplant were also good, but doesnt the price demand something special?  Mussakka is a standard option in many Turkish and Greek restaurants, and this one was tasty, but again, was it distinguishable from the same dish served at other places?  The stuffed eggplant is also a classic dish which was well prepared.  My guests enjoyed the saut\u00e9ed shrimp, but we wondered if it was a Turkish dish: not sure. The tab (including 2 glasses of wine and 2 turkish coffees) came to around $270 not including tip. I would recommend Tuba for those who want nicely prepared Turkish food in a comfortable setting, but after 3 trips here, I feel it falls short for its price. While not as comfortable, the offerings at Gyro King (especially the lunch specials) and Ala Turca are just as satisfying at a third the cost.  The truth is, I have yet to discover a Turkish restaurant that can match almost any Turkish truckstop wher you can sample an astonishing array of unique dishes not found here.  And where is the casual, family friendly Turkish neighborhood place that enthusiastically invites you into their kitchen, that asks you to smell and taste from their trays of colorful dishes?\n\n\n\n\n\nx", "author": "Mark T."}

That said, I have a lot of data to draw on for you! \n\nAlthough this place is technically Turkish, the food is very similar to Greek and other Middle Eastern food.....in case you were wondering. However, here it is hands-down much better than most places I've been....and I have been a food-obsessed/gardener/cook/eat-out-a-lot person for the 20 years of my adult life. There is just something about the quality of the food and the way it is lovingly prepared at this place.\n\nThis is my first five star review for a reason - it's consistently very high quality, the portions are huge, the service is really good and often the chef will come out and check to see how you are doing. The ambiance is pretty nice too, although the only knock I can possibly think to give it is that sometimes it gets a little too packed with people and then it gets too hot because the kitchen is going full steam...but they will open the front door if no one objects.\n\nOK, let's start with the service: very attractive and sweet female servers (I believe they are all Turkish too), super helpful at picking out wine from their extensive list, I have also seen then handle a couple of difficult situations with grace and leaving the customer feeling good.\n\nThe food: did I mention HUGE portions? You can easily get full on the appetizers and amazing bread, but be careful not to because you really want to leave room for the rest of it. The lamb is always cooked to perfection, the shrimp is succulent and good in every dish it is in - but especially the Pistachio Crusted Prawn Salad, their falafel is not too dry and full of flavor, I loved their zucchini appetizer and the lentil soup....I even tried their eggplant dish with my friend who is veggie and liked that (and I don't usually care for eggplant unless the flavor is completely masked.)\n\nWhen should you try this place? Any time you have people in your party who are vegetarian, vegan, picky or indecisive - I've been here with all of these types and everyone has left happy and full. Also, just come here for a date or when you want one meal to last you for three in leftovers. I've been here going on 10 times in the past year. Enough said.", "author": "Rachel K."}

Though the cuisines are similar, I had never had Turkish, so my cousin suggested that we meet here. It's located on busy Guerrero St., and visiblly close to the corner of 22nd St. \n\nI found a parking spot on the next block. What I love about SF - are little pockets of businesses/restaurants at intersections such as this one - a little urban oasis nestled in between The Mission and Noe Valley.\n\nI walked into a really cozy, yet modern space, with no more than a dozen to a dozen and a half tables, maybe. The walls were colored a deep, warm red; the tables and chairs were made of dark wood; the really chic lighting and pops of colorful art really made the aesthetics inviting and comfortable. \n\nThe server came by to take our drink order, and was taken aback, and perhaps offended that I wanted a Turkish coffee before dinner. She said that it wasn't too great for digestion...yet she doesn't realize that I've had it before, and drink coffee as easily as I drink water! I still asked for it.\n\nThere was flat bread on the table, and it wasn't pre-packaged, or dry, compared to anywhere else that I've had it. It had a really great texture, yet was soft, and moist, like homemade American bread.\n\nMy companions had ordered the hummus (which came with more flat bread), and it was super creamy, smooth, and the BEST that I have ever tasted. You could tell from the texture of it that it was \"super homemade.\" ...and I now realize that most places probably have it pre-packaged.  It also wasn't oily and didn't have the puddle on the top like you find at other restaurants\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Adana Shish -\nSpicy ground sirloin and lamb at $15. \n\nI tried to order it extra spicy, but understandably, they couldn't do it because the meat was pre-mixed/pre-prepped with the spice.\n \nShockingly, my entree arrived before I had a chance to finish my Turkish coffee! I'd say it was less than 15 minutes to wait for my food - which was cooked to order, and nice and hot.\n\nThe shish was really super moist. It came with a grilled tomato, a grilled chile pepper, a large (but not overkill) serving of rice, onions, dill yogurt sauce, and of course, the shish kebab at maybe a foot long. \n\nNote that the beef/lamb meat combo is usually a really good flavor combination because you don't get that overpowering taste from the ground lamb, yet, you also get the natural beef fat from the ground sirloin to juice-it-up. \n\nSince I asked for extra spice, they served me up with a helping of hot sauce! All-in-all, it was enough food to keep you full in the stomach, yet not so much that it sends you over the edge with a to-go box to boot!\n\nFor dessert, I ordered Baklava $6), which I NEVER pass up. The layers of filo were thin and flaky, which was good, and had some honey in it. This was definitely one of the best I have ever tasted, and not dry like I've had at most places.\n\nTo summarize, I would have given this place five stars if it weren't for the mediocre service. Not to the fault of anything or anyone, with the exception of circumstance, there was a slight language barrier with the server. Note that this is NOT a criticism. It's merely a trivial thing yet at the same time, a large enough interaction for me to remember it.", "author": "Jimmy L."}

The restaurant space is small, and was crowded when we arrived.  There is no dedicated waiting area, so the majority of diners waiting for a table have to huddle awkwardly by the door, or lurk next to someone's table. \n\nSERVICE: Friendly, apologetic... but... not the greatest.  For one thing, we arrived a few min early (5) for our 8:30PM reservation, only to be told by the owner (? An older gentleman) that he was so sorry, but we would have to wait a few minutes, on account of our early arrival.  Ok, NBD, we stand outside the doorway like awkward creepers and check out their menu.  We ended up waiting for over 15min before I requested to be seated outdoors.  They quickly set up the table, and we ordered pretty much immediately upon sitting down.  It took them another 15min to bring us water, which they never refilled.\n\nFOOD: The food arrived lukewarm to cold at our table... which was quite unappetizing.\n- Falafel ($7): Very loosely packed falafels (4) with a small mound of hummus.  This app came out nice and hot, and was fairly satisfying.  I prefer a denser falafel but the flavor of these were good.\n- Mercimek Corbasi (bowl $7): Red lentil soup in a bowl was a decent sized portion, but did not come out quite as hot as I would've liked.  It had a pretty sour edge (the addition of the accompanying lemon wedge was a bit overkill)... the versions of lentil soup I had while in Turkey were never this sour, and were way more savory.  This was mediocre at best.\n- Sebzeli Guvec ($18): A lamb cube casserole with assorted veggies (zucchini, bell peppers, onion).  The lamb was really gamey, but the worst offense was that this dish was COLD.  J said his half was fine, but practically every bit I ate was ice cold in the center.  So unappetizing!  The side salad was nicely (lightly) dressed, and the rice was fine.\n\nOVERALL: Having to wait more than 10+min for a table when we had a reservation already put Tuba Restaurant on the naughty list.... The kicker was the COLD FOOD, which really turned me off from Tuba Restaurant and earned it a 2star rating.  Price seemed to be reasonable for SF (~$40 including tax+ tip for 2 apps & 1 entree), but I will not be returning.", "author": "Susanna W."}

I called the restaurant first to confirm they had vegetarian options which they did.\n\nI actually expected it to be a bit run down and more self service based on the sign (yeah, I was imagining a order at counter - wait to pick up order kind of place).  I was surprised to see a nice welcoming and cozy atmosphere when we finally got there.\n\nIt was not full by the time we were there, and that is surprising considering the food and service is exceptional!\n\nWe decided to sit on the side with the pillows.  It was really comfortable considering the pillow was a good back support.\n\nAfter getting some recommendations, we ordered the hot plate as the appetizer and ordered 3 vegetarian plates and one salmon dish.  We ended up taking the salmon dish with us to go as we ended up running a tad close to the time our show was about to start.  It wasn't their fault since we got there with about an hour to spare and had ordered appetizers.  It ended up to be too much food anyway, so that was a good thing.\n\nThey give you some amazing bread and spiced butter!  Again, the bread was AMAZING.  It was really flavorful and went absolutely well with the spiced butter they provided.   We probably got about 4 refills of it (talk about generous).  We got champagne also.  I decided to try the yogurt drink they had.  Boy was that rich.  It was definitely good for you, but it was really rich.  Quality for sure!  I had to share that with the table to finish the glass.  They were kind enough to bring small samples for each of my friends instead of me having to pour some into empty glasses.  That is really nice of them and thus, it goes to show how good our waitresses were.\n\nThe dishes included two different types of eggplant selection, a falafel  salad, and a salmon dish.

When two of us showed up at the restaurant, the host was rude and angry that we had not notified him of our change in party size earlier.

I could have been content just dipping my bread in that alone all night. \nWe also ordered the crab cakes (I'm not sure how much of a Turkish dish that is) although still it was cooked just right, again very flavorful and came on top of a bed of greens that had a nice light dressing with hints of mint in it.\nWe shared a main course called the Manti which was dumplings with garlic yogurt sauce and mint. Again, it was perfect and flavored so perfectly. \nWe were so content and full and not ready to move yet we sat and stayed and had another drink.

Being Turkish myself, I jumped on the menu to try and get a variety of things so we could figure out what was best.\n\nThe mucver (mooj-vare) was fantastic. For those who don't know, it's essentially zucchini and other random green vegetables mashed together and fried into a ball using an egg batter that's a little heavy on the dill. It reminded of me aunt's cooking and it might have actually been the highlight of the meal!\n\nWe then had the hunkar begendi (bay-end-ee), which was a creamy pile of eggplant mush, heavy on garlic, with pieces of lamb in it. If you like eggplant, you should definitely get this dish. If you don't, avoid it all costs. Because you're really just eating delicious eggplant mush.\n\nLast, we had the mixed grill, which had a chicken kebab, lamb kebab, kofte kebab, adana kebab, and the world's tiniest single lamb chop. The tiny lamb chop of good, the kofte kebab standard, and the chicken/lamb kebab forgettable (as they usually are most everywhere). That said, the adana kebab was awesome.

Kept it simple with a falafel salad, which was great to share and scrumptious with feta filled falafel.

Finished off with oven-baked rice pudding: light and a perfect pallet cleaner. Not only was the food amazing, but the service was amazing; attentive and very quick.", "author": "Cristina M."}

While it's great that you can bring your own wine for now, the food was good but not out of this world, nothing to be excited about necessarily.  There were two of us and our order took a really long time.  Our appetizer came out first and was cold - they gladly took it back (but don't they check it before it goes out?).  It took about another 30 minutes or so to see our entrees.  While our server was very kind and apologetic, it ruined the experience.  We observed other parties who got there after us had both their apps and entrees served. Perhaps they are working out those kinks, but seems to be a trend as seen in the other reviews.  \n\nIt's really too bad that this was our first impression as we went in not having high expectations to begin with, only to have a nice meal with good service.

I made my first visit to Tuba a few nights after it opened as the third wheel to a couple that I'm friends with, and without a doubt, will be my go-to place when I'm craving some Turkish fare.\n\nThe atmosphere was warm and inviting with decorations one could tell that some extra attention and care had been taken.   Our starters which we shared were the Ezme (my favorite) and a falafel salad.  The falafel was warm and crisp on the outside, but not dried out, and had a bit of melting goat cheese in the middle, a nice touch.\n\nMy main course was the lamb chops which were grilled amazingly.  I also shared a little of an eggplant dish that I can't remember the name of.  I had Irmik for dessert.  It was a warm treat of pine nuts sauteed in butter mixed with cinnamon and semolina, all topped with a little vanilla ice cream. The dessert I ate was new to me and pretty good, but at that point I was already full.  Be careful not to fill up and overdo it on the unlimited bread they'll offer to bring you.  I skipped the Turkish coffee since I was headed to SFO for a red eye that night, but left Tuba more than satisfied and excited to return.\n\nOnce their liquor license is approved, it can only get better when they can serve some nice selections from Kavaklidere, or an Efes in a frosty glass.", "author": "Aaron D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-03", "description": "Merhaba Tuba! Welcome to my neighborhood; I've been waiting for you for soooo long!\n\nI can't begin to describe how excited I am about this place. When people ask me what I miss about Turkey (I moved to the US in 1994), my answer  always begins with the same duo: \"I miss the Aegean Sea and I miss the food.\" I always add that I also miss Turkish hospitality. \n\nWell. \n\nThe Aegean Sea remains far away, but Tuba brings to my adopted home, the Mission, both the food and the hospitality that I'd been missing. \n\nReservations (in response to an earlier review): I made reservations on Opentable.com, and upon arriving at the restaurant (a little after 6 pm--I was rushing to get to a show that night), I realized I didn't need to. The place was empty when I arrived. I think more people began coming in around 6:30 or so. By the time I left the restaurant around 7:30 pm, the restaurant was full, but there were still tables available. My suggestion: if you can, use Opentable.com -- it's handy, has an iPhone app, and you get credit the more you use it.  \n\nHospitality: My partner-in-crime wasn't there when I arrived at Tuba, so I stood there for a second, looking at the menu. The owner immediately noticed me and welcomed me in. As soon as I sat down, he asked if I would like some tea or coffee while I waited. We chatted a bit about his restaurant, and because he doesn't have his liquor license yet, he encouraged me to bring my own from the store at the end of the block if I needed some beer or wine with my meal. He mentioned he expects to get his license in the next two weeks (this was about a week ago). He was happy to provide a corkscrew or a bottle opener and glasses for us. Such a warm person. I immediately felt at home in this space, and getting to speak in Turkish with him was an added bonus. \n\nThe food: My ultimate test of authenticity is the dolma. I can walk into a Middle Eastern caf\u00e9, take one look at the dolmas, and be able to tell whether they're from a can or homemade (sorry to say, folks, most of the time, they're from a can). A restaurant, of course, is different. I asked our waiter if they were homemade just in case, and they were...and they were almost as good as grandma's. Almost. My partner-in-crime, who apparently doesn't usually like dolma, ate all of his, so there you go. \n\nThe other appetizers we got were the sigara b\u00f6rek and ezme (the regular kind, not the zucchini kind). The b\u00f6rek was great (careful with your first bite--it's hot!), and the ezme was out of this world. We tried in vain to stop ourselves from spreading the ezme on the delicious pide (not pita) bread so we didn't get too full. \n\nWell, we did get too full, and we weren't so hungry at 6 pm to begin with. Fortunately, we had ordered the mixed grill to share (the one-person version rather than the mixed grill for two). It came with lamb chop (fantastic!), chicken kebab, shish kebab, adana kebab, rice, and veggies (I think I'm forgetting one more kind of kebab on there). It was plenty of food for both of us after all the appetizers, and yet another affirmation that Oh. Yes. I do looooove meat on a skewer. \n\nWith no room for dessert, I had to skip the irmik helvasi that I was looking forward to sampling. Next time! \n\nJust thinking about the menu makes my mouth water. There's so much variety and deliciousness on that menu that I just can't wait to return! \n\nBonus points for Tuba: \n1. As someone who learned English as a second language, and who is now an English teacher, I have an instinctive habit of recognizing typos and grammatical errors on menus, especially when they're not American restaurants. I saw no errors on Tuba's menu. \n2. Wine-red walls always make me feel at home...so do beautiful dark wood furniture.", "author": "Yakamoz S."}

It usually happens in the company of others. Perhaps you've just launched into a sotto voice diatribe about how not awesome the mole/falafel/burger/hip food of the moment you ordered is. It could be after a snooty aside about the played out decor or the indifferent service. The critical wheels of your brain are well lubricated with 30 weight haterade and you're already salivating over the next Yelp bomb you'll drop perhaps as soon as right then if you can punch out something appropriately pithy on your ninjaphone. \n\nYou stop and wonder if your urge to disassemble your dining experience is, itself, crapping on your dining experience or (sometimes more importantly) the experience of your homies. \n\nWell, I'm here to say \"funk that!\" Top off the pretty hate machine with another quart of vitriolade and let it rip. Like I'm about to. \n\nThe oh-so-soon to be missus wanted to give these guys 1 star. We could go with 1.5 stars, let's call it that. We'll round up to 2 thanks to our $25 of flat, unseasoned Turkish food for $12 Groupon and the two glasses of wine they comped us for the 52 minute wait between our salad and main courses. \n\nThis place is pricey homes and doesn't really show out with anything to set it above your corner schwarma shop. In fact, we both ranked it a solid cut below the late night kabob cart (see NYC). Why? Lack of flavor! \n\nDings \n- regular bread at the table - weird. Nothing specifically wrong with it but we were expecting pita and it didn't quite jive with the food. \n- cold dip thing tasted like... hmm, mostly nothing \n- Sheppard's salad was basically a Greek salad but ended up being a LOT of cucumbers, a few bits of tomato, red onion, 4 olives, and some parsley. \n- manti pasta was uber watery, bland, and chef boy-r-dee tasting with little or no sauce or taste beyond general ground beef \n- kabob sampler was the highlight, everything well cooked but somewhat under seasoned (a recurring theme)\n\nThe worst gripes were the total lack of communication in the service. Almost an hour between salad and mains without any kind of communication in the interim sucks. After a few attempts to get information on when we could expect our food we were met with confusion (\"did you get your salad yet?\") and then lame excuses (\"the pasta takes a long time to cook\" what pasta takes an hour to cook?). \n\nEvery restaurant can have bad kitchen nights and this might have been one of them. Our server did her best to recover and was gracious and apologetic but the stand out failure of our meal was how often we had to reach for the salt and pepper shakers just to make the food passable. \n\nI might expect that at a steak house but at a Turkish restaurant? I know a few things about Middle Eastern food and one of them is that lack of flavor and seasoning is not usually an issue. If I'm going to pay double what I'd pay at Truly Mediterranean I would like it to be at least slightly better as opposed to much worse. \n\nRemember kids, honesty goes both ways.

Living in the City, I wasn't going to complain about Turkish food being now a thirty minute WALK from my house rather than a thirty minute DRIVE -- so I decided to bring a date and check it out.  And in many ways, these guys have upped their game.\n\nThe decor is nice; it creates a good ambience.  We brought our own bottle of wine (Tuba doesn't yet have their liquor license), but there's no corkage fee -- and the place was full last night, so I'm sure the liquor store a few doors down is running a tidy profit.  We ordered what ended up being far too much food, but we wanted to try as much as possible.  \n\nFor appetizers, we got the Ezme (red pepper paste, which is the same as New Kapadokia's, and one of the sources of my addiction to that place) and the Feta Prawns, which were excellent; the sauce they came with made for great bread dipping.  We got two entrees and a salad.  The Beyti (meat wrapped in lavash bread) was quite good, and the lamb chops expertly grilled.  The salad was merely decent; I think it came with breaded prawns.  Dessert was something that had pine nuts in it, and it came topped with ice cream; I'm still trying to figure out how we managed room in our stomachs to eat it.  \n\nThe staff was quite attentive and made sure we had plenty of bread and water.  We came in late, so the head manager chatted with us for a while at the end of the evening.  All in all, an easy decision of five stars, and I'll most certainly be back!", "author": "Shawn A."}

We had a reservation but not all of our people showed up on time.  They seated us anyways and were really patient with us as we got settled and waited for people to arrive.  Even when we were kind of blocking the doorway, they didn't get irate and let us take our time.  I know how unwieldy a large group like that is, so I really appreciated their patience with us.\n\nThe food was delicious!!  I don't know that I've had much other Turkish food to compare it to, but it was good.  We got the \"Patlcan salatas grilled\" eggplant puree appetizer on my side of the table which was really good.  Large chunks of garlic yummmm.  The bread and butter were really tasty too.  For my entree I got the beef ravioli (I don't remember what it's called, started with an M) in some sort of tomato yogurt sauce.  It was so good I ate it all, which is pretty rare for lil ol' me!  Also had the Turkish pilsner Effe, which was pretty good as well.\n\nOnce our large and unwieldy group had finished eating, we stayed on chatting (part of this large group were six high school friends, some of whom hadn't seen each other in 8 years) for a good 20 min.  Which could be kind of a jerk move if the place was busy, but there wasn't anyone waiting for a table by that point.  The wait staff never rushed us or asked us to move along, again I really appreciate that sort of thing.\n\nTo summarize: Yummy food, good atmosphere, friendly (but not overbearing) staff.

You will LOVE their lamb.  no? why?  you don't like gamey meat?  You will LOVE their lamb.  Oh my god!  Thank you. Finally.  A place that knows how to prepare and cook lamb.  There is not one hint of gaminess.  It is simply delicious.  The lamb chops are marinated for 3 days and oh so delish.  I had the lamb shank special, and it was literally falling off the bone - fork tender and delicious.  So so so delicious.  Did I say try the lamb?  Really.. if you read any of my reviews, because I know how lamb is \"supposed\"to taste (like it does here) I have a hard time eating it in places that don't know how to prepare it. \n\nThe falafel with the goat cheese center... YUM!  oh so good. \n\nMy brother really liked the Cevizli Ezme (walnut red pepper paste)\n\nI also highly recommend the crabcake, falafel, and borek (boregi). The lentil soup is wonderful, fresh & hit the spot. I wouldn't say it is the 'best\" but I will definitely order it again.  \n\nThe feta prawns I thought were ok- my mom loved them. \n\nThe icli kofte (kibbeh) was not crispy on the outside as it should be, but had good flavor.  I would order it again hoping that it was an off batch. \n\nThe Mucver (zucchini fritters) also had great flavor but was too wet in the center both times I ordered them.  It may be a consistency you like, but I prefer it them a bit more dry & with a little bit of crispiness on the outside.  \n\nFor dessert we got the baklava, Pyramid Noisette Chocolate, and Kunefe. My favorite was the pyramid. The kunefe was so good. The baklava was a bit dry & I was told that it depends on the batch of baklava, since it is made in house.

Basically they're made of spicy ground lamb breaded and fried into the shape of a small football. My mouth is watering.\n\nFrom there we moved to the main courses: Hunkar Begendi and Beyti Adana. The first one is unlike anything else we have in America. It's basically mashed potatoes made out of eggplant. I was perplexed. And of course, it's topped with delectable lamb chunks. The second entree was again lamb, wrapped in dough with yogurt and a tomato sauce.\n\nLastly, dessert. Obviously, I was getting pretty full, but if I was gonna go Turkish, I was gonna go big.

Dark rich colors (deep reds, browns, etc.), give it a warm feeling while the various vases and art throughout made it feel authentic.

We asked for one special request which was promptly served. Our water and wine glasses were refilled and our plates were removed quickly upon finishing. \n\nFOOD\nThe food was very tasty.

My number one love and activity there has been the food.  \n\nI really wanted to love this place, but it is unfair for me to expect what you would experience food-wise in Turkey here in San Francisco, but I can't help to compare.  All things considered, I thought the food at Tuba was good, the service very good.\n\nI was so excited to try this place and never would have known about it had I not seen their Groupon offer (thank you for offering up one as adding incentive to try and making your presence know in SF).  The name doesn't exactly imply Turkish, so never would have known.  I've walked by this place a few times in the past and had no idea.  I'm always on the lookout for Turkish restaurants, especially with menus that go beyond kebap and baklava.  Tuba certainly does.\n\nThe front of house staff were super friendly and accommodating.  We didn't have a reservation and the place was packed, but they were able to seat us anyway.  We had a few appetizers, entree, and desert.\n\nFood-wise, the highlight was the Kunefe with a little tea (in the little curvy Turkish tea glasses at that) to wash it down.  I never had Kunefe like this in Turkey.  The Tuba version had generous amount of cheese filling really made it stand out.\n\nOverall, yes this place is worth a try, the food is good, service friendly, ambiance ok, but if you have experienced Turkish food in Turkey and are expecting the same, you may be a little disappointed.", "author": "eugene c."}

I'll get the cons out of the way first and explain why I took off a star:  My girlfriend remarked that our waitness looked like she could have used a good meal herself, and that she seemed rather listless and unattentive.  I had to ask her twice for lemon for my drink, the yummy bread was removed from our table to make room for our salads without asking us if we would like to keep it.  Finally, when my girl friend paid with a credit card, she noted that it was left unattended for quite a while at the station where anyone could have picked it up.  She did tell a man who said he was the owner and he was quite apologetic for this having happened.  \n\nNow the pros:  Delicious Turkish food of which we had, between us, a mixed grill shishkabob, a prawn salad with pistascios and mango salsa (could have used more of this!), another salad with chopped tomatos and cucumbers, a grilled steak, both of the entrees came with very flavorful rice, and we both split a creme brule'and a hazelnut noisette pyramid for dessert.

The apps were so good, so flavorful, that even though I was full I couldn't stop eating.  We were with a friend who has lived in Turkey and she marveled at how authentic everything was.\n\nAnother great dish is the grilled chicken with a savory sauce of tomato, garlic, pepper, onion, etc.  It was perfect, as were the lamb chops, which are so easy to over or under cook but these were just right.\n\nThe bread, herbed butter, and tomato garlic spread were so good that you have to be careful to save room 'cause you're not going to want to leave anything on your plate.\n\nThe atmosphere is elegant but you can definitely come as you are, it's  not stuffy at all.

We were greeted very poorly at the door by the hostess. She treated us like we were vagrants since we had the coupon, and she knew nothing about it. She then calls a manager, didn't even offer to seat us, and the manager acted confused. So I tried to explain to them that I have this coupon, and they may check with their sources. So She goes and calls the boss, and then comes back much nicer, and seats us. What that shows to me is that they have poor communication in their restaurant management. I think it all started off with the wrong vibe and the way they treated us. I don't know if it's because my date was African American or maybe simply because they weren't familiar with the coupon deal, but they were not very nice to us at all, and at no point did I feel welcome.\n\nWe sit down, and proceed to order food. The cold appetizer platter was well presented and delicious, bread was very good.\n\nThe Entres were huge, simply too much food for one person to eat. We got the Eggplant puree with lamb cubes, which was mediocre at best. My salad dish had giant Falafels but they didn't taste very fresh or flavorful. I couldn't finish any of it, so we packed it up for the dog.\n\n\nDecor was nice, food was generally well presented, though flavors were very mediocre since I've had phenomenal MiddleEastern food..

The menu is pretty standard - there were a few surprises. For example, an avocado salsa on one of the salads and the pistachio encrusted prawns.  Being it was our first time at the restaurant, we decided to go basic with the cold appetizer platter, the sauteed shrimp in the pepperoncini sauce, and a side of the falafel. We also ordered a couple of glasses of wine.  \n\nI'd give more stars for the ambiance, decor, and all over set-up.  Tuba does have a nice, cozy vibe.  Even romantic.  The artwork is an interesting choice - my friend had just had her eyes dilated and wondered if the paintings she saw were the result of her slightly blurred version. \n\nTo start they offer complimentary bread accompanied by a nondescript red aioli type item, a few chunks of feta, and one olive.  The bread was my favorite part of the meal.  The server  indicated that they make it fresh daily.  The feta was nice and my friend and I split the one olive. The dip was flavorless.\n\nWe waited quite awhile for our wine - it was early - three servers - not a lot of tables. We caught our server's attention and inquired about the wine --- it ended-up arriving with the meal. Everything came at the same - the hot and cold dishes - which is one of my peeves.  Plus, there wasn't ample space for all of the dishes.  I understand that we ordered all small plates, but they could've asked about the delivery pattern.  \n\nService, despite the wait, was still friendly and personable.  \n\nNow for the food. The platter consisted of dolmas,  hummus, ezme, an eggplant salad, spinach dip, a thick yogurt, a caviar dip, and a white bean salad.  The portions were typical.  The food was 50/50. Overall,  I've had better in other Turkish restaurants and homemade by Turkish friends.  The best items were the hummus, the eggplant salad, the thick yogurt, and spinach dip. \n\nThe falafel were nothing special and for me, the shrimp were overcooked.  The sauce was Ok - I wanted more zip.  \n\nThe food pricing was fine.  The wine was also reasonably priced.  \n\ni wouldn't go back - I didn't get enough flavor nor that mom and pop feel on the plate that I so appreciate in these types of restaurants.", "author": "Carson R."}

A warm homemade bread with flavored butter was set before us right away.  We decided to order dishes that we had not tried before since we were used to eating the wonderful kebabs at Park Gyro. I ran into my Turkish friends who suggested we order the \"Tuba Cold Appetizer Plate\" which was a great sampler of all the appetizers.  \n\nThe Patlcan salatas grilled eggplant puree, bell pepper tomato garlic on the appetizer sampler was just delicious. The Hummus pureed garbanzo beans, lemon tahini sauce was good,( but better at Park Gyro in my opinion). The Mercimek Kofte lentils, parsley, green onions, bulgur was quite tasty. Kabak Ezme zucchini, dill, mint, yogurt light garlic was light and also yummy. Piyaz white bean salad with green onions, tomato and tahini vinegar lemon sauce was very nice, but the Ezme crushed walnuts, pepper paste, tomato paste, garlic, cumin was too spicy for my palate. I really, really enjoyed the Haydari fresh dill, mint, thick yogurt, light garlic and wish I could make it myself!\n\nFor our entree, we shared H\u00fcnkar Beendi pureed eggplant with mozzarella cheese topped with lamb cubes. The eggplant had such a great smoky & creaminess that was so smooth and together with the tasty lamb cubes, it was really delicious. A very nice surprise.\n\nFor dessert, Ali (owner and chef) especially made a K\u00fcnefe Two layers of kadayf (shredded fillo dough) filled with sweet cheese, baked to\nperfection and served with homemade syrup and pistachio nut that was just out of this world!!!

The appetizer platter we ordered (and falafel) were also super yummy, so thumbs up for all of that.  \n\nThe rest, however, was somewhat disappointing.  First of all, while not in a hurry, our main courses took far too long to arrive - conspicuously so.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-29", "description": "OK. I told the folks I would write a nice review about them since they gave us such a great experience.  \n\nTuba is a nice, clean and modern Turkish restaurant, tuck between the Mission District and Noe Valley.  We would never have thought of driving to this neighborhood for dinner had it not for the Groupon deal we got (a plug for Groupon).  My Groupon would have expired to nothing, but the owner extended it for another week so I get to try their restaurant - a good business decision...\n\nI haven't had much experience with Turkish food, but I liked what I ate there. \n\nThe bread was warm and has tiny sesame seeds to make it smell good.  The spiced up whipped butter was perfect for spreading.  We ordered Kofte Kebab (beef and lamb) and Shrimp Scampi - both were delicious and properly done. The vegetables were nicely done and we didn't know how to eat Turkish food, so we dipped everything into everything that was on our plate.  We topped it off with their signature dessert, the Kunefe.  The Kunefe is layered shredded dough, cheese, pistachio, fried to perfection.  It was sweet, but not over sweat, but has an interesting crusty texture for a dessert.  The biggest draw for the this restaurant was the service.  The host and waitress was very kind and attentive.  They were very nice to us.  I read some recent posting that people were annoyed with the service, but I believe it might have been because of the mass number of people arriving during the final day of Groupon expiration.  It's tough running a business, but even tougher when you have impatient customers (I am one of them from time to time).\n\nOverall 4 out of 5 Stars\n\n-Food - tasty (good tasting food doesn't have to be authentic*)\n-Menu - simple\n-Cost - reasonable, not pricey at all\n-Service - exceptional\n-Parking - only street parking, so it's a bit difficult to do on weekends.\n\n* I know I will get some people gasping for air when I said \"good tasting food doesn't have to be authentic\" so I want to clear the air.  I believe food is dynamic and can change, as long as it tastes good or better than the original.  However, I do believe authenticity is important for those who missed the taste of their homeland.  If you are tasting food for childhood memories, they have to be authentic.  My mom used to pay a lot of money for not-so-great tasting desserts and fruit.  When I asked her why she would eat something that doesn't taste good, she said the taste and flavor brings back good memories.  Now that my mother has past away, I long for home cooked meals that reminds me of my mother's cooking more than anything restaurants can dish out.  \n\nTabu is a modern restaurant - whether you go there for authenticity or creativity, you must admit, the food there taste pretty darn good", "author": "Duke D."}

I know restaurants can cram a few more tables in by buying tiny tables, but I think it's annoying. Even though there were larger tables for four available all during our dinner, we were seated at a dinky table where we constantly had to be careful not to push something over the edge. Adding to that, they keep a bottle of water on your table, taking up precious space. If the table is so small, why not come by with a water pitcher to refill our glasses? And, then, why serve the food on such large dishes? To make it impressive, I guess. Actually, the food was very good. Salmon was excellent, the shrimp kebab ok.

It just opened this year on Guerrero and 22nd, in San Francisco, and I was very happy with the discovery. \nI had the tomato, onion and cucumber salad, a big platter full of fresh red delicious ripe vine tomato with the perfect Mediterranean seasoning of oil and vinegar, and leaves of mint very well cut so the aroma and flavour is not too intrusive. \nMy entree was the eggplant puree with lamb and tomato sauce. It was light, perfect amount of food and very nice combination of flavours, although next time I will order the lamb ribs, which I saw them being served to another customer and they looked just as if I was back home in Spain: small. juicy surrounded by that small and golden perfect line of lamb fat. I asked the owner why the lamb didn't have that strong aftertaste usual to find when eating lamb and he told me that the lamb he uses is local fresh lamb meat, not the usual imported frozen and cheaper lamb used in many restaurants.\nThe specialty dessert was good (kenafi, I think), although it is so sweet that you should better make some room for it (for intance by eating less warm bread, which in the other hand is great, with cummin).\nMy only concern was the hummus. It was good but I missed some thickness and taste. I have realize that lately some restaurants offer a variation of hummus that is lighter, maybe to avoid the garbanzo and garlic flavour to be too intrusive, but I miss the usual texture and taste. \nI would definetely recommend the place for a nice dinner for couples or a small group of friends. If you make a reservation, ask for one of the two window tables, they are a very cozy corner.", "author": "Clarisse C."}

I love the dolmas-- they have a unique texture and flavor with delicious spices. The stuffed eggplant is really good, and the salmon is pretty top-notch (they manage to get the skin perfectly crispy--not easy!) The atmosphere is also inviting, with nice low lighting and cool art on the walls.\n\nBut honestly, I've been there twice now and have to say the service was truly sub-par. The first time I tried Tuba, it had just opened up and I guess they weren't getting much business yet. My girlfriend and I were one of two parties in the place, and the waiter was practically breathing down our necks the entire meal. When he wasn't checking in on us every five minutes, the entire waitstaff was just standing around the back of the restaurant staring at us. Um...awkward. Not to mention how every time someone stopped to look at the menu in the window, the manager would literally SPRINT across the restaurant, run outside, and beg them to come inside. One time I think he went an entire block to chase someone down. Hey Tuba? Desperation is not appetizing.\n\nThen at the end of the meal, I decided to order a cup of coffee (my girlfriend had the Turkish coffee which she said tasted like dirt, but maybe that's just her taste). So when the waiter brings the cup, I add cream, stir it up, and get ready to enjoy a nice coffee...until I take a sip and...it's definitely a strange tasting coffee. And by that I mean it wasn't coffee. It was tea. Yeahhhh tea. Majorly disappointing.\n\nThe second time I went to Tuba they at least got the order right, but they can't seem to get the timing down. The appetizer came fast enough, but then there was a weirdly long wait before the entree. The waitress was kind of chilly, too, like she was mad at us or wanted to kill us, or something.\n\nSo, although the food is definitely tasty, it's not out of this world-- and when you combine that with crappy service I'm just not thrilled with Tuba.", "author": "J P."}

Amazing, fresh out of the oven, studded with... something tasty, kinda salty... anyway, perfect. And some sort of peppered, cilantro'd butter made out of heaven and happiness. We kind of ate too much of it, honestly, especially once our waiter, Michael, brought out some sort of yoghurty dip and some spicy red stuff.\n\nWe started with crab cakes for me and lentil soup for him. The crab cakes had this awesome consistency, soft and moist with a crunchy crust, and a bonus surprise of toasted pine nuts! What a perfect addition! It came with a salad that had this perfectly tangy dressing with just a hint of spice. Killer. I had trouble sharing. Boy's lentil soup was delicious, flavorful without being too salty, and again, with a hint of tang. Mediterranean. That's the thing. Right? Anyway, delicious.\n\nThat reminds me. Never, during the course of our meal, did we reach for the salt or pepper. Everything was perfectly seasoned. \n\nEntrees. Yes. I had the lamb chops, Boy had the Salmon. Amazing. The salmon was perfectly tender, seasoned but not overly so. It was a great piece of fish, and you could taste it. The seasoning, and the slight bitterness in the rice (bay?) complemented, instead of covering, the taste. The lamb was perfectly cooked, with herbs that combined to make some sort of magical aura around the lamb, but I couldn't identify if you paid me a million dollars, on a bed of the same rice as the salmon, with some awesome kindofmaybe pickled carrots, zucchini and maybe cucumber? Anyway, awesome, and perfect consistency, a slight crunch, but not too much. \n\nDessert! Boy had this incredible pyramid of panna cotta. Something like chocolate, then regular, then dark chocolate? It was some sort of creamy custardy chocolatey thing, then the most perfect panna cotta ever invented. Seriously. The whole thing was shaped into a pyramid, then covered in dark chocolate the Incas and Egyptians would be jealous of, mottled with white chocolate in cute little stripes, then surrounded in (mango? apricot? mangicot?) syrupy-puree stuff that had me literally licking his plate. When he wasn't looking. Because he's embarrassed by me sometimes. I had the house specialty, a (guys, I loved it so much I copied from the menu and emailed it to my mother with a picture) \"Kunefe: Two layers of kadayif (shredded fillo dough) filled with sweet cheese, baked to perfection, and served with homemade syrup and pistachio nuts\" Salty-sweet, warm in the middle with a cool syrup, crunchy and delicious, I can see why it was the house special. I can't wait to go back and try the other one I couldn't pronounce. \n\nBoth of us had Turkish Coffee with dessert, which explains why I'm in Shotwell's Bar at 11:50 pm buzzing and drinking red wine and writing this review. OMGWHOAGUYS\n\n\nAnyway, highly recommended, a great asset to that block, which already has some excellent businesses (Tao is amazing, people.

Also, Que Tal is an awesome place to waste a morning, or work, whatever, and Liberties is a gem.) and hopefully won't fall prey to the same curse that has killed many a restaurant in that space. \n\nAlso, apparently they need a tuba.

I had never heard of this place, but after combing yelp for something that seemed interesting but not too expensive, we think we scored. When we arrived, we felt like we were being welcomed into someone's home. The manager (owner?), greeted us like long lost friends. Service from start to finish was efficient and very personable and seemed to be quick without making us feel rushed. We got to sample a few by-the-glass wines before making our decision. They brought out warm flat bread with olives, feta and humus. Very yummy. We had the crab cake appetizer which was delicious. Very crabby (in a good way) and nice crisp crust on the outside (made with bulgar, I think). My entree was the beef manti. Loved the dainty little pockets and the sauce was just great. Hubby had the chicken shishkabobs which can be the epitome of sameness. This was just great. The meat was tender and flavorful. Loved the grilled veggies with it. The sole reason we picked this restaurant was to satisfy my craving for kunafe. I've had kunafe at a few other spots in the city, but this one was my favorite so far.

It doesn't look all that from the outside, but once you get inside it is gorgeous - lots of wood, bright cushions and fabrics, interesting modern artwork and colored glassware. It feels a bit like stepping into a very stylish pasha's tent.\nThe service is fantastic, really friendly and helpful but unobtrusive, and very kind to single diners coming in by themselves to enjoy a delicious meal over a book (there have always been several of these in there whenever I go - and it is great to find a restaurant that treats us solo diners well).\nThe food - wow! Very authentic, varied and tasty. The dips, cold meze and vegetables sides are all great (especially the zucchini fritters) but the starring role has to be the meat, which is what I am usually craving when I end up here.\nSucculent, perfectly spiced kebabs, lamb chops and kofte grilled over a high heat to get that lovely crust on the outside, but remain tender and delicious. These guys are artists at this. The mixed grill is the best showcase for their skill - enough to share (or take half home if you are dining alone) and with a fantastic side of herbed, sauteed (I think?) carrot and zucchini and thinly sliced pickled red onion.\nExcellent wine list too - some unusual middle-eastern wines and a good selection of cheaper/more familiar Californian and South American options, with a good range of by-the-glass prices.", "author": "Alex G."}

By my count there have been about 4 restaurants in this same spot over the past 5 years, and I would put Tuba somewhere in the middle of that group.  The feta shrimp we started out with were OK...they tasted as if they had been shelled before cooking, rather than after, which tends to drain the flavor.  My main course was beyti:  ground lamb and beef with spices, yogurt and tomato sauce.  It was fine, but a little bland.  The tomato sauce honestly tasted like it had just been poured from a can, and had zero pizazz.  The chicken kebab was also just fine, but was a little dry and lacking it spice.

The service was good, although they had a huge party to tend to so the waitstaff was not as attentive as I'd have hoped.  However, the owner kept checking in with us to make sure everything was alright, and that was nice.  We ordered the crispy falafel, the beyti and the mixed grill.  The crispy falafel was good but slightly on the salty side.  The beyti was pretty good although the sirloin was a little on the dry side.  And the mixed grill was well...mixed.  We asked for the meat to be cooked medium.  The lamb was fantastic.  It was cooked perfectly.  However, the chicken and the kebab were overcooked.  The chicken was dry and the kebab was even dryer--to the point where it crumbled in your mouth and you had to drink something to get it down.  If not for the dryness, this dish would have been very good.  The meats were all spiced perfectly.\nI would definitely go back as I'm sure they are still working out some of the kinks.", "author": "Las Y."}

I went to Tuba with 6 other people and everyone enjoyed the food.  For starters, we ordered the typical dolmas and falafels, which were pretty good.  As for entrees, we all kind of sampled each other's dish.  There were absolutely no complaints!  Some of the dishes ordered were: Adana kebab (3 people got this and they all loved it), Musakka (reminded me of a lasagna except with no pasta), and a dumpling dish stuffed with beef (or maybe it was lamb).  Even though the dumplings were good, I would recommend ordering an entree that comes with rice.  I don't know how they make their rice, but it is REALLY good.  For dessert, we shared the Kunefe and Pyramid Noisette Chocolate.  Both DELICIOUS!  Our waitress was also very attentive (although the restaurant wasn't extremely busy on the Sunday night that we went).  Bottom line: If you're looking for a new restaurant to try in the Mission, I'd definitely recommend going here!", "author": "Jennifer S."}
