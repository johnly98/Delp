Where the rap playlist was amazing, waiters were hilarious and rubber duckies  were a plenty. Fast forward to moving to north beach, 2 blocks from their NB location. What a horribly different experience. Namely bc of a waiter named Evan along with another gal there who kept citing that she was tired to excuse for the mean service. To start with Evan - he hilariously told us which dishes were shit and that he'd just not bring them out, and when we asked for what we wanted, he let us know that they don't do boxes and all wasted food gets thrown away... like oh really bro? Food gets thrown away in this city and it's OUR fault?! Then when we asked to buy a bottle of sake, he let us know he needs to get the table ready for their 12 reso... it was ELEVEN and the place was EMPTY. Alright Evan, got you loud and clear.

But surprisingly enough, Chubby Noodle does exist and they offer a the brunch deal for $45.\n\nThe only down side is that for people who aren't capable of drinking as much (myself) then it's hard to get the full bang for your buck. But regardless, the food was great and they let you try every dish (upon request). My favorite dish was probably the pepper shrimp. It was so flavorful and crunchy and also came with this dipping sauce that made it so much better. I was surprised I liked the shrimp so much since normally I think shrimp are weird, but yeah, it's that good. \n\nThe drinks are good too, the day I went they had sangria and a watermelon mimosa. The sangria was definitely better, though, and they even add a cute tiny rubber duck inside the drinks, haha. I may have walked out of the restaurant with one or two rubber ducks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-11", "description": "We had a yummy dinner at Chubby Noodle in North Beach. This is actually Chubby Noodle's second location. It opened in June 2015. The original, located in the Marina District, opened in May 2014. This is a popular Asian restaurant and bar serving modern, fusion-type fare along with sake, cocktails, beer, and wine.\n\nWe walked in around 6pm on a Thursday and there wasn't a wait. However, when we left around 7pm, there was a wait. This place isn't terribly big, but it's not tiny either. I'd guesstimate they have seating for roughly 40-50 customers, bar and dining room combined. They're able to accommodate larger groups (5+), but only 1 or 2 at a time. The space consists of a combination of 4-person booths and tables with both bench and stool (no backs) seating. Booths are definitely the way to go here. You can call the restaurant to book reservations.\n\nThe restaurant has a simple, clean, and contemporary design. The build-out and furniture still look and feel relatively new. The interior has an Asian flair with lots of light woods (some of which resemble bamboo), suspended paper lanterns, and bar decor such as a Laughing Buddha statue and an assortment of Japanese teapots. The storefront has two windows which were open during our visit. These gave the inside a bit of an open-air feel. The atmosphere was casual and relaxed and the music that played was early 2000s hip hop and R&B.\n\nThe menu has more adult beverage options than it does food options. There are a little over 20 dishes to choose from, from cucumber salad and kimchi ($4 each) to tuna poke ($16) and pork ribs ($17). As for the \"noodle\" aspect of Chubby Noodles, they offer 5 different kinds of noodles: spicy garlic egg noodles, ramen, chow mein, curry lemongrass vermicelli, and pad Thai ($13-16 each, toppings extra).\n\nHere's what we tried:\n\n* Steamed pork buns - shredded pork, shiitake mushrooms, napa cabbage, Thai chili, hoisin (3 for $13)\n* Spicy garlic noodles - egg noodles, charred garlic, jalapeno, cilantro, and fried chicken ($13 for the noodles and $5 for the fried chicken)\n* Pork ribs - Coleman Ranch pork, jalapeno, vinegar soy glaze ($17)\n\nWe enjoyed everything. The food was delicious. The ingredients were good quality and each dish looked great and was presented beautifully.\n\nThe steamed pork buns were served in a dim-sum-style bamboo basket complete with lid. Each steamed pork bun came with a generous amount of shredded pork *and* chunks of rich and fatty pork belly (the latter wasn't mentioned on the menu, so it was a pleasant surprise). The pork was soft, tender, and well-seasoned with excellent flavor. The steamed buns were chewy and pillowy.\n\nThe spicy garlic noodles were fantastic. The egg noodles were thick and delectable. They were coated in a savory, addictive sauce. The fried chicken that we added on was worth it. It was lightly breaded and boneless. It came with a creamy sambal sauce on the side which looked similar to and sort of tasted like Sriracha mayo or a spicy chili aioli. Yum.\n\nThe pork ribs were terrific. There were 4-5 pieces on a plate stacked one on top of the other. The bones were big with each piece having a decent amount of meat. The meat wasn't exactly fall-off-the-bone, but it didn't have to be. It was still tender and succulent. The vinegar soy glaze was sticky and sweet. Good stuff. I recommend all of the items we had.\n\nMy buddy got a 24-ounce can of Asahi Super Dry beer for $12. I took a sip. The drink was crisp, ice cold, tasty, and refreshing.\n\nOur server was Estefania. She was cool and friendly and did a wonderful job.\n\nA single unisex restroom is located in the back. You have to walk through/past the kitchen to get there.", "author": "Daniel B."}

A couple things to make your experience more palatable--walk or grab a Lyft, you're not going to have a fun time parking, and try to go for a little off dinner; either 6 or a little before 9, but not regular dinner hours cause you'll be waiting a while. \n\nThe food was spectacular. We ordered garlic noodles, pork buns, tacos, and salmon sashimi. Sashimi was fresh and citrusy, which I normally don't like but it worked well with the sauce they sat it in. Tacos were definitely interesting, and I loved the sauce the pork was tossed in. \n\nThe garlic noodles with fried chicken are a must try. They're perfectly spicy and chewy, and the texture goes so well with the crispy chicken. One bowl is enough for a good serving size between three. The bao dough was super fluffy and the pork was tender and had just the right amount of sauce.

Make sure you call in at least a day before! Only caveat to that is you have to make sure you know how many people is in your party, and no flakes cause there's a $25 charge per person who doesn't show. They make you put down your card info.\n\nWe sat down and then got helped by the waitress asking us what drink we wanted to try, and she recommends the pineapple mimosa. We decided to give it a try, but my drink had too much champagne and barely any pineapple juice- now I'm not complaining... but then when my friend ordered it, they got a lot of pineapple juice in contrast. Also, we didn't get the duckies when we ordered it, but later ordered drinks included the duckies. The waiters keep trying to refill your drink, but I wanted to try the sangria next. When I asked for the sangria instead, they had to take away your cup and give you a new one for your different drink because of the \"no double fisting rule.\" However, the Sangria was really good! (The cold tea was a weird ginger not so tasty drink.)\n\nThere's supposed to be 16 dim sum items and 4 drink options. However, it was only 2 \"dim sum\" items or 15 food entree items, depends on how you look at it. Where's the last option though??? \n\nI have mixed feelings about the food honestly. Now, it wasn't bad, but it was way too salty, and not authentic dim sum, nor even Chinese food. Many of the dishes had ginger flavor where it doesn't usually, ie. pork wonton, dan dan mein, etc. but in a weird way, I also enjoyed it too. Strange thing too, the waitress more so decided for us what and how much we were going to get next. She put in an order with 3 dishes of xo rice noodles when we just wanted 1 (btw no xo sauce in it,) and we didn't like it so we didn't finish it. Granted, all dishes here were pretty small portions, great for trying, but she came by and said she was hesitant on letting us order more food cause we still have a lot of food, which btw, we didn't actually order. On the brighter note, with her pushing orders on us, we did end up getting to try everything on the menu.\n\nThings I did like though, was the cucumber salad, the chicken wings, salt and pepper shrimp, and the eggplants. The flavoring of the food was way too overwhelming, and salty. Tbh I feel like I lost some taste buds even now!\n\nAnyways, it was a fun experience, definitely not what I expected, but what happens when you're with a mob of Asians, eating at a non-Asian-\"Asian\" restaurant is that you get them to all critique food, and say \"that's not really dim sum.\"", "author": "Melody W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-04-09", "description": "So have been staying local lately and decided that I wanted to hit up a brunch spot in the city on a Sunday. I had done a bit of searching and realized that this pop up had grown up with multiple locations in the city. I was a fan of the pop up so I did a deeper look and realized this place was an AYCE and AYCD brunch spot. Asian Fusion food that you can nonstop eat and nonstop drinks? Don't need to sell me any further. I made my way over to this spot around 15 minutes prior to opening to grab a spot in line. Parking is a bit challenging in the area so you will definitely want to bake in some time to secure a spot. There was a line that was forming by the time I reached the restaurant. The structure is essentially 90 minutes of eating and drinking and the joint packs all of its tables in this time fashion. If you miss the first wave, you have to wait till the next wave and it keeps going. \n\nThe joint holds bar spots and tables for groups of people and the service moves quickly. The drinks are all poured into jugs and ready to be poured quickly. The servers move as quickly as the food comes out so there was constant movement. In the background you can hear the \"clubbing\" music which didn't quite fit the atmosphere but I did not mind. The one gripe I had with this spot is that, they recommend just eating whatever the kitchen prepares in batch otherwise if you want to order something specific, you may have to wait. In theory it makes sense but the reality of not being able to order and eat quickly and waiting for them to batch stuff was a bit of a \"meh\" factor for me. The price for this affair is $39 per person which is of course a great deal so that makes up some points. The menu of food offered 2 soups, 3 veggie options, 3 dumpling options, 3 dimsum options, and 3 noodle/rice options that you would receive in recycled order. During the time of being there, I was able to try the green beans, pork wontons, pork buns, salt and pepper shrimp, and the kung pao wings. All of the food was OK but this is certainly not authentic Asian food which you can get a mere few blocks away in china town. The food was either hit or miss for me personally with the stand out items being the wontons and the green beans while the others being OK. \n\nAll in all, it is a fun atmosphere and certainly worth a visit if you are looking to just continue drinking and having some food while enjoying good conversation. If you are looking for straight up authentic Asian food or really focused on great food, this place may disappoint. Still worth checking out so give it a shot and make your own decision!", "author": "Dan M."}

Being on upper Grant Avenue, it is quiet during the day but probably a different story evenings.  We came for a late lunch on a recent Friday.  We waited at the greeting area and there were four occupied tables. My friend chose a wall booth which was a bit tight for my tummy.  After a quick study, here's what we over ordered:\n\nAppetizers\n1.  Chubby fried chicken (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pm2jrEWjf1xca_BaK4YUGQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Served temperature hot, these boneless morsels went well with the provided aioli.\n\n2.  Pork belly tacos (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Nlx0-2cAuakoxMzggmpuaQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - This was my friend's choice and, yes, this was good and hearty.  The pork was tender (pork belly?) and the flavors meshed well.\n\nMains\n3.  Pad Thai (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YvOKKHbh2ZmxD_4SEYQ15A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Hearty portions and the flavors were not bad, not quite as refreshing as I hoped.  \n\n4.  Spicy garlic noodles with char siu (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=hUaTl8LpTo463X9kLP8sEg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Interesting rendition as the char siu was actually the traditional Chinese BBQ pork slices.  The spiciness came from white pepper which overwhelmed the garlic flavor.  Happy that the pork were lean slices.\n\nOur waitress was efficient and pretty vanilla.  The food came out relatively quickly as the Pad Thai and tacos were the first to come out.  The menu is a little different from their original incarnation and it is definitely brighter here.  The food rates 3.5 stars with an additional half star for having food available lunch and dinner time.  The food definitely fits the bill as far as bar food as you'd likely want something (beer or sake) to wash it down.  If you're looking for finesse or culinary skills, this probably isn't a spot you should target.  The portions are generous are I ended up bringing home almost half of each of the mains as well as four or five chicken pieces.

There were four of us total and the amount of food was just enough to feel satisfied, but not enough to leave full.  Each of the dishes were very tasty. The garlic noodles had the perfect flavor combination of salty and garlicky. The vermicelli had just the right amount of spice and flavor. Same with the green beans, which were seasoned well. The chicken was my favorite.

I generally dislike anything labeled or described as \"Asian fusion\" because Asian food is awesome on its own and doesn't need to be messed with, especially when blending with western appetites just to appeal to North Americans.\n\nChubby noodle falls into this trap as well. Salt & pepper shrimp was average, chubby chicken no better than the average karaage from your local izakaya. The name is actually the same as chubby chicken from A&W (for you Canadians) which is actually just as good if not better. The pork tacos were good but the tortilla was super greasy and felt gross to the touch.\n\nOne exception, the uber popular garlic noodles were very tasty. Best dish we tried and even worth the trip just for that.\n\nIf you like Asian food, anywhere with sushi, pad Thai, fried rice and ramen on the same menu is a red flag.

Understandable but also a little confusing as the restaurant was completely empty at this point. I was standing inside by the door and the same man asked me to wait outside, again with the snarky attitude. The restaurant is small, but I was 1 person of a group of 7 standing in an empty restaurant, so I found this a little ridiculous. I've been here previously and have had people standing almost right against my table while I was dining as they were waiting to be seated - there must have been about 7 people waiting in the doorway/next to tables including my own and none of them were asked to \"wait outside.\" \n\nI wouldn't return here with a large group - we were a party a 7 seated at a table that can only seat 6, but there was a larger table available for the entire time we were there. We were cramped, and while the food was great, not having wiggle room made this experience uncomfortable. At one point, the guy who checked me in came over with some orders and hastily moved drinking glasses out of the way, touching them at the rims, nearly spilling some, so he could practically drop the dishes on our table. Chubby Noodle offers a bottomless brunch/booze service - maybe larger tables should also be offered to accommodate such. \n\nAll the other employees were great but this ONE was a sourpuss the entire time, at least towards our party. Having worked at a high volume restaurant that caters to hundreds of guests on a daily basis, I found his behavior completely  unacceptable.

Management is better off cancelling the AYCE option because clearly they do not know how to offer it.\n\nI was part of a group of 13? 14? and we were here for my cousin's birthday to celebrate. Her boyfriend made reservations at 2pm and we were seated separately at 2 tables which wasn't a super big deal since my cousin just bounced between tables to chill with everybody. Right off the bat, our sever was just a huge turn off. They were not super friendly and drinks come through one at a time so you can't go wild. On the other hand, there was no limit to how much food you can order so we went for 2 orders of everything and the waitress that helped us said she put one order in first and that we'll get the 2nd order when everything goes through which sounded good. \n\nFirst 45-50 minutes was us sipping our drinks while seeing only about 3 plates of food come through. From a menu with 13 items. Wtf. The smaller groups around us were able to get way more food, way more variety than our big group was. With only 90 minutes to eat, this was not going the way any usual AYCE place was going. And I know the servers were frustrated with us, too, because we kept asking them to check on the food. You have to understand, your portions are small. I'm sitting at a table with 8 people and when food comes, it's gone immediately. Pork buns only comes in 3. Chicken wings came with 5. We're starving and we were already half way through our allotted time so that's bullshit. \n\nThe group began asking any worker who came through to check on the food because it was ridiculous that it would take so long for food to come out especially for a place that does an all you can eat option. We even asked a busboy for help and we didn't know he was a busboy because there is no uniform here so all the workers are just dressed in normal clothing. Eventually our main server dude came back and told us the kitchen was swamped, that food should be out soon, and that we can't ask the busboy for help because and I quote, \"they can't do anything.\" Well, shit. Then maybe you should come around more often than just staying away from us? Eventually it was last call and that was when the server came and asked if we wanted to order anything else before they were closing, but helloooo... we didn't even get half the food we ordered. The male server told us that the waitress in the beginning just gave us double portions of everything, but no way was any of the ones we received a \"double portion.\" And if they were then I would hate to see how their regular portions were because it was skimpy af. \n\nOverall, this place really sucks. I'm not a mean person, I don't tend to grade hard at all, but this place really tested my patience. If you're going to do AYCE then please, prep yourself beforehand and anticipate a huge flow of people because for the price you're charging you need to be on top of your shit. Feeding everyone in the last 20 minutes before closing does not automatically make everything okay.

The restaurant has booths along the wall, tables in the middle of the floor with about eight bar seats. \n\nChecking out the menu, our waitress answered our questions and since it was our first time dining at here, she suggested some favorites.  With our suggestions in mind, we ordered:\n\nSzechuan Green Beans - stirred fried with garlic, ginger and oyster sauce.  Tasty, but didn't find it special compared to what I what normally get from another restaurant serving this dish.\n\nSpicy Garlic Noodles with Chubby fried chicken - egg noodles with garlic, cilantro and jalapeno.  For $5, we added the Chubby fried chicken to the dish. We requested that this not be made mild and they accommodated by not adding the jalapenos.  Six pieces of the boneless fried chicken were tossed with the noodles.  Very tasty noodle dish.\n\nKorean Pork Tacos - tortillas with chili yogurt and cucumber.  Two tacos to the order. The pork was moist and tender and the chili yogurt complemented it well.\n\nTonkatsu Ramen - braised pork, egg, bamboo, scallions and nori in a pork broth.  Tasty pork broth with a perfectly cooked egg.  The braised pork was on the lean side, so it was not moist. \n\nWe noticed that Chubby does a lot of take-out orders. The orders were constantly lining a side counter for delivery service pickups. Service was friendly, with advice for menu suggestions. The food was tasty and in general pretty good.  Service was friendly and appreciate our server for her suggestions.", "author": "Al L."}

However, the pork in the hot bun left much to be desired. I was very disappointed in this portion of the meal, it was pretty pricey to begin with but it was about half mushrooms and that is a shame. They could've used more pork especially for the price. Place was good but nothing special.", "author": "Abel A."}

The noodles were yummy as they were saucy, had a nice kick, unique sweetness, chewy texture, and was full of garlicky goodness. The chicken however, I was not a fan of at all. The chicken was incorporated with the noodles and the breading was super soggy. I understand that it will loose its crispiness but it was soggy to the point the breading was mushing off. They also use white meat chunks and it was really dry. I found myself eating the noodles and avoiding the chicken that I paid an extra $5 for. \n\nService was friendly but I don't think I will be returning.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

It's always for a special-ish occasion since it's not a cheap place to go. It's always a great time though and their garlic noodles are a personal craving so this past weekend for my girlfriend's birthday we made a reservation for 7 to try their bottomless brunch menu. I feel like I should leave two separate reviews for Chubby, because our brunch experience a complete 180 from our regular experience.\n\nFood - Good but less good than non-brunch menu. Not many vegetarian options for the vegetarian folks out there, although the kitchen did make a fresh plate of green beans without oyster sauce for my friend with food restrictions. So I guess the key is to just make a special request if you see something you want but can't have.\nDrinks - Very watered downnnnn and slow refills.\nComfort - They sat 7 of us in a booth made for 4. That's 4 skinny people. We had to squeeze 6 of us in there plus a stool at the end. What?\nAmbiance - Music was good but just way too loud to have any level of conversation.\n\nAs someone who has worked in the food service industry for over 10 years, I know how difficult it can be. The servers here were a disaster. It did not seem like any of them communicated at all in terms of who's role is to do what. It didn't seem like they had assigned tables either so oftentimes it took 5-10 mins to get anyone's attention. On top of that both food and drinks came out slow. It took some time for our servers to bring dishes out, certain orders were forgotten, and just a general vibe of unnecessary rudeness.\n\nIn my honest opinion, the brunch experience is not worth the $45. Our long lunches came out to maybe $40 a person with everyone leaving stuffed, buzzed and feeling happy. For the $60 total everyone spent this weekend, we each left Chubby Noodle feeling broke, cheated, and wanting more.", "author": "Nat E."}

My friend and I both had been hearing rave reviews from our other friends who brunch here regularly, and couldn't agree on a dinner spot the other night so thought we'd give it a go. I wanted ramen and she wanted chicken or something so we thought we'd split the difference. \n\nIt was a Sunday around 7:45 and the place was pretty dead, so we sat ourselves and then asked for recommendations when the server came by. She recommended the spicy garlic noodles, the poke, the ramen, and a handful of other starters. We ordered the first 3 along with some kimchi. To say we were underwhelmed would be putting it nicely... the spicy \"garlic\" noodles tasted nothing like garlic but only like the large chunks of jalapeno in it, and the ramen was honestly...terrible. The broth tasted like dishwater and the noodles weren't fully cooked. My friend tasted it and agreed, and when the server noticed I wasn't eating it she said maybe someone new was cooking. Well, okay... \n\nShe did ultimately take it off the bill at the end but the whole interaction was odd. The poke was great but it's honestly the only thing we ate and for a $60 dinner you could say we were pretty bummed. It's definitely a trendy vibe, they play rap music, dim the lights, and do a bottomless brunch, so I can imagine how that environment makes up for mediocre food if that's what you're into.", "author": "Lauren M."}

We also had the cauliflower and it was okay, probably wouldn't order it again. The atmosphere is awesome too. Gangster rap and a fun and lively environment.

I've been to many bottomless brunches where there were twice as many food and drink options as Chubby Noodle's. \n\nThe drinks are weak. The sangrias and the mimosas both tasted like severely watered down juice. Despite the tea's serious ginger kick, that made up for the alcohol the other two drinks did not have. The food was average for what you'd expect Chinese food but no way would I pay a la carte prices for the equivalent of regular Chinese carry out.

We were pretty pumped because this place has gotten a big hype lately and we made reservations a few weeks in advance. We get there, the decor is legit. The waiters come by and let us know how it works, which is all you can eat and drink within two hours, and they will bring out almost one of everything on the menu. They then take our drink orders, we all get either the watermelon mimosa or the sangria. It was watered down AF. They keep ice in the pitchers that they are walking around and serving with, so you just get a bunch of watered down juice pretty much. A little disappointing, BUT NO WORRIES, we are laid back. We understand you gotta hustle peeps somehow when you are serving all you can eat and drink, right? So we all switched to Sapporo, no big deal. Still loving life. Then the food starts to come out and its pretty good. I liked the Chicken Chow Mein. The servers were attentive, but SASSY with a capital ASS. Reminded me of Illana and Ru in that one episode of Broad City. Fine, again no big deal, its the city, I'm used to it. So life was dandy, and then we get the salt and pepper shrimp. There was this huge piece of what looked like white fish underneath all of the fried shrimp. All of us were hesitant to eat it, but I jokingly tell my husband to just put it in his mouth. So he does. AND ITS A RAW CHICKEN WING. He ate a piece of raw chicken wing. We ask the server if this was intentionally put on the plate and he apologizes and says no and takes it to the back of the house. We ate all that shrimp that was on top of the raw chicken wing, so we were nervous. The server comes back with NEW salt and pepper shrimp, like here betches ALL FIXED. I didn't want to eat anything else. I was waiting for Gordon Ramsey to come save me and close the damn kitchen. I asked the server how this raw piece of chicken got mixed in with the shrimp and he explained how they bread the wings and shrimp at the same flour station and it somehow ended up on our plate. I get it, but also HOW? So I was like... sir, are we going to get sick? And he was like not unless you ate it... and my husband was like, uhhhh I ate it. And the server puts a hand on his shoulder and says, \"Well, good luck buddy.\" And walked away. We still paid over $50 each for our meal. AND all six of us were all shitting our brains out later.

The restaurant was practically empty, with one other party seated, and I was waiting on two friends to come because my friend from San Jose wanted to eat here for his birthday. The guy at the bar said that I could sit down, and I said that my friends would be there 5-10 mins later, which he said was fine. Then 7 mins later, this rude waitress comes to me and tells me that \"we don't seat incomplete parties\", and we have people with reservations, so if your friends don't come in the next 5 mins, you're going to have to leave. I was already waiting there, drinking water, and I even told the guy who said I can sit that I was waiting on friends to come. Then after 10 mins, I caught the waitress's attention. She looked at her watch, and I asked the waitress if I can order.She promptly said, \"are they coming soon?\" and I said one is on a Lyft here, while the other was on the way, and it was his birthday so 5-10 more mins. She told me to just wait till my friends come to order because the food comes out really fast, but she was just giving me dirty looks the whole time and throughout the night. When my friends finally arrived 25 mins after I had been waiting, we saw her whisper to another waiter while pointing at us. The whole time we were eating, I felt uncomfortable and bad vibes, and wanted to leave asap. I would look up at times and would see her giving looks and it was not only me that noticed, but my friend as well. \n\nI understand if she would have wanted me to leave if there was a) people waiting for a table or b) an actual reservation because in the whole time I was waiting maybe two or three more tables were seated, with four empty tables by the window, and one empty one by the side. But, there was no one waiting outside, no other parties coming, so I don't see what the problem was when I did have the intent to eat here and my friends were on the way, but were delayed due to traffic. It was my friend's birthday so I didn't want to argue, I didn't give attitude back or talk to the manager about how rudely we were treated. \n\nIf you are a restaurant that is half empty, wouldn't you want customers to sit in? Your customers are the reason why your business is here, so I don't appreciate restaurants with rude employees. I'm never coming back here as the food was subpar, as it was nothing special, with small portions, and terrible customer service. That's no way to treat your customers, and I can't support any business that would make their customers feel so uncomfortable while eating by giving looks and practically kicking them out when there are available seats.\n\nAlso, when my friend checked his bank statement, the transaction showed that they had changed the overall amount, by giving themselves more tips. Save yourselves the trouble and just eat elsewhere in North Beach.", "author": "C H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-23", "description": "Finally got to do the AYCE brunch last Sunday - on the weekends Chubby Noodle does all you can eat and drink for $37/pp. You can order as many dishes as you want from their brunch menu, and you can drink as much as you want from the included drinks. These include a sangria, a mimosa, or a beer (at our time it was Sapporo).\n\nWe made reservations for 10:30 am (first reservation slot of the morning), but there weren't a lot of people when we came. To make reservations, you have to call in since they have a 90 minute limit for dining AYCE, so their reservations follow a schedule. Once seated our drink orders were taken - I went for the orange juice mimosa while my friend went for the cranberry sangria. Both drinks came decorated with a rubber ducky and gave us a good buzz during our meal. Luckily with all you can drink we were also able to stuff ourselves with the following dishes:\n\nGreen Beans: Tossed in garlic and oyster sauce, these were lip smacking delicious. Plus the green beans had a nice crunch too it... if you have to get a vegetable side dish, I'd recommend this.\n\nPeking Duck Steamed Buns (comes with 3): I dislike duck... but was curious so we ordered it. And damn, it was delicious. The duck came out piping hot but the skin was so crispy and the meat was moist and flavorful. When eating these, the steamed buns come separately, so you stuff them with the peking duck, hoisin sauce, and a little bit of green onion. Fun and delicious experience, this dish really surprised me. Keep in mind that availability is limited so be sure to ask!\n\nPork Steamed Buns (comes with 3): Similar to the Peking Duck, the steamed buns are folded like a taco with the fillings inside. The pork is very tasty, albeit there was quite a bit of fat on our portion. The shiitake mushrooms are so meaty and delicious. My only complaint with this dish is that the amount of meat in each bun was very inconsistent - in fact one of the buns had mostly mushrooms and no pork!\n\nChubby Chow Mein: This exceeded my expectations... I'm used to chow mein just being salty and fried. This had a very rich chicken flavor, which was quite appealing. Noodles had a good bite to them and it was delicious with the veggies. I recommend ordering this as a side dish!\n\nSalt and Pepper Shrimp: As others have mentioned, these were good but very typical - lightly tempura-style fried shrimp with a very garlicky flavor. They come with some chipotle aioli dipping sauce (that's my assumption) that goes well. The portion and shrimp are small so easy to share between 2 people.\n\nKung Pao Wings: Good, but I wish they were crispy! The sauce on the wings has a spicy sweetness to it that's addicting, but it's too bad the skin on the wings wasn't crispy. Otherwise it would have been perfect, like an Asian Buffalo wing.\n\nChilled Ramen: I enjoyed this - it's ramen noodles tossed with kimchi, egg, pickled cucumbers, seaweed and some kind of sweet chili sauce. Not too spicy but with a good kick, perfect on a cold day.\n\nService here is pretty solid - they're so quick at taking your orders, clearing out empty dishes, and making sure your drink is full. Heck we noticed the servers would stand on the sides watching tables (creepy but effective). I guess they understand that in a 90 minute limit, people want to keep the drinks and food going. The waiters helping us were very friendly and attentive, answering our questions and never rushing us (except when we were about to hit the 90 min limit, which is reasonable).\n\nHonestly the only reason I docked a star is because I'm not sure if we got good value out of the brunch... at $37/pp + tax/tip you're looking at spending about $90 for 2 people. Assuming the amount we drank was worth 2 drinks each, it's about $8 each dish/drink. Portion wise it's expensive, but at least we got to try a variety and it was nice having that freedom.\n\nOverall, we left happy and stuffed - heck I managed to skip lunch and dinner because of how much I ate. X_x .I was so full that if I tripped over I'd probably roll down one of the hills (figuratively speaking). It was a good experience and I might come back if I ever need to drink (and eat) myself into oblivion again.", "author": "Alyanna C."}

Let me clarify, the service staff sucks. The kitchen is amazing. The waiters are rude and act so bothered when you ask for a glass of water or if you even ask how their day is going. Not to mention, make sure when you make a reservation, you confirm the amount of people that will be there. Made a reservation for 8, 7 showed up, got charged for 8 anyway. Just a word of advice. If you want people to come back to this location I advise that you train your staff to be friendly and not dying of hangovers as they are serving your customers. And where are the ducks!?

It's ok to tell them no :) the drinks are amazing. They have seasonally flavored mimosas. The most recent one I've tried was watermelon and it was delicious.

First, the staff has a stick so far up their ass I'm sure they have headaches from it trying to a puncture a hole through the top of their skulls. There were negative vibes from the moment we walked in and everyone was in a horrible mood. We felt like a total inconvenience to everyone and the staff's attitudes were absolutely terrible and it seemed almost forced when asked if we needed anything. Mimosas were basically water and the food was average at best. Oh and on top of that on our way back to the bathroom we could see the chef eating a sandwich while cooking the food! \n\nDo yourself a favor and do not I repeat DO NOT bother with this location. The other one may be small but holy shit the staff and ambiance is a complete 180 from this place. I actually had an amazing experience at the Marina location and would recommend everyone go to that one instead if you want amazing service, drinks and food.", "author": "Jacky Z."}

A little louder than I enjoy in a restaurant except they're playing all the current hip hop jams. \n\nWe ordered the Garlic noodles, pork buns, and homemade kimchee. The garlic noodles was very mediocre. The waitress highly recommended the dish with the fried chicken option for protein. I would've opted for shrimp myself, but it sounded quite interesting. I was hoping for a crunchy element to add to the noodles. The fried chicken was a little on the dry side. They are white meat or possibly \"tenders\". Since the chicken is tossed into the noodles, they lost all the texture and became soggy. This dish was overly saucy which didn't help. \n\nThe pork buns were also ok. Didn't have a punch and had only one note of flavor. I think they should also offer to add a pork bun since the dish comes with three and we were a party of two. I ordered the kimchee to help cleanse our palate between our other savory dishes but it wasn't quite pickled enough. Wasn't sour at all! \n\nLast note. Please do not order the watermelon mimosa. I hate to waste alcohol but it just...wasn't...good. Was the food bad? No. Was it great? Not really. Service took a little while to get the check.

Despicably bad service. Watered down drinks. No food brought to us. Cutting us short before our 90 minutes. Having the audacity to charge 20% tip (no where on the menu indicated a mandatory tip, correct me if I'm wrong. I came with a party of 5 for reference). \n\nGoing to a bottomless drinks/food brunch establishment requires some preparation... you want to ensure you are hungry enough to try all the food items and make sure you are in the right state of mind to drink to your heart's content. \n\nI came on a Saturday with some friends expecting a good start to our weekend. The waitress sat us, took our drink orders, and we were promised a sampling of all their food items. Twenty minutes later and we have yet to get drinks and the only food they gave to us was their poorly pickled pickled vegetables. Our patience was overwhelmed by hunger and thirst, so we began flagging down whichever server seemed to be actually paying attention at the time for more food and drinks. \n\nOn top of this slow service, the drinks were horribly watered down. The cantaloupe \"mimosa\" tasted like pulp + water, heavy on the water. The \"sangria\" tasted like rose + water, heavy on the water. I think there's a trend here... To add insult to injury, they began calling for last call just 60 minutes into our meal. The icing on the cake was when they ran out of ice and had someone go fill up garbage bags with ice somewhere and cart it in through the FRONT of the restaurant for all of us to see. \n\nWhen we finally got our check, we were flabbergasted how bold this waitress was to add a 20% tip. I was actually impressed with how she can look us in the face and expect us to tip her 20%. \n\nWe tried to refund the tip amount- even going so far as writing a negative tip to negate the 20% and calling the restaurant, but they never refunded me the difference. Chubby Noodle, you owe me money, and I'm only asking for the tip amount (just the tip) and not the entire bill.", "author": "Sean S."}

Still, I recommend ordering almost everything you have an interest in trying; servings per order aren't large. They're also ready with pitchers to refill people's drinks. When it's nice out, they keep windows open and allow in lots of fresh breeze.\n\nThe only reasons I would reconsider bringing someone are:\n\n(1) It's pricey. The quality is good, but wow does it add up for a large table.\n(2) There's usually really loud music playing.

We were seated with no problem and our waiter was very attentive throughout our meal.\n\n+ SZECHUAN GREEN BEANS ($8): We needed greens to balance out our meal. These green beans were so savory, rich, crunchy, and popped once you bit into it so they did not feel like I was eating vegetables! These veggies are doused generously in a garlic, ginger, and oyster sauce blend perfect for munching on before your main courses arrive.\n+ CHUBBY FRIED CHICKEN ($12): There are 6 generously sized fried chicken breasts paired with a great spicy mayo sauce for dipping. The chicken was perfectly fried and a great size for splitting! \n+ SPICY GARLIC NOODLES ($11): **These noodles are very spicy! I love spicy foods, but my friend was struggling through these noodles. They are egg noodles fried in a jalapeno and cilantro blend that disguises the spice because it is not noticeably red or green in color. I loved how perfectly soft the noodles were and the spice was a great pair with our green beans and fried chicken!\n\nI had recently tried SO (related to San Tung) and got the same items and it just didn't compare.

Very heavy on scallions if you're into that. I just didn't find it to be a good value though. \n\nPass: (1) crispy cauliflower- they weren't crispy at all and you could taste whatever powder they were coated in.

After all the busy reservation and walk-in attempts, finally got to try this place out on a Sunday. (Definitely make your reservation AHEAD of time, typically no luck with walk-ins or prepare for over an hour wait and by that time, they'll be closed tyvm) Sounds like a bright idea being able to have AYCE dim sum for brunch right...... except there are a few catches. DON'T FALL FOR THE HYPE.\n\n1. Um I came here for the rubber duckies in my drink, how come they were missing on my first drink? \n2. It's $45 a pop now\n3. Menu claimed 16 dim sum items when I manually counted only 15 (where's the secret menu?)\n4. Allotted time to eat: 90 mins (nothing more)\n5. No double fisting -- well maybe it'll be helpful if you stop refilling the same drink so I can try the other 3 options (if they refilled it already and you wanted to try something else, they'll take that drink away before giving you the other options)\n6. They order everything for you by their order of choice. I'm sure if you want to replace anything else to start off with first you can but better beat them to it.\n7. \"We reserve the right to slow your roll\" -- first off maybe if y'all stop helping us make our orders first then we might get a chance to order something we actually want to eat. Secondly, maybe if you stop ordering 2-3 of the same dish that we don't care about (they quoted \"the xo rice noodle doesn't seem like a hit huh? Yeah I never tried it, I can't eat it.\"), it would not look like we have that much food on the table to make our next order cause those foods were untouched and you're capping us out b/c you see that we're still not done. \n8. Never felt so rush within a 90 min period, feels like I'm eating in a food competition and it's just constantly go go go b/c we get constant reminders of how many minutes we have left, can't even enjoy the food.\n9. Sorry to disappoint but they're all NOT (actually) dim sums... smh facepalm /)_-\n\nAlright I swear I can go on forever. Now let's move onto the food and drinks shall we? \n\nDrinks: \n- Cold tea (alcoholic): S-K-I-P. Taste disgustingggg. \n- The \"Hoang\" mimosa: aka pineapple mimosa as they like to introduce there. My first cup, too much champagne, too little pineapple. Second, too much pineapple juice too little champagne. Let's get a consistency here. \n- Jose rose sangria: JUST STICK WITH THIS ONE. Best tasting one yet. Then again I won't be surprise if these were the Costco's Kirkland's sangrias because they taste exactly the same to me. \n- Sapporo: didn't even try this one. Already know how Sapporo taste like. For you non-wine peeps out there, beer might be for you. \n\nFood:\nI'm not even gonna talk about them individually. One word: SODIUM. Two words: TOO SALTY. Three words: STOP WITH GINGER. Ok letssssss do a quick rundown. With the least hope and shocking tasting the best goes to the cucumber salad sadly (because it's the only sweet vinegary thing). Everything were overly flavored in the wrong way and c'mon stop with the gingery spin (wontons, wings). Green beans and eggplants are safe. Breakfast jook was horrible... first time having sunny side up in my jook. The kimchi stew with ramen? Let me cook you half a bag of shin ramyun with eggs and kimchi. And please don't order us 3 plates of xo rice noodles when they're those over cooked rice papers without xo sauce taste. The tacos.... it's like the Peking duck steam buns replaced by tortilla. Salt and pepper shrimp... salty so use the dipping sauce to cover it up. Fried rice.... feels like it was cooked with a bag of mixed greens and got stir fried. The dan dan mein... it's a lot of soy or oyster sauce y'all used. Have you noticed these are all not dim sums yet? \n\nTbh you're literally a block or 2 away from Chinatown from this place, just go get yourself some more authentic Chinese food for you bucks. Lastly there's only 1 restroom in the back of the kitchen so prepared to wait in a fat line for that. Also, no joke about that 90 min mark, they don't care if you paid already and you're just sitting there waiting for your friend to finish with the restroom, they're gonna boot you to wait outside.", "author": "Aly C."}

Last Saturday, June 25th, a group of my girlfriends decided to get together for a ladies brunch. We made a reservation beforehand for a party of 8 at 12:15pm. They were running behind, so we didn't get seated for about 20 minutes.\n\nThe concept is to Mix & Match from a choice of 14 dim sum items & 3 brunch drinks for 90 minutes. Price is $37 per person, no to go and no double fisting. We all stuck to the THE \"HOANG\" MIMOSA: sparkling wine and seasonal fruit, which was watermelon, but you can also choose from their JOS\u00c9 ROS\u00c9 SANGRIA: ca ros\u00e9, elderflower, cranberry and apple juice or SAPPORO: japan. They did end up giving us a shot of sake each due to the long wait, which was super sweet.\n\nsoup & porridge\n*SZECHUAN SHRIMP & PORK SOUP: char sui pork, shrimp, baby spinach, bean sprouts, chilis\n*BREAKFAST JOOK: smoked bacon, egg, chili oil, charred garlic and scallions\n\nI loved the porridge! And it was so pretty! Creamy and full of flavor. The soup broth was flavorful and light, but out of the two dishes, I enjoyed the jook a lot more.\n\nnoodles & rice\n*CHILLED RAMEN: korean chili dressing, fried egg, kimchi and pickles\n*CHUBBY CHICKEN CHOW MEIN: egg noodles and vegetables\n*SHRIMP FRIED RICE: shrimp, egg, scallion\n\nOf course you need carbs when doing bottomless mimosas! The chow mein and rice were fried nicely. I thought the noodles were more flavorful than the rice. The chilled ramen was pretty good considering I'm not a huge fan of cold noodles. Reminded me a little of the cold korean noodle dish without the vinegar element.\n\ndumplings\n*PORK WONTONS: ginger, cilantro and soy\n*SHANGHAI DUMPLINGS: chinese bbq chicken, fresh fun doe and scallions\n*STEAMED PORK BUNS: hoisin, napa cabbage, thai chilis, shittake mushrooms\n\nThe only thing I really enjoyed from this section was the pork wontons. They were moist and juicy. The shanghai dumplings didn't end up being the soup dumplings I thought they would be. They were really big and the skin was super thick. And no soup! The pork bun filling was a little dry, so I just took a bite of the insides.\n\ndim sum\n*PEKING DUCK STEAM BUN - limited availability (serves 4): peking duck, pickles, hoisin sauce and steam bun\n*SALT & PEPPER SHRIMP: shrimp, garlic, chili and cilantro\n*KUNG PAO WINGS: arbol chili, garlic and ginger \n\nYou must the the peking duck buns! It's not the traditional peking duck as the skin wasn't separated from the duck, but I loved the flavors. An order only comes with three buns, so I'm not sure why the description says it serves four. Get three orders if you are a party of 8. The rest of the items were just okay. The wings were a little too sweet for me and the shrimp wasn't as crispy as I normally like.\n\nextra\n*ORANGE SALAD: orange vinaigrette, carrots, spring mix, walnuts \n*GARLIC GREEN BEANS: wok tossed garlic, ginger, oyster sauce \n*BOK CHOY & MUSHROOMS: wok tossed, bok choy, garlic\n\nWe didn't get the orange salad, but we tried the rest of the dishes. I love green beans and these still retained a nice crunch. The bok choy and mushrooms were average. I wish they were a little more garlicky. I found them a little bland.\n\nSuper fun place for brunch. You can definitely drink and eat the afternoon away. Though I did have a wicked headache later on in the day. Maybe from the sparking wine?

The sangria was sweeter than the mimosa. I think I liked the sangria more.\n\n& the mediocre stuff:\n- Pork wontons: These were decent but not my fave.

All the tables in restaurant were reserved by the time we walked in but there were seats at the bar so we took those. It was $37 for the all you can eat menu (which is the only thing they offer there).

The garlic noodles were actually pretty spicy and my boyfriend could barely handle it - if you don't like spicy food, then maybe this isn't for you. I thought they were amazing, especially with the fried chicken added in. The Korean pork tacos were delicious, but it's a small plate - only two tacos, so if you're sharing with a group you may need to order more. Every bite was flavorful and the pork was juicy, not dry. \n\nThe cocktail list was unique with quirky names and sake based concoctions. I tried the Chubby Kitten - watermelon and nigori (which I just found out is a type of sake). There's also a few drinks that come in pitchers which is perfect for large groups.\n\nThe booth-style seating was comfortable and the service was fast.

The dishes are bold and flavorful and it's fun to try a bit of everything! Only item we didn't try was the chilled ramen, but by then we were way stuffed to finish anything new. It's only \"dim sum\" in the sense that the dishes are shared and smaller portions (though the portions add up!) and it's a totally westernized Asian fusion experience.\n\nDrinks - Even though I came in knowing drinks were included in the $37, it coincidentally fell during a \"dry weekend,\" so I didn't intend to partake. By stroke of fate (or dumb luck) I passed on the mimosa/sangria and ordered the cold tea, thinking it was literally some form of tea with ice. Turns out the cold tea didn't have wine, but it was a mixed drink with sake. Needless to say the floodgates opened shortly after. \n\nService - Since it was our first time and we wanted to try everything, our server just started bringing us dishes and they kept on coming.

The fried rice was really the highlight of the meal and had a great texture; there were pieces of char siu spread throughout. We also had the steamed pork buns which were exceptionally mediocre - mildly flavorful bbq pork mixed w/ some mushroom.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-12-11", "description": "tldr; too expensive for the low quality, but if you eat a TON then it makes sense to come here\n\nSo... mixed thoughts. Chubby Noodle is a great place for group brunch, especially if you're with a group of hungry people who can eat and drink a ton. In which case, it makes sense. But if you're with a group of people who just want to eat a normal amount of food, I don't think it makes sense to make a ton of money for mediocre food. \n\nI came here with a group of about 7. Basic concept for brunch is you have a set amount of time (1.5 hours) to eat. Everything on the menu is fair game for both food and drinks. The food is different forms of Asian fusion -- kimchi ramen bowl, lo mein, duck with steamed buns, pork buns, garlic green beans, jook, wontons, fried shrimp, wings, etc. It's on the lower quality side, but it's filling and tastes pretty solid. The servers are pros here and are great about refilling food and making the eating turnover pretty fast.\n\nSo why 3 stars? Well, ultimately, this place just doesn't make sense in my opinion for most people. It was about $60 for brunch. Like what...? I have no idea how a $37/brunch as advertised on the menu somehow ended up being $60 when we didn't order anything extra or special. Given that price, I can't in good conscience recommend this as a good brunch place unless you eat like a tank. With $60, I can get less food, but actually high quality delicious food and a drink at some other more upscale brunch places. \n\nOther minor quip -- I HATE places that get snooty about not seating you until your party arrives. I came on a rainy day and our reservation was for 10:15am. The restaurant was empty and our table was set up, and the waiter asked me to stand in the rain. Like come on... I'm not asking for food or water or anything. I'm literally asking to not stand in the rain. Given that our table is ready, I'm not sure why if one person in our party is late we need to all huddle in the rain.", "author": "Jasmine X."}

He took my brother's cell# down and told us he'd call when our table was ready. However, after about 10 minutes, he called and notified us that they were ready for us. Unfortunately, we were busy scarfing down a slice of pizza so we asked him to let the party behind us go first. When we returned(10 mins later) and as we were standing by the door, he brought over complimentary sake shots and again sincerely thanked us for waiting. \n\nWhen we were sat shortly after downing our shot, he showed us to our table and said he'd bring by yet another shot. We ordered some small dishes to share, the Spicy Garlic Noodles weren't too salty and were a bit on the spicy side(which suited me well). The Peking Duck Steam Buns were warm, fresh and juicy. The Korean Pork Tacos were succulent and also a bit on the spicy side. The small dishes are complemented well especially if you're indulging in some sake and/or beer. During our meal, we were checked in on 3 times. I can't say enough about the service here.

I tried the tacos first since it probably wouldn't taste as good later, and it was really filling! I don't have a big appetite, but I though the two tacos itself would be good enough for a whole meal for me. After having the tacos I didn't have any room for the Garlic noodles, but I already saw that coming :/ i ended up only trying a bit of the garlic noodles and it was pretty good! The portion is pretty huge too, it came in a large Chinese take out box. It's probably a large enough portion to be split into two meals for me.\n\nOverall, I probably would probably get the garlic  noodles again. I believe it was $11 for a pretty good portion and very flavorful. Although it's a little spicy for me. The tacos were also $11 I believe, for two tacos. I really like the tortilla that they use, it's different from the regular flour tortillas. The pork was pretty flavorful and also came with this orange sauce as well. The tacos were good, but I didn't think they were anything super special, so I would probably pass on that next time and try other items on the menu and get the garlic noodles again.

Definitely a trendy spot for someone who's willing to spend a little extra on a fusion dim sum brunch restaurant.", "author": "Sylvia H."}

My sister stated that the hostess will give away our table if we do not have 90% of our party here. I did not like how they will give away someone's reservation; what is the purpose of having reservation if they can give it away?????? We had 7 people, so they sat us down. The hostess or server lady wasn't that friendly, she was being pushy and was not patient enough to let us look at the menu. We sat down for 2 min, and she came here to take our order already.......what is the rush? Not sure about their customer service here. \n\nThe restaurant is clean, trendy, and has a modern rustic feel to it. The restaurant is small, so it is not good for large group. The music in here was so loud, it was hard to conversate with my family. Not good for family style - food was small portion. The food comes out very fast - maybe it was pre-made already?? Overpriced Asian fusion food. \n\nFood:\n-Steam Buns: 4/5. It contains shredded pork, napa cabbage, hoisin sauce, shitake mushroom, and Thai chilli. The bun was very soft and moist. I mostly tasted the hoisin sauce, could not taste any thai chilli. Overall it was pretty good, maybe less hoisin sauce would be better. \n\n-Spicy Garlic Noodles w/ roasted chicken: 3/5. It was meh. I could not taste any garlic at all. It was really peppery, that's what I mostly can taste.  \n\n-Kobe Beef Chow Mein: 3/5. There is barely any BEEF in this chow mein. There  were probably like 3 piece of beef in the noodle. I want more meat in this!!!! \n\n-Tonkatsu Ramen: 2/5. Saw review raving about the ramen. Not sure how is it good??? I had better tonkatsu ramen than here. Small portion, and my egg was not fully cooked - the egg white was still jelly. The soup does not taste like pork bone broth, taste like water.\n\n- Peking Duck Wrap: 4/5. It comes with lettuce, carrots, and cucumber. The peking duck was stir fired on a hot plate with chili pepper. The dipping sauce was good - I believed it is fish sauce, chilli flakes, garlic, and ginger. I don't think they roast the duck themselves, maybe a store bought peking duck.", "author": "May H."}

Chubby was bumpin' music the whole time and the waiters were dressed in costumes. Def a fun spot to kick it, but I'm not the biggest fan of the food. Some of it was good (like and Pepper Shrimp), but other food (like the pork buns) were not that great. \n\nThe bottomless drinks and food is $37 + tax & tip. There's a 90 minutes time limit, but it's unlimited eats and drinks, as the name suggests haha. One beef I had with this is that there's no option to remove the drinks pairing from the food. I wasn't planning to drink, but ended up getting charged for drink and food (despite no drinking as I had planned). Other than that, it's not a bad deal, but the food quality could be better (read: more authentic). I'm not the biggest fan of Americanized Asian food, which is the best way to summarize the type of food at Chubby.", "author": "Vasiliy M."}

There wasn't a wait which was great, we were seated right away and the hostess was really nice to explain to us about the menu. But after given the menu we waited for anyone to come by to take our order and no one came. A server kept going around us and going to the tables next to us. We were obviously ready to order and she looked at us a couple of times but never came. I waited again for her to walk by and she went straight to the table next to us, she looked at me and I made a sign that we were ready and she just walked away. So I decided to follow her to the bar and ask if where we could put in our order and told me she can get it on our table but, since I was there I just told her that I can tell her there since we were already talking.\nOur order came out pretty fast. We got the fried chicken and the pad thai.\nI really enjoyed the chicken and the sauce. It was flavorful and has a bit of a kick.\nThe pad thai though, to me, has a thicker sauce than usual or I'm used to. It almost has the thickness of a spaghetti sauce. The flavor of the pad thai was good but it didn't taste authentic. I've been to a lot of thai restaurants some better than others and you can tell if it tastes like what it suppose to or not. The pad thai here was good but it tasted very \"americanize,\" if that makes sense.\nOur experience over all was good but nothing special. \nMaybe, next time we visit we can try more things on the menu. I'm willing to give this place another try.", "author": "N D."}

With all due respect to the chefs of this establishment, I'm so fucking pissed right now. Let me set the scene: \n\nIt's April 20, 2017 and after a long day of work, I poured myself a robust glass of Pinot Noir and smoked a blunt with my friends. \n\nUpon realizing I was hungry... I did what any Normal person would do and ordered myself some grub. After browsing through the Postmates options, I settled myself on an old and trusty fave. \n\n40 minutes later my delicious food arrived: pork tacos, spicy garlic noodles, and cucumber salad, a recipe for success. First dug into the tacos, which seemed like the best fit for an appetizer. Great choice because it was delicious. Next I settled in for some spicy garlic noodles. And that's when things went wrong. \n\nHOLY FUCK - these noodles were en fuego. Now I'm not the kind of person who can't handle her heat, I usually add hot sauce to \"spicy\" foods. And I've had these spicy noodles many times before. But for some god forsaken reason, the garlic noodle to jalepe\u00f1o slice ration was about 5:1. I mean astronomical amount of jalepe\u00f1os. These noodles are so fucking hot I can't eat more than four bites without tearing up.  I'm literally writing this review during a noodle eating break. And my eyelids are sweating. \n\nThis seems like a good time to remind you that it's 4/20. Have you ever experienced the cruel cruel scenario of wanting something so badly that's right in front of you... but you know it's bad for you? Well that's me right now with these fucking noodles. \n\nTime to get myself some lip balm and a glass of water and sack up.

Overall, the meal was good, but not amazing. Tastewise, flavors are definitely more catered toward... non-traditional asian tastebuds.

Though it was tender and fell off the bone.\nChubby chicken - Reminded me of chicken tenders.. yea nothing special.\n\nDrinks: \ndont get the jose rose sangria...it taste like water.\n\nOverall i would recommend this place for socialization and less for the food.

This place is excellent--put it on your \"can't miss\" list for SF.\n\nLocation/Atmosphere: 3/5. A little crowded and cramped. It was loud inside and super busy--the tables are very close together. No idea what their Marina location is like, so I can't compare. But the Chubby Noodle definitely has a casual vibe because of how cramped the inside is, which doesn't quite match with the price point.\n\nService: 4/5. I definitely recommend calling ahead to make a reservation. When we arrived at 7 pm on a rainy weeknight, the restaurant was packed with a line. We were very thankful that we *had* called ahead. The food and drink service is quick--we never had to wait more than 10 minutes for anything. But again, because of how bustling and hectic the inside is, if we wanted to add to our order, it was difficult to flag down our server.\n\nFood and Drink: 5/5. So um, WHO CARES ABOUT ANYTHING I SAID ABOVE? Me actually. Usually I do. Usually I am a huge snob for places with the right atmosphere, and if the service peeves me off even a tiny bit, I'm all \"no way man, you lose a star for that, this is San Francisco, we deserve more.\" But you know what? I'm willing to let all of that slide for Chubby Noodle because the food was that damn good. My favorite was the pork tacos--I know it's not a traditional taco, but WOW.

My girlfriends and I went to the North Beach location on a Friday about 7:30 and waited maybe 20 minutes to get a seat (perfect amount of time to grab a beer at the bar). \n\nThe atmosphere is definitely one to consider. I personally really liked it because it had a laid back and hip vibe. Don't get me wrong, it's not a quiet place to have an intimate and romantic date. They blast hip-hop music and old school jams.\n\nSo aside from having a really cool atmosphere, the food is AWESOME. Table favorite? Definitely the chicken wings. I'm not a particular fan of chicken wings, but these somehow have a ton of flavor packed right into the breading. You could simply eat them plain and they'd be great. But the spicy sauce they serve on the side just takes them to another level. I also highly recommend the spicy garlic noodles (with a name like Chubby Noodle, you gotta get noodles right?), and the korean pork tacos (by the way, those suckers are big tacos). The tuna poke salad is pretty good, and yet of course also very expensive. The only thing I really didn't care for was the special of the day which was shrimp dumplings. It was very misleading because believe me, these were a cross between dumplings and steamed buns...just very strange and not very appetizing.\n\nAll in all I would highly highly recommend this restaurant.

Sat down and didn't see any porridge on the menu.. Come to realize that they often change their menus so a list of ramen noodles were found, but no porridge.. at alll..... \nDecided to order the Chubby Fried Chicken and Tuna Poke during their happy hour time... Didn't see a happy hour menu, so the snacks were full priced at around ~$11-$13 per dish.. The fried chicken came out piping hot and very fresh with a type of aioli sauce.. tuna Poke had a soy sauce, scallion, sesame, ginger, marinade which you pair with a fried \"asian chip\". All in all, the food was okay.. the ambiance was nice, and the music was top 40s... but unless I was stuck in that area and really wanted Americanized Asian fusion dish and top 40s music, I could pass.. Maybe next time I'll try their drinks?", "author": "Samantha W."}

They feel different too-- the Marina one is a little brighter and more bro-ey (but that's to be expected since it's the Marina). The North Beach one is a little more dimly lit with funky decor. \n\nThis time, my friend and I split a sake, fried chicken, pork buns (on their specials list), and spicy garlic noodles. Everything was excellent, but if you need to skip something, skip the chicken-- it's a bit standard and isn't thaaaat unique in my opinion. The noodles were perfectly done and are so addicting. I forgot what I got the previous time in the Marina, but any of the noodles are bomb.com. The buns though, wowza. Those were incredible. I think I inhaled mine in about 60 seconds. The pork was super tender and came with some tangy sauce and incredible toppings that I can't remember now. \n\nThis is a place that you can go to once a week for sure.

Didn't think this would be that special but it sure is! So juicy inside and tastes like some herbs on top. So good and the sauce it comes with which is comparable to an aoili chipotle mayo \n-green beans. Nothing too special compared to something you can get at any other Chinese place but if you want some veggies in your meal, it's a good thing to add since it is tasty. \n-pork rib.

We found chubby noodle, were intrigued by the four stars so walked two blocks over to indulge. Walking in, the place was packed but we grabbed one of the last two tops; in that moment, we were excited..... but those feelings quickly faded.\n\nOur (sad) meal consisted of:\n\n1) Started with the garlic green beans.... Which should be renamed \"sodium overload green beans\". Think: green beans cooked in soy sauce, with a pinch of salt and then topped with an oyster/soy sauce combo. Every bite I took I was tripling my daily sodium intake for a whopping $8.\n2) MTL got the Chilled ramen noodles. By far, the worst ramen I have had in SF. Laughable, really. The meat was rough, the broth was bland (think: rain water) and it was a small bowl for $11. \n3) Spicy garlic noodles. $10. Ill preface this by saying im from the south, I douse everything I eat in siracha and I can handle my spicy. This was just a small bowl of light-garlic extra-spicy garlic noodles. Every bite taste the same, there was nothing that stuck out and it was just.... Spicy. Not good, just spicy. So much so that you couldn't even taste any garlic. \n\nOn the way back to the car, mind you.... 3 blocks away, I threw up three times. Mostly unprocessed foods because even my stomach has standards. With Chinatown a few blocks away offering an abundance of great food at a low price point, do yourself a favor and skip this place and leave it for the white mid-west kids with no palate for good Asian food.  Even after 4 beers and a Chinese mai tai, it was still bad. \n\nWe dropped damn near $40 after tax for a less-than-mediocre meal that didn't give me a chubby, at all. \n\n2 stars because our server was nice. \n\nTip:\n-no, just....

In reality it's an ayce Chinese buffet that serves bottomless wine, mimosa, champagne and maybe one or two traditional dim sum dishes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-14", "description": "My boyfriend and I rarely ever go out to the city. We really have no reason to, our lives revolve around the East Bay. His cousin works in the city and he wanted to celebrate his birthday out there, hence how we ended up at Chubby Noodle. Now, since it was a group of guys putting this shindig together, I didn't find out where we were going until the day of. That's fine, I looked it up on Yelp...I always like to know what I'm getting myself into. My boyfriend called it \"Fat Noodle\". He swears that he told me Chubby Noodle, but why would I be looking up Fat Noodle on Yelp by myself? Anyways, that's neither here, nor there...we figured out where we were going. \n\nThere are two Chubby Noodle locations. I don't know my way around the city, therefore I have no idea where each district is located. But I do know where Broadway is and that is exactly where this restaurant is located. Parking is atrocious on a Saturday night. Driving up the hills is terrifying for people from suburbia. We ended up parking in a garage off of Columbus and taking a nice walk past the strip clubs. Hey, at least we were with another couple and had some thing to talk about on the drive back home. \n\nSo to Chubby Noodle. There were only two people in our party that had ever been there before.. There was a total of 8 people with our party. It's a dark place, intimate feeling at night. It is small, so I can see why the wait can be long during peak hours. When we arrived, everyone that worked there was really friendly. The waitress came over and asked us if we had ever been, which a majority of us said no. She went over the menu, what the popular dishes were and the specials for the night. We decided that 7 of us wanted to drink, when she suggested sake. We were trying to figure out how many sake bottles and beers to get, when she suggested a big sake bottle and two big cans of beer for us to all split. When she brought the bottle, we were all kind of in disbelief. The bottle was like two large wine bottles combined. I'm not sure what we were expecting, but I can tell you that it wasn't that bottle. She poured a round for everyone, we passed them around and poured the beer into the other glasses she brought. I believe the bottle of sake was $120 and came to about $135 with the beer. Divided by 7 people, comes out to approximately $20 per person, which isn't bad. That alcohol was more than enough for all of us. If you have a large group and want to drink sake, I would suggest the big bottle and big beer cans. \n\nWe were having a hard time deciding on what to eat because there were so many of us. I decided that we should split the table in half, two couples order what they want and the other two couples order what they wanted and then split accordingly. Our group of four ordered the fried chicken (although, they brought out two orders...we kept it because we knew we'd eat it), spicy garlic noodles, fried rice (I asked for a fried egg on the top, but it was left off) and Korean tacos. \n\nFried chicken - 5/5 so good...I could have eaten a bunch of these. The dipping sauce that they include is SO good. I could eat that all day as well. \n\nSpicy garlic noodles - 3/5 I love noodles, but I'm not a spicy person at all. I ate it because I liked it, but it was a bit of a struggle because I'm so wimpy when it comes to spiciness. My boyfriend said he didn't like that sauce that it was made with, but I liked it. The only thing I would change is the spicy factor - because I'm a weenie. \n\nFried rice - 3/5 I had read a lot about the fried rice and I was excited to try it. I just had the most amazing fried rice earlier in the week, so maybe my expectations were high. This was my least favorite dish out of the night. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't amazing. I wonder if my mind would have been changed if the fried egg was on it. \n\nKorean tacos - 5/5 I read about how people really love the tacos. I now understand because these tacos are SO GOOD! I could have eaten like a dozen of these on their own. The meat inside was so flavorful, I would come back to SF just for these tacos! \n\nSpeaking of tacos, there's a sign on the outside that says \"Tacos\". There is no indication of any noodles, chubby or not. We passed by this spot without even thinking that it was the actual restaurant we were looking for. I appreciated the 90's and '00's hip hop they played. Although, when it was getting close to closing time and they were trying to get people out of there, they started playing \"Hello\" by Adele. I know what they were doing there, get these drunk people to move along and cry about their ex's in the bar at the end of the street. I get it, when it's time to close, you want people to move along. \n\nThank you Chubby Noodle, for making our rare trip to SF on a Saturday night worth it.", "author": "Rachel S."}

Definitely not a place to go if you want authentic Chinese dim sum taste. Granted, I was not expecting super classic dim sum but some dishes actually came out quite bland. We went for the brunch in the morning to do the all you can eat and drink. We weren't feeling drinks (which were barely alcoholic) and the food came out super slow. They probably get you by taking a bit longer. You have 90 minutes to eat. It's better to come with about a group of 5-6,  we decided, so you can at least taste everything without feeling bad on wasting if you weren't feeling that particular dish.\n\nWe did enjoy the Salt & Pepper shrimp, the duck bao buns and the green beans. \n\nWe did not enjoy the shrimp fried rice and chow mein...\n\nMind you, we came SUPER hungry and were disappointed.

The Tough Titty cocktail was really interesting/intriguing (in a good way) and I almost got a second. For food we got the Spicy Garlic Noodles with chicken and the Korean Pork Tacos (both recommended to us by the waiter). I love spice, but can't handle it very well so we got the jalepenos on the side of the spicy garlic noodles and I could handle it just fine.

Our friends made a reservation for 6 and we squeezed into an incredibly small table. Half of our table was 6ft + and it was like we were eating on top of each other the booth was so small. \n\nAtmosphere - it's fun that they play music. It's just a downside that you're packed in like sardines and can't begin to get your grove on. \n\nDrinks - I tried their \"mimosa\" and \"sangria\" and both were awful. Super watered down and I have no idea what they use for sparkling wine but it's something I've never tried before. I asked for a glass of plain sparkling wine and they still have me a glass of ice with some sort of watered down \"sparkling wine\". Not a fan. The good drink was the Sapporos in a can. At least they were cold.\n\nFood - not authentic at all, but that shouldn't be what you're expecting anyway for this sort of bottomless everything spot. The buns were good and the salt and pepper shrimp. Not impressed by the chow mein, dry chicken wings, pork dumplings (very dry and tasted like cheap pork), or ramen (not at all ramen FYI). The jook was good, but they don't bring you a spoon or anything to eat it with. My friend asked for a spoon and it never came after asking twice. I finally gave up waiting and ate some of it with chopsticks and it did taste good.\n\nService - what really ruined our experience. Our server Sean blew it for no reason. He was really nice throughout our brunch and apologized several times for being a bit behind because it was so busy. We said we totally understood and no problem. We were getting along fine, until the end. He brought us our check and we all put our cards in and he took it away to run our cards. In that time another (7th) friend joined us who we were meeting up with and sat down at a random chair nearby to wait while we settled the bill. We offered him some of the chicken wings on our table half jokingly because we though they were so awful and now cold. Apparently he was hungry enough and ate 2 of them. Then the server Sean comes out of no where and says he fixed the bill, and added our 7th friend because he has to charge for everyone who's at the table within 90 minutes because it gets so crazy and they can't tell sometimes how many people are at each table and who's eating or not eating. Do you not like tips or something? WTF. You literally waited on a table of 6 people (really only built for 6 children) for 90 minutes and you think we were hiding a 7th body somewhere? He said we could talk to the manager if we wanted to dispute it and we said YES. We said we refuse to pay $37 for 2 awful chicken wings and we were shocked we were provided such bad service and he was very nice and gave us the 7th meal on the house. Thanks. We were having a great time and it was ruined by poor, narrow minded customer service. Sean should have gone to his manager and not involved us and said I'm charging that table for 6 because their friend just showed up as they are leaving. We left feeling like chicken wing thieves, when in reality we just spent a ton of money on food and drinks that costs them nothing to make. \n\nNot a fan of any aspect of this place. The best part was the cute mini rubber duckies they put in your drinks.

Fried, but not deep fried (ie not battered), and had a great mustard flavor.  The Meatball skewers were nice and juicy.  The chicken and avocado skewers were also juicy, with the addition of the avocado sauce.  Could have had a bit more kick for my tastes.

It was for my birthday and we chose the AYCE/AYCD option. The food was really good, but the service and food portioning for AYCE for such a big group was HORRIBLE. For a restaurant that's so small, with more than enough servers and only serves the same items for every table, you would think they would serve you in a timely manner. Mind you, we are given a 90 minute time limit and the server was already telling us it was last call for food before our last itemS had even been served to us. I would definitely rather have spent our $600+ elsewhere to get more authentic dim sum and probably spend way less. Two stars for the food that we got to enjoy and one of the servers who filled up our drinks after our time limit passed.", "author": "Desiree D."}

Our first couple of visits were great - attentive, warm service, delicious and exciting tapas style asian food. The food has since remained solid, though the last time we ate here the menu was a little less interesting and ambitious than it had been earlier, and it was uniformly spicy. My major beef with this place is the loud club music, which became more strident each time we visited. It's impossible to have a conversation. I get it for the brunch party atmosphere, but maybe 6pm on a Sunday evening they could tone it down for those of us who like to hear each other once in a while?

He explained the entire brunch menu to us and recommended some of his favorites for us to start off with. The pecking duck as A-MA-ZING!! IT as crispy, moist, and just delicious! The green beans, noodles, and dumplings were also some of our favorites. The bartender ( I believe his name was Julian) entertained us the entire time.

It's a beautiful street with much of the old character preserved, plenty of holiday lighting, and lots of great restaurants, including Cafe Jacqueline and Ideale. Chubby Noodle is sort of Asian fusion cuisine with a side of hip-hop soundtrack. Definitely not in your Old San Francisco tradition. But the wait staff was really nice, and the food was generally delicious. We started by splitting some of the garlic-y green beans, which were very tasty. Wine was reasonably priced and quite good. We also tried garlic noodles, which were good, but not my favorite. I had the tuna poke as an appetizer and really liked it - and I have tried quite a few poke bowls by now. Best of all was the fried chicken. Not bone-in chicken as you'd usually find at a restaurant, but more like tonkatsu-style chicken cutlets.  Absolutely delicious.

I was the first person in the restaurant and they barely paid any attention to my table. Instead they were more concerned partying with each other than doing their job. Also the music was insanely loud at 5:30pm and they refused to turn it down even though we were the only table there and we literally couldn't hear each other across the table. When I asked if they could turn it down she rolled her eyes and then of course never turned it down.", "author": "Sal H."}

Convinced it was CN because the rest of the food I ate that day wasn't out of the norm and I was used to it.

So many people tell me what a great place this is. So I went in with pretty high standards. The first time I went to Chubby Noodle was with my boyfriend. We love asian fusion food but right when we got there, we realized this is honestly not that big of a restaurant and more of a \"bar\" restaurant. The menu ( very limited) was as small and simple as an in n out menu. We ordered ramen ( priced at 16?) and some fried chicken. We were not full and the bill was already around 40 bucks. The fried chicken was more like chicken tenders and there was only 5-6 small slices for us to share. The ramen tasted funky because of the broth and we were quickly able to finish them both cause they weren't that big. We could have easily ordered more food but it would have been around 60 for two people. I am ok with that but the food didn't taste amazing so why would we order more? We finished and left and went to buy other food for the remainder of our dinner. \n\nThis place is overpriced with mediocre food and small portions. The worst kind of combination for a restaurant, right?", "author": "Eileen W."}

I love the fun atmosphere and the beautiful interior. The service was awesome and the food was great. I love their fried chicken, pork tacos and the heirloom salad - all incredibly delicious! I was also happy to see the Push Back Sauvignon Blanc was being served here, my favorite white wine. Looking forward to trying more things on the menu and will definitely come back soon.

But we ordered take out and for one thing the girl didn't let us know when the food was out she just left it on the table, we had to ask for the drink that we ordered that was supposed to come with it and then when we got home we realized the most important and expensive thing we bought wasn't even there. It was the duck lettuce wraps and all we got were the lettuce pieces so we paid $$ for a couple of pieces of lettuce.....", "author": "Joanne T."}

The noodles and soft boiled egg were perfect! The broth was tasty and pure; it was not thick or greasy. I'd would definitely order the ramen again and am excited to try other items in the menu next time.  Btw, the music they played while i was here on a Saturday afternoon were oldies pop and rockabilly; I thought a Japanese greaser was gonna show up anytime during my meal...

Walking in around 8:30 we were seated right away. While we reviewed the menu our waitress came over to take drinks orders and offer up recommendations (we've only been to the Chubby Noodle Pop-up so the menu has several new items along with the staples). We ordered the Duck Jook, Korean Pork Tacos, Japanese Meatball skewer and Calamari skewer to share. Everything was delicious but the Duck Jook and the tacos were out of this world. Duck Jook is what I want a big steamy bowl of on a rainy day. Or any kind of day really. One thing I'd like to note: After having gum surgery recently, I am unable to bite into foods presently which proves a bit difficult with tacos, burgers, sandwiches, etc which means I have to cut said items with a knife and fork (not my favorite). Upon request of a knife and fork (which makes me feel a bit ridiculous) our waitress didn't even bat an eye at this  request which I really appreciated. All of the staff we came into contact with were very attentive, accommodating and just downright friendly. Great spot, great people and delicious food! Will definitely be back to try everything else we didn't try this time around.", "author": "Emily S."}

We asked if there was any chance the music could be changed, and they said no, so we went to another place in the neighborhood. So I obviously can't review the food, but I don't think loud, misogynistic rap is advisable for a neighborhood lunch place, no matter how cool the staff wants to think they are.", "author": "Carolyn M."}
