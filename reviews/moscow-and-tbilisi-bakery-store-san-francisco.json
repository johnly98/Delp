The slightly dim, cool toned fluorescent lighting isn't really doing them any favors, but still manages to be cute. Lots of different items to choose from. The cashier was really nice helped me pick out some sweets and told me which were the most popular. I ended up getting the cherry filled donut, smoked salmon cake, strawberry & raspberry cake, and one that had chocolate mousse and vanilla custard (forgot what it was called). \n\nThe two sweet cakes were the best out of the four my boyfriend and I tried. The chocolate one was soft and had a strong, deep chocolate flavor which I loved! This did result in it completely overpowering the vanilla, and due to lack of varying textures there was nothing to carry it through. If you love chocolate, you won't mind. The strawberry/raspberry was shaped like a strawberry which is so cute. It was fruity and delicious. No complaints. The smoked salmon wasn't very enjoyable because the cucumber came off too strong and the cake on the bottom was getting stale, I should have known better than to get a fish cake so late in the day :( (6:45ish) the cherry filled donut is a bit misleading... the donut is HUGE. So fluffy. There's some cherry filling sticking out on top. But the filling only goes in about an inch into the pastry!! It's more like a cherry topped donut. Not nearly enough to be able to eat it with the whole thing! If there was more filling it would be killer. \n\nOverall, a pretty good place.", "author": "Ronita S."}

Don't get me wrong it was delicious, affordable, and humungous, yet... it didn't quite blow me away, nonetheless 100% legit! \n\nSo on a chilly last day in May I decide to drop by, tbh I might have been here before since I love all things Russian, ahem, sans POTUS, but I'm not sure if I have.

Y'know five walls and one window type of feel, but yet still not Siberia! On the left a myriad of Russian baked /fried goods. On the right side local Russian comrades reading the newspaper. Sasha greets me and I order a Beef & Cheese Piroshki, Potato Piroshki, and a cup of hot Chamomile Tea. Sasha efficiently heats up the Piroshkis and before I can say \"Hey Baby, what's your sign-ski...\" it's bagged & ready to go! As Sasha closes with \"enjoy!\" Soo Smooth lol.\n\nI find my seat, in between the macho comrades, and take a few sips of the tea before digging-in. I immediately notice how huge they are... so I cut-it in halves saving the other half for later. I start with the Beef & Cheese, then the Potato... it's ok. Good enough, but I admit not the best, ever! Maybe it makes my top 3, yet I admit the proportions are huge here! Definitely try it once if you love Piroshki! \n\nAll in all, a legit Russian bakery in the Russian neighborhood of the Richmond District, U.S.S.R.

(I've noticed, that quite a few of these eastern european food businesses in Little Russia sell outdated or old items.  So, buyer beware.)  This bakery should try to maintain an only fresh policy for baked goods, since flavor and quality diminish, with a longer shelf life.  They do offer an interesting eastern european take on pastries, cakes, cookies, and some deli items, which makes them more exotic, rather than what we are usually accustomed to in western (european) influenced bakeries.

I couldn't decide how many to purchase so I asked her how many fit in a box.  She showed me 2 different sized boxes and I chose the larger one which fit 20 piroshkies.  There were not enough meat piroshkies in the display, so she went in the back kitchen and brought back a full tray.  I purchased my 20 piroshkies ($50) and returned home.\n\nI packaged 5 for me to save and 5 for my brother to take with him when he went hunting the next day.  I left the other 10 on the table on a platter and everyone who came by that day wanted to taste them (either a whole one or a half one).  Several people who came by looked at them and said, \"what is that?  can I have one?\"  Even the people who work out frequently wanted to taste the delicious piroshky - the comment was \"I worked out today, I can eat this.\"\n\nBy the end of the day, all of the piroshkies were gone, but I still have my bag of 5 piroshkies for another day.\n\nI might have to come back here soon to purchase more piroshkies to put in the freezer....", "author": "Antonia M."}

The Russian bakery seemed like a good idea and we were prepared for something a little different.\n\nThe bakery is pretty standard with its layout and look.  Nothing too fancy, and a few display cases with huge deserts.  I ordered a giant almond cookie and my mom got the marble cake.\n\nThe almond cookie was a 7/10. It could have been more moist, but the taste was perfect and the softness was on point.  The marble cake was absolutely amazing. I would say as high as a 9/10. Very moist and soft, and you could taste all the different flavors melding together.\n\nMy one gripe is that the servings were too big, so this limited our options because we did not want to bring home half an apple turnover.", "author": "Andrew K."}

I'm not one to like things that are sickly sweet, so on our last visit, I picked out a mini challah with raisins and a piece of poppy seed cake. They were both dry but tasty. This is not food for wimpier, more pampered Americans who don't want to have to chew their food. The things I ordered are not Frenchified. This is hearty and filling and could be used as the foundation for a good, soulful, Old World meal. Or a small building.\n\nThere's a reason they put dried fruit in a lot of these pastries. Without the raisins & things, you'd clog up like that orange spout on the old container of Elmer's Glue-All that's been sitting in your junk drawer for years. But it is tasty, filling food. The challah is not like the fluffy, airy kind you might find at a local Trader Joe's. The poppy seed cake was especially flavorful--loaded with enough poppy seeds per cubic centimeter to make you fail your next few drug tests.\n\nAs they say in the old country: \"Rusev machka.

Piroshki with various fillings are each $2.50. The khachapuri are $5. The pastry aren't dinky little things either.

To clarify, the only things I've noticed that seem a bit expensive are their full sized cakes which hover around $30. All things considered however, this price actually seems quite fair. I have not ordered one of the full sized cakes yet (in a month I am planning to for my boyfriend's birthday), but I have tried their mini cakes and they are all quite delicious, so I imagine the large versions follow suit.\n\nOn top of the flavor, these are some of the most beautiful and artfully executed cakes I've observed in the city. They appear to use special pans or molds to give the mini cakes interesting, solidly-structured shapes and make use of a variety of ingredients for decoration. Among these are typical cake accessories like striped chocolate shaving pipettes, but also more uncommon adornments like small garnishes of brightly-colored fruit gels. They also use traditional decorating ingredients creatively, like a cake I observed where they created a lace or wallpaper-like design in tangerine colored powdered sugar. The flavors of these cakes also demonstrate culinary finesse, from tart cherry with white chocolate, to coconut marshmallow with lychee gel.\n\nWhat I initially sought this place out for (and what continues to bring me back) however, are the amazing piroshki. For $2.50 each you get a 6-7 inch flash-fried golden, fluffy bread pocket filled with one of five types of ingredients that weighs in at nearly a quarter of a pound. What a deal! When I started going here I was a vegetarian and would always get the potato (think savory, beautifully seasoned smashed potato filling) and cabbage (peppered, slightly tart, slightly sweet kraut-style cabbage filling), which are still my favorites. The mushroom one might make a good veg breakfast as it has egg and green onion as well. Tried the beef one the other day - amazing! If you like philly steak you should give it a try. Tried the cheese one too and it was ok...similar to a giant mozzarella stick.\n\nDon't be put off by the serious-acting staff...they are not giving you attitude, they are being normal Eastern Europeans :)\nCheck them out!!", "author": "Astrid E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-02", "description": "Ever since checking out Piroshky Piroshky up in Seattle, I've been curious to find where you can get a good piroshki in or near SF.  The only problem?  Not too familiar with where to go around here!  Finding a decent Japanese or Chinese restaurant is easy enough, but I have no idea where the best Russian bakeries are at.  So after walking by Moscow and Tbilisi countless times, I figured they would be as good of a place as any to start with (their four star average doesn't hurt either).\n\nWith about a half dozen different options available, I ended up going with two to try - meat and potato (also saw cheese, cabbage, and mushroom available as well).  The breading for both was super soft, and I liked how there was a slight crispiness to the outside.  Neither was bursting with filling, but that was probably a good thing.  Both were very flavorful - the meat one was seasoned nicely and didn't seem noticeably oily, while the potato one had a nice mix of spice to it.  To be honest, I'm not really sure how to best describe the potato one's flavor, but it was pretty good and not as starchy as I would have imagined.  Between the two, I definitely thought the meat one was better (I'm a guy, so no shocker there).\n\nThe one thing that I didn't really care for though was seeing how much oil the brown bag they gave me had soaked up by the time I got home.  It's not something that I fault them for since it's inevitable with piroshkis no matter where you go, just that it's something I'd rather not see.  For me, it's one of those things where I already know it, so I don't really want/need to be reminded of it.  On the flip side though, it's actually a good thing since it's that much less oil you'll end up consuming and it shows it's still fresh enough that the oil hasn't congealed.  Yum!  Haha.\n\nAs far as their prices, it's really reasonable, as the piroshkis run for only $2 a pop.  Considering that they each measure out to about a foot in length, we're talking about a pretty good value.   I'm still on the search for more piroshki joints, but good to know it's off to a decent start (I'll keep you posted Alesia T.!).", "author": "Mike L."}

Chocolate cake is always good, very rich and dense (BF really likes it, but I'm not a big choco fan myself). We also tried the chocolate/granite looking thing, called \"potato\" I believe? It definitely not for the fainthearted. It has a really, really strong alcohol taste (rum) in it, as if the pastry chef accidentally pour a whole bottle in it. We tried it twice, it is consistently strong. I guess consistency is good. \n\nSavory goodies - We tried the stuffed eggplant and pepper. Absolutely no idea what they are, but taste really good. I believe there's cabbage and meat inside. \n\nService - Staff are very friendly and helpful.

We purchased Russian \"blintzs\" with cheese yesterday in this store. Being around here in San Francisco for about 17-18 years, I (and my wife as well) was quite shocked with the quality of their blintzes last night.  They were not just bad but plain bad - they were big time overfried with lots of heavy smelly oil (just like in old time in 90-s in Macdonalds or something) and had a bad taste as well.  There was little cheese in them as well.  Being the huge fan of anything with farmer cheese/cheese in general for my entire life, I was quite upset. Moreover, we decided to call up this store to share with the feedback, but it was plain rejected in a rude manner.  This was surprising as well - big time.  Thus, we wanted to post this feedback - to make sure others can see that. If needed, I can share my observations with the food inspection in San Francisco accordingly - to check the quality of oil (and gross/vast amounts) used.  I was told also by someone on the phone at that store that - this store is the only one that sells such blintzes with cheese.(?!?) Which was extreme arrogance as well. Is that a monopoly voice here??  Others DO sell blintzes with cheese, and they ARE MUCH better. Jee. To be honest, we just made our decision to not to go there ever again.

Great flavor. And $2 only!!!  The cheese blintzes tasted like home-made (that's a GOOD thing, as I'm remembering a russian heritage home) and only $1 each. Honestly, all of the pastries we chose were fantastic. We were on our way to a fancy-pants dinner at Aziza when we saw the sign and stopped in. Loaded up with 6 or 7 items and the total was only $9.  We each had to have at least one before going to our fancy michelin starred meal across the street.  And having the rest of the pastries the next morning in our hotel room was fantastic! This means that we bought our pastries at 8:30pm, the end of the night, and didn't eat most of them until 9am the next day. And they were still some of the best I've ever had. I can't even imagine how much more magical they must be hot and fresh from the ovens in the morning. Yowza!\n\nThe woman at the counter was very sweet.  After we'd already selected more pastries than we could reasonably eat, we noticed the third display case towards the back, full of gorgeous and delicate looking neopolitan things and other layered pretty pastries.

Both get five stars though.\n\nThe Russian side has a bunch of piroshkis for $2 each, my favorite is the meat one which has seasoned hamburger.  It's bread stuffed with a generous amount of stuff then deep fried.  They also have potato, mushroom, cheese and cabbage.  Then they have more pastries than you could possibly consume in a year, most of which are like $1.25-$1.80 ~ ballpark.\n\nNow the Georgian side, that would probably get 6 stars if I could.  I usually can't decide what to get so I end up spending at least $20 on some combination of shuba (beet/potato/carrot/smoked salmon cake with cream and dill on top),  Katchapuri (cheese pie in a pastry shell - the square one is better than the circle one but both are good), khashi (tripe and kidney fat soup, the nice lady explained that you must put salt and crushed garlic on your plate while eating this...I did and it was such good advice), borscht, carrot w/ walnuts, liver pate, and/or a few kebabs w/ hot sauce.

Moscow & Tbilisi Bakery's Piroshki is what I remember a Piroshki to be.  Much greasier (as in the brown paper bag it comes in will end up being soaked from the oil).  Don't know if it was because of that fact in particular, but honestly, these were much tastier than Gastronom's.      \n\nI tried the Cabbage and Meat Piroshkis, and they were $2 each.  The meat Piroshki from Gastronom was dry and had a shredded consistency to it. . . I was honestly utterly confused and a bit let down when I tried theirs - I didn't remember a Piroshki tasting like that at all. . .  But the one from Moscow & Tbilisi's Bakery was more flavorful and had diced onions in it.  \n\nI recommend this place if you're looking to try a Piroshki.  Next time I go there, I would love to try some of the other items like their blintzes and eclairs.  Was a bit inconvenient for me in terms of location, but if you're craving a Piroshki and have the time to stop by 20th Ave/Geary, then it'll definitely be worth your time.", "author": "Kahanalei M."}

Yah. Better than cinderellas. Here's why.\n\nThe potato piroshki is off the chiz-ain! That's \"chain\" in gangsta talk. hot, pippin warm delicious piroshkis. Some places make them, leave them in the display case all day then heat them up in the microwave and hand you the greasy, doughy pastry that is piroshki. Not here. Ovens baby. Which that in itself gives them a huge star.\n\nMy all time favorite- chebureki. Think of a thin, russian empanada. It's the best way I can explain. I've tried making it myself, my eastern european roommates, although greatfull, have since opted to us venturing out to inner richmond for these amazing treats.\n\nLast time I was surprised they had Khachapuri, which is basically just a baked, Georgian cheese bread. I'm not sure if it's something that they regularly have but it was damn good.\n\nWash it all down with some cherry juice and you're set!\n\nLet me also just say- these treats and baked good are as authentic as you can get, unless you're blessed with family to make you home-baked eastern european treats. This being said, don't let the word \"Bakery\" fool you. You won't find super sweet, fluffy cakes or cookies that are soft and gooey pillsbury-like. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Just dont set your sights on an American type bakery here.\n\nThe women working here are great with awesome suggestions. I wish you were closer though!

For $2, you get what looks like just a long piece of fried dough, but inside it is filled with yummy, savory fillings (cheese, veggie, or meat).  The cabbage inside my piroshki was tangy with a hint of sweetness, and the bread was soft, chewy and oh so good (I could just eat the dough by itself).\n\nBut if piroshkis aren't your thing, they do have many other things:  breads, cakes, apple and cherry pastries, cookies, blintzes....list goes on and on (and all range from around $1.80-$6).  I had a sweet cheese filled pastry which was good, but I thought the cheese filling was just a bit too salty.  Their apple pastries are flaky and have the right amount of gooey apple filling without being overly sweet.

Coming from Europe with everyday fresh bread, made it hard for me to get used to processed bread from Safeway. Yes, I know, that's probably the worst bread you can eat, but not knowing the city very well, that was the only bread (or that from Tradr Joes) that I tried at first. I'm also not a big fan of Sour-Dough bread, so that made my options pretty small. Soon after arrival I stopped eating bread. \n\nNow, after 4 years, I finally live in the Richmond district and must say, I'm loving it. Although Russia is not even close to where I'm from (not in distance, not in culture and not in food), I'm a big fan of their bread and it's very similar to the bread I'm used to. It's fresh, the crust is crispy and the inside super soft. Yes, the way it's supposed to be, and yes, it gets bad within a couple of days (only because it is actually fresh), but do I come here every week to buy my bread, of course! And for only $3 a loaf why wouldn't everyone go here all the time? Isn't Safeway bread $4 a loaf? Well, I'm glad not every goes here all the time, cause that means I don't have to wake up at the crack of dawn to get my fresh bread before it's sold out, but people who love bread, check this out! \n\nAnd their Piroshkis are great, I'm a fan of the ones filled with potatoes.

The left side of the store serves up the bready goods like piroshkis, cookies, breads, pastries, and more while the right side serves up at least a dozen different deli-style cold salads as well as a few meat or cheese filled items. We threw in a green bean in tomato sauce salad to make our 'meat pocket' dinner seem a little healthier. \n\nThey asked if we wanted anything heated but we brought it home and threw everything into the oven for ten minutes.

Same story with the dough... I was eating right there inside the store when after 2-3 minutes a lady brought a load of potato piroshkis. I asked politely to exchange the one with mushrooms to potato. The cashier lady who was busy with her cellphone refused despite I told her honestly that I didn't touch the second one and she saw/knew that. That's ok. No biggie.

The slices are fairly large, so one piece will be enough to slice off of for several days, unless you want to eat a lot.\n\nAnother favorite is the \"chocolate potato,\" a Russian specialty.  Like the name suggests, it's shaped like a potato, & it's basically chocolate all the way through.\n\nMost of their bread is already sliced, which means it won't keep fresh that many days.  If you can get there early to get an unsliced loaf (or order it ahead), then it will keep for longer.  All in all, a very fun place for baked goods.", "author": "Jerry R."}

I had heard that the counterpeople were as Russian as they get here, so I was surprised to see an Asian girl behind the counter.  Though perhaps she was the Kazakh girl so many of the other reviewers mentioned.  At least I didn't get a blank stare after ordering in English.  \n\nThe poppy seed rolls, having a pretty subtle flavor, went excellently with morning tea, and the mushroom pieroshkis were perfect--the breading in particular was a step up from the dull stuff you often get at delis.  It reminded me a bit of onion ring batter, and also of an unsweetened doughnut.  Delicious, but make sure you have some mustard to dip the pierogis in.

This afternoon, we got two cream horns, two strawberry napoleons, two \"bird\" cakes, two cigar cookies, two mushroom piroshkis and a few other things I think Dr. R. threw in for good measure.  I don't know why we got two of everything, we end up splitting them, but I guess this way there are extras for several days.\n\nA word about the piroshkis, they are delicious, but they have tons of oil.  If you are an oil-a-phobe or one of those \"fried-foods-never-touch-my-lips\" sorts of persons, I would suggest that you steer way clear of these puppies.  However, if you are up for the occasional fried food, you will be licking your lips and wiping your fingers after having a savory oil-fueled moment.

(Now click your heels and raise arms to the sky to do an ecstatic Georgian dance). This is not a bad place if you're hankering for piroshki or khachapuri, but I tend to mistrust their sweets - tried the Napoleon cake and it was heavy and, well, underwhelming. Go over to New World Market less than a block away on the other side of Geary - now we're talkin' Napoleon. So because of this, I haven't tried the multitudes of their other pastries. I stick with my favorites, and one of them is churchxella. Come on, say it with me: Church. Hella. Easy! Now put it together and you've got quite possibly the weirdest-looking food item ever created. These things look like a cross between a rawhide doggie chew toy and something that came from the bottom of the reject pile in a dusty back room of an adult XXX superstore around Columbus and Broadway. Y'all know what I mean. For this reason, trying them for the first time takes guts. Tip: while still inside the shop, grab the string that sticks out of one end of the churchxella and rip it out sideways. Then keep it in the brown paper baggie as you're eating it (I mean the churchxella, not the string. The string you can throw away). It's loaded with walnuts and enrobed in a thick grape jello-like coating and it is deelish. Just don't  let the uninitiated see you eat it. \"Hey baby, wanna see my churchxella? Don't be a-scared, you can take a bite...\"\n\n\n7/27/08 Stopped at the place today and found that they've raised the price of churchxella from $3.50 a, ahem, \"piece\" to $4.00.

I've just come back from there today.  I'm giving it one star because the baked goods I get there are either not always baked correctly or their goods sit on the shelf too long, getting stale, and then being sold to the public (when they should be tossed in the garbage).  I usually just get the poppyseed rolls and poppyseed cake.  Once I bought poppyseed rolls that hadn't been baked long enough. Raw dough in the center.  Today the poppyseed roll I bought was good and I've never seen so much poppyseed (usually they are very chinzy with the poppyseed -- lotsa bread, not much seed).  I also bought one poppyseed cake and one honeycake.  Half the time these items are stale.  It happened again today.  The honeycake is hard.  Hard and dry.  Perhaps they don't know how to bake honeycake (it's my first time eating their honeycake), but it felt stale to me.  I gnawed on some of it for a while and then gave up.  Hard, dry, and stale.  The Poppyseed cake was also stale.  I know what the consistency should be like and it shouldn't be dry and hard.  Why oh Why does this bakery sell products that are beyond their shelf date?  The place may have a new name, it may be cleaner, they may have installed tables and chairs so you can eat you food there, but the hardness and staleness of the baked goods continue.  I go there about once or twice a year and usually something disappoints.  Today 2 of the 3 things I bought should not have been sold to the public.

Goodbye Safeway & Baker square, you can keep all those icing and sugars ++++ for the GRINGOs. I am with a world class bakeries!!!", "author": "Norm L."}

Is it the Ocean or the hills, or the Pride Parade or the Ballet (yes to all those things, but...)? NO, it's the challah bread with poppyseeds at Moscow & Tbilisi bakery. Oy! Get it still slightly warm and it's like eating the best cake ever. Most of the time I bought it I'd just sit in my car and snarf at least 3-4 slices before I could continue my day. I've never had better Challah, even from Moishe's Bakery in NYC. Yes, the bakery is like going back to 1986 Soviet Union. The Kazakh ladies behind the counter, the general air of distracted customer service and yelling at someone in the back room, the complaining babushkas in line, the pre-made yummy borscht in plastic tubs. I'm aching just thinking about it and that I'm 600 miles away. In my opinion, if I had to choose between what's the greater SF landmark... Moscow tbilisi or the Golden Gate Bridge I'd have to pause for a few minutes to think about that one.", "author": "Regina K."}

That fried-dough filled with meat, cheese or vegetables with spices that you couldn't pinpoint was the comfort food that you could have for just a dollar as a treat after school. And then the prices started going up everywhere in San Francisco as real estate boomed. And by the time I left San Francisco, my beloved piroshkis were $3.75. Oh hell no!! I was not going to pay the amount for dough and meat anymore. Then one day in 2001,  I was strolling through the Richmond District and Freakin' Eureka... I found the Holy Piroshki and at the time it was $1.25 for a meat piroshki that was 8 inches long and delicious. Not only was the piroshki delicious but the desserts were gluttonous. No strawberry napoleon could compare with what they serve and for the price at the time which was $2.00. Unfortunately 8 years later, the price in piroshki has increased to $2.00 and the napoleon to $2.50, but both are still divine. Other goodies are the apple turnovers, the eclairs, the blintzes, and the chebureks (sp?). Yes, the food can be greasy, but it is worth it when you order it, ask them to heat it up and eat on the spot. My stomach loves it!! And you know that they are working hard all day b/c you can smell the aromas floating from the kitchen and actually see them working in the kitchen in the back. They have also now expanded to making special Russian salads. Sometimes there may be a line, but it is very well worth the wait. I even wait to come home to eat this because I cannot justify spending $4.00 plus on Piroshkis in Seattle when it tastes better at home.", "author": "Lorna D."}

I also tried a pale pastry thing that had some sour cherry and walnut filling (looked a bit like strudel, but with much, much heavier dough), and the dough tasted like stiff cardboard while completely overwhelming what little filling was in there.  The piroshki were a little better, but not much.  While it reconstituted itself pretty well in the toaster oven, achieving a nice crisp outside and doughy inside, again, the flavors were too subtle for my taste.  I found the service friendly, but very slow at the time I was there, and the overall ambiance of the bakery would not be out of place in the old Soviet Union.
