With a Yelp rating greater than 4 stars.\n\nIt must be extraordinary.\n\nIt seems Lung Fung is best known for two items: their $1.10 CHA SIU BAO, a baked BBQ pork bun, and their $0.80 DAN TAT, or egg tart.\n\nTheir baked cha siu bao (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lung-fung-bakery-san-francisco?select=lpnL0bcUD1_dvT1x83P8yA#ZsV8eI1eXKKY3TKMWGUCeA) is pretty dang good. The bread tastes eerily similar to regular white bread, so it doesn't have the sweet pineapple-bun-esque crust that I prefer (thanks for elevating my standards, Tim Ho Wan). If you get one fresh out of the oven, it'll be full of piping hot, stickily sweet sauce enveloping fatty pieces of BBQ pork. Divine.\n\nAs for the dan tat, I wasn't that impressed (though my friends liked it). We got fresh ones that were straight from the oven--burn alert! The custard is generous, creamy, and subtly sweet, and is portioned well with the amount of crust (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lung-fung-bakery-san-francisco?select=lpnL0bcUD1_dvT1x83P8yA#lDLX2KF1PownyWjiU3GFeA). But, I have gripes with their crust, which is of the typical flaky style. Lung Fung over-baked the outer edges, leaving a burnt taste with every bite. Perhaps it was just this batch, but you can definitely see the darkened edges in the picture. That easily overpowered the delicate custard taste. Also, Tai Cheong spoiled me by introducing me to a sweetened, crumbly crust style, but, don't fret, I'm basing my opinions relative to my experiences in the states.\n\nAuthentically, English isn't the strong suite here, and it's CASH ONLY. Prices are cheeeeep (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lung-fung-bakery-san-francisco?select=lpnL0bcUD1_dvT1x83P8yA#lpnL0bcUD1_dvT1x83P8yA), and there is probably a gaggle of elderly Chinese men crowding around a table playing mahjong or Chinese chess.\n\nTheir CHA SIU BAO is worth a shot; as for the DAN TAT, I'm still a Golden Gate Bakery believer.\n\nExtraordinary? I would shorten it to ordinary. But it's still pretty darn good P:", "author": "Adele F."}

But Clement Street ain't chinatown, so I feel relatively safe that jackie chan won't kick my ass when I roll my 8-4 impala through there to get me sum dim sum.\n\nLung Fung is bad ass!  My mom once got conchas and filled them with carnitas.  I was about 6 and it was the best think I ever tasted.  Well that feeling came back when I tried the Char siu bao at Lung Fung.  Take a bow, lung fung....literally, take a bao!  Most chinese bakeries use cat when they make their bao.  No lie.  Ask any gringo lady 65 or older who lives alone in the bay area.  She has probably lost at least one house cat under mysterious circumstances.  And you know where they end up.  General Cho's food processor.  The meat in these 'pork' buns is usually musky smelling and full of cartilage, fat, bone and other connective tissue.  They cover this up by pouring in too much sweet & sour sauce, ruining the whole thing.  Not Lung Fung.  Their bao is on!\n\nNow lets talk about desserts.  Their egg tart is AWESOME!  I can never go back to mamita's flan now that I've tried this.  A light, eggy custard.  More white than the typical yellow tarts you'll find in chinatown.  A little less sweet, but that's because they're not trying to hide imperfections in their baking process.  The crust is soooo light and flakey.  To my Mexican brothers who want good chinese dim sum, forget chinatown.  Roll down Clement and stop by Lung Fung.", "author": "Nacho L."}

We were greeted by the before mentioned \"nice old lady\" who knew exactly what we wanted...pork buns and egg tarts. It was kind of eerie. My girlfriend even asked if I had been here before and I assured her I had not. 10 pork buns and 5 egg tarts later we are sitting in the car ready to bite into our first pork bun and oh wow, it's like we ate a piece of Heaven. A good hamburger is my favorite food but this was right up there,by far the best pork bun I had ever had! They should try selling these things at the Giants games,can you imagine? So good we had to have another just to make sure it wasn't a mistake and ok now we want desert and that egg tart is looking pretty good too and oh wow,another piece of Heaven.

As someone who eats like a hog, I'm not only looking for good food, but the entire experience matters to a great deal. This morning I came back to Lung Fung and with a sigh of relief as there were no odd incidents to report. Not only were they open, I got to try their fresh baked bread and every bite was a heavenly treat. To me, these Chinese sweetbreads are the best and cheapest breakfast items for those who are trying to cut back on a gut busting meal so early in the morning. \n\nNow, you all know how I like them, fresh, soft and sweet! Since I already know about their best--yes the best--dan tat and coconut bread, I opted to change things up by trying their humongous red bean and custard sweetbread at 70 cents each. They both came with a layer of sugary cookie dough on top and the texture and sweetness were on point with a nice mix of crunchy-mushy consistency that had me begging for more.\n\nThe bread itself was warm and super soft with naturally sweetened red beans and thick custard fillings. The only thing I wished could be better was having more fillings inside as my treasure hunt was short lived. Contrary to my previous visits, the ambiance was a bit subdued as the chess players were still waiting for their partners to arrive. Too bad they don't make taro bread here, but I would love to come back to get another round of dan tat and to try their delicious looking coconut tarts. 4 stars for the experience.", "author": "Daniel L."}

And I love that I can speak Hoisanwa to the lady who works there and always smiles :) She's very nice. These buns are $1.10/piece. Ahn tot (custard tarts) are also delicious.", "author": "Kimberly D."}

The pineapple bun's (bo lo bao) soft, doughy texture and gently crunchy sugar topping, cocktail bun's (gai mei bao) abundantly rich, silky custard, and egg tart's (dan tat) light, flaky crust are testaments of the baker's expertise.\n\nThe enthused chatter of Chinese grandpas shuffling through newspapers and gathering around games of chess creates the atmosphere of a Chinatown transplant that only reinforces the legitimacy of Lung Fung Bakery for all your Chinese pastry needs.", "author": "Andrew M."}

Bakery from the outside doesn't look inviting (kind of dirty from the outside, bunch of old Chinese men playing mahjong on the inside and don't really care to move out of your way when you go in), but this place is fantastic.\n\nHighly suggest going between late AM and early PM.  That's when things are the most fresh.  I would say their top things are (1) BBQ Pork buns, (2) Cocktail buns, and (3) Egg tarts.\n\nThe BBQ pork buns aren't the biggest you'll find, but the bread is baked with perfect balance of browned and soft.  It's got a nice crust on the outside top and really soft and chewy as you get towards the BBQ pork.  The BBQ pork is fresh and very tasty.\n\nCocktail buns - again not the biggest you'll find but the coconut they use is very fresh.  It stands out and is delightfully tasty when you bite into the bun.  Always fresh bread too with a nice milky sweet taste.\n\nEgg tarts - very fresh and the egg tart doesn't come apart.\n\nPrices are very reasonable.", "author": "Andrew Y."}

The baked pork buns are definitely different than many places and was pretty good as well as the egg tarts that were suggested. And the service was friendly so why only 3 stars? Well, IMHO, there are slight improvements that are needed for 4 to 5 stars but I believe it is a 3+ star experience.\nThe breakdown:\nBaked pork buns were fluffy and not sticky due to the egg wash and not sugar glaze. And the pork was sliced in strips as opposed to cubits (which was traditionally done from left over BBQ pork) and there were no onions. Hence it was less sweet and a bit more salty. So this was a matter of preference.\nThe egg tart was a bit better than many in Chinatown but still has some qualities that, IMHO, trails Golden Gate Bakery. They layers are not as well defined but it seems the method is more complex than a faux puff paste. And the egg custard was not as loose/creamy.\nWhy wait in line or risk having to go to Golden Gate only to find that it is closed, when you can go here. This place has potential to meet or pass what is considered the best Chinese bakery in the city.", "author": "H C."}

I liked the texture and taste of the bread, and that it didn't have paper on the bottom (which when removed often fails to detach completely, or else takes some of the bread with it causing your filling to fall out the bottom). I didn't like that the top had been brushed with oil where other shops have a light honey glaze. They could've forgone the shine or used an egg wash if they didn't want it sugary. The pork in the filling was OK. But, the sauce was too thick and there was too much of it.\n\nI didn't experience the awesomeness that others are yelping about. It was... above average.\n\nI'm still curious about the egg tarts. But, it'll have to wait, as I won't be going out of my way to try them.", "author": "Leo G."}

No kidding, these things are awesome!  Granted, I'm more of a steamed bun kind of girl and these are baked, but they're hot, they're delicious, and get this...no, seriously...NO MSG!!!  In a BBQ pork bun!  Really!  Okay, it's possible there's a teeny tiny bit, but as someone who is very sensitive to the stuff and gets the headaches and the digestive issues shortly after consuming it (the more there is, the worse it gets), I can honestly say I couldn't tell, which means there was barely a trace, if that.  Considering that I tend to notice a high concentration of MSG in most Chinese BBQ pork dishes, it's really nice to be able to consume these with wild abandon.  \n\nSo, no MSG, great workers and I can be stuffed for well under $5 (with leftovers) - it doesn't make sense to give this spot less than 5 stars.", "author": "Sus...

Lung Fung has a smaller selection including cookies, cream horns, egg tarts, sponge cupcakes (paper wrapped cakes), and always warm baked buns.  Warm buns are much better than cold buns.

The menu is in English too.  \n\nI didn't plan on buying a BBQ pork bun but the lady who helped me asked me if I wanted one - so maybe she thinks they have excellent BBQ pork buns?  The BBQ pork bun turned out to be my favorite though red bean buns are usually my favorite.\n\n* BBQ pork bun (90 cents): Soft, warm dough surrounds a generous amount of savory pork filling and a thick, slightly sweet brown sauce.  It's nice that they don't add fillers like onions and they use decent meat that doesn't look weird and red.\n* Paper wrapped cakes: Light, not too sweet but lacking in flavor\n* Egg tarts: Shell isn't as flaky as I like, filling is a little lacking in flavor, doesn't come close to Golden Gate Bakery or even Sheng Kee\n* Ham and egg bun: The egg was very tender, came with a strip of ham, chewy wheat bun.  The bun should be softer ideally.\n* Red bean pineapple bun (70 cents): I'm disappointed they didn't have plain red bean buns.  The red bean filling was very good (strong red bean flavor) but the bun was tougher/harder than I prefer.  The pineapple topping wasn't as thick, flaky or sweet as other places - which is fine by me since I'm not a fan of pineapple topping.  My favorite red bean buns in SF are at Sweet Passion Bakery on Taraval (and they're always warm).\n\nThe bakery looks pretty old and has some seating.  It's definitely no frills.

Upon arrival, I saw a crowd of elderly Chinese men playing Chinese chess. It was a touching sight....who doesn't have a soft spot for old people? Anyways, I came here for the sole purpose of eating egg tarts (dan tat) because I found out that Golden Gate Bakery was on vacation AGAIN!! Unbelievable...\n\nI am not going to say that this is THE best egg tart I have ever had...that honor still goes to Golden Gate Bakery. But for 70 cents and for not having to dodge all the Chinese ladies with my car in Chinatown, I wouldn't mind having the egg tarts here as an alternative every now and then. The thing is, you need to bring these home and put it in your oven so you can have it warm and flaky. If you buy it at the store and eat it right away, there is a good chance you are eating a batch that is not fresh out of the oven and that does not do it justice. So, do yourself a favor and warm it up in a toaster oven at home and you'll see why some people would compare it to Golden Gate Bakery. But even after eating it warm out of my oven, the taste was a little bland. Nonetheless, I ate like 3 of them and I was satisfied. \n\nAlso, the lady there claimed that their BBQ Pork buns were REALLY good...so I gave in and purchased one.

Can we just, for a few seconds, take our hats off in applause for the owner behind the counter at Lung Fung? If ever NASA were in need of a human calculator, she would be their go-to-guy. Forget about those silly 19th century cash registers. She blows them out of the water, the way she pushes the coins (which always rest on top of the counter) back to you for change even before you give her your payment. Man...and I thought the abacus was cool. \n\nOk, onto the buns. While I don't really care for their egg custard tarts, I have to say that the rest of the buns Lung Fung makes are quite up to par. First off, the cocktail bun is good when it's warm. The coconut filling inside doesn't overpower the freshbaked aroma when it's consumed warm. Next, their BBQ pork buns are ok too. While I could do with a tad more filling, sometimes, nothing quite hits the spot like a nice, warm BBQ pork bun, with a slightly crispy top. Finally, the pineapple bun, which deserves its own paragraph.\n\nI used to think that Alex Bakery made the best p-buns because I liked their crust the most. That was until I decided that the freshbaked buns from Lung Fung outclass Alex in both departments of crusty perfection and bunny excellence. I like to rip my buns apart as I eat them. In fact, it's sorta like my own inspection test. While the day old buns from Lung Fung flunk like no other, their freshbaked ones are head of the class -- in terms of aroma and softness. But the real taste of perfection lies in the crust. The way it's lain on top of the bun and hangs over the sides in little stalagmites of crusty heaven bring a tear to my eye and a drip to my lip. Amazing. (disclaimer: I'm only talking about the freshbaked ones.)\n\nOne more thing, I've always been intrigued by the Chinese chess playing that goes on here. You'd think that these gentlemen would play in the park, but their consistency says a lot for Lung Fung and its service to the community. As they can play chess and drink coffee all day, I can watch them and eat p-bun all day. Nice.", "author": "Philip W."}

I remember Lola Addie picking up a BBQ bun for me to eat on the walk to church \"so i can concentrate on my prayers, and not on my stomach\". Like many Asian grannies, she believed that anything you do (which in this case was singing in the school choir) is done best with a satisfied tummy. Somehow the 7 block trek to St. Monica's was shorter and less dreary with a fresh-out-of-the-oven bun steaming my cheeks pink and warming my chubby little hands. On the way home, we would buy a box of assorted buns for all the 'sleepyheads' who missed mass. I would always beg Lola for a slice of the chocolate cream roll cake and after much (feigned) consideration, she always agreed to...on the condition that i saved it for dessert. (yeah, right...) \n\nFlashing back to the present, I wish there was some way to transport this tiny, nondescript bakery over to this side of the Bay. Its no frills appearance oozes with character from the Chinese geriatrics discussing the contents of their newspapers to the banter between the lady who runs the store and the bakers in back. I've tried nearly every Chinese bakery in Oakland and for some reason, I can never find baked goods as delicious as Lung Fung's. The bread is never as light , sweet  and fluffy. The ratios of meat to bread is always disproportionate, and the people serving your order are never as nice as the short haired lady who is queen of this little slice of heaven. \n\nThe last time i stopped in (which was in '02) was to buy a box of goodies to take back to the dorms. She totally remembered me and said (in clipped English)  that i \"was so big now\" and asked how my grandmother was. I told her she passed away and she looked sad and gave me a slice of chocolate roll cream cake as if in my Lola's honor. Its an absurdly small and seemingly insignificant gesture, but its the heartfelt kind that comes with small businesses that know and appreciate their loyal customers. I haven't been back in years, and writing this post makes me nostalgic for its yummyness. \n\nHere are my Top 10 Recomendations:\n\nBBQ Pork Bun (baked, not steamed)\nHam and Egg bun-- eggs so perfectly fluffy, its amazing\nHam and Corn bun-- werid combo, i know but it just WORKS...\nCocktail bun-- simple, sweet, delicious\nChicken pie-- its like a mini-chicken pot pie with peas and carrots\nBeef Curry Horn-- ground beef & onions in a green curry. YUM!\nPineapple bun\nHam and onion bun\nCream rolls (served as a log or in slices) Choco is my fave, but there is vanilla and strawberry too.\nEgg tarts-- not to heavy, just right with the creamy", "author": "Kris R."}

Whenever I crave for baked BBQ pork buns, I drive across the bay to fulfill my craving. Growing up in Vancouver, Canada, I used to think that Newtown Bakery had the best BBQ pork buns but Lung Fung supersedes this place! I prefer the baked buns over steamed ones and appreciate that it's not as fatty as other bakeries. The lady behind the counter is very nice and usually will round off your tab by asking if you'd like to thrown in another bun for a few cents more. These warm buns are so popular that sometimes they have a limited supply and you will not be able to get the quantity desired. It will only make you appreciate every bite till the last crumb.", "author": "Carmina B."}

BBQ Pork Buns?  I've had better and bigger.  The meat was also a little overly sweet with more sauce than actual solid pork chunks.  Those who say the egg tarts are better than Golden Gates gotta get yourselves some new taste buds cuz these egg tarts were total duds!  The tarts didn't have much eggy custardy flavor, and had a mushy crust.  I wouldn't ever eat them here again.  Gold Gate Egg Tarts are LEAGUES better than these.  They shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath!  The Pineapple buns? Not enough crusty goodness up top and not much buttery flavor.  The only thing I'd come back here for is the Chicken Tail Buns.  Those had a very nice rich filling and didn't have too much coarse overpowering coconut shreds like many other places.  Plus there's not too much extra bread at the ends like some places.  Other folks might like the coconut but I don't so I find these Chicken Tail buns to be quite good.
