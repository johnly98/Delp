This wasn't something we were told at booking or even when I went to get a key to access the executive lounge, and we went down to have our snacks and sips only to be told we needed a voucher.  So, I went to the front desk, and asked for the voucher; this was NOTHING like the executive lounge, it was a choice of one appetizer and 2 drinks.  That wasn't enough to fill the bellies and hold everyone over until dinner, so we ordered food; mac n cheese (tasted like old freezer burn) and french onion soup (flavorless and room temp), the bill was $18.00 for what was likely the worst choices on the menu. \n\nThe appetizers were hard, room temp chicken wings.\n\nSave yourself the time and money, go elsewhere.", "author": "Lynnette F."}

The food was approaching palatable, but bland, definitely not worth it this price point. The quality was comparable to a mid-end chain restaurant like Cheesecake Factory or Olive Garden. With many great restaurants in Jackson Square, it's hard to imagine picking 750 over the other options so close by. I had the salmon, which was not overdone, still tender and soft but not very fresh. The sauce was really rich, because what doesn't taste decent smothered in heavy cream? I thought it'd come in a bed of vegetables given the description but instead it came in a heavy, mushy risotto with only 3 brussel sprouts cut in half and miniscule cubes of squash. \n\nThe host was a little short when asking if we had a reservation (we did) though it wouldn't have mattered since there was no one else there. The server seemed nice enough and made a round on checking in to refill water. Food service was slow considering there weren't that many other people dining. As for the ambiance, the booths were comfortable but had weird pillows. The lighting was a touch bright for bar/restaurant. The main ambiance killer was Fox News was playing on all of the TVs in the background. \n\nOverall, there's nothing special about this restaurant. I hate to give a one star but most of my experience from the ambiance, service, and food quality falls short of what I'd expect at the price point so I wouldn't come back.", "author": "Truc N."}

I honestly have never had food this bad before at a restaurant.  Being that the dishes on the menu are overpriced, I was expecting so much more, but was sadly disappointed.  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the special for the night which was a lobster macaroni dish and I ordered an asparagus risotto with chicken.  When the lobster macaroni came out, I immediately noticed the burnt cheese/crumbs on top of the macaroni and thought the dish was overdone and was going to be burning hot.  Sadly, when I dug in, the inside was cold while the outside was slightly warm.  My bf sent his dish back telling them it was cold.  Next thing you know, it came back out hot as hell as though someone had just quickly nuked it in the microwave.  The dish was bland, and very greasy with a whole puddle of what looked like oil at the bottom of the bowl.  All I could taste was oil.  They call this their SPECIAL?  Special my ass.  \n\nMy dish took a while before it came out way after my bf's and this one was just as gross.  The chicken was steaming hot, but the asparagus risotto and veggies on the side were cold!  I didn't even bother asking them to heat up the risotto after seeing how they nuked the lobster macaroni in the microwave.  My dish lacked flavor as well and also had a pool of what looked like oil at the bottom of the plate.  Plus, the staff just seemed as though they didn't give a flying eff about the food or customer service.  They seemed as though they were just there to make a paycheck.  Needless to say, both dishes were nasty and we only took a couple of bites and left hungry.  At least the staff asked if we wanted to go boxes for the food.  Umm...  no thanks.  I would not give the food to a homeless person.  I don't want to kill anybody with the food.\n\nWe left the place starving and decided to head out to another restaurant just within walking distance.  We filled our bellies up with real food and not overpriced microwaved crap.  If you value your life and money, don't eat here!  You're better off going to a fast food joint.  The food will be greasy/oily, but at least it'll taste better and you'll save money.", "author": "Mon S."}

This was my favorite, I should have eaten more of it. It was cooked very well, seasoned well, and was very tender. \n-Make-your-own-omlettes - tell the guy what you want inside, he makes it for you! Everyone gave a standing ovation. \n-Crab cakes were hand-made, which was yummy. These were a popular item of the buffet, everyone kept waiting for them to come out!\n-Chicken Picatta was good. I liked the flavor, and this item was one of the better ones.\n\nThings to hold off on:\n-Chinese food. The batch I ate seemed to be sitting there for a while. I did try the fried rice later on, and it was okay. Nothing to write home about though.\n\nService didn't seem quite there, they didn't seem to know when to take plates away or when to give us the bill.

You sir, were the only staff in the front of the house that was worth a penny. \n\nApparently, they only had two bussers, which turned into one and two bussers called in sick. But seriously, you have a BallRoom with four scheduled and a five hour brunch? What, did you just get out of Hospitality Management at SF City College?\n\n0 Stars for the servers, both the girls and both the guys. Shame on all of you for not being proper servers, owning and taking responsibility for your tables and for letting customers walk away cause you were too busy walking around aimlessly waiting for bussers to do work for you - and they never came - and your customers left.\n\nIt was entertaining at some level to watch them walk around and do nothing for the 2 1/2 hours i was inside. The servers were apparently too good to actually do anything which they relied ont he non-existent bussers to do. The entire server staff of four that I saw were worthless across the Board. \n\nIt was even more ridiculous when I guess someone called in MANAGERS fromvarious floors and departments for reinforcements. The one lady was okay, but generally they seemed annoyed and blind to the stack and stacks of dishes that were all over the place and tables a mess. OR they were too \"high up\" on the ladder to actually do anything like clear a table with a large tray, bring out some linens and silverware and pour water!\n\nPeople were waiting and waiting and waiting. GOOD LORD, there was even a group of three smoking hott blondes waiting to get in....and families with children...you could not set up a table for them, really? \n\nAs for me, due to Open Table, I got a guaranteed reservation and I dropped my Paltinium Hilton card when I walked in so I waited like no more than 5 minutes from the time I walked up and got my champagne and was immediately seated - \n\nAs I walked by all those poor people that had been waiting forever (lots of them with hungry children for Easter), I got the \"WHO THE HELL IS THAT GUY LOOK\" and I so wanted to take them all in with me. Selfishly, I had a great time. But the ambiance created by the stacking dirty dishes around me, confused staff and pissed off customers in every direction, was too much.  \n\nWhoever is in charge, the GM or the actual owner of the \"750\" needs to watch the video taped from the lobby and from the ballroom for Sunday Easter Brunch. I personnaly counted 93 people that left at one point of another, which would have been like $5,580 in sales (at $60 brunch price per person).\n\nDAMN HILTON CHINATOWN, you must really not care about the customers in order to flush 6 grande down the toilet on a Sunday. it is really hard to perform this bad, but this NEVER would have happened at a Mariott or other brand hotel. \nYou owe apologies to the families and children that waited for a brand promise that never came. \n\nBut at some level, there is some justice in the world. \nYour moron servers set a table for 14 and opened and poured a case of champagne that went totally flat on a table.

We were greeted by Mimi, and another gentleman.  Mimi was very nice- like she could be your buddy (quoting my husband's words).  The selection for the day was good.  I particularly like the salad with salmon, and the choices of dressing.  There were 3 main entrees:  seafood (tilapia with salmon, topped with shrimp; baked), chicken (teriyaki, I think) and beef (I didn't try bec I don't usually eat beef - though, hubby said it was salty and chewy).  There were several other hot dishes, such as Fried Rice, Noodles, Mixed Veggies, and Pasta.\nThere was also a sandwich bar- deli meats, veggies, and choice of sliced bread.  Two soups, and a small selection of desserts.  Not a bad experience for a weekday lunch.  We were in and out within the hour.  I will definitely suggest this to our managers- sometimes he just doesn't know where to take out of town managers.  This place is perfect since there are so much options.", "author": "Margaret W."}

My friends had a groupon deal but my BF and I didn't. Apparently the hotel will validate parking for 2 hours if you dine. That was enough to get us to go. The normal price is pretty good already. $39 for an adult including champagne. That is a steal, especially if you are with a large party that drinks! We set up a reservation easily and were seated promptly (table for 6). The buffet spread was quite impressive: pastry, granola and jook station, cereal, fruit, scrambled eggs/bacon/sausage/waffles, omelet station, cold bar (shrimp/steamed mussels), dessert spread and the best station....PRIME RIB station. Of course I went for the prime rib first before any other station. It was succulent, juicy, moist, flavorful and best part. I got to put on my own amount of au jus. Every station is pretty good. Unlimited champagne and OJ made it a hit for us. \n\n$40/per person, live jazz, 2 hours validation in garage, PRIME RIB, fast efficient service.

Reservations at 8pm, seated promptly. A+ so far. \n\nWaiter greeted us (never gave his name, had to see it on his name tag) asked us how is our nice, small chit chat, gave him our order (valentines day special filet mignon and lobster tail): one rare, one medium rare) simple right? \n\nMaybe 10 mins goes by, another couple gets seated next to us, we exchange \"hi's\" and thats it.

Us? nothing so far.. interesting. \n\nFlag down our waiter, ask him for some bread, maybe 5 mins later he brings us our \"valentines day special champagne\".. 5 mins after that the bread. whatever.\n\nEnjoying the champagne, and I see that the couple who sat after us gets their valentines day meals. intertesting.. the gf and I look at each other, and we both look for the waiter. \n\n(maybe) 15 mins go by, hoping the next time we see our waiter pop out its with our food. nope. nothing. having alcohol + being mad = disaster. \n\nso pissed off and in a bad mood and its valentines day, totally sucks.. so finally we decide to flag the waiter, mention to him that the people next to us got their food (and finished it) and we were wondering about ours. so he leaves and says he will check on it.\n\n10 seconds later out food arrives, how convenient. well whatever, try to enjoy it right? wrong.. cut into the filet mignon..  well done.. great..  too much for one night so, flag the waiter, told him about the mignon, how unhappy we were and to box the \"valentines day special cake\" and the check. He says sorry and that he will take care of it or whatever. comes back and gave us a discount. Very buzzed at this point and VERY pissed, I decided to leave the exact amount.

It was in the hotel we were staying at, and we had a cranky three year old with us.  Venturing out to find something else was just not in the cards.\n\nI wish we would have gone somewhere else.  My husband ordered steak, I ordered the lobster ravioli.  I may be so scarred by the meal I was delivered that not only will I never eat here again, but I may never order lobster ravioli again either.\n\nThe main failures in my meal:  Cold.  I'm not talking warm, or even a little warm-cold.  Cold, cold.  Disgustingly cold.  My ravioli was HARD, like it had not been cooked at all.  The lobster inside was cold and flavorless.  The sauce on the plate with the mushrooms tasted like packaged gravy.  Funky flavor, and not enjoyable at all.  I took one bite and pushed the plate away.  My husband asked them to take the food back and the waiter said he would have them make a new plate [of the same thing].  There is no way that warm or hot this meal would be any better.  It was just nasty.  I was so put off that I didn't want anything else to eat after it.\n\nThe waiter [though, nice] came back a couple minutes later and said, \"The chef, he says that the ravioli is meant to be that way... it is supposed to be tender... and um.. the lobster is cooked\".  I said \"That wasn't the problem.  The ravioli was very HARD, not tender, and the whole plate of food was cold.  That was the problem\".  He said sorry and that he would replace it with anything else for me.  I told him again, I couldn't eat anything.  It really just put me off of the whole meal.  And geez... if the chef says that the way I received my meal is the intended way to eat it, they need to hire a new chef.  That meal was unacceptable.  Inedible, really.\n\nMy husband ordered dessert after he finished his meal [which he was okay with] because it was our daughter's birthday, and by that point I decided to see if the dessert could redeem them.  Nope.  FROZEN, flavorless \"pudding\" aka creme brulee with an extremely thin layer of sugar on top.  Fail, Seven Fifty.  Overall, complete fail.", "author": "Madeleine D."}

Breakfast cost was $39 pp, that came with live jazz band, bottomless champagne and breakfast. I'm a bit on the fence whether the cost was really worth it. The food was mediocre, if not sub-par, the standard breakfast items were okay, nothing outstanding, the roast beef and other entree-lunch dishes were hit or miss. Notable the roast beef and chicken picatta were notably good. \n\nMy other major complaint is that service is rather slow... The waiters took a good while to clear our plates when we went up for seconds. I guess I'm used to Vegas-style buffets where servers are courteous and immediately clear your table at your convenience. During our breakfast, we often found our table with stacks of plates due to lack of servers working. \n\nBottomless champagne was good considering it was included in our price.

At this point, the room usually falls silent.  Then, the financial district hotel names start popping, \"Hyatt?  Omni?  Mandarin?\"  This restaurant is located at the former Holiday Inn Financial District, which sits on the border between Chinatown and the Financial District on Kearny Street (their neighbors are predominantly Chinese businesses).  On one weekday morning, I chose this place because a) the atmosphere is nicer than those Chinatown bakeries (quieter and relaxed) and b) the service is very good (continuous checking of coffee cups and juice glass).  I opted for the full breakfast buffet ($21.00) versus the continental breakfast buffet ($16.00).  Both options come with coffee, tea, and/or milk.  This is much nicer than the previous 2nd floor setup where the food stations remind you of a Fresh Choice experience.  Now, they arrange two long tables, one behind the hostess' station with the hot foods and one in the rear area of the adjoining bar with the continental offerings (pastries, cereals, etc.).\nSince I was here for the meeting, not so much for the culinary experience, I took portions of scrambled eggs, bacon (thick slices, cooked well done, the way I like it), sausages, smoked salmon, diced breakfast potatoes, and some fruit.  I asked the waiter for a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice which was very refreshing.  I chose this option as it is a better buy than the ala carte items that range from $12.00 to $15.00 per entree.\nThey gave me the tiny ketchup and Tabasco sauce bottles for the potatoes; I think I may need senior assistance soon as I couldn't open the Tabasco one.  \nAs we finished our breakfast, I noticed the staff preparing a few tables for parties of fifteen or more, likely for office business lunches.  Would I come back?  Yes, if it for a similar type meeting, but, for an everyday meal, I'd likely eat a block or two uphill from here.  They serve lunch and dinner too, but, given the numerous other options, I would probably dine elsewhere unless I heard something spectactular about the chef or menu here.\nThe meeting went well as it was a) informative, b) fact clarifying, and c) useful.

I came here with my sisters on a Monday and it was not busy at all ( president's day). We were seated immediately and the hostess gave us a choice to sit anywhere we liked. We sat right in front of the food, of course! I was excited to come here because I looked at their daily menu for Monday's and I ready on their website that they will be serving grilled chicken with lavender Demi glace and grilled top sirloin steak with Zinfandel reduction.  I got in line and skipped the salad and saw seafood pasta.  I got a little bit of everything just to try such as their fried rice, roasted potatoes, rice noodles with veggies, cous cous, Mongolian beef, salmon, turkey and cheese sliders and more.  I was very disappointed with their selection. My question is where is my top sirloin steak?? Was it the Mongolian beef they were serving? The salmon was way overcooked and the beef was fried? It was crispy for some reason. After a plate of that food, I didn't want to eat any more so I just stayed with their fruits and it was sweet and juicy. I looked over their dessert section and got super excited when I saw mini red velvet cupcakes. My sister and I took most of them but were disappointed after the first bite. All of their cupcakes were hard-not moist at all. I think they were one day old and they decided to serve that to their guests. Their cheesecake were decent.  \nIf it wasn't for their service, this place would deserve one star. Their waitstaff were attentive.  They asked to take my plate when i was done with my food and when I asked for another fork, he handed the fork to in a matter of time.  Overall, my experience with this place was pleasant. It's just that their food is not good at all, especially when it's in a Hilton hotel in Chinatown. Seems like they were creating the food to be somewhat Chinese but American.", "author": "Irene L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-01-15", "description": "Now three stars doesn't mean bad, it means average. While four stars would be great, and five stars is outta this world. \n\nBar - four stars for yummy cocktails, nice cocktail waitress, and cool ambiance. The seating is comfy with lots of cushions and big red \"thrones\" to sit in, and a cozy gas fire that comes out of crushed glass, giving a \"fire and ice\" illusion.  The only reason it's not five stars is because the place is totally empty, so you can't watch people.\n\nRestaurant Ambiance - 3 stars. Not as cool as the Bar area, a little too formal, yet exposed. No sexy seating or booths to make it romantic, and too vast to make for good people watching (the only people there besides us were fat tourists from the midwest).\n\nService - 4 stars. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful. As someone else put it they were a little clumsy, but trying hard. They weren't telepathic though. \n\nFood - 3.5 stars. The food was above average actually (good fresh ingredients, well flavored), but nothing extraordinary. The portions were generous, almost too generous in some cases (such as the seafood kabob). I had a ravioli with porcini mushrooms, asiago cheese and pesto. It was pretty decent, but all the entrees were overpriced being that it is a hotel restaurant.   There was only one item on the prix fixe menu, which was a roasted chicken.  It was pretty standard, but had moroccan touches of almonds, not enough to really take it to the next level of deliciousness.\n\nWine list - 2 stars. The wine list, quite frankly, sucked. It was mostly Sonoma/Napa wines (for the tourists I presume, one of the biggest problems with California hotel wine lists) and not good Sonoma/Napa wines, but the larger vineyards, nothing \"boutique\". I'm not a wine snob, but the list was just way too small and hardly any wines by the glass. \n\nDessert - Too stuffed to eat dessert, but Anand had gotten the prix fixe meal and it came with a creme brulee like custard. It was quite delicious in fact.\n\nWould we go back? No. Not exciting or edgy enough for us, but if you are from Wisconsin and have to stay at the Hilton, you could probably eat one meal there if you didn't feel like walking a couple blocks to Yuet Lee for some Hong Kong style Chinese, or checking out dozens of Italian places in North Beach, or even the Helmand with it's fantastic Afghani food.", "author": "Darcy V."}

Crab cakes, natch! Crab claws also good as it gets. Smoked salmon was buttery and plenty of accompaniments should u choose. Prime rib was good, not great, but all u want with jus and horseradish alongside. dont try the salmon, was overroasted. Asparagus was perfect, served with the crab cakes. Spinach, served with the salmon, was ok. My dessert looked like an il fornaio muffin, cherries and lemon and succulent bread/cake. Very good and plenty sweet for me. The servers kept refilling my champagne and changing plates, all with good cheer. If you have a group of picky white food eaters this would be a stress-free option. Kids and elders in the mix seemed equally pleased. To me, the music was the highlight, they definitely noticed our interest and played to please.

Stumbling in on a chilly evening in the city, this place had the atmosphere that just felt soothing.  You are first greeted by the warmth of an open fire place right before you enter the restaurant.  Seating at this place was pretty open as it wasn't crowded at all (don't know whether that's a good thing or bad), which made it very relaxing.  For the most part, service wasn't that bad.  The hostess greeted us when we got there and took us to our table where the waiter then took over and was attentive to our needs for the most part the whole night.\n\nOn to the good stuff... I was torn with what to order as the menu had multiple dishes that I wanted to indulge myself in.  As luck would have it, the sous chef (Virgil, I believe) that night happened to be walking around and checking in on the dishes the guests were having.  We stopped him on his way back and asked if he could suggest something for us.  He asked me what I felt like and I told him that a good steak would hit the spot.  Without hesitation, he suggested that I try his \"special\" marinated rib-eye with grilled prawns.  I happily obliged and served to me was probably one of the most succulent and delicious seafood/steak dishes I have ever had.\n\nThe portions were really generous and dish itself was ooooo sooooo goooooood.  The steak and prawns were marinated and grilled to perfection.  Not one word was spoken at the table when the food was being consumed besides the occasional \"mmmmm\" (while eyes were rolling backwards).  \n\nTo top it all off, we ordered a tiramisu which was equally as good.  Wondering why we haven't had something similar to it before, we found out from the staff that the tiramisu was imported from Italy..!!!\n\nThe only thing that I have to point out is that they claim to be a Mediterranean/Greek themed restaurant but didn't really have many dishes from the culture.  \n\nThe food is good none the less so this place is definitely a personal recommendation...", "author": "Herman C."}

I don't think it's that hard to see a patron sit down and throw a menu at them...oh wait...they literally did just throw menus at us and then ran off into some corner of the restaurant where they could properly ignore us.  Then after asking the waiter to take our order...we were brushed aside bc apparently he was too busy pissing off other customers. We would have left but we were tired and just wanted a bite to eat before going back to our rooms. 20 minutes later someone finally came, took our drinks and entree order...of course they only brought 2 out of the 3 drinks (that 3rd water must have had to been pumped out of a well or something for it to take that long). We then realized a few tables around us got bread and we didn't so we asked for bread. The waiter looked at us like we were asking for one of his organs. Um no. Just bread. Like you're supposed to automatically give. Cause you know...you're our waiter...and um...this is a restaurant right?! \n\nAnyway, we eventually got that last water, bread and our entrees (which was nothing exciting - subpar food that is overpriced because they managed to have some interior designer come in to make things look fancy). I wanted to subtract tip from them but I guess it doesn't work that way. \n\nBy the way, when the table across from you is served their entrees before they even get their drinks (which causes a screamfest at the manager who of course then acts sooo apologetic), another table has to chase someone down to pay their bill, and an old man has to hobble up to the bar to get his own menu after unsuccessfully trying to get service....then I think your restaurant has a problem.
