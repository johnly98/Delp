I went to the restroom with my friend, and while in there, someone pounded on the door repeatedly, yelling because she had to pee (even though we were only in there for a couple minutes). She even walked in TWICE within the span of two minutes because the lock was broken, the second time knowing that we hadn't left yet. When we did exit the bathroom after a total of five minutes at the very maximum, she made an extremely rude comment to me, to which I replied \"chill out.\"  I thought this was pretty fair and I remained level-headed, given that she had just compromised my privacy and purposefully walked in on me pissing not once, but twice. She then proceeded to scream at me to \"get the fuck out of 'her' bar.\" I don't usually like to pass judgement, as she was clearly either extremely inebriated while on the job or having a bad day, but I don't think there's any excuse for that.", "author": "Skyler L."}

You tell me...\n\nA few years ago, the weekend after Michael Jackson died, we were partying all afternoon on my buddy's roof deck and were feeling no pain. Things were dieing down, and so we decided to head to Route 101 on a buddy's suggestion. I'm glad we did, because I could not make up what happened next.  \n\nWe walk in the bar and sure enough, \"Billy Jean\" comes on the jukebox. Out come the moonwalks, crotch grabs, and \"Hooooo!\" and \"Hee heeee!\" screams. I guess my antics were impressive because this guy, who can be best described as a pimp (for real), gave me his fedora and big black sunglasses to wear. I jumped on the couch and proceeded to show off my best MJ moves [insert crowd applause and \"woo woo!\"s here].\n\nAnyway, later on I go to order drinks at an empty space on the other side of the bar from my friends. I see some commotion down their way, but I don't know what's going on. After I get the drinks, I come back to my friends and they tell me that the young blonde girl in the summer dress, who is with the \"pimp\", suddenly attacked my friend Jim and wrestled him to the ground.\n\nI look over at her and I can see this crazy-ass look in her eyes. I set my drink on the bar, because I can sense what is coming next. She lowers a shoulder and attacks me! Now she only weighs about 100 lbs, but has a rabid wild animal type fight that explodes out of her. Pretty soon we're on the ground with a flurry of head-locks, strangle-holds, and pins. I even had her ready for the pile driver at one point with me standing and her legs over my head. Well, the bartender saw about enough and came over to break up the show. We stopped, shook hands, hugged, and toasted our drinks.\n\nWe had great fun that night and experienced a \"Hangover\" type moment the next day. During the wrestling, my girlfriend was taking photos with my camera. We looked through them and noticed a few details that we missed the night before, like the girl's bloody knees, her boobs popping out, and (ummm, how do I say this?) a string hanging out of her.\n\nAll and all it was a great evening.

Por favor, amigo m\u00edo, por favor, tomar una copa conmigo\" eL Capitan said to Eddly but since I don't speak Spanish, I have no idea what he meant. \nNext thing I knew, the bartender, the cute dark-haired, Irish bartender, set us up with another round of Pabst Blue Ribbon.\nSomeone played the Irish Rovers (or U2, not sure which as I often get those two bands confused) on the jukebox and a group of really cute (Irish?) girls start dancing. \nWell, of course they both grabbed eL Capitan by the arms and began to do \"Riverdance\" and most everyone in the bar joined in.\nIt was an epic dancehall recital with Irish Car Bombs, Irish pop music and Irish dancing. \nAt the peak of the evening, eL Capitan and the dark haired Irish bartender (the one that looks like a young Catherine Zeta-Jones) ran outside and rode off into the night on eL Capitan's vintage Norton bobber.\n\"See you on the other side\" eL Capitan yelled as they motored off towards the Bay Bridge on ramp.\n\"Guess they're goin' to Alameda\" Carmen said.\n\"Hella NO!\" Eddly said with a serious tone, \"OAKLAND!\"\n\nAfter watching them ride away, Eddly, Carmen, an Irish dancer named Stella and ME, went back inside and ordered another round of drinks and played another game of pool . . .\n\nIf you ever find yourself in the city by the bay and you are looking for a great \"dive\" bar with an awesome staff, reasonably priced drinks and awesome ambiance, get some cash and head over to ROUTE 101\n\nPS - TIP YOUR BARTENDER(S)!!!!", "author": "Dave S."}

I like it specifically because of this and the drinks are cheap. Beers are in the $3 range. There are some pool tables in the back and comfy couches. The bathroom is pretty sketchy, but what dive bar has a really clean one???", "author": "The Sock S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-10-03", "description": "so i go here a lot because it's like 2 blocks from where i work, but the one shitty thing about this place is that their draft beer usually taste like shit due to the fact that they don't clean their lines!  rule number one in my book, never ever ever compromise the integrity of beer!!!!  i hate to sound like a beer snob, and i know  i kinda' am one, but really... who wants to drink shitty tasting beer... i rest my case!\n\n\non the plus side though, i get off of work and usually head straight there on tuesdays with some friends from work and get my buzz on immediately!  another great thing about this joint is that they show every single mlb game that is on that day!  i am a ny mets fan and during the season i can watch my boys do their thing and talk mad shit about giants fans while they all drink their sorrows away!  i don't really care about the pool table in the back, but if you feel inclined to get a game going on to show what you're made of, then thats fine by me... more elbow room @ the bar for me!!!!\n\n3 out of 5 stars ain't that bad, but once again the only reason for this rating is because of the dirty ass sock tasting lines...\n\nc'mon guys, clean the fuckin' lines already!!!!\n\nsee ya' there on tuesday y'all!!!!\n\n\n\n\n***ursa major***", "author": "Michael M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-03-29", "description": "Yup - I'd say that this place falls under the 'dive' category... in a good way, of course. Pool tables and an adequate juke box. I got the feeling that we were the non-regulars at the bar, and that we were outnumbered as such. I assume that the pool tables are probably the primary draw at this place.", "author": "Tre S."}

They enjoy repeat business, customer service, all of the things that I was complaining about below...", "author": "Laura No\u00ebl S."}

As the 101 has all three, I like that place! My dog acts like she runs that bar, and nobody tells her otherwise.  Friendly people work there.  I always go there on Halloween, for some reason.", "author": "Chuck B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-02", "description": "This place has a charm that just doesn't get old. I've been here many times. Some of these times, I'm the only one there, but many times there are transient folks, all walks of life, from just about anywhere mixed in with regulars and overflow from the nightclub/party venue next door that makes for a interesting mix of people which I enjoy. You can come here by yourself and have a few beers and watch TV without feeling uncomfortable. The bartenders are really great friendly people, and the owners are the same. I'd like to see the plumbing fixed, and the couch/carpet cleaned as others have mentioned. There are a few regulars that I  tend to avoid, but some of them are great folks. I would say that this bar can get edgy more than you might expect so you have to pay attention to who you talk to sometimes, but overall I think it is a great place to grab a drink and shoot pool. Sometimes randomly you will see a rocker like Lemmy from Motorhead here.", "author": "Andrew Z."}
