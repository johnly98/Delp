The mezze platter was good and could tell the different dips were made there. The pomegranate lemonade was refreshing and nice. The tajine was okay, but reminded me of Hong Kong baked rice with pork and tomatoes hmmmmm. Palmyra on Haight seems to be a similar restaurant with different atmosphere.", "author": "Wesley K."}

Parking is a bit tricky, but if you drive around a bit you'll find a spot. \n\nThe dining aesthetic is warm and cozy, very welcoming. We dined on a Wednesday night and they weren't slammed so we got very attentive service. I can imagine they get packed on the weekends, as many people stopped in to pick up takeout. \n\nWe started with the Baba Ghanouj which had a perfect smoky eggplant flavor with olive oil and lemon juice layered in. For my entree, I went with the beef kebab and my friends both ordered the lamb having had it before and raved about it. My beef was cooked perfectly and the rice was delicious. We closed up with baklava (of course) and that was also delicious. \n\nNormally I'm a lush at dinner time but they had this amazing lemonade with pomegranate and I could stop asking for refills. \n\nThe service throughout our meal was attentive and courteous. We'll definitely be back to eat at Layaly!", "author": "Bianca B."}

And I've eaten here nearly a half dozen times over the better part of a decade. For consistency alone, I think that's an incredible feat.\n\nNot that consistency is everything. After all--you can be consistently bad right? Layalay, however, is consistently good. Maybe not phenomenal, blow-your-mind, but definitely good. I don't think they're trying to be SF's hottest new spot. On the contrary, this is a cozy, well-kept, and nice little neighborhood spot in Outer Richmond. \n\nLet's talk about a few of those things that are good then. You go with the basics, and you're not going to go wrong. The mezza platter ($15) to begin is a great option. One big platter of tzatztiki, hummus, baba ganoush, shawarma, dolmas, and loads of warm pita. It's an instant win. And, it occurs to me, could either be a meal in itself. Or, this would be a great spot for a first date you're looking to impress. You go in, grab some wine and share this appetizer, chat, fall in love, and come back on your anniversaries. It's a great plan.\n\nMoving on from your fictional first date and back to the reality of the food, I think the Layaly mixed grill plate is as solid of a choice as you're going to find. You get a few different meats (from land and sea) that were grilled, rice, and a salad. No frills, but those herbs infuse the proteins with subtle flavor you won't find elsewhere on the globe. \n\nI recently tried a couple different tagines, and am happy to report they're hearty and well-made. My latest was a sirloin/cream tagine, and it was described as \"sorta like beef strogonaff\" which, on a rainy night, is exactly what you want. Served with rice, it was piping hot, rich, and it left me warmed and stuffed.\n\nI think(?) they changed ownership sometime in the last 6-8 years, but I didn't notice much change besides staff. There used to be a server we fondly referred to as \"Demi\" for her likeness to the actress (Moore, not Lovato) but she disappeared long ago. Happily, the newer staff is just as warm and welcoming.\n\nHonestly, I cherish neighborhood spots like this. It's never crowded, never a scene, but still nice, unique, warm, and just a short walk away.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

From the atmosphere, to the wonderful service, and the good food. Layaly is a nice gem.\n\nWe had the mezza platter to start with: Hummus, baba ghanouj, tabouli, falafel,  borek and warm pita. All were very good...but the Borek (Fried filo dough stuffed with feta cheese and parsley) was like Lebanese crack...omg.\n\nFor our mains we had the: Kofte Kebab which was a mixture of ground beef and lamb, onions and fresh herbs. served with rice and vegetables. Really tender and flavorful Kebabs with fluffy light rice. \n\nLamb Kebab Entr\u00e9e marinated tender cubes of lamb skewered with onions and peppers. served with rice and vegetables. Very tender and sucullent lamb with not too much fat and cooked to perfection.\n\nDajaj chicken saut\u00e9ed with onions, peppers, mushrooms and garlic in a tomato white wine sauce. served with rice. This Tajine ( think wonderful stew) was intensly arromatic and rich. The mushrooms and chicken were out of this world. Generous portion as well.\n\nWe took home two dishes for two family members that were revolting about dinning out (typical). They had the Falafel Wrap:  falafels with hummus, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and tahini. This was the best Falafel sandwhich I have every tasted...so yummy and flavorful. They both had french fries with them  seasoned sumac.....they are the best. Crispy fries with that amazing sumac flavor. Only other place I know that does this is in Las vegas.\n\nPrices for dinning out are really reasonable. \n\nService was just fantastic. The wonderful lady that helped us always refilled our water, was super pleasant, and just super cool.\n\nOnly thing I didnt like, and it is petty, was one of the owners just hanging out playing on his cell phone.\n\nI would highly recommend checking this place out/", "author": "David G."}

Not worth $9 without the feta. They should have made it bigger for us since we didn't want the cheese. Also, it had dried cranberries and olives.

Even if I knew, it has only been in the past year have I grown to enjoy Mediterranean food. It's been my go-to when I want to eat generally healthy. \n\nIt's the night before Bay to Breakers and the hubby and I didn't want to eat anything to heavy before our race so I Yelp'd around the area and came upon Layal. I recall walking by it a few times, and one time even looking at the menu but always disregarded it. This time, I checked out the photos and it was an easy decision. [Note: This is a good sign because my husband knows I can be indecisive, and then i get hangry.] I called in to ask about the wait time for 2 and the girl who picked up the phone said there wasn't any wait but she'll put her name down since it looked like people were slowly trickling in. We weren't too far away so it worked out. \n\nWhen we arrived, there were a few parties sitting down, with much of the tables open. They sat us down and served us water immediately. On it! We took some time to glance over the menu and started off with the hummus, since everyone on here raved about it :) It was a good thing we ordered an appetizer because the kitchen was kind of slow and they were short a server. Jessica was able to get it done though, so helpful! For our entrees, we ended up ordering the Kofte Kebab (mixture of ground lamb and beef with onions and herbs, served with rice and salad) and the Bazinjan Tajine (sirloin saut\u00e9ed in a spicy garlic tomato sauce, with eggplant, onions, and bell peppers, served with a side of rice).\n\nThe hummus was excellent! So smooth and creamy with the perfect amount of flavoring. The drizzle of the olive oil on top was the perfect addition. The pita bread was so fresh and soft!! You really can't yourself from eating it. Since we had to wait a bit for our order to come out, I asked for extra bread to pass the time, and again, it came out piping hot!\n\nMy kofte kebab was delicious! When you cut the meat into bite size pieces, it may appear tough or dry, when you eat it, it's tender and juicy. They know how to do it right! I didn't want the rice and asked for extra salad, and they delivered. Half my plate was covered with fresh arugula with a sprinkle of salt. The tzatziki sauce that came with it was BOMB! Yelpers mentioned that as well. The meat was good and flavorful so I didn't really feel the need to dip too much in it. But I typically don't drench things in sauce or dressing, less is more. Hubbs enjoyed his bazinjan, it is a bit on the spicy side but the amount of spice was good enough where you can still savor and enjoy the flavors of the dish. However, to avoid any upset stomachs, we felt that he best not finish it, since he had to run in 12 hours. Lucky for him, he got to help me with my kofte. \n\nAt the end of the meal, Jessica brought us a baklava for dessert since we had to wait for our meal. What a nice gal! It was good, but it might have given me an allergic reaction. I don't have any known allergies but when I got home, I got a little itchy and was getting red dots on my body. Don't know if it was the baklava cause it has pistachios (something I'm used to eating) or the meal itself. Whatever it is, I'm willing to go back and test it out. It's that good!\n\nSo glad I discovered this quiet, cozy, almost hole-in-the-wall restaurant in the neighborhood. Can't wait to try the other items on the menu. Hopefully next time, the service will be a bit faster too.", "author": "Jenny C."}

You never know if you're being lured to a place everyone hates and getting ensnared in a meal best described as tragic, or you're about to discover a hidden gem that you would have never found on your own. Thank goodness Yelp can help you sift through the weeds to figure out your odds for culinary satisfaction. Jamie W. and I just happened to be in the mood for something new last Friday, and I saw the Groupon for Layaly in my inbox. Since Mediterranean is one of our preferred cuisines in eating healthier, I decided to go for the 57%-off deal where we could share an appetizer and dessert and each of us gets an entree for $29. We got lucky because it was really good food properly executed in a relaxing atmosphere.\n\nBut first we had to take the 38 Geary from its starting point at Main and Howard. We were already a bit apoplectic by the time we got to the Outer Richmond, but fortunately our window-side table was awaiting us. We started with their extremely creamy Hummus with warm, grilled pita wedges (normally $6.50 - see photo). Absolutely no complaints with that modest starter as it was exactly what we wanted before the magilla of entrees - the Layaly Mix Grill for Two (normally $34) - which consisted of a huge platter of kabobs, two scoops of rice and a cup of tzatziki sauce. Kofte (minced lamb), chicken, beef, lamb, and shrimp, all grilled nicely with alternating cherry tomatoes, bell peppers and red onions (see photo). A skewer of each kind for both of us, so we were headed for a carnivorous coma.\n\nAll the meats were tender and moist but with a nice char. Genuinely satisfying. For dessert, we were given the choice of a Pistachio Ice Cream or their house-made Baklava. There was no contest there, and they cut the flaky slab of gooey goodness in half for our respective indulgence (see photo). Service was quite friendly and attentive even as the dining room started to get more crowded. We were happy to receive the Groupon discount, but their more important goal was achieved. We plan on making a return visit sometime and paying the regular prices for their food. Sure, there are lots of Mediterranean places closer to home, but hey, the after-dinner stroll down Clement was nice and leisurely.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...nothing that creative here, but they can certainly know how to make hummus and kabobs\nAMBIANCE -3.5 stars...just a nice neighborhood spot with few frills but enough ethnic flavor to make you aware you're not at a Subway\nSERVICE - 4 stars...thoughtful and handled our Groupon with grace\nTOTAL - 4 stars...far-flung Mediterranean for sure, but take a Valium for your ride on the 38 and you'll be just fine", "author": "Ed U."}

Being fatasses, we decide to end with dinner at Layaly because my friend had a Scoutmob - 50% off up to $15 deal. \n\nBe forewarned that parking in the area is a complete nightmare. There is a parking lot a block away for $6/hour. \n\nOn Sunday 9.4.11, my friend and I came in a little after 6 PM and Layaly was empty except for one couple. We were seated promptly (without reservations) while we waited for two of other friends to arrive.\n\nF O O D\n*MEZZA PLATTER: w/ Hummus, Baba Ghanouj, Haydari, Tabouli, Falafel and Borek ($15) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9KeTKDuHdLMhRFku0HAIxw?select=l-aiPHAOl0jH77o_FAB4zw\nWe liked and devoured everything on the platter except the tabouli (parsley salad). The hummus and haydari (yogurt sauce) was amazingly rich and creamy. The baba ghanouj (mashed eggplant) was smooth yet still had some texture to it. The falafel had a nice crunchy exterior with a soft center and the borek (fillo stuffed with feta) was like a savory cheese egg roll. \n\nIt was served with warm pita bread which was perfect for sopping up all the yummy hummus, haydari and baba ghanouj.\n\n*LAYALY MIXED GRILL w/ Kofte, Chicken, Beef, Lamb, and Shrimp ($34 for 2 people) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9KeTKDuHdLMhRFku0HAIxw?select=xiCzw2TLqT2ga_WNAQreGQ\nEverything on the plate was packed with flavor and deliciously mouth-watering. The kofte (beef and lamb) was rich and juicy with a subtle gaminess. The beef and lamb were tender and filled with garlicky spices. The shrimp was nicely tender. The chicken, being white pieces was surprisingly very tender and moist. The accompanying yogurt sauce help cut through some of the richness while adding a tangy creaminess. I absolutely loved the rice pilaf as it had great texture and flavor. \n\nPortion sizes were very generous and the Layaly Mixed Grill could easily feed 3 people. \n\nS E R V I C E\nOur waitress was very approachable and friendly but spread thin because she was the only one in the front of the house. In the beginning, she was attentive but as it got busy, it was hard for her to keep up. They really need to hire additional help especially during peak hours on the weekends. Nonetheless, she did a great job making sure we were ok and that our water glasses were filled.\n\nMy only gripe is our entrees took a while to arrive. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nCasual, yet very warm and cozy. The mellow yellow walls and the red wooden furnishings created a very welcoming and charming feel to Layaly. There's also a back patio for hookah. \n\nP A R K I N G\nAs previously stated, street parking in the area is a NIGHTMARE. Your best bet is looking for parking a block away on California. There is a parking lot a block away for $6/hour.\n\nWith the Scoutmob deal, we each paid $21 (including tax and gratuity) which was very affordable. They even have $7 lunch specials offered every day. \n\nOther Note(s):\nWe noticed A LOT of people coming into Layaly wanting to do hookah but they didn't offer it on the Sunday we were there, so I highly recommend calling ahead of time to make sure it's being offered that night. \n\nDid you know that Mediterranean food is THE healthiest ethnic cuisine according to CNN? There goes another reason to check out Layaly. Sorry, spanakopita does NOT count.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The most noteworthy aspect of this experience was that the temperature inside was only slightly warmer than the 50-55 degree F outside. The few customers in there were wearing big coats and hats. The waitress was in a hoodie. When asked about the temperature she indifferently remarked that the restaurant did not have a heater.

The baba ganouj was delicious and a little smoky in flavor. Tabouli served as a nice garnish but was a little too tart to eat on its own.\nAs for the entrees, I would suggest trying the mix grill. The steak and the lamb were a little tough to eat but all the meats (shrimp, lamb, shicken, steak, kofte) were well seasoned. The arugula salad on the side was really tart but we cooled that down with the leftover haydari.\nThe braised lamb shank could have been a little less bland but it could not have been tenderer. Unfortunately, the couscous that comes with it was dry, so dry. You really have to combine the grain with the meat juice to make it edible. \nThe baklava at the end of the meal was definitely good, but a little too over-honeyed for my taste.

The pita is warm, and the hummus creamy- just how I like it!\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Beyti for his entree, and though I didn't get to try it he said that it was really yummy. The way that it is cut makes it almost look like an appetizer, so perhaps if you want to eat something lighter this is a good option. \n\nI ordered the pomegranate chicken tagine. I'm grateful that the waitress gave me a heads up about this dish - the sauce it is cooked in is a pomegranate molasses, which is very tart. Once you know this, it's easier to taste the nuanced flavors of the tart sauce, savory chicken and onion, and earthy mushrooms over rice. A dollop of tzatziki rounds out the flavors as well. The portion was big enough that I had leftovers to take home.\n\nThe waitress was truly kind and wonderful, especially because we came in 30 minutes before closing.

The lemon that they added in it really offset the fatty meaty steak perfectly. That plus fresh soft pita, is heaven. Boyfriend's dish was good; he kept expecting it to be dry and overcooked, because it looked it, but it wasn't. Everything was done right. Same goes for my lamb. It fell right off the bone into the scrumptious broth that I kept ladling over the accompanying fluffy couscous.

They automatically charge you 18% gratuity, but service was good, so I didn't argue with that.  \n\nThe only thing that felt weird for us was that they charge you tax based on the pre-discounted amount.  So instead of charging tax on the $32 I paid to Groupon, they charge tax on the total $54 of what the food was worth on their menu.  (If I buy a pair of jeans onsale for $20, do I pay tax for $20 or the original $60?)  Overall you end up paying close to $50 for the Groupon deal, depending on what you order - which isn't much of a bargain.  \n\nI'll stick with their regular menu next time.

So tonight we had nothing BUT appetizers and man, I think we had a little too much haha.\n \n[M] We ordered the Borek (\"fried fillo dough stuffed with feta cheese and parsley\") http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9KeTKDuHdLMhRFku0HAIxw?select=NXVBpB01xZBkdoZOYuGYpQ, Cacik (\"Yogurt English cucumber, garlic, mint\") http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9KeTKDuHdLMhRFku0HAIxw?select=pbLNNiUlk5C8gIIun2FOPQ, Falafel (\"garbanzo with herbs and spices, fried served with tahini\") http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9KeTKDuHdLMhRFku0HAIxw?select=oCZIOGfyYBySHDEsocekpA, Garlic Fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9KeTKDuHdLMhRFku0HAIxw?select=Tx34Ian7ImSDpfxoOupb_w, Mezza Platter (\"hummus, baba ghanouj, haydari, tabouli, falafel, and borek\") http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9KeTKDuHdLMhRFku0HAIxw?select=HfDL2S2ZVOI7jwyYWkMJ1Q and a side of rice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9KeTKDuHdLMhRFku0HAIxw?select=QTDSx9QtiSg9PvJ7aL_6vw.\n\n[W] I personally didn't like the Cacik because the dip was wayyyyy to sour for me. Mona liked it on the other hand. It looked like some sort of thicker dip but it just had a little too much lemon or lime juice in it. \n\nMy 2nd suggestion is that if you get the Mezza Platter, DO NOT get the Falafels also. The platter already has the falafels and the 2 on the platter was already enough for me and Mona. \n\n[M] The Falafels tasted good at first but it was too fried for us. The insides were tasty but weren't really enjoyable because it's like eating something really burnt and crispy on the outside. \n\n[W] The other dish that was really good was their Rice haha. You're probably saying Rice? How can that be any good? But yea, trust me, IT WAS GOOOOOD. You really have to taste it to understand me. \n \nThe nice thing about this restaurant was that everything comes with some sort of dipping sauce which makes a big difference because if it didn't, I think everything would be extremely dry. \n\nThe only thing that bothered me was that the host was more attentive to his customers in their little secret back room. I guess this place has a hooka lounge in the back because people were walking out of nowhere from the back of the restaurant. That was kind of weird in my opinion because we're sitting in a restaurant and here comes some stoned people walking out of nowhere. I think they should have another entrance for those folks. That lead to another problem which was not being attentive to your other paying guests i.e. US. \n \nWe were done eating for a while and nobody was on the dining floor to assist us. So we just had wait until someone came out of the hooka room I guess. I guess that service could've been better. Oh well.  3.5 Stars.", "author": "Mona C."}

Last night, it was raining and they were slammed & apparently dealing with some employee issues, so my grubhub order came an hour after the ETA and was cold and missing items.  I called about it this morning and was pleasantly surprised when I got a call back.  Not only did I receive an apology, but also a free delivery of lots of delicious food AND a bottle of wine.

Took us a while to figure out where it was... because he had an idea of where this place was but not exactly sure. We almost gave up looking for it but I told him to try one more block and we found it! \n\nWe came here for lunch and my boyfriend wanted the baba ghanouj while i wanted hummus. So we ended up ordering the Mezza Platter as an appetizer. We were amazed by how much they gave us and it came with a basket of flat bread. I didnt want baba ghanouj because i didnt like eggplants, but it was actually really good. My fav was the hummus and baba ghanouj. The haydari was ok... the mint made me think of toothpaste... and the tabouli had parsley in it which I dislike. The falafel was yummy though and so was the borek.\n\nI ordered the Falafel Wrap and it was sooo yummy. it was a little dry but not too bad. It has hummus inside but it was even better when I added more hummus (from the platter) and baba ghanouj. I ordered fries with this and was amazed how well the fries were cooked. The outside was crispy but the inside was really really soft.\n\nMy boyfriend had the sauteed chicken. I took a bit of it and the chicken was cooked really well, but I think it should have more flavor (or maybe i didnt eat enough of it.) My boyfriend enjoyed it though, he finished the whole thing.\n\nThis place is really good. Definitely will come back.", "author": "Alicia W."}

Ordered one of the \"lunch specials\"--lamb kabob, rice and salad, and a Lebanese beer that I'm fond of. I asked for the lamb as rare as you can get it--just sear the outside.\n\nThe waitress/hostess (there seemed to be only 3 people working in the restaurant) was super attentive and very friendly. The lamb was deliciously seasoned, but cooked medium well, and there were only 4 tiny 1\" square morsels matched with 4 slices of grilled sweet pepper total--split across 2 skewers. The rice was unseasoned (albeit a dozen or so grains were yellow as if they'd been scented with some sort of stock.) The salad was well turned out with unusual greens and a tasty dressing. \n\nThe caveat? $11 for that plate. Seriously overpriced.

Finally, the parking goddess bestowed on us a great spot...as we're exiting my lovely auto, we spied \"Layaly\" from across the street with it's \"Under New Management\" sign...I had been to Layaly maybe 2 years ago and had enjoyed the meal...but frankly hadn't gone back because I have alot of other great places to go for Middle Eastern food and the parking stinks! \n\nAnywho...our group opted to go to Layaly...there were only a few tables occupied as we entered...very nice decor, banquettes on both walls, lots of tables and chairs but not so jammed in you have no privacy while dining...the kitchen is in the back corner (you can only see part of the kitchen but definitely hear the sizzle  = )    The man who greeted us was very friendly and seated us immediately.  Here's what we ordered:\n\n2 Al Hamra's (Lebanese beer) for my friends and a glass of Estancia Zin for moi.    The beer was tasty, the wine was ok...and not a very generous pour at that...My friend, after Beer # 1, wanted to switch, the very kind waitress said the other beer choices, my friend selected, they were out of it!!!  (They only have 4-5 beers to choose from as it is, so they definitely have to at least stock what's advertised)\n\nFor appetizers, we selected:  \n\nHaydari:  yummy garlicky yogurt dip*****10 STARS\nHummus*****5 STARS!! Creamy dreamy!!\nDolma    3.5 STARS (a bit soggy)\nFalafel:  ******5 STARS\n\nA Greek pita bread was served with these appetizers, warmed up, it's a bit thinner than Arabic pita and it was very good!! And plentiful!\n\nFor entrees:\n\nMixed Grill for me (Shrimp/Chicken/Lamb/Kofte  kebabs) interesting presentation, came with rice (very very small portion)  the meat was tasty...well spiced, the lamb was a bit chewy but the rest was quite good...I sensed it wasn't QUITE as hot (temp wise) as I would like...if you think of Chevy's fajitas, etc...where the meat arrives at the table just scorching hot...that's what Iike) It also came with grilled veggies...the tomatoes/onions/peppers...very tasty!\n\nMy friends both had Chicken kebabs...said the chicken was really good/tasty, but they too remarked on it not being super, just off the grill hot! Also lamented the rice portion was too small.\n\nFor dessert, I had the Kunefe (10 stars!!!! so DEE-LISH)\nMy companions ordered a plate of baklava to share and felt it\nwas a very small portion and not the freshest...not horrible or stale, just not that super fresh baklava that you expect and look forward to.\n\nAll in all, I would give Layaly 4 STARS!!!  It's a light/airy space (with a GREAT hookah back patio that stays open til 12-1am with tables/chairs/music/video screen)  a  young energy, comfy seating...\nArabic music playing in the dining room was really really good...not too loud but loud enough to hear it and appreciate it, totally matches the decor/energy.\n\nThings to work on:\n\n-  Keeping good inventory of beers offered\n-  Slightly more generous wine by the glass pours \n-  Getting the food to the table, SUPER hot\n-  Make the rice portions a bit larger...not enormous but enough to satisfy a very hungry person and/or to accompany the leftover kebabs(And at those prices)\n-  work on having MORE dessert selections and whatever you offer, make it super fresh/generous.\n\nIt's a new venture for the owners, only operating since October 2009...so perhaps they are still finding their way....definitely will go back again to see if they can earn the 5th STAR!!  = )", "author": "Karen S."}

At least, we were satisfied with the service and had read this from previous customers' reviews, so we knew what to expect.\n\n2) the entrees came out sort if cold...\n\n3) the food is overpriced...$4 for an inch size square baklava. The tea was $3.50 as well.\n\nNote: they made a mistake and brought us somebody else's appetizer. They took it back, but after I mentioned I had already tried it, they let us have it...thank you, very nice of you!\n\nOur bill for 2 with the automatic tip and tax came to $50 with Groupon.

Just tried again under the new management and was unfortunately disappointed with some of the changes.\n\nI have always ordered the meza platter and it was delicious. The new version is lacking punch - and especially missing the Squash Dip and Red Ezme and Tabouli components. The Bourek which were a new addition were too chewy (maybe lost their heat in transport). The falafel were ok. It all tasted pretty one dimensional in comparison to the original meza platter. The portion was distinctly smaller (especially since there were fewer items) and only $1 cheaper than the original version.\n\nThe Layaly salad was also altered and not improved upon. First,  when composing salads you want all the components (minus the lettuce) to be about the same size. In the new Layaly salad, there were 6 inch long ribbons of carrot (bad idea), and 1/4-inch diced cucumbers (way way too small) and mixed leaf salad that was ok but none of it worked together as a salad. The original Layaly salad had mint, parsley and scallions, and smaller crisp pita - no carrots - it just had a brightness and textural combination that worked. The dressing is the same (thankfully), but it was more a green salad than anything remotely Mediterranean. \n\nJust kind of bummed out about the changes and not sure this will merit another trip across town - which by the way I am willing to do for epic food.\nMaybe the hookah is the \"hook\" now", "author": "Mariangela S."}

The person on the other end of the phone was very polite and even asked in how long they can expect me so that they can get a new batch of coals ready.\n\nThe front of the restaurant is mostly reserved for sit-down dining, and is very cozy and quaint, with the back dedicated to hookah (although I am sure they still bring food back there).  The back is fully enclosed, but is still outside (basically a deck with a roof and walls).  However, because they have a patio heater, it never got too cold.\n\nThe hookah I ordered (peach) was brought out very quickly.  It was well packed and had a good flavor to it.  There was no shortage of coals as the owner was bringing by more every 10-15 minutes and checked to make sure it was heating right.  \n\nIn addition, we had two glasses of Arabic tea which complimented the hookah and helped keep us warm.\n\nThere is a screen on the wall with a projector hooked up to a broadcast of football (soccer) games, as well as an XBox 360 (which patrons are allowed to play).  If you go there with four or more guests, you can ask for a deck of cards to play Tarneeb (a popular Arabic card game). \n\nOverall, I am glad this place exists.

Sometimes it's a little hard and crunchy, and other times it's soft and chewy and delicious. It really depends what day of its cycle you get it on.\nMy entrees change with my mood. Sometimes the Tuna Salad is what I crave and it's so good. Perfectly seared Ahi with yummy greens, mini mandarins and cranberries. \nOr the Tajines are perfect for a cold, rainy or foggy San Francisco day. Sort of like a tomato stew with whatever protein/veggie combination you can think of. \nBaklava is delicious and they have a good wine selection - although I'd love to see more \"Mediterranean\" wine choices. My philosophy is, \"when in Rome\" so I love to try wines from where my food was inspired from.\nThey've started making unique cocktail drinks from wine and sake.

The food was sooooo goooodddd. I had the lamb kebob, and the lamb was cooked JUST HOW I WANTED IT TO BE COOKED! I also got some fries, yea i kno thats not the best thing to get but the fries were sooo fuckin good. Perfectly seasoned and the lamb kebob just got better. I was hoping the hookah wouldn't be shitty like A LOT of hookah bars in the city AND IT WASN'T! They really catered to my specific taste of hookah and how i liek to enjoy it. Also, its not some worker setting up the hookah, its the owners and they set it up SOOOO GOOOODDD. I will definately come back for hookah. It may not be a strict hookah lounge, but the set up is so much better than a lot of hookah lounges in the city. Also, some of the best arabic/turksih coffee in the city!!!!!!!

We started off with the mezes platter with toasted pita bread that I adored. Then we got the shrimp (excellent!) and the crab cakes. I ordered the mixed grill - it was so huge it also made for a great lunch the next day. I tried my friend's beyhti (sp???) and I would for sure want to share that with someone next time! \n\nThe servers were WONDERFUL. So much personality and just added to the fun of the night. We capped off the night with a couple hookahs and some dancing. They even taught us some hookah tricks with soap water. \n\nAt the end of the night, we were even able to hook up my friend's ipod to their speakers so we could listen and dance to one of his playlists. \n\nOh!

Obviously, Layaly has \"been discovered.\" \n\nWhy is this place so great? \n\nFirst, it's a family business. My mom loves playing the, \"Oh, I bet that guy is the father, and those are the children. Oh, and she's so skinny. I bet she's a vegetarian.\" \n\nSecond, the menu is simple and straight forward. Start with the $15 mezza platter, then pick a kabob. My parents had the kofta kabob (on the dry side, but it means that they are lean!), while I indulged in the mixed grill (two shrimp, kofta, chicken, and lamb). They are served with rice or fresh fries, and a salad to start. The sweet cheese dessert is totally worth the wait. YUM!

I like how it was served with pita triangles.\n\nFor our entrees, we each got the beef kebab and mixed kebab.  The mixed kebab was served with shrimp, beef and kefta.

And it was such a great experience!\n\nHere's my breakdowns:\n\n1. The food & services: This is my first time to have a mideastern meal so I have no comparision! We came around 1pm so it wasn't crowded at all. The service was fast. The waiters were very friendly and helpful. We had mezes platter (see my photos) for appetizer, it was very good. Then we ordered the \"lunch special\" items: Lamb Kebab, and Eggplant stuffed, $7 each (I believed!) The lamb was so tender! Then we had the \"Kunefe\" for dessert. \n\n2. The dessert: OMG! I had Buklava many times before, but this dessert is my favorite now! It looked like a slide of salmon at first, but when I used the folk to get a piece, its cheese filling was just like from pizza, and it's kind of hard to separate it from the whole thing! It has grated pistachios on top. It's so rich. I loved it!!\n\n3. The price: It cost almost $40 for 1 appetizer, 2 lunch specials, and 1 dessert!\n\nI'd give 4.5 stars for the food, 5 stars for service, 3 star for the price. Overall, it deserves 4-star rating!

It took some effort \nsince I LOVE Indian food and the great buffet there.  It was rather late in the afternoon, though, so I crossed the street and decided to indulge my hankering for baba ganouj.  I walked into a completely empty restaurant and was greeted warmly by owner, Maher Damous, who hails from Jerusalem.\n\nI was very impressed with the cleanliness of Lavaly, everything neat and in order.  He handed me an extensive menu with dishes, he explained, from Jordan, Lebanon and the Mediterranean.  There were choices to suit all tastes.\n\nI settled on a cup of lentil soup which was tasty but a little bland.  The \nmeza platter was utter delightful and so beautiful, I regretted not having my camera with me.  It was so visual, with its mix of colors and textures.\nEach scoop was delicious - hmmus, baba ganouj, tabouli, haydari, red ezme, falafel, and a yellow squash dip, served with pita bread.  I would never come here without having that meza.  Fit for the gods.\n\nI finished off the meal with an excellent Turkish coffee and a tres leche \ncake - I've had much better tres leche.  I suspect their baklava, made on site is superior.  Next time, I will go with the baklava.\n\nI will definitely return in the near future - with a friend - so we can sample more of the menu.

The menu was very generic and catered to an American audience. Not a place to go if you're looking for traditional Middle Eastern dishes. \n\nAmbiance: Warm and inviting, not super dimly lit, but no florescent track lighting. The walls were painted a subtle cream color and there was art along the walls. They played Arabic music which totally gets you in the mood to eat (and dance).\n\nFood: The basics koofta and kebabs. They do have a mezza platter as an appetizer where you can try about 4 or 5 different dips along with a couple falafels. \n            Presentation was very nice. They took time to decorate with mint and stacked the kebabs very nicely. \n           There was enough food, but not in abundance. Arabs like to EAT and so i think a good measure of it being a real Arabic restaurant is how much of something you get. \n            Inexpensive wine that pairs nicely with all dishes!!\n\nService: Attentive and very friendly.\n\nI would recommend for first time Middle Eastern eaters.

I wished they had truffle oil to lace it with, or some kind of Parmesan creamy dip. The Combo platter will give you a whiff of the many things they have.  I find the lamb very tasty on one visit, and sort of under seasoned the next.  \n\nThe kofta -or ground meat sticks if i got that wrong, are what gets me coming back here.  I love the meaty texture and flavor of the bite.  Chewy, herbacious, with the light acidic tang.  \n\nI was lucky to have tried the Chilean Sea Bass one night and that was a great skewer.  Perfectly cooked, charred, and paired with a nice grilled tomato.  The sweetness of the tomato match great with meaty fish.

The cuisine of this restaurant hails from Jordan.  \n\nThe falafel sandwich has just gotten better now that they are wrapped in a thin lavash bread instead of the thicker pita.  The falafel balls are perfectly flavored and nice and crunchy.  It also includes hummus which is not very common which makes it more filling than others.  Though I have yet to find a falafel better than Truly Mediterranean.\n\nOddly enough, the french fries you can get with the sandwiches are the best I've ever had.  They apparently use special fresh potatoes and a double-fry them to make them perfect.  I only with they would give you something to dip them in other than ketchup.\n\nThe Layaly Salad is very flavorful for a fairly traditional salad that is served with crispy pita chips.  The olives in the salad are certainly amazing.  I'm not even a big salad person.\n\nI really like the Turkish coffee.  So why Turkish coffee?  Apparently it was the closest the owner could find to his favorite from back home.\n\nTheir baklava is also the best I've had.  Very rich in flavor and an awesome flaky texture with fresh ground pistachios on top. Mmmm!\n\nMy only complaint is that the Clay Oven is right across the street.  Layaly is the healthier, cheaper, and quicker option, but the greasy, exploding flavors of Clay Oven are sometimes too hard to resist.\n\nI give this place 4 stars because all the food I've had has consistently been great, the staff is very friendly and accommodating, and the facility is very clean.

Clean, bright and welcoming ambiance. The service was fairly quick and waitress friendly and attentive (water glass always full). Those are the good attributes... \n\nUnfortunately, not much good can be said about the food. My companion and I ordered the filo wrapped appetizer with cheese and herbs. When it arrived I thought maybe they had the order wrong as they appeared more like mini egg rolls. Edible, but a bit on the bland side, and soooooo not what I expected. The chicken kabobs I ordered were nothing spectacular. In fact, the chicken wasn't seasoned enough and was quite dry. The vegetables weren't very memorable to say the least. Thank goodness for the yogurt sauce that I used to drizzle over the kabobs...but even that was below par. The order came with fries and while I enjoyed them (probably the best thing we ordered), they did taste very frozen (think they didn't even thaw them, they just put straight in the deep fryer). My companions meat dish looked like a stew and when asked how it tasted, he proclaimed, \"Not super flavorful.\" And that my friend, is exactly how I would classify the entire meal...\"Not super flavorful...\" \n\nAgain, too bad because it's moderately priced, nice venue and service. Maybe it was an off day or we ordered wrong?", "author": "Marie B."}

Secondly, the beer and wine was sub-par and too much money. I know the prices get jacked up on alcohol to drink at a place like that, but I was drinking some 2 buck chuck for like $8 dollars. They only have 3 beers, and none of them really interest me. The price was a little bit high, especially considering they're in an area surrounded by many college students.

However, it was really nothing to rave about and the food was a bit forgetable.  But, if your in the neighborhood and want some mediterranean food, this is a good choice.", "author": "a e."}

Make sure to try the hummus sampler platter with hummus and yogurt dip and other various dips so you can decide which is your favorite because you will definitely come back.  The deserts are pretty and tasty, and if you sit on the back patio you can enjoy a fabulous hookah", "author": "Janet H."}

Wednesday night it was very slow there but the food was THE BEST middle eastern food I've ever had with outstanding Hummas and Kebbobs. Arabic coffee was nectar of the Gods! waitress was super nice and helpful and the owner? Ahkmed (forgive spelling error) was a gentleman and stayed just for us to finish Hookah. Hookah was my first time and it was great! Had mint-Mellon.  Unfortunately a new wacky SF law will probably shut down most Hookah in the city by March. Well. I'll still come to Layaly for the great service and food.", "author": "David H."}

Presentation was exceptional (hummus was served on a wide white bowl, draped in olive oil, with a beautiful scallion(?) garnish!), quite fancy I must say, since I usually go to Sunset Deli or Yumma's.  Sunset has them on the falafel and Yumma's on price, but for a nice sit down Middle eastern/Greek meal, in a pretty atmosphere with an extremely pleasant wait staff - this is the place! Don't forget to have the Turkish coffee - twas delish!", "author": "Rita W."}

The food was SO GOOD, especially the hummus and the chicken kabobs. Oh and I forgot about the pita bread! It was really fresh and soft, and it was perfect with the hummus. The two guys that own this place are really friendly and super attentive.  They also have a hookah lounge in the back with a variety of flavors of shisha.  It was a little cold in the lounge, but I recommend the white peach- it was really tasty! I definitely want to go back soon, I found the prices really reasonable for the food.", "author": "Kate D."}

The meza platter even won over my previously hummus-hating husband. Yummy hot pita, refilled as often as we wished. The mixed grill was a good first time dish - shrimp, kofta, beef or lamb skewer, really juicy chicken - mmm. Served with salad and tasty rice (or fries, but the rice is delish!) Servers were very nice, though one was a little inexperienced - and the parking is always a problem in the neighborhood, but it's well worth the trouble to drive around or walk a couple blocks!", "author": "Gale H."}

So, I was pretty excited to find this restaurant in our semi-new neighborhood!\nLayala offers a wide selection of Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food in a nice, warm atmosphere.  I love the food, it's always super fresh, light and delicious.  I'm not sure how long this restaurant has been open, I couldn't find a review on it.  Anyhow, 5 stars for freshness, very friendly service, consistent quality, and for being affordable at a high quality.  I had dinner here a few times, the kebabs are all very tasty and juicy, the appetizers are diverse and great, and the salads come with a simple and delicious lemon-juice-and-olive-oil vinaigrette.  Tonight I tried the grilled fish, served as kebab and superb (halibut, turned out to be on the expensive side - A.Q.) .  Oh yeah, don't forget to finish up with Turkish coffee and homemade baklava! :)  \nHad lunch here as well, great sandwiches and salads!\nDid I mention the food is very fresh?!", "author": "J R."}

We ate there Friday night and had a great mean.  I had the cod with cous cous.  My son had the prawns and my wife had the eggplant.  The cod was probably the best I've ever had.  It was charred and tasty on the outisde; moist, juicy and tender on the inside.  My son (12 yrs old) stated his shrimp were the best ever and he's had lots of shrimp.  My wife really liked her eggplant until she tasted my cod.  Then she wanted that.  Portions were good - we were quite full when we left.  Everything seemed to be freshly made frorm scratch.  The dolmas appetizer were warm and quite tasty.  Nothing at all like those from a can.  The baclava was also warm and tasted home made.  It was so good, we had to get another order even though we were quite full.  Service was good and attentive.  I'm surprised they weren't busier given how good our meal was.  I did note the sign said \"under new management\" which could explain why my review differs from earlier ones.  We will be back within a month, I'm sure.", "author": "Joe J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-01-04", "description": "Our party of one vegetarian, one vegan and one very light eater chose this restaurant on New Year's Eve mainly because it was within walking distance to our homebase, and Mediterranean food tends to be veg-friendly and filled with tapas-style offerings. We were not disappointed: the light eater had the chicken soup, which she pronounced good; the vegan had the vegetable kebab, which he thought was tasty but looked to me like grilled eggplant, onion and potato piled rather gracelessly onto his plate.  I (the plain ol' vegetarian) had the stuffed eggplant, which was filled with a mixture of tomatoes, chopped eggplant, onion, and other savory vegetables. I thought my dish was quite good, though the eggplant's skin was tough and hard to cut.  We also all had dessert: the light eater and I split a chocolate mousse and the vegan had the baklava. We all thought the desserts were exceptionally good. \n\nHowever, this place really needs to be more attentive to service. When we walked in, our waiter was having a loud conversation with a friend, who was complaining about the lousy economy and how bad business was at the restaurant. We were the first customers in at 5 p.m. and were promptly seated and given menus. But the friend continued his long and impossible to ignore bitching about the economy, and our waiter was obviously preoccupied with talking, not serving. I had to prompt him to tell us what the fish of the day was (environmentally incorrect Chilean sea bass) and what the evening's specials were. I was also irate at being forced to listen to the conversation at the waiter's station: customers are NOT passive cows who don't understand or care what the staff is chattering about. I may not agree with your opinions, and I certainly don't like being ignored while I try to decide what to choose what's on my menu. Once the friend left, the waiter finally began to focus on serving us. But we waited 20 minutes too long to order. Things like this are the death of a restaurant, even if the food is good.", "author": "Eleanor T."}
