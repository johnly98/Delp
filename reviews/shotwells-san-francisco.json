(They weren't doing well in the first half.) My group of four decided to go to Shotwell's as it was close to our last stop. We dropped by on Saturday, May 26th around 7:45pm. It wasn't too busy from what I remember. We managed to find a table in the back by one of the TVs.\n\nI didn't take part in the ordering, but I ended up with a beer. By this time, I'd had a fair amount to drink, so I have no idea what beer it was. I just knew it came in a chimay glass. I'm not a huge beer girl, but it was easy to drink. (Beer lately has become my go to when my stomach can't handle any more alcohol, but I still want something to sip on.)\n\nAtmosphere wise, this place is your typical sports bar. Dark with lots of TVs. Had a good time with all the other basketball fans. Plus, they came back in the third quarter and won! Always adds to the fun and festivities when your team wins.\n\nFun bar to catch a game. And I can't argue with a bar that brings it home. That's a winner in my book.", "author": "Elena N."}

A lot of the bars I've been to in San Francisco have a THING happening, but Shotwell's is a place for when you just want to enjoy some tasty brews with your pals and hang out chatting in a dark and cozy setting. \n\nThere was a good line up of affordable craft beers with a handful on draught and many more in bottles. There are pool tables if you're looking to keep your hands busy with something other than beer, and the bar is dog friendly (though we sadly didn't spot any pooches on our visit). \n\nShotwell's exterior is charmingly old-school and the interior is similarly designed with beadboard and dark wood.

It was one of those evenings where I hoped it would stay dark forever, and (unlike The Mountain Goats in their wonderfully bitter song \"No Children\") I KNEW the worst wasn't over. My only hope of escape was to get completely anesthetized , totally self-indulgently polluted, entirely locked out of my own mind, in hopes that sometime after my fourth or fifth drink, I might be able to forget about the end of a relationship painful enough to drive me me towards the watering-holes of the Mission District instead of relaxing in the comfortable sleaze of my favorite Richmond district dive. \n\nIt was one of those nights where as I sidled up to the bar, I had to do a double take. The man reflected in the antique back-bar COULDN'T have been me (sometimes I lie to myself, especially when I'm looking more disheveled than usual), but when he (as I did in that exact same moment) ordered himself an Almanac \"Birre de Chocalat\", I had to come to terms with the fact. I chatted with the owner (David, an incredibly friendly dude), who allowed me to sample Almanac's \"Sour Chocolate Porter\" (a fantastic note of bittersweet chocolate, a faint hit of hazelnut, and an aftertaste like a tart cherry pie) amidst the beautiful chandeliers, engravings, and authentic moldings from Shotwell's time as a gin joint in the early 20th Century. \n\nAfter a second beer (Magnolia Proving Ground IPA), a third (Anchor Steam), and a fourth (a Drake's Dennoginizer [Dennoginize me David!]), I began to realize that Shotwell's was a pretty fascinating cross-section of what San Francisco had become: North-Face wearing techies living for the weekend, service industry folks with tattoos, old punks, and writers carrying me away, the internet jukebox blasting punk and hip-hop, everyone drinking away the tension of the week. In so many ways, Shotwell's may be one of the most perfect bars in San Francisco: the people are friendly, the beer is good, the bartenders aren't assholes, and the music is just loud enough for everyone to get carried away in the atmosphere of a place which doesn't need to try to be trendy but succeeds through its timeless authenticity. That night (and maybe every night) it was just what I needed.\n\nI finished my beer, stumbled out into the night, and began the long trek back home to my district.

I was here on Black Friday evening, having just arrived in San Francisco for the first time ever and since I was staying close to the mission district. It was a quieter night since it was a holiday weekend, so I sat down, ordered a beer and started talking with the bartender. What a cool dude! He said he was a transplant from Boston himself, and gave me excellent suggestions on what to see, where to go and even how to get there in San Francisco. He even recommended a place to eat later when I was leaving. There's a pool table as well and the music wasn't loud.\n\nYou know it's a neighborhood bar when you go in and the bartender knows your beer. The guy sitting next to me was a regular and said he wished it was quieter this way all the time, but that it usually gets crowded. Decent beer selection although I've only tried a couple of the ones on tap. I'll definitely go back if I'm in San Francisco again!", "author": "Siva J."}

All of the bartenders are spectacular-- friendly, knowledgable and willing to offer samples.

It was all about good beer and good atmosphere, and that's what it's still all about today.  The guys who own it are friendly, love beer, and will happily talk to you about local brews, their favorite beers, and everything else.  I stop in once every few months (not enough, I readily admit), and they always remember my face and ask how things are going.  And then we discuss whatever their favorite current beer is and I go on to have a great time.\n\nThe atmosphere is relaxed, there are two pool tables and even some pinball machines in the back.  For the combo beer lover and social media junkie, they even run a Twitter and Facebook account to discuss their current offerings.  So stop by, have a drink and a good time.", "author": "Seth F."}

Be it with parents, friends or strangers, do I want to come hang out here regardless?  Is this place comfortable and alluring?  Do they make good drinks but i'll want to leave after one?  Does the place lack personality?\n\n-Shotwell's is a great place.  When you walk in, you're just like...  \"damn!\".  You don't feel weird, you don't feel lost, you're not intimidated.  This place feels like your favorite pair of underwear from the beginning.\n\n2)  Selection of Beer - Shaken, Stirred, Neat, Twist, fleh.  Not saying i don't love hard alcohol but i've come to realize I'm a huge beer fan.  However, i want some variety in my beer with a good dash of originality.  If as interesting as your bar can offer are Sierra, Stella, Widmer and Guinness, then I likely won't be back.  Offer me a good mix of both light and dark, lagers, ales, wheat beers and Belgians with something I have yet to taste.  Don't give me the selection at Safeway but on draft.\n\n-Shotwell's has a great selection of both taps and bottles.  A good mix of imports peppered with a few choice domestics, i was a happy camper. Never mind coming in for a cold one, If i didn't have somewhere to be I could have easily stayed for about 5 based on the selection.\n\n3.  Lack of B.S. - Pretty self explanatory.  Don't pretend to be something you're not, be a little friendly to the customers (people paying your wages and throwing you tips) and we'll all have a good time.\n\n-Check.  Good bartenders, friendly, helpful and not afraid to bust my balls when I was getting a little too mushy with my girlfriend.  Fair enough and it's pretty hilarious.  \n\nIf I lived about three blocks closer, I'd be here about twice a week.", "author": "Steven R."}

Why change the name if that's the only thing that changes?  Still the same solid selection of draft beers, the same pool tables, the same laid back crowd, the same Obama paraphernalia, and the same too-few tables.  I am also a fan of the jukebox and though I have not played pinball yet, I like that it's there.  \n\nThe bartenders are superbly friendly and (as I already mentioned) the beer selection is very good, covering an impressive range of beers.  No brown ales on tap, but I've come to accept that San Francisco is apparently not a brown ale kind of city.  Some friends of mine always order the sangria, which is also good and cheap.  The bartenders don't seem to mind when you bring in snacks of any kind, which is good of them.  On nights when you can find a seat, this is the place.", "author": "Josh C."}

Amazingly enough, these seemingly basic attributes are rarely all found in today's version of customer service.  All the Sunday customers were having a good time talking, watching the World Baseball Classic, playing pool, reading, and enjoying the SnackMix stuff that was offered in bowls.  One thing I always remember about a bar, is the salty goods that they offer while you're drinking.  Hmm, salty goods make me drink more $5-$7 beers, why would a bar owner OK giving me $1.43 in crackers?

We walked a few blocks to get there and had plenty to drink during dinner so first thing I asked for was a cup of ice water while everyone took a look at the big beer selection. Ironically everyone in my party was thinking the same thing (but others already had started to order beer as well). One bartender was really nice, the place is nicely decorated with good seating. Overall, it was a great place so we decided to stay there instead of hopping to another bar that was on the schedule.\n\n1:20am was rolling around and many people from my group had to drive at least an hour to two hours to get home, so drivers were trying to sober up before heading home. \n\nMy friend went to the bar to ask for 2 cups of ice water just a few minutes before we were planning on getting the group together to leave. The other bartender said, and I quote:\n\n\"NO! You guys have been ordering waters all night...it's NOT funny. No!\"\nhe shakes his head and continues to chat with an annoyed face with his co-bartender and some customers at the bar.\n\nI understand they're trying to make money, but it wasn't like my party of 10+ people didn't order good amounts of beer and give tips. It was a nice place...but \"Last calls\" were going to happen soon, people are being responsible by slowing alcohol consumption, hydrating, before going behind the wheel and we get rejected with rudeness!!!\n\nIf that didn't happen, I would've gave better.

I haven't had the pleasure of being there for one of these, but I hear nothing but good things.", "author": "Matt F."}

It gets 5 stars for that. Great warm vibe and not overly crowded. My group of friends like to stop by for a few beers and to play pool. They have a decent selection of beer and it's not too pricey. This bar is an inviting and casual place to kick it with your friends on a weekend night when you're not trying to do anything too big!", "author": "Janie Y."}

(oh, and if they would try to enforce the sf health code and not allow dogs in the bar.  i love 'em too, but out on the street people who are highly allergic - like yours truly - retain the option of not petting and crossing the street if need be.  i don't like getting driven out of enclosed spaces when i want another.)\n\ngood space, crimson walls studded with old saloon mirrors.  good place to stop in for good beer at good prices, friendly and great bartenders.  but after the third round i remembered what the problem was with beer only bars - no gin or whiskey.  they must have had wine too but i never got passed the beer list.  and i don't want to pull apart every dog hair landing on my nose but i really think they ought to go back to their previous name as \"beer parlor\", which is a whole lot less misleading than \"bar\" which suggests to me there might be more than beer.  but maybe this was a first step and they're working on getting their alcohol license? i'll definitely be back when that happens.  but for now i'll be hitting up shotwell's beer parlor when i'm on this pretty tree-lined street in this part of the hood.", "author": "Nikki F."}
