I'm so jealous! I didn't get it this time..\" I let her know I was new in SF and it was my first time there- she's lived in SF her whole life and a regular at Causwell's. She too reaffirmed that it was the best burger in town- handsdown. So a lot of pressure on this burger.. and it did not dissapoint!\n\nDEVILED EGGS- I love me some deviled eggs and these did not disappoint either! Rich creamy and full of flavor. What more could you want in a deviled egg? Hack: Comes with 5, but you can add on extra ones to even out the portion for your group.\n\nBURGER- I added bacon to mine because I couldn't help it. I nearly added avo too but I didn't want to over do it. The patty was almost the opposite of in-n-out in its consistency but very similar in flavor I thought. The patty was uneven crumbles of ground meat that was seared to juicy perfection. It was slightly over-cooked than medium rare imo, but still amazingly scrumptious! The fried onion strings were a delicious crunchy flavorful addition too! I wouldn't sub fries for this (i almost did) because the onion strings are so good!! I got a side of fries but it was almost unnecessary.. the side of garlic aoili was bomb though if you can manage to get that on the side of your onion strings.\n\nI will definitely be craving this burger and be back for more!", "author": "Nina M."}

The bun was one of my favorite things about the burger.  Loved how soft it was but still kept its form to keep the burger together.  The fried onion thingies on the side are ridonk.

I even deliberately wore a Marina outfit (large shades, trendy coat, tall boots, and a pink sparkly clutch)--for funsies, and I ended up strangely feeling like I fit into the Marina bougieness.\n\nWe came for brunch, and I decided on the double patty Americana burger for the extra dollar since the brunch burger trades off the extra patty for bacon a fried egg. My friends got the brunch burger and loved it, though the fried egg is runny and could be messy if you're not eating the burger with a fork and knife (which you most definitely should, since you're in the Marina.) \n\nThe Americana burger is based on classic ingredients, but meticulously perfected each one so well that everything synergized into indulgent deliciousness. There's no fancy eggy brioche bun, blue cheese, grilled onions, or mushrooms; instead, it's your basic toasted sesame bun (though with schmexy grill marks), American cheese, thousand island sauce, lettuce, pickles, and raw onions. However the finely chopped lettuce, thinly sliced pickles, and delicately cut onion rings imparted a unique texture and subtly augmented the flavors of the beef. The focus remained largely on the patty, which was a perfect medium well. It didn't seem too dry, especially with the overlay of melted cheese. My favorite part was the slightly crispy exterior, as if the patty had been briefly pan-fried.\n\nI was disappointed that the Americana burger at brunch comes with salad, since I've heard good things about the crispy onions that accompanies the burger on the dinner menu. The salad was decent though, with fresh mixed greens, a tangy balsamic dressing, and a little relief that makes you feel somewhat healthier when you eat the burger.\n\nAt $16 (~$22 after tip, tax, and SF mandate) it's pricey, but for a famous burger that hits so many lists, the decent portion size (I took half of it home for leftovers), and the fact of dining in the Marina, in my opinion it's a worthwhile adventure.\n\nLet me state a disclaimer that I am not a burger person. As a former Berkeley student, I (stereo-typically) went through a clean-eating-obsessed-vegetarian phase and was horrified of burgers. But since living in burger-obsessed SF and dating a burger-obsessed boyfriend, I have gradually converted back though I'm sometimes inclined to order the veggie burger, much to boo's disapproval.\n\nTL;DR: Good burger, approved by someone who generally doesn't like burgers.

The burger is set next to a mound of crispy salty onions that you just can't stop eating. \n\nNext, I had braised short ribs that were soft and tender. They were on a bed of crunchy, bright yellow cauliflower that reminded me of a spicy Indian dish.

That did not make any rearrangement..\n\nOne of our children slid and bumped her head on the table during dinner. There were two empty tables next to our normal table for most of our meal. I wish the restaurant could have given them to us and told us the time that we had to return the tables. The waitress that served our table who was the same as the one who made our table arrangement seemed to be annoyed at us the entire time.

I would have to wait.  After 10 minutes of standing about I approached the hostess and asked what the problem was, as the place was half empty.  She told me that she wanted to seat me at a corner table that was still occupied; when I asked why she couldn't seat me at any of the open tables she agreed.  This was ridiculous. \n\nAfter being seated I waited.  And waited and waited.  Nothing.

A wild arugula salad was nicely portioned and the asian pear lent a nice counterpoint to the arugula.  \n\nNext, I asked if I could get the burger with carrots substituted for the crispy onions.

My experience with all things burger in South Bay has been wickedly disappointing, and through thorough Internet searching, I had Causwell's earmarked. Thanksfully, I was not disappointed.\n\nOur weekend brunch there was ad hoc. We were doing some casual sightseeing with the kids, got hungrier, and realized we were a stone's throw away. Though the dining room was booked, we snagged an outdoor table right away with our two little ones, which turned out to be fairly successful. It's a nice Parisian-style setup, with cramped tables and a scenic view of a major Marina drag.\n\nSo the Causwells burger. It's a riff on the no-frills fast food burger, but with faux frills and a price tag to match. It's okay, I can dig it. That's Au Cheval in a nutshell. The perfect burger? It's got American cheese. It's got a thin patty. With flavor, so you can eat just the patty with nothing else and still be satisfied. It's got a tasty sauce, though. In case you need it. And the bread is good, neither overwhelming nor detracting. And that's it. Other ingredients are optional and should value-add.\n\nCauswell's meets all standards. No, it's not quite as good as Au Cheval. The meat is seasoned well but not perfectly like Au Cheval's griddled goodness. The thousand island \"In N Out spread\" replica isn't as good as the Au Cheval's perfect dijonnaise. And the $16 price tag, woof. It makes Au Cheval's single look like a small bite at $11.\n\nBut enough negativity. Causwell's does a great burger. Just writing about it, I want it again.

The bun was fresh. It did not become soggy by the burger as some hamburgers do. It just overall had a good flavor. The downside was there were no fries to order:(.. when you have an awesome burger you want some hot and crispy steak fries! That would have completed my completely fatty meal... lol... but so good.

We came here on 2/25/2018. About 2:30ish, so not very busy at all.  We never thought we would be treated as terribly as we did but it happened. \nI truly support all sorts of small businesses throughout the Bay Area. My friend who came with me, owns three restaurants in San Francisco so we often go out to support various restaurants. \nWe ordered waters, sodas, burgers, and the bread pudding. Burgers are good, nothing I would crave for, beautiful presentation though . Crispy onions are a little salty, possibly because we hardly consume much salt. What reeled is in was 'All star donut' pudding. Took it to go, it was okay as well. Pretty simple, right?! I ordered the brunch burger so the yolk will explode and obliterate the one cloth napkin you have and if you try to ask for another napkin depending on your waitress and if you are a person of color, you will get ignored. Caucasian female with straight shoulder length hair, will ignore you if you ask her anything, but she will make sure to come back to bring your credit cards back.  This is the only time she would acknowledge us. After ignoring us, I was so pissed, I got up to grab another napkin off another table and looked for a utensil. The hostess realized I needed something. I told her I'll just help myself since the waitress refused to acknowledge us. The 'supervisor, Gaby, sure ran over to help us as I went to sit down. It was weird to be asked our names and to make sure we came back. She asked if we were done as soon as she was done asking her questions so probably a ploy to make sure we left since the patrons next to us were less than a foot away. She 'made it right' by  taking off our sodas and the pudding off the tab. Big whoop. Our original waitress was the only decent one but forgot our waters. Mind you, I wouldn't bring the race thing up but as I'm watching two Asian gals a few tables in front of me not get waited on, until their Caucasian friend who shows up some time later sits down is when this same waitress decides to take their order. You can at least ask if they want anything to drink. \nWe don't care how much we spent. Service counts for a huge chunk. I remember AMAZING service at an IHOP! I guess I shouldn't have expected that much. Trust us, when we REALLY gave her the benefit of a doubt, we asked her twice said excuse me three times each and she was taking orders less than a foot away. I don't ask for much but trust and believe patrons are more than appreciative if we just get the 'basics'. A couple of 'how are things', fill water (never got this) , just maybe some attentiveness would be nice like grabbing a napkin when yolk is running down their arm. \n\nGood luck there is always room for improvement!", "author": "Vanessa T."}

And it was the runner up. My favorite high end cheeseburger place is Au Cheval in Chicago so I was super curious to find out how this place compared. Especially since it beat Au Cheval!\n\nWell, I tried it and while the burger is good, Au Cheval is still king in my book. But let me give you concrete reasons so you don't think I'm biased by my Chicago roots. Comparisons aside, the burger here is good but I just would not come back and pay for it unless I came back with a curious group of friends. Similar to Au Cheval, the cheeseburger has two thinner patties. However, it doesn't have that amazing thick cut bacon. Or the runny egg. I think you can add bacon to the cheeseburger if you want to, but it's just not the same. The burger here comes with lettuce, pickles, and some thousand island tasting dressing which is pretty good - runs you about $16. \n\nHowever, I want to reiterate this is a good cheeseburger! Just not enough to keep someone coming back who is meh about most cheeseburgers. Also the burger comes with a side salad so you feel less bad about gorging yourself. One note: we came during a weekend morning and there wasn't a really long wait but we sat at the bar. I'd think there would be more of a wait during this time if you have a bigger party. The server was incredibly nice. I got a mimosa and she was very generous with the champagne! \n\nI will also say, if you do come here, please try the deviled eggs.

We walked to Ella's in Presidio Heights and arrived at 2:45 (they close at 3), only to find them closed.  D'oh!  I was so hungry, I was starting to become angry (hangry).  We hastily checked the Yelp app for open restaurants serving breakfast, brunch, or-well-anything!  We dialed up Causwells, and they informed us that not only were they still serving brunch, but that they had a special holiday brunch menu.  Yay!  They even placed our name on the waitlist, despite the fact that we were not there. Yay x 2! \n\nWe began to make our way to Causwells (about 20 minutes away).  And after the hike up, up, up a steep hill to the Marina, I was all out furious.  No fuel, no food, no bueno.  \n\nWhen we arrived, Causwells was semi-packed. It was a beautiful day, so folks were seated outside as well as in.  I was surprised to find that there were a lot of children there, but it's a holiday and the Marina, so I guess it makes sense.  \n\nWe were sat immediately.  I ordered the Shacksbury cider (or whatever the hell it's called) and the boyfriend ordered a Crabbie's ginger beer on ice, which is always a good choice, especially on an unseasonably hot day in San Francisco.  We decided to start with the deviled eggs with smoked trout and the cauliflower soup with brown butter.  I love that cauliflower is in season right now, because every place seems to be serving cauliflower soup, but with the addition of brown butter, you know I had to have that! The deviled eggs were outstanding - I was a little skeptical of the smoked trout addition, but it totally worked, and gave the dish a little something egg-stra.  (Ugh) \n\nFor entrees, I ordered the lunch cheeseburger with no bun.  FYI, I'm not eating carbs right now (I prefer to drink my carbs via alcohol).  It was still super yummy, juicy and cheesy.  My boyfriend got the pork hash, which I also thought was delicious.  With my entr\u00e9e, I tried a blood orange gose beer they hard on the canned/bottled beers menu, which was simply wonderful.  I want to go back just for that beer!  Keep in mind that Causwells serves beer and wine only, so if you are in need of harder, you'll have to look elsewhere.  \n\nOverall, Causwells was a huge win for us on the holiday weekend.  It's a really cute place in the Marina that is definitely worth a visit or two or three.  The prices are standard, the service is great (despite my pain in the ass boyfriend requesting to move tables), and the crowd is chill.

It's so spectacular that it has been featured on Eater, Thrillist, SFist AND 7x7 as being one of THE very best in SF (and in America). Needless to say, my expectations were high. When I took my first bite, I thought the burger angels were going to play on their harps and unicorns were going to dance in my mouth. Alas, Causwells' Americana Burger ($15.99 + $1.50 bacon) is just a fancy In-N-Out Double Double or Big Mac, on par with Super Duper: http://bit.ly/1N5XwF6. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that but why go all the way to The Marina when you can just go into any one of the six Super Duper locations in SF? \n\nInstead of one thick patty, the Americana Burger has two thin ones and they only cook the burger medium well: http://bit.ly/1Zj9Fxo which is a cardinal sin IMO. Team medium rare!\n\nThe burger was juicy (high fat ratio?) but excessively salty, greasy, and heavy. I love animal spread but the Causwells sauce (thousand island dressing based) made it unnecessarily heavier. No one eats a burger for health but only one of my friends (out of 5) could finish their burger and only because he didn't eat the entire day. Leftovers went uneaten. Don't get me wrong, the burger wasn't terrible -  just terribly overrated and overhyped. \n\nBut...\n\nThose accompanying onion shoestrings were like crack especially with Sir Kensington's ketchup. I would have gladly face shoveled an entire tray and forgo the burger.\n\nMy pick for best burger in SF is Rove Kitchen, where the chef uses a chuck, ribeye, and shortrib blend for his thick patty that is cooked to a perfect medium rare and served between house-baked buns: bit.ly/1Bnfq1K. \n\nWe also shared the following small plates:\n+ Baby Kale Salad w/ baby yam, bacon, cured yolk, mustard ($13): http://bit.ly/1J1DzUZ.\nMy favorite dish of the night next to the onion shoestrings. The salad was perfectly dressed and I really enjoyed the sweet yams and salty bacon bits. Didn't taste or see any yolk though. \n\n+/- Crispy Pork Belly w/ apple, fennel, baby yam, horseradish cr\u00e8me ($15): http://bit.ly/1OgSB8q\nYou can never go wrong with pork belly - pork flavored butter with a crunchy chicharron-like skin but at $5 a cube, this was overpriced. You can get a big mound of lechon kawali for less than this. \n\n- Deviled Eggs w/ smoked trout, paprika, mustard ($6.25): http://bit.ly/1PVjHlM\nMediocre compared to Marlowe/Park Tavern, Wayfare Tavern, and Hog & Rocks' deviled eggs.\n\n- Creole Shrimp w/ crispy cornmeal, scallion ($16): http://bit.ly/1W57bma\nEhhh, tasted more like an Indian dish than a Creole one. The small shrimp (5 pieces) were overcooked and rubbery, and at more than $3 a pop, it was another overpriced dish.\n\n- Shacksbury Classic Cider, ABV 6% (Draft - $9): http://bit.ly/1nmsog7\nTasted watered down.\n\nWithout a doubt, the service surpassed the food. 5 star service from the welcoming hostess, amiable and attentive server and busboy - our plates were quickly cleared and water glasses were always refilled. Kudos to them because they rocked!\n\nThe space is small and lively with seating for about 22-24 in their narrow dining area, 2 communal tables, and bar seating. There's also outdoor seating with heated lamps (yay for dog-friendly seating!). Not recommended for large groups over 6. The bathroom is located next to a two-top so it was awkward having to hover over a couple's table while waiting the restroom to become vacant. I'm sure it's far more awkward for them so do request a table away from the restroom. \n\nMaybe my friends and I visited Causwells on an off night but we thought that collectively the food was exceptionally mediocre and overrated. I felt bad for even suggesting this place for dinner because my friends came all the way from the Peninsula and South Bay. We should of went to nearby Spaghetti Bros instead. At least we could have bro'd out with the Mr. Marina contestants there... \n\nMy vote goes to Mark, the aerospace engineer holding the adorable golden retriever puppy: http://bit.ly/1lvGRnY!

We expected a wait, but were actually able to sit right away on the patio. That may have been the mistake.  I shouldn't really even call it a patio, it's just a few tables side by side out front lined up oddly along the sidewalk. My husband was facing the sun the whole time because I would have been fried, there was just no shade. On to the food. I ordered the pork hash and a coffee and my husband ordered the breakfast burger. We also ordered the smoked trout deviled eggs. The lady who brought my hash actually put a veggie hash in front of me that was meant for the table next to us (on top of us really). Which reminds me that I hated how close the tables were. Anyway, The veggie has looked good- but it wasn't mine. The lady seemed perturbed that I didn't know it wasn't mine. I also ordered a hash so it was confusing. When our order actually came, My hash was just okay. The presentation was nice, but I wished the chunks of pork were smaller. And there was a crazy amount of tots in comparison to the one tiny poached egg served atop. The breakfast burger was delicious, earning them the four stars for me. The deviled eggs lacked flavor and were frankly sour overall. My coffee was never refilled, and the service is very strange. The person who took our order was never seen again, and the people who brought our food, bill and change- all different, and took FOREVER. Now coming home and looking on yelp, it seems as though they may cater to the inside of the restaurant. Obviously in hindsight, I wish we had sat inside. My husband was miserable staring into the sun. We thought people watching would be nice, but it just wasn't worth it with no umbrellas and the closeness of your neighbors. You essentially become a part of their conversation, and that's just weird. Overall, I would suggest the breakfast burger- really tasty, very messy. Terrible service outside, which ruined it for us.

Causwells is small, but there's no excuse for the way that restroom door opens directly into the dining area.  If you insist on dining here you should also insist on a spot nearest the windows thus furthest from the restroom.  \n\nStill, on my earlier visit, I sat in the same seat and was able to say \"4 stars\" but then is not now.  \n\nA House Made Ricotta starter ($11), drizzled with honey, was pedestrian and looked like something assembled following a visit to Trader Joe's.  Shishito Peppers ($7) warranted a shrug; neither good nor bad and the same could be said for a side of Brussels Sprouts ($7.25).  I thought the only starter worth tasting was the Hushpuppies ($7.25).  If I'd sat in the front, with an order of Hushpuppies and a bottle of wine I'd have deemed the evening a success.  \n\nCauswells is known for its American Burger ($15.99) which I'd enjoyed on my previous visit but this time the burger was delivered without catsup or mustard.  Our party of 4 asked for these condiments repeatedly but a good 4 minutes passed, and much eye-rolling from my 3 tablemates, before catsup arrived and it was quite a bit longer and further requests before Dijon mustard appeared at the table.  Our burgers were lukewarm by this time.  No apologies, no explanation.  \n\nService again became an issue as we finished a Chocolate Pot de Creme ($8) and a Donut Bread Pudding ($8.25).  Plates were scooped off the table by our server without asking and then returned with an \"Oh, you're not done with it yet?\"  \n\nMy meal at Causwells felt like a fitting cap to a thoroughly depressing week.  Poor service, poor ambiance and mediocre food.  Not only did the country just buy a load of crap but so did I.", "author": "Tracey A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-26", "description": "This review is solely for the burger.\n\nAfter a few weeks of being on a limited diet, I was craving a thick, juicy burger. I don't typically eat a diet heavy in meat, carbs or dairy, but I don't typically restrict myself, either, from my cravings. My partner made us a reservation for 8PM on Thursday evening. \"You're craving a burger,\" he said. \"I'll make sure you get a burger.\" So, Causwells it was. \n\nTo be fair, I hadn't heard of this restaurant before (oops). I don't keep up on the latest in foodie news and I rarely venture to the Marina District. Although our table was ready when we arrived for our reservation, we opted to sit at the bar. The bartender behind the counter was quick to greet us and take our order. I didn't take a good look at the menu, I was there for a reason: the Americana Burger ($15.99). \n\nThe Americana Burger is exactly as you would imagine a classic, American burger to be: American cheese, lettuce, pickles and onions, topped with \"Causwells sauce\". I added avocado ($1.50). My partner ordered the same, minus avocado and pickles. The flavor combination isn't as adventurous or dynamic as say, what you would find at ROAM, but it packs a decent punch. This burger comes with two beef patties cooked medium, with all its accoutrements packed between a white, sesame bun. Not sure how I would feel about the fried onions it comes with, I ordered a side of french fries ($6) to be safe. Note: this establishment doesn't offer mayonnaise as a condiment, I asked. Ketchup and dijon mustard only!\n\nI suppose the simplicity of this burger is what makes it a 'winner', and in many ways it was. Thick, juicy and flavorful. When my partner took his non-American friend here when he was in town, his friend ordered two and came back the next day for a third, saying it was \"the best\" burger he had had in his life. I won't go to that extreme. I'll surely come around again, but I won't necessarily drive across town for this burger, either.", "author": "Kimberlee P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-24", "description": "The burger here is one of the best in San Francisco, and also made the Thrillist list of top burgers in America. I was a little wary of its accolades, so naturally I had to just try it in person to see for myself. I came here for lunch around 2:30 pm on a Saturday, so there was no wait for a table (score!). I assume that if you came during peak lunch time on a weekend, you'll have to wait for a little bit since the place is not huge. The place is fairly small, so come with 2-4 people, but they do have 2-3 tables that will accommodate 6-8 people if you have a large party.\n\nThey have a pretty decent selection for brunch: waffles, omelettes, chilaquiles, biscuits & gravy, salad, and their infamous burgers. For brunch, you can get the Brunch Burger ($15) which comes with a single beef patty, american cheese, fried egg, bacon, aioli, lettuce, pickle and onion. The size of the burger is quite generous, and not bad for $15, considering some places charge you the same price for a burger 2/3 of the size. My boyfriend got this and he really loved it -- so much that I only got a bite or two to try it, and then the rest disappeared before I even noticed.\n\nI got the Americana Burger ($15.99), which was similar to a Shake Shack where there are 2 patties with cheese in the middle, or In-N-Out double double. If you like either of those burgers, then you will like this. The burger patties are crispy on the outside, slightly thinner than most patties, and more well-done than rare. The meat is moist and the cheese makes the whole burger really tasty. They have a Causwell's Sauce which is similar to the In-N-Out sauce (almost like a thousand island), lettuce, pickles, and thinly sliced onions. It's delicious and I ate the entire thing and would have eaten more if it was bigger.\n\nMy only complaint was that the brunch burgers came with salad, and not with the crispy onion rings that I was drooling over in the photos. So if you go for brunch, make sure to ask for onion rings instead of assuming that it will come with it. I guess it's good I got salad to be on the healthier side, but I was kicking myself for not confirming that the burgers came with the onion rings. So consider yourself warned. The salad was just plain mixed greens with too much salad dressing.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic burger. The service was a tad on the slow side and I'm not sure why the people who sat down after us got their burgers before us (they had ordered the same thing, so maybe it got mixed up when the server brought it out?). There were also some gnats flying around which was distracting and a little gross. But 4.5 stars for one of the best burgers in SF. I'll definitely come back here again for this.", "author": "Christina L."}

So glad we found this place for dinner after spending some time at nearby Chrissy Park. \n\nFirst of all, the atmosphere is great. It's a well designed/styled place where you can come casually dressed and have a laid back meal. Dim lighting/candles, great music (remixed Phoenix and Ellie Goulding), marble countertops and tables. Sometimes it's just nice to be casual at a nicer restaurant. They also did a good job with maximizing the space they have. The intimate table set up just works for them. \n\nAs for the food, also great. Farm to fork, not surprisingly. We chose to sit at the bar to avoid waiting for a table. The bar is awesome, full service. We started off with the corn bread for the appetizer. It was rich and moist and had a layer of herbs baked in. Very tasty.

After seeing two open 2 table seats they couldn't just ask the people who just sat down to move so that we could get a 4 person table..no no no, they said, the table next to one of the open 2 person tables would soon be out as they already had their bill. Well news flash, they were taking their pleasant time talking and didn't even look at their bill or put any kind of payment. So instead of the easiest solution, the hostess did nothing. We waited another half hour for another group to leave to finally get seats. We were already ready to order and get going, but it took more time for the waitress to get to us to order. I wanted to die. I was so hungry. Our burger was juicy and delicious and the donut bread pudding was a downer cause it was spiced and not so great.

I tried to find a place that was \"American\" but also \"San Franciscan\".\n\nHe and I came at a weird time, so luckily avoided any kind of lunch or dinner rush. At first glance, the menu is a bit pricey, but that didn't stop us from wanting to try a bunch of things. Plus, since it's mainly tapas style, it made trying and sharing very easy.\n\nRound 1: Deviled eggs. Comes with 3 different kinds, but you can also order all of one type or all or none or anything in between if you want. The salmon was definitely my favourite, then avocado, then classic. Classic wasn't bad, it's never bad IMO, lol, but the salmon definitely had a nice kick to it\n\nIn addition to the eggs, also had lavosh. Didn't really know what it was when I ordered it. Turned out to be cracker-like bread with ricotta cheese and honey. Simple fare, but probably m favourite of all the dishes tried! Is it bad to say I'm going to try making this at home now? lol\n\nMy friend and I also tried the octopus, mainly just so I could throw something new at him that he hasn't tried before. I've had octopus before at sushi restaurants, and I found this quite similar, except that it was cooked. It was good, but nothing particularly special I think, unless my palate was just adjusted to the other food by then.\n\nFinally, there was the rainbow trout (cooked with skin, yummy crispy skin) and shrimp and grits. The shrimp and grits were my friend's favourite - I didn't notice in the description, but there was sausage or something in it as well (which I didn't mind, but my friend couldn't eat), so just FYI.\n\nI would have liked to try one of their desserts too, but I think 5 dishes for 2 people was already pushing it, haha.\n\nOn top of the delicious food, the staff was fab - very friendly and attentive, and happy to give suggestions if you're feeling confused or overwhelmed... or just want suggestions. This place is a bit further than the usual neighbourhoods I hang out in, but I definitely think I'd come back to check out the area and, of course, to come back to Causwells ;)", "author": "Bianca C."}

There was no doubt in my mind Causwells had to be my first review since I dine here at least once a week.\n\nDiving right in, this is, bar none, the BEST burger I've ever had.\n\nBefore Causwells opened their doors my favorite burger in town was the Marlowe burger. That burger, served with its magical horseradish aioli, still has a special place in my heart (quite literally); however, the Causwells burger is now what I NEED to satisfy a burger craving.\n\nIn my opinion, a great burger starts with a fresh bun, and their seeded bun has the perfect amount of softness for allowing every bite to melt in your mouth. The sauce, onion and pickle combine as outstanding complements to the juicy beef patties topped with melted American cheese!\n\nI could write an essay on the joy of taking the first bite into the most tender, flavorful burger you'll ever have, but it's just something you need to experience for yourself.\n\nIf I didn't make it clear enough, their burger is the all-star, but every dish I've eaten here has been fantastic! The staff and service have always been A+ as well.\n\n*Side note: I recommend asking for a side of ketchup with the burger--they use an all natural brand named 'Sir Kensington's' that blows Heinz ketchup out of the water.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-01", "description": "Causwells gets 5 stars not for the burger but for being a class act. On my first visit, I can only give the burger 3 stars. My purpose for coming to Causwell's was specifically for the burger. I had read quite a bit about Causwells on my Zagat email, 7x7, and Bay Area Bites. All spoke highly of the burger. And since having a great ostrich burger in Napa, I thought it was time to check out a great beef burger.\n\n Let me state the meat was excellent, great texture and crust. The problem was a lack of seasoning, no salt ( burgers love salt). Further, the special sauce was not noticeable, at least not to me. Now clearly, every kitchen has their off days, but the burger is their signature dish, so consistency is key.\n\nAfter finishing the burger, two ladies came up to me and asked me how I liked the burger? I told them It lack seasoning and I couldn't taste the sauce. Low and behold, one of the ladies was the owner. You know she took the burger off the bill. That was quite a surprise to me. Be sure, I would have been happy to pay for the burger. I actually felt guilty that I wasn't charged. Causwells is clearly a restaurant with Class.\n\nNow let me get on my soap box for a minute and talk about the lack of consistencies in restaurants. Not just Causwells, but 90 percent of most of the restaurants around. The main problem is the kitchen staff. These days when I check out a restaurant I want to see the mix of the kitchen staff. If I don't feel comfortable about the staff, I normally move on. I have to say while sitting at the bar at Causwells, before receiving my burger,  looking into the kitchen, I wasn't super confident. But as stated earlier, it was probably an off day.\n\nUnderstanding that cooking for the public is an exceedingly difficult task, it's crucial that restaurateurs hire people who have a love and passion for cooking. Unfortunately, most of the people on the line  (in the kitchen) look at their job as a chore, just labor. Thus,  inconsistencies.\n\nFrankly, I've gotten to the point where I would like to see a posting on the restaurant window of those working in the kitchen along with their experience.\n\nI will certainly return for another shot at the burger.", "author": "Anthony W."}

It was light, not too sharp and a perfect taste of things to come. \n\n2) Heirloom tomato, jimmy nardello pepper, melon vinaigrette, fried okra - These tomatoes tasted like they had been picked only seconds before. The vinaigrette was perfect and the fried okra added a nice change in texture. Another winner!\n\n3) Americana burger, cheese, Causwells sauce, pickle, chips - We came on National Cheeseburger Day so it only seemed fitting to order a burger. We split it four ways and I think my whole table agreed we could have each ate a whole one ourselves. This was one of the best I've had in awhile. I don't know what Causwells sauce is but I want some more! \n\n4) Gulf white shrimp, house made andouille, cajun gravy, Anson Mills grits - A new kind of taste added to the mix! This is exactly what I want for breakfast. Every. Single. Day. \n\n5) Grilled octopus, garbanzo, fennel, chili - I'm an octopus fan and these were thick cut pieces that were perfectly grilled, soft and chewy. \n\n6) Chilled sweet corn, jimmy nardello peppers, goat cheese - This reminded me of a dish I make at home a lot. it was great but not necessarily a not-to-be-missed dish; however, if corn and goat cheese are your favorite foods, go ahead and get it.\n\n7) Buttermilk biscuit peach short cake, pickled peaches, peach brandy sauce - The pickled peaches definitely made this dish unique. If you're not a big sweets person, this is a good dessert for you. If you do love a little sugar, opt for the next one... \n\n8) \"All-Star\" donut bread pudding, spiced milk - Ohmygoodness we're so full but can't stop eating this warm bread pudding.

Then, I came across it again while looking at Yelp's new businesses. And then, my friend and I happened to be getting ice cream sandwiches down the street, and figured we should probably eat a proper meal too. So, call it celestial guidance or whatever that led me here, but I'm glad it did!\n\nStill being a bit full from our breakfast dessert (okay, fine, it was 4pm), we stuck with their small plates, which honestly sounded more interesting than their entrees anyway: \n\n* Rye Parkerhouse Rolls & Cultured Butter - I never order bread, because I feel like it's something that should come with the meal, so this was a bit of a luxury. The rolls came in a set of four, with a simple glaze on top, and what I think was sea-salted butter. Tasty enough on its own, but even better once I realized I could make mini sliders with the brisket!\n\n* Housemade Ricotta & Lavash - I'm not usually one to order cheese plates, given the lactose intolerance and all. The ricotta was nice and smooth, with a tasty lemony zing to it, and went well with the fresh lavash crackers. If you run out (and you will, because there's a lot more cheese than cracker), bear in mind that you can ask for more.\n\n* Steak Tartare - Having tried tartare at more and more places across the city, I've found that most of them share similarities in taste. Causwells', though, was pleasantly different: not as savory or (overly) salty as most places I've been to, but lighter and fruitier instead. This definitely needs to be eaten before the brisket, because the flavors of the tartare are subtle enough that the latter will have dulled your taste buds with the in-your-face flavor.\n\n* Smoked Brisket - The star of the dishes we ordered, with great flavor (similar to corned beef) and a nice, tender texture. Be sure to eat it with all the extra sauces and accoutrements provided in the dish.\n\nI definitely see myself coming back here, if not only because I want to try their deviled eggs and octopus!\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Another venue with mixed counter and regular table seating. Of the latter, some are placed in such a way as to not be accessible, but the majority should not prove to be an issue.\n\nBathroom - Didn't check them out, but given their location in the back, you may have to ask the nearest table to get out of their chairs in order to squeeze by. I also seem to recall a divider that may make opening the door a little difficult.", "author": "Johnny W."}

Not BBQ like, more tomato flavored and fell off the bone. \n\n-Burger $16\nYes get this! I can't really say this is the best burger I've had but definitely juicy and flavorful. It's also pretty big and cheesy cause its a double. Imagine a home made Big Mac but so much better. I think the only thing I had an issue with was the bun was not warm or toasted so it got soggy in the juices. \n\nGo to Popsons for a smaller burger and half the price but just as good if you want something quick!\n\nOverall, great experience!

I went there for the beef tartare and donut pudding - and they took beef tartare off their menu, and did not serve donut pudding the night I went - why did I go there?\n\nAnyways, back to my dinner at Causwells. With a 4.5-star overall review on yelp I was expecting something really good at Causwells. It was a cute little restaurant, so it's definitely not good for big groups. I made a reservation at 6:15 pm and got seated right away. \n\nRealizing that they took beef tartare off the menu, we decided to order the devil eggs, grill octopus and pork belly confit to share. As for the main, we decided to try the burger, because the couple next to our table ordered that and it looked pretty good. \n\nI can pretty much use one word to describe my food - salty. Yes, from devil eggs to pork belly to the crispy onions that served with my burger, they were all pretty salty. The food was actually pretty good if it's not because of the over saltiness. The one dish that we enjoyed the most was the grill octopus. It wasn't salty, and the octopus was so tender! I highly recommend that dish.\n\nDevil eggs were pretty good except for the over saltiness. It was creamy and good. Pork belly confit was pretty good too (not the salty part). I liked how they paired it with the apple so you wouldn't feel too greasy.\n\nI was a little disappointed with the burger. It was alright - I wished I had ordered something else. And the side crispy onion was the most salty thing of the night. It was so salty that we couldn't eat. I did mention to our server that the onion was pretty salty, but nothing he could do I guess. \n\nSince they didn't have the donut pudding, we went with the banana bread with mascarpone and \"chocolate soup\". It was pretty good. \n\nOverall my experience at Causwells was alright. It was surely not cheap, and you could probably have some similar food elsewhere.", "author": "Louisa L."}

Furthermore, the service was very attentive -- throughout the meal, they checked on us to make sure we were happy with our food and that our water glass was full (if you want water, you need to ask them for it because of the CA drought). Based on the other reviews, I ordered the Americana burger and was satisfied with my meal. \n\nJust to be clear -- the burger was good. It was a good medium, two patties, and I was full. The onion rings were also good. Despite being fried, they don't seem overly oily or heavy, and are a great compliment to the burger. However, I don't think the overall meal was SO good that it justifies the $15.75 price. Furthermore, like other reviews have noted, the meal does get pretty salty after a while.

It's a huge burger.\n\nPros - cooked medium; two hand shaped ground beef patties; american cheese; soft burger bun.  Hand shaped ground beef burgers reminds me of fresh home cooked burgers that you make and eat at home.\n\nCons - #1.  wilted mix green salad comes with the burger.  Usually a place has several side options you to select from gratis. #2. I can't get used to places that have tables so close together.  Sure we struck a conversation with a lone lunch patron.  But I prefer more space inbetween tables.  \n\nMy friend wrote her Yelp experience here.  It seems her burger was overcooked.\n\nI'm not sure I'd come back.  Small storefront.  It seems the real estate space was more of a dive bar that got converted for the Marina District food patrons.

Here are the details:\n\nA week ago Sunday, came in around 11:30 with the parents, with a reservation. We were seated promptly and a friendly waiter got things started. A coffee, a tea and some water. Easy, right? Well, the coffee and tea arrived, but my water didn't. So I had to ask again. Then a (tiny) glass arrived.\n\nOrders placed - egg white omelette for mom, egg white omelette for stepdad, pastrami hash for me. Food seemed to be a bit slow, and I had downed my water glass quickly and asked for some more. Waiter certainly wasn't walking around filling glasses on his own initiative. \n\nMy mom's omelette comes, as does my hash, but the waiter apologizes to my stepdad (who, of the three of us, was the hungriest) and said that he messed up and didn't put in his omelette as an egg-white. He'd have a fresh one made for him. Well, that wasn't going to work - he was the hungriest, we our hot food in front of us...so if he waited, we wouldn't even eat together. He told the waiter not to throw out the bad order and he'd eat it. \n\nI would understand if this was the only egg-white omelette order at our table...but my mom ordered one too. It shouldn't be that hard to get that right. I think both of my parents thought their food was fine, and I happily scarfed down their salads. My pastrami hash was disappointing - it was about 65-70% potatoes, with the rest eggs and pastrami. I understand pastrami costs the most, but couldn't I have gotten some more eggs at least?\n\nI was ready for another glass of water, and after asking, it didn't arrive and I had to ask again. I looked at the table next to us - served by the same waiter - and the couple there had a full carafe of water sitting there. If I'm asking for water constantly, wouldn't you think maybe you'd leave a carafe there for me?\n\nThe final dish was the doughnut bread pudding. It was by far the highlight of the meal, and also - fortunately - the end of it. The food, by itself, was worth 3 stars, maybe 3+ (counting my parents' dishes). But the service keeps me from considering a return engagement.", "author": "David B."}

We were promptly seated in the little booth at the front by the window.\n\nOrdered the trio of devilled eggs, the beef tartare and the salmon. \n\nThe devilled eggs were pretty tasty and it was unique that each one was different. I think one was topped with smoked fish so that was an interesting combination! \n\nThe beef tartare was good but not exceptional. The meat was slIghtly browned so may have been prepared some time ahead of being served. I'm afraid my favourite beef tartare in the city still goes to Lolinda! \n\nThe salmon was excellently prepared and cooked- crispy on the outside but really juicy on the inside. Went really well with the bed of warm corn that it was served on. Highly recommend! \n\nFor desert we ordered the chocolate deco cake. I think the top half was a chocolate cheesecake and the bottom half a chocolate sponge cake, all covered in chocolate fondant with sea salt on top! This was tasty but super rich- my fianc\u00e9 and I managed half of it and boxed the rest to go. \n\nOverall we had a nice meal at Causwell's with attentive, friendly service. I would say that the deviled eggs and beef tartare are overrated here- they are pretty simple dishes that in my opinion are executed better at other restaurants in the city. The salmon on the other hand was perfect and definitely worth coming back for!", "author": "Steph A."}

I came here for a pre-valentines day dinner because valentines day = torture, and the meal was amazing!

And may have gotten some semi-disgusted stares from the very \"marina girl\" table next to us. SORRY IT WAS ALL DELICIOUS. \n\nWe started out splitting the grilled octopus and the shrimp/gritsdishes and they were both fantastic! The octopus had a perfect char/seasoning but it was a little bit rubbery for my liking (i've been tainted by Europe and don't know if I will find anything comparable in the states).  The sausage worked in perfectly with the shrimp/polenta and we liiiiicked that plate clean. \n\nGreens w/Avocado mousse were ordered to be healthy-ish. They were super fresh and a nice change of pace in the meal. \n\nI ordered the short ribs for my dinner and oooooooooomgggg they were fall apart amazing! I finished about half of my plate before having to tap out.  The bf ordered the burger and didnt let me snag a bite so I'm assuming it was amazing. The little cripsy fries that came with the burger were fun. \n\nOverall great casual dining experience in the marina!

The only disconcerting was (after eating) watching the kitchen staff and head cook handling and preparing food without gloves. This was really bothersome when the Head Cook kept wiping the sweat off his face and scratching his hair. Never once could I see him washing his hands. It also looked like he was using the same rag to wipe off tools. After taking the bacon off a cookie sheet(using his hand) he would then use the spatula to push the discarded paper into the garbage.

This place was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had (top 3, at least). It tasted amazing and nearly melted in your mouth. I ordered mine with mushrooms and bacon and had the sauce on the side. The meat itself was flawless and had hints of garlic (I think). The mushrooms were not traditional chopped mushrooms but came with the stems. I found this interesting because it added another texture to the burger. The burger came with a salad that was pretty good - just a little heavy on the dressing. The onion strings or whatever they're called were excellent. Not greasy and pretty light. I really don't have any complaints about this place but I do think the decor could have been better. It's a little unfriendly and unwelcoming. If a friend had not brought me here today, I don't think this place would attract me as I walked by on the street. When you eat here be prepared to hear the conversation of the party next to you.

I could have gone to someplace in SOMA and would have found the same items on the menu that tasted the same\n\nI did like the concept of the plates to be shared family style, as it allowed us to try many different items.   From the appetizers and entrees that we shared, the ones that I would call out were the arugala salad and the trout dish.    The trout was cooked and seasoned perfectly. \n\nI am glad that I got to try Causwells as I can check it off my Hot list.", "author": "Marck N."}

The restaurant was bustling at about 8:00 pm but we were still able to get a table pretty quickly. \n\nWe ordered the ricotta and honey appetizer, which was just delicious. The ricotta was so creamy and flavorful. This dish prompted me to try recreating it with lavender honey made at home, but their version was so much better. I had the octopus for my meal and it was also very good with lots of interesting flavors and a nice bed of greens. It was also perfectly cooked and not rubbery at all. I wanted a few more bites since it was so tasty. I would return just to order that dish.\n\nMy husband had a burger with onion strings and loved it. He has high burger standards and was quite pleased. We finished off the meal with the donut bread pudding, which was tasty but very sweet (probably a little too sweet for me). \n\nWhy four stars? Maybe I just can't get over how expensive San Francisco is but I think their prices were high for the serving sizes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-31", "description": "The thing I liked most about Causwells was the cute, intimate atmosphere. They succeed in creating a cozy European bistro-feel to the restaurant. It'd be a good date spot, but also a nice place to grab a quieter drink at the bar in the sometimes crazy Marina. \n\nFood-wise, it's not the easiest spot for vegetarians, but there are options. I went with a friend and we ordered dinner entrees and no appetizers, but the appetizers have a few veg options (salads, house made ricotta, etc.). There was one dinner entree that was veg - Hen of Woods Mushrooms, including: mushroom, fava bean, quinoa and pistachio. To be fair, I went relatively hungry. The serving size is good, but not massive, so I'd order a side if you get this dish and are on the hungrier side. The flavors were really neat in this dish though. The fava bean was blended, so the texture was quite smooth and a nice, bright green color. The quinoa portion was smallish, but well-flavored/herbed. The mushrooms were very large and had to be cut with a knife. These were not as well-seasoned, but good if taken in a bite with other flavors on the plate. The pistachio (very minimal on the dish), added a nice crunch and salty flavor. I also ordered a side of broccoli rabe, which the menu noted was cooked with garlic and chili. The broccoli was quite flavorless though. I'd see a chili flake or two, but it mostly tasted like stewed broccoli.\n\nFor dessert, we split the chocolate pot de creme. The menu says this is with coconut and sea salt. It certainly had a very deep chocolate flavor to it. The salt was very present (coconut wasn't really at all), and while it added a sharp contrast to the deepness of the chocolate, I think a creme topping would be a better contrast and cut the bitterness of the chocolate a bit more. Something was weird about the chocolate, where it seemed to have a wetness to it - can't explain that quite too well, and it didn't really takeaway from it, but I've certainly had better chocolate desserts before. At least the dark chocolate satisfied my chocolate need a bit.\n\nService was present but not too friendly. Quite the opposite of the European bistro feel, as she seemed to keep pushing us a bit, even though the restaurant was pleasantly busy but not packed and no one was waiting. Food and drinks came out promptly though.\n\nOverall, I think it's a better spot for meat eaters than vegetarians, but the restaurant itself is quite cute, and could certainly be a good spot for drinks and appetizers before going elsewhere in the neighborhood for a main course.", "author": "Jackie W."}

Needless to say she was a little peeved about that, but hey what can you do right? This unfortunate circumstance is not the reason for the low rating.  The customer service was exceptional! Our server was extremely polite and engaging and managed to tactfully wrangle and conquer the monster that had come of my food deprived girlfriend... I was rather impressed, it was like we had a \"eat a snickers\" moment.  They even comped our desert in exchange for their shortage in stock. \n\nHowever customer service is a secondary concern when I'm at a restaurant.  Primarily I am concerned with the quality of the food, that's what I'm paying for.  The food was questionable at best.\n\nI ordered the jerked spiced chicken, cream corn and quinoa.  The chicken was tender and cooked extremely well, however it was bland to put it nicely.  The chicken had ZERO flavor, let alone spice. I was extremely let down by this. I understand playing it safe and not taking chances with bold flavors... But this dish completely lacked any sort of flavor.\n\nMy girlfriend had the baby back ribs, napa slaw, with nectarine BBQ sauce. Once again, meat cooked to near perfection but lacking any seasoning.  The BBQ sauce, also lacking flavor, was nothing more than an additional glaze to coat the meat with. The Napa slaw was a little too acidic for her liking.\n\nThe bread pudding we had came with a spiced milk sauce.  This was by far the best thing we had all night.  The texture was like a cake donut, but the sliced milk softened it although not to the point of sogginess.  We thought they executed this to perfection.\n\nAlso another patron sitting in front of us sent their steak back for being under cooked. All things considered I don't know if they had a fill in in the back but the kitchen was not on its \"A\" game that Memorial Day weekend.  On the front end of this review I gave this place a 2 star rating because they simply failed miserably at the bigger more important things.

He was at his gym before dawn the same day we went and was so focused on his trainer that he didn't notice this restaurant gem. Causwells been open 6 months and beautifully renovated.\n\nThe menu is divided into snacks, small plates, heartier fare, and sides. We ordered butternut squash soup, radish, pumpkin seeds and almonds; and roasted beets, baby garnet yams, pistachio vinaigrette, gribiche from the small plates list. I was not a big soup fan, but now I am. It looked beautiful and the taste matched the esthetics. I like beets, but Chef Adam Rosenblum's combination was outstanding. At first I told my dining companion I wouldn't eat half because I wanted to pace myself for the \"heartier fare\". I ate more than half and my only complaint was I wanted some bread to sop up the delicious sauce.\n\nWe ordered separate heartier fares, our waitperson Aaron, suggested the lager brined chicken breast with dirty rice, lager jus and I had the Americana burger, sans cheese, with Causwells sauce, pickles, and crispy onions. They cook it medium well which is not how I usually order my burger. Let's just say, Chef Adam knows best.\n\nFor \"sweet treats\" we split the banana bread with mascarpone and Mexican hot chocolate. Tom described it as banana bread with grilled cheese you could dip in chocolate soup. Didn't sound edible to me, but again foodies are adventurous and it worked very well.\n\nCauswells also features \"Original Bette Jane's Ginger Beer\" made and distributed locally and Cedarburg Rooibos tea from South Africa, a favorite of the late great President Mandela.\n\nGreat service, great food, great atmosphere. Can't wait to go back.

Actually, all three of us went with the burger. \n\nAnd what a great decision it was.\n\nSeriously. I had this burger six days ago and I am trying to come up with reasons to go back. It was just really good. The bun was good. The insides was good. The side salad, as basic as it was, was good. It was just all good.

And, frankly, rude. Not a good start.\n\nThe server was nice, but when my two friends rolled in with paper coffee cups (OK, maybe this isn't kosher, I don't know) she looked at them and asked if they wanted coffee. Then when they said no thanks, she said \"don't worry, we don't have a corkage.\" I'm with you, lady. But the snarkiness abounds. \n\nThe food was fine. Just fine.

The shishito peppers weren't cooked correctly; it wasn't charred and didn't have any bite left (super mushy).  I'm pretty sure they roasted the peppers in an oven that wasn't hot enough.   The worse part of the meal by far was the cheeseburger.  Right after the first bite my bf and I almost had to spit it out.

My smoked trout salad was actually very good, but small in portion and pricey for what you get; I wouldn't order this again, because I know I can get an equally delicious and more filling one at La Boulange.\n\nThe biscuits and gravy were a sore disappointment; flavor was one-dimensional, and the biscuits were thin, not big and fluffy.  I honestly would rather go to IHOP and pay half the price for a more hearty, fatty meal.  It came with a tiny side salad.\n\nService was okay, not overly friendly.

We have been looking for a new restaurant in the Marina area to make our \"go to spot\" and we have certainly found it. The food, atmosphere and restaurant team are all amazing. \n\nThe Food - The food at Causwells is terrific. In the few times we have been in, we have tried the steak, the burger, the chicken, the octopus and the heirloom tomato salad - all are FANTASTIC! Each portion is adequate size to share and all are a refreshing take on traditional favorites.\n\nThe Atmosphere - Dining at Causwells is a fantastic evening out. I am not usually the type of person who lingers over dinner - when I eat at Causwells, I deliberately eat slow so I can enjoy the atmosphere and crowd. It has a really vibrant feeling and is very easy to spend a lot of time eating with friends or a date. \n\nThe Team - Both of the owners, Tom and Alvin are in the restaurant on weekend nights and spend their time interacting with the patrons. It has been fantastic getting to know them and I will definitely try any other restaurants they open. Both have been great about recommending dishes and have been nice enough to offer to take stuff back if we didn't enjoy them (we have LOVED every one of their suggestions). The bar staff is also fantastic - they make great recommendations and are awesome to talk to. \n\nWe are looking forward to spending many more nights eating at Causwells and trying out their lunch and brunch as well.", "author": "Samir M."}

(it's also the only thing i've ever tried on multiple visits there).\n\nThey've nearly taken all the components of the original (i.e. 2 all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun), and gussied it up so that you're definitely getting your $16 worth. The only component they didn't bother to translate was the middle bun.\n\nThe meat patties are seasoned well and juicy. The cheese is melty and combines nicely with the flavors of the meat patties. Their nod to the McD's special sauce is close to the McD's version and very good. It brings everything together (and is actually really nice as a dipping sauce for the crispy onions that garnish the dish). Overall, one of the best burgers you can find in San Francisco. If you're a Big Mac lover, your mind will probably explode (mine nearly did).\n\nThe only thing that kept me from giving this a 5 star review was the service. On one occasion we were seated outside, and perhaps due to how busy it was inside the house, we felt a little neglected. Having the server follow up periodically and the wait time for getting and paying the check were delayed. I did not experience this while dining inside the restaurant, but thought that this was worth pointing out.\n\nThe atmosphere makes Causwells a great place to take a date or even hang with the buddies before heading out for a late night. It's a little dimly lit which can be seen as a little intimate and romantic and it's such a classy interior that you wouldn't feel out of place if you dressed up a little bit. (You also don't have to order the burger, as the rest of their fare looks on par with $30 plate establishments). But at the same time, it has quite a casual vibe that you can definitely stay for a few drinks with your friends, while enjoying burgers in your favorite t-shirt and pair of jeans.\n\nI'll definitely be coming here for as long as the Americana Burger is on the menu.", "author": "Jeffrey J."}

There should be no excuse for mediocrity in this segment, because we are blessed with local farms and great meats and fish, and there are plenty of similar restaurants for budding chefs to test recipes at. \n\nCauswells touts itself as using the freshest ingredients, but in this case we found little truth in advertising.  Both the ingredients and the cooking were subpar on our visit. \n\nThe steak tartare was clearly oxidized after sitting out long (probably in the fridge)  and the beef was stringy. The staff should check out Gaspar or Alexanders for a reminder of what tartar should look and taste like. \n\nThe meat in the burger tasted slightly rancid, and it was overcooked (the server didn't ask how we wanted it done) and then paired with a bun that was still cold on top and charred underneath.... clearly just out of the fridge and onto a grill that was too hot.  \n\nShisito peppers were not properly roasted or charred and a little gelatinous on the inside. There should be no excuse for misexecuting these as they are really easy to cook (check out Skool for example). \n\nThe meal was surprisingly poor given the pedigree of the chef, who was formerly the sous at flour+water.  \n\nPerhaps we just got unlucky and caught the restaurant on a bad day, but the meal had multiple missteps and notably, the servers made no attempt to get feedback after we repeatedly abandoned eating dish after dish.\n\nUPDATE: I got a graceful note from the chef after posting this review, and was encouraged to see that he is committed to continuously improving the menu and dining experience.

I've actually had quite a few items from here already that I highly recommend!\n\nSmall Plates:\n-Smoked Brisket - ridiculously delicious.  There's this onion jam that is fantastic - awesome small plate to share\n-Octopus - I'm usually not a fan of our 8-legged friend per the texture, but damn... this was spot on!  Try it!\n-Steak Tartare - seconds please?  They had two versions at their pop ups prior to opening, one grass fed, one not, and they chose to use the grass fed version... it really didn't matter because they are both off the hook!  If you're a fan of tartare or not, can't go wrong here.  *Quail egg is an excellent touch and addition*\n-Deviled Eggs - you can choose between 3 different styles/options... I chose all 3... :)\n-House made ricotta, rosemary honey, lavosh - the chef, Adam, came from Flour + Water and apparently makes everything in-house and picks up everything daily and locally... quality and deliciousness stand out\n-Beet and Citrus Salad - fantastic... awesome, healthy choice, great to share (or eat alone) and I can see this being a very popular item when they get their patio open for outdoor dining.\n\nMain Dishes:\n-Trout - I shared this dish.  Can't say it was great because it was EXCELLENT.  Never had trout prepared by a restaurant, but I'm extremely happy my date chose this.  We shared it.  Brown butter with the lemon and herb was spot on.\n-Burger - \"Traditional\" American Burger - brioche, cheese, Causwells homemade sauce, and chips.  Shared this dish with a friend and it was very fulfilling!\n\nDessert:\nBread Pudding - omfg this is like crack... I've never done crack... but one can assume... I don't even like Bread Pudding, but I've had this 3 times from here already... don't judge me until you try it yourself :)\n\nI'd recommend doing an app, small plate or two, share a main dish, then grab a dessert.  Wine and beer only, but their options are really fantastic... lots of beer bottle choices you should definitely check out (beyond what's on the taps) and the wine list was filled with lots of options too!", "author": "Brett B."}

Like most of the other reviewers, we came specifically to check out this so-called famous burger. Burger was pretty good but the bun got very soggy very fast and I've definitely had many better burgers in the city (ahem..Nopa). \n\nService was impeccable but we felt the food came out way too fast - we only had a sip of our beers before it arrived which then left us feeling sort of rushed. \n\nGreat ambiance, I'd like to give them another try for other menu items or brunch.", "author": "Alexis T."}

The restaurant itself is situated in a residential area, so it actually has a very neighborhood-friendly feel to it despite the excellent decor. \n\nI sat down at around 5:30PM, which means that the place was still relatively empty. The waitstaff was exceptionally friendly and helpful and greeted me immediately. Since I wasn't in the mood for a huge dinner, I ordered several small plates. I had the little gems salad and the calamari, both of which were excellent. My waiter (whom, I might add, was quite handsome) recommended a nice glass of white wine. I topped it off with a slice (or should I say a block) of the chocolate cake. This is not for the faint of heart. I couldn't exactly finish it on my own so I had it to go. \n\nThis is overall an excellent restaurant that I would revisit as well as recommend to friends.", "author": "Olivia Z."}

The food was good, but the experience became a nightmare when the waitress \"lost\" my credit card.  I went on to pay and she gave me the receipt without the card, she insisted that she had given me the card back, which she didn't. Took everything out of my purse three times and it wasn't there.  My boyfriend and I walked all over the restaurant a few times and it wasn't on the floor. Called the manager and he didn't do anything, just without any worry said \"just give me your number and I call you when we find it\". Really? I had just arrived in SanFran, I'm a tourist, and I'll just wait until they call me if they find my credit card? So for the rest of my vacation I'll be with no credit card and only with the $200 cash that I had brought. I would have expected more from a manager after the fact that it was their employee who lost my credit card in less than a minute.  I immediately called my bank to have the credit card cancelled and the restaurant flagged.  A day or two later they called and said they \"found it\" on the floor.... Really sketchy when the place is super small, we walked around the restaurant a few times and the card was not on the floor. Make your own judgement, but in my opinion, it doesn't add up that my credit card was \"lost and found on the floor\".  Needless to say, my vacation in SanFran started on the wrong foot.", "author": "Nancy T."}

We took a seat at the bar and immediately started a dialogue with the bartender.  I described the type of white wine I like (creamy, buttery, smooth) and he suggested a wine right away.  He nailed it.\n\nWe weren't sure what to order so we asked for some suggestions (vegetarian options only).  We were given the deviled eggs, the ricotta lavosh plate and the french toast bites for dessert.  The eggs were delicious...honestly, better than what my mom makes - which is saying a lot (but don't tell her)!  The ricotta was the one item that I was not too eager about trying but turned out to be so good!  The cheese was creamy and there was a bit of honey mixed in to give it a sweetness that was unexpected.  The French Toast Bites are not something I would normally order but after promising to try one bite, I ended up eating at least 3 more!  The syrup that they were served with really made the dish.\n\nBased on our great service, great food and great drink selections, I would definitely recommend this place to others!", "author": "Melissa R."}

But what really ties it all together for me are the wonderful owners and chef - each one has brought the best of their past experiences to the table to create such a wonderful dining experience. They know what they are doing and always have time to say hi to each person they know or don't know. \n\nFood I have had thus far:\nDeviled eggs: 3 different bites that each deliver a unique taste.  Classic, avocado & smoked trout (my favorite) lol if I could order this everyday I probably would. Great way to get my protein in ;) \n\nAsparagus: the combination of asparagus, mushrooms, egg and the cheese 'teleme' go so well together. I have never had the cheese before but it is soft, creamy and delish! It's like breakfast but for dinner lol \n\nI have also had the steak tartare & sweet corn. Do I really have to say it?! So good!!!

It's a fairly new place so I don't want to be too critical, but the vibe needs a little work. The decor is awfully hard so it gets extremely loud, not bad if you want to sit at the bar and have a few drinks/snacks but too much if you're trying to sit down with a group for dinner. I'm also not sure why they have an open view to the kitchen, the tile reminds me of an old locker room......kind of gross\n\nThe wine and beer list is great. An awesome selection of local beer and a lot of variety, my fianc\u00e9 was very pleased. I've been really pleased with most everything we have ordered for food. I feel like deviled eggs are a bit of slowing fad since so many upscale \"taverns\" have opened in SF within the last few years. That doesn't mean I don't like them, and the smoked trout deviled eggs at Causwells were awesome. We've also tried the smoked brisket (loved it), grilled octopus (see comment on deviled eggs), pork terrine, and salad. Pork terrine was the only thing I didn't care for. We've also ordered the burger twice now, and boy is it good. I highly recommend it, very juicy and flavorful.\n\nThe great thing about this place is the quality of food for a fairly reasonable price, it's what a neighborhood restaurant should be like. I feel this is a great place to grab some drinks and a few casual bites of food. A few improvements are needed on the inside but since they just opened I think they will come around.

If I were to rate each item separately, it would be thusly:\n\n- Food: 4 stars\n- Ambience: 4 stars\n- Service: 2 stars.\n\nThe meal started out well. The octopus salad was stunning. The sliced octopus was surprisingly tender and went well with the lemon based dressing. The new gems salad was nothing to write about, just a salad. I have to say, the Rye Parkerhouse Rolls & Cultured Butter were outstanding, freshly baked and steaming hot. The butter was soft and quickly melted on the rolls. \n\nAmong the entrees, the salmon was outstanding. They crisped the skin and allowing the rest of the slice cook through but stopping in time for the middle to remain rare. The steak was ....\n\nWell, here is where we start talking about the negatives. While the steak was done perfectly medium rare with a sprinkle of grimalata over some roasted vegetables and potatoes - it took two tries to reach this perfection. YES - TWO TRIES!\n\nMy wife's salmon came out and the server said my steak would be done in a few minutes. We waited, and we waited, and we waited. Finally, the owner, Alvin Garcia, delivered the dish. By then, my wife had finished her dish. \n\nThe owner was profusely apologetic (I would have taken off more stars if he wasn't). He explained that during the shift change there was a mixup on the order and my plate just sat there slowly becoming medium instead of medium rare. He was proactive and said that he had already told the cook to place another steak for me and the medium steak I had in front of me was just so I would have something to eat and I don't even have to eat it. They would box it up for me when my properly cooked steak was served. I nibbled at the luke-warm dish waiting for the new order.\n\nIt finally arrived and I wish I could say the wait was worth it. It was really good, but by then the sour taste in my mouth was not coming from the food.\n\nThe owner returned, sincerely apologized, and offered to pay for our entrees and offered us a dessert free of charge.\n\nHis concern and obvious consternation over what happened and what he did to try and ameliorate the situation are the only reasons I didn't opt for two stars.\n\nSo we walked out with a smaller bill than expected and a box of medium-cooked steak which went well with fried rice the next day.

I'm normally not a burger order-er in a restaurant but glad I broke tradition and tried Causwell's...one of the best burger's I've had!  The pilsner brined chicken breast the next night might be my favorite though and I loved the Dirty Rice, Corn w/goat cheese, beet & quinoa, and the ricotta with rosemary honey & lavosh plates. Two weeks later it's all still fresh in my memory. Usually my meal memory is very short but not this time.  \n\nIf I had to give any negative it would be on a busy fri/sat night, when the place is packed there'll probably be a small line to use the bathroom (there's only a single 1-person bathroom on premises) and sometimes the bartender is in the weeds and some extra patience is required waiting on drinks. They only have a beer/wine license (great selections of those though) so if hard spirits are your thing you'll have to wait till after dinner when you bounced over to your next spot to get your fix. \n\nGreat energy in Causwells & the staff was warm and friendly.

When we arrived, the table that was planned for us was still occupied by another party and the hostess was incredibly apologetic. My friend and I were completely fine waiting for a bit, and what made the wait so enjoyable was the hostess brought over grapefruit mimosas for the both of us...on the house for the longer than expected wait! Once we were seated, the server brought us over their house ricotta with lavash, also on  the house! Everyone there was very attentive and sweet, and I would certainly come back.

We went on a Saturday evening without a reservation and we were seated instantly at the bar. We ordered the conch fritters to start (amazing,) the burger with bacon (the bacon is to die for), and a side of corn bread (also outstanding!) The actual patty was so juicy and tender, it literally melted in your mouth. Here's where it went wrong, I had asked for my burger to be plain because I'm an extremely plain gal & as per usual the burger didn't come out plain. I wasn't going to complain cause I was starving, but then I realized there wasn't any bacon (which is an additional charge.) When I informed the bartender about the bacon he straight up told me he didn't ring in my order correctly. He later brought me a side of bacon and ended up not charging us for my burger!

Apart from being in a great location in the Marina (super close to Marina blvd, which is great for a post-burger walk), Causewells feels like a small neighborhood spot that is always full (definitely suggest calling ahead for reservations) but welcoming. Everything on the menu is great, but the burger is just exceptional, as well as the side of crispy onions. The burger and onions is the perfect sized meal and extremely delicious.

So amazing. Pork rich and beautifully balanced by the sauce and salad. My friend had the banana bread with hot chocolate dessert.

We planned Sunday brunch and enjoyed prompt seating outside on a beautiful day. The food menu was very limited, but the bar side was robust. Small plates and expensive - that would be ok if the quality was there. We did not find value given the adequate, but unremarkable quality of the food and service. We ordered the cheeseburger, deviled eggs, omelette, biscuits and gravy and pastrami hash with an extra egg and a scrambled side egg. The  hash had only a few pieces of meat and was mostly fat. The biscuits were thin and lacked flavor. Sausage gravy was unremarkable. Deviled eggs were very good - especially the bite with trout - at $6 for 1 1/2 eggs we felt over priced. Service was cordial, but we had problems with our order. We ordered a side scrambled egg for our 1 year old and asked that it be brought out first. It was not served at all without prompting and then only after all other food had been delivered but still no egg. The hash was ordered with a second egg and that too was not delivered and we had to ask for it also only to have it brought late.

We ordered two small plates, one large and a side dish, which was plenty for the two of us:\n- Brisket ($14, small plate) was the best dish.  Absolutely delicious, very tender, the onion jam and spicy mustard were great accompaniments. \n- Little gems salad ($11, small plate).  Fresh, high quality ingredients, light vinaigrette. \n- Roasted carrots ($7, side dish).  Tasty but Outerlands still does the best roasted veggies in the city.  Price seemed high for the portion size.\n- Rock cod (instead of the trout; $21.50); came with the corn salad side.  Pretty good, ever-so-slightly fishy.\n\nThe wines by the glass were interesting and the three that we tried were all delicious.  Prices are (from memory) in the $9-$14 range.  They also had a nice beer list.\n\nService was attentive and friendly (SO much better than Commissary) though our dishes all came out very quickly.  We were in and out in just over 30 minutes.\n\nThe major downside is the ambiance.  It's like having a nice dinner in a frat house.  Loud, loud, LOUD (yes, loud even for SF).  The bare concrete posts and floors don't help.  The space is small and noise from the bar pervades the entire restaurant. The night that we were there, the clientele was mostly loud 20-somethings.\n\nThe overall feel is more Marina bar than nice restaurant - best for a drink before or after the movies.

I had their burger which came highly recommended by the server but did not finish it. It was a bit too salty and the patties were a bit too well done - they wouldn't cook it med-well... Something to do with the thinness of the patties. We left feeling unsatisfied. For the price we paid, there are plenty of other more casual places that would serve great food. The service was above average here though.", "author": "Jesse D."}

My friend and I came in on a Sunday afternoon, around 2pm. It wasn't crowded and there were lots of tables open. We were promptly seated by hostess, a blonde girl with hipster glasses, who said nothing to us other than asking, \"Two?\" Then we waited. We watched three servers pass us by, none of them acknowledged us. We watched the hostess walk around and clean up the tables around us (very slowly). After five minutes of waiting for someone to come and acknowledge us, or just say that someone would be with us soon, we asked the hostess, who was near our table, if we could have some water. \"Yeah,\" was the curt response we got. After seven minutes we finally got a little water and a server. Our server, was very smiley when she was around...which was twice (once to take the order and once to give us the bill). The hostess had an attitude like her shit didn't stink and the servers seemed aloof. Honestly, the food was good, but there are a lot of good restaurants in SF with better service. It's good thing Causwells has other people and publications who praise it, but my friend and I certainly won't be recommending it to our friends or our editors.", "author": "D S."}

Getting a reservation is a bit tough, especially on the weekends but my husband and I went on a Monday at 8pm and that worked out perfectly. They have some outside seating with heat lamps. They did a wonderful job with the space! It really looked amazing. It's on the smaller side but they really made it work to their advantage. Our table was not quite right when we got there so we sat at the beautiful bar and had a glass of wine. The bar tender and the hostess worked really well together to get us seated quickly. We had a great corner spot that looked out at the passerby's on Chestnut. Our server was truly  lovely. We ordered deviled egg trio which comes with one classic one, one smoked trout one(my fave!) and one avocado one. All were delicious. We also got a side of crispy potatoes to share between the two of us. I ordered the grilled octopus over fennel and fresh garbanzos! It was so good and surprisingly filling. My husband got the cheese burger and he said it was fantastic. We skipped on the dessert(we are chocolate lovers and they didn't have anything chocolate desserts that night). Great experience. We will definitely be back! I want to try the shrimp and grits next time! yum", "author": "Whitney S."}

After getting the pretentious cold shoulder with my family at A1 on Chestnut, we walked directly across the street to Causwells, and boy, did A1 ever do us a favor.  We were greeted as if they genuinely desired us to dine in their charming restaurant adjacent to the Presidio Theater.  Open for less than a year, this place has customer service at it's highest level down pat.  Rightly known for it's juicy American Burger & onion strings, we also sampled wonderful devilled eggs (3 styles), perfect liver p\u00e2t\u00e9, and tasty squash on faro.  We were even presented with a fantastic & complimentary honey & rosemary  ricotta spread with flat bread chips.  I wish we had room for the great looking deserts (bread & rice puddings), but alas the belt already had to be loosened.  The waiter was super helpful & polite, the owners made the rounds to the tables, and the whole staff seems so happy to be there.  The beer & wine selection are noteworthy and the prices very reasonable.  I cannot over emphasize the fun & wonderful experience we had here.  Two thumb's up for this gem of an establishment.", "author": "Herb S."}

It was 2PM and they were serving only brunch and I found a menu bit limiting. Overall, the food was good and I really enjoyed smoked trout salad. However, our kids not so much. My son ordered eggs & bacon and shortly after they let us know they don't have bacon. Ok, fine let's chose any other meat (sausage,ham, etc.) BUT they don't have any and they offered to replace it with greens ? How can place that serves brunch can have only one type of meat and run out of it ? Even if he does, there is a butcher right across the street and several stores block away. This definitely spoiled otherwise decent experience.", "author": "Damir S."}

Above all else, I appreciate the impeccable service I've gotten every time I've gone.  \nTrying to find a table on Chestnut street during the peak hours (brunch time on weekends and Fri/Sat night dinner) is enough to make us want to just eat at home.  That said, every time we've come to Causwells -whether for brunch, or dinner, with reservations or without, the host staff has been incredibly accommodating.  I've come with my infant son in the stroller (we made a reservation ahead of time) and they were wonderful about giving us a table where our little guy could sit \"with us\" in his stroller.  Just the other night, my husband and I had movie tickets and wanted to grab a bite to eat before the show.  We walked up and down Chestnut, putting our name in at several places where we were quoted a 20 minute wait.  45 minutes later, we had only an hour until the movie and decided to try Causwells. I called the host as we were walking over and asked if it would be possible to get us in.  She was fabulous!  She got us 2 seats in the \"bar area\" at the window, and we were seated and ordered our food within 5 minutes of getting to the restaurant.\nOh, and the food is decadent deliciousness.  Our favs include the homemade  ricotta, the deviled egg trio (the trout is the BEST!) and the gooey, cheesey burger.  Yum!  For brunch, my husband had a corned beef hash that has yet to be topped by ANY brunch item anywhere else.", "author": "Jessica G."}

My bff and I were walking over to the Palace of Fine Arts, and I was famished although he would have been happy with a taco truck.  Instead he yelped the area we were in, as I window shopped on Chestnut Street. Voila!  Causwells came up as the best thing nearby and so he quickly made an online reservation as most of the eateries we had passed before then had long lines.  Well, seven minutes later we were escorted to our corner table and the place was hopping but mellow for a Sunday early bite to eat.  Some families and a few couples were situated around us, all with happy faces, draft beers and wine glasses strewn amongst the curious looking plates: deviled eggs, chicken liver toasts, beet salads, and the like.  Jared, our adorable bday celebrating waiter, suggested the squash soup and fresh ricotta with rosemary infused honey.  The latter was the best appetizer I have had in years--ripe cheese with a twist of freshly ground pepper, delectable honey and just the right amount of crackers (sort of an olive oil wonton-shaped affair; it was crunchy and savory and perfect for said boyfriend who wasn't really hungry.  We moved on to the short ribs, which were marinated in beer, although I was so enjoying my prankster ale that I didn't care why these ribs were tender, and sweet and yummy.\n\nI love great food that is both affordable and non-fetishized.  All around us chatted us up about what we were eating.  And when we bumped into the neighborhood couple, some hipsters from Sacramento, on the way into the Palace Theatre, the venue staffer said she always has the burgers  at Causwells: brunch, lunch and dinner.  I obviously will have to go back.  Just great.  Smart waiter.  Sassy chef.  Happy eating!", "author": "Leslie F."}

The restaurant was packed, but I was seated on time, which is very important to me, and the whole reason I make reservations. Then we (sorta accidentally) met one of the owners, Alvin, who spoke so enthusiastically and passionately about the food, we were all dreamy-eyed and excited when we returned to our menus. Then we asked our server about HIS favorites, and adorably, and promisingly, he listed several *completely different items*, with the same depth of knowledge and the same excitement. How great is that? I was with my very favorite foodie friends, who tend to over-order. And I'm using over-order as a euphemism for \"order 90% of the menu\" so really...we sampled a LOT. And we were all SO glad we did. We had the shishito peppers, deviled eggs, house-made ricotta, burger, chicken, heirloom tomato salad, octopus, plus shrimp-and-grits with perfectly-cooked tender shrimp. Frankly, this is one of the few places where I am so convinced of the chef's talent, I'd try just about any dish he served up. (It's Adam Rosenblum, I looked it up.) I enjoyed my ros\u00e9, and my friends enjoyed their GSM and Tempranillo. So basically you can't go wrong if you get a wine recommendation. Definitely give this restaurant a try. It's on fire.", "author": "Karen Z."}

Also I am not a fan of their bacon which is cured in house but tasted unlike any other bacon I've ever had (and I only eat nitrate free, from butcher shop, etc).
