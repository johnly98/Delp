The hostess was very friendly but she seemed a little confused about the flow of seating and it seemed like they were low on menus. We were seated and given 2 menus, and a few minutes later she came by to take one of them for another table. I noticed this happening to others throughout the evening. \n\nOur server was friendly, but being on the patio, it seemed like he was in charge of the whole outside so we didn't see him often.

Though fine, it also wasn't spectacular, and though the location and the patio setting were really pretty, as a whole I wasn't exactly floored with the food considering its pricepoint.\n\nOysters ($1 Happy Hour per Oyster) - (Fun fact- It was also my first time having oysters! So yay, shoutout to that.)\n Well seeing as it was my first time having oysters, I didn't really have a gauge of what to expect. It was fine, and the sauces complimented the oysters nicely, though the oysters seemed kinda small. \n\nTruffle Fries ($8) - I mean I've had yet to ever say no to truffle fries. Pretty good, though the wait for these to come out was a tad long. I'd recommend them, but I don't know who wouldn't ever recommend truffle fries to begin with either.\n\nThe B Burger ($16) -  I mean this was okay, but kinda fell flat for me. It just tasted pretty average, and though it was okay, for the pricepoint I wouldn't order this again considering it was kinda small, though it was somewhat filling.\n\nThrilla in Manila ($12) - Rum, Passion Fruit, Campari, Pineapple, Lime, and Maraschino Liqueur. Really loved this drink!  Sweet yet strong, and the pineapple chunk also ties in perfectly as an accent. Definitely a recommend, and I loved this.\n\nThe location itself is gorgeous in the Yerba Buena Gardens, with it's nice landscape setting, and the patio itself is also gorgeous. I went to go sit indoors inside the restaurant, but when I came there were a lot of flies buzzing around where I sat, which was a tad offsetting. \n\nService here was really good, and my waiter was super attentive. I also didn't have to wait too long when I went during the beginning of Happy Hour, so that was a plus too.\n\nTl:dr; B Restaurant & Bar kinda is a meh for me. It sits at a pretty average 3.5 for me, but leaning more towards a 3 because while I thought it was decent, it also wasn't doing anything too special for me either. Though it does offer a nice setting for the food and beverage provided, it's priced slightly up there for food that didn't exactly wow me as a whole.", "author": "Allison O."}

There is a lot of outdoor seating seating as well.\n\nI wish we had made the happy hour, which they offer 4:30-6:30 daily, as it includes great deals on drinks and dollar oysters.

It was a deliciously sweet (and strong!) drink, which is exactly how I like it :)\n\nFor food, I ordered the PEI mussels served in a tomato broth ($16) and honestly wasn't too impressed.

The dollar oyster during happy hour is surprisingly fresh at its price (most SF oysters tend to be on the salty side, FYI). The crab meat toast is well flavored with butter, garlic and herbs, bringing about a sensational first bite. The truffle fries is also satisfying. I could imagine myself passing 2 hours with just the fires and a gintonic for a Saturday afternoon. \n\nBut what I'd highlight here is the fried chicken slider. The meat is tender and well seasoned, fried to perfection, while complemented with chopped cabbage and miniburger bread. Such a delightful and playful dish.\n\nExtra points for the convenient location, the view and the vibe. Very biz casual, very SF. Negative points for the service (overall understaffed so service is slow). \n\nWill I visit again?\n\nFor sure! The menu is short but changes frequently. With a convenient location (close to Powell Station) and reasonable price, I'd very much look forward to my next visit\n\nAttaching my standard of 1-5:\n5 - so good that you should fly there just to try it. Innovative and delicious. Strong menu overall.\n4 - outstanding in its category locally. Would worth up to 1h drive. Strong dishes here and there.\n3.5 - great food here and there but unstable quality. Would be a good choice for take-out but definitely not constitute a good date night dinner.\n3 - if you come with expectation of 3-star food you won't feel disappointed.

It can be quite a wait though to get a table in the inside of the restaurant - we were told that it was going to be around a 45 minute wait for 4 people around 6pm.

We found B Restaurant & Bar HH 4-6PM Fresh & Grilled Oysters for $1, Truffle Deviled Eggs. Although the Oysters were small the flavors were excellent.  We ordered their mussels in a tomato broth off the regular menu, it was excellent.  I wished there was soft bread to dunk in the broth, it was served with crostini type of bread.  They had a nice selection of cocktails, beer & wine for HH.  The restaurant was rustic, lots of light and comfortable.  They had really nice outside seating looking over Yerba Buena park.

The oysters are only a dollar and the service is impeccable. They were so delicious. The servers are extremely nice super funny, and all around great. I love this place, it's also very close to my job. So when I've had a long day I know exactly where I'm going. The Ambiance was a little Tech nerdy for me, but you cannot beat a deal like dollar oysters and beautiful scenery. I was kind of disappointed that the oysters do not come from the Bay Area but, they were amazing nonetheless. They also have $5 racer 5 beers and when I eat something besides the oysters, I will definitely review again. I will be back again and again and again. I think this might be the new spot.", "author": "Jess s."}

It's located in Yerba Buena so there's a very peaceful, relaxing vibe, and the restaurant has glass walls/windows so there's a beautiful view both indoors and outdoors.\n\nHH is Tuesday through Friday from 4:30-6:30pm. The HH menu is limited to just $1 oysters for food, but that's not really anything to complain about. Alcohol is $5-7 or you can get a pitcher of sangria or moscow mule for $45.\n\nMy friend and I ordered 6 oysters first because we weren't sure about the quality, but they were definitely solid so we ended up ordering another 6. We also got the TRUFFLE FRIES ($8) and a CHEESE BOARD ($17). The truffle fries were DELICIOUS. Thin cut, perfectly crispy, lightly salted and seasoned with thyme, parsley and chives. The truffle oil is really the star though. The cheese board was solid and consisted of 3 cheeses, a few slices of bread, pear slices, candied walnuts and fruit preserves. I'm not a huge cheese person and I'm not really sure how to properly enjoy a cheese board, but I liked the cheeses. The bread wasn't very good though - kind of stale and chewy. I wish they had served the cheese with crackers or a crunchier bread.\n\nService here could definitely have been better. Pretty slow and inattentive. It took a while for someone to take our order and the server walked away to put our order in before we had actually finished giving him our order. We asked someone later about ordering the rest of our food and the girl said she'd let the server know, but that didn't happen for a while.\n\nStill a solid spot for happy hour though.

This apparently was a No-No, because shortly there after the seating hostess came over to ball us out. One thing to politely ask to return the chairs, but it's a completely different thing to throw shade at a group that wound up spending over $600 (in a 1.5 hour time, which is damn good money for this bar to make). \n\nThe brusque hostess aside, the service was crap. When our food/drinks were finally brought to us, the servers basically threw it down on the table and walked away. No napkins, no utensils, nothing! Our server was scarcely seen and never bothered to check in to see if we need to order more pitchers or food. A true money loser for the bar, since we would have continued to order more had they returned. \n\nThe food was nothing special, the best thing might have been the tacos, certainly not their fried chicken slides, Mediterranean platter, fries, or the absolutely terrible fried artichoke hearts (emphasis on the choke part). \n\nNow, I get that this is a bar-trap for those visiting the Moscone center and that we should have known better than to hit this place up, but it was sunny out and we wanted a view. \n\nBottom-line, this place is not worth visiting.

Located in Yerba Buena Gardens, B Restaurant's downtown views are pretty hard to beat. So if you're looking to impress an out-of-town guest at a SOMA spot, you should definitely bookmark this restaurant.\n\nAs soon as our party of six was seated, it was time for the Kyle show. This guy was an energetic one-man show. In addition to promptly taking our drink orders and explaining his menu favorites, he entertained us with stories about his family and other amusing anecdotes. It wasn't just our table - this guy really knew how to work the room. I swear - if there was ever a class on how to be a great waiter, Kyle should be the professor. He's that good!\n\nAs for the food, it was good (though not entirely memorable). To be honest, the menu was a bit confusing to me because most of the lunch entr\u00e9es seemed more like appetizers (eg Chicken Meatballs, Po' Boy Sliders, Carne Asada Fries, and Fried Mac & Cheese). Don't get me wrong, these dishes were tasty but seemed more like over-priced bar bites. \n\nI wound up getting the Po' Boy Sliders (3 mini-sandwiches made with fried chicken, spiced remoulade, pickles). Unfortunately, my order somehow got lost in translation. So while my co-workers received their meals in a timely manner, I had to wait another 10 minutes while the kitchen fired up my sliders. At the end of the day, it was an honest mistake. No harm, no foul. And Kyle made sure to take care of things and keep the mood light. I was surprised to discover that they took my meal off the check (that's pretty stellar customer service). For what it's worth, the Po' Bo Sliders were crispy and filling. I'd definitely order them again.\n\nMy co-workers all seemed to enjoy their dishes, but the overall consensus seemed to be that the portions were a bit small (especially given the price). That being said, I would totally return to B Restaurant for an afterwork happy hour. Their cocktail menu looks pretty amazing, and their food seems to be more suited for their bar program.\n\nIf you do wind up going, be sure to request Kyle as your server.

It feels like a secret slice of San Francisco, something tourists and locals would be giddy to stumble upon. \n\nThe indoor area is equally inviting with modern furniture and big glass walls, like a sexy greenhouse. The happy hour offerings are extra nice, including a selection of $6 beer, wine, and cocktails. Usually happy hour wine means Chardonnay and Merlot -- not here!

Regardless, bring your sunglasses if the sun is out because the sun WILL get in your eyes whether you sit inside or outside.\n\nThe wait staff is very attentive and friendly. I got there ahead of time, and they asked me several times if I needed anything. I just enjoyed a refreshing glass of their Happy Hour sangria ($6) while I waited for everything else. We mainly came here for their $1 Happy Hour oysters (which do taste like $1 oysters) and they were not terrible. Their sauces are disgusting though. Everyone avoided the cocktail sauce like the plague, and we had to ask for their horseradish three times before someone actually brought it over... but it was gross too. Tabasco sauce and their other hot sauce just does not do oysters justice. It was passable for Happy Hour. Plus if you order enough pitchers of beer and sangria (holy crap they have pitchers of Moscow Mule too!!) then you will be fine. \n\nOur waitress asked us like FIVE TIMES if we wanted to order their fries. I was getting super annoyed that she was being pushy but our group finally caved in and ordered the fries. Okay the pushiness was deserved. The fries are so good.

(shamelessly plugging lite rock, less talk!)\n\nWe wanted to have a long lunch and ordered a bunch of plates. The ceviche tasting came with fried plantains, but the manager informed us beforehand that he was going to exclude the squid and double up the salmon belly and tiger shrimp portions instead, because the squid wasn't up to par. I appreciated their honesty and also making sure not to serve us mediocre seafood. \n\nTheir cocktails are yummy, but it needs work. Wait a minute, drinking before noon?!? Well, if it's an Aviation made with real creme de violette, then it's totally acceptable. A little heavy on this ingredient which made my cocktail on the sweet side. Their pisco sour isn't authentic looking, but it tastes like one, so we'll let it slide. \n\nFor lunch, I balanced the asparagus, shaved fennel and grilled shrimp salad with a bowl of extremely addicting truffle fries. Why, yes! I even managed to effectively block bf's attempts to steal some.  \n\nHe reports that the burger is cooked like the way he wanted, but the bun is a bit hard... (um? That's how I like it!!

We also ordered some truffle fries ($6ish) per the recommendations on Yelp. \n\nSo the food: the burger was prepared well, but it was a fairly standard burger. It comes with a salad, but the combined value of the salad and burger definitely does not add up to $15. The truffle fries were expensive as well, but I would definitely try them out if you get the chance. They were really fantastic.\n\nOverall, I gave this a 4 because it really is a nice spot.

I guess the main focus was the liver pate.  I don't like liver pate and most charcuterie plates I've eaten in the past did not have pate in it, so I might be biased.  They also give you one solitary piece of fruit... and refills on the bread!\n\n-Fried mac and cheese: It's literally cubes of fried mac and cheese with some sauce and arugula on the side.  Good, but I actually don't like mac and cheese too much.  The inside was just straight mac and cheese while the outside was fried batter.  I did appreciate the arugula though.\n\nTotal came out to ~$20 per person (not including drinks).  Like I mentioned before, if you like sharing small plates, this place is not a bad deal.

Only 25% of the menu had food items so I felt stuck having to choose between a select few.  \n\nI ended up getting the duck confit which the waitress said was laid on a bed of greens.  Not quite a salad but sort of because there's a dressing and croutons.  That looks like a salad to me.  \n\nThe two worst things about the duck:\n1. Too salty\n2. Meat was dry\n\nThe best thing about this dish:\n1. The egg was poached and nice and gooey!  Unfortunately there wasn't a carb in the actual dish (besides the side of bread) that was there to soak up the yoke.\n\nThankfully, the waiter asked me if I wanted some accompanying bread which helped tame the saltiness.  My coworker had the chicken salad sandwich with a side of potato salad and that was much better!  That was one of the $9 lunch specials.\n\nI'll be down to give this place another try but only if my first intention is to get drinks.  It just doesn't seem to be a place to travel to for food alone.", "author": "Shannon L."}

Its location in Yerba Buena Gardens is a bit off-the-beaten brunch crowd track, but is worth seeking out on a bright, warm day when you can sit outside. Unfortunately this last time it was a dreary and wet day, and the cold wind whipped through the glass-enclosed restaurant every time the door was opened. Our table of 9 took up about 1/3 of the indoor chairs.\n\nThe wait staff was friendly and accommodating, even when some in our party were over 45 minutes late. We passed the time with appetizers, mimosas and well-made Bloody Marys with a nice spike of heat. \n\nThis was the second time I ordered the Spinach & Avocado Benedict which once again was pretty awesome. Two perfectly poached eggs, half an avocado, brioche, Hollandaise sauce and spinach. Divine! The brunch menu is not extensive, but there is something for everyone, from citrus and garden salads to burgers to a *clutch-your-heart* 4-egg B-Omega omelet.\n\nWe hope to return during happy hour for their $1 oyster specials.", "author": "Jerry C."}

I do not have much time off but I thought I'd stop into this restaurant during happy hour for a quick bite and a cocktail a couple of months ago. My first impression made it seem like just a place for hungry desperate convention goers to go and get a drink.  It seemed a little dirty and my boyfriend and I were not seated right away even though we were standing in the doorway for a good 2 min. We almost left. All of the servers looked uninterested in doing their jobs and had their backs faced to the dining area looking annoyed at  the thought of even being at work. So when we were finally seated we were given some thrashed looking menus and were told that one of the specials was a blueberry pork mousse. Um that sounded weird....yet interesting so I decided to try it. Are you kidding me server! It was so much more then that. This place would make a fortune off of foodies if they got their service right!!! This dish was so complex and so delicious. It even had succulents as a component with tossed popcorn and a corn mousse next to a piece of blueberry glazed pork belly. I would love to describe it further but all the server gave me was blueberry pork mousse? WTF. Lastly my boyfriend felt this place has a really terrible beer list and some boring outdated cocktails. This is SF!! We have so much to offer in terms of culinary, craft cocktails and beer.  You have such a killer location to have an amazing restaurant. Maybe it is your goal just to make money off of your pitchers of booze which are great but what else do you have to offer?? \n\nI even went back a SECOND time and it seems like the service was WORSE and the restaurant was empty. If I ever saw my staff eating and hanging out instead of serving customers I would have a melt down. The same server came out and said the special was spiced scallops. On my way out I caught one of the kitchen staff which turned out to be the chef. Her scallops had this amazing puree and I had to ask what it was! Stone fruit  puree with grilled okra and a complex spice rub. It was amazing to say the least. I told her that. I saw her heart drop when I flat out told her the service was garbage.

We tried to call to get a table but were told no reservations for HH. We show up and are told we can't have a table because the wait staff can't handle large groups? That's bullshit. So then we try to take a sitting area that had a table so we start sitting around it and are shooed away by the same hostess. Then another part of our group shows up who actually care if they get a table but are also told by the hostess that they can't have a table if they're with us. After deciding whether or not it's even worth it to stay, we ask the hostess what her logic is to not give a table. She had no valid reason and then did a total 180 and gave us a table inside.

You also have the option to sit outside overlooking the Yerba Buena Center. After spending a morning at the MOMA, I head to B to have a drink, something to nosh on and soak up some rays. How ideal is that?", "author": "Liv A."}

We came here for a work lunch a little after 12pm and were suprized to find the place completely empty. \n\nThe Yerba Buena garden, where B Bar is located, is a fantastic oasis right bang smack in the middle of the City so the setting definitely gets a BIG TICK. I also appreciate what they have done to take advantage of this - floor to ceiling glass walls create a light/open space and there's a heap of outdoor seating for when its nice out. \n\nI ordered the vege s/w with roast capsicum, eggplant, zucchini and pesto. It was O.K, a bit on the bland side and the side salad was limp and well-over dressed. The highlight was definitely the truffle fries - prefectly salted with just the right amount of truffle oil.\n\nWithout a doubt the most concerning part of the experience was the waiter. He looked at though he hadn't slept in days - scruffy hair, shirt in desperate need of an iron and half tucked in, big bags under his eyes. It definitely wasn't a good look. \n\nWith so many great lunch spots in San Fran, I doubt i'll be back anytime soon!", "author": "Alex D."}

I'd tried to eat here over the holiday break, hunted it down in the maze that is the Yerba Buena gardens, and finally located it, only to discover that they were closed for the holidays. Whooops. My bad. No biggie. I'll just come back when the new year commences.\n\nSo tonight I grab the husband and we skibble to Yerba Buena to experience the B Restaurant and....our experience sorta dies a death of boredom before it can even begin. \n\nWe make our way to interior of the restaurant. There's a little sign that says Please Wait To Be Seated. We stand next to it. We wait. We wait. We wait. We kill some time by being door-policed by some drunk asshole who yells at us to shut the door when the waitress is going in and out---dude, it's not like she's gonna rearrange her molecules to walk through the glass so you can have a shut door. (It's not even THAT cold outside as the couples dining al fresco can attest.) We wait. We wait. We wait. We see a completely different waitress file some checks at the counter. We see a bartender sorta make long-distance eye contact over the bar. We shrug at the sign. We wait. \n\nSo, eventually we give up. And fortunately, I have a back-up plan. So we leave. And I have no idea if the food at B Restaurant is any good. \n\nBut I can tell you, they have a long ways to go on service.", "author": "Lis M."}

Basically you need to be mentally prepared with the fact that you're simply paying for the idea of al fresco dinning in a central place with a nice city view. If you are looking for a nice San Francisco food experience, you probably won't find it here.\n\nThe service was repulsive, staff was not friendly or attentive at all. Not to make things personal, but our server didn't seem he needed his job and came across cognitively confused at times. He was quite willing to ignore us through most of our brunch even though the restaurant was not busy (we were among the early patrons of the morning). We think he just didn't feel we were worthy customers since we declined to order any alcoholic beverages...I did order a cappuccino, which took 20 minutes to arrive and only after I flagged down the server to follow-up.\n\nI ordered the asparagus eggs benedict with prosciutto - it was alright. Asparaguses were nicely seasoned and grilled, poached eggs and prosciutto were fine but the accompanying bread was partially burnt black and not edible.   my companions ordered a chicken sandwich and salmon frittatas. Apparently the chicken sandwich was tasty, though poorly presented. The salmon frittata did not look appetizing - they simply dumped some smoked salmon and a large spoon full of cream cheese on top it the overly-cooked eggs.\n\nWhile the food wasn't great, the service made the former look pretty good.", "author": "Critic X."}

My friends trickled in, we ordered a bunch of their happy hour cocktails (SERIOUS YUM!), pretty good sangrias (MMMmm), a couple dozens of dollar oysters and champagne, vegan pizzas, meat-eater pizzas -- and MAN we were in bliss!!\n\nAnd the best thing was our server ROCKED! He was so great. Wished I remembered his name, he was attentive, fun and was just great. A couple of times, the drinks or food felt like they were a bit slow, but there were many of us and many orders, so I give him that. I'm a happy client, for sure will be back.

Luckily we choose to go here on a day when the weather was more than happy to accommodate us. As we watched people turned away with the saddest expressions my lunch group looked at my a bit worriedly. Not to worry though for I made reservations! And I highly recommend you do the same if you want to guarantee yourself a table here.\n\nNow down to the food. When a place puts anything with truffle oil in it on the menu I'm pretty much ordering it. When it's fries with truffle oil I might be ordering two. So we got the fries to share as a table. Then I ordered a Caesar salad and the cheese tray for my main meal. Sure, sure, these two things are not what they considered a lunch entr\u00e9e, but I can eat cheese for pretty much any meal and be happy.\n\nAnd what a selection of cheeses this was. It came with four varieties that I cannot remember the names of for the live of me. I called them, delicious, deliciouser, deliciousest, and the most delisiousest. The salad doesn't come in a smaller size to let you know so if you want a side salad you're out of luck.\n\nOthers at my table ordered the BLT and pulled pork sandwich lunch specials and both looked great. The only snag was our service toward the end lagged a little. When we were finished with our plates we found ourselves waiting for the check for a while.

Although the groupon couldn't be used during happy hour, we were staying for dinner.  On a thursday around 5:30 it was hopping and the indoor area was filled.  We ended up starting our happy hour experience on the patio.  As always, it was chilly in SF. Surprise. Surprise.  I don't remember there being heat lamps, so bring a little coat and scarf.  But a couple glasses of wine and intense catch up sessions with girlfriends, we warmed up quick.\n\nThe menu was plentiful, but had some definite hits and misses:\n-  Dollar Oysters During Happy Hr:  These were ok.  I wouldn't come back for oysters and instead were would rather hit up Hog Island or Hyde Street Oyster Bar instead if thats what you are jonesing for.\n- Polenta Fries:  Dang! I love me some polenta fries.  And these were no joke.  Perfectly seasoned and with that great contija cheese, a nice twist.\n- Arancini:  Another great twist to a classic italian dish.  Instead of ground beef in the inside, these risotto balls had crab and roasted corn.  Quite delicious.\n- Burger:  This was alright.  We split it up, but we all found the burger to be dry and uneventful.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing.  \n\nI would definitely be back for small bites and wine.  They had a great wine list and the service was fantastic.  We started the night outdoors, but when a table freed up inside, they moved us in.

They don't take reservations for parties less than 6, so we met a the restaurant at 7pm.  The restaurant has a long bar and only a few tables inside.  The wait was long for a table inside, since there was a party of 7 and another of 8 ahead of us, so we opted to sit outside.\n\nWe sat at a fairly secluded area, which was nice since it was quiet.  The only con was that they were very understaffed that evening so we perhaps did not get as much attention as you would sitting inside, for example.  It was ok though, since we had much to catch up on.\n\nWe ordered a pitcher of sparkling sangria to start, which was really refreshing.  I can certainly see myself enjoying these on a warm (indian) summer day.  I ordered the pizzetta lyonnaise, which comes topped with roasted pork belly, chicories, quail egg, and mustard vinaigrette.  The pizzetta was more like a tasty focaccia topped with more goodness.  The crust/focaccia was delightfully crisped at the edges, and the pork belly was prepared very well.  All of the components came together pretty well, and I particularly thought the mustard vinaigrette was a great complement to the whole thing.\n\nMy friend ordered the vegan pizzetta and enjoyed it as well.  My other two friends ordered the pork sugo, but when the food brought out it was a beef shortrib dish.  Naturally, we were a little confused.  Apparently they had run out of the pork sugo but the waitress had forgotten that detail at the time we ordered.  My friends just went with the shortrib tagliatelle dish, which they did like.  \n\nMy friends ordered 2 chocolate ganache cakes (2 people split 2 and my other friend had one herself).  I had a bite and it was really really good.  Good chocolate flavor without being too rich, and the cake portion was light and airy too.\n\nDespite the pork sugo snafu, I really liked this place.  Maybe it was because we had a wonderful table outside and it wasn't actually freezing cold, or because I just love pork belly that much.  In any case, I would certainly recommend this place to others for a very reasonably-priced and delicious meal.

We like steak tartare, sushi and a wide variety of raw food...this was inedible. She politely called the waiter over and pointed out the discrepancy with what she ordered and with what was served.

With glass windows all around, and situated above the Yerba Buena garden, you can take in some great views while you relax and dine.  \n\nMost of the menu is adequate to above average, though there are certainly a handful of plates that do stand out.  Of all the things I've ordered, the French Fries with Truffle Oil are by far and the away the best I've had.  Sure, they are just french fries...but have you had them with truffle oil before?!  Didn't think so...cuz otherwise, you wouldn't doubt that the truffle fries are fantastic!  \n\nBeyond that, the Duck Confit is delicious, and the apples do a fantastic job of lightening up the flavors and refreshing the pallet.  The Buffalo Mozzarella plate is also a highlight, with the cheese and salami with olive oil, salt, and herb seasoning.  Toss that onto some toasted bread, and talk about an appetizer.  They also have $1 oysters, which is hard to complain with, a Prosciutto Panini with Augula salad that really hits the spot, and carafes of sangria.\n\nThe big knock against them is that even when you do come here and get their drinks and appetizers knocked down by a few bucks, you can still rack up quite a bill.  The most recent trip with a party of six still tallied a bill that was over $200.  In the end, you'll still be satisfied with your meal and drinks, but just remember this a nicer sort of happy hour.", "author": "Mike L."}

The decor of the restaurant itself was elegant and simple; to say the least it had a very romantic and tasteful feel to it. The inside seating was rather limited (and I mean that once the 10 of us sat down there were only about another 5 tables for 2 left. There was seating outside too but the wind had picked up so that wasn't an option. Since the restaurant walls were made of glass and it was, earlier in the day, a warm day in San Francisco, it acted like a greenhouse and kept all the warm air inside. Though I have to admit, it was a welcome change from the still frigid breeze outside. We didn't get the chance to enjoy the view but we did enjoy everything else.\n\nWe all started out with cocktails--the Don Riley, the Asian Pears, the Dirty Martinis. All of them were pretty good, it had the subtle taste of the fruits and the alcohol was not on the weak side. For the price, it was worth the price for a nice night out with friends. The atmosphere was divine especially considering the wait staff, who was very attentive and very accommodating to our requests. \n\nWe started off the food portion of the night with one and a half dozen of oysters, it was delish. They were plump, juicy, and they gave us some innovative toppings that helped bring the flavor of the oysters out. It was goooooood. We all ordered different things, I ordered the chicken threeway and my bf ordered the flank steak. The chicken threeway was good esp the tempura, which was a creative and unique method of cooking up some chicken meat. It was seasoned perfectly. The flank beef was a bit on the chewy side and wasn't as tender as I had hoped it would be. The scallop appetizer had a delicious sauce that was perfect for dipping the bread. The chocolate cake with cherries was fantastic and the raspberry mousse was light and fluffy. \n\nThanks to one of our friends who is a master at networking, she was able to thank the chef personally for the wonderful meal, resulting in all of us going out on the patio to smoke some cigars. They proceeded to bring some complimentary shots of mint & raspberry for us to warm us on the frigid city night. All in all, great restaurant. I will definitely, definitely be back for happy hour.

B restaurant is a not-so-hidden gem atop Yerba Buena Gardens in SOMA. B Restaurant is a contemporary bar and restaurant offering delicious cocktails and food with killer views. The restaurant sits at the top of Yerba Buena Gardens overlooking the gardens and waterfalls as well as offering panoramic views of the city. The best part is B Restaurant has a spacious terrace opening off the main dining room with plenty of room to relax and take in the sunshine after work. \n\nB Restaurant's Happy Hour specials are amazing. Happy Hour begins at 4pm and ends at 7:30pm Tuesday through Friday, providing plenty of time for you to sample their specialty cocktail list and appetizers.  Happy Hour drink specials include a \"Ginger Ricky\", a concoction of gin, fresh lime and house made ginger ale; $5 well drinks; $4 Trumer Pilsner and $5 red wine sangria. In addition to individual drinks, you can also get a table side pitcher of red, white or sparkling sangria for $40. The table side sangria presentation is sure to please everyone at the table (and get them a bit tipsy). Happy Hour food specials are just as tempting as the drinks and include dollar oysters and your choice of small $5 plates such as truffle fries, confit honey-mint chicken wings, marinated olives, baby gem ceasar and salmon rillette. \n\nB Restaurant is a great Happy Hour for locals as well as out of town guests.

Final issue: they couldn't bring two of us the tea we ordered (something about all the french presses already being used/dirty), so our waitress offered free mimosas to us. We each ordered one ( so at least two should have been comped based on the tea order). Only one was comped, so we asked to have that corrected and if possible additional compensation (as in a free mimosa for each of us) based on the ridiculous wait time for our food. Our server was really kind and said she'd asked the manager, but he had not approved it. So, we said we'd be happy to speak with him to make the request directly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-09-04", "description": "I have been to B Restaurant a few times for dinner or happy hour and always had a great time.  Recommended it to friends and family, but after this past Sunday, will without a doubt, steer people as far away from here.  I have worked in the industry for almost 20 years, and this was the first time where my experience left me speechless.  We arrived for brunch around 12, and know that there would be a wait, since it was a nice day.  We were the first name on the list and told about 30 mins.  After waiting around we noticed another group of ladies who asked to get their bottomless mimosas while they were waiting, and were now happy and waiting patiently, and so of course we followed suit.  Time passes, and now we have been waiting about 45 mins for a table and 15 mins for our mimosas.  Still ok, they are busy and we see people wrapping up their meals.  About ten minutes later we are sat at our table, still no mimosas, and the host informs us that they are running out of mimosas, but getting more oj and champagne, but if we would like to have bloody marys we can have them now, and not have to wait, but we cannot switch back, so we decide to wait.  About two minutes later, two servers come out with full pitchers of mimosas and go around to all the tables around us, including a table who sat right after us, and give everyone refills, and the first round to the couple seated after us.  There was obviously plenty of mimosa to give us four glasses.  We bite our tounges and wait for another 10 minutes and watch as the servers continue to refill glasses and ignore us.  Now we are just thirsty, so we grab a server passing by and explain that we have now been waiting for almost 40 mins for our mimosas.  He apologizes and in a couple minutes he returns with glasses and we are happy.  \nThe B Brunch menu only has about 5-6 entree items and 4 side dishes.  The four of us decide on stuff to share and when our server gets there, we order with her only to be informed that they don't have any more sausage, one of their sides.  Since the other sides are potatoes (which come with every entree), toast, or bacon, we decided to all get bacon.  Minutes later, she returns and informs us that two of our entrees are no longer available, so again we switch, a little bothered now, since they have been only open since 11, and its now 1am, they have done one turn, but almost 30% of there menu is unavailable.  \nThe food comes, its ok, not great, but not horrible, at least until my friend spits something out on her plate.  We poke at it with a fork and realize that it is a sticker that was most likely on the red peppers in the potatoes.  Ok, I know stuff happens, hair gets in food, etc.  But we want to point it out, so they can realize the mistake.  Unfortunately we never saw our server again, so we grabbed the host.  Her exact words when we pointed it out was, \"oh, thank you.  thank you.\"  Grabbed the plate and left.  No apology.  We actually laughed because that seemed like such a strange reaction.  We asked for the check and then proceeded to sit there for 15-20 mins.  We thought at least they would probably get us out fast, but nope, no server no check.  We actually all got up and stood near the host stand for about 5 mins before someone asked if we needed something.  I got the check, and because I don't believe in stiffing a server, but wanted to express my dissatisfaction of the whole experience, asked to speak to a manger so I could give them the check and let them know I was super disappointed.  The manager took the check book and she listened as I explained everything that had happened. She nodded and interrupted me as I finished telling her about the sticker in our food by simply saying \"i'm not going to make any excuses\" and then started to walk away.  No apology, no sorry.  I grabbed her because I wanted to say something else, but I was speechless, I seriously tried to say something, but all that came out was nonsense.  \nI have worked in restaurants when it is busy, understaffed, food come out wrong, and I have always been told to apologize and try to turn the experience around somehow.  I don't know what their philosophy is at B, but it seems like it is\n1.  never apologize\n2.  if something is wrong, it will get better by just avoiding the table\n3.  never apologize\nthere are too many good places to eat in the city.  avoid this place.  yes I am bitter about this experience, but I am not over exaggerating anything.  i have simply recapped my experience in hopes that it whoever reads this, will be saved from having a similar one by eating somewhere else.", "author": "Andrew B."}

Sometimes they are closed for private events, other times they close at random times.  \n\nJust this last Saturday I walked over there at 5:15 pm and saw them working the locks at the door.  The sign by the door said Saturday hours were 5: 0 pm to 10: 0pm with the blanks left in between the numbers.  I asked if they were opening at 5:30, and the worker who was locking up said they were closing for the day.  I would not pay too much attention to this if it had been the first time, but this was third time in the past year they have been closed when their stated hours said they would be open.  \n\nIt is too bad that such a great place, serving great food and drinks with a smile and in the perfect location is so sketchy in their operations.

I've experienced better. \n\nNothing special for the food, the brunch menu are mediocre, the benedicts doesn't look like the 'actual egg benedict', the panini and burger are too hard to chew, the salad is okay. Luckily some sweets (french toast, chocolate cake, strawberry napoleon pastry) and side menu (baked fingerling potato & truffle fries) are excellent.\n\nI came in with a bunch of girls to have lunch together, we had rsvp before because we're quite a large party and seated inside as the wind blew outside. I don't know maybe it's only us who treated like this, but the service was poor. \n\nIn addition for the slow service, the manager/owner/waiter seems to act shady. They never smile at us, which makes me think \"what have we done wrong?\". We didn't share our food, everybody got their own order, we didn't mess with the chair or table or breaking any glassware. But they kept staring at us in an unfriendly manner which made us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.\n\nThe only reason I could think of is maybe we asked them too much; like refill our water, add more orders (which I thought they supposed to be happy), and last but not least, take picture of all of us. Duh, that's normal for girls day out rite ? I've been to lots of places and the waiter always willing to take pics without frowning. I'll be considerate if the bar was very busy, but in this case, it was not. \n\nThere was one guy I-don't-know-who but more likely to be the manager/owner because he didn't wear uniform like others did, but I'm sure he works there because he served us food too. He made spiteful remarks when we politely asked him to help us take pic. He did it anyway with no smile, without saying like \"ready? 1 2 3\", put down the camera on the table and just walk away without looking after we said \"thank you so much!\" \n\nHello? That's unacceptable ! We were paying the same amount like everyone. I sensed some racist issue here since we're not natives. Well, maybe the waiters (and that guy) just had a bad day..

I arrive a bit early, as did a few others, but our table was ready, so we were seated immediately. The outdoor seating area is lovely; nice view of the downtown/FiD. If it were a warm night, I would have liked it even more. It was a bit chilly that evening, and unfortunately they did not have heat lamps. Luckily, as soon as a table inside that could accommodate us was open, we were seated. Pretty smooth transition, as staff assisted with our plates and drinks. \n\nThe table we sat in was against the window and did not comfortably seat all 7 of us, but we let it go, as the inside was warmer and ambiance was nice. It's a cozy, lil dining area that has a sleek look with the marble bar, dark wood paneling, white stones/brick walls, lanterns that that hang above the bar, and floor to ceiling windows that line the one side of the restaurant. \n\nThe menu's fun with special pricing such as $6 each or $15 for three or $7 each or $18 for three.  With a couple exceptions, all the food we ordered was on point.  Here's the verdict: The truffle fries were simple, but done right! The same can be said about the hamburger, crab cake, vegetable brushetta, buffalo mozzarella. The halibut ceviche and duck confit were way off. Too fishy and limey and bland respectively. Sadly, the ceviche went to waste. \n\nAgain, B Restaurant and Bar is definitely a lovely venue from food to ambiance to service.

We rented the entire restaurant and had about 60 people show up over a 3-4 hour brunch.\n\nFor us, the most compelling aspect of B Restaurant was the venue.  It's an oasis up above the dense, urban SOMA neighborhood.  Dramatic cityscape views tie together nicely with the green grass of Yerba Buena Gardens.  The event was in November so we mostly stayed indoors (however, I've also eaten lunch during the summer and the patio is pretty fantastic on a nice day).  Additionally, many of our guests were staying at either the W Hotel or the ITC so B Restaurant was a perfect location in between the hotels.  For all other guests, the Mission Street Garage was ~1 block away.\n\nWe worked with Misty and everything was pretty straightforward when it came to ordering food and renting the space (an absolute blessing when there were so many not-so-straightforward negotiations during the wedding planning phase).  It was nice that they were well versed in renting the entire space and had menu's set up for us to choose from.  The food was good and our friends/family left full and happy!\n\nOne note on cost: we looked into using a banquet room in either of the hotels noted above and the prices were just ridiculous when compared to renting B Restaurant.  I was so happy to have found a cost effective, local business alternative!", "author": "Heather A."}

We went there for a Sunday brunch and throughout the experience became more and more annoyed. After waiting outside for about 20 minutes with 3 or 4 other groups and watching the wait staff wander around empty tables, we ended up taking a seat at the bar. \n\nIt took awhile for anyone to come over and acknowledge we were there, which is surprising since the inside of this place is not very big. The kitchen was pretty busy and apparently this requires a manager to  stand and shout orders to the chefs. He scolded a chef in front of everyone and most people at the bar could hear. I know it's a restaurant and things like this happen, but please keep it in the kitchen and not out in front of your customers.\n\nThe food was good. The lady had the burger and a side of truffle fries, both were very good. I had prosciutto & avocado benedict, it came out cold but at that point I didn't care. Their French press coffee is very good as well. At this point we were going to give them the benefit of the doubt because of the food. However, we ended up sitting for the next hour or so as each member of the staff walked by us (we even stacked our plates in hopes they would notice). We did get to witness them running out of practically everything on the menu as a group of 6 was seated by the hostess. \n\nOverall, service needs a lot of work. Maybe we caught them on a bad day but from reading other reviews it sounds pretty common. It wouldn't hurt them to clean up some of the junk around the place either (empty tv box, clutter, fruit flies). Be prepared for shoddy service and cold food.

Go all out and order it with the bacon, avocado, and bleu. You know you want to.\n\nYUM. I'm okay paying the premium for the food because they're paying the premium for the location.

The bread it was served on was even blander -- just a hunk of dough with no flavor. My friend ordered a sandwich that was supposed to have mozzarella cheese on it, which was the reason why she ordered it, and neither one of us could find the elusive cheese. To his credit, the waiter asked the kitchen about it and their response was that it was melted mozzarella so that's why she didn't see it. I thought that was a lame response, and they did nothing to adjust her bill or even apologize for the fact that she was dissatisfied.\n\nThis won't be on my short list of places to revisit unless I'm going there strictly for the truffle fries.", "author": "Lori M."}

What a great idea, sitting outside drinking bottomless mimosas and bloody marys.\n\nIt started with really slow service.  We were warned right away that you can't switch between bloody marys and mimosas which is understandable.  Then they brought out our drinks and started to mix a pitcher of sangria at our table... we were all thinking... excellent.  But then the other server came and said it was for a different table and they took it away.\n\nThen we ordered the cheese plate, the meat plate and truffled french fries.  They brought the meat plate plate right away.  Then 20 minutes later they arrived with another meat plate, the cheese plate and the truffled fries...\n\nAnd then the guy dropped the ketchup from the fries onto my friend's purse and chair.  \n\nWe weren't ready to give up though.  Once again, beautiful day with bottomless mimosas.\n\nWe ordered brunch and I got your standard burger; can't go wrong.  When it was delivered it was pink inside and I ordered it medium.  I am a medium rare kind of guy so I am not afraid of a little blood.  BUT this was pink, through and through, and I sent it back after one bite.  They took it away and said that they were \"going to fix it.\"\n\nI am not sure what they did but my exact same burger came back with the bite out of it and my bleu cheese still barely melted on top... maybe microwave.  The inside was now a grey-ish pink and I just gave up.  Didn't make a big deal about it since I was there for someone else's b-day party.\n\nThen my very next bloody tasted completely wrong.  Thought maybe it was just a heavier pour.  Took a another drink and figured it out; they used tequila instead of vodka.  Had some friends try it and they agreed.  Sent it back.\n\nGot another bloody mary and we were then told that they must have pushed the wrong button... vodka/tequila out of a pouring gun, must be some dirt cheap vodka.  My friends got another bloody as well and then we were told that they were out of blood mary mix... we would need to switch to the mimosas.\n\nWe were done but all of us had another round while we waited for our check.\n\nAfter all of the mix-ups and screw-ups and undercooked food, there was not even a discount.  Full-priced with a 20% automatic gratuity b/c of the party size.\n\nIt was such a horrible customer service experience at such a potentially amazing venue.", "author": "Scott R."}

However, now I wouldn't recommend it if it was the last place on earth serving beer. I wish I could give it negative stars. In fact, I finally created a Yelp profile just so I could write this review...\n\nI've been there a bunch over the past couple of months. The happy hour itself isn't that good - the cocktails are lousy and the appetizers are mediocre (with the exception of the $1/oysters.) However, the outdoor patio overlooking Yerba Buena gardens is breath taking. The wait staff was very courteous and sweet.\n\nThen ... I met the manager. He is one of those people who seriously should never roam a dining room floor... My advice to him: sit in the backroom and count your money, but whatever you do - don't interact with the guests. You are spectacularly bad at it.\n\nHe meets us at the door and informs us that we can't have an outdoor table until our entire party of four arrives. (Two of us were there.) Now - it was already 7p, half the outdoor tables were empty and the fog was rolling in. Within an hour, we would have moved inside anyways. All the outdoor tables seat four, we had two already, two more were coming... but he refused. He said, \"If I seat you two now, I won't seat your friends with you!\" ... Really? Really? Once again, the outside are was only half full and he knows better than most that the fog rolling in would make the outdoor seats so much less appealing.\n\nSo... we hung out at the bar instead and I vowed to never come back. What kind of bar manager treats a regular guest that way? While at the bar, we saw the bartender and the manager handle two other guests in similar ways. \n\nAll in all, with the number of great HH spots in SOMA, why would you go to a place that treated patrons like dirt.

On my last day of Macworld 2010, I decided to take a chance and drop by for brunch since it was Saturday and located just above Moscone North where MacWorld 2010 was winding down.  \n\nThe service was pleasant and the glass walls made sitting inside almost like sitting outside, just without any inconvenient breezes to spoil anything. I didn't have any expectations but the Crabcake and  Eggs were superlatively superb, if I may double-up on my praise.  Many restaurants I've been to always overcook the scrambled eggs (probably in fear of salmonella; turning them into little yellow rocks) and that always turned me off.  It takes an expert hand to get scrambled eggs just to the point of doneness so it keeps from being overly runny (and potentially a salmonella hazard), yet fluffy enough to bring out the flavor of good eggs that is totally missing in a cooked-to-death, leather-like omelette.  This place, Ladies and Gentlemen, has somebody in the kitchen that has such an expert hand and I was in gastronomic ecstasy. The eggs were so good that they almost eclipsed the beautifully sauteed crabcake with an excellent light filler that, while it wasn't \"lump crab meat\" as advertised in the brunch menu, had a decent amount of crabmeat in it.   And the freshly squeezed orange juice wasn't bad either!\n\nIf I only had more time before my trip ended, I would've come back to eat my way through their menu.  But one must leave something for later trips, no?  I append a photograph as limited gustatory proof but even through the visuals one can see the beauty of the dish showing through.

However, what draws me to this place is the outdoor seating on warm, sunny days in city. \n\nToday's experience was Terrible and SURPRISING! I ordered the citrus salad (only salad on menu). The waiter claimed that they will no longer be carrying this item and they forgot to remove it from the menu. Ok fine I'm ok with that so I ordered something else. \n\nBut oddly enough the table behind us got the salad which they were sat after we were. it gets better. Then the table next  to us  gets seated and tries to order the salad. The waiter tells  them the same story as me. After the waiter leaves the table the women says to guy she was with \" look at that table they have a salad, let's ask again if we can get one\"\n\nAt this point I'm leaving the restaurant. As I'm leaving I pass a guy and ask \"are u the manager?\" he states \"No I'm one of the owners\" I'm thinking oh good maybe I should let him no that his waiter may be telling customers the wrong information since another table was able to get an item that was suppose to be discontinued. I proceed to tell him and his response was \"the reason that table got a salad was because they are his valued customers and he went down to his storage to specially dig out the salad for them and that his waiter is correct in stated they do not have salad on the menu\".  He was very rude in his response and at first danced around the issue before just saying that he made an exception for good customers.  I guess my regular business isn't good enough.

I had the prosciutto & avocado eggs benedict, which was absolutely perfect.  My friend's dish was also very good - I believe she had the summer squash eggs benedict.  I disagree with the reviews that say the portions are small.  I consider myself... a big eater, and I was not able to finish my serving.  My friend and I also each had a couple of their specialty cocktails which were delicious and potent -- I'd felt the $9 price tags were too high until my first drink came and I realized how boozy it was.\n\nI felt service was well paced, even though we'd arrived near the tale end of their weekend business hours, we were not rushed at all, and our server waited until we'd put a good dent in our appetizer before bringing our entrees.  We ate outdoors, as it was a rare warm November afternoon, but the indoor seating looked pleasant as well.  We laughed a bit over the strange music selection... they were playing dance/pop type songs from the late 80's and early 90's.  After a couple of cocktails, I rather wanted to get up and dance around the patio, but... somehow I restrained myself. ;)\n\nPrices for brunch were a bit steep:  an appetizer, entree and two drinks ran each of us $35-40 not including tip.  But the food was delicious and I'll definitely be back when the weather is nice enough to eat outdoors again.", "author": "Heidi M."}

Nicole and I split the \"boxed\" chicken salad sandwich and a side of the truffle fries. It was the perfect amount for the both of us, and I really enjoyed the pesto and apple slices in the sandwich.

Eating my lunches at the desk, no time to Yelp, and spending evenings at home with roommates and friends, so who better to get me out of this slump than the one person who had her own personal self-inflicted slump when she waited for me to get ROTD before she wrote again.  That's right, I got the privilege of lunching with Drue.  I ain't one to name drop in reviews either, so you know it must have been good.\n\nWith Drue being new to the FiDi/Soma area, I had her choose somewhere by her office...somewhere neither of us had been to before.  She suggested B.  I had been here once, after the Elite event ages ago, but that was just drinks and a few appetizers.  This was lunch.  A meal worth writing about.  A place worthy of 4 stars for now....however, I think it is 5 star potential.\n\nWith a server who was super accommodating, a beautiful view, and a great dining companion I knew I was in for a treat.  We split the soup of the day.  It was this delicious cauliflower soup, with pieces of cauliflower in it, topped with truffle oil.  The server made sure it came out split, and it was just as lovely as he had described it.  I opted to order a butter leaf lettuce salad, topped with blue cheese, bacon, tomatoes and onions.  It was a little heavy on the dressing, but it wasn't anything I couldn't let drip off the leaves.  Drue had a burger, and she seemed pleased.  Our water glasses were never left unfilled.\n\nTheir cocktails from what I remember were worth talking about as well...but alas, no drinky on lunch break....\n\nIt's a little on the pricier side for a lunch in Soma for a girl on a budget, I'm not used to spending $15 for lunch....but I would treat myself to lunch at B again....if the right opportunity came up.", "author": "Lauren F."}

The bar staff were a jovial bunch and I never waited more than thirty seconds for a drink.  They even offered up a cardboard box when the drunken break-dancing started. \n\nThe blessing/curse is that B is set far back from the hustle and bustle of the Yerba Buena, so it is secluded and peaceful, but at the same time, it feels as though it is set so far back that nobody will find it.

The wait staff was very nice and friendly and vibed well with the entire group.  We ordered the appetizer deals so we got to sample a lot of the appetizers - it was over once I tasted the truffle fries, i tell ya!  For lunch I had a chicken pesto sammich with a salad to accompany it - very tasty and filling.\n\nVISIT #2\nIt was this past week actually, my boss was leaving the company so there was a happy hour planned here.  Coincidentally it was ALSO the same night as the Yelp Elite Newbie event so imagine my surprise to walk up and see Jessica T greet us!  I was with Jimmy H (he and I are 2nd year elites) so we of course were not invited to the event but it was nice getting to mingle with Yelp Elite newbies and for me to finally meet Jessica and Ruggy in person - perfect event to meet them as it was very small and intimate for the Yelp Elite newbies.\n\nOk so back to the menu - the drinks are heavenly.  I tried some ginger thing but opted for the old standby - red red wiiiiine.  The guy behind the bar was one of the waiters who served my group the first time I came here and he actually recognized me - major major points and kudos to him for picking me out of a crowded bar.

Funny how no one in the Yelp home office has offered to do the same, ahem. \n\nAnd what a treat this place was because it was one part dinner, one part dinner theater and one part adventure. Had I not seen Preet standing on the corner, I would have never found this place nestled like a rare jewel in the inner and upper working of Yerba Buena.  So we made our way around the ridiculous blocks of Soma, one way here, nope the other way there, taking 20 minutes to wind up in the same very spot we were before at a time when there were few other cars around.  I recommend Muni.  \n\nThat said we hiked through Yerba Buena to it, and  when found (hint, its past the fountain, around the corner from the MLK tribute, up the stairs, down the corridor, and to the right, whew!) it looks like a jewel box on the outside.  On the inside it has a long, long bar that was empty but looks like it should hold down quite a happy hour and a small dining area that has maybe 20 tables.\n\nWith this setting you might think the service would be fast with two waiters on board and only two other tables occupied. However, you would think wrong.  We were seated promptly by our homolicious waiter whose hands talk twice as fast as he does and though he has comments on all the food looks like he burns it off in a heartbeat.  I hate bitches like that. \n\nWe were given menus and we ordered drinks.  A half hour or so later, these drinks arrived.  I knew my drink was going to be sweet, I ordered the Love On with pureed raspberries and this was a mistake. \nThe other drink was sweeter than expected and we actually sent back because we were told \"it is not sweet at all\" and sure enough it was like a sugar salad in a drink.  \n\nWhen the drinks came we made it clear that we were in a rush and had to G-O, hello bitches we had the Yelp Elite party at Supperclub to make and fashionably late is one thing but really late limits our ability to make it home at a decent hour., I digress again...\n\nThen they picked it up quite a notch and out came a complimentary soup in a champagne glass,  It was a soup with crab in it so my vegetarian palate wasn't having it but the truffle oil in it was robust in the air.  Our beet salad was worth the raves I had heard.  The beets were soft but firm, a real challenge for anyone whose struggled to cook beets.  \n\nI had a Tofu Bucco, their nod to the vegetarians.  I looked at it, its lovely presention and all but I was sure I was going to be disappointed.\n\nFor Tofu eaters, often the tofu prepared at restaurants as their one attempt to satisfy you actually tastes fine on the first bite, the outer edge is good but then inside all moist and chalky.  NOT So here.  The Tofu was flavorful and crisp all the way through.  The crisp basil was an inspiration.  The chicken dish with cheese was well presented also.\n\nThe plates were nice but then Julie L showed up and pointed out you can get those plates at Ikea. Ouch B, ouch, did you hear what she just said about you?\n\nWe didn't have time for dessert but as our waiter dramatically pointed out, we were out at 9:28 when we wanted to be out at 9:30.

They were thorough, but this happened at least 5 times and after a while it got annoying.  The worst part was that the manager came to us and asked how we heard about the restaurant and if it was from Living Social.  We replied, \"yes,\" to which the manager replied, \"I could tell.  You guys seem to fit that bill perfectly\" in a rather snooty manner.  What the heck was that about?  We were dressed fine, hadn't complained about anything, and we were nothing but friendly with the staff despite all the problems.  He made us feel like people of Living Social were akin to People of Walmart!  Later, we asked if we could use more than one Living Social coupon to pay for our $112 bill, to which the manager promptly, and rudely, denied us.  Bummer.

It was fresh, spiced well, but the only thing that I would change is to include olives (important) and quality tomatoes --- mine were bland like the ones they usually sell at Safeway. Since it may not be the season yet for the yummy tomatoes, I would substitute with the cherry tomatoes that at least have flavor and some taste, otherwise a perfect portioned salad. \n\nSecond time I took my friend there but for dinner now. At night the location looks even more amazing with all the lighting outside...quite romantic and secretly hidden (wonderful place to make out after dinner) :-))))) So, back to the food...we had mushroom soup, which was absolutely delicious and it gets 5-stars from me. Also, we ordered Sashimi Scallop --- did not impress me at all, overcooked and I could feel the oil it was fried in; then we had some Seared Ahi Tuna --- it was just alright, I had much better ahi tuna before.

They were poorly shucked with all sorts of stuff inside that didn't belong there.\n\nTo add insult to injury, when we got our truffle fries, they had placed cut up pieces of the old happy hour menu under the bowl of fries as decor.  +1 for recycling old menus, -1 for reminding me that I can't have the chicken wings I came here for.\n\nMore positives: The view is amazing.

I was hoping we would have a nice sister lunch, enjoying the sunshine and views at the Yerba Buena Center...  Not so much; sometimes I forget I live in San Francisco.\n\nNonetheless, B Restaurant is perfect for those days you WISH the weather was nice and you want to feel like you were actually eating outside; this is as close as it gets to eating outside...without eating outside.  The 360 degree glass windows (and walls) make it seem like you're outside but it's nice and cozy inside.  I was also surprised by how reasonable it was given the great service (since lunch was on my sister...maybe I should've picked a more expensive place! :-) ), and really, a $9 burger is just a couple of dollars more than what you would expect to pay at any standard to-go place in SoMa/FiDi.\n\nAlike in look and alike in taste, my sister and I both ordered the same thing - French onion soup to start and burgers for our entrees.  Since I'm the \"healthy\" one, I got greens with my (bacon-less) burger instead of fries.  The French onion soup was not as \"beefy\" and salty as I had hoped/expected but still tasty (and strangely...served in a small, water glass..?).  Burger was also solid, but I was put off by the greens.  I took the first bite, and they were incredibly bitter...not from the greens being bitter but it was incredibly salty.  I wasn't sure if I was just reeling from the salty French onion soup aftertaste (?), so I went in for another.  Bleh.  Then I made my sister try them too, and she verified what my taste buds were telling me.  I sent the greens back - the waiter was very confused - and he came back and told me they had salted and dressed the greens.  What?  When did people start salting their salads???  And this, my friends, was not a light dusting of salt.  Despite all of this, the waitstaff was gracious about swapping out the salty greens and were incredibly quick with their service.\n\nWhen you order a salad, ask them to hold the sale.  You'll thank me for it.", "author": "Wendy L."}

I need good beer to wash my oysters down!  They also have mini carafes of sangria for $10 each.  Beyond the drinks, their staff of 8 (nearing the 12 patrons in the restaurant) did a terrible job with service and timeliness.\n\nHowever, the ambiance is really nice, which earns it a star.  They also had quality Fanny Bay and Kumamoto oysters (I would stick with the Fanny Bay breed since they are the best they offer).  If you go here, just grab some oysters and go.  If they replanned this happy hour, it would be a much better.  It's one of those places that you just drop that $20 and after you get snubbed by the bartenders when you are obviously done.\n\nAlso unconfirmed: is this a gay happy hour?

It was filling, juicy, tender, crispy, and cooked just right.  The chocolate caramel tort was fabulous.  The portion was incredibly small, but it tasted great. It was full of flavor, not too sweet.  I  recommend putting a tiny bit of the balsamic reduction (the two or three drops of dark fluid on the plate next to tort, which I initially thought was a splattering of chocolate) on each spoonful of the tort.

The drinks were good and we had a few appetizers, also good. Ordered a caiparinha which, according to the barkeep, was made the old fashioned way. Not too sweet like others, very good. The smell of bacon cooking for their sandwiches the next day was too good to resist, and we even got a plate of bacon to munch on! Nothing beats crispy bacon... mmmmm bacon....\n\nRest of the group showed up and we had dinner. Ordered another round, they didn't have one of the ingredients for a drink and substituted a similar drink. The waiter brought it and let the person know what they were out of. I'm torn, in a way I think it's good to make the quick substitution so that you can drink with everyone else. Conversely, what if you hate the substitute? Anyway... dinner was good. Several people shared some of the smaller plates, all of them were good. I had the smoked trout, which was tasty but not fully deboned. General consensus was that the food was really good. \n\nLike I said, since it's brand new there are bound to be a few issues. We didn't get bread until we asked for it, and by then our mains were almost ready. The restaurant wasn't crowded, but the wait for drinks or little things like water was a little longer than it should've been under the circumstances. I think that they will work thru all this though. The staff is incredibly hospitable and friendly. The location makes it difficult to find for dinner. You just don't get the foot traffic on that side. But I think that's part of the charm, you feel like you are in a little corner of the city. It still has that hidden spot charm, and personally I hope it stays that way. I just might not like it as much having to fight for reservations!\n\nUpdate 11/06: So I went back for dinner to see how it is with a smaller group. While I still like the charm, the kinks aren't worked out yet. There was only one other party in the place and it still took a while to get drinks. And what's with the no bread? I know they have it, why not bring it or at least ask if you'd like bread? We shared 4 of the small plates between the two of us. They brought out the first two in a normal amount of time. But then proceeded to wait until we had finished those off. That would be ok if they came back and checked whether or not we were finished with the first plates...

My BF had the steak - pretty tasty. I'm no expert but the oysters just didn't taste right. French fries - well, they were soggy - \nService: 3.5 Stars - When I asked for a recommendation for a side dish, the waiter said the carrots. When it came out, the dish ALREADY had carrots!

We arrived at the restaurant a little before 1:00 pm.  It was a beautiful sunny afternoon, so we opted to sit on the patio.  The waitress was friendly, and offered several suggestions.  I ordered the heirloom tomato salad, and added steak for an additional $7.99.  My companions ordered burgers and fries cooked in truffle oil to share.  I ordered a flavored ice tea to drink, and one companion ordered a Pepsi, but they substituted with coke.  We were served water fairly quickly, but we waited at least 15 minutes for our drinks.  It was at least 30 minutes before the fries were served, and at least an hour before we received our food.  My salad consisted of a mound of arugula with three small pieces of tomato, and 4 tiny slices of steak.  Oh, there was part of a strawberry and half a fig under the arugula, too.  There were more tomatoes on the burgers than what was in my salad.  I think the burgers tasted ok, and the fries were, well, fries. Next time we will just order take out at the food court in the Metreon.  It was fortunate that we were visiting the city, and not on our lunch hour, as we needed at least 2 hours for this less than adequate meal.", "author": "Wendy H."}

Everyday I trek from SF down to San Jose and back, through sun, rain, wind and sleet. And Traffic . LOTS of traffic.\n\nThat is, I commute every day but one. Fridays. Oh Friday! Friday is my day of relaxed working, merely making way over to the small, local SF office of my company and basking in the glow of the city. And of course, being able to choose where to eat for lunch.\n\nNow being able to choose from all the nearby places to eat is both blessing and curse. Where to go? What cuisine? What price range? Normally, my colleagues and I end up at the Metreon or the Mall out of a sheer inability to choose. This cannot go on...\n\nAnd so today I found myself in B Resteraunt & Bar. It's perched just atop the Moscone Center and looks over the gardens next to the Metreon. It's pleasantly designed, with understated yet classy decor. The Lunch menu is a little limited however, mainly restricted to decent sandwiches. Being a small location, even at lunch time it's a good idea to reserve if you want to eat indoors - otherwise, wrap up warm and take an outdoor table.\n\nPortions are not huge, which is actually a relief in American culture - they do give you just the right amount...

We went with the Charcuterie Platter and the charcuterie itself was not good.  The radishes and cornishons were great, but the meats... bleh.  It was about 10 slices of deli ham and about 5 slices of salam\"i\".  A quick suggestion in order to make it better?  Prosciutto, Mortadella, and pick one of the 15 varieties of Salame that is out there (other than the one kind that our mom's put in our sandwiches as kids).\n\nThen there was the cheese platter.  Plenty of beautiful berries and walnuts which could have been the main focus.  That was nice.  But the cheeses were boring.  Brie, soft Goat and some unidentified cow's milk cheese.  Boring.  An easy fix... Cowgirl Creamery's Red Hawk, Roaring 40's Blue, and maybe a hard goat's milk cheese for something different.\n\nOverall, I'll have to go back and try an entree or two.

The french fries were about a half inch long.  They were too tiny to dip and very hard to hold - in short, they were crumbs.

They just weren't that great.  \n\nWhat did I hate?  Service was very slow, but that was nothing compared to the true horror.  The DJ.

Unfortunately we got a bit of the attitude Julie C wrote about. Food was fine, but my friend ordered a glass of Chardonnay, and it was really, really sweet--Reisling sweet, so she told our server she didn't like it, and asked for something drier. I tasted it--it was aweful and I be likin' me some wine. \n\nShe totally was nice about it. He then began to tell her that she had an under-developed palate and that the wine was a classic: not made like any of the junk from Napa--WTF dude--just get her another fucking glass of wine. He just kept on and on, and it ticked me off. Everyone's palate is different; we are talking a $10 glass of wine--get her want she wants.\n\nI only take one star off because that was just one dude who obviously would love to be working at a higher class place and had a wine list as long as California coast. I will go back--but I will make sure it is for lunch when all us folks with under-develop palates order Chicken Sandos.\n\nThis is one of my favorite place to meet my GF for lunch when I am \"working\" from home.

The humor was much appreciated.\nThey are a little pricey but they have some good food. I have had the burger so far and the chicken avocado sandwich. Both are delicious but I actually like the chicken avocado the best so far. The burger is good but not the greatest.

First off, the building itself is impressive. It's a relatively small space with giant windows that look out to the cityscape of downtown SF. And the internal architecture design is very hip and modern. I felt like I was in a trendy NYC bar, or even one in London.\n\nYou can either sit at the long bar that takes up more than half the space, or you can grab a table (but good luck doing so after work, 5-7 p.m.). The bar space (where we sat) facilitates good one-on-one conversation, but I imagine it'd be tough to strike up a conversation with random strangers.\n\nThere's a DJ, who was great, and really added to the atmosphere. I think every 'chill' after work bar should have a DJ spinning, and B Bar doesn't disappoint here.\n\nOur group didn't have dinner, but we did have a pretty delicious salami/meats plate that I would have again (in fact, folks at B Bar -- Put more salami on the plate!). The manager also sent our group a bowl of fries, which were delicious. \n\nSpeaking of the manager and the rest of the staff, this group is extremely friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable about the wines and such.\n\nPrice-wise, B Bar is more on the pricier side. But considering where it's located and the audience it markets to, the prices don't shock me ($7 for a Chimay; $14 for a glass of red, etc.).\n\nB Bar's a nice alternative to the St. Regis after work, and a nice date spot.

They were so wonderful to us at the Yelp event yesterday - Don was great and we were spoiled rotten.  \nThe inside space is beautifully designed - sleek and serene.  The cocktails were great and the menu sounds scrummy.  I know the steak skewers and endive cups with blue cheese and nuts that I had were both excellent.\nI love that it's somewhat hidden and that on a nice day I can get a bottle of wine and sit outside enjoying this fantastically beautiful city from the shelter of Yerba Buena Gardens.  Now who do I need to see about ordering up some nice days. . ?\n**Edit**\nOkay, I've been back to try the food.  My menage a chicken was good, and the most fun chicken three way ever.  Who knew chicken could be so kinky?  The airplane kind was drryyyyy and I will kick your ass if you try to eat even the tiniest bite of the tempura one, or the thigh, just so you know.  You can have the airplane kind.  The white chocolate mousse dessert was amazing, but even more impressive was the grouping of flavors in the chocolate cake - walnuts, apples and lavender syrup?  Holy hotcakes it was good.  Especially with the lip smackin' madeira Saucy Yelper picked out (to the delight of the bartender).  The service was excellent, yet again (thanks for the mousse guys!  Yum!).", "author": "Jennifer D."}

Our server was just really rude from the moment we sat down until we left.  For some reason, he treated us like he was annoyed we were even there. We're always friendly (extra friendly actually, since my father used to work in a restaurant), and we weren't annoying drunks (only one drink apiece), so I don't know what his problem was. From what we observed, it seemed like he was that way with most of his tables. We were so tempted not to leave a tip, but we didn't want to gyp the other staff who actually did their jobs. As for the food, I had the strawberry salad with shrimp. The salad was decent, but the shrimp was WAY over salted, almost like putting spoonfuls of salt in my mouth. My friend liked her arancini with crab and the polenta appetizer. Based on our first-time experience, we won't return here.

If you want to impress a visitor, let them marvel in the beauty of gardens and fancy architecture here. Food is hit or miss. The burger is the clear winner of the establishment but be prepared for a hefty, greasy mess in the process. Chicken sandwich is a disappointment and the BLT looked pretty average. Beer selection is respectable for a pseudo-schmancy place. What really drops B down to 3 stars is the service. With Moscone, several hotels, and office buildings in the surroundings, this place fills up for lunch. Half of the seating (excluding outside) is at the bar. Having only one bartender to service the entire bar of 15+ patrons, plus make the drinks for the entire restaurant, is unacceptable and plain stupid.

Happy hour is packed, but don't be daunted by the crowds, get your 1$ oysters and 5$ cocktails, I have paid far more for a mixologist type cocktail in this city and you really can't complain about the wait to get a bartender with you know your paying 1/2 of what you would pay else where. \nThe only downfall of this place is the lack of heat lamps, I actually asked them about this on one of my visits and they would LOVE the have heat lamps, but it is a Yerba Buena rule that they cannot have them unless they pay someone to sit there and \"watch\" the heat lamps to make sure there are no accidents or whatever. Sounds silly to me but sometimes city parks & venues have ridiculous rules. \nOver all a great, casual, mellow, delicious place to eat!\n\nPS for all you Oakland peeps check out their sister restaurant in Old town, same great vibe, name & happy hour but with a more diverse dinner menu.", "author": "Eden F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-01-24", "description": "It's always nice to have a pleasant experience at a restaurant I stumble across accidentally.\n\nSome friends and I went to B to have drinks for a birthday. I had never heard of it before, nor did I know where it was. I was impressed the moment I walked in to the restaurant, which is perched on top of Yerba Buena Gardens. B's interior is sophisticated, modern and elegant while also managing to be warm and inviting. It's a hard combination to turn out, but B does it with ease. Sitting by candlelight surrounded by the restaurant's glass walls with downtown SF sparkling in the background was a decidedly glamorous experience.\n\nSo after tipping back a few of B's cocktail specials (more details below), we were naturally hungry. The menu looked promising, so we decided to stay and eat. I'm glad we did. I started out with the roasted beet and blue cheese salad, which was very good. There were many interesting choices on the menu for my main course, but the one that jumped out at me was the burger. This is partly because I just so happened to feel like eating a burger that night (a rare occurrence for me) and partly because said burger was topped with fried feta, fried basil leaves and a roasted tomato sauce. It was totally over the top and utterly delicious. The accompanying potato and bacon salad was a tasty, if very decadent, complement.\n\nThe table shared three desserts: a milk chocolate mousse with strawberries, a cabernet sorbet with apples and meringue, and a bread pudding with root beer reduction. Other people at my table liked the mousse; I didn't. I like dark chocolate, and the mousse wasn't chocolaty enough for me. The cabernet sorbet was a very interesting flavor/texture combination -- the icy sorbet, the crisp apples, and the crunchy meringue. Overall, I liked it very much. The bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and root beer reduction could have been truly spectacular; the flavors were beautiful together, but the texture had problems. It arrived at the table with the reduction in a miniature root beer mug. (Nice touch.) Once the reduction was poured over the pudding and ice cream, though, it hardened and stuck to everything -- plate, spoons, teeth. Still, the flavors went so well together that I went back for numerous bites and just dealt with the stickiness. Really, though, the chef should play with this recipe a bit, because fully realized, it would be one of the best desserts I've had in a while.\n\nThe cocktail menu was fun. I ordered several \"Thunder Kats\" -- tequila and grapefruit juice served up with a cilantro salt rim. It was tasty and strong, but I would have loved to have tasted more cilantro on the rim. The real standout, though, was the dill Gibson. The gin, dill and cocktail onions were quite a combo.\n\nOur server was very friendly and knowledgeable, and the host was very accommodating, especially considering our last-minute party of 9.\n\nRecommended.", "author": "The Other Jeff A."}

All the guests enjoyed the food, I tried it all myself and it was superb - just what I was looking for, interesting and delicious.  I also got tons of compliments from my guests on the service from the waitstaff and bartenders - everyone amazed at how courteous and helpful the staff was - and some of the staff had to stay until 2 AM and clean up at the end.  Misty, the event planner, is awesome - I was very particular about food and she helped me get exactly what I wanted , and arranged a tasting of hour d'oeuvres;  she took care of heater rental, worked with me on the custom drink menu, arranged for the waitstaff to chill and pour the huge 9L bottle of champagne we bought, let our DJ use the restaurant's sound system, and generally helped me make my birthday into a smashing success.\n\nThe space is unique, because it opens right into Yerba Buena Gardens and you have this gorgeous huge outdoor terrace with stunning views (on a clear night - I lucked out!)  Also there are no residential neighbors so you can play music and be as loud as you want - we had one of our speakers outside and most of the dancing was actually on the terrace, there aren't many places in SF you can do that in.\n\nIf you are looking for a venue in SF to have a private cocktail/dance party with food for 70+ people, this is it - sure it ain't cheap, and all our guests were having such a great time at the open bar we blew through our budget and then some - but it will make for one memorable event.", "author": "Jane N."}

But I lied and said I had 170. Yes, a far cry from the one review that I wrote 2 years ago.  But Mike Stoppleman blew my cover. Damn you,  Mike! Then Jeremy, without flinching, said \"You're lying!\" And all I could do was blush. Sigh... Another Chimay please. PRONTO!\n\nOh yeah, B's cool. The horsd'oeuvres were ok.

When we got there they had a sign at the outside host stand that said, \"please wait to be seated.\" We waited behind another couple for over 10 mins in the misty cold. No one ever came out so we finally went in. We asked a guy (who turned out to be the manager) if there was a host and his response was \"we all kind of host.\" Obviously not a perfect system. He took our name and told us 30 min for a table, but 10 min later a busser came over to ask again because the manager had forgotten my name (and obviously hadn't written it down yet.) At that point, at least 2 other parties were ahead of us. \n\nWe ordered drinks and appetizers from the bar. The bartenders were very nice but their drink specials were odd. Mixing wines with alcohol is kind of strange. Other people were commenting that their drinks were funny tasting, too. In the mean time, dining tables opened up and people who has just walked in were seated. We reminded the bartender that we were waiting, as were the other people ahead of us. He said that the people were moved from outside tables because they were cold and since we were at the bar he assumed we didn't want a table anymore. Really? We all opted not to sit outside for just that reason and somebody who comes after us and is dumb enough to try the outside gets our table?  I thought the bar was where most restaurants wanted us to wait. I've worked in restaurants for years and never heard that you loose your table if you order from the bar. He could tell we were upset so he comped the first round of drinks and our appetizer. Good man. \n\nThere also seemed to be some sort of strange music war going on. The music kept switching between a Rolling Stones CD and more modern stuff, with the volume going crazy high at times and songs getting cut off abruptly in the middle. The music wasn't bad, but the up and down, back and forth was distracting.\n\nWhen we finally got a table (70 min later) there was some confusion with the check, we didn't actually have a server, no one checked on us at all. We asked for a check with a to-go box and some water. It took 10 minutes for the box to arrive, but had to get up to get our own water and we had to ask a 2nd time for the check.\n\nThe food was very good, and came out in a reasonable amount of time, so it seems like the kitchen folks were on their game. And again, the bartenders were very nice and seemed to care that things were going wrong, so that is why we are giving 2 stars instead of none.\n\nI had a similar experience at the Oakland B, too, so I think this is probably a case of bad management/systems, not bad employees.\n\nIf you have three hours to spare and want to hang out with some very freindly bartenders and experience good food, then please give them a shot. Not the best place if you are super hungry or in a hurry,", "author": "Tobie M."}

The menu, imo, is misrepresented, and  I was glad I didn't end up ordering more.\n\nThe soup, a puree of button mushrooms, had a bitter taste.  The chicken, a roasted breast, smoked thigh, and fried leg, were tasteless.  No flavor, or seasoning, or even a hint of chicken flavor.\n\nMy wife had the Heirloom Tomato Salad, and Sea Bass.  The tomato's were barely heirloom quality/taste.  It was 6 slices, 3 of which resembled a beef steak tomato!  The other looked like they could have been heirlooms, because of color, but it was hard to tell because they were sliced up thinly.  The sea bass wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good either.

My experience was completely different.\nFirst, the service was nice and professional, no qualms.\nThe restaurant was completely empty at 7:30 on a Saturday night. (Bad omen).\n\nAs another reviewer mentioned, we had the Tofu Bucco, it was basically grilled tofu (which I can get actually seasoned and herbed for a buck fifty at a deli) with spaghetti sauce.\n\nThe snapper was extremely salty, the purple potatoes, a limp, tepid afterthought.  The accompanying scallops were dry, chewy, almost like a Scallop Jerky?  It came with some hollandaise-like butter sauce and some sticky red sauce.  They had absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  I didn't find a single fresh herb in our entire meal. Maybe a sprinkle of basil in the spaghetti sauce (sorry milanaise sauce).\n\n This for a range of $15 to $18 an entree???  \n\nA big minus goes for no bread. Maybe it's too haute to serve bread.  But like Keller from Canteen said (i think), it really shows the quality of a restaurant and its chef by the simple things like how the bread tastes.\n\nAn atrocity in San Francisco", "author": "Dave Z."}

Of course, unless you want to be shunned while wearing your best business casual at Zeitgeist, pile into your minivan and trek over to The Ramp, or go into battle royale mode to snag one of probably only two spots outside any number of small pubs downtown, B Restaurant & Bar should be your new love affair. The designers, *insert designers names after the restaurant emails me back with it*, really used the surrounding environment to their advantage. Yerba Buena Gardens is such a lovely place, and even more lovely under the foliage lined, barrel vaulted colonnade outside the restaurant sipping on cocktails. They split the seating; half enclosed behind wall to wall glass and half outside, overlooking the gardens serene waterfall. (and sigh)*picture taken by Jaime K. from yelp..and very well done job I might add. \n\n\nDuring the day the restaurant's boast an organic look, the neutral colors blend well with the surrounding vegetation. The unnecessarily, ridiculously large (and quite amazing) pendant lighting over the bar fills the overhead air space, acting as a dividing element from the bar life to the dining life. And, I might add, something fun to gawk at. The space and locale is perfect for a calming business luncheon. During the night those unnecessarily, ridiculously large pendants do wonders for the interior materials. The mixture of lights and candles dance off what I am assuming is sandstone walls and dark wood based bar. Oh, the dramatic effect!\n\n\nWhose Who: PG rating. You can pretty much enjoy this spot for all ages. Could even be nice to take your kids to during the day; you enjoy a sip of wine, they frolic around the water fountain (under your close supervision of course). Really just fun for the whole family. Happy hour is extremely nice for the after work crowd. Night time is a little more PG-13 to NC 17. Take a date. Oogle at eachother across the table. Walk along the waterfall after dinner holding hands. Make sure to mind the bums. And enjoy!", "author": "Sheyna G."}

We frequent restaurants around 2nd and Howard whose prices are about $8-$12 for a lunch entree.  \nA few times we walked up past our good old Thirsty Bear and headed toward Yerba Buena Gardens to B Restaurant.  The first 2 times we went we were happy, they had good food, good location, nice outside seating.\nBut, and this is a big BUT, the last time we went will be the final time we visit B Restaurant.  We arrived at 11:45a (the time of our reservation), I had 3 stragglers but I knew what they wanted to order. We waited 10 minutes for our menus, thats right, 10 min just for the menus. Just to glance down and not see any of the items that used to be on the menu. We were told by our waiter that they had a completely different menu now and were not serving sandwiches at all any longer.  We all had to order items that were much more expensive then lunch entrees, food took about 45 min to come out, and we were one of the only tables seated for lunch. At one point I told our waiter that we had been waiting for a long time and he actually told me that we hadn't been waiting that long. I told him that I had folks that needed to get back to the office for 1o'clock meetings and he said that I shouldn't have expected to make a 12 o'clock reservation and get out by 1 but my reservation was actually 11:45a . I beg your pardon sir, but we can do it at Osha, Umbria, Thirsty Bear, Prana, everywhere else. When our order finally did come out it came out in pieces and dishes were missing. The waiter was complaining about the kitchen and blaming them for everything. I don't think that is very good customer service, a waiter should be the buffer between the kitchen and the customers. Our waiter did not do a good job.\nAt the end, my co-workers had to leave early, I complained to the manger who wasn't really listening. and found out that they had a supplemental lunch menu that had all our sandwiches on them. Jeesh! The manager said \"oh, you didn't get the supplemental menu\". I refused to pay the 18% gratuity automatically added to our check and gave the waiter what I thought he deserved.", "author": "Claudia M."}

Our fabulous server, Leonard, would beg to differ I'm sure. We loved the place so much that we couldn't resist asking him a ton of questions. We got answers (fun fact: the gorgeous interior design was done entirely by B's three owners); we also got fantastic service.  He was friendly without being invasive and he made excellent recommendations of wine, oysters and drinks. The ginger rickeys we started with were heavenly. Dinner was supurb-- B's greek salad has roasted new potatoes and doesn't go too heavy of the feta, giving the dish a light, nicoise kind of feel. The pork and the trout were drooly-outstanding and even the black-eyed peas that came with the fish were incredible.

An amusing part of the entree:  one of the ways the chicken was cooked was tempura-style.  I don't know why I was so amused.  Maybe it was because whenever I see chicken cooked this way, it's always in an asian restaurant.  It was nice seeing it elsewhere.  Anyway, battered and deep fried, it was a good balance with the bbq'd chicken and seared (?) chicken (which I have to add, was perfectly moist and seasoned, sitting on a bed of sauce and mushrooms).

This place is not easily visible from the main street, but its hidden and quiet location (on the second story of Yerba Buena Gardens) is part of what makes it so charming. It has a spectacular view of the surrounding buildings of the Financial District, and if the day is warm (which is pretty rare in S.F.), their large outdoor seating area is an ideal spot for an after-work drink or an early dinner. I have not gone there during true dinner hours, but I have been there 3-4 times for happy hour, when they feature $5 selected drinks and selected appetizer specials (you can still order off the main menu, though, and if you do, I highly recommend the pork sandwich and the baked oysters!). The two drinks that I adore from the happy menu are the \"Love On,\" which is a shockingly pink concoction that shockingly, is not overly sweet. It has quite a nice kick to it, actually. The other great drink is the fresh grapefruit or blood orange juice with vodka. I used to work a few blocks from here on Market Street, and it was my favorite spot for a sophisticated but casual happy hour. I will definitely stop by next time I'm back in San Francisco.

I started wioth the cesar salad (I am pretty traditional). I guess I didn't read the fine print because after I had started chowing down on this delicious and beautifully presented salad my friend mentioned that the sauce was made with tofu (I have a very childish reaction to the wonder-soy-food . ..\"blech\") but it was too late, I loved it!

Angus beef and fried feta! it also came with diced potatos in traditional color and purple, they were seasoned well and a perfect compliment to the burger (I think it had some homemade sauces as well).

Even though my friend stated what she wanted on her burger twice and the waiter wrote it down and repeated it outloud, it did not come out correctly. It took a while to get it because our waiter was mia. We actually had to flag down a bus boy. Because of food allergies, I asked if I could get a side from an entree for one of my 3 sides combo. The waiter immediately said no. Eventually this was overturned. Unfortunately our food did not come out together, quite possibly because it was not called in. It took a good 15 min for my friend's burger extras and the rest of our order to come out. The truffle fries needed more truffle flavor. I probably won't come back.

The service had the fantastic double whammy of being both pretentious and slow, though I couldn't help but love the guy for his lyrical descriptions of the menu items (\"Airline\" chicken being my favorite). I chose the flank steak, which was beautifully presented (Iron Chef style plating, very impressive)... but cold!! My irritation was complete when I realized two other parties sat after us and were served their food before. So my plate was in the kitchen cooling off as I was starving in the dining room. I've worked in restaurants, so I never send things back, but upon leaving I realized I really should have. If this had been done right -- faster service the main sticking point -- I could have really enjoyed the place. But a cold steak just isn't worth the money for me. The three stars are for the beautiful ambience, great bar scene and healthy, local sustainable ingredients. I might give it another try, but I'd likely avoid the dinner service and just stay for happy hour.", "author": "Isabel D."}

I sat down at my table at 7:08p.m. and told the waiter that we had an 8 o'clock show at YBCA.  So we ordered right away.  7:50 p.m our meal arrives.  Needless to say I was not happy and I shoved it down in 5 min and ran to the concert.  Disorganized staff and poor time management in the kitchen.", "author": "DHVA S."}

Great decor, service, and food - a definite place to check out in the city.  Happy hour is fabulous there too, my friends and I agree that they serve the best ceviche!  Three partners with a passion and believe me it shows...go treat yourself and enjoy.  See you there!", "author": "Sar L."}
