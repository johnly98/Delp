When she brings it to me, there is not hot sauce. I ask her AGAIN, and she brings one. I said, \"excuse me, I ordered 4 entrees - can I at least have 4?\". She huffed and puffed and threw 3 more my way. \n\nTonight, I ordered my food delivery via Yelp. I put specific instructions 3 times saying \"please include hot sauce/chili oil with each entree\".

For delivery, it came with the soup and all the ingredients with the sizzling rice on the side, dry for you to add yourself. And the soup was really warm when it arrived! Warm enough that the rice still sizzled when I put it in the soup. I was impressed. I got the large size and only ate half and felt satisfied.

That was the case for us but after dining in, I'm sure I'll be back specifically for Chang's food and not just San Tung's! \n\nThe restaurant itself is really quite clean, and the staff there are pretty welcoming - not your typical \"I-don't-give-a-toot\" attitude you'd find at Chinese restaurants. \n\nFOODDDDS:\n-Spicy Dry Fried Chicken Wings: These were delicious. Crispy. Juicy. Full of flavor. However, I was disappointed that our plate of wings was not spicy at all. In fact, it was more on the sweet side. The flavor is good, just not what I was looking for. \n-Spicy String Beans: YUMMMM I have to say that this was one of the better tasting string beans I've had. SO FULL of flavor - garlicky spicy saucy goodness. I actually dipped my wings in this sauce because of how much I liked it.\n-Shanghai Steamed Dumplings: Average buns of soupy goodness. I wouldn't necessarily crave these or come back specifically for these, but they're good.\n-Shrimp & Chive Dumplings: I think I might be biased because I have a special place in my heart for dumplings. My boyfriend didn't really care for these but I thought they were absolutely delicious in a comforting way. The dumpling skins were boiled to perfection, still had that chew to it. The filling was full of flavor - large pieces of shrimp and the chives didn't overpower the taste of the dumpling as a whole. I could probably eat like 2 orders of these by itself. \n\nAll that food only came out to less than $40. I might not necessarily come back for the wings but I would definitely come back for their DUMPLANGSSSSSSS.", "author": "Ava F."}

A Metal SCREW! I called the restaurant to let them know. I was transferred to the owner who promptly scolded me for not telling the driver about the contaminant when he dropped off the food. How I was supposed to know that he was handing me food with hardware in it is beyond me. After multiple calls back and forth to eat24 and Changs kitchen, the manager promised me a full refund, but then told eat24 that she was only refunding the dish with the life-threatening ingredient. It is truly maddening and passive aggressive, but that is the way they chose to address this serious problem. Of course we won't be eating any of the food that came with this order, but I am out 130 bucks for the pleasure. Their food is not worth dental damage, choking, or any other serious threat to your health.

Before our meal ended, he came with a little stuffed bear to give it to my son, my son came up to him and gave him a hug. \nThat sweet gesture is something that we did not expect. It made an impact on my son and made him really happy, now he wants to bring Mr. Bears anywhere we go (that's what he named the toy).

We didn't plan on coming here, but the spot we went to initially had a long wait, so we decided to try this place out. Glad we did! Being from SF, we have been seeing less and less good places to grab chinese/Asian food. All the local spots are slowly changing the quality of their food and it's leaving us with barely anywhere to go. \n\nWe only ordered a few dishes to try and they were all pretty tasty. \n- The pan fried noodles are a good portion. We got it with beef and Chinese broccoli. \n- The salt and pepper halibut is good. Also good portion. \n- The Mongolian triple meat is good. It's got a good tasty spice to it, not just heat. Next time we are gonna ask for that over the pan fried noodles. Lol! \n - the Singapore rice noodles seemed a bit smaller in portion, but it's got a lot of ingredients in it and not just the noodles. (Just maybe add a dash of salt) \n- last but not least, the dry-fried chicken wings were really good. Not sure if that's the name of the dish on the menu, but it's pretty much the translated name. It has a sweet glaze and spice sauce on it. The wings were pretty big in size and filling. The dish came with 10 wings and we were surprised. Yayy!!! Who doesn't love tasty wings! My mom doesn't eat spicy food, so we ordered it without the spice. Still tasty! \n\nGonna come back and try some other dishes.", "author": "Helen W."}

If you are in the hospitality business your JOB (the thing you get paid for) is to serve people. Don't expect to get paid more on top of your paycheck. If you aren't making enough, go find a different job or complain to your employer about it. Anyone who justifies tips as being a \"thing\" is feeding the stereotype that I am responsible for the well being of the servers and delivery people. \nI have lived in Asia and Europe and guess what: servers have a good life and we don't tip them. They have houses, cars, and kids and they are able to pay for everything with their jobs because the moment their paycheck doesn't make them happy, they complain about it with their freaking employer, not their paying customer (who btw, are making sure you get to keep your job). \nThis is vent after the delivery guy said that driving 2 miles for 6 minutes is \"far away\" and I should tip him more. Should I also pay for your gas? and maybe calculate the freaking depreciation on your car? This idiot was loud and disruptive. Their food isn't good. I still order it because of the convenience.

A few friends and I wanted to grab a bite and the consensus  was Chang's Kitchen. We decided to carpool. Two cars total. We parked about five blocks away and walked. I didn't mind because it was, once again, a beautiful sunny day.\n\nWe had reserved a table and they accommodated our party of 12 as per our reservation. Good stuff. I looked around, it wasn't necessarily packed but it wasn't necessarily empty either. The staff came promptly to take our order. After taking our orders, the staff hung back and stood around surveying the restaurant. The food came fast and hot. Wait a minute... we had ordered rice but where were our rice bowls? \"Excuse me, can we get 12 rice bowls?\" I asked. \"Why do you need rice bowls? Can't you eat rice on your plates?\" was the response. Me and my friends were taken aback. Never have we experienced this at a restaurant before. Never mind. The food is here, we'll eat the rice on our plates to prevent further commotion. \n\nThe day proceeded as we had otherwise planned. Good food, good company. Chicken wings, Ma Po tofu, Mongolian beef, string beans and a couple of other miscellaneous run of the mill Asian dishes. It was good, my hunger was satiated. A few minutes passed by like seconds and it was already time for the check.  We had leftovers. \"Can we get a takeout box?\" It was me who asked once again since i also spoke Cantonese, which the staff of this restaurant spoke. \".....\" No answer. She proceeded to take away our food and our plates, never to be seen again. Once again, our friends and I were dumbfounded. \n\nAt the end of it all, we ate, we paid and we left. Good riddance.", "author": "Wing C."}

Food came out very quickly, portions were generous, and the service was amazing -- our waiter was extremely gracious and attentive, and even set down dishes and teapots gently, a rarity in Chinese restaurants. \n\nDry Fried Chicken Wing: ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! Not the typical kind of thing we order from a Chinese restaurant, but they were hot, crispy and sweet on the outside, and savory on the inside. Wings were meaty, not those dainty bony wings that make you feel ripped off. Comes with a side of steamed broccoli to make you feel better about yourself for eating fried chicken. Yummy yummy definitely would order again\n\nHouse Special Chow Mein: flavorful and hot. Just a tad on the oily side but that just means you get to slurp the noodles more easily\n\nShanghai Styled Rice Cake: honestly pretty same flavor as the house special chow mein, but with rice cake. Also delicious and chewy and hot, with a bit too much oil for my taste. \n\nMinus one star for the MSG headache afterwards.

NOOO. SOB. How could they be on vacation? :(\n\nSo we walked across the street to Chang's Kitchen and we read the reviews there as well. It didn't seem too bad and decent enough and so we gave it a try. We came in and got a table for 4 and saw that most of their orders were for pick up, rather than for in store. It does have a lot of housing around, so I can see them just picking up and going home to the family for dinner.\n\nSat down, got wonton strips with sweet and sour sauce, which I liked haha. The reviews said to get the chicken wings, and indeed we did. Chicken wings were good. Like the sauce around was excellent. It was a tad spicy and was sweet and had a lot of sauce. Finger lickin' good. The inside was moist, rather than dry, so that was good as well.\n\nThe rice ovalets- not enough sauce. Wayyyy too little sauce. They had longer elongated rice ovalets and had mushrooms, carrrots, and cabbage with some pork. It was \"healthy\" it seemed, I guess but just not enough sauce.\n\nGarlic beef- This one was really good. Had good sauce, had peas (yay vegetables) and would have gone great if we had bowls of rice( they offered, we declined).\n\nFood comes out reasonably quickly, service was good, as they can speak both Canto and English. At night, you can watch them prepping for the next day, as they were peeling pea ends on a table in the back. \n\nIf San Tung is busy, give Chang's a try!

I've seen Chang's open up across the street, but never bothered with it. Tonight, we decided to look at the menu and we have them a shot.\n\nPlace was fairly clean and hardly decorated. The staff were nice and we were seated immediately in a mostly empty dining room. We ordered a few things, here's how it went:\n\nChicken Corn Soup. Basic and decent, but too much starch. It was almost on the brink of ruining the soup. Flavor was there. They need to refine this.\n\nBuddha's Delight. Tofu cubes tossed with rice noodles, mushrooms, celery, black fungus and snow peas was good. I've seen better presentation, but it tasted about as good as the one I had with the more interesting presentation, so it doesn't matter. I would order this again.\n\nHouse Special Fried Rice. Decided to get this instead of buying white rice by the bowls. It had shrimp, chicken and pork bits. It was good and that's not a bad rating on the dish. It means I would order it again. It didn't blow me away and it didn't disappoint me.\n\nGeneral Tso's Chicken. This... Wonderfully prepared! Not too sweet, not too salty, not drenched in sauce, but could be more spicy for Asian customers. Nice sized chunks of chicken in a wonderful crunchy fried batter. Excellent. I would surely come back just for this.\n\nThis restaurant was stumbled upon among stiff competition on the block.

It took roughly 15 minutes to get over to the restaurant. I found parking across the street which was perfect!!! I walked over after I parked and took a moment to look at the menu in the window, WOW! All the pictures made me hungry. This place has some really GOOD food. I thought about getting something else to add to my lunch but I chose to just get my food. \n\nI went inside and saw that this place was not busy yet. I thought noon time would mean lots of customers but it looked like I had gotten here before the rush! I went on up to the counter and told them the greeter that I was picking up an order. To my surprise my food was ready and waiting for me. This was surprising because the confirmation email that I received told me that my food would be ready in 45 minutes! It pays to get here early. I talked with one of the gentleman that works here, he may be the owner but I am not sure! I told him that I typically go to San Tung and he laughed and said, \"Oh no, you should come here from now on\". He is a funny guy! After I paid for my food I headed to my ride and booked towards my house. After making a few more stops I finally made it home.\n\nI laid out my food and opened the box. Cool, the food smelled good and I was excessively hungry. The meal, exquisite in every way imaginable! Great blend of spices and peppers which created a dynamic taste for this meal. I should have asked for more soy sauce though but I was able to manage with one packet. \n\nCHECK THIS PLACE OUT! There is plenty of seating here if you decide to come with a large party as well. Or just order online and get some take out. \n\n#kitcheninthename #cookingistheirgame #hotplate #can'twait", "author": "Robert F."}

Spot on delivery time based on estimated arrival of 8:11pm \nOrder:\n*Beef & Black Bean Chow Fun - the picture looked overly sauced so I added \"light sauce please\" to the notes. They listened...maybe too well. Good smoky, funky black bean taste, plenty of meat, a few fresh veggies for good measure but touch more sauce needed. Next time I'll just take it as they see fit. \n*Yang Chow Fried Rice - Shrimp! Several plump, juicy shrimp! Nice light stir fry, not greasy with a good variety of veg, chicken and SHRIMP!\n*Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings - fat little drums & flats. Crispy despite being in a box or delivery. Don't overlook the garlicky jalape\u00f1o cabbage hiding at the bottom of said box. Mighty tasty on the fried rice. (The menu says 6 pieces, we got 8)\n*Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce - a lot of crisp cooked tasty greens. Again asked for light sauce, perfect for this\n*Bonus FREE Egg Fried Rice - didn't try yet, still loving on those plump little shrimp. I'm sure it'll be great with a fried egg tomorrow.  \nOh, and the nice delivery guy...great smile!\nWill definitely order again.", "author": "Us And J."}

We heard about the fabulous wings at San Tung and decided it was worth the detour. Unfortunately, we didn't think to check if they were open or not... we saw a sign on the door saying that they were closed for a couple weeks for a vacation. Oh man!! Were we ever disappointed! At this point we were hungry and willing to go anywhere, so we went across the street just to get anything in our systems.\n\nWe were greeted promptly and seated by a friendly server. I decided to order the black pepper steak short ribs and the dry fried wings. I was determined to get wings, even if I couldn't have San Tung's! The black pepper short ribs were great. I've had much more tender short ribs back home but these were tasty and it was a good portion for the price. The wings though, they were fantastic!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-07-16", "description": "Quite befuddled at the high reviews on this page: my experience at Chang's was quite disappointing. Like everyone else, I went here when San Tung was closed. It appears that in some ways, this is San Tung's grandson or younger cousin - when it really just lacks anything close. Of course, if you're looking for cheap Chinese, I suppose this could work. However...\n\n...the food is absolutely disappointing. The lunch special is your traditional Chinese restaurant lunch special - hot-and-sour soup, rice, your entree, and a fortune cookie. I got the Kung Pao Prawns, and counted five prawns on a massive dish. To make matters worse, the \"Kung Pao\" sauce was just slathered on hot sauce that was numbing spicy, and the vegetables were hardly cooked down (the celery and bell peppers all had a raw, bitter snap to them - a sign that they had barely been cooked). Additionally, the celery (who puts celery in Kung Pao dishes) was cu way too big, making it difficult to eat.\n\nSimilarly, a friend ordered the chicken wings, which are theoretically like San Tung's. Uh, I guess? They're sweet, and a tad spicy, but nowhere near ST. (Again, cheap Chinese, sure, authentic or similar to ST, no). The dish came with two measly pieces of raw broccoli which appeared more like decoration - if it should be decoration, at least make it edible. The broccoli was not cleaned nor had its leaves removed. Quite disgusting, to say the least.\n\nNot to mention, the waiter forgot the soup. And the fortune cookie. And the spacing of our dishes was awful - I received my dish immediately after ordering, and fifteen minutes later, as I finished, my friend received his.\n\nThe service is sweet - the waiters are attentive, albeit a bit clumsy (I never received a menu and had to ask for one multiple times). However, good service doesn't make up for clumsy food. If ST closes, go next door - unless you truly are craving some really cheap Chinese eats. But don't compare it to San Tung.", "author": "Bobby W."}

I order the sesame chicken, deep fried chicken wings, and dumplings.\n\nTo Jan Carlo below, if you've got a large party, a baked in tip is usually standard. It's not just the tip fee charge, there is the SF Restaurant Health Care surcharge of 4% plus the 9.5% Sales tax and then the 15% - 18% tip. Are you really complaining about a $53 total bill when you had a party of 6 or more? Are you serious? Blame the government if you need to blame somebody for all your taxes.\n\nI hope you didn't spend too much on your law degree. Because I'd ask for a refund if you're willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars in law school tuition a year and yet complain about a 15% tip that equals $12? How are you going to win any cases when you can't understand the other side? If you want to save money, eat out less often or eat less. \n\nLearn some EMPATHY. The waiters and owner don't speak the best English, so they probably had a hard time conveying the rules. They work hard every day earning near min wages to please customers like you who couldn't give a damn. Be kind to others, and others will be kind to you.", "author": "Jacob J."}

Very flavorful but maybe a tad too much...\n\nFOOD: I came here for a group meeting and we ordered and shared a bunch of dishes, some includes string beans, coconut shrimp, fried rice, chow mien, fried chicken wings...Very traditional food you would find in any \"Chinese\" restaurant. Why the quotation marks? Because to be honest you would never find any of these dishes in a real Chinese restaurant, because they have been customized to suit the American taste buds. Everything tasted good, but the flavor is too overwhelming for me - either too sweet, or too salty. I felt really thirsty that night, probably because all of the sodium (and MSG ??)...\n\nSETTING: Very typical Chinese restaurant - family-style. And it's right across from its fried chicken rival - Sun Tung! Both fried chicken tasted good to me. \n\nSERVICE: Very friendly servers and the dishes came out very quickly. \n\nPRICE: The food was covered but I think the price is within the typical price range ($10-15/dish). The portion sizes are also pretty big - definitely enough for 2 meals if you are eating alone! \n\nOVERALL IMPRESSION: Pretty good comfort food but ONLY ONCE IN A WHILE!!

Judging by the menu and the food, I would say that either it's new ownership or at least new management. They were packed that night and we had to wait a bit for our takeout order, but the food was really good. \n\nWe had the dry fried chicken wings--they were awesome, though we ordered medium and I would have liked them a bit spicier, so next time I will order spicy instead. However the other food we ordered medium was pretty spicy (the sauteed string beans and Mongolian beef). The string beans were some of the best I've had--sometimes those can be kind of soggy, but the string beans were still a little crunchy, nice and spicy, great flavor and texture. The beef was really good too. We also got the pork fried rice, which is also some of the best fried rice I've had--not greasy at all like fried rice sometimes is. The crab rangoon were OK, but probably the least exciting of the dishes (though crab rangoon is kind of always exciting anyway). \n\nWe'll definitely go back now.

Once you go in, you get seated and there's already forks on the table. That should be red flag number one. Instead, we got a menu and we got General Tso's chicken, chow fun, and the dry fried chicken wings. The chow fun was by far the best thing there and the General Tso and chicken wings were both not good. The General Tso's chicken was mostly breading with no chicken whatsoever. The chicken wings were too sweet and breaded as well. Lets just say... you should just endure the wait across the street at San Tung and enjoy the best wings in the city......", "author": "Stephanie W."}

If you crave a quiet environment where you can actually hear the people you're speaking with, fast and friendly service, fresh food, and the bonus of a television, come on over to Chang's.\n\nThe lunch special runs until 3pm (fairly late--most end at 2pm) and comes with rice, soup (hot & sour) and an egg roll. The soup is not too spicy and the egg roll lacks the artificial red sweet and sour sauce other places douse their egg rolls in: you can taste the freshness and crispiness. The portion of the lunch special entree is smaller than other places though, so a balance adjustment in the ratio of rice:entree would be good.\n\nYes, the bathrooms are very clean and spacious.

Cooked well, the noodles were a great texture and the flavor was there. \n\nDry Fried Chicken Wings - Yum. Hot and fresh crunchy with the right amount of sauce. \n\nGarlic Pork - Others liked this, but for me it was a bit too sweet. \n\nSoup Dumplings - I've had better ones elsewhere, but these weren't bad. \n\nAll of the food came pretty quickly. In typical Chinese restaurant fashion they brought out each dish as it was ready, which means it is fresher, but you don't get everything right away.

The honey walnut prawn puts Panda Express to shame with its perfect glaze and flavor.  The roasted duck was just the right amount of fat under the crispy skin and had more than enough to go around.

Don't be fooled by the lack of a 90 minute line though, Chiang's has food which is mighty delicious, if not quite on par with its neighbor.\n\nOur group of 3 showed up around 445 and we're greeted by an empty restaurant.  Although a bit unnerving, this also meant that we were instantly seated.  Our servers were a bit slow to take our order, but not egregiously bad.\n\nOur group got an order of pork buns, some general tso's chicken, and the Mongolian lamb.  I've been around the country trying variations on the good general's chicken, and let me tell you, nothing compares to what Chang's makes.  The outside has a perfectly crispy crust, and the sauce had a delightful mix of sweet, tangy, and just a bit of a kick.  Is it authentic chinese? Probably not.  Had I forgotten all about my lack of San Tung by the second bite?  Absofreakinglutely.\n\nThe pork buns were a bit on the small side and we're not quite as world - altering as the chicken, but they were definitely tasty and hit the pork bun spot which had been neglected for far too long.  I didn't get to try any of the lamb, but my girlfriend wouldn't let me steal her leftovers, so that's a seal of approval from her.\n\nThe portions weren't huge, but they also weren't tiny.  Plus, at around $9 for a main, the price is definitely right for food this delicious.\n\nTaken together, Ching's isn't perfect,  but it delivers very tasty food at a reasonable price.  The service could be a bit quicker, but that's really the only gripe I have about this place.  If I'm ever craving a meeting with General Tso again I'll happily venture out to the Sunset to meet him here..", "author": "Jonathan M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-02-18", "description": "I've been wanting to try this place for months, so I ordered pickup tonight for the first time, and the food was, no lie: disgusting. I'm honestly shocked at the five star reviews. It was BAD -- compared to any other junk-food Chinese delivery place (which I absolutely crave all the time), and certainly compared to real, authentic Chinese places. I only ate a few bites and I'm about to throw out the rest because I don't even want it sitting in my fridge.\n\nThe walnut prawns were just overwhelmed with greasy batter sweating with mayonnaise -- and cutting them open I realized the shrimp wasn't cleaned well. That essentially means that there was a line of shrimp sh*t in my food.\n\nThe \"tender veggies with garlic\" was my attempt at eating some greens. It's a really simple dish -- hard to mess up -- but the bok choy was watery and stringy with random hard pieces. Like, bok choy does not have seeds -- what was I biting into that was hard? Ew. For the record, Yummy Yummy across the street has \"seasonal veggies\", made with the same ingredients, and it's 100x better.\n\nThe fried rice was edible for a few bites. I'm sure some people would like it -- there's nothing horrible about it -- but nothing great about it, either. After a few bites I didn't want to look at it anymore.\n\nBut the biggest letdown was the CRAB RANGOON. This was the reason I ordered Chinese food tonight -- I was craving crab rangoon like nothing else. Theirs was flat, boring batter, liquidy cream cheese with a celery aftertaste and chunks of really bad imitation crab. You can't understand how sad I feel right now.\n\nMy advice: get delivery from Emmy's if you want your greasy fried rice and crab rangoon fix. It's the best guilty-pleasure Chinese I've found in the city. Go to Yummy Yummy for great, garlicky vegetables (and a lot of other great stuff). Go to Burma Superstar for delicious honey walnut shrimp. And for any other Chinese dish, go ANYWHERE ELSE other than here.", "author": "Laura W."}

Our group was deciding where to go for lunch when we passed Chang's Kitchen. Sophie and her husband happen to have the surname of Chang, so I jokingly suggested that we should eat at \"their\" restaurant. The funny thing is that we actually ended up eating here as it was one of the few nicer-looking eateries that was open on New Year's Day.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that the menu had a huge selection of items. I didn't do an exact count, but I estimate there were well over 150 dishes. The prices were also pretty attractive, with many of the entr\u00e9es being in the sub-$10 range. Even the daily specials were relatively cheap.\n\nThe food itself was pretty good. Per family tradition, each of us ordered different dishes to share; the salmon fried rice was my personal favorite, but everything else was also delicious. Although Mom noted the salmon in the fried rice was slightly overcooked, and that the food made her thirsty for some time, the three of us overall enjoyed everything.\n\nThe interior of Chang's Kitchen is pretty small, and our group easily took up two-fifths of the tables. The restaurant was mostly empty when we arrived, but it did become a little crowded when more people started showing up. But other than the limited seating and the saltiness of some of the food, I have no real complaints.\n\n-- TL;DR version --\n\nHighs: Huge menu selection; great prices\nLows: Somewhat crowded interior; food is somewhat thirst-inducing\nFinal verdict: Chang's Kitchen offers a huge variety of good Chinese food at extremely affordable prices.\nBottom line: 4.1 stars (rounded down to four)", "author": "Danny C."}

It was more like chopped celery with a few snow peas thrown in.\n\nThe best part is that after eating I didn't get really thirsty, which is usually a tell tale sign of MSG, right?

Word of warning that the Mongolian beef chow mein was really spicy (but so tasty). One tip if you want wings - pick the salt and pepper wings (I think this is what it's called?) over the deep fried - deep fried is slightly bland, while the other one is flavorful. \n\nGood service, good prices; we ordered 6 appetizers/entrees for 7 people, which came out to about $8.50 a person (including tax and tip!) - and everyone was very full by the end too!", "author": "Jane D."}

In comparison with the San tung wings across the street, they have different flavors but very similar. They were both good. Lines were shorter. What grossed us out was that while we were eating, they were rolling out huge trash cans through the front ruby next to us. I was a little thrown off but I didn't let it bother me... the first time. The man did this three times. Isn't that a health code violation or something to bring huge garbage cans through the dining area? I'm not sure who the owners are, I'm sure they're nice gard working people but the trash needs to be taken out the back or if that's not possible, wait until your customers are all gone before pulling it through the dining area so as to not ruin the dining experience. Also, as we were finishing up around closing time, the server comes up to us and says \"we closed. Ok? Ok.\" I understand you want to go home and I respect your hours but you should let your customers finish their food. That was really rude. She was also a little forgetful and flustered throughout the whole meal. Maybe she's never served before but I don't see San tung kicking out their customers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-04-17", "description": "When i first came here last year it was because San Tung's line was too long. The elderly gentleman who served us was very nice, so we came here a second time. Because the first time that we came here they charge rice per person x 2, so we assumed it was the same, but when the check came they had charged us by the bowl. After pointing this out they took this off our check. Today, the elderly gentleman was no longer working there and the elderly woman/owner at the register brought the check with the total amount so I asked her to itemize it. When we ordered from the waitress we clearly asked her if rice was charged per person or by the bowl and confirmed it was per person. After the owner return with the itemized check, not only did she overcharge us for the rice but they charged us per bowl. The menu price was $1.45, but she charged us $1.60. When I pointed this out to the waitress and she brought it back to the owner she got yelled at by the owner. First of all I did not appreciate when members of my own Chinese community try to cheat people because it reflects on the rest of us. Most other customers would not ask for an itemized receipt. Second of all, I don't appreciate owners yelling at their employees so loudly (because a customer pointed out something that they try to do that was unethical) that the whole restaurant could hear. As I pointed out in another review I wish my Chinese cousins would learn that the loss of customers is not worth the extra $0.15 they're making nickel-and-diming every customer that doesn't check their bill. By the way we can hear Chang in the kitchen calling another employee a bitch. No more Chang's Kitchen for me!", "author": "K T."}

CK cannot be compared to san tung! why do you think it's a 90 min wait, case closed! the couple who ordered the dinner for 2, well, guess what, these were assembled for non chinese not insulting anyone, to each their own!

So my order was missing these things again, so i contacted delivery.com & the rep was fully understanding my request & was super helpful. as i was chatting with her online the driver returned with utensils & napkins. the thing was what he said, whether it was true or not, he expressed his feelings which was uncalled for. All they did was blame each other & what goes on between them should be between them & not passed on to us the consumer. back to my complaint, driver said his mgr who is the owner biitched to my wife that she loss money on this order. at this point i had enough & spoke to a mgr at delivery.com & he spoke to Jenny the owner, she apologized after their long conversation. she offered to give me one spring roll  to amend the confusion,  i told delivery.com that the 1 spring roll is included on every order. I am not going to accept that offer it's invalid as an offer, besides that is not my idea of a springroll, it's an eggroll that is so cheap to make, yet they charge over a dollar for one, unreal!
