Who doesn't love a local, authentic Taco truck conveniently located for a late-night-grab-n-go?\n\n- Ordered 2 Tacos: Chicken & beef ($ 3 each-NOMS). And Quesadillas ($8 for 2). The chicken taco comes w/ shredded marinated chicken, cilantro, onions, salsa, lime, and radish. Very delicious! \n\nThe beef taco comes with diced beef & everything else same. Fresh, authentic tortilla + a spice of mild salsa. Meat & salsa together creates great texture & overall very satisfying. (****4 stars for the Tacos!***)\n\n- HOWEVER. This review is mainly for the Quesadilla. I've asked the lady \"Is Quesadilla vegetarian?\" The lady said yes. My 2 Quesadilla came w/ NO CHEESE, and RICE + BEANS!? (what kind of quesadilla is this.....it looks like an unwrapped burrito) \n\nMoreover, the Quesadilla includes a strange-tasting dressing.... that tastes like thousand island.... (By this time I'm so confused by what I've ordered... ***pictures below*****)\n\n- I believe there might be a miscommunication, maybe a language barrier (I do not speak Spanish). I definitely don't think they intentionally did this. However, I was expecting my quesadilla to be cheesy!!!! Even if it was a burrito, it should be communicated to me........... \n\n- The staff actually answered my phone, when I called to ask for their accurate closing time. Good customer service in terms of being attentive on phone. \n\n- Taco truck is located in front of Best Buy. There are plenty of parking!!", "author": "Jess W."}

If memory serves me right, I've had this bookmarked for over 5 years. \n\nDue to it's location, I rarely go to the area as it's always out of my way. \n\nThis past Sunday as the Wifey picked me up from work, she wanted to go to Tartine Bakery. I took Harrison St. as it was the quickest way towards the Mission District and as I was passing by Best Buy on 14th St., I caught a glimpse of the Taco Truck parked on the side of the curb. I quickly made a U-turn and parked in the lot. \n\nThere were only a few people in line and it went by quick. Like any typical Taco Truck, the menu is posted on the side of the truck. Wifey ordered the Bucha and I opted for the regular burrito and choose Lengua for protein. Aside from the aforementioned protein, they also have Asada, Al Pastor, Pollo, Pollo Asado, Carnitas, Cabeza, Tripitas and Vegeteriano for them plant-eating people. \n\nUnlike some other Taco Trucks, our order came out quick and super fast. (Take note here) Wifey's Buche Taco was doused with a large amount of salsa verde that it was drowning and the meat needed to be recucitated. On it's own, the meat was OK, but it was overpowered by the sauce. \n\nMy Lengua was filled with inconsistency in terms of flavor and texture. I love Lengua, and I love that the meat is tender, moist and pops with bold, gamy, wonderful flavors....all were lacking in their version. Which dawned on me that they probably had everything prepped and reheated so that's why it came out fast. \n\nI prefer mines cooked to order so they won't dry while wilting under a heat lamp. \n\nI don't know what happened, but whatever they did in the past they're certainly not doing it now.

If health was not an issue, I could probably eat it every meal for the rest of my life. Peruvian, Salvadorean, Puerto Rican, you name it and I love it. Anyway, El Tonayense just happens to serve up my favorite taco in the Bay Area. It's just a truck parked outside Best Buy in the SoMa, but it's probably the most delicious, authentic, no-frills taco you can find. The guys who work here are super nice and never interrupt my miserable attempt at speaking their native language; they just speak back to me in Spanish and if I don't understand something, \"Si\" is still a safe bet. I also love how they kind of do their own thing instead of participating at Off the Grid or SoMa StrEat Food Park.\n\nHow To El Tonayense Like a Pro...\n1) Park in the Best Buy lot and bring cash. (Avoid the lunch rush, if possible!)\n2) Order the Asada, Al Pastor, and Lengua/tongue (if you are adventurous). Order a horchata to split with someone since it is very sweet and gets to be too much if you drink it alone...hopefully you're not there eating alone. Ask them to separate the tacos on a couple paper plates...this becomes important later.\n3) After getting your food, go back to your car and eat it on top of the trunk, standing up. It is most often windy here, so try to use the cup of horchata as a paperweight for the napkins. USE THE LIME THEY GIVE YOU. Sometimes it's a lemon slice. Make sure you each have a plate and eat ABOVE IT so that the taco goodness doesn't drip everywhere.\n4) Buy wet naps somewhere because there will be a lingering smell on your fingertips for hours. Although the taco smelled fantastic, the smell afterward does not.\n5) Walk off whatever you just ate at nearby Sports Basement or Potrero Center.", "author": "Olivia V."}

It's a little fatty, but that's the best part, and will contribute to the flavors!\n\nI would recommend finding a curb nearby to enjoy your food--literally street food.

Just that a taco truck that sells regular tacos are becoming (relatively) harder to find!\n\nAfter meeting up with a friend at the SoMa Best Buy, we wandered across the parking lot to grab ourselves a snack on a cold night.  The tacos are pretty darn cheap considering how loaded they are - $1.95 for a taco chock full of meatiness goodness and topped with Jalapeno strips (we got them spicy).  I forgot to count the exact number of choices they list (maybe about eight?), but their menu offers a variety of meats to choose from.  Since I wasn't feeling too particularly frisky, opted to go with just a carnitas taco, while my friend went for a carne asada and a beef tongue.\n\nThe carnitas were really moist and flavorful, although I didn't get much of a bite/crunch that I thought I would get.  Regardless though, I liked the sauce for the carnitas and was really glad that the meat wasn't all dried out.  The jalapeno strips definitely gave it some heat, but not overpoweringly so.  I didn't get a chance to try my friend's carne asada taco, but I did get to steal a piece of beef tongue.  I've had beef tongue before and for whatever reason, I expected the meat to be a little on the tough side.  Instead, it was actually pretty tender.\n\nAfter ordering, I kinda wish I had ordered more than just my one taco, but I resisted the urge since it looked as though they were getting ready to pack up for the night.

I've been coming to this spot for years, but count your change, and make sure you get your extras before they forget. Or order with Square, so they have a record of what you paid for. There used to be a truck owned by I believe a Puerto Rican guy. He had good stuff, too. Then Tonayense took over. Satisfying burritos and tacos. And I'd 98% of the time leave at least $1 tip for my one burrito or 2-3 tacos. Even before they were ever on TV, and before the trucks were painted with flames. I sent SF noobs to this truck, and after living here almost 20 years, that's a lot of  customers, many of whom became loyal, repeat customers like me. The last few years, I've been paying the higher prices at this truck because I like to support local businesses even though my salary hasn't gone up 30% in that time like the prices have. Now the other day, I was prepping for a looong-awaited court date (I was the plaintiff) at Office Depot making last minute copies and such, and I knew I needed to eat a dose of protein and drink a shot of caffeine, or I'd likely pass out from low blood sugar right in front of the judge. I grabbed $10 cash with not a lot of time left to get to Civic Center. I ordered 3 tacos. It was $7-something. And a can of Diet Coke, which made it $9.35. She gave me the change, and I threw it straight into the propinas cup. I felt bad for it not being at least a dollar, but I was in a hurry and don't think I even had a dollar bill in my car. She said, \"Thank you,\" but didn't give me the Coke right away like they usually do. Fine, I'll stand over by the pick up window and check which court room I need to go to, etc. So my tacos are ready, and I ask for the Diet Coke. He asks me to pay for it. I said I paid for it. There's discussion in the truck. She comes over and says she gave me $2 something change. I said no, you gave me the whatever 65 cents change, and I put it in the propinas cup. She said it didn't matter if I put the $2.xx in the cup for a tip (which I get - what you put in the tip jar doesn't pay for stuff), that I still needed to pay for the soda. But I did pay for it. All I would've had to do was check my pockets to not find $1.xx change because I would've put a dollar bill in the cup, not the coins. Normally, I would've just walked away. Fine, keep the soda. But I was going to battle in court and need caffeine and didn't have time to stop anywhere else. So seriously, I had to argue over a $2.xx soda that probably cost $0.13 wholesale? After a back and forth, she finally gave it to me. I have a hard time forgiving a restaurant something like that. Maybe she was having a bad day. But I probably won't be back.

My recommendation is to get the carne asada taco with the non-spicy green sauce with cheese on top. \n\nI can't speak for the carnitas, chicken or sesos but carne asada is to die for. \n\nTo make things even better you can get two tacos and and horchata for $5. And...there is easy parking at Best Buy. So there you go: get your gadget fix at Best Buy and get tasty and cheap tacos. \n\nSeriously - I challenge you to take me somewhere with better tacos. $5 on El Tonayense any day of the week.", "author": "Carlos A."}

All of that tender cheek, and tasty fat/muscle ends up just falling off of the head! It usually is super flavorful.\n\nNow the ambiguity with me lies with what is included in cabeza (depending on you you ask, it's got the eyeballs, tongue, ear, nose, etc - but not sure about the brain).\n\nNow, at Super Taqueria, I have seen \"cabeza\" advertised as cheek meat, and I believe that this is all it is, since all I taste is that tender meat - no brains, eyeballs, etc. It's got the meaty texture, but nothing squishy.\n\nOn the internet, they say that in Mexico, you usually specify the part of the head that you want.  There was also one source that said it also included the brain; none of the other sources specifically said that this was included.\n\nAt this truck, they advertise it as \"head/cheek\". The guy in front of us overheard me, and freaked out! He said that \"he ain't never touching that stuff that \"includes brains, eyeballs, and stuff...\" \n\nPersonally, I wasn't too sure that they usually include brain in cabeza since it's considered a whole other delicacy  altogether, and when my dad was meat-cutting in Watsonville, it was always sold separately. Not 100%, though.\n\nNonetheless, I ordered a pair (of tacos!). I can't remember the exact price, but they were less than two bucks each.\n\nThe result - soft homemade tortillas came with really good helpings of really aromatic and smooth cabeza topped with marinated carrots and grilled jalapenos. Everyhing was soooooo good, and the meat juice/sauce/broth was just ridicuously dripping out of them! \n\nOK, that age-old question that I posed up above...did I think that the cabeza came with brains and eyeballs this time 'round? \n\nMy answer is that it definitely more than just the cheek meat...there was something different about the flavor (in a good way) that tasted like there was perhaps the collagen or tendon in it as well. Brains? maybe a little, but one can never be too certain. \n\nLet's put it this way - it was a tad little bit more squishy than I've had at other places.\n\nI'd surely order them again from this truck if I had the chance!", "author": "Jimmy L."}

Do you want that?  I didn't think so.  Do not eat here.  I repeat DO NOT EAT HERE!!! I hope some of the other trucks still abide by the old recipe but this truck no longer does.  Instead they serve an inedible, cheaply made, impostor version of the real ET.  So sad.\n\nI have lived about a half mile from the ET truck in frnt of Best Buy for the last ten years and have gone here religiously throughout that time but my last visit was in October 2013, so a few months had gone by and I was missing the incredible flavors that ET used to offer.  The burritos were something of an anomaly in every way.  \n\n- First of all they were extremely affordable and for those of you who have lived in SF over the last 15 years, you've watched the gentrification SF quickly hike up prices even on the cheapest of foods i.e. burritos, so this place was 6 bucks for a burrito, now it's 7 and not worth it at all.\n\n- Most notable was their signature light green colored, cilantro rice. This no longer exists.  This is such a shame, I am really at a loss for words.  It made their food stand out and stand alone pretty much.  It was novel.  It was amazing and food doesn't typically excite me.  It was certainly exciting. Now it is run of the mill spanish rice but greasy and cheap.\n\n- The beans and the meat, if you went that way, were freshly made, not greasy, and hot.  The beans and meat today were cold.  The meat was old and lets just assume the beans were too because why would you have fresh beans and old shitty meat?  The meat was greasier than the worst taqueria one could possibly imagine.  I want to die right now from how greasy my tongue still feels a good half hour after just three bites. Just three and really it was two and a half. \n\nI could go on about how rude the service was an how inattentive the douche bag working the window was when I had too repeat my order three times (and once more after he had taken money since clearly that is all that is on these peoples minds) but by now you have heard straight truth from a very honest and normally noncritical local who once loved ET and have opted for El Farrolitos or just elsewhere, anywhere.

Relatively inexpensive for the neighborhood, you can try a wide variety for under $10.\n\nCarne Asada: Well marinated and flavorful.  Appropriate crisp factor given that is grilled.\n\nCarnitas: Could stand to be crispier.  Modest flavoring, a tad bland so the fattiness taste dominated.\n\nAl Pastor: On par.  Good texture like the carne asada, but with a lot more spices!\n\nPollo: Shockingly one of my favorites despite chicken tending to be more boring.  Whatever they are stewing this in sure is working!\n\nPollo Asado: My only yuck!  The chicken was soft and rubbery with no signs of charring.  The marinade was weak or non-existent.  Dark meat is just not so tasty on its own.", "author": "Adam B."}

There were already about 15 people waiting for their orders.  Hmmm... how was this going to work? Well, there was lots of confusion.  The guy in the truck just barks out the item that's ready at any given moment.

Their signature smoky, spicy red salsa makes the difference.  And their soft tacos have just the essentials: corn tortillas, meat, chopped onions, cilantro and a wedge of lime.  The menu is simple (tacos, burritos, tortas, chips) but there are plenty of meat options and you can get veggie tacos too.  They have drinks too (soda, water, horchata).\n\nI had three tacos ($1.75 each).  The two soft corn tortillas per taco make these easy to fold and eat.  \n\n* Neck - I thought this would be stringy (and it was).  It's like pulled pork.   Flavorful, seasoned well but fattier than I expected.    \n* Grilled chicken - Chunks have great grilled flavor and they're not too large and not too small.  Delicious.  \n* Head and cheek - My least favorite because the head and cheek meat was bland - reminded me of intestines but it comes in soft chunks.  I think any taco would taste great with their salsa, onions, cilantro and lime juice though.\n\nYou can get brains, tripe, tongue, al pastor, and carnitas too.  I like trying unusual cuts and my favorite (out of head & cheek, neck, tripe, brains & tongue) is lengua (tongue), followed by the neck.  I haven't tried brains and tongue here though.  Next time I'll get those tacos with extra cilantro.  Yum.  \n\nI've also overcome my fear of the humble taco truck, so thank you El Tonayense.", "author": "Lolia S."}

Nine dollars for a no-meat burrito is already more than just about any restaurant in SF charges (much less a TRUCK).  But what kind of restaurant charges the exact same price for a burrito with just rice, beans, cheese and guacamole, as they do for one that *also* has chopped steak, salsa, etc.?  I doubt very much that there's a single restaurant anywhere that does that.  But El Tonayense apparently thinks it's special enough to rip-off its vegetarian customers.  \n\nI've had probably 35-40 burritos from El Tonayense over the past 9 years and I have repeatedly (and politely) raised the question of why they're charging the same for a burrito *without* meat as for one *with* meat, and the answers I've gotten have been pretty much \"the owner sets the prices\" (and of course, the owner isn't in the truck to be questioned).  Last night was the last straw.  \n\nIf you went to a taqueria, ordered a steak burrito and requested double the amount of steak, do you think that the extra would be free?  Of course not!  Steak is by far the most expensive ingredient in such a burrito, and they'd charge probably 30-40% extra to double it.  But going in the opposite direction -- having zero meat -- they charge the same?  Fuck that!\n\nFurthermore, El Tonayense doesn't have the overhead of a storefront taqueria.  It's just a truck, with two employees and no amenities like seating, bathrooms, etc., and no extras like chips.  My go-to taqueria -- El Burrito Express in Lower Pacific Heights -- has to pay expensive rent, has a large dining room, a crew of 3-6 employees at any one time, as well as much higher utility costs, insurance, and even a beer and wine license!  And frankly, their meatless burritos are better than El Tonayense -- and they give free chips.  And yet El Burrito Express charges $6.50 for their meatless burrito, and is still making a good enough profit to have just completely remodeled their restaurant, and to have been in business there for more than 20 years!  \n\nThe old saying goes \"Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.\"  Well, El Tonayense fooled me for 9 years with their price-gouging, but they fooled me for the last time.", "author": "Curran H."}

Once you're more of a veteran, then maybe you can focus and and get the burrito, with your favorite meat.\n\nThe tacos portion are kinda small though. I usually order them with single tortilla skin and I can chow down 1 taco in just 2 bites. I think I'd need 10 tacos to feed me completely!

One of the great things about it (besides the food) is how it brings local SF flavor to something as universally common as a Best Buy. I love the juxtaposition.\n\nAnyways, the food is why you go here. Their al pastor tacos, at $1.50 each, are an amazing steal and seriously are some of the best mexican food in northern california. It's all fresh, it's all made-to-order, and it's unbelievably clean. This truck receives 100% on the annual health inspection every single year...that's far more sanitary than the majority of fancy expensive places in this town. \n\nThe al pastor is the show-stealer for me, but they also do chicken, carne asada, and the more exotix lengua (tongue) and cabeza (head).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-09-30", "description": "I'm from Modesto. Let's just get that right out of the way. Anyone who knows anything about Modesto knows a couple basic things about it...\n\n1) It gets hotter than shit (triple digit heat waves are guaranteed every summer).\n\n2) It's ghetto (consistantly ranks in the top three cities for auto theft in California, often topping out Oakland).\n\n3) There's a STRONG latin influence (being that the city limits are bordered by farm land theres a ton of migrant workers in addition to the already strong latin culture in the city of Mo).\n\n\nBased off our third key Modesto trait one can assume that I love authentic mexican food (namely street tacos) more than any other food IF (and that's a huge if) they're done right. \n\nMost of the time I hate tacos from taquerias. Simply put they complicate it to much (no pun intended). The point of an authentic taco is to capture the flavor of the meat, seasoning and a few other elements meant to compliment but not take away from that flavor. There's no need for lettuce, cheese, sour cream and all this other garbage on a taco. It just dilutes the flavor of the good stuff in my opinion.\n\nA properly made street taco will consist of...\n\n-Your choice of grilled meat. Asada, Pollo or Puerco (no chile colorado or any of that shit, save that for traditional style platas)  seasoned and grilled to perfection (this is the key to a great street taco).\n\n-A small amount of onions, cilantro or both\n\n-A squeeze of lime\n\n-SOMETIMES a small dab of guacamole or pico de gallo (be sure to not overdo it as you'll mask the flavor of the meat and, again, the meat is what the taco is all about!)\n\nWhen these key elements come together just right it's a thing of beauty. \n\nBut as I stated above many places pile on as much as they can, overcharge you for a shitty \"super\" taco and then end up laughing at your gringo style taco. Did you ever notice how those small tortillas end up getting all overloaded, soggy and falling apart before you can get halfway through a \"super\" taco? It's because they weren't meant to handle all of that crap!!\n\nWith that being said I've found that the most authentic street tacos I've found are from the taco trucks when it comes to eating stateside. They had em all over the place in Modesto. I understand that there's quite a few in Oakland, not so many here in the city. \n\nSo for providing what's pretty much as close as I've tasted to an authentic street taco as you'll get here in the city (the trucks often pan fry the meat as opposed to grilling it, and yes I know I'm a picky bastard when it comes to this) I give El Tonayense a five star review. To anyone who ever finds themselves in Mexico I recommend finding a street-side grill cart and trying authentic street tacos for yourself. Sorry for the serious rambling that I did in this review but as you can probably tell, I loves me a good taco (as sexually inferencing as that sounds).", "author": "Tommy P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-11-23", "description": "Come with me for a journey down the grizzly end of the meat menu.  I've often viewed the menu of a taco truck with suspicion.  I consider myself a deep end diner in some ways but usually confine my offal excursions to the safe haven of a two Michelin star restaurant.  However one drunken night out in Pomona my friends decided to play a trick on the poor little white boy and bought me some tripitas tacos from a truck outside the bar we had been frequenting.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  Sadly I was too drunk to remember the name of the truck or i'd be yelping that.  My friends were surprised at my reaction especially when they revealed i'd been eating tripe.  But I thank them for the experience and giving me the balls to venture down the menu.\n\nSober and in complete control I went to my favourite truck outside Best Buy and was happy to see they really did offer nose to tail eating.  So I made it my mission to try each one.  \n\nI've made a vain attempt at ranking each meat but truth be told with one exception I'd eat them all again.\n\nTripitas (Tripe)\n\nThe pinnacle of tacodom.  Tripitas or tripe is the intestine of a pig or cow (I think these are the beef variety but unsure) which I presume from the consistency is stewed and then fried to give it a lovely soft interior with a crunch that is reminiscent of pork crackling (or ciccarones if you've never had crackling).  The taste is quite neutral with a little porkiness but it is the consistency that makes these five star tacos.  I even once got a freebie from the nice people at ETbecause they were impressed that I was venturing outside of my culinary comfort zone.\n\nCabeza (Head & Cheek).  \n\nNow I'm a big fan of pigs head, if you go to Marseille you'll find them in every butcher shop window and at El Tonayense the delicious, tender pieces are chopped up so you wouldn't recognise them as their constituent parts.  Imagine if you will a very robust flavoured Carnitas, minus the crunch and you are pretty much there.  I presume they are simmered for a long time to break down the meat and would be my preference now over Al Pastor any day of the week. \n\nLengua (Tongue)\n\nBy far the most distinctive flavour of the menu.  Tongue has a rich, almost livery taste to it and again it is well cooked and chopped so the meat is tender.  I like the robust flavour and still pick one up from time to time.\n\nBuche (Neck)\n\nPig's neck?  I have found conflicting information as to whether this is neck or stomach from the pig but tasting them seems to point to neck.  I would say the taste is pretty ordinary and the consistency that of Carne Asada.  That said it is a tasty treat and I would have no trouble eating them but find little to recommend them over some of the other offally good offerings.\n\nSesos (Brains)\n\nThe holy grail of deep end dining?  I really had to build myself up to eating brains as my first experience of this in a restaurant in Dubai was not pleasant.  I have to say my second experience was also unpleasant, the flavour is strong and overpowering, even hot sauce couldn't keep it from taking over every other taste on the tortilla and the consistency was very spongy, almost mushy.  I did however manage to eat the whole thing but I do consider this to be an acquired taste and not one I really want to try and acquire myself.\n\nIf you aren't as brave as me (or stupid perhaps) then ET does offer tasty morsels at the easier end of the menu.  I love their Al Pastor, it really tasted like it was barcecued but please I implore you, put your reservations aside and try a Tripitas Taco, you will never look back!", "author": "Tony S."}

The sauce propelled the taco to the next level and made for a uniqueness about this taco truck. Not bad for a mobile eatery, but I'm still remaining optimistic in finding a better truck to satisfy my hunger.", "author": "Christina N."}

I heard about \"a taco truck off the freeway\" being featured on the Food Network so asked friends about it and sure enough, one suggested that it might be Tonayense.  I went not knowing if this was \"the\" taco truck off the freeway, saw the plaques and awards that it had won, and was amazed at the taste sensation, mmmmmm!!\n\nTo be fair, I only eat chicken, so can only comment on those as I've eaten both the \"pollo\" and \"pollo asado\", two different methods of cooking.  The pollo is slow cooked in a red sauce and is super moist, and seasoned beautifully.  The pollo asado is just that, grilled meat, very well flavored, cooked, and good quality white meat chicken.  I've taken friends here and they have liked the carne asada and another of the beef styles, they swear by them, so it sounds like it's all good.\n\nAfter many visits of just the tacos, because why fix it if it isn't broken, I decided to venture out with a burrito.  Good tortilla, as many others fail in this respect, but overall I would give it an ok, not to be ordered again, I'll stick with the tacos and am going to try the torta one of these days.  **update**  A good friend of mine who is all about Mexican food in SF, ventured into the burrito ordering and loved his carne asada burrito.  We are both trying to get the guts to order the quesadilla, the tacos are too good to leave!\n\nThe horchata is really good too, one of the best in the Bay.  \n\nI love El Tonayense truck, I had friends from out of town visit so went into the Mission for the actual store location since getting to the taco truck would have been a long adventure in and of itself, and with two small kids visiting, this wasn't going to happen.  So I would rate the actual Tonayense restaurant really good, but the truck on Harrison and 13th beyond exceptional, like fantastic!!", "author": "Miss C."}

So what was wrong? EVERYTHING. I always order a super veggie burrito wherever I go... to start with, for $6, it was pretty small. The tortilla was dried out.. maybe it was stale? The rice was under cooked, the beans were undercooked and had zero seasoning of any kind. Ever heard of SALT, guys? There was maybe a teaspoon of cheese about 1/3 of the way in, a barely noticeable smidge of sour cream, no guac or avocado in sight, a few pathetic pink bits of tomato and the salsa? They asked me if I wanted it spicy... I said yes. I don't know what mild salsa is to them, but if the spicy tastes like baby food, I wouldn't know what to expect with mild. I've never had a burrito so bland. Typically, when I gat a subpar burrito, it's still edible. With this one, it was just so so SO bad that I just didn't see the point of wasting the calories on it. I've NEVER taken a burrito back because of quality issues, but I did with this one... I got my money back. If my husband's burrito hadn't been totally lackluster as well, I might have let them make me another, but his was pretty much the same, except he got meat on his and the seasoning on the meat made it palatable... but he should have asked for the difference back for not getting the \"super\" ingredient upgrade. And on top of it all, we both had a stomach ache an hour later. \n\nI've been eating burritos about town for years and yes, SF has great burritos.... it's just a matter of finding who's making 'em good right now. If there's anything that's consistent about SF burritos, it's their inconsistency and the propensity for the size and quality of a burrito to plummet every time the truck or restaurant raises prices.  All that said, maybe I'll try these guys again sometime in the distant future. Chances are, I'll get a good one... or another bomb.

Whether in taco, burrito or torta form, you can't go wrong.  There is a real depth of flavor to the spices used, like many dried, roasted chilies were blended to create the sauce.  It has sort of a chorizo spice edge to it.  On one occasion, it seemed a little over the top, like cardamom was in the mix, and it tasted like an Indian or Pakistani curry.  On every other visit the Pastor makes my eyes roll back into my head, like some sort of Al Pasteroin or something.

Everything I have tried there so far is very flavorful and fresh. The sauce they put in their burritos is perfect. I like to get both the mild and spicy sauces in my burrito, but both are great on their own. Their Pastor is one of my favorites, some of the best pastor I've ever had. It's so good it's not even worth describing. Just go there, you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Jack S."}

There is something about their burritos that is just so perfect.  I mean, its not as good as say 2009's Burrito of the Year winner Papalote (according to SFGate) but for a Burrito truck, its about as good as its got to get!  The burritos were chock full of meat, beans, and some kind of delicious sauce that we probably don't want to ask too many questions about but sure do enjoy chomping down upon.  All I have to say is that whenever I drive by this place I have to fight a bit of an urge to stop by - I'll make some excuse about checking out the sales on bigscreen TVs at Best Buy but deep down I know why I'm REALLY stopping :)  I've probably just had the carne asade but I'm sure everything else is delicious as well.

This is clearly our greatest disparity yet. Some Yelpers love it too, so that caught my eye. I ordered a regular grilled chicken burrito. No black beans, no problemo, pintos work. Given the vast assortment of fillings, including some this gringo is not at all anxious to try, I understand that they can't have every option. I asked for salsa picante and extra cilantro, no comment from the guy. This was by far the driest burrito _ever_! No salsa, no cilantro, no picante nuthin'. The chicken was dry (but quite plentiful), the pinto beans were dry, and the rice - is that rice? It looks like it's broken rice particles from the bottom of the silo - was dry and had no obvious flavoring, like a Spanish rice or whatever it is every other burrito place I've tried offers. If there was cheese -- and I'm not sure the regular burrito comes with queso -- it was not discernible. I now know to prefer a burrito place where I can see what they've got and how my order is prepared before it's too late. I didn't have that choice at El Tonayense.  What you get is what they want you to get.\n\nI'll give 'em one more shot, this time with a deluxe burrito, and see what happens. I'll update my rating then.

It was freshly warmed soft tortillas, meat, onions, a few jalapenos, and a couple of radishes thrown in for good measure. I didn't know if I should walk back to the car or where to place my bag from Best Buy while I ate or whether to sit on the curb or standing at the truck as I was the only one there. I felt like such an amateur. So, I  dropped my stuff and copped a squat. First bite... Bang!! Boom!! Pow!! Holy Guacamole Batman!!! What have I been missing out on?? I found the simplicity of the taco its best feature.Nothing else needed. Now, I just have to figure out if having discovered such an easily accessible and cheap (4.50 for the whole order) taco is a good thing.", "author": "Bucky K."}

We had 60 people at the party and everyone enjoyed their food. A few people went back for seconds, thirds and fourths. The service was just as perfect as the carne asada and carnitas. If you are looking to rent a taco truck for a party...look no further.", "author": "Juana M."}

I eat them in my car. Ever since they were reviewed on Check Please it seems they're even more popular. Thankfully, the quality has remained thus far. Yum!", "author": "meower g."}

Ask for the cheese quesadilla -- with green salsa in it -- HEAVEN! They grill it so it's just a little crunchy and perfectly melted inside. Seriously, it's the best cheesy goodness in SF, and yes, I am familiar with the Mission -- this Taco truck has em beat.", "author": "LAH H."}

Stumbled upon this gem after buying Ethernet cables for my apartment last summer.  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a quick bite instead of going to a typical drive thru.  I wonder why I don't swing by here more often for some greasy goodness!", "author": "Ames C."}

I normally dont come out to this area or the mission very often (prolly 2x a year max--parking sucks and the area is sketchy)...but thank god for this truck parked at the best buy! I can park in the best buy lot, grab a taco or 3 and eat 'em up on the street. \nI had the tongue & the carne asada (mild salsa)...i liked the carne asada more than the tongue b/c it had a lot of flavor to it (and prolly the extra grease) than the tongue. However, the tongue is really tender as well. I took a bite of my bf's cheeks & head taco (hehe, dirty mind....) and that was very tasty as well...i would order the brains taco (oh come on, havent you had cow brains before??? cures migraines all the way thru---it's true, my gramma used to make cow brains herbal chinese soup..never had headaches for years!!!) but anyways, i dont really trust this place for cow brains--its a truck for god's sake...the brains must be fresh, clean, and properly handled!\n\nso anyways., minus 1 star b/c i think $1.75/taco is a little steep...if it was $1.25/taco then thats a reasonable--b/c after all, that stuff to make a taco doesnt even add up to a $1.00?!\n\nbut b/c i love taco trucks so much, i'd still come back & i want to try their other items (i.e. burrito/tortas)", "author": "Yolanda L."}

Nothing makes me happier than spending a Friday at home, enjoying an early fall day, and chowin on a fat burrito full of delicious meat, copious sauce, and other tasty goodies. Grab some extra napkins, make sure you're hungry, and prepare yourself for a post-indulgence nap. I promise - it'll be a good afternoon.", "author": "Matt B."}
