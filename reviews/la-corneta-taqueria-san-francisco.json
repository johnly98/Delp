On a recent afternoon they even had a 4 member band playing which is a classy touch.\n\nThe owner was present and he has a very politician-ish vibe and I've read that he's done a lot of community work which is awesome.  This is their third location I believe along with Diamond Heights and Burlingame.  The attention to detail at this venue is very impressive I think it appeals to both tourists and those looking for an authentic venue. The owner himself is from Jalos (Mexican state of Jalisco) and based on the success of his restaurants seems to have this Taqueria thing down pat. \n\nYou walk in the impressive facility and put your order in.\nI noted this in a review for a Filpino spot that I recently reviewed, having a long counter in establishments like this is crucial. Some have them others do not. If you have that long counter it feels like you are steadily creeping up the line even though the time duration is the same.  This place has that \"ideal\" layout and once you reach the end the cashier has your order and you're on your way. \n\nI had two tacos :\nAl Pastor \nCochinita Pibil\n\nThe tacos were flavorful and solid. Another added plus is that this venue accepts credit/debit card which not all Taquerias do.\n\nThe world needs a San Francisco Taco ranking...so I'm here to provide my humble list/rankings. \n\nRanking explained:  #1 (listed at the top) is my favorite/ #?

Other Mexican places are like a drunken guilty pleasure, very heavy on the grease and lard factor, leaving you with a irksome tummy or burrito hangover. It's not the case with La Corneta - so I was curious to check out the equally conveniently located next to a BART (24th St), though this one has more competition nearby. \n\nI got my usual Pollo asado dinner plate, hold the rice, with refried beans. The chicken was tender, not tough or dry, and not too greasy. Refried beans were what you'd expect, flavorful, and creamy texture. While the food itself not heavy and oil laden, with the grill being in front of you as you wait in line, the smell of cooking oils lingered on my clothes afterwards.

The location is super convenient, just half a block away from the 24th St. BART station (between 23rd and 24th on Mission St.), the restaurant is decently sized - maybe the same size as Pancho Villa and maybe 30-40% bigger than La Taq.\n\nThe portions here are generous in size - I got the Super Baby Burrito (sounds like an oxymoron!), but it's a smaller sized burrito that comes with meat, rice, beans, cheese, salsa, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, tomato and salsa for $7. You can get just the Baby Burrito for $5.50, but that just comes with the meat, rice, beans, cheese, and salsa, so I think it's worth the extra $1.50 for the guacamole and other things. Seeing as that a burrito at Chipotle costs just as much as this Super Baby Burrito (if not more) and it's not as authentic and flavorful, this is a much better option! The Super Baby Burrito was filling but not to the point where I thought I would explode after eating.\n\nThe fillings: you can pick between refried or black beans, you can make your burrito spicy or mild. The rice is flavorful and has peas and some other veggies in there, so it's not just plain white rice with cilantro. The chicken I got was well seasoned and a little grilled, so it was better than the chicken at La Taq that seems to just be boiled and flavorless.\n\nIf you dine in, they have 2 kinds of salsa on the table that you can squeeze on your burrito. No salsa bar like Pancho Villa. They will give you some chips too, but they were a little bit too greasy for my taste.\n\nIf burritos aren't your thing, you can also get tacos, quesadillas, nachos, or other combinations/special plates. You should be able to find something that you like here - there are a ton of options. They take credit card which is always nice (unlike La Taq that is only cash), and the space is fairly large and spacious so you won't feel like you're eating on top of someone else.\n\nI'll definitely come back here again next time I'm in the mood for a burrito or authentic Mexican food.

This was my first time and I was very happy with my experience. I got a super burrito with carne asada (no sour cream), a small cream-filled churro, and a Mexican Coke. The burrito was amazing!! It was an awesome replacement for El Farolito and I almost ate it all in one sitting. I'm very picky about burritos and it's hard to please me in this area. Most of the time, burritos can be too dry or have too much of a filler in it. Their burrito had the perfect amount of ingredients and everything tasted fresh and was seasoned well.\n\nThe only disappointment was the churro. It was too crunchy for my liking and didn't seem very fresh. It almost seemed stale to me? Maybe I'm just spoiled by the Churros Mexicanos cart in Fruitvale... But El Corneta's churro relleno did not meet my expectations.\n\nI was also very happy with the service here. The two young ladies who helped me were very attentive even though they seemed swamped with orders. The lady who ordered before me was rude to them and almost ran out with MY burrito because she wouldn't listen to what they were saying. Some of y'all customers need to chill and be more respectful to workers. Thankfully, they were able to stop her from running away with my burrito. \n\nI have no idea why some people are saying this taqueria is cash only. They accept cards too! Also, this place is very spacious and there's A/C. It's the perfect place to get lunch in the summer if you're in the area.", "author": "Karen R."}

Looking and craving some Mexican food, we came to La Corneta.  The line was long, but not as excessive as the line I saw out the door earlier at El Farolito.  The colors are bright here, the restaurant is very clean, and the food looked and smells good.  While waiting, I saw the meats on the grill which permeated onto my hair and clothes.  \n\nThey take you order ahead of time in line and then by the time we reached the cashier to pay everything was all ready.  I ordered a chicken baby burrito and a small strawberry agua fresca for myself and a especial carne asada burrito to go for hubby.  All this with free chips (for my dine in order and the to go) for under $17.  I'm so happy I got the baby burrito because I was getting so full.  The rice was orange rice with some peas and carrots in it, and had a light flavor.  The grilled chicken was moist and diced up.  A lot of times I try to refrain from chicken in my Mexican food due to fear of being dry, but this wasn't the case here.  I used some of the verde salsa in their squirt bottle.  The agua fresca was refreshing and not overly sweet or watery.  Chips were standard, didn't get diced salsa in it.    I don't get beans but I appreciate that you can choose which beans you'd like, what type of salsa, and what type of tortilla for your order as well.  My friend says she likes La Corneta because the meat isn't greasy and she doesn't feel like the food is so heavy here like she feels at El Farolito.  \n\nThere's a La Corneta by me in Burlingame, I'm hoping this chain is very consistent as I was impressed by my dinner here last week and would like to find a great Mexican restaurant in the Peninsula.  I always have fond memories of going to La Taqueria for lengua tacos with my uncle as a kid, hubs and I used to go to Taqueria Los Coyotes for California burritos, now I know another delicious taqueria in the Mission.

In the area to visit a cousin, we wanted a taqueria we could all meet up at where we could easily grab a seat - this place was a great bet; we were able to waltz in, hold a table for six, wait 15 minutes for the rest of our party to show up, and then get table service from an incredibly friendly hostess who hooked it up fat with several baskets of chips, salsa, and a couple guac cups. Way to get it started!\n\nThe margaritas were super-drinkable if not insanely strong, and the chips and salsa are great (not spicy at all, but a very fresh pico de gallo). \n\nMy bf and I shared the chicken enchilada plate ($8.70) and the steak & prawn super quesadilla ($11). The enchiladas are usually my go-to, but the quesadilla stole the show, big time.

That soccer game was pretty entertaining with Mexico scoring one point and winning the game, having David Beckham make an appearance in his soccer uniform and the camera caught the other team attempting to help this one guy from the Mexico team out because he basically fouled him pretty harshly and the guy slapped his hands away - gesturing him to lay off, I don't need your help! \n\nAs for the meal, they provide pico de gallo salsa and chips with every order! I got their carne asada and chorizo tacos!  They surely pack the tacos with a whole lot of meat!  I love their chipotle salsa that they serve with the tacos.  That lightly roasted salsa compliments the tacos well and by adding the green salsa that they provide on the side table, it makes the whole meal just so saucy and gradually spicy!\n\nIf you're dining in, there are busboys that clean up after you.  Once you're done with the meal, you don't have to seek out where the trash bin is at to put your tray away!\n\nJust $3 for each taco, having all those snazzy salsa flavors, great servers and amazing ambiance, this Taqueria is amazing!", "author": "Tiffany D."}

Even though it is on the small side, there is still a seating area to enjoy your food if you choose to do so.\n\nTheir menu here is HUGE and I mean HUGE! Which is great for people who like options or annoying for people who get overwhelmed with some many options. The staff here didn't seem very organized while taking ordered and seemed rushed and forgetful. We both ordered some burritos, they are rather large and at decent prices. Again, heard good things about this place and expected to taste one good burrito. \n\nThe burrito was good but it wasn't \"like omg this place is the best ever\", which to be honest, I was looking forward to. Overall the burrito was good and I would come here again if I am in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again.

La Corneta is authentically old world fare--not trying to be hip (and then missing the mark).  La Corneta is my 'Go To' when I want great taste at reasonable prices. (There is even a GIANT hand painted mural of the Madonna in this big place of 3 rooms. Now if that isn't old school what is). \n\nI went there once and couldn't get it out of my mind, so I returned again. When I told the manager how much I appreciated his food, he got a wide grin, IMMEDIATELY left his cash register and personally escorted me to the table, bringing whatever I needed. Lastly, end the meal with a perfectly made churro treat (costing $1 dollar) to munch on the way home and compadres--you will have scratched that itch for a perfect Hispanic lunch in the Mission.  \n\nPS - Another reviewer mentioned a noisy Mariacchi Band on an evening. I have NOT been for dinner, but simply check ahead and don't go if they are having a band that night. What can I say, La Corneta is the real deal.

It's like a South-of-the-Border version of the Hungry Heifer because the combination plates here could easily feed a small army of migrant workers. Surprisingly, I've actually never been here before since El Farolito and Taqueria Cancun are so close by and satisfy my discriminating taste buds. OK, they're not that discriminating since sometimes I just like quantity. Norm! \n\nIt's a cavernous, brightly lit place just down the block from the 24th Street BART station. You just order upfront in front between the grill and the prep area. The overhead menu is positioned a little too far to the left to browse easily. It also doesn't help that the print is minuscule enough to make the experience akin to an appointment with an optometrist. Still, Jamie W. and I both saw the prawns and mushrooms sizzling on the grill and wanted what he was making. I went all Norm and went with the $12.55 Combination Plate of Carne Asada, Pollo and Prawns with Mushrooms. Oh yes, I did. \n\nIt was more a flattened slice of pork, a large marinaded chicken thigh, and a lotta jumbo prawns, mushrooms, garlic, and green onions, all of it hot off the grill. On the other side of the plate was a big pile of warm black beans. Flanking all of this was rice, shredded lettuce a ladleful of guacamole and what looked to be a slice of the world's largest tomatoes (see photo). You also get a half-dozen tortillas wrapped in aluminum foil, as well as a basket of chips with fresh salsa, mild or hot (see photo). I get exhausted thinking about it, but it was truck-driver good, especially the tender chicken and the succulent prawns. \n\nFor a dollar less, Jamie just had the $9.95 Garlic Prawns with Mushrooms (see photo). Note that we both got a basket of chips! Yes, it is a glutton's paradise in here, which may explain why the restroom is rather on the atrocious side. Watch for puddles. There's also this strangely hermetically sealed room with glass walls that we haven't quite figured out. Perhaps when I remember to bring my Playtex gloves, I should try to go in there myself.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-12-31", "description": "I've been on a quest to find a taqueria in the Mission that beats El Farolito. La Corneta has always piqued my interest with its clean and spacious ambiance decorated with red tiled floors and a colorful blend of red, orange, yellow, and other vibrant colors to bring a festive vibe. It's a bit smoky at the entrance where they broil and grill their meat to bring you an instantaneous aromatic introduction. This is also where you get to glance at the huge wall menu with a long food counter with all sorts of eye-popping meat, rice, beans and all the Mexican goodies you can imagine.\n\nI've been to here twice, once for dinner on a weeknight another on a festive weekend that had a celebratory mariachi band where the place was bursting with people from all walks of life. On my first visit my super vegetarian burrito ($5.25) came with complimentary chips, black beans, rice, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato and salsa. I wasn't too impressed with their burrito as it was dry on the spots that were without guacamole. I thought it had too much fresh lettuce and the salsa was bland. It wasn't the most flavorful and the experience was over-dependent on the red and green salsa located at each table.\n\nMy second visit I ordered a chicken tamal and pork tamal with rice, black beans, lettuce, guacamole, and salsa ($7.75). The chicken tamal was dry and bland but the pork tamal was tasty with tender fat trimmings to keep me engaged the whole time. I thought the rice and beans were decent but the complimentary chips could be better warmed and salted. Salsa again could and should include chopped jalapeno to induce a spicy kick instead of letting it fell flat. My order of large melon aqua fresca ($2.50) was refreshing and a nice finisher. I did not receive my stack of tortillas even though it was clearly stated on the menu. \n\nOverall, I thought their prices were higher than others in the Mission while in exchange the food had very good portions but the flavor was not exciting enough to match its beautiful decor. I saw many Mexican customers ordering their carne asada so that might be a dish to look into for those interested. This place is spacious and has the room to support large groups and families. 3 stars for the overall experience.", "author": "Daniel L."}

Their guacamole is fresh and not too loaded with onions (a deciding factor for me as I hate onions).  \n\nI withheld a star for a few reasons.  \n\n1. The giant menu on the wall behind the food station is very unclear, at least about the nachos.  There is regular which is vegetarian- chips, beans, cheese and salsa.  You can add meat to the regular.   Then there's super nachos which have everything and the kitchen sink on them.  Then, there's the mysterious \"Vegetarian\" nachos.  That's all it says.  I really only want two additional things than what is on the regular BUT I definitely don't want all that's on the super.  So I never know exactly how to order.\n\n2. The staff can be a bit surly.  Well, mainly these two ladies that are always there the other people seem fine.  The more surly one reminds me of Carla from Cheers but Mexican.  She's smart as a whip and always gets the order right albeit with a stern expression.\n\n3. I cannot stand those mariachis that play with amplified instruments.

The young woman who made our burritos overfilled them, to the point where she couldn't wrap them like burritos before folding them in foil.  She just pinched the sides together like tacos and wrapped them in foil. It looked like she had never made a burrito before and I had to remake them when we got home so that we could actually eat them like burritos instead of rice plates.\n\nThe good:  the ingredients were great!  The rice was cooked well, the beans seasoned, the salsa (we got the hot stuff) inside the burrito was delicious and spicy.

I was craving Mexican, so we made a special trip over here on a Saturday, had to park 5 blocks away, walk by the disgusting urine infested Bart depot (made me gag before I even got there). We walked in and there was a line at the counter, but we must've looked the type who were going to sit down, so the waitress came up to us and asked (in Spanish) if we were going to \"eat here\" and she told us to sit down and she brought us a basked of chips and menus. The salsa with the chips was pico de gallo. There were also two bottle of salsa on the table. NONE of these salsas had any flavor. No lie. They lacked salt. I have a heart condition, so I'm not a big salt eater, so that should tell you something. I ended up ordering the baby burrito with chicken and mole because of all the rave reviews. She brought another salsa (making it 4 total different salsas). Again, no flavor. I had asked for no rice in the burrito (doesn't belong there!). But, they didn't put any cheese in it like the menu described. My husband got the super baby burrito with shrimp and his didn't have any cheese either. I don't usually eat burritos in Mexican restaurants, I think of them as Gringo food because I've traveled all over Mexico and actually lived part of the year in Jalisco, and they don't serve burritos unless it's in an American style restaurant. But, this food so lacked in flavor that I would be afraid to try the tacos. I also have to say although everyone speaks Spanish there, I don't think the operators of this Mexican restaurant are Mexican. They sound Central American and the food is more Central American style. If I want that, I would go down the street and have a pupusa or nacatamal. Central American food isn't typically as spicy as Mexican so I think my assumption is correct. I'm really surprised that it's so hard to find good Mexican in SF, but I'll keep trying.", "author": "Tess S."}

I like to try all the taquerias because I like variety although I am always tempted to go back to the usual spots.\n\nSo I went inside La Corneta and they had something El Farolito didn't have at the time (a decade ago) which was shrimp burittos.  I tried one and I got totally hooked.  For awhile I was always going to La Corneta and getting their delicious shrimp all the time.  Was it shrimp or was it prawns?  I can't recall, anyways, they were delicious.  \n\nI haven't been back there a long time because I don't work in the area anymore.  Plus El Farolito is always open after the bars close and La Corneta isn't.  Also I am super addicted to El Farolito's veggie tortas.  \n\nLa Corneta is one of the more expensive taquerias in the mission because the interior is fancier.  Friendly cashiers back in the day.  Food was just fine.  However La Corneta seems a bit out of place because it seems more like a taqueria you would find in the suburbs.  However I noticed that locals have embraced it so good for them.  You can never have enough taquerias.  I love Mexican food.\n\nMinus one star for price.  If you go to the Mission you want yummy Mexican food for cheap, isn't that what it's all about.  If you want something less expensive with a true Mission District feel to it go to San Jose Taqueria or La Taqueria.\n\nTo be honest I am afraid to park my car in the Mission these days.  I am worried someone is going to scratch it.  Too many times people have leaned on my car.  Plus it just doesn't feel safe for a Caucasion transsexual who is often by herself.  I don't wear a beanie and a big puffy gangster looking jacket anymore.  I have left the jacket and the Mission in my past.  Let somebody else risk their life for a taco, because I ain't the one.

Taquera La Altena was the one I used to go to, but with the Mission fire in the building above it I had to try another one.  I also like Taqueria Guadalajara on 24th and Shotwell (Their salsas are awesome).  In search of a new taqueria close to where I live, I found this place.  I think the burritos here are very good.  I really like the carne asada burrito with shrimp.  It's $9.30 but they put 6 huge shrimp in them.  It's really nice to watch them cook it in front of you as well.  The carne asada doesn't have big hunks of fat in it like I've seen at a lot of places.  They are also one of the few places that has a chile relleno burrito.  Like every other taqueria I've seen it's usually cold in a fridge and they microwave it on a plastic?! (I assume microwave safe, I hate putting anything plastic in the microwave) plate.  Their sliced jalapenos are AMAZING.  The lady behind the counter told me they make them there.  It tastes like they put oregano in the vinegar.  Their whole jalapenos are great as well.  My only problems with this place is the fact that you have to ask for salsa and jalapenos.  Depending on who is working I can get dirty looks and I feel like I am a beggar or trying to rip them off.  They are usually so busy you really have to be aggressive in asking.  I like how most taquerias have a self serve bar, but that can get disgusting if the clientele let the salsas fall into each other.  You would think that it is more sanitary that the workers get the salsa for you, but I've seen times where it is busy and the workers (and I believe owner) dips a plastic container into the salsa with his bare hands after operating the register.  Not very sanitary as I am a germ freak.  However, I do notice MOST of the time they are washing their hands after operating the register.  I haven't got sick yet, so far so good!  I advise you also to call ahead with your orders.  This place is popular and sometimes I would get behind a family that ordered 5-10 burritos and it really holds everyone up.

This is not a place where you enter the restaurant,  sit down and someone comes and takes your order.  Like many taquerias in the Mission, you wait in line and tell the server behind the counter what you want to order and watch as they put your meal together.  You then pay at the end of the counter and take your food to a table, sit down and eat (unless you've ordered it to go).\n\nI always dread the ordering process here.  The servers always seem to be cranky and impatient.  I always get the impression that they hate their jobs.

It also came w/ a little side salad, which added a nice touch. Next time I'm just going to stick with chicken!

Where to start?  The wait, horrific on most days and only because they have NO idea how to run a restaurant, they need to go to the Google and search  \"Henry Ford\". No he is not a burrito expert but he did pioneer the assembly line, something these folks must not know exists. Imagine if you went to a  restaurant and the waiter took your order, bussed your table and went back and cooked your it in addition to serving you, well that is how it is done here. I have been here when they have 10 employees behind the counter and can't serve 3 people in 10 minutes. If they did a traditional (logical and efficient) service they could serve a min of 5X the people in the same time conservatively. You regulars know what I mean, it's almost entertaining to watch them run around bumping into each other, at least if you have time to kill. To give you an idea of how bad it can be, I have called in an order when in line and then waled to pick up and got my food faster. Little tip there. \n\nNow the food. Like most profit-based cookie cutter Taquerias there is plenty of cost filler like rice and lettuce. A proper carne asada burrito does not have beans, rice and a bunch of greasy low grade chopped steak. At least La Taqueria in the Mission gets this and tries to do it right.   Nothing like pound of watery salsa to make the thing fall apart in your hands so you have a pile mush to eat with a fork. \n\nLet's move to tacos. Piles of beans inside, really? Why not add rice to be consistent and then you have an open faced SF burrito with a corn tortilla.  But wait! You can ask for no beans in your fish taco right!! Of course you can but be ready because that fish taco comes with Salmon not white fish. What a nice surprise as I really miss all those salmon fish tacos I have never had in Mexico. Was there a sale at Costco on Salmon. Where do you get a Salmon fish taco in Mexico?  Clearly a lazy cost cutting technique. \n\nThe worst part is how many people wait in line for absurd amounts of time for what they believe is decent Mexican. This is not even a good representation of California Mexican. Even sadder is that the owners (I believe)  are Mexican which is rare here as the Mission is mostly Hondurans, Salvadorans, etc and a reason we have this poor Mexican food. \n\nOh- The green \"SF standard\" salsa is pretty good though.", "author": "Mark D."}

Some of us don't really like being in the mission. Ok, Fair enough.\n\nWalked down the block to la corneta, the digs didn't seem as hole in the wall, down home, authentic, dirty tacos, but it'll have to do. Actually it was freaking well lit as heck and way cleaner (and gringo-ed out) than el farolito since it's a chain type restaurant, but yelp tells me this place got at least 4 stars, so we weren't in for an experience, but we wouldn't be eating crappy burritos and tacos. \n\nThis place is pretty much the same to me as poncho villa. Its good, but you kind of expect a place like this to at least be this good, so there was nothing that floored me, but at least it's safer, cleaner, and has TONS of seating. Since the venue was nicer, you could safely assume that you would be paying like a dollar more for a burrito here than el farolito down the block.\n\nI would like to eventually make my way over for a quick bite at el farolito tho. It did have a good sized line building around 8pm on a Sunday night. Where as there was pretty much no wait at la corneta. If you like to live semi-dangerously, please try el farolito out and tell me how good it is :)\n\n\nFOOD:\nBottled water is $0.92, you know what, it's such a simple pleasure, but you RARELY see bottled water for under a dollar at restaurants and convenience stores. \n\nI had the super taco.

I had the carne asada (grilled beef), so it came will a generous portion of meat, sour cream, avocado, lettuce, shredded cheese, salsa, pico de gallo (chopped up tomatoes and cilantro and lime ish salsa), beans, rice, slice of tomato and a wedge of a lime. It was pretty super to me. All this for $4.50! I was pretty filled up.\n\nGot a large churro (filled with creme or something), it wasn't warm, so I was disappointed, but I would not hesitate to try one again if it was fresh out of the deep fryer. The texture of the dough of the churro is WAY different from churros you get at Costco (best value churro in the entire bay area that I know of... although I do see those dudes carrying a cart of home made churros that they sell on the streets). The ridges on this churro kind of crumble? I don't know if I'm using the right word to describe it, but its def different when you bite into it. \n\nThey give you a generous basket of huge chips and lots of pico de gallo salsa. I had no complaints. If you want more salsa, just ask for it, they don't gripe. \n\nWould I come back?

Ah, but Todd, there are dozens to choose from, why should I go further?  \n\nWhat separates La Corneta rom the pack are the wonderful seafood options.  The fish taco has a fat sliver of crispy grilled salmon filet, the prawns are butterflied, deveined, juicy and perfectly grilled.  Trust me, anything seafood at this place is top drawer.  The other items are rather pedestrian, but get a fish taco, or prawn burrito, and you'll be blown away.\n\nAnother thing I have noticed about this place is it's immaculate dining area.  At first, I was suspicious, I usually feel more at home with the holes in the wall.  But after several trips here, I realized hey, it's clean!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-01-24", "description": "Our group of 5 friends stumbled into this place Saturday 1/22/11 for lunch because a lot of the other restaurants around the Mission area did not have enough seating (we originally wanted to eat at Mr Pollo, but that place was TINY and no outdoor seating available). Its a beautiful restaurant, very clean (including the restrooms), ample seating, and nice music from a live band. \nThe food itself was OK...my carnitas tacos were bland, despite the big portions. My friends enjoyed their burritos and plates. But the HORRIBLE thing about this place is that (1) They don't post their prices on their menu board, which (2) led us to be overcharged. I paid almost $28 for 3 carnitas tacos, a veggie burrito, a mexican coke and arizona ice tea. How was it this much, you might wonder??\nThe tacos were $3.00 each so a total of $9.00. Veggie burrito was $3.45. Drinks were $1.50 and $1.05, fine there. But the guy at the cash register charged me for an extra THREE carnitas tacos!  So I paid an extra $9.00 for ghost tacos. I didn't question it at the time because again, no prices posted on the menu board. If there are prices on the board, you cannot see them with the naked eye. That and you'd have to be behind the counter to see it. But I really don't remember seeing the prices. My girl friend paid $30 for a burrito and a combo plate and two drinks. She thought it was ridiculously high too, but we figured it was due to the fact that the place was big (this is SF, rent must be expensive) and live entertainment. I didnt' realize till later that evening that we got ripped off. And this happened to my sister's boyfriend, in another instance. He said he got charged for two burritos when he only got one. He got the run around at the restaurant when he brought the error up (\"My supervisor isn't available, you will have to wait for him\" and he did wait), but eventually got his money back. I would've gone back but I live in Sacramento, and didn't want to pay the $5 bay bridge toll + gas to drive out there again to make a point there. So this is why I'm posting it on Yelp. If you go to La Corneta Taqueria, make sure you pay attention to what they are charging you, and if it seems abnormally high, question them on what each item costs. I think its EXTREMELY shady to have a menu board that does not post their prices. All the more room for them to overcharge you. Not going there again.", "author": "Jasmine M."}

And girl can drink, too.  :-)\n\nBut at this place, think once, twice, thrice before you utter anything \"super ______\".  They don't kid around with super.\n\nNow, I remind you again, lest you forget, I can eat. \nBut the \"Super Steak/Prawn Quesadilla\" that was ordered for me at La Corneta was enormous.  At first, I'm thinking, \"Hmm... will I be full on just one quesadilla, super or not?\" and then when it came flying in looking like half a XL pizza (ok maybe a slight exaggeration but the thing was barely closing on itself because it was so full of \"stuff\")..... I was officially worried.\nThat ain't no Taco Bell Quesadilla, friends.  Welcome to the world of giants.\n\nI finished half with some work, and even then, I was full for the remainder of the day.  The only reason I could finish half was because of the perfectly toasted flour tortilla, and the fresh, juicy fillings, with lots of fresh guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, etc. that was too good to pass up....  I suspect most girls will finish about 1/4 of  this quesadilla, so dining \"family-style\" might be wise....\n\nThe establishment is bright and pleasant, and they have some nice seating in one section of the restaurant for a near \"patio-dining\" effect.  During lunch, it was pretty crowded, and I suspect the same will hold true for dinner.  Location was a bit fishy, but I didn't feel my life was in danger at any point.  Staff was so-so, but nothing to complain about.\n\nOh, and they have two kinds of salsa, one is mild and the other is hot, with fresh bits of jalapeno.  Now, for me, this was no challenge, but if you can't handle spicy - - go for the first, or pick out the jalapeno bits.  I didn't try the mild version but I could just eat up spoonfuls of the second one all day long and be happy.  Combined bite by bite with my quesadilla, it was perfect.\n\nI glanced around and noticed almost everything is big here.  It's not \"fast food cheap\" either, as lunch for two with two super quesadillas and two drinks was *almost* $20 if I recall correctly.  But service is fast, and the food is tasty and fresh.  Speaking of drinks - we tried the \"horchata\", I think it was called, and it was quite complementary to our food.  It's like sugar water with a good dose of cinnamon, what I imagine a churro to taste like if blended with water?  Doesn't sound appetizing but it was actually quite good.\n\nA strong 3-stars for the food, and an additional 1 star simply for being almost OVERLY generous with sizing.  While this meant i could not finish my meal, it does mean a big guy with a hearty apetite would walk out of here very, very, very happy.  :-)\n\nFYI - according to their menu, there are four locations, 2 in SF, one in Burlingame, and one in Redwood City.  They do take-out, phone orders, and have gift certificates.  Also, if planning a group event or big party -  they will also cater for you.  Not shabby at all!", "author": "Grace K."}

I made friends with the manager, who told me he was the owner's son. I can't remember his name but he was always super nice  to me and whoever I brought in there with me. Sometimes he would be flirty, but nothing too weird. I did get a sense he was a pervert on the DL, but it didn't bother me.\n\nOne night  I went in there and he chatted me up for a really long time and then he walked me 24th street. I thought it was funny, but I was like, oh he's just being friendly. So we get to the bart station and I say \"okay well, good night\" and he lunges at me and attempts to stick his tongue down my throat! I don't really remember what I said but I know I booked it down those stairs and ran to hop on a train as fast as I could.\n\nThe next few weeks I fretted about it, cuz while I wasn't really mad at him, I felt like I couldn't go in there to get food. And that made me sad. Eventually I returned to Corneta and the guy was just nice as usual, maybe a bit quiet, maybe a bit embarrassed. I never brought it up. That was so long ago, and the last few times I went there more recently he wasn't there. I have been informed that he was fired, and also that he was NOT the owner's son! \n\nSo all that being said, Corneta's food isn't exactly spectacular(especially with the other neighborhood options). But I do really like that it's clean and fresh and the fish items are typically good.  But my favorite item on the menu is the super tostada. They make the shells there, and even without any meat, it is an explosion of flavor. Just make sure you get a couple lime wedges to squeeze over it. Delicious.\n\nOh also, for whatever reason, they have the best refried beans. I believe they're vegetarian, but I could be wrong.

Not the greatest Burrito place.\"  I don't disagree, but I think that too much time is spent looking for \"the greatest burrito place\".  La Conrneta may not be the Platonic perfection of burrito places, but it makes a fine burrito, it's quick, not skimpy on the avocado/guacamole, provides tasty black beans, has some nice selections (tostadas and ceviche), and the food is fresh.\n\nThe prawns are especially excellent, but I approve of just about everything I've had here.  It's maybe not as well spiced as Cancun on a good night, and the salsa variety isn't as good as Pancho Villa, but when one wants a burrito or some nachos it's a fine choice.  \n\nThey do lack tortas, which irks me, but that's a minor quibble when all is said and done.", "author": "Gustie L."}

It's a swell place to linger over your food. It's huge, well-lit, and tiled. The people who work here don't look demoralized or harangued.\n\nI recommend the quesadillas; if you like camarones (shrimps), theirs are divine, esp. in the quesadilla. They grill them to this partly crispy perfection in garlic butter. The veggies are crisp, too; if you get the super, tell them easy on the sour cream. \n\nHowever, their burritos are lackluster. You can throw a dart at a map of the Mission and find a better burrito. They're fine, but not worth going out of your way for. For burritos, I'd rather get a great burrito from a filthy and slightly scary joint that feels like a way station in purgatorio (i.e., el Farolito or Cancun on 19th and Mission).

I went to the cashier to request the missing tortillas, and she responded you want MORE tortillas like she was doing me a huge favor and I was abusing their kindness!

In the crowded pantheon of Mission taquerias, Corneta deserves notice because their fish burritos use salmon.  Salmon!!  It's not lean, cheap junk meat either:  they use quality salmon and big pieces of it, too.  I don't know if salmon is a part of traditional Mexican cuisine, but it sure makes itself at home in a burrito, quesadilla, or taco.  Another thing I like about Corneta is that they offer the option of the \"baby\" burrito for a dollar less.  Don't get me wrong, the baby burritos are still extremely filling.  They also offer a range of agua frescas, including mango which is an oh-so-perfect match to spicy food.  They have a pretty extensive menu, so they had to use small lettering to fit it all on the wall; you're better off grabbing a takeout menu to make your choice.

I made the mistake of not getting them with guacamole, which made them a little dry, so I got back in line to get some. Just as I took out the 70 cents to pay for it, the lady behind the counter told me \"No, its fine.\" I was shocked. Its such a rare thing to get freebies and be treated so nicely around here...and it pays off for their business-- I was going to give 3 stars but their generosity bumped it up to 4.", "author": "L.

It's not a fancy dine-in per se, but who cares?  The place is CLEAN, the food is MUCHO DELICIOSO and the chicks preparing the burritos behind the glass counter are HOTTIES.  This place could be a Mexican style Hooters if they let the women walk around to serve tables.  Try their al pastor burritos!", "author": "Raging R."}

HOWEVER, if i was to get a little sompin- it'll definitely be a La Corneta Taqueria. Mainly, because from the jump, it has impressed me with the freshness- esp. anything seafood there. not wimpy not skimpy seafood. just like baja califas standards. juicy salmon burritos (agh! foggitaboutit, it's so delicious), prawn tacos (plump!), etc.  On a foggy day, you'll even appreciate the brightly colored walls and live music. So big love to La Corneta por vida, homes.", "author": "irie o."}

The only reason that I am not giving this a full 5 stars is due to the fact that the live music they had playing there was way too loud--so it was hard to communicate with the servers and to have a relaxing meal", "author": "alexandria s."}

I prefer this place to Pancho Villa and they have the best rice -- it has peas and carrots in it! You can choose your tortilla and beans and they'll make a custom burrito to order for next to nothing.  Sometimes there are communication difficulties if you 're a picky eater like me; English is spoken well by only a few but its worth it for the burritos.  The enchilladas are also recoomened along with their juices and horchata.", "author": "Mike G."}

For a second, it looked like they were putting chinese fried rice when they were making my burrito. Also, it would've been nice if they had a salsa bar like some of the other taquerias in the area have. Other than that, the burrito was okay.", "author": "Justagentlemen U."}

We walked in here last saturday after our photo shoot for our album and i was welcomed with smiles, great smelling food and great service. The woman working the register is gorgeous by the way and she is very effecient with her work. Give her a raise folks! I had gotten a super burrito with pastor and it was flavorful, fresh and filling and those are my 3 f's that i do not use often.  Even though this was not the best burrito i have ever had in my whole life, it's fo sho up there! I have been going to la corneta since the location in diamond first opened and this place is just as good and one of the best spots in mission. La Altena is still the best on mission tho for just a burrito but you have to go after 8 pm when the good cooks there. Here at la corneta, you get the works of great things, like very clean restrooms, great service and the best sangria! for that i will give more business and better rankings to LA CORNETA!", "author": "supa m."}
