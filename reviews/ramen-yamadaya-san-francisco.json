Soon, you will hate yourself and regret every decision you've ever made. \n\nBut in all seriousness, this place had pretty good food. The karaage and the takoyaki were just average, but the ramen was quite nice. The Yamadaya ramen is essentially just tonkotsu ramen, which is my favorite. The broth was rich but not oily and it had a creamy and smooth mouthfeel. The noodles were perfectly chewy and slurpable. The pork belly was fatty and very tender. \n\nAlthough most of the ramen was good, there were some bad things about it. The egg was cold in the middle which means they don't make the eggs fresh.

Later during our meal, I asked her for a refill and that refill obviously never came. \n\nAs for our food, the rock shrimp tempura was actually excellent. It was fried perfectly and I like the sauce that was drizzled on top. The yamadaya ramen experience was very dissappointing. While I liked the noodles, nori and the broth, the meat and the garlic looked unpleasant. There were actually half-size chunks of garlic in my soup (supposed to be all sliced pieces) and the charsu didn't taste tender.

You can even double the portion for $2, which is a great deal in my opinion. \n\nThe broth... I'm not sure what's gone wrong here. Both times the broth has been lukewarm, which means it turns cold after you finish about 1/3 of your noodles. I forgave it the first time, but cold broth twice in a row means it's probably always cold. \n\nMy excitement died as soon as I did the first slurp. No punch in the face, no drama, no fire (literally... because of cold broth). Usually when I finish good ramen, my body's telling me \"no more\" but my mind tells me \"yes yes you can eat another bowl\", but here, I don't feel any emotion after I'm done.

I thought that it better be the best bowl of ramen in San Francisco if it takes this long.\n\nAnyways, when I got my order finally it looked pretty nice with 3 pieces of pork belly and a nice looking broth. The taste was pretty good, and the fire spice level was nice, but I was still perplexed on why it took so long seeing as someone who came and sat down when I was almost done with mine got hers in less than 10 minutes. It just made me think that they forgot to put my order in and scrambled when they remembered.\n\nAnyways, the food was 7/10 but the service and pricing gets maybe a 3/10.

We originally tried to go a newer ramen spot in Union Square, but the wait was insane. She recommended Ramen Yamadaya as her favorite ramen spot she's tried so far since moving to San Francisco, and also noted that the line will likely be shorter. \n\nWe put our name on the wait list through Yelp and we only had to wait 10-15 minutes to get a table once we arrived. Me, her, and our other friend were starving and shared a chicken katsu bento to start. The chicken katsu was really nicely fried; not overly oily and still crispy. A good starter to share, though sharing rice and miso soup doesn't work out quite as well (haha). I ordered the Yamadaya and it satisfied my ramen craving for sure. The broth was flavorful and I liked the chewy consistency of the noodles. The piece of pork on the top was huge, though my piece was a bit too fatty for my liking since it wasn't rendered down as much as I'd like. All in all, however, a good meal! Service was a tad slow, but I'll give them a pass since it was a Friday night.\n\nPS: Check in on Yelp to get a free soda.

Don't get me wrong, it's not bad by any measure; it's just not great either. The broth was very oily, which isn't surprising for a tonkotsu broth ramen. The oiliness of the pork bone broth usually adds to the flavor, but the problem with Yamadaya's broth is that it lacks depth in flavor. There's the superficial salty flavor of soy sauce and salt, but no umami. The two things that stood out were the egg and the actual kakuni. The ajitama was cooked to perfection and the pork belly (for the most part) was tender and flavorful. The service was mediocre at best, as it seemed like nobody was communicating with each other. It took us a good 5 min to get someone to take our order for anything. I probably wouldn't eat here again, just bc there are still so many other places to try in SF! I'd say check out Hinodeya across the street before coming here. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the Kakuni Ramen:\n- Noodles: 3 stars\n- Broth: 1 stars\n- Ajitama (egg): 5 stars\n- Kakuni (pork belly): 4.5 stars", "author": "Rie U."}

When you walk up the stairs, you're asked to put your name in the ipad and someone will call you. The place was almost empty so we walked right in and a gentleman sat us immediately. The place was cute! Lots of windows, table tops, booths and a giant communal table in the middle. \n\nWhen we were greeted with a server in less than a minute; probably because the place was close to empty. Told him we needed another minute to look at the menu. While he was away, my friend and I decided on our ramen and was on the fence with what appetizer(s) to get. Once the server came back, we asked what he would recommend and he abruptly said, \"you're in a ramen house! I recommend ramen!\" Not in a playful way, more like an annoyed way. I looked at him and said, \"no kidding? WE'RE IN A RAMEN HOUSE?!?!\" Then rolled my eyes and said, \"If you let us finish, we were asking for recommendations on appetizers.\" By that point, he was not having it with us, so he recommended we try anything lol It was quite hysterical how grouchy he was. Oh well, maybe the previous table didn't tip him well, or something...\n\nFor appetizers, we started with the gyoza for about $5; came with 6 pieces and dipping sauces. The gyoza was pan fried on one side but over seemed to have a gummy wrapping. Flavor was nice but not stand out. We also got (2) shrimp buns for $7. It was fried shrimp with cilantro, red onions and a spicy aioli. I liked it! Crispy shrimp, liked the aioli and the bun was light. \n\nFor my meal, I got the Yamada-ya ramen for $13. I'm a little confused as the menus that were presented to me aren't the same menu as I see online or on Yelp pictures. There wasn't a variety of Yamada-ya ramen, like the shoyu or kotteri style. I could be wrong but I just saw Yamada-ya ramen: chashu, kakuni, bamboo shoots, garlic, nori, green onion and green onion. I thought it was going to be a normal broth, more like a shoyu broth, but what I got was something SUPER oily...too oily I could drink it. It was heavy and the oil seem to mask a lot of the flavor. What I did like though, were the noodles. They were cooked perfectly and held up in the broth. Overall a good dish, not stellar.\n\nI think I would return for another try at another kind of ramen.

I've had a lot of ramen in like Vegas, sf, A few places in sac and Reno... and honestly, I find myself thinking about this place a lot and missing this place hahaha.\n\nI got the spicy miso & also one of the first spicy one on the menu, I forgot what it's called. But the broth they have is so thick and rich. I did take off half star for that tho becuz it's sooo thick... I'm the type that likes slightly heavier tasting food but even that is a LITTLE too much. so if you are into lighter seasoning for food, this is probably not so much for you? \n\nAlso, level 2 spicy is pretty spicy, my broth was red, so beware! I also love getting their karaage because you get a lot for the portion and it's yummy. I also like that they have the $5 side option so that you can try their other dishes on top of ramen, I actually... LOVE THAT A LOT and I wish every place does that. \n\nMy friend also got the takoyaki and that's one item that I don't really recommend. It was kinda too soggy inside and wasn't very crispy on the outside either. Another half star for that.\n\nThe service was also pretty good. I was there near the end of the night so the service got a little slow but nothing too bad, it only happened toward the end when we paid. Prices are also very reasonable for sf. I would come back just to try all of their different ramen ;) they have a lot!!!!!\n\nLastly, if I've learned anything about ramen is that people do it v differently and ppl like diff taste. Don't listen 100% to reviews and try it yourself too ;)", "author": "Jen K."}

Ramen Yamadaya is on the second floor of the building, and on the steps there was a sign that said we can get waitlisted for a table via yelp. So I signed myself and my partner up for a table though the yelp app. After waiting for a table for 20 minutes, the yelp app told us the table was ready, but the problem was when we went in and showed the staff that my yelp app said our table was ready, we were told that we actually weren't put on their guestlist. Instead of investigating the situation, a staff member, a middle aged asian man with glasses, simply told us to start over and put our name on their waitlist again. I asked why they would advertise to have a service for table reservations through yelp if they weren't going to follow through with giving us a table, and the waiter, the middle aged asian man with glasses, started going on a tirade, saying that they didn't need yelp, they did fine without it, and they weren't responsible for getting us a table if we use their services to get a reservation, since he claimed yelp's reservation requests weren't connected to their internal system. After around 10 minutes of getting awkwardly standing there while being berated, we asked to speak to someone else, while the older man finally gave up and ignored us to serve accepted several parties that came in after us. Finally, one of the young waitresses finally came over, pressed a few buttons on the check in tablet, and there were our names, in the completed table's section, verifying our reservation. \n\nThe man then looked shocked and instead of apologizing for the treatment and the lost reservation, doubled down on his argument that we should have checked in at the desk in addition to checking in through yelp. Hungry and tired I simply informed him that if that were the policy, they should have someone at the front able to address people's inquiries. Having taken a good look at the tablet while the waitress was on it, I believe that they had already crossed our name off the list as they believed that it had been completed. \n\nIn regards to the food, we both ordered two Yamada-ya Ramen and found them to be quite average. The booth, although thick, was very bland with the noodles slightly undercooked. \n\nOverall, this was one of the worst services I've ever experienced and I will never be returning to this establishment. I recommend Marufuku across the street in the Japan town Mall, where the old Sapporo-ya ramen shop used to be. Or if you're out in Palo Alto, Ramen Nagi, who actually brought people over from their Shinjuku, Tokyo branch to work over there. That ramen is on par with the best of Ramen in Tokyo.

It's just a bit greasy. You can see bits of fat floating on top or congealed onto the slices of see weed on the side. It deters me from wholeheartedly enjoying the broth. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered hell ramen and I ordered the Yamada spicy ramen.\n\nThough he claims hell ramen wasn't very spicy, he was drenched in sweat by the end of the meal. He ended up going to the bathroom to splash water on his face to cool down. Later in the evening he told me that he can feel the hot oil swooshing around in this stomach....\n\nFlavor wise the ramens were decent. Both portions came with generous amount of pork, though there was a huge fatty slice in mine that I did not eat. You can see in the pictures. No heart attacks for me thank you very much. \n\nThe part I didn't like about the meal was the ambience. They played 1960s hits which didn't go well with the more modern decor of the restaurant. The waiters while kind and generous skewed on the younger side and were not very professional nor knowledgeable. When asked about the spice levels our waiter said he doesn't know. When asked about how spicy hell ramen is, his response was the same. While wiping down the table next to us, another waiter splashed some water towards our end, but didn't wipe it down. \n\nAdding to this was the fact that the restaurant staff all worked conspicuously next to the counter putting together to go deliveries and the like. It was just not very polished...I also saw several restaurant employees come back to the restaurant holding bags of frozen shrimp. Probably brought from the store across from the street. The floor was also very slippery...from grease?\n\nOverall it's a good place for a quick meal. Don't know if I'd come back again though. :/", "author": "Sherica L."}

Everything was good and the portions were very generous.  I would probably pass on the salmon and ikura bowl.  Though it was good the cut of salmon did not look like a decent cut.  It had no marbling on the pieces I got.  The chicken katsu curry was my favorite.  Huge portion and the curry had potatoes, carrots, and meat.

Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, Ramen Yamadaya is the most excellent local Japanese restaurant that I've ever discovered all thanks to the Yelp app. Perfect for friends, family and co-workers gathering all day and all night. A well visit! My rating: 4 solid stars.", "author": "William L."}

I think it is under new management and the crew are not Japanese people anymore. The menu has changed and the service crew is mostly Filipinos. We ordered spicy miso and my hubby told the waiter to make it spicy hot. The ramen came and it was not spicy hot at all, the noodles are a bit tough, Chashu had a funky smell, and the broth was just ok. I don't think it's worth $13 for a single bowl at all. $7 for three pieces of ebi for appetizer is just too much and it was served cold, could be sitting in the kitchen.. who knows. Waiter didn't even check us if we need anything. \n\nTheir chicken karaage was dry and flavorless, not the typical Japanese chicken karaage that is when well prepared, it's crunchy and flavorful. We have eaten at so many ramen place so we know what it should look and taste like. Anyway, I guess we will cross this out of our go to ramen place when we're at Japan town.", "author": "Lyn W."}

Their bone broth was very flavorful and the amount of meat they give is kind of crazy. I'm used to getting two slice of thin pork. Here I got like 5 chunky pieces and half of them was quite tender and juicy. The other half was a little dry. Maybe the cut of the meat? They also give one whole egg in halves rather than just half an egg. \n\nThere are also two options of noodles. By default you will get the thinner version. The thicker version is suppose to be chewier but I didn't think it was. The meal was packaged nicely in a bowl with soup separated. I could've used a little more soup. The noodles were stuck together, but what do you expect for take out? My friend had added a fire bomb to it. She said it was pretty darn spicy and she only added a little bit of it. I wonder what level the death bomb is at. \n\nI want to go try this restaurant in person to give it a true rating. I heard though, that the line is out the door and around the corner on some days.

Their broths were extremely rich just the way I like and the ramen was cooked well. Unfortunately the \"soft egg\" was not a soft boiled egg but rather an over cooked ball of rubber. However, the egg didn't deter me from enjoying my meal because I didn't eat all of it. \n\nNow comes time to leave. It takes an excessively long amount of time for someone to come. But my party and I are still gushing about how delicious everything was. \n\nAn older gentleman finally comes with the tablet to charge us. And like most people these days my party and I ask if they are able to split the check. He becomes visibly unhappy which is understandable, it's peak dinner time and they're busy. But what comes next from this gentleman completely blows my mind. He raises his voice enough that neighboring tables turn around to see what the commotion is. Half my party was asking if they would be able pay with cash while I paid with card. He loudly exclaims, \"DOES IT LOOK LIKE I HAVE A CASH REGISTER ON ME?\" I wasn't sure how to answer him but good thing he decided to storm off without another word. After a couple of minutes he comes by with a printed check and  practically drops the tray on the table. A younger gentleman comes by after seeing the commotion to see if he can help us out. We quietly hand him a card and cash to pay for our meal hoping the same older man wouldn't be coming back to terrorize us further. But he's back and this time he snaps at his coworker saying, \"DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHATS GOING ON. HOW THEY WANT TO PAY?\" He then looks down at the tray and sees a single card and a single bill. And again he raises his voice saying, \"I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE PAYING INDIVIDUALLY WHAT IS THIS?\" He grabs the money out of his coworkers hands and storms away once again.\n\nNever did we ask to pay individually all we wanted to know was if we could pay a sum of cash and the rest on a card. \n\nThe food just wasn't good enough to make up for getting yelled at the way we did tonight.", "author": "Sidney W."}

I've gone several times to a few locations, and I have also been to the San Francisco location several times too.\n\nWhile the tonkotsu ramen here is still very delicious, a couple things about this location seemed to have changed from the previous times I had been here.  One of them being the menu.  It was definitely different from when I last visited and what stuck out was that I couldn't find the kotteri version on it.  I'm not sure if they got rid of it or if I just missed it somewhere, but since the kotteri version is my go-to at Yamadaya, I was a little sad that I couldn't find it.\n\nThe service also seemed to have gone down a little bit.  I remember previously the service was very top-notch, but during this visit, the service did run into a few snags, including a missed order (got resolved quickly though).  Not to say that the service was terrible, but it definitely wasn't the same as before.\n\nThat being said, Yamadaya is still a great place to go to for tonkotsu.  Since I couldn't find the kotteri, I ordered their regular tonkotsu with the extra thick noodles (my personal preference), and it still turned out great.  Broth was spot on, the crispy garlic was a nice touch, and the chashu was particularly memorable, very good char yet very juicy.

The broth was very thick, flavorful, and I added the black garlic oil which made it much richer. The ramen was not the typical low end ramen that I might find in a lot of other ramen stores. They used a thinner, yet still has a very good texture and taste. Combined with the broth, it tasted beyond my expectation. The pork belly was gigantic, yet tender, very rich in flavor, and it was one of the best pork belly I have tasted. However, people might find it a bit too oily and has too much fat. I personally not a pork lover, but I will have this pork belly. All other ingredients were nice, good quality, and went well with the ramen. We also order salad and curry rice bowl, they were both nice. We ended up not finishing the meal, because we weren't too hungry, and the ramen broth was thick and made me filled up easily.\n\nI think most people could handle the broth, I personally not a big fan on oil and fat. The broth maybe too thick for me.\n\nOverall, the ramen was very good. It was a very different, yet very good style among all other ramen shops in the Bay Area.

I will definitely come again.\n\n*December 5th update*\n\nI m here for lunch this time and found out they retired their confusing-flashy-fastfood style menu!

So we breezed past the (nonexistent) Yelp Res line and took a seat. We were served almost immediately, and the food came out in about five minutes, a quick turnaround!\n\nBut what came out was underwhelming, if I'm honest. The noodles were pretty good, they're thinner if that's your kind of thing (I know it's mine). I like that there were multiple kinds of meat in the bowl, but I didn't really like any of them. They were there, and cooked well, but they didn't have much flavor and consequently just served as a distraction from the noodles. The spicy tonkotsu broth sort of just tasted like the peppers I ordered in it (Hot, because I didn't want to jump straight into Fire, Hell, or Death without at least a little confidence in their idea of what \"hot\" meant). It didn't have much of a taste of its own, sort of like a blank canvas, but the picture the peppers painted was uninteresting, sort of like the finger painting of your neighbor's preschool kid. The \"Hot\" also wasn't terribly spicy IMO, definitely less so than Mensho's spicy bowls. And at $14/bowl, it wasn't \"cheap and cheerful\" ramen either.\n\nAlso it didn't sit well with either of us, and we don't have particularly weak stomachs either, so take that as you will. For that reason alone we won't be back, but I don't think we'll be missing out on much.", "author": "Shawn W."}

This place is located outside of the main Japantown center.  It is across from the peace plaze and you need to walk up the stairs to get here.  Getting a table here can be hard because this place gets back so fast, especially on a weekend.  They have great lunch menu where you can get a bowl of ramen with a side or two.  The few times I've been here, i've always ordered the Yamadaya Tonkotsu Kotteri Ramen.  The Yamadaya Tonkatsu kotteri had a soft boiled egg, chashu, pork belly, mushrooms, scallions, bamboo shoots, black garlic oil, fried garlic.  Yes, I'll admit this soup had a lot of flavor and the eggs where cooked perfect. The noodles didn't seem to do it for me.   The noodle seem too thick for me.   \n\nIf you want side dishes to share, I suggest you take advantage of their combination menu.

I'm not sure if there is a wait normally.\n\nI ordered the tonkotsu kotteri ramen, which is what my coworker recommended. I had pretty high expectations since I trust my coworkers who suggested this place to me, but I didn't think the ramen was all that great. My favorite part was probably the broth, which was indeed rich and creamy as advertised. The noodles were a little bit thinner that what I like, but they were still okay. \n\nMy main problem with the ramen was with the pork. There were two types of pork in my ramen, a fattier kind which I assumed was kakuni (braised pork belly) and two less fatty slices (which were chashu I think?). Both tasted dry and I had a hard time eating them, especially the chashu. For me, the pork that comes with ramen should be soft and melt-in-your-mouth tender, but the meat here was the opposite.\n\nI don't know if I would recommend this ramen spot to anyone.

The ramen noodle is very thin and the texture is great since the noodles were soaked with the broth. The pork (cha siu) is cooked just right and meaty. I also ordered a couple of their sides: shiitake bun, chicken karage, and gyoza. The shiitake bun was a mistake because the veggie inside the bun was super sour and ruined my taste with the ramen bowl. The chicken karage and the gyoza was usual and was ok. \n\nThe only thing special about this place would be their ramen broth because it is very rich in favor!!!

There are 3 parts to every ramen bowl: the soup base, the noodles, and the toppings. As a first timer, the atmosphere and rich soup base makes a lasting impact. Coupled with the best noodle texture I've experience in Japantown along with the fatty pork belly this ramen place is bold! However like bold experiences, I would recommend coming here too often as the richness can seem overpowering if you had such a rich ramen recently. \n\nSpicy Ramen: \nYou could even try the 3 - 6 levels of Spicy ramen, but I would start out with the less spicy levels as they just add more chili. Be careful, I don't think I would recommend higher than level 2 if you don't enjoy challenging your spice tolerance on a normal basis. At level 6 (Death), you could be practically scoping a chopsticks chuck full of chili each bite and still not finish the chili...you really don't need that much chili and it's an understatement to say how spicy it is.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-08-06", "description": "8/5/16:  Ramen Yamadaya was my all-time favorite ramen joint EVER.  Or at least, the one particular location hidden behind cheap glass and draperies, camouflaged within the small strip-mall, reminiscent of a what you'd imagine to be a ghost town at the urban edge of Los Angeles:\n\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/ramen-yamadaya-torrance\n\nAlas, this place is absolutely nothing like the Torrance location, nor any of its outgrowths in the OC.  Sure, it has that Japanese ramen house look and feel, complete with servers outfitted in typical garb, though lacking those who shout Japanese greetings as you walk in... sure, it has all that, but so do many other places.\n\nBut the food..... WTF.  Again, WTF.  Now, perhaps I made the mistake of thinking that \"Ramen Yamadaya\" is a particular brand, and this place is associated with the those SoCal locations.  Is it not?--if you know, please message me.  But as it stands, the ramen might as well have been cooked on two different sides of the earth...\n\n1. Yamadaya Kotteri $12.95 \"rich & fatty ramen with black garlic oil\":  Ramen to me can be scored by 4 components:\n\nNoodles:  Definitely overcooked and too soft.  That was easy.  FAIL.\n\nThe Egg:  Perfect.  Absolutely delicious.  The yolk was rich and creamy, but just cooked enough to be more pudding than runny.  A bit of flavor in the white too.  WIN.\n\nChashu:  Mixed on this one.  The flavor is great--really rich and pungent.  And really tender--very much melts in thy mouth... but is always the problem.  It just falls apart.  Can't even pick up a piece with your chopsticks as it just disintegrates.\n\nBroth:  Ah... Kotteri.... it states right in the menu \"rich & fatty\".  NOPE NOPE NOPE.  If you ever have the chance to go to that Torrance location linked above, then you'll see \"rich & fatty.\"  Basically a melted pig there.  This.... I dunno how they could possibly think this is Kotteri.  If rich means milky, and fatty means ........ um, ... lean?--sure.  No, not even close.  As for that \"black garlic oil\"--I LOVE that stuff, and they add a sht ton in the Torrance location.  So much so that there is a layer of oil covering your soup.  Check out my pics for this location's--like a tiny 1sq in area.  Seriously Yamadaya?--situated in one of the richest cities in America and you can't afford to give another teaspoon more?  FAIL FAIL FAIL.\n\nDisgrace to the Yamadaya name.  But alas, it still tastes alright if not comparing to The Beast from Torrance.  3.5/10\n\n1b. Paigu Pork Loin Topping $3.50:  I like it.  Well, alright, though the top was crusty and crispy, the bottom was soaked in oil and a bit soggy.  The pork was quite juicy--about 1/3rd of the pieces might have used a little less cooking time, but that's being picky.  Still juicy.  6/10\n\nSo, food was a wash.\n\nService.......... sucked.  Like it took 10min for someone to ask my for my order, and only after I waved someone down.  20min for me to receive my first food--the ramen.  The pork actually came 5min after that.  And then after I was done I sat another 10min before I had to wave my waitress down for the bill.  So.... yeah, service is definitely worse than your typical ramen place.\n\nWell, if you need a quick fix, I guess there's this place.  But don't come here cause you love Yamadaya, as this place is the angry and abused bastard child.\n\n3/5\n\n#japaneseramen #ramen #sanfrancisco #japantown", "author": "Dean C."}

(I needed to flag him down) no greeting or anything. He didn't even ask what we would like to order, just put his pen to his pad and looked at us. Okay, I can get over that part.  \n\nThe food starts to come out, I took a bite out of my tonkatsu, not bad. My girlfriend's takoyaki and ramen come out, bad. Takoyaki is bland, barely any sauce. We asked for some extra sauce and the waitress looked at me funny and said \"takoyaki sauce\" as if I asked for something that wasn't supposed to be found at a Japanese restaurant. Goes to the kitchen and comes back to tell me that the takoyaki sauce and donkatsu sauce are the same (even though they taste different). Fine. The ramen comes out luke-warm, and a little too rich. We didn't want to be difficult so we ask for some hot water to put in her ramen. Guy brings me a cup where I feel no heat at all, sees me looking at it and then brings me another. Same thing. No hot water? At a restaurant? That's probably a health code violation, by the way they hid their health score behind a piece of green paper in the kitchen. Figures. \n\nTo top it all off the takoyaki sauce girl brings us the check while I was still eating. Horrible service. And you guys might want to get that circuit checked out for your hot water.

I would expect better from Japantown. \n\nNoodles - thin noodles with a nice, springy texture overall. Unfortunately, some of the noodles were glued together, forming clumps within the ramen.\n\nBroth - Pretty standard shoyu broth. Could have used a bit more of it, since there was less than I expected. I ended up with more ramen than broth by the end of the bowl, and I'm usually not a huge broth drinker.\n\nToppings - The tonkatsu and menma were the favorite part of this ramen for me. The tonkatsu was sweet, flaky, and tender, with a generous amount. The menma was crunchy and not stringy - there were only 3 pieces though which was a little disappointing. \n\nMy dessert probably brought my experience down from a 3.5 to a 3. I was hoping for a hot, fresh tayaki with creamy red bean paste, but unfortunately my tayaki dreams were not to be fulfilled. The tayaki was quite small (about the size of my fist). The fried exterior tasted stale and the bean paste instead was dry and crumbling. \n\nOn a side note, my friend ordered the spicy ramen at level 6 (\"death\") and it was preettty spicy. So spicy that the spice completely overwhelmed the fatty pork flavor of the broth, but definitely good for spice lovers.", "author": "Hali M."}

It's almost as good as my favorite ramen place in SoCal. Ramen restaurants tend to always serve a few chashu pork slices in their soup which is not filling for me, so I always order extra chashu.\nThe longest I waited to get a seat was about 20 min on a Tuesday. The waiting area can get crowded because once the seating area gets filled, a lot of people are left standing. \nI went back to their Yelp page today and looked at their menu pictures and saw they had a health warning a year ago.

It was my first time here and was delighted to see my honey and I could be seated without waiting in line.  I know it was all the luck of timing as my eyes caught sight of the sign-in clipboard in the vestibule though.\n\nRamen Yamadaya is located upstairs in that tiny Buchanan plaza in Japantown.  They have booth seating, communal tables and side by side seating close to others.  The sounds of top pop songs are blaring in this vibrant atmosphere as friendly staff bustles around serving and bussing.  My honey ordered the modest  Yamadaya Shio with basic pork broth, and me being the spicy hot fiend was going to go straight for the Yamadaya Spicy's Death Ramen.  However, our server advised me not to go there if I hadn't tried their spicy ramen before.  I relented and went with the Hell Ramen, but ultimately, decided I would have been fine with Death Ramen like I do with Teeth SF's Death sauce in the Mission.  Regardless, we enjoyed our ramen full of kikurage mushrooms, egg, bamboo shoots, green onions and generous amounts of pork.  I added corn to mine which were in sparse amounts.  The broth had the typical thick viscosity of most ramens- very heavy.  My honey asked for kaedama (extra noodles).  So they brought more warm ramen noodles on a side dish.  It was more than enough for one person.  So I also indulged.  The ramen noodles here are the thin, straight kind.  It was my first time, but I stick by my favorite thick, wavy ramen noodles which seem to absorb more flavor than the skinny ones.  The incredible amounts of flavorful, soft morsels of pork in the ramen are not typical if you prefer a very carnivorous bowl of ramen.  \n\nAll ramen joints are not alike, but if you enjoy the differences despite deviating from your favorite, Ramen Yamadaya is worth it.

It looked pretty impressive because they give you a huge slab.  It got me really excited to finally try a new ramen spot for me in SF.\n\nTheir menu is pretty extensive and I like how you're not limited to just ramen.  They also pork belly buns, rice bowls and curry bentos.  When I went there for lunch with a friend, we shared their Takoyaki, Chicken Karaage, and their famous Kakuni Pork Belly along with our bowls of ramen.\n\nTakoyaki -- http://bit.ly/1EMwmFL\nTakoyaki was good.  Each piece had a nice piece of octopus.\n\nChicken Karaage -- http://bit.ly/1GDhdqv\nIf you know me, I almost always order Chicken Karaage with my ramen.  Their Chicken Karaage is very lightly fried with a thin batter.  It was \n\nKakuni Pork Belly -- http://bit.ly/1DwuKsr\nYeah, they're Kakuni Pork Belly game is serious here at Ramen Yamadaya.  Just look at the pic!  Huuuuuuuuge slab and it was cooked well and made for a great side with the ramen.\n\nYamadaya Ramen -- http://bit.ly/1Aa7FeQ\nTonkotsu Ramen w/ Yamadaya Topping (Kakuni Pork, Chashu Pork, Scallion, Menma, Seasoned Egg, Dried Seaweed)\nI decided on trying their namesake ramen since it pretty much had everything I like included in the bowl.  And it was a good bowl of ramen.  The tonkotsu broth was just right and not too salty and the eggs were just slightly soft boiled making them somewhat runny which is how I like it.  And they don't hold back on the pork,  As you can see from the pic, they give a generous amount.\n\nOverall, Ramen Yamadaya is a very solid ramen joint if you're in the Japantown area.  I would  love to go back and try their curry and pork belly buns.  I wouldn't come here all the time, but I know that if I'm around the area craving some ramen I'd be willing to drop by if the wait is not too long.", "author": "Rodney H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-04-24", "description": "I really don't like to write negative reviews, so I will try to just be as objective as possible in this post. I ate at Ramen Yamadaya with my friends a couple weeks ago, and had a nice time. Half of the party was seated before we got there, so I can't really speak on behalf of wait times for dinner. Our waiter led us to our corner booth and had us all seated. The room is square with booths lining the walls. In the middle of the room is a long table (or two? I can't funny remember now; I didn't want to look for too long because people were eating there) where bigger parties or a bunch of small parties can eat. We were a party of 7, so the booth was full and I got to sit at the end. \n\nOur waiter seemed friendly enough when he took our initial drink orders, until he asked us if we were going to want to split the check. I've worked at a restaurant and I know that splitting checks for big parties can be a pain, and I try to avoid it if possible. I'm sure our party would have been completely fine paying on one or two tabs and Venmoing one another later (we do it all the time--in fact we'd been doing it all day during our day out in SF). But since he asked, we pretty much thought, \"Sure, why not?\" and said yes to splitting checks. He then responded by kind of sighing and saying something along the lines of, \"Well, that's gonna be a lot of work, but I'll do it.\" None of us were upset about it, in fact no one acknowledged that that happened until much later and I think we were all more confused than anything else. \n\nAnyway, the food took a normal amount of time to come out. Each of us ordered ramen, and I can't remember which exact meal I ordered. We all started eating right away, but I honestly noticed the broth start to gelatinize not long after the bowl was put in front of me. I saw the little blobs of fat starting to form before it had cooled off at all, but I thought it might just be the meat I ordered. It got chunkier the longer it was out. The noodles were also pretty undercooked. Anyway, I thought I might have been the only one with the fat cooling too fast in my ramen, but when I looked at the other bowls before we left, I noticed there was pretty much a thick layer of almost completely solid fat at the top of everyone else's ramen bowls as well. Like, with normal broths and soups it would take hours and hours to develop a skin of fat that thick, but it only took around half an hour to 45 minutes for it to happen there. \n\nSo yeah, I'm not too sure what it is about this place that makes the broth solidify so quickly. I liked the feel of the place and the workers were friendly overall. It's also in a really cute spot with a nice view of Japantown.", "author": "Jasmine R."}

They left and we laughed. Of course they didn't. This isn't a American Japanese restaurant that has one of everything on the menu. \n\nIt took a while to be seated, but we felt almost like we were in Japan, except for the lack of smoke/grease/steam pall hanging about halfway down most ramen places. \n\nWe both ordered the Yamadaya Kotteri, the \"Rich & Fatty Ramen with Black Garlic Oil\". Our eyes rolled back as we sipped the delicious broth and had pretty much the best noodles I have ever had. Amazingly thin, but still with a good chewiness, we expressed our compliments to a gentleman standing with a pad and he beamed - he was the manager. \"We do our best to use the traditional way of making things\" he said and we complimented him again. \n\nIf you like ramen, this is a must-visit.

I ordered a pork katsu box and my friends each ordered a Yamadaya ramen. The katsu was really good ! I think it's a good alternative if you don't want ramen. It comes with miso soup as well, however my miso was not hot at all, the temperature was the same as warm sink water. My friend really enjoyed the spicy miso broth in his ramen, so I really recommend that!

I had the regular tonkotsu ramen and I thought it was satisfying enough for me. Decent slices of pork, bamboo shoots, and a just-right soft boiled egg. My brother had the Kakuni ramen with extra noodles. Personally I don't think you need the extra noodles but the braised pork belly is worth the upgrade. Wished the noodles had a little more bite to them and that there was a little more broth inside the massive bowls. Satisfying on a chilly SF evening nonetheless.\n\nWas surprised that they have a low health score.

It's a little bit on the pricey side ($11-13) for a bowl of ramen, but it sure does hit the spot. For what it's worth, their ramen always has huge portions. It has thin ramen noodles, which I'm a fan of. This joint is perfect for rainy and cold days. It gets very crowded during rush hour. \n\nSERVICE: It took us about 10 minutes to get seated after we were waiting in line. The friendly server took orders for drinks and checked in occasionally to make sure the experience is enjoyable. Our food took about 10-15 minutes to get served. \n\nSETTING: It's tucked away on top of the shabu restaurant in Japantown, really easy to spot. It's very dimly lit inside but still has a cozy feeling. There are booths around the outside and a large table where everyone is seated together in the middle that has a centerpiece of cute lil succulents. Also has additional tables lining the sides for smaller parties. On every table, there's two boxes that have spices in them so make sure to add the spices they have available if you're needing that extra kick in your food!\n\nFOOD: I tried the Yamadaya Shio ($13) which is the basic salt-based pork ramen. It came with kakuni pork (fatty pork belly), chashu pork, wood ear mushroom, menma, dried seaweed, and a dash of green onion on top. The broth is so rich and flavorful, which is one of the things I love about this place. Some ramen places have clear and watery broth but it is evident that this restaurant puts some love into theirs. It also comes with a perfectly runny soft boiled egg, and is piled on with delicious and fatty kakuni pork.\nI also had the Yamadaya Koterri ($13) another time I went, which is rich and fatty ramen with black garlic oil. The only point I would have to make about this is that it is very strong in garlic flavor from the big chunks of garlic that's added in it. The garlic oil didn't add too much flavor either. Other than that, a filling and flavorful bowl. \n\nOverall, Ramen Yamadaya is on the pricer side compared to some places I've been to but is worth it in the end. I definitely have to try their karaage in the future.", "author": "Anne P."}

The wait for a party of two was quite lengthy, roughly 30 minutes, but may have been partially due to the crowd during the festival weekend.\n\nI tried the tonkotsu kotteri, which was very rich, heavy, and flavorful from the 20-hour stewed pork bone broth (tonkotsu). Kotteri means rich or heavy, so they put the rendered pork fat back into the broth, thus yielding a thick, creamy, bold-flavored base to the bowl of ramen. It was a bit too much for me, so I couldn't finish all the broth. But if you love the idea of drinking fat, by all means give the kotteri style a try. I'll just stick to the regular tonkotsu next time.\n\nThe ramen noodles are on the thin side, but still have a nice al dente bite. The chasu was decent, though a bit tough and chewy. The pork belly was more flavorful, smokey, and fatty. But the standout ingredient I was most pleased with was the salty, gooey, medium-cooked egg. I was also taken by surprise that I received a whole egg, as several other ramen places offer only half.\n\nService is very quick, and the restaurant, although small, had a speedy turnaround time for serving hungry customers. I'll definitely give Ramen Yamadaya another try, hopefully when there's no festival in the neighborhood.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

Trap Queen by Fetty Wap came on and my life was complete, just for a moment. \n\nOk, now on to the food. \n\nFor the first time in forever, I tried a chicken ramen in a soy flavored broth. I normally order pork. \n\nThe portion was definitely smaller than most ramen places given the price. If you are terribly hungry, I would suggest ordering more from the menu.\n\nI found the broth to be balanced between savory and salty. The fried chicken pieces were moist, and the crispy exteriors held up to the broth. The noodles were also thicker, and held up well. Surprisingly, there was no jammy egg, which would have made the dish a bit better in my opinion. \n\nIn the end it's a little pricey given the portion, but very delicious.

The broth is rich and creamy with just enough spices and earthy flavors that meet you upfront and firmly shake your hand. It's utterly addicting. \n\nThe place itself is actually small, which is why sometimes it can get busy.

We went upstairs to see how long the wait would be as there was already 15 people waiting but we didn't get an answer.  We checked out some other restaurants and ended up back here and put our name on the list.  We waited by the open window which offered a nice breeze.  The wait was about 30 minutes so not too bad.\n\nThere are some booths along the side of the window and then tables with chairs that are pretty close to each other.  It took a few minutes for us to decide what to have and we were approached 3 times by servers to see if we were ready to order.  I decided on the tonkotsu ramen for $9.25 and we shared 6 gyoza for $4.45.  The food came out quickly and the food was hot.\n\nWas it good? Yes. But there was one or two pork slices and I like my protein.  Lots of carb but wish I got a meal with more meat.  We were in and out pretty quick as most people seemed to be.  There wasn't much of a wait when we left so the line moves pretty quickly.", "author": "Violet P."}

Some of the booths face the window so I thought it'd be nice to enjoy a meal there. We were directed to sit by the island and when I made the request, was told that those were for groups of 4. Fine. It was the only 2 booths left by the window. While other booths had two's by the side of the restaurant, they weren't by the window. I didn't feel like arguing then. \n\nI picked hell ramen and was asked if I'm aware that it's spicy. I guess there are different kinds of spicy. This kind is more of an oily base so it's not like instant, but will linger. The ramen was just alright. There were a lot of meat tho, really fatty but I couldn't finish most of it. The eggs are slightly soft boiled and it somehow didn't do anything for me.\n\nThen get this: 2 people were seated by the booth that I wanted. And by the time I finished my meal, another party of 2 were seated by the window booths! WTF. Do I just have a persona of   getting rejected??! Anyway, the island in the middle of the restaurant was basically my party of two, and one other person in the corner of the island. I'm just so disappointed why they refused my request specifically but allowed others to seat in what was suppose to be reserved for parties of four. I bet those 2 two's didn't even request the booth! gah!\n\nFor the record, I like the decor. The island in the middle has succulents in the center and it looks really zen. The chopsticks and containers of peppers and spices were all made of wood. So it looks really peaceful and minimal. But you know what I'd rather like to see? The sunshine from a window seat.\n\nFor the ramen, I'm not used to this type of spice so it took me some time getting used to it.

To make a long story short: despite getting sat first out of three other parties at our communal table, our order got taken last, our food came a 30min after theirs, and our water cups sat mostly empty despite our ramen being way more spicy than normal. Although I'm normally forgiving of such situations, having been a server myself in the past, we were upset that our server there was unapologetic and didn't take any time to check in with us or to let us know our food was on its way. She must have even avoided making eye contact with us as we tried so many times to flag her down. \n\nThey did recently change their menu (or at least its format), making it clearer and easier to order what you want, but another question I have is: did the spiciness levels change as well? We consistently order the same thing (and at the same spice level) but this time it was just unbelievably hot. We had to order extra broth which also took another 10 minutes after a miscommunication with our server, and she still had nothing to say... no discount on the bill was offered either - obviously we didn't expect one but it would've been the right thing to do at a service-oriented restaurant. We still tipped the full amount, considering other staff members there were useful. \n\nI'd say this experience was almost unforgivable considering the ways the situation could have been fixed.

We were walking around Japantown and were looking for some dinner options. I actually might not have tried it because it's Yelp review is pretty mediocre, but my friend comes here pretty often and says that the line is really long so that was good enough for me.\n\nWe came around 6pm on a Sunday night and were lucky enough to only have to wait for about five minutes. When we left around 7, the line definitely was getting pretty long. \n\nI got the yamadaya tonkotsu ramen. Good stuff! Actually one of the better bowls of ramen that I've had in the area. One tricky thing that I experience with ramen is significant diminishing marginal utility when I have more and more of the bowl. With every bowl of ramen, I always think it's really delicious when I first start. With this bowl of ramen, I thought it was delicious and also managed to finish the thing without getting sick of it.\n\nNoodles are of the thin variety though you have the option of getting thick noodles for an extra fifty cents. Though I would normally go for thick, thin ones are better for soaking in the flavor of the soup. I liked the yamdaya because basically it had all your add ins done for you so you didn't need to customize anything. You can also just build your own bowl of ramen i that floats your boat. \n\nThin noodles were chewy and flavorful. Soup was rich but not too heavy which was great and also not too fatty. Yamadaya is a bit similar to Orenchi in the sense that they also do the simmering pork bones for 20 hours, but unlike the Orenchi broth, this one isn't super fatty. It's definitely on the thicker side though. Their ajitama!! It's definitely marinated in something so it gives you some nice flavor right there too which was great. The yamadaya comes with so much freaking meat. Pork belly slices, pork belly chunks oh lord, I was drowning in the pork. I didn't want that much meat so I probably should have just customized but if you like your meat, I highly recommend the yamadaya.\n \nFinal price post tip was about $14 dinner which I think is pretty decent for a good bowl of ramen. This place also has tsukemen which is really exciting to me because I haven't found many places in the Bay Area that offer tuskemen so I'll definitely be back to give that a try. The one potential con for the average person is that the portions are a bit small. I'm an Asian girl so I don't eat much, but I could see someone easily being hungry since the bowls are tiny. \n\ntldr; good ramen place in Japantown! not sure how long I would want to actually wait for it, but objectively a very solid bowl of ramen with little to complain about. come early to avoid lines!", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Like the starkly traditional ambiance with wooden fixtures and a general shadowy lighting, there is no fooling around with the ramen--every component has the dead serious precision of a Samurai (hmm, now I wonder whether Samurai ate ramen...) The tonkotsu broth is cooked for 20+ hours to an intense richness, the soft boiled egg has a runny yolk of liquid gold, and the chashu is a melty tenderness that comes from actual cooking skillz rather than fatty cuts of pork.  \n\nWhile the egg noodles were undeniably tasty with the flavorful broth, it was not as al dente/QQ as I would have liked.  Not so terrible so as to be condemned as soggy, but I much preferred the bouncy hand-pulled noodles from Shalala just across the plaza. (Perhaps it would be more al dente/QQ if I immediately began devouring the ramen as soon as it arrived, instead of letting it sit in broth while I took a picture)\n\nThe menu is more extensive than those basic places with minimalist tonkotsu/shio/shoyu options; I went for the Yamadaya ramen because a restaurant's namesake dish is typically also the signature.  Sadly, the level 3 required an additional charge, so I got the spicy level 2.  There was a dab of chili pepper, but it was definitely not spicy (if you really want a spicy ramen... like challenge level spicy, I recommend Ramen Underground's habanero ramen--it is quite an adventure)\n\nA very unique and exciting aspect of Ramen Yamadaya is the freshly pressed garlic, which you get to squeeze into your own ramen.

I tasted the Kotteri ramen without the spice and thought it was rather bland, not that rich and fatty broth you'd hope for. I had the spicy and it had more flavor but it was solely because of the spice which just comes with a lump of spice on top of the bowl (as opposed to already being mixed in) which was not really appealing at first. The egg, however, stole the show. Perfectly cooked, delicious flavor, one of the best eggs I've had in a bowl! \n\nWe were there after 9 pm on a Friday and only had a 10 minute wait after we signed in although it seemed everyone else was at least a party of 4 and had been waiting longer.

Yes, fat is flavor, but the ratio of good broth to fat was off. The master chef did not taste test the broth on Sunday afternoon. The broth was lukewarm and the yolk in the egg was still cold. I had the first spoonful of broth and couldn't believe how bland it was. And had only the second spoonful to confirm that it was not good broth, maybe the worst I'd had. The ramen noodles were thin and a bit too firm, especially since they didn't soak up the broth. Sadly, the pork belly was not very good either. I expect pork belly to have fall-apart tender texture full of flavor. This was not it. The meaty layers were a bit tough and the in-between layers of fat were slimy. Memorable but not in a good way.

Everything is very clean in the eating area, I love how they have WOODEN chopsticks. As any soupy-noodle lover knows, eating with wooden chopsticks makes all the difference in enjoying your meal versus when you're eating with plastic chopsticks. My boyfriend is not very skilled with chopsticks and he appreciates this place even more solely based on that. I also love how they play 90's music (we both grew up in the 90's)! Listening to nostalgic music while eating ramen is a pretty awesome experience :D\n\nLast night my boyfriend ordered the Shoyu (soy sauce based soup) and requested to just have the pork belly instead of tonkotsu with corn on the side and I ordered the Kotteri (black garlic oil). When our bowls came, the corn was in my boyfriend's order and he got both the tonkotsu and the pork belly. My boyfriend said the waitress didn't quite understand what he wanted and when he tried to explain she still seemed confused, hence the errors in the order. I was sorely disappointed when my ramen lacked the rich broth flavor the menu claimed and I couldn't taste any garlic flavor either. I was also saddened to see that the noodles were thin, I prefer thicker noodles. I think the Shoyu ramen also had thin noodles too.\n\nEven though we had issues with our orders, we still enjoyed our food and we will be coming back again.

The restaurant is located upstairs so don't go to the other Japanese restaurant downstairs which also has a line. We arrived Sat night around 630 and there was already a line but it does seem to move quick as the place is very big and efficient with communal tables.\nAs we sat at corner booth the menu was basically mostly Tonkatsu broth based we went for a few different Rennes with one being spicy very hot level 3 which is highest.\nThe broth is super rich and if you want the pork belly added it will be extra $3.50 which is not a bad deal considering the size of it.  Don't bother with their J pop alcoholic drink, it's very sweet and not worth the $5. I would add an egg though since you only get 1/2 an egg and it is very good. If you prefer thicker noodles you can swap for extra 50 cents.\n\nThe broth is super rich. There is a saying many people burn their mouth with this broth as it has a huge layer of fat disguising the steam coming off. So be careful not to burn yourself.\nThe ramen itself was ok, not the best nor worth waiting on line for too long.\nI prefer waraku down the street or goku in mission. \nValue 4/5\nAtmosphere 4/5\nService 4/5\nQuality 3/5\n15/20", "author": "Nina S."}

It's like I'm watching commercials as a kid again.\n\n\"Ramen may not be suitable for anyone hungry. Corn, Seaweed, and Scallion each sold separately. Batteries not included.\"\n\nlol the scallion costs an extra dollar. Inflation is real, guys.\n\nWaiting for a table can also be frustrating. Especially when you look through the windows and see the other customers taking their sweet time. But it's quite another story when you look and see empty tables inside. \n\nWe peered inside to see 3 open tables ready to sit the many parties that were starving in the waiting area. Yet, 20+ minutes late, the tables remained as empty as the pit of my ramen-less stomach.\n\nAfter trying to flag down the busy hostess for a good while (she was super busy as she also served tables and processed bills in addition to her hostess duties), she finally sat us on one of the three empty tables. If she had just asked nicely, I could've sat myself. I could've maybe even sat two other parties for her. But what do I know about efficiency? \n\nAfter ordering, we saw some literature and learned that Ramen Yamadaya simmers their broth for 20 hours. Well, that explains why it felt like 20 hours before we got our food.\n\nNo kidding. It took 10+ minutes before we even got water (waiter apologized) 20+ more minutes before our ramen came (the busy hostess kinda just flinged it on our table). \n\nIt's funny looking back at how inefficient this place was. But at that time, I was actually filled with frustration (instead of Ramen, oh the irony.) Yamadaya looked like one of those featured places from Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares. Decent food, horrible management.\n\nHonestly, if it's that 20 hour simmered broth that's causing all this trouble, then please just stick to Maruchan or maybe Shin Ramen on a more ambitious day. Also, hiring someone to help the hostess would be a good idea. Or maybe just training the hostess to see 3 empty tables would help too.\n\nCan't believe I waited all that time to pay a dollar for extra scallion.", "author": "Ringo M."}

HOW DO YOU GET THE FLAVOR IF ITS LUKEWARM?! My friend said it's because it was close to closing but I'm pretty sure an hour before closing, you should still serve good food like any other time. Why else would you charge the same price?! The flavors were gone due to how cold it was. The noodles were good in thickness. The bamboo tasted like it came out of a can (which means you did it wrong!). The egg was cold and man, how the hell do you warm up an egg in cold broth? Usually I really appreciate a place that can do a soft boiled egg the right way (which they did), but I can't appreciate it if it's cold.\nThe spicy tuna bowl was lackluster. The service mediocre (I watched a couple wait on their check for the entirety of our meal). My friend didn't even get his beer but they had the audacity to charge for it.

It was 20 minutes for 6 of us (everywhere else being a 45 minute to 1 hour wait), and they were true to their word.\n\nTHE COST: Not bad, about $20 a person for a bowl of ramen and their share of a pitcher.\n\nTHE SERVICE: Once again, efficient. But our server had a really strong accent that was difficult to understand, plus she couldn't really understand us. We had a long back-and-forth on the difference between the Tonkotsu Ramen with its set toppings and the Yamadaya Ramen, which could be the same broth and just had deluxe toppings. She basically explained the whole thing, verbatim, about 4 times (each time with that difficult-to-understand accent). 3 of those times were totally unnecessary.\n\nMUST-HAVES: The Kotteri, for sure!

While it said its a fatty broth, it was still good that was not the issue. The chasu pieces were the biggest issue.

Previous reviews comment on the dirty rag smell... But whatever the smell... It's there! So be prepared for the smell or wear a clothespin on your nose.\n\nI came here with my friend a few weeks ago, and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table mid-week at 730pm. About half the tables were occupied, so I felt it peculiar that the wait was so long since there were plenty of tables available.  Nonetheless, we were finally seated around 8pm and ordered our food. Service was decent, nothing remarkable.  \n\nI order the kotteri ramen which many people raved about in reviews. Well I've had kotteri style ramens throughout the nation, and this one was average. Kotteri refers to a rich, thick broth, which is usually made with a lot of TLC and well... Fatty pork/pork fat. The kotteri broth here was salty but a bit lacking in bold flavors, and it was not meaty or rich/thick enough for me... That is, not enough pork fat!  Also the bamboo shoots they use are really stinky. They're so stinky that they overpower the soup base.  So while the soup was on the blander spectrum of ramen souls I've had, there was a pretty potent bamboo shoot undertone with every gulp of soup.  If you like bamboo shoots, then this might be the soup for you.  If not, it might be best to hold off on the shoots or to ask for them to be put on the side so that you can add them in as per your liking.\n\nSan Francisco is a hub of different cultures with lots of variety of food choices. While there are a lot of choices for ramen in the city, in my opinion, they are just average in comparison to the better choices in the South Bay and in LA.  When I saw this place open up I was hoping that it would be just as good as the \"Ramen Yamadaya\" in LA, but this was not the case.  \n\nUnless the broth improves and the dirty bathroom rag smell goes away, I don't think I'll come here again.

They also mentioned the Ramen was good. Well...they were half right, in my humble opinion. \n\nThere was now a large communal table in the middle and more on the Ramen later. Although service was good, friendly and efficient, a lot was left to be desired about the Ramen. I ordered the Tonkotsu while the Wifey ordered the Shoyu. We also ordered the side of Pork Belly that made our mouth salivate based on the photo. While waiting for the order, we discovered that Ramen Yamadaya is a chain with the original location in Torrance, California. I had high hopes since SoCal was finally bringing some good Ramen to NorCal. AND...most of the people working here were Japanese. \n\nWhen the Pork Belly arrived, I was expecting the same cut, but what I got was this:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-yamadaya-san-francisco?select=jBK-BHblUjgJ2OgKQncnug#DAkElJzg1P-sHZ4x3TE7Jw It's a far cry from the first photo and it tasted just as bad as it looked. It was dry, overcooked and tasted like it was left marinating too long. Typically I would be asking where's the beef. In this case I was asking where's the fat?\n\nWhen our Ramen arrived and tasted the broth, it was lacking that umami flavor compared to some of the places I've visited. This broth tasted like flavored salt. The thin noodles didn't work either as the noodles are supposed to soak and retain the flavor. It just fell apart and created a messy and chewy sensation in my mouth. I tasted the Wifey's Shoyu and I got the same reaction. I don't think they cooked the noodles correctly. \n\nYou know that a good sign of a great Ramen is when a person finishes the broth.

There were only booths and small tables lining the side of the dining area that was opened up and lined with hardwood like a dance floor.  Originally, I had envisioned us taking up one of their community tables like the ones down south for the 9 of us in our party, but they didn't have the furniture in place yet and crammed us into two booths instead...\n\nFrom some of the early pics that people had posted, there was a long piece of pork belly that I was dying to try except that they didn't have enough that night and only offered a bit of it in a side dish, some separate embellishment offering extra toppings like half an egg, chasiu, menma, etc..  The Tsukemen that I had didn't seem as hardy as the one I'm used to ordering,  the dipping sauce seemed to have a different hue as well but I ate it all the same...\n\nI have heard that they had recently put in their communal table finally, but it's going to take a momentous effort for us to return to this location when were in the city as there are so many other places for us to visit and our time is precious when we visit.

If you want real black garlic oil, try going South to Ramen Dojo, Ramen Parlor, or Maru Ichi (sorry, had to name-names). \n\nThere was just nothing really special about the noodles or the soft-boiled egg at Yamadaya. I've had better of both. It's cool that the egg was soy-sauced brown on the outside, but the yolk wasn't that bright yellow color with the almost-runny-yet-not texture that I have grown to love. Any ramen shop that puts canned bamboo shoots in their ramen also gets a thumbs down from me. It just spoils the flavor of the broth in my opinion.

First, I discovered Ramen Izakaya Goku in the Mission (review: http://bit.ly/1a2YLTs) and now there's this spot. In fact, advance hype was so overwhelming that I managed to make Jamie W. do something he hates to do. Wait in line. It looked like all the sock-headed, bespectacled young hipsters already knew that this SoCal-based chain was opening in the former Iroha space since there was quite a queue on the stairs. We tried to make our way to the sign-up sheet but an army of indifferent Asian youth apparently learned their manners from Rob Ford.\n\nAll of us were gawking at the empty space in the middle of the space big enough for a Jane Fonda workout class (photo: http://bit.ly/KuwHll). Had we known, we would have brought a card table and folding chairs. I heard in passing that they were putting in communal tables, but in the meantime, we all fell victim to the owner's lack of anticipation for a rabid ramen-loving clientele. Probably a half-hour passed before we secured a booth. The menu is all about the ramen - traditional broths, a variety of toppings and plenty of sides (photo: http://bit.ly/1eDRf4k). The wait made us hungrier perhaps by design. We both ordered the $9.45 bowls of Tonkotsu Kotteri Ramen which they describe indulgently as a \"Rich and Fatty Ramen with Black Garlic Oil\" (photo: http://bit.ly/1a2Y905). Did they really need to add \"Fatty\"?\n\nWhat would have been nice to include on the menu are the standard ingredients to be found in the ramen bowl - a couple of slices of chashu pork, half of a hard-boiled egg, some scallions. We both thought it was purely a la carte, so I ended up ordering another full seasoned egg for a dollar (photo: http://bit.ly/JEYHme), some corn kernels for another dollar (photo: http://bit.ly/K0KKyB), and of course, the Kakuni pork belly for $3.50 (photo: http://bit.ly/1gBD41H). Not only did we go gluttonous with the toppings, but we both ordered four pieces of Karaage (photo: http://bit.ly/1lMakDZ) and a salad (photo: http://bit.ly/1hshPSS) for an additional $3.75. When all of it started coming out on separate plates, I felt like I was either in an Indonesian restaurant or at the Hungry Heifer, Norm Peterson's favorite place to eat on \"Cheers\".\n\nSo the verdict? The broth was indeed supremely rich, the product of twenty-plus hours of simmering we were told. The noodles were surprisingly thin, almost saimin-like with a nice al dente bite to them. The slabs of pork belly were generous to say the least. The corn was fresh and plentiful. The eggs looked to be boiled in some soy sauce-based broth judging from the amber color. Put it all together, and it's quite an abundant bowl of goodness that almost made us forget the long wait and snarky hipsters (photo: http://bit.ly/JEYXlk). Almost. Except for one lovely waitress who seemed genuinely willing to be patient with us, the wait staff was a mite pushy which I assumed reflected their need to turn over the tables quickly. Oh well, maybe the communal tables will ease their impatience a bit. But sure, for that broth, we would wait again.\n\nFOOD - 4.5 stars...quite a bowl of goodness, rich broth, toothsome noodles and plenty of pork belly at your discretion\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...felt like I should have brought a yoga mat, so at least I could have used my wait time more constructively\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...a bit hurried though they tried to hide it...sorta\nTOTAL - 4 stars...so close to five stars...will probably get there when the hype dies down and they start to use their space more efficiently", "author": "Ed U."}

The ramen itself was delicious, in my opinion. I liked the texture of the noodles a lot better than other places I've been to. Also, I finished every drop of the broth. The egg was cooked to perfection~ And the pork was delicious (flavor- and texture-wise) as well. Although the ramen didn't look to be a huge portion, it was like a never-ending bowl! I have no idea how my friend managed to finish the large size of Tsukemen, but he must have been pretty hungry, too. I definitely could have managed to take some of the ramen home instead of stuffing my face so late at night. I like that when you ask for garlic (free!), they give you gloves of it in a dish wish a garlic press. Nothing better than fresh garlic with your ramen!

We came spontaneously after a stroll around Japantown, and am I glad we came.\n\nEnvironment: 4/5\nThere's a weird awkward square in the middle of the restaurant that could definitely use more tables. Benched seating along the side, very few seats. Minimalistic. Japanese style look fitting for a Ramen shop. \n\nService: 4/5\nCOME EARLY- there was a line out the door when we showed up at 5:00PM, and shop wasn't even open yet! We were seated right away once the business opened for dinner. We were full and got the credit cards back by 6:00PM. Those unlucky people who were right behind us had to wait maybe 30-45 minutes to get seated. \n\nFood: 4.5/5\nTSUKEMEN IS A MUST ORDER! It's Japan's newest trendy dipping ramen- and both the flavor and the texture of the ramen is top notch. My brother and I ended up finishing my boyfriend's tsukemen cause it was so good.\n\nThe tonkotsu kotteri was pretty tasty- and yes, I know it's suppose to be a fatty and rich broth- but it was a little TOO oily for me. The Char sui pork is soft and rich and wonderful.", "author": "Megan Y."}

From my last visit, we were not sure whether we had got extra noodles for the boys coz we did not question it. Turns out students get extra noodles on a side plate which we did not get last time, so now we know.  Also, if you like garlic, they give you a bowl of raw garlic and you simply used the garlic masher and mash it directly into your soup...so delicious, especially when I LUV garlic.\n\nOrdered my favorite tonkatsu kotteri with black garlic oil $8.95 plus Yamadaya ramen $11.95. Both delicious as usual, oh and we sat on the wooden table in the middle of the room.  Looks like the owners chairs finally arrived.  Nice communal table, you never know who you might get chatting to.  Seems they seat all the singles and doubles there.\n\nHighly recommended ramen place.

Don't get me wrong, Katana-ya has been in SF for years, but it's not your typical tonkotsu broth.\n\nCame to Ramen Yamadaya Saturday around 12:00 p.m., there were only 2 groups ahead of us. We sat within 10-15 minutes. Not a long wait at all. However, moments after we were seated the line was LONG.  I also think it's a hazard to have people waiting along the staircase, thoughts?\n\nThe beau got the regular tonkotsu, and I got the koterri (black garlic). Both were DELICIOUS! It came with the right amount of bamaboo shoots, one piece of char siu, wood ear and half a smoked egg. The noodles were thinner than I'm used to, but had good slurpage to soup ratio, which was good. I think I liked the koterri broth more, it was more flavorful. The chasu reminded me of the same one used at Ramen Toto in NYC, except it wasn't grilled with a hand torch. \n\nWe also ordered a side of chicken karrage as the beau likes to dip them into the ramen. The chicken karrage wasn't greasy, it was moist and tender inside, wasn't overly fried and didn't have too much batter. We also ordered a side of yamada topping which was enough for us to share. Came with A LOT of green onions, two sheets of nori, extra wood ear (which I would have liked bamboo shoots instead), half an egg, and three pieces of pork (two chasu and one kakuni). \n\nThe service was slow, and it does seem like they're trying to figure out their groove. If you pay with a credit card, they use square on an iphone. They also added a communal table to the center to increase seating, which is good.\n\nI would definitely come back, but would not wait more than 15 minutes.", "author": "Vanessa K."}

It provides virtually no written detail of what each particular menu item is.  I asked the waiter what the difference was between certain ramen and he had no clue either.  What a joke...\n\nThere's no longer any instructions on how to order spice levels in the ramen.  You have to already know that there are six levels of spiciness.  Why you would go beyond level two is baffling to me since it starts to no longer taste like anything except a ghost pepper with weird textures.\n\nThe 10-pc Chicken Karaage is a great deal.  The batter is crispy and the chicken is juicy.\n\nThe Fried Octopus Balls are pretty damn good too.\n\nThey changed the shape of the ramen bowls, so it's meant to look just as tall and wide, but you actually get less broth than before since it funnels down more narrowly.  Nice try on the skimp!\n\nI usually order the Shio broth and it does taste good, but the pork slices you get are either all fatty fat, or thick dry chewiness.\n\nThe noodles they serve in the ramen bowls are not actually real ramen noodles.  They're a thinner, inferior, and unsuitable version of noodles.  If the noodles were awesome, it would have saved the whole dish from being a major disappointment.\n\nOverall, this place has nothing worth it for me to come back to and it is probably the last time I eat here.\n\nThe best place IMO within this block radius is Waraku Ramen.  They don't skimp on the amount of tasty broth and I really enjoy their ramen noodles.  Go there instead; it's much better!  \n\nThere is better ramen elsewhere if you're willing to look outside of Japantown.\n\nJ", "author": "John M."}

A direct quote from the staff when questioned about it: \"It is vegetarian, it's all vegetables with a little fish.\"\n\nAlso, unlike other restaurants in Japantown, they do not validate parking.\n\nDue to the plentiful other options, I think I'll start steering clear of this chain entirely.", "author": "Shigeki M."}

Some places Know whats up and some places are just sort of going thru the motions. I have found some that are great when they first open only to have the service, quality and attention to detail fall off dramatically. Then a few places are fine on some days but otherwise are inconsistent over the course of time. \nThat being said I hope Yamadaya can stand up to the test of time. The location they took up would indicate they are totally committed. The vibe is great when its busy. They have a wide open main dinning space that is very comfortable.\nThe service is fast but not at all rushed. While they might forget things or miss a few steps they more than make up for it. It's still brand new in San Francisco they have been in L.A. for some time. \n\nThe noodles are not the best I have ever had, but they compliment the broth very well. The spicy tonkatsu broth is great and not overly salty. The cuts of meat are not stingy at all and the pork belly is huge. HUGE! Adding garlic is a must for most as it is free, I could go either way, I don't feel like it adds much to what they put in front of you. It comes as a very well balanced bowl of ramen, perfect just the way it is, with pork belly added.\n\nThe Ramen is the highlight here, its really good. In addition to the ramen I also had the Takoyaki and the spicy tuna. The Takoyaki was great! The spicy tuna I would not order again, it was good but unnecessary and a very small portion.", "author": "Ben M."}

It wasn't great but I wouldn't say it was exactly bad. I had ordered their Kara-age Shoyou Ramen and it was pretty mediocre. The broth was okay, a tad on the salty end, quite greasy and warm... just warm. The toppings in the ramen weren't even all that heated. The chicken and the 1/2 soft-boiled egg were close to cold. I had also bitten into a few egg shells!\nA few of my friends had ordered ramen and experienced similar things: cold toppings and broth. One of them said that it seemed as if their noodles weren't defrosted all the way through or something. \nOn the brighter-side, another couple of my friends had ordered something different: a Tonkatsu Curry and a Tori Kara-age Bento, which were pretty good compared to the ramen.\nAlthough the food wasn't the best, the service was quite nice. Our servers were kind, but everything seemed a bit unorganized and inefficient. When we ordered, it seemed as if our server didn't know anything on the menu. Our food came out way longer than we expected. We saw a couple groups of people who came after us receive their food before us and left. Oh and we were left with a utensil that didn't look like it was washed thoroughly (i.e. there was still green onion and the remains of a smudge of brown sauce on it).

So, if you're lucky enough to get the back corner of the restaurant, you'll see the whole town from that one spot.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice as well. Pretty chill, they play some good late 1990s/ early 2000s music. It can be quiet when they're not as busy, but very vocal when they are.\n\nFor the ramen, they're great. Beyond what I was expecting! Pretty much, the broth is smooth and tasty enough to finish drinking, with enough noodles and meat to balance out the meal. It's not too salty, and it's pretty hearty. You get the eggs, seaweed, and meat, with your soup. For the price, it's agreeable. Not too expensive, but I feel that if it's at $10, it would be perfect.\n\nI've been here two times, and the wait isn't usually that bad if you have a party of two to four (maybe around 5 to 20 minutes).

However, it seems they might've changed their noodles since my last visit.

The noodles they served last Saturday were still thin, although curly this time (like actual instant ramen) and did not carry any flavors...I'm not one to drink the broth so my meal ended up pretty tasteless. I don't know if they cook different noodles on different days but, alas....disappointment. \n\nOn another note, the service is usually a miss. One of the female waitresses (she's been there for awhile now) must be really unhappy to be working there. Exchanging a few words would be good for communication's sake.

Hence, a four-star review from me.\n\nYamadaya is located on the second floor above a shabu place, so it's a little hard to find the door, but once you do, take the stairs up and get your name on the waitlist. They are pretty efficient about going through the waitlist and getting you through the door as soon as they can, but it can still be a bit of a wait during busy hours.\n\nThe menu at Yamadaya is really confusing because they try to explain all of the different possible combinations of ramen you can order on a sheet of paper. If you're not interested in trying to parse the menu, my suggestion would be to just order the Yamadaya Tonkotsu Kotteri (black garlic soup base) and be done with it. If you're in a spicy mood, get the Yamadaya Spicy Tonkotsu (same as before, but spicy). If you're really into garlic, order some free fresh garlic to go with your ramen. It's fun to use the garlic smasher, and it tastes really good!\n\nHere's the breakdown on the ramen:\n1. Soup - Very flavorful without being too salty, which is exactly how I like it. Doesn't leave you feeling horribly thirsty after your meal.\n2. Noodles - Thin and chewy and delicious, but not particularly amazing.\n3. Meat - The pork belly is delicious, but they're pretty stingy about how much they give you (just one piece!). Same goes for the chashu pork.\n4. Egg - Perfectly soft-boiled, yes!\n5. Other - Seaweed, bamboo shoots, green onions: pretty standard.\n\nAll in all, Yamadaya is a pretty solid bowl of ramen. The prices are a bit high ($10-$13) which I suspect is due to the great location. As far as ramen in San Francisco goes, this is one of the best you can get, and probably one of the few actually Japanese places in Japantown that I'd recommend.", "author": "Brittany C."}

Both with thick noodles. Also some wine and beer but that's a given.\n\nJason happily munched away at the potstickers and salad while I observed how sad the wine pour was.... For $7, I would expect the small glass to be at least 1/3 full if not more.\n\nAs I waited for my ramen, I looked to my left at the window sill....that was accumulating inches of dust and spiderwebs. Gross...health code violation(s)?\n\nVegan ramen took longer so I stole some of the tsukemen noodles. We were halfway done when my bowl finally came out.......yet it was the thin noodles. The waitress seemed rushed the first time I ordered, so it was understandable that she may have written the order down incorrectly. I try to catch her eye and finally get her attention. I point out the error and.....no apologies given - she literally just frowned and said OK and then took it away.\n\nJason and I then see her and her colleagues rummaging through the trash, looking for something...perhaps the piece of paper with my order....? They never washed their hands....We watched.\n\n15 minutes later, I see the waitress head towards our table, and I was starving by this point so I'm superduper excited. She sets down the bowl and I dip my spoon in and take my chopsticks to grab....the same thin noodles again. How. Is. This. Possible.\n\nI again try to flag someone down and I politely point this out, as it's kind of hilarious at this point.

At least offer the location of the nearest ATM or walk over to talk to that customer privately. How can you be so incredibly rude?!?? \n\nWorst part is that she still charged me for the ramen I never ate (and charged me an extra $1.50 for the thin noodles). When I asked, apparently she was doing me a favor since thick noodles are $2.00 extra. I must have looked confused because she then yelled at me and told me not to pay if I didn't want to. I would have rather paid an extra 50 cents to get the ramen THAT I ORDERED.\n\nSpeechless.\n\nWe paid $40 for our meal - $13.00 of which was pretty much untouched ramen.

Starving, tired, and hopeful of a satisfying meal, we quickly ordered. \n\nThe first thing we noticed was that our server seemed to be having a bad day as he was stand-offish and all but slammed our cups of ice on our table but no matter, we were there for the food.\n\nMy table all ordered their usual, a Yamadaya Ramen with tonkatsu kotteri, large portion of thin noodle, and fresh garlic. Unlike other places that serve garlic on the peninsula, Ramen Yamadaya literally gives you fresh cloves of garlic and a garlic press to mash to your own liking. Their Yamadaya Ramen is like their deluxe option with two types of meat and 3 sheets of seaweed.\n\nThe ramen itself, to me was not up to my liking. While I've never had ramen from Japan or frequented to so-called 'authentic' ramen places in the US, I felt that the ramen had many qualities that I disliked. The broth itself was flavorful but SO very thick. The thin noodles weren't chewy at all and seemed like they were purposed to soak up the grease from the broth as opposed to being a noodle in a noodle dish. The charshu was thick like a piece of toast at not at all tender or flavorful. The pork belly pieces and soft boiled egg were delicious though. \n\nFor a 13 dollar bowl of ramen, I expected a lot more. If you're used to, and favor ramen from the likes of Ramen Dojo, Ramen Parlor, or Kotetsu, you will find that they are not at all similar and may walk away unsatisfied. If, however, you are into the type of ramen that is thick ,greasy, and in a word heavy, this is your place!", "author": "Christopher L."}

We patiently waited for our server to notice our waving, and had to wait about 10-15 minutes before they even attended our table. The wait for the ramen was exceptionally long (20-30 minutes), considering that I've been to plenty of other popular ramen shops in the Bay Area and the wait time for ramen is typically around 10 minutes long. \n\nWe started with the octopus takoyaki balls which came steaming hot. After biting into the takoyaki, it seemed that 85% of the ball was dough and 15% was octopus. The dough itself was good, but it also seemed as if it wasn't cooked fully as the takoyaki dough was a bit too mushy for my taste. Overall, I would still order again. \n\nThe Tonkotsu Kotteri with thicker noodles came in a large bowl with a beautiful proportion of soup to noodle ratio. I wasn't particularly a fan of the toppings which included bamboo shoots, mushrooms, some odd crunchy almond-looking pieces that ended up being too spicy for my taste, green onions, and a semi-soft-hard boiled egg. The pork was soft and fatty, and complemented the soup well, which was a good balance of flavour and thickness/creaminess. While I found the broth the most satisfying part of the bowl, the layer of oil was a bit disconcerting. No one wants to eat ramen and consciously realise that they are eating a load of fat! I found the thicker noodles too limp for my taste, but prefer them much more to the thinner noodles which I prefer for lighter noodle dishes such as pho or soba. \n\nOverall, the food was more than mediocre and I didn't leave disappointed in the food, but more with the service, or lack of. We had to ask for water multiple times, flag down the multiple waiters for a check, and then finally had to go up to the cash register to receive our check. The food took too long to make, and everyone knows that ramen is more of a machinated meal. It seemed that the waiters were too occupied with whatever they were busy sorting out at the cash register, than the customers.

I waited about half an hour before I got seated, then ordered the Tsukemen ramen with a side of menma, corn and mushrooms and a potato salad.\n\nPros:\n- Menma was super yummy, had a little sour/limey kick to it, unlike menma I've had at other places,\n- Ramen and corn was good\n- Good service, we had two people checking on us often and were happy to get us anything else we needed\n\nCons:\n- Broth was way too salty \n\nThe potato salad was interesting. I don't think I've had it the same way at other restaurants before. They had two scoops of potato (just potato) on one side of a dish and the salad w/ vinaigrette on the other side. Normally, I see the potato mixed in with the salad or something lolol. The potato salad was tasty though, just different.", "author": "Vy T."}

However, what I experienced tonight, completely blew my mind and greatly disappointed me. I will never be coming back again.\nMy mom and I decided to have dinner here, as we had just finished walking around Japantown. I knew the food was ok, had it only once so I decided to give it another shot. The wait time wasn't too bad, ~20 minutes for a party of two, with I'd say eight parties ahead of us, that was fair game in my opinion. We were sat down, the manager had to inform the waiter we had been seated and were ready to have our order taken down. I just got the regular shoyu ramen dish, however my mom is a vegetarian, but they did have a dish for vegetarians, there were no signs of difficulty. \nAfter we ordered, we were using our phones, looking at the restaurant, 10, 20 minutes went by, we were wondering where our food went. Normally, it doesn't take that long, or if it does, usually the waiter/waitress would have the courtesy of letting us know our food was almost done, and it would be served shortly, within a few minutes. Our server didn't even come by and let us know. What makes it even worse, the two tables to the left and right of us, already did one rotation of customers, and the second party of each table, even got their food and drinks, yet we were still waiting on our food. At this point, both my mom and I were very angry.\nWe called the waiter over, and they said it was taking such a long time because they had to make vegetarian broth. Please, we know how to cook, it doesn't take that long to make vegetarian broth. Then, I took it to the manager, even then, he gave me the same, unacceptable reason, with no sense of seemingly apologetic. \nOur food finally arrived, ten minutes after my brief talk with the manager, they made my mom's dish horribly (one of the factors, seemed like they didn't even rinse the noodles in cold water, it was in a huge lump), my broth tasted bland, even my noodles weren't to my satisfaction.\nBottom line is, don't come here. Horrible customer service, food isn't even good. If you're searching for an actual decent ramen place, this isn't the place to go. There are a bunch of other ramen restaurants in the bay, I'd much rather go to Ryowa in Castro, Downtown Mountain View, and we would have went there if we weren't so hungry.", "author": "Hannibal C."}

We arrived around 6 on a Tuesday night and there was still plenty of seating..in fact we scored the last window seat.  I like how they have a wide variety on their menu.  They even have a vegan ramen option.  Our waitress even explained to us all the toppings and popular choices.  It was a tough decision but I decided on the Tonkatsu Kotteri ($9.45), he got the Ramen Yamadaya ($11.45) with the tonkatsu kotteri broth and we shared an order of the chicken karaage ($6.95) as well. \n\nOur food was served to us quickly with the karaage coming out first.  It was 10 pieces of fried chicken goodness.  The pieces were big and plump and juicy.  It was fried well and not greasy either.  The dipping sauce was like a faint mayo.  We liked the side cabbage salad with an asian vinaigrette dressing.   Next came our bowls of ramen, they aren't the huge bowls that some places serve or once served, but the portion was just right.  His toppings came on a side dish.  I'm glad I asked for the free garlic topping as well.  They gave us cloves of garlic and the press.  We love our garlic!  The tonkatsu kotteri is a rich tonkatsu broth with black garlic oil.  It was full bodied with the pork flavor, and I did taste the garlic as well, but wanted a more prominent garlic flavor so I pressed one clove into my broth.  Made it even better!  The toppings of mine included the bamboo shoots, half an egg, the mushrooms, green onions and one slice of cha shu.  The Cha Su was slightly thicker but it had a great soy marinated flavor and was tender.  Noodles were al dente.  His toppings were the same with the addition of a nice size slice of pork belly.  The pork belly had a good meat to fat ratio and tasted like it was braised, fairly tender as well.  Both of our noodles were the thinner style (I think it's the Hakata style).  I believe there's at least one ramen item on the menu where it includes the traditional thicker noodle at no extra cost, otherwise it's 50 cents extra.  Although tonkatsu broth is to be thick and rich, it was a little thick for his liking; I loved it but I felt a little \"jai' (my fellow Cantonese know what that means) later that night.  I can tell that a lot of time and love goes into their broths and meats.  \n\nFood came out without much of a wait, place was clean and had simple mod decor.  The service was very attentive, friendly and helpful as well.  He likes Ramen Izakaya Kagura the most in San Mateo (part of the Men Oh and nearby J-Town Ramen Waraku Group).  I'm actually torn because I love both Ramen Izakaya Kagura and Ramen Yamadaya.  I would say out of all the other traditional ramen places in SF that I've been to: Waraku, Men Oh, Sozai, Izakaya Sozai, Sawaii, that Ramen Yamadaya is the best.  I do absolutely love the ramen at Kaiju Eats though, but that's more of a fusion style.  It's a tough choice, but I think I'll have to give Ramen Yamadya a 4.5 for now.  Hopefully I can give an update soon with a 5.", "author": "Cat C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-07", "description": "Pros: Vegan ramen right on the menu, fresh garlic and a press given to you so you can add as much as you want yourself, a decent range of ramens, toppings, and other types of food. I also like the really large communal table and they seat you well around it so you're not really grouped up with strangers too much. If you prefer something a little less cozy with people you don't know, you can request a table (but you'll wait longer probably).\n\nCons? Service was pretty bad. We watched the two guys across from us get the incorrect food brought to their table three times before they finally got what they'd ordered. We sat there for almost 15 minutes before our ramens came out and we watched two other people get their orders before us despite it looking more complicated than noodles and soup and being seated after us. Seriously, it's noodles and broth and vegetables, it's not that hard to slap together and get out in under 10 minutes (and the place wasn't even that busy to warrant such a delay). Aside from having our food not delivered in a timely manner (and actually also brought out separately with about 2 minutes between my partner's food and mine), the waitress was on top of everything else (garlic delivery, water refills, check). \n\nThe ramen is pretty good here and I really liked the broth. Noodles weren't the best I've had but they have some variation such as spinach and thick (if you swing that way). I felt like the portion size was a bit smaller than some other places, but it was good enough for me. \n\nOverall the food was good, but the service needs a lot of work (loss of one star for that).", "author": "Cassandra J."}

For about $4 more, you get a side of gyoza, kara-age, etc. and salad/rice. Solid, solid deal, especially because we went for just one combo of kara-age and salad, and it was good enough for two people. What I like about their ramen is that the noodles don't lose their springy consistency even though they're not traditional ramen noodles. They also stack your ramen high with scallions, two types of pork, bamboo shoots, and seaweed. However, the noodle portion is smaller. For $14, sure, I can taste that I'm getting fresh pork, the way mom would make it, but my noodle portion is tiny. When my girl and I go to Yummy Yummy and order pho (of similar size), I can slurp noodles for days. My bowl for the ramen was large, but the portions weren't. The broth itself was also just mediocre.

The soup base is very rich, creamy, and flavorful while it's not very salty (I was able to drink the soup after finishing the ramen). There's also a lot of meats in the bowl, not just a few thin slices of pork. The ramen noodle itself is average, nothing much special, it's like the 'angle hair' type of ramen. I would still give the ramen itself a 5 star! Minus one point because of the service. Our server gave us an attitude, and it feels like she hated her job. And she never came to check on us. About the environment, I love the center table where there is a terrarium in the middle. But there were many people waiting outside for a table while there's a lot of seats available inside, I guess probably there's not enough kitchen staff??

Each bowl of ramen comes with half a soft boiled egg, bamboo, chashu, green onion, and seaweed. If you want a full soft boiled egg, more chashu, and kakuni (pork belly), then ask for the yamadaya topping, which is about $3 more. \n\nI got the spicy tonkotsu (level 1...okay I'm weak haha) with yamadaya topping, and my bf got the tonkotsu kotteri (fattier broth) with yamadaya topping. The spicy level 1 was the perfect amount of heat for me - not too much to where I'm struggling to eat, but still enough of a kick to add extra flavor to an already very flavorful, creamy broth. Noodles were cooked just past al dente, which was perfect for me.\n\nThey're also really generous with the chashu - we both got 4 thick pieces. The kakuni was pretty inconsistent, though - I got a huge piece but it was literally all fat. The other toppings were all fresh and well prepared (esp the soft boiled egg!).\n\nService (5/5): Our server was really patient in explaining the menu to us and making sure we knew what to order. Our food came out pretty quickly, and our waters were refilled often!\n\nValue (4/5): The ramen is really well priced for being in the city. It's not as big of a portion as some other places, but one bowl is definitely filling enough. For two of us, the bill was about $30, which I think is totally reasonable for SF ramen.", "author": "Abby S."}

Wasted! \n\nThe service was meh... I was curious about the difference between their signature yamadaya ramen and the normal ramen with different flavors. The waitress tried to explain it to us, but she spoke very fast and with a strong Japanese accent that we couldnt really understand her. When we tried to clarify, she didnt let us interrupt her and told us to wait while she continued her long unintelligible explanation.\n\nI had the spicy miso ramen (level 2). It definitely packed the heat. This, coupled with the rather warm restaurant made it rather uncomfortable to enjoy the ramen. Nonetheless, while the broth was tasty, the noodles were rather subpar. I was hoping for springy chewy noodles, and this was definitely not that.\n\nThe fatty ramen with garlic oil broth was really good, but it was, as the name suggests, super fatty. There was so much oil in it that it is impossible not to feel guilty for eating it.\n\nProbably would not return again since there's many other awesome ramen joints around.", "author": "Christina N."}

Only thing I do not like is the thin ramen noodles. Those come standard so if you're like me and you prefer the thicker, al dente ones, ask for them. I believe it costs a little extra too. However, if you go for tsukemen (dipping ramen) it comes with the thicker noodles already. \n\nFor those that don't know what tsukemen is, continue reading. The hot broth comes separate from your bowl of cold noodles. Your toppings are on top of the dry noodles. Grab a few strands of noodles and dip it into the broth for however long you like. \nLove the tsukemen. Pretty damn good, although the broth was a bit overly salty. Still, they're one of the few handful of joints that do this. The difference is that Yamadaya executes it better. \n\nI'm a fan of the tonkotsu kotteri ramen. Pork bone broth with a bit of extra pork fat and black garlic oil. Robust, rich, thick, fatty, savory. Definitely order it with the thicker noodles (the thin ones tend to break apart quick) and ask for a side of fresh garlic (free). Press a clove or two of fresh garlic into your bowl, stir it up, and enjoy! The added fresh garlic just gives the broth a little bit more OOMPH! a little extra umami ;)\n\nSkip the takoyaki and gyoza.

Would Ramen Yamadaya be the first Japantown ramen to appease me? Mostly, yeah!\n\nOrdered myself the Tonkotsu Kotteri style ramen. Probably had the thickest broth that I've ever seen in a ramen. So thick that it starts to kind of coagulate on the surface if you let it sit for a bit. Good taste to the broth though, which is the most important thing. Noodles were a bit of a shocker though. They resembled glass noodles more than regular ramen noodles. Like, they were perfectly straight like hair, and almost as skinny! Nothing wrong with the taste at all but it was totally weird to pull up pho style noodles when eating ramen. \n\nThere are however, two huge problems that I cannot overlook. The only problem taste-wise is with their Chashu pork, and it's literally the only thing holding it back from being up there in the ranks of my favorite ramen restaurants. It was slightly dry and chewy, and there wasn't much flavor at all. Also, with the Kotteri style ramen, they literally pour a top layer of oil on top of your ramen, and it just seems like the most unhealthy thing ever. Like, there was literally a layer of grease in my mouth that would not go away for the longest time. \n\nIntangibles were alright. Restaurant was super hot. Like crack a window open or something! Kind of an awkward big rectangular common table in the middle of the restaurant. Have fun facing some random people that hopefully have good etiquette.

The ramen was average I'd say. For Tsukemen, I was eager to try it since I just got one in Tokyo and was super impressed. There were bamboo shoots and half a soft boiled egg in the broth. Two options: 7oz or 14oz noodles, 7oz the normal portion. The noodles were pretty good and chewy, but the broth was somewhat disappointing. The broth in Tokyo was thicker (it was pretty like soup here), more fish paste based, and not as salty. But I know SF is no Tokyo! Probably will just get ramen next time.", "author": "Jaclyn C."}

The broth is so rich and thick that the soup spoon literally stands up in it. Amazing, sweet liquid. I am going to pour all 2000 calories of scalding hot broth down my throat. \n\nPlus I ordered the fatty tonkatsu version! The fatty pork is melt-in-your-mouth, accompanied by the crunchy mushrooms, the seaweed and the seasoned egg. And of course, noodles! I tend to like thicker, crunchier, more al dente noodles.

I'd like to think of myself as a spice enthusiast, but hot damn, it's spicy. I ordered the Yamadaya ramen, fire spicy, which the waiter described is level 4. Regular spicy is levels 1-3, \"fire\" is level 4, \"hell\" is 5, and \"death\" is 6. So I'm thinking... alright, I always add more chili oil and pepper flakes into my \"spicy\" ramen so I should be able to take level 4, fire. The waiter asked if I was sure and I said, hell yes. What he forgot to mention is that the spice is made from ghost chili peppers....and that's a whole 'nother level, my friends. Tried so hard but about 1/3 way through, I had to order a bowl of regular broth for $4 to dilute it out. Another $4 to be able to finish and enjoy my ramen? I'll take it. Aside from that, the broth was super rich, which filled me up quickly. The Yamadaya ramen comes with a thick cut of pork that was really tender. I'll definitely come back and try the other options.", "author": "Thao T."}

The Yamadaya Ramen. You get to pick the broth you want, and I picked the Tonkotsu broth which according to the sign that was outside, they cook it for 20 hours! It also comes with a soft-boiled egg, seaweed, and a lot of pork (including pork belly!). The noodles are the long, thin, straighter kind of ramen. It was yummy!!! Really hit the spot. \n\nThe place is upstairs and the entrance is kind of hard to find. They close at 9 on Fridays and we showed up like at 845 when we wrote down our names but they still seated us, which was great. The waitress told us that the other day they had to close at 7 because they ran out of broth! Come here early to make sure you don't miss out on ramen.

It still blows my mind that people consider Ramen Dojo the best ramen in the Bay. \n\nI first tried Yamadaya in LA when I asked my Japanese managers for good ramen recommendations in the Torrance area. Yamadaya received their stamp of approval so of course I went to check it out. Conclusion? Amazing. \n\nThe tonkotsu here has a tasty rich broth with a savory pork flavor. They do a great job of balancing out the creaminess of the broth without making it too heavy and oily.  I'm also a big fan of the thin straight noodles here as opposed to the thicker wavy noodles similar to the ones you sometimes find in the cheap packages of instant noodles. Thin noodles don't tend to get soggy in the hot broth and maintain their al dente texture. \n\nAside from the broth and noodles, I always judge a bowl of ramen by how well they execute on the tamago egg and chashu. The egg at Yamadaya is perfectly soft boiled with a creamy yolk though the chashu could use some work. \n\nOh, and you must get the FREE fresh garlic to press into your broth. You won't regret it. \n\nOverall, a very solid bowl of ramen. It's a little pricey at almost $10 for a small bowl and only 1 slice of cha siu, but considering it's in the heart of Japantown, it's forgivable.

I did not expect half of my bowl to be filled with green onions, it was pretty horrific. There was about 1 tiny piece of pork that I found towards the end of my meal in which I screamed with surprise/glee. Yes the ramen I ordered is supposed to be flavored with the spicy onions, but does it really have to be half the bowl worth with barely any meat?!  I was not pleased with my noodles, didn't taste memorable or anything special at all. I powered through my bowl in less than 10 minutes and had to steal some of my bf's noodles. As for the spicy miso broth, I really cannot remember anything special with the broth besides the green onion taste... The only good thing that we got from the meal was the additional $3 or so for a side dish. My friend had curry along with his ramen, which was a pretty good steal. \n\nWe ordered the karange, fried chicken, for the group which was pretty good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-06-19", "description": "This ramen is served in really fun upside town triangle bowls! Anyhow, to put it bluntly, this is some incredibly overpriced ramen that tastes just kind of okay compared to a lot of amazing ramen I've had in the bay area. I do like that they have more limited ramen choices than usual - it makes choosing easier.\n\nI had the Yamadaya Tonkatsu Kotteri, and my boyfriend had the Yamadaya Tonkatsu Spicy. These ramen are $13 each - whoa! Their kakuni ramen are about $14 each, which seems fair because usually there's a lot more of an upcharge when you order kakuni in addition to standard ramen. When I looked around the menu for cheaper ramen, I noticed there was a small section called \"basic ramen\" or something. So then, I got service that was a bit confusing. I didn't want the premium toppings that came with their \"Yamadaya\" styled ramen, so I asked about the basic ramen - my boyfriend mainly wanted basic ramen, which you know, is the ramen, some meat, some green onions - wouldn't even complain if there wasn't much more than that! But, we were told that the \"basic ramen\" they offer are JUST broth and noodles. Uhh... That is literally a first time, and one of the weirdest things I've heard offered on a menu, and from a well traversed Japanese ramen house, no less. Anyways, that sort of forced us to get the Yamadaya styled ramen, which includes pork belly, chashu, eggs (they actually mean one egg sliced in half), bamboo shoots, nori (three square sheets of seaweed), and the brown-black strippy mushroom.\n\nThe kotteri is richer soup flavored with black garlic oil, but I didn't seem to taste or see that - sort of just looked like soy sauce oil floating in a random patch, when I'm used to almost the entire bowl being kind of black with some garlic bits around, haha. The pork belly was extremely rich and fat and I enjoyed it; the chashu was slightly fatty and okay, and the eggs were a bit cold but had a nice semi solid but runny yolk. The amount of green onions was generous, but overall the ramen was okay, but still so damn expensive. The spicy broth was pretty good and orange while not being too intense, and I think I enjoyed it a bit more than other spicy broths I've had. The noodles were \"Hakana\" style, which means they are thinner; they were not my steez, no, but whatever - just a bit of a textural and form difference when you eat, and lack of nice and thick firm noodles. Sort of made me think about instant noodles. The ramen filled me up but not my boyfriend (probably because I ate most of his fat pork belly piece).\n\nIn conclusion, the ramen here is good but not the best, but I really don't like this place because of the price and how they do not include just regular ramen on the menu. I don't want the premium topping sometimes; I just want to taste the broth and even have a small slice of chashu and green onions. Unbelievable they wouldn't just have that on the menu now; it seems like they used to, but no longer do. They also have kind of aggressive ramen rules posted up front when you walk in, which come off as more rude than hip and cool.", "author": "Amy Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-15", "description": "In the world of Asian soup noodles, ramen is below both pho and Taiwanese beef noodles in my mind. No matter how much the ramen is hyped up, I can't get over the fact that, to me at least, it's essentially a deluxe version of instant noodles. Don't get me wrong- I love instant noodles from time to time (if my stomach allows for it), but that makes me think \"why would I eat ramen when I can have pho or TWB, which I can't make at home\". \n\nWith that mindset in tow, my fiancee wanted to have some form of soup for dinner because it was a \"cold\" summer night in SF (it hovered around 13 degrees Celsius). With our hotel in the center of Japantown, we were presented with a good opportunity to try some ramen steps from our hotel. Having walked past the restaurant in the days before, we decided to pay a visit to Ramen Yamadaya for a late dinner. \n\nAfter a trip up the stairs and a 10 minute wait for a table, we were brought to our seats. The restaurant has booths along 2 of the 4 walls, with the 3rd wall and middle area lined with tables of sizes for 2, 4 and a long table for bigger parties. After a quick gander at the menu, my fiancee decided to try their new special, which was a shoyu-broth ramen with pork belly, BBQ pork, and a mountain of vegetables. I went with what I think was a tonkotsu ramen with 2 meats. \n\nFor the special, they weren't lying about the mountain of veggies. it literally was a mountain peak of bean sprouts, suey choy, and lettuce on top of the ramen. Without my help, it probably would've been a messy affair trying to get to the soup underneath. As for the soup itself, Yamadaya claims to boil and prep their soup for 20 hours prior to serving. In both cases, the broth was rich and had some depth. It was definitely soothing and comforting given the temperature outside. Their BBQ pork was top-notch, while their pork belly in both soups were more fat than belly. While this added to the richness of the broth, my fiancee and I both left our belly portions unfinished. \n\nHaving tried a few ramen places in Vancouver, I had a certain expectation with respect to the noodles. To my surprise, the noodles at Yamadaya were thin. Not quite as thin as you'd find in an instant noodle package, but a noticeable difference from what i was accustomed to and what I thought was normal. Now I'm not a huge ramen fan so perhaps I have it all wrong, but I do prefer a \"beefier\" noodle in my ramen. While thin, the noodle did have some bite and wasn't a mushy mess so it wasn't as bad as I had originally feared. \n\nOverall, it was a good bowl of ramen for a normal price. Since we opted for specials, the prices were north of $10. Their normal bowls are in line with what you'd expect for Asian noodles, so the pricing to me is just fine.", "author": "Vincent A."}

They could have fit an entire second row of tables and chairs in there but for some reason they haven't taken advantage of all the space.... hopefully they will do so soon.\n\nAnyway we both ordered the tonkotsu ramen, and my BF ordered the Yamadaya topping: two pieces of chashu extra, a hunk of pork belly, green onion, nori, half an egg and bamboo shoots. It took 10-15 minutes for our order to arrive but that wasn't too bad since only two people were working the kitchen. Don't forget to order the free garlic so you can press it fresh into your ramen! So yum. The broth was very good here, it was salty, tasty, creamy but not overpowering in any of those categories. They add a good amount of green onion, a thick slice of chashu, too many bamboo shoots (not really a fan), and a perfectly soft-boiled egg. DELICIOUS!

Located on the second floor, the entrance was somewhat tucked away, but the interior was nicely furnished and comfortable. It was foggy and quite gloomy outside, so the warmth was readily welcomed by us all.\n\nThe host greeted us with all smiles and our party of 5 was seated quite quickly by the window. Being on the second floor, we got a nice view of Peace Plaza and the pedestrian street-semi-garden area below. I could only imagine what it would look like had the weather been better! The tables are all on a sort of platform, so that was pretty cool too.\n\nI got the spicy tonkatsu ramen. The menu was a sort of pick-and-choose style, but it doesn't mention that it already comes with some chashu pork, seaweed, an egg, and some other standard toppings. I think I'm used to the thick noodles as default in ramen, as the standard ones are thinner than I expected!\n\nThe soup base was really good. The noodles were good too. Overall I really enjoyed it - the spiciness wasn't as spicy as enthusiasts would like, but it had a good kick to it and compliments the flavor. I guess the portion was a bit smaller than I expected, but it was still filling! I will drop by again in the future!", "author": "Alex W."}

The restaurant still feels a bit incomplete due to a completely open floor and other than the ramen, the rest of the menu isn't ready yet.\n\nTONKATSU RAMEN with BLACK GARLIC OIL - I'm not quite sure what the black garlic is supposed to taste like but it was great ramen.  The broth was meaty but not too fatty and there 2 decent sized pieces of pork (one was beneath everything, so it was a pleasant surprise at the end).\n\nYAMADYA TOPPING - It's a bit of all the toppings, so I was just expecting not much because it was only $2.50. But when that plate came out, I knew I made a good decision! Extra Chasu, extra pork belly, extra egg! All of it was flavorful and made the ramen extra nice.\n\nIn the end, it was a little pricey for ramen, but it will no doubt be my ramen go-to from now on!

However, I'm determined to not let that stop me from trying out all different types of cuisines. I WILL NOT BE LEFT OUT OF THE RAMEN WORLD!\n\nCame here for dinner last night with a friend. I was pleasantly surprised that they had a specific vegan ramen dish listed on their menu! The folks at Ramen Yamadaya had come up with a soy milk broth recipe and substituted spinach noodles in the place of their normal egg noodles - so cool and sensitive to the hipster dietary needs of SF. My little vegetarian heart melted.  \n\nAnother disclaimer: we arrived around 9 pm on a Tuesday night. It took about 20 minutes to seat us. I too was surprised by the busyness, but took it as a positive sign. After waiting around another 20 minutes once we put in our order, our waitress came back and said that they had SOLD OUT OF THE VEGAN RAMEN! That was the only thing I could have on the menu...\n\nMy friend and I were seriously starving at this point, so I just resigned myself to having dessert (mochi ice cream) for dinner. The sweet waitress felt so sheepish about the situation but quickly rectified it. She noticed that I had ordered an egg side dish (thus hinting at my vegetarian-ness - I CAN eat egg!!) and quickly told me that they have the broth but no spinach noodles. She asked if it would be fine to replace the spinach with egg noodles. I said YES! And thus, my ramen was served.\n\nOverall, service was great for being so late at night and a busy day. Still only giving 3 stars because my vegetarian ramen was light on the veggies with only corn, a couple of bamboo shoots, spring onions, and a few slices of mushroom. Was hoping for a little more since there was no meat in it. It was overall decent but not INCREDIBLE. Also, I'm pretty sure the mochi was the Trader Joes kind.

We thought \"what the hell, let's give it a try.\"\n\nWalked up the stairs and was seated promptly at the middle communal table.   I didn't mind it at all.  Heck, I'm on vacation so I'll eat on the sidewalk if I have to.  \n\nStarters:\n\nTakoyaki - This is a must when my daughter is with me.  They came up piping hot but delicious! Nothing special about them, just your typical takoyaki.\n\nGyoza - Like the takoyaki it wasn't anything special but I wouldn't complain about them either.\n\nMy sister and I ordered the Yamadaya Ramen.  I asked mine to be super spicy.  I believe it's another $1 or $2 to make it spicy.  My daughter ordered the chicken katsu curry.  My ramen was excellent and was spicy.  I like my food spicy so it was a good heat for me to handle.  The broth wasn't salty either like some ramen places.  My daughter's chicken katsu curry was a huge portion.

Ordered the Gyoza which was very good, a bit greasy, but good. also ordered Edamame as an app and had to wait about 30 minutes for those to come out.  The restaurant was not even busy and I think the staff just forgot to put the order in... even after I asked them three times on the status of the Edamame.\n\nVery disappointed in the service.  Finally after about 35 minutes we got our Ramen.  The Ramen was very good!  We had the traditional type which is a smaller gauge noodle and the \"dipping\" type which comes separate from the broth.  Both had wonderful flavor.  The only thing you should be aware of is that if you order the noodles on the side, they come cold the broth is warm but as you \"dip\" you end up with cold broth and it is just not as tasty as if it would have been warm.\n\nThe management did take care of us because of the wait and the issue with our apps...

So they just looked annoyed then gave \"my\" chicken katsu to another table who ordered a chicken katsu. \nOur orders finally came but at that point I was so disappointed with the service that my appetite was gone. \nThe chicken katsu itself was good but everything else was luke warm temp and just not appetizing. \nTo be honest I really did not want to tip them but my boyfriend insisted that we did so our meal totaled up to around 28 dollars and we left them what I considered a generous 5.\nWhile we left they did not say a single thank you or goodbye and just stared as left.\nI don't think I ever encountered such a shitty restaurant experience and I tolerate quite a lot of stuff as long as the employees put in some effort. \n\nOverall Review:\nFood: 3/5\nExperience: 0/5\n\nOn a sign outside their restaurant is says the wait will definitely be worth it and it definitely was not.

Our party of 8 was seated immediately but it was all downhill from there. It was a warm Sunday late afternoon and it showed inside the restaurant. The ventilation was awful; it was hot and muggy when you saw down. Our orders were promptly taken thereafter. First, only 1 bowl came out initially. That took upwards of 30-45 minutes. Then our appetizers came after the second wave of bowls. The last bowl never showed so we had to inform our waiter who casually acknowledged that it was \"forgotten\". At that point, one would think that missing bowl would be expedited but we sat and watch as other bowls of ramen were served while the last bowl took another 20+ minutes. By the time the last bowl arrived, the rest of the table had finish. The waiter lacked any sense of urgency. Only a simple \"sorry about that\" at the end of a nearly one hour wait. \n\nOne more customer service anecdote: apparently there was a waitlist after we arrived. There was a family of about 8 sitting outside waiting. One of the ladies had to peek her head in and ask the waiter about open tables because across the room, there were three tables wide open, without any patrons. The waiter/hostess didn't even bother to go out and follow up on the waitlist once guests were leaving. We also saw another angry party leave during our stay here. Of course, this can be all considered heresay.\n\nFinally. The ramen itself? It was alright. The broth is flavorful as advertised, not as salty as Orenchi. I ordered the Yamadaya bowl which was packed with 2 types of meats and eggs. The portions are definitely abundant. The ramen itself isn't as thick as Orenchi, however. Overall though, Orenchi is better Yamadaya.\n\nI am not returning here. One and done.", "author": "Jimmy D."}

That's where it ends. \n\nHighlights of my disappointment:\n\n- Egg is ICE cold, hard boiled with hard yolk, and zero flavoring. It's basically a hard boiled egg you make at home that has been cooked too long. \n- Pork belly had ZERO meat on it. All just blubbery rubbery fat. I asked the waitress if that was normal, and she said No, and gave me a free piece with a some meat on it. \n- Chashu was ice cold and hard. \n- Wait staff (let's be honest... waitresses at this place) don't check back to see if everything is ok (probably because they know it isn't)\n\nRamen doesn't come out hot enough as-is, and when I added the ice cold toppings, it cooled it down even more.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-08-14", "description": "I went to this place a few days ago with friends and I was thoroughly disappointed because of the bad service and mediocre food. This restaurant is a mess. When we first arrived, they split my party of friends because they couldn't accommodate 8 people. No worries about that, but the waiter was much more attentive to my friends at the other table as opposed to the people at mine. Though we arrived at the same time, my friends at the other table got their food and drinks and we didn't even get served water yet. I didn't mind this at first since it was busy at the time, but the service kept getting worse from there.\n\nOne of my friends ordered the tofu salad but felt nauseous when she ate the tofu so she opted to order something else instead.  However, they still charged her for the salad on the bill. The manager argued with my friend saying that she wasn't allergic to anything and wouldn't take the order off. When he finally gave in he said \"fine but you're killing me.\" Excuse me? I understand we ordered the food but if it made someone feel sick, why would you still charge that person for it? I also work at restaurant and I know that when an order changes, you may get charged still since the kitchen wasted ingredients for your meal but my friend had a legitimate reason as to why she didn't want her food anymore and they wouldn't listen to her. I'm not sure if they didn't believe in her reasoning but they handled the situation so unprofessionally compared to what I've seen before and that's what really shocked me about this restaurant's service.\n\nWhile we thought it wouldn't get any worse, I made a stupid mistake when I left this place. My friends were in a rush to leave so I left my credit card at the restaurant on accident. It was my fault for not being responsible for my belongings, but I called 5 times the next day and left messages asking if they could contact me back but they never returned my calls and I'm pretty sure they still have my card. I canceled my card, and luckily there were no extra charges on it, but not calling me back regarding the issue is just so improper on their end. \n\nAside from this, the food I ordered was alright. I tried the chicken karaage from my other friend's bento meal and it tasted delicious. However, I had the shoyu ramen and the noodles were overcooked and the broth was a little too salty for my taste. My boyfriend ordered the cold ramen and his also turned out this way. But he was amused with the idea of eating ramen that was served cold so I don't think he seemed to mind. The ramen menu was also confusing to look at because it shows you a selection of choices but does not explain what is in it. I'm assuming they changed the menu's look because the pictures on here look nothing like the ones I saw when I visited. I guess that doesn't really matter though because I'm never coming back to this place.", "author": "Jireh O."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-18", "description": "So a little background.  Tanpopo used to by my favorite ramen-ya in Japantown but I've noticed their quality has been in decline.  My last trip there I saw a sign for a new place called Ramen Yamadaya and made a mental note to give it a try.  Fast forward a few months and I finally made it there.\n\nI gotta say I'm a huge, huge fan.  I've been diggin Ken Ken and Ramen Izakaya Goku recently but I might have a new fave.  My wife and I ordered the kotteri tonkotsu, shoyu kakuni, and some agadashi tofu.  Here are the food details:\n\nKotteri - Nice richness.  Fairly thick without being overly dense.  A nice sweetness to the broth, which was unexpected.  There was supposed to be black garlic oil but we hardly tasted it.\n\nKikuni - Really nice big portion of the belly.  I did order shoyu, but by the end of the meal the less salty broth from the kotteri was preferable.\n\nAgadashi tofu - You get 2 really big cubes.  I prefer having several smaller cubes so you get more crispy fried surface area.  The dashi has a really nice sweetness to it.\n\nNoodles - They definitely buck the trend here by using long, thin noodles instead of the standard curly noodles.  We tried both the default regular doneness as well as 'hard.'  The regular doneness was fine.  If I could choose I would pick curly noodles but these were pretty damn good too.  No real complaints here.\n\nEgg - The yolk was slightly cooked through and it was not marinated.  Ken Ken still has the best egg by far... marinated and perfectly gooey.\n\nSo to summarize in one word, awesome.  The wait for a table of 2 on a Saturday night was only about 20 minutes.  Very reasonable.  We'll definitely add Ramen Yamadaya to the regular rotation.", "author": "Alan C."}

The broth is excellent - very thick with collagen unlike most of the ramen in Japantown. The noodles that come standard at the thin type of noodles usually served with Tonkotsu broth, to get more traditional noodles order the 'thick type' for 50c more - this adds to the chewiness and is much more satisfying. Broth can be ordered with soy, garlic oil or lots of chilli. Toppings are good quality including kakuni, chashu and tonkatsu pork as well as soft boiled egg and usual vegetables. I recommend spicy level 3 with the special yamadaya toppings. Small rice, dumpling or salad dishes can be added to your ramen for a few dollars more.

They do add a fair bit of pork belly, and fwiw there's already half an egg inside of the ramen which is nice. \n\nBut overall I didn't really like their noodles, I felt they were too skinny, and the broth felt a bit lacking to me as well.

Solid place though, definitely would go there for ramen again, just, I dunno, I don't feel like I can give it a four yet? Don't let the fact that it's less than 4 stars on yelp dissuade you from going though, I thought it was still pretty tasty and worth going to.\n\nMy friend and I came here for lunch and ordered the takoyaki as appetizers. They were so delicious! Super hot though, watch out when you eat them. They might feel fine on the outside, but inside is ridiculously hot (but totally worth it - I burned myself the first time then went back and promptly ate another one haha). \n\nI love that they give you fresh garlic and a garlic press if you ask for garlic. Do it! It makes your ramen so delicious X) I mean, their broth is tasty without it, and their noodles are actually pretty tasty (Hakata style, though a little less firm than others I've had, which I personally kind of like). But garlic! \n\nThere were two main things that dropped this rating down to a 3, in my opinion.\n\nOne, ordering was super confusing. Honestly I'm still puzzled at what I was supposed to do. My friend ordered the yamadaya ramen, but then the lady said something about having to order the broth and that those were just toppings. I was like wait does that mean that the regular ones don't come with any toppings? (They do, though I seriously thought mine didn't have any until I managed to unearth some menma and an egg, to my delight). I'm not a huge fan of the toppings coming on the side though; I got an order of chashu and it came on the side, but it was cold and made it not taste as good. I had to wait for it to warm up in my broth before I wanted to actually attempt to eat it, especially because there were fatty parts that honestly taste a little gross if you eat them when they're all cold and solid. \n\nTwo, and this is a major one for me, their chashu... sorry, it was just so disappointing. I'm a huge fan of chashu - it's usually how I judge ramen restaurants and whether or not I'll go back (what's important for me is chashu, then broth, then noodles, though they're all important). Yamadaya has great broth, but their chashu lacks richness and flavor, and falls a little flat IMO. The regular bowl of tonkotsu ramen came with a (very thin) slice of chashu, but I had ordered a side dish of (much thicker) chashu and I kind of regret doing so. Their chashu is a 2. Do yourself a favor and splurge and order the kakuni (pork belly) instead. It's way way tastier.", "author": "Jess S."}

Ramen broth might be slightly on the tasty/salty side. But I can see how some people might love that. Personally it can be more balanced. But it's satisfying overall. Eggs are boiled well as you can see from pictures. And i believe it was boiled/marinated in soy sauce. Really makes the eggs explode with flavor. \n\nIt got 4 stars because of the salty broth. But try it out. you might like it!", "author": "Ken T."}

As we walked in, one of the waitresses asks us, \"how many\". We tell them 4. It looks like they are getting ready to seat us, when another waitress yells at us in broken english, \"go...go outside. Wait outside\". Another group of customers is already standing behind us as we try to make our way out, but the server gets impatient...and yells \"go\" again. Everyone walks on out. There were plenty of tables open. In fact, they had more people working then customers. How hard is it to sit a group of 4? I already annoyed at this point since they were treating us like kids, I wanted to leave, but it wasn't 15 seconds later after we walked out that they came to get us. WTF seriously? Why couldn't they just sit us the first time.\n\nAnyways, we got to our seat. The waitress left hastily as if she were too busy. We started looking at the menu. The prices are more than the other ones around Japantown (such as Warnaku or Tanpopo). We sat there for 10 minutes and no one came to take our order. It would be totally different if they had a packed room, but they didn't. The service is rude and inefficient. I was annoyed at this point, and I opened up  my Yelp app to write this review, and then I see the reviews about FOOD POISONING. I was already ready to leave before, but those reviews convinced everyone else it was time to leave too. We walked on out and no one even noticed.\n\nFor a new place, the service sucks and they are inefficient. Don't waste your time going to this place.", "author": "Christopher K."}

Oops did I just name dropped ? \n\nAnywho, my bf wasn't hungry so we were just gonna share one bowl. And by share, I mean, I eat most of it and then offer him whatever I can't finish. LOL.\n\nThis is what I got: tonkotsu spicy ramen (lvl 1 spicy), with yamadaya toppings, kakuni pork belly, and we got an iced green tea.\n\nFirst off, the price for a bowl of that spicy ramen was 9.45, and that's without the toppings. I think that's a little pricy for what it was, no toppings?? But the price to add the yamadaya topping was 2.50, so that was reasonable. The broth at first taste seemed good, but the more I ate it, i realized it was actually salty...like really really salty, i was dying for water! I really like spicy food so i got the level 1 spicy but i think i should've gotten the level 2. I Need to have my spice! The noodles were too thin for my taste and overcooked. The egg was also overcooked. The pork belly, although they give you a good portion, was so plain I had to dip it into the salty broth lol I guess that's what you're supposed to do with it. \n\nIced green tea, it came in a can! Wasn't expecting that. This is unsweetened green tea. Definitely refreshing after a bowl of hot and salty noodles. I needed that. \n\nThe service was pretty fast considering how busy it was that day, and customer service was ok too, nothing bad nothing great.

The spicy chili pepper paste is pretty good as well. \n\nWill I come back? No, not if they don't better the ventilation. Ps I think it's the smell of the pork broth.

This place serves all tonkotsu broth (my favorite) either with shio (for the regular and black sesame flavor) or shoyu (also in the spicy flavor). I had the regular tonkotsu broth here because I feel that is the best way to taste if the broth is good or not. The tonkotsu broth at Yamadaya is the best around.... creamy, slightly oily and gelatinous, and pleasant savory taste.  The thick curly noodles (50cent extra) is a must to go with the broth. The thicker noodles with more surface area than regular noodles get coated with more broth creating a better experience. The Yamadaya ramen comes with 2 types of pork, kakuni and charsiu, and a nice flavored egg.  I thought the charsiu was a little too lean making it a little dry. The kakuni tasted good and I think they smoked it.  There is enough fat in the pork belly to balance out the smokiness. \nVery attentive servers and reasonable price for a great bowl of ramen. The layout is good for many 4 person groups and there is a large communal table in the middle. Good for kids and families", "author": "James W."}

Today, my husband wanted to go there since he missed out that day with the family and wanted to taste really good ramen.  This time they just opened at 5pm and they weren't busy.  But this time it was really bad service.  We ordered our food but then the booth smelled like urine.  So we requested if we can move to another table.  But one of the workers wouldn't allow it because they can't delete the table number because we already ordered and they can't remember the previous table we were at.  For example, we were seated in table 35 and we wanted to sit in table 12.  The restaurant is not big and it's not busy at all.  all they had to do is remember that we were previously seated in table 35 just to bill us. And if another family sat in table 35, all they have to do is bill that family in table 12.  Pretty simple.  But no!!! They still wouldn't let us move.  I even suggested we won't order anymore food and that if we did order food, we would remind the waitress that we were the family seated in the other table.  But still they didn't allow us!  So, to make it easier for them we told them to cancel our order and we left and went to the restaurant across from them and that place smells better and did not smell like urine.  Another sad thing about that worker, is that he just made his staff look dumb because they couldn't remember a simple adjustment.

Otherwise the restaurant does not feel warm and cozy, but instead sort of cold and sterile.\n\nPositives:\n+ We received our food fairly quickly - we were probably in the restaurant for a total of 30 minutes.\n+ Fairly limited but good choice of broths: tonkotsu, shoyu, tonkotsu with black garlic oil, and spicy tonkotsu (1 for mild, 2 for hot, 3 for extra spicy)\n+ Gyoza was decent - if it hadn't been for the dipping sauce, it would've been bland though.\n+ Great broth, and HUGE, thick pieces of chashu if you order the Yamadaya toppings (which basically just means extra chashu, seaweed and egg).\n+ BF loved his spicy tonkotsu (#2 - hot).\n\nMehs:\n- Thin noodles means not the delicious chewy ramen noodles I love so much.\n- I didn't receive much broth.  Actually it was to the point where I was afraid to scoop up a whole spoonful with each twirl of noodles for fear that I would run out at the end.\n- Chashu, though we each received 3 HUGE slices, was so tough I couldn't eat it.  Pretty sure I almost pulled my teeth out when I tried to rip one slice apart.\n- Once you get your food, service is pretty sparse.  We had to flag someone down for our check.\n\nNot a bad place, but I wouldn't wait longer than 5-10 minutes for a spot here.", "author": "Tori S."}

That would make this place even more crowded and I would have to get in longer lines when I want Yamadaya. However, there are so many fake tonkotsu in the city which I am upset with and I have to speak out because those overpriced, low-quality ramens have to disappear from the city!\n\nMy recommendation is tonkotsu shoyu. I love their tonkotsu also, but I just love the kick of soy sauce which is SOOO GOOD!!! Good flavorful broth, really thin tonkotsu noodles (which you don't see in fake tonkotsu ramen), and super tender chashu!\n\nPricing is reasonable. Yesterday we ate: \nTonkotsu Kotteri ramen + extra Kakuni \nTonkotsu Shoyu ramen + Mentaiko bowl set \nand, the bill was less than $30.\n\nI am so glad I would no longer have to fly to LA or NY for good tonkotsu ramen.", "author": "Chu R."}

A friend recommended we go here on a Sunday as it wouldn't be too crowded.\n\nWhat I had: spicy Yamadaya ramen, potstickers, and rice with spicy fish roe. The ramen broth was luxurious, and backs up their claim that it takes 24hrs or so to prepare. The pot stickers were meh, I would pass on them. The rice bowl was decent too, but you really do come here for the ramen. \n\nBack to the ramen; it was full of chasu pork, mushrooms and green onions. The noodles were a bit thin and not quite al dente (not like santouka or daikokuya), but still serve their purpose well. The spicy was not painfully spicy, though I got one level below the max. \n\nSo far my only true ramen experience in SF; I would go back for sure.

It has two types of pork which are apparently the regular chashu pork as well a couple of pieces of pork belly.  I preferred the shoyu (soy sauce) base over the regular pork broth option, which tasted a bit too fatty.  We ordered extra corn, which ended up showing up in two side dishes.

My dining companion had the salt base with Yamadaya set up. The broth tasted a little...fishy, but perhaps that's just because of the more savory version I had. He enjoyed it, so that's what's important. \n\nAs others have mentioned, it was agonizing watching people linger over their meals through the windows, but it's not like this is a stand-up noodle joint where you're expected to slurp and go.

Their menu is not very descriptive as it doesn't tell me what is in each bowl. The server couldn't tell me either, so I ended up ordering an extra egg.\n\nOnto the Ramen:\n- Presentation: what presentation?\n- Soup: it was pretty good. Not too salty. And it was hot and I like it hot!!\n- Noodle: it was thin and some people may not like it. I am fine with it. Problem was it was slightly over cooked. Since they are still figuring out the logistic, I think they should cook the noodle 15 seconds less. By the time they put the bowl together and bring it to the table, then the noodle will be perfect. The soup was hot enough to continue to cook the noodle.\n- Egg: There was half an egg in the bowl and it was between soft boiled and hard boiled. I think they should cook the egg 7.5  second less and it will be perfect. I think there was also half a quail egg there but I am not sure. \n- Cha Shui: One pretty thick piece of pork. Thicker than most other ramen shop.\n\nI ordered an extra egg and pork belly. The pork belly was big. Tasted pretty good but I wish it was softer.\n\nThis place has potential but I think they should perfect their logistic before adding more tables. Better to let people wait outside the door than wait at the table. \n\nHere are some specific:\n- Logistic: go learn from Santouka, Ramen Dojo or Orenchi.

The portion size was a bit on the small size, so small that I had to go to Nijiya afterwards to get more food because I was still hungry.  I probably should have ordered the \"extra noodles\" option.  Also, my boiled egg was hidden deep into the soup and might have been overcooked a bit.  \n\nA couple of things:  there is a bare area in the middle of the room.  It seems as if it could accomodate more tables.  Also, this restaurant is overwhelmingly vegetarian unfriendly.  All of the broths are pork based, no fish or vegetarian broths available.  They even removed agedashi tofu from their menu.  \n\nIf they can bump up their portion sizes a bit and provide some options for vegetarians, it could get five star.  I'm hopeful that this new place can work out these kinks soon.", "author": "Re-pley Z."}

It was my second attempt coming here because the first time we left after realizing how little tables there were and how long the wait would be. For our second attempt, we arrived at 11:15am and as crazy as my boyfriend wanted to think I was, I was right. At 11:15am, no line. At 11:29am, there were 6 other parties behind us. Smart girl I am! \n\nWe ordered the following based on a friend's recommendations:\n\n$9.95 Kotteri Tonkatsu- angel hair thin noodles with black garlic oil, a slice of chashu, half an egg, bamboo shoots, and green onions. \n           As another yelper complained, I too felt like my toppings were stingy. I really only had one slice of bamboo shoot and I was left wondering, did it fall into my bowl by mistake? I also split my bowl with my bf and too bad for him I saved the bamboo shoot for myself!\n\n$8.95 Dipping Ramen- served with traditional ramen, chashu green onions with a smokier tonkatsu broth. \n\n$3.50 Pork Belly- enough for two people, super tender and almost cuts like butter. \n\nTakoyaki is not served during lunch and we were bummed but a great reason to return.\n\nThere's also more tables now. They added 4 two person seatings in the \"empty\" space in the middle. The service was not the best but the servers were certainly sweet! They didn't quite seem to have their routine worked out yet.

I'm pretty spoiled with all the great Ramen places we have here in San Diego, so I was pleased to find the style and preference in a Japantown restaurant still so tasty.  That being said, we had THE WORST SERVICE I've ever experienced in a long time.  And then just as I came here to review, yelp let me know this place has a terrible food safety score!  WTF!?\n\nSunday 2/21/2016 I went with six of my cousins to Ramen Yamadaya.  The wait was about 25 minutes with maybe 2 parties of two or three people ahead of us.  When called, we were walked down to a raised booth that barely fit six people.  We waited for 5 minutes for somebody to check on us, at which point I walked back to the front and asked for a host.  A server assured me he'd come check on us.  Five minutes later a guy in a blue shirt and blue pants, came down and dragged a stool over to our table and said, \"There, seven.\"  This was a raised booth so the table would end up at the seated person's chin, while also being about a foot away (because of the step).  I suggested he move us to one of the unoccupied floor level booths, but he laughed and said he couldn't even fit 5 people in one of those tables.  Then he said we could move to the center table seating but it would be 30 minutes, even though there were enough spots for us all.  There were also two tops along on the wall that were unoccupied, but instead we made it convenient for this rude gentleman by splitting up our party.  The party that separated were served promptly by a young server.  They had their food before the rude guy in blue even got to our table to ask us our orders.  He didn't check up on us, didn't refill my empty pitcher/glass, and I found out later he bumped into one of my cousins on the way out of the bathroom while dragging trash out the front door.  He didn't apologize or acknowledge my cousin.  This was single-handedly THE WORST I've ever experienced in the service industry as a customer and a server.

Fortunately that thought was washed away when the ramen arrived. The decor and visuals are yet to be worked on, but the food is the real selling point here.\n\nGood ol' ramen. It will almost never disappoint. What makes one bowl of ramen better than the next is the quality, variety, and, to an extent, quantity of the broth and ingredients. There are several options for the broth, including a fattier, richer broth that's sure to please everyone. The ingredients and additional toppings were also great, and with the Yamadaya Topping, which contains the various toppings already found in the ramen + more, you'll surely be happy with your meal.\n\nHowever, despite the great service and delicious ramen, I was not fully satisfied after the meal. Though $10 for a meal REALLY isn't that much for SF standards, I couldn't help comparing Yamadaya's quantity and portions to other ramen establishments. It was a good amount of noodles, but I was definitely hoping for more toppings in the main dish. \n\nWhat I LOVED though, was the FREE GARLIC as a topping.

First of all they did forget our water which took 3 times of asking them within a good time spand in between each time we asked.  Secondly, they completely forgot one of my cousins order.  The main reason why I am writing a bad review is because another cousin of mine ordered the yamadaya tonkotsu kotteri with no mushroom.  Upon receiving his ramen they accidentally made his with no bamboo (or menma) instead.  After receiving the bowl, we kindly asked the server that he had gotten the wrong order and was suppose to have his without mushroom instead.  However to my surprise, the older lady who was our server argued back that our order was correct and she said after checking the order \"he ordered the ramen with no mushroom which is no menma\".  After trying to talk to the server, it seem she was too insistent that the order was correct and that there were no mushrooms in the bowl when we could clearly see the wood ear mushrooms in his bowl.  After awhile my cousin just did not want to deal with it anymore and decided to eat his bowl after taking out all the mushrooms.

I was excited to see they had the Black Garlic Oil flavored broth for the ramen and huge slabs of pork belly according to yelp so I ordered both.\n\n\nAt least that is what ideally would have happened if they didn't run out of pork belly, but that didn't stop my thirst for the broth. Service was pretty quick and the food came out pretty quickly, but what i saw before me was pretty pathetic. Of all noodles you use, you use those thin flimsy angel hair noodles? THAT IS LIKE A CARDINAL SIN FOR RAMEN! I was really hoping for the thicker noodles used at most ramen places...bu i guess what can you do. That pretty much ruined the ramen for me right there but the show must go on. Also, they are really cheap on their toppings. Although they gave me a lot of corn since i added it, the cha shu and green onions were pretty lacking in number and the cha shu was that tender piece that didn't add much to the ramen.\n\nThe only saving grace for this place was that the 20 hour cooked broth was amazing, one of the best broths i've had. It was super salty and delicious, just as anyone looking for good broth would want. \n\nAlso, I've heard their pork belly is quite generous but I am not sure if it is worth it to go back just for the pork belly...\n\nIf they change the noodles, give a few more toppings, and rethink about the cha shu preparation, this place would probably become a 4.5 - 5 star place.

Came in hoping for some delicious ramen on 4/12 around 4PM after much convincing by my cousin who goes to school in the area. Here's the kicker - they ran out of broth. Yup. Ramen place smack in the middle of Japantown, and they ran out of broth. I understand that it was probably unusually busy because of the Cherry Blossom Festival - but I really would think they would of planned ahead. Not only that - but they refused to seat us for the longest time (almost half an hour?) because they, didn't have broth ready. When we finally got seated - the server approached us asking if we would like to order some appetizers - we kindly declined and asked if we could just order our ramen - and they informed us that no, they do not take orders until the broth was done. Um... okay? Do restaurants normally not take orders until the food was cooked? A little frustrated, we said we would just wait until the broth was done. About 15 minutes later - the same server came by again, and asked if we would like some appetizers to start out. Again - we asked if the broth was ready so we could order, but once again - we were rejected. I'm not exaggerating right now - the SAME server came by 10 minutes after that, and you guessed it! SHE ASKED IF WE WANTED TO ORDER APPETIZERS. Lady - if we said  no TWICE already, WHY would you come and ask AGAIN? Of course we declined - and this time - she kindly informed us we could finally order our food. HALLELUJAH. *Note that I did give them two stars because the tonkatsu ramen really was good - although the portion was pretty small.*  Friendly reminder to the owner - please do try and work on your customer service skills and how you handle situations.", "author": "Lynn A."}

Oil wasn't changed and temperature unmonitored so Tonkatsu was brown, dried out and the juicy flavor and texture that defines a chef and restaurant was lost.

I love ramen and ate plenty in Japan .  The bowl for a large is still small compare to the popular ones in San Jose .  They just give you extra noodles for a large.  $.50 extra for thick noodles, which I prefer.  The broth although look creamy but not as thick as one might think... In regards to a rich pork flavor.  It was more of a slight pork flavor mix with chicken broth.  I'm not fond of the mix.  When I order tonkotsu I want pork flavor !!  The broth so bland, I had to ask for soy sauce n added like 4 tbsp of it n still bland.  What freak happen to seasoning. Pork was hard n dry.  I also decided in the combo which for an x tra 5.00 came with ur choice of small Donburi n salad . I'm opt for the chasu bowl which gosh darn it, the meat was dry n hard.  Dang it this just so bad.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-02-11", "description": "First off, I came here because it was pretty cold and rainy.  I wanted to try a different Ramen place since the one I usually go to is great, but having a variety of different places doesn't hurt.  When walking up the steps to the second floor, there are signs saying \"cooked for 24 hours\".  Those are the main words that I see and I think to myself \"this sounds really really good.  If they take this long to make their brother, then it must be legit\". \n\nAfter being seated, my family orders ramen, tar-tar chicken, gyoza and a spicy tuna over rice.  The first thing that came out was the tar tar chicken.  It looked delicious because it looked exactly like the popcorn chicken you would get at a milk tea place.  However, it didn't taste anything like it.  The chicken was bland and the only sauce for the chicken was a little bit of mayo on the side to \"dip\" you chicken into. \n\nMy girlfriend had the gyoza and she didn't like it.  \n\nNext was the Spicy Tuna over rice.  I didn't see any pictures and I wasn't sure what to expect, but boy was I surprised.  When the dish came out, it was rice, and on top was ground spicy tuna.  If I'm having raw fish, I tend to like it whole or at least in chunks.  This was more like baby food and grossed me out. I tried not to think of it, but the texture was very mushy.  \n\nLast but not least, the ramen.  I ordered the kakuni ramen that came with a large piece of cha siu.  The broth was excellent living up to my expectations and the cha siu was delicious as well.  However, the noodles were pretty skinny, similar to angel hair pasta.  I was not expecting to get that thin of a noodle.  There was half an egg in the soup too, but you can't go wrong with a hard boiled egg.\n\nOverall, I would suggest coming here if you like thin noodles or if you want something to warm you up.  Also if you are a poor college student, this is a great ramen place to go too because they said \"if you are a student, we will give you extra noodles free of charge\"", "author": "Jeremy H."}

And the thin noodles were perfect. I loved how spicy my broth was and was surprised by the kick of the level 2 (wtf do hell and death taste like?!?) My husband commented that he liked the flavor of his broth and it had an almost creamy taste to it.  I just wished there was a bit more broth in general.

REALLY BAD SERVICE and MISLEADING PRICING!!!!!! *******Highly NOT RECOMMEND*******\n\nMy friends and I (a group of 10people) came here on Sunday for lunch, and since its a crowded place, we were okay to split into two tables (table of 6 and table of 4), but by the time our second group got their table, which was about 5mins after the 1st group, the tables next to them were all opened that was ok to fit all of us together, so we asked if we can join back in 1 group, and we were given a \"no\" for it... Well no biggie\n\nThen we were given 2 menus - 1 look like a regular menu, and one had a title of \"NEW MENU (starting at 7/2x/2014)\", both of them have the same item - their FAMOUS Cheese Ramen, but with different prices, and sadly we didn't notice it till we got the bill. When my friends order the Kotteri ramen, the waitress was serving us in a pretty \"unprofessional\" temper, I mean, pretty bad one.  She stopped one of us who was going to order for the group as she was \"asking\" the \"1st person\" of the table.  Then, my friends were suggested to get the \"Yamadaya Ramen\" with Kotteri flavor without being advised the add-on price. \n\nSo when we got the bill, we were \"surprised\" to see the price was more than we thought, so we tried waving our hands to ask one of the waitresses on the pricing issue. The 1st one told us that she wasn't the one taking the order and advised us to look for that particular person (again, in a \"not so polite\" way). And when we were able to stop the waitress who took the order, she just said \"it's 12 something\" then left us, and after several round of passing by our table, she never stopped by again.\n\nWe were somewhat pissed off by that service, but we also understood that it was a pretty busy restaurant, we decided to go out to the cashier to talk about it, and that's where the craziest thing began.\n\nSo the waitress finally noticed she can't ignore us and came into us trying to explain the bill. 1st she said the price included tax... WHAT? The tax was charged under the tax column and we still being charged tax again on the ramen column? Then she walked into someone who \"might\" be the store manager at the time, and that \"manager\" told us that it's \"common sense\" that if there is a \"~\" next to the price, it means \"price starting at\". Hmm never heard about that, and even if it's true, usually there'd be a note or whatever inside the menu stating that, then she blamed us not asking about the \"~\" meaning... WOW! My very 1st experience of being told by that! Are we really expected to know the \"~\" sign meaning without any note? Don't even think that's lawful.\n\nThen we were told that the \"regular look-like\" menu was the new menu and we should follow the price on it.... Lol then why did you even give us the menu with a title \"NEW Menu (starting ...) while the other one doesn't even have a date on it! She then said its \"common sense\" again and asked us if we ever heard of a restaurant having their pricing decrease instead of increase... Yeah I do, should I introduce those restaurants to you? And is that a solid point that it's your customer's responsibility to understand this \"confusing\" price increase?\n\nAt last, after having some tough conversation with the waitress and the \"manager\", they agreed to take out the price increase of the cheese ramen ($12.95 to $11.95) but not the other Yamadaya ramen which was all $0.50 up of its original price stated on the menu. After all, the price wasn't really the issue as it's just like 3 bucks different on the bill, but the service, the experience.... Nah, I'm not coming again, and we won't go there again, and even though your ramen tasted good, we will surely help Yamadaya to spread the word of this \"common sense\" experience to our friends and neighbors too!

The broth is very opaque and drizzled with Black Garlic Mayu. The broth itself is very salty, yet flat in flavor. The Mayu added nothing to the soup as there was neither much garlic nor sesame aromas from the oil. Minus one star. I was expecting to be able to upgrade the thin noodles to the thicker ones as other Yelpers mentioned but unfortunately, that upgrade is no longer on their menu (they had it crossed out). I'm not a fan of the thinner ramen noodles. Minus another star. The worst part was definitely the meat. The kakuni pork belly was not tender at all and flavors were mediocre. Chashu was even more disappointing. It was tough, hard, and dry. Minus another star. The only redeeming factor was the egg which was a good soft boil and seasoned well. Menma was also decent but they literally only gave me three measly shoots.", "author": "Maggi K."}

Although I've moved to San Francisco, I still have the same yearnings for that Yamadaya taste. So today, for Monday's lunch, I dropped by this SF branch for some tsukemen. The menu looked pretty much exactly the same as the one in San Diego. They even had the same free extra noodle/rice with student id note at the bottom. That was a good sign :) but I came here for tsukemen, and the extra noodles were for ramen (I guess I could've asked for the rice, but I wasn't really thinking at the time.. my mind was too transfixed on eating tsukemen). \n\nWhen my two bowls finally arrived, I could tell this was not quite the same as SD's tsukemen... First of all there was only one piece of chashu, secondly there was a bit of chalkiness on the bottom part of the egg yolk where the egg white is at it's thinnest, and thirdly there was no lime/lemon slice... I guess I probably could have asked for  a lime/lemon slice, but whatever.. that minor detail doesn't really have much impact on my rating system. So!!!! I dunked my first plop of noodles into the tsukemen broth.... *mMmMm* the flavor is quite reminiscent of that thick, salty, almost slimy broth I so dearly missed, but something was off! There were no pork bits in the broth! In SD, there was always these little hidden pork gems throughout the soup, but today, sadly they were nowhere to be found. All I had was my single slice of chashu.. Very well, so be it. I dunked the chashu into the hot broth for a couple seconds, and took a bite. Oh... the center of it is still cold... Okay... I'll just leave it in the broth for a while longer... *bite* hmm it's still kind of cold at the center. Into the broth again while I eat another plopping of noodles. *mmm* Back to that chashu *bite* Still not quite the warmth I wanted, but whatever! After teasing myself for so long, I had to eat this chashu right now.... but alas! this chashu wasn't quite right for other reasons. It was hard and bland! SO DISAPPOINTED!!! :( A couple more mouthfuls of chewy, thick noodles :) and nicely flavored bamboo shoots, and I'm onto the egg. I dunk the egg into the broth really quickly just enough to get a bit of saltiness on it, and pop that thing in my mouth. It's not bad, but my suspicions were correct... The chalkiness on one side of the egg indicates that it has been marinated for a little bit took long, causing it to have too strong of a sake flavor. Ehh okay. I finish the rest of my 7 oz of noodles and I'm glad to have tasted the flavors of SD's Yamadaya again, but I'm also slightly disappointed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-11", "description": "Ah so the quest for the perfect ramen bowl continues on and leads me to the \"motherland\"... Japan Town! We popped by this place after my cousin suggested it following a heavy night of drinking and bouncing around the city. This restaurant is not located in the main parts of the mall area but it is in the plaza with the cobble stones across from the main mall.  Its location seems to benefit it, as it's not ridiculously packed with a line of people leading out into the street like so many other restaurants in the area. We seemed to come right in the middle of a rush so there was a few parties ahead of us. Waiting patiently for our party to be called, it was probably about a 25-30 minute wait for our party of 4. Suddenly, the hostess calls another party of 4 before us, even though this group of chattery girls had CLEARLY arrived after us! I nearly snapped the hostess' head off because I was HAAAAAANGRY at this point. Not funny, hostess!!! She amended her mistake, and seated us :D \n\nSo right off the bat, the service did not impress me. But I was willing to side step that little factor and just try and focus on the food. I ordered the tonkotsu kotteri ramen with the black garlic oil in the slow cooked creamy pork broth. My cousin went on to describe how they give you complimentary fresh garlic which you can crush at the table to add more garlicy goodness to your bowl, as you please. I. Could. Hardly. WAIT! Mouth watering, the food arrived within a reasonable time. We kept asking little things of the server and she honestly did not seem to like us and the fact that we kept requesting little things from her. A bowl of rice, more tea, more water, more garlic, etc. As a previous server myself, I can understand why this could be irritating but hey.. it's the job at the end of the day and she repeatedly kept asking us \"is there anything ELSE...?\" in a not-so-pleased-to-be-serving-you fashion. Like I said, I realize it is irritating but you are in a customer service role so please try and act like you enjoy your job..? \n\nANYWAYS. The ramen was fantastic! The broth was incredibly rich and creamy, and the black garlic oil blended in so nicely. I added some fresh crushed garlic cloves to my broth and it literally brought the flavors out EVEN MORE so I highly recommend doing so! The pork itself was not out of this world, and I've had more tender, juicier slices in other ramen places. The boiled egg was sufficient but again not anything crazy good. I would say what stood out to me the most were the fundamentals of ramen: the broth and the NOODLES. Not everyone likes the thinner style ramen noodles but I love them. They remind me of soba, but a guilty more sodium loaded version of soba. Great bite to them and added texture! I slurped up every last inch of noodle I could get! \n\nIf it weren't for the shaky service experience I would have given this place 5 stars. But it was just the little things that got to me that made the meal a little off. I would certainly come back to try more variations of their tonkotsu broth ramen and to try some of the other items as well.", "author": "Mariko M."}

I mean those are the basics for ramen and you can't really go wrong with them. Although the pork was a little too fat and I didn't like it, but that's just my personal preference. The problem was the broth. This is what makes ramen so special. I wouldn't call myself a ramen expert, but i know that the broth was saltier than it needed to be. With that said, there are other good Japanese restaurants around the place with the same prices, or even cheaper. After all, you are in a Japantown. So don't be lazy and explore the place for more delicious Japanese food. Before I go, my last advice to those who still wants to try this restaurant out is eat inside the place.

Our server talked up the ramen shop even calling it \"the #1 ramen shop in San Francisco\" which is a pretty bold statement in itself. He gave us a run down of the menu since it was our first time there and even let us know which dishes were the popular ones and trying to sell us on them. It worked on my friend and GF, but I was there on a mission to try Tsukemen. So our food comes but we're missing one of our appetizers (chicken karage) which the server fails to tell us that they're out of until we've already finished our meals. The food itself was not of the \"#1\" caliber the server spoke of or anywhere near it. The broth for my Tsukemen was very salty. The chashu was very dry and rubbery, and overall the my Tsukemen experience failed to live up to its hype. I'll probably give Tsukemen and other shot but definitely not at this place. To end off our experience here, the service was slow and it took a good 20-30 mins for us to pay for our food and leave. Although the server was a good ramen salesman, I don't recommend this place.", "author": "Gerald P."}

In my subsequent visit unfortunately the TV fame has gotten to them the quality has gone down... not to mention everytime I've been here after that first time I get this server who is clearly not Japanese but speaks such poor English she screws up the order.... every single time. If you work at a Japanese restaurant you should be able to speak Japanese, or English (we're in America), and knowledge of the food is kind of required. But not here. And not to mention - the wait is always insanely long.

Considering this place is pretty expensive, there are many hole in the wall ramen places that are much more delicious. I came with a party of 8 but our party was split into two tables because they could not accommodate our entire party. For some reason the table with majority of men, received more attention and quicker service. Once I ordered the food, it made me feel nauseous and so I asked our waiter for another dish. I had barely touched the first dish and explained to the manager that I simply could not eat it and should not have to pay. He then continued to argue and said it was my fault for ordering it and so I should pay. He finally agreed to void the first dish but exclaimed that this argument was \"killing him.\" It was unprofessional and rude behavior.

I'm a person that loves rich broth.  The thicker the better! Being my first time that i went i got the Kotteri.  It was fantastic! Extremely rich in flavor! they add a black garlic oil to this one as well.  The only thing though is that it was actually \"too rich\" for me...I ended up getting a little sick from all the flavor and richness of the broth because i eat and drink the entire thing.  With that being said if you are going for the extra rich don't drink all the soup.  I have an iron stomach and even i couldn't take it hahaha!\n\nThe regular Tonkotsu ramen on the other hand was perfect.  just enough richness and oilyness that makes Tonkotsu Ramen in the first place delicious! The Charsiu is great overall! but if you get the thick cut pork belly......HAVE MERCY it's amazing and don't let anyone tell you otherwise! the noodles are cooked perfectly! Because it is a Tonkotsu style ramen they use thinner noodles.  So don't be butt hurt and complain about thin noodles.  It's supposed to be like that.  and just for the record obviously the slower you eat the colder everything gets, and the soggier the noodles get.  don't blame the restaurant for that.  Ramen is supposed to be eaten fast and as soon as you get it.  It's disrespectful to the cook otherwise.  So don't wait until everyone gets their ramen JUST DIG IN!!\n\nThe Karaage chicken is by far THE BEST that i ever had in the bay area thus far.  seriously, no one does it right and i will argue with you over and over about this.  the Karaage is the closest to Japan and Hawai'i as far as flavor and texture goes.  The salad they give you has a bomb sesame dressing as well.  \n\nNow, as some people have mentioned about the cold egg, meat and blah blah blah.  I had a great first experience but, the more i went the more i realized that they are not as consistent as i want them to be.  the last time i went which was 5 days ago the egg was a bit cold.  but if you understand how onsen egg is made you will know it takes some time.  if they made it super fresh for you all the time you would complain about waiting too long for the food!  I'm sure when they just opened up they were not expecting such a huge amount of people consistently coming in and putting pressure on the cooks and staff.  I am sure they will step their game up to make all our fellow yelpers complaints into positive ones! =)", "author": "Lance Y."}

The wait was only an hour (compared to more than that at other places). \n\nWe were told we could not have our checks separated as I was paying for one of my friends, which I was ok with. The food itself was rather subpar. The broth was ok and the chicken karaage was probably the best part of the meal. The ramen, for a ramen shop, was pretty terrible; the noodles were not cooked all the way through, so there was a doughy/starchy texture to them.\n\nThe service was extremely terrible, and I had expected it to not be amazing due to the crowd. When we had asked for the check, our server returned and said it seems we had paid for ours. I had told her we had not paid yet and that it wasn't given to us by anyone else. A second server came to us and asked us the same thing. We thought \"the next time they tell us we paid, we would just say ok and leave\", we were joking of course. It took us twenty minutes to get the bill and we couldn't put it on two cards, so I said I would just use mine. I was in a rush to leave so we handed the card to the server, but when we did the math, we realized they had provided the wrong check and nearly charged us fifteen dollars more than we owed. I had brought this up to the server, and she attempted to argue with us about how we were given food that we weren't given. It took nearly ten minutes to receive the correct check and a refund for the original tab.\n\nI probably won't be going here again as there are many other better ramen places in SF for a better value.\n\nAtmosphere: 5/10\nFood: 4/10\nService: 4/10\nWtf: $1.00 charge for hot tea, which isn't all that great.", "author": "Evan K."}

In many aspects my expectations were met. I ordered the kotteri kakuni ramen. Kotteri means extra fatty broth while kakuni is the meat that would go on top. When the bowl of ramen came I was instantly excited. Three thick slabs of kakuni pork belly, as well as a soft boiled egg and bamboo shoots were resting on a bed of noodles submerged in a fatty, milky white kotteri broth. The pork belly, while slightly chewy, was decadent, soft, and fatty and almost 1 inch thick! The broth was easily the best part of the ramen. It was silky and rich without being overly oily (it is still kind of oily, but thats to be expected with the type of broth I got). The toppings were splendid too; the egg was perfectly soft boiled and the bamboo shoots were nice and crunchy. The downfall of this ramen is definitely the noodles. The noodles were very frail and thin and unable to stand up to the impact of the rich broth and fatty kakuni. Other than that, this ramen was very satisfactory.", "author": "Ryan F."}

My friends both got the spicy tonkotsu, levels 1 and 2. The yamadaya topping is basically everything you get in the kakuni ramen... so I basically had double the toppings, which was fine with me. Chashu was fine, pork belly was nice and thick. I'm not sure if it was because they were scraping for broth, but the broth was extremely flavorful... almost to the point where it was getting too salty. I kind of wished they did dilute my broth! So not sure if it's normally that salty and thick or if it's because they were running low on broth... guess we'll find out next time. Overall, the broth was tasty and flavorful. Noodles was fine, didn't have any weird taste that other ramen places sometimes have. Tried my friends tonkotsu spicy broth, not sure if it was salty since all I tasted was spice.\n\nOverall, the food was good, could use a little bit more refining. Service was fine, waiter checked on us a few times. Could use some more seating, since there's a big open space in the middle. Hopefully they figure out how much broth to make and not run out 2 hours into opening anymore!", "author": "Johnson S."}

WTH?  the wait was about 20 minutes or so before we got seated (only cuz a group of 6 left before their name was called).  after being seated, the H2O technician gave each of us a glass of water.  i say H2O technician only because she didn't do much else but fill everyone's glasses all night.  we never got any menus until one of my friends noticed the H2O technician putting menus on an empty table after getting us our water.  the menu lacks useful information for first timers.  all soup base for their ramen is tonkotsu (pork bone) broth.  when you see tonkotsu shoyu, it's not just soy sauce based broth, it's a combination of tonkotsu and shoyu.  weird.  under toppings: yamadaya toppings is basically a small dish of onions, bamboo shoots, mushrooms (or fungus as the waiter kept calling it - like it was going out of style), half egg, small piece of pork belly, two slices of chashu, and two pieces of nori.  the best deal under toppings has got to be the kakuni pork belly for $3.50.  make sure you ask for the free garlic if you like garlic in your ramen.  they won't offer to bring you any if you don't ask.  i'm not usually a noodlephile, but this time i did think that the noodles tasted of alkaline (which is very common in chinese wonton noodles and such).  maybe it was just me.  i don't know.\n\ni know that they just opened, but this is a chained ramen place.  they have 6 other restaurants in socal with a 7th one on the way.  i feel like there should be no excuse for new restaurant pains.  it would be nice if they hired people with actual restaurant experience.  it's like they just walked off the street and got hired cuz they had a pulse.   also, how do you not have hot tea but everything else on the drinks menu?  opened for a week and still missing items from your menu is just poor planning.  no offense to the staff, i'm sure they're nice people and all.  i blame the owners/management. if you really want good ramen and want to stay within city limits, go to sawaii or izakaya sozai on irving.  heck, i'd even say genki if you don't want to drive too far from jtown.  otherwise, drive down to san mateo for ramen dojo or orenchi in santa clara.", "author": "Charleston C."}

Our group of four waited only 5 minutes on a weeknight for a table. We placed our order and then the problems began. \n\nA waiter came by and noticed we didn't get our waters yet so he said he'd be back with them. He never came.\n\nOur karaage arrived first and it was ordinary. Then two of us got the sides that we ordered to accompany our ramen. So our ramen orders were coming next, right? Of course not! That's too obvious! My other two diners got their orders of ramen while me and my other friend still waited for our ramen order as our sides got colder and colder. As our two friends were nearly 3/4 of their way through their ramen, we stopped someone to ask when we were getting ours. The waiter checked and it turns out they gave our orders to another table. Thank you very much. He assured us that ours would be the first priority. I had a perfect view of all the orders leaving the kitchen and ours were definitely not the first priority. When we finally did get our orders, the waiter was very apologetic. I assumed he would at least say that our ramen would be on the house or that he wouldn't charge for our appetizer, but he just kept apologizing, while all I wanted to do was finally eat my ramen with my extra cold toppings.\n\nThe service issues left a sour taste in my mouth which made for a very unenjoyable bowl of ramen. The noodles were different, but the broth was flavorful...not the best, but decent. Having read about how this place was successful in Southern California made it all the more disappointing that it could have all these basic service issues. My favorite ramen is still around the corner at Waraku.", "author": "Rick T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-07-28", "description": "Although the food at this particular ramen joint is decent, the service leaves much to be desired.\n\nThe food is pretty standard of any ramen joint. They offer a few variations on the traditional tonkotsu broth (pork broth), with kotteri (fatty broth) and the shoyu (soy sauce) option being offered. There are other things added to the ramen such as bamboo shoots, pork slices (which by far are the best part of the ramen), some strange mushroom and scallion onions. The overall taste of the ramen was good, however the food was not my particular issue with the restaurant; the service was.\n\nAt first everything seemed fine with the service; we (my friends and I, 6 people in total) were seated by the hostess at one of the tables surrounded the center bars. We were asked what we wanted from the menu, as per usual. The restaurant also offered extra bonuses for free (such as a larger portion of noodles or a bowl of steamed rice) with the presentation of a valid student ID, so about 4/6 people opted to do this. After having the order taken, the waitress proceeded to ignore us for the next 30 minutes or so, not even offering us refills on water or fetching pepper. The restaurant wasn't all too crowded either, with the lunch wave almost being over, so there weren't that many people to attend to. 30+ minutes was a ridiculous time to wait for a bowl of ramen, seeing as most of the ingredients should have been prepped ahead of time. When the food finally arrived at the table, the waitress had somehow managed to put in an order for 7 bowls of ramen, for the 6 people at the table. Not only that, but the wrong bowl of ramen arrived first ( with the waitress not realizing that the wrong bowl was delivered. Apparently they can't differentiate their own food.) Which meant when the second bowl was delivered, the right bowl delivered, most of the first bowl had already been eaten. Eventually this was sorted out, with the first bowl being comp'ed (made for free). Mind you, this process took at least another 15 or so minutes to figure out, with the staff either not understanding our issue, or being too confused to deal with it properly. When the check finally came, we realized that some of the free student ID additions had been charged onto the bill, which caused another delay. Finally, after dealing with the staff, we were allowed to leave. Overall, if you want only okay food and want to deal with confused staff members, this is the place to go to.", "author": "Kristina L."}

I'm not a ramen expert but I love what I get there: Tonkotsu Spicy ramen with a side of Kakuni pork belly, since the chashu pork that comes with the ramen leaves something to be desired. I think getting spicy is necessary to cut the super fatty heavy flavor, but I hear that's what ramen is supposed to taste like.\n\nService. 1-2 stars. Again, I've been here a dozen times and the service ranges from fine to bad. Everyone is super nice but it is SO DISORGANIZED. I think they don't have assigned tasks or sections. All of the servers are trying to serve everyone, and the result is that everyone gets forgotten.\n\nA sample of my experiences:\n\n-I walked up at 9pm on a Thursday and there were 20 people waiting to be seated. I almost walked away, but then I realized that half the restaurant was empty, they just hadn't got around to seating people.\n\n-It usually takes 15 minutes to get water. You get your ramen, ask everyone that passes by for utensils, and 10 minutes later you get them.\n\n-They often run out of things. Some days they're out of pork belly. Fine, I think, they get it fresh every day and had higher demand than usual today. They run out of corn. I think, ummm, okayyyy I guess the corn is ordered fresh every day? \n\n-Finally, the most recent time I went there they had run out of to-go containers. NOPE.

I had the kotteri ramen and the karaage.  The broth was good, not the richest kotteri I've had,  but still good.   There are some toppings that already come with the ramen,  and after deciding to stick with those instead of getting more, I was pretty happy with the amount.  Now onto the noodles.  They make their noodles thinner than other ramen shops.  While it doesn't affect their taste exactly, I think I prefer the thicker noodles.  They just seem much easier to slurp up than these thin ones.   These ones don't taste bad,  but I'm just not used to it.  The chicken karaage was delicious.   Simple,  non-pretentious,  and homey.  The outside was perfectly crisp and the inside was not dry.   Now onto the service.  We had a great server who was very courteous and just great.   All our food came out reasonably fast, so we didn't have to wait too long.   However,  this is all one you get in.   Waiting to get in is the long part.  There's no real waiting area except the stairs so the line starts going down the stairwell.  There seems to be plenty of unused room in the establishment for more tables.  However,  since I went just about a week or so after they opened (when they seemed to still be fixing things up), hopefully this is no longer the case and that space is being put to good use.   Coupled with the somewhat rushed and dreary atmosphere, (again because it looked like it was still being \"finished\" at the time) it didn't make for the best impression.  All and all,  once you get past the appearance and the long wait,  this place proves that it has the potential to win you over.   The food is pretty good;  it's a new spin on ramen,  but still comforting and the service is impeccable.

I wish the pork in here was bit more melt in your mouth good. noodles aren't that chewy for the standard ramen when I got it. \n\ntsukemen was really flavorful. I go here just to eat that now. noodles are fairly chewy not authentic Japan chewy but better than their standard ramen bowls since it's not sitting in the broth over cooking. \n\ntsukemen broth is very porky and savory. I love what seems to be a smoky bonito flavor to it. \n\nAll in all a pretty exceptional place to go grab ramen if you are in Japantown and wanna grab ramen. \n\noh if you aren't into really porky tasting ramen you may not like this place.

I ordered extra pork belly on the side for a bit more variety. Overall, the broth was good and coated the noodles very well. However, because the noodles were so cold, over time, the broth became cold as well so by the end it was just cold noodles in cold broth.

Vegetarian and ramen rarely ever mix because ramen is all meat broth - that's what makes it ramen, right? Wrong. Well, right, but vegan ramen is heaven sent & Ramen Yamadaya really knows how to do it. Coming from someone who's never had actual ramen before, just the vegetarian options in NYC - Momofuku, Totto and the likes, I have to say SF's Japantown has done it right. I ordered the Vegan ramen with vegetable broth, noodles, corn, mushrooms and scallions with a side of \"fresh\" garlic and hot sauce. The garlic was pretty darn fresh, literally from the clove, raw, whole, \"fresh,\" and we were able to mince it ourselves. Once the sides came out, our orders of edamame and dumplings followed. Plus, I ordered a side salad, which was refreshing sliced cabbage with a side of peanut dressing. It was light and not over-pouring, a light start to what was about to commence. Once the ramen came, the slurping and noodle-gorging began. I just couldn't stop! After adding the hot chili sauce, the ramen was perfect. The broth wasn't too salty and the scallions added a crunch. The mushrooms, corns and noodles were all cooked perfectly. For a vegetarian, I was fully satisfied and let's just say the empty bowl speaks for itself. Plus, the tab came out to under $15.

Let's just say I was super excited to try this place out when I saw the excellent slice of pork belly you can add on. First of all, I would like to say that I often judge a ramen place by how well they cook their soft boiled egg because I usually order a second egg with my ramen. After my two friends and I ordered, we waited about 10 minutes to get our appetizer. No big deal, didn't mind waiting because we were not in a rush. Then the first side order of pork belly came out with a side order of egg, which I find weird since these were suppose to be ramen toppings. My friend ordered the dry ramen with the soup on the side, and he received his order 10 minutes before the remaining orders came out. I think as a restaurant, they should be able to synchronize the tables orders together so no one is stuck sitting there staring at the other person eat or having the other person wait on the rest of the people. I found the portion of the ramen to be somewhat small. The broth was okay. Let's get back to the egg. I had that side dish of an egg, which was semi-hard boiled, and the two egg halves in my ramen (one was soft boiled and the other was completely hard boiled). That's kind of unacceptable. Normally, I would give places a second try because maybe what I ordered was just bunk. But, the service was not great and the egg was highly inconsistent..I would rather give other ramen places a try in that plaza before I ever come back to Yamadaya.

We thought that our ramen well come out soon, but it didn't. We waited for another half an hour for the ramen to come out. When the ramen came out, everything was cold, the extra noodle and the paigu. It was ridiculous. I didn't understand why they didn't just wait for everything to come out at the same time and why the ramen took so long. When I went to the one in SD it was quick because their broth is ready ahead of time and they just bed to boil the ramen. It was really disappointing after having to eat at the one in SD.

Whats different is the fact that they use a thinner type of noodle, which can be good since it feels like you're eating less and has a nice delicate feel to it, but I felt I lost a lot of the texture from the thicker noodles that I'm more accustomed to seeing.  I do think they offer the thicker noodles but it cost extra.  If you're a student you can also get extra noodles for free which is pretty awesome but I'm more a quality over quantity type of guy.  The toppings were solid, nothing extraordinary but nothing bad.  The menu was a bit confusing, i can't even tell you what exactly was confusing but I do know my friend had a difficult time ordering and eventually didn't know what he ordered.  The chicken karage was dissapointing after seeing an article posted on the wall about how great their chicken karage was.  It was very bland and didn't have much texture to it for pieces of fried chicken.  It definitely could have used more batter and a longer cooking time to get that great light and crunchy texture.   For awhile, Japantown didn't have many options to get a good bowl of ramen, but now there are some decent options.

Admittedly, I am not a big ramen fan, but I grew up on it and certainly ate it in Japan and other places on the West Coast and Hawaii. That said, the broth is fine, ingredients fine, but what is up with the noodles? They are thin, a bit too chewy and lack the typical waviness that comes from cooking in baking soda or something similar. Further, my ramen loving kid had a hard time eating the noodles. He couldn't seem to swallow them and kept coughing and choking on them. Weird. That has never happened to him elsewhere in the US or Japan. It also seems that they only serve tonkotsu ramen, and I could very well be the only person in California that is not a tonkotsu fan. I am partial to lighter fare, such as shio ramen or the seafood ramen of Sapporo. But ok, they are catering to the latest non-Asian trend of tonkotsu  ramen that seems to be hitting SF lately. I understand. We also ordered a side of gyoza (pot stickers). They came out just as I would have expected to see in Japan, and my gyoza loving kid inhaled most of them. I did get a taste of one, though---waaaa! Too much ginger. They do offer a better assortment of beverages than I would have expected. They have Calpis on the menu, which is my kid's fav, so he was happy while we waited for our meal--so yes, pretty kid friendly. I mean, who else drinks Calpis but kids and maybe teenager? On  a rare warm SF day, I was also able to get some iced green tea (granted, in a can, but it was just what I was wanting). Based on other reviews, it seems that the SoCal locations are better. I will stick with Miki for now--or just wait to eat ramen when I go back to Japan.", "author": "\u548c\u5b50"}

I do not mind giving tips especially when we get excellent service but it should be left to the discretion of the customer and not because the waitress wants extra money in their pocket. The food was alright and nothing spectacular.", "author": "Benjamin L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-06-07", "description": "I went back the other day to try the spicy sauce - the menu says there are three levels: 1 (spicy), 2 (hot) 3 (very hot), and 3 costs an extra 0.50 buck. I got number 2. The sauce was more salty than hot - not my kind of hot chili sauce, and not my kind of spicy ramen soup. I think I'll stick to the black garlic oil or the original tonkotsu flavor.", "author": "s c."}

After spending $50+ for a family of 4, they have the nerve to charge $.25 for a take out container.  Can they not account for that in the price of the food?  We went there with 2 other families, and I don't think any of us would go back.", "author": "Craig U."}

As a customer, I felt very disrespected and uncomfortable while dining here. After the Cherry Blossom Festival, my friends and I decided to go try this place. Right when we got seated, the server asked us \"Are you ready to order?\" We replied, \"No, we just got here.\" Then she proceeded to tell us that our food will take 15 minutes to make after we order and we reply with \"Okay, that's fine.\" Immediately after that, she asks us again if we are ready to order and we say no. We barely had time to look at our menu and we felt very rushed as customers. The food was okay and the lady messed up our order twice. When I told her that I wanted to share with my friend, she said there is no sharing allowed and I would have to order in order to stay in the restaurant. I'm fine with that but the way she said it sounded so demanding and rude. When we were leaving, the server brought the check over to my friend who was paying and she kept looking over her shoulder to see how much she would tip. THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE AND MADE US ALL FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. The server should NOT be standing there over our shoulders watching how much tip we would leave. She stood there for a good 3 minutes just watching the whole time as my friend signed her name on the device. When my friend clicked NO TIP (because we were going to leave a cash tip), the server made a sound and reached her hand over to the device to try to click the back button. WHAT?!? I just couldn't believe that happened! Even though we were going to leave tip after the horrible service we received, we didn't even want to tip anymore after that. Nonetheless, we left a cash tip anyway and just left. I have never in my life experienced service like this. I am DEFINITELY NOT going to recommend this place anyone and will NOT be going back.", "author": "Bijin H."}
