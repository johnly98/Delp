The combination was $12.95 before tax and tip, which I felt was fair for San Francisco/Castro prices.\n\nThe food was alright; it seemed like the red peppers in the Pad Kra Pow were more for appearances rather than heat. The Panang Curry was good but wasn't as full-bodied as I would like for a curry.\n\nOverall, it was a good spot to satisfy my thai-cravings and hunger.", "author": "Kevin W."}

You walk up the staircase which the restaurant doors leads you to. Once at the top of the staircase, it's as if you've entered someone's living room. Huge bay windows, a fireplace, odd wall decor that doesn't match with the cloth napkin decorated tables. An unusual vibe for a restaurant, and a Thai restaurant at that. \n\nOnce seated, I decided to go with the Raad Na Pak (Pan fried flat noodles with tofu, broccoli and a light gravy sauce). I love them wide flat noodles and broccoli-- what could go wrong? A lot, friends, a lot. Notice they say \"light gravy sauce\"-- this sauce was anything but light. When I received my dish, it was as if I ordered a noodle soup. My noodles, broccoli, and tofu were swimming in this thin gravy. Being open minded, I decided to go ahead and taste what I was served. Unfortunately, the story doesn't get any better, friends. My dish lacked any type of flavor; it was the plainest noodle dish you could imagine. I doused my dish with chili so I could taste something. I left feeling sad, guys, sad because the Thai food I received at this restaurant did not remotely accurately represent what real Thai food is: bursts of flavor, spices, and color. \n\nI will say the service wasn't terrible.

So we got sat down and just ordered away. \n.\nBtw there is a stair case to go up to the restaurant. So might be tricky or hidden. But big sign to not mislead where your going upstairs. \n.\nThai coconut seafood soup -this was yummy. Soothing for the throat. The fresh ingredients inside was nummy. Love the fresh shrimp and mushrooms! Very good to start with. \n.\nPapaya salad - thai style. It was sweet and spicy. Looked refreshing. This wasn't as spicy as i thought it would be. But it was good because i was craving this. Beautifully presented with lots of color. Light and refreshing, and opens the palette for a more appetizing meal. \n.\nBbq beef - savory. Sweet. Full of flavors. Tender beef. Juicy but yet satisfying. Pairs well with rice for sure. \n.\nCashew chicken - lots of chicken with scattered cashew on random bites. Juicy saucy and unique flavor from this dish. Easily one of my to go to dish on any day. \n. \nStir fry pineapple duck - smokey roasted duck in full flavor. Love the pineapple sweet sauce to compliment it. As well goes good with some carb white rice. Just love how the duck has its own flavor even when smuttered with their signature sauce. \n. \nStir fry thai basil seafood - basically the basil in the sauce is what compliments this dish. Love the fresh seafood used in this dish. Love the big size shrimps! Nice and light dish. \n.\nBottle of merlot - compliments the seafood and bbq beef for sure. As well calms the spiciness down too. \n.\nBrown rice - filler food but just goes so damn good with all the dishes named above. At least they offer brown rice okayyyy.\n.\nOverall chat about the festivities. Eat a little bit, drink some more. Calling it a night in Castro is what's up. Thanks for reading and stay classy.

After all, we like Thai food, and we pass by it every time we're on Castro, or at least we pass by the sign since you can't really see the restaurant from street level. It's upstairs on the second floor of a Victorian where the windows face the neon marquee of the Castro Theater (photo: http://bit.ly/1bQis8o). There are also two other so-so Thai places in the Castro where you don't have to climb stairs to get to them. Maybe we've concluded so-so Thai is better than a potential groin injury on those stairs. Now I'm just making up excuses, but we finally made it.\n\nYes, we tried Thailand, and I have to say that satisfying Thai food continues to be an elusive search in the Castro. We started on a misstep because we didn't read the descriptions carefully enough. We thought we ordered true Spring Rolls when we asked for the $6.95 Thailand Rolls, but it turned out to be fried ones, and it turned out to be two dollars extra for \"Fresh\" Spring Rolls. Even though they were decent enough, it was a bummer since I didn't want to have an oily crunch in my mouth when I wasn't prepared for it (photo: http://bit.ly/1yDshLN).  Jamie was more forgiving, and he segued into the $8.95 Chicken Noodles.\n\nIt was a rather bland plate of pan-fried noodles sauteed with chicken, egg, bean sprouts, onions and ground peanuts (photo: http://bit.ly/1GNZHOX). I decided to get into a more vegetarian mode with the $8.50 Pad Ma Keau, a full plate of sauteed eggplant mixed in black bean sauce, garlic and basil (photo: http://bit.ly/1CzIaXI). It was tasty enough for me but still lacked a certain oomph to make it completely winning. Weak menu choices? Perhaps but even a base hit among the three dishes would have been nice. Couple that with the rather passive service, and it made for an evening infused with a pervasive mehness despite the passing quality of the food that was served. So down the stairs we go.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...middling Thai dishes make the journey to the top of the stairs a fitful one\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...a bit like someone's living room converted to a restaurant, for better or worse\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...not sure if they were trying to be unobtrusive but it came across as a bit passive\nTOTAL - 3 stars...don't expect a stairway to heaven", "author": "Ed U."}

The two item plates include salad, but all lunch specials include soup.\n\nThe soup was sour deliciousness in a small bowl that left me very happy.

This review is written by a former restaurant server and host.\n\nI was a server and a host for a year at a restaurant and I know really bad service when I see it. I stopped here with my friend after a yoga class. It was about 9:40 and they close at 10. It was her birthday and I was really excited to take her out. As soon as we got there, the host said abruptly we could only order take out and we couldn't eat there since the restaurant is closing.\n\nFrom experience, usually you do allow guests to still seat 20 minutes before closing and if you can't, then you usually say something like, \"Hi guys, we're really sorry but the best we can do is provide take out because the restaurant is closing soon. Is this okay with you?\" We decided to do takeout anyway. Strike 1.\n\nFive minutes into looking at the menu, the host then says, \"I don't want to be rude but the kitchen is closing soon so you need to order!\" Again, a better approach might be, \"Hi guys, our kitchen is closing soon and I want to get your order in before it does. I have some great recommendations if you are having trouble deciding. Is there anything I can help with?\" Strike 2.\n\nWe rush our order and I hand the host my American Express. He glances at it haughtily, hands it back and says, we don't take American Express. Do you have something else. Exasperated by my whole experience in the course of 5 minutes, I replied this is kind of ridiculous. He looked up, glared at me said you have a bad attitude. He cancels our order and then kicks us out of the restaurant making snide remarks as we leave.\n\nLook, I know the restaurant industry is stressful - I've lived it. But there's something really wrong when a restaurant allows its host to be that rude and give that much attitude. This is restaurant earns a well-deserved 1 star.", "author": "Eric N."}

In fact, I might caution you:  they are not entirely vegetarian aware, so be absolutely sure to ask the server if there is fish sauce (Nam Pla) in the vegetable/vegetarian dish you are about to order.  If the server seems hesitant, smile gently and ask them to go confirm it with the chef... \n\nThat said, it's your basic Bay Area thai food, pretty solid with all the usual sorts of things - and a pretty good value for your buck.  The dining room is pretty nice - on a second floor so you get a good view of people watching down on the street.\n\nIf you are vegetarian - just be sure to ask about the menu.  And remember - lots of people in other countries consider fish a vegetable (in Mexico, they think vegetarians eat chicken and only \"strict\" vegetarians do not).", "author": "Jenn C."}

It was delicious and I'll definitely be back!\n\nThe restaurant is on the second level of a building on Castro St.  It's a smallish place, with the dining room overlooking the street and the big theatre across the way.  It's dimly lit with a neat red glow on white textured walls.  Pretty cool.\n\nService took a little while to get us started, but once the ball was rolling, they were very fast.  For a party of 5, we received our entrees promptly and all at the same time (I hate it when there's just one person still waiting to get their food and everyone else sits around awkwardly not eating theirs).  I had the spicy seafood in a clay pot and it was fricking awesome.  Tons of flavor and just enough spice to make my nose run but not burn my tastebuds off.  The only thing I didn't like about it was the taste of the mussels -- they are obviously frozen, not fresh.  Oh well.  My husband had the basil duck and inhaled it so I suppose it was edible at the very least.  O_o  My BFF had a crab pad Thai which looked awesome and is on my list to try next time.\n\nPrices are actually very very reasonable, especially considering the location.  I'm always surprised when stuff in the heart of the City isn't set to break your bank account.  $12.95 for the clay pot entree.  Nice!  \n\nThe only bad thing is the parking in this neighborhood.  We were late for our reservation because it literally took us like 30 minutes to find a spot way out in the middle of fucking nowhere....we had to hire a midget Sherpa guide and a donkey named Bobo to guide us back.

Their fried spring rolls are also better than most; they give seven little ones rather than three medium, which ends up being a better value per inch of spring roll.  (But they could be a little less stingy with the sauce.)  Other favorites of mine are the Gluten Pad Khing (seitan to you and me), Pad Ma Keau (eggplant) and the vegetarian Tom Yum soup.  \n\nI will be happy to give this place a better rating if they address certain menu deficiencies, to wit:  They have NO vegetarian yellow curry listed!  This is an outrage for a fan of Thai food.  They also have  pumpkin curry, recently added, but it does not provide a vegetarian option.  What are they thinking???  Part of the problem is that they have \"vegetarian\" sections to the menu, which is really unnecessary.  A vegetable entrees or ala carte  section sure, from which anyone can choose.  But vegetarian options ought to be offered on every appropriate item - where one also chooses beef or chicken, spicy or not, etc.  (And the vegetarian options should be \"tofu\" or \"vegetables only\", not just one or the other.)  \n\nYes, I could call and make the special request for these items - and forgo the convenience of the online ordering.  Or I could make the request in the notes section, but I've had less-than-stellar results with this restaurant and them not reading these notes.\n\nSome attention to those details would go a long way.

We didn't have much time and when we let our server know that, she was very accommodating. I had the Pad Thai (online the menu description is rice noodles with egg, bean sprouts, onions and ground peanuts on the top) and I added chicken. There were also crisp shredded carrots in my dish; it was a good- sized portion and tasted very fresh.  My friend ordered the Pad See Ew -- pan fried flat noodles with broccoli and egg in light black soy sauce. I tried a bite of hers and it was delicious too. We both had the Thai iced tea to drink, and we were also given ice water without having to ask. Our food was brought out very promptly. Our table had a great view of the street below and the beautiful Castro Theater across the street. One can tell that the restaurant was converted from an apartment, but I don't see that as a negative at all! It's a great space that gives a warm feeling.

No one came to greet us or take a drink order until we had been sitting down browsing the menu for almost 10 minutes.

Maybe it was because they were close to closing, but I was a server for a long time, and managed to give my last tables at closing good service while completing my sidework. \n\nThe decor and ambience was a bit strange as well. The lighting was turned down way too low...low enough that I was having trouble reading the menu and actually got up to turn the dimmer up myself. The walls are deep red and white and covered in over-sized dots, that looked like giant braille. It just seemed strange for a Thai restaurant. I could see how it would be a lot more appealing during the day.\n\nWe ordered the Tom Ka Goong (Shrimp Coconut Soup), Basil Shrimp, and Spicy Tofu Noodles. \n\nThe soup tasted pretty watered down and there was no kaffir lime leaf, galangal, ginger, cilantro or lemongrass...all traditional thai spices one would expect to flavor any decent Tom Ka soup! The rest of the dishes also lacked the traditional palate of Thai spices, making them mediocre at best. \n\nThe spicy dishes were only hot from the sliced raw jalapenos that were added. They did not even use Thai peppers/chilis. The shrimp tasted like pre-cooked frozen shrimp that had just been thawed and tossed into the wok last minute making them very bland. No searing of any kind could be seen on the shrimp or veggies. I have definitely made much more flavorful and authentic tasting Thai food at home just by using Thai curry paste and coconut milk!\n\nAnother disappointment was the lack of rice options.  Brown or Jasmine only, no sticky or coconut rice. \n\nIf I were only reviewing the food I would give Thailand Restaurant 2 stars since the food didn't necessarily taste horrible, but it paled in comparison to other Thai food I have had.

It's extremely rich/deep for a tom yum, so maybe they'd been steeping this batch of broth longer or with more shrimp heads/shells in it.  Could have used a few more shrimp in the actual dish, but there were tons of mushrooms.  We ordered it \"Spicy\" and it was extremely spicy - of which we are huge fans.  From the other yelp reviews (and perhaps obviously) it would seem that the level of spice you get is based on who's cooking that dish, so I guess we lucked out.  Will definitely be getting this again.\n\nPapaya salad - also spicy, but not very memorable on the whole.  There was nothing particularly wrong with it, I suppose the papaya was a little flavorless, but all in all nothing great.

Plus, for the second time eating there, we were brought food we did not order.  The first time, I asked for a cup of soup, the waitress kept saying bowl, I kept saying \"CUP\" (no I didn't yell but wanted to).  Anyway, they brought me a cup but later in the meal they brought a bowl.  I explained to the person bringing the bowl that I ordered a cup and had already ate it but (as I said earlier) he didn't understand my English and looked confused.  He did take away the bowl.  Then the bill came (PROBLEM NUMBER 2) which is written in Thai (I'm guessing it was Thai since I don't speak or read Thai) and they charged me for a bowl (I only knew this when I asked them to interpret the bill for me).\nSo to make this short, same thing happened yesterday only this time my partner ordered a salmon item but then the server explained the \"specials\" and my partner changed his order, and made sure the waiter understood (at least we thought he did).  Guess what?  Both the special and the salmon dish was ordered and when we asked why the waiter pointed at me and said I wanted it!!!! I ordered a soft shell crab dish and pointed out what I wanted to him on the menu so I have NO idea how I became the guilty party. \nAny way even though I like the food, NEVER AGAIN.  They need to give me a bill in English so I know I am paying for what I ordered and they need to get the waiters into ESL so that they can take orders in English and understand what the customers are saying.

I was honestly a bit disappointed as I got lured into the place by newspaper articles gracing the side of the entrance to the restaurant (one needs to walk up the stairs to 2nd floor to reach it). The newspaper articles showcased Leon Lai (Lai Ming) and Maggie (both are Hong Kong famous movie stars/singers) dining at the place while visiting SF. Upon reaching the 2nd floor, there was a host that greeted me and seated me to a table with a view of the Castro Theater.\n\nCustomer Service: I sat down by myself and received the menu fairly quickly. I would say the customer service here was 3.5 stars. It wasn't great, but at least they were timely and came to refill my water once. They also got my bill/check out fairly quickly after I asked for it and were attentive enough to recognize that I was ready to order. However, the waiters were not necessarily extra nice by any means.\n\nFood: I am a big fan of duck and ordered the roasted duck in red curry ($9.95). Rice (white) was ordered separately for an extra dollar. When I got both items, i was a bit shocked that the portions were a bit small (even for Castro standards cmon!!!). The scoop of rice was less than the size of my palm (very small indeed) and came in a little soap dish holder size rice plate. The duck curry came in a long dish, but very few pieces of duck and 4 pieces of pineapple. I have to give credit to the place for their saucing as it was pretty good- not too salty or spicy. It suited my taste buds well, but I was very VERY disappointed in the duck. I probably got a total of 5 actual pieces of duck and even within those pieces (about 2 inches long and 1/2 inch wide), half of it was seriously fat. Cmon now! I've never had duck in the bay area with that much fat. The duck wasn't very lean. True, sauce was great, but fatty duck doesn't make a girl happy. Then came the dessert I ordered because I wasn't full off the 5 pieces of duck and 4 pineapple slices. I ordered the roti (think Southeast Asian style \"bread\"/fried with condensed milk) for $3.00. I got it with the condensed milk on top of the \"bread\". I thought it was okay though it's hard to go wrong by pouring condense milk onto something like fried \"bread\". All together, my meal totaled $18.00 including a 15% ish tip. \n\nAmbiance: Credit for the restaurant for keeping part of the Victorian style facade and for not over decorating. During half way through my dinner, the waiter came by and placed a light candle on my table. I guess that was the centerpiece for later dinner times (I ate around 7:15pm) or so.  \n\nParking: Good luck. Street meters only. paid parking on weekdays and before 6pm. Weekends after 6pm and Sunday (all day) are free. I would suggest using public transit.\n\nTransit: Take BART and get off at any stop in downtown SF (my suggestion would be embaracaero bart station.

There is nothing wrong with the food, for the most part it tastes like the food from the other two Thai restaurants located a block away. The service however is maddening. After getting seated it took about 10 minutes for someone to approach us about drinks and food. We ordered everything at once and everything came piece meal (if at all). Some people got all their food at once. Others got an appetizer and then nothing. One person ordered a salad, got their food 10 minutes after the last hot dish was brought to the table - but only after hounding the entire staff multiple times about the missing dish. Needless to say we ate our food cold. We were ready to pay and be gone before we were even done eating. Only the bill never came. We had to run after a server for the bill.

Last Saturday (02/27/10), three of us had dinner, ordering family-style.  However, only I ate some of one dish (Seafood Clay Pot).   As we paid the bill, I began to feel a bit unwell.  Arriving home (Noe Valley) I felt increasing nauseous .   Within 5 minutes I was violently ill.  Immediately I felt fine.  \n\nThe next evening I returned, with the leftovers.  I related the events to the hostess and 2 male staff (owners, perhaps).  Far from being apologetic, they were clearly skeptical and even hostile.   Caveat emptor.", "author": "duke k."}

Thankfully I ate before or I would have starved! i ordered the lunch combo soup+ 2 entrees + salad for 9 bucks.  That should have sent red flags like crazy so i blame myself.  First the soup was watered down and with a funky super sweet taste? like they were making up the flavor with some sugar and chili pepper. I have had this type of tofu soup before so I knew the taste was very off. then the lunch combo came i had the chicken satay and a veggies w tofu.  The \"salad\" was 4 pieces of iceberg lettuce with hidden ranch.  f. my life. the veggies and tofu was actually quite good but it was about 1 cup worth of food.  the satay chicken was dry and not marinated nor thick  to the standards of other places. ugh.  I wanted to like this place because the location and decor are great but it comes down to the food for me. i would rather eat in a basement in Soma and  have good food than here.\n\nor walk down to the mission and get a taco", "author": "Paola L."}

I always try pad thai at thai restaurants to see how they prepare the most common standard thai dish. While it was good, I think they added too much of the sweet sauce and noodles.

We ordered two appetizers; the Thai rolls and chicken satay before our entree. The Thai rolls were so hard and overcooked as to be unpleasant and we never received the satay. Our entrees were equally unimpressive and the pad Thai actually was bad. The wait staff was equally unimpressive, poor communication skills, brought the wrong wine twice, forgot our appetizers, and it took sooo long to get our food. \n\nWhen we asked for the check they asked about our food and we were very pleasant, but honest. She looked at us, said nothing and walked away. OK, so the check comes and the satay we never received is on the bill. So we explained we never received the satay and they immediately said OK and took the check back. When the check came back to the table the satay and price were whited out, but she did not change the total bill...HELLO.

Since my last visit quite a number of years ago, there has been some really eye-popping remodeling to the space, bringing it up to a more mod look. My friend ordered a cup of the tom ka gai soup (chicken coconut soup) and basil chicken, while I had the yum pla muk (calamari salad) and veggie raad na pak (flat noodles with tofu, broccoli, and a light gravy). My friend was in heaven with his selections. I have always enjoyed the piquant flavor combos in Thai salads, and this calamari dish was no exception--I love all the basic flavors of sweet, spicy, and sour coming through in that salad, as well as the perfectly blanched calamari. The raad na, however, had a disappointingly simple flavor profile and a bit off-putting texture in the gravy. Not sure what happened with the starches or other components in that dish. Other than that, I enjoyed the meal with a Singha(tm) beer and the company. And yes, I probably will return to try other dishes here.", "author": "Ryan T."}

Basically, of one of us tries something, we can tell if the other will like it. Then, recently, he had to go there for some reason, and he liked what he got. So we all ended up going, and I got to try it. The advice I was given was to try something that is NOT a curry. The first time, I tried some basil seafood thing. It was ok, nothing special. There is no sticky rice, just regular rice. The thai iced tea wasn't too good. we had some spring rolls which were tasty enough. Overall, it was ok, nothing great. Before I had a chance to yelp it, I went here again. the first time was a Saturday evening and we were seated right away. This time was after 9pm on a Thursday nite. They close at 10 but still seated us. This time I ordered what j always orders.  Just told the waitress, I'll have what he's having. It was a seafood thing with a red chile sauce... it was good. I liked it! The iced tea was better too. And, even though it was late, we weren't rushed out. b liked his soup too.

The evening with my visiting two nieces started pleasantly enough.  We got a table right away and our drink order came quickly.  Things went downhill rather rapidly after that.  The appetizer that came out of the kitchen was the wrong item.  When I told the waiter it was the wrong thing, he insisted that what I ordered was correct.  I told him no that was not what I ordered.  He took it back and he was clearly pissed at us.  The first entree arrived before the correct appetizer did.  The girls and I all ordered three different types of pad thai (one with chicken, one vegetarian, and one with shrimp) -- okay so we weren't creative that evening -- and my husband ordered his usual yellow curry.  Things did not arrive at the table consistently and while husband was waiting for his rice, the waiter came out to tell us there was no white rice available.  He could have brown rice at the same price of white rice.  The pad thai was &quot;okay&quot; but it was a gelatinous mess that the minute it hit the plate started to congeal. The yellow curry was not very tasty and was made mostly from the cheaper dark meat.  But in addition to the rude service -- I gave the waiter a 15% tip which I probably shouldn't have -- the revenge was in their favor.  I had terrible diarrhea last night as soon as we got home.  I would love to see what previous reviewers were referring to about the CleanScores.com reviews, but they all show 100.  Something must be off on this one.

These diners leave with a lukewarm impression. Underneath the obligingly familiar \"American Eggroll\" taste for those \"who get the same thing every time\", are a selection of more Thati tasting more authentic dishes. Here are some suggestions:\nTry the appetiser called \"fresh rolls\", similar to summer rolls in a Vietnamese or Cambodian restaurant-soft, unfried and yummy sauce to go with---these are new; or the fish cake appetizers. Very nicely seasoned. Yes, pan fried is not the same as deep fried in pastry - is it? If you must, order the chicken satay.\nFor a beverage I highly reccommend the cold Young Coconut or HOT Thai tea. Try it. \nOrder a soup. Any soup. The coconut milk and lemongrass will make the entrees taste even better and get your digestive juices flowing. Just do it.\nFor an entree, I reccommend the clay pot entrees, or the lighter red, green or red curries. Any of the curry sauces are a delight. For much lighter fare, try the silver noodle (glass noodle) dishes. If you want to be adventurous, order Pad Thai and ask them to put extra shrimp paste in it!!!!!\nTry these tips and you will uncover a lovely Thai restaurant in the gayest neighborhood in America and the best view of a great American moviehouse, the Castro Theatre.", "author": "Nan L."}
