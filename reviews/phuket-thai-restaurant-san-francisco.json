At first we were thinking about going to a Indian food restaurant across the street from Phuket Thai, but it was more of a socializing place with small portions for food that only did breakfast foods. So we ended up deciding to go to Phuket Thai. \n\nThe inside was very pleasant, and elegant. So many choices for food, good size food portions, the food was Very tasty, the service was very kind, and the prices were fairly cheap for San Francisco. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place to anyone who enjoys Thai Food! \n\nNOTE!\nIt may not have a lot of room to park, but if you can get around that IT's DEFINITELY WORTH IT!", "author": "Casey L."}

All the items didn't taste very Thai in that they lacked flavor. The beef fried rice was decent (we had asked them to remove tomatoes and they did that), they also added a good amount of chilly in the larb to make it spicy as requested. The reason for this review though, was the tom yum.\nI had a few sips and felt very ill with a bad aftertaste in my mouth, despite the fact that it had very little flavor. \n\nLooking at the other reviews for this place I'm sure it has some good dishes but there are definitely things to avoid on the menu- which isn't generally what I'd want to do when I order from a restaurant. \n\n2. Delivery: The delivery time pretty swift for how far they delivered and the lady that delivered was nice.\n \n3. Buck value: I definitely ordered from here because it seemed like a good cheap Thai place- which is pretty rare in the city but I don't think it met any other expectations besides that it was a cheap meal.", "author": "Spriha S."}

I ordered the Calamari appetizer and that was probably the saltiest thing I've had in a while.

I also ordered their \"Pud Thai\" (Pad Thai; you'll see what I mean if you go there) and it didn't taste like any Pad Thai that I've had.\n\nIt didn't even taste Thai, once again. I'm south East Asian, so I'm honestly quite familiar with the taste. The noodles are normal rice noodles, not skinny flat, and the taste of the plate in general was like a tangy barbecue sauce, replicating something more of Chinese noodles masked with loads of lime.\n\nIf you're not in a hurry and you just want some quick food for kinda cheap, I wouldn't recommend to come here but give them a try.

I was especially scared to eat shrimp from suspect restaurants, but thankfully everything went okay. The pad thai tasted particularly American. Ketchup was definitely involved in the sauce. The tom yum soup was not so yummy. It had an odd taste to it.

Oh, how I was wrong.\n\nThe first bad omen was that there was a handwritten sign taped to the front door warning: \"The charge for non-customers to use the bathroom is $2.50\". (No, I am not kidding.)\n\nI walked in at 2:30pm today and the place was totally dead. A woman greeted me and immediately told me they were closing soon. (It was half an hour before closing.)\n\nI should have taken this as another clue that things weren't going to end well but I'd commuted by bus all the way over and it's hard to find a Thai restaurant open in the middle of the day in this area. \n\nI ordered the Veggie Pad Kee Mao and it was the worst Thai food I've ever eaten. (Both in the US and in Thailand.)\n\nI thought about sending it back because I really didn't want to pay the $11 and change I knew this was about to cost me but decided to go ahead and eat it. I could only eat about 1/4-1/2 of it when the waitress came back over and asked how everything was. I told her \"It's not that great...to be honest so I'll go ahead and take the check and a box.\"\n\nI think she thought that I felt rushed by her and not just that the food was bad but actually it was both.\n\nI had to ask a second time for the check and the box.

First off, they had a special lunch menu, but it turned out that it does not apply to weekends.  We were the only people there and something like lunch deals are supposed to draw people in so I don't know why they are the only Thai place in the area that does not offer lunch deals.\n\nWe ordered the fried calamari, which some dropped on the floor upon delivery.  They apologized, but did not really compensate us in any way.  No big deal, but it would have been a nice gesture.  The calamari itself was ok.\n\nThen came the nuer yang.  The reason I even stopped in this place because I was craving this grilled beef dish that I haven't had in years.  My best guess was the beef was microwaved.  Now I doubt that was really the case, but it was so chewy and flavorless.  There was no sear marks or browning, it was basically grey and rubbery.  They offered a replacement dish, but this was the only reason I walked through those doors.  As I said, we were the only customers there so there is no reason for them not to make a little bit of an effort to cook the food.\n\nThis was the worst food I have ever had in San Francisco, but I hope they don't blow off these reviews and put some effort back into their work.", "author": "Ian E."}

This is a perfect place to have a quiet conversation with someone, or even go solo with a book or journal. \n\nI've been to many Thai restaurants all over northern and southern California, and the food was not very memorable. For a person not familiar with all the other great Thai restaurants San Francisco has to offer, this would be a good start. The menu consists of all the standard seafood, soup, chicken and curry dishes.\n\nI usually judge a Thai food place from how they create their basic dishes, particularly their noodles, curries or tom yum gai soup. Since this was a new venture, I decided to ask the server what their popular dish was, and was guided to one of their pad thai. If this was one of their signature dishes, I may choose a different restaurant for thai. The noodles seemed overcooked, so they became too sticky and starchy. It also lacked the full flavor I know Thai food is capable of.\n\nSeems like their delivery service was a hit, since that night there were many call in orders. FYI - it was rainy on this given night.\n\nBottom line - if you do your research, you can find several great Thai restaurants in many areas of the city at all price points, but if you want some basic Thai food in the Haight/Divisidero area, this is the place.", "author": "Ron C."}

I like it because it takes about 10 minutes to arrive.  I ordered last week.  The food was fine, though, the price was much higher than I remembered.  It came with a new menu so I will be better prepared next time.  I think the vegetables and shrimp were all very fresh, but the Pad Thai was dry.  Still, good enough for take out when cooking is not an option.

There was about 1 other table with diners when my boyfriend and I went on a Monday night.  But people kept on coming in and out for take-outs.  \n\nEverything was alright.  Service was a bit on the slow side; perhaps because the chefs were in a hurry to get all the take-outs outta the way first.  We shared the tom kha kai soup (oh boy, it was only yesterday and I can't remember the spelling), and pad thai.  Or Pud Thai as they call it.  I always find these subtle name differences very amusing.  It's like the restaurant's own way of sticking it to the Man.  \"Pad thai?  oh yeah?  well, we call it Pud Thai!  It's supposed to be pronounced Pud Thai!\"  \n\nBoth dishes were delicious.  Like most Thai restaurants in SF, food here is good and reliable.  I guess I could've given it 4 stars, but the stale decor and lack of dine-in customers just make your dinner experience that much more boring and lackluster.  So I will stick with 3 stars.", "author": "Candice B."}

Still really like certain dishes on Phuket's menu but agree with a few other long time local loyalists that they have slipped over the last few years.\n\nHowever, very friendly owner and staff keeps me ordering. Plus, like my favorite bartender, they know my order, 1/2 star for that.\n\nTake out or delivery is the way I go.  Credit card accepted.\n\nI live almost three blocks away so naturally I order delivery.  Yeah, I'm real lazy come 9:-9:30pm. I eat at the restaurant with friends a few times a year. The decor could use a makeover but the friendly staff and the dishes we like make up for ambiance shortcomings.\n\nUsually order the Tom Kha Kai (chicken in coconut milk soup) which I still love, Nuer Yarng (charbroiled flank steak specially marinated with honey garlic served with garlic chili sauce), and rice.  The Nuer Yarng seems to have changed over last few years, seems rather chewy now.  Please, fix the Nuer Yarng!\n\nGuess after all this time I'll have to try something different, maybe the Panang curry or the Kai Yarng (charbroiled chicken with chef's special marinade served with sweet and sour garlic sauce).\n\nI hope Phuket reads these reviews and make the improvements to return it to one of Lower Haight's Best Thai restaurants.  With all the Thai palces in the neighborhood I hope they can be one of the best.
